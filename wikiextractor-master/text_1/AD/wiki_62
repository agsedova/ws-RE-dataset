{"id": "2267612", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2267612", "title": "Suresh Raina", "text": "Suresh Raina\n\nSuresh Kumar Raina (; born 27 November 1986) is an Indian international cricketer. An aggressive left-handed middle-order batsman and an occasional off-spin bowler, he is also regarded as one of the best fielders in world cricket. He plays for Uttar Pradesh in all forms of domestic cricket. He was the captain of the Gujarat Lions in the Indian Premier League, and is the vice-captain of the Chennai Super Kings. He has also captained the Indian cricket team and is the second-youngest player ever to captain India. He is the first Indian batsman to hit a century in all three formats of international cricket.\n\nRaina made his ODI debut in July 2005 against Sri Lanka at the age of 19. However, his Test debut came about five years later, in July 2010, against the same opposition. He scored a hundred on his Test debut. He was a part of the Indian squad that won the 2011 World Cup.\n\nHe lives in Rajnagar, in Ghaziabad, Uttar Pradesh. He has three elder brothers Dinesh Raina, Naresh Raina and Mukesh Raina and one elder sister Renu.\nAn article by Suresh Raina was featured in the 2012 book .\n\nIn 2000, Raina decided to play cricket and subsequently moved from his hometown Muradnagar, Ghaziabad, Uttar Pradesh (near New Delhi) to Lucknow, to attend the Guru Gobind Singh Sports College, Lucknow. He rose to become the captain of the Uttar Pradesh U-16s and came to prominence amongst Indian selectors in 2002 when he was selected at the age of 15 and a half years for the U-19 tour to England, where he made a pair of half-centuries in the U-19 Test matches. He toured Sri Lanka later that year with the U-17 team. He made his Ranji Trophy debut for Uttar Pradesh against Assam in February 2003 at the age of 16 but did not play another match until the following season. In late 2003, he toured Pakistan for the U-19 Asian ODI Championship before being selected for the 2004 U-19 World Cup, where he scored three half-centuries, including a 90 scored off only 38 balls. He was then awarded a Border-Gavaskar scholarship to train at the Australian Cricket Academy and in early 2005, he made his first-class limited overs debut, and scored 645 runs that season at an average of 53.75.\n\nIn 2017, Raina did not manage to remain a regular fixture in the Indian team and was dropped from the Annual Retainership of the BCCI.\n\nDuring South Africa's tour to India in 2010, Raina was called in the squad for the second test but was not selected in the playing XI. He then played against Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe in Zimbabwe as all the other first-choice players were rested from the tournament. India lost the first match under his captaincy against Zimbabwe by six wickets but won the next match against Sri Lanka.\nSuresh Raina also captained the Indian Cricket team for the T-20 series against Zimbabwe in June 2010 and India won the 2 match series 2–0. He was the leading run scorer in this series. Virat Kohli and R Ashwin made their T-20 debuts in Raina's captaincy.\n\nRaina was then brought into the Test squad for the tour of Sri Lanka in July and August 2010. He made his debut in the Second Test after Yuvraj Singh was ill. Sri Lanka made 4/642 declared and India was in trouble at 4/241 when Raina came in to join Sachin Tendulkar. Raina went on to reach the maiden century on debut becoming few of Indian players to do so as the pair put on a double century partnership. Yuvraj recovered in time for the Third Test but the selectors opted to retain Raina. However, due to poor form throughout 2010 (apart from a half-century against Australia at Mohali) and a failure to make any impact on the Centurion Test which South Africa won by an innings, he was dropped in favour of rookie Cheteshwar Pujara for the remainder of the series, in which India battled back to a 1–1 draw. He made 100.\n\nRaina was on the bench through the first half of the 2011 Cricket World Cup as captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni instead went with the in-form Yusuf Pathan. This remained so until the group game against West Indies, which Raina played in place of an injured Virender Sehwag. Against defending champions Australia in the quarter-final, Dhoni made a strategic change, omitting Yusuf Pathan in favour of Raina. Raina responded by assisting Yuvraj Singh in a successful run chase through high pressure, making 34 from 28 balls to carry India to victory. In the semi-final against Pakistan, he batted with tailenders to score an unbeaten 36, a significant contribution to India's final tally of 260. He also took Younis Khan's catch off of Yuvraj's bowling.\nSuresh Raina played some crucial knocks in quarter-final and semi-final of the World Cup, which helped India to win the 2011 ICC Cricket WorldCup. Gary Kirsten, the then coach of India, said 'Raina won the World Cup for us with some crucial knocks'.\nIndia toured West Indies after the World Cup with captain MS Dhoni rested and vice-captain Virender Sehwag injured. Gautam Gambhir was named the captain for the One-dayers and T20's with Raina as his deputy. But due to injury Gambhir was ruled out, with Raina captaining with Harbhajan as his deputy. India won the series, but Raina averaged just 16.4. In the Test matches, he scored 232 runs at the average of 46.4 scoring crucial fifties in each Test.\n\nRaina was selected for the England tour in July. There was a lot of debate on who should play the first Test at Lord's, Yuvraj or Raina. But a century in a practice match against Somerset sealed a place for him in the playing eleven. Apart from a half-century in the first Test at Lord's, Raina managed just 27 runs from seven innings. He struggled against short bowling and in the final Test was out for a 29-ball duck, the longest in India's Test history.\nRaina running through a poor form in the Test series especially in the last match made some impact in the 5 match-ODI series though the team was unable to secure a win at all. He top-scored in a rain-affected game at the Lord's scoring a commendable 84 from 75 balls.\n\n\nHe was named as 12th man in the 'Team of the Tournament' for the 2012 T20 World Cup by the ICC.\n\nRaina registered strong performances in this series, which India won 3–2. He scored 277 runs at an average of 92.33 with four consecutive half-centuries but only two of them in a winning cause. He became 13th Indian batsman to cross \"4000 international\" runs, in his \"159th ODI\" and got his first Man of the Series award in this format. At the end of the series, he broke into the ICC top 10 ranked batsmen for the first time in his career.\n\nHis knock of 100 against England at Cardiff was nominated to be one of the best ODI batting performance of the year by ESPNCricinfo.\n\nSuresh was included into India's test squad after almost two years. Raina was selected in the final Test match at Sydney, under the captaincy of Virat Kohli.\nLater on, he announced his return to form in the Tri-Series with a flamboyant 51 against Australia.\n\nSuresh Raina was not selected in India's first tour to USA, where they play West Indies for 2 T20Is. However, he made a reentry to the ODI team for a series against New Zealand. Later he was ruled out due to Chikungunya .\n\nHe was selected for a T20 series against England. In that series, he made a strong comeback. He scored a 63 in the 3rd T20.\n\nIn January 2018, he was recalled into Indian side for a 3 match T20I series against South Africa. He had a strike rate of 154, and his performance of 43 off 24 balls and a wicket in the last T20 helped India to seize the series 2–1. He was awarded Man of the Match in the same match. In October 2018, he was named in India C's squad for the 2018–19 Deodhar Trophy.\n\nIn 2011, India toured West Indies after the World Cup with captain MS Dhoni rested and vice-captain Virender Sehwag injured. Gautam Gambhir was named the captain for the One-dayers and T20's with Raina as his deputy. But due to injury, Gautam Gambhir was ruled out with Raina captaining with Harbhajan Singh as his deputy. India won the series, and his captaincy was highly appreciated by former west-Indian legends.\nHe was again declared captain of the young Indian cricket team during 2014 Bangladesh series in 2014 while all the regular players of Indian cricket were rested. He led his team for 2–0 victory in the series. His personal performance was also splendid in the low scoring series as he captained the side very aggressively throughout the series. He was praised all over the world for his captaincy skills which he displayed during the 2nd ODI of this series. India was all out scoring 104 runs while batting first and Suresh Raina and his young team defended 104 runs and won the match by 54 runs. His captaincy was the deciding factor of this match along with Stuart Binny's bowling performance.\n\nRaina was signed by the Chennai Super Kings for US$650,000 for the first three years of the tournament. Raina made significant contributions in the first edition of the tournament to compensate the Chennai Super Kings over the losses of\nkey players like Matthew Hayden, Michael Hussey and Jacob Oram. He played a vital Man of the Match performance in the last league fixture to give Chennai Super Kings the win they required to qualify for the semi-finals. Ultimately the Super Kings finished\nAgain in 2010 IPL, Raina's consistent batting throughout the series won him applause and became the all-time run-getter of the league surpassing Australian legend Adam Gilchrist halfway down the tournament. He also captained the Super Kings for three matches in skipper Dhoni's absence and took some sensational catches in the field. He scored 520 runs in all, making him the third highest run-getter of the series and the first for Chennai. He also was awarded \"best fielder\" by the BCCI ahead of the finals. He played a vital half-century which turned the final to Chennai's tide who ultimately went on to become the champions beating the Mumbai Indians. For his performances in 2010, he was named in the Cricinfo IPL XI.\n\nAt the end of the season, Raina set the record for most runs scored in the tournament, with 421, 434, and 520 and also taking the most no. of catches, two records that are still unbroken. Raina also hit the second maximum no. of sixes behind Adam Gilchrist in the three editions of the league. He was retained by the Super Kings for the 2011 Indian Premier League along with Murali Vijay, Albie Morkel and skipper MS Dhoni.\n\nIn the 2011 IPL too, Raina maintained his reputation as the leading run-scorer with 438 runs, again being the only player to cross 400 do so for all the seven seasons. His most crucial knock came against the Royal Challengers Bangalore in the Qualifier where he played a stunning innings to get the game back to Chennai's favour.\n\nDespite struggling to find form in the initial stages of the 2012 IPL, Raina found form in the latter stages and finished the tournament as Chennai's leading run scorer, scoring 441 runs and on the course became the only player to score 400 runs in every IPL. He scored a blistering 73 in the final against Kolkata Knight Riders and added 116 with Mike Hussey, who scored a magnificent 86, to help his team put a big total on board. He became the first player in the history of IPL to cross the mark of 2000 IPL runs. For his performances in 2012, he was named in the Cricinfo IPL XI.\n\nIn 2013, IPL Raina scored 548 runs at a healthy average of 42.15 and strike rate of 150.13. At the start of the season he was struggling with his form but in the later half, he regained his form. He scored his maiden hundred in IPL against Kings XI Punjab. Raina scored an astonishing 99 not out off 52 deliveries against Sunrisers Hyderabad and helped Chennai Super Kings to score a mammoth 223 runs. This was Chennai Super Kings 3rd highest total. In the 1st Qualifier against MI he along with Hussey pounded MI bowlers to reach a score of 193 for 1. For his performances in 2013, he was named in the Cricinfo IPL XI.\n\nFor his performances in 2013, he was named in the Cricinfo CLT20 XI.\n\nOn 30 May 2014, he made 87 runs out of 25 balls against Kings XI Punjab. He missed the fastest century of the cricketing history by just 13 runs due to a runout. For his performances in 2014, he was named in the Cricinfo IPL XI. In Champions League Twenty20 final he played a blistering knock scoring 109* off just 62 balls and made Chennai Super Kings win the 2nd CLT20 title. For his performances in 2014, he was named in the Cricinfo CLT20 XI.\n\nIn 2016, Raina was signed for the Gujarat Lions after the suspension of CSK. He captained the team for the season, and remained consistent with batting, scoring 399 runs in 15 innings. Raina had to leave for the Netherlands in between of season 9 for birth of his first child thus making him miss his first ever match in nine seasons of IPL\n\nOn the occasion of the 10 year anniversary of IPL, he was also named in the all-time Cricinfo IPL XI.\n\nHe was named in the Cricbuzz IPL XI of the tournament for 2017.\n\nIn IPL 2018, Raina was retained by the returning Super Kings for a price tag of 11 crore ($1.7 million). During the second game of the tournament, Raina suffered a calf injury, due to which he was ruled out of the next two games. This was the first time Raina missed a CSK game. However, Raina returned after just one game.\n\nOn 23 March 2019, in the first match of the 12th edition of the tournament against RCB, he became the first batsman to score 5000 runs in the IPL.\n\nRaina was married to Priyanka on April 3, 2015, in a private ceremony. They were blessed with a daughter, Gracia Raina in 2016 and a son, Rio Raina, on 23rd March 2020.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2267622", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2267622", "title": "Victor Veselago", "text": "Victor Veselago\n\nVictor Georgievich Veselago (13 June 1929, Ukraine\n– 15 September 2018) was a Soviet/Russian physicist, doctor of physical and mathematical sciences, and a university professor. In 1967, he was the first to publish a theoretical analysis of materials with negative permittivity, ε, and permeability, μ.\n\nHe published his seminal work in a paper entitled \"\"The Electrodynamics of Substances with Simultaneously Negative Values of ε and μ\". \nIt was first published in Russian (1967), and was later translated into English (1968). His published paper was key to the advancement of physics research in electrodynamics and optics. It has been cited 4118 times by other scientific works, according to Cross ref and 12,978 times according to Google Scholar as of March 2020.\n\nThroughout his career he has received awards and has continued contributing to electrodynamics.\n\nIn the senior years of his high school he was an avid ham radio amateur. This hobby sparked an interest in the workings of electricity, and more generally, an interest in physics. Veselago enrolled in the Physico-Technical Department, of M.V. Lomonosov Moscow State University. This department had at that time was just recently opened at this University. He matriculated for four years there. These university years were the happiest time of his life.\n\nProfessor Mark Yefremovich Zhabotinsky supervised Veselago's project for his graduation diploma. This same professor also helped him to build a foundation in radio electronics and electrodynamics. Also, as a result of reading the book \"\"What is radio?\"\", which popularized the subject he became involved in the amateur field of Ham Radio. Veselago then studied under the author of the book, Professor Semen Emmanuilovich Khaikin, for three summers at the P N Lebedev FIAN Radioastronomy Station in Crimea. He also studied under Professor Sergei Mikhailovich Rytov, corresponding member of the USSR Academy of Sciences, who lectured on the theory of oscillations. These three professors have had a notable impact on Veselago.\n\nIt appears that the most significant event of his career, and the most important moment in his life was when he realized that materials with both negative permittivity and permeability are possible.\n\nHe is also on the advisory board of the peer reviewed journal \"Metamaterials\", along with a number of other notable board members who have significantly contributed to metamaterial research. The journal was first published in March, 2007.\n\nIn 2009, Victor Vesalgo won the C.E.K. Mees Medal from the Optical Society of America (OSA). The recipient is awarded this medal because he or she \"\"exemplifies the thought that 'optics transcends all boundaries,' interdisciplinary and international alike\".\"\n\nHis first paper was \"\"The Electrodynamics of Substances with Simultaneously Negative Values of ε and μ\"\". Up to this point, the refractive index was traditionally regarded as having only positive values. In this paper he was able to show that refractive index may also be negative. He hypothesized that negative refraction can occur if both the (electric) permittivity and the magnetic permeability of a material are negative. This prediction was confirmed 33 years later when David Smith et al., created a composite material with negative refractive index. Veselago also predicted a flat plate consisting of these materials will produce some curved lens properties. \nSir John Pendry demonstrated this prediction in the lab and noted greatly improved optical resolution. This it has been named the \"Veselago lens\".\n\nAfter Smith's and Pendry's accomplishments with metamaterials, Veselago realized that the most important contribution of his original paper is not that a composite material can be designed to produce a negative refraction, but that a composite material can be designed to produce any value for permittivity and permeability. At least a part of his research goals was then to critically reconsider all formulas of classical electrodynamics that involve permittivity, permeability or refractive index. The fact that prior research is based on positive values for these parameters leads to erroneous solutions when negative values are considered or researched. He stated that many of these formulas need to be corrected.\n\nVeselago perceived that the next big breakthrough with metamaterials will be the fabrication of transparent low-absorption metamaterials with negative refraction in the visible spectrum range.\n\nVictor Veselago attended Moscow University and graduated from there in 1952. He received his PhD in 1959 for investigation of molecular spectra with radiospectropy. He later received a Doctor of Science degree in Solid State Physics in 1974 for his investigation of solid states in magnetic fields. His doctorate and Doctor of Science degree were both achieved at the P.N. Lebedev Physical Institute, where he worked (see \"Career\" section below).\n\nAfter graduating Moscow University in 1952, he went to work with the P.N. Lebedev Physical Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences in Moscow. He was there from 1952 to 1983. In 1983 he became \"Head of Laboratory of Magnetic Materials\" in the \"Lebedev Physical Institute\". As of July 2010, he is still listed in this position.\n\nIn 1980 he became a professor of applied physics for the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology. As of 2007, he had maintained this position. Moreover, he has been noted to be mainly interested in the sciences of magnetism, solid-state physics, and electrodynamics.\n\nBesides notable work establishing and publishing the theory of negative refraction in electrodynamics from 1966 to 1972 he is a winner of the State Prize for science of USSR (1976), and a winner of the academician V.A. Fock prize (2004), and an Honored Scientist of the Russian Federation(2002). In 2011, Professor Victor G. Veselago was nominated for Nobel Prize. Currently (2007), he is actively involved as an expert for the Russian Foundation for Fundamental Research, the Russian Foundation for Humanitarian Research, and he is the vice-chairman of the physics department of the Supreme Attestation Committee of Russia (VAK). He is a founder and vice-editor of the electronic, Russian scientific journal \"Исследовано в России\", for which the English translation is \"Investigated in Russia\".\n\nV. Veselago is married and has three daughters along with one son. His favorite animal is a female cat named Fifa. His notable hobby is real railways, not hobby sets.\n\n\n\n"}

During his career, he coached the Minnesota Timberwolves, Detroit Pistons, and Washington Wizards.\n\nSaunders was born in Cleveland, Ohio. He was an All-state basketball player at Cuyahoga Heights High School in suburban Cleveland. In his senior season, 1973, he was named Ohio's Class A High School Basketball Player of the Year, leading the state in scoring average with 32.0 points per game. At the University of Minnesota, he started 101 of his 103 career contests and as a senior, teamed with Ray Williams, Mychal Thompson, Kevin McHale, and Osborne Lockhart.\n\nSaunders began his coaching career at Golden Valley Lutheran College where he compiled a 92–13 record, including a perfect 56–0 mark at home, in four seasons. In 1981, he became an assistant coach at his alma mater, Minnesota, and helped guide the Golden Gophers to the Big Ten championship that season. After five seasons at Minnesota, he became an assistant coach at the University of Tulsa where he worked for two seasons before heading to the pro ranks.\n\nSaunders became the coach of the Rapid City Thrillers of the Continental Basketball Association (CBA) in the 1988–89 season, where future Kings and Warriors head coach Eric Musselman served as the team's general manager. Musselman's father, Bill Musselman, had recruited Flip when Bill was head coach at the University of Minnesota.\n\nSaunders then later moved to the La Crosse Catbirds for five seasons (1989–94), where he won two CBA Championships, before coaching in 1994–95 with the Sioux Falls Skyforce. He also served as general manager (1991–93) and team president (1991–94) of the Catbirds. Saunders' impressive CBA tenure included seven consecutive seasons of 30 or more victories, two CBA championships (1990, 1992), two CBA Coach of the Year honors (1989, 1992) and 23 CBA-to-NBA player promotions.\n\nSaunders would leave after seven productive seasons as a head coach in the CBA, where he ranks second with 253 career victories.\n\nSaunders joined the Minnesota Timberwolves of the National Basketball Association (NBA) on May 11, 1995 as general manager, working under his former Minnesota teammate, Kevin McHale. On December 18, 1995, Saunders was named head coach of the Timberwolves, replacing Bill Blair.\n\nThis happened shortly after McHale had taken over the basketball operations for the Timberwolves. He then added the coaching duties to his GM responsibilities after the team had gotten off to a 6–14 start. The Timberwolves went 20–42 the rest of the year, but the emergence of young Kevin Garnett as a front-line NBA player was a huge plus over the second half of the season.\n\nHe guided with difficulty the Timberwolves to their first-ever playoff berth in the 1996–97 season, his first full season as an NBA head coach. A year later, he led the Timberwolves to their first-ever winning season. They went on to a franchise-record 50 victories in 1999–2000 which was duplicated in 2001–2002.\n\nAfter the Timberwolves' success in the 2003–04 NBA season, in which they won their first (and to date, only) division title and advanced to the Western Conference Finals, they struggled in the 2004–05 season. On February 12, 2005, McHale fired Saunders and named himself head coach for the rest of the season. McHale was unable to right the ship, and the Wolves missed the playoffs for the first time in nine years. Many fans believed that Saunders' firing was unwarranted, citing instead the contract troubles of Sam Cassell and Latrell Sprewell as the reasons for the team's failure. However, many also acknowledged that Saunders had coached ten years in Minnesota, and perhaps a new voice was needed.\n\nSaunders replaced Larry Brown as coach of the Detroit Pistons on July 21, 2005. Under Saunders, the team set a new franchise record for wins during the regular season, finishing with a 64–18 record. Saunders coached the Eastern Conference All-Stars in the 2006 NBA All-Star Game in Houston, Texas.\n\nSaunders led the Pistons to three consecutive Central Division titles and three consecutive appearances in the Eastern Conference Finals. Upon entering his third season as Pistons coach, Saunders became the longest-tenured Pistons coach since Chuck Daly's nine-year tenure (1983–1992).\n\nSaunders was fired June 3, 2008 after the Pistons lost to the Boston Celtics in the 2008 Eastern Conference Finals; Detroit president of basketball operations Joe Dumars said the team needed a \"new voice\".\n\nOn April 14, 2009, Saunders reached an agreement to become the new coach of the Washington Wizards. The deal was reportedly worth $18 million over 4 years.\n\nOn January 24, 2012, Saunders was fired as the coach of the Wizards. Replaced by former Minnesota Timberwolves head coach Randy Wittman, Saunders departed the Wizards with a record of 51–130.\n\nOn June 6, 2014, Saunders was named the head coach of the Minnesota Timberwolves, returning to the franchise for a second stint. During his second stint with the Timberwolves, Saunders was diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma. During his recovery, he delegated his coaching position to assistant coach and former NBA Coach of the Year winner Sam Mitchell. His 427 wins during parts of ten seasons in two stints are far and away the most in franchise history and, until the 2017–18 season, he was the only coach to lead the Timberwolves to a winning season or coach a playoff game.\n\nOn April 29, 2012, Saunders joined the Boston Celtics as an advisor.\n\nOn May 3, 2013, Saunders was named the Timberwolves' President of Basketball Operations. On June 5, 2014, Saunders was named head coach as well. During his recovery from Hodgkin's Lymphoma, he delegated his duties within the front office to the team's general manager Milt Newton.\n\nSaunders and his wife Debbie had four children. Their son, Ryan, was a 6-foot-1 guard for the University of Minnesota, Flip's alma mater, and later became an NBA assistant coach for the Wizards and Wolves, and the head coach of the Wolves. His daughter, Mindy also attended the University of Minnesota and was a member of the dance team. Flip's twin daughters, Kim and Rachel, also attended the University of Minnesota. Together, they danced on the University of Minnesota Dance Team for 4 years - winning 8 national championships and a World Championship.\n\nAccording to Saunders, he was about (60 feet) away from the I-35W Mississippi River bridge collapse on August 1, 2007 in Minneapolis.\n\nOn August 11, 2015, Saunders announced he had been diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma, for which he was undergoing treatment. Saunders planned to remain the Timberwolves' head coach and president. However, after Saunders was hospitalized for more than a month following complications in September, team owner Glen Taylor announced that Saunders would miss the next season. Saunders died on October 25, 2015 at the age of 60. On February 15, 2018, the Timberwolves held a \"Flip Saunders Night\" during which a permanent banner was unveiled in the Target Center honoring Saunders. A little over three years after his death, Flip's son Ryan Saunders took over as the Timberwolves' head coach following the firing of Tom Thibodeau.\n\nOn January 4, 2020, the south gymnasium at Cuyahoga Heights High School in Cuyahoga Heights, Ohio was renamed in Flip's honor. The event was attended by Flip's wife Debbie Saunders, Flip's son and current Minnesota Timberwolves head coach Ryan Saunders, other members of the Saunders' family as well as by the entire 2020 Minnesota Timberwolves basketball team.\n\nSource:\n\n"}

Quine also directed Lemmon in \"My Sister Eileen\", \"It Happened to Jane\", \"Operation Mad Ball\", \"The Notorious Landlady\" and \"Bell, Book and Candle\".\n\nThe comic strip art featured in the film was credited to Mel Keefer, who drew newspaper comic strips such as \"Perry Mason\", \"Mac Divot\" and \"Rick O'Shay\". Comics artist Alex Toth did a teaser comic strip in Keefer's style that ran in \"The Hollywood Reporter\" and in several newspapers promoting the film for ten days prior to its theatrical opening.\n\nStanley Ford (Jack Lemmon) is a newspaper cartoonist enjoying the comforts of a well-to-do and happy bachelorhood in his urban New York City town house, including his loyal and attentive valet, Charles Firbank (Terry-Thomas). Stanley's comic strip, \"Bash Brannigan\", is a secret-agent thriller characterized by a high level of realism; no matter how outrageous the plot, Stanley will not allow Brannigan to do anything physically impossible or use gadgets that don't exist. He hires actors and sets up elaborate enactments of storylines, playing Brannigan himself, while Charles takes photographs that Stanley will use as visual references when drawing each strip.\n\nWhile attending a bachelor party for his friend Tobey Rawlins (Max Showalter), Stanley becomes very drunk and later marries a beautiful Italian woman (Virna Lisi), who earlier had stepped out of a large cake wearing a whipped cream bikini. An equally drunken judge (Sidney Blackmer) performed the impromptu wedding and the following morning, Stanley wakes up next to his naked wife. He asks his lawyer Harold Lampson (Eddie Mayehoff) to arrange a divorce but Lampson says this is impossible without legal justification.\n\nStanley's new bride is cheerful, affectionate and sexy, but does not speak English. To learn the language, she spends time with Harold's manipulative, hen-pecking wife Edna (Claire Trevor), who speaks Italian. Unfortunately, in the process, she also learns Edna's ways. Charles, who has a policy of not working for married couples, takes a new job with Rawlins, who was jilted by his bride. With his valet now replaced by his wife, Stanley's bathroom fills with beauty products and lingerie and he is kept awake at night by television, which his wife watches to improve her English. Her high-calorie Italian cooking causes his weight to balloon and she announces that her mother will be coming from Rome to live with them.\n\nAdjusting to his marital status, Stanley changes his \"Bash Brannigan\" comic strip from the exploits of a secret agent to a household comedy, \"The Brannigans\", again drawing from his real life. The comic strip turns Bash into a bumbling idiot and becomes wildly popular with the public. His wife continues to alter Stanley's lifestyle. Increasingly irritated by the restrictions of married life, Stanley calls a meeting of his associates at his all-male health club. When Edna learns of the meeting, she telephones Mrs. Ford and arouses her suspicions about Stanley's activities. Mrs. Ford sneaks into the club, resulting in Stanley being banned for violating its \"no women\" policy.\n\nStanley concocts a plot in his comic strip to kill Brannigan's wife. He drugs her with \"goofballs\" and buries her alive in \"the goop from the gloppitta-gloppitta machine\" at the construction site next to their home, so that Brannigan can resume his career as a secret agent. As always, he enacts the events live before drawing the strip, again with the help of his old valet Charles Firbank. After drugging his wife during a wild cocktail party, Stanley carries her up to bed, then switches to a department-store mannequin to play out the burial in concrete.\n\nMrs. Ford comes to, sees the finished comic strip describing Stanley's murder plan and concludes that her husband does not love her. While Stanley sleeps, she leaves, taking nothing with her. After reading \"The Brannigans\" strip in the newspapers and recognizing that Mrs. Ford has disappeared without a trace, the district attorney and police decide that Stanley must have murdered his wife. Stanley is arrested, charged with murder and his comic strips are used as prosecution evidence at the trial. When it appears that a conviction is likely, Stanley takes up his own defense and pleads justifiable homicide, appealing to the all-male jury's frustrations regarding their own wives. He is acquitted unanimously; the men in the courtroom applaud and carry Stanley out on their shoulders. to the consternation of women left sitting inside.\n\nWhen Stanley returns home, accompanied by a joyful Charles, it is immediately clear that his wife has returned and is in their bedroom. His valet reminds him that killing her now would not have any legal consequences; since Stanley has already been acquitted of her murder, trying him again would constitute double jeopardy. In his time without her Stanley came to realize that he loves his wife and when he enters their room he finds her in bed waiting for him. After putting her wedding ring back on her finger, they are reconciled. Charles meets Mrs. Ford's attractive mother; she has come from Rome (her daughter had run home to her) and is in the process of settling in to the Ford household. Like Charles, she has a prominent diastema (a space or gap between two teeth). Charles closes the door to her room so they can share an amorous moment alone.\n\n\nThe music was composed by Neal Hefti.\n\n\n\n"}

It connects the Irish Sea with the Atlantic Ocean, and is part of the marine area officially classified as the \"Inner Seas off the West Coast of Scotland\" by the International Hydrographic Organization (IHO).\nThe Straits of Moyle (\"Sruth na Maoile\" in Irish and Scottish Gaelic) or Sea of Moyle is the name given to the narrowest expanse of sea in the North Channel between northeastern Northern Ireland (County Antrim) and southwestern highlands of Scotland (Mull of Kintyre). The distance between the two shores is approximately at its closest point, and thus it is possible to see across in clear weather conditions. The Straits gave their name to Moyle District Council, a local government area in Northern Ireland, and are famed in Irish Celtic Mythology through their association with the Children of Lir.\n\nThis strait was formerly known as the Irish Channel. In the 19th century, Alexander Keith Johnston's suggested name St Patrick's Channel had currency, but it was rejected by the hydrographic department.\n\nThe southern boundary of the strait is a line joining the Mull of Galloway and Ballyquintin Point. The northern boundary is a line joining Portnahaven and Benbane Head. The narrowest part of the strait is between the Mull of Kintyre and Torr Head where its width is . The deepest part is called Beaufort's Dyke.\n\nThe Channel was a favourite haunt of privateers preying on British merchant shipping in wars until the 19th century; in 1778, during the American Revolutionary War it was also the site of a naval duel between American captain John Paul Jones's \"Ranger\" and the Royal Navy's \"Drake\". It is crossed by many ferry services. In 1953, it was the scene of a serious maritime disaster, the sinking of the ferry \"Princess Victoria\".\n\nIn Northern Ireland, Unionist political leaders for decades lobbied the British government to construct a railway tunnel under the Channel, to better link Northern Ireland with the rest of the United Kingdom. In August 2007 the Centre for Cross-Border Studies proposed the construction of a long rail bridge or tunnel, estimating that it might cost about £3.5 billion. In the Victorian era, engineers proposed a rail tunnel between Stranraer and Belfast.\n\nThe Irish Long Distance Swimming Association (ILDSA) has provided authentication observers for swimmers attempting to cross the approximately span between Northern Ireland and the Mull of Galloway. According to the ILDSA, this was first accomplished in 1947 by Tom Blower. The first two-way crossing was completed by a six-person relay team on 28 July 2015.\n\nThe North Channel is part of the Ocean's seven, a set of seven long-distance open-water swims considered the marathon swimming equivalent of the Seven Summits mountaineering challenge. \n\nIn February 2020, the Prime Minister's Office announced that it had initiated work to examine the feasibility of bridge between Scotland and Northern Ireland. The shortest route coast to coast is that between Campbeltown on the Kintyre peninsula (about from Glasgow via minor roads) and Ballycastle, County Antrim (about from Belfast). The shortest route between Glasgow and Belfast is the route used by the existing ferry service, that via Portpatrick/Stranraer (about from Glasgow) and Larne (about from Belfast), a coast-to-coast distance of . This route would require the bridge towers to be erected through Beaufort's Dyke, a deep trench, heavily contaminated by 'large quantities' of munitions ('small arms, high explosives and incendiary devices').\n\nFirst Minister of Scotland Nicola Sturgeon said her mind was not closed to the idea but added \"if he [the prime minister] has got £20bn to build such a bridge going spare at the moment - that could be spent on more important priorities\".\n\n\n"}

He debuted on the independent circuit in 1991.\n\nIn late 1992, Ragni joined the Philadelphia, Pennsylvania-based promotion Eastern Championship Wrestling, where he adopted the ring name \"E.Z. Ryder\" and formed a tag team known as \"The Hell Riders\" with H.D. Ryder. On the inaugural episode of \"ECW Hardcore TV\" (airing April 3, 1993 on SportsChannel Philadelphia), The Hell Riders unsuccessfully challenged The Super Destroyers for the ECW Tag Team Championship. Ragni left ECW in late 1993.\n\nAfter leaving ECW, Ragni briefly toured the Mid-Atlantic states before joining the Newark, Delaware-based East Coast Wrestling Association, where he wrestled as \"Hell Rider\".\n\nIn mid-1995, Ragni returned to Eastern Championship Wrestling, which had been renamed Extreme Championship Wrestling in 1994. He was given the gimmick of \"Chubby Dudley\", an obese, slobbish member of the Dudley family.

In the story, the teens are asked to pay a certain amount of money (anywhere from 20-100 dollars) and told they will receive a portion back for every floor they complete. The twist is that no one has ever completed the house, and the ones who tried never came back out. Rumors state about the various horrors inside the house, from poisonous/deadly animals, to deformed humans, to the supernatural. Accounts vary as to the exact number of floors in the house, but most accounts give the house 13 floors.\n\nThe legend is usually set in the south or midwest since there are a large amount of open and unknown areas in those parts. The editor of Haunted Attraction Magazine believes the urban legend originally started in Kansas City while others have suggested that the legend was also inspired by real haunted attractions like Britannia Manor and Raven's Grin Inn. Although the Chimera House has never been proven to exist, some people still search fervently for it and several haunted attractions are asked if they are the infamous 13 floor haunted house every October. \n\nThe legend of the Chimera House has been fueled by both hoaxes and several haunted attractions have tried to cash in on the legend by offering refunds if certain conditions are met. The anthology \"Haunted Houses\" edited by Robert D. San Souci contains a short story inspired by the legend called \"Chimera House,\" in which several inner-city kids are led to the infamous haunted attraction.\n\n\n"}

The cassettes were later made available as bootlegs, some songs saw official releases, and the tapes were released in their entirety in 2018. \"Girly-Sound\" is also the name used to refer to the demos or bootlegs collectively. The recordings have been called \"legendary\" by Spin Magazine and by AllMusic \"one of the most popular and sought-after alternative rock bootlegs of all time\".\n\nRecorded on a 4-track tape recorder in her childhood bedroom at her parents' house, copies of the tapes were initially given by Phair to only two people: Chris Brokaw and Tae Won Yu. However, copies of the \"Girly-Sound\" tapes were passed from person to person and became somewhat of a sensation in the American tape trading/zine subculture. Brokaw later told \"Rolling Stone\" how he had urged Phair to record something and a few months later received one 14-song tape, getting the second 14-song tape a month after that. In 1992, Phair signed a deal with Matador Records on the strength of a tape she had sent in consisting of 6 Girly-Sound songs.\n\nPhair has frequently gone back and reworked many of the songs for her studio albums throughout her career: she told \"Rolling Stone\" \"I go in there and rip stuff off – it's like a library\". Much of Phair's debut album \"Exile in Guyville\" contains reworkings of songs from these tapes. However, the content of some of these tracks was modified in ways that altered meanings and messages; in \"Flower\" the line \"I’ll fuck you and your girlfriend, too\" was changed to \"I’ll fuck you and your minions, too.\" In addition to this, the final chorus of \"Bomb\" which tells of a passenger on a plane sabotaging and taking it out was entirely removed; the title of the song was changed to \"Stratford-on-Guy\" and a new chorus was written. Reworkings of \"Ant in Alaska\" and \"Wild Thing\" appeared on the 2008 reissue of \"Exile in Guyville\".\n\nFive songs were officially released in 1995 on the \"Juvenilia EP\" and a bonus disc of ten Girly-Sound songs was included with the physical release of Phair's 2010 album \"Funstyle\".\n\nAlthough originally consisting of a total of three cassettes, the most common version of the \"Girly-Sound\" tapes that circulated among Phair's fans was an incomplete two-disc compilation of songs from all three tapes, released on the Bliss and Fetish bootleg label, and processed with harsh digital noise reduction. An earlier bootleg compilation of \"Girly-Sound\" material, \"Secretly Timid\", was also circulated. Early in 2006, mp3s of first-generation copies of the first two tapes were introduced via Phair's online community, bringing to light the original track listing, correct song names, tape titles, and introducing a number of songs that did not appear on the previous \"Girly-Sound\" bootlegs. Information about the third \"Girly-Sound\" tape, \"Sooty\", was elusive until the 2018 release of \"Girly-Sound to Guyville\", in which it was presented in its entirety.\n\nIn 2018, for the 25th anniversary of its original release, Matador Records released a repackaged edition of \"Exile in Guyville\" called \"Girly-Sound to Guyville\" which included remastered versions of all three Girly-Sound tapes. At the same time, the tapes themselves were separately released digitally under the title \"The Girly-Sound Tapes\". This release omitted \"Fuck or Die\" and \"Shatter\" due to sample clearance issues.\n\nAllMusic rated the demos 4.5/5, noting some weak tracks but finding others \"as tuneful and provoking as anything on her official albums\".\n\nTrack order was obtained from the 2018 \"Girly-Sound to Guyville\" release.\n\n\n\n"}

It was founded in 1996 by Dave Meltzer, editor of the tabloid, the \"Wrestling Observer Newsletter\". Like many other wrestling halls of fame, such as the WWE, Impact, and WCW hall of fames, the Wrestling Observer Newsletter Hall of Fame is not contained in a building, and there are no ceremonies for inductions other than a highly detailed biographical documentation of their career in the tabloid. Inductees include wrestlers/fighters, managers, promoters, trainers, and commentators. On eight occasions, tag teams have been inducted rather than the individual members of the team. This first occurred in 1996, when The Dusek family, The Fabulous Kangaroos, and The Road Warriors entered the hall. The Fabulous Freebirds, The Midnight Express, The Rock 'n' Roll Express, The Assassins and The Sharpe Brothers have also been inducted as a group.\n\nMeltzer began the Hall of Fame by choosing a list of 122 inaugural inductees in 1996. Since then, wrestlers from past and present, others employed in the professional wrestling industry, and wrestling journalists and historians have been selected by Meltzer to cast secret ballots to determine annual groups of inductees. Voting criteria include the length of time spent in wrestling, historical significance, ability to attract viewers, and wrestling ability. Inductees must have at least 15 years of experience in the wrestling business or be over 35 years old and have 10 years of experience. To gain membership in the hall, potential inductees must receive 60% support on the ballots from their geographic region. Any person that gets less than 10% of the vote is eliminated from the ballot. If a person fails to get inducted 15 years after being put on the ballot, they must get 50% of the vote or be eliminated. There are 223 inductees, including the eight tag teams.\n\nIn 2008, a recall vote was held asking if 2003 inductee Chris Benoit, who killed his wife and son before committing suicide in June 2007, should remain in the hall. To have Benoit removed, Meltzer required that 60% of voters must agree with the proposal. Although the majority voted for Benoit's removal, they only represented 53.6% of the votes, falling short of the number required. Benoit remains on the list of inductees.\n\n"}

Operated by the Mohegan Tribe, it is located on of reservation land along the banks of the Thames River in Uncasville, Connecticut. It is in the foothills of southeastern Connecticut, where 60 percent of the state's tourism is concentrated. It features the 12,000-seat capacity Mohegan Sun Arena, home of the New England Black Wolves of the National Lacrosse League and the Women's National Basketball Association's Connecticut Sun. It houses a 350-seat Cabaret Theatre, the 300-seat Wolf Den, and of meeting and function room space, including the Northeast’s largest ballroom and of retail shopping. It is also where the studio of WMOS is located.\n\nThe casino contains slot machines, gaming tables including poker, blackjack, craps, roulette, Caribbean stud poker, keno and baccarat. The race book offers live horse or greyhound racing from around the U.S. as well as from Australia and England. It also offers wagering on jai-alai from Florida.\n\nThe economic recession that began in 2007 took a heavy toll on receipts, and by 2012 both the Mohegan Sun and nearby competitor Foxwoods Resort Casino were deeply in debt.\n\nAt the end of the 2018 fiscal year, Mohegan Sun's net revenue was $1.07 billion.\n\nThe development of the Mohegan Sun began in 1992 with RJH Development and LMW Investments of Connecticut, and Slavik Suites Inc. proposed the idea of developing a casino with the Mohegan tribe. The three companies formed Trading Cove Associates (TCA), which provided the Mohegans with financial support, tribal attorneys, and advisers to assist in the tribe's effort to gain official recognition as a people. In March 1994 they gained federal recognition as a sovereign people, opening the way to develop a casino. The land, formerly used by United Nuclear Corporation building nuclear reactors for submarines, was decommissioned and cleaned up. Sol Kerzner, head of Kerzner International (formerly Sun International), became involved with a 50 percent interest in TCA. Waterford Gaming had the other 50 percent interest in TCA. The Mohegan Tribal Gaming Authority (MTGA) hired TCA to oversee development and construction of the casino.\n\nThe casino and resort first opened on October 12, 1996. In 2000, Trading Cove Associates gave complete control of the resort to the Mohegan tribe, although under the terms of the agreement TCA continued to receive a 5% dividend on the gross revenue generated by Mohegan Sun until 2014.\n\nIn 2012, Mohegan Sun table games dealers attempted to unionize through an affiliation with United Auto Workers (UAW), which represents dealers at Foxwoods Resort Casino. While the Mohegan Chief of Staff Chuck Bunnell later stated that tribal law allowed and created regulations for organizing, the UAW Region 9A Director sent a letter to eastern Connecticut elected officials, detailing efforts to unionize and asking for a signed letter of support. Shortly after, a letter was sent out by Mohegan Sun Connecticut President and CEO Jeff Hartmann and Mohegan Tribal Chairman Bruce “Two Dogs” Bozsum, telling employees that unions were not in their best interest, and a union would violate trust with management. The effort did not amount to unionization, with the international representative of the UAW, Karen Rosenberg, later stating, “The Mohegan Sun discouraged them from unionization and was successful,”\n\n\nThe gaming floor has 6,500 slot machines, 377 table games as well as a racebook.\n\nThe table games at Mohegan Sun range from 116 blackjack tables, craps, roulette, baccarat, and 3-card poker. They also offer video game blackjack, craps, and roulette.\n\nMohegan Sun employs around 8,000 local employees, bringing in $1.07 billion in revenues in 2018. Concerts and boxing events bring further temporary employment and revenues. The casino also submits about 25% of its revenues from slot machines to the State of Connecticut. However, this impact has not been without costs to the tribe and local communities. The Mohegan Tribe is $1.6 billion in debt while local communities have complained about increased local costs for services associated with casino-related traffic, crime and social welfare service demands.\n\nIn November 2006, the tribe announced a $740 million expansion titled Project Horizon. The project was originally scheduled to be completed in 2010, with phases of the expansion being completed prior to that. The expansion included the \"Casino of the Wind,\" which opened in August 2008 and features 650 slot machines, 28 table games, and 42-table poker room. It would have also added 1,000 new hotel rooms, including 300 House of Blues themed rooms, accessible through a separate lobby. However, in September 2008, Mohegan Sun placed the Project Horizon expansion on hold, due to the economic recession affecting the regional gaming markets. The feasibility of the expansion would be reevaluated within a year. However, in 2010, the tribe had a $58.1 million impairment charge which halted any work on the project. Project Horizon was eventually terminated.\n\nIn May 2011, Mohegan Sun announced that the casino would be expanded by building a new 300- to 500-room hotel. The expansion would accommodate the growing demand of hotel rooms at the casino. The Mohegans would let a third-party developer construct and own the new facility, unlike the existing hotel which is owned and operated by the Mohegan Tribal Gaming Authority. However, ground was never broken on the project.\n\nExpansion plans were once again announced on June 24, 2013 for a $50 million, 200,000-square foot \"Downtown District,\" to be built next to the Uncasville casino's Winter Garage, featuring a New England-themed food pavilion; a 14-screen Marquee Cinemas multiplex; an upscale bowling-and-dining facility; and a promenade of retail shops whose tenants will include Coach, Tiffany, Sephora, Tommy Bahama, Puma and others. On July 28, 2014, Mohegan Sun announced it expected to break ground by the end of the year on a $110 million, 400-room hotel at Mohegan Sun. The hotel would be financed and built by a third-party developer and then leased back to Mohegan Sun to operate. Construction was due to start by the end of the year and be opened 18–20 months afterward. It also reported plans to add a $50 million nongaming “Downtown District” addition to the casino were advancing. The project would be owned and operated by the developers.\n\nOn November 18, 2016, Mohegan Sun opened The Earth Tower, a $139 million hotel which was the second at Mohegan Sun. The 400-room, 242,000 square foot hotel would be connected to the Casino of the Earth.\n\nOn January 25, 2005, Mohegan Sun acquired its first gaming venture outside of Connecticut with its $280 million purchase of the Pocono Downs Racetrack in Plains Township, Pennsylvania from Penn National Gaming. Mohegan Sun renamed the property \"Mohegan Sun at Pocono Downs\" and began a major expansion. Operation as the first slots casino in the state of Pennsylvania commenced in November 2006.\n\nOn August 2, 2007, the Mohegan Tribal Gaming Authority purchased of land in the town of Palmer, Massachusetts, a town in eastern Hampden County, with about 12,000 residents. The land is directly off of exit 8 of the Massachusetts Turnpike. At the time, they had plans to build a retail center and it was unknown if a casino or any type of gaming would be allowed to occur. A month later on September 17, 2007, Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick unveiled a proposal to license three full-scale casinos in the state in a bidding process. The locations would be in the western, southeastern, and Boston area of the state. Both the Massachusetts House of Representatives and Senate passed legislation to allow casinos in the state, but Governor Patrick refused to sign the legislation due to his objections to allowing slot machines at race tracks. Prospects for legalizing casinos in the state were on hold until after the next legislative session began in January 2011. In June 2011, House Speaker Robert A. DeLeo said that a bill to legalize casinos would be taken up by state legislators in July pending the outcome of talks with Governor Patrick. In November 2011, Patrick signed the bill allowing three full-scale casinos and one slot machine parlor in the state.\n\nThe Palmer casino plans were put in limbo after voters rejected the proposal for a $1 billion casino by a 93-vote margin. A recount of the 5221 votes cast on November 26, 2013 affirmed the rejection by an additional vote resulting in a 94-vote margin. The Quaboag Hills Chamber of Commerce endorsed the destination resort project and the economic benefits for the region.\n\nMohegan Sun is also competing for a license to develop and operate a casino resort near Boston at the Suffolk Downs racetrack. The plans called for about 4,000 slot machines, 100 table games, and a poker room on a 42-acre piece of land in the Revere-side of the property. A referendum in Revere to approve a revised host community agreement for the proposal was passed on February 25, 2014 after the first proposed agreement for a plan that straddled the border of two communities was rejected by one — East Boston — and approved by the other — Revere. A deal was then made with Boston Mayor Martin Walsh to pay $75 million in capital improvements to East Boston and Boston and $18 million a year in payments to the city should Mohegan get the license. The final outcome depends on firstly - the Massachusetts Gaming Commission decision on September 12, 2014, for which site - Mohegan Sun, Revere or Wynn Resorts, Everett - will be issued a license, and secondly, a statewide referendum on the November 2014 ballot attempting to overturn the 2011 law allowing casino gambling in Massachusetts.\n\nIn May 2011, Mohegan Sun announced plans to expand into New York with a casino in the Catskills.

The film was directed by George Cukor, and partly filmed on location in New York City. Screenwriter Garson Kanin originally intended the script as a vehicle for Danny Kaye, but Kanin's wife, Ruth Gordon, suggested casting Judy Holliday instead. The title was initially \"A Name for Herself\".\n\nLemmon had a contentious meeting with studio boss Harry Cohn, who feared that critics might use jokes about the name \"Lemmon\" in headlines panning the film. He wanted Lemmon to change his name. Lemmon countered that if he did that, people might confuse his name with \"Lenin\" and associate his name with communism, a very real concern in the 1950s.\n\nThe script, by Garson Kanin, is about an apparently naive young woman named Gladys Glover, who yearns for fame. Strolling through Central Park, she meets a young handsome man named Pete Sheppard (Jack Lemmon). He is a maker of documentaries (apparently equipped only with a handheld 16mm camera). He is taking brief shots of people in the park. He films Gladys feeding pigeons, and introduces himself.\n\nIn a rapid piece of exposition, we learn Gladys has been in New York City for two years, coming from a job at a shoe factory in Binghamton, New York. She has just lost her job as a model of girdles, because her hip size is 3/4\" larger than it should be, and still has the $1000, which she \"saved up.\" Gladys is discouraged at having gotten nowhere in two years and she wants to make a name for herself. It is clear Pete is taken by Gladys. He gets her address by offering to drop her a postcard when the documentary is finished so she can see herself in it. \"Really?\" she says, \"I'd give my right arm to see myself in the movies.\" \"You don't need to give me your right arm,\" says Pete, \"just give me your right address.\" Pete encourages Gladys to follow her dreams: \"Where there's a will there's a way, and where there's a way there is a will.\" The two then part ways.\n\nWandering despondently, Gladys' attention is caught by a large billboard overlooking Columbus Circle with the notice, \"This space for rent. Choice location. Inquire Horace Pfeiffer Co, 383 Madison Avenue.\" She fantasizes about her name being on the billboard and gathering up the nerve she goes to 383 Madison Avenue to inquire about the billboard. Gladys asks for \"Mr. Horace Puh-feiffer,\" pronouncing the letter P, and is corrected by the receptionist who tells her there is no Mr. Pfeiffer. Determined, Gladys obtains an interview with a busy man conducting a telephone conversation, who brusquely tells her the sign is available, demands to know \"whom she represents,\" and says \"I'm really too busy for this sort of thing.\" The spunky Gladys pulls $1000 in cash from her purse, complains that the man is too \"stuck up\" to listen to her, asks \"What sort of place treats people that way\" and starts to leave. The representative relents and tells her the sign is $210 per month, three months minimum. Gladys pays $630 in cash and arranges to have her name put on the billboard.\n\nWithin a few days the sign is up and she is thrilled. However, it turns out the Adams Soap company has traditionally booked the sign and is upset to learn that another client has obtained it. The Pfeiffer company calls Gladys to a meeting where Evan Adams III (Lawford) attempts to induce her to give up the sign by offering her more money. Gladys is not interested. She is called to another meeting and is offered six signs in exchange for the one. This time, she accepts. Now, there are six huge signs in New York, one in lights, each saying simply \"Gladys Glover.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Pete Sheppard has taken an apartment adjacent to Gladys, a move which does not seem to rouse her curiosity, and the two become platonic friends. Sheppard is, however, exasperated by Gladys' fascination with her signs and her requests he tour the city with her to see them. Citygoers are intrigued by the mysterious signs. Gladys shops in Macy's department store, and when she gives her name, the word spreads quickly and dozens of people flock around to get the autograph of the famous Gladys Glover.\n\nSoon, she is being asked to appear on television shows. However, the round of publicity begins to take an unpleasant turn. Gladys explains she obtained the signs simply in order to, \"Make a name for herself,\" but does not seem to be aware she is being treated as a figure of fun. Evan Adams III, however, decides she is ripe for exploitation as, \"The average American girl,\" and hires her to do a series of advertisements for Adams Soap. As Gladys pursues what is becoming a lucrative career, relations between her and Pete become strained. At the same time, Adams is showing an increasing interest in her. The situation reaches a crisis when Gladys breaks a date with Pete and his parents in order to attend what Adams says is a business conference to discuss a cross-country publicity tour. The conference turns out to be an attempted seduction. As Adams reaches to embrace Gladys, she spills a full glass of champagne down the back his neck, breaking the spell. Gladys says, \"I don't mind the way you're acting, exactly. What I mind is the way you give the idea you're sort of \"entitled.\"\" Adam then says, \"Maybe I am. Oh, sure, if you want to make it into a sort of business proposition. That's what you're doing, isn't it?\" Gladys says, \"The way it looks to me, Mr. Adams, is that there are two sorts of people. The people who will do anything to make a name for themselves, and the people who will do almost anything. Soon there will be signs all over saying I'm the average American girl. That was your idea wasn't it? Well, I don't think the average American girl should do... \"this\"\" then Gladys walks out.\n\nWhen she arrives home she finds a 16 mm movie projector in her room with a note from Pete telling her to run it. A film plays complete with titles and synchronized sound, entitled \"Goodby, [sic] Gladys.\" The charmingly self-deprecating Pete confesses he loves Gladys, acknowledges that his profile is not as good looking as Adams', and says goodbye.\n\nGladys' advertising career continues, but she finds its emptiness more and more frustrating. She recalls Pete's frequent questions as to why she wants to be above the crowd instead of being happy being part of the crowd.\n\nIn the meantime, Pete continues to make a go of his documentary film career. In a cage at a zoo, he makes a documentary showing how the visitors appear to the animals. He coaches the crowd to react to him as if he was a chimpanzee and he jumps around in the cage, filming the crowd, as they throw him peanuts. Suddenly, the crowd's attention is distracted by the sound of an airplane. Puzzled, Pete looks up and sees the plane has skywritten the message, \"PETE CALL GLADYS PLEASE.\" He grins, the film cuts to Gladys and Pete driving in a car and discussing plans for the future. Gladys spots an empty billboard with a message, \"THIS SPACE FOR RENT. Apply Acme Realty Co.\" Gladys looks to be pondering the possibilities; seeing this a concerned Pete says \"What are you looking at!\" Gladys quickly reflects all her troubles that started with her name placed on signs and as she lovingly embraces Pete responds, \"Nothing, absolutely nothing!\"\n\n\nA teenage John Saxon also appears in the film, as an uncredited extra in Central Park.\n\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, this film holds a rating of 100%, based on 8 reviews, indicating a positive response.\n\nWhen the film appeared, Bosley Crowther, writing in \"The New York Times\", called it \"a neat piece of comic contrivance that will contribute to the joy of man\" with \"intelligence, compassion, and lots of gags.\" Holliday is \"brilliantly droll,\" and the script \"a compound of clever situation and broad but authentic character, wrapped up in free splurged emotions and witty, idiomatic dialogue.\" He said the role in which Jack Lemmon was cast, referring to him as the \"new young man\", was \"played superbly\".\n\n\n"}

The Calvo Doctrine thus proposed to prohibit diplomatic protection or (armed) intervention before local resources were exhausted. An investor, under this doctrine, has no recourse but to use the local courts, rather than those of their home country. As a policy prescription, the Calvo Doctrine is an expression of legal nationalism. The principle, named after Carlos Calvo, an Argentine jurist, has been applied throughout Latin America and other areas of the world.\n\nThe doctrine arose from Calvo's ideas, expressed in his \"Derecho internacional teórico y práctico de Europa y América\" (Paris, 1868; greatly expanded in subsequent editions, which were published in French). Calvo justified his doctrine as necessary to prevent the abuse of the jurisdiction of weak nations by more powerful nations. It has since been incorporated as a part of several Latin American constitutions, as well as many other treaties, statutes, and contracts. The doctrine is used chiefly in concession contracts, the clause attempting to give local courts final jurisdiction and to obviate any appeal to diplomatic intervention.\n\nThe Drago Doctrine is a narrower application of Calvo's wider principle.\n\n\n"}

He became professor in the faculty of medicine in Paris in 1863, and in the same year professor of chemistry at Palermo, where he delivered his lectures in Italian. He lost his professorship in 1867 along with his civic rights when he was condemned to fifteen months' imprisonment for his share in a secret society. On a new prosecution in 1869 for his book \"Religion, propriété, famille\" he took refuge in Spain. Returning to France under the government of Émile Ollivier he took an active share in the revolution of 4 September 1870 and became secretary of the commission of national defence.\n\nIn the French National Assembly he sat on the extreme Left, consistently opposing the opportunist policy of successive governments. Re-elected to the Chamber of Deputies of France he began the agitation against the marriage laws with which his name is especially connected. His proposal for the re-establishment of divorce was discussed in May 1879 and again in 1881 and 1882, becoming law two years later. Naquet, although he disapproved in principle of a second chamber, secured his election to the Senate of France in 1883 to pilot his measure through that body. In 1884 by his efforts divorce became legal after three years of definite separation on the demand of one of the parties concerned. In 1890 he resigned from the senate to re-enter the Chamber of Deputies, this time for the 5th arrondissement of Paris, and took his seat with the Boulangist deputies. After Boulanger's suicide his political influence declined, and was further compromised by accusations (of which he was legally cleared) in connection with the Panama scandals. Naquet died in Paris on 10 November 1916.\n\nThe thesis written for his doctorate, \"Application de l'analyse chimique à la toxicologie\" (1859), was followed by many papers on chemistry contributed to learned journals, and his \"Principes de chimie fondés sur les théories modernes\" (1865) reached its 5th edition in 1890.

{"id": "2267751", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2267751", "title": "On the Jewish Question", "text": "On the Jewish Question\n\n\"On the Jewish Question\" is a work by Karl Marx, written in 1843, and first published in Paris in 1844 under the German title \"Zur Judenfrage\" in the \"Deutsch–Französische Jahrbücher.\" It was one of Marx's first attempts to develop what would later be called the materialist conception of history.\n\nThe essay criticizes two studies by Marx's fellow Young Hegelian Bruno Bauer on the attempt by Jews to achieve political emancipation in Prussia. Bauer argued that Jews could achieve political emancipation only by relinquishing their particular religious consciousness, since political emancipation requires a secular state, which he assumes does not leave any \"space\" for social identities such as religion. According to Bauer, such religious demands are incompatible with the idea of the \"Rights of Man\". True political emancipation, for Bauer, requires the abolition of religion.\n\nMarx uses Bauer's essay as an occasion for his own analysis of liberal rights, arguing that Bauer is mistaken in his assumption that in a \"secular state\" religion will no longer play a prominent role in social life, and giving as an example the pervasiveness of religion in the United States, which, unlike Prussia, had no state religion. In Marx's analysis, the \"secular state\" is not opposed to religion, but rather actually presupposes it. The removal of religious or property qualifications for citizens does not mean the abolition of religion or property, but only introduces a way of regarding individuals in abstraction from them.\n\nOn this note Marx moves beyond the question of religious freedom to his real concern with Bauer's analysis of \"political emancipation\". Marx concludes that while individuals can be \"spiritually\" and \"politically\" free in a secular state, they can still be bound to material constraints on freedom by economic inequality, an assumption that would later form the basis of his critiques of capitalism.\n\nA number of scholars and commentators regard \"On the Jewish Question\", and in particular its second section, which addresses Bauer's work \"The Capacity of Present-day Jews and Christians to Become Free\", as antisemitic; however, a number of others disagree.\n\nIn Marx's view, Bauer fails to distinguish between political emancipation and human emancipation. As noted above, political emancipation in a modern state does \"not\" require the Jews (or, for that matter, the Christians) to renounce religion; only complete human emancipation would involve the disappearance of religion, but that is not yet possible \"within the hitherto existing world order\".\n\nIn the second part of the essay, Marx disputes Bauer's \"theological\" analysis of Judaism and its relation to Christianity. Bauer has stated that the renouncing of religion would be especially difficult for Jews, because Judaism is, in his view, a primitive stage in the development of Christianity. Hence, to achieve freedom by renouncing religion, the Christians would have to surmount only one stage, whereas the Jews would need to surmount two. In response to this, Marx argues that the Jewish religion does not need to be attached to the significance it has in Bauer's analysis, because it is only a spiritual reflection of Jewish economic life. This is the starting point of a complex and somewhat metaphorical argument which draws on the stereotype of the Jew as a financially apt \"huckster\" and posits a special connection between Judaism as a religion and the economy of contemporary bourgeois society. Thus, the Jewish religion does not need to disappear in society, as Bauer argues, because it is actually a natural part of it. Having thus figuratively equated \"practical Judaism\" with \"huckstering and money\", Marx concludes, that \"the Christians have become Jews\"; and, ultimately, it is mankind (both Christians and Jews) that needs to emancipate itself from (\"practical\") Judaism.\n\nThe second part of Marx's essay is frequently cited as evidence of Marx's antisemitism:\n\nLet us consider the actual, worldly Jew – not the Sabbath Jew, as Bauer does, but the everyday Jew. Let us not look for the secret of the Jew in his religion, but let us look for the secret of his religion in the real Jew.\nWhat is the secular basis of Judaism? Practical need, self-interest. What is the worldly religion of the Jew? Huckstering. What is his worldly God? Money. Money is the jealous god of Israel, in face of which no other god may exist. Money degrades all the gods of man – and turns them into commodities…. The bill of exchange is the real god of the Jew. His god is only an illusory bill of exchange…. The chimerical nationality of the Jew is the nationality of the merchant, of the man of money in general.[...] The Jew has emancipated himself in a Jewish manner, not only because he has acquired financial power, but also because, through him and also apart from him, money has become a world power and the practical Jewish spirit has become the practical spirit of the Christian nations. The Jews have emancipated themselves insofar as the Christians have become Jews. [...] In the final analysis, the emancipation of the Jews is the emancipation of mankind from Judaism.\n\n\"Zur Judenfrage\" was first published by Marx and Arnold Ruge in February 1844 in the \"Deutsch–Französische Jahrbücher\", a journal which ran only one issue. From December 1843 to October 1844, Bruno Bauer published the monthly \"Allgemeine Literatur-Zeitung\" (General Literary Gazette) in Charlottenburg (now Berlin). In it, he responded to the critique of his own essays on the Jewish question by Marx and others. Then, in 1845, Friedrich Engels and Marx published a polemic critique of the Young Hegelians titled \"The Holy Family\". In parts of the book, Marx again presented his views dissenting from Bauer's on the Jewish question and on political and human emancipation.\n\nA French translation appeared 1850 in Paris in Hermann Ewerbeck's book \"Qu'est-ce que la bible d'après la nouvelle philosophie allemande?\" (\"What is the Bible according to the new German philosophy?\").\n\nIn 1879, historian Heinrich von Treitschke published an article \"Unsere Aussichten\" (\"Our Prospects\"), in which he demanded that the Jews should assimilate to German culture, and described Jewish immigrants as a danger for Germany. This article would stir a controversy, to which the newspaper \"Sozialdemokrat\", edited by Eduard Bernstein, reacted by republishing almost the entire second part of \"Zur Judenfrage\" in June and July 1881.\n\nThe whole essay was republished in October 1890 in the \"Berliner Volksblatt\", then edited by Wilhelm Liebknecht.\n\nIn 1926, an English translation by H. J. Stenning, with the title \"On the Jewish Question\", appeared in a collection of essays by Marx.\n\nA translation of \"Zur Judenfrage\" was published together with other articles of Marx in 1959 under the title \"A World Without Jews\". The editor Dagobert D. Runes intended to show Marx's alleged antisemitism. This edition has been criticized because the reader is not told that its title is not from Marx, and for distortions in the text.\n\nA manuscript of the essay has not been transmitted.\n\nHyam Maccoby has argued that \"On the Jewish Question\" is an example of what he considers to be Marx's \"early antisemitism\". According to Maccoby, Marx argues in the essay that the modern commercialized world is the triumph of Judaism, a pseudo-religion whose god is money. Maccoby has suggested that Marx was embarrassed by his Jewish background and used the Jews as a \"yardstick of evil\". Maccoby writes that in later years, Marx limited what he considers to be antipathy towards Jews to private letters and conversations because of strong public identification with antisemitism by his political enemies both on the left (Pierre-Joseph Proudhon and Mikhail Bakunin) and on the right (aristocracy and the Church). Bernard Lewis has described \"On the Jewish Question\" as \"one of the classics of antisemitic propaganda\". According to several scholars, Marx considered Jews to be the embodiment of capitalism and the representation of all its evils.\n\nAbram Leon in his book \"The Jewish Question\" (published 1946) examines Jewish history from a materialist outlook. According to Leon, Marx's essay states that one \"must not start with religion in order to explain Jewish history; on the contrary: the preservation of the Jewish religion or nationality can be explained only by the 'real Jew', that is to say, by the Jew in his economic and social role\".\n\nA notable expert on antisemitism, Robert Wistrich, stated \"the net result of Marx's essay is to reinforce a traditional anti-Jewish stereotype – the identification of the Jews with money-making – in the sharpest possible manner\".\n\nIsaac Deutscher (1959) compares Marx with Elisha ben Abuyah, Baruch Spinoza, Heinrich Heine, Rosa Luxemburg, Leon Trotsky, and Sigmund Freud, all of whom he thinks of as heretics who transcend Jewry, and yet still belong to a Jewish tradition. According to Deutscher, Marx's \"idea of socialism and of the classless and stateless society\" expressed in the essay is as universal as Spinoza's ethics and God.\n\nShlomo Avineri (1964), while regarding Marx's antisemitism as a well-known fact, points out that Marx's philosophical criticism of Judaism has often overshadowed his forceful support for Jewish emancipation as an immediate political goal. Avineri notes that in Bauer's debates with a number of Jewish contemporary polemicists, Marx entirely endorsed the views of the Jewish writers against Bauer. In a letter to Arnold Ruge, written March 1843, Marx writes that he intended to support a petition of the Jews to the Provincial Assembly. He explains that with the fact that while he dislikes Judaism as a religion, he also remains unconvinced by Bauer's view (that the Jews should not be emancipated before they abandon Judaism). However, he also clarifies in the letter that his support of the petition is merely tactical, to further his efforts at weakening the Christian state.\n\nIn his book \"For Marx\" (1965), Louis Althusser claims that \"in \"On the Jewish Question\", \"Hegel's Philosophy of the State\", etc., and even usually in \"The Holy Family\" that \"... Marx was merely applying the theory of alienation, that is, Feuerbach's theory of 'human nature', to politics and the concrete activity of man, before extending it (in large part) to political economy in the \"Manuscripts\"\". He opposes a tendency according to which \"\"Capital\" is no longer read as 'On the Jewish Question', 'On the Jewish Question' is read as 'Capital. For Althusser, the essay \"is a profoundly \"ideological text\", \"committed to the struggle for Communism\", but without being Marxist; \"so it cannot, theoretically, be identified with the later texts which were to define historical materialism\".\n\nDavid McLellan, however, has argued that \"On the Jewish Question\" must be understood in terms of Marx's debates with Bruno Bauer over the nature of political emancipation in Germany. According to McLellan, Marx used the word \"Judentum\" in its colloquial sense of \"commerce\" to argue that Germans suffer, and must be emancipated from, capitalism. The second half of Marx's essay, McLellan concludes, should be read as \"an extended pun at Bauer's expense\".\n\nHal Draper (1977) observed that the language of Part II of \"On the Jewish Question\" followed the view of the Jews' role given in Jewish socialist Moses Hess' essay \"On the Money System\".\n\nStephen Greenblatt (1978) compares the essay with Christopher Marlowe's play \"The Jew of Malta\". According to Greenblatt, \"[b]oth writers hope to focus attention upon activity that is seen as at once alien and yet central to the life of the community and to direct against that activity the antisemitic feeling of the audience\". Greenblatt attributes to Marx a \"sharp, even hysterical, denial of his religious background\".\n\nYoav Peled (1992) sees Marx \"shifting the debate over Jewish emancipation from the plane of theology ... to the plane of sociology\", thereby circumventing one of Bauer's main arguments. In Peled's view, \"this was less than a satisfactory response to Bauer, but it enabled Marx to present a powerful case for emancipation while, at the same time, launching his critique of economic alienation\". He concludes that \"the philosophical advances made by Marx in 'On the Jewish Question' were necessitated by, and integrally related to, his commitment to Jewish emancipation\".\n\nOthers argue that \"On the Jewish Question\" is primarily a critique of liberal rights, rather than a criticism of Judaism, and that apparently antisemitic passages such as \"Money is the jealous god of Israel, in face of which no other god may exist\" should be read in that context.\n\nFor sociologist Robert Fine (2006) Bauer's essay \"echoed the generally prejudicial representation of the Jew as 'merchant' and 'moneyman, whereas \"Marx's aim was to defend the right of Jews to full civil and political emancipation (that is, to equal civil and political rights) alongside all other German citizens\". Fine argues that \"[the] line of attack Marx adopts is not to contrast Bauer's crude stereotype of the Jews to the actual situation of Jews in Germany\", but \"to reveal that Bauer has no inkling of the nature of modern democracy\".\n\nWhile sociologist Larry Ray in his reply (2006) acknowledges Fine's reading of the essay as an ironic defence of Jewish emancipation, he points out the polyvalence of Marx's language. Ray translates a sentence of \"Zur Judenfrage\" and interprets it as an assimilationist position \"in which there is no room within emancipated humanity for Jews as a separate ethnic or cultural identity\", and which advocates \"a society where both cultural as well as economic difference is eliminated\". Here Ray sees Marx in a \"strand of left thinking that has been unable to address forms of oppression not directly linked to class\".\n\nThe political-scientist Professor Iain Hamphsher-Monk wrote in his textbook: \"This work [\"On The Jewish Question\"] has been cited as evidence for Marx's supposed antisemitism, but only the most superficial reading of it could sustain such an interpretation.\" Francis Wheen says: \"Those critics, who see this as a foretaste of 'Mein Kampf', overlook one, essential point: in spite of the clumsy phraseology and crude stereotyping, the essay was actually written as a defense of the Jews. It was a retort to Bruno Bauer, who had argued that Jews should not be granted full civic rights and freedoms unless they were baptised as Christians\". Although he claimed to be an atheist, Bruno Bauer viewed Judaism as an inferior civilization.\n\nJonathan Sacks, Chief Rabbi of the United Kingdom, regards application of the term \"antisemitism\" to Marx as an anachronism because when Marx wrote \"On the Jewish Question\", virtually all major philosophers had expressed similar views, and the word \"antisemitism\" had not yet been coined, let alone developed a racial component, and little awareness existed of the depths of European prejudice against Jews. Marx thus simply expressed the commonplace thinking of his era, according to Sacks.\n\nIn part II of the essay, Marx refers to Thomas Müntzer:\n\nIn his \"Apology\", in large parts an attack on Martin Luther, Müntzer says:\n\nThe appreciation of Müntzer's position has been interpreted as a sympathetic view of Marx towards animals.\n\n\n\n"}

She was one of the best known women in the world for a five-year period from the mid-1920s.\n\nWhen the young Sophie Peirce-Evans was one year old, her father John Peirce-Evans, bludgeoned her mother Kate Theresa Dooling to death with a heavy stick. He was found guilty of murder and declared insane. His daughter was taken to the home of her grandfather in Newcastle West where she was brought up by two maiden aunts, who discouraged her passion for sports.\n\nAfter schooldays in Rochelle School, Cork; Princess Garden Belfast and St Margaret's Hall on Mespil Road in Dublin, where she played hockey and tennis, Sophie enrolled in the Royal College of Science for Ireland on Merrion Street (now Government Buildings).\n\nThe college was designed to produce the educated farmers which the country then needed. Sophie, one of the few women in the college, duly took a top-class degree in science, specialising in agriculture. She also played with the college hockey team and contributed to a student magazine, copies of which are held in the National Library of Ireland.\n\nShe was a Soroptimist and a Founder Member of SI Greater London, which was chartered in 1923.\n\nBefore becoming a pilot Lady Heath had already made her mark. During the First World War, she spent two years as a dispatch rider, based in England and later France, where she had her portrait painted by Sir John Lavery. By then, she had married the first of her three husbands and as Sophie Mary Eliott-Lynn, was one of the founders of the Women's Amateur Athletic Association after her move from her native Ireland to London in 1922, following a brief sojourn in Aberdeen. She was Britain's first women's javelin champion and set a disputed world record for the high jump. She was also a delegate to the International Olympic Committee in 1925, the same year that she took her first flying lessons. In 1923 she represented the United Kingdom at the 1923 Women's Olympiad in Monte Carlo, during the games she came third place at the high jump, javelin throw and the Women's pentathlon, later that year she participated in the first WAAA Championships. In 1924 she participated in the 1924 Women's Olympiad winning the silver medal in the long jump, in 1926 she again represented the United Kingdom at javelin at the 1926 Women's World Games in Gothenburg, coming fourth with a throw of 44.63 metres.\n\nThe following year, Lady Heath became the first woman to hold a commercial flying licence in Britain and along the way, set records for altitude in a small plane and later a Shorts seaplane, was the first woman to parachute from an aeroplane (landing in the middle of a football match). After her great flight from the Cape, she took a mechanic's qualification in the US, the first woman to do so.\n\nIn an era when the world had gone aviation-mad due to the exploits of Charles Lindbergh and Amelia Earhart, Lady Heath was more than able to hold her own. \"Britain's Lady Lindy,\" as she was known in the United States, made front-page news as the first pilot, male or female, to fly a small open-cockpit aircraft from Cape Town to London (Croydon Aerodrome). She had thought it would take her three weeks; as it turned out, it took her three months, from January to May 1928.\n\nA scale model of the plane used by Lady Mary is on display at The Little Museum of Dublin. She wrote about the experience later in a book \"Woman and Flying\", that she co-wrote with Stella Wolfe Murray. In July 1928 she spent a few weeks volunteering as a co-pilot with a civil airline, KLM. She was hoping to be appointed to the newly created Batavia route, which would have made her the first woman pilot with a commercial airline. The world was not ready for female pilots and her hope was not fulfilled.\n\nJust when her fame was at its height, with her life a constant whirl of lectures, races and long-distance flights, Lady Heath (she married Sir James Heath in October 1927) was badly injured in a crash just before the National Air Races in Cleveland, Ohio in 1929. Before her accident Lady Heath applied for American citizenship, intending to remain in the USA where she had made a good living on the lecture circuit and as an agent for Cirrus engines. Lady Heath was never the same after her accident.\n\nAfter divorce in Reno, Nevada, from Heath in 1930, she returned to Ireland with her third husband G.A.R. Williams, a horseman and pilot of Caribbean origin, and became involved in private aviation, briefly running her own company at Kildonan, near Dublin in the mid-1930s, and helping produce the generation of pilots that would help establish the national airline Aer Lingus.\n\nLady Heath first marriage was to Major William Elliot Lynn after which she was well known as Mrs Elliot Lynn. She divorced her husband, alleging cruelty and after he died in London in early 1927, married Sir James Heath on 11 October 1927 at Christ Church in Mayfair, London. In January 1930 she filed for a divorce from Heath in Reno, Nevada, United States and was awarded a decree nisi in May of the same year.\n\nOn 12 November 1931, she married G.A.R. Williams in Lexington, Kentucky, United States.\n\nOn 9 May 1939, aged 42, she died in St Leonard's Hospital, Shoreditch, London following a fall inside a double-decker tram. At the inquest the conductor gave evidence that she was sitting on the top deck and she seemed \"very vague\"; another passenger commented to the conductor that \"I think the lady is asleep\", before she fell down the stairs and hit her head on the driver's controller box. In the previous years, with alcoholism now a serious problem, she had left Ireland and her husband for England and had made a number of appearances in court on charges relating to drunkenness.\n\nA pathologist said he found no evidence of alcohol but detailed evidence of an old blood clot which may have caused the fall; the jury returned a verdict of accidental death. On 15 May 1939, according to newspaper reports, her ashes were scattered over Surrey from an aircraft flown by her estranged husband from Croydon Airport although legend has it that her ashes were returned to Ireland where they were scattered over her native Newcastle West.\n\nIn 2013, aviator Tracey Curtis-Taylor retraced Lady Heath's 1928 South Africa to England flight in a biplane. The flight was the subject of a BBC documentary, which included details and photographs of Lady Heath's original flight.\n\n\n"}

Meunier, and grew up in France, Switzerland and China, mostly in Shanghai. After the outbreak of World War II, in anticipation of Japan's entry into the war, his family moved in 1941 to Sydney, Australia, and changed their last name to \"Miller\". He was educated at St Aloysius' College in Sydney, where he met his future colleague, Sir Gustav Nossal.\n\nMiller studied medicine at the University of Sydney, and had his first experience of laboratory research in the laboratory of Professor Patrick de Burgh where he studied virus infection.\n\nIn 1958, Miller travelled to the United Kingdom on a Gaggin Research Fellowship from the University of Queensland. He was accepted to the Chester Beatty Research Institute of Cancer Research (part of the Institute of Cancer Research, London) and as a PhD student at the University of London. Miller chose to study the pathogenesis of lymphocytic leukemia in mice, expanding on the research of Ludwik Gross into murine leukemia virus. Miller showed that experimental animals without a thymus at birth were incapable of rejecting foreign tissues and resisting many infections, thus demonstrating that the thymus is vital for development and function of the adaptive immune system. Prior to this, the thymus was believed to be a vestigial organ with no function. His discovery has led many to describe Miller as the \"world's only living person who can claim to have been the first to have described the functions of a human organ\". In 1963, Miller continued his work into the function of the thymus at the National Institutes of Health.\n\nIn 1966, Miller returned to Australia to become a research group leader at the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research in Melbourne, at the invitation of its new director Sir Gustav Nossal, the successor of Sir Macfarlane Burnet. There, with student Graham Mitchell, he discovered that mammalian lymphocytes can be separated into what were later called T cells and B cells, and that these interact to allow normal antibody production (T cell help). Miller went on to show that the thymus produces the T cells, that it removes autoreactive T cells (central T cell tolerance) and several other landmark findings in immunology. These are considered crucial to understanding diseases such as cancer, autoimmunity and AIDS, as well as processes such as transplant rejection, allergy and antiviral immunity. Miller was also the first to provide evidence that thymus-derived immune cells are important for the defense against certain tumors, which forms the basis for modern cancer immunotherapy.\n\nSemi-retired since 1996, Miller is still involved in immunological research.\n\nMiller has had a longstanding interest in art, and studied art in the 1980s. His art has been exhibited at venues in Melbourne.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The company was founded in 1935 by Thomas P. Raley in Placerville, and employs around 12,000 team members as of 2019. Headquartered in West Sacramento, California, Raley's is the dominant supermarket operator in the Sacramento metropolitan area.\n\nThe company was founded on February 16, 1935 by Thomas P. Raley in Placerville, CA as Raley's Drive-In Market. Raley ran the company until his death on December 27, 1991, at the age of 88. Raley's purchased Bel Air Markets in 1993, Nob Hill Foods in 1997 and Scolari's Food & Drug Company in 2018. The company also started Food Source in 1995 and Market 5-ONE-5 in 2018.\n\nIn 1998, the company had revenue of $2.5 billion. In June 1999, Albertsons announced plans to sell its 19 stores in Las Vegas to Raley's, which also planned to purchase eight Albertson's stores in New Mexico. For five years, Raley's had been searching for ways to expand the company, with specific interest in the Las Vegas and Salt Lake City markets. At the time, Raley's was the 38th largest supermarket chain in the United States, with 150 stores, including Bel Air Markets, Food Source and Nob Hill Foods. The company had 17,500 employees across its four divisions. Raley's opened its Las Vegas stores later in 1999, and had plans to build additional locations in the Las Vegas area.\n\nAt the time, Michael Teel – the grandson of Thomas Raley – was the company's president and chief executive officer (CEO). Joyce Teel, the mother of Michael Teel, was the company's owner. William J. Coyne, the company's first general counsel, became the chief operating officer in February 2002. Michael Teel resigned as president in April 2002, to pursue \"personal endeavors.\" Coyne replaced Teel as president.\n\nIn September 2002, Kroger announced plans to purchase Raley's 18 store locations in Las Vegas, with intentions of converting them into Smith's and Food 4 Less stores. Raley's stated that slow growth and local competition were reasons for selling the stores. The revenue from the sale was to be used to build and renovate stores in Reno, Nevada and northern California. The Federal Trade Commission approved the sale in November 2002. Raley's stores in Las Vegas began closing later that month. , three Raley's supermarkets had been awarded Greenchill Partnership Gold-Level Certification by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for environmentally friendly refrigeration technology.\nAs of 2012, Raley's operates 128 stores, 40 of them in the Greater Sacramento area. Those stores control the city's largest market share: 28%, down from 30% in 2007 and 34% in 2003, according to Metro Market Studies of Tucson, Arizona. By comparison, other local market shares are Safeway at 16.7%, Costco at 11.9% and Save Mart Supermarkets at 9.2%. However, the company is suffering from increased competition in the region as well as the poor economy, and had more than 150 corporate layoffs in 2011 and closed several stores in 2012.\n\n\"Supermarket News\" ranks Raley's 38th in the \"Top 75 North American Food Retailers\" based on sales of $3.4 billion. \"Consumer Reports\" surveys rank Raley's among the top U.S. supermarket chains, in particular for customer service. The same held true for 2012, although the chain fell from 4th nationwide in 2009 to 8th. \n\nThomas Raley's family still controls the company. His grandson, Michael Teel, became the majority shareholder in mid-2015 and currently serves as Chairman. Keith Knopf was named Raley's Chief Operating Officer on June 1, 2015, and added 'President' to his title in February 2017. He was then promoted to President and Chief Executive Officer on September 27, 2018. Knopf has worked with May Co. Department Stores and Kohl's retail chain in the past.\n\nIn 2004, Raley's opened its first Aisle 1 brand gas station in Galt, CA, and eventually grew Aisle 1 into 13 locations in Northern California and Nevada. Raley's sold all 13 Aisle 1 locations to Anabi Oil in December 2018. Raley Field, home of the Sacramento River Cats, the Triple-A affiliate of the San Francisco Giants, is located in West Sacramento and is named after the chain.\n\nOn October 28, 2019, Raley's announced plans to close 27 in–store pharmacies.

As such the car's engineering proved unsound and trial runs on rough roads led to severe cracks in the bodywork.\n\nHarald Friedrich, managing partner of Alzmetall P. Meier & Friedrich GmbH in Altenmarkt an der Alz, acquired the license from Brütsch to build the \"Spatz\" and in July 1956 with the Victoria works as a partner, founded the GmbH (BAG) in Traunreut.\n\nBecause of the deficiencies in the original design, Friedrich asked the then 77-year-old Hans Ledwinka, the former Tatra engineer, to design a robust chassis for the car. The result was a central tube frame and four wheels – in contrast to the original three-wheeled Brütsch.

{"id": "2267781", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2267781", "title": "Discourse ethics", "text": "Discourse ethics\n\nDiscourse ethics refers to a type of argument that attempts to establish normative or ethical truths by examining the presuppositions of discourse.\nVariations of this argument have been used in the establishment of egalitarian ethics, as well as libertarian ethics.\n\nGerman philosophers Jürgen Habermas and Karl-Otto Apel are considered the originators of modern discourse ethics. Habermas's discourse ethics is his attempt to explain the implications of communicative rationality in the sphere of moral insight and normative validity. It is a complex theoretical effort to reformulate the fundamental insights of Kantian deontological ethics in terms of the analysis of communicative structures. This means that it is an attempt to explain the universal and obligatory nature of morality by evoking the universal obligations of communicative rationality. It is also a cognitivist moral theory, which means it holds that justifying the validity of moral norms can be done in a manner analogous to the justification of facts. However, the entire project is undertaken as a rational reconstruction of moral insight. It claims only to reconstruct the implicit normative orientations that guide individuals and it claims to access these through an analysis of communication.\n\nThis type of ethics consists of conversations about ideas in civic or community contexts marked by diversity of perspectives requiring thoughtful public engagement. This discourse is made up of differing insights that helps to shape the public's engagement with one another. This type of discourse is meant to protect and to promote the public good. For public discourse ethics to be successful there must be an effective level of civility between people or persons involved. It was Sigmund Freud who once said, \"civilization began the first time an angry person cast a word instead of a rock\" and that statement is something that continues to be seen in society today. The Harvard Law Review accurately examines public discourse and explains it in a manner that is appropriate and conceptually accurate. \"Every man who publishes a book commits himself to the judgement of the public, and anyone may comment upon his performance... [W]hatever their merits, others have a right to pass their judgement upon them-to censure them if they be censurable, and to turn them into ridicule if they be ridiculous\". For the public discourse ethics to be productive there must be accountability on the public stage as the Harvard Law Review calls into question. Without any act of accountability the ethicality of the discourse is no longer valid and cannot go on. Public accountability consists of three basic factors. The factors are a diversity of ideas, an engagement of public decision making, and finally an account for continuing a practice or way of doing something or a means or reason for changing the practice. Finally, public discourse ethics puts a great responsibility on the individual. They must continually be asking questions and finding answers. They will not always be right; and that is okay. As long as they are able to make a positive decision in the end.\n\nHabermas maintains that normative validity cannot be understood as separate from the argumentative procedures used in everyday practice, such as those used to resolve issues concerning the legitimacy of actions and the validity of the norms governing interactions. He makes this claim by making reference to the validity dimensions attached to speech acts in communication and the implicit forms of argumentation they imply (see Universal pragmatics). The basic idea is that the validity of a moral norm cannot be justified in the mind of an isolated individual reflecting on the world. The validity of a norm is justified only intersubjectively in processes of argumentation between individuals; in a dialectic. The validity of a claim to normative rightness depends upon the mutual understanding achieved by individuals in argument.\n\nFrom this it follows that the presuppositions of argumentation would become important. Kant extracted moral principles from the necessities forced upon a rational subject reflecting on the world. Habermas extracts moral principles from the necessities forced upon individuals engaged in the discursive justification of validity claims, from the inescapable presuppositions of communication and argumentation. These presuppositions were the kinds of idealization that individuals had to make in order for communication and argumentation to even begin. For example:\n\nThere were also presuppositions unique to discourse:\n\nThese are all at the center of Habermas's moral theory. Habermas's discourse ethics attempts to distill the idealized moral point of view that accompanies a perfectly rational process of argumentation (also idealized), which would be the moral principle implied by the presuppositions listed above. The key point is that the presuppositions of argumentation and communication that have been rationally reconstructed by Habermas are both factual and normative. This can be said about his entire project because it is explicitly attempting to bridge the gap between the \"is\" and the \"ought.\" Habermas speaks of the mutual recognition and exchanging of roles and perspectives that are demanded by the very structural condition of rational argumentation. He maintains that what is implied in these factual presuppositions of communication is the deep structure of moral norms, the conditions that every valid norm must fulfill.\n\nThe presuppositions of communication express a universal obligation to maintain impartial judgment in discourse, which constrains all affected to adopt the perspectives of all others in the exchange of reasons. From this Habermas extracts the following principle of universalization (U), which is the condition every valid norm has to fulfill:\n\nThis can be understood as the deep structure of all acceptable moral norms, and should not be confused with the principle of discourse ethics (D), which presupposes that norms exist that satisfy the conditions specified by (U).\n\n(D) Only those norms can claim to be valid that meet (or could meet) with the approval of all affected in their capacity as participants in a practical discourse.\n\nThe implications of (U) and (D) are quite profound. (U) claims to be a rational reconstruction of the impartial moral point of view at the heart of all cognitivist moral theories. According to moral cognitivists (e.g. Kant, Rawls etc.), it is only from such a moral point of view that insight into the actual (quasi-factual) impersonal obligations of a general will can be gained, because this perspective relieves decisions from the inaccuracies of personal interests. Of course, Habermas's reconstruction is different because it is intersubjective. That is, Habermas (unlike Kant or Rawls) formulates the moral point of view as it arises out of the multiple perspectives of those affected by a norm under consideration. The moral point of view explicated in (U) is not the property of an individual subject but the property of a community of interlocutors, the results of a complex dialogical process of role taking and perspective exchanging. Furthermore, (U) is deduced from a rational reconstruction of the presupposition of communication, which downgrades the strong transcendentalism of Kantian ethics by establishing a foundation in inner-worldly processes of communication.\n\n(D) on the other hand is a principle concerning the manner in which norms conforming to (U) must be justified through discourse. Again, Habermas takes the task of moral reflection out of the isolated individual's head and gives it to intersubjective processes of communication. What (D) proposes is that moral principles must be validated in actual discourse and that those to be affected by a norm must be able to participate in argumentation concerning its validity. No number of thought experiments can replace a communicative exchange with others regarding moral norms that will affect them. Moreover, this general prescription concerning the type of discourse necessary for the justification of moral norms opens the process of moral deliberation to the kind of learning that accompanies a fallibilistic orientation. (U) and (D) are catalysts for a moral learning process, which although fallible is not relative. The flesh and blood insights of participants in communicative exchange are refracted through the universal guidelines explicated from the deep structures of communication and argumentation. This spawns discourses with a rational trajectory, which are grounded in the particular circumstances of those involved but aimed at a universal moral validity.\n\nThe practical applications of discourse ethics have taken a significant turn after the publication of Habermas' book \"Between Facts and Norms\" (1992), where its application to democracy and the legislative process was substantially refined and expanded. Before this book, Habermas had left open the question of the various applications of discourse theory to almost any type of consensus oriented group ranging from highly visible political and governmental groups, such as Parliament in Great Britain and Congressional debate in the United States, and other consensus oriented activities as found in public and private institutions such as those supported on various international websites and Wikipedia.\n\n\n"}

It stars a group of working dogs in a TV station that struggle to put her TV shows on air.\n\nThe show presented the fictional programs \"Jornal Colossal\"; \"Clip-Cão\"; \"Pedigree\", a parody of Rede Globo's soap operas; \"As Aventuras do Super-Cão\"; \"Olimpíadas de Cachorro\"; \"Acredite Se Puder\" (\"Believe it if you can\") satirizing the Ripley's Believe It or Not! ; \"ColosShow\"; \"Asfalto Quente\"; \"Aprendendo Prá Cachorro\"; \"CapaShow\"; and others.\n\nThe show was created by Luiz Ferré, a graphic artist, who also created its characters; and directed by J. B. de Oliveira (Boninho), famous for Rede Globo's hits \"No Limite\" (Brazilian version of \"Survivor\") and \"Big Brother Brasil\". The puppets were created by Criadores e Criaturas, Ltda. and made by Roberto Dornelles from Grupo 100 Modos de Teatro de Bonecos. \n\nIt was a big hit on Brazil and worldwide, but was cancelled due to intense production costs. The show was also broadcast in Japan by NHK.\n\nIn 2009, the show's return in April of the same year was discussed by the producer, but not happened. Also in that year, it was reported that a DVD box set featuring the show's most important episodes and a Broadway-inspired musical are in works.\n\nOn October 12, 2016, the show resumed production as a webseries for Playkids.\n\nAfter the ending of Xou da Xuxa in 1993, TV Globo wanted a new children's show for filling the timeslot. Director Boninho got in touch with the artist Luiz Ferré to create a concept for the program. \n\n\nThe 28 puppets were 25 dogs and 3 fleas.\n\nThe body puppets needed dancers to control its movements.\n\nThe puppets needed electronic puppeteers and voice actors.\n\nThe puppet mechanisms were made by Inventiva Bonecos e Cenários, Ltda. who visited Los Angeles studios searching special effects technology. The animations were radio-controlled, making more realism.\n\nThe sets were created by Lia Renha, Maria Odile, Kátia Florêncio and Fernando Schmidt, and had different dimensions variating since miniature to the big ones.\n\nAll props were built specially for TV Colosso.\n\nLogo abaixo está a lista de alguns desenhos que foram exibidos na TV Colosso:\n\n\nThis made-for-TV featurette film was aired on December 24, 1993, and retold traditional Christmas stories.\n\nThe story tells TV Colosso's gang celebrating Christmas at JF's house and watching special scheduling at a high-technology TV. Priscila, Capachildo Capachão, Thunder Dog and others watch \"A Estrela de Belém, Cada Gilmar é um Rei\" (loosely based on the \"Three Wise Men\" classic tale) and \"O Avarento\" (loosely based on \"Ebeneezer Scrooger\" by Charles Dickens).\n\nThe sets on this special were made by Lia Renha and Fernando Schmidt, the costumes were designed by Billy Accioly, and art was produced by Silvana Estrella.\n\nDue to celebration of Children's Day in 1994, an episode of TV Colosso was specially produced to be shown on Terça Nobre (primetime block), mixing for the first time puppets with live actors.\n\nIn this special, Priscila and the gang are producing and hosting the special show. The guest stars were the Rede Globo cast: Renato Aragão, Dedé Santana, Casseta & Planeta Team, Regina Casé, Tom Cavalcante, Xuxa, Sandy & Júnior, Claudio Heinrich, Ana Paula Tabalipa, André Marques and Carolina Dieckmann.\n\nThe special was taped at the original sets of TV Colosso and at Teatro Fenix, on Rio de Janeiro, where Fernando Schmidt turned the theater at TV Colosso's auditorium.\n\nThe success of TV Colosso launched 2 records by Som Livre, a feature film, shows, a theatrical play, toys and games by Estrela and Sega, and comic books by Editora Abril.\n\nDue to major success of TV Colosso, a feature film was produced by Paris Filmes, Criadores e Criaturas, Ltda. and Play Video Produções Para TV & Cinema. The film was released in 1994 and the biggest sadness about it were its R$ 2,000,000 budget and that to date his producers didn't pay incentive taxes.\n\nPriscila, Alice, Gilmar, Capachildo Capachão, JF, Nestor, Castilho, Malabi, Walter Gate, Waltinho, Borges, Bullborg, Bóris, Jaca Paladium, Paulo Paulada, and all staff of TV Colosso want to throw a party to celebrate the Dog's Day. They organize a game contest, and Gilmar chooses the Thinker Dog Statue, by renowned sculptor Cacheau Rodin, as a trophy. But Afrânio Furtado, Dona Jóia Furtado and his children Rubi and Furtadinho manage to steal it, trying to cut the fun short.\n\n\n\n\nOn October 2009, Som Livre and Globo Marcas released an DVD trilogy focusing the show's best episodes:\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2267817", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2267817", "title": "Standard Steel Car Company", "text": "Standard Steel Car Company\n\nThe Standard Steel Car Company (SSC) was a manufacturer of railroad rolling stock in the United States that existed between 1902 and 1934. \n\nEstablished in 1902 in Butler, Pennsylvania by John M. Hansen and \"Diamond Jim\" Brady, the company quickly became one of the largest builders of steel cars in the United States. Pullman, Inc. purchased control of SSC in 1929 and merged it with Pullman Car & Manufacturing in 1934 to form Pullman-Standard Car Manufacturing Company.\n\nThe overnight success of the Pressed Steel Car Company at the end of the 19th century spurred a flurry of competitors in the suddenly booming market for steel cars. American Car & Foundry predecessor Michigan-Peninsular Car had produced steel frame cars beginning in 1897, American Steel Foundries produced steel cars in 1900, and the Cambria Steel Company opened a car plant at Johnstown, Pennsylvania in 1901. Pressed Steel Car's Chief Designer John M. Hansen and famed salesman \"Diamond Jim\" Brady left the company in 1901 to found SSC. With financial backing from Andrew Mellon, SSC was incorporated on January 2, 1902, broke ground for its new half-mile long plant in Butler in April, and produced its first car (Chesapeake & Ohio 23001) in August.\n\nHansen's carbuilding philosophy was the opposite of Pressed Steel Car founder Charles T. Schoen's. Schoen believed that each part of a car should be cut and shaped (pressed) from sheet steel to minimize weight and the need for assemblies of small parts while maximizing strength. The custom stamping dies and assemblies needed for this work were expensive and uneconomical in small quantities. Hansen preferred to use standard steel shapes that were already widely available from the steel mills at economical cost. SSC's earliest production reflected this: a steel hopper with side posts made from standard channel and angle shapes became the company's signature product, building over 7,500 through 1907.\n\nExpansion was immediate. Capacity was increased first to 60 cars a day, then 125 cars a day in 1903. Production peaked at 29,411 cars in 1907, 2,836 of those built in January of that year. In October of 1907, a ladle full of 9,000 lbs. of molten steel, exploded, killing 4 workers instantly, fatally wounding 20 others, and severely injuring 10 more. SSC would bounce back from this disaster. SSC's subsidiary, Standard Car Truck Company, opened at New Castle, Pennsylvania in 1906, and a second SSC plant opened at Hammond, Indiana in 1907. Hansen established a car shop in LaRochelle, France for SSC in 1917, and SSC also controlled a plant in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. SSC also entered the field of automobile production in 1913 with the Standard Eight, which in 1919 had 83 horsepower (62 kW). Automobile production ended in 1921.\n\n\"Diamond Jim\" Brady died in 1917, and Hansen retired from the presidency in 1923, succeeded by Colonel James Frank Drake. Hansen stayed on as board chairman until his death in December 1929. That same month, Pullman Inc. agreed to purchase SSC for 610,000 shares of Pullman stock (worth approximately $51 million) and $6 million in cash. SSC continued to operate independently for several years as the Great Depression brought business to an almost standstill. Merger with Pullman Car & Manufacturing in 1934 created Pullman-Standard, a second giant car builder to rival American Car & Foundry. Pullman continued to operate at Butler until it exited the railroad car business in 1982, and sold the plant to Trinity Industries in 1984. Trinity Industries left the plant in 1993, and in 2005 the plant had been completely demolished. In 2011, a jumbo grain car built by Pullman-Standard in June of 1974, was restored and brought to Pullman Square, to serve as a monument to the workers of Standard Steel Car Company and Pullman-Standard.\n\nSSC gained control of a number of other car builders during its existence.\n\n\n\n"}

Written by Mick Jagger and Keith Richards, it was named as the 100th greatest song of all time by \"Rolling Stone\" magazine in its 2004 list of the \"500 Greatest Songs of All Time\" before dropping a place the following year.\n\nJagger commented on the song's beginnings:\n\"You Can't Always Get What You Want\" was the first song recorded for the album. It exists in two versions, a 4:51 single mix and a 7:28 album mix. \"You Can't Always Get What You Want\" was recorded on 16 and 17 November 1968 at Olympic Sound Studios in London. It features the London Bach Choir opening the song (the choir opening is only on the album version), highlighting throughout, and bringing it to its conclusion. Al Kooper plays piano and organ, as well as the French horn intro, while Rocky Dijon plays congas, maracas and tambourine.\n\nIn his review of the song, Richie Unterberger of AllMusic said: \"If you buy John Lennon's observation that the Rolling Stones were apt to copy the Beatles' innovations within a few months or so, 'You Can't Always Get What You Want' is the Rolling Stones' counterpart to 'Hey Jude'.\" Jagger said in 1969, \"I liked the way the Beatles did that with 'Hey Jude'. The orchestra was not just to cover everything up—it was something extra. We may do something like that on the next album.\"\n\nThe three verses (and the varied theme of the fourth verse) address major topics of the 1960s: love, politics, and drugs. Each verse captures the essence of the initial optimism and eventual disillusion, followed by the resigned pragmatism of the chorus.\n\nUnterberger elaborated: \nJimmy Hutmaker of Excelsior, Minnesota, claimed to be the \"Mr. Jimmy\" cited in the song and that he said the phrase \"you can't always get what you want\" to Jagger during a chance encounter at an Excelsior drug store in 1964. However, David Dalton, a writer for \"Rolling Stone\" who witnessed the filming of \"The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus\", claims in his commentary for the DVD of the concert that \"Mr. Jimmy\" refers to Miller, the Stones producer from 1968 to 1973.\n\nMarianne Faithfull has also claimed a role: \"Obviously I also contributed to 'You Can't Always Get What You Want' and 'Dear Doctor' – junk songs... I know they used me as a muse for those tough drug songs. I knew I was being used but it was for a worthy cause.\"\n\nThe song was originally released on the B-side of \"Honky Tonk Women\" in July 1969. Although it did not chart at the time, London Records re-serviced the single in 1973 and \"You Can't Always Get What You Want\" reached number 42 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 and number 34 on the \"Cashbox\" Top 100 Singles chart. One of the Stones' most popular recordings, it has since appeared on the compilations \"Hot Rocks\", \"\" (single version), \"Forty Licks\", \"\", \"Singles 1968-1971\" (single version), \"Slow Rollers\" (single version) and \"GRRR!\" (single version).\n\nThe song is also very popular at Rolling Stones shows in part because of its sing-along chorus, and is played at almost every show, where it is customary for Jagger to change the lyrics from \"my favourite flavour, cherry red\" to the question \"What's your favourite flavour?\" to which the audience replies \"Cherry red!\" Live recordings appear on the albums \"Love You Live\", \"Flashpoint\", \"Live Licks\", \"Hyde Park Live\", and \"\", as well as on \"The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus\", filmed in 1968. Stones concert films that contain the song include: \"\", \"\"From the Vault – L.A Forum - Live in 1975\", \"Let's Spend the Night Together\", \"Stones at the Max\", \"Bridges to Babylon Tour '97–98\", \"Four Flicks\", \"The Biggest Bang\", \"Sweet Summer Sun: Hyde Park Live\", and \"Havana Moon\".\n\nThe song was performed live with members of Voce Chamber Choir and London Youth Choir for the Stones' 2012 reunion shows in London, November 25 and November 29. The same choir also performed on the track at Glastonbury and two performances at Hyde Park in 2013. On 12/31/2019, ABKCO records released a 22 minute recording from the choir practice sessions. In the track, the choir can be heard working out the lines and voices with Mick Jagger speaking in between takes. The recording was only made available for 24 hours on Youtube.com – largely to protect the copyright of the unreleased session.\n\nPresident Donald Trump played the Rolling Stones' recording of the song at campaign appearances during the 2016 Republican primaries and the presidential election, including his nationally televised acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention in July. Although the campaign had attained a blanket license from ASCAP, after the convention, the band stated publicly that they do not endorse Trump and requested that he cease all use of their songs immediately. Despite the requests to stop, Trump continued using the song at campaign rallies before and after the 2016 election. According to Jagger, the band considers the use of the song as a play-out at rallies to be \"odd,\" given that it is a \"sort of doomy ballad about drugs in Chelsea.\" The Trump campaign continued to use the song during 2020.\n\nThe Rolling Stones\n\nAdditional personnel\n"}

{"id": "2267847", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2267847", "title": "Unilineal evolution", "text": "Unilineal evolution\n\nUnilineal evolution, also referred to as classical social evolution, is a 19th-century social theory about the evolution of societies and cultures. It was composed of many competing theories by various anthropologists and sociologists, who believed that Western culture is the contemporary pinnacle of social evolution. Different social status is aligned in a single line that moves from most primitive to most civilized. This theory is now generally considered obsolete in academic circles.\n\nTheories of social and cultural evolution are common in modern European thought. Prior to the 18th century, Europeans predominantly believed that societies on Earth were in a state of decline. European society held up the world of antiquity as a standard to aspire to, and ancient Greece and ancient Rome produced levels of technical accomplishment which Europeans of the Middle Ages sought to emulate. At the same time, Christianity taught that people lived in a debased world fundamentally inferior to the Garden of Eden and Heaven. During the Age of Enlightenment, however, European self-confidence grew and the notion of progress became increasingly popular. It was during this period that what would later become known as 'sociological and cultural evolution' would have its roots.\n\nThe Enlightenment thinkers often speculated that societies progressed through stages of increasing development and looked for the logic, order and the set of scientific truths that determined the course of human history. Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, for example, argued that social development was an inevitable and determined process, similar to an acorn which has no choice but to become an oak tree. Likewise, it was assumed that societies start out primitive, perhaps in a Hobbesian state of nature, and naturally progress toward something resembling industrial Europe.\n\nWhile earlier authors such as Michel de Montaigne discussed how societies change through time, it was truly the Scottish Enlightenment which proved key in the development of cultural evolution. After Scotland's union with England in 1707, several Scottish thinkers pondered on the relationship between progress and the 'decadence' brought about by increased trade with England and the affluence it produced. The result was a series of conjectural histories. Authors such as Adam Ferguson, John Millar, and Adam Smith argued that all societies pass through a series of four stages: hunting and gathering, pastoralism and nomadism, agricultural, and finally a stage of commerce. These thinkers thus understood the changes Scotland was undergoing as a transition from an agricultural to a mercantile society.\n\nPhilosophical concepts of progress (such as those expounded by the German philosopher G.W.F. Hegel) developed as well during this period. In France authors such as Claude Adrien Helvétius and other philosophers were influenced by this Scottish tradition. Later thinkers such as Comte de Saint-Simon developed these ideas. Auguste Comte in particular presented a coherent view of social progress and a new discipline to study it: sociology.\n\nThese developments took place in a wider context. The first process was colonialism. Although Imperial powers settled most differences of opinion with their colonial subjects with force, increased awareness of non-Western peoples raised new questions for European scholars about the nature of society and culture. Similarly, effective administration required some degree of understanding of other cultures. Emerging theories of social evolution allowed Europeans to organize their new knowledge in a way that reflected and justified their increasing political and economic domination of others: colonized people were less-evolved, colonizing people were more evolved. The second process was the Industrial Revolution and the rise of capitalism which allowed and promoted continual revolutions in the means of production. Emerging theories of social evolution reflected a belief that the changes in Europe wrought by the Industrial Revolution and capitalism were obvious improvements. Industrialization, combined with the intense political change brought about by the French Revolution and US Constitution which were paving the way for the dominance of democracy, forced European thinkers to reconsider some of their assumptions about how society was organized.\n\nEventually, in the 19th century, three great classical theories of social and historical change were created: the social evolutionism theory, the social cycle theory and the Marxist historical materialism theory. Those theories had one common factor: they all agreed that the history of humanity is pursuing a certain fixed path, most likely that of the social progress. Thus, each past event is not only chronologically, but causally tied to the present and future events. Those theories postulated that by recreating the sequence of those events, sociology could discover the laws of history.\n\nWhile social evolutionists agree that the evolution-like process leads to social progress, classical social evolutionists have developed many different theories, known as theories of unilineal evolution. Social evolutionism was the prevailing theory of early socio-cultural anthropology and social commentary, and is associated with scholars like Auguste Comte, Edward Burnett Tylor, Lewis Henry Morgan, and Herbert Spencer. Social evolutionism represented an attempt to formalize social thinking along scientific lines, later influenced by the biological theory of evolution. If organisms could develop over time according to discernible, deterministic laws, then it seemed reasonable that societies could as well. This really marks the beginning of Anthropology as a scientific discipline and a departure from traditional religious views of \"primitive\" cultures.\n\nThe term \"classical social evolutionism\" is most closely associated with the 19th-century writings of Auguste Comte, Herbert Spencer (who coined the phrase \"survival of the fittest\") and William Graham Sumner. In many ways Spencer's theory of 'cosmic evolution' has much more in common with the works of Jean-Baptiste Lamarck and Auguste Comte than with contemporary works of Charles Darwin. Spencer also developed and published his theories several years earlier than Darwin. In regard to social institutions, however, there is a good case that Spencer's writings might be classified as 'Social Evolutionism'. Although he wrote that societies over time progressed, and that progress was accomplished through competition, he stressed that the individual (rather than the collectivity) is the unit of analysis that evolves, that evolution takes place through natural selection and that it affects social as well as biological phenomenon.\n\nBoth Spencer and Comte view the society as a kind of organism subject to the process of growth—from simplicity to complexity, from chaos to order, from generalization to specialization, from flexibility to organization. They agreed that the process of societies growth can be divided into certain stages, have their beginning and eventual end, and that this growth is in fact social progress—each newer, more evolved society is better. Thus progressivism became one of the basic ideas underlying the theory of social evolutionism.\n\nAuguste Comte, known as father of sociology, formulated the law of three stages: human development progresses from the theological stage, in which nature was mythically conceived and man sought the explanation of natural phenomena from supernatural beings, through metaphysical stage in which nature was conceived of as a result of obscure forces and man sought the explanation of natural phenomena from them until the final positive stage in which all abstract and obscure forces are discarded, and natural phenomena are explained by their constant relationship. This progress is forced through the development of human mind, and increasing application of thought, reasoning and logic to the understanding of world.\n\nHerbert Spencer believed that society was evolving toward increasing freedom for individuals; and so held that government intervention, ought to be minimal in social and political life, differentiated between two phases of development, focusing is on the type of internal regulation within societies. Thus, he differentiated between military and industrial societies. The earlier, more primitive military society has a goal of conquest and defence, is centralised, economically self-sufficient, collectivistic, puts the good of the group over the good of the individual, uses compulsion, force, and repression, rewards loyalty, obedience and discipline. The industrial society has a goal of production and trade, is decentralised, interconnected with other societies via economic relations, achieves its goals through voluntary cooperation and individual self-restraint, treats the good of the individual as the highest value, regulates the social life via voluntary relations, and values initiative, independence, and innovation.\n\nRegardless of how scholars of Spencer interpret his relation to Darwin, Spencer proved to be an incredibly popular figure in the 1870s, particularly in the United States. Authors such as Edward L. Youmans, William Graham Sumner, John Fiske, John W. Burgess, Lester Frank Ward, Lewis H. Morgan and other thinkers of the gilded age all developed theories of social evolutionism as a result of their exposure to Spencer as well as Darwin.\n\nLewis H. Morgan, an anthropologist whose ideas have had much impact on sociology, in his 1877 classic \"Ancient Societies\" differentiated between three eras: savagery, barbarism and civilisation, which are divided by technological inventions, like fire, bow, pottery in savage era, domestication of animals, agriculture, metalworking in barbarian era and alphabet and writing in civilisation era. Thus Morgan introduced a link between the social progress and technological progress. Morgan viewed the technological progress as a force behind social progress, and any social change—in social institutions, organisations or ideologies have their beginning in the change of technology. Morgan's theories were popularised by Friedrich Engels, who based his famous work \"\"The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State\"\" on it. For Engels and other Marxists, this theory was important as it supported their conviction that materialistic factors—economical and technological—are decisive in shaping the fate of humanity.\n\nÉmile Durkheim, another of the 'fathers' of sociology, has developed a similar, dichotomical view of social progress. His key concept was social solidarity, as he defined the social evolution in terms of progressing from mechanical solidarity to organic solidarity. In mechanical solidarity, people are self-sufficient, there is little integration and thus there is the need for use of force and repression to keep society together. In organic solidarity, people are much more integrated and interdependent and specialisation and cooperation is extensive. Progress from mechanical to organic solidarity is based first on population growth and increasing population density, second on increasing 'morality density' (development of more complex social interactions) and thirdly, on the increasing specialisation in workplace. To Durkheim, the most important factor in the social progress is the division of labor.\n\nAnthropologists Edward Burnett Tylor in England and Lewis H. Morgan in the United States worked with data from indigenous people, whom they claimed represented earlier stages of cultural evolution that gave insight into the process and progression of cultural evolution. Morgan would later have a significant influence on Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, who developed a theory of cultural evolution in which the internal contradictions in society created a series of escalating stages that ended in a socialist society (see Marxism). Tylor and Morgan elaborated upon, modified and expanded the theory of unilinear evolution, specifying criteria for categorizing cultures according to their standing within a fixed system of growth of humanity as a whole while examining the modes and mechanisms of this growth.\n\nTheir analysis of cross-cultural data was based on three assumptions:\nTheorists usually measured progression (that is, the difference between one stage and the next) in terms of increasing social complexity (including class differentiation and a complex division of labor), or an increase in intellectual, theological, and aesthetic sophistication. These 19th-century ethnologists used these principles primarily to explain differences in religious beliefs and kinship terminologies among various societies.\n\nThere were however notable differences between the work of Lester Frank Ward's and Tylor's approaches. Lester Frank Ward developed Spencer's theory but unlike Spencer, who considered the evolution to be general process applicable to the entire world, physical and sociological, Ward differentiated sociological evolution from biological evolution. He stressed that humans create goals for themselves and strive to realise them, whereas there is no such intelligence and awareness guiding the non-human world, which develops more or less at random. He created a hierarchy of evolution processes. First, there is cosmogenesis, creation and evolution of the world. Then, after life develops, there is biogenesis. Development of humanity leads to anthropogenesis, which is influenced by the human mind. Finally, when society develops, so does sociogenesis, which is the science of shaping the society to fit with various political, cultural and ideological goals.\n\nEdward Burnett Tylor, pioneer of anthropology, focused on the evolution of culture worldwide, noting that culture is an important part of every society and that it is also subject to the process of evolution. He believed that societies were at different stages of cultural development and that the purpose of anthropology was to reconstruct the evolution of culture, from primitive beginnings to the modern state.\n\nFerdinand Tönnies describes the evolution as the development from informal society, where people have many liberties and there are few laws and obligations, to modern, formal rational society, dominated by traditions and laws and are restricted from acting as they wish. He also notes that there is a tendency of standardization and unification, when all smaller societies are absorbed into the single, large, modern society. Thus Tönnies can be said to describe part of the process known today as the globalisation. Tönnies was also one of the first sociologists to claim that the evolution of society is not necessarily going in the right direction, that the social progress is not perfect, it can even be called a regress as the newer, more evolved societies are obtained only after paying a high costs, resulting in decreasing satisfaction of individuals making up that society. Tönnies' work became the foundation of neo-evolutionism.\n\nThe early 20th century inaugurated a period of systematic critical examination, and rejection of unilineal theories of cultural evolution. Cultural anthropologists such as Franz Boas, typically regarded as the leader of anthropology's rejection of classical social evolutionism, used sophisticated ethnography and more rigorous empirical methods to argue that Spencer, Tylor, and Morgan's theories were speculative and systematically misrepresented ethnographic data. Additionally, they rejected the distinction between \"primitive\" and \"civilized\" (or \"modern\"), pointing out that so-called primitive contemporary societies have just as much history, and were just as evolved, as so-called civilized societies. They therefore argued that any attempt to use this theory to reconstruct the histories of non-literate (i.e. leaving no historical documents) peoples is entirely speculative and unscientific. They observed that the postulated progression, a stage of civilization identical to that of modern Europe, is ethnocentric. They also pointed out that the theory assumes that societies are clearly bounded and distinct, when in fact cultural traits and forms often cross social boundaries and diffuse among many different societies (and is thus an important mechanism of change). Boas in his culture history approach focused on anthropological fieldwork in an attempt to identify factual processes instead of what he criticized as speculative stages of growth.\n\nLater critics observed that this assumption of firmly bounded societies was proposed precisely at the time when European powers were colonizing non-Western societies, and was thus self-serving. Many anthropologists and social theorists now consider unilineal cultural and social evolution a Western myth seldom based on solid empirical grounds. Critical theorists argue that notions of social evolution are simply justifications for power by the elites of society. Finally, the devastating World Wars that occurred between 1914 and 1945 crippled Europe's self-confidence. After millions of deaths, genocide, and the destruction of Europe's industrial infrastructure, the idea of progress seemed dubious at best.\n\nThus modern socio-cultural evolutionism rejects most of classical social evolutionism due to various theoretical problems:\n\nBecause social evolution was posited as a scientific theory, it was often used to support unjust and often racist social practices—particularly colonialism, slavery, and the unequal economic conditions present within industrialized Europe.\n\n"}

The genus includes two to four species depending on taxonomic interpretation; two are accepted by the \"Flora of North America\".\n\n\"Calycanthus\" plants are deciduous shrubs, growing tall and wide. The bright green leaves are opposite, entire, long and broad.\n\nThe bark has a strong camphor smell that is released when stems are scraped. The smell remains strong on twigs that have been stored several years in a dry environment.\n\nThe strongly scented flowers are produced from late spring through early autumn for \"C. occidentalis\", and April to July for \"C. floridus\". They are broad, with numerous dark red to burgundy to purplish brown tepals. Typical of the family Calycanthaceae, the flowers lack distinct sepals and petals, but instead have distinct spirals of tepals.\n\nThe lotus-shaped flowers can resemble a small magnolia flower. They are pollinated by beetles in the family Nitidulidae.\n\nThe fruit is an elliptical dry capsule 5–7 cm long, containing numerous seeds.\n\n\n\nBoth species of \"Calycanthus\" were used as a traditional medicinal plant by Native Americans. The indigenous peoples of California also used \"C. occidentalis\" in basketweaving and for arrow shafts.\nBoth \"Calycanthus\" species are cultivated as ornamental plants by plant nurseries, including in the United States and England.\n\n\"Calycanthus occidentalis\" is planted in traditional, native plant, and wildlife gardens, and for natural landscaping and habitat restoration projects, primarily in California and the Western United States. It was introduced into cultivation in 1831.\n\n\"v floridus\" is also planted in gardens, as a specimen shrub, or for hedges. The cultivar \"C.\" × \"raulstonii\" 'Hartlage Wine' has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. \n\nMark Catesby found it in the Piedmont woodlands of the British Province of Carolina in 1732. He described it, with its bark \"as odoriferous as cinnamon\", but did not name it. The colonial planters of the Carolinas transplanted it into their gardens, and the botanist Peter Collinson described it to Linnaeus and imported it into England from Charleston in the Province of South Carolina around 1756. \n\nCalycanthus oil, distilled from the flowers, is an essential oil used in some quality perfumes. The flowers of \"C. occidentalis\" have a spicy, sweet scent. The flowers of \"C. floridus\" were compared to a bubble-gum scent by one reference.\n\n"}

The action was approved unanimously by the Storting in the town of Elverum on 9 April 1940, after the Norwegian Royal Family, the Cabinet, and the Storting had evacuated Oslo to evade capture by German troops in the course of Operation \"Weserübung\" during World War II.\n\nThe authorization reads, in translated form:\nThe authorization is of historical significance because it allowed the Norwegian executive branch to \"assert\" legitimacy – even while in exile.\n\nThe authorization is controversial in that it constituted a complete abandonment of the legislative powers in Norway during the war. The issue was brought to the Supreme Court of Norway, which ruled that the authorization was legitimate and valid.\n\nCritics have stated that the authorization was invalid because there was no constitutional basis for the Storting to dissolve itself in such a manner. These critics also claim that Section 17 – which was invoked in the authorization – only authorized emergency powers within the areas of \"trade\", \"customs\", \"economy\" and \"police\" until the Storting could be seated again.\n\nIn any event, the legitimacy of the exiled government was to little extent called into question during the war, except by the Quisling government and the German occupying power. Tormod Otter Johansen, a professor with the University of Gothenburg's Law Department, later noted that \"It is not difficult to see the emergency during an occupation, and the resistance that the government and resistance movement felt necessary to engage in on the basis of this emergency. The legal argument for constitutional necessity seems pertinent to this case, since there can be no greater ‘constitutional’ threat than the occupation and dissolving of the existing state. The threat to human life and security by the occupants further motivated the use of emergency powers.\"\n"}

The race is sponsored by QuikTrip, along with the nonprofit organization Folds of Honor, and is run as the fifth race of the Cup Series. Brad Keselowski is the defending race winner.\n\nThis race was originally Atlanta's second race of the season and was run as a late season event for much of its history. From 1987 until 2001, the race was scheduled in November as the final race of the NASCAR season. From 2002 until 2008, the race was moved to October in favor of awarding the final race weekend to Homestead-Miami Speedway and became part of what is now the NASCAR Chase for the Championship in 2004. In 2009, Atlanta swapped fall race dates with Auto Club Speedway and the race was moved to Labor Day weekend. From 2011 onward, this has been Atlanta's only race date as its spring race was moved to Kentucky Speedway and run later in the year.\n\nIn the 2020 round of schedule changing, Atlanta's lone date became the fifth race of the year after previously serving as the second.\n\nFrom 1987 until 2001, the race was scheduled as the final race of the NASCAR season, and thus was typically the event in which the champion was decided. Several times, however, the championship had already been clinched prior to this race, rendering the race anti-climactic. In some cases, the championship would be decided the moment the points leader took the green flag to start the race – effectively clinching enough championship points by finishing last or better. Other times the championship might be decided early or mid-race, well before the checkered flag. For instance, in the 1993 race, Dale Earnhardt needed to finish 34th or better to mathematically clinch the championship. On lap 117 of 328, eight cars had dropped out of the race (including teammate Neil Bonnett in an intentional start and park). That meant Earnhardt could finish no worse than 34th, and had effectively clinched the title before the race had reached the halfway point.\n\nThe 1992 race marked the final race for Richard Petty, and coincidentally, the debut for Jeff Gordon. With six drivers eligible for the Winston Cup Championship, the race is widely regarded as one of the greatest NASCAR races of all time. Alan Kulwicki, who finished second in the race, edged out Bill Elliott, the race winner, by leading one more lap in the race. Kulwicki won the NASCAR Winston Cup title by a then-record margin of only 10 points.\n\nThe 1998 race was run mostly at night after a long rain delay; despite the inexperience with the lights, newly installed for an Indy Racing League race, NASCAR and the teams agreed to attempt finishing the race at night. It was shortened to 221 laps because it was after 11:00 p.m. EST and NASCAR wanted to \"get the fans out at a decent hour\". The 1999 Cracker Barrel 500 also ended at night. This would mark a springboard of sorts at finishing delayed races at night by utilizing a track's permanent lighting system.\n\nIn 2001, the race was scheduled as the season finale, however, it ended up being the second-to-last race. The New Hampshire 300 was postponed from September 16 to the Friday after Thanksgiving, due to 9/11. Beginning in 2002 the race was moved to mid-October as NASCAR elected to hold its final race at Homestead-Miami Speedway instead of Atlanta. The 2003 race started a tradition of night qualifying at Atlanta, which has carried over to the spring race as well.\n\nIn 2006, the race start time was changed from 12:40 pm. EDT to 2:55 pm. EDT to finish the race at night. Driver complaints erupted because of the track's troublesome situation where the sun can get into the driver's eyes in Turn 1, including leading to a crash during the time the sun sets in that area of the track between Jeff Gordon and Jamie McMurray, led to the abandonment of the 3 pm start after this race.\n\nIn 2009, the race was moved Labor Day weekend as part of a realignment agreement with Auto Club Speedway, which had received the Labor Day weekend race in 2004, and Talladega Superspeedway, where Talladega's fall race moved to the Atlanta race weekend and Fontana received a race in the Chase in Talladega's spot.\n\nIn 2015, Atlanta's lone race date moved to the second week of the season in early March, with the Bojangles' Southern 500 at Darlington Raceway returning to its traditional Labor Day weekend date. Atlanta will be run on a Sunday afternoon. This event used to be called the Oral-B USA 500, and this event used to be aired on ESPN for 6 years preceding the Irwin Tools Night Race at Bristol Motor Speedway and the Federated Auto Parts 400 at Richmond International Raceway\n\nDuring the race's history as the second at Atlanta, it had been rumored to be either eliminated or moved several times in recent years. Track owner Bruton Smith, president of Speedway Motorsports, Inc., was talking with International Speedway Corporation about a possible date switch with one of its tracks. On February 29, 2008, Smith proposed a move that involved the fall Atlanta race and the Pepsi 500, the Labor Day weekend race held at Auto Club Speedway. Doing so gave the Fontana, California track a race in the Chase for the Championship as well as return the Labor Day weekend race to the southern U.S. for the first time since the second-to-last Southern 500 was run. It also makes the three races that precede the beginning of the Chase closer to each other geographically. Prior to the realignment, the teams raced in the Sharpie 500 at Bristol the week before Labor Day, then traveled cross country for the Pepsi 500, then came back across the country to run the Chevy Rock & Roll 400 at Richmond the following Saturday.\n\nUltimately, NASCAR adjusted the schedule as announced on August 19, 2008 to allow the fall race at Atlanta and the Chase event to Fontana to be swapped, but also in the process moved the AMP Energy 500 at Talladega Superspeedway to Atlanta's old date — usually the last weekend in October — and the aforementioned Pepsi 500 was placed in the old Talladega date, the first weekend in October beginning in 2009.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2267869", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2267869", "title": "Multilineal evolution", "text": "Multilineal evolution\n\nMultilineal evolution is a 20th-century social theory about the evolution of societies and cultures. It is composed of many competing theories by various sociologists and anthropologists. This theory has replaced the older 19th century set of theories of unilineal evolution, where evolutionists were deeply interested in making generalizations.\n\nWhen critique of classical social evolutionism became widely accepted, modern anthropological and sociological approaches have changed to reflect their responses to the critique of their predecessor. Modern theories are careful to avoid unsourced, ethnocentric speculation, comparisons, or value judgements; more or less regarding individual societies as existing within their own historical contexts. These conditions provided the context for new theories such as cultural relativism and multilinear evolution, which criticizes the generalization of culture and hypothetical stages of evolution.\n\nAround 1940, a number of American anthropologists began rejecting the ideas of unilinear evolutionism and universal evolutionism, and began to move towards the idea of multilinear evolutionism. This theory focused around the process that culture moves forward down a number of paths consisting of different styles and lengths.\n\nBy mid-twentieth century, anthropologists started to criticize the generalization of culture and the hypothetical stages of cultural evolution, and instead, started a new trend of viewing all cultures as unique according to time and place.\n\nLeslie White rejected the opposition between \"primitive\" and \"modern\" societies but did argue that societies could be distinguished based on the amount of energy they harnessed, and that increased energy allowed for greater social differentiation. White thought in broad, universal schemes, while anthropologists such as Julian Steward preferred to use a more limited, multilinear strategy. Steward rejected the 19th century notion of progress, and instead called attention to the Darwinian notion of \"adaptation,\" arguing that all societies had to adapt to their environment in some way, but that the process could differ between cultures. Julian Steward thus linked multilinear evolution with the idea of cultural ecology.\n\nAnthropologists Marshall Sahlins and Elman Service wrote a book, \"Evolution and Culture\", in which they attempted to synthesize White's and Steward's approaches. Sahlins and Service argue that societies develop through a process of specialized adaptions to their habitat and neighbouring societies, and that variations in environments and historical contacts are what leads to cultural diversification.\n\nCultural evolution had previously been treated much like biological evolution, but many anthropologists were quick to dismiss this comparison. Steward wrote that unlike biological evolution, in cultural evolution it is assumed that cultural patterns in different parts of the world are genetically unrelated, and yet they were said in unilinear evolution to pass through parallel sequences. Sahlins and Service also dismissed this comparison, stating that cultural variation could be transmitted between different lines by diffusion, where biological evolution cannot.\n\nThe multilineal evolutionary theory views the process of cultural development as an adaption to nature's resources through technological breakthroughs, as well as coping with outside cultural influence. Through this adaptation process, cultures form new traits called \"inventions,\" and new items are made available from outside cultures through \"diffusion.\" While each anthropologist's theory regarding multilineal evolution has varied slightly, most agreed that no specific evolutionary changes are experienced by all cultures universally, but that all human societies do generally evolve or progress.\n\nOther anthropologists, such as Peter Vayda and Roy Rappaport, have gone on to build or respond to work done by White and Steward, such as developing theories of cultural ecology and ecological anthropology. By the late 1950s, students of Steward such as Eric Wolf and Sidney Mintz turned away from cultural ecology to Marxism, World Systems Theory, Dependency theory and Marvin Harris's cultural materialism. \n\nToday most anthropologists continue to reject 19th century notions of progress and the three original assumptions of unilineal evolution. Following Steward, they take seriously the relationship between a culture and its environment in attempts to explain different aspects of a culture. But most modern cultural anthropologists have adopted a general systems approach, examining cultures as emergent systems and argue that one must consider the whole social environment, which includes political and economic relations among cultures. There are still others who continue to reject the entirety of the evolutionary thinking and look instead at historical contingencies, contacts with other cultures, and the operation of cultural symbol systems. As a result, the simplistic notion of 'cultural evolution' has grown less useful and given way to an entire series of more nuanced approaches to the relationship of culture and environment. In the area of development studies, authors such as Amartya Sen have developed an understanding of 'development' and 'human flourishing' that also question more simplistic notions of progress, while retaining much of their original inspiration.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2267870", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2267870", "title": "Baháʼí Esperanto League", "text": "Baháʼí Esperanto League\n\nThe Baháʼí Esperanto League (BEL) is the official organization of Baháʼís who are Esperantists. It was founded on 19 March 1973 with the approval of the Universal House of Justice.\n\nThe Baháʼí Faith advocates the introduction of an international auxiliary language which, together with the mother tongue, would be taught in all the schools of the world (\"see Baháʼí Faith and auxiliary language\"). This is one of the prerequisites of Baháʼu'lláh for the unification of mankind, the establishment of lasting peace and the advancement of human culture.\n\nThus it is not surprising that the relationship of the Baháʼí community to the Esperanto movement has a long history. Esperanto was highly praised by ʻAbdu'l-Bahá. From the time of its introduction until the present time, many Baháʼís have learned the language and actively supported the Esperanto movement.\n\nBaháʼu'lláh has left it to the governments of the world to decide upon the question of a common script and to choose the international language from among the existing national tongues or to create a new language specially for this purpose. For this reason Baháʼís tend to place emphasis on the urgency of introducing such a language rather than giving direct support to Esperanto or to any other one language.\n\nBahaʼu'lláh himself in the Sixth Ishraq calls on the Universal House of Justice to decide the language question: “In former epistles We have enjoined upon Trustees of the House of Justice either to choose one language from among those now existing or to adopt a new one…” And, this institution itself in its letter of 8 June 1980 has expanded: “On the one hand this task is given to the governments of the world, on the other it is given to the House of Justice.” The selection question is probably ergo a process in at least two parts resting with – (1) the supreme governing body of the Bahaʼis of the world (Haifa) and (2) as stated on the last page of the Kitab-i-Aqdas with the parliaments of the world.\n\nAs Baháʼí texts etc. on this vast subject are many and deep and as they refer positively in various places to five tongues - Arabic, English, Esperanto, Persian and Spanish - one can easily accept why the very next sentence of that 1980 letter explains: \"It is not possible now to see how this will come about...\" What requires little intellectual discussion is how often and pleadingly ʻAbdu'l-Baha asked 'every one of us to study Esperanto' whether or not it becomes universal and how Shoghi Effendi interpreted all that as 'repeated and emphatic admonitions of ʻAbdu'l-Bahá.' The whole language question however is similar to what the essence of religion has ever been - a spiritual and mystical matter over and above any intellectual dimension. When this overarching Bahaʼi principle is systematically and widely consulted on this process will be better understood and disputes re the selection question avoided because whether English will remain dominant or whether Mandarin will become dominant are as ephemeral questions as which national language of the 19th century was dominant. Such puerile disputes will evaporate when the principle of a universal auxiliary language is properly discussed and understood.\n\nIn the 1920s and 30s certain notable Baháʼís such as Martha Root, Lidia Zamenhof and Hermann Grossmann — the founder of the Baháʼí Esperanto magazine \"La Nova Tago\" — were active in the Esperanto movement. After the Second World War, the office of the Baháʼí International Community in Geneva was able to continue this activity, but only for a few years. In the 1950s and 60s the task was again taken over by individuals such as Adelbert Mühlschlegel and Roan Orloff-Stone. As a natural outcome of this, the Baháʼí Esperanto League was founded at the beginning of the 1970s, thus placing the activities of the Baháʼí Esperantists on a broader foundation.\n\nThere are signs that the idea of forming a collaboration of Baháʼí Esperantists was beginning to grow even at the beginning of the 1960s, particularly at the time immediately before the Esperanto World Congress in Budapest in 1966. Adelbert Mühlschlegel made efforts to bring this about but initially not very much was achieved. It was not until Paulo Amorim Cardoso accepted the faith in Brazil in 1971 that, with his help and that of Roan Orloff-Stone in the USA, the idea of a collaboration began, with surprising speed, to change into a viable project.\n\nIn a letter of July 1971 Cardoso, who at that time was secretary of the Local Spiritual Assembly of Fortaleza in Brazil, wrote, on behalf of that Assembly, that \"it is our intention to create an international Baháʼí Esperanto organisation\". With this letter he included a first draft of the constitution of the proposed organisation in which its main aims were defined, namely, the publication of Baháʼí literature in Esperanto, the dissemination of the Baháʼí Faith amongst the Esperantists and the promotion of Esperanto in the Baháʼí Community. He also enclosed with his letter a list (all together 18 names) of Baháʼí Esperantists in Brazil (8), India (1), Spain (1), Iran (1), Portugal (1) and the USA (6). It is very likely that Cardoso's letter was addressed to these 18 people. Also enclosed with his letter was another list, compiled by Roan Orloff-Stone, that contained the names and addresses in 13 different countries of 47 further persons, almost half of them being in the USA. In addition Cardoso began to produce and distribute a newsletter entitled \"\"Komuna Bahaa Letero\"\" (\"Communal Baháʼí Newsletter\"), which later grew into the official BEL Newsletter. It was then during the 57th Esperanto World Congress in Portland, Oregon (USA), that the nine participating Baháʼís consulted together and decided to write to the Universal House of Justice to seek its approval for the founding of a Baháʼí Esperanto organisation. After consulting with \"Hand of the Cause of God\" Adelbert Mühlschlegel, who according to them was \"enthusiastic\" about this proposal, the Universal House of Justice gave their consent in a letter dated 19 March 1973 (18.19.129 BE), a date which effectively marks the birth of the Baháʼí Esperanto League. In issue No. 5 (April 1973) of \"\"Komuna Bahaa Letero\"\" the House of Justice's consent was announced to all the Baháʼí Esperantists who were known to the initiators of the project. Simultaneously, application forms for membership in the League were sent out, together with voting slips for the election of the League's first managing committee.\n\nThis election was conducted according to the same principles that are applied when a Local Spiritual Assembly is elected (each member voted for nine persons from the body of all members, without the nomination of any candidates). In a message from the League, dated 30 July 1973, the result of the election, in which a total of 30 members had taken part, was announced: Paulo Amorim Cardoso (Brazil), Roan Orloff-Stone (USA), Habib Taherzadeh (Israel/Baháʼí World Centre), Adelbert Mühlschlegel (Switzerland), Badiollah Samimy (Iran), Manuel de Freitas (Portugal), S.C. Gupta (India), Chagzin Kim (Korea), Leonora Stirling Armstrong (Brazil). The term of office of the governing committee was fixed at three years. In issue No. 9 (November 1973) of the \"Komuna Bahaa Letero\" it was announced that \"BEL now has 73 members in 14 countries: USA 27, Brazil 24, Canada 4, Iran 4, Spain 3, Italy 2, Portugal 2, Argentina 1, Austria 1, Germany 1, Israel 1, Korea 1, The Netherlands 1, Switzerland 1\". And in the following issue, No. 10 (January 1974), it was announced: \"Here are the names of the first managing committee of our dearly beloved Baháʼí Esperanto League: Chairman: Adelbert Mühlschlegel (Germany), Vice-chairman: Habib Taherzadeh (Israel), Secretary: Paulo Amorim Cardoso (Brazil), Vice-secretary: Roan Orloff-Stone (USA), Treasurer: Manuel de Freitas (Portugal), Vice-treasurer: Leonora Stirling-Armstrong (Brazil)\". It was also announced that, in accordance with an earlier decision, all those who had become members up to the time of the election of the first managing committee would automatically be regarded as the founding members of BEL; there were 80 such members in 17 different countries.\n\nApart from the task of gaining new members, one of the first activities of the League was the publication of basic Baháʼí information in Esperanto. The League also turned its attention to the question of Baháʼí terminology in Esperanto, for example the names of the 19 months of the Baháʼí Calendar (with issue No. 15 of the \"Komuna Bahaa Letero\", May 1975, a calendar was enclosed, in which the Baháʼí and Gregorian calendars were placed side by side). The League also applied to the World Esperanto Association (\"Universala Esperanto-Asocio\", UEA) for official recognition of BEL as a \"\"kunlaboranta faka asocio\"\" (a cooperating specialised subgroup) of UEA. BEL's application for this status was accepted at the World Esperanto Congress in the following year.\n\nIn spite of the successes they had, for the new League the first few years were not easy. Not only were the individual members widely scattered throughout the world, but the members of the managing committee as well. This geographical separation inhibited joint action so that most of the activities were carried out by individuals and were often initiated by the BEL secretary himself. The first secretary was Paulo Amorim Cardoso (Brazil). His work was augmented by Roan Orloff-Stone (USA), who made a significant contribution towards the development of the League and attended all the Esperanto World Congresses between 1976 and 1988. With such a driving force as this, supported by the efforts of a few other dedicated members, the Baháʼí Faith was well represented at each of these Congresses.\n\nIn 1976, John T. Dale took over the secretaryship of BEL. Like his predecessor, P.A. Cardoso, he did great deal in moulding the character of the League. He contributed numerous ideas towards the development of BEL and initiated a series of projects, many of which were concerned with the publication of new material. He also took on the task of editing the BEL Newsletter, to which he gave the new name \"\"BELmonda Letero\"\". The name may be translated as \"BEL World Letter\", but the Esperanto pun on the first word (\"belmonda\" means \"beautiful world\") is lost in translation.\n\nEven after the initial founding years, the League went on being handicapped by the problem of geographical separation; the managing committee itself was unable to make personal acquaintance with the majority of the BEL members. On top of all this, in 1979, contact with the Baháʼí Esperantists in Iran (there had been 16 on the election list of 1976) had to be broken off because, in the wake of the Islamic Revolution, correspondence with the West would have been dangerous for these members.\n\nOne of the main tasks to which John Dale, in his capacity as secretary, dedicated himself \"was to rectify the widespread misunderstanding on the part of Baháʼís of the Esperanto language\". He found that the many of them favoured English as the future world language; others regarded Esperanto as the ideal candidate for this role but were not willing to learn it before a specific request to do so had come from the Universal House of Justice. \"To overcome such misunderstanding of and resistance towards the activities of BEL, I took upon myself the following tasks: (1) to compile quotations from the Baháʼí Writings about Esperanto and the language problem; ... (2) to collect Baháʼí-Esperanto documents and to translate various Baháʼí texts into Esperanto; ... (3) to produce and distribute information material and basic documents in English and Esperanto as an aid towards making BEL better known among both Baháʼís and Esperantists.\"\n\nThe translation of John Esslemont's \"Baháʼu'lláh and the New Era\" — the most widely known introduction to the Baháʼí Faith — into Esperanto had been initiated by Martha Root and carried to completion by Lidia Zamenhof. The reissuing in 1978 of this translation, \"\"Baháʼu'lláh kaj la Nova Epoko\"\", after revision, additions and the inclusion of an appendix was certainly one of the greatest successes of this period.\n\nFurthermore in 1976, under the editorship of John Dale, BEL published the brochure \"\"Unueco kaj universala lingvo\"\" (Unity and Universal Language) in four languages (Portuguese, Spanish, Esperanto and the original English). This was followed in 1977 by the brochure \"\"Bahaaj Respondoj\"\" (Baháʼí Answers) and in 1981 by \"\"La Kaŝitaj Vortoj\"\" (The Hidden Words), one of the central Writings of Baháʼu'lláh. In 1979 Dale also sent a letter, enclosing a copy of the \"\"BELmonda Letero\"\", to all National Spritiual Assemblies in order to make the existence of BEL better known to seek the cooperation of the national Baháʼí communities. Dale also wrote to the Universal House of Justice, requesting it \"to consider ways and means of experimentally introducing Esperanto and encouraging the Baháʼís to learn the language.\"\n\nA similar request had been made earlier by Cardoso. But again the attempt was in vain. The Universal House of Justice did not change its standpoint: although very much sympathising with the aims of the Baháʼí-Esperanto movement, it was opposed to the unofficial introduction of Esperanto (even if only temporary) into the Baháʼí Community, stressing that it was the principle of an international auxiliary language rather any one concrete proposal that Baháʼís supported. At that time Cardoso had been so disappointed that all his efforts were bearing no fruit that he left the Faith a few years later.\n\nDuring the second half of the 1980s, the centre of activity began to shift away from the Americas to Western Europe, Germany in particular, and it was during this time the League began to prosper. One reason behind this was that amongst the Baháʼís Esperanto had acquired the reputation of being an \"entrance ticket\" to countries behind the so-called Iron Curtain, countries to which the Baháʼí Faith had had no access during the preceding decades. In this connection, the Esperanto World Congress in Beijing in 1986, in which about a dozen BEL members from nearly as many different countries took part, and in the following the Centenary Congress in Warsaw in 1987, which was attended by an unprecedented number of Baháʼís (about 50 from 20 different countries).\n\nIn addition to the nucleus of the League, Baháʼí-Esperanto committees or subsidiary groups in Germany, the USA, Great Britain and Switzerland (in 1993 Bulgaria joined them) were set up in the past and in part are still functioning today. Following the \"\"Internacia Junulara Kongreso\"\" (IJK, International Youth Congress) in Kraków, Poland, in 1987, the League was even able to found a youth section, known as JuBEL, which for several years afterwards was able to arrange that young Baháʼí Esperantists took part in the annual International Youth Congresses (IJK) and that Baháʼí items were included in the congress programmes.\n\nAt the end of the 1980s and the beginning of the 1990s BEL was also able to organise a series of several-day seminars on the Faith, the so-called \"BELaj Tagoj\" (BEL Days or \"Beautiful Days\"), three of which took place in Poland and one each in Bulgaria and the Slovak Republic. And in 1992, Roman Dobrzynski, a Polish journalist and the then Vice-President of the UEA (Universala Esperanto-Asocio: Universal Esperanto Association), presented, during the Esperanto World Congress in Vienna, the Esperanto version of his film on the Faith and the Baháʼí World Centre in Haifa, Israel, entitled \"Ŝafejo de la Naŭa Profeto\" (Sheepfold of the Ninth Prophet).\n\nProgress was also made in the publication of Baháʼí Esperanto literature; for example the two attractive brochures with colour printing: \"\"La Vojo al Paco\"\" (The Way to Peace) and \"\"La Bahaa Kredo\"\" (The Baháʼí Religion), as well as the very important publication entitled \"\"La Promeso de Monda Paco\"\" (The Promise of World Peace). In 1989 BEL made a significant contribution towards the publication of the well-known compilation by O.P. Ghai entitled \"Unueco en Diverseco\" (Unity in Diversity). And in 1992 BEL was also able to publish a small selection from the Writings of Baháʼu'lláh entitled \"Perloj de l'Saĝo\" (Pearls of Wisdom).\n\nNot long after John T. Dale had tried to develop and more widely distribute the \"BELmonda Letero\", it shrank to a modest circular letter of 2 to 6 pages. It continues to function as the newsletter for all BEL members and is automatically distributed to them subscription-free. It contains membership information, important addresses, statements from the managing committee, news of activities in different countries and extracts from the Baháʼí Writings. It has become an important instrument of communication within the worldwide BEL community.\n\nThe membership of BEL increased over the years to more than 400, but an evaluation of the membership figures at the beginning of the 1990s showed that it had dropped to about half this number. As of 2005, BEL had 410 members in 64 countries. Most of the BEL members at that time were to be found in Bulgaria (59), Germany (56), the USA (45), Russia (35) and Great Britain (21). Right from the beginning, no membership charges were collected and, except for some donations from single National Spiritual Assemblies and other Baháʼí sources, the activities of the League were financed by voluntary contributions from its members.\n\nIn the last few years, BEL has concentrated on active participation in the Esperanto World Congresses, on the occasional publication of Baháʼí articles in Esperanto magazines, and on the translation of important Baháʼí documents: some in their entirety such as \"\"La Promeso de Monda Paco\"\" (The Promise of World Peace) in 1996, \"Baháʼu'lláh\" in 1992; others in the form of summaries such as in 1996 \"\"La prospero de la homaro\"\" (The Prosperity of Mankind) and \"\"Turnopunkto por Ĉiuj Nacioj\"\" (Turning Point for All Nations).\n\nFrom time to time, BEL also tries to inform the Baháʼí world community about the Esperanto language and the Esperanto movement.\n\nTo celebrate the twenty-fifth anniversary of the founding of the League, a brochure of about 60 pages was published, with the title \"\"Bahaismo kaj Esperanto. Festlibro okaze de la dudekkvinjariĝo de la Bahaa Esperanto-Ligo\"\" (Bahaism and Esperanto. Commemorative Volume for the Twenty-fifth Anniversary of the Baháʼí Esperanto League). In this brochure, BEL looks back on a long history of the relationship and the cooperation between Baháʼís and Esperantists. The congratulatory openings by the Presidents of the Universal Esperanto Association (UEA) and of BEL itself are followed by Bernhard Westerhoff's essay on the changing, and not always completely harmonious, relationship between the Baháʼís and the Esperantists. This is followed by two essays by and about Lidia Zamenhof, which show how the youngest daughter of Zamenhof found her spiritual home in the Baháʼí Religion. Several central Baháʼí texts on both the question of the international language generally and Esperanto in particular — including a recent recommendation from the Baháʼís that the UNO should adopt an international language — are used to illustrate the Baháʼí point of view on this subject. A lengthy essay casts light on the historical growth of the relationship between Baháʼís and Esperantists, presents biographical sketches of prominent Baháʼí Esperantists and describes the development of BEL. Finally an introduction to the Baháʼí Faith and an overview of Baháʼí literature in Esperanto rounds off this 60-page booklet.\n\nOne BEL project, initiated by John Dale, is the publication of a compilation of texts from the Baháʼí Writings, concerning the principle an international auxiliary language. This project was later taken over by Bernhard Westerhoff and then passed on to Gregory Paul Meyjes, who in 2015 first published an annotated collection of Baha'i excerpts on the auxiliary language in English, which was followed by a translation in Esperanto in 2019.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2267876", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2267876", "title": "Employee assistance program", "text": "Employee assistance program\n\nAn employee assistance program (EAP) is an employee benefit program that assists employees with personal problems and/or work-related problems that may impact their job performance, health, mental and emotional well-being. EAPs generally offer free and confidential assessments, short-term counseling, referrals, and follow-up services for employees. EAP counselors may also work in a consultative role with managers and supervisors to address employee and organizational challenges and needs. Many corporations, academic institution and/or government agencies are active in helping organizations prevent and cope with workplace violence, trauma, and other emergency response situations. There is a variety of support programs offered for employees. Even though EAPs are mainly aimed at work-related issues, there are a variety of programs that can assist with problems outside of the workplace. EAPs have grown in popularity over the years, and are more desirable economically and socially.\n\nEAPs have their origins in the late 1930s, and were formed out of programs that dealt with occupational alcoholism. During a time when drinking on the job was the norm, people began to notice the effects it had on job performance and productivity. This became a major issue for industrial jobs and would become the main focus for correction with job-based alcoholism programs. By 1939, the Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) movement had begun to spread throughout the Midwestern and Northeastern United States. People in “recovery\" began to eagerly share their experiences with other workers. This would be the start of the EAP movement. Businesses also started to see the effectiveness of the programs through the rehabilitation of their workers and the rise of productivity. These improvements sparked the thought of what other types of problems this program could address.\n\nIn 1962, The Kemper Group introduced a program to address alcoholic rehabilitation and later expanded the program to address the needs of the families of their employees as well. Including the families broaden the programs services to deal with marital, emotional, financial, legal, and drug abuse problems. In 1969, Senator Harold Hughes would introduce a bill called The Hughes Act. Sen. Hughes felt that there was a great lack of federal and state involvement in the treatment of alcoholism. In 1970, Congress would pass the Federal Comprehensive Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism Prevention Treatment and Rehabilitation Act creating the National Institute on Alcoholism and Alcohol Abuse (NIAAA). States would then soon begin to follow suit and denounce public intoxication and began treating alcoholism as a disease. The NIAAA priority would be to begin researching and treating alcoholism. They were also focused on providing states with grants to hire and train EAP specialist.\n\nIn the 1970s, the Occupational Alcoholism Bureau formed by the National Council on Alcoholism (NCA) and the Association of Labor and Management Administrators and Consultants on Alcoholism (ALMACA) helped to spread EAP concepts. They did this by distributing information, giving conferences and seminars, increasing the knowledge of professionals and the community. A number of treatment centers would also grow after the passing of the Hughes Act. These centers have EAP specialist on site to help in the rehabilitation processes. It is not known the exact amount of treatment centers in the United States.\n\nEmployee Assistance Programs would see a significant shift during the economic crisis of the 1980s. During this time, the government was forced to create cutbacks for programs. This would cause for mental health public agencies, treatment centers, and private counseling firms to survive by partnering with industry wanting to enter the EAP field. This though would also cause the effectiveness of the programs to come into question. The cutbacks began to affect the training of the EAP specialist and their effectiveness. The situations of workers also began to change at this time. People were also having to wait in lines, and were having to search for work due to the crisis.\n\nIn most recent years, the services provided by EAPs have changed in their direction. With events occurring in the United States and around the world has caused for EAPs to rise and the need for them greater in the United States. EAPs have also been affected by technology, terrorism attacks, natural disasters, disabilities act, and workplace violence. Since the events of September 11, 2001, EAP specialists have become more involved in incident debriefing and implementing plans during emergencies Providers began to report more on the workforce experiencing Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), and an increase in occupational stress and depression.\n\nSome studies indicate that offering EAPs may result in various benefits for employers, including lower medical costs, reduced turnover and absenteeism, and higher employee productivity. Critics of these studies question the scientific validity of their findings, noting small sample sizes, lack of experimental control groups, and lack of standardized measures as primary concerns. Proponents, however, argue that the consistency of positive findings across studies in different service sectors denote at least some positive effect of programs, even if the most effective components of such programs have not been determined. EAPs may also provide other services to employers, such as supervisory consultations, support to troubled work teams, training and education programs, and critical incident services.\n\nThe provision of employee assistance services has established business benefits, including increased productivity of employees, and a decrease in both presenteeism and absenteeism. Employees typically have access to an EAP hotline 24 hours a day, so there is no need to wait to seek assistance. If an appointment with a medical professional or counselor is necessary, the employee can arrange to see one in just a few days. Because the employee can call anytime, they do not have to worry about calling from a work phone. You may also be able to minimize the cost of your health insurance plan, because employees can use the EAP to ward off stress-related illnesses, meaning fewer trips to the doctor.\n\nSmall businesses can especially benefit from EAP programs. Even though they may have fewer employees and may not see the need to implement an EAP program, small business owner's bottom line can suffer quicker due to decreased performance and productivity and workplace negativity. A small company could be severely damaged if they do not seek effective measure to rectify such issues. An employer that provides an effective, full-service EAP can help both themselves and employees by lowering risk and liability, improving employee satisfaction, and especially decreasing the stress small business owners experience when managing numerous responsibilities with little support.\n\nBenefits of EAP are:\n\nEmployees and their family members may use EAPs to help manage issues in their personal lives. EAP counselors typically provide assessment, support, and referrals to additional resources such as counselors for a limited number of program-paid counseling sessions. The issues for which EAPs provide support vary, but examples include:\n\nAn EAP's services are usually free to the employee and their household members, having been prepaid by the employer. In most cases, an employer contracts with a third-party company to manage its EAP. Some of these companies rely upon other vendors or contracted employees for specialized services to supplement their own services, such as: financial advisors, attorneys, travel agents, elder/child care specialists, and the like.\n\nConfidentiality is maintained in accordance with privacy laws and ethical standards.\n\nIn the United States, California requires EAP providers who deliver actual counseling services on a pre-paid basis for more than 3 sessions within any six-month period to have a Knox-Keene license. This is a specialty license for psychological services and is mandated by the Knox-Keene Health Care Service Plan Act of 1975. The state's Department of Managed Health Care regulates these licensed plans and assists consumers with regard to grievances, access to quality care, and ensuring that the EAP has an appropriate level of tangible net equity to deliver services to plan members. Title 28, Rule 1300.43.14 of the California Code of Regulations allows EAPs without a Knox-Keene license to request an exemption if they solely refer callers to external services and do not provide the actual services themselves.\n\nEach Federal Executive Branch agency has an Employee Assistance Program (EAP). An EAP is a voluntary, confidential program that helps employees (including management) work through various life challenges that may adversely affect job performance, health, and personal well-being to optimize an organization's success. EAP services include assessments, counseling, and referrals for additional services to employees with personal and/or work-related concerns, such as stress, financial issues, legal issues, family problems, office conflicts, and alcohol and substance abuse. EAPs also often work with management and supervisors providing advanced planning for situations, such as organizational changes, legal considerations, emergency planning, and response to unique traumatic events. EAP’s can reap benefits for agencies, employees, families and communities. Some of those aspects that we will be focusing on are: the improvement of productivity and employee engagement, improving employees’ and dependents’ abilities to successfully respond to challenges, developing employee and manager competencies in managing workplace stress, reducing workplace absenteeism and unplanned absences, supporting employees and managers during workforce restructuring, reduction-in-forces, or other workforce change events, reducing workplace accidents, reducing the likelihood of workplace violence or other safety risks, supporting disaster and emergency preparedness, managing the effect of disruptive incidents, such as workplace, injury, or other crises, facilitating safe, timely, and effective return-to-work for employees short-term and extended absences, reducing healthcare costs associated with stress, depression, and other mental health issues, reducing employee turnover and related replacement costs.\n\nThere are a variety of employee assistance programs in the military, ranging from financial assistance programs, family counseling, depression, and transitional assistance programs. One of the largest military employee assistance organizations is Military One Source. Military One Source offers both services directly to service members and their families, but can also help send people to places in the community if there is a specific need. If someone is in need of assistance and is: an active duty service member, family member of a service member, a veteran, or family member of a veteran, they can find additional information about the assistance programs offered by Military One Source on their website.\n\nIn the last couple decades military employee assistance programs have expanded greatly. What started as alcohol assistance programs has grown to help people with financial issues, physical health, family health, and since 2000 mental health programs have expanded rapidly as more has become known about Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), and Traumatic Brain Injuries (TBI). There are several programs for families, and increasing assistance for dual military families, families in which both spouses are active duty military, as they have grown dramatically in number. Financial programs have been expanded as well, as payday loan establishments grew in popularity in the 2000s; and as a result, debt among military members has grown as well. The Navy-Marine Corps Relief Society (NMCRS), is a program started by military members to help other members that have fallen into debt, and has expanded to also help service members reach educational goals. This society has helped many service members, as a service member can borrow up to 300 dollars without a reason, and more with a valid reason for either no interest or low interest depending on how much and how long they borrow for. The Navy-Marine Corps Relief Society has helped many members of the military when unforeseen problems arise. More information on the Navy-Marine Corps Relief Society can be found at: www.nmcrs.org.\n\nOne of the largest veteran employee assistance programs is the Veterans Affairs (VA). The VA provides a variety of services to veterans including: health care, education assistance, transitional housing assistance, mental health, financial assistance, women veterans assistance, and career search assistance. The Veteran Affairs is a nationwide system that offers their services to all veterans who attained any discharge other than dishonorable. More information on Veterans Affairs can be found at: www.va.gov.\n\n\n\n\nProfessional associations in the employee assistance program industry:\n"}

The term was first used in this sense, perhaps by J. R. R. Tolkien, during the mid-twentieth century and derives from the (\"phōnē\", \"voice-sound\") plus the (\"aisthētikē\", \"aesthetic\"). Speech sounds have many aesthetic qualities, some of which are subjectively regarded as euphonious (pleasing) or cacophonous (displeasing). Phonaesthetics remains a budding and often subjective field of study, with no scientifically or otherwise formally established definition; today, it mostly exists as a marginal branch of psychology, phonetics, or poetics.\n\nMore broadly, phonaesthetics refers to the study of \"phonaesthesia\": sound symbolism. For instance, the British linguist David Crystal, who has compiled research on popular perceptions of beautiful-sounding English words, regards phonaesthetics as the \"study of aesthetic properties of sounds, especially the sound symbolism attributable to individual sounds\". For example, English-speakers tend to associate unpleasantness with the sound \"sl-\" in such words as \"sleazy\", \"slime\", \"slug\", and \"slush\", or to associate formless repetition \nwith \"-tter\" in such words as \"chatter\", \"glitter\", \"flutter\", and \"shatter\".\n\nEuphony is the effect of sounds being perceived as pleasant, rhythmical, lyrical, or harmonious. Cacophony is the effect of sounds being perceived as harsh, unpleasant, chaotic, and often discordant; these sounds are perhaps meaningless and jumbled together. Compare with consonance and dissonance in music. In poetry, for example, euphony may be used deliberately to convey comfort, peace, or serenity, while cacophony may be used to convey discomfort, pain, or disorder. This is often furthered by the combined effect of the meaning beyond just the sounds themselves.\n\nThe California Federation of Chaparral Poets, Inc. uses Emily Dickinson's \"A Bird Came Down the Walk\" as an example of euphonious poetry, one passage being \"...Oars divide the Ocean, / Too silver for a seam\" and John Updike's \"Player Piano\" as an example of cacophonous poetry, one passage being \"My stick fingers click with a snicker / And, chuckling, they knuckle the keys\".\n\nDavid Crystal's 1995 paper \"Phonaesthetically Speaking\" explores lists, created by reader polls and individual writers, of English words that are commonly regarded as sounding beautiful, to search for any patterns within the words' phonetics. Frequently recurring example words in these lists include \"gossamer\", \"melody\", and \"tranquil\". Crystal's findings, assuming a British Received Pronunciation accent, is that words perceived as pretty tend to have a majority of a wide array of criteria; here are some major ones:\nA perfect example word, according to these findings, is \"tremulous\". Crystal also suggests the invented words \"ramelon\" and \"drematol\" , which he notes are similar to the types of names often employed in the marketing of pharmaceutical drugs.\n\nThe English compound noun \"cellar door\" has been widely cited as an example of a word or phrase that is beautiful purely in terms of its sound (i.e., euphony) without regard for its meaning. The phenomenon of \"cellar door\" being regarded as euphonious appears to have begun in the very early twentieth century, first attested in the 1903 novel \"Gee-Boy\" by the Shakespeare scholar Cyrus Lauron Hooper, and it has been promoted as beautiful-sounding by various writers; linguist Geoffrey Nunberg specifically names the writers H. L. Mencken in 1920; David Allan Robertson in 1921; Dorothy Parker, Hendrik Willem van Loon, and Albert Payson Terhune in the 1930s; George Jean Nathan in 1935; J. R. R. Tolkien as early as a 1955 speech titled \"English and Welsh\"; and C. S. Lewis in 1963. Furthermore, the phenomenon itself is touched upon in many sources and media, including a 1905 issue of \"Harper's Magazine\" by William Dean Howells, the 1967 novel \"Why Are We in Vietnam?\" by Norman Mailer, a 1991 essay by Jacques Barzun, and the 2001 psychological drama film \"Donnie Darko\".\n\nThe origin of \"cellar door\" being considered as an inherently beautiful or musical word is mysterious. However, in 2014, Nunberg speculated that the phenomenon might have arisen from Philip Wingate and Henry W. Petrie's 1894 hit song \"I Don't Want to Play in Your Yard\", which contains the lyric \"You'll be sorry when you see me sliding down our cellar door\". Following the song's success, \"slide down my cellar door\" became a popular catchphrase up until the 1930s or 1940s to mean engaging in a type of friendship or camaraderie reminiscent of childhood innocence. A 1914 essay about Edgar Allan Poe's choice of the word \"Nevermore\" in his 1845 poem \"The Raven\" as being based on euphony may have spawned an unverified legend, propagated by syndicated columnists like Frank Colby in 1949 and L. M. Boyd in 1979, that \"cellar door\" was Poe's favorite phrase. \n\nTolkien, Lewis, and others have suggested that \"cellar door\"'s auditory beauty becomes more apparent the more the word is dissociated from its literal meaning, for example, by using alternative spellings such as \"Selador\" or \"Selladore\", which take on the quality of an enchanting name (and both of which suggest a specifically British pronunciation of the word: ).\n\n\n"}

In cases where patients are at high risk of developing a clinically significant PE and cannot be sufficiently anticoagulated, placement of an IVC filter may be recommended.\n\nTo date, there has been only one randomized controlled trial completed on IVC filters. This study found that IVC filters reduced the incidence of PE but increased the incidence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). All patients were on anticoagulation drugs during the study. Results from the PREPIC study and other studies which have shown many long-term complications of IVC filters led to the introduction of retrievable IVC filters.

The Mobin-Uddin filter was later replaced by the Greenfield filter developed by Lazar Greenfield which had a lower rate of filter related complications.\n\nWhile the ability to retrieve a filter does exist for many models, it cannot be guaranteed that all cases of filter placement will allow for, or be indicated for retrieval. Thus, the requirements and indications for permanent placement of filters is used to decide on when to use both permanent and temporary IVC filters.\n\nLong-term risk factors must be considered as well, to include life expectancy of more than six months following insertion, and the ability of the patient to comply with anticoagulation therapy. The decision to use a filter that is temporary vs permanent basically is tied to the expected duration of time that protection is needed to prevent pulmonary emboli from passing to the heart and lungs. One such guideline is outlined below:\n\n\nWhile many studies have been done on the efficacy of Vena Cava filters, there still have not been any major studies done on the actual placement and removal of the filters regarding standard guidelines. Which is why the Society of Interventional Radiology created a multidisciplinary panel that developed the following guidelines to see if someone qualifies for implantation:\n\nThese are patients that should strongly consider having IVC filter placement, as they are at greatest risk of pulmonary embolus.\n\nThis is a maybe category; normally it represents patients who could benefit from an IVC filter, but may be just fine without one as well.\n\nThese are usually very controversial reasons to do an IVC filter, and most radiologists and doctors generally will not recommend an IVC filter if other options are available instead.\n\n\nThere is no current published data confirming the benefit of removing an IVC. Because of this, the Society of Interventional Radiology created a multidisciplinary panel that developed the following guidelines to see if someone qualifies for removal:\n\nIn those with initial acute proximal DVT or acute PE who had IVC filters placed instead of anticoagulation, and who have their risk of bleeding resolve, the American College of Chest Physicians suggested, in 2012, that they receive a standard course of anticoagulation. While IVC filters are associated with a long term risk of DVT, they are not, alone, reason enough to maintain extended anticoagulation.\n\nThe main function of a vena cava filter is to prevent death from massive pulmonary emboli. Long-term clinical follow-up studies have shown that this is accomplished in 96% of cases having a standard stainless-steel Greenfield filter.\n\nIn August, 2010, the FDA released an Initial Communication on the Risk and Adverse events associated with Long Term use of an inferior vena cava filter. Over a period of about 5 years, they identify 921 events. While not the majority of cases, that number still represents a statistical significance of the use of long-term IVCs.\n\nOf these IVC filter side effects, 328 involved device migration, 146 involved embolizations after detachment of device components, 70 involved perforation of the IVC, and 56 involved filter fracture. Much of the medical community believes that this large number of adverse events is related to the heart filter remaining in place for longer than necessary.\n\nCommon issues relating to failure, to include death (the other 4% of cases) include:\n\nWhile these side effects are not common (less than 10-20% of patients), many do report issues stemming from the placement and complication of the IVC while inside of the body. \n\nNumerous small published articles and case studies report describe similar issues to the above. Most notably:\n\nEven though the cases above are the exception, and not the rule, most radiologists object to doing prophylactic filter insertions in patients who do not have thromboembolic diseases. For the most part, whenever possible, interventional radiologists would rather start the patient on anticoagulants than use an IVC, even if requested or referred via a doctor.\n\nWhile most IVC filters are made of non-ferromagnetic materials, there are a few types that are weakly ferromagnetic. Accordingly, IVC filters fall under the MRI Safe and MRI Conditional categories depending mostly on type of material used during construction. Rarely will one find an MRI Not Safe IVC filter, as most of the steel, and other ferromagnetic material devices have been discontinued via the FDA.\n\nIVC filters are attached to the vena cava via hooks on their ends. Some are compression springs, which compress outward onto the side wall of the vena cava; however, they still have small hooks that retain their location. These hooks aid in the anchoring and healing process, as they allow the tissues to 'ingrow' around them, securing the IVC in place. It is unlikely, then, after 4 to 6 weeks of healing, that an MRI of 1.5 tesla, up to 3 tesla, will cause any level of dislodging to occur to the IVC filter.\n\nStudies of MR examination of both animals and humans, with implanted IVC filters, have not reported complications or symptomatic filter displacement.\n\nSeveral animal studies have even used \"real-time\" MR for the placement of IVC filters to check for rotation, sheering, and other artifacts.\n\nAs part of the 'routing' survey for MRI studies, patients who have IVC filters will often need verification from the doctor, or medical records, to state that the IVC is safe for the MRI. Most patients with weakly or non-safe ferromagnetic implants will be given a card, which they keep on their person at all time, that can help isolate if it is safe to do an MRI.\n\nFor patients who have been denied MRI scans for safety reasons, doctors usually recommend the CT scan with contrast as an alternative.\n\nMost IVC filters that have been tested have been labeled as “MRi safe”; the remainder of IVC filters that have been tested are “MR conditional.” Patients who have been treated with nonferromagnetic IVC filters can undergo MR examination any time after filter implantation. In patients who have been treated with a weakly ferromagnetic IVC filter (Gianturco bird nest IVC filter [Cook], stainless steel Greenfield vena cava filter [Boston Scientific]), it is advised that the patient wait at least six weeks before undergoing an MR examination (because these older devices initially may not be anchored as firmly in place as other devices discussed in the present context), unless there is a strong clinical indication to perform the MR examination sooner after implantation, and as long as there is no reason to suspect that the device is not positioned properly or that it is not firmly in place. Most studies of IVC filters have generally been conducted at 1.5 tesla or less, although many IVC filters have now been evaluated at 3 tesla and deemed acceptable for MR examination.\n\nIVC filters are placed endovascularly, meaning that they are inserted via the blood vessels. Historically, IVC filters were placed surgically, but with modern filters that can be compressed into much thinner catheters, access to the venous system can be obtained via the femoral vein (the large vein in the groin), the internal jugular vein (the large vein in the neck) or the arm veins with one design. Choice of route depends mainly on the number and location of any blood clot within the venous system. To place the filter, a catheter is guided into the IVC using fluoroscopic guidance, then the filter is pushed through the catheter and deployed into the desired location, usually just below the junction of the IVC and the lowest renal vein.\n\nReview of prior cross-sectional imaging or a venogram of the IVC is performed before deploying the filter to assess for potential anatomic variations, thrombi within the IVC, or areas of stenoses, as well as to estimate the diameter of the IVC. Rarely, ultrasound-guided placement is preferred in the setting of contrast allergy, chronic kidney disease, and when patient immobility is desired. The size of the IVC may affect which filter is deployed, as some (such as the Birds Nest) are approved to accommodate larger cavae. There are situations where the filter is placed above the renal veins (e.g. pregnant patients or women of childbearing age, renal or gonadal vein thromboses, etc.). Also, if there is duplication of the IVC, the filter is placed above the confluence of the two IVCs or a filter can be placed within each IVC.\n\nThe concept of a removable IVC filter was first conceived in 1967. In 2003 and 2004 that the United States Food and Drug Administration first approved retrieavable filters. In 2005 that the Society of Interventional Radiology (SIR) convened a multidisciplinary conference to address the clinical application of nonpermanent vena cava filters.\n\nRetrievable filters are fitted with a device (varying from model to model) that allows them to be easily snared and pulled back into a catheter and removed from the body, often through the jugular vein. Prior to 2004, filters that had been in the IVC for less than three weeks were considered suitable to attempt retrieval, as filters that have been in place longer might have been overgrown by cells from the IVC wall and there was an increased risk of IVC injury if the filter is dislodged. Newer designs, and developments in techniques mean that some filters can now be left in for prolonged periods and retrievals after a year are now being reported. This would include the ALN, Bard G2 and G2x, Option, Tulip and Celect filters.\n\nIt is important to note that the clinical exam prior to the removal of the filter is vital in understanding both the risk and pathophysiological effects removing the filter will have on the patient. Doctors and medical professionals must consider several key factors (see Indications for removing IVC filters).\n\n"}

{"id": "2267911", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2267911", "title": "Willard Hershberger", "text": "Willard Hershberger\n\nWillard McKee Hershberger (May 28, 1910 – August 3, 1940) was an American baseball catcher for the Cincinnati Reds of Major League Baseball (MLB) from 1938 to 1940. In 160 career games, Hershberger recorded a batting average of .316 and accumulated 5 triples and 41 runs. He is the only major league player to date to commit suicide during the season.\n\nBorn and raised in California, Hershberger attended Fullerton Union High School where he was a baseball standout. He was signed by the New York Yankees and was part of their minor league system for eight years. He was traded after the 1937 season to the Cincinnati Reds, where he found a place on the major league roster as a backup behind Ernie Lombardi. For three seasons, Hershberger played in relief of Lombardi, stepping in if he needed a day off or was injured. After a slump in late July and early August, Hershberger committed suicide on August 3, 1940 in his hotel room; the Reds went on to win the 1940 World Series in his honor.\n\nWillard Hershberger was born in Lemon Cove, California. His family moved to Fullerton, California, when his father, Claude, got a job working in the city's oil fields. He lived in Fullerton with his father, his mother Maude, and his sister Lois. Hershberger attended Fullerton Union High School, where he distinguished himself on both the baseball and football teams, playing alongside Arky Vaughan and future President Richard Nixon. The 1926 baseball team won the California Interscholastic Federation championship, and in 2003, he was named to the school's All-Time baseball team.\n\nClaude, Willard's father, was depressed over financial problems, and on November 21, 1928, he fatally shot himself with a shotgun in the family home's bathroom; Willard, then 18, discovered the body. Hershberger graduated high school in 1929; the high school yearbook called Hershberger \"the boy with the golden toe\" due to his status as the football team's placekicker and \"the greatest little catcher to ever put on the Fullerton uniform.\" In 1930, scouts Bill Essick of the New York Yankees and Art Griggs of the Pittsburgh Pirates came to Fullerton to watch Vaughan and Hershberger play, respectively. Essick took a detour and Griggs ended up signing Vaughan instead, while Essick signed Hershberger to a contract to play in the Yankees organization.\n\nHershberger made his professional debut with the El Paso Texans of the Arizona–Texas League, playing for them in 1930 and 1931; in 1931 he had a batting average of .356. He spent the 1932 season with three minor league teams, and mostly played for the Erie Sailors of the Central League where he hit .339 in 94 games. The following year, Hershberger was promoted to the Binghamton Triplets of the New York–Pennsylvania League (NYPL). For the season, he had a .306 batting average, was named to the NYPL All-Star Team, and helped the Triplets win the NYPL title. In 1934, he was promoted to the Hollywood Stars of the Pacific Coast League (PCL), and had a .307 batting average and 18 doubles in 114 games. Hershberger was promoted to the Newark Bears of the International League in 1935, and had a batting average of .310. The following year, he split time with the Bears and the Oakland Oaks of the PCL. At one point in the season, he was batting .313, and was noted as a player who should have a shot at the major leagues. By the end of the season, his average went down to .263 over 89 games.\n\nThe 1937 season started off poorly for Hershberger. While he remained with the Newark Bears, the Yankees released him from his contract, and partly due to the success of catcher Bill Dickey, the Yankees no longer had an interest in Hershberger. He spent the full season with the Bears, splitting time with Buddy Rosar at catcher. The team ended up with a 109–43 record and the International League title; the Bears have been called the third greatest minor league team in history by Minor League Baseball. Hershberger hit 15 doubles and had a .325 average in 96 games, and hit .364 in the Junior Series against the Columbus Red Birds. As a result, Yankees owner Jacob Ruppert noted that he would spend the offseason working to get the players on major league rosters. On December 3, 1937, Hershberger was traded to the Cincinnati Reds for shortstop Eddie Miller and $40,000, ending his tenure in the Yankees organization.\n\nReds manager Bill McKechnie noted that Hershberger was playing so well in spring training that there was the possibility of him beating out Ernie Lombardi for the starting catcher job in 1938. He made the roster and served as the backup to Lombardi that season, and played in 49 games and had a .276 batting average. He earned the nickname of \"Little Slug\" due to his pinch hitting, and as a contrast to Lombardi's nickname of \"Big Slug\". In 1939, Hershberger gained extra playing time due to a Lombardi injury in June; during that stretch, Hershberger had eight hits and five runs batted in in five games. For the season, he hit .345 in 63 games, and played in two games of the 1939 World Series against the Yankees. In the series, he had one hit in two at-bats as the Reds lost in four games. His one hit in the World Series brought in the tying run in game four, but the Yankees fought back to win the game and the series.\n\nHershberger spent the 1940 Cincinnati Reds season as the backup to Lombardi, as had been the case the previous two seasons. He had been hitting well in relief of Lombardi, and had a batting average of .429 at the end of May and .345 at the end of June. In July, Lombardi suffered an injured finger, and Hershberger's playing time increased that month as a result. Lombardi then sprained his ankle on July 26, putting Hershberger in the starting role indefinitely; at the time his batting average was .354. However, in a game against the New York Giants at the Polo Grounds on July 31, the Reds took a 4–1 lead into the ninth and lost 5–4, with the comeback capped by a game-ending home run by Harry Danning. After an off-day for the team, the Reds lost both games of a doubleheader on August 2 to the Boston Bees, by scores of 10–3 and 4–3. Hershberger played in the second game and went hitless in six trips to the plate.\n\nHershberger blamed himself for the losses to the Giants and Bees, telling third baseman Billy Werber that \"If Ernie had been catching, we wouldn't have lost those ball games.\" He felt he called the wrong pitch to Danning, resulting in the home run. In the game against the Bees, Hershberger failed to field a bunt, and after the game alluded to his father's suicide to McKechnie in private, saying \"My father killed himself, and I'm gonna do it too.\" However, after about an hour, Hershberger had calmed down considerably, and McKechnie believed he would be fine.\n\nThe following afternoon, Reds publicist and traveling secretary Gabe Paul called Hershberger's room at the Copley Plaza Hotel after Hershberger missed batting practice. He said that he wasn't going to play that afternoon because he wasn't feeling well; McKechnie, worried, wanted him there in street clothes, and Hershberger agreed. After he missed the first game of another doubleheader against the Bees, McKechnie had Dan Cohen, a friend of Hershberger's, head to the hotel to check up on him. He found the door locked, and asked an employee to open the door. Inside, Cohen found Hershberger's body by the bathtub with his throat slit. After the second game, McKechnie had coach Hank Gowdy bring all the players together in the locker room, stating, \"I want to tell you something. Willard Hershberger has just destroyed himself.\"\n\nAfter giving his team the news, McKechnie had the Reds dedicate themselves to winning the World Series \"for Hershie\". His number 5 was retired for the season by the team as a tribute. It would later be permanently retired in honor of the Reds' Hall of Fame catcher, Johnny Bench. McKechnie never publicly revealed what Willard Hershberger said to him during their meeting the day before: \"It had nothing to do with anybody on the team\", he told reporters. \"He told it to me in confidence, and I will not utter it to anyone\". The Cincinnati Reds would go on to defeat the American League champion Detroit Tigers in seven games to win the 1940 World Series. Reds players decided to share a portion of their championship money, totaling $5,803, with Hershberger's mother, Maude. Hershberger was buried at Visalia Public Cemetery in Visalia, California.\n\n"}

{"id": "2267936", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2267936", "title": "Wilmer-Hutchins Independent School District", "text": "Wilmer-Hutchins Independent School District\n\nWilmer-Hutchins Independent School District (WHISD) was a school district in southern Dallas County, Texas serving the cities of Wilmer and Hutchins, a portion of Dallas (the district was last headquartered at 3820 East Illinois Avenue in Dallas ), and a small portion of Lancaster. The district served urban, suburban, and rural areas. Some unincorporated areas with Ferris addresses were served by WHISD.\n\nWilmer-Hutchins Independent School District was established in 1927 as a consolidation of four smaller school districts. Wilmer-Hutchins High School was established in 1928. At the time it had one elementary school for black students that had been built for $2,000, and that school had one teacher. At one point district officials cleaned the second floor of the black school and converted it into Wilmer-Hutchins Colored High School. Around 1939, Wilmer-Hutchins Colored High School burned down in a fire. After that occurred, children were bused to Dallas ISD schools such as Booker T. Washington High School and Lincoln High School. Black elementary students attended classes at Little Flock Baptist Church until a new elementary school named Morney Elementary School was opened.\n\nIn September 1954, more than 100 African-American students and parents went into Linfield Elementary School, then an all-White WHISD school. They were tired of the district's periodic closing of Melissa Pierce School, an all-Black school, so students would pick crops. The district turned the students away.\n\nIn 1958, WHISD had 1,746 White students and 577 African-American students. The number of African-American students increased rapidly over the next decade as the United States government established housing policies that concentrated many African-American families in the northern part of the district, which was in Dallas, while the cities of Hutchins and Wilmer remained majority white. The district, still clinging to its policy of segregation, spent millions of dollars building new schools for black students - Bishop Heights Elementary School, Milton K. Curry Junior High School and John F. Kennedy High School were all opened in the early 1960s. The more rural southern portion of the district remained predominantly white - Linfield, Alta Mesa, Wilmer and Hutchins Elementary Schools were reserved for white students, as was Wilmer-Hutchins Junior High and High School. In February 1970, WHISD was forced to implement desegregation busing.\n\nThe mayor of Hutchins, Don Lucky, formed a group of followers and hijacked Hutchins Elementary School for a period. Two out of three White people in WHISD moved away from the district in the early 1970s. WHISD became predominately economically poor and African-American; WHISD became controlled by African-Americans.\n\nIn 1999, the school district had 3,651 students. In April 2003 it had 3,060 students and had gained 35 students from the start of the year. By 2004 it had about 2,900 students. It was the only Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex school district to have lost population between 1999 and 2004. Many WHISD parents left the district, putting their children in Dallas Independent School District schools or charter schools.\n\nThroughout its existence, the district was historically recognized as one of the poorest-performing school districts in Texas, in terms of both student test scores and managerial oversight. The Texas Education Agency (TEA) had, on several occasions, appointed monitors to oversee the district, with no long-term success. This led to the decrease of the student body in the district. The district shrank by more than a third of its student size in the 2000s (decade), and, by the 2000s (decade), the district's boundaries had more charter school students than any other district in the state of Texas.\n\nIn the 1970s, the State of Texas threatened to revoke the district's accreditation. Due to misuse of district funds and fraudulent elections in the 1980s the Texas Education Agency threatened to close the district. In the 1990s, for two years the TEA took over operations of WHISD.\n\nAround 1996, according to the district's accounts, 600 students in the WHISD attendance zone attended school in other school districts, such as Dallas ISD and Lancaster ISD, by using false addresses or addresses of relatives, since many of the families in the WHISD attendance zone did not make enough money to enroll their children in private school. Due to hastiness and lack of following procedure when firing employees, the district in 1996 had a legal budget of $366,583 ($ when adjusted for inflation), amounting to about $114 ($ when adjusted for inflation) per student. This is compared to the Plano Independent School District's legal spending of $161,598 ($ when adjusted for inflation), about $4 ($ when adjusted for inflation) per student, and the Dallas Independent School District's legal budget of about $900,000 ($ when adjusted for inflation), about $6 ($ when adjusted for inflation) per student.\n\nIn 2004, the district closed Wilmer-Hutchins Performing Arts High School, A.L. Morney Learning Center, and Hutchins Academic Elementary School. The board also voted to eliminate the district's police department and fire the police chief, Cedric Davis. By 2005, the district's buildings were in poor shape. Large trees grew out of the bleachers of the Wilmer-Hutchins ISD football field. Wilmer-Hutchins High School failed fire inspections twice in a row.\n\nMorgan Smith of the \"Texas Tribune\" said \"When the state closed Wilmer-Hutchins ISD six years ago, the district was like the region’s unwanted stepchild — few of the neighboring districts wanted to absorb students from its low-performing schools.\"\n\nDianna Wray of the \"Houston Press\" stated that WHISD \"was almost a mirror image of <nowiki>[</nowiki>North Forest Independent School District<nowiki>]</nowiki> in both demographics and history\".\n\nAfter a series of investigative stories in \"The Dallas Morning News\" found evidence of cheating on the Texas Assessment of Knowledge and Skills in Wilmer-Hutchins, the Texas Education Agency (TEA) began an investigation into the findings. That investigation found sufficient evidence of educator-led cheating for TEA to retroactively declare the school district \"academically unacceptable\" (the lowest possible ranking). The retroactive ranking was the second consecutive \"academically unacceptable\" rating, which gave the TEA authority to close WHISD and transfer its students to another school district. After WHISD voters overwhelmingly defeated a proposal to increase the property tax rate (many citing the district's shoddy recordkeeping), the TEA elected not to attempt yet another monitoring effort, and instead ordered the district closed for the 2005–2006 school year. The Lancaster ISD was given first opportunity to absorb the district, but declined. Instead, the Dallas Independent School District agreed to absorb WHISD. The United States Department of Justice approved the closure on December 13, 2005. The district held its final meeting on June 30, 2006. Dallas ISD elected to close all of the Wilmer-Hutchins schools and sent students to existing Dallas schools. The entire senior class of Wilmer-Hutchins High School went on to South Oak Cliff High School. Other students were divided into several different schools. Marlon Brooks, the principal of Wilmer-Hutchins High School as of 2011, said that some students had commutes of over one hour. Some students were over away from their zoned schools.\n\nThe \"Dallas Observer\", an alternative newsweekly, argues that DISD agreed to absorb the district because of the significant tax revenue to be gained from the recently completed US$70 million Union Pacific Dallas Intermodal Terminal, which is located partly in the city of Wilmer and partly in the city of Hutchins, but wholly within the WHISD district boundaries.\n\nAfter the closure of WHISD, property values in the district increased.\n\nIn January 2007, Dallas ISD removed 5,000 boxes with more than one half million personnel records and placed them in the DISD administration building. The district also removed the trophies, banners, and plaques from the WHISD campuses.\n\nAs a result of the merger, Dallas ISD will hold the titles to the former WHISD campus facilities. For the 2008 bond proposal DISD plans to demolish the former Kennedy-Curry Middle School campus and renovate the Wilmer-Hutchins High School campus. In addition DISD planned to build a new elementary school campus within the former WHISD territory.\n\nIn 2011 DISD re-opened Kennedy Curry and Wilmer-Hutchins High School and opened Wilmer-Hutchins Elementary School in the Wilmer-Hutchins area. The district had renovated Kennedy-Curry and expanded it by almost . Funds from the 2008 $1.35 billion bond were used to overhaul the schools.\n\nIn 2007, a community group lobbied for the re-establishment of Wilmer-Hutchins ISD. Some WHISD residents missed the small-town country feel of WHISD schools and schools close to their houses. Some residents feel that the next preferable option is to have DISD open schools in the former WHISD territory. \n\nIn the district's final year of operation, it had around 3,000 students. About 80% were black and about 20% were Hispanic.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe district headquarters were located in Dallas, in a former elementary school. In 1996 Thomas Koroesec of the \"Dallas Observer\" said that the building, which does not have windows, \"at times resembles an education ministry in some Third World country.\"\n\nHutchins and Wilmer, as of 2003, are working class communities south of the City of Dallas. Described as \"semirural\" suburbs by Thomas Korosec of the \"Dallas Observer\", both are located on Interstate 45 and at the time had a mix of racial groups. WHISD also served portions of South Dallas and these areas, mostly African-American, were low income; as of 2003 WHISD was one of three school districts other than DISD which enrolled large numbers of students from the Dallas city limits: the others were Plano ISD and Richardson ISD. Korosec wrote that WHISD was \"Actually more a creature of Dallas than its namesake towns\".\n\nIn 1996 around 17,800 people lived within the district. U.S. Census figures stated that the area was about 70% African-American and mostly blue collar. About 20% of the residents lived in poverty. About 6.67% of the adults held one or more university degrees. Most residents were homeowners. In 1996 the \"Dallas Observer\" described the district, which had \"urban demographics\" and a location \"a few minutes from downtown Dallas,\" as having an \"incongruous rural feel\" with \"pig farms sit cheek by jowl with burglar-barred houses in sprawling subdivisions built 25 or 30 years ago\" within the Dallas portion of Wilmer-Hutchins ISD.\n\nKorosec stated that the residents blamed the poor performance of WHISD for the fact that nobody established new businesses and houses within the district boundaries.

He grew up in Madison, New Jersey, where he attended Madison High School. As a teenager, Trunk became a fan of Kiss, Raspberries, and other bands including Aerosmith, Rush, UFO and Black Sabbath. During high school, he began to write reviews of records for school credit and soon found his passion in music.\n\nAround 1986, Trunk became an employee of Megaforce Records which had signed both Metallica and Anthrax. He became vice president of the company at age 25. During that time, he earned executive producer credit on some works from bands like Anthrax, Raven, T.T. Quick, Manowar, Overkill, King's X, Prophet, Icon and Ace Frehley. In fact, Trunk was the main driving force behind reviving Ace Frehley's career, convincing Megaforce Records head Jon Zazula to sign Frehley to a solo deal.\n\nAround 1997, WNEW FM was looking to become a more \"heavy\" station and move away from their classic rock playlist. Trunk was one of the first people hired for the new concept. He wanted to do a metal show for the station, and eventually Saturday Night Rocks was born. WNEW became a talk radio station, but Trunk's show was one of the few retained.\n\nFrom late 1983 through 1994, Trunk became a fixture at WDHA, the station he grew up listening to. Over the 10 years he spent at DHA (all on a part-time basis), he hosted, produced, and programmed the stations popular metal show, in addition to doing regular airshifts, remote broadcasts, interviews, and promotions.\n\nTrunk hosted \"Friday Night Rocks\" and \"Saturday Night Rocks\" for WNEW-FM in New York City until the radio station underwent a format change in 2003. He was also a regular disc jockey on Q104.3 before joining WNEW-FM and was a VJ who hosted the weekend episodes of \"Metal Mania\" on the cable television channel VH1 Classic.\n\nHe also hosted a weekly Saturday four-hour program on XM Radio's Ozzy's Boneyard Channel. Trunk was suspended after an interview with New York Mets catcher Mike Piazza in which Piazza was critical of XM Radio's programming on the Boneyard Channel. Trunk was not heard on XM again until late November 2006, when he appeared on the Ron and Fez show to announce his return to XM. He began hosting \"Eddie Trunk Live\" on the Boneyard beginning the first week in December 2006.\n\nIn May 2006, Guns N' Roses lead singer Axl Rose made a surprise visit on Trunk's Q104.3 radio show. Rose walked in unexpectedly to Trunk's radio studio in New York and spent two and a half hours live on the air with Trunk and other guests.\n\nTrunk was also the host of \"That Metal Show\", which aired weekly on VH1 Classic from 2008 to 2015.\n\nTrunk revealed in 2019 that he had recorded backing vocals on Anthrax's 1989 cover of the KISS song Parasite and was credited in the special thanks as Ed \"Parasite\" Trunk.\n\nAs of 2012, Trunk's current work includes the nationally syndicated radio show, \"Eddie Trunk Rocks\", which is recorded at the New York radio station, Q104.3 (WAXQ), on the FM frequency, and is syndicated by Radio KG. Trunk also hosts \"Trunk Nation\" on the Sirius XM Radio channels Volume (Channel 106) and Hair Nation (Channel 39) (formerly known as \"Eddie Trunk Live\" when Trunk was with The Boneyard station), and is a music host and interviewer for the MSG Network, a cable network based out of New York City.

Trunk has blogged and commented over the open air on \"That Metal Show\" his disgust at the Hall for almost entirely ignoring heavy metal and hard rock, citing examples such as Dio being passed over in favor of Madonna and ABBA. Trunk became a voting member of The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2015. As of January 2017, Trunk has somewhat backed away from his earlier criticism of the hall citing progress made in the enshrining of bands such as Rush, Kiss, Cheap Trick, Deep Purple, Def Leppard and Journey.\n\n"}

Furthermore, the paper does not receive any budget from the Students' Union and therefore relies entirely on self-generated advertising revenue to keep afloat.\n\nIn 2013, the \"Boar\" was selected as Student Publication of the Year. In 2018, the \"Boar\" won the Student Publication of the Year award at BBC Radio 4 Journalism Awards.\n\nUpon its founding in October 1973, the \"Boar\" incorporated \"Campus\", the student newspaper of the late 1960s and early 1970s. For a brief period in 1988, the \"Boar\" changed its name to \"Mercury\", though by the end of the academic year it reverted to the \"Boar\". With the exception of the occasional comedy issue of the \"Warwick Goat\", the \"Boar\" has consistently remained as the \"Boar\" or the \"Warwick Boar\".\n\nThe \"Boar\" has been a free newspaper since 1990.

Sitting in the Pennyfarthing Bar, [Co-founder] Kasper de Graaf and I pooled our vast knowledge of local heraldry. Coventry, we thought, had an elephant as its symbol, and Warwick had a bear. Or perhaps it was the other way around.\n\nAnyway, neither of these had the required cachet. After experiments with other possible fauna we stumbled on the idea of a boar.

Nozu was at every major battle in the war, from the Battle of Toba–Fushimi, to the Battle of Aizu and the Battle of Hakodate.\n\nAfter the war, Nozu went to Tokyo, and in March 1871, was appointed as a major in the 2nd Brigade of the fledgling Imperial Japanese Army. He was promoted to lieutenant colonel in August 1872, and colonel in January 1874 upon his appointment as chief of staff of the Imperial Guards Brigade. From July to October 1876, Nozu traveled to the United States, where he attended the Centennial Exhibition in Philadelphia. Soon after his return to Japan, he had the unpleasant task of fighting against his former Satsuma clansmen in the Satsuma Rebellion.

With all the necessary maritime facilities in place, the site became a supply depot. A small pier was constructed in 1922 and the first materials were moved into the Depot's warehouse in February 1923.

This included staging false attacks on themselves using innocent people or concentration camp prisoners. Operation Himmler was arguably the first act of the Second World War in Europe.\n\nFor months prior to the 1939 invasion, German newspapers and politicians like Adolf Hitler had carried out a national and international propaganda campaign accusing Polish authorities of organizing or tolerating violent ethnic cleansing of ethnic Germans living in Poland.\n\nThe plan, named after its originator, Heinrich Himmler, was supervised by Reinhard Heydrich and managed by Heinrich Müller. The goal of this false flag project was to create the appearance of Polish aggression against Germany, which could be used to justify the German invasion of Poland. Hitler also might have hoped to confuse Poland's allies, the United Kingdom and France, into delaying or stopping their declaration of war on Germany.\n\nThe operations were mostly carried out on 31 August 1939. The operation - as well as the main German offensive - was originally scheduled for 26 August; the shifting diplomatic situation resulted in delay until 31 August/1 September - but one of the German undercover units was not informed and carried out its attack on a German customs post; several Germans were killed before the incident ended. The operations were carried by agents of the SS and the SD. The German troops, dressed in Polish uniforms, would storm various border buildings, scare the locals with inaccurate shots, carry out acts of vandalism, and retreat, leaving behind dead bodies in Polish uniforms.\nThe bodies were in fact prisoners from concentration camps; they were dressed in Polish uniforms, killed (by a lethal injection, then shot for appearance) and left behind. They were described in plans as \"Konserve\", i.e. 'canned goods' (which also led to the more informal name of the operation, \"Operation Konserve\").\n\nThere were several separate operations, including staged attacks on:\n\nOn the night of 31 August 1939 a small group of German operatives, dressed in Polish uniforms and led by Alfred Naujocks, seized the Gleiwitz station and broadcast a short anti-German message in Polish (sources vary on the content of the message). Several prisoners (most likely from the Dachau concentration camp) and a local Polish-Silesian activist (arrested a day before) were left dead on the scene in Polish uniforms.\n\nOn 1 September, in a speech in the Reichstag, Adolf Hitler cited the 21 border incidents as justification for Germany's \"defensive\" action against Poland:\n\nBy mid-1939, thousands of Polish Volksdeutsche had been secretly prepared for sabotage and guerrilla warfare by the Breslau (Wrocław) office of the Abwehr; the purpose of their activities was to provoke anti-German reprisals that could be claimed as provocations by the Germans. Those German agents indeed cooperated with the German forces during the invasion of Poland, leading to some reprisals, which were highly exaggerated by the German Nazi propaganda. One of the most notable cases of such a scenario was reportedly carried out during Bydgoszcz Bloody Sunday. An instruction issued by the Ministry of Propaganda for the press said:\n\nThe operation failed to convince international public opinion of the German claims.\n\n\n"}

PLGA is synthesized by means of ring-opening co-polymerization of two different monomers, the cyclic dimers (1,4-dioxane-2,5-diones) of glycolic acid and lactic acid. Polymers can be synthesized as either random or block copolymers thereby imparting additional polymer properties. Common catalysts used in the preparation of this polymer include tin(II) 2-ethylhexanoate, tin(II) alkoxides, or aluminum isopropoxide. During polymerization, successive monomeric units (of glycolic or lactic acid) are linked together in PLGA by ester linkages, thus yielding a linear, aliphatic polyester as a product.\n\nDepending on the ratio of lactide to glycolide used for the polymerization, different forms of PLGA can be obtained: these are usually identified in regard to the molar ratio of the monomers used (e.g. PLGA 75:25 identifies a copolymer whose composition is 75% lactic acid and 25% glycolic acid). The crystallinity of PLGAs will vary from fully amorphous to fully crystalline depending on block structure and molar ratio. PLGAs typically show a glass transition temperature in the range of 40-60 °C. PLGA can be dissolved by a wide range of solvents, depending on composition. Higher lactide polymers can be dissolved using chlorinated solvents whereas higher glycolide materials will require the use of fluorinated solvents such as HFIP.\n\nPLGA degrades by hydrolysis of its ester linkages in the presence of water. It has been shown that the time required for degradation of PLGA is related to the monomers' ratio used in production: the higher the content of glycolide units, the lower the time required for degradation as compared to predominantly lactide materials. An exception to this rule is the copolymer with 50:50 monomers' ratio which exhibits the faster degradation (about two months). In addition, polymers that are end-capped with esters (as opposed to the free carboxylic acid) demonstrate longer degradation half-lives. This flexibility in degradation has made it convenient for fabrication of many medical devices, such as, grafts, sutures, implants, prosthetic devices, surgical sealant films, micro and nanoparticles.\n\nPLGA undergoes hydrolysis in the body to produce the original monomers: lactic acid and glycolic acid. These two monomers under normal physiological conditions, are by-products of various metabolic pathways in the body. Lactic acid is metabolized in the tricarboxylic acid cycle and eliminated via carbon dioxide and water. Glycolic acid is metabolized in the same way, and also excreted through the kidney. Since the body can metabolize the two monomers, there is minimal systemic toxicity associated with using PLGA for biomaterial applications. However, it has been reported that the acidic degradation of PLGA reduces the local pH low enough to create an autocatalytic environment. It has been shown that the pH inside a microsphere can become as acidic as pH 1.5. \n\nSpecific examples of PLGA's use include:\n\nOther biodegradable polymers:\n"}

In 2012, \"Vintage Guitar\" magazine described the Dumble Overdrive Special as the most valuable in the product line, with used amplifiers fetching between $70,000 and $150,000. Other examples have sold for more.\n\nDumble currently builds two or three amplifiers per year, primarily for celebrity musicians and studios. He prices them similarly to the used market to dissuade resale. Dumble services and refurbishes his original amplifiers for a fee, and many players buy used Dumble amplifiers and have Dumble refurbish them. Carlos Santana and Ben Harper, for example, both bought their first Dumble used, and had Dumble refurbish the amp for their particular playing styles.\n\nHoward Dumble began modifying Fender tweed and blackface amplifiers in 1963. Before he was 21, Mosrite, in Santa Cruz, hired Dumble to build a special line of Amplifiers for The Ventures. By the late 1970s, he was modifying and building high-gain amps in the way that Randall Smith of Mesa Boogie, and others did. Dumble, however, was not interested in selling amplifiers in greater numbers, but focused solely on getting the best possible sound. Building to order only (even building his own speaker cabinets by hand), his amps gained a positive reputation and became highly sought after by professional musicians. Dumble became known as a tube electronics master, and his high end clientele gained him a reputation as a reclusive amplifier tech to the stars.\n\nMuch of the company's PR over the years has been word of mouth. Howard Dumble did some interviews and advertisements in the 80s—but few people knew about him, even in the professional music community. Carlos Santana, for instance, only heard of Dumble in reference to Stevie Ray Vaughan in the late 90s. After someone loaned him an amplifier (it wasn't for sale) he \"was hooked for life.\" He subsequently contacted Howard Dumble, and was able to buy a used amp and have Dumble refurbish it. Reportedly he has since bought more.\n\nSince the 1980s, Dumble has covered the preamp circuitry of his amps with a thick layer of usually opaque epoxy, presumably protecting his schematic's exact design from prying eyes. There are also practical reasons for covering circuits in epoxy: it keeps the parts firmly in place and dissipates heat well. One such application of this was in the 1971 \"Urei 1176LN\" version C. Bill Putnam covered the additional \"Low Noise\" portion he developed for the 1176 in version C with black epoxy.\n\nHoward Dumble legally changed his name to Alexander, and prefers to be referred to as \"Alex\". As of 2017, Dumble still builds and services amplifiers for mainly prominent recording artists. However, if someone were to purchase a used amplifier, Dumble offers free servicing. Now older in age, he is said to only produce about five to ten amps per year.\n\nSince Dumble individually tailors his amplifiers, no two are exactly the same. However, most fall within a few known models. These models amount to general circuit styles and chassis layouts.\n\nThe Overdrive Special is a two channel amplifier, with a clean channel and a second \"overdrive\" channel. This overdrive channel \"cascades\" from the first channel into at least one additional gain stage in the overdrive channel. This means that the clean channel tone stack and gain stages cascade into the gain stage of the overdrive channel, overdriving the clean channel. In a sense, the overdrive channel sits \"on top\" of the clean channel. This is Dumble's most popular model, and subsequently is the most frequently seen. That said, the Overdrive Special (ODS) varies from decade to decade, and serial number to serial number. For example, though most ODS amplifiers use 6L6 tubes in the power section (commonly associated with Fender amps), some have EL34 tubes (commonly associated with Marshall amps).\n\nOn the other hand, even the many 6L6 versions of the ODS vary considerably. For example, some have a clean channel that stays clean \"all the way up to 10\" (referencing a gain potentiometer ranging from 1 to 10). Others have a clean channel that starts to \"break up\" around 3. Some overdrive channels can only reach a minimal amount of breakup, even when dialed up. However, most ODS overdrive channels have a large amount of tube distortion available. Many later versions of the ODS have \"HRM\" controls on the inside of the amplifier, which is a \"hot rodded Marshall\" tone stack that sits \"on top\" of the overdrive channel or, in other words, comes after the overdrive channel tube gain stage.\n\nThere are commonalities across all ODS amplifiers. Firstly, the ODS amps are known for their harmonic richness in the overdrive channel breakup, and transparent \"open-ness\" in the clean channel. Guitarists describe the overdrive channel using terms like \"sustaining\", \"blooming\", and \"musical\"—and call the clean channel \"fast\", \"huge\", and \"responsive\". Robben Ford describes the tone of the ODS as having \"a perfect sonic curve, the lows are deep and rich but not unclear, it doesn't mush out like some amps will. You have the frequencies there for your use. The mid range [is] punchy and clear and the high end, bright, clear but doesn't hurt your ears. It's loud but it sounds good.\"\n\nIn an interview with \"Premier Guitar\", Ford claims that Dumble told him that the original inspiration for the Overdrive Special came while watching Ford play live in the 1970s at a bar in Santa Cruz. Ford was using a mid-60s blackface Fender Bassman, and running a tube screamer in front of it to overdrive the tubes to breakup. Supposedly, Dumble liked Ford's sound, and while contemplating it had the revelations that led to the original Overdrive Special. Since buying his ODS, Ford has almost exclusively used his original Dumble or an exact clone of it in live performances.\n\nAn Overdrive Special amplifier with an internal Reverb Circuit.\n\nThe Steel String Singer is an adjustable single channel \"clean\" amplifier with reverb.. Fewer than 12 of the original Steel String Singers have been accounted for.\n\nAs is typical with Dumble amplifier models, the Steel String Singer (SSS) varies from serial number to serial number. For example, The first SSS (made for Henry Kaiser) has a built-in vibrato circuit. Also, despite its reputation for a clean sound, the earlier SSS (and possibly #7) breaks up when the input gain is turned up or pushed by a strong input signal. Earlier versions also had more complicated phase inversion techniques that had been pioneered in vintage high fidelity amplifiers, and Fender style transformers. Starting with #4, Dumble simplified the phase inversion and gave the amp more negative feedback, which further cleaned up the signal. These updates significantly changed the sound and feel of the circuit, and became standard to the SSS model from #4 and on. The sound the Steel String Singer is most known for is a \"clean feedback\" effect, in which the amplifier feeds back, even though the signal remains clean. This is most apparent in later SSS models, though a balance of factors contribute to this behavior, and earlier SSS versions and other Dumble models reportedly imitate the effect under certain conditions.\n\nMost common features of every Steel String Singer are control oriented. Every SSS has special high and low cut filters that adjust overall tone late in the circuit. Every SSS has reverb, and every SSS has special coupling techniques and a larger chassis style. Guitarists often characterize its sound as extremely clean and compressed, with dynamic response and a lush reverb circuit. Its EQ is generally considered relatively flat internally, but malleable through the front panel controls and overall responsiveness. There are reportedly \"higher highs\" and \"lower lows\" that are not often heard through other amplifiers, and a significant amount of harmonic response to the strength of the input signal.\n\nNotable owners and users of the Steel String Singer include: Stevie Ray Vaughan, Eric Johnson, David Lindley, Jackson Browne, John Mayer, Kirk Hammett, and Henry Kaiser.\n\nA single channel \"no frills\" combo amplifier, similar in appearance to the tweed Bassman. This was the most expensive amplifier on Dumble's amplifier price sheet in the 90s. Bonnie Raitt is a notable original owner of a Manzamp.\n\nOne of the earliest Dumble amplifiers, this was also the model that Stevie Ray Vaughan and Double Trouble used for 80% of the guitar tracks on their debut album, \"Texas Flood\", which was recorded at Jackson Browne's studio. Browne is a long time friend of Dumble, and owns some of his earliest amplifiers (including the first Overdrive Specials). Jackson Browne's collection of amplifiers introduced Vaughan to Dumble's amps, and Browne introduced Vaughan to Dumble so that he could buy his first Steel String Singer.\n\nThe Winterland was a 300-watt bass amplifier Dumble made in the 1970s.\n\nDespite the variability among Dumble tonestack voicing and operation, most Dumble amplifiers have certain controls in common:\n\n\nDumble also made a tube-buffered external effects loop called a \"Dumbleator\". A few Dumble amps have a Dumbleator circuit built in, but most have \"un-buffered\" input jacks that tap directly out of the pre-amp and into the power amp. Dumble likely created this external loop because of the difficulty of fitting effects loop buffering into the amplifier chassis (and the limited use of effects loops for most players). The Dumbleator has separate \"Send\" and \"Receive\" controls for the effects, and a \"Bright\" switch on at least the return. Later models also have a \"Bright\" switch on the send. Dumble also makes stereo versions. This effects loop buffering is essentially a cathode follower for the send, into a gain stage for return.\n\n"}

It refers to \"incidental operating expenses\" incurred in the productive investment of capital, which do not themselves add new value to output. In Marx's social accounting, the faux frais are a component of constant capital, or alternately are funded by a fraction of the new surplus value. \n\nWhen owners of capital invest in production, they do not just invest in labor power, materials, buildings and equipment (or means of production). They must also meet a range of other operating expenses. These can include all kinds of things like bookkeeping, training, catering, cleaning & repairs, advertising, insurance, security services, bribes, taxes & levies etc. Marx has in mind mainly those circulation costs directly necessary and indispensable to keep production going, not \"fringe benefits\". \n\nIn modern medium-sized to large-sized business, fixed capital assets will \"on average\" be the largest single component of the annual tangible capital outlay. After that, materials and wages. But depending on the nature of the business, the \"faux frais\" might be a considerable proportion of the total capital outlay.\n\nIn general, Marx seems to have regarded net insurance and tax payments from gross production income as part of surplus value. But he never elaborated on this point in detail; presumably it depends on the nature of the tax and insurance claims themselves. \n\nProfessor Makoto Itoh comments: \"Unlike pure circulation costs such as bookkeeping and advertising costs which are \"faux frais\" specific only to a commodity economy, some portions of the costs of storage and transport belong substantially to production processes that are continued in the circulation sphere, and therefore add to the substance of value and surplus-value just as production costs. The rest of the costs of storage and transport, together with pure circulation costs, proceed from the mere change in the form of value, and cannot enter into the substance of value of commodities. Such circulation costs are \"faux frais\" which must be maintained by a part of surplus value.\" (Makoto Itoh, \"The Basic Theory of Capitalism\", Barnes & Noble 1988, p. 227).\n\nIn 2002, the US IRS tax-assessed capital costs of all US corporations with a positive net income included the following items:\n\n\nIn the NIPAs, the Bureau of Economic Analysis adds $26.2 billion worth of expensing on meals and entertainment, oilwell bonus payments \nwritten off, adjustments for insurance carriers and savings and loan associations, amortization of intangible assets, and tax-exempt interest \nincome.\n\n\nChai-on Lee, \"Marx’s Treatment of Pure Circulation Cost: A Note\"\n"}

Composer Harold Arlen described it, along with \"The Merry Old Land of Oz\" and \"Ding-Dong! The Witch Is Dead\", as one of the \"lemon drop\" songs of the film. The lyrics are by E.Y. \"Yip\" Harburg.\n\nThe melody's first appearance begins with the Munchkins reciting and Judy Garland echoing \"Follow the Yellow Brick Road!\", which turns into a group vocal by the Munchkins (while Garland skips and dances along the road) and then segues into \"\"You're\" Off to See the Wizard\".\n\nThe song occurs as a vocal three more times in the film soundtrack, along with several short instrumental references in the underscore:\n\nAlthough Jack Haley replaced Ebsen on-screen and in the Tin Man's solo recording of \"If I Only Had a Heart\", it was deemed unnecessary for the group vocal to be re-recorded, so the voice in the film as released remains Ebsen's. His voice can be detected by listening for the male voice enunciating the \"R\" in words like \"Wizard\", as Ebsen's regional accent emphasized the \"R\" much more strongly than Haley's did.\n\nIn \"The Wizard of Oz and Other Harold Arlen Songs\", Shorty Rogers re-worked the song as (in the words of \"Talkin' Broadway\") \"a high-energy, wild Latin dance extravaganza\".\n\nA popular urban legend claims that at the very end of the second reprise of this song, a Munchkin or stagehand or some other person could be seen committing suicide, hanging from a rope. The song was later heard in a few MGM animated cartoons, notably the Tom and Jerry shorts \"Professor Tom\" and \"The Truce Hurts\".\n\nAlvin and the Chipmunks covered this song for their 1969 album \"The Chipmunks Go to the Movies\".\n\nMitch Miller and his male chorus later recorded a single of the song for the children's label Golden Records.

It is not a type of mutation, as it is non-hereditary.\n\nThe term was coined by Richard Goldschmidt in 1935. He used it to refer to forms, produced by some experimental procedure, whose appearance duplicates or copies the phenotype of some mutant or combination of mutants.\n\nThe butterfly genus \"Vanessa\" can change phenotype based on the local temperature. If introduced to Lapland they mimic butterflies localised to this area; and if localised to Syria they mimic butterflies of this area.\n\nThe larvae of \"Drosophila melanogaster\" have been found to be particularly vulnerable to environmental factors which produce phenocopies of known mutations; these factors include temperature, shock, radiation, and various chemical compounds. In fruit fly, \"Drosophila melanogaster\", the normal body colour is brownish gray with black margins. A hereditary mutant for this was discovered by T.H. Morgan in 1910 where the body colour is yellow. This was a genotypic character which was constant in both the flies in all environments. However, in 1939, Rapoport discovered that if larvae of normal flies were fed with silver salts, they develop into yellow bodied flies irrespective of their genotype. The yellow bodied flies which are genetically brown is a variant of the original yellow bodied fly.\n\nPhenocopy can also be observed in Himalayan rabbits. When raised in moderate temperatures, Himalayan rabbits are white in colour with black tail, nose, and ears, making them phenotypically distinguishable from genetically black rabbits. However, when raised in cold temperatures, Himalayan rabbits show black colouration of their coats, resembling the genetically black rabbits. Hence this Himalayan rabbit is a phenocopy of the genetically black rabbit.\n\nReversible and/or cosmetic modifications such as the use of hair bleach are not considered to be phenocopy, as they are not inherent traits.\n\n"}
{"id": "2268030", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2268030", "title": "Humphrey Appleby", "text": "Humphrey Appleby\n\nSir Humphrey Appleby is a fictional character from the British television series \"Yes Minister\" and \"Yes Prime Minister\". He was played originally by Sir Nigel Hawthorne, both on stage and in a television adaptation of the stage show by Henry Goodman in a new series of \"Yes, Prime Minister\". In \"Yes Minister\", he is the Permanent Secretary for the Department of Administrative Affairs (a fictional department of the British government). In the last episode of \"Yes Minister\", \"Party Games\", he becomes Cabinet Secretary, the most powerful position in the service and one he retains during \"Yes, Prime Minister\". Hawthorne's portrayal won the BAFTA Award for Best Light Entertainment Performance four times: 1981, 1982, 1986 and 1987.\n\nSir Humphrey won a \"classical scholarship\" at Winchester College before reading Classics at Baillie College, University of Oxford (clearly based on Balliol College, Oxford: Humphrey is frequently seen wearing a Balliol College tie) where he got a First. After National Service in the Army Education Corps he entered the Civil Service. From 1950 to 1956 he was successively the Regional Contracts Officer, an assistant principal in the Scottish Office, on secondment from the War Office (where he was responsible for a serious mistake that was revealed in \"The Skeleton in the Cupboard\"). In 1964, he was brought into the newly formed Department of Administrative Affairs, where he worked until his appointment as Cabinet Secretary. He is recommended for a KBE award early on in the series in \"The Official Visit\". The Dean of Baillie describes him as \"too clever by half\" and \"smug\" (\"The Bishop's Gambit\").\n\nOn Humphrey's possible private situation, Jonathan Lynn, one of the creators of \"Yes, Minister\" and \"Yes, Prime Minister\", commented: \"We always supposed that Sir Humphrey lived in Haslemere, had a son at Winchester and a daughter at Bedales and that his wife was a sensible woman who made cakes for church socials and enjoyed walking the family bulldog. I think that Humphrey's hobbies were reading (mainly biographies), listening to classical music, and occasionally visiting the RSC, the National Theatre or the Royal Opera House, where he was on the Board. His holidays were probably spent walking in the Lake District and, occasionally, sailing in Lymington. On the whole, he had a slightly warmer relationship with his dog than his family.\"\n\nAccording to the foreword (dated 1989), of the book \"The Complete Yes Minister: The Diaries of a Cabinet Minister by the Rt. Hon. James Hacker MP\", a novelisation of the series, he spent his last days in St Dympna's Hospital for the Elderly Deranged, after the \"advancing years, without in any way impairing his verbal fluency, disengaged the operation of his mind from the content of his speech.\" This contradicts the date of death given in \"Politico's Book of the Dead\".\n\nSir Humphrey has been appointed a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath (GCB), a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE) and a Member of the Royal Victorian Order (MVO).\n\nSir Humphrey is a master of obfuscation and manipulation, often making long-winded statements to confuse and fatigue the listener. An example is the following monologue from the episode The Death List: \"In view of the somewhat nebulous and inexplicit nature of your remit, and the arguably marginal and peripheral nature of your influence within the central deliberations and decisions within the political process, there could be a case for restructuring their action priorities in such a way as to eliminate your liquidation from their immediate agenda.\" Addressing his Minister, he means to suggest by this that a terrorist group which had previously conspired to assassinate the Minister is no longer planning to do so, as they believe he is simply not important enough politically. Sir Humphrey is committed to maintaining the \"status quo\" for the country in general and for the Civil Service in particular, and will stop at nothing to do so—whether that means baffling his opponents with technical jargon, employing a dizzying array of stalling and delaying tactics, withholding information or concealing vital documents in mammoth piles of papers and reports, strategically appointing allies to supposedly impartial boards, or setting up an interdepartmental committee to immobilise his Minister's proposals with red tape, and occasionally outright lying. Throughout the series, he serves as Permanent Secretary at the Department of Administrative Affairs, with Jim Hacker as minister; he is appointed Cabinet Secretary shortly before Hacker's elevation to the role of Prime Minister.\n\nSir Humphrey represents, in many ways, the perfect technocrat. He is pompous, arrogant, elitist and regards his less-well-educated minister with some contempt. He frequently uses both his mastery of the English language and even his superb grasp of Latin and Greek grammar to perplex his political master and to obscure relevant issues under discussion. However, his habit of using language as a tool of confusion and obstruction is so deeply ingrained that he is sometimes unable to speak clearly and directly even when he honestly wishes to be clearly understood. He genuinely believes that the Civil Service knows what the average person needs and is the most qualified body to run the country, the joke being that not only is Sir Humphrey, as a high-ranking Oxford-educated Civil Servant, quite out of touch with the average person but also the Civil Service judges what is \"best for Britain\" to be that which in actuality is best for the Civil Service. Jim Hacker, on the other hand, tends to regard what is best for Britain as being whatever is best for his political party or his own chances of re-election. As a result, Sir Humphrey and Hacker often clash.\n\nHe still holds women to be the fairer sex and is thus overly courteous, frequently addressing them as \"Dear lady\". Like Hacker, Sir Humphrey enjoys the finer things in life, and is regularly seen drinking sherry and dining at fine establishments, often with his fellow civil servant Sir Arnold Robinson, who was Cabinet Secretary throughout \"Yes, Minister\". Sir Humphrey is also on the board of governors of the National Theatre and attends many of the gala nights of the Royal Opera House. His interests also extend to cricket, art and theatre.\n\nHumphrey is usually smooth, calm and collected within his element of bureaucracy and procedure, but has become so adept at working within and maintaining the system of government that, whenever anything unexpected is sprung on him, whether it be Hacker ordering him to negotiate with a rogue councillor, or honours in his department being made dependent on economies, Humphrey immediately crumbles, on a few occasions being reduced to stuttering out garbled platitudes such as \"the beginning of the end\" or \"it cuts at the very roots\", although he usually regains his composure pretty quickly to push things back on track.\n\nIn a \"Radio Times\" interview to promote the first series of \"Yes, Prime Minister\", Nigel Hawthorne observed, \"He's raving mad of course. Obsessive about his job. He'd do anything to keep control. In fact, he does go mad in one episode. Quite mad.\"\n\nIn \"Yes Minister\", Sir Humphrey maintains a civil and outwardly deferential but fundamentally adversarial relationship with his new minister, Jim Hacker. When keeping the Minister busy is not sufficient to prevent him from proposing new policy, Sir Humphrey is not above deceiving or even blackmailing him. He frequently manipulates Hacker by describing new proposals that he is opposed to as \"very brave\" or \"extremely courageous\", playing upon Hacker's fear as a politician of anything which may fly in the face of prevailing public opinion.\n\nHe has a slightly more amicable relationship with his subordinate, the Minister's Principal Private Secretary, Bernard Woolley. He frequently lectures the naïve Woolley in the realities of political matters. When Woolley's loyalty to the Minister is inconvenient to Sir Humphrey's plans, he readily makes oblique threats about Woolley's job prospects should he defy Sir Humphrey. However, he is equally quick to defend Woolley from outsiders. His closest on-screen friendships are with Sir Arnold Robinson, Cabinet Secretary during \"Yes Minister\"; Sir Frederick \"Jumbo\" Stewart, Permanent Secretary of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office; and the banker Sir Desmond Glazebrook. He is married, although his wife plays virtually no role in either series and is only seen once: next to him in bed in the Series One episode \"Big Brother\".\n\nSir Humphrey has become a stereotype associated with civil servants, and the phrase \"Bowler-hatted Sir Humphreys\" is sometimes used when describing their image. Satirical and investigative magazine \"Private Eye\" often refers to Sir Humphrey with the definite article 'the' to indicate someone in the civil service the magazine considers of similar character, e.g. \"[name] is the present Sir Humphrey at the Department for Rural Affairs\". In the 1930s \"Sir Horace\", after Sir Horace Wilson, a senior official close to Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain, became a sobriquet for a civil servant with delusions of grandeur; this is thought to have influenced the choice of the name \"Sir Humphrey\".\n\nA spoof obituary for Sir Humphrey appears in \"Politico's Book of the Dead\", written by his creators, Antony Jay and Jonathan Lynn, which includes some biographical details, including dates of birth and death, which he shares with Nigel Hawthorne, the actor who portrayed him.\n\nSir Humphrey was voted the 45th greatest comedy character in Channel 4's 2007 \"The World's Greatest Comedy Characters\" poll. He was also voted 31st in a poll of \"100 Greatest TV Characters\", also on Channel 4.\n\nUpon Nigel Hawthorne's death, the following appeared on the Editorial page of \"The Ottawa Citizen\" under the heading \"No, Minister\":\n\"It is sadly that we report on Sir Nigel Hawthorne, elsewhere referred to as Sir Humphrey Appleby. While it would be premature to commit ourselves to a definitive position on his merits or even his existence, a committee is being struck to consider the possibility of a decision, in the fullness of time, to regret his passing, if any.\"\n\nThe character was resurrected for the 2010 general election campaign in a series of short sketches on BBC Two's late evening current affairs programme \"Newsnight\". The sketches were written by Jay and Lynn, and Sir Humphrey was played by Henry Goodman.\n\nHenry Goodman also played the part of Sir Humphrey in the 2010 stage production of \"Yes, Prime Minister\".\n\nHumphrey, a cat employed as the Chief Mouser to the Cabinet Office at 10 Downing Street from 1989 to 1997, was named after Sir Humphrey.\n"}

The station is owned by the Daystar Television Network. WPXS' transmitter is located near Saint Rose, Illinois.\n\nThe station first signed on the air on March 13, 1983 as WCEE, which branded itself on-air as \"C-13\". It was the second independent station to serve the Paducah–Cape Girardeau–Harrisburg market, following WDXR-TV, which operated from 1971 to 1981, when it donated the station's broadcast license to the PBS member network Kentucky Educational Television. WCEE was a typical independent station airing a mix of first-run and off-network syndicated programs, and movies. It also aired simulcasts of NBA games from the Chicago Bulls, and Cubs and White Sox Major League Baseball games from WGN-TV in Chicago. Unusual for a small-market independent station, WCEE produced a half-hour newscast on weekdays, and also carried \"PM Magazine\".\nIn 1998, the station was sold to Paxson Communications (the forerunner of Ion Media Networks), and changed its callsign to the current WPXS. At the same time, it signed on a translator station in St. Louis, KUMO-LP (channel 51). WPXS and KUMO became charter affiliates of Paxson's family-oriented broadcast network Pax TV when the network launched on August 31, 1998, serving as that network's owned-and-operated station for both the Paducah–Cape Girardeau–Harrisburg and St. Louis markets. WPXS' transmitter, which was located north of Kell, Illinois, was close enough to St. Louis to cover most of the Illinois portion of the St. Louis market; St. Louis itself was served by KUMO-LP. In 2004, the station affiliated with the Daystar religious broadcast network. The following year, Equity Broadcasting bought the station from Paxson; WPXS subsequently rejoined Pax (which rebranded as i: Independent Television that summer, and then to Ion Television in 2007).\n\nIn 2005, WPXS affiliated with the Retro Television Network, a network owned by Equity at the time. By this time, the bulk of the station's audience was located in St. Louis. In 2010, Daystar purchased WPXS outright; this resulted in the station switching back to the network on August 12 of that year. With that move, DirecTV pulled WPXS from its St. Louis local station lineup on September 11, 2010, as WPXS had become a straight simulcast of Daystar's national feed (unlike fellow religious network, TBN, Daystar's television stations do not produce any local programming). On Dish Network, the provider lists Daystar programming as airing on WPXS, though the provider continues to offer the Retro Television Network feed.\n\nThe station's digital signal is multiplexed:\nWPXS opted to build its digital transmitter in Saint Rose, Illinois, which is part of the St. Louis market. The station shut down its analog signal, over VHF channel 13, on April 30, 2009. The station's digital signal continued to broadcast on its pre-transition UHF channel 21. Through the use of PSIP, digital television receivers display the station's virtual channel as its former VHF analog channel 13.\n\nThe station's signal now covers areas of the St. Louis market east of the I-270 loop, including Belleville, Edwardsville and Alton, Illinois. After the switchover, the broadcast radius of WPXS' digital signal covered a smaller area than the former analog signal, resulting in the loss of the station's reception to nearly 93,000 viewers in Effingham, Clay and Wayne counties and large portions of Franklin, Hamilton, Jefferson, Jasper, Richland and Shelby counties in Illinois. Although WPXS' digital transmitter creates redundancies with KUMO-LP on the Illinois side of the St. Louis market, the transmitter still provides only rimshot coverage of the Missouri side of the market, most likely due to the need to protect KMOV's transmitter on nearby digital channel 24. KUMO-LD flash-cut its digital signal into operation in June 2011, without an RTV subchannel.\n\n"}

One of the most perfect in France is that at Cellefrouin (Charente), which consists of a series of eight attached semicircular shafts, raised on a pedestal, and is crowned with a conical roof decorated with fir cones; it has only one aperture, towards the main road. Other examples exist at Ciron (Indre) and Antigny (Vienne).\n\nThere is one surviving example in England, in the churchyard at Bisley, Gloucestershire, which is referred to as the Poor Souls' Light.\n\nThe origin and use of such lanterns are controversial. Some of those lanterns are said to be \"lanterns of the Moors\" instead of \"lanterns of the Dead\". The illiteracy of most of the population in the past can easily explain this folk etymology: in French, \"the Moors\" (') and \"the dead\" (') are near-homophones. Moreover, some of those lanterns do not indicate any cemetery and their architecture has strong oriental influences. The proximity of Al-Andalus, Crusaders coming back to France, or trade in the Mediterranean may explain such monuments. For instance, the \"lantern of the Moors\" in Vergèze, southern France, looks like the chimneys of the Bakhchisaray Palace, the Palace of the Crimean Tatars in Crimea, and doesn't indicate any cemetery. Actually, its other name is indeed the \"Saracen chimney\". The \"lantern of the Dead\" of Carlux, Southern France, is called a \"Saracen chimney\" too. Another example is the \"lantern of the Moors\" in Sarlat-la-Canéda, in Southern France too. The origin of the lantern is linked with the abbot Bernard of Clairvaux, who played a major role in the Second Crusade. It is said to have been built after a visit of the abbot in the city, in 1147, possibly by Knights Templar as would prove a sculpture on the tower representing a horse and two Crosses pattée.\n\nBesides, \"Saracen chimneys\" (\"\") are a typical local architecture feature of Bresse, a region in Eastern France. It seems to bear the same name only coincidentally. And the origin of the name remains a mystery in that case too. Various fanciful origins exist for those who introduced this tradition, such as: survivors from the Battle of Tours (during which Charles Martel fought the Saracens in 732, 350 km and many centuries away), refugees from the Balkans fleeing the Ottoman Turks in the 15th century after the Fall of Constantinople, Burgundians settling in Bresse in the 5th-6th century and carrying with them Nordic-style chimneys, or monk-soldiers of the 12th century. Last given explanation, \"Saracen\", or \"Arab\" also meant \"apocryphal\" in the 19th century.\n\n\n"}

In 1764, the family moved to Ludwigsburg (Baden-Württemberg). He was entered in the military school at the age of thirteen, but from 1772 to 1780 he was educated as a sculptor, together with Philipp Jakob Scheffauer (1756–1808). Initially, he studied under Adam Bauer, and, starting in 1775, at the military academy at Stuttgart. In his eighteenth year he carried off the prize at the Concours with his model of Milo of Crotona. On this the duke made him sculptor to the palace (1780), and for some time he was employed on child-angels and caryatids for the decoration of the reception rooms.\n\nAfter finishing the academy in 1780, he traveled to Paris, Rome, Bologna and Mantua and returned to Stuttgart in 1790, where he worked as a professor at the Hohe Karlsschule until 1794.\n\nApart from some short trips he never left Stuttgart again. His works now showed the double influence of his admiration for Antonio Canova and his study of the antique. The first was a girl lamenting her dead bird, which pretty light motive was much admired. Afterwards, Sappho, in marble for the Lustschloss, and two offering-bearers for the Jagdschloss; Hector, not in marble; the complaint of Ceres, from Schiller's poem; a statue of Christ; Psyche; kneeling water-nymph; Love, a favourite he had to repeat. \n\nIn 1803, he made a first terracotta model of \"Ariadne on the Panther\", which he executed in marble between c.1810 and 1814. This is generally regarded as his masterpiece and one of the most important sculptures of the nineteenth century (today in the Liebieghaus Sculpture Collection, Frankfurt). In 1810, the Frankfurt banker Simon Moritz von Bethmann signed the contract for the marble version. He built a small neoclassical museum (known as the Bethmann Museum) in his garden which was completed in 1816 (today Seilerstraße 34). Open to the public, this was Frankfurt's first purpose-built museum building. Numerous visitors from all over Europe visited and admired the Ariadne. In 1853 the building and the small park were sold to the city of Frankfurt and the collection reopened in 1856 in the \"Ariadneum\", an octagonal annex to the Bethmann family's house (architects: Johann Georg Kayser and his son Ferdinand August). In 1941, the Bethmann family donated the museum and the collection to the city of Frankfurt. However, the sculpture was severely damaged by fire in 1943 and could only be restored in 1977-78. \n\nAfter the death of his schooltime friend Friedrich Schiller, Dannecker created a bust of him, which was copied by his sculptor friend Reinhold Begas for the monumental Schiller statue erected on Berlin's Gendarmenmarkt. In 1823 and 1824 he created a bust of John the Baptist.\n\n"}

It lies 5 kilometres east of Sevastopol, at the mouth of the Chernaya River which flows into Sevastopol Inlet (also called the North Inlet). Administratively, Inkerman is subordinate to the municipality of Sevastopol which does not constitute part of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea. Population: \n\nThe name \"Inkerman\" is said to mean \"cave fortress\" in Turkish.\nDuring the Soviet era the area was known between 1976 and 1991 as \"Bilokamiansk\" () or \"Belokamensk\" (), which literally means \"White Stone City\", in reference to the soft white stone quarried in the area and commonly used for construction. In 1991 the Ukrainian authorities restored the pre-1976 name.\n\nThe area has been inhabited since ancient times. The cave monastery of St. Clement was founded near Inkerman in the 8th century by Byzantine icon-venerators fleeing persecution in their homeland. The monastery was closed during the Soviet era and several of its churches destroyed but is now in restoration and brought back into use.\n\nKalamita () was a medieval fortress built in the 8th-9th century on a strategic cliff overlooking the estuary and later expanded in the 14th century. In 1475 Kalamita, along with the rest of the Principality of Theodoro, was taken by the Turks, and Kalamita would be renamed Inkerman. After the Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca in 1774 the fortress was abandoned and fell into ruin, but a small settlement at the base of the cliff remained.\n\nThe town became the centre of worldwide attention in 1854 during the Crimean War, when Inkerman was the scene of the Battle of Inkerman and the Battle of Chernaya River, both victorious for the French and the British troops.\n\nDuring the Soviet times, a large underground ammunition warehouse of the Black Sea Fleet was situated under rocky cliffs in the Inkerman area. The storage was abandoned in the 1970s after an explosion that damaged the facility but did not detonate all its stockpiles. However, no efforts to secure the site were made until the 1990s when local residents began salvaging explosives which led to a number of deaths. Ukrainian Army engineer corps started extracting and decommissioning outdated ammunition in 2000 under a special government program.\n\nInkerman has since largely returned to its pre-war obscurity, serving as a suburb of Sevastopol linked to the downtown core by commuter ferries. One of the major Crimean wineries featuring the Inkerman label is located in the adjacent area. A popular hiking trail leading into Crimean Mountains begins just east of the town.\n\nA horse in the Household Cavalry Blues and Royals has been named after the town and battle.\n\nThe left flank company of the 1st Battalion Grenadier Guards, which holds the traditions of the disbanded 3rd Battalion (which played a large part of the battle) is named after the town and battle.

{"id": "2268067", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2268067", "title": "Bernard Woolley", "text": "Bernard Woolley\n\nSir Bernard Woolley, GCB, MA (Oxon) is one of the three main fictional characters of the 1980s British sitcom \"Yes Minister\" and its sequel, \"Yes, Prime Minister\". He was portrayed originally by Derek Fowlds, with Chris Larkin taking on the part for the 2013 revival.\n\nHe is the Principal Private Secretary to the Minister for Administrative Affairs (fictional governmental dept.), then Prime Minister, James \"Jim\" Hacker. However, his loyalties are split between his Minister and his Civil Service boss, Sir Humphrey Appleby. Whilst he is theoretically accountable to Hacker personally, it is Sir Humphrey who writes his performance reviews and apparently wields influence over Bernard's future in the Service, leading to difficult situations for the young civil servant. When Hacker once asked his Private Secretary where his loyalty would lie when the chips were down, Woolley replied, \"Minister, it's my job to see the chips stay up.\"\n\nHis background is not something revealed to any great extent, though we do find out (scattered throughout the very last episode) that Woolley, like Sir Humphrey, is an Oxford graduate. In Episode 4 of Series 3 of \"Yes, Minister\", Woolley is shown wearing a Magdalen College, Oxford tie, suggesting that he may have attended Magdalen College, Oxford. (The novelisation, in an apparent mistake, refers to Bernard at one point as a graduate of Cambridge, but later follows the series in confirming that he attended Oxford. There is, however, no problem in suggesting that he attended both.) In addition, several areas of specialist knowledge surface from time to time: one example arises in \"The Greasy Pole\" where, while discussing the possible political dangers of building a chemical facility in Liverpool (to manufacture the fictional compound \"metadioxin\"), Woolley is quick to remind Sir Humphrey that Greek, unlike Latin, has no ablative case (Bernard may, like Sir Humphrey, have read Literae Humaniores, but equally a basic knowledge of Greek and Latin may merely suggest a standard classical schooling).\n\nAs with the other principal characters in the series, both actor and character have the same date of birth. This means that Bernard is in his mid- to late-forties during the series. Bernard is also married: in the \"Yes, Prime Minister\" episode \"The Key\", he declares that he does not give the key to his house to his mother-in-law. However, his wife never appeared in the series.\n\nWoolley, like the Minister and Sir Humphrey, progresses through the series, especially in his understanding of political mastery. In the last scene of \"The Tangled Web\", the final episode of \"Yes, Prime Minister\", Woolley of his own accord both saves Sir Humphrey from public embarrassment and gives Hacker a lasting weapon to use against him, by acquiring a tape of Sir Humphrey describing the British public in many unpleasant ways, spoken off the record after a radio interview. This act of service to the Prime Minister can be seen as the final result of many series' wrestling between the two competing loyalties. Throughout both series, Bernard is the only civil servant portrayed with any sense of conscience, seeking constantly to justify his actions to himself. In the final episode, therefore, he realises that his principal loyalty must be to the (Prime) Minister, and his intervention in the crisis is crucial in saving Hacker's political reputation and in ensuring that the Cabinet Secretary, like any other civil servant, remains a \"humble functionary\".\n\nIn the novelisations of the series, it is stated that Bernard eventually rose to the post of Head of the Home Civil Service and was appointed a Knight Grand Cross of the Most Honourable Order of the Bath (GCB). The novels take the form of diaries written by Hacker and Sir Humphrey Appleby's personal papers (said to have been donated to Oxford University after his death). Bernard himself contributes in interviews with the authors.\n\nWoolley is always quick to point out the physical impossibilities of Sir Humphrey's or Hacker's mixed metaphors, with almost excessive pedantry. He can occasionally appear rather childlike, by making animal noises and gestures or by acting out how such an analogy cannot work. Even so, on many occasions Sir Humphrey describes Woolley as a \"rising star\" and \"high flyer\" of the Civil Service, though it is not entirely clear how to interpret Sir Humphrey's remarks—that is, whether with sincere deference to Bernard's capabilities or with indignation at such a term being applied to a subordinate. Indeed Sir Humphrey once questions whether Bernard is \"a high flyer or a low flyer supported by occasional gusts of wind.\"\n\nWoolley plays an important role in many episodes in helping Hacker. For example, in \"Doing the Honours\", it is his idea that leads to Hacker proposing a scheme that links national honours to departmental economies (and he is quick to remind the Minister that he didn't suggest it, if asked). He seems to have studied past civil service actions in-depth, occasionally recommending historically proven responses (such as the \"Rhodesia Solution\" for a potential arms scandal in \"The Whisky Priest\").\n\nWoolley is often the source of much exposition, serving in some ways as a proxy for the audience. His common sense views lead him to ask apparently sensible questions of Sir Humphrey, which are generally used to demonstrate his superior's rather more counter-intuitive view of the situation. Much of the satire comes from the fact that Sir Humphrey's views are not just shared by other experienced civil servants, but are taken completely for granted. Bernard's naïve questioning is the perfect way of bringing this out for the audience. In one such conversation, in \"The Devil You Know\", Bernard will simply not let the matter rest and eventually homes in on the heart of the issue. He begins the sentence, \"But surely, in a democracy...\" and is immediately dismissed by an exasperated Sir Humphrey. In \"A Victory for Democracy\", Bernard is genuinely outraged when he learns that the Foreign Office is conducting its own policy with little regard for the Prime Minister's wishes.\n\nOn the other hand, we frequently see Bernard forced to hide something, at which point he tries to mimic Sir Humphrey's distinctive style of confusing never-ending sentences in order to play for time with the Minister. An example of him attempting to \"walk the tightrope\" in this way occurs in \"The Skeleton in the Cupboard\", when he has to conceal a betrayed confidence from Hacker. Although he becomes slightly more adept at this over time, he is clearly much less proficient. At other times, he is the one explaining to the Minister how the civil service machinery works. When asked by Hacker if \"...all this is to prevent Cabinet from enacting its policies?\", Woolley casually and earnestly replies, \"Well, somebody's got to.\"\n\n"}

{"id": "2268095", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2268095", "title": "Tartessian language", "text": "Tartessian language\n\nThe Tartessian language is the extinct Paleo-Hispanic language of inscriptions in the Southwestern script found in the southwest of the Iberian Peninsula, mainly in the south of Portugal (Algarve and southern Alentejo), and the southwest of Spain (south of Extremadura and western Andalusia). There are 95 such inscriptions, the longest having 82 readable signs. Around one third of them were found in Early Iron Age necropolises or other Iron Age burial sites associated with rich complex burials. It is usual to date them to the 7th century BC and to consider the southwestern script to be the most ancient Paleo-Hispanic script, with characters most closely resembling specific Phoenician letter forms found in inscriptions dated to \"c.\" 825 BC. Five of the inscriptions occur on \"stelae\" with what has been interpreted as Late Bronze Age carved warrior gear from the Urnfield culture.\n\nMost researchers use the term \"Tartessian\" to refer to the language as attested on the \"stelae\" written in the Southwestern script, but some researchers would prefer to reserve the term \"Tartessian\" for the language of the core Tartessian zone, which is attested for those researchers with some archaeological graffiti – like the Huelva graffito and maybe with some \"stelae\" such as Villamanrique de la Condesa (J.52.1). Such researchers consider that the language of the inscriptions found outside the core Tartessian zone would be either a different language or maybe a Tartessian dialect and so they would prefer to identify the language of the \"stelae\" with a different title: \"southwestern\" or \"south-Lusitanian\". There is general agreement that the core area of Tartessos is around Huelva, extending to the valley of the Guadalquivir, but the area under Tartessian influence is much wider (see maps). Three of the 95 \"stelae\" and some graffiti, belong to the core area: Alcalá del Río (Untermann J.53.1), Villamanrique de la Condesa (J.52.1) and Puente Genil (J.51.1). Four have also been found in the Middle Guadiana (in Extremadura), and the rest have been found in the south of Portugal (Algarve and Lower Alentejo), where the Greek and Roman sources locate the pre-Roman Cempsi and Sefes, Cynetes and Celtici peoples.\n\nThe most confident dating is for the Tartessian inscription (J.57.1) in the necropolis at Medellín, Badajoz, Spain to 650/625 BC. Further confirmatory dates for the Medellín necropolis include painted ceramics of the 7th–6th centuries BC.\n\nIn addition, a graffito on a Phoenician sherd dated to the early to mid 7th century BC and found at the Phoenician settlement of Doña Blanca near Cadiz has been identified as Tartessian by the shape of the signs. It is only two signs long, reading \"]tetu[\" or perhaps \"]tute[.\" It does not show the syllable-vowel redundancy more characteristic of the southwestern script, but it is possible that this developed as indigenous scribes adapted the script from archaic Phoenician and other such exceptions occur (Correa and Zamora 2008).\n\nThe script used in the mint of Salacia (Alcácer do Sal, Portugal) from around 200 BC may be related to the Tartessian script, though it has no syllable-vowel redundancy; violations of this are known, but it is not clear if the language of this mint corresponds with the language of the \"stelae\" (de Hoz 2010).\n\nThe Turdetani of the Roman period are generally considered the heirs of the Tartessian culture. Strabo mentions that: \"The Turdetanians are ranked as the wisest of the Iberians; and they make use of an alphabet, and possess records of their ancient history, poems, and laws written in verse that are six thousand years old, as they assert.\" It is not known when Tartessian ceased to be spoken, but Strabo (writing c. 7 BC) records that \"The Turdetanians ... and particularly those that live about the Baetis, have completely changed over to the Roman mode of life; with most of the populace not even remembering their own language any more.\"\n\nTartessian inscriptions are in the Southwestern script, which is also known as the Tartessian or South Lusitanian script. Like all other Paleo-Hispanic scripts, except for the Greco-Iberian alphabet, Tartessian uses syllabic glyphs for plosive consonants and alphabetic letters for other consonants. Thus, it is a mixture of an alphabet and a syllabary that is called a semi-syllabary. Some researchers believe these scripts are descended solely from the Phoenician alphabet, but others that the Greek alphabet had an influence as well.\n\nThe Tartessian script is very similar to the Southeastern Iberian script, both in the shapes of the signs and in their values. The main difference is that the Southeastern Iberian script does not redundantly mark the vocalic values of syllabic characters, which was discovered by Ulrich Schmoll and allows the classification of most of the characters into vowels, consonants and syllabic characters. As of the 1990s, the decipherment of the script was largely complete and so the sound values of most of the characters are known. Like most other Paleo-Hispanic scripts, Tartessian does not distinguish between voiced and unvoiced consonants ( from , from or from ).\n\nTartessian is written in \"scriptio continua\", which complicates the identification of individual words.\n\nTartessian is generally left unclassified for lack of data or proposed to be a language isolate for lack of connections to the Indo-European languages. Some Tartessian names have been interpreted as Indo-European, more specifically as Celtic. However, the language as a whole remains inexplicable from the Celtic or Indo-European point of view; the structure of Tartessian syllables appears to be incompatible with Celtic or even Indo-European phonetics and more compatible with Iberian or Basque; all Celtic elements are thought to be borrowings by some scholars.\n\nSince 2009, John T. Koch has argued that Tartessian is a Celtic language and that the texts can be translated. Koch's thesis has been popularised by the BBC TV series \"The Celts: Blood, Iron and Sacrifice\" and the associated book by Alice Roberts.\n\nHowever, his proposals have been regarded with scepticism by academic linguists and the script, which is \"hardly suitable for the denotation of an Indo-European language[,] leaves ample room for interpretation\". In 2015, Terrence Kaufman published a book that suggested that Tartessian was a Celtic language but written using a script devised \ninitially for a Vasconic \"Hipponic\" language (numerous SW placenames in -i(p)po(n)) although there are no extant inscriptions in such a language using the Tartessian script.\n\nThis is the longest Tartessian text known at present, with 82 signs, 80 of which have an identifiable phonetic value. The text is complete if it is assumed that the damaged portion contains a common, if poorly-understood, Tartessian phrase-form \"bᵃare naŕkᵉe[n—]\" (Guerra 2009). The formula contains two groups of Tartessian stems that appear to inflect as verbs: \"naŕkᵉe\", \"naŕkᵉen\", naŕkᵉeii, naŕkᵉenii, \"naŕkᵉentᶤi\", \"naŕkᵉenai\" and \"bᵃare\", \"bᵃaren\", \"bᵃareii\", \"bᵃarentᶤi\" from comparison with other inscriptions (Guerra 2009).\n\n\n\n"}

After the death of his title-holding family, Le Peletier gained a vast amount of wealth.\n\nLe Peletier entered into politics by becoming a lawyer (\"avocat\") in the employ of the Place du Châtelet, a prison. In 1785 he was advanced to avocat-general. In 1789 he was elected to the Parlement of Paris, and in that same year he became a deputy of the \"noblesse\" to the States-General.\n\nInitially, he shared the conservative views of the majority of his class, but by degrees his ideas changed and became increasingly radical. On 13 July 1789 he demanded the recall of Necker, whose dismissal by the king had aroused great excitement in Paris. In the Constituent Assembly he moved the abolition of the death penalty, of the galleys and of branding, and the substitution of beheading for hanging. This attitude won him great popularity, and on 21 June 1790 he was made president of the Constituent Assembly. He remained in this position until 5 July 1790.\n\nDuring the existence of the Legislative Assembly, he was elected President of the General Council for the Yonne \"département\" in 1791. He was then elected by this \"département\" to become a deputy to the Convention. Here he was in favor of the trial of Louis XVI by the Assembly and was a deciding vote for the death of the king.\n\nWhile in the Convention, Le Peletier focused mainly on revolutionary reform of education, promoting a Spartan education. It called for both males and females to be taught in state-run schools and taught revolutionary ideas instead of the customary history, science, mathematics, language and religion. His educational plan was supported by Robespierre and his ideas were borrowed in later schemes, notably by Jules Ferry.\n\nOn 20 January 1793, the eve of the king's execution, Le Peletier was assassinated in a restaurant in the Palais Royal. His murderer, Philippe Nicolas Marie de Pâris, a member of the Garde du Corps, allegedly plunged a saber that he had hidden under his cloak into Le Peletier's chest. His assassin fled to Normandy, where, on the point of being discovered, he supposedly shot himself in the head. Other sources claim the real murderer fled to England where he died years later.\n\nThe Convention honored Louis Michel Le Peletier with a magnificent funeral. His body was displayed in the Place Vendôme beneath the statue of King Louis XIV. Le Peletier was buried in the Panthéon in Paris in 1793. His body was removed by his family on 14 February 1795.\n\nJust a month after the assassination, on 23 February 1793, the Opéra-Comique presented the first of four performances of a musical treatment of his life and death called \"Le Peletier de Saint-Fargeau, ou Le premier martyr de la République française\", with a libretto by Auguste-Louis Bertin d'Antilly and music by Frédéric Blasius.\n\nThe station Saint-Fargeau of the Paris Métro is named for him.\n\nA Sèvres biscuit porcelain bust of Louis Michel Le Peletier is on display in the Château de Vizille, Isère.\n\nOn 30 September 1793 the French Navy's ship \"Séduisant\", one of two newly commissioned ships, with 74 guns, over 56 meters in length and 1550 tons in weight, was renamed \"Peletier\". On 30 May 1795, the ship reverted to her original name \"Séduisant\".\n\nThe painter Jacques-Louis David represented his death in a famous painting, \"Les Derniers moments de Michel Lepeletier\" or \"Lepelletier de Saint-Fargeau sur son lit de mort\". David described his painting of Le Peletier's face as \"Serene, that is because when one dies for one's country, one has nothing with which to reproach oneself.\" This painting, known only through a drawing made by a pupil of David, is considered by scholars the first official painting of the French Revolution, a rehearsal for David's later achievement \"The Death of Marat\".\n\nLe Peletier had a brother, Felix (1769–1837), well known for his advanced ideas, and a brother Amédée Louis Michel Lepeletier de Saint Fargeau (1770–1845), a noted entomologist. The writer and academician Jean d'Ormesson is descended from his daughter Suzanne le Peletier de Saint-Fargeau.\n\nLe Peletier appears as an antagonist in \"Assassin's Creed Unity\", where he is depicted as a secret member of the Templar Order under Grand Master Francois-Thomas Germain who believes that he is doing what is right for France before what is right for the Templars. He is assassinated by the protagonist Arno Dorian in the Palais-Royale after he votes to have the king executed.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2268114", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2268114", "title": "Autonegotiation", "text": "Autonegotiation\n\nAutonegotiation is a signaling mechanism and procedure used by Ethernet over twisted pair by which two connected devices choose common transmission parameters, such as speed, duplex mode, and flow control. In this process, the connected devices first share their capabilities regarding these parameters and then choose the highest performance transmission mode they both support.\n\nAutonegotiation is defined in clause 28 of IEEE 802.3. and was originally an optional component in the Fast Ethernet standard. It is backwards compatible with the normal link pulses (NLP) used by 10BASE-T. The protocol was significantly extended in the gigabit Ethernet standard, and is mandatory for 1000BASE-T gigabit Ethernet over twisted pair.\n\nIn the OSI model, autonegotiation resides in the physical layer.\n\nIn 1995, the IEEE 802.3u standard was released to allow connected network adapters to negotiate the best possible shared mode of operation. The initial autonegotiation standard contained a mechanism for detecting the speed but not the duplex setting of Ethernet peers that did not use autonegotiation. The protocol that became IEEE 802.3 clause 28 was developed from a patented technology by National Semiconductor known as NWay. The company gave a letter of assurance for anyone to use their system for a one time license fee. Another company has since bought the rights to that patent.\n\nThe first version of the autonegotiation specification, in the 1995 Fast Ethernet standard IEEE 802.3u, was open to different interpretations. Although most manufacturers implemented this standard in one way, some others, including network giant Cisco, implemented it in a different way. Autonegotiation between devices that implemented it differently failed. Problems like this with autonegotiation led many network administrators to manually set the speed and duplex mode of each network interface card. However, the use of manually set configuration may also lead to duplex mismatches, in particular when two connected devices are:\n\nDuplex mismatch problems are difficult to diagnose because the network is apparently working, and simple programs used for network tests such as ping report a valid connection; however, the network is much slower than expected.\n\nThe debatable portions of the autonegotiation specifications were eliminated by the 1998 release of 802.3. This was later followed by the release of the Gigabit Ethernet standard IEEE 802.3ab in 1999. The new standard specified that 1000BASE-T Ethernet at 1 Gbit/s over copper wiring requires autonegotiation. Currently, most network equipment manufacturers recommend using autonegotiation on all access ports and enable it as a factory default setting.\n\nThe standards for 1000BASE-TX and 10GBASE-T also require autonegotiation.\n\nAutonegotiation can be used by devices that are capable of more than one transmission rate, different duplex modes (half duplex and full duplex), and different standards at the same speed (though in practice only one standard at each speed is widely supported). Each device declares its \"technology abilities\", that is, its possible modes of operation, and the best mode is chosen from those shared between them, with higher speed preferred over lower, and full duplex preferred over half duplex at the same speed.\n\nParallel detection is used when a device that is capable of autonegotiation is connected to one that is not. This happens if a device does not support autonegotiation or autonegotiation is administratively disabled on a device. In this condition, the device that is capable of autonegotiation can determine and match speed with the other device. This procedure cannot determine duplex capability, so half duplex is always assumed.\n\nOther than speed and duplex mode, autonegotiation is used to communicate the port type (single port or multiport) and the master-slave parameters (whether it is manually configured or not, whether the device is master or slave if this is the case, and the master-slave seed bit otherwise).\n\nUpon receipt of the technology abilities of the other device, both devices decide the best possible mode of operation supported by both devices. The priority among modes specified in the 2018 edition of 802.3 is as follows:\n\nIn other words, among the modes that are supported by both devices, each device chooses the one that is the topmost in this list.\n\nAutonegotiation is based on pulses similar to those used by 10BASE-T devices to detect the presence of a connection to another device. These \"connection present\" pulses are sent by Ethernet devices when they are not sending or receiving any frames. They are unipolar positive-only electrical pulses of a nominal duration of 100 ns, with a maximum pulse width of 200 ns, generated at a 16 ms time interval (with a timing variation tolerance of 8 ms). These pulses are called \"link integrity test\" (LIT) pulses in the 10BASE-T terminology, and are referred to as \"normal link pulses\" (NLP) in the auto-negotiation specification.\n\nA device detects the failure of a link if neither a frame nor two of the LIT pulses is received for 50-150 ms. For this scheme to work, devices must send LIT pulses regardless of receiving any.\nAuto-negotiation uses similar pulses labeled as NLP. NLP are still unipolar, positive-only, and of the nominal duration of 100 ns; but each LIT is replaced by a pulse burst consisting of 17 to 33 pulses sent 125 µs apart. Each such pulse burst is called a fast link pulse (FLP) burst. The time interval between the start of each FLP burst is the same 16 milliseconds as between normal link pulses (variation tolerance of 8 ms).\nThe FLP burst consists of 17 NLP at a 125 µs time interval (with a tolerance of 14 µs). Between each pair of two consecutive NLP (i.e. at 62.5 µs after first NLP of the pulse pair) an additional positive pulse may be present. The presence of this additional pulse indicates a logical 1, its absence a logical 0. As a result, every FLP contains a data word of 16 bits. This data word is called a link code word (LCW). The bits of the link code word are numbered from 0 to 15, where bit 0 corresponds to the first possible pulse in time and bit 15 to the last.\n\nEvery fast link pulse burst transmits a word of 16 bits known as a link code word. The first such word is known as a \"base link code word\", and its bits are used as follows:\n\n\nThe technology ability field is composed of eight bits. For IEEE 802.3, these are as follows:\n\n\nThe acknowledgement bit is used to signal the correct reception of the base code word. This corresponds to having received three identical copies of the base code word. Upon receiving these three identical copies, the device sends a link code word with the acknowledge bit set to one from six times to eight times.\n\nThe link code words are also called \"pages\". The base link code word is therefore called a base page. The next page bit of the base page is 1 when the device intends to send other pages, which can be used to communicate other abilities. These additional pages are sent only if both devices have sent base pages with a next page bit set to 1. The additional pages are still encoded as link code words (using 17 clock pulses and up to 16 bit pulses).\n\nThe base page (the base link code word) is sufficient for devices to advertise which ones among the 10BASE-T, 100BASE-TX and 100BASE-T4 modes they support. For gigabit Ethernet, two other pages are required. These pages are sent if both devices have sent base pages with a next page bit set to one.\n\nThe additional pages are of two kinds: \"message pages\" and \"unformatted pages\". These pages are still 16-bit words encoded as pulses in the same way as the base page. Their first eleven bits are data, while their second-to-last bit indicates whether the page is a message page or an unformatted page. The last bit of each page indicates the presence of an additional page.\n\nThe 1000BASE-T supported modes and master-slave data (which is used to decide which of the two devices acts as the master, and which one acts as the slave) are sent using a single message page, followed by a single unformatted page. The message page contains:\n\n\nThe unformatted page contains a 10-bit word, called a master-slave seed value.\n\nA duplex mismatch occurs when two connected devices are configured in different duplex modes. This may happen for example if one is configured for autonegotiation while the other one has a fixed mode of operation that is full duplex (no autonegotiation). In such conditions, the autonegotiation device correctly detects the speed of operation, but is unable to correctly detect the duplex mode. As a result, it sets the correct speed but starts using the half-duplex mode.\n\nWhen a device is operating in full duplex while the other one operates in half duplex, the connection works only at a very low throughput when both devices attempt to send frames at the same time. This is because data can be sent in both directions at the same time in full-duplex mode, but only in one direction at a time in half-duplex mode. As a result, a full-duplex device may transmit data while it is receiving. However, if the other device is working in half duplex, it does not expect to receive data (because it is currently sending); therefore, it senses a collision and attempts to resend the frame it was sending. Depending on timing, the half-duplex device may sense a late collision, which it will interpret as a hard error rather than a normal consequence of CSMA/CD and may not attempt to resend the frame. On the other hand, the full-duplex device does not detect any collision and does not resend the frame, even if the other device has discarded it as corrupted by collision. Still, the full-duplex device, not expecting incoming frames to be truncated by collision detection, will report frame check sequence errors from the aborted frames the half-duplex device attempted to send. This combination of (late) collisions reported at the half-duplex end and FCS errors reported by the full-duplex end can be used as an indication that a duplex mismatch is present.\n\nThis packet loss happens when both devices are transmitting at the same time. This may happen even when the link is used, from the user's perspective, in one direction only. A TCP stream requires all packets sent to be acknowledged by the receiving device. As a result, even if actual data is sent in one direction only, collision may be generated with acknowledgement packets traveling in the other direction.\n\nAutonegotiation is covered by the US patents\n,\n,\n\n971,018 (filed 1992-11-02),\n146,729 (filed 1993-11-01),\n430,143 (filed 1995-04-26);\nEuropean Patent Applications SN 93308568.0 (DE, FR, GB, IT, NL);\nKorean Patent No. 286791;\nTaiwanese Patent No. 098359;\nJapanese Patent No. 3705610;\nJapanese Patent 4234.

Barkan started his career as a fashion photographer.\n\nBarkan worked as a fashion photographer for fifteen years in Paris, London and New York, before returning to Israel in 1998 to open his own modeling agency in Tel Aviv. Barkan, who worked with Elite Model Management, discovered a number of models including Sendi Bar.\n\nIn 2001 he started publishing the \"Bikini\" magazine, which mostly featured photographs of models in swimsuits. It was heavily promoted through advertisement on bus stops, although it was discontinued after less than year due to low sales and public outcry about its indecency.\n\nAfter speaking on television about his experience with model Hila Elmalich, an anorexic whom he rushed to hospital after she collapsed and who later died, Barkan was deluged by telephone calls from girls and young women suffering from anorexia. This experience persuaded him to require all of his models to submit to body mass index (BMI) exams to demonstrate their physical health and lack of an eating disorder.\n\nWorking with Member of Knesset Inbal Gavriely, he successfully submitted legislation to the Israeli Knesset in December, 2004, requiring all modeling agencies in Israel to use the BMI exam, making Israel one of the first countries to pass such a bill. Subsequently, an agency will not be allowed to continue representing a model unless she submits to a health test every three months and receives higher than 18.5 BMI. Any agency that does not comply will be fined accordingly and all forms will be monitored by the Israeli Health Ministry.

Park areas extend to the north and west of the moat.\n\nDitton Park House and its courtyard walls, stables and observatory are Grade II listed on the National Heritage List for England (i.e. in the initial category).\n\nDitton Park belonged to the crown in the reign of Queen Elizabeth I and is in the ancient parish of Stoke Poges. It then belonged to Sir Ralph Winwood and passed to Ralph Montagu, 1st Duke of Montagu, through marriage. The direct precursor to the present house was probably built around the early 1600s and was taken down as damaged by fire in 1812. The earlier house here was crenellated or fortified by John de Moleyns in 1331. In it or a later house, then a royal residence, the infant Princess Mary passed the autumn of 1517. It was enlarged at various times and is said to have been rebuilt by Sir Ralph Winwood in the early 17th century. The small building near the south-east corner of the park, formerly a chantry, became a chapel by 1925 served by the vicar of Datchet, since a few years later disused.\n\nIts turrets and pale stucco crenelations bear a resemblance to earlier Strawberry Hill House, a prototype of the Gothic Revival architecture. Its warm, peach colour and tall symmetry reflects a movement towards Romantic architecture common in many of the high aristocracy's folly castles erected in the early 19th century. The house for much of the rest of the century when it was erected was the English home of Charlotte Anne, the Duchess then Dowager Duchess of Duke of Buccleugh (d.1895). This supplemented homes including the Scottish castles occupied frequently by her and by her son. Ditton Park House was by 1925 occupied by Lord Wolverton. The present square mansion, to which access is obtained by a drawbridge over the moat, stood in 1925 in a wider well-wooded park of . The house and chapel were entirely rebuilt by Elizabeth, Duchess of Buccleugh (born Elizabeth Montague also then spelt Montague) in 1812 and contains (or contained in 1925) many fittings from the former house, including the late 15th-century font, much 16th and 17th-century stained glass, and a glazed tile with a shield of arms, a fesse between six crosslets. In 1925 some 17th-century outbuildings stood.\n\nNearby, on the Great West Road, a public house, the Montague Arms stands which is owned and operated as a Harvester restaurant, dating back to the early 19th century.\n\nIn 1917 the remainder of the property, its farming tenants having long taken control through copyhold of their own lands, was taken over for the Admiralty Compass Observatory, which used the house and its immediate grounds. In 1920 an area, West Park, began to be used for radio research, which extended into North Park in 1924, and these activities eventually led to the formation of the Radio Research Station. It was here in 1935 that the idea for the development of the British radar defence system was conceived, code-named Chain Home. In the late 1990s, concern was raised regarding disturbing radioactive buried material from the World War II burial of radium-based, luminous paints.\n\nThe property was sold to Computer Associates in 1997 which became CA Technologies.\n\nThe house and whole manor was in part of the long north-south ancient parish of Stoke Poges which was in the southern extreme of the English county of Buckinghamshire, before boundary reorganisations: in 1974 it was moved to Berkshire; and in 1998 full local government administrative powers were granted to Slough Unitary Authority in that ceremonial county.\n"}

It has white or silvery grey bark, lance-shaped or curved adult leaves, flower buds in groups of between nine and fifteen, white flowers and conical or hemispherical fruit. It is one of three eucalypts with prominent insect scribbles in the bark.\n\n\"Eucalyptus haemastoma\" is a tree that typically grows to a height of and forms a lignotuber. It has smooth white, silvery grey or yellow bark with insect scribbles. Young plants and coppice regrowth have elliptical to oblong or egg-shaped leaves that are long and wide. Adult leaves are lance-shaped or curved, the same shade of green on both sides, long and wide on a petiole long. The flower buds are arranged in leaf axils in groups of between nine and fifteen on an unbranched peduncle long, the individual buds on pedicels long. Mature buds are oval, long and wide with a conical to rounded operculum. Flowering occurs between July and November and the flowers are white. The fruit is a woody, conical or hemispherical capsule long and wide with the valves near rim level.\n\nThis species intergrades with \"E. racemosa\", also a scribbly gum, mainly in the south of the Sydney area. A third scribbly gum, \"E. rossii\" is found further inland, on the slopes and tablelands between Tenterfield and Bombala.\n\n\"Eucalyptus haemastoma\" was first formally described in 1797 by James Edward Smith in \"Transactions of the Linnean Society of London\". Smith noted \"[f]ruit globose, cut off at the summit, its orifice surrounded by a broad deep-red border\". The specific epithet is derived from the Greek \"haima\", 'blood' and \"stoma\", 'mouth', referring to the reddish disc of the fruit.\n\nThis scribbly gum grows in woodland on shallow sandy soil derived from sandstone. It occurs in the Sydney region between Lake Macquarie and the Royal National Park.\n\n"}
{"id": "2268160", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2268160", "title": "Hip", "text": "Hip\n\nIn vertebrate anatomy, hip (or \"coxa\" in medical terminology) refers to either an anatomical region or a joint.\n\nThe hip region is located lateral and anterior to the gluteal region, inferior to the iliac crest, and overlying the greater trochanter of the femur, or \"thigh bone\". In adults, three of the bones of the pelvis have fused into the hip bone or acetabulum which forms part of the hip region.\n\nThe hip joint, scientifically referred to as the acetabulofemoral joint (\"art. coxae\"), is the joint between the femur and acetabulum of the pelvis and its primary function is to support the weight of the body in both static (e.g. standing) and dynamic (e.g. walking or running) postures. The hip joints have very important roles in retaining balance, and for maintaining the pelvic inclination angle.\n\nPain of the hip may be the result of numerous causes, including nervous, osteoarthritic, infectious, traumatic, and genetic.\n\nThe proximal femur is largely covered by muscles and, as a consequence, the greater trochanter is often the only palpable bony structure in the hip region.\n\nThe hip joint is a synovial joint formed by the articulation of the rounded head of the femur and the cup-like acetabulum of the pelvis. It forms the primary connection between the bones of the lower limb and the axial skeleton of the trunk and pelvis. Both joint surfaces are covered with a strong but lubricated layer called articular hyaline cartilage.\n\nThe cuplike acetabulum forms at the union of three pelvic bones — the ilium, pubis, and ischium. The Y-shaped growth plate that separates them, the triradiate cartilage, is fused definitively at ages 14–16. It is a special type of spheroidal or ball and socket joint where the roughly spherical femoral head is largely contained within the acetabulum and has an average radius of curvature of 2.5 cm. The acetabulum grasps almost half the femoral ball, a grip augmented by a ring-shaped fibrocartilaginous lip, the acetabular labrum, which extends the joint beyond the equator. The joint space between the femoral head and the superior acetabulum is normally between 2 and 7 mm.\n\nThe head of the femur is attached to the shaft by a thin neck region that is often prone to fracture in the elderly, which is mainly due to the degenerative effects of osteoporosis.\n\nThe acetabulum is oriented inferiorly, laterally and anteriorly, while the femoral neck is directed superiorly, medially, and slightly anteriorly.\n\n\nThe angle between the longitudinal axes of the femoral neck and shaft, called the caput-collum-diaphyseal angle or CCD angle, normally measures approximately 150° in newborn and 126° in adults (\"coxa norma\").\n\nAn abnormally small angle is known as \"coxa vara\" and an abnormally large angle as \"coxa valga\". Because changes in shape of the femur naturally affects the knee, \"coxa valga\" is often combined with \"genu varum\" (bow-leggedness), while \"coxa vara\" leads to \"genu valgum\" (knock-knees).\n\nChanges in the CCD angle is the result of changes in the stress patterns applied to the hip joint. Such changes, caused for example by a dislocation, change the trabecular patterns inside the bones. Two continuous trabecular systems emerging on the auricular surface of the sacroiliac joint meander and criss-cross each other down through the hip bone, the femoral head, neck, and shaft.\n\n\nOn the lateral side of the hip joint the fascia lata is strengthened to form the iliotibial tract which functions as a tension band and reduces the bending loads on the proximal part of the femur.\n\nThe capsule attaches to the hip bone outside the acetabular lip which thus projects into the capsular space. On the femoral side, the distance between the head's cartilaginous rim and the capsular attachment at the base of the neck is constant, which leaves a wider extracapsular part of the neck at the back than at the front.\n\nThe strong but loose fibrous capsule of the hip joint permits the hip joint to have the second largest range of movement (second only to the shoulder) and yet support the weight of the body, arms and head.\n\nThe capsule has two sets of fibers: longitudinal and circular.\n\n\nThe hip joint is reinforced by four ligaments, of which three are extracapsular and one intracapsular.\n\nThe extracapsular ligaments are the iliofemoral, ischiofemoral, and pubofemoral ligaments attached to the bones of the pelvis (the ilium, ischium, and pubis respectively). All three strengthen the capsule and prevent an excessive range of movement in the joint. Of these, the Y-shaped and twisted iliofemoral ligament is the strongest ligament in the human body.\nIn the upright position, it prevents the trunk from falling backward without the need for muscular activity. In the sitting position, it becomes relaxed, thus permitting the pelvis to tilt backward into its sitting position. The iliofemoral ligament prevents excessive adduction and internal rotation of the hip. The ischiofemoral ligament prevents medial (internal) rotation while the pubofemoral ligament restricts abduction and internal rotation of the hip joint.\nThe zona orbicularis, which lies like a collar around the most narrow part of the femoral neck, is covered by the other ligaments which partly radiate into it. The zona orbicularis acts like a buttonhole on the femoral head and assists in maintaining the contact in the joint.\nAll three ligaments become taut when the joint is extended - this stabilises the joint, and reduces the energy demand of muscles when standing.\n\nThe intracapsular ligament, the ligamentum teres, is attached to a depression in the acetabulum (the acetabular notch) and a depression on the femoral head (the fovea of the head). It is only stretched when the hip is dislocated, and may then prevent further displacement.\nIt is not that important as a ligament but can often be vitally important as a conduit of a small artery to the head of the femur, that is, the . This artery is not present in everyone but can become the only blood supply to the bone in the head of the femur when the neck of the femur is fractured or disrupted by injury in childhood.\n\nThe hip joint is supplied with blood from the medial circumflex femoral and lateral circumflex femoral arteries, which are both usually branches of the deep artery of the thigh (profunda femoris), but there are numerous variations and one or both may also arise directly from the femoral artery. There is also a small contribution from the foveal artery, a small vessel in the ligament of the head of the femur which is a branch of the posterior division of the obturator artery, which becomes important to avoid avascular necrosis of the head of the femur when the blood supply from the medial and lateral circumflex arteries are disrupted (e.g. through fracture of the neck of the femur along their course).\n\nThe hip has two anatomically important anastomoses, the cruciate and the trochanteric anastomoses, the latter of which provides most of the blood to the head of the femur. These anastomoses exist between the femoral artery or profunda femoris and the gluteal vessels.\n\nThe hip muscles act on three mutually perpendicular main axes, all of which pass through the center of the femoral head, resulting in three degrees of freedom and three pair of principal directions: Flexion and extension around a transverse axis (left-right); lateral rotation and medial rotation around a longitudinal axis (along the thigh); and abduction and adduction around a sagittal axis (forward-backward); and a combination of these movements (i.e. circumduction, a compound movement in which the leg describes the surface of an irregular cone).\nSome of the hip muscles also act on either the vertebral joints or the knee joint, that with their extensive areas of origin and/or insertion, different part of individual muscles participate in very different movements, and that the range of movement varies with the position of the hip joint.\nAdditionally, the inferior and superior gemelli may be termed \"triceps coxae\" together with the obturator internus, and their function simply is to assist the latter muscle.\n\nThe movements of the hip joint is thus performed by a series of muscles which are here presented in order of importance with the range of motion from the neutral zero-degree position indicated:\n\n\nA hip fracture is a break that occurs in the upper part of the femur. Symptoms may include pain around the hip particularly with movement and shortening of the leg. The hip joint can be replaced by a prosthesis in a hip replacement operation due to fractures or illnesses such as osteoarthritis. Hip pain can have multiple sources and can also be associated with lower back pain.\n\nIn humans, unlike other animals, the hip bones are substantially different in the two sexes. The hips of human females widen during puberty. The femora are also more widely spaced in females, so as to widen the opening in the hip bone and thus facilitate childbirth. Finally, the ilium and its muscle attachment are shaped so as to situate the buttocks away from the birth canal, where contraction of the buttocks could otherwise damage the baby.\n\nThe female hips have long been associated with both fertility and general expression of sexuality. Since broad hips facilitate child birth and also serve as an anatomical cue of sexual maturity, they have been seen as an attractive trait for women for thousands of years. Many of the classical poses women take when sculpted, painted or photographed, such as the \"Grande Odalisque\", serve to emphasize the prominence of their hips. Similarly, women's fashion through the ages has often drawn attention to the girth of the wearer's hips.\n\n\n\n"}

His work in rhinoplastic and maxillofacial surgery established many modern techniques of reconstructive surgery. His endeavours comprehended subcutaneous operations such as tenotomy, the surgical division of a tendon. Before the discovery of blood typing and blood matching, Dr. Dieffenbach researched blood transfusion, about which he published \"Die Transfusion des Blutes und die Infusion der Arzneien in die Blutgefässe\" (1828).

Its proximal portion remains as the central artery of the retina. Regression of the hyaloid artery leaves a clear central zone through the vitreous humor, called the hyaloid canal or Cloquet's canal. Cloquet's canal is named after the French physician Jules Germain Cloquet (1790–1883) who first described it.\n\nOccasionally the artery may not fully regress, resulting in the condition \"persistent hyaloid artery\". More commonly, small remnants of the artery may remain. Free remnants can sometimes be seen as \"floaters\". An anterior remnant of the hyaloid artery can be seen in some people as Mittendorf's dot, a small pinpoint-like scar on the posterior surface of the lens.

The Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) selected him for a course in foreign intelligence at SHON, the foreign intelligence training school located at Balashikha, near Moscow.\n\nFitin became deputy chief of the NKVD's foreign intelligence in 1938, then a year later at the age of thirty-one became chief, with the rank of Lieutenant General. The Russian Foreign Intelligence Service credits Fitin with rebuilding the depleted foreign intelligence department after Stalin's Great Terror. Fitin also is credited with providing ample warning of the German Invasion of 22 June 1941 that began the German-Soviet War. Only the actual invasion saved Fitin from execution for providing the head of the NKVD, Lavrenty Beria, with information General Secretary of the CPSU, Joseph Stalin did not want to believe. Beria retained Fitin as chief of foreign intelligence until the war ended but demoted him.\n\nPavel Fitin thought it was important to build up a network of spies inside the Manhattan Project. However, at the beginning he was mainly reliant on Klaus Fuchs. Fitlin gave the project the codename \"Enormoz\". In November 1944 he reported: \"Despite participation by a large number of scientific organization and workers on the problem of Enormoz in the U.S., mainly known to us by agent data, their cultivation develops poorly. Therefore, the major part of data on the U.S. comes from the station in England. On the basis of information from London station, Moscow Center more than once sent to the New York station a work orientation and sent a ready agent, too (Klaus Fuchs).\"\n\nAnother important source was John Cairncross. Pavel Fitin reported to Vsevolod Merkulov: \"Valuable information on Enormoz is coming from the London station. The first materials on Enormoz were received in late 1941 from our source List (John Cairncross), containing valuable and absolutely secret documents both on the substance of the Enormoz problem and on measures by the British government to organize and develop work on the problem of atomic energy in our country. In connection with American and Canadian work on Enormoz, materials describing the state and progress of work in three countries - England, the U.S., and Canada - are all coming from the London station.\" \n\nAfter Beria was executed in 1953, Fitin was discharged from the NKVD and denied his pension. Fitin was unable to find employment until 1959.\n\nFitin attained the rank of lieutenant-general, and was awarded the Order of the Red Banner twice, the Order of the Red Star, the Red Banner of Tuva and of the Tuvan People's Republic.\n\nIn 1942, Joseph Stalin appointed Pavel Sudoplatov to head the intelligence work on the Manhattan Project, and to coordinate the data gathered by Soviet agents in England, Canada, and the United States. Most cables sent via the New York – Moscow connection were sent by KGB officer Leonid Kvasnikov, known as Anton, to Lieutenant General Pavel Mikhailovich Fitin, known as Viktor, who had been the head of the foreign intelligence section of the KGB at that time (NSA 2/9/44).\n\n\n\n"}

What is considered hip is continuously changing. Being \"hip\" is also about being informed about the latest ideas, styles, and developments.\n\nThe term \"hip\" is recorded in African American Vernacular English (AAVE) in the early 1900s. In the 1930s and 1940s, it had become a common slang term, particularly in the African-American-dominated jazz scene.\n\nThe exact origin of \"hip\" is unknown. There are many different explanations for the etymology of \"hip\", but they remain unproven\".\" Research and speculation by both amateur and professional etymologists suggest that \"hip\" is derived from an earlier form, \"hep\", but that is disputed. Many etymologists believe that the terms \"hip\", \"hep\", and \"hepcat\" derive from the west African Wolof language word \"hepicat\", which means \"one who has his eyes open\". Some etymologists reject this, however, tracing the origin of this putative etymology to David Dalby, a scholar of African languages who tentatively suggested the idea in the 1960s,\nand some have even adopted the denigration \"to cry Wolof\" as a general dismissal or belittlement of etymologies they believe to be based on \"superficial similarities\" rather than documented attribution.\n\nAlternative theories trace the word's origins to those who used opium recreationally. Because opium smokers commonly consumed the drug lying on their sides, or \"on the hip\", the term became a coded reference to the practice; and because opium smoking was a practice of socially influential trend-setting individuals, the cachet it enjoyed led to the circulation of the term \"hip\" by way of a kind of synecdoche. This etymology is, however, rejected by Sheidlower.\n\nSlang dictionaries of past centuries give a term \"hip\" or \"hyp\" meaning melancholy or bored, shortened from the word \"hypochondriac\". However, this usage, more prevalent around 1800, was virtually extinct by 1900.\n\nThe word \"hip\" in the sense of \"aware, in the know\" is first attested in a 1902 cartoon by Tad Dorgan, and first appeared in print in a 1904 novel by George Vere Hobart, \"Jim Hickey, A Story of the One-Night Stands\", where an African-American character uses the slang phrase \"Are you hip?\" Early currency of the term (as the past participle \"hipped\", meaning informed) is further documented in the 1914 novel \"The Auction Block\" by Rex Beach:\n\nAfter the Second World War, the term moved into general parlance. The English humorist P.G. Wodehouse has his aristocratic narrator, Bertie Wooster, use the term \"get hep\" in his 1946 novel \"Joy in the Morning\". Jack Kerouac described his mid-century contemporaries as \"the new American generation known as the 'Hip' (the Knowing)\"; In 1947, Harry \"The Hipster\" Gibson wrote the song \"It Ain't Hep\" about the switch from \"hep\" to \"hip\":\n\nHey you know there's a lot of talk going around about this hip and hep jive.

{"id": "2268197", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2268197", "title": "Confiteor", "text": "Confiteor\n\nThe Confiteor (so named from its first word or \"incipit\" in Latin, meaning \"I confess\" or \"I acknowledge\") is one of the prayers that can be said during the Penitential Act at the beginning of Mass of the Roman Rite in the Catholic Church. It is also said in the Lutheran Church at the beginning of the Divine Service, and by some Anglo-catholic Anglicans before Mass.\n\nWhile Eastern liturgies begin with a confession of sin made by the celebrant alone, the earliest records of the Roman Rite all describe the Mass as beginning with the introit. However, the celebrant may have used a \"Confiteor\"-like confession of sinfulness as one of the private prayers he said in the sacristy before he began Mass. Only in the 10th or 11th century is there any evidence of the preparation for Mass being made at the altar.\n\nSome prayers similar to the \"Confiteor\" appear earlier outside of Mass. The \"Canonical Rule\" of Chrodegang of Metz (d. 743) recommends: \"First of all prostrate yourself humbly in the sight of God ... and pray Blessed Mary with the holy Apostles and Martyrs and Confessors to pray to the Lord for you.\" And Ecgbert of York (d. 766) gives a short form that is the germ of our present prayer: \"Say to him to whom you wish to confess your sins: through my fault that I have sinned exceedingly in thought, word, and deed.\" In answer the confessor says almost exactly the \"Misereatur\".\n\nThe \"Confiteor\" is first found quoted as part of the introduction of the Mass in Bernold of Constance (died 1100). The \"Misereatur\" and \"Indulgentiam\" prayers follow, the former slightly different but the latter exactly as in the Tridentine Missal. The Tridentine form of the \"Confiteor\" is found in the 14th-century \"Ordo Romanus XIV\" with only a slight modification, and is found word for word in a decree of the Third Council of Ravenna (1314).\n\nIn the Middle Ages, the form of the \"Confiteor\" and especially the list of the saints whom it invoked varied considerably. The Carthusian, Carmelite, and Dominican Orders, whose Missals, having by then existed for more than 200 years, were still allowed after 1570, had forms of the \"Confiteor\" different from that in the Tridentine Missal. These three forms were quite short, and contained only one \"\"mea culpa\"\"; the Dominicans invoked, besides the Blessed Virgin, Saint Dominic. Moreover, some other orders had the privilege of adding the name of their founder after that of St. Paul. The Franciscans for instance inserted the name of Francis of Assisi, and many Benedictine houses added the name of their founder, St. Benedict. The local patron was inserted at the same place in a few local uses.\n\nTo what is here taken from the \"Catholic Encyclopedia\" one can add the text of an elaborate (but ungrammatical) form of the \"Confiteor\" found in the \"Paenitentiale Vallicellanum II\", which has been attributed to the 9th century:\n\nIn all editions of the Tridentine Roman Missal from 1570 to 1962 the text of the \"Confiteor\" remained unvaried, but there were changes in the related rubrics and in the wording of the \"Misereatur\" prayer with which the servers responded to the priest's \"Confiteor\" and the priest to that of the servers. In the original Tridentine Roman Missal, promulgated and published by Pope Pius V in 1570, this prayer included the phrase \"dimissis omnibus peccatis vestris/tuis\" (\"forgive you \"all\" your sins\"); but in 1604 another Pope, Clement VIII, revised the original Tridentine Roman Missal of 1570, and, among other changes, removed the word \"omnibus\" (\"all\") from this prayer.\n\nSince 1970, the text of the \"Confiteor\" in the Roman Missal is as follows:\n\nThe form in the Tridentine Roman Missal (in Latin) is longer and is said twice, first by the priest in the following form, then by the altar server(s), who replace the words \"et vobis, fratres\", \"et vos, fratres\" (and you, brethren) with \"et tibi, pater\" and \"et te, pater\" (and you, Father).\n\nIn the Tridentine editions of the Roman Missal, if a priest celebrated Mass in the presence of the Pope or a cardinal, or of a nuncio, a patriarch, a metropolitan archbishop or a diocesan bishop within their own jurisdictions, he changed \"et vobis, fratres\", \"et vos, fratres\" (and you, brethren) into \"et tibi, pater\" and \"et te, pater\" (and you, Father) when reciting his own \"Confiteor\".\n\nUntil 1969, therefore, the \"Confiteor\" was spoken (not sung) twice at the beginning of Mass, after the recitation of Psalm 42/43, once by the priest and once by the server(s) or by the deacon and subdeacon. It was also said, once only (not by the priest), before Communion was distributed to the faithful, until Pope John XXIII in his 1960 Code of Rubrics had it omitted when Communion was distributed within Mass. As the pre-1962 editions of the Tridentine Missal did not envisage any distribution of Communion to the faithful within Mass, it was the rite of giving Communion to the faithful outside of Mass that was used even within Mass.\n\nThe Tridentine Roman Ritual also required recitation of the \"Confiteor\" before administration of Extreme Unction and the imparting of the Apostolic Blessing to a dying person. The Ritual's prescription that a penitent should begin their confession by reciting at least the opening words of the \"Confiteor\" was not generally observed.\n\nThe Caeremoniale Episcoporum of the time also laid down that, when a bishop sings high Mass, the deacon should sing the \"Confiteor\" after the sermon and before the bishop granted an indulgence. This custom, the only occasion on which the \"Confiteor\" was to be sung rather than recited, had fallen into disuse even before the twentieth century.\n\nIn the Divine Office, the \"Confiteor\" was often said at Prime and almost always at Compline.\n\nSince 1969, the Roman Ritual, the Caeremoniale Episcoporum, and the Liturgy of the Hours no longer require recitation of this particular prayer.\n\nAs stated above, Pope John XXIII's 1960 Code of Rubrics and his 1962 edition of the Tridentine Roman Missal, use of which is authorized under the conditions indicated in the 2007 motu proprio \"Summorum Pontificum\", removed the recitation of the \"Confiteor\" immediately before the distribution of Holy Communion to the people. Nonetheless, in some places where the 1962 Roman Missal is used, this additional \"Confiteor\" is in fact recited. A 2011 survey showed that this practice, though controversial, is quite common. Especially in the United States, traditionalist Catholics argue that it should be restored.\n\nTridentine editions of the Roman Missal prescribed that the priest should make a profound bow to the altar while reciting the \"Confiteor\" with joined hands and that he should remain bowed until the server or servers began their recitation of the \"Confiteor\".\n\nFrom 1604 to 1962, the Roman Missal also prescribed that, at the words \"mea culpa, mea culpa, mea maxima culpa\", those reciting the \"Confiteor\" should strike their breast three times. Neither the original (1570) Tridentine edition of the Roman Missal nor the Vatican II editions (from 1970 on) specify the number of times. No edition specifies the form of the breast-beating, except to say that it is to be done with the right hand. That the hand should be clenched into a fist is stated by some and denied by others. Saint Augustine of Hippo said: \"No sooner have you heard the word 'Confiteor', than you strike your breast. What does this mean except that you wish to bring to light what is concealed in the breast, and by this act to cleanse your hidden sins?\" (Sermo de verbis Domini, 13), and Saint Jerome said: \"We strike our breast, because the breast is the seat of evil thoughts: we wish to dispel these thoughts, we wish to purify our hearts\" (In Ezechiel, xviii). This gesture of sorrow for sin is found in Scripture, as for instance in and .\n\nTridentine editions prescribed that a prayer be said for the person who recited the Confiteor. After the priest's recitation, the server(s) prayed: \"Misereátur tui omnípotens Deus, et dimíssis peccátis tuis, perdúcat te ad vitam ætérnam\" (May Almighty God have mercy upon you and, your sins having been forgiven, may He bring you to eternal life). And the priest responded: \"Amen\". After the recitation by the server(s), the priest said the same prayer (with \"vestri\" and \"vestris\", \"you\" plural, not \"you\" singular), and the server(s) answers: \"Amen\". In editions since 1970, in which the \"Confiteor\" is recited jointly, this prayer is said by the priest alone, replacing \"vestri\" and \"vestris\" (\"you\" and \"your\") with \"nostri\" and \"nostris\" (\"us\" and \"our\"). The official English translation is: \"May almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us our sins, and bring us to everlasting life.\"\n\nThis prayer is referred to as the \"absolution\", a prayer for forgiveness, not a granting of forgiveness as in the Sacrament of Penance. It is therefore classified as a sacramental, not a sacrament.\n\nTridentine editions of the Roman Missal included a second prayer of absolution, said by the priest alone: \"Indulgéntiam, absolutiónem, et remissiónem peccatórum nostrórum tríbuat nobis omnípotens et miséricors Dóminus\" (May the Almighty and merciful God grant us pardon, absolution, and remission of our sins). The server(s) or deacon and subdeacon responded to this also with \"Amen\".\n\nMarc-Antoine Charpentier: 4 compositions 1670 - 1690, H 151, H 200 - 200 a, H 225, H 220.\n\nIt is Lutheran tradition for the \"Confiteor\" to be recited by the congregation at the beginning of each Divine Service. The following is a common text, similar to the 2010 ICEL translation:\nI confess to God Almighty, before the whole company of heaven, and to you, my brothers and sisters, that I have sinned in thought, word, and deed; in what I have done and in what I have failed to do, by my fault, by my fault, by my most grievous fault; wherefore I pray God Almighty to have mercy on me, forgive me all my sins, and bring me to everlasting life. Amen.\n\n"}

His first work was a poem on \"Joan of Arc\" (1804); but he wrote at the same time a \"Grammaire général synthétique\", which attracted the attention of J. M. de Gérando, then secretary-general to the ministry of the interior. The latter found him a minor post in his department, which left him leisure for his historical work. He even took him to Italy when Napoleon was trying to organize, after French models, the Roman states which he had taken from the Pope in 1809. Leber however did not stay there long, for he considered the attacks on the temporal property of the Holy See to be sacrilegious.\n\nOn his return to Paris Leber resumed his administrative work, literary recreations and historical researches. While spending a part of his time writing vaudevilles and comic operas, he began to collect old essays and rare pamphlets by old French historians. His office was preserved to him by the Restoration, and Leber put his literary gifts at the service of the government. When the question of the coronation of Louis XVIII arose, he wrote, as an answer to Volney, a minute treatise on the \"Cérémonies du sacre\", which was published at the time of the coronation of Charles X.\n\nTowards the end of Villèle's ministry, when there was a movement of public opinion in favour of extending municipal liberties, Leber undertook the defence of the threatened system of centralization, and composed, in answer to François Raynouard, an \"Histoire critique du pouvoir municipal depuis l'origine de la monarchie jusqu'à nos jours\" (1828). He also wrote a treatise entitled \"De l'état réel de la presse et des pamphlets depuis François Iᵉʳ jusqu'à Louis XIV\" (1834), in which be refuted an empty paradox of Charles Nodier, who had tried to prove that the press had never been, and could never be, so free as under the Grand Monarch.\n\nA few years later, Leber retired (1839), and sold to the library of Rouen the rich collection of books which he had amassed during thirty years of research. The catalogue he made himself (4 vols., 1839 to 1852). In 1840 he read at the Academie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres two dissertations, an \"Essai sur l'appreciation de la fortune privée au moyen âge\", followed, by an \"Examen critique des tables de prix du marc d'argent depuis l'époque de Saint Louis\"; these essays were included by the Academy in its \"Recueil de mémoires présentés par divers savants\" (vol. i., 1844), and were also revised and published by Leber (1847). They form his most considerable work, and assure him a position of eminence in the economic history of France. He also rendered good service to historians by the publication of his \"Collection des meilleures dissertations, notices et traités relatifs à l'histoire de France\" (20 vols., 1826–1840); in the absence of an index, since Leber did not leave one, an analytical table of contents is to be found in Alfred Franklin's \"Sources de l'histoire de France\" (1876, pp. 342 sqq.). In consequence of the revolution of 1848, Leber decided to leave Paris. He retired to his native town, and spent his last years in collecting old engravings. He died at Orléans on 22 December 1859.\n\nIn 1832 Leber had been elected as a member of the \"Societé des Antiquaires de France\", and in the \"Bulletin\" of this society (vol. i., 1860) is to be found the most correct and detailed account of his life's works.\n"}

The term \"extraordinary\" distinguishes such a person from the ordinary minister of Holy Communion, namely a bishop, priest or deacon.\n\nCanon law permits that \"[w]here the needs of the Church require and ministers are not available, lay people, even though they are not lectors or acolytes, can supply certain of their functions, that is, exercise the ministry of the word, preside over liturgical prayers, confer baptism and distribute Holy Communion, in accordance with the provisions of the law.\" The term \"lay people\" does not distinguish between men and women.\n\nThe extraordinary minister's function is to distribute Holy Communion, either within Mass or by taking it to a sick person, when an ordained minister (bishop, priest or deacon) is absent or impeded.\n\nIn order to avoid confusion about this function, an extraordinary minister of Holy Communion is not to be called a \"special minister of Holy Communion\", nor an \"extraordinary Minister of the Eucharist\", nor a \"special minister of the Eucharist\".\n\nTen years before publication of the 1983 Code of Canon Law, some of these expressions were used in the instruction of the Sacred Congregation of the Sacraments \"Immensae caritatis\" of 29 January 1973. They are now reprobated.\n\nThe only minister of the Eucharist (that is, someone able to confect the Eucharistic species with bread and wine) is a priest or bishop.\n\nAn instituted acolyte is an extraordinary minister of Holy Communion by virtue of his institution. Such acolytes are in practice seminarians or former seminarians, or those in deacon formation, although canon law allows the ministry to be conferred on any lay men (\"viri laici\") who have the age and qualifications that the episcopal conference is to lay down. The local bishop, pastor, or priest celebrant may depute other lay Catholics for the function of extraordinary minister of Holy Communion, either for a single occasion or for a specified period of time, if there are reasons of real necessity. The commissioning need not take a liturgical form, but an appropriate blessing, which should in no way resemble ordination, may be imparted. In special cases of an unforeseen nature, the priest celebrating Mass may grant permission for a single occasion.\n\n\"If there is usually present a sufficient number of sacred ministers for the distribution of Holy Communion, extraordinary ministers of Holy Communion may not be appointed. Indeed, in such circumstances, those who may have already been appointed to this ministry should not exercise it. The practice of those priests is reprobated who, even though present at the celebration, abstain from distributing Communion and hand this function over to laypersons.\"\n\nThe extraordinary minister of Holy Communion may administer Communion only when the priest and deacon are lacking, when the priest is prevented by weakness or advanced age or some other genuine reason, or when the number of faithful coming to Communion is so great that the very celebration of Mass would be unduly prolonged. ... A brief prolongation, considering the circumstances and culture of the place, is not at all a sufficient reason.\"\n\nFor a time, extraordinary ministers of Holy Communion in the United States were allowed to purify the Communion vessels (such as ciboria and chalices), an action that the 2010 General Instruction of the Roman Missal expressly reserves for priest, deacon and instituted acolyte. The special indult authorizing that practice for three years, beginning in 2002, was not renewed.\n"}

It also features Marjorie Main, Keenan Wynn, Bert Freed, Moroni Olsen, Gladys Hurlbut, Madge Blake, Howard McNear, and Walter Baldwin. The picture was directed by Vincente Minnelli, working from a screenplay by Albert Hackett and Frances Goodrich.\n\nAs Nicholas Collini (Desi Arnaz) takes a new job as a civil engineer, his new bride Tacy (Lucille Ball) comes up with an idea to buy a trailer to travel around the USA to various work projects on which Nicky is employed, as well as to save money that would otherwise be spent on a house. Tacy also hopes to haul the trailer themselves to Nicky's new place of work in Colorado, as part of their honeymoon trip to the Sierra Nevada mountains. But the honeymoon trip, as well as happenings leading up to it, rapidly becomes a series of disasters.\n\nShortly after arriving at the trailer show, Tacy and Nicky come across a large trailer home, which Tacy instantly falls in love with. To tow the trailer, the Collinis end up buying a new car and trailer hitch, and the money spent starts to mount up.\n\nEarly in the trip, after being swamped by friendly trailer park neighbors their first night, Tacy decides to camp back in the woods the next night. But after turning on an old logging road, the trailer falls on its side into the mud during a rainstorm, which Nicky tries to level. The next day, the Collinis go to visit Tacy's relatives. But upon arriving at the home of her aunt and uncle, with other relatives and neighbors who are gathered watching, Nicky accidentally backs the trailer into their hosts' carport, partly destroying it as well as a prized rose bush. As Tacy and Nicky continue traveling, Tacy is determined to make their trailer home, collecting fruits and vegetables to can for winter, as well as rocks to decorate their front patio when they arrive at their ultimate destination in Colorado. Soon Tacy wants to learn how to drive the car, but after being constantly criticized by Nicky about her driving skills, Tacy gets out and jumps in the back, furious. After having another fight that evening over who was sleeping where for the night, they make up again.\n\nThe following afternoon, Tacy attempts to cook dinner while Nicky drives, hoping to have dinner ready once he parks the trailer at their next stop. It goes awry, as the trailer moves and rocks, causing the dinner to be ruined and Tacy getting severely bruised. Afterwards, Nicky decides to take an offer on the trailer, hoping he and Tacy can move into an actual house. But Tacy is still determined to keep the trailer, and refuses to sell it. That evening, Nicky orders Tacy to get rid of all the rocks and canned foods she has collected before they make a cliffhanging ride on a narrow road through the mountains. But Tacy feels they are throwing away precious memories of their honeymoon, and decides to keep them hidden, so Nicky wouldn't find them. But as Nicky and Tacy drive up and down the mountain, everything Tacy has hidden rolls around inside the trailer, causing a big mess. Finally, when they reach the top of the mountain, the trailer falls over again, weighed down by all of the possessions. In a rage, Nicky takes everything Tacy has collected and throws it off the mountain. Tacy later storms off in a huff.\n\nAs their marriage deteriorates, Nicky meets up with Tacy as she prepares to sell the trailer and move back home. Nicky attempts to apologize, but doesn't know where to start and instead leaves. As Nicky starts driving off in the pouring rain, Tacy runs to catch up with him. The two finally forgive each other, and tearfully reconcile.\n\nThe trailer used in the film is the 1953 36-foot Redman New Moon model, which sold for . The new car used to tow the trailer is a 1953 Mercury Monterey convertible with a 125 HP flathead V8 engine.\n\nOpening scenes were shot on Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's Stage 12, the same location at which Arnaz played his first film scene in \"Bataan\", eleven years before.\n\nThe dangerous mountain highway featured is Whitney Portal Road, which leads up to Mount Whitney in the Sierra Nevada mountains in California. The hairpin turn offers scenic views of the Owens Valley. During the scenes of Nicky and Tacy pulling their trailer in the mountains, their 1953 Mercury Monterey convertible is replaced with a larger but similar appearing 1953 Lincoln Capri convertible. The distinct Lincoln grille is clearly evident in a shot as the car rounds a curve. The more powerful Lincoln (which is equipped with a 205 HP V8 engine) was needed to pull the heavy New Moon trailer up and over the steep grades of the Sierra Nevada where the scenes were filmed. Other scenes were shot on the Pines to Palms Scenic Byway (State Route 74) in Palm Desert, California.\n\nThe residence of Tacy's aunt and uncle (where the porch and rosebush are destroyed by the trailer) is the \"Meet Me In St. Louis\" John Truett house on the MGM Backlot, next door to the Smith Family house.\n\nThe closing credits thank the National Park Service for permission to film in Yosemite National Park. There is one memorable scene where the car and trailer emerge from a tunnel to a view of Yosemite Valley, complete with a panorama of El Capitan, Half Dome, and Bridalveil Fall. Later, there is a view of a full-flowing Yosemite Falls.\n\nAccording to Turner Classic Movies' host, Robert Osborne, the studio was not sure if this film would be a success because it was thought people would not pay money to see Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz in a movie when they could watch the couple on television for free (\"I Love Lucy\"). Arnaz made a $25,000 bet with the studio that the movie would make more money than the current highest grossing comedy at that time (\"Father of the Bride\", starring Spencer Tracy and Elizabeth Taylor and also directed by Vincente Minnelli). Arnaz won the bet. The film gave audiences an opportunity to see Arnaz and Ball in color when \"I Love Lucy\" was in black and white. Tacy and Nicky are similar to the characters Lucy and Ricky.\n\nAccording to MGM records the film earned $3,978,000 in the US and Canada and $1,007,000 elsewhere, resulting in a profit of $1,517,000.\n\n\"The Long, Long Trailer\" was released on DVD in 2006 by Warner Home Video in Region 1 coding for the U.S. and Canada. It was released as a single disc and as a part of a 3-DVD set featuring two other Ball/Arnaz movies, \"Forever, Darling\" and \"Too Many Girls\". The film was also released in Region 4 coding for Australia.\n\nThe film is referenced in the They Might Be Giants song \"Everything Right Is Wrong Again\" which contains the lyrics \"Everything right is wrong again / Just like in The Long, Long Trailer / All the dishes got broken / The car kept driving / And nobody would stop to save her\".\n\n"}

{"id": "2268257", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2268257", "title": "Eric Heffer", "text": "Eric Heffer\n\nEric Samuel Heffer (12 January 1922 – 27 May 1991) was a British socialist politician. He was Labour Member of Parliament for Liverpool Walton from 1964 until his death. His working-class background and consciousness fostered his left-wing politics. With 12,000 books in his home, he also admitted to being a bibliophile. Due to his experience as a professional joiner, he made a speciality of the construction industry and its employment practices, but was also concerned with trade union issues in general. He changed his view on the European Common Market from being an outspoken supporter to an outspoken opponent, and served a brief period in government in the mid-1970s. His later career was dominated by his contribution to debates within the Labour Party and he defended the Liverpool City Council.\n\nHeffer was born in Hertford into a working-class family. His grandfather was a bricklayer and later a railway signalman, and his father was a boot-maker and repairer, although he owned his own business. In later life Heffer proudly declared \"I am therefore completely proletarian in background\". Heffer's family were members of the High church tendency of the Church of England, and Heffer himself was a choirboy in the local church: it was there that Heffer led his first strike at the age of 8, and, he said, first experienced victimisation by his employer. Despite growing up in the 1930s, his family did not experience much of the economic privations common in other parts of the country. Typically for a working-class boy he attended school at Longmore Senior School, Hertford, only until the age of 14.\n\nOn leaving school Heffer ran through a series of skilled apprenticeships, including as an electrician, leatherworker and finally a carpenter. He learnt the trade of a joiner, and worked on building sites from the age of 16. This was a skilled trade and when building work was much in demand, he could earn a good wage; but when there were difficulties in the trade, work would dry up. However, his work allowed him time to study and read in his spare time, and Heffer attended courses run by the Workers' Educational Association and at the National Council of Labour Colleges. Heffer was active in the Amalgamated Society of Woodworkers (ASW). During World War II, he served in the Royal Air Force in a maintenance unit at Fazakerley near Liverpool.\n\nWhen the Jarrow March passed through Hertford in 1936 Heffer had gone to see them and the experience had a profound effect upon him. The family often discussed politics at home and he saw his political convictions, support for trade unionism and his religious convictions as part of the same analysis of the world. In 1939 Heffer joined the Labour Party. However, when the Soviet Union was invaded by Nazi forces in 1941, Heffer resigned from Labour and joined the Communist Party of Great Britain; he said that \"To me, Stalin was the greatest of men\". In the Liverpool Communist Party, Heffer met his future wife Doris. While Communism was attractive to Heffer as an expression of working-class consciousness, he was not attracted to the party's intense control over its members, and was not inclined to defer to the party's dictates. He was a shop steward for his union; when in 1948 he led an unofficial carpenters' strike against the party's wishes, the Communist Party expelled him and he rejoined the Labour Party within six months. The Communist Party tried to persuade Doris Heffer to choose between her husband or the party. She refused and allowed her membership to expire.\n\nAfter the war Heffer briefly lived in Hertford again with his parents, and fought as a Communist candidate for Hertford Urban District Council in 1946, but was defeated. He then settled in Liverpool, where there was a strong working-class community and within it a large group of left-wing workers waiting to be organised. Although from the east of England, Heffer grew to love his adopted city and supported Everton F.C.. He responded to the demand for a left-wing political organisation in 1954 by linking with a group led by Harry McShane (from Glasgow) and the Militant Socialist Group from London to establish the 'Federation of Marxist Groups' (later renamed the 'Socialist Workers Federation') which had a policy of syndicalism. This group was a compromise: while it insisted that it itself was not a revolutionary political party, it simultaneously said that there was a need for such a party, and actively rejected the Labour Party. However, Heffer had decided by 1956 to rejoin the Labour Party.\n\nHis activities led to Heffer becoming known through Liverpool where he served on the Executive of the Trades Council; he was its Vice President in 1958, President in 1959 and again in 1964. The Trades Council was a local association of trade unions, and as such Heffer helped mediate and end an unofficial strike of seamen in 1960. He was also elected as a Liverpool City Councillor for Pirrie ward that year. In 1962 he made a run for the job of General Secretary of the Amalgamated Society of Woodworkers, but was defeated. Heffer made a contribution to a book, \"The Agreeable Autocracies\", which was published in 1961. The book was a discussion of United States institutions.\n\nIn 1963 Heffer was unexpectedly selected to fight the Liverpool Walton constituency for the Labour Party. The previously Conservative-held constituency went to Heffer on a large swing in the 1964 general election, as did a number of other Liverpool seats. There was never any doubt that Heffer would ally with the left in the Parliamentary Labour Party, and he campaigned in 1965 for early moves to nationalise the docks, where he knew from his experience on Liverpool Trades Council that dockers were employed on highly disadvantageous terms that effectively prevented trade unions forming. Also in 1965 Heffer protested outside the United States embassy against the use of napalm and gas in the Vietnam war, and in Parliament against the diplomatic support given by the government. By 1970 he was rated as one of the most effective of the large 1964 intake of Labour MPs: in David Butler's \"The British General Election of 1970\" (page 4), he was identified as a leading figure in the Tribune Group, which had been established in 1964.\n\nDoris Heffer served jointly as her husband's secretary, and secretary to fellow Labour MP Norman Buchan. She often accompanied him to speaking engagements where they made an odd couple: Heffer was both tall and heavily built, while his wife was only 4'6\" tall. Heffer made a good-humoured complaint when political journalist Andrew Roth described Doris as \"tiny\", insisting that she was actually \"petite\". According to the diaries of Giles Radice, Doris Heffer would sit in the front row of the audience when Heffer was speaking, saying, \"Nonsense, Eric\" if he said something with which she disagreed. The Heffers had no children.\n\nAfter winning re-election with a 5,000 majority in the 1966 general election, Heffer began to make his mark on economic policy. With deflation proposed in the July 1966 economic crisis, he pressed for cuts in defence spending, and opposed the 'wage freeze' proposed in the government's Prices and Incomes Bill—rebelling against it in the House of Commons on several occasions in 1967. Heffer regarded unemployment as the worst catastrophe in running the economy and often demanded nationalisation of firms which threatened mass redundancies. Government policy was significantly different, placing more emphasis on maintaining the value of the pound. In August 1967, Wilson, who recognised his abilities, asked Heffer to take a junior post at the Ministry of Technology under Tony Benn. Heffer refused, citing his opposition to government economic policy, and demanded the resignation of James Callaghan as Chancellor of the Exchequer.\n\nAt this time, Heffer was a strong proponent of British membership of the EEC. He headed a study group established by the Society for Parliamentary Studies (a group for left-wing Labour MPs) to look into British relations with Europe, and demanded the resignation of Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food Fred Peart when Peart expressed doubts about the merits of the Common Agriculture Policy. At the 1967 Labour Party conference, Heffer argued for Britain in Europe to build up a third force in the world which would stand up to the US and the Soviet Union. He also began a campaign to win a place on the National Executive Committee at this conference, standing again each year and steadily building his support. Another preoccupation which began at this time was the Waterloo Cup, a hare coursing event at Great Altcar near his constituency: he promoted an unsuccessful Private Member's Bill to ban hare coursing, returning to the subject at intervals over the next decade.\n\nIn February 1968 Heffer was one of the Labour MPs to rebel against the government's decision to withdraw British passports from the Kenyan Asians who were arriving at Heathrow Airport in increasing numbers, fleeing persecution in Kenya. He maintained pressure on the government over the Vietnam war and criticised the Greek military dictatorship of 'the Colonels' for \"bestial and barbarous practices\". On two of the issues which divided the Labour Party at the time, Heffer took the side of the rebels: he rejected the proposals for reform of the House of Lords as too weak, preferring fundamental reform or preferably abolition, and he worked to change proposals in Barbara Castle's trade union White paper \"In Place of Strife\" (a cabinet rebellion later forced the government to abandon it completely).\n\nAs a strong opponent of the government's economic policy, Heffer was invited to submit an article to a \"Guardian\" book endorsing the re-election of a Labour government in the 1970 general election as a counter to an article by a Labour loyalist. Perhaps as a consequence of his identification with the left, Heffer had only a small swing against him in the election. After a narrow defeat in the elections for the Shadow Cabinet, he accepted a front bench job as deputy to Barbara Castle as Shadow Minister of Employment. As such he was closely involved in the protests over the Heath government's Industrial Relations Act, which attempted to restrict the powers of trade unions.\n\nHeffer's vote in Shadow Cabinet elections rose in 1971 when he tied with Castle in 15th place. While Heffer could work with Barbara Castle, she was moved in a reshuffle in 1972 and replaced by Reg Prentice who was already beginning the move across the political spectrum which would see him join the Conservative Party in 1977. Prentice's refusal to pledge support to five dockers imprisoned under the Industrial Relations Act appalled Heffer who considered resignation. When in February 1973 it became clear that Prentice had more leadership support, Heffer resigned (refusing an offer of another post). He remained interested in the topic and promoted a Private Member's Bill to abolish the 'Lump' (sub-contracting of labour in the building industry).\n\nHeffer had revised his opinions on the EEC in 1970, deciding that the spending on the Common Agriculture Policy was excessive and too big a burden on the budget. He voted with the majority of the Labour Party against endorsing the Heath government's application in October 1971.\n\nIn March 1974, Harold Wilson invited Heffer to be Minister of State at the Department of Industry under Tony Benn. Heffer accepted the offer, while remaining concerned that he would be cocooned in his office and lose his links with the wider Labour movement outside. He had some difficulties coping with the concept of 'collective responsibility' - denouncing the government's decision to continue a contract to build warships with the right-wing government of Chile on 10 April. Wilson, reluctant to cause trouble with the left-wing, decided not to sack him on the grounds that he was inexperienced. Heffer received many minutes from Wilson asking him to follow government policy in speeches, such that he minuted Wilson to tell him not to send them.\n\nHeffer worked together with Benn to try to establish the National Enterprise Board, which would provide industry with investment funding and have the ability to take failing firms into public ownership. On 15 August 1974 the plans were unveiled in a White paper and preparations began for the Industry Bill which would enact it. While this policy had been agreed by Wilson in opposition and then appeared in the Labour manifesto, in government he began to think more critically. Drafting of the Bill was delayed over the winter and it was not introduced until January 1975.\n\nIn the meantime, the government prepared for the referendum on the European Communities through which Wilson hoped to settle the differences over the issue in the country and the party. The Cabinet decided on 18 March to endorse a vote to stay in the EEC, but Wilson decided to allow individual Ministers to make speeches against membership in the country. Ministers were not, however, allowed to speak against the decision in the House of Commons. Heffer was angry at this rule and wanted to resign. Eventually, he engineered a dismissal on a question of principle by making a speech against EEC membership in the House of Commons on 9 April. During the referendum, Heffer was one of the best speakers for the No campaign, although he had a tendency to speculate about the issue - claiming that the EEC would reintroduce conscription.\n\nAfter the referendum, Tony Benn was demoted from the Department for Industry and the Industry Bill was again made weaker. As a backbencher Heffer campaigned against the change and for more investment in industry. At the 1975 Labour conference his bid for a National Executive Committee (NEC) seat was finally successful as he defeated Denis Healey. Heffer again became known as one of the leading left-wing Labour backbenchers who frequently voted against the government. He opposed the government's incomes policy (which had been agreed as a voluntary arrangement with the Trades Union Congress), and abstained rather than support the government's white paper on public expenditure in March 1976 which helped ensure the government's defeat.\n\nDespite Heffer's friendship with Tony Benn, he voted for Michael Foot in the Labour leadership election of 1976. However he did support Benn's 'Alternative Economic Strategy' which called for government assistance to industry, import restrictions, surcharges on high net income and capital and controls on banks.\n\nHeffer was opposed to the government's proposals for devolution to Scotland and Wales. He abstained in the vote on a guillotine motion on the Scotland and Wales Bill on 22 February 1977, which resulted in the defeat of the guillotine, the loss of the Bill and endangered the government. A pact was negotiated between the Labour Party and the Liberals to ensure a majority. Heffer was upset about the pact and started a motion to call a special meeting of the National Executive Committee (the Prime Minister, James Callaghan, forbade Ministers to sign it).\n\nIncreasingly Heffer began to use his position on the Labour Party NEC as the base of his political action. He began a specific campaign to nationalise the building construction industry in the National Construction Corporation, and raised the issue at the 1977 Labour Party conference and on the TUC-Labour Party Liaison Committee, where Callaghan vetoed any consideration of the idea by government. In intra-party matters, Heffer opposed taking action against the Militant tendency after a report by the party's national agent Reg Underhill raised concerns over its activities. Heffer's constituency of Walton was one of the strongest areas of Militant but Heffer believed that Trotskyists within the Labour Party could be countered by political arguments. He recommended that local parties hold political education events to explain democratic socialism to the Militant-dominated Labour Party Young Socialists.\n\nIn the late 1970s Heffer fought to change government policy to try to reduce unemployment, and he opposed the continuation of a pay policy which caused the strikes of the Winter of Discontent. He was one of the left-wing members of an \"ad hoc\" sub-committee of the NEC which undertook the task of cutting an overlong manifesto for the 1979 general election down to a manageable size. Heffer was one of those who wanted abolition of the House of Lords in the manifesto, a policy vetoed by James Callaghan.\n\nAfter Labour lost the election, Heffer ran for the Shadow Cabinet again and finished as the runner-up. He joined the campaign of the left to change the democratic structure of the Labour Party to give more power to those bodies such as party conference where the left was strong. He was an important link between the National Executive and the Parliamentary Labour Party. Heffer did endorse the policy of forcing Labour Members of Parliament to seek reselection from their constituency parties, although he wanted the vote to involve all members rather than the 'General Management Committee' which comprised only activists.\n\nThe most important issue for the left in the early 1980s was to change the system of election of the Leader of the Labour Party, which had until then been chosen solely by Labour MPs. The left wanted to have the Leader elected by an 'electoral college' which would include affiliated trade unions and individual Constituency Labour Parties. At the 1980 Labour Party conference a procedural motion to allow the change to be made without delay was narrowly carried after Heffer argued for it, but all proposals for balancing the composition of the electoral college were defeated and the issue was deferred until a special conference.\n\nWith an electoral college Leadership system in prospect, James Callaghan resigned as Leader in October 1980 to make sure that his successor was elected under the old system. Heffer regarded such an election as illegitimate and moved to suspend it until the new system was agreed, but the Parliamentary Labour Party rejected it. He considered standing as a candidate himself but eventually deferred to Michael Foot who was eventually elected (against expectations). Due to a resignation, Heffer was briefly promoted to be a member of the Shadow Cabinet in October–November 1980. Foot made Heffer spokesman on Europe and Community Affairs from November.\n\nConcern about the Militant tendency led Reg Underhill, whose 1975 report had been dismissed by Heffer, to issue a revised version in 1980. This report made it clear that most party institutions in Liverpool, especially in Heffer's constituency, were now under Militant control. Heffer compared the report to the propaganda of Joseph Goebbels, but he knew that Militant was powerful: when Heffer considered running against Denis Healey for the Deputy Leadership of the Labour Party under the new electoral college system in 1981, his constituency party prevented him. He supported Benn when Benn challenged Healey.\n\nHeffer was elected to the Shadow Cabinet in 1981. While he was a strong supporter of the left, Heffer accepted the need to preserve party unity. In December 1981 he attempted to solve the problem of Michael Foot's denunciation of Peter Tatchell (who had been selected as Labour candidate for Bermondsey) by holding a quick enquiry, but this attempt failed when Foot loyalists passed a motion to refuse Tatchell endorsement. Heffer's attempts to mediate between the Bermondsey Party and Foot were regarded as 'paternalist' by Tatchell and his local supporters. Heffer also joined with Foot and Denis Healey in an NEC motion calling for negotiations with the United Nations Secretary-General after the Argentine invasion of the Falkland Islands on 28 April 1982, in opposition to a motion from Tony Benn calling for a ceasefire and withdrawal of the British taskforce.\n\nIn June 1982 the NEC discussed Militant again, with Heffer proposing that all members of the Labour Party subscribe to a 'statement of democratic socialist principles' which was defeated by 22 votes to 5. At the 1982 Labour Party conference the right-wing won back control of the NEC, and at its first meeting the left-wing were voted out of all their chairmanships in a coup organised by John Golding. This included Heffer, who had been chairman of the powerful 'Organisation Sub-Committee' (usually known as Org Sub). The change allowed the right to begin to take action against Militant, membership of which was declared incompatible with party membership. The five members of Militant's editorial board were expelled in February 1983 despite Heffer's motion to have a further investigation.\n\nThe 1983 election was a disaster for Labour which lost a substantial number of votes. Michael Foot resigned the leadership immediately afterwards, and with Tony Benn ineligible because of his own defeat, Heffer stood for the leadership as the candidate of the 'hard left' in the election. He received minimal support among the trade unions and constituency parties, and came third among Labour MPs, obtaining in all 6.3% of the electoral college. Neil Kinnock appointed him as Shadow Minister for the Construction Industry, noting his long experience in the area. Heffer was also Chairman of the Labour Party from the end of the 1983 conference, a position which conveyed no authority but recognised his seniority.\n\nHowever, with a Militant-dominated Labour council in Liverpool having been elected in 1983, Heffer found increasing trouble in his constituency. The Liverpool Labour Party adopted Militant's policy of a 'deficit budget'. This included no cuts to jobs and services, and no rent and rates increases higher than inflation, and a promise to increase services and confront central government with the £270 million stolen, it claimed, in grants from the city since the Conservatives came to power in 1979. It was voted into office by a landslide. The administration produced a financial crisis, since the budget, set in April by the outgoing Tory-Liberal coalition, included unallocated cuts of £6 million, including 1000 job losses, which the administration cancelled, and an extra 1000 jobs had been promised instead. When the council met on 29 March 1984 it was told clearly that the Militant proposed 'deficit budget' contained an illegal £30 million deficit, but no alternative could get a majority and it went through. All but seven Labour councillors stood by the budget, and Heffer supported the council in its demands of government and after a series of meetings with the Secretary of State for the Environment Patrick Jenkin, the government eventually gave way and allowed practically all of the budget.\n\nIn November 1984 Heffer did not win re-election to the Shadow Cabinet and left the Labour front bench. He said that he took a principled stance not to take any front bench post unless elected to it.\n\nLiverpool's financial confrontation continued in 1985 when it eventually set another 'deficit budget'. This time the government would not help, and Militant's attempt to get the council's workforce to strike against the Thatcher government was narrowly defeated in a ballot. By September the council was almost out of cash and applied to the new Environment Secretary (Kenneth Baker) for a loan of £25 million. In a desperate attempt to avoid bankruptcy, on 27 September the council issued 90-day redundancy notices to its entire workforce, using a fleet of taxis to deliver them.\n\nOn 1 October Neil Kinnock spoke at the Labour Party conference and denounced (without identifying Liverpool) the actions of the council. Heffer was appalled at Kinnock's actions and walked off the platform in protest. This action was capable of misinterpretation: Heffer was fully supportive of the council's actions, but not a Militant member, and felt that Kinnock was insulting the whole City, and also that he as the senior Liverpool MP ought to have been told in advance. Heffer's autobiography has been taken by most reviewers to illustrate his \"known dislike\" for Kinnock. One sixth of the book is devoted to expressing his views that Kinnock's \"betrayal of socialism\" led to \"a rigid party discipline and the expulsion of Militant supporters\".\n\nHeffer's views are most clearly expressed in a letter he sent to Labour Party general secretary Larry Whitty at the time of the 1986 inquiry into the Liverpool District Labour Party:\nOn 27 March 1986 the leading members of the Liverpool Labour Party were brought before the National Executive where their expulsion was being proposed. Heffer had accompanied Derek Hatton during his NEC hearing regarding the Liverpool District Labour Party. He joined a walk-out by members of the left which rendered the meeting inquorate. At later meetings he voted against expelling Militant members. His refusal to support those taking action against Militant led to Heffer losing his position on the Labour Party National Executive at the 1986 conference, a loss which Heffer took personally, and indicated the changed nature of the Labour Party, which Heffer anticipated in his letter to Whitty in 1986. The 47 Labour councillors who stood behind the deficit budget strategy were removed from office in 1987 and surcharged £106,000, with costs of £242,000, which they raised through donations from the trade unions and Labour Party members.\n\nHeffer's constituency had become increasingly safe for him over the years and at the 1987 election he had the largest absolute Labour vote in the country and a rock-solid 23,000 majority. Neil Kinnock's decision to review the policy of the Labour Party after the election, which was a clear prelude to dropping some of the more left-wing policies, led him to urge the left in the Socialist Campaign Group to fight the Leadership and Deputy Leadership in 1988. Tony Benn was chosen to challenge Kinnock as Leader, while Heffer and John Prescott opposed Roy Hattersley for the Deputy Leadership. Neither had any realistic hope of winning, and Heffer eventually won only 9.483% of the vote.\n\nOn 24 November 1989 Heffer announced that he would not fight the next election. The decision was prompted by the fact that he had been diagnosed with terminal stomach cancer. He suffered a long decline during which he devoted himself to writing. When Parliament was recalled to debate the invasion of Kuwait in September 1990, Heffer made what he knew would be his last speech in the House of Commons to urge the United Kingdom not to go to war. His gaunt and white appearance showed how ill he was. In January 1991 he attended the House of Commons to vote against the Gulf War in a wheelchair, when John Major crossed the floor to shake his hand. In March 1991 he was awarded the freedom of the city of Liverpool, but as he was too ill to travel there, he received it at Westminster. On Heffer's deathbed he said to Kinnock, \"You should be dying, not me\" – reflecting bitterness of what he saw as Kinnock's betrayal of the Labour movement with the expulsion of members of Militant.\n\nTwo months later, Heffer died at the age 69. Although he politically clashed with Margaret Thatcher, they respected each other personally, and she wrote a letter of condolence to Heffer's widow when he died. She also attended his memorial service held on 10 July 1991. Other notable names who attended included Neil Hamilton, Jonathan Aitken, Geoffrey Howe, James Molyneaux, Ian Paisley, Alan Beith, John Biffen, Patrick Mayhew, John Smith and Tony Benn.\n\nIn 2019, Liverpool Walton Constituency Labour Party launched the annual Eric Heffer Memorial Lecture to pay tribute to Heffer's legacy and explore how his ideas of internationalist, democratic socialism can be applied today. The first lecture, delivered by Heffer's successor as Liverpool Walton MP, Dan Carden, was published in Tribune magazine.\n\nLike many politicians, Heffer was a target for satirists who would highlight his left-wing attitude. He was especially targeted in the satirical strip \"Battle for Britain\" which ran in the magazine \"Private Eye\" between 1983 and 1987 — Margaret Thatcher's second term in office as Prime Minister. Heffer appears in the majority of the strips, his \"cruel Cockney humour\" being described as lowering morale on his side, especially when directed at Neil Kinnock.\n\nHeffer was a bibliophile whose collection of 12,000 books was much more than his small house would normally accommodate. He also wrote prodigiously. His publications include:\n\n\n"}

It is owned and operated by the Filipino media conglomerate ABS-CBN. Its programming is composed primarily of imported programs from the ABS-CBN television network.\n\nTFC is available globally on direct-to-home satellite, cable, IPTV, online streaming, video on demand and on other over-the-top content platforms. TFC is targeted to the Filipino diaspora, and was launched on September 24, 1994, becoming the world's first trans-Pacific Asian broadcaster.\n\nAs of 2016, The Filipino Channel has over three million subscribers worldwide in over 40 countries across 4 continents, most of whom are in the United States, Middle East, Europe, Australia, Canada, and Japan.\n\nWhile TFC traces its origins to 1994, the idea of broadcasting television programming via satellite to the millions of the Filipino diaspora everywhere in the world was an innovative idea that the then ABS-CBN Broadcasting Corporation (now ABS-CBN Corporation) took in the late 1980s, just as it began its road of reconstuction after the brutal and infamous years of Martial Law and the post-Martial Law era. As the network in 1989 began to become once more the Philippines' leading television network, the network finally made the bold step to begin satellite transmissions to Filipinos abroad when in the fall of that very year, ABS-CBN programs were broadcast via satellite to the Northern Mariana Islands, especially to the Filipino families living in Guam and Saipan, making it the first ever Philippine television network to broadcast to viewers outside the country via satellite.\n\nOn September 24, 1994, ABS-CBN, through its newly established subsidiary ABS-CBN International, signed a historic deal with the PanAmSat to bring the first trans-Pacific Asian programming service to some two million Filipino immigrants in the United States using the then-newly launched PAS 2 satellite.

Vaulting has a history as an equestrian act at circuses, but its origins stretch back at least two-thousand years. It is open to both men and women and is one of ten equestrian disciplines recognized by the International Federation for Equestrian Sports (Fédération Équestre Internationale or FEI). Therapeutic or interactive vaulting is also used as an activity for children and adults who may have balance, attention, gross motor skill or social deficits.\n\nVaulting's enthusiasts are concentrated in Europe and other parts of the Western world. It is well established in Germany and Switzerland and is growing in other western countries. Vaulting was first introduced in the United States in the 1950s and 60s but was limited only to California and other areas of the west coast. More recently, it is beginning to gain popularity in the United States northeast.\n\nIt is believed by some that the origins of vaulting could be traced to the ancient Roman games, where acrobats usually displayed their skills on cantering horses. Others, however, believe that vaulting originated in ancient Crete, where bull-leaping was prevalent. In either case, people have been performing acrobatic and dance-like movements on (or over) the backs of moving horses/animals for more than 2,000 years.\n\nRenaissance and Middle Ages history include numerous references to vaulting or similar activities. The present name of the sport/art comes from the French \"la voltige,\" which it acquired during the Renaissance, when it was a form of riding drill and agility exercise for cavalry riders.\n\nModern vaulting developed in post-war Germany as an initiative to introduce children to equestrian sports.\n\nIn 1983, vaulting became one of the disciplines recognized by the FEI. European championships were first held in Ebreichsdorf, Austria in 1984, and the first FEI World Vaulting Championship was held in Bulle, Switzerland in 1986. Vaulting was included in the World Equestrian Games in Stockholm in 1990 and in all subsequent editions of the games. It was demonstrated as an art during the 1984 and 1996 Olympic Games events. It has been included in the Inter-Africa Cup since 2006.\n\nThe first World Cup Vaulting competition was held in Leipzig on 29–30 April 2011.\n\nIn competitive vaulting, vaulters compete as individuals, pairs (pas-de-deux) and teams. Beginning vaulters compete in walk while experienced vaulters compete in canter. The vaulting horse moves in a minimum 15-metre diameter circle and is directed by a lunger (or \"longeur\") who stands in the center. In competitive vaulting, the rider and horse will both be judged on a scale from 1 to 10.\n\nVaulting competitions consist of compulsory exercises and choreographed freestyle exercises done to music. There are seven compulsory exercises: mount, basic seat, flag, mill, scissors, stand and flank. Each exercise is scored on a scale from 0 to 10. Horses also receive a score and are judged on the quality of their movement as well as their behavior.\n\nVaulters compete in team, pas-de-deux and individual categories. An individual freestyle (also known as Kür) is a 1-minute program, the pas-de-deux kür is 2 minutes while the team is 4 minutes. They are all choreographed to music. The components of a freestyle vaulting routine \"may\" include mounts and dismounts, handstands, kneeling and standing and aerial moves such jumps, leaps and tumbling skills. However, many of these skills are only seen in the highest levels. A typical routine for a child or beginner will more likely contain variations on simple kneels and planks. Teams also carry, lift, or even toss another vaulter in the air. Judging is based on technique, performance, form, difficulty, balance, security, and consideration of the horse; the horse is also scored, taking up 25% of the total score.\n\nVaulting horses are not saddled but wear a surcingle (or a roller) and a thick back pad. The surcingle has special handles which aid the vaulter in performing certain moves as well as leather loops called \"cossack stirrups\". The horse wears a bridle and side reins. The lunge line is usually attached to the inside bit ring.\n\nVaulting horses typically move on the left rein (counterclockwise), but in some competitions the horse canters in the other direction. Two-phase classes of competition also work the horse to the right. While many European clubs do not compete to the right, they still work at home evenly both directions, believing this benefits the horse and the vaulter.\n\nThe premier vaulting competitions are the biannual World and Continental Championships and the World Equestrian Games (WEG) held every four years. In many countries, vaulting associations organize and sponsor national, regional and local events every year. In 2011 there were at least 24 countries with such organisations.\n\nVaulters perform movements on the back of the horse. Novice and beginning vaulters may perform at the walk or the trot while higher level vaulters perform at the canter. There are compulsory exercises and depending on class the vaulter performs seven or eight of them:\n\nThe compulsories are performed in succession in the above order, without pause or dismounts.\n\nThe International Federation for Equestrian Sports (FEI) regulates dress codes for competitive vaulting. Every 2–3 years, new guidelines are released, which consistently declare that vaulters must wear form-fitting uniforms that do not conceal the line and form of the vaulter's body, as well as not hinder the movement of the vaulter or the safe interaction between the vaulters. For that reason, accessories such as belts, capes or hats are prohibited. Additionally, men’s trousers must be secured at the ankle. It is expected that clothing be appropriate for the competition and does not give the effect of nudity. The most common form-fitting uniforms worn by vaulters are unitards.\n\nIn addition to competition, vaulting is a form of artistry, recreation and entertainment. Vaulters range in age from 7 to 30 years and older, practicing individual and team skills and routines. The youngest athletes begin at the walk gait and progress to trot, and canter, based on strength, height, and ability to mount and performing on the horse.\n\nVaulting is used on a therapeutic level in some instances. People with disabilities can often benefit from interacting with the horse and team members, and by doing simple movements with the help of \"spotters.\"\n\nVaulting is often seen on a recreational level, through vaulting \"demonstrations,\" and occasionally in local parades.\n\n\n\n"}

Despite its name, it is not a direct sequel to \"Dracula 2000\".\n\nIn the year 3000, the space salvage ship \"Mother III\" happens upon the derelict transport \"Demeter\". Captain Van Helsing (Casper Van Dien) and his crew board the abandoned ship.\n\nThey explore the bridge and find the corpse of the \"Demeter's\" captain, (Udo Kier) tied to a chair and clutching a crucifix. Despite the misgivings of crew, particularly intern Mina Murry (Alexandra Kamp) and vice-captain Aurora (Erika Eleniak), the Captain claims salvage rights and decides to tow the ship back to Earth. As the crew prepares to return, \"Mother III\" suddenly uncouples from the \"Demeter\", leaving them stranded with no means of communication.\n\nLater, cargo specialist 187 (Coolio) and deckhand Humvee (Tiny Lister) discover a cargo bay full of coffins. 187 speculates that the coffins could contain smuggled goods and opens one, only to find sand. Humvee heads back to the bridge while 187 stays to open the other coffins; he is soon mysteriously attacked. The crew rushes to 187's aid, only to find he is now a vampire. Under orders from his \"master\", 187 vows to kill the entire crew.\n\nAurora, fleeing 187, runs into the \"master\" (Langley Kirkwood), a vampire named Count Orlock. Aurora makes her way to a recreation room where she reports her encounter with Orlock and reveals his intentions to return to Earth. Upon questioning, she is unable to explain how she escaped Orlock unharmed.\n\nThinking Aurora could be lying, the Captain ties her up and Humvee guards her. Soon, 187 gains entrance and attacks Humvee, who manages to stake him in the heart with a pool cue. Aurora, still tied up, confesses that she is an undercover android cop investigating salvage activities. The Captain and Humvee feel betrayed, but untie her.\n\nSearching the ship's database, the Captain and the Professor (Grant Swanby), who uses a wheelchair, discover that the legendary vampire hunter Abraham Van Helsing was one of the Captain's ancestors. The Professor believes Orlock will seek revenge against the Captain. The Captain learns how vampires can be stopped and decides to steer the \"Demeter\" on a course towards a binary star system.\n\nThe Captain and Aurora are soon confronted by Orlock. Aurora leaves to rally reinforcements, leaving the Captain to fight Orlock alone. Orlock eventually gains the upper hand and turns the Captain into a vampire. Aurora and Humvee return, only to be attacked by the Captain. Aurora stakes him with another cue stick, but Mina (now a vampire herself) attacks, allowing Orlock to escape. Mina is dispatched by Humvee.\n\nThe Professor, despairing of his chances of survival, finds Orlock, who promises to free him from his disability in return for aiding Orlock's return to Earth. When Aurora and Humvee return to the bridge, they find the Professor passed out. Aurora stabs him with a cross, revealing that he was a vampire. A furious Orlock tries to enter the bridge, but Humvee and Aurora close the door on him, cutting off his arm in the process.\n\nAs the \"Demeter\" draws closer towards one of the binary stars, Humvee and Aurora confess to each other that neither knows how to pilot the ship. Knowing they are about to die, they take comfort in the fact that Orlock's plan to return to Earth has been foiled. Aurora reveals that she is programmed for sexual pleasure, and it is implied the two spend their final moments having sex.\n\nThe movie ends with a video segment from the \"Demeter's\" Captain Varna, who announces his intention to sacrifice himself and his ship. The \"Demeter\" explodes in space, killing Humvee and Aurora, and destroying Orlock.\n\n\nCritical reaction to \"Dracula 3000\" has been negative. Andrew Stine of \"Something Awful\" said, \"Whether it's out of some facsimile of genuine interest (rare) or because I just want to see how completely stupid things can possibly get within ninety minutes, I have so far been able to keep myself from lapsing into a waking coma by latching upon some facet of the movie which is not utterly, interminably boring.

It is primarily used for baseball and is the home field of the Burlington Bees minor league baseball team. Occasionally, the stadium is used by the local high school baseball team. The current stadium holds 3,200 people. Community Field was most recently named the 2013 \"Field of the Year\" in the state of Iowa by the Iowa Sports Turf Management Association.\n\nCommunity Field was built in 1947 upon the establishment of the Burlington Indians, minor league baseball affiliate of the Cleveland Indians. During that time, Community Field housed the affiliates of five different minor league baseball clubs and was fortunate enough to see the likes of Billy Williams (left fielder) and Vida Blue perform before tragedy struck. On June 9, 1971, the grandstand seating burned down to the ground. However, during the rebuild, no games were missed as there were temporary bleacher seats erected in place of the grandstand. By the start of the 1973 season, the grandstand was finished by an all-volunteer crew, displaying impressive community support.\n\nIn 1999, a series of projects were started to improve Community Field and make it more fan-friendly. Such projects included:\n\nThe stadium was once again renovated for the 2005 season, but this renovation was a much more extensive project than the renovations in 1999, including:\n\nA final upgrade in 2006 included a partially paved parking lot, a new marquee sign on the edge of Mt. Pleasant St. and a placed in the center of the parking lot, which holds a ; the flag only flies when the Bees are playing at home. The \"extreme makeover\" of Community Field cost approximately $3 million and was funded by the Vision Iowa program, the City of Burlington, Des Moines County, corporate and private pledges and in-kind donations from contractors.\n\nIn October 2012, more improvements were made, when the Burlington Bees groundskeeping crew re-sodded the entire playing surface with assistance from the Iowa Cubs Sports Turf Management staff. A few months later, in late March 2013, Community Field installed new field lights, 2 of them being infield lights that were moved back, thus creating space for possible future expansion of the grandstands.\n\nCommunity Field and the Burlington Bees rely heavily on community support from Burlington and the surrounding area communities. All of their renovations have been backed and supported by the community not only financially, but emotionally, as well.\n\nBecause the Burlington Bees operate in the smallest market in all of full-season, affiliated, professional baseball, cash flow can be a challenge—especially when it comes to making capital improvements on Community Field. While city government contributes as much as it is able, most capital improvement projects are completed with the help of volunteer labor and money raised from fundraising projects through the Friends of Community Field.\n\nThe Friends of Community Field is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization established in 1998 to help the Bees raise money for capital improvement projects involving Community Field. The Friends is run by a volunteer Board of Directors that helps to organize various fundraisers and the volunteer work force that helps maintain the stadium. Since 1998, money that has been raised has helped with new stadium lights, new playground flooring and canopy, new bleachers, box seats, the sound system, brat garden improvements and most recently, the fund raising for the \"Extreme Makeover\" of Community Field that was completed in 2005. In addition to the funds raised to finish the last renovation, the Friends of Community Field aims to raise money to start an endowment for future work to be done at the ballpark, without having to start another major fundraising initiative. All contributions to the Friends of Community Field are tax deductible.\n\n"}

Created by Sam Raimi, he is portrayed by Bruce Campbell and is the only character to appear in each entry of the series, including a post-credits cameo in the soft reboot film. Throughout the series, Ash faces off against \"Deadites\", evil creatures possessed by the ancient evil of the Kandarian Demon. In 2008, Ash was selected by \"Empire\" magazine as the 24th greatest movie character of all time, and in 2013, was voted by \"Empire\" as the greatest horror movie character ever.\n\nAsh and his girlfriend Linda, sister Cheryl, and friends Scott and Shelly stay at a log cabin in the woods, where they find the \"\"Naturom Demonto\"\" (renamed or possibly translated to \"Necronomicon Ex-Mortis\" in the sequels), a Sumerian \"Book of the Dead\", along with a tape recorder. The tape is a recording made by the cabin's owner Professor Knowby, who was translating a passage of the book. By playing the tape, the group unknowingly awaken the Kandarian Demon (the titular \"Evil Dead\") which can possess the living. They are possessed and killed one by one, until only Ash remains. He finally destroys the Book of the Dead by throwing it in the fireplace, and in doing so causes the possessed bodies of Scott and Cheryl to rapidly decay and \"die\". The film ends with Ash being suddenly attacked by the evil force (originally intended to portray his death).\n\nIn an alternate recap of the previous film, only Ash and Linda are shown on the trip to the cabin. Picking up from the ending of the first film, Ash is carried off by the demonic force and briefly possessed, released from the spirit by the light of dawn and falling unconscious. Attempting to leave, Ash finds the only bridge out completely destroyed and is forced to spend another night in the cabin. As the evil force toys with Ash's mind, his right hand becomes possessed and he cuts it off at the wrist with his chainsaw.\n\nLater, the cabin owner's daughter, Annie Knowby, and three others arrive to discover what became of Professor Knowby. Despite banding together in an attempt to survive, the others are killed off leaving only Ash and Annie. To better fight the deadites, Ash affixes the chainsaw in place of his right hand and wields a \"boomstick\" to match. Annie reads passages from the \"Necronomicon\", first to force the Kandarian Demon to manifest physically, and then opening a space-time vortex to banish the now-corporeal demonic spirit. However, Annie is stabbed by Ash's possessed disembodied hand; succumbing to her wound, she is unable to close the vortex after the entity is sucked away. Ash is sucked into the vortex after the entity and sent back in time to 1300 AD Europe. After saving a group of knights from an attacking deadite, he is hailed as the hero \"who has come from the sky\"; Ash can only scream in anguish at his situation.\n\nAfter being accidentally transported to medieval Europe, Ash must retrieve the \"Necronomicon\" so he can return home. Using his knowledge of modern technology, Ash constructs a mechanical prosthetic hand out of a gauntlet from a suit of armor. Bungling the magic words that will allow him to safely retrieve it, Ash unleashes an army of the dead led by his monstrous doppelganger \"Bad Ash\". After leading the medieval soldiers to victory, Ash is given a potion that will allow him to sleep until his own time. Back in the present, Ash returns to his job as a sales clerk at S-Mart; when the store is attacked by a deadite, he kills it and is again hailed as a hero.\n\nIn the original ending, a distracted Ash drinks one drop too many from the potion, awakening instead in post-apocalyptic London. The film then cuts to black as his insane laughter is heard.\n\nWhile Ash doesn’t have anything to do with the plot of the film, he does make an appearance after the credits, where the audience sees a silhouette of the side of his face before he says “Groovy”, his signature catchphrase, and looks to the audience.\n\nAsh appears non-canonically in the pornographic parody film \"Evil Head\" from 2012; in the parody, he is portrayed by Tommy Pistol, who won the 'Best Actor' award for the role at the 2014 AVN Award Show.\n\nIn 2015, an older Ash appears as the main character in \"Ash vs Evil Dead\", a horror comedy series for Starz. In an interview with \"Entertainment Weekly\", Campbell stated, \"Ash has survivor's guilt. You could have a heyday with his PTSD. He's a war vet. He doesn't want to talk about it, and he'll lie about that stump on his hand to impress the ladies. This is a guy who's got some issues. He's emotionally stunted. But he's the guy you want in the foxhole next to you.\"\n\nIn an attempt to impress a date, Ash accidentally releases the Kandarian Demon by reading from the \"Necronomicon\" while intoxicated. His former coworkers Pablo Bolivar and Kelly Maxwell join forces with him after their encounters with the Evil Dead. Ash eventually discovers that the key to dispelling the evil is returning the book to the cabin and bury it within its grounds.\n\nAt the cabin, the group is confronted by Ruby, an ancient being and the original author of Necronomicon. Ruby offers Ash a compromise: if he allows her to release her demonic children as well as lord over them, then she will not only spare Pablo and Kelly but also fulfill his dream of living a normal life with his friends in Jacksonville, Florida. Ash accepts, delighting in the idea of finally living a normal quiet life. As the trio drive off, a radio broadcast reveals mysterious sinkholes are erupting across the country.\n\nAsh's partying in Jacksonville is cut short when deadites show up. Declaring that Ruby has sent them, one calls him \"Ashy Slashy\". It is revealed that, after escaping from the cabin Ash had returned home, only for no one to believe him about the deadites. Instead believing that Ash had killed his sister and friends, they gave him the nickname \"Ashy Slashy\" and drove him out of town. Returning to Elk Grove to search for Ruby, Ash is reunited with his estranged father Brock who disowned him after Cheryl's death.\n\nRuby reveals that her children have betrayed her and attempted to take possession of the book themselves in order to summon a demon known as Baal; Ash and his friends form an alliance with Ruby to retrieve the Necronomicon and send the demon spawn back to hell. Reclaiming the book and throwing it into a portal to hell, the group unknowingly allows Baal to enter the mortal world.\n\nAfter awakening in an asylum, Ash is confronted by a doctor (Baal in disguise) who tries to convince Ash that there were no demons but merely \"delusions\". As time goes on Ash appears to succumb to Baal's attempts, obeying commands to capture his former allies. However, it is revealed that Ash was merely playing along in order to gather the group to return Baal to hell; they succeed but Pablo is killed in the process.\n\nRecalling previous adventures via time travel, Ash theorizes that it may be possible to bring Pablo back from the dead by going back in time to the cabin and preventing his younger self from ever finding the \"Necronomicon\". Taken back into the past by Ruby, the group is confronted by Baal and a younger Ruby; when Ash finally defeats Baal the cabin is set ablaze and sinks into the depths of hell. The trio return to the present and the citizens of Elk Grove throw a parade in Ash's honor. In a grateful speech, Ash declares that he wants to stay in Elk Grove and defend the town if evil ever returns. A post credits scene reveals the Necronomicon on the cabin grounds, left behind by Ash.\n\nAfter the Necronomicon is once again found and read, the Evil Dead makes a return to Elk Grove. Ash reunites with former lover Candace Barr, and learns he has a daughter, Brandy. Ash, Pablo, and Kelly unite against the younger Ruby who plans to kill Ash and turn his long-lost daughter against him. Also introduced are the Knights of Sumeria, an ancient order dedicated to defeating the evil that worship Ash and his destiny to save mankind.\n\nEntering through a dimensional rift, the Dark Ones take revenge on Ruby for imprisoning them millennia ago and reclaim the Necronomicon. With the Dark Ones now in the mortal realm, evil dead are summoned worldwide and a massive creature, Kandar the Destroyer, is unleashed. In Elk Grove, while military forces evacuate citizens, Ash decides to stay behind in order to finally fulfill his destiny of defeating the evil. After saying a heartfelt goodbye to his friends and daughter, Ash commandeers an abandoned tank and fires the Kandarian dagger into the head of Kandar, destroying the evil and saving the world.\n\nAwakening from a coma in the far distant, technologically advanced future, Ash is told that his friends are still alive but that the Dark Ones are on the move. The series ends with Ash saying his iconic line \"Groovy\" as he embarks on another quest to save the world.\n\nIn the 2000s, Bruce Campbell voiced Ash in a trilogy of video games. The first was \"\" released in 2000 on PlayStation, Dreamcast, and Windows. This game continues after \"Army of Darkness\". Ash is dating Jenny, a fellow S-Mart employee. After she convinces him to return to the cabin to face his fears, his severed hand replays the tape and sets the evil loose again. The second game, \"\", released in 2003 on Xbox and PlayStation 2. In this game Ash mentions Jenny died in a bus accident previous to this game. Ash watches TV in a bar in Dearborn, Michigan, where a local TV show, \"Mysteries of the Occult,\" reads the passages from the \"Necronomicon\" setting the evil loose and possessing most of the town. The game also features time-travel, including colonial times and the civil war era. The third and final game was \",\" released in 2005 on Xbox, PlayStation 2, and Windows. This game plays through an alternate history: instead of being sucked into the vortex at the end of \"Evil Dead II\", Ash has been placed in a mental institution for the criminally insane. His doctor has gone mad and, having obtained the \"Necronomicon\", releases the deadites once again.\n\nAsh appears in Telltale Games' \"Poker Night 2\". The player participates in a poker tournament against Williams, Sam from \"Sam & Max\", Claptrap from \"Borderlands\", and Brock Samson from \"The Venture Bros\". \n\nThere is a special conversation in the game where if the player chooses to play in an Evil Dead-inspired room, GLaDOS (the games' dealer) will reveal that Ash is actually Brock's ancestor through time travel as Ash had slept with a woman whose family line Brock is a member of some time during his adventure in \"Army of Darkness\". In another conversation between him and Brock, it is revealed that the store Ash previously worked for, S-Mart, is confirmed to exist in the Venture Bros. universe.\n\nAsh Williams also makes an appearance as a player character in the run-and-gun platform game \"Broforce\". In keeping with the game's naming convention, he is referred to as \"Ash Brolliams\".\n\nA leak in the perk selection screen revealed that Ash would be making an appearance in \"Dead by Daylight\". He was later officially announced with a trailer on the 28th of March, and released on April 2nd.\n\nIn 1992, Dark Horse Comics released a three-issue adaptation of \"Army of Darkness\" , adapted by John Bolton from Sam and Ivan Raimi's original script.\n\nIn 2004, Dynamite Entertainment acquired the rights to produce comics based off the \"Army of Darkness\" film, featuring Ash as the main character, starting with a four-issue miniseries titled \"Army of Darkness: Ashes 2 Ashes\" released in the fall of 2004. This miniseries later received two sequels (\"Army of Darkness: Shop 'Till You Drop Dead\" and \"Army of Darkness vs. Re-Animator\", both released in 2005) which eventually turned into an ongoing series, and later more crossovers (most notably \"Marvel Zombies vs. The Army of Darkness\" and \"Freddy vs. Jason vs. Ash\" from 2007). These comics featured a version of Ash from a world where the events of the \"Evil Dead\" films didn't take place until the early 21st century, which was later designated by Marvel Comics as \"Earth-818793\" as part of their multiverse numbering system. In 2013, Dynamite announced a reboot of their \"Army of Darkness\" line titled \"\"Ash And The Army of Darkness\"\", which featured a new version of Ash Williams, one who chose to stay in the Middle Ages following an unexpected return to that time period. This rebooted series ran for eight issues, but was followed-up by two miniseries, \"Army of Darkness: Ash Gets Hitched\", and \"Army of Darkness\" Volume 4 (better known as \"Ash In Space\") in 2014. Dynamite returned to their original \"Earth-818793\" version of Ash with 2016's \"Army of Darkness: Furious Road\" miniseries, but have since gone on to publish more crossovers with other licensed titles that are independent of this continuity (such as \"KISS/Army of Darkness\" and \"Vampirella/Army of Darkness\"). In 2019, Dynamite launched the crossover miniseries, \"Army of Darkness/Bubba Ho-Tep\", seeing Ash team up with another Bruce Campbell character, Elvis.\n\nIn 2016, Space Goat Publishing released \"Evil Dead 2: Beyond Dead By Dawn\", a three-issue series that, much like Dynamite's \"Army of Darkness\" books, took the liberty of stating that the events of the first two \"Evil Dead\" films took place in the 21st century. The series (and its several sequels and one-shot follow-ups) features a simulacrum clone of Ash Williams as the main character, which was created from the original Ash's right hand by Annie Knowby.\n\nAccording to Sam Raimi, Ash's name is a reference to his originally intended fate at the end of \"The Evil Dead\", stating \"that's all that was going to be left of him in the end.\" Campbell, however, suggested the name was short for \"Ashley\"; the character is also referred to as \"Ashley\" by his sister Cheryl in the original \"Evil Dead\". When creating \"Army of Darkness\", Raimi toyed with giving him the full name \"Ashley J. Williams\", which was later used by video games and comics involving the character. Campbell later confirmed in \"Cinefantastique\" that the full name was official. The \"Ash vs. Evil Dead\" episode \"Unfinished Business\" also reveals that his middle name is Joanna (the \"Army of Darkness\" comics had given his middle name as \"James\" after his grandfather, a fictitious member of the Untouchables).\n\nBruce Campbell has stated Ash is incompetent at everything except fighting the Evil Dead. Campbell also added that Ash is \"a bad slow thinker and a good fast thinker\". He knows some degree of hand-to-hand combat techniques, and shows prowess with a variety of weapons in various situations. His main strength seems to be his ingenuity: although he is repeatedly noted in the audio commentaries for \"The Evil Dead\" and \"Evil Dead II\" for his stupidity and ignorance, he has from the second film on been shown creating such things ranging from his chainsaw bracket and shotgun harness, gunpowder from mainly referencing its elemental makeup in a chemistry book, a fully functional prosthetic hand from a metal gauntlet, and the short-lived \"Deathcoaster\".\n\nHis invention and ingenuity are further expanded on in the games: in \"\", he creates fully functional weapons such as a flamethrower and a harpoon gun from spare parts that are merely laying about; and in \"\", the inventiveness seems to run in Ash's family, as his blacksmith ancestor in the Colonial Dearborn level is quickly able to make a flamethrower and a Gatling gun from spare parts Ash finds for him, when Ash says those things \"haven't even been invented yet\". In the 1992 comic adaptation of \"Army of Darkness\" written by Sam and Ivan Raimi, Ash says that he has a degree in engineering from Michigan State University.\n\nAsh's personality and state of mind change drastically throughout the franchise. In \"The Evil Dead\" and the beginning of \"Evil Dead II\", he is something of a laid-back everyman, but by the middle of \"Evil Dead II\" and into \"Army of Darkness\", he has grown into a much braver person, and becomes the voice of encouragement and confidence in Arthur's castle. It is at this point that Ash becomes known for his one-liners, and his personality takes on a more cynical, embittered tone. Raimi has said that he feels Ash's personality transformation in \"Darkness\" was very out of character.\n\nIn \"The Evil Dead\", Ash is portrayed as being cowardly and incapable of dealing with the horrors presented to him. Over the course of the film, Ash gradually overcomes his fears and manages to fight off his possessed friends. Also, he is shown to take his predicament very seriously in the first film, rather than in a comedic manner, as in the subsequent films. \"Evil Dead II\" portrays Ash as a braver character. Campbell commented that in the film Ash is more than capable at fighting off monsters. The character gradually became more of an antihero within \"Evil Dead II\" and its sequel, \"Army of Darkness.\" Ash's most defining characteristic is the chainsaw attached to his right arm, placed after cutting off his possessed hand in \"Evil Dead II\".\n\nSince Army of Darkness, Ash has been portrayed consistently as in Bruce Campbell's words \"a guy who doesn't know anything, a big talker\". Ash rarely takes situations seriously and is very incompetent as a hero or protagonist; He's often causing the conflict that drives the story forward rather than solving it while having a selfish, self-serving attitude towards others at the same time. In \"Ash vs. Evil Dead\", many of his neighbors call him an \"asshole\" and complain about his narcissistic cocky attitude while his boss frequently hounds him for making up excuses for getting out of work. At the same time Ash has been portrayed as a womanizer and in the television series has been show to flat out lie and invent sympathetic anecdotes to sleep with women at local bars. \"Ash vs. Evil Dead\" reveals that his father Brock Williams was often overly competitive with him as a child and it seems that many of Ash's traits have originated from his father's behavior. Despite his immature conceited attitude, Ash has been shown to have a softer, more heroic side. In \"Army of Darkness\" he chooses to stay behind and help the people of Arthur's castle fight the deadite army despite having nothing to gain from doing so. Over the course of the television series, Ash bonds with Pablo and Kelly, at one point calling Kelly the \"daughter he never had.\" He also shows regret and remorse when he's forced to kill his elderly neighbor when she's becomes possessed and tries to kill him.\n\nBy the time of \"Ash vs. Evil Dead\", decades after the original films, Ash has aged considerably; he now wears dentures, a \"man girdle\", and dyes his hair. According to Bruce Campbell, \"we're milking the age thing now. He was the wrong guy thirty-five years ago, and now he's really the wrong guy for the job and that made it an interesting character to play\". Campbell and Raimi have stated that Ash also wears adult diapers; early drafts of the script depicted Ash's struggle with incontinence, which Raimi joked to producers was a \"marketing opportunity\" for Depend product placement. Campbell expressed hope that Ash's incontinence would feature in future episodes, as it made him \"more normal\" and relatable to the audience; a package of adult diapers eventually do appear onscreen in season two's \"Home\", in the trunk of Ash's car.\nAsh's dark side manifests itself as a separate entity, referred to in \"Army of Darkness\" as \"Bad Ash\", and also as \"Evil Ash\" by fans. This persona first appears in \"Evil Dead II\", where Ash experiences a hallucination wherein his reflection torments him over dismembering their girlfriend Linda with a chainsaw, and proceeds to try to choke him, only for Ash to realize he is choking himself. This side of him later splits off his body in \"Army of Darkness\", becoming \"Bad Ash\". Ash seemingly kills his doppelganger and buries him, but \"Bad Ash\" is revived after Ash incorrectly recites the \"Necronomicon\" incantations. Bad Ash later leads the Army to Arthur's castle to retrieve the \"Necronomicon\", even corrupting Ash's then-love interest Sheila. He battles \"Good Ash\" for the \"Necronomicon\", gets burnt with a torch, and continues fighting as a skeleton. Finally, Ash cuts off his alter ego's right hand and catapults him into the sky on a lit sack of gunpowder, which explodes and destroys Bad Ash.\n\nA new version of Bad Ash appears in the television series \"Ash vs Evil Dead\", spawned from Ash's dismembered hand from \"Evil Dead II\". While essentially exactly the same character, he has more in common with Ash in terms of personality, and even sharing old injuries and ailments which Ash uses to his advantage during their fight. Rather than being overtly evil and openly hostile, this version is more subtle and comes across as a psychopath, being friendly and flirty towards Amanda at first but becomes unstable and aggressive when she rejects him. Another Bad Ash appears in the third season of the show, a demonic clone created by Ruby. Born as an infant (but demonstrating superhuman abilities), he soon grows to again resemble the adult Ash. In contrast to the independence of other incarnations, this Bad Ash is noticeably subservient to his mother.\n\nAsh ranked eleventh on UGO.com's Top 100 Heroes of All Time list, describing him as \"an egomaniacal, complaining, misogynistic goon\", but also the best \"demon and zombie killer ever to be portrayed on the silver screen\". They additionally praised the character for his humility at the conclusion of \"Army of Darkness\", in returning to his own time. \"Empire\" ranked him the 24th Greatest Movie Character on their list of 100, calling him a \"truly iconic horror hero\", and a \"delirious, delicious, dimwitted\" parody of action heroes. He was also ranked number 77 on Fandomania's list of the \"100 Greatest Fictional Characters\".\n\nThe \"Evil Dead\" films and the character of Ash influenced many 1990s first-person shooters such as \"Doom\", \"Duke Nukem 3D\", and \"Blood\". Duke Nukem quotes so many lines from Ash that Bruce Campbell stated that he was angered by not being paid for them.\n\nAnother notable video game character influenced by Ash is Alisa Bosconovitch. Speaking on Alisa's creation, \"Tekken\" project director and chief producer Katsuhiro Harada explained, \"Alisa was something we created based on internal staff feedback. We really wanted a character with chainsaws on her arms [...] I'm a huge fan of Sam Raimi's \"Evil Dead\".\"\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2268305", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2268305", "title": "Veterans Memorial Stadium (Cedar Rapids)", "text": "Veterans Memorial Stadium (Cedar Rapids)\n\nVeterans Memorial Stadium is a minor league baseball stadium in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. It is the home field of the Cedar Rapids Kernels of the Midwest League. It is often called New Veterans Memorial Stadium to distinguish it from the original Veterans Memorial Stadium, which existed from 1949 to 2001.\n\nVeterans Memorial Stadium is located southwest of downtown Cedar Rapids on Rockford Road. The Cedar Rapids Ice Arena and Kingston Stadium, home to Kennedy, Jefferson, and Washington high school football, are both adjacent to Veterans Memorial Stadium.\n\nVeterans Memorial Stadium has a total seating capacity of 5,300. It has 12 luxury suites and several sections that are reserved for group outings, including a mezzanine terrace in the upper deck behind first base, a pavilion in left field, and a pre-game picnic area.\n\nIn addition to Kernels games, Veterans Memorial Stadium hosted the Midwest League All-Star Game in 2004, and again in 2016. On July 9, 2005, the stadium hosted its first concert, featuring Bob Dylan and Willie Nelson. The American Legion World Series was held there in 2006. It is also occasionally used for high school and college baseball games, including the annual American Rivers Conference baseball tournament. It hosted the annual \"Corridor Classic\" between the Iowa Hawkeyes and the Northern Iowa Panthers until the University of Northern Iowa discontinued its baseball program.\n\nThe city of Cedar Rapids owns Veterans Memorial Stadium, which was named to honor veterans of all wars, and the city's Veterans Memorial Commission operates and maintains the stadium. The Linn County All Veterans Memorial is located next to the stadium. In March 2004 the Kernels and the city agreed to a new 40-year lease agreement that reduced the ballclub's monthly payments from the original 20-year agreement that they had signed when the new stadium opened.\n\nIn March 2008 the Kernels sold the naming rights of the playing field to the Dale and Thomas Popcorn Company. The playing field was known as Dale and Thomas Popcorn Field at Veterans Memorial Stadium for the 2008 season. The field was renamed Perfect Game Field at Veterans Memorial Stadium when Perfect Game USA, a baseball scouting company based in Cedar Rapids, bought the naming rights to the field in March 2009 in a five-year contract.\n\nIn 2017, the stadium won a bid to host the NCAA Division III College World Series from 2019 to 2022, after long time host of the event the Fox Cities Stadium in Grand Chute, WI chose not to bid on the rights to host the event after 2018.\n\nThe original Veterans Memorial Stadium was built in 1949 for the Cedar Rapids Rockets of the Central Association. It later became home to the Cedar Rapids Indians (1950–1952), the Cedar Rapids Raiders (1953–1957), and the Cedar Rapids Braves (1958–1961) of the Illinois–Indiana–Iowa League. From 1962 until its demolition, Cedar Rapids' Midwest League teams—which went through several name changes before becoming the Kernels in 1993—played their home games there.\n\nDuring the 1990s, Veterans Memorial Stadium failed to meet many of Major League Baseball's new standards for minor league parks as newer facilities were opening in other Midwest League cities. On August 15, 2000, Cedar Rapids voters approved a referendum that helped provide some of the money needed to build a new ballpark adjacent to the old one. (Other funds came from the state of Iowa, the Kernels ballclub, and private donations.) The last game at the old Veterans Memorial Stadium was played on August 28, 2001, with the Kernels defeating the Wisconsin Timber Rattlers, 4–1. The stadium was demolished shortly afterwards and the site now serves as a parking lot for the new stadium.\n\nThe new Veterans Memorial Stadium was dedicated on April 7, 2002, but that day's scheduled game against the Quad City River Bandits was rained out. The first games were not played until April 9, when the Kernels swept a doubleheader from the River Bandits, 5–4 and 3–0.\n\n"}

He won the inter-high school boxing tournament in his senior year in high school, and moved on to Nihon University, where he won amateur titles in two weight classes, compiling a distinguished amateur record of 117–8 (87RSC). He was already touted as the next Japanese world champion when he announced his decision to turn professional.\n\nUehara made his debut on November 14, 1972, with a fourth-round knockout in Honolulu, Hawaii. He suffered his first professional loss in his second fight. He returned to Japan after five fights in the United States.\n\nHe won nine fights in a row after returning to Japan, including seven victories by knockout. Uehara returned to the United States in August, 1974 to challenge WBA super featherweight champion Ben Villaflor, but lost by second-round knockout.\n\nUehara won the Japanese super featherweight title on July 21, 1971, knocking out his opponent in the first round. He defended the title a total of ten times, a considerable number of defenses for a regional title.\n\nUehara was once again ranked as the number one WBA super featherweight challenger in 1980, and challenged Samuel Serrano for the Lineal and WBA super featherweight titles on the undercard of Thomas Hearns' win over José Cuevas in Detroit. Uehara was losing on all three judges' scorecards before connecting with a right hook to knock out the defending champion in the sixth round. Uehara's victory was named \"The Ring\"'s 1980 upset of the year.\n\nUehara defended his title in November 1980, before meeting Serrano for the second time in April 1981.

{"id": "2268318", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2268318", "title": "KFVS-TV", "text": "KFVS-TV\n\nKFVS-TV, virtual and VHF digital channel 12, is a CBS-affiliated television station licensed to Cape Girardeau, Missouri, United States, serving Southeastern Missouri, the Purchase area of Western Kentucky, Southern Illinois and Northwest Tennessee. Owned by Gray Television, it is a sister station to the low-powered CW affiliates WQWQ-LP/WQTV-LP, which are simulcast on KFVS-TV's second digital subchannel. The outlets share studios in the Hirsch Tower on Broadway Avenue in Downtown Cape Girardeau; KFVS-TV's transmitter is located northwest of Egypt Mills, in unincorporated Cape Girardeau County.\n\nKFVS had previously served the Jonesboro, Arkansas media market as the default CBS station on satellite providers. It is not known how much longer that arrangement will continue, after the sign-on of the Jonesboro area's first locally based CBS affiliate August 1, 2015 on a second digital subchannel of Fox affiliate KJNB-LD/KJNE-LD.\n\nKFVS began broadcasting on October 3, 1954 and aired an analog signal on VHF channel 12. It was owned by broadcasting pioneer Oscar C. Hirsch who had signed-on the area's first radio station, KFVS radio (AM 960, now KZIM) in his radio shop in 1925. The KFVS call letters were randomly assigned by then-Secretary of Commerce, Herbert Hoover. At the start, channel 12 did not have any video cameras. Instead, its first broadcast showed slides of its new transmitter tower that was under construction at the time. Channel 12 was housed along with its radio sister until 1968 when it moved to its present location on Broadway Avenue. Hirsch sold the station to AFLAC in 1979, but his family retained the radio station until 1985.\n\nIn 1997, AFLAC sold its entire broadcasting division, including KFVS, to a group headed by Retirement Systems of Alabama. It, in turn, merged with Ellis Communications a few months later to form Raycom Media. KFVS offered The Tube Music Network (a 24-hour digital music video channel) on its third digital subchannel which ceased operations on October 1, 2007.\n\nKFVS serves more than fifty counties in four states including all of Southeastern Missouri, Southern Illinois, Western Kentucky, and Western Tennessee. KFVS considers Clay County as the only Arkansas county in its viewing area as shown during its nightly weather segments which be seen in the local temperature graphic. Cable systems in Corning, Piggott, Rector, Marmaduke, Pollard, Greenway, St. Francis, and Lafe, Arkansas list KFVS on their local cable lineups. However, Jonesboro and Lake City cable systems do not carry the station. According to DirecTV, KFVS is carried on its Jonesboro area lineup as a local channel.\n\nWhile broadcasting an analog signal, a portion of its off-air signal reached into the Missouri Bootheel overlapping with sister stations WMC-TV in Memphis, Tennessee and KAIT in Jonesboro. KFVS refers to its viewing area as \"The Heartland\", which is included in WQTV/WQWQ's on-air branding. During the analog era, KFVS' coverage area overlapped with KMOV in St. Louis. In fact, channel 12's over-the-air coverage extended as far north as the St. Louis suburb of Belleville, Illinois. Cable systems in several northern KFVS counties and southern KMOV counties carried both stations.\n\nOn June 25, 2018, Atlanta-based Gray Television announced it had reached an agreement with Raycom to merge their respective broadcasting assets (consisting of Raycom's 63 existing owned-and/or-operated television stations, including KFVS and WQTV/WQWQ), and Gray's 93 television stations) under the former's corporate umbrella. The cash-and-stock merger transaction valued at $3.6 billion—in which Gray shareholders would acquire preferred stock currently held by Raycom—resulted in KFVS and WQTV/WQWQ gaining new sister stations in nearby markets, including NBC/ABC affiliates KYTV and KSPR-LD in Springfield and ABC/Fox affiliate WBKO in Bowling Green, in addition to its current Raycom sister stations. The sale was approved on December 20, and was completed on January 2, 2019.\n\nThe station's digital signal is multiplexed:\nWQTV and WQWQ do not transmit digital signals of their own, and due to their low-powered status, they only cover the immediate areas surrounding Murray and Paducah, Kentucky. Therefore, KFVS-DT2 serves as that purpose which extends their reach throughout the entire market.\n\nKFVS-TV shut down its analog signal, over VHF channel 12, on June 12, 2009, the official date in which full-power television stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station's digital signal relocated from its pre-transition UHF channel 57, which was among the high band UHF channels (52-69) that were removed from broadcasting use as a result of the transition, to its analog-era VHF channel 12.\n\nSyndicated programming on KFVS includes \"The Middle\", \"The Kelly Clarkson Show\", \"The Dr. Oz Show\", and \"Live with Kelly and Ryan\" among others.\n\nCompared with the other big three stations in the market, KFVS has traditionally covered Southeastern Missouri. The newscasts of ABC affiliate WSIL-TV focus exclusively on Southern Illinois, from studios in Carterville, and it does not even mention the market's other two primary cities (Cape Girardeau and Paducah) in its on-air legal identification. This is despite the fact that WSIL operates a full-time satellite, KPOB, in Poplar Bluff, Missouri. KFVS offers secondary coverage of Southern Illinois from a newsroom on East Plaza Drive in Carterville near WSIL. NBC affiliate WPSD-TV, based in Paducah, focuses more on the Western Kentucky side although that station operates a bureau in Marion, Illinois.\n\nAt one point in time, KFVS produced a nightly prime time newscast on WQTV/WQWQ. Known as \"Heartland News at 9\", the show could be seen for a half-hour and was targeted specifically at a Southeastern Missouri audience. It competed with another broadcast in the time slot on Fox affiliate KBSI which also aired every night for thirty minutes. However, that program was produced by WPSD so it featured more of a regional summary of headlines since it originated from the NBC outlet's facility in Kentucky. The WQTV/WQWQ newscast was dropped after the July 29, 2007 edition. WQTV/WQWQ currently replay three weekday newscasts from KFVS including the 6 a.m. hour of \"The Breakfast Show\" (at 7), \"Heartland News at Noon\" (at 1 p.m.), and \"Heartland News at 10\" (at 11 p.m.). The Sunday edition of \"The Breakfast Show\" is also repeated on those stations.\n\nOn October 1, 2010, \"Heartland News at 9\" was brought back after a news share agreement was established with KBSI (owned by the Sinclair Broadcast Group). That channel now offers a nightly hour-long prime time newscast originating from the KFVS studios. With that addition, this station offers more than thirty hours of local news each week. Unlike other outsourced news arrangements at Sinclair-owned television stations, KBSI features the same graphics scheme and music package as seen on this CBS outlet. Also, there are no on-air duratrans separately identifying the Fox newscast. In instances of severe weather (most notably during a tornado warning in the viewing area), KBSI may simulcast live coverage from KFVS if an event occurs outside the prime time newscast. On October 3, 2010, WPSD brought back its own newscast at 9 p.m. known as \"The Nine\" to both of its digital subchannels which is seen every night, except Saturdays, for a half-hour, until it was cancelled in 2019.\n\nIn July 2011, KFVS became the second news operation in the market to upgrade local news production to high definition level. Included with the switch was the debut of a new studio and updated graphics (the KBSI newscast was included in the change).\n\nDuring weather segments, the station uses live NOAA National Weather Service radar data from several regional sites. This system is known on-air as \"First Alert Doppler Network\". KFVS also operates its own Doppler weather radar, called \"Live StormTeam Radar\", that is located on top of the Hirsch building. It is a Collins radar sold by ADC in Bloomington, Indiana and is the only live radar source in the market since the National Weather Service data seen on rival stations is delayed.\n\n"}
{"id": "2268320", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2268320", "title": "Thulsa Doom", "text": "Thulsa Doom\n\nThulsa Doom is a fictional character first appearing in the Kull short story \"Delcardes' Cat\" by Robert E. Howard. He has since appeared in comic books and film as the nemesis of Kull and, later, one of Howard's other creations, Conan the Barbarian. Thulsa Doom is the prototype for many of the future undead evil wizards, such as Tsotha-Lanti (in the Conan saga) and Kathulos (in the Skull Face novelette); other living or revenant Howardian practitioners of magic such as Thoth Amon, Thugra Khotan, Kathulos, and Xaltotun bear some psychological similarities to Thulsa Doom even if their actual appearance is vastly different.\n\nThulsa Doom first appeared (as Thulses Doom) at the end of the short story \"Delcardes' Cat\" by Robert E. Howard, which featured the character Kull as the protagonist. Howard later edited the text to include foreshadowing/references to Thulsa Doom (as he had been rechristened) throughout the story and changed the title to \"The Cat and the Skull\" to reflect this. Editor Patrice Louinet speculated that this was because Howard had originally intended Kuthulos (whom Doom impersonated in this story) to be the actual villain before coming up with Thulsa Doom near the story's completion. This version was submitted to \"Weird Tales\" in 1928, but it was not accepted. The story did not see print until 1967 in the paperback \"King Kull\" published by Lancer Books.\n\nThulsa Doom is described by Howard in \"The Cat and the Skull\" as having a face \"like a bare white skull, in whose eye sockets flamed livid fire\". He is seemingly invulnerable, boasting after being trampled by one of Kull's comrades that he feels \"only a slight coldness\" when being injured and will only \"pass to some other sphere when [his] time comes\".\n\nAs Thulsa Doom's original story was not published in Howard's lifetime he reused the character as \"Kathulos of Atlantis\" in his 1929 story Skull-Face.\n\nA powerful necromancer, Thulsa Doom is primary foe of Kull's comics version. He was often a featured foe in the Marvel Kull comics (for instance, \"Kull the Conqueror\" #3 and #7). Thulsa Doom returns in \"Kull the Conqueror\" #11, \"By This Axe I Rule\", based on an original story by Robert E. Howard. Posing as the nobleman Ardyon, he forms an alliance with four rebels within Valusia: the dwarfish Ducalon, the soldier Enaros, Baron Kanuub, and the minstrel Ridondo, who actually dethroned the hero, and set him on a quest to regain his lost kingdom, in the pages of his own comic, until it was cancelled. Kull resumes his quest in the pages of \"Kull and the Barbarians\", a black-and-white Marvel magazine format (published under the Curtis Magazines imprint). Thulsa Doom sent members of his Black Legion to ambush Kull and Brule, though they won the fight. Thulsa observed the battle through a magic crystal. Kull and Brule's ship was later attacked by a sea serpent, with which Thulsa may or may not have had anything to do.\n\n\"Kull and the Barbarians\" lasted for three issues until it was cancelled. In the return of \"Kull the Destroyer\", Thulsa Doom/Ardyon learned of the curse of Torranna (essentially, if a scarred man wore the crown and sat on the throne, he would be unable to ever leave the throne), which he determined to bestow upon Kull. To this end, he took on the aspect of the god of Torranna and advised its inhabitants how best to bring this about. Thulsa Doom manipulated Garn-Nak, Karr-Lo-Zann, and Norra of Torranna. They drew Kull into Torranna and had him undergo a series of trials to gain the crown of Torranna. Kull sought the crown because he believed he could use the army of Torranna to help him retake the crown of Valusia from Thulsa Doom.\n\nIn \"Kull the Destroyer\" #28, Kull successfully completed the last of the trials, but before he could don the crown, Norra warned him of the curse of Torranna. Thulsa Doom allowed Norra's age to catch up with her, turning her into a shriveled corpse, and then revealed himself to Kull, challenging him to one final battle. In the next issue (also the final issue of the \"Kull the Destroyer\" title), Thulsa Doom pulled Kull into a pocket dimension for their final battle. Kull managed to slash Thulsa Doom's face with his sword, but was ultimately overpowered by the necromancer. Thulsa Doom returned them both to Torranna, but Kull rallied long enough to push Thulsa Doom onto the throne and place the crown on his head. His face scarred by Kull, Thulsa fulfilled the prophecy and fell victim to the curse himself. Thulsa's power were drained by his curse as the city of Torranna collapsed, seemingly crushing him. Kull, luckily, escaped, and then returned to Valusia to retake his own throne.\n\nKull would face Thulsa Doom at least one more time, in the pages of \"Marvel Preview #19\" (summer 1979 issue). The script for that issue was an adaptation of the prose tale \"Riders beyond the Sunrise\", itself the completion by writer Lin Carter of an untitled fragment written by R. E. Howard. Thulsa Doom appears to finally perish at the climax of this story, but he would eventually return as a Conan villain in the pages of \"Conan\" and a few issues of Conan's black-and-white magazine, \"Savage Sword of Conan\" (issues #190–193). He's apparently immortal and is visualized as a skull-headed sorcerer, or as an albino when taking on the illusory appearance of a living man. A similar concept of an undead sorcerer can also be found in the lich from \"Dungeons and Dragons\" and other works of fantasy fiction, such as \"The Sword and the Sorcerer\".\n\nAmerican company Dynamite Entertainment published a \"Thulsa Doom\" mini-series written by Arvid Nelson, with art by Lui Antonio, for a total of four issues in 2009.\n\nThulsa Doom later becomes an enemy of the Celtic hero Cormac Mac Art, another Howard character further expanded by Andrew J. Offutt.\n\nSet in the time of King Arthur (though Arthur himself does't appear onstage) Thulsa Doom comes back to life after 18,000 years on a sinister deserted island. Recognizing Cormac Mac Art – an Irish adventurer who joined a band of Danish vikings – as a reincarnation of his old enemy King Kull, Thulsa Doom immediately resumes his ancient vendetta and relentlessly seeks to kill Mac Art.\n\nAs depicted by Offutt, Thulsa Doom possess remarkable shape-changing powers, being able to take not only the form but also the precise mannerisms of Cormac mac Art's close friends. This includes also a perfect sex change ability. On one occasion, Thulsa Doom is able to perfectly imitate Cormac mac Art's girlfriend, speak convincing words of love to a man who knows her well and is in love with her, and engage in full-fledged sex – with the intention of taking Mac Art by surprise and suddenly drawing steel. However, at the moment of his attack, Thulsa Doom shows his true skull face, enabling Mac Art to realize the deception and save himself at the last moment.\n\nThulsa Doom is also seen as controlling the elements and being able to call up a storm out of a calm sea.\n\nWhile Thulsa Doom cannot be killed – even when pierced by a sword or thrown from a great height – he's vulnerable to steel being driven through his body, such steel acting to imprison him and prevent Doom from getting away.\n\nHoward's 1929 novella \"Skull-Face\" features a resuscitated Atlantean necromancer appearing in the present-day world and seeking to take it over. This villain is very similar to Thulsa Doom, but is named \"Kathulos of Atlantis\".\n\nA character of the same name is the main antagonist in the 1982 movie \"Conan the Barbarian\". Played by James Earl Jones, the cinematic Thulsa Doom is considerably different from the literary one, who is described as having a skull-like face. Pre-production drawings showed this version of Thulsa Doom with the skull-like face, but as filmed, he is essentially the classic Conan villain Thoth-Amon, servant of the serpent-god Set. As such, he appears as an ordinary human in the film, though one said to have lived for a thousand years and with the power to transform into an enormous snake.\n\nIn July 2008, Dynamite Entertainment announced that Djimon Hounsou signed to co-produce and star as Thulsa Doom in a film version based on the comic books, rather than Robert E. Howard's original incarnation, although the film has not been made yet.\n\n"}

{"id": "2268328", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2268328", "title": "Dick Price", "text": "Dick Price\n\nRichard \"Dick\" Price (October 12, 1930 – November 25, 1985) was co-founder of the Esalen Institute in 1962 and a veteran of the Beat Generation. He ran Esalen in Big Sur for many years, sometimes virtually single-handed. He developed a practice of hiking the Santa Lucia Mountains and developed a new form of personal integration and growth that he called Gestalt Practice, partly based upon Gestalt therapy and Buddhist practice.\n\nPrice consciously applied psychological principles to his sense of self, and helped many people work to do the same. His work remains at the core of the Esalen experience.\n\nDick Price was born October 12, 1930, to Herman and Audrey Price in Rogers Park. He died when he was struck by a boulder while hiking near Esalen on November 25, 1985, and is survived by his wife, Christine Stewart Price, and two children, David and Jennifer Price. Price had a twin brother, Bobby, who died in 1933, and a sister Joan who was born in 1929.\n\nPrice's father Herman Price (anglicised from Preuss) was born in an Eastern European Jewish family in 1895. The family emigrated from Lithuania in 1911 (at that time a part of Russia), first to New York and finally to Chicago.\n\nDuring World War I his father served in the United States Coast Guard, and then in the United States Navy. Herman was a refrigeration expert. He headed appliance manufacturing and design at Sears for their Coldspot brand, working extensively with Raymond Loewy, who was a close family friend. In 1936, the family moved into the two-floor penthouse apartment in at 707 W. Junior Terrace, just off Lake Shore Drive in Chicago. With the onset of World War II, Herman was loaned by Sears to the Douglas Aircraft Company where he applied his assembly line experience to organizing the mass production of aircraft, including the B-17 in particular. Although Herman was a charismatic businessman, he was an emotionally withdrawn and distant father for Dick.\n\nPrice's mother, Audrey (Meyers) Price was born in Indiana in 1895, and grew up in Auburn, Illinois. She was of Dutch, Irish and English heritage. Audrey was a domineering figure in the family, and a problematic and intrusive mother for Dick.\n\nIn 1941, the Price family moved to Kenilworth on the North Shore of Chicago. Dick graduated from New Trier High School in 1948. He joined New Trier's wrestling team and placed second in his weight class in the state of Illinois.\n\nPrice graduated from Stanford University in 1952 with a major in psychology. While at Stanford, Price studied with both Gregory Bateson and Frederic Spiegelberg. They would later prove to be pivotal influences when he founded and developed programs at Esalen Institute. He did graduate work in the social relations department at Harvard University, although he left before completing his degree because of his frustration with the conservative, research-oriented faculty.\n\nAfter leaving Harvard in 1955, Price enlisted in the Air Force and was given an assignment in the East Bay (San Francisco Bay Area). He rented a room in San Francisco at Alan Watts’ and Frederic Spiegelberg’s newly founded American Academy of Asian Studies (the precursor to the California Institute of Integral Studies). During this time, the North Beach Beat scene was an emerging social trend. Dick knew most of the primary figures, including Jack Kerouac, Allen Ginsberg, and Gary Snyder. Dick married his first wife, Bonnie, in a Zen ceremony.\n\nIn 1956, Price experienced an episode of manic psychosis in San Francisco which he later described as simply \"a state\", what he believed was a mental break that was transitory and which he needed to go through and experience rather than repress or manage. He was hospitalized, returned to Chicago, and discharged from the Air Force.\n\nOn December 7, 1956, Price was involuntarily committed by his parents to the Institute of Living, an exclusive mental treatment facility in Connecticut. While hospitalized, he was misdiagnosed as a schizophrenic, then subjected to physical confinement and major tranquilizers, along with numerous electroconvulsive and insulin shock treatments. While committed, his mother had his marriage annulled He was released almost a year later on Thanksgiving Day 1957. Price never forgave his parents for their actions during this episode.\n\nPrice wrote about his hospitalization experience:\n\nAfter his release, Price went back to the Chicago area, where he worked for his uncles' sign company, Price Brothers. However, the work did not engage his imagination.\n\nIn May 1960, Price returned to San Francisco and took up residence at the East-West House with Gia-Fu Feng. That year he met fellow Stanford University graduate Michael Murphy at Haridas Chaudhuri’s Cultural Integration Fellowship where Murphy was in residence. Dick moved into the Cultural Integration Fellowship as well. They conceived of the idea of a place where individuals could become open to ways of thinking while avoiding the dogma often associated with groups organized around a single idea promoted by a charismatic leader. In 1961, Murphy and Price visited the oceanside property in Big Sur, California, that was owned by Murphy's family. The property included a natural hot springs.\n\nIn 1962, using the Murphy property and capital that Dick had accumulated, along with assistance from Alan Watts, Aldous Huxley, Laura Huxley, Gerald Heard, Gregory Bateson and Frederic Spiegelberg (with whom both had studied at Stanford), Price and Murphy founded the Esalen Institute. Among other objectives, Price saw Esalen as an alternative to then current mental health practice, especially the practices of mental hospitals. Esalen was to be a place where inner process could move forward safely and without interruption.\n\nPreviously, the natural hot springs baths on the Murphy property were part of a run-down resort (known as Slate's Hot Springs). The security guard was a young Hunter S. Thompson. Joan Baez was also in residence. Thompson was soon fired by Murphy's grandmother, although Baez remained in residence through the beginnings of Esalen. Henry Miller regularly visited the hot springs during this early period of Esalen's history. In the middle of 1962, Abraham Maslow happened to drive onto the Esalen grounds and soon became an important influence on the development of the institute. Julian Silverman came to Esalen in 1965, in order to work on the schizophrenia project at Agnews State Hospital, and ended up serving as Esalen's general manager. Will Schutz came to Esalen in the 1960s and worked on aspects of his \"encounter group\" process. George Leonard, Joseph Campbell and Ida Rolf were among the many people who had an impact upon Esalen's development. In 1974, Price married his second wife, Christine Stewart Price, a Gestalt practitioner who became his primary collaborator at Esalen.\n\nPrice's interest in the expansion of human potentials led him to investigate many avenues of research, including the exploration of altered states of consciousness with psychotropic substances. In the early 1960s he experimented with LSD administered by a psychiatrist. Later he discovered that empathogens, such as MDMA, facilitated self-exploration and were helpful in psychological healing when used in conjunction with therapy.\n\nIn 1973, Price was instrumental in bringing Stanislav Grof to Esalen in the capacity of Scholar in Residence. Grof was interested in the enhancement of human potentials through the induction of non-ordinary states of consciousness. He had conducted research with LSD at the Psychiatric Research Center in Prague, followed by similar research at Johns Hopkins University and the Maryland Psychiatric Research Center. At Esalen, Price encouraged Grof to develop the therapeutic technique of Holotropic Breathwork, which functioned as a substitute for psychedelic drugs.\n\nIn 1964, Fritz Perls, the psychiatrist who developed Gestalt therapy together with his wife Laura Perls, arrived at Esalen. During Perls' time at Esalen, Price became one of his primary students. He was also influenced by the work of Wilhelm Reich, who had been Perls' analyst. Price worked with Perls for approximately four years, from 1966 to 1970. During this period Price experienced a second brief manic break, arising from the unresolved trauma of his commitment. Perls declared this episode fully resolved and then told Price that it was time for him to start teaching Gestalt on his own.\n\nDuring the time that Price ran Esalen, he educated himself widely in Western psychology and Eastern religions, including Buddhism and Taoism. He drew from the work of many teachers who came to Esalen over the years. Gestalt Practice provided a humane approach that pulled together all these strands of ancient and modern knowledge into a coherent technique, similar to shamanistic methods of healing. This practice allowed Price to work with other people as real people, not as objects that needed to be \"fixed\" in some way. Throughout the 1970s and early 1980s, Price continued practicing, modifying, and teaching Gestalt at Esalen, until his death in a hiking accident on November 25, 1985, when he was struck by a falling boulder. The method of Gestalt Practice that Dick Price developed remains one of his most important achievements. \n\nPrice would frequently hike the trails of the Santa Lucia Range, both for pleasure and for relief from the pressures of running Esalen Institute. This became a part of his process. Hiking was often a solitary practice for him, although he regularly took other people along. Sometimes he worked with them while hiking, doing Gestalt sessions that would turn out to be quite moving.\n\nSteven Harper was one of Price's close friends and hiking partners at Esalen. Harper became a permanent resident of Big Sur and a leader of wilderness process groups at Esalen. After Price's death, Harper was also able to secure the official naming of two geographic features for Price. A very prominent ridge behind Esalen is now called Price Ridge, and a trail is named Price-Gagarin Trail after Price and his friend Andrew Gagarin.\n\nIn the time since his death, Price's work has remained influential. Along with his role in founding and guiding Esalen Institute, he influenced many people's lives with his work in Gestalt Practice groups.\n\nIn 2013, during a period of management changes, Christine Stewart Price, the widow of Dick Price, decided to withdraw from teaching at Esalen Institute. She founded an organization named Tribal Ground Circle to continue Dick Price's work.\n\n\n\n"}

As a founding member and lead singer of the punk rock band Bratmobile, she became one of the leading voices of the riot grrl movement.\n\nWolfe has also fronted other bands, including Sex Stains, Partyline, and Cold Cold Hearts. She was one of the principal creators of the original Ladyfest music festival in 2000. She has more recently been the creator and host of the punk rock interview podcast \"I'm In The Band\".\n\nAllison Wolfe and her sister Cindy were born identical twins in Memphis, Tennessee, on November 9, 1969. Together with their sister Molly, they grew up in Olympia, Washington. Their parents divorced when they were all still young children, and they were raised by their mother, Pat Shively. A radical feminist and self-described lesbian, Shively founded Olympia's Eastside Women's Health Clinic in 1981. It was the first women's clinic in Thurston County, and throughout Shively's two decades of work it was the target of relentless anti-abortion demonstrations. The protests could be harrowing: Wolfe's mother endured verbal and physical abuse, and death threats forced her to go to the clinic armed and wearing a bulletproof vest. (The EWHC was razed in a fire in 2005, set by a still-unidentified arsonist.) Pat Shively died of ovarian cancer in February, 2000, and Wolfe credits her as being a lifelong influence, a feminist role model \"almost too big to live up to.\"\n\nIn 1988, Wolfe spent time as an exchange student in Thailand's Krathum Baen District. She returned to attend Evergreen State College in Olympia, and later the University of Oregon at Eugene.\n\nWolfe and Molly Neuman wrote about rock music's pervasive sexism in their influential punkzine, \"Girl Germs\". They took those themes to music when they joined with guitarist Erin Smith to form their own band, Bratmobile, in 1991. Maura Johnston later wrote in \"Rolling Stone\" that Wolfe's distinctive \"disaffected drawl\" became \"one of the most prominent voices of the early-Nineties riot grrrl movement\".\n\nBratmobile recorded for Kill Rock Stars, an Olympia-based independent label, and released their first full-length album, \"Pottymouth\", in 1992. The band ended in a rancorous onstage breakup in New York City in 1994.\n\nWolfe and Smith eventually reunited to form Cold Cold Hearts with an expanded rhythm section provided by drummer Katherine Brown and bassist Natalie Mencinsky (\"Nattles\"). The band toured extensively and released one self-titled album in 1997.\n\nWolfe later sang with Deep Lust, her first band with male musicians which she lightheartedly describes as \"my boy band\". Deep Lust formed in early 1999; they toured and released one self-titled album on Kill Rock Stars in February 2000.\n\nBratmobile reformed in 1999 and went on tour with Sleater Kinney. The reunited band released two more albums, \"Ladies, Women and Girls\" (2000) and \"Girls Get Busy\" (2002).\n\nWolfe started a Washington D.C. based band, Partyline, in 2004. The band released two full-length albums, \"Girls With Glasses\" (2005) and \"Zombie Terrorist\" (2006).\n\nSex Stains formed in Los Angeles in 2014. The five-person group was the largest outfit Wolfe had worked with yet, and the first in which she had a companion vocalist, Mecca Vazie Andrews. The band released their eponymous debut album on Don Giovanni Records in 2016.\n\nAfter some personnel changes in 2017, the group was recast as Ex Stains, which performed shows with Wolfe on lead vocals until disbanding in mid-2018.\n\nWolfe has also performed and recorded with various other bands including Alice Bag, Cool Moms, Dig Yr Grave, Hawnay Troof and its offshoot, Baby Truth.\n\nWolfe was one of the primary architects behind the original Ladyfest music festival in Olympia, Washington, in 2000. In later years, Ladyfest festivals have taken place throughout the world and Wolfe has appeared at many of them.\n\nWolfe holds a master's degree in arts journalism from the University of Southern California. In the 2000s she worked for the \"Washington Post\", and edited the punk rock-themed manga series \"Nana\", refashioning its basic English translation into modern vernacular. Since 2017 she has hosted \"I'm In The Band\", a podcast on Tidal in which she interviews artists from the punk and indie rock scenes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

This weather effect occurs from once to several times a year, mostly in summer, but sometimes in winter. The resulting wind typically creates large sandstorms that impact Iraq, most sand having been picked up from Jordan and Syria.\n\nWhen a passing storm with a strong cold front passes over the mountains of Turkey, the leading edge of a mass of relatively cooler air kicks up dust and sand, sending it aloft. Temperatures at lower elevations still hover above 42°C (105°F) during these events.\n\nIn Iran, where winter storms can bring heavy snow to the terrain, a layer of dust can settle onto the snowpack.\n\nA winter shamal is associated with the strengthening of a high-pressure area over the peninsula after the passage of a cold front while a deep trough of low pressure maintains itself over areas east of the Persian Gulf. This leads to strong northerly wind over the Persian Gulf for periods up to five days. They are associated with cold temperatures.\n\nThe places around the Middle East most likely to see the winter variety lie near Lavan Island, Halul Island, and Ras Rakan. They persist from 24–36 hours during the winter and occur as frequently as two to three times per month in December–February. A persistent three- to five-day event occurs only once or twice a winter, and is accompanied by very high winds and seas.\n\nShamals normally last three to five days. The dust- and sandstorm is several thousand feet deep. Wind speeds can reach up to 70 km/h. Such events can impact health and transport, as visibility becomes limited, and some flights get cancelled. Sand dunes build up on roads and require considerable effort to remove. Some infrastructure, such as street signs, become damaged by the shamals.\n\nA study by Hokkaido University on fossil corals in Oman provides an evidence that prolonged winter shamal seasons around 2200 BCE led to the salinization of the irrigated fields; hence, a dramatic decrease in crop production triggered a widespread famine and eventually the collapse of the ancient Akkadian Empire.\n\nSome investigations have also reported that dust storms generated over west Asian regions during summer can alter regional circulation features, even affecting the Indian summer monsoon rainfall.\n\nA notable storm caused by a shamal covered Baghdad with sand on 8 August 2005, resulting in a closing of nearly all shops and public activity. The storm also overwhelmed Baghdad's Yarmuk Hospital, which treated more than a thousand people with respiratory distress.\nFrom 1–4 February 2008, a massive dust storm was associated with a shamal wind advected over the Arabian Sea. The leading edge of the dust storm moved at an estimated 20 km/h, and at one point extended from Muqdisho, Somalia, to Mumbai, India. Dust from this storm received press from the sports media as it swept across the Dubai Desert Classic golf tournament, where Tiger Woods was playing.\n\n\n\n"}

It consists of a small junior school and a larger senior school, which operate from different buildings on the same site. It is a member of the Girls' Schools Association and the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference.\n\nThe school was founded in 1710 with an endowment from Lady Eleanor Holles, the daughter of John Holles, 2nd Earl of Clare. The original site is commemorated by a plaque on one of the Barbican walkways.\n\nIn 1878, the middle school moved to a new building at 182 Mare Street in East Hackney, which was later owned by the Cordwainers Company and now forms part of the London College of Fashion.\n\nIn 1937 the school moved to its permanent site in Hampton. The first buildings in Hampton were designed by Colonel F.S. Hammond, whose father had designed the Hackney school and were opened by Princess Alice, Duchess of Gloucester.\n\nThe school celebrated its 300th anniversary with a thanksgiving service at St Paul's Cathedral, London on 18 November 2011, then a eucharist at Trinity College, Cambridge and a ball at The Hurlingham Club in May 2012.\n\nPupils come from a wide catchment area extending as far as Ealing, Woking, Wimbledon and Ascot, and there is an extensive coach service running over 23 routes operated jointly with Hampton School as the area is not well served with public transport. Around two-thirds come from white British backgrounds; the rest from a mix of ethnic backgrounds. It is not affiliated with any other school or foundation and operates as an independent registered charity and limited company overseen by a board of governors.\n\nThe Independent Schools Inspectorate Integrated report in 2013 said \"It aims to develop well-rounded individuals while striving for academic excellence.\"\n\nThe school's facilities include the Millennium Boat House on the Thames which is jointly owned with the adjacent Hampton School. The arts centre with 330-seat theatre designed by Walters & Cohen and completed in 2013 won a RIBA London Award in 2014.\n\nThe 'Student Gateway', designed by Scott Brownrigg, was completed in 2018, linking the sports hall and swimming pool to the main building, and includes computing and product design suites, enlarged sports changing rooms, a viewing gallery for the swimming pool, an activity studio and an ergometer (rowing machine) room.\n\nThe curriculum is based on the National Curriculum. Girls typically study ten GCSE subjects, including English language and literature, Mathematics and the Sciences, with the other 6 being chosen from 16 options, subject to various constraints (e.g. at least one humanities subject must be chosen). They then go on to study 4 A-Level subjects chosen from 23 courses plus an Extended Project Qualification.\n\nThe 2013 ISI report said \"around 30 pupils represent their country in sport, with numerous successes at national level for rowing, lacrosse, netball and swimming.\" In 2017 the figure was 29 girls, covering Gymnastics, Swimming, Acrobatics, Rowing, Hockey and Lacrosse. The school won the National Schools Lacrosse Under 19A Championship in 2018, and has been county champion for 11 years in a row. It held the National Schools Regatta (rowing) course record for Championship Girls Eights from 1994 until 2017 (when it was broken by both Headington and Henley).\n\nOther activities including CCF, Young Enterprise, The Duke of Edinburgh's Award, Model United Nations, Service Volunteers are run jointly with Hampton School.\n\nThere are 5 choirs and over 20 musical ensembles and bands in the senior school. Lessons are available in 24 instruments, and there is a dedicated recording studio.

Dodd Memorial Stadium is a stadium in Norwich, Connecticut. It is primarily used for baseball, and since 2010, has been the home of the Norwich Sea Unicorns of the New York–Penn League, who were previously known as the Connecticut Tigers. It was the home field of the Connecticut Defenders (previously known as the Norwich Navigators) minor league baseball team until 2009 when the Defenders announced their move to Richmond, Virginia to become known as the Richmond Flying Squirrels. It was built in 1995 and has a seating capacity of 6,270. It is named for Eastern Connecticut native Thomas Dodd who was a United States Senator and Representative from Connecticut, and the father of U.S. Senator Christopher Dodd.\n\nThe stadium is sunk into the surrounding ground, so that all fans enter at street level and walk down to get to their seats. Each section has 22-25 rows of seating, split into box seats (closest to field) and reserved seats. Beyond first and third bases, there is a third category of general-admission seats making up the top 10 rows. A wide concourse runs around the top of the seating area, with concession stands, restrooms, and a gift shop. The press box is also located at concourse level, overlooking the field. Other than behind the press box, fans can continue to watch the game while standing in line or while walking around the stadium.\n\nThere are 18 skyboxes, elevated above the concourse and accessible by stairs or elevator for ticket-holders only. The skyboxes and their outdoor seating serve as cover for the main concourse below, and for the top couple rows of reserved seats.\n\nDown the left- and right-field lines are grassy berms which are popular with children because they abut the bullpens. These are also frequent landing places for foul balls. The left-field side also features a large covered picnic area which can be rented out, and a kids' play area with inflatable slides. One room off the concourse has been made into a video arcade.\n\nThe stadium is located in the Norwich Business Park, and the parking fee is $3. Season ticket holders park on a paved lot on the first-base side of the stadium; all other parking is in a large gravel area.\n\nDodd Stadium hosted the 12th and final Double-A All-Star Game on July 10, 2002, in front of a standing-room-only crowd of 8,009. The three Double-A leagues began holding their own separate All-Star Games starting in 2003, with Dodd Stadium hosting the Eastern League game once again on July 11, 2007. (That game was ultimately canceled in the 3rd inning due to excessive fog.) The facility has also been the site of the New England Collegiate All-Star Game; the Big East Conference Baseball Tournament; several concerts including the Beach Boys, Willie Nelson, Bob Dylan, and Clint Black/Dwight Yoakam; and a TNA Wrestling event. During the fall of 2006, the stadium was used as the setting for the ESPN miniseries \"The Bronx Is Burning\", based on a Jonathan Mahler book of the same name.\n\nFrom 2002 to 2004, the stadium hosted the Atlantic 10 Conference Baseball Tournament. The event was won by George Washington in 2002, Richmond in 2003, and St. Bonaventure in 2004. It also has hosted the Northeast Conference Baseball Tournament since 2014 along with the 2011 and 2012 seasons.\n\nThe Connecticut Huskies baseball team holds some home games at Dodd Stadium, including four in 2012. As part of the 2010 NCAA Division I Baseball Tournament, the Huskies hosted an NCAA Regional at Dodd Stadium.\n\n"}

(née Didier) Davis. He and his family moved to Topeka, Kansas, and afterwards to Flagstaff, Arizona. He studied at St. Patrick's Seminary in Menlo Park, California, and was ordained to the priesthood on May 19, 1929. He served as chancellor of the Diocese of Tucson from 1930 to 1932.\n\nOn July 3, 1943, Davis was appointed Bishop of San Juan in Puerto Rico by Pope Pius XII. He received his episcopal consecration on the following October 6 from Bishop Daniel James Gercke, with Bishops Thomas Arthur Connolly and Joseph Thomas McGucken serving as co-consecrators. In 1958, he estimated that 90 percent of Puerto Ricans were nominally Catholics, while only 30 percent practiced their faith. A strong opponent of Luis Muñoz Marín, Davis once declared he \"will never climb the steps of the Fortaleza as long as Luis Muñoz Marín is Governor of Puerto Rico.\" In 1960, he and two other bishops issued a pastoral letter that prohibited Catholics from voting for Muñoz Marín's Popular Democratic Party. However, he later said there would be no punishment for Catholics who violated this order.\n\nHe was promoted to the first Archbishop of San Juan, Puerto Rico April 30, 1960. In 1963, Davis' predecessor in the see of San Juan, Edwin Byrne, died while serving as Archbishop of Santa Fe. In 1964, Pope Paul VI transferred Davis into Byrne's former position again, appointing him to be the ninth Archbishop of Santa Fe, New Mexico.\n\nFive years before reaching the mandatory age of retirement for a bishop according to canon law, he retired as Archbishop of Santa Fe in 1974. He died in Phoenix, Arizona, in 1988.\n\n"}

The addition of Major League Baseball teams in Phoenix, Arizona, and St. Petersburg, Florida, in 1998 also created room for Minor League Baseball to expand. Two additional teams were added to the Eastern League for the 1999 season: the Altoona Curve and the Erie SeaWolves. The city of Altoona won the favor of the Eastern League over a bid from Springfield, Massachusetts. The stadium hosted its first regular season baseball game on April 15, 1999, as the Curve defeated the Bowie Baysox, 6–1.\n\nFrom 1999 to 2002, total seating capacity was listed at 6,176.

It is often used to monitor the variables data but the performance of the formula_3 and R chart may suffer when the normality assumption is not valid. This is connected traditional statistical quality control (SQC) and statistical process control (SPC). However, Woodall noted that \"I believe that the use of control charts and other monitoring methods should be referred to as “statistical process monitoring,” not “statistical process control (SPC).”\"\n\nThe chart is advantageous in the following situations:\n\n\nThe \"chart\" actually consists of a pair of charts: One to monitor the process standard deviation (as approximated by the sample moving range) and another to monitor the process mean, as is done with the formula_5 and s and individuals control charts. The formula_5 and R chart plots the mean value for the quality characteristic across all units in the sample, formula_8, plus the range of the quality characteristic across all units in the sample as follows:\n\nThe normal distribution is the basis for the charts and requires the following assumptions:\n\n\nThe control limits for this chart type are:\n\n\nAs with the formula_5 and s and individuals control charts, the formula_5 chart is only valid if the within-sample variability is constant. Thus, the R chart is examined before the formula_5 chart; if the R chart indicates the sample variability is in statistical control, then the formula_5 chart is examined to determine if the sample mean is also in statistical control. If on the other hand, the sample variability is \"not\" in statistical control, then the entire process is judged to be not in statistical control regardless of what the formula_5 chart indicates.\n\nFor monitoring mean and variance of normal distribution, the combination of formula_19 S chart is usually better than that of formula_19and R chart. \n\nMoreover, changes in mean affect R or S chart and changes in standard deviation affects formula_19chart. Noting this, several authors recommend using a single chart that can simultaneously monitor formula_22and S. \n"}

She was well known for her prints which epitomised the 1960s/70s. After a period away from the limelight, she returned to fashion in the early 21st century.\n\nThe eldest daughter of a culture-loving engineer and a seamstress, Birtwell was born in Bury and raised in Prestwich, both then in Lancashire. From the age of 13 she studied textile design at the Royal Technical College, Salford. In an interview for BBC television's \"Inside Out North West\" in January 2014, Birtwell remembered attending parties and life classes with nude models on the top floor of the Technical College (pictured) and often seeing artist L.S. Lowry, a former student who often visited the college and the adjacent Salford Library. In 1959 she met the fashion designer Ossie Clark in the Cona Coffee Bar in Manchester, and they married in 1969 after being reintroduced when they both studied in London.\n\nCelia Birtwell and Ossie Clark's was an almost perfect marriage of style, and their work together helped define the era. The collaboration began with a 1966 collection for the \"Quorum\" boutique in London, which they shared with the designer Alice Pollock. It was the Clarks who began the modern catwalk show: the previous procession of modelled clothes was put to music, the London glitterati were invited, and the shows became events.\n\nHe was a genius, better than Yves Saint Laurent. His cut – although he lifted it from the 1930s, he had his own take on it – even plump women felt pretty in. He didn't dress just the slimmest, which is always easier. I thought his garments were wonderful. I used to see [their] construction and the way he'd get excited about how he'd put a new sleeve in. He was a real artist.\n\nBirtwell worked at home designing textiles for Clark, who would use his skill in cutting and understanding of form, together with her knowledge of fabrics and textures to produce haute couture for the 1960s culture. This included work for the Rolling Stones and Beatles, Jimi Hendrix and Pink Floyd, as well as Pattie Boyd, Marianne Faithfull, Bianca Jagger, Verushka, Paloma Picasso, Talitha Getty and numerous other celebrities.\n\nCelia and Ossie had two children together, Albert (born 1969) and George (born 1971), but their private relationship deteriorated and they divorced in 1974.\n\nShe has been a muse for the painter David Hockney since 1968, and features in many of his paintings including \"Mr and Mrs Clark and Percy\" (1970–71), one of Hockney's most celebrated and one of the most viewed paintings in the Tate Britain gallery. In 2005, it featured on the \"Today\" programme's shortlist of the \"Greatest Painting in Britain\". She also appears in the 1974 Hockney biopic, \"A Bigger Splash\".\n\nAfter the break-up of her marriage, Birtwell continued in fashion, designing for the Radley label for a time, until in 1984 she set up a shop on Westbourne Park Road in Bayswater, selling fabrics for the home. Again she built up a reputation for innovative and witty design. Her first success came with her own take on a 16th-century animal print she called 'Animal Solo', followed later by the first, and much copied, white on white voile and muslin fabrics. These fabrics are now to be seen in many homes, hotels and public spaces, including Claridge's and The Lanesborough hotels in London, The Grand Hotel, Leeds, and the Dubai Hilton.\n\nBirtwell produced designs for French fashion house Cacharel while it was under the design direction of Suzanne Clements and Inacio Ribeiro. In 2005, it was announced that she would design clothing for the high street chain Topshop, beginning with Spring/Summer 2006. The four collections were a sell-out success. In April 2008, Birthwell designed a limited collection for American fashion retailer Express. In 2008, Millets launched a camping and outdoor footwear and clothing range which she had designed. New lines were added to the range for Summer 2009. In 2010, she created a 25-piece collection for John Lewis.\n\nHer book \"Celia Birtwell\", written with Dominic Lutyens, featuring photographs, fashion sketches and memoir, was published by Quadrille in 2011. 250 limited edition fabric covered box sets which included a signed copy of her book, and an exclusive silk scarf, were also produced.\n\nBirtwell was the castaway on \"Desert Island Discs\" on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday 7 October 2012.\n\nShe was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2011 Birthday Honours.\n\n"}

It hosted its first regular season game on June 20, 1995, in which major league veteran José Guillén hit a home run to ensure a SeaWolves victory over the Jamestown Jammers.\n\nThe park replaced Ainsworth Field, which was built in 1947, and features natural grass and dirt playing field. Its concessions include regional specialties such as pepperoni balls, ox roast sandwiches, cheesesteaks, and Yuengling beer. It is part of the Louis J. Tullio Plaza, which also includes Erie Insurance Arena and the Warner Theatre, all governed by the Erie County Convention Center Authority. The stadium has a seating capacity of 6,000. After the 2016 season, the SeaWolves partnered with the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) in a naming rights agreement to rebrand the stadium UPMC Park.\n\nIn a 2008, the ESPN sports broadcast company ranked the ballpark number five out of ten minor league ballpark seating arrangements. They especially noted its unique mezzanine level that overlooks the infield along the first base side. In July 2015, the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) also ranked the stadium number five among the most vegetarian-friendly minor league ballparks.\n\nPrior to UPMC Park's construction, the Erie SeaWolves (then known as the Welland Pirates) played at Welland Stadium in Welland, Ontario. They moved to Erie after owner Marvin Goldklang relocated the Erie Sailors to Wappingers Falls, New York (where they became the Hudson Valley Renegades) because he did not want to upgrade Ainsworth Field to the standards Major League Baseball required of its affiliated clubs. Once the civic government secured an $8 million grant from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania to build UPMC Park, the Welland Pirates moved to Erie. The remaining $1 million for architectural expenses were covered by the City of Erie, Erie County, and the 300-member Team Erie, each of whom contributed $300,000. Additionally, nearby Millcreek Township also contributed $25,000. The ballpark site was originally home to a Sears building turned Exhibit Hall. Groundbreaking ceremonies took place on July 27, 1994 and Jerry Uht Park was completed in May 1995.\n\nOn July 10, 2015, Jerry Uht Park hosted Global Force Wrestling's \"Grand Slam Tour\", its first major professional wrestling event.\n\nGerard T. \"Jerry\" Uht, Sr. was a minor league baseball player and longtime Erie resident. In 1995, he established a $500,000 endowment with PNC Bank and the Erie Community Foundation to perpetually support the downtown baseball stadium. In response to his generosity, the city named Jerry Uht Park in his honor. As of January 2007, the Erie Community Foundation continues to manage the fund, valued at $750,000. The \"Erie Times-News\" indicated that the fund is designated for stadium maintenance expenses and equipment purchases. The name remained in use until a naming rights agreement with the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) after the 2016 season resulted in a name change to \"UPMC Park.\"\n\nSeating along UPMC Park's first and third base lines has a unique configuration due to the space constraints of an urban construction. There are three main concession stands and a picnic area for fans, plus six luxury suites for special occasions. The ballpark is known for its two distinctive grandstands, each with its own design.\n\nIn 2006, the park was renovated at a cost of $4 million. Additions included a new electronic scoreboard (which has a nautical theme featuring \"Erie\" spelled out with international maritime signal flags), a two-tiered picnic area, eleven luxury box seats, and new concession stands. An additional videoboard was added to Erie Insurance Arena, which borders the stadium, that displays scores from other Eastern League games, player statistics, and information about the Detroit Tigers. UPMC Park's batting zone resembles that of Comerica Park in Detroit, exaggerating the contour of the regulation home plate.\n\nIn spring 2012, a new wall was constructed along the park's border with Erie Insurance Arena. The \"Erie Times-News\" dubbed it \"the Gray Monster,\" an allusion to Fenway Park's Green Monster in Boston. Despite the wall's height, the home-run marker was maintained at . Its construction was part of the $42 million renovation of Erie Insurance Arena, which lies a mere from the left-field boundary. Additionally, the left-field pole was moved from its original from home-plate to and the batting cages were relocated from left-field to right-center, near the scoreboard.\n\nOn August 13, 2018, Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf announced UPMC Park would receive Redevelopment Capital Assistance Program funding totaling $12 million for upgrades to UPMC Park. Enhancements are expected to include updated video boards, renovated suite, concession and restroom areas, and a new left field stadium entrance featuring a climate-controlled team store and stadium club.\n\nHappy Howler, LLC, manages the concessions at UPMC Park, offering a typical ballpark menu of hot dogs, hamburgers, nachos, and peanuts. Some regional specialties include Erie-made pepperoni balls, ox roast sandwiches, and cheesesteaks. The most distinctive concession is the Smith's Sausage Shack, which grills German bratwurst, Italian sausage, Polish kiełbasa, and Cajun sausage along with the Pennsylvania-brewed Yuengling beer. Options for health-conscious, vegetarian, and vegan customers include veggie burgers and burrito bowls. Pepsi has exclusive pouring rights at UPMC Park for soft drinks. In 2017, the Mojo & AC Rocket Dog, a Smith's hot dog topped with pulled pork, mac & cheese, bacon and BBQ sauce, was named the top food item in Minor League Baseball's BUSH's Home Run Recipes Contest. The SeaWolves organization repeated as champions in 2018 with their Fiesta Burger, topped with pepper jack cheese, bacon, guacamole, onion strings and Bush's Black Beans. Also during 2018, the facility offered a hot dog topped with Nerds candy in a cotton candy bun. This outrageous item earned national recognition and notoriety for the SeaWolves organization.\n\n"}

It is the home field of the Harrisburg Senators, the Double-A minor league affiliate of the Washington Nationals, and was the home stadium of Penn FC of the USL. The original structure was built in 1987 and it was called Riverside Stadium until 2004. Currently, the ballpark has a capacity of 6,187 people. The ballpark received a $45 million renovation that began in 2008.\n\nFNB Field sits on the exact spot where baseball had been played earlier in the century, where other Harrisburg teams played from 1907 to 1952. The location, City Island, is a 62-acre waterfront park and sports complex. The facilities include volleyball courts, softball fields, a football/soccer field, water golf, nature tails, jogging paths, cycling paths, two marinas, the \"Pride of the Susquehanna\" paddlewheel riverboat, a food court called RiverSide Village, and a miniature train that runs around the island for tours.\n\nThe original ballpark is a steel and aluminum structure, and over the course of time, additional seating areas were built along first base, and box seats in foul territory and in front of the grandstands behind home plate to provide additional seating, despite official capacity being listed at over 6,000 since the park's inception. The stadium was used as the spring training facility in the movie \"Major League II\", starring Charlie Sheen, Tom Berenger and Corbin Bernsen.\n\nFNB Field received a $45 million renovation ($18 million in city funding). Originally the renovation was scheduled to begin in 2005. However, problems with the availability of state funding for the project pushed it back to 2008, with the transfer of ownership between the 2007 and 2008 seasons. The renovation project was finished in two phases, with the first phase being completed before Opening Day 2009. The second phase of the project began in August 2009 and was completed prior to Opening Day 2010.\n\nThe construction for the first phase of the project began in January 2009 and continued into April 2009. The changes and additions to FNB Field for the 2009 season were:\n\nA public plaza and entrance was constructed in the left field corner; a boardwalk surrounding the outfield was constructed between the foul poles; a complete upgrade to the scoreboard; a new left field seating area; an outfield bar complete with drink rails; and new seating underneath the scoreboard; a new outfield wall constructed with static advertisement panels; and a new Operations Building which houses the Senators front offices, ranger, security, first aid and the new box office along with the new Senators souvenir store, concession stand, and public rest rooms.\n\nThe second phase of the construction project began in August 2009. This project included the comprehensive changes to FNB Field that turned the stadium on City Island into one of the best and most unusual ballparks in minor league baseball. The following is a comprehensive list of the renovation project:\n\nThe total construction costs for the project were $32 million and the total development budget for the entire project, including all costs, was approximately $45 million. Prior to the 2005 season, a new playing surface was installed which is also a part of the $45 million total project cost.\n\nIn the 2008 off-season, the renovation of the stadium bagan, with $500,000 in funding going towards a new public plaza, and other small amenities to be built into the stadium. In the 2009 offseason, the rest of the stadium was renovated.\n\nThe ballpark's original dimensions were fairly basic. The walls at the left and right field lines were from home plate, and the center field wall was from home plate, with the outfield wall pretty much the same setup that multi-purpose stadiums had in the 1980s (though FNB Field itself is not a multi-purpose stadium), with no extra bends or such in the wall, and the height of the wall at . Billboards also ran around by the walls, and reached a height of . Anything that hit the billboards was a home run. With the renovation of the park, and the addition of the boardwalk, some of the distances have changed, with left and right field now 325 feet from home plate. Center field's distance has stayed the same at 400 feet; however walls, unlike at left and right field, were raised to 16 feet instead of the original 8 feet, and the walls have extra bends that did not exist in the previous setup, predominantly in left center and right center field.\n\nFoul territory also currently varies, because there is a small amount of foul ground behind home plate. However, the further out toward the outfield, the wall on the foul ground stays somewhat parallel to the foul line in both left and right field, with only the box seats sticking out into foul ground helping to reduce the area somewhat. This was expected to change when the main grandstands are renovated in the 2009–2010 off-season. The bullpens were also located out in the foul territory by the outfield walls. While the visiting team's bullpen has stayed in the same place for the 2009 season, and is expected to be in the same general area for the 2010 season, the Senators moved their bullpen to a location behind the right field wall halfway through the season.\n\n\n"}

The wooden bench seating in the main grandstand was replaced by individual seats, and a roof was erected to cover 1,500 of those seats. The press box was also expanded as a part of the project, which cost more than $500,000.\n\nThe third base picnic area was built between the 1989 and 1990 season at a cost of $125,000.

He was the son of James Watson Webb (1802–1884), a United States Minister to Brazil, and his father's second wife, Laura Virginia Cram (1826–1890). Among his siblings was brother Dr. William Seward Webb, who was married to Eliza Osgood Vanderbilt; and Alexander Steward Webb, the longstanding President of City College of New York.\n\nWebb was head of his class in the Columbia College School of Mines (now incorporated into the School of Engineering and Applied Science). He was a member of the fraternity St. Anthony Hall and while still an undergraduate, he participated in the Orton expedition that ascended the Amazon River almost to its source, and crossing the Andes, he exited South America by way of Peru, returning to the USA by ship. He then studied law, also at Columbia, and passed the bar in 1875.\n\nAfter briefly practiced law, which he found unsatisfying, he soon thereafter became active in Wall Street banking and brokerage. He drifted into the railway business almost by accident through his brother, Dr. William Seward Webb, who married Eliza Vanderbilt, a daughter of William H. Vanderbilt, and became interested in the Wagner Palace Car Company which the Vanderbilts controlled. When Webster Wagner, the company's president was suddenly crushed between two of his own cars in 1882, Dr. Webb became president of the company and invited his brother to join it.\n\nWebb was an advocate of fast railway travel and ran what was then the fastest railway train in the world, averaging nearly 60 miles per hour over 450 miles. In 1893 he made a bold and ultimately true prediction for the next hundred years: \"By 1993, a traveler will be able to have his breakfast in New York City and his evening meal in Chicago.\"\n\nWebb lived in Scarborough, New York, was Show Chairman of the Westminster Kennel Club (1880–1882), subscriber to the Blackstone Memorial (1891), and helped dedicate a bronze statue of Christopher Columbus in Central Park (1894).\n\nH.

The ballpark sat with home plate in roughly the north-northwest corner of the property. The former boundaries of the park were Interstate 630 (south, right field); Jonesboro Drive (west, right field corner); South Monroe Street (west, first base stands); buildings on driveway extended from Ray Winder Drive (north, third base stands); buildings bordering South Palm Street (east, right field). The field was in operation for around 74 years.\n\nThe ballpark was constructed during 1931, as a new home field for the Little Rock Travelers, later to become the Arkansas Travelers, minor league baseball team. The Travelers vacated Kavanaugh Field, near Little Rock Central High School, and opened their 1932 season on April 13 at the newly completed ballpark, which was initially called Travelers Field for the team name.\n\nOn August 26, 1966, Travelers Field was renamed Ray Winder Field, after Raymond Winder, who was involved with the business end of The Travelers for some sixty years. Winder started as a ticket seller in 1915, was named as the Arkansas Traveler business manager in 1931, and became part owner in 1944. The Traveler franchise was moved to Shreveport following the 1958 season, leaving Little Rock without a baseball club for the first time since 1914. Traveler Field sat empty during the 1959 season while efforts continued to return minor league baseball to Little Rock. After a public stock drive raised funds to purchase a bankrupt New Orleans franchise, the Travelers were resurrected in Little Rock for the 1960 season. Ray Winder was again asked to manage the day to day details of rebuilding the club.\n\nIn 1976, Bill Valentine, a former American League umpire, was chosen as general manager for the Travelers. Valentine was general manager until 2007, 31 years. He remained executive vice president for two more seasons, before retiring in March 2009.\n\nFaced with an aging ballpark and limited funds, Valentine began to promote the historic nature of Ray Winder Field. Through his efforts the ballpark gained recognition as one of the oldest active parks in minor league baseball, and he encouraged fans traveled to Little Rock to experience the nostalgia and sample the baseball history represented by Ray Winder Field. He promoted the home of the Arkansas Travelers as \"A great place to see old-time baseball, wholesome entertainment aimed squarely at the family market.\"\n\nIn 2005, construction began on a new ballpark in North Little Rock which would eventually become the home of the Arkansas Travelers. On September 3, 2006, the final game of the 2006 season, a capacity crowd filled Ray Winder Field as fans returned for the last Traveler game at Ray Winder Field. During this game, the Travelers beat the Springfield Cardinals by a score of 7-3. Beginning with the 2007 season, the Arkansas Travelers home ballpark is Dickey-Stephens Park in North Little Rock.\n\nRay Winder Field sat vacant for almost five years while forces outside of organized baseball determined the future of this historic ballpark. Many recognized the ballpark as a historic structure both for the City of Little Rock and for baseball, and it was proposed that the park be restored as a functional baseball field for city and college teams as had been done with Rickwood Field in Birmingham, Alabama . Others proposed demolishing the historic ballpark in order to utilize the area as a parking lot for the nearby University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences. The Arkansas Zoological Foundation wanted the Little Rock Zoo to expand into Ray Winder by refitting the grandstand as a viewing area for an Asian elephant exhibit. During all of these discussions, the underlying atmosphere from the City of Little Rock was one of disinterest and apathy, with no apparent recognition of the park's historic ties to baseball's golden era, and no interest in assisting in the landmark ballpark's preservation.\n\nUltimately, the decision was made to sell the park to the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, with all structures to be razed and the land cleared for use as a parking lot. The City of Little Rock again confirmed that they had no interest preserving the park. Several sales were held to disperse remaining artifacts to baseball fans from across the country who had visited this ballpark, and on May 14, 2011, the park was opened for a final time when the remaining wooden seats, dating to 1932, were dismantled and given to fans on a first-come, first-served basis.\n\nOn July 12, 2012 the score board and the light poles were left standing while the rest of the park and all other structure were torn down and removed, and the ground paved over. It had also been hotly debated to allow the Little Rock Zoo to use the site for expansion and improvements for the betterment of the animals and visitors.\n\nAs of March 9, 2018 the score board and light poles still remain.\n\n"}

Lawrence, former Wichita mayor (1929,1930,1933,1934) who died on September 20, 1934, after convincing the city to move the stadium and rebuild within the city limits at a location that was known as \"Payne's Pasture\" (owned by Charles Payne). The construction of the stadium was a Works Progress Administration (WPA) project during the Great Depression. The new stadium was named Lawrence Stadium in honor of the former mayor.\n\nRay \"Hap\" Dumont had promised to hold semi-pro games in the new ballpark. He paid Satchel Paige $1,000 to bring the Bismarck Churchills to the stadium to play in the first National Baseball Congress Championship.\n\nIn 1949, the ballpark was the last to host the College World Series before Omaha, Nebraska became its permanent address the following year.\n\nIn 1978, it was renamed to Lawrence-Dumont Stadium, adding the last name of Raymond \"Hap\" Dumont, who was a sports writer for \"The Wichita Eagle-Beacon\", sports editor for the Hutchinson News, founder of the National Baseball Congress in 1935, and was instrumental in building Lawrence Stadium in Wichita.\n\nThe stadium underwent renovations in 2001 which brought improvements to the stadium sound system, new infield turf, a new outfield fence with tables behind it, and fresh paint to the seating area. \n\nThe stadium was again renovated in 2011. It was one of the few stadiums in the world that features a natural grass outfield with an AstroTurf infield. This would change during the April 2011 renovation when the entire field (including the grass outfield) would be replaced with RamTurf. Other changes included all new lights, exterior cosmetic improvements, new infield turf, dugout expansion, and improvements to the concourse areas.\n\nIt was home to the Wichita Wranglers minor league baseball team. The Wranglers left Wichita at the end of the 2007 season and moved to Springdale, Arkansas, where the team was renamed the Northwest Arkansas Naturals. The Wichita Wingnuts of the independent American Association most recently played at Lawrence-Dumont.\n\n\n"}

Plaza de Cibeles was originally named Plaza de Madrid, but in 1900, the City Council named it Plaza de Castelar, which was eventually replaced by its current name.\n\nIt is currently delimited by four prominent buildings: the Bank of Spain Building, the Palacio de Buenavista, the Palace of Linares (\"Palacio de Linares\"), and the Cybele Palace (\"Palacio de Cibeles\"). These constructions are located in four different neighbourhoods from three different adjacent districts: Centro, Retiro, and Salamanca.\n\nOver the years, Cybele Palace and her fountain have become symbolic monuments of the city.\n\nThe fountain of Cybele is found in the part of Madrid commonly called the Paseo de Recoletos. This fountain is named after Cybele, a Phrygian goddess. The fountain is traditionally the place where Real Madrid C.F. celebrate their team victories, with the team captain placing a Real Madrid flag and scarf on the statue.\n\nThe most prominent of the buildings at the Plaza de Cibeles is the Cybele Palace (formerly named Palace of Communication), which is the seat of the Madrid City Council.\n\n"}
{"id": "2268410", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2268410", "title": "Trainwreck (band)", "text": "Trainwreck (band)\n\nTrainwreck is an American southern and comedy rock band, formed in Los Angeles, California in 2002. It was founded by Tenacious D guitarist Kyle Gass and actor JR Reed.\n\nThe band originally started out as a three-piece, with Reed on vocals, Gass on guitar and friend Kevin Weisman as the drummer. The band adopted pseudonym names for its band members, Reed was \"Darryl Lee Donald\", Gass was \"Klip Calhoun\" and Weisman was \"Kenny Bob Thornton\". Gass and Reed began to search for backing musicians, as they felt Trainwreck's musical style was \"too close to Tenacious D\". The band met electric guitarist John Konesky and bassist John Spiker in Ohio through a mutual friend, with them relocating to Los Angeles to form Trainwreck as \"John Bartholomew Shredman\" and \"Boy Johnny\" respectively. Nate Rothacker replaced Weisman as the drummer in the mid-2000s, going under the pseudonym \"Dallas St. Bernard\".\n\nThe band released one studio album, one live album, one EP and a single before splitting up in 2010. The band would reform in 2018 and announce a reunion tour, as well as work on a second studio album.\n\nGass started the rock band Tenacious D along with Jack Black in 1994. Black became very popular in the turn of the new millennium with many film and TV roles which led for Black to not have as much time to spend playing gigs with Gass – so Gass created Trainwreck to keep him musically active when Black was busy.\nIn December 2001, Tenacious D played a concert with Weezer and Jimmy Eat World in Value City Arena, where Kyle Gass befriended Erin Robinson, who described herself as a \"huge D fan.\" In 2002, Trainwreck was formed, but just as an occasional band with JR Reed on vocals, Kevin Weisman on drums and Gass as guitar. The group played their first concert at Highland Grounds in Los Angeles on 2 August 2002. In 2003, Gass asked Erin Robinson to recruit electric backing musicians for the \"Trainwreck side project\" so she found bassist John Spiker and electric guitarist John Konesky. At this point, Gass, Reed and Weisman also added Chris D'Arienzo as keyboard in addition. The band released their first single '2 Tracks' sometime in 2003 and their live album, Trainwreck Live, in 2004. Trainwreck made their first TV appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live in 2004 and featured on Current TV's 2005 Halloween special performing \"\"TV Theme\"\" as the musical guest.\n\nThe band self-released their first 5-song EP, \"\"The EP\"\" in 2006. Two songs from the EP (\"\"Caveman\"\" and \"\"I Wanna Know\"\") were used on the official soundtrack for \"Tenacious D in The Pick of Destiny\", and were later released on \"More Rocktastic Music From The Film\". Gass wears a Trainwreck T-shirt during the vast majority of the film, as well as appearing in it on posters. For the concert tour to support the movie and soundtrack, Konesky and Spiker were recruited to play guitar for the shows based on their work with Trainwreck. Rothacker worked as a band assistant. Because \"The Pick of Destiny Tour\" featured all the members of Trainwreck, Trainwreck played shows in the cities they were in on their days off. This is notable because the band performed at the Scala in England, the Annandale Hotel in Australia and the Mod Club Theater in Canada which were the band's first international dates. In late 2006, Black expressed wishes for 2007 to take a break from the entertainment industry, this meant for Trainwreck to tour during 2007, especially in the summer, to keep Gass musically active.\n\nIn September 2008, Trainwreck released their first music video \"\"Tim Blankenship\"\" directed by Nick Simon. The actual song itself would later feature on their 2009 debut album.\n\nThe band released their debut 15-track album on 2 December 2009 at The Roxy in Los Angeles. There was also a music video created in support for the album – \"\"Brodeo\"\". The band also released a music video for \"\"Baby, Let's Rock\"\" off of Trainwreck's 2003 \"\"2 Tracks\"\" single. The band went on a tour to support the new album throughout March and May in various cities of the United States. In June during Tenacious D's Bonnaroo Music Festival slot, Rothacker played for Tenacious D for the first time as he replaced Brooks Wackerman due to him being on tour with Bad Religion. Later on, in September, they began touring again after a short absence. The band played their last show on the 25th September 2010 at the Beat Kitchen in Chicago. This show was in the middle of their Transcontinental Railroad tour – the Chicago show was their tenth show into the tour, and due to \"unforeseen circumstances\" the band cancelled the remainder of their tour. After five months of in-activity, in March 2011, they announced their closure on their Facebook page as Gass, Konesky and Rothacker formed Kyle Gass Band.\n\nThe band reunited at a Wynchester show (which features Konesky) at the Maui Sugar Mill Saloon on the 2nd of February 2018, making a short on-stage appearance. This was due to both Gass and Reed being in attendance at the show, also Spiker performing with Wynchester as a guest. The drumming position in the band was filled with Wynchester's Matt Lesser, instead of Nate Rothacker. A couple of days after this, the band announced a show on their Facebook page at DiPiazza's in Long Beach, California for the 24th of February, opening for Kyle Gass Band. This show being a full-band reunion with Rothacker on drums. In April, the band posted a photo of themselves in a recording studio on their Facebook and Instagram pages. The band also announced a September tour – playing nine dates throughout California. A few dates after the announcement of the tour, the band revealed they were working on a second studio album.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2268427", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2268427", "title": "Dr Pepper Ballpark", "text": "Dr Pepper Ballpark\n\nDr Pepper Ballpark (formerly Dr Pepper/Seven Up Ballpark) is the home ballpark of the Frisco RoughRiders Minor League Baseball club which plays in the Double-A Texas League. Located in Frisco, Texas, in the United States, the stadium has a capacity of 10,316. The ballpark is host to numerous functions in addition to Minor League Baseball games, including corporate and charity events, wedding receptions, city of Frisco events, and church services. Local soft drink manufacturer Dr Pepper Snapple Group has held naming rights and exclusive non-alcoholic beverage rights in the park.\n\nSince its opening in 2003, the Dr Pepper Ballpark has won awards and garnered praise for its unique design, feel, and numerous facilities. In his design, park architect and 2015 Driehaus Prize winner David M. Schwarz desired the creation of a village-like \"park within a (ball) park\". Dr Pepper Ballpark received the 2003 Texas Construction award for Best Architectural Design and was named the best new ballpark in the country by BaseballParks.com.\n\nIn 2001, Mandalay Sports Entertainment, owner of the Shreveport SwampDragons Double-A baseball team, reached an agreement with Southwest Sports Group to move the team to Frisco for the 2003 baseball season. As part of the deal, Southwest Sports Group assumed part-ownership of both the team and the ballpark to be built following the 2002 season. The project, designed by David M. Schwarz Architectural Services and HKS Sports & Entertainment Group, broke ground on February 6, 2002.\n\nThe ballpark serves as the anchor for a $300 million development project near the intersection of State Highway 121 and the Dallas North Tollway. The project was jointly funded by the city of Frisco and Southwest Sports Group. Frisco put forth $67 million to build the complex, which was raised through special financing, unconnected to the city tax rate. On January 21, 2003, it was announced that local company Dr Pepper/Seven Up had purchased the naming rights for the new ballpark and retained exclusive non-alcoholic beverage rights for an undisclosed amount.\n\nThe ballpark opened for its first game on April 3, 2003, a RoughRiders loss to the Tulsa Drillers. The RoughRiders earned their first victory in the ballpark the next day, with the RoughRiders' Kurt Airoso hitting the park's first home run.\n\nDr Pepper/Seven Up Ballpark was renamed Dr Pepper Ballpark on March 31, 2006. On that date, the RoughRiders' major league affiliate, the Texas Rangers, defeated the Florida Marlins in an exhibition game played at Dr Pepper Ballpark. The sold-out game was the ballpark's first major league game of any kind. Overall attendance ranked in the top 10 in all classes of Minor League Baseball during the RoughRiders' first nine seasons. The stadium ranked first in all of Double-A for attendance from 2006 to 2011. Average attendance at RoughRiders games was around 8,000 during this stretch, but has since dropped to around 7,000 per game as of 2018. In August 2017, Dr Pepper Snapple Group declined to renew their naming rights to Dr Pepper Ballpark. The RoughRiders were unable to sell the naming rights to another company, and as of 2019 the stadium's name remained unchanged.\n\nAs baseball is not a year-round event, Dr Pepper Ballpark is used for other functions throughout the year. The ballpark hosts corporate events, such as company softball games and movie nights, in addition to local charity events, such as 5K runs and bike races. Since 2004, the park has hosted the \"Tournament of Champions\" high school baseball tournament. Dr Pepper Ballpark was selected to host the 2005, 2009, and 2017 Texas League All-Star Game. Since January 2006, Dr Pepper Ballpark has hosted the opening ceremonies of the annual TXU Energy Winter Games of Texas. The ballpark also hosts wedding receptions, the opening ceremonies for the Frisco Baseball and Softball Association, city of Frisco events, and church services.\n\nFollowing its construction in 2003, the Dr Pepper Ballpark received the Texas Construction award for Best Architectural Design for 2003 and the surrounding sports complex received the Best Sports and Entertainment award for 2003. It was named the best new ballpark in the country by BaseballParks.com. MinorLeagueNews.com has also named the park No. 2 on its top ten minor league ballparks for 2004 and No. 7 for 2005.\n\nThe design of the Dr Pepper Ballpark was spearheaded by David M. Schwarz. Schwarz had a stated goal of creating a \"park within a (ball)park\" in the stadium. To achieve this effect, the nine interconnected pavilions, where concessions, restrooms, and luxury suites are located, are built separately from the main seating area. The space between these pavilions allows for improved air flow in the Texas heat; the wind can move through the buildings and is not impeded by their presence. Constructed of James Hardie fiber cement siding, architectural critics have commented that their layout and material choice enhances the village-like feel of the ballpark, giving it a \"coastal Galveston aesthetic\". Others have commented that the design is very reminiscent of Churchill Downs in Kentucky.\n\nThe seating area is populated by just under 8,000 open-air fold-down stadium seats. Combined with general admission for standing room-only and grass berm seating, the stadium can hold a capacity crowd of over 10,000. The concourse area, between the pavilions and the seating area, wraps completely around the ballpark. Critics have commented positively on the 360-degree views afforded by this construction choice.\n\nIn addition to fixed stadium seats, the ballpark also features 26 luxury suites located on the second level of the ballpark, which feature patio balconies from which to view the game and closed-circuit television feeds of the game. Also unusual, the bullpens for each team are built into the stands behind the first and third base lines. This has received a mixed reaction from critics, with some calling it \"contrived\" and \"pointless\". In the outfield, seating is available on the grass area. This area is branded \"San Juan Hill\", after the Battle of San Juan Hill in which the team's namesake Rough Riders fought.\n\nOriginally the park featured a swimming pool built just past the wall in right field, level with the top of the outfield fence. Groups were able to rent out the pool during the game. In 2016, the pool was replaced by the Choctaw Lazy River. All ticketed guests have full 360-degree access to swim, wade, or float on the gently-flowing lazy river, which measures longer from end-to-end (almost ) than an Olympic-size swimming pool and nearly as long as a National Hockey League ice rink. A full lap around the Lazy River will take one over —the distance from home plate to the center field wall. For Thursdays and most Sunday home games, the Choctaw Lazy River is the site of a \"pool party\" with tickets available to the general public.\n\nFour exclusive members-only areas have been set up around the park. The most prominent of these \"Founder's Areas,\" is the JCPenney Club, a private, air-conditioned bar and restaurant situated below the press box behind home plate.\n\nCritics have taken issue with ticket prices at the ballpark, set at $7, $15, and $18. While less expensive than ticket prices for major league ballparks, prices are among the highest in all minor league classes. However, the ballpark has seen strong attendance despite these ticket prices. The ballpark runs a number of specials throughout the year including \"Friends & Family\" where 4 tickets, 4 hats and 4 value meals to a restaurant cost less than $10 a ticket. It also has a \"High 5 Plan\" where a block of 5 games (roughly one game each month) start at $9 a game, or a $19 ticket that includes all-you-can-eat food and drink. In its inaugural season, Dr Pepper Ballpark had an attendance of 675,620, ranking it fourth overall in Minor League Baseball attendance for the year. The ballpark sold out for 53 RoughRiders home games that season.\n\nThe following are the baseball ground rules for the Dr Pepper Ballpark.\n\n"}

Licensed to Wayne State University in the city's Cass Corridor neighborhood, about a mile south of the New Center neighborhood, WDET broadcasts original programming and shows from National Public Radio, Public Radio International and American Public Media. The station serves Metro Detroit and is the primary provider of news involving the American automotive industry and Michigan politics within the NPR distribution network.\n\nWDET-FM is licensed by the U.S. Federal Communications Commission for hybrid (digital plus analog) broadcasting.\n\nWayne State University holds the broadcasting license for the station through a grant from the United Auto Workers, which originally ran the station from its sign-on (December 18, 1948) until 1952. The UAW originally broadcast public service programming on the station, under station manager Ben Hoberman. What was then Wayne University (it joined the state university system in 1956) bought the station for one dollar in 1952 and converted it to non-commercial status. It is one of the few public radio stations in the nation that operates on a commercial frequency. It became the second charter affiliate in Michigan, after WUOM, of NPR in 1970, as well as a founding affiliate of the Michigan Public Radio news service that same year.\n\nIn 2004, WDET implemented extensive programming changes. They dropped many NPR-produced programs such as Fresh Air and Car Talk, as well as some popular local music shows such as Folks Like Us and Arkansas Traveler. This was done to promote more locally produced music programming. However, it was followed by a decline in listener pledges. In the fall of 2005, new general manager Michael Coleman (replacing Caryn Mathes, who departed for WAMU in Washington, D.C.) changed WDET's format again, dropping many of the new music programs in favor of a more news-oriented format, bringing back all of the previously dropped programming and adding new NPR-produced programs. Particularly controversial was the dismissal of long-time mid-day host Martin Bandyke. Local media outlets reported he may have violated conflict of interest rules by accepting gifts from record companies. Bandyke has since resurfaced in morning drive time at Adult Alternative-formatted WQKL-FM (107.1) in Ann Arbor.\n\nAs a result of the 2005 format change, some listeners filed a class action lawsuit against the station for fraudulently taking donations for programming that was planned on being discontinued. Disgruntled former listeners also held two protests. The first occurred in front of WDET's offices a few days after Christmas. The second occurred near Cobo Hall during the North American International Auto Show. Organizers promised that the rally would draw 5,000 people, though less than one hundred showed up, and a plan to protest WDET's changes during the Super Bowl XL festivities also failed to occur.\n\nOnly one weekday music show remains on WDET: Ed Love's nighttime jazz program, \"Destination Jazz,\" which features old and modern jazz music. The station has archived recent editions of these shows as well as their weekend music programming and made them available for listening at any time via its website.\n\nOn Thursday May 11, 2006, Michael Coleman announced another major shake-up at WDET. Six employees were laid off including long-time music host Jon Moshier. Several others were forced to accept paycuts, demotions, or reductions in hours.\n\nOn Monday April 2, 2007, WDET implemented several programming changes. The following programs were removed from the schedule: \"Day to Day\" (which was terminated by NPR, not WDET), \"Front Row Center,\" \"Live From Studio A,\" \"The Best of the DSO,\" Liz Copeland's \"Alternate Take,\" Chuck Horn's \"Seventh Journey,\" \"The Ralph Valdez program,\" Mick Collin's \"Night Train,\" and \"The W. Kim Heron Program.\" New additions included the locally produced \"Detroit Today\" as well as NPR programs \"Talk of the Nation,\" \"Marketplace,\" \"Marketplace Money,\" \"BBC World Service,\" \"Wait Wait... Don't Tell Me!,\" and \"The Changing World.\" \"Destination Jazz: The Ed Love Program\" was reduced from five to three hours, and Michael Julien's \"Global Mix\" was reduced from five to two hours. Combined with previous changes, the station moved to a more news oriented format. WDET now has less local and indie music coverage, although they continue to offer a niche for jazz, gospel, folk, rhythm and blues, and bluegrass.\n\nOn September 15, 2007 WDET added the show \"Tell Me More\" with Michel Martin from NPR News on weekdays at 1pm, which replaced \"World Have Your Say\" from BBC. \"Deep River\" with Robert Jones moved to Sunday afternoons, and \"The Tavis Smiley Show\" is now heard twice during the weekend, on Friday evenings and Sunday mornings.\n\nThe station produces news stories for local break-ins of NPR drive time news programs Morning Edition and All Things Considered. It also produces a weekday local news program, Detroit Today with Stephen Henderson, and several local arts programs: Ann Delisi's Essential Music, Rob Reinhart's Essential Music, Modern Music w/ Jon Moshier, The Progressive Underground w/Chris Campbell, , Nick Austin's New Soul Sunday, Jay's Place w/ Jay Butler (Butler was a longtime air personality on WJLB/WQBH-AM), Culture City with Travis Wright and This Island Earth w/ Ismael Ahmed. In the fall of 2013, the station replaced overnight BBC World Service programming with \"Alpha,\" a mix of electronic dance sounds and progressive soul.\n\nCurrent NPR programming includes Morning Edition, All Things Considered, Fresh Air, Tell Me More, and Wait Wait... Don't Tell Me!. American Public Media programming includes Marketplace, Speaking of Faith, and This American Life. The station also broadcasts The Takeaway and Public Radio International's This American Life.\n\nWDET currently ranks at #28 (0.7) in the Detroit market according to the November 2010 PPM ratings release. The station's HD2 feed is not currently operational, but is slated to be a 24/7 version of the station's \"Alpha\" overnight programming. (In May 2013, the WDET HD2 Facebook page announced that the signal was \"under construction\"; as of January 2014, WDET HD2 has not returned to the air.)\n\nThe Detroit Radio Information Service (DRIS) broadcasts on a subcarrier of WDET.

R. Tolkien. The game has an original backstory, largely confined to its documentation.\n\nThe game consists of a 15-level dungeon containing hundreds of different monster types and items. Much like other role-playing games, players must develop their characters by fighting these monsters and gaining new equipment, gradually getting powerful enough to survive lower levels. Characters can play as several races like \"Dwarf\", \"Elf\", \"Gnome\", and \"Giant\" while advancing in each of several guilds, including \"Warrior\", \"Sorcerer\", \"Healer\", \"Thief\", \"Seeker\", \"Mage\", \"Wizard\" and \"Paladin\".\n\nOn the lowest level of the dungeon resides the \"Prince of Devils\". Defeating this monster can be considered \"winning the game\", although the game does not end and continues to be playable (and challenging) long after. The game also offers replay value through new character/guild combinations and community-devised challenges and competitions.\n\nAllen designed \"Mordor\" after a late-1970s multi-user dungeon game named \"Avatar\", which ran on the PLATO system developed by the University of Illinois. Unlike \"Avatar\", \"Mordor\" offers single-user play only, although players can run several characters in the dungeon concurrently, and control up to four characters simultaneously in a single party.\n\nA reviewer for \"Next Generation\" praised the easy accessibility of character info, but condemned the game for its lack of story and puzzles, saying that the absence of these elements make it \"just not fun.\" He scored it two out of five stars.\n\n"}

Wolff Municipal Stadium (informally Wolff Stadium) is a stadium in San Antonio, Texas, United States. It is primarily used for baseball, and is the home field of the San Antonio Missions Minor League Baseball team of the Triple-A Pacific Coast League. The UTSA Roadrunners baseball team also plays some home games at the stadium. The stadium is named for Bexar County Judge Nelson Wolff, who is a former Texas legislator and San Antonio councilman and mayor.\n\nThe Wolff is located about 8 miles (13 km) to the west of Downtown San Antonio. It was opened on April 18, 1994, (as the San Antonio Municipal Stadium) and has 6,200 fixed seats and a grass berm in left field that can seat about 3,000. The stadium features 14 luxury suites, a 500-person picnic area down the right field line, and an all-you-can-eat-and-drink fiesta deck that can be rented for groups of 25 to 200 people. The dimensions (from home plate to the outfield wall) are: 310 feet (94 m) to left field, 402 feet (123 m) to center field, and 340 feet (100 m) to right field.\n\nViewing the stadium from the outside entrance (behind home plate) there are two large brick bell towers, in keeping with a southwestern theme, and echoing an architectural feature of the old Mission Stadium. Shaded seating in the stadium can be found in the Infield Reserved section 200-208 in the back 6 rows. There are no poles to impede views as seen in some older minor league parks. A concourse wraps around the playing field and provides spectators varied views of the game and stadium.\n\nThe section behind home plate has individual seats; the left and right field seating areas, however, are entirely made up of bleachers.\n\nPlanes can often be seen flying into and out of Lackland Air Force Base behind the outfield wall. The Missions regularly have \"Military Night\", inviting recently graduated troops to Friday night games.\n\nOn July 7, 1997, the ballpark hosted the Double-A All-Star Game in which a team of American League-affiliated All-Stars defeated a team of National League-affiliated All-Stars, 4–0, before 7,114 people in attendance.\n\nWolff Stadium hosted the 2011 Texas League All-Star Game.\n\nThe third annual Mala Luna Music Festival was held from October 27–28, 2018, in the parking lot outside of the stadium.\n\nFollowing the 2006 season, the City of San Antonio voted 9–0 to a revised lease of Wolff Stadium. The San Antonio Missions took control of the stadium with plans to invest $1.2 million to improving the concession areas, create a fiesta deck in left field, improve the sound system, install an LED scoreboard to replace the scoreboard in right field, and repaint. In addition, the City invested $300,000 for new lighting.\n\nThe lease also calls for the Missions to spend the next 10 years in the stadium. There are three options of five years each as well.\n\n"}
{"id": "2268463", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2268463", "title": "WATE-TV", "text": "WATE-TV\n\nWATE-TV, virtual channel 6 (UHF digital channel 26), is an ABC-affiliated television station licensed to Knoxville, Tennessee, United States. The station is owned by Nexstar Media Group. WATE-TV's studios are located in the Greystone mansion on North Broadway/SR 33/SR 71/US 441, and its transmitter is located on Sharp's Ridge in North Knoxville.\n\nOn cable, the station is available on Charter Spectrum channel 13 in SD and 713 in high definition, as well as Comcast Xfinity channels 13 and 1006, WOW! channels 13 and 901, and AT&T U-Verse channels 6 and 1006.\n\nChannel 6 was East Tennessee's first television station, signing on the air at 8 p.m. on October 1, 1953 as WROL-TV. The race to be the first television station in the eastern part of the state was won by WROL-TV when the tower of WJHL-TV in Johnson City (ironically, now a sister station to channel 6) collapsed a few months earlier. That station would have been first to sign-on, but WROL claimed the title by only 25 days. Its first studios were underneath the self-supporting tower on Sharp's Ridge which was one of the tallest man-made structures in Tennessee at the time. It was signed on by Greater East Tennessee TV, Inc., owned by local insurance executive Paul Mountcastle and a small group of investors along with WROL-AM 950. At the time, Mountcastle was chairman of the board of the Life and Casualty Insurance Company of Tennessee of Nashville, which signed on WLAC-TV (now WTVF) in that city in 1954. The stations were not considered to be co-owned.\n\nWROL-TV signed-on as a primary NBC affiliate because of WROL-AM's longtime affiliation with NBC Radio and also shared ABC programming with CBS affiliate WSKT-TV (now WVLT-TV). Although NBC held a firm grip on WROL, DuMont tried unsuccessfully several times to get a secondary affiliation with the station when it was not broadcasting NBC and ABC. Channel 6 opted to fill its non-network schedule with local programming, a Federal Communications Commission (FCC) mandate. DuMont was forced to join WTVK on a secondary basis. CBS also made many attempts to grab a primary affiliation with Knoxville's only VHF station, but the owners of WROL held firm despite many financial incentives from the other networks, especially CBS.\n\nThe station changed its call letters to WATE-TV in 1955 with the new call letters not really standing for anything; the licensee also was renamed to WATE, Inc. John Reese, the station's program director at the time stated \"those call letters were the next available at the FCC.\" In 1956, WATE dropped ABC when WBIR-TV signed-on and took the CBS affiliation from WTVK, leaving WTVK the ABC station by default. At that time, Knoxville became one of the smallest TV markets in the country to have affiliates of all three networks. WROL-AM later changed its call letters to WATE-AM to correspond with the television station. WATE-TV had a role in the failure of WBIR to have its second antenna tower on House Mountain in 1965 for better coverage. The station used a rather ingenious way to force its chief rival station to build a tower on Zachary Ridge instead of on the much higher House Mountain. WATE simply purchased all of the property on the top of House Mountain from the lot owners. With no property for the tower base on the Mountain, WBIR had no choice but to spend millions of dollars more to build a taller tower on much-shorter Zachery Ridge nearby two years later.\n\nAs was broadcast tradition with many stations in the 1950s, the channel's sales offices moved to downtown Knoxville and the studios were moved to a new building on North Broadway. In 1965, Mountcastle and his group sold WATE-TV to Nationwide Communications of Columbus, Ohio. That same year, the station moved into and renovated the historic 19th century Greystone Mansion that is now on the National Register of Historic Places. At the same time, WATE-AM (which had changed frequency to 620 kilohertz) was sold off changing its call letters to WETE. It is now WRJZ, at AM 620. The self-supporting tower on Sharp's Ridge was dismantled in 1975 when the station built a broadcasting tower alongside it. That tower was dismantled in July 2016, owing to a newer, multi-plexed tower built beside it. The taller tower is owned by American Towers, Inc., formerly Spectracite Broadcast Towers, Inc.\n\nOn September 17, 1979, WATE swapped its NBC affiliation with WTVK to become an ABC affiliate. The years 1979 to 1980 saw the ABC television network become the highest-rated in the country and ABC wanted a stronger station in Knoxville. At the time, WATE-TV joined other former NBC affiliates WSB-TV in Atlanta, KSTP-TV in Minneapolis–Saint Paul, and WSOC-TV in Charlotte who also switched to ABC. At the time, WATE was the market leader with a strong VHF signal in East Tennessee, Southwestern Virginia, and Southeastern Kentucky. WTVK's UHF signal on channel 26 was marginal at best in much of the Knoxville area and many viewers in East Tennessee and Southeastern Kentucky treated ABC as though it were a new television network (which it was anything but at the time). Some of them would not see NBC again until September 10, 1988, when WBIR-TV joined that network that day. CBS was no longer seen in many of these households until December 1, 1988, when CBS moved its affiliation to WTVK (which coincided with its call letter change to WKXT-TV and switch to VHF channel 8 on that day; it is now WVLT-TV). Coincidentally, seventeen years later, WATE's digital signal would be broadcast on digital channel 26.\n\nDuring its first fifty years, WATE pioneered many locally produced programs like \"The Homemaker Show\" hosted by Mary Starr. Housewives were glued to television sets as Mary showed them the latest recipes and homemaking tips. \"Star Time\", hosted by local businessman Jim Clayton, featured many local country music acts and \"The Cas Walker Show\", a local country music show hosted by former Knoxville Mayor Cas Walker who also owned a chain of grocery stores in East Tennessee, Southwest Virginia, and Southeast Kentucky. The show also featured Dolly Parton who made her television debut on WATE-TV before she became famous. In 1981, the station premiered \"PM Magazine\" with MayCay Beeler and Calvin Sneed. The popular syndicated show highlighted unusual people, places, and things from the East Tennessee/Southeastern Kentucky area.\n\nIn 1993, Nationwide sold its three ABC-affiliated television stations (WATE, WBAY-TV in Green Bay, Wisconsin, and WRIC-TV in Richmond, Virginia) to Young Broadcasting. Young Broadcasting emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in June 2010, and the new company was renamed New Young Broadcasting, Inc. As a contingency of the reorganization plan, Young signed a limited management agreement with Atlanta-based Gray Television to allow that company to operate all of Young's stations except WATE, WLNS-TV in Lansing, Michigan, and KRON-TV in San Francisco. Gray was not allowed to operate WATE or WLNS because it also owns WVLT in the Knoxville market and WILX-TV in Lansing. Young Broadcasting merged with Media General on November 12, 2013, which united East Tennessee's first TV station (WATE-TV) and the second TV station in East Tennessee (WJHL-TV, Johnson City) as sister stations. In 2017, Media General merged with Nexstar Broadcasting.\n\nWATE-TV adopted its current \"Circle 6\" logo in 2011. Due to the design and similar callsigns, the logo has received comparisons to fellow ABC affiliate WTAE-TV in Pittsburgh, who has used the current version of its \"Circle 4\" logo since 1995 and has used a variation of it since 1973. Aside from the ABC affiliation, the two stations are not related.\n\nThe station's digital signal is multiplexed:\nWATE-TV carried The Country Network on its second subchannel in late 2010 until November 1, 2011, when WATE-TV's parent company, New Young Broadcasting terminated its deal with TCN, and dropped the channel on all of its stations. Subchannel 6.2 was relaunched on June 1, 2012 with the addition of Live Well Network, but was deactivated again on May 30, 2015. The subchannel is expected to be reactivated at a future date, featuring programming from the all-comedy network Laff, the result of an affiliation deal between Media General and Laff's owner, Katz Broadcasting. On February 1, 2016 GetTV began rolling out after a deal with Media General and Sony Pictures TV.\n\nWATE-TV shut down its analog signal, over VHF channel 6, on June 12, 2009, the official date in which full-power television stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station's digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 26. Through the use of PSIP, digital television receivers display the station's virtual channel as its former VHF analog channel 6.\n\nSyndicated programming on WATE-TV includes \"Live with Kelly and Ryan\", \"Judge Judy\", \"The Wendy Williams Show\", \"The Rachael Ray Show\" and \"Family Feud\", among others.\n\nDuring the month of August, WATE broadcasts Tennessee Titans preseason football games regionally syndicated by sister station and fellow ABC affiliate WKRN-TV/Nashville.\n\nWATE-TV broadcasts 40 hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with six hours on weekdays and five hours each on Saturdays and Sundays).\n\nAlthough WATE may not have always been a ratings powerhouse in Eastern Tennessee, it has been the leader in other areas. In the late-1960s, it assembled the popular on-air team of news anchor Pete Gardener, weathercaster Margie Ison, and Sports Director Mike Thurman. This move resulted in the station slowly making inroads into the ratings-dominant WBIR which was the overall market leader at the time. In the early-1970s, Sam Brown joined WATE as news anchor and the group of \"Sam, Mike, and Margie\" subsequently became the most well-known on-air personality team in Knoxville.\n\nBy the mid-1970s after the previous changes had been in place for a while, all of the station's newscasts were ranked number one in their respective time periods. Also at this point, it was the first outlet to update its newsroom technology with a switch from film to videotape (i.e. electronic journalism) as well as own-and-operating a live microwave truck to assist in newsgathering purposes.\n\nThe station was Knoxville's first to utilize a helicopter (known as \"Sky Eye 6\") for on-air coverage. In 1977, WATE debuted the market's first local newscasts seen on Saturday evenings featuring anchor Art Powell, Kay Elliott providing weather forecasts, and Calvin Sneed with sports news. This was followed in 1978 by the launch of Knoxville's first noon newscast with Sneed adding the show to his anchoring duties. In 1979, he would be promoted to weekend news anchor in order to welcome the area's first local newscasts seen on Sunday nights.\n\nIn 1980, WATE promoted Sneed to become the first African-American to co-anchor weeknight broadcasts in Eastern Tennessee. At that time, the unofficial goal of the weeknight news crew was to regularly scoop the \"Knoxville Journal\" (a morning newspaper) which was in the process of gaining circulation over the \"Knoxville News Sentinel\" (published in the afternoons). The stories seen on-air served as fodder for the next day's coverage assignments pioneering the \"follow-up\" concept of reporting in modern-day journalism. WATE also hired the market's first AMS-certified meteorologist in Knoxville and Eastern Tennessee in 1979 when Mark Mancuso joined the team.\n\nIn 1998, a news share agreement was established with Fox affiliate WTNZ (owned by Raycom Media). This resulted in Knoxville's original prime time newscast to debut. Known as \"Fox 43 Ten O'Clock News\", the nightly thirty-minute show featured a similar format to broadcasts seen on this station except for WTNZ's logo being present in the graphics. In 2002, it began to compete with another nightly newscast seen at 10 on then-WB (now CW) affiliate WBXX-TV. Produced by WBIR, this production offered as an alternative to WTNZ only aired for twelve minutes in an abbreviated format featuring the day's top stories along with an updated weather forecast. In early-March 2011, WTNZ terminated its outsourcing arrangement with WATE after entering into another contract with WBIR.\n\nAs a result, the latter station stopped producing the nightly update for WBXX. WBIR/WTNZ became the second news operation to upgrade to high definition on June 1 while WVLT was the first back on January 9, 2011. WATE's weekday noon show was cancelled on January 31, 2008 making the station Knoxville's only outlet without a newscast seen in the time period. On August 1, 2011 the station returned to the prime time newscast race with a new nightly 35 minute broadcast on WBXX (owned by the Lockwood Broadcast Group) through an outsourcing agreement. The broadcast is known on-air as \"The CW 20 News at 10\".\n\nOn October 17, 2011, starting with their 5 p.m. newscast, WATE became the final station in the Knoxville market to broadcast in high definition. Along with the switch to HD, the station unveiled a new logo, new graphics, new studio set, and new news music: \"Locals Only\" by Stephen Arnold Music. The newscast on WBXX was initially not included in the upgrade as that station lacked a high definition-capable master control at its separate studios to transmit the newscast in HD. In early April 2012, that channel finally upgraded its master control to allow the WATE newscast and some other local and syndicated programming to be broadcast in HD.\n\nOn December 31, 2016, WATE-TV broadcast its final newscast on WBXX-TV. WVLT-TV began producing newscasts on WBXX-TV the following day.\n\n"}

It operates the trackage and maintains the stock of the Oslo Metro and Oslo Tramway, as well as owning eight operating subsidiaries. In 2005, its 2,365 employees transported 160 million passengers 710 million kilometers, and since 2008 it has operated on contract with the public transport authority Ruter.\n\nSporveien is itself responsible for the rail infrastructure in Oslo. The Oslo Metro is operated by the subsidiary Sporveien T-banen while the Oslo Tramway is operated by the subsidiary Sporveien Trikken. Some of the city buses are operated by the subsidiaries Sporveisbussene and UniBuss, though these are subject to public service obligation contracts with Ruter.\n\nThe responsibility for maintenance and infrastructure is in the hands of the parent company. In addition to the operational subsidiaries of the company, Sporveien also owns three other subsidiaries. AS Sporvognsannonsene is responsible for sale of advertisement on the buses and rails. This company cooperates with JCDecaux, and in 2005 it sold for . Sporveien T-banen AS is responsible for the purchase of the new MX3000 cars, while Sporveisbilletter AS is developing the new ticket system.\n\nThere are currently major revisions to the infrastructure, paid in part by the city's surrounding toll roads in addition to public funding, upgrading the metro system for NOK 7 billion, known as the Oslo Package 2. A new RFID ticketing system, Flexus with automatic turnstile barriers will (after major delays) be introduced sometime, though announcements of immediate installations have been occurring since the late 1990s, and there will be a major upgrade of the rolling stock with new electric multiple units from Siemens in Austria and Germany, MX3000, which will be delivered between 2006 and 2010.\n\nThe first tramways in Oslo were created by Kristiania Sporveisselskab (the Green trams) in 1875 when it opened a horsecar line between Stortorvet and Homansbyen. In 1894 the company Kristiania Elektriske Sporvei (the Blue trams) opened a line between Jernbanetorget via Briskeby to Majorstuen with a branch line to Skarpsno. This was Scandinavias first electric tram company. A/S Holmenkollbanen was created in 1898 and operated the first suburban line between Majorstuen and Holmenkollen. In 1899 the city established its own tram company that expanded the routes of the Green trams after they transferred to electrical propulsion. This company was taken over by the Green trams in 1905. Holmenkollbanen opened the first subway in Scandinavia in 1928 between Majorstuen and Nationaltheatret.\n\nThe municipal A/S Kristiania Sporveier was created in 1924 when the concession for the Blue and Green trams expired. The company changed its name to A/S Oslo Sporveier a year later when the city changed its name from Kristiania to Oslo. In 1940 Oslo Sporveier set up the Oslo trolleybus network, a network of four trolleybus routes, but it was abandoned in 1967. In 1966 Lokaltrafikkhistorisk Forening was created to take care of defunct material from Oslo Sporveier.\n\nOslo T-bane, the Oslo Metro, opened in 1966, at the time making Oslo the smallest city in the world with a rapid transit. But it was not until 1993 that the western and eastern networks in the city were connected, and in 2006 the T-bane circle route opened. The company ordered 99 new metro cars from Siemens in 2003. Since the late 1990s the company has been under a constant reorganization, including the creation of a corporate structure and the separation of production and ordering into two separate companies, as well as privatization of operations.\n\nOn 1 July 2006, Oslo Sporveier changed their name to Kollektivtransportproduksjon. The name Oslo Sporveier was taken over by a new administrative company for public transportation in Oslo, the Oslo Public Transport Administration, which later merged with Stor-Oslo Lokaltrafikk to form Ruter from 2008. \n\nThe organization structure was largely the brainchild of Peter N. Myhre, former Councilor for Transport of the Progress Party. Kollektivtransportproduksjon is organized as a concern, with six subsidiaries four business units as well as sister companies. A report published by Rokade in January 2011, claimed that the company wasted NOK 55 million per year on unnecessary administration because of the structure. In particular, the consulting group found that the judicial independence of the various companies made it necessary for the group to employ a considerable number of specialists in each of the companies—some of which are very small—with the sole purpose of checking the other companies. The report concluded that this also made for unclear lines of responsibility, which could be a safety risk, and that the company could be able to remove 60 administrative positions if it were better organized.\n\nOn 7 May 2013, Kollektivtransportproduksjon changed their name again to Sporveien Oslo, not to be confused with what is now Ruter. In December 2013, the subsididiaries Oslotrikken and Oslo T-banedrift changed their names and brands to reflect that of Sporveien, with the two new names being Sporveien Trikken and Sporveien T-banen.\n\n"}
{"id": "2268471", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2268471", "title": "My Name Is Not Susan", "text": "My Name Is Not Susan\n\n\"My Name Is Not Susan\" is the fourth single released from Whitney Houston's third album \"I'm Your Baby Tonight\" (1990). The song was produced by L.A. Reid and Babyface, and written by Eric Foster White. In the song, Houston confronts a lover who has mistakenly called her by his ex-girlfriend's name \"Susan.\" She gives him a harsh rebuke for the mistake and lets him know that if he cannot get over Susan, then their relationship is over.\n\n\"Rolling Stone\"'s James Hunter noted that Houston \"stipulates in no uncertain terms\" in this song vocally. \"Entertainment Weekly\" editor David Browne panned: \"in what could be seen as an audition for her pending movie career, Houston gets to act \"angry\" on \"My Name Is Not Susan,\" in which she scolds a bedmate for calling out the name of an ex-flame in his sleep.\" J. D. Consodine of \"The Baltimore Sun\" felt that the song was emotionless: \"(Whitney) has no trouble navigating a state-of-the-art funk groove (as with the new jack \"My Name Is Not Susan\"), she's mainly going through the motions; there's absolutely nothing in her performance to suggest that she was even the slightest bit moved by these songs.\" \"Music & Media\" described the song as a \"pacey pop/dance track boasting a snappy chorus.\"\n\nIn the song's music video directed by Lionel C. Martin, Houston is featured playing both herself and a character named \"Susan.\" The video is inspired by several elements in the Alfred Hitchcock film \"Vertigo\", both containing a man involved with an obsessive love for both a glamorous blonde and down-to-earth brunette played by the same actress. Several specific scenes that are parallel include a visit to a park, dining in a restaurant, and the photographer's buying clothes for the girl, having her hair also dyed blonde, and the way she emerges from the bathroom. The boyfriend, who is a photographer may have been suggested by another Hitchcock film, \"Rear Window\". There is also a version of the video with a remix with British rapper Monie Love. Outtakes from the video and alternate footage was reused for the video to the follow-up single \"I Belong to You\".\n\n\"My Name Is Not Susan\" debuted on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 at number 67, peaking at number 20. It remained in the Top 40 for six weeks, Houston's shortest showing at the time. It peaked at number eight on the R&B Singles Chart. \"My Name Is Not Susan\" was modestly received internationally, where it peaked at number 29 on the UK Singles Chart and a modest number 57 in Germany. In 1998, a remixed version of the song (remixed by Snap! in 1991 as the Logic remix) charted in Germany and reached number 52, five places higher than the original did in 1991.\n\nHouston performed the song on her 1991 I'm Your Baby Tonight World Tour. Three different performances of the song were taped; in Yokohama, Japan on March 15, 1991; Oakland, California on May 11, 1991; and A Coruña, Spain on September 29, 1991. The Yokohama concert was broadcast on Japanese TV channel and the show in Oakland was aired during The Simple Truth: A Concert for Kurdish Refugees, a telethon held to aid the Kurds on May 12, 1991. She also performed the song on Welcome Home Heroes, broadcast live on HBO, March 31, 1991. This performance can be found on the video: \"Welcome Home Heroes with Whitney Houston ― Live in Concert.\" () At the 19th American Music Awards of 1992, Houston performed the remixed version of the song as a part of \"I'm Your Baby Tonight Medley,\" along with \"I'm Your Baby Tonight\" and \"Who Do You Love.\" In addition, she performed the song on , the first of three concerts was aired live on HBO in November 1994, and on a private gig to celebrate for the wedding of Princess Rashidah, the eldest daughter of the Sultan of Brunei on August 24, 1996.\n\n\n\n\nNotes: The \"'70's Flange Mix\" is named the \"Bellydance Mix\" on some vinyl releases. The \"Waddell Straight Mix\", \"Extended U.K. Mix\" & \"The Upbeat Cut Mix\" are the same mix with alternate names. The \"Waddell Alternate Mix\" & \"Alternate U.K. Mix\" are the same mix as well.\n\n"}

{"id": "2268478", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2268478", "title": "MagiCan", "text": "MagiCan\n\nMagiCans were special, mechanical cans used by The Coca-Cola Company in the United States of America as a part of their $100-million \"Magic Summer '90\" promotion. The MagiCan promotion began on May 7, 1990, and ended on May 31.\n\nIn this promotion, some Coca-Cola cans had cash prizes or gift certificates inside instead of Coca-Cola. The prizes were spring-loaded to pop out of the opening once the can was opened. The prize would either be money, from $1 to $500, or coupons redeemable for trips or merchandise. The total giveaway of cash and prize coupons was $4 million. The original plan was to randomly distribute about 750,000 MagiCans among the 200 million cans of Coca-Cola Classic in circulation at any one time. To make the cans feel and weigh normal, and prevent people from easily finding the prize cans, a sealed area within the cans was filled with a mixture of chlorinated water and a foul-smelling substance to discourage drinking. Though initially a great success, leading to a rise in sales, technical difficulties led to the promotion's early termination. \n\nCoca-Cola first announced the \"Magic Summer '90\" campaign in March 1990 by sending MagiCans containing money to journalists. Some journalists wrote that it was questionable for a big corporation to mail cash to reporters. The campaign continued without the MagiCans, giving away tickets to the Coca-Cola–sponsored New Kids on The Block's Magic Summer Tour and distributing \"MagiCups\", which were paper cups with peel-off prizes on the exterior used for fountain drinks at fast-food chains and other fountain outlets.\n\nA number of cans had problems: the pop-up mechanism malfunctioned, jamming, or a faulty seal released some of the chlorinated water mixture into the can itself. A widely reported incident involved an 11-year-old boy in Massachusetts drinking the foul-tasting liquid used to replace actual cola. Despite initial fears, the Massachusetts Department of Public Health determined that the water was not harmful, containing a lower concentration of chlorine than the water in a typical swimming pool. Worried about the bad publicity and potential product liability lawsuits, Coke immediately placed television and newspaper advertisements in 50 large United States markets. The full-page ads, run only once, warned consumers that a \"very small number\" of cans contain a foul-smelling but harmless water that should not be ingested. The ads were headlined \"Take A Good Look\" and in smaller type, read \"You could have a MagiCan.\" The print ads pointed out that the MagiCans might be defective, which actually proved a key point in any potential plaintiff's lawsuit under the doctrine of strict liability. Moreover, the problem with the chlorinated mixture was not concern of being drunk by accident, but that it spilled over into the prize. Multiple winners complained about receiving soggy money after activating a MagiCan.\n\nWhen Coca-Cola began receiving complaints about the faulty cans, it temporarily halted distribution of the MagiCans to local bottlers. The plan was to test MagiCans before distribution by shaking them to detect faulty mechanisms. Coca-Cola's own initial estimate was that 120,000 MagiCans were on store shelves or in bottler inventories at the initial release, of which less than 1 percent, or fewer than 1,200 cans, were faulty. Ultimately, Coke ended the campaign after only three weeks due to the negative publicity regarding faulty cans. This negative publicity included an editorial cartoon showing a man in sunglasses opening a soda can while standing near a billboard hyping MagiCans, then removing his sunglasses in surprise when a small sign emerges from his can reading \"Buy Pepsi\". The ads also drew fire from a 1990 issue of \"Zillions\", the juvenile version of \"Consumer Reports\" magazine, in their annual \"ZAP Awards\" segments detailing the worst ads of 1990. \"Zillions\"' complaint was that the ads deceptively showed people opening cans that turned out to be MagiCans every time, making the contest look easier to win than it actually was (the magazine also made the same complaint about Burger King's \"Whopper & Wheels\" promotion, which received far less publicity).\n\nThe decision to end the campaign came one week after the \"Take A Good Look\" advertisements were released. Coca-Cola then released ads telling consumers that only a few prize cans were left on the market and that they would be \"going, going, gone by mid-June\", the time when the company estimated the existing cans would be purchased and off the shelves. At the time of termination, 200,000 of the 750,000 planned promotional cans had been distributed. Although largely confident there were no safety issues, Coca-Cola's final advertising spot showed New Kids on the Block with an added voiceover from Jordan Knight warning, \"If you have a winning can, don't drink the liquid!\"\n\nMeanwhile, rival Pepsi also did a prize giveaway in 1990 under the \"Cool Cans\" promotion. However, instead of a complicated push-up device in cans, each can was filled with normal, drinkable cola and at the bottom of the inside of the can there was a number printed that could correspond with a prize, from $25 to $20,000. The consumer called a toll-free number to find out if they had won. Pepsi's promotion also suffered from negative publicity when it was discovered that if two specific Cool Cans were stacked in a certain way, the designs appeared to spell out the word \"SEX\". Coca-Cola would attempt a similar promotion three years later with \"Monsters of the Gridiron\", a Halloween-themed promotion where people could call a toll-free number and enter a code, to which a recording from an NFL star would tell them whether or not they won a prize.\n\nCoca-Cola's quick damage-control initiative was reminiscent of the fiasco over New Coke several years earlier.\n\nThere was an urban legend in the 1990s and 2000s that a child had died drinking the liquid in one of the MagiCans. This has been reported as false according to Snopes.com, and its origins were traced back to media coverage of a boy who was taken to the hospital as a precaution after his mother suspected product tampering.\n\n"}

It was also at this time that she received her patriarchal blessing from the Boston Stake patriarch (she was and is a Mormon), that said things that had a role in her decision to study law. She graduated in 1967 with an A.B. with Honors. She then went to Boston College for law to be near her husband while he finished his undergraduate studies at Harvard. When he was accepted to Duke Medical School, Durham transferred to Duke Law School. She graduated from Duke Law School in 1971.\n\nShe is now on the Board of Trustees of Duke University, where she is on the Executive Committee and chairs the Faculty, Graduate and Professional Schools Affairs and Honorary Degree Committees. For a personal account of her early life, see \"Mormon Women: Portraits and Conversations\" by James N. Kimball and Kent Miles.\n\nDurham was an Instructor of Legal Medicine at Duke University Medical School immediately after she graduated from law school in 1971 until 1973. She was admitted to the North Carolina State Bar in 1971. She had a general law practice while in North Carolina, representing private clients in domestic law, employment law, and personal injury law work. She also did title law work and criminal defense work off of the county indigency list. While in North Carolina, she was a legal consultant for the Duke University Center for the Study of Aging and Human Development. She and her husband moved to Utah in 1973, where she became an Adjunct Professor of Law at Brigham Young University’s J. Reuben Clark Law School until 1978. At this time she formed a partnership with two other lawyers and founded the law firm of Johnson, Durham, & Moxley. In 1980, the firm merged with a larger firm in Salt Lake City. She also occasionally teaches constitutional law at the University of Utah’s S. J. Quinney College of Law.\n\nDurham is on the Council of the American Law Institute and the American Bar Association’s Council of Legal Education and Admissions to the Bar. She is a fellow of the American Bar Foundation, and serves on the Board of Directors of both the American Judicature Society and the National Center for State Courts.\n\nIn 1978, Durham became a trial judge in the 3rd Judicial District Court for the state of Utah. She served for four years, one of them as the presiding judge. She was appointed as a Justice of the Utah Supreme Court by Governor Scott M. Matheson in 1982 and became the Chief Justice in April 2002. She resigned as Chief Justice in March 2012. She was the first female Chief Justice of a state to swear into office a female governor, when Olene Walker became Utah’s 15th governor.\n\nDurham was retained by Utah voters in retention elections in 1984, 1994, 2004, and 2014.\n\nIn May 2017, Durham announced that she would retire from the Utah Supreme Court in November 2017. She was succeeded on the bench by Paige Petersen.\n\nJustice Durham wrote majority opinions and dissenting opinions in many cases. For a full list of Justice Durham's Utah Supreme Court decisions, go to http://www.utcourts.gov/opinions/#scoral\n\nIn the case of In the Matter of the Adoption of W. A. T., \"et al.\", 808 P.2d 1083, 1085 State v. Holm (Utah 1991), Justice Durham protected the civil rights of polygamists. The decision held that the Utah Constitution does not per se preclude a polygamist family from adopting children. Justice Durham, writing for the 3-2 court, noted, \"The fact that our constitution requires the state to prohibit polygamy does not necessarily mean that the state must deny any or all civil rights and privileges to polygamists.\" She noted that many things are crimes like polygamy, but we extend civil rights to perpetrators of those crimes. She stated, \"It is not the role of the courts to make threshold exclusions dismissing without consideration, for example, the adoption petitions of all convicted felons, all persons engaging in fornication or adultery, or other persons engaged in illegal activities.\" The decision also upheld the constitutionality of the bigamy statute in the Utah Constitution.\n\nIn the case of State v. MacGuire, 84 P.3d 1171 (Utah 2004) in 2004 the Utah Supreme Court ruled that all fetuses are covered under the state's criminal homicide statute. Though she agreed with that premise, Justice Durham dissented based on the definition of the capital murder and aggravated murder charges as well as based on the US Supreme Court decision of Roe v. Wade. \"Declaring a fetus to be a 'person' entitled to equal protection would require not only overturning Roe v. Wade but also making abortion, as a matter of constitutional law, illegal in all circumstances, even to save the life of the mother.\" \n\nDurham is a proponent of first looking to the Utah Constitution before the Federal Constitution for protection of an individual's rights. In her concurrence to State v. Daniels, 40 P.3d 611, 626 (Utah 2002), she stated, “I continue to be a proponent of independent state constitutional analysis on federalism grounds, believing we should use a primacy approach or dual analysis approach whenever possible.” In State v. Larocco, 794 P.2d 460 (Utah 1990), however, Justice Durham recognized the duality of the American system. Justice Durham, in her majority opinion, explained that states may rest their analysis on state constitution first because it “may prove to be an appropriate method for insulating citizens from the vagaries of inconsistent interpretations given . . . by the federal courts.” \n\nIn the case of University of Utah v. Shurtleff, 144 P.3d 1109 (Utah 2006)., the Utah Supreme Court ruled in a 4-1 decision that the University of Utah has no right to ban guns on campus, rejecting the argument that prohibiting firearms is part of the school's power to control academic affairs. In her dissent, Chief Justice Durham said policies that are reasonably connected to the school's academic mission are within its autonomous authority over academic affairs. Under the majority analysis, she said, \"the university may not subject a student to academic discipline for flashing his pistol to a professor in class.\" \n\nJustice Durham has published numerous articles and is a frequent lecturer on the judiciary, women's issues, and civic education. She helped draft a manual on legal rights of the elderly. Also, as a former head of the Judiciary Branch of Utah, she gave annual State of the Judiciary addresses to the legislative branch of the state. She has spoken at various conventions, including the 2010 Spring Convention of the Utah State Bar, the 2010 National Conference of the American Bar Association, and the 123rd Jackson Lecture in 2009.\n\nDurham served on the Governor's Task Force that recommended legislation to implement the 1985 amendments to the Judicial Article of the Utah Constitution. She served on the Utah Constitutional Revision Commission for 12 years. As Chief Justice, she chaired the Utah Judicial Council, which is the administrative governing body of the state court system. She served as the first chair of the Utah Judicial Council's Education Committee. She was the Founder of the Leadership Institute in Judicial Education. She was part of the Commission on Justice in the 21st Century and the Co-chair of the Committee on Improving Jury Service. She was the first Chair of the Utah State Court's Public Outreach Committee. From 1986 to 1997 she was the President of the National Association of Women Judges, which organization she founded. She was on the Advisory Committee on the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. She is the immediate past President of the Conference of Chief Justices, and is the first Utahn to be elected to this position. She is the leader of the Coalition for Civic, Character, and Service Learning - a partnership between civic organizations, public education, the judicial branch, and the legal profession to improve education about the justice system in Utah public schools.\n\nDurham was elected to the American Law Institute in 1984 and was elected to the ALI Council in 1989. She has served as an Adviser on Restatement Third, Employment Law and as a Member Consultant on Model Penal Code: Sentencing and Model Penal Code: Sexual assault and Related Offenses.\n\nRecognized nationally for her work in Judicial Education, Christine Durham currently serves on the board of trustees for the University of the People. Her excellence has been a critical factor in helping establish the world's first non-profit, tuition-free, online academic institution that seeks to revolutionize higher education by making college-level studies accessible to students worldwide.\n\nChristine Durham has been recognized nationally for her work in judicial education and efforts to improve the administration of justice. In 2007, Durham received the William H. Rehnquist Award for Judicial Excellence, one of the most prestigious judicial honors in the country. She is the only Utahn to have received this award to date. The award is presented annually to a state court judge who exemplifies the highest level of judicial excellence, integrity, fairness, and professional ethics. Chief Justice of the United States John Roberts presented the award to Durham on 15 November 2007 at a ceremony in Washington, D.C. Chief Justice Roberts said, \"Chief Justice Durham has demonstrated her commitment to public service, judicial education, and the cause of justice throughout her 25 years on the Utah Supreme Court. She reflects those qualities that Chief Justice Rehnquist valued during his distinguished career.” President Mary C. McQueen of the National Center for State Courts said Durham was selected because of her “innovative leadership style and her contributions to advancing judicial branch education not only in Utah, but nationally.” Justice Durham is noted for developing interactive education programs in content areas that previously did not have curriculum, such as domestic violence, child witness testimony, and scientific evidence. She has received honorary degrees from the University of Utah, Utah Valley University, Weber State University, Salt Lake Community College, and the College of Eastern Utah.\n\nUniversity of the People (Member of Board of Trustees) \n\nDurham is a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Her husband, George Durham, is a pediatrician and they have five children. George Durham has served as a bishop in the LDS Church.\n\nKimball, James N. and Miles, Kent.

He will be the 12th Earl if the current earl, Paul Capell, 11th Earl of Essex (currently and unmarried), dies without legitimate male issue. He had considered renouncing the earldom if it would require him to give up his United States citizenship (under the United Kingdom's Peerage Act 1963, a person may disclaim a hereditary peerage). United States law requires only government officeholders without Congressional authorization and persons wishing to become naturalized citizens, however, to renounce titles of nobility. As Mr. Capell is in neither category, there would be no legal impediment to his use of the title as a U.S. citizen; indeed there is precedent in the case of the Earl of Wharncliffe, currently a Maine construction worker.\n\nLike the sixth and later Earls of Essex, William Capell is descended from the younger son of the fourth Earl. His father Bladen Horace Capell claimed the title after the ninth Earl died in 1981, but Robert de Vere Capell (1920–2005) eventually proved that his ancestor Algernon was older than Bladen's ancestor Adolphus and thus took his seat in the House of Lords in 1989.\n\n\nIn 2005, Capell made his first visit to England with his wife, daughter, and son-in-law. The visit was televised on the tabloid show \"Inside Edition\".\n\nHe has two children:\n\nIf William succeeds to the earldom, Kevin will acquire the courtesy title \"Viscount Malden\", and Jennifer will become \"Lady Jennifer Cabrera\".\n\n[All dead links]\n\n"}
{"id": "2268483", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2268483", "title": "Theophysics", "text": "Theophysics\n\nIn philosophy, theophysics is an approach to cosmology that attempts to reconcile physical cosmology and religious cosmology. It is related to physicotheology, the difference between them being that the aim of physicotheology is to derive theology from physics, whereas that of theophysics is to unify physics and theology.\n\n (2002) uses the term in a critique of physicotheology, i.e. the view that arguments for the existence of God can be derived from the existence of the physical world (e.g. the \"argument from design\"). Theophysics would be the opposite approach, i.e. an approach to the material world informed by the knowledge that it is created by God.\n\nRichard H. Popkin (1990) applies the term to the \"spiritual physics\" of Cambridge Platonist Henry More and his pupil and collaborator Lady Anne Conway, who enthusiastically accepted the new science, but rejected the various forms of materialist mechanism proposed by Descartes, Hobbes and Spinoza to buttress it, as these, More and Conway argued, were incapable of explaining productive causality. Instead, More and Conway offered what Popkin calls \"a genuine important alternative to modern mechanistic thought\", \"a thoroughly scientific view with a metaphysics of spirits to make everything operate\". Materialist mechanism triumphed, however, and today their spiritual cosmology, as Popkin notes, \"looks very odd indeed\".\n\nThe term has been applied by some philosophers to the system of Emanuel Swedenborg. William Denovan (1889) wrote in \"Mind\": \"The highest stage of his revelation might be denominated \"Theophysics\", or the science of Divine purpose in creation.\" R. M. Wenley (1910) referred to Swedenborg as \"the Swedish theophysicist\".\n\nPierre Laberge (1972) observes that Kant's famous critique of physicotheology in the \"Critique of Pure Reason\" (1781; second edition 1787) has tended to obscure the fact that in his early work, \"General History of Nature and Theory of the Heavens\" (1755), Kant defended a physicotheology that at the time was startlingly original, but that succeeded only to the extent that it concealed what Laberge terms a theophysics (\"ce que nous appellerons une \"théophysique\"\").\n\nTheophysics is a fundamental concept in the thought of Raimon Panikkar, who wrote in \"Ontonomía de la ciencia\" (1961) that he was looking for \"a theological vision of Science that is not a Metaphysics, but a Theophysics... It is not a matter of a Physics 'of God', but rather of the 'God of the Physical'; of God the creator of the world... not the world as autonomous being, independent and disconnected from God, but rather ontonomicly linked to Him\". As a vision of \"Science as theology\", it became central to Panikkar's \"cosmotheandric\" view of reality.\n\nFrank J. Tipler's Omega Point theory (1994), which identifies concepts from physical cosmology with theistic concepts, is sometimes referred to by the term, although not by Tipler himself. Tipler was an atheist when he wrote \"The Anthropic Cosmological Principle\" (1986, co-authored with John D. Barrow, whose many popular books seldom mention theology) and \"The Physics of Immortality\" (1994), but a Christian when he wrote \"The Physics of Christianity\" (2007). In 1989, Wolfhart Pannenberg, a liberal theologian in the continental Protestant tradition, welcomed Tipler's work on cosmology as raising \"the prospect of a rapprochement between physics and theology in the area of eschatology\". In subsequent essays, while not concurring with all the details of Tipler's discussion, Pannenberg has defended the theology of the Omega Point.\n\nThe term is also occasionally used as a nonce word in parodies or humorous contexts, as by Aldous Huxley in \"Antic Hay\" (1923).\n\n\n\n"}

The show began unofficially using the title \"Maury\" in the 1995–1996 season, although its original title remained official until 1998, when Studios USA (now NBCUniversal) took over production and the show was officially retitled \"Maury\". MoPo has continued to co-produce with NBCUniversal. For the series' first 18 seasons, it was taped in New York City, but beginning with Season 19, the show has been taped at the Rich Forum in Stamford, Connecticut, which is alternately known as the Stamford Media Center. \"Maury\" is one of four NBC Universal syndicated properties to make the move to Connecticut, joining the formerly Chicago-based \"Jerry Springer\" (which ended in 2018, but currently airs in reruns) and \"Steve Wilkos\" shows. The fourth, the syndicated \"Deal or No Deal\", ended production in 2010 and would be revived by CNBC in 2018. \"The Trisha Goddard Show\" became the fourth show in production with NBC Universal (but would leave the air in 2014). As of 2007, NBC owned and operated stations no longer air \"Maury\".\n\nOn September 17, 2012, during the premiere of its 22nd season, episodes of \"Maury\" began airing in widescreen, though not in high definition. On September 15, 2014, starting with its 24th season, episodes of \"Maury\" started airing in high definition. In October 2014, \"Maury\" was renewed through September 2018. In June 2018, \"Maury\" was renewed again through the 2019–2020 television season.\n\nIn March 2020, Maury was renewed through the 2021–2022 season.\n\n\"Maury\" has dealt with a variety of issues across its 21 seasons, including—but not limited to—teenage pregnancy, sexual infidelity, paternity test results, uncommon illnesses, makeovers, \"out of control\" teenagers, transgender individuals, obese children, domestic violence, little people, bullying, and unusual phobias. After the taping of these episodes, guests are often tracked for progress, both on air and on the \"Maury\" website.\n\nThe show in its early years covered themes of a serious nature, including gang warfare.\n\nFrom 2008 onwards, the most common theme is paternity testing, followed by lie-detector testing (in more recent seasons, both paternity and lie detector testing have been featured in single episodes, and sometimes even within a single case). Abusive relationships and \"out-of-control\" teen girls are approximately tied for a distant third. Updates on previous guests are also a theme, while other themes such as missing children, transgender individuals, and \"caught on tape\" moments are featured 1–2 times a year.\n\nEpisodes featuring updates on past guests are periodically aired throughout the year. Guests either appear in person or by video message updating Maury on their situations. At the end of every year, Maury also does a countdown of the top 10 most memorable guests of the year, with updates on each guest.\n\nIn episodes that feature paternity or polygraph tests, some episodes cliffhang the first case and goes into commercial just before Maury reveals the results of the test(s), with the case concluding in the episode's last segment.\n\nOne of the most famous themes associated with Maury is paternity testing: a mother appears on-air attempting to prove (or disprove, in some cases) that a man is the biological father of her child or children. Often the mother will bring the child or children to the studio to prove her claim's validity to Maury, the audience, and the accused father. She will often say \"I'm 100%/1000% (or some other absurdly high amount) sure he is the father!\" Images of the father and child are displayed on the screen. She is occasionally accompanied by her mother or other family member, either on set or in the audience. In most cases, the accused father is hostile towards the accusing mother, giving various reasons (such as infidelity and sterility) why the child cannot be related to him, often saying \"The baby doesn't look like me\" and sometimes \"I can't have kids\", \"She never told me she was pregnant\", or \"She cheated on me\". Sometimes the accused father believes that the accusing mother is just after money. He is often booed loudly by the audience when coming out on the set. Both he and the mother occasionally have to be separated by Maury or security. The accused father is occasionally accompanied by his significant other or a family member to support his claim.\n\nIn other episodes, a man who has been a devoted dad for his child(ren)'s whole life/lives discovers that he might not be the biological father but might have suffered a paternity fraud (he discovers this either by infidelity suspicions/proof, or the wife may admit it to the husband on the show) and turn to a paternity test for proof.\n\nAfter the initial accusations, Maury sits the opposing parties down to read the results of a paternity test that had been performed before the show's taping. Before reading the results, Maury asks the man what he plans to do if the child is, in fact, his, and the man almost always responds by promising that he will provide for the child in that case. Maury then says \"When it comes to/In the case of [age and name of child], [man's name], 'You \"are\" the father!' or 'You are \"not\" the father!'\" After the results are revealed, the parties react accordingly; when the man is proven to be the father, the mother often will celebrate, whereas if the man is proven not to be the father, he jumps out of his chair and celebrates, while the mother runs or walks backstage in humiliation, sometimes hiding in a green room or bathroom, or sometimes, running through the exit and demanding that cameras stop rolling. Maury follows her to console her, saying \"We'll be glad to help you find the father\". In either case, the audience cheers loudly for the victorious party, who often celebrates with over the top dancing or gymnastics. A follow-up episode often checks up on the story a few weeks or months later. Mothers often return on future episodes to test more potential fathers.\n\nSome episodes of the series deal with infidelity in relationships. Despite the findings of the United States Supreme Court that \"There is simply no consensus that polygraph evidence is reliable,\" the accused individual is attached to a polygraph machine prior to the show's taping and asked questions about the theme at hand (or will sometimes admit secrets to his/her partner). The person who suspects his or her partner is cheating will explain to Maury his or her suspicions then a video is often shown of the accused partner telling their side of the story and denying the accusations. He or she then comes on stage being loudly booed by the audience. Both parties sometimes have to be separated by Maury or security. When the results are revealed by Maury, he typically says \"You were asked if you had sexual intercourse with any other woman during your relationship with (significant other's name). You said no, and the lie detector determined that was a lie/you are telling the truth.\" If a person is found to be lying, Ralph Barberi, the lie detector administrator, occasionally will appear and explain that the person had \"significant reactions\" to one or more questions. In rare circumstances, the accused individual would admit his/her affairs while being tested (result: \"You admitted to our lie detector administrator you've done so.\"), or the person refuses to answer a specific question. Other times, an individual will maintain their innocence despite the test results (sometimes claiming that the test was \"hacked\" or that the lie detector machine was \"broken\" or otherwise defective or malfunctional), and ask to re-take the lie detector test.\n\nIn some cases, Maury and the show's producers would settle the accused in a \"green room,\" where either a buddy or a sexy decoy would appear as another guest of the show in order to get to the whole truth. Additionally, in some cases the person who suspects that their partner is cheating on them will also take a polygraph test asking the same questions; in a few cases, this has brought the ironically uncomfortable situation of the accusing partner being proven to have committed adultery, especially if it was revealed that the person who was originally accused did not cheat on their partner.\n\nSome episodes of the series deal with individuals who wish to reveal a secret to their loved ones. The segment usually begins with the person wishing to tell the secret on stage with Maury and he/she goes through the story with the loved one being secluded backstage. Next, the wife/girlfriend/husband/boyfriend is brought out, and soon after the secret is told. The wife/girlfriend/husband/boyfriend will often walk or run off the stage, with the person telling the secret chasing after them apologizing. Maury follows them to bring them back on the stage. However, it may occasionally result in a positive reaction from the wife/girlfriend/husband/boyfriend. A video is often shown of the third party involved in the secret apologizing and asking for forgiveness before he/she comes on stages being loudly booed by the audience.\n\nIn some segments, the third party involved in the secret may also appear on the show. Secrets revealing a man may not be the father of their children can sometimes result in a paternity test.\n\nSome episodes in the series also deal with abusive relationships where men believe it is their right to control and abuse the women they love. In these episodes, women currently in relationships with controlling and abusive men appear on the show for help. These men are brought to the studio and booed loudly by the audience. They will oftenly say things such as \"It's a man's world\" or \"A woman is here to serve a man\", and some say they were taught by their fathers to control women and teach their children likewise. A lot of the times they will emotionally and physically abuse women if they feel the women are not following their rules (e.g., when they can and can't see their family and friends, not allowing them to see other men, how they are to serve the men their food, how the men are to be addressed as, when and where they can sleep, etc.). In some episodes, the men may also inspect their woman's body on a consistent basis to make sure their wife or girlfriend does not cheat on them. These men are also brought to the studio and publicly rebel against their girlfriend, fiance, or wife and refuse to listen to their pleas. They will often publicly rebel against the audience as well.\n\nIn an attempt to help both the women who are being controlled and to stop the men's controlling ways, Povich brings in a variety of guests, from women who were previously in an abusive relationship to mothers of daughters in abusive relationships; in one episode, a former guest, a man who changed his controlling ways after his first appearance on the show, was brought in. After the show, the men are transported to a location in an attempt to scare them into acting differently; mostly the place was a funeral home (the abused women are in coffins to appear as if they are deceased); other times the place was a homeless shelter. In a few episodes, the places were prisons. Usually, the tables are turned and they are made to follow the rules (e.g., serve the women food in a different manner than their abusive manner).\n\nWhen the men return to the studio, they often apologize for their behavior. Occasionally, couples return because the men, who stop the abuse, are suspected of cheating on the same women they beat.\n\nIn these episodes, distressed mothers or family members of delinquent teenage girls turn to \"Maury\" for help. These teenagers often have issues dealing with drug addiction, promiscuity, prostitution, shoplifting, gang involvement, partying, the strong desire to become pregnant at a young age, or some combination of these. More simply, the show usually deals with violent teens or teens who wish to have a baby (sometimes both). These teens are brought to the studio and booed loudly by the audience. They often publicly rebel against their parents/guardians/foster carers and refuse to listen to their pleas. Usually, they will tell the audience to \"Shut Up!\" as well as \"You Don't Know Me\", for many reasons. They may also use derogatory language towards the audience as well or dance in a provocative manner. Often the girls wear revealing clothing.\n\nFormer prostitutes and teen moms, as well as motivational speakers and police officers often share their stories with the girls, or attempt to motivate them to improve themselves. In recent episodes, Maury recruits a combination of Trisha Goddard (Conflict Resolution Expert), Raphael B. Johnson (Motivational Speaker), and Dave Vitalli (Special Ops Expert) to help reform the teens. Afterward, the girls are transported to a location in an attempt to scare them into acting differently; sometimes these places have been prisons, other times the girls have been forced to partake in boot camp activities, and often are shown that they could end up dead or homeless if they don't change.\n\nFor the first 18 seasons, \"Maury\" episodes were taped back-to-back at the Grand Ballroom of the Hotel Pennsylvania in New York City. The studio shared the facility in the Hotel Pennsylvania with \"The People's Court\" until the show relocated studios in 1998, and \"The Sally Jessy Raphael Show\" until its cancellation in 2002.\n\nFor the 2009-10 season, production was moved from New York City to Stamford, Connecticut, where the series is now taped at the Stamford Media Center, along with \"The Jerry Springer Show\" and \"The Steve Wilkos Show\". This move was made in part because Connecticut offered NBC a tax credit if production of these three series was moved to the state.\n\nSince 2009, the \"Maury Show\" has been filmed in the same studio hall as the \"Steve Wilkos Show\", and until 2018, the \"Jerry Springer Show\". A large overhead crane is used to hoist the centerpiece backdrop during conversions for show filming. It takes about 3 hours and a crew of about 15 decorators and electricians to convert the studio set from one show to the other. When a guest runs backstage on the \"Maury\", it is not uncommon to see \"Steve Wilkos\" or \"Springer\" set props come into view. This is also vice-versa.\n\nStudio audience members obtain free tickets to the taping of \"Maury\" via the show's official website.\n\nThe series is edited to meet FCC regulations for indecency and obscenity, including bleeping of profane language and pixelization of nudity, though other censoring does take place; the series purposefully has guests avoid using their last names, mainly for the protection of minors and outside third parties, and said mentions of last names by guests (except for the show's rotation of experts) are bleeped in line with this policy. Additionally, no \"uncut\" versions of the show exist.\n\nTwo well publicized advertising methods on \"Maury\" relate to the hiring of interns as well as polling the television audience with the allure of \"valuable offers\". The latter is also a promotional tactic used on the show \"Divorce Court\".\n\nThe show is known for promoting an in-house \"intern program\", encouraging college students to apply for employment. In a 2010, a United States Department of Education report indicated:\n\nThe talk show \"Maury\" is abusing government programs sponsored by the Department of Education. This production is attempting to prove that there is an overwhelming demand for interns and has solicited applications from hundreds of different institutions of higher learning. The interns are almost never hired; however, the production has applied under several clauses for government funding under claims that a large number of internships have been granted.\n\n\"Maury\", like several daytime programs, also has a phone-in survey segment, a feature which has drawn criticism from some as the survey also features third-party \"valuable offers\" which may offer the purchase of some kind of product, but also give an inroad to telemarketers to round do not call lists, as the interaction technically counts as allowing those calls past do not call lists, and may place the number called from on 'do call' phone lists used by the telemarketing industry.\n\n\"Maury\" has been nominated once, in 2017, for the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Talk Show Entertainment, losing to \"The Ellen DeGeneres Show\".\n\nSome critics denounce \"Maury\" as being worse than other similar talk shows, such as \"The Jerry Springer Show\". Like such shows, it uses guests' serious problems for the entertainment of the viewing audience, but treated with an insincere sympathy. Whitney Matheson wrote about the show in her \"USA Today\" column, \"Povich's talk show is, without a doubt, the worst thing on television. Period. Don't be fooled by the pressed shirt and pleated khakis; Maury is miles farther down the commode than Jerry Springer.\"\n\n\n\n"}

It originates from eastern Mexico and the Bay of Campeche as a post-frontal northerly wind, accelerated southward by cold air damming, which crosses the isthmus and blows through the gap between the Mexican and Guatemalan mountains. The term dates back to at least 1929. This wind can reach gale, storm, even hurricane force. The leading edge of its outflow (or cold front) may form rope cloud over the Gulf of Tehuantepec. These winds can be observed on satellite pictures such as scatterometer wind measurements, they influence waves which then propagate as swell and are sometimes observed away (such as in the Galapagos Islands). These strong winds bring cooler sub-surface waters to the surface of the tropical eastern Pacific Ocean and may last from a few hours to 6 days.\n\nThe synoptic condition is associated with high-pressure system forming in Sierra Madre in the wake of an advancing cold front. Tehuantepecers primarily occur during the cold season months for the region in the wake of cold fronts, between October and February, with a summer minimum in July caused by the westward extension of the Azores-Bermuda high pressure system. Wind magnitude is greater during El Niño years than during La Niña years, due to the more frequent cold frontal incursions during El Niño winters. Tehuantepec winds reach to , and on rare occasions . The wind's direction is from the north to north-northeast. It leads to a localized acceleration of the trade winds in the region, and can enhance thunderstorm activity when it interacts with the Intertropical Convergence Zone. The effects can last from a few hours to six days.\n\nIts leading edge shows up as a rope cloud within the visible and infrared channels of weather satellite images, and since it lies at the leading edge of a density (temperature and dew point) discontinuity, its leading edge by definition it is a cold front, though it has also been described as a squall line, with embedded rain squalls sometimes seen. Within polar orbiting imagery, a corridor of strong low-level winds show up this feature within scatterometer data retrievals, with its leading edge at the south to southwest edge of the wind surge.\n\nTehuantepecers can be felt up to out to sea in the tropical eastern Pacific Ocean. Sustained winds at sea have been recorded as high as , with gusts as high as , with a wind event in February 1974 which sandblasted the ship which took the observation. These winds cause waves which then propagate as swell and are sometimes observed away (e.g., in the Galapagos Islands). Its effects can appear similar to a tropical cyclone, though the sky is usually clear. The surface wind can also change local ocean currents during an event. These strong winds upwell sub-surface waters, cooling the tropical eastern Pacific Ocean by as much as 14 °F (9 °C), and may last 4–7 days.\n\n"}

The term was introduced in the 1930s by the linguist Leonard Bloomfield, who defined it as the smallest meaningful unit of grammatical form (analogous to the morpheme, defined as the smallest meaningful unit of lexical form). The term was later adopted, and its meaning broadened, by Kenneth Pike and others beginning in the 1950s, as the basis for their tagmemics.\n\nAccording to the scheme set out by Leonard Bloomfield in his book \"Language\" (1933), the tagmeme is the smallest meaningful unit of grammatical form. A tagmeme consists of one or more taxemes, where a taxeme is a primitive grammatical feature, in the same way that a phoneme is a primitive phonological feature. Taxemes and phonemes do not as a rule have meaning on their own, but combine into tagmemes and morphemes respectively, which carry meaning.\n\nFor example, an utterance such as \"John runs\" is a concrete example of a tagmeme (an allotagm) whose meaning is that an actor performs an action. The taxemes making up this tagmeme include the selection of a nominative expression, the selection of a finite verb expression, and the ordering of the two such that the nominative expression precedes the finite verb expression.\n\nBloomfield makes the taxeme and tagmeme part of a system of emic units:\n\nMore generally, he defines any meaningful unit of linguistic signaling (not necessarily smallest) as a \"linguistic form\", and its meaning as a \"linguistic meaning\"; it may be either a \"lexical form\" (with a \"lexical meaning\") or a \"grammatical form\" (with a \"grammatical meaning\").\n\nBloomfield's term was adopted by Kenneth Pike and others to denote what they had previously been calling the \"grammeme\" (earlier \"grameme\"). In Pike's approach, consequently called \"tagmemics\", the hierarchical organization of levels (e.g. in syntax: word, phrase, sentence, paragraph, discourse) results from the fact that the elements of a tagmeme on a higher level (e.g. 'sentence') are analyzed as syntagmemes on the next lower level (e.g. 'phrase').\n\nThe tagmeme is the correlation of a syntagmatic function (e.g. subject, object) and paradigmatic fillers (e.g. nouns, pronouns or proper nouns as possible fillers of the subject position). Tagmemes combine to form a syntagmeme, a syntactic construction consisting of a sequence of tagmemes.\n\nTagmemics as a linguistic methodology was developed by Pike in his book \"Language in Relation to a Unified Theory of the Structure of Human Behavior\", 3 vol. (1954–1960). It was primarily designed to assist linguists to efficiently extract coherent descriptions out of corpora of fieldwork data. Tagmemics is particularly associated with the Summer Institute of Linguistics, an association of missionary linguists devoted largely to Bible translations, of which Pike was an early member.\n\nTagmemics makes the kind of distinction made between phone and phoneme in phonology and phonetics at higher levels of linguistic analysis (grammatical and semantic); for instance, contextually conditioned synonyms are considered different instances of a single tagmeme, as sounds which are (in a given language) contextually conditioned are allophones of a single phoneme. The emic and etic distinction also applies in other social sciences.\n\n\n"}

Samuel Blachley Webb (1753–1807), a Revolutionary officer of distinction. At age 12, he moved to Cooperstown, New York to live with his brother-in-law and guardian, Judge George Morrell.\n\nHe entered the United States Army in August 1819, advanced to the grade of first lieutenant in 1823, and in the following year became assistant commissary of subsistence.\n\nIn September 1820, a party led by Lewis Cass, governor of the Michigan Territory, on its return from the exploration of the source waters of the Mississippi River, encountered Lt. Webb and a small group of soldiers at the mouth of the Black River in what is now Port Huron, Michigan. H.R. Schoolcraft, historian of the trip, said Webb and his men were returning to Fort Gratiot, a frontier outpost, with a boat full of freshly harvested watermelon.\n\nIn the fall of 1827, he resigned from the army to become a newspaper publisher, purchasing the \"Morning Courier\" which he published in the interest of General Jackson. In 1829, he purchased the \"New York Enquirer\", which he consolidated with the \"Courier\" under the title of the \"New York Courier and Enquirer\". He remained connected with this paper for more than 30 years. Historian Don C. Seitz wrote of those days: \n\nIn 1834, Webb used the \"Courier and Enquirer\" to coin the name of a new political party: the Whigs. Webb had formerly been a supporter of Jackson, but no longer. That same year he recycled or invented extravagant rumors of miscegenation, that the abolitionists had counselled their daughters to marry blacks, and Lewis Tappan had divorced his wife to marry a black woman, and that the Presbyterian minister Henry Ludlow was conducting interracial marriages, which fueled the organized mob violence of New York's anti-abolitionist riots that June.\n\nIn 1849, Webb was appointed minister to Austria, but the appointment was not confirmed. In 1851, he was appointed engineer-in-chief for the State of New York with the rank of Brigadier General, but refused to accept the appointment. \n\nIn 1861, he was appointed minister to Turkey, but even though it had been confirmed by the United States Senate, he declined. According to biographer Glyndon Van Deusen, \"Webb, an inveterate beggar for office, wanted a diplomatic appointment that would be lucrative.\"\n\nShortly afterward, Webb was appointed minister to Brazil and served in that position for eight years, resigning when he was accused of extorting a large sum of money from the Brazilian government. At Paris in 1864, Webb claimed he was instrumental to negotiating a secret treaty with Emperor Napoleon III for the removal of French troops from Mexico.\n\nAbraham Lincoln's biographer, Carl Sandburg, wrote that Webb \"believed that Lincoln should have appointed him major general, rating himself a grand strategist, having fought white men in duels and red men in frontier war.\" In 1869, he resigned the mission to Brazil, and returned to live in New York.\n\nOn July 1, 1823, Webb was married to Helen Lispenard Stewart (1805–1848). Helen was the daughter of Irish born merchant Alexander L. Stewart and Sarah Amelia (née Lispenard) Stewart (the granddaughter of Leonard Lispenard).

The original music score was composed by Stanley Myers. The story is loosely based on the formative years of Cynthia Payne.\n\nSixteen-year-old Lynda Mansell lives in a small English seaside town in the early 1950s. She is feisty, outspoken and precocious and tries to shock other people with her histrionic behaviour and vulgar tongue (her favourite insult is \"Up yer bum\"). Bored with conventional jobs (which she frequently loses) and her town's dull young men, Lynda has her first sexual experience with Dave but after she has slept with one of her father's middle-aged friends, her life changes. She becomes pregnant and her father, a somewhat rigid and conventional man, disowns her. Desperately she tries to seek an illegal abortion but in the end decides to become a mother.\n\nThe film was based loosely on the memoirs of the British madam Cynthia Payne as an adolescent growing up on the Sussex coast.

It is also the first in the franchise to feature first-person shooting alongside the third-person movement seen in its predecessors in the \"Resident Evil\" series. It was developed by Cavia.\n\n\"Dead Aim\" uses a third-person view when moving, but switches to a first-person view when aiming and firing a weapon, with a dot in the center of the screen to help the player aim. It is one of the few \"Resident Evil\" games that allows the player to move while aiming, and the game also supports the PS2 light gun and USB mouse.\n\nIn 2002, 4 years after the \"Raccoon City Incident,\" the Umbrella-owned ocean liner, \"Spencer Rain\", has been infested by the T-Virus stolen from Umbrella's Paris labs by bioterrorist and former-Umbrella employee Morpheus D. Duvall, and its secret B.O.W. cargo intentionally released. Morpheus holds the world hostage, with the U.S. and China at ransom for $1 billion - if they do not pay the money, his followers will launch missiles from an undisclosed silo with the warheads being replaced with the t-Virus. Bruce McGivern, a member of USSTRATCOM's \"Anti-Umbrella Pursuit Investigation Team,\" a U.S. government task force with the sole purpose of taking down Umbrella, is sent in. Alongside him is Fong Ling, sent by the Chinese M.S.S. Although they share the same goals and common enemy, their respective governments are against working together.\n\nDuring Bruce's investigation, he is found by Morpheus and held at gunpoint on the foredeck. A surprise attack by Fong Ling with a grenade allows Bruce to escape into the ship, with Morpheus being injured in the explosion. He later infects himself with the experimental \"T+G Virus\" in order to avoid an otherwise-fatal wound. After a brief encounter with the mutated Morpheus in the cargo hold, Bruce escapes into engineering with the aid of Fong Ling. Restoring power to parts of the ship and discovering important items, the two gain access to the bridge - with Bruce killing the infected captain in the search - to find that the \"Spencer Rain\" is on a collision course with a nearby island. Running outside to escape the ship, Bruce is forced to fight Tyrant 091, which had escaped containment before Bruce's encounter with Morpheus. Once it is defeated, Bruce jumps into the ocean and swims to the shore as the liner is destroyed.\n\nBriefly exploring the island, which is shown to contain an abandoned Umbrella facility, Bruce moves down into its waterways in search of Morpheus. Making his way through a series of underwater channels, he discovers that the island was used as a waste disposal facility for failed B.O.W.s until it was recently lost in a biohazardous outbreak. Deeper in the facility, Fong Ling has escaped from \"Pluto,\" a failed experiment that Umbrella lost track of, later rejoining with Morpheus. It is at this point that they discover that the Chinese have given in to Morpheus' demands and have agreed to pay up, arranging for an orbital weapons satellite to kill Fong Ling with a targeted laser device. Bruce correctly deduces that the satellite is tracking a chip in her tattoo, and proceeds to dig it out with a knife. With the chip destroyed, the satellite ceases its attack. The two make their way to a storage facility to transport to the underwater Bio-Sphere where the missile silo is a part of, but Bruce is forced to fight Pluto before he can reach it.\n\nWith the Pluto defeated, the two make their way down the elevator; Morpheus makes a sudden reappearance, sending the elevator crashing to the seafloor. The two operatives survive the crash and explore the facility, finding that Morpheus' own bioterrorist organization has already been compromised by another t-Virus outbreak. Fong Ling is captured by Morpheus, who uses her to play a game with Bruce - try to save her, or abandon her to complete the mission. Bruce chooses to save her, allowing Fong Ling to provide logistical support as he searches for the missiles. Unfortunately, a greatly mutated Morpheus prevents him from reaching the missiles in time, though further damage causes the G-mutant to expand to such a size that the missiles simply impact him and explode.\n\nBruce and Fong Ling are revealed to have escaped the underwater facility's destruction by the use of an escape boat floating to the surface. With her own government believing her dead, Fong Ling has nowhere to go but the United States; Bruce re-assures her, and they kiss as US-STRATCOM sends in a helicopter to pick them up.\n\n\n\"Dead Aim\" was announced in 2002 as a PlayStation 2 game expected to be released in Japan some time in 2003. Like \"Gun Survivor 2\", it was not expected to be released into the United States at the time.\n\n\"Dead Aim\" was developed using a modified version of the id Tech 3 engine, the same engine used in games such as Quake III Arena, Return to Castle Wolfenstein, and Call of Duty, the game also features the ending theme \"Gun Shot\" by J-Rock band Rize.\n\nCapcom's January 15, 2003 press release demonstrated a working build of the game, revealing that, unlike the previous three \"Gun Survivor\" titles, \"Gun Survivor 4\" (planned to be known as \"Resident Evil: Dead Aim\" to the now-confirmed U.S. and European markets) would interchange between first- and third-person camera angles depending on whether or not the player is aiming a weapon. The GunCon 2 light-gun controller was also confirmed to be compatible with the game. The conference expected a June 2003 release date.\n\nDespite its June release, \"Dead Aim\" still made an appearance at E3 2003 just a month prior alongside the Nintendo GameCube release of \"\" and \"Resident Evil Outbreak\".\n\n\"Dead Aim\" had a mixed reception. GameSpot gave it a 6.4 saying, \"It's not the best \"Resident Evil\" game, and it isn't a stellar light-gun game, but \"Dead Aim\" creates an interesting, unique hybrid of the two, and that is a commendable feat.\" IGN gave it a 6.9 praising it as the best in the \"Gun Survivor\" series, having stellar graphics, but criticized it for its cheesy dialogue and unoriginal premise. X-Play gave the game a 4/5 citing the improved graphics and controls from previous attempts.\n\nThe 2005 crossover game \"Namco × Capcom\" featured Bruce and Ling as playable characters.\n"}
{"id": "2268516", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2268516", "title": "Nuckelavee", "text": "Nuckelavee\n\nThe nuckelavee () or nuckalavee is a horse-like demon from Orcadian mythology that combines equine and human elements. It has its origins in Norse mythology, and British folklorist Katharine Briggs called it \"the nastiest\" of all the demons of Scotland's Northern Isles. The nuckelavee's breath was thought to wilt crops and sicken livestock, and the creature was held responsible for droughts and epidemics on land despite being predominantly a sea-dweller.\n\nA graphic description of the nuckelavee as it appears on land was given by an islander who claimed to have had a confrontation with it, but accounts describing the details of the creature's appearance are inconsistent. In common with many other sea monsters it is unable to tolerate fresh water, therefore those it is pursuing have only to cross a river or stream to be rid of it. The nuckelavee is kept in confinement during the summer months by the Mither o' the Sea, an ancient Orcadian spirit, and the only one able to control it.\n\nOrcadian folklore had a strong Scandinavian influence, and it may be that the nuckelavee is a composite of a water horse from Celtic mythology and a creature imported by the Norsemen. As with similar malevolent entities such as the kelpie, it possibly offered an explanation for incidents that islanders in ancient times could not otherwise understand.\n\nThe late 19th century saw an upsurge of interest in transcribing folklore, but the recorders used inconsistent spelling and frequently anglicised words, thus the same entity could be given different names. The term \"nuckelavee\" derives from Orcadian \"knoggelvi\", and according to Orkney resident and 19th-century folklorist Walter Traill Dennison means \"Devil of the Sea\". The same demon is called a \"mukkelevi\" in Shetland, where it was considered a nasty sea trow or sea devil. Samuel Hibbert, an antiquarian of the early nineteenth century, considered the component \"nuck\" of the nuckelavee's name to be cognate with both the \"Nick\" in Old Nick, a name sometimes given to the Devil of Christian belief, and with the Latin \"necare\", to kill.\n\nStories of mythical Orcadian demons are recorded in the 16th-century Latin manuscripts of Jo Ben, who may have been referring to the nuckelavee in his description of the Orkney island of Stronsay. Dennison transcribed much of the information available about traditional tales told on Orkney, but to an extent romanticised and systematically altered certain elements of the stories in the process of transforming them into prose.\n\nThe nuckelavee is a mythical sea creature that appears as a horse-like demon when it ventures onto land. Writer and folklorist Ernest Marwick considered it very similar to the Norwegian nøkk, the nuggle of Shetland and the kelpie. A unique and solitary creature possessing extensive evil powers, its malevolent behaviour can influence events throughout the islands. Islanders were terrified of the creature and would not speak its name without immediately saying a prayer. It was often found in the vicinity of a beach, but would never come ashore if it was raining.\n\nNo tales describe what form the nuckelavee takes when in the sea, but its appearance on land has been recounted in graphic detail. An islander, Tammas, claimed to have survived a confrontation with the beast and, after much cajoling from Dennison, reluctantly gave his description of the monster, the only known first-hand account. According to Tammas, the nuckelavee has a man's torso attached to a horse's back as if it were a rider. The male torso has no legs, but its arms can reach the ground from its position on top of the equine body, the legs of which have fin like appendages. The torso has a large head – possibly as much as in diameter – that rolls back and forth. The monster described by Tammas has two heads; the equine head has an enormous gaping mouth that exudes a smelly toxic vapour, and a single giant eye like a burning red flame. A particularly gruesome detail is that the nuckelavee has no skin; black blood courses through yellow veins, and the pale sinews and powerful muscles are visible as a pulsating mass. Other reports state that the creature resembles a centaur; narratives are inconsistent in the finer details of the demon's description however. Traill Dennison only describes a man's head with a \"mouth projected like that of a pig\". Marwick also only mentions one head with a single red eye, and he borrows some of Tammas's characterisation by recording the creature's mouth as \"like a whale's\".\n\nThe nuckelavee's breath was thought to wilt crops and sicken livestock, and it was considered responsible for epidemics and drought. Seaweed burning to create what was known at the time as \"kelp\" began on Stronsay in 1722. The product – soda ash – was an alkali mainly used to treat acidic soil, although as time went on its commercial importance in soap and glass manufacture increased. The pungent smoke emitted during the process was believed to enrage the nuckelavee, resulting in a wild rampage of plague, the deaths of cattle and the destruction of crops. The nuckelavee was said to have infected horses on Stronsay with the deadly disease known as mortasheen, to demonstrate its fury and exact its revenge against the islanders for burning seaweed; the infection subsequently spread to all the other islands involved in the industry. The creature was also blamed for prolonged periods of abnormally low rainfall, leading to water shortages and poor harvests.\n\nThe nuckelavee is the most malevolent of the demons in and around the Scottish islands, without any redeeming characteristics. The only entity able to control it is the Mither o' the Sea, an ancient spirit in Orcadian mythology who keeps the nuckelavee confined during the summer months. In common with other mythical sea monsters, with the possible exception of kelpies and the nuggle of Shetland, it is unable to wade through fresh flowing water, therefore it can be escaped by crossing a stream. Tammas managed to escape from the nuckelavee after he inadvertently splashed it with water from the loch he was alongside; this briefly distracted the monster, allowing Tammas to run over to a nearby channel of fresh water and jump to safety on the opposite bank.\n\nMalevolent creatures possibly served to provide explanations for incidents that islanders were otherwise unable to account for; many ancient myths were based upon the natural elements of the turbulent and ever changing sea around Orkney. Established Orcadian tales were strongly influenced by Scandinavian mythology with a blending of traditional Celtic stories, so the nuckelavee may have its roots in a mythical creature imported by the Norsemen fused with a traditional Celtic water horse.\n\n"}

Hence a game of Go may easily explore an unfamiliar path.\n\nOnly a proportion of fusekis have recognised or specific names. These include the two-star fuseki (\"nirensei fuseki\"), three-star fuseki (\"sanrensei fuseki\"), Chinese fuseki, Kobayashi fuseki, and Shusaku fuseki. These are names for the influential formations which Black makes in the opening.\n\nAs played on a large board (e.g. the standard 19x19 line goban), traditional wisdom says the priority is to play corner enclosures, then to extend to the middle of the sides, and finally to the center because it is easier to secure territory in the corners than on the sides or in the center. The classical view, particularly for the 3-3, 3-4 or 4-3 point, emphasizes good points to play in the opening because these points ensure larger and/or faster corner enclosure. Higher points are discouraged. This approach has clearer goals (control territory in the corners) and is easier for beginners to grasp and play.\n\nUnlike the territory-oriented playing style, this approach emphasizes control of the center. The reason for this is that one's play should not be narrowly focused on attempting to secure points quickly by occupying the corners first. Although it requires more effort to secure the center, it constitutes the majority of territory on the board. The key is to build a good framework in order to control the center of the board. Higher points like 4-4, 4-5 or 5-4 are encouraged. Some players occupy the side very quickly in order to build up a good framework, while some place their stones around the center. However, the influence-oriented approach is more abstract and harder for beginners to grasp and play.\n\nThe development of fuseki was very limited in the distant past, because nearly all players' efforts were put into making corner plays and enclosures (Joseki). Until about 1900, professional players made use only of a relatively small proportion of the currently established patterns in the opening. The range of possibilities is great, and the number of game records from high-level play that are actually published is not so large (even now a few thousand a year, only).\n\nFuseki did not see significant improvement until the influence-oriented style of play evolved in the 20th century. Perhaps the most highly regarded pioneer player of the 20th century, Go Seigen, created an uproar when he played his third move (black 5) on the tengen, or center point in a game against the reigning Honinbo Shusai. An unwise move in classical thinking, it was considered an insult to someone of the Honinbo's stature. Go Seigen lost the controversial 4-month game (which is believed to be due to help from one of the Honinbo's students), but proved his ability against high-ranking opponents, even when employing such an unusual strategy.\n\nThe concept of influence-oriented play gave birth to many revolutionary fuseki such as the two-star fuseki (\"nirensei fuseki\"), three-star fuseki (\"sanrensei fuseki\") and so on. Many similar patterns have been tried and played in modern games.\n\nThe Chinese fuseki, which was popularized by Chinese players in the 1970s, has a thoroughly-researched theory.\n\nSince around 1990, there has been a succession of fashionable openings, largely a product of Korean professionals, which have been studied and played in a more chess-like manner (that is, with successive refinements hammered out in high-profile games). This style of innovation is actually something new to the go tradition, however; it is not the traditional way, and there is a large part of go strategy that remains unexplored to that degree of intensity.\n\n\n"}

The latter are called plasmalogens.\n\nIn mammals, the sn-1 position is typically derived from C16:0, C18:0, or C18:1 fatty alcohols while the sn-2 position is most commonly occupied by polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). The most common head groups present in mammalian plasmalogens are ethanolamine (designated plasmenylethalomines) or choline (designated plasmenylcholines).\n\nPlasmalogens are found in numerous human tissues, with particular enrichment in the nervous, immune, and cardiovascular system. In human heart tissue, nearly 30–40% of choline glycerophospholipids are plasmalogens. Even more striking is the fact that 32% of the glycerophospholipids in the adult human heart and 20% in brain and up to 70% of myelin sheath ethanolamine glycerophospholipids are plasmalogens.\n\nAlthough the functions of plasmalogens have not yet been fully elucidated, it has been demonstrated that they can protect mammalian cells against the damaging effects of reactive oxygen species. In addition, they have been implicated as being signaling molecules and modulators of membrane dynamics.\n\nPlasmalogens were first described by Feulgen and Voit in 1924 based on studies of tissue sections. They treated these tissue sections with acid or mercuric chloride as part of a method to stain the nucleus. This resulted in the breakage of the plasmalogen vinyl-ether bond to yield aldehydes. In turn, the latter reacted with a fuchsine-sulfurous acid stain used in this nuclear staining method and gave rise to colored compounds inside the cytoplasm of the cells. Plasmalogens were named based on the fact that these colored compounds were present in the \"plasmal\" or inside of the cell.\n\nBiosynthesis of plasmalogens (PLs) begins with association of peroxisomal matrix enzymes GNPAT (glycerone phosphate acyl transferase) and AGPS (alkyl-glycerone phosphate synthase)\non the luminal side of the peroxisomal membrane.\nThese two enzymes can physically interact with each other to increase efficiency. Therefore, fibroblasts without AGPS activity have a reduced GNPAT level and activity.\n\nThe first step of the biosynthesis is catalyzed by GNPAT. This enzyme acylates dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) at the sn-1 position. This is followed by the exchange of the acyl group for an alkyl group by AGPS.\nThe 1-alkyl-DHAP is then reduced to 1-O-alkyl-2-hydroxy-sn-glycerophosphate (GPA) by an acyl/alkyl-DHAP reductase located in both peroxisomal and endoplasmatic reticulum (ER) membranes.\nAll other modifications occur in the ER. There an acyl group is placed at the sn-2 position by an alkyl/acyl GPA acyltransferase and the phosphate group is removed by a phosphatidic acid phosphatase to form 1-O-alkyl-2-acyl-sn-glycerol.\nUsing CDP-ethanolamine a phosphotransferase forms 1-O-alkyl-2-acyl-sn-GPEtn. After dehydrogenation at the 1- and 2-positions of the\nalkyl group by an electron transport system and plasmanylethanolamine desaturase the vinyl ether bond of plasmalogens is finally formed.The protein corresponding to plasmanylethanolamine desaturase has been identified and is called CarF in bacteria and TMEM189 in humans (and animals).\nPlasmenylcholine is formed from 1-O-alkyl-2-acyl-sn-glycerol by choline phosphotransferase. As there is no plasmenylcholine desaturase choline plasmalogens can be formed only after hydrolysis of ethanolamine PLs to 1-O-(1Z-alkenyl)-2-acyl-sn-glycerol that can be modified by choline phosphotransferase and CDP choline.\n\nPeroxisome biogenesis disorders are autosomal recessive disorders often characterized by impaired plasmalogen biosynthesis. In these cases, the peroxisomal enzyme GNPAT, necessary for the initial steps of plasmalogen biosynthesis, is mislocalized to the cytoplasm where it is inactive. In addition, genetic mutations in the \"GNPAT\" or \"AGPS\" genes can result in plasmalogen deficiencies, which lead to the development of rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata (RCDP) type 2 or 3, respectively. In such cases, both copies of the \"GNPAT\" or \"AGPS\" gene must be mutated in order for disease to manifest. Unlike the peroxisome biogenesis disorders, other aspects of peroxisome assembly in RCDP2 and RCDP3 patients are normal as is their ability to metabolize very long chain fatty acids. Individuals with severe plasmalogen deficiencies frequently show abnormal neurological development, skeletal malformation, impaired respiration, and cataracts.\nDeficits in plasmalogen levels contribute to pathology in Zellweger syndrome.\n\nPlasmalogen-knockout mice show similar alterations like \narrest of spermatogenesis, development of cataract and defects in central nervous system myelination.\n\nDuring inflammation, neutrophil-derived myeloperoxidase produces hypochlorous acid (HOCl). HOCl causes oxidative chlorination of plasmalogens at the sn-1 chain by reacting with the vinyl ether bond. Several researchers are currently investigating the impact of chlorinated lipids on pathology.\n\nThe lack of good methods to assay plasmalogen has created difficulties for scientists to assess how plasmalogen might be involved in human diseases other than RCDP and Zellweger spectrum, in which the involvement is certain. There is some evidence in humans that low plasmalogens are involved in the pathology of bronchopulmonary dysplasia, which is an important complication of premature birth. and one study shows that plasmalogen levels are reduced in people with COPD who smoked compared with non-smokers. There is some evidence from humans and animals that there are reduced levels of plasmalogens in the brain in neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer disease, Parkinson's disease, Niemann–Pick disease, type C, Down syndrome, and multiple sclerosis, but as of 2012 it was not clear if the deficit was causing, or being caused by, the disease processes.\n\nIn addition to mammals, plasmalogens are also found in invertebrates and single cell organisms protozoans. Among bacteria they have been found in many anaerobic species including \"Clostridia\", \"Megasphaera\", and \"Veillonella\". Among aerobic bacteria, plasmalogens occur in myxobacteria, and their plasmanylethanolamine desaturase (CarF) \nrequired to generate the vinyl ether bond, and hence plasmalogen, is conserved as TMEM189 in humans (and animals). Plasmalogens have been shown to have a complex evolutionary history based on the fact that their biosynthetic pathways differ in aerobic and anaerobic organisms.\n\nRecently, it has been demonstrated that the red blood cells of humans and great apes (chimpanzees, bonobos, gorillas and orangutans) have differences in their plasmalogen composition. Total RBC plasmalogen levels were found to be lower in humans than in bonobos, chimpanzees, or gorillas, but higher than in orangutans. Gene expression data from all these species caused the authors to speculate that other human and great ape cells and tissues differ in plasmalogen levels. Although the consequences of these potential differences are unknown, cross-species differences in tissue plasmalogens could influence organ functions and multiple biological processes.\n"}

Launched on June 12, 1982, Lotto 6/49 was the first nationwide Canadian lottery game to allow players to choose their own numbers. Previous national games, such as the Olympic Lottery, Loto Canada and Superloto used pre-printed numbers on tickets. Lotto 6/49 led to the gradual phase-out of that type of lottery game in Canada.\n\nWinning numbers are drawn by the Interprovincial Lottery Corporation every Wednesday and Saturday, executed with a random number generator.\n\nAs the name implies, six numbers are drawn from a set of 49. If a ticket matches all six numbers, the jackpot prize of at least $5,000,000 is won. A bonus number is also drawn, and if a player's ticket matches five numbers and the bonus number, the player wins the \"second prize\" which is usually between $100,000 and $500,000. Should more than one player win the top or second prize, it is split amongst them. Lesser prizes are also awarded if one matches at least two numbers. If the top prize is not won, the jackpot prize increases for the next draw.\n\nAs many as ten separate \"lines\" (sets of numbers) can be printed on one individual ticket, but the maximum number allowed varies between jurisdictions. For example, in the Western Canada Lottery Corporation (WCLC) area — Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, the Northwest Territories, Yukon, and Nunavut — no more than six lines are allowed.\n\nThe price of Lotto 6/49 tickets was raised in June 2004 from the original $1 per line to $2 per line in order to offer larger jackpots. The minimum jackpot amount was also raised from $2 million to $3 million.\n\nBeginning with the September 18, 2013 draw, further changes were made to the game: ticket prices were raised to $3 per line, matching two numbers now awards a free ticket for the next draw, and the minimum jackpot was raised to $5 million. Additionally, a new \"guaranteed\" $1 million raffle prize is awarded during each drawing. Some draws may have smaller prizes in this category alongside the main $1 million; these are marketed as a \"Superdraw\".\n\nUntil May 2019, Lotto 6/49 and Lotto Max used a lottery machine to draw winning numbers. Since May 14, 2019, both games have switched to using a random number generator.\n\nBefore the June 2004 increase in ticket prices, the largest Lotto 6/49 jackpot was $26.4 million, on September 2, 1995.\n\nThe largest Lotto 6/49 jackpot, and the largest single jackpot in Canadian lottery history, was drawn on October 17, 2015 for a jackpot of $64 million. The jackpot was won by one ticket purchased in Mississauga, Ontario.\n\nThe second largest Lotto 6/49 jackpot, and the second largest jackpot in Canadian lottery history, was $63.4 million on the draw for April 13, 2013.\n\nThe third largest Lotto 6/49 jackpot was drawn on October 26, 2005. The single winning ticket, worth $54.3 million, was purchased in Camrose, Alberta by a group of 17 oil and gas plant workers. This was the largest Canadian lottery jackpot up to that time, and a significant increase from the previous record of $37.8 million on a Super 7 lottery draw in 2002—rapid sales created by lottery fever across the country pushed this 2005 Lotto 6/49 jackpot far beyond the originally estimated $40 million.\n\nBy comparison, while the Canadian Lotto Max lottery has had a main prize pool as high as $112 million, that lottery sets a cap of $70 million for its main jackpot, with excess \"main prize pool\" money being applied to a series $1 million MaxMillions prizes on the same draw.\n\nThe Lotto 6/49 game is administered by the Interprovincial Lottery Corporation, an alliance of the five regional lottery corporations in Canada.\n\nEach of these corporations operate a regional add-on games that, for an extra $1 each, can be added to a 6/49 ticket. This \"spiel\" game (named \"Tag\", \"Encore\" or \"Extra\" depending on the region), adds a 6- or 7-digit number to the ticket with a top prize of $100,000 if all six digits are matched or $250,000 to $1,000,000 depending on the region for a seven-number match ($1,000,000 in Ontario and Quebec; $250,000 in the Western Canada region of Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba and the territories).\n\nAlongside the main Lotto 6/49 drawing, the regional corporations also run local versions of the game; Atlantic 49, Quebec 49, Ontario 49, Western 6/49, and BC 49. These draws are held on the same night as each Lotto 6/49 drawing and have similar payouts (although only Ontario 49 and Western 6/49 offer a free play on matching two numbers, as with the current format for the national game), but with fixed jackpots of $2,000,000 ($1,000,000 on Atlantic 49). Lotto 6/49 selection slips offer the ability for players to choose between Lotto 6/49, the regional game, or to play both games using the same numbers.\n\nOverall odds of winning a prize are about 1 in 6.6, though the great majority of prizes consist of a free ticket for the next draw (a break-even scenario at best, not a win in the strictest sense).\n\nFrom the 2004 price change until September 18, 2013, this table was distributed thus:\nBefore July 2010, if there was no winning ticket for a jackpot of $30 million or higher, the following prize structure was applied to all subsequent draws until the jackpot was won. This did not apply to bonus jackpots.\n\nThe probability of winning some prize in one play is 1 in 32.3.\n\nFrom the game's inception until the 2004 price change, the prize pool consisted of 45% of sales, and was distributed thus:\n\nThe overall odds of winning were 1 in 54.\n\n\n"}

Repaints differ from redecos in that repaints do not alter the actual placement of paint applications while redecos do. \n\nSince molds can be expensive to create, this is often seen as a comparatively inexpensive way for a to make many different toys available in a cost-effective manner. It is also an effective way for toy manufacturers to produce exclusive figures, chase figures or other variants.\n\nThe term repaint also refers to fashion dolls whose original manufacturer face paint is removed and then repainted by an artist. Repaint styles include highly realistic treatments, fantasy makeovers, and celebrity likenesses. These dolls are often OOAK, although some artists create repaints in small limited editions. \n\nIn the collecting of 1:6th Action Figures, repainting has several methods. They can generally be narrowed down to 3 categories: paint, pastel and wash.\n\nOne of the many franchises that repaint their figures is Transformers. Bumblebee toys are sometimes repainted the color red to resemble another Transformers character: Cliffjumper.\n\n"}

He is sentenced to be hanged in Longhorn, Texas, to the glee of the locals who gather to watch his execution. A local ordinance dictates that a man condemned of any crime other than murder may be freed, if a lady will marry him and take responsibility for his good behavior. Well aware of the ordinance, many of the townswomen scrutinize Moon as he mounts the gallows.\n\nAn elderly woman offers to marry him, but dies on the spot immediately. As Moon is dragged back to the gallows, Julia Tate (Steenburgen)—a headstrong, genteel Southern virgin—agrees to marry and take charge of him. She weds Moon, intending only to use him as labor in a secret gold mine under her property. This evolves into a shaky partnership as he gains her trust, then develops into much more.\n\nThe local sheriff's deputy (Lloyd) repeatedly accuses Moon of stealing \"his\" girl, although there is no evidence that Julia ever had any interest in the deputy, and it was she who offered marriage to Moon. Moon's old gang complicates matters when they arrive at Julia's home and introduce the teetotalling Julia to intoxicating beverages. They discover that Julia and Moon are successfully mining gold. Moon schemes to betray Julia and steal the gold, but a cave-in at the mine changes the nature of their relationship.\n\n\nThe film was co-written by John Herman Shaner and produced by Harry Gittes, both longtime friends of Jack Nicholson from his early days in Hollywood.\n\nIt is the film debut of Mary Steenburgen, who had been a waitress in New York hoping to break into acting and after being turned down repeatedly for film roles; it launched her career in Hollywood. Christopher Lloyd, who worked with Nicholson on \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\", plays Deputy Towfield. Lloyd and Steenburgen reunited 12 years later as love interests in another western-comedy, Robert Zemeckis' \"Back to the Future Part III\".\n\nThis was John Belushi's second film after having been a \"Saturday Night Live\" cast member for several years. This film was shot and released after \"National Lampoon's Animal House\" in July 1978.\n\nIt was the second of three films directed by Nicholson, the first was 1971's \"Drive, He Said\" and the third was the \"Chinatown\" sequel \"The Two Jakes\", released in 1990. This marks the first film in which Nicholson appears as the primary actor while directing. He does not appear in \"Drive, He Said\", but did star in and direct \"The Two Jakes\".\n\nThe credits state that the film was shot in Durango, Mexico.\n\nIt was not a hit upon release in 1978 with critics or audiences. On Rotten Tomatoes it has an approval rating of 71% rating based on 14 reviews. On Metacritic, it holds a 52 score based on 9 reviews, indicating \"mixed or average reviews.\"\n\n\"Variety\" wrote, \"Jack Nicholson playing Gabby Hayes is interesting, even amusing at times, but Hayes was never a leading man, which 'Goin' South' desperately needs,\" adding that the \"largely uninteresting\" relationship between the Nicholson and Steenburgen characters \"never jells, as Nicholson continues to sputter and chomp, acting more like her grandfather than a handsome roué out to overcome her virginity.\" Gene Siskel of the \"Chicago Tribune\" gave the film two-and-a-half stars out of four and stated that \"Jack Nicholson may be cute, but two hours of cute he is not ... Nicholson as director takes his own sweet time, giving us scene after scene of him acting silly. My guess is that he doesn't think he is being indulgent with the character, because half the time he puts the character down. But the result is the same: Jack and more Jack. The film could use more of John Belushi, the 'Animal House' star, wasted here in a walk-on as a fat Mexican deputy sheriff. What 'Goin' South' could also use is a credible villain.\" Charles Champlin of the \"Los Angeles Times\" was positive, writing, \"There ain't much to it, to drop into the cackling vernacular of the movie, but what there is, is choice. Nicholson, directing for the first time since 'Drive, He Said,' has a fine way with actors, including himself, and he sets and sustains a tone that is larger than life but not so broad as to be only farcically foolish.\" Gary Arnold of \"The Washington Post\" called the film \"a stupefying throwback\" that \"expires right before your eyes from a terminal case of the feebles,\" with Nicholson and Steenburgen \"a bust\" as a romantic comedy team. David Ansen of \"Newsweek\" wrote, \"Droll, sweet-tempered and lackadaisical, it's a shaggy-dog story with Nicholson playing the shaggy dog ... Unfortunately, after a highly inventive first half, the tale gets mighty thin, and the waifish Steenburgen doesn't have enough range to carry her share of the romantic burden. Just when 'Goin' South' needs to build, the pace gets poky and the wit becomes mere whimsy. A little less coyness, and a lot more John Belushi (as a Mexican deputy), would have helped.\" Lawrence O'Toole wrote in \"Maclean's\", \"Every time Nicholson beams his gin-soaked grin into the movie, \"Goin' South\" is momentarily salvaged; but everything and everybody outside him seem to atrophy in the sun. It's his second crack at directing ... and he's not untalented, yet the selection of shots doesn't have the rhythmic grace to pull us into the wispy narrative.\" Pauline Kael of \"The New Yorker\" stated, \"Nicholson's prankish performance dominates the movie, and, with his prankishness also coming out in the casting and the directing, the movie hasn't any stabilizing force; there's nothing to balance what he's doing—no one with a stratjacket.\"\n\nMary Steenburgen earned a nomination for the Golden Globe Award for New Star of the Year – Actress.\n\n"}

If glycerol is involved, the compound is called a glyceryl ether, which may take the form of an alkylglycerol, an alkyl acyl glycerol, or in combination with a phosphatide group, a phospholipid.\n\nIn a biochemical sense, an ether lipid usually implies glycerophospholipids of various type, also called phospholipids, in which the sn-1 position of the glycerol backbone has a lipid attached by an ether bond and a lipid attached to the sn-2 position via an acyl group. This is in contrast to the more common glycerophospholipids, 1,2-diacyl-sn-glycerol (DAG), in which the glycerol backbone sn-1 and sn-2 positions have acyl chains attached by ester bonds. Ether lipid may also refer to alkylglycerols, such as chimyl (16:0), batyl (18:0), and selachyl (18:1 n-9) alcohols, with an ether-bound lipid on position sn-1, and the other two positions on the glycerol backbone unoccupied.\n\nThere are two types of ether lipids, plasmanyl- and plasmenyl-phospholipids. Plasmanyl-phospholipids have an ether bond in position sn-1 to an alkyl group. Plasmenyl-phospholipids have an ether bond in position sn-1 to an alkenyl group, 1-0-alk-1’-enyl-2-acyl-sn-glycerol (AAG). The latter type is called plasmalogens.\n\nPlatelet-activating factor (PAF) is an ether lipid which has an acetyl group instead of an acyl chain at the second position (SN-2).\n\nThe formation of the ether bond in mammals requires two enzymes, dihydroxyacetonephosphate acyltransferase (DHAPAT) and alkyldihydroxyacetonephosphate synthase (ADAPS), that reside in the peroxisome. Accordingly, peroxisomal defects often lead to impairment of ether-lipid production.\n\nMonoalkylglycerol ethers (MAGEs) are also generated from 2-acetyl MAGEs (precursors of PAF) by KIAA1363.\n\nPlasmalogens as well as some 1-O-alkyl lipids are ubiquitous and sometimes major parts of the cell membranes in mammals and anaerobic bacteria. In archaea, ether lipids are the major polar lipids in the cell envelope and their abundance is one of the major characteristics that separate this group of prokaryotes from the bacteria. In these cells, diphytanylglycerolipids or bipolar macrocyclic tetraethers can form covalently linked 'bilayers'.\n\nDifferences between the catabolism of ether glycerophospholipids by specific phospholipases enzymes might be involved in the generation of lipid second messenger systems such as prostaglandins and arachidonic acid that are important in signal transduction. Ether lipids can also act directly in cell signaling, as the platelet-activating factor is an ether lipid signaling molecule that is involved in leukocyte function in the mammalian immune system.\n\nAnother possible function of the plasmalogen ether lipids is as antioxidants, as protective effects against oxidative stress have been demonstrated in cell culture and these lipids might therefore play a role in serum lipoprotein metabolism. This antioxidant activity comes from the enol ether double bond being targeted by a variety of reactive oxygen species.\n\nSynthetic ether lipid analogs have cytostatic and cytotoxic properties, probably by disrupting membrane structure and acting as inhibitors of enzymes within signal transmission pathways, such as protein kinase C and phospholipase C.\n\nA toxic ether lipid analogue miltefosine has recently been introduced as an oral treatment for the tropical disease leishmaniasis, which is caused by leishmania, a protozoal parasite with a particularly high ether lipid content in its membranes.\n\n"}

She was the state champion of Ohio in the 3200-meter run with a time of 10:49.74 as a freshman (1992), and a state champion in the 1600-meter run with a time of 4:56.32 as a senior (1995).\n\nMcGregor continued running as a student-athlete at the University of Michigan in the fall of 1995, majoring in English and competing in both cross country and track.\n\nDuring her first season of cross country as a Wolverine, she was named Big Ten Freshman of the Year. She was the first freshman and first Wolverine to complete the course at the conference championship meet, helping her team to third-place finish behind the champion Wisconsin Badgers. In awful weather conditions at the NCAA District IV regional meet two weeks later, McGregor and her teammates were able to improve upon their performance at the Big Ten meet, with McGregor finishing in third-place and the Michigan team upsetting Wisconsin and winning the regional title outright. Their victory earned the team an automatic berth to the NCAA Women's Cross Country Championship. McGregor was the third Wolverine finisher in the championship (placing 39th overall), helping her team run to a seventh-place finish at the final meet.\n\nMcGregor's sophomore cross country season was somewhat disappointing, as both she and all but one of her Wolverine teammates missed qualifying for the NCAA championship meet.\n\nDuring her junior cross country season in the fall of 1997, McGregor was named Big Ten Athlete of the Year after winning the individual title with a time of 17:14. She managed a second-place finish to teammate Elizabeth Kampfe in the NCAA District IV regional meet in mid-November, helping the Wolverines to clinch the runner-up spot and an automatic berth in the NCAA championship. A week later in the championship, McGregor earned All-America honors by running to a fourth-place finish in a time of 16:48. She was the first finisher for the Wolverines, leading the team to seventh-place in the meet overall.\n\nDuring the indoor track season the following winter (1998), she won the two NCAA titles, one individually in the 3000-meter run with a time of 9:24.68, and another running the 1600-meter anchor leg in the distance medley relay, clocking a 4:38 split. During the outdoor track season, McGregor helped the Wolverines win the Big Ten championship by earning 14 points at the conference meet through a third-place finish in the 1500-meter run and a runner-up finish to Angie Kujak of the University of Wisconsin–Madison in the 5000-meter run. At the outdoor NCAA outdoor track and field championships in June, McGregor managed a runner-up finish to Amy Skieresz of the Arizona Wildcats in the 5000-meter run.\n\nMcGregor’s running success continued during her senior cross country season, when she won seven out of eight meets, including the Big Ten title in a time of 17:16, the Great Lakes Regional title in a time of 17:02.39, and the NCAA championship in a time of 16:47.21. For her efforts, McGregor was honored with the Honda Award, given to the nation’s top female cross country runner. During the 1999 outdoor track season, she won her final collegiate championship, winning the Big Ten title in the 5000-meter run with a time of 16:32.83. She later bested this time at the NCAA meet, earning All-American honors by taking third place in the race with a time of 16:15.75. For her achievements during her senior year, McGregor was named University of Michigan Female Athlete of the Year. During her time competing for Michigan, she was a three-time NCAA champion, eight-time NCAA All-American, and three-time Big Ten Conference champion.\n\nFollowing college, McGregor remained in Ann Arbor and continued training and competing under sponsorship from Adidas, transitioning from the shorter distance races to the 10000-meter run. In the spring of 2000, she achieved her first major post-collegiate victory, winning the 10000-meter run at the Stanford Invitational, setting a meet record with a time of 32:33.62. She competed in the event at the Olympic trials later that summer, but did not qualify to represent the U.S. team in Sydney, Australia. The following year, she moved to Minneapolis, and began training with Team Minnesota under sponsorship from Reebok.\n\nOver the next few years, McGregor competed in variety of distance races, performing well, and continuing to improve upon her personal best times in several running events. Highlights during 2004 included a second-place finish at the U.S. Cross Country Championships (8000-meter distance), as well as personal bests in both the 5000-meter and 10000-meter runs prior to the Olympic Trials. At the Olympic Trials, she narrowly missed qualifying for the games in Athens, taking fourth place in the 10000-meter run. Despite finishing fourth, McGregor would have earned a spot on the Olympic team if she met the \"A\" standard of 31:45, but she finished with a time of 32:33.87. In regards to her performance she commented that \"I was really angry, because I failed myself.\"\n\n2005 saw her personal best times in all races continue to improve, culminating in a come-from-behind victory in the 10000-meter run at the U.S. Outdoor Championships in May. She competed in the event for the U.S. team at the IAAF World Championships in Athletics in Helsinki, Finland in August 2005, taking fourteenth place overall as the top U.S. finisher, with a personal best time of 31:21.20.\n\nIn the autumn of 2006, McGregor began exploring longer distance races, competing in the New York City Marathon and achieving a ninth-place finish with a time of 2:32:36 in her debut at this distance.\n\nIn the spring of 2007, McGregor won the USATF 25 km championship, completing the River Bank Run in a time of 1:25:53 nearly three minutes ahead of the rest of the field. As part of the U.S. team in the summer of 2007, McGregor once again competed in the 10000-meter run at the IAAF Championships in Osaka, Japan, finishing in thirteenth place overall as the third U.S. finisher. During the autumn, she was named to the U.S. team running in the IAAF World Road Running Championships in Udine, Italy. She set a personal best in this competition, taking twenty-seventh place in the half marathon with a time of 1:12:01.\n\nSuccess continued for McGregor in early 2008, with a fourth-place finish at the U.S. Cross Country Championships in San Diego. This marked her sixth consecutive year as a member of the national cross country team, with whom she will compete at the IAAF World Cross Country Championships in Edinburgh in late March. At the U.S. Olympic Team Trials in June, McGregor again narrowly missed qualifying for the Olympics in the 10000-meter run. She competed well, but her time of 32:29.82 only earned her another fourth-place finish in the event at the Trials. Unlike the 2004 trials, this time McGregor had already met the \"A\" standard. Amy Yoder Begley made a furious charge at the end of the race, which met the standard and therefore qualified her for the team over McGregor. In response to this disappointing outcome, McGregor said:\n\nI felt like I failed myself in 2004. But this time I did what I needed to do, and Amy ran well. I tried to put a happy face on it. You don't want to be Debbie Downer and feel sorry for yourself. It's not like I'm the only person to finish fourth.\nMcGregor won USA 25 km Championships in May 2010 and then the USA 10-Mile Championships hosted at the Twin Cities Marathon in September, marking her sixth victory of the competition.\n\nMcGregor resides in suburban Minneapolis and ran for Team USA Minnesota until 2012. She enjoys reading literature by authors such as Sylvia Plath and Cormac McCarthy. McGregor is also a big fan of Frank Sinatra.\n\n\n"}

He studied at the Vienna University of Economics and Business (1913–1914), and then, after World War I, continued his studies at Lwów University, where his unusual language skills drew the attention of some prominent linguists. As a result, he was granted a scholarship in Paris. This gave him an opportunity to qualify as a university professor of Indo-European linguistics soon after his return to Poland. After obtaining the title, he became a professor at the University of Lwów. Later on, in 1946-48 Kuryłowicz filled in for Dr Krzyżanowski at the Institute of English Philology in Wrocław. Finally, he moved to Kraków, where he took the chair of General Linguistics at Jagiellonian University. He retired in 1965. Kuryłowicz was a member of the Polish Academy of Learning and the Polish Academy of Science. He died at the age of 83 in Kraków.\n\nHe was a member of the Polish Academy of Learning and the Polish Academy of Sciences. \n\nHe was the brother of the microbiologist Włodzimierz Kuryłowicz. His son, also named Jerzy Kuryłowicz (1925–2002), obtained his PhD from the Technical University of Warsaw.\n\nKuryłowicz did not belong to any of the structuralist linguistic schools. In his views he was close to glossematics, whose many assumptions he accepted and developed. \nHe is best known for his works on the Indo-European languages. The most important ones are Apophony in Indo-European (1956) and The Inflectional Categories of Indo-European (1964). In the latter, he discussed the inflectional categories of Indo-European languages and later, on the basis of these studies, formulated the so-called Case Theory.\n\nKuryłowicz's is also known for his \"Six Laws of Analogy\" that have been widely used in historical linguistics to understand how analogical grammatical changes work. The laws consist of six predictive statements about the direction of analogical changes:\n\nIn this theory he proposes the division into grammatical and concrete cases. According to Kuryłowicz, the case is a syntactic or semantic relation expressed by the appropriate inflected form or by linking the preposition with a noun, so it is the category based on a relation inside the sentence or a relation between two sentences.\n\nThe category of case covers two basic case groups:\n\nFor example, the Polish verb \"kierować\" (to drive) governs the direct object in the instrumental case, as in the expression \"kierować samochodem\" (to drive a car) (Fisiak 1975: 60)\n\nWhile studying the phonology of Indo-European languages, Kuryłowicz pointed at the existence of the Hittite consonant \"ḫ\" in his 1927 paper \"ə indo-européen et ḫ hittite\". This discovery supported Ferdinand de Saussure’s 1879 proposal of the existence of \"coefficients sonantiques\", elements de Saussure reconstructed to account for vowel length alternations in Indo-European. This led to the so-called laryngeal theory, a major step forward in Indo-European linguistics and a confirmation of de Saussure's theory.\n\nIn 1936 Kuryłowicz introduced the idea of syntactic transformation, pointing at the same time that this syntactic (transformative) derivation does not change the meaning of syntactic form. Therefore, if we take the sentence like: \n\"Kate washes the car.\"\nand change it into passive:\n\"The car is washed by Kate.\"\nwe can notice that the second sentence has the same meaning as the first one. They differ just in terms of style. The idea of transformative derivation proves that Kuryłowicz was ahead of his times, because what he described resembles one of the main assumptions of Chomsky’s Transformative – Generative Grammar postulated several years later.\n\nKuryłowicz was also interested in the element hierarchy and the function of the language system. Analyzing the problem of hierarchy he introduced the concept of \"foundation\", which is the relation between two forms or functions in a language. One of the forms or functions, so-called \"founding\", always results in the presence of the \"founded\", not conversely. For instance, in Latin, the endings \"-os\" and \"-or\" in the nominative singular both always correspond with the ending \"-orem\" in the accusative singular. It does not work the other way round because the ending in the accusative does not allow one to predict the ending in the nominative case: it can be either \"-os\" or \"-or\". (Fisiak 1975: 56)\n\n\n\n"}

He served in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1920 to 1927.\n\nBayley was born in Winnipeg, the son of William Dowell Bayley and Lucy Charlotte Carney, of English descent. One of his ancestors, Sir Thomas Wyatt, was executed for sedition. Bayley received a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Manitoba, and was a medallist in philosophy and political economy. He served as principal of King George Public School in Norwood, and in 1918 lectured on prohibition for the \"dry\" side in New Zealand.\n\nHe first ran for the Manitoba legislature in the provincial election of 1915, as a candidate of the Labour Representation Committee. He finished second in Assiniboia, coming 55 behind Liberal candidate John Wilton.\n\nLabour's electoral fortunes rose in Manitoba after the Winnipeg General Strike of 1919. Bayley ran for the legislature again in the 1920 provincial election as a candidate of the Dominion Labour Party, and defeated Wilton by 103 votes. The Liberals won a minority government in this election, and Bayley served as an opposition member of the legislature. He was re-elected in the 1922 election, which was won by the United Farmers of Manitoba.\n\nBayley was known as a strong orator, and had the honour of being the first public school teacher to serve in the Manitoba legislature. He left the Labour Party caucus on January 8, 1924, shortly after the retirement of party leader Fred Dixon. He served as an independent member of the legislature after this time, and did not seek re-election in 1927.\n\nBayley was appointed head of temperance education after retiring from the legislature, and opposed efforts to liberalize Manitoba's liquor laws. He attempted a political comeback in 1953, largely in response to Stephen Juba's increased popularity in the city. Juba, who would later be elected as Winnipeg's Mayor, promoted liquor law reforms as part of a populist platform. In response, Bayley formed an organization called the Prosperity for Posterity Party (PPP), which was primarily a vehicle to oppose Juba and his views on the issue.\n\nBayley registered as a PPP candidate for Winnipeg South in the 1953 provincial election, but withdraw before election day. He was initially reluctant to run, and allowed his name to stand only after no other volunteers came forward. When he left the race, he suggested that his candidacy could split the temperance vote. He also issued the following statement:\n\n\"I choose to withdraw, thanking the friends of temperance, and of me personally, both those who paid me to run and those who said don't, and apologizing to Winnipeg Centre electors for ever thinking they wouldn't adequately deal with Mr. Juba\".\n\nHe died in Winnipeg at the age of 75 and was buried in Montreal, Quebec.\n"}

The film was directed by Arthur Penn, with supporting performances by Randy Quaid, Harry Dean Stanton, Frederic Forrest, John McLiam, and Kathleen Lloyd. The score was composed by John Williams.\n\nThe title of the movie refers to a forlorn and very rugged area of north-central Montana, where over eons, the Missouri River has made countless deep cuts or \"breaks\" in the land.\n\nTom Logan is a rustler experiencing hard times. His gang and he are particularly upset by the hanging of a friend of theirs by Braxton, a land baron, who takes the law into his own hands. They decide to seek vengeance against Braxton by killing his foreman Pete Marker and by buying a small property close to Braxton's ranch, then rustling his stock.\n\nFirst the gang, without Logan, rides off across the Missouri River and north of the border to steal horses belonging to the North West Mounted Police. In their absence, Logan plants crops and enters into a relationship with Braxton's aggressive, virginal daughter, Jane.\n\nBraxton is incensed with both his rustling problem and his daughter, and sends for Robert E. Lee Clayton, a notorious Irish-American \"regulator\", who for a price, will take care of rustlers personally.\n\nQuickly suspicious of Logan, who does not strike him as a farmer, Clayton dons a variety of disguises and begins to pick off Logan's gang, one by one. Identifying himself under the pseudonym of \"Jim Ferguson\", he also kills Logan's young friend, Little Tod.\n\nClayton spies on Logan with binoculars and taunts Braxton about his daughter's affair with a horse thief. Braxton attempts to discharge him, but Clayton is determined to finish his job. He kills three more of Logan's partners, Cary, Cy, and Cal.\n\nOne night after a campfire goes dark with Clayton serenading his horse, Logan slits his throat. He then comes after Braxton, who has been feigning a trance, but at an opportune time pulls a weapon on Logan, but is then shot in the chest and killed.\n\nLogan abandons his farm and packs up to leave. He acknowledges to Jane the possibility that they can renew their relationship at another time, another place six months in the future.\n\nIn a May 24, 1976, \"Time\" interview, Brando was revealed to have \"changed the entire flavor of his character—an Irish-American bounty hunter called \"Robert E. Lee Clayton\"—by inventing a deadly hand weapon resembling both a harpoon and a mace that he uses to kill. He said, \"I always wondered why in the history of lethal weapons no one invented that particular one. It appealed to me because I used to be very expert at knife throwing.\"\n\nBrando broke the monotony of the production by playing childish pranks with rubber spiders and eggs, as well as frequently mooning the cast and crew. He would interrupt shots with bizarre behavior like biting a chunk out of a frog during a river scene, to taking potshots at grasshoppers instead of his firing a gun at co-star Nicholson as scripted. Director Penn apparently made no effort to control him.\n\nPrincipal photography began on June 23, 1975. Jack Nicholson was the first actor to arrive on location with director Arthur Penn, the cast, and the crew. During the second week of filming in Nevada City, intermittent rain showers hit the area, which made the entire cast and crew more bedraggled than the script called for. More than 80 extras were used for area scenes; most of them were local people and children. A narrow-gauge car was lost for a week while en route from Chama, New Mexico, to Harrison, which arrived after being held in Salt Lake City for interstate transportation permits. A scene that required the car was filmed on a trestle, four miles from Harrison on the abandoned Red Bluff Railroad. After filming was completed there, the cast and crew went on to Virginia City. In mid-July, Marlon Brando arrived in Montana to begin filming in Billings on a ranch near the city.\n\nIn August, while filming a scene on the Yellowstone River that requires the two main characters on horses and crossing the river, one of the horses, named Jug, drowned accidentally while in the water. In question, the film's production executive said Jug died of shock when he was in the water. He explained that the horse hit a (submerged?) car body with one hoof and had a heart attack. An investigation was required, and the authorities came to the conclusion that it was an accident. According to a spokesman for the Billings Humane Society, though, the sheriff's investigation was unsatisfactory. The set was closed for a few weeks to everyone and no discrimination was involved. After the horse's drowning and the injury of several others, including one by American Humane Association-prohibited tripwire, this film was placed on the AHA's \"unacceptable\" list. By the end of August, Brando had completed filming and left Montana. Nicholson stayed behind with the crew and cast. Production then headed to Red Lodge for two weeks to complete filming, and it was officially wrapped in mid-September 1975.\nThe movie was filmed on location in Montana: Billings, Bovey Restorations, Nevada City, Red Lodge, and Virginia City.\n\nComing on the heels of Brando and Nicholson's Oscar-winning turns in \"The Godfather\" and \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\", the film was highly anticipated, but became a notorious critical and commercial flop.\n\nVincent Canby's review in the May 20, 1976, \"New York Times\" cited \"an out-of-control performance\" by Brando.\n\nBrando agreed to accept $1 million for five weeks' work plus 11.3% of gross receipts in excess of $10 million. Nicholson agreed to accept $1.25 million for 10 weeks work, plus 10% of the gross receipts in excess of $12.5 million. (Nicholson later sued producer Elliott Kastner for unpaid wages.) Despite its two stars, \"Missouri Breaks\" reportedly earned a domestic box-office gross of a mere $14 million.\n\nXan Brooks of \"The Guardian\" sees the film as having ripened over the years: \"Time has worked wonders on \"The Missouri Breaks\". On first release, Arthur Penn's 1976 Western found itself derided as an addled, self-indulgent folly. Today, its quieter passages resonate more satisfyingly, while its lunatic take on a decadent, dying frontier seems oddly appropriate. ... Perhaps for the last time, there is a whiff of method to (Brando's) madness. He plays his hired gun as a kind of cowboy Charles Manson, serene and demonic\".\n\nAs of May 2020, the film holds a 79% \"fresh\" rating on review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes based on 24 reviews.\n\n"}

He had two brothers, Gert (1914–2008; a noted Swedish artist and sculptor, and a recipient of the Prince Eugen Medal), and Holger, and one sister Anna-Britta.\n\nIn Hamburg, Dahl studied piano under , a harpsichordist, pianist, and a proponent of early music. Ingolf studied with Philipp Jarnach at the Hochschule für Musik Köln (1930–32). Dahl left Germany as the Nazi Party was coming to power and continued his studies at the University of Zurich, along with Volkmar Andreae and Walter Frey. Living with relatives and working at the Zurich Opera for more than six years, he rose from an internship to the rank of assistant conductor. He served as a vocal coach and chorus master for the world premieres of Alban Berg's \"Lulu\" and Paul Hindemith's \"Mathis der Maler\".\n\nSince Switzerland became increasingly hostile towards Jewish refugees (including people of partial Jewish parentage) and Dahl's role at the Opera was restricted to playing in the orchestra, he emigrated to the United States in 1939. There he used the name Ingolf Dahl, based on his original middle name and his mother's maiden name. He consistently lied about his background, claiming to be of Swedish birth and denying his Jewish heritage (Marcus being a recognizably Jewish surname). He claimed to have emigrated a year earlier than he actually had. He settled in Los Angeles and joined the community of expatriate musicians that included Ernst Krenek, Darius Milhaud, Arnold Schoenberg, Igor Stravinsky, and Ernst Toch. He had a varied musical career as a solo pianist, keyboard performer (piano and harpsichord), accompanist, conductor, coach, composer, and critic. He produced a performing translation of Schoenberg's \"Pierrot Lunaire\" in English and translated, either alone or with a collaborator, such works as Stravinsky's \"Poetics of Music\". He performed many of Stravinsky's works and the composer was impressed enough to contract Dahl to create a two-piano version of his \"Danses concertantes\" and program notes for other works. In 1947, with Joseph Szigeti he produced a reconstruction of Bach's Violin Concerto in D Minor.\n\nHe also worked in the entertainment industry, touring as pianist to Edgar Bergen and his puppets in 1941 and later for comedian Gracie Fields in 1942 and 1956. He produced musical arrangements for Tommy Dorsey and served as arranger/conductor to Victor Borge. He gave private lessons in the classical repertoire to Benny Goodman as well. He performed on keyboard instruments in the soundtrack orchestras for many films at Fox, Goldwyn Studios, Columbia, Universal, MGM, and Warner Bros., as well as the post-production company Todd-AO. He also worked on the television show \"The Twilight Zone\". Though grateful for the income this work provided, he complained while working on \"Spartacus\" how pointless it was \"to tinkle a few notes on the celeste\" when the notes are also doubled by several other instruments, all for a passage presented to the audience under sound effects and actors' voices. Dahl conducted the soundtrack to \"The Abductors\" (1957) by his pupil Paul Glass and performed the second movement of Beethoven's \"Pathétique Sonata\" in the 1969 animated film \"A Boy Named Charlie Brown\".\n\nAmong his compositions, the most frequently performed is the \"Concerto for Alto Saxophone and Wind Orchestra\" commissioned and premiered by Sigurd Raschèr in 1949. He later completed commissions for the Los Angeles Philharmonic and the Koussevitsky and Fromm foundations. His final work, complete and partly orchestrated at his death in 1970, was the \"Elegy Concerto\" for violin and chamber orchestra. In 1999, one critic reviewing a recording of Dahl's works called him a \"spiffy composer,\" \"a cross between Stravinsky and Hindemith.\"\n\nHe legally changed his name to Ingolf Dahl in February 1943 and became a naturalized U.S. citizen in September of that year. In 1945 he joined the faculty of the University of Southern California in Los Angeles, where he taught for the rest of his life. In 1952 he was appointed the first head of the Tanglewood Study Group, a program that targeted not professionals but \"the intelligent amateur and music enthusiast, also the general music student and music educator.\" His most prominent students included the conductor Michael Tilson Thomas and the composers Harold Budd and David Cope. In 1957 he co-directed the Ojai Music Festival in partnership with Aaron Copland and served as its Music Director from 1964 to 1966.\n\nAmong Dahl's honors were a Guggenheim Fellowship in music composition in 1951, two Huntington Hartford Fellowships, an Excellence in Teaching Award from the University of Southern California, the ASCAP Stravinsky Award, and a grant from the National Institute of Arts and Letters in 1954.\n\nHe died in Frutigen, Switzerland on August 6, 1970, just a few weeks after the death of his wife on June 10.\n\nFrom his teenage years, Dahl was initially bisexual, but from then onward, \"his preference and partiality...remained with men.\" He had his first homosexual experiences at the age of 16 with the painter Eduard Bargheer. He kept his sexual orientation secret in his professional life, even as he cataloged in his diaries a wide variety of infatuations, affairs, trysts, and relationships. After coming to America, Dahl married Etta Gornick Linick, whom he had met in Zurich. She accepted his homosexuality, helped him to keep it hidden, and shared his affection with a lover that Dahl had met on a trip to Boston, and occasionally visited there. He maintained an intimate, though never exclusive, relationship for the last fifteen years of his life with Bill Colvig, whom he met on a Sierra Club hiking trip.\n\nNotations in his manuscripts show he sometimes found inspiration in his male companions for his compositions. \"Hymn\" (1947) was inspired by Dahl's year-long affair with an art student he met at U.S.C.\nand movements of \"A Cycle of Sonnets\" (1967) carry the initials of two others.\n\nHis step-son only learned of his homosexuality in a letter of condolence the step-son received upon Dahl's death. He assessed the relationship between Dahl's private and public sides in these words:\n\nDahl's music has been recorded on the Boston Records, Capstone, Centaur, Chandos Records, CRI, Crystal, Klavier, MKH Medien Kontor Hamburg, Nimbus, and Summit labels.\n\nAmong Dahl's students are the American conductors Michael Tilson Thomas, Lawrence Christianson, William Hall, William Dehning, Frank A. Salazar, the pianist William Teaford, and the composers Morten Lauridsen and Lawrence Moss. Tilson Thomas assessed him this way: \"Dahl was an inspiring teacher; over and above the subject matter, he showed his students about the practical value of humanism. That is, how to let humanistic concerns infuse your daily existence.\"\n\nThe Music Library of the University of Southern California (USC) holds the Ingolf Dahl Archive. It includes scores, manuscripts, papers, and tapes. Dahl also kept a diary in annual volumes from 1928 until his death in 1970. In 2012 his stepson, Anthony Linick, who wrote an extensive biography of Ingolf, donated these to USC.\n\nThe West Coast chapters of the American Musicological Society present the Ingolf Dahl Memorial Award in Musicology annually.\n\nRecently there has been a revival of interest in the history of the Marcus–Dahl family, its flight from Hamburg, and the cultural contributions of Ingolf Dahl and his brother, the sculptor Gert Marcus. In 2017 residents of Groß Borstel founded a new society, \"Initiative Marcus und Dahl\", with the goal of reviving interest in the work of Gert Marcus and Ingolf Dahl as well as other artists living or working, or having lived or worked, in Gross-Borstel. \"Initiative Marcus und Dahl\" has been responsible for a number of projects. Among these one can cite the production of a new CD in 2018 of Ingolf Dahl's chamber music – \"Intervals\" – under the direction of Volker Ahmels.\n\nIn 2019, Melina Paetzold produced a German language biography of Ingolf Dahl.\n\n\"Notes on Cartoon Music\" in Mervyn Cooke, ed., \"The Hollywood Film Music Reader\" (Oxford University Press, 2010)\n\n\n"}

Charles Emerson was also the author of a number of books dealing with oratory and a minister with the Unitarian Church.\n\nCharles Wesley Emerson was born in Pittsfield, Vermont in 1837 to Thomas and Mary F. (Hewitt) Emerson, and was a distant cousin of Ralph Waldo Emerson. The Emersons moved to Stockbridge, Vermont in 1845 where his father was a notable teacher. Emerson studied with Prof. Augustus Wing, and began preaching at age nineteen. \n\nPrior to establishing the College, Emerson was a minister who preached in Congregational and Unitarian parishes until 1885. \n\nEmerson studied medicine at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia receiving an M.D. in 1877, and he conducted courses in elocution, expression, voice culture, art, and topics related to oratory at the Unitarian Church of Vineland, New Jersey.\n\nIn 1877, Charles Emerson enrolled in Boston University's School of Oratory where he studied Delsarte and Swedenborg under the direction and guidance of Professor Lewis B.

A year later, the name was changed to the Monroe Conservatory of Oratory, in honor of Monroe (now Emerson College).\n\nDuring his time as president of the Conservatory, Emerson published a number of books including four volumes of \"The Evolution of Expression\" which became the core text in the Conservatory's curriculum.\n\nIn 1900, Henry and Jessie Eldridge Southwick purchased Emerson College. Emerson retired three years later and William James Rolfe took his place as president of the college.\n\nEmerson believed that the ability to communicate was the key to achieving one's full potential. Emerson was confident that once a student completed his academic program, he would have future success, no matter what endeavor or profession they chose.\n\nEmerson is buried in Prospect Hill Cemetery in Millis, Massachusetts.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2268649", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2268649", "title": "Transformers (comics)", "text": "Transformers (comics)\n\nThere have been three main publishers of the comic book series bearing the name. Transformers based on the toy lines of the same name. The first series was produced by Marvel Comics from 1984 to 1991, which ran for 80 issues and produced four spin-off miniseries. This was followed by a second volume titled \"\", which ran for 12 issues starting in 1993. The second major series was produced by Dreamwave Productions from 2002 to 2004 with multiple limited series as well, and within multiple story continuities, until the company became bankrupt in 2005. The third series is currently being produced by IDW Publishing starting with an issue #0 in October 2005 and a regular series starting in January 2006. There are also several limited series being produced by IDW as well. In addition to these three main publishers, there have also been several other smaller publishers with varying degrees of success.\n\n\"The Transformers\" comic by Marvel was the first and arguably the best known Transformers comic. Although it was originally intended to be a 4-issue limited series, it expanded into an ongoing series, which ran for 80 issues before being cancelled. The final cover read \"80 in a 4 issue limited series\". Issues #5–15, 17–32, 35–42 and 44–56 were written by Bob Budiansky, with Marvel UK writer Simon Furman taking over for the remainder of the comic. The comic did not attempt to follow the show and some elements and characters were completely absent, including Ultra Magnus, Springer, Arcee, and Metroplex. The comic started much the same as the show; a crew crash landing the Ark on Earth in the distant past. They are befriended by Buster Witwicky. His brother Spike eventually joins the cause as Autobot leader when he became the head of commander Fortress Maximus. There occurs a considerable amount of fractioning and in-fighting in both the Autobots and Decepticons. However, the series climax occurs when both sides, Autobots and Decepticons, form an uneasy peace to defend Cybertron from Unicron.\n\nA few of the early issues were reprinted by Marvel in a digest sized magazine called \"The Transformers Comics Magazine\" that ran 10 issues from 1987 to 1988. Marvel had also reprinted some of these early issues in 1985, as the \"Transformers Collected Comics\" which ran 2 issues.\n\nIn latter years, when various other companies were able to obtain the license for the \"Transformers\", they were able to gain access to the Marvel series and reprinted a lot of the issues. From 2001 to 2003, Titan Books reprinted numerous Marvel issues in a series of 14 trade paperbacks. Years later they were able to do more reprints but only in the U.K market.\n\nIDW Publishing (the current rights holders to the Transformers comic property) reprinted numerous Marvel issues as well, as part of the \"Transformers: Generations\" series that ran 12 issues and a collected trade paperback from 2006 to 2007. Issues were also reprinted in \"The Transformers Magazine\", that ran four issues in 2007, while other collections were published in 2008 and 2009. IDW began publishing another new series of reprints called \"Transformers Classics\". This six volume series started getting published in June 2011. Meanwhile, a \"100 Penny Press: Transformers Classics #1\" mini edition was also published in June 2011. Some issues were also reprinted in the hardcover book \"Transformers: The Best Of Simon Furman\" in July 2007. In March 2014, the first issue of the series was reprinted as \"100 Penny Press: Transformers #1\" \n\nIn July 2012, to prepare the new series \"Transformers: Regeneration One\" (which continued the Marvel series after 21 years), IDW Publishing released Transformers: Regeneration One 100-Page Spectacular. This one-shot reprinted issues 76–80 of the Marvel series.\n\nIn August 2013, IDW published the hardcover \"Transformers: 30th Anniversary Collection\". This deluxe book celebrated the 30th anniversary of \"The Transformers\" franchise, and as such, many of the original Marvel books were reprinted.\n\nThe sister title in the UK, this series ran for 332 issues, as well as spawning 7 annuals and 28 specials. It was a weekly publication that spliced original stories into the continuity of the reprinted US issues, and was mostly written by Simon Furman. At the start, it had a more serious science fiction approach. Because of the weekly approach, the UK comic was able to flesh out characters and ideas more; in the US comic, the Aerialbots and Stunticons are first shown having just been built and being given life by the Creation Matrix program, whereas the UK comic fleshed it out more and showed the two teams as being created out of new technology created by Shockwave after scanning Buster Witwicky while he had the Matrix downloaded into his brain. Furman also tried to maintain continuity with \"\", and wrote several stories set in the future after the movie's ending, as well as bringing characters from the future (i.e. Galvatron) into the present day. Due to his epic and mythological approach, he was highly praised and succeeded Bob Budiansky on the US title at issue 56. The mythic tone continued to influence Furman's work on the Dreamwave and IDW comics.\n\nNumerous issues and stories from this series would eventually be reprinted. Marvel UK themselves would reprint some stories in \"Transformers-The Complete Works\" Part 1 and Part 2, \" Plague of the Insecticons\" and \"The Transformers Universe Vol. One\".\n\nIn latter years reprints were done courtesy of Titan Books who published reprints in 14 volumes.\n\nWhen IDW Publishing acquired the licence to the property, they published various reprints in the hardcover book \"The Best Of Simon Furman\" and in the \"Best of UK Omnibus\". Other reprints were featured in mini-series collections such as \"Target 2006\" (#1–5), \"Dinobots\" (#1–6), \"Space Pirates\" (#1–5), \"Time Wars\" (#1–5), \"City of Fear\" (#1–5), and \"Prey\" (#1–5). A new 8 volume reprint collection called \"Transformers Classics: UK\" started getting released in October 2011.\n\nA three-issue mini-series adaptation of , with no continuity ties to the regular comic series. Differences to the animated feature include the original designs for the Autobot Matrix of Leadership and Ultra Magnus' original death at the hand of Scourge and his Sweeps.\n\nA four-issue limited series in the style of \"Marvel Universe\" and \"G.I. Joe: Order of Battle\", featuring lengthy bios of nearly all of the Transformers of the period. Most of the text was the same as the tech specs found on the toy boxes, only much more expanded. The first three issues (as well as the first portion of the fourth) contained all of the first, second and third year Transformers. The latter half of the fourth issue dealt with characters new to \"\" (1986), including characters that were not made as toys at the time.\n\nThe series was collected as a trade paperback in July 1987.\n\nA four-issue limited series written by Michael Higgins, \"G.I. Joe and the Transformers\" teamed-up the Transformers with the other popular Hasbro property of the 1980s, G.I. Joe. The Joes, the Autobots, and Cobra (after being betrayed by the Decepticons) must join forces to stop the Decepticons from activating an energy drill device to suck up energy from the Earth's core, which would destroy the planet in the process.\n\nThe story was hampered by continuity issues (though the storyline was only referred to in the pages of the Transformers comics, as G.I. Joe writer Larry Hama opted to ignore the mini-series), and the absence of several key characters from both franchises, including Cobra Commander, Optimus Prime, and Megatron, as the three characters were presumed dead at the time of the mini-series' publication. The story featured Bumblebee being destroyed by G.I. Joe forces and rebuilt as Goldbug. This plot point was ignored in the UK comic, where the story was not reprinted until much later in the comic's run, and resulted in an alternate story being conceived to change the character into his \"Goldbug\" persona.\n\nMarvel UK also featured a crossover between these two properties. 'Ancient Relics' began in Issue 125 of the UK comic and continued within issues #24-#27 of Action Force, (the name given to the G.I. Joe comic series in the UK).\n\nA four-issue mini-series introducing new characters that were incorporated into the ongoing series (issue #38) at the conclusion of the mini-series. The series introduces the Headmasters, Targetmasters, some of the movie Transformers, Monsterbots, Horrorcons, Technobots and Terrorcons.\n\nThe plot of this series focuses on Cybertronian Autobot Fortress Maximus, who despite his success as a military commander, longs to find peace by leaving Cybertron's civil war altogether. To that end, he gathers a large crew of followers, and they rocket off to the planet Nebulos, which has not seen war in over 10,000 years. Unfortunately, the Autobots' first encounters with the Nebulans are misinterpreted. Intimidated by the robots' size, the Nebulans initiate aggressions against the Autobots. To end hostilities and show his willingness to protect the planet's fragile peace, Fortress Maximus and a few of his followers discard their weapons in front of the Nebulan capital. When that failed to dissuade them, he made the ultimate sacrifice by offering them his head. Four more Autobots did the same, while the remained returned to their camp unarmed.\nIntending to use the situation to his advantage, corrupt Nebulan politician Lord Zarak learned more about the Autobots and the war they left behind and used this information to contact Cybertron. Zarak's message was received by Fortress Maximus's Decepticon equal, Scorponok. After lying to Zarak about the intentions of the Autobots, Scorponok led an invasion force to the planet. Armed only with weapons that had not seen use in millennia, the Nebulan defense were no match for the intentionally aggressive Decepticons. With little options left, Galen, leader of the Nebulan world council, made arrangements for himself and others to become Autobot Headmasters. Although the Headmaster process made them able to drive off the Decepticons, all Galen had succeeded in doing was re-igniting the Transformers' war on Nebulous. After Scorponok and now-captive Lord Zarak developed a way to duplicate the process (as well as a later \"Targetmaster\" Process), the Nebulos theatre of the Transformers' war escalated. After casualties and collateral damage mounted, Galen eventually convinced Zarak to take their conflict off-world, with nearly all Transformers from both factions following a distress beacon sent by Goldbug from Earth.\n\nBecause the series was bi-monthly, very little time passed after its end before a smaller group returned to Nebulos, using resources there and the Powermaster Process to rebuild and empower Optimus Prime.\n\nThe entire miniseries was reprinted by Titan Books as part of their series of trade paperback collections based on the Marvel series. This reprint occurred in Vol.7 (\"Trial by Fire\") which was published in 2005.\n\nA 12-issue series, the series expanded the original G1 mythos from the small war on Earth and Cybertron to enclose the whole of the Galaxy that was fast being altered into a likeness of Cybertron itself by the Cybertronian Empire, a race of later generation Transformers that evolved while the earthbound Autobots and Decepticons were deactivated. The events of this series were actually set in motion with a crossover from the G.I. Joe comic books #138–142, in 1993. Megatron returns in his new tank body to reclaim his leadership from Bludgeon and by the end of the series joins with Optimus Prime to fight against the G2 Decepticons and their genetic offshoot, the Swarm. The series ended with an epic battle between the \"Generation 1\" Transformers, the Cybertronians and the Swarm. It also introduces the Liege Maximo. However, the series was cancelled with issue #12 due to low sales, forcing a quick conclusion to the series' various plot threads. Outside of the 12 issue series, Marvel published a free 8 page comic that was given away at various stores selling the G2 toyline called \"The Transformers Generation 2: Halloween Special Edition\" in 1993.\n\nThe series was reprinted as 2 trade paperbacks courtesy of Titan Books in 2003. As well some stories were reprinted in the hardcover book \"Transformers: The Best Of Simon Furman\" in July 2007.\n\nAs they had done with the Generation 1 series, Marvel published a series based on Generation 2 in England. Because their Marvel UK imprint had folded at this point, Marvel struck a deal with the British comic company Fleetway to handle the series in the English market for them. The series only lasted 5 issues as well as one annual in 1995.\n\nA crossover with the original holders of the Transformers license, Marvel Comics, this series takes place in both Marvel's ongoing continuity, (pre-Civil War), and IDW's G1 continuity, set in between \"Infiltration\" and \"Escalation\". The 4-issue series is written by Stuart Moore and drawn by Tyler Kirkman. Captain America, Iron Man, Wolverine, and Spider-Man all appear, as well as many of the Transformers cast of \"Escalation\".\n\nThe series was collected as a trade paperback in January 2008.\n\nThe Marvel Comics character Death's Head, a character created by Simon Furman, appeared in certain Marvel UK Transformers stories. In the third issue of the \"All-New Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A–Z\" (released on March 22, 2006), the entry for Death's Head's describes his encounters with the Transformers to have taken place in an alternate reality, referred to as Earth-120185, thus separating these stories from existence in standard Marvel Universe continuity. This raises the question of whether or not any of the Marvel Comics \"Transformers\" stories take place in the Marvel Universe \"proper\" (Earth-616), despite such tie-ins as Spider-Man's guest-starring appearance in the original Marvel limited series and Circuit Breaker, a character that originated in the \"Transformers\" comics, having a cameo appearance in Marvel's \"Secret Wars II\" limited series, which featured nearly every character then existing in the continuity of Earth-616. A case can be made that only the stories that featured Death's Head are separate from standard Marvel continuity, since the character's adventures often involved travel across time and dimensions, not to mention genres; Death's Head also encountered the British science fiction icon the Doctor from \"Doctor Who\" once.\n\nIn early 2002, Dreamwave Productions acquired the Transformers comics license and went on to produce a highly successful return of Transformers to the comic world. They started with a limited series focusing on the Generation 1 characters and a monthly series dedicated to \"\". The G1 stories were not bound by the previous Marvel stories nor the animated series. Dreamwave produced a large amount of material, but would go bankrupt and lose the Transformers license in early 2005.\n\nWhen they acquired the Transformers licence from Hasbro, Dreamwave Productions initially produced a six-issue mini-series, written by Chris Sarracini and drawn by company President Pat Lee, titled \"Prime Directive\". Despite mixed critical reaction and the late shipping of several issues, the series was a huge sales success. Encouraged by this, Dreamwave produced a second series, this time written by Brad Mick, called \"War and Peace\". When the second series emulated the sales of the first, Dreamwave decided to upgrade the \"Generation One\" to an ongoing series focusing on the Earthbound Autobots and Decepticons, written by Brad Mick aka James McDonough and Adam Patyk, and drawn by Don Figueroa (although Lee and Joe Ng helped draw the preview issue, and issue #4 featured a back-up story drawn by James Raiz). However, Dreamwave's eventual bankruptcy meant that the series would never be concluded past issue #10. This was the first piece of Transformers fiction to use the term \"Generation One\" in the title. After Dreamwave's bankruptcy, the first two miniseries were redistributed in trade paperback form through IDW Publishing.\n\nOf note: there is a magazine that published a 10-page preview in b/w of what was to have been the 11th issue of the series had Dreamwave not gone into bankruptcy, but was of a very low print run.\n\nAfter the success of their Generation One series, Dreamwave decided to do a series focusing on the war on Cybertron before the Transformers came to Earth, and recruited Marvel Transformers writer Simon Furman and former fan artist Don Figueroa for a six-issue series focusing on the rise of Optimus Prime. Later, a second volume appeared titled \"The Dark Ages\", again written by Furman and drawn by regular Marvel Transformers artist Andrew Wildman. The second volume introduced The Fallen, an outcast member of the original thirteen Transformers. A third volume, called \"The Age of Wrath\", written by Furman and drawn by Joe Ng, was released up through issue #3, but due to Dreamwave's bankruptcy it was never completed. The first two series were re-released in trade paperback form by IDW Publishing in March and May 2007.\n\n\"Micromasters\" was a four-issue mini-series written by Brad Mick aka James McDonough and Adam Patyk and drawn by Rob Ruffolo. Set on Cybertron after the disappearance of the Ark, the series focused on the history of the titular Micromasters and the discovery of a mysterious Golden Disk with links to the origins of the Transformers. Despite some vocal readers' complaints regarding the series and its art, it also received its share of praise and sold well to the direct market.\n\nAn eight-issue limited series from 2003 written by Brad Mick aka James McDonough and Adam Patyk (the shapers of Dreamwave's \"G1\" title and its overall \"Transformers\" continuity) with art by most of the Dreamwave artists, it featured bios of all the Transformers released as toys in the United States (with the exception of several of the Action Masters). The character entries were done in the same style as the 1986 Marvel limited series, \"Transformers Universe\", with page long bios and art of the characters in both their robot and alternate forms. The character bios included expanded information from the original toys' tech specs, as well as new character development from the Dreamwave \"Transformers\" continuity. Issues one through seven contain the character bios, while issue number eight contains entries for key Transformer locations, ideas and technology. The first pages of issue one and the last pages of issue eight feature a mini-comic about where all the information presented in the limited series is coming from, and who is accessing it, which was a prequel story to the \"Beast Wars\" television series. The series proved to be popular, and a subsequent \"More Than Meets The Eye\" miniseries debuted the next year, this time covering .\n\nThis comic series was based on the new Transformers toyline of that year, \"\". The continuity, while following elements from the cartoon series of the same name, was wholly its own continuity. Differences included the Mini-Cons' ability to talk in a normal way rather than the beeps and boops from the cartoon series. Also, the resolution to the Armada saga was quite different and involved cross-dimensional travel and several Generation 1 characters. The series ended at issue #18 and was retitled as \"\" with the following issue. Originally written by Sarracini, Simon Furman came on board to do a 2-part filler story and ended up as the ongoing writer as a result.\n\nIssues 1–5, written by Chris Saccarini and drawn by James Raiz, would give some background to the original war on Cybertron, detailing how Megatron's campaign started on Cybertron and how the Mini-Cons originally came to Earth, escaping Megatron's grasp. One million years later the arc would introduce the three main human characters (Rad, Alexis and Carlos) and see both sides battle and gain Mini-Cons for the first time.\n\nIssues 6–7 would see Furman take over the scripting, with Pat Lee on art, detailing the discovery of several more Mini-Con teams on Earth. Issues 8–11, with Guido Guidi taking over on art, would see the discovery of a mysterious Mini-Con monolith that would assemble all the Mini-Cons on a base on the moon, leading the Decepticons to attempt a full-scale assault to capture them all. Issues 12–13 would see Megatron construct a superweapon, a powerful laser focusing satellite, in an attempt to destroy the Autobots, as well as capturing enough Mini-Cons to overload Cyclonus's power.\n\nWith the series coming to a close and Energon due to take over as the active franchise comic, issues 14–18 were dedicated to the coming of Unicron, with cameo appearances by several G1 characters. With Don Figueroa on art, it detailed the coming of the Heralds of Unicron into the Armada dimension to secure the Mini-Con Matrix and kill all of Unicron's enemies. The arc introduced Jetfire and the concept of Powerlinking, as well as having a battle between Armada Megatron and G1 Galvatron, Unicron's chief Herald. The final issue, again drawn by Guidi, served as a bridge between the Armada and Energon series, detailing Unicron's defeat and Megatron's disappearance.\n\nThe story to \"\" picks up ten years after events in Armada. The Energon title was written by Simon Furman and drawn by Guido Guidi and Joe Ng. The first issue was #19 since Armada was not cancelled but rather retitled. The series was discontinued at issue #30 due to Dreamwave's bankruptcy.\n\nLaunched in December 2003 Energon would retain the numbering system from Armada, as well as the creative team of Furman and Guidi. Issue 19 would pick up where Armada left off, reintroducing the main cast – as well as Unicron and the new threat of the Terrorcons. Issues 20–23 (drawn by Guidi and Joe Ng) saw the introduction of Unicron's Four Horsemen and most of the relevant cast (Prime, Hot Shot, etc.) receiving their \"Energon\" Powerlinking bodies, as well as establishing that Megatron's Spark was trapped within Unicron. It also saw the Terrorcons journey to Earth and saw the return of the principal human cast, as well as the introduction of Kicker. Issue #24, drawn by James Raiz, focused on the past relationship between Ironhide and Tidal Wave. Issue #25, again drawn by Ng, introduced the Omnicons and Snow Cat. Issues 26–29, drawn by Alex Milne, saw a full-scale Terrorcon attack on Earth, Prime aiding Megatron's rebirth and Starscream's return in his \"Energon\" form. Issue 30 saw a confrontation between Megatron and Scorponok—but the bankruptcy of Dreamwave prevented this story from being finished.\n\nIn 2004 Dreamwave released a three-issue version of the \"More Than Meets The Eye\" series featuring all the \"\" characters released as toys in the United States. Written by Brad Mick aka James McDonough and Adam Patyk with art by many Dreamwave artists (including the interlocking covers by Joe Ng), the layout was similar to the mini-series released in 2003, and included separate character bios for the Minicons as well as for the other Transformers.\n\nThe first pages of issue one and the last pages of issue three feature a mini-comic of the human character Alexis studying the history of the Transformers. The comic was set sometime between the events of the \"Transformers: Armada\" and \"\" Dreamwave comics.\n\nBefore Dreamwave's bankruptcy, an \"Energon\" edition of \"More Than Meets The Eye\" was also planned but not released.\n\nDreamwave Productions and Devil's Due, owner of the G.I. Joe license, each produced their own six-issue mini-series and with separate continuities. Dreamwave's approach, rather than follow the previous efforts of Marvel Comics, had the story set in an alternate continuity, and was written by John Ney Reiber and drawn by Jae Lee. Here, Cobra had discovered and awakened the Decepticons, reformatting their vehicle modes into 1940s era war vehicles and weapons. The two evil forces conquered much of Europe in an alternative version of World War II. G.I. Joe, here a group of American infantry men, find the Autobots who aid them in stopping both Cobra and the Decepticons. Since Dreamwave's demise, the mini-series has been reprinted in trade paperback form by IDW Publishing.\n\nA second volume, \"Divided Front\", was produced. It was written by the writing team of James McDonough and Adam Patyk (who also worked to develop the story treatment for the first volume) and drawn by Pat Lee. Despite strong initial sales of over 44 thousand copies and positive reviews stating the series \"exceeded expectations,\" Dreamwave released only one issue before their financial troubles put a halt to their operations. The story followed \"Transformers/G.I. Joe\", but took place 40 years later in 1985, and was intended to have explained the connection to the first volume's story.\n\nThe \"Transformers Summer Special\" was a one-shot produced in the summer of 2004 that featured stories from \"Generation 1\", \"Energon\", \"Robots in Disguise\", and \"Beast Wars\". The latter two were put to a vote by fans, and the winner (\"Beast Wars\") was to be the next \"Transformers\" comic series (see \"Beast Wars\" (Unreleased) and \"Beast Wars\" (IDW Publishing) Background for more information). The \"Summer Special\" was to be an annual mini-series, but due to Dreamwave's bankruptcy only one issue was published.\n\nThe \"Generation 1\" segment, written by the main \"G1\" creative team of Brad Mick aka James McDonough and Adam Patyk and drawn by Pat Lee and Joe Ng, focused on Megatron and the Predacons. The Predacons were once warlords on Cybertron who were cast into exile in space. Settling on Planet Beest, (a homage to the Battle Beasts toy line), the Predacons sank into a feral state, and lived as inhabitants of that world for untold years, until Megatron arrived. Having been jettisoned into space by Starscream and restored from the brink of death by Wreck-Gar, Megatron now had his sights set on reclaiming the Decepticon leadership, and required the Predacons to bolster his army. Abandoning his personal weaponry, Megatron pursued Razorclaw through the jungle and soundly defeated him in hand-to-hand combat. Subsequently, he re-engineered the Predacons to give them the ability to combine into Predaking. This would later impact the ongoing \"Generation 1\" comic when Megatron brought them to Cybertron to help defeat Shockwave and later to Earth.\n\nThere were three other stories, including a \"\" tale written by Simon Furman and drawn by James Raiz. The tale focused on Slugslinger, Sharkticon and Snow Cat, who had been defeated in an assault by Omega Supreme, telling lies to Megatron in order to excuse their failure. Megatron eventually appoints Slugslinger as his lieutenant, as his lie was the most impressive.\n\nThe other two, both written by Brad Mick aka James McDonough and Adam Patyk, focused around \"Beast Wars\" and \"\". The \"RiD\" tale, drawn by Rob Ruffolo, focused on Scourge and Sky-Byte stealing a nuclear reactor, while Optimus Prime and Ultra Magnus learn the value of teamwork to stop them. The \"Beast Wars\" tale, drawn by Don Figueroa, focused on Rattrap reminiscing on a time when he was attacked by Dinobot 2, only to be saved by a trio of mysterious Maximals.\n\nThe comic shows us a what if there is a Dinobot combiner and the comic can only obtained in Transformers G1 DVDs set split into two comics\n\nIn the Summer Special, a competition was run to choose whether the next Dreamwave Transformers series would be \"Beast Wars\" or \"Transformers: Robots in Disguise\". \"Beast Wars\" won, and the \"Generation One\" team of writers James McDonough and Adam Patyk and artist Don Figueroa were slated as the creative team. However, Dreamwave's bankruptcy would mean that no issues were ever published, although images and issue synopses have appeared on the Internet. After McDonough and Patyk left Dreamwave due to the company's non-payment, writer Simon Furman was added to the series with Figueroa. They would eventually become the creative team on IDW Publishing's \"Beast Wars\" series.\n\nAfter Dreamwave's collapse in the winter of 2004, Hasbro awarded the Transformers comic license to IDW Publishing the following spring with plans to relaunch the property. Two miniseries were initially planned: one featuring the Generation One characters and the other focusing on the \"Beast Wars\". The success of these has led to several other projects as listed below. Long-time Transformers writer Simon Furman was brought aboard and given the creative reigns over both series, as well as their spin-offs. He took the opportunity to reboot the Generation One universe, going in a new direction from any previous incarnation, though retaining key elements such as character personalities and paint schemes.\n\n\"The Transformers: Infiltration\" premiered in October 2005 with issue #0 and properly launched with issue #1 in January 2006. Simon Furman wrote and E. J. Su penciled a new six-issue re-imagining of the Transformers arriving on Earth. The story concluded in July to be continued by \"The Transformers: Escalation\" (see below). A trade paperback of \"Infiltration\" has since been released, as well as a pocket sized Manga edition.\n\nA recent press release indicated that \"The Transformers: Infiltration\" #0 set a record in the five-year history of IDW Publishing, surpassing over 100,000 copies in initial pre-orders.\n\n\"Stormbringer\" debuted in July 2006 and is set during the same time frame as \"Infiltration\" as in the first issue, Optimus Prime receives Ironhide's message from \"Infiltration\". The setting is far from Earth, and the Transformers are scattered across the universe since Cybertron had been made uninhabitable by war. The series' main villain is Thunderwing, and key protagonists include Jetfire and the Technobots. The mini-series was promoted with the tagline \"No Humans on Cybertron!\", referring to many fans' discontent over the human cast of \"Infiltration\". The four-issue series was written by Simon Furman and drawn by Don Figueroa. The two had previously collaborated on several projects for Dreamwave, as well as IDW's own \"Beast Wars: The Gathering\".\n\nThe first issue of \"Stormbringer\" contains the number 7 on the UPC, continuing from \"Infiltration\"' numbering, meaning that despite being sold as mini-series, the G1 comics by Furman are essentially being considered by IDW as a single comic series. This also is continued in \"Escalation\" which starts at #10 on the UPC.\n\nThe \"Spotlight\" series is also set in IDW's new Generation One universe and consists of one-shots focusing on characters who have not yet appeared in IDW's main series. However, their tales will have repercussions on the main story, setting up future events or explaining the history behind events already seen. All issues have so far been written by Simon Furman, except for the issue for Kup which was written by artist Nick Roche. Released \"Spotlight\"s have included Shockwave, Nightbeat, Hot Rod, Sixshot, Ultra Magnus, Soundwave, Kup, Galvatron, Optimus Prime, Ramjet, Blaster, Arcee, Mirage, Grimlock, and Wheelie; four more Spotlight issues are part of the Revelation mini-series and include Cyclonus, Hardhead, Doubledealer, and Sideswipe.\n\nThe sequel series to \"Infiltration\". \"Escalation\" (again written by Furman and drawn by Su) focuses on the Machination, an organization dedicated to capturing Transformer technology, and on Optimus Prime attempting to stop Megatron's attempts to bring about a war which will decimate humanity. The story began in November 2006 and concluded in April 2007, with Megatron's plans stalled and Sunstreaker captured by the Machination. The story will be followed by \"The Transformers: Devastation\" (see below).\n\nThis 4-issue mini-series, written by Eric Holmes and drawn by Alex Milne, was published in the gap between \"Escalation\" and \"Devastation\". Serving as a prequel story to the current IDW Generation One universe \"Megatron Origin\" detail the rise of Megatron to power, the origin of the Decepticons and the beginning of the civil war on Cybertron. The series was due to begin in May, with alternative covers by Milne and Marcelo Matere, but began in June due to artist Alex Milne's illness.\n\n\"Devastation\" picked up where \"Escalation\" left off. It is another six-issue miniseries. Issue 1 of \"Devastation\" was released on October 3, 2007, and was published monthly through March 2008. A follow-up titled \"\" was also released as part of the Spotlight series (see above).\n\nIn addition to their main Generation 1 continuity, IDW has also created a variety of material based on the various Transformers universes, both the original animated series as well as original material and the 2007 live-action movie.\n\n\"Beast Wars: The Gathering\" was released in 2006 as a four-issue series written by the \"Stormbringer\" team of Furman and Figueroa. The series takes place after season 2 of the \"Beast Wars\" animated series and features characters that had toys produced but were not featured in the cartoon. The trade paperback was released in August 2006. A second series called \"The Ascending\" was released in August 2007, with a 3-issue bi-monthly series of \"More Than Meets The Eye\"-style profile books titled \"Beast Wars: Sourcebook\" released in August. The continuity is separate from the new IDW Generation One universe, and is set in-continuity with the original show.\n\n\"Generations\" is a series that reprints key or best-of issues from the Marvel series but with new cover art. Issues containing Marvel characters (such as the original issue #3, which featured Spider-Man) could not be reprinted for this series. Also, using any Dreamwave material is not possible at this time due to legal ramifications from their bankruptcy. After issue #12 was released in March 2007, the series began to reprint the Marvel UK arc \"\" in condensed form, beginning in April, although the Target: 2006 reprints do not feature the \"Generations\" title on the cover. Following this there will be a \"Best of UK\" series focusing on the Dinobots.\n\n\"Evolutions\" is a title that features stand-alone, out-of-continuity tales from rotating creative teams. Chuck Dixon wrote the first four-part series \"Hearts of Steel\", revolving around steam-powered Transformers on Earth in the 19th Century, with art by former Dreamwave artist Guido Guidi. It premiered in July 2006. At its conclusion, the publishers warned that they needed to be conservative with alternate-reality stories, because both they and Hasbro did not want to make things too confusing before the 2007 movie was released. For this reason, the series is on hold until after the movie premieres, but a trade paperback has been released.\n\n\"Transformers: The Animated Movie\" is a four-issue comic book adaptation of the classic 1986 in correspondence with the 20th anniversary of the film's release. The first issue was released in October 2006 and the run coincided with the release of the Sony/BMG 20th Anniversary \"The Transformers: The Movie\" Special Edition DVD, released on November 7, 2006. The adaptation was written by former Marvel Transformers writer Bob Budiansky and illustrated by Don Figueroa. The series included scenes and characters in the comic that did not make it into the movie.\n\nTransformers is a comic book series by IDW Publishing, based upon the 2007 \"Transformers\" movie.\n\n\"Balancing Act\", released by IDW in April 2007, is a collection of stories from the \"Hasbro Collector's Club Magazine\" that were published from 2005 to 2006. The stories were written by Forrest Lee and illustrated by Dan Khanna.\n\nIDW also published a bimonthly \"Transformers Magazine\". It features strips from the original Marvel US \"The Transformers\" series, Dreamwave's \"\" comic and IDW's own \"\" series. Spotlight artist Robby Musso provides original covers. The first issue came due out in June 2007.\n\nFrom July 2012 to March 2014, IDW published the series \"Transformers: Regeneration One\". It continued the Marvel Comics canceled \"Transformers\" series picking up after the final issue (#80) which was published in July 1991. 21 years later, the series (now under IDW) resumed, and featured the same artists and writer from the final issues of the original Marvel series: Simon Furman, Andrew Wildman, and Stephen Baskerville. The series was revived for the sole purpose of tying up loose ends and ended with #100 where the cover read \"#100 in a four issue limited series\". In January 2013, IDW began reprinting the series as a 4 volume trade paperback series.\n\nThere have been some promotional comics by various small publishers, often lacking a cohesive fictional universe.\n\nThe previous official Transformers convention had comics printed as merchandise. The comics included \"Tales from the Beast Wars\" (2 issues), \"Transformers: The Wreckers\" (3 issues) and \"Transformers: Universe\" (3 issues).\n\nIn spring 1999, new publisher Benchpress Comics announced they acquired the rights to produce new G.I. Joe and Transformers comics. The plan was to release two Transformers monthly series, one would feature the Generation 1 cast of characters and a second title would focus on \"Beast Wars\". Benchpress went bankrupt before a single issue was published.\n\nIn 1987, Blackthorne Publishing released \"The Transformers in 3-D\", a comic book series that ran separately from the Marvel Transformers comic book series. The series had three issues, with 28 pages per issue. The comic was not widely distributed, affording the collection to be a rare item. The series is set in the post-\"\" era, featuring characters like Galvatron and Ultra Magnus. Other characters include Optimus Prime, Ironhide, Cosmos, Cyclonus, Razorclaw, Ratbat, Scorponok, Octane and the Quintessons. It also introduced a faction known as the Destructons, who later reappeared in BotCon fiction. Another Blackthorne Publishing Transformers product was a four issue \"How to Draw Transformers\" series which gave tips and methods to illustrating the characters.\n\nDevil's Due Publishing experienced success with their revived \"G.I Joe\" series under license by Hasbro. Both companies produced their own six-issue mini-series detailing a crossover between the two with permission from Hasbro, but Dreamwave had the exclusive license to produce \"Transformers\" comics, while Devil's Due had the exclusive license to \"G.I. Joe\"; hence the two different miniseries from both companies with two different ideas behind each company's respective franchise. A second series followed in late 2004, followed by a third in 2005, and a fourth in 2006.\n\nThe Devil's Due story, written by company president Josh Blaylock and illustrated by Mike S. Miller, takes place in an alternate present day where Cobra has uncovered the Ark. Cobra removes the deactivated Transformers found inside, adapting them into Cobra assault vehicles. G.I. Joe is formed to stop Cobra and receives unexpected help from Wheeljack and Bumblebee. When the Transformers eventually break free, G.I Joe are forced to battle the Autobots, Decepticons and Cobra in order to stop a malfunctioning satellite weapons system and prevent the detonation of a nuclear device reacting with Energon.\n\nThe second four-issue mini-series was written by Dan Jolley and drawn by Tim Seeley and E. J. Su. Cobra was shattered in the first series, but Cobra Commander survived and recruited Destro to help steal Teletran-3. An accident occurs, causing several Joes and Cobra members to be transported to Cybertron. The accident pulls several Transformers to Earth, as well as scattering the characters throughout time. The Joes and Cobra travel into the past and future to retrieve the missing Autobots and Decepticons before the Earth is destroyed.\n\nA five-issue series written by Seeley and drawn by Joe Ng (with help from James Raiz and Alex Milne). Parts from Megatron have been used to create a re-imagined version of the classic G.I Joe villain Serpentor. Freed by a Cobra raid, Serpentor travels to Cybertron and gathers a massive Decepticon army to seize the Autobot Matrix of Leadership. Cybertron hangs in the balance, causing a disparate group of Joes and Autobots to unite to stop Serpentor.\n\nA two-part series (written by Seeley and drawn by Andrew Wildman) connecting from the end of \"The Art of War\". Hawk, now resigned from G.I. Joe, has teamed up with a group of Autobots under Prowl to stop the spread of Cybertronian technology on Earth. They are unaware that a bigger threat looms, an alliance of Cobra-La and Unicron. The series consists of two double-sized issues.\n\nAccording to writer Seeley, the plot of \"Black Horizon\" is the one he initially wanted to use for \"The Art of War\", but was turned down by Hasbro, leading to the use of a re-imagined Serpentor instead. The series' format was also changed from four regular issues to two double-sized issues, as Hasbro wanted to avoid competition with the 2007 Movie tie-in comics.\n\n\"See also Devil's Due's G.I. Joe vs. Transformers section in G.I. Joe (comics).\"\n\nPanini Comics published a \"\" comic in the United Kingdom in 2003, aiming at younger readers. The series lasted nine issues. It was written by Simon Furman. The comics included backing stories called \"Tales of the Mini-Cons\" which spotlighted those particular characters.\n\nTo coincide with the release of the 2007 movie, Titan Magazines produced a new UK monthly title called \"Transformers\". The first issue went on sale on July 27, 2007. The book contains a ten-page original lead strip, and reprints six or seven pages per issue of IDW's movie prequels and \"Beast Wars: The Gathering\". It is edited by Steve White, who also worked for Marvel UK's Transformers title; the UK strips are written by Simon Furman. Artists have included Geoff Senior and Nick Roche, and are to include Andrew Wildman, Don Figueroa and Nick Roche, with Guido Guidi and Marcelo Matere confirmed on issues 5 and 6.\n\nThe UK original strips open each issue and tie into the continuity of . Each one focuses on one character. The first two stories – \"Optimus Prime\" and \"Megatron\" – focused on Optimus sending the Allspark into space to keep it out of Megatron's hands. Megatron heads after it, following his interrogation of Bumblebee in the movie prequel, and Jazz, Ratchet and Ironhide attempt to stop him. He sends Devastator after them with a foldspace warhead, causing all four to be \"lost in space\".\n\nEach issue comes with a free gift. #1 had dog tags with Autobot or Decepticon logos on them, #2 had removable tattoos, #3 had a keyring, which would be either the Autobots or Decepticons logo, and #4 had 4 badges.\n\nA mini-comic that was packaged with various series of toys, and printed in various languages. The comics told small side stories relating to the premise of the associated toyline and exist in their own continuities.\n\nAn eight-page mini-comic that was sold with the Optimus Primal/bat and Megatron/crocodile Beast Wars toys. The mini-comic establishes the Maximals and Predacons on present-day Earth, which contradicts the time-travel story later set by the Beast Wars television series and toy descriptions.\n\nThe mini-comic features appearances by Optimus Primal, Megatron, Cheetor, Razorbeast, Waspinator, and Tarantulas, but only Optimus and Megatron have speaking parts.\n\nA four-part series released throughout the Armada toy line. The series was produced by the same team that started on Dreamwave's \"Transformers: Armada\" comic, story by Chris Saccarini and illustrated by James Raiz. The first 2 volumes were printed in English, Spanish, and French.\n\nVolume 1 features Optimus Prime, Megatron, Hot Shot, Jolt, Cyclonus and Crumplezone. Volume 2 introduces Scavenger and Rollbar vs. the Mini-Con Destruction Team and Starscream. The third volume features the Mini-Con Air Defense Team captured by Galvatron before being rescued by Optimus Prime and Jetfire. In the final volume, Optimus Prime, Overload and Roll Out face off against Galvatron who combines with Tidal Wave.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2268669", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2268669", "title": "Resource holding potential", "text": "Resource holding potential\n\nIn biology, resource holding potential (RHP) is the ability of an animal to win an all-out fight if one were to take place. The term was coined by Geoff Parker to disambiguate physical fighting ability from the motivation to persevere in a fight (Parker, 1974). Originally the term used was 'resource holding power', but 'resource holding potential' has come to be preferred. The latter emphasis on 'potential' serves as a reminder that the individual with greater RHP does not always prevail. \n\nAn individual with more RHP may lose a fight if, for example, it is less motivated (has less to gain by winning) than its opponent. Mathematical models of RHP and motivation ( resource value or V) have traditionally been based on the hawk-dove game (e.g. Hammerstein, 1981) in which subjective resource value is represented by the variable 'V'. In addition to RHP and V, George Barlow (Barlow et al., 1986) proposed that a third variable, which he termed 'daring', played a role in determining fight outcome. Daring (a.k.a. aggressiveness) represents an individual's tendency to initiate or escalate a contest independent of the effects of RHP and V.\n\nIt is instinctive for all animals to live a life according to fitness (Parker 1974). Animals will do what they can to improve their fitness and therefore survive long enough to produce offspring. However when resources are not in abundance, this can be challenging; eventually, animals will begin to compete for resources. The competition for resources can be dangerous and for some animals, deadly. Some animals have developed adaptive traits that increase their chances of survival when competing for resources. This trait is Resource Holding Potential (RHP) (Parker 1974). Resource Holding Potential, or Resource Holding Power, is the term defining the motivation an individual has to continue to fight, work, or endure through situations that others may give up during. Animals that use RHP often evaluate the conditions of the danger they face. These animals have the ability to assess the RHP of their opponent in relation to their own (Francesca Gherardi 2006). Generally, the animal with the higher RHP survives and wins the disputes they encounter (Lindström and Pampoulie 2005). The determinations of who has the higher RHP can vary. In some cases, the robust size of the animal will establish one’s dominance. However, RHP can also be measured by prior residency and knowledge of resource quality (Lindström and Pampoulie 2005). In this case, RHP is not about the direct dangers that come with standing one’s ground; sometimes, an animal will use RHP to determine if their current living status is worth protecting. With that being said, RHP does not take does not so much focus on the physical ability of the individual to fight, but instead focuses on the motivation of the individual. RHP does not always determine if the individual will prevail (Hurd 2006). RHP along with other variables including the value of the resource and the aggressiveness (or daring) of the individual all help to determine how likely it is that an individual will initiate and prevail in a fight.\n\nMale sand gobies (a ray-finned fish) must build large nests in order to attract a mate, and to be able to house numerous eggs. If the male is small and not very attractive but has a large nest, he is at risk of a larger more attractive male coming by at “steal” the nest. On the other hand, if the male is larger in size but lives in a smaller nest, he has a lesser chance of finding a mate and less space to house his offspring. In either case, the male sand goby must use RHP to determine whether it is more fit for him to stay or move on (Lindström and Pampoulie 2005).\n\nIn \"Aegus chelifer chelifer,\" a small tropical beetle species, head width is considered a resource holding potential. Researchers discovered that body size, rather than mandible size, had a bigger effect on the outcome of fights between the beetles, making it their resource holding potential (Songvorawit et al. 2018).\nIn the sea anemone, \"Actinia equina\", morphological traits appear to determine their resource holding potential. \"A. equina\" does a “self-assessment” of their RHP when fighting nearby anemones. Body size appears to be the main RHP unless a peel occurs due to contact with another anemone where toxin is released. If a peel occurs then nematocyst length is the main factor to their RHP (Rudin and Briffa 2012).\n\nThe topic of resource holding power has some similar characteristics to the behavior of conditional migration. The thought process of “What benefit do I receive from this action,” is a similarity between the two. If an all out fight only has two outcomes, death, or winning the competition for resources, than the individuals will be less likely to interact with one another and instigate a fight because the outcomes would be so severe. Similar concepts can be applied to the conditional migration behavior. Subordinate males will be less likely to migrate because of the severe outcomes that come from the migration. If subordinates migrate with dominant males to a place where resources will be limited their likelihood of surviving is greatly reduced. What benefit could they receive knowing that most likely they are going to lose resources.\n\nConditional strategy - socially dominant individuals will be in a position to select the best option relative to their fitness.\n\n"}

The population in 2011 was 871, in an area of 1.40 km.\n\nThe origin of the toponymy \"paul do mar\" is linked to its geographic position, since \"paul\" refers to an elongated zone, which is justified by the parish's location along the southwest coast of Madeira. Its exposure to the ocean, and historical periods when the sea bathed the area with seawater, once characterised the area as the \"Sitio da Lagoa\" or \"Alagoa\" ( or \"the lake\"). Historically, the area experienced flooding from the sea when the Atlantic submerged and inundated fields to a depth of one metre. As a result, a salt factory was established. But, this was closed long ago. Since the construction of a new higher sea wall and ocean front with road and parking the sea flooding has stopped.\n\nPaul do Mar's Catholic Church is dedicated to the patron saint of the village Santo Amaro.\n\nPaul do Mar is accessible by two roads: one connecting the parish with Porto Moniz, Santana, Calheta and Funchal to the east, and another which connects the village to Fajã da Ovelha and Jardim do Mar, along the Atlantic Ocean. It is located about 3 km from the urbanized area of Calheta and about 1 km from Fajã da Ovelha. Calheta has an important art centre () and many of the typical facilities that you would expect in a small village. The historic municipal pedestrian way Caminho Real connects Paúl do Mar with Prazeres. During low tide and when the sea is not too rough, it is possible to walk along the rocky beach to Jardim do Mar.\n\nThe parish is divided into five localities:\n\nSport is popular, and football clubs include the \"Paulense\" (representing the locality of Ribeira das Galinhas, Serrado da Cruz and Lagoa) and the \"Santo Amaro\" club (which represented the localities of Igreja and Quebrada).\n\nThe main activity in Paul do Mar and its area is fishing and agriculture, particularly the cultivation of banana and tourism including eco-tourism activities such as dolphin and whalewatching.\n\nPaul do Mar has significant commercial businesses for a village, including shops, a small supermarket, bars, cafes, restaurants, a patisserie/bakery, a main primary school, Catholic church, a health centre, a bank, a football ground, a four-star hotel, and a number of self-catering holiday houses and apartments.\n\n\nThere are many festas in the village throughout the year particularly in the summer months including the festa celebrating the Patron Saint of the village Santo Amaro from 14–15 January and The Festa da Lapa (the festival of the shellfish/limpets) which lasts from a Friday to a Sunday night in the month of July.\n\nThe waves break large and surfing is enjoyed here by experienced surfers. In 2001 Paul do Mar was one of the venues for the World Surfing Championships.\n\n\n"}

He calls his superiors and obtains permission to undertake a dangerous technique called \"Degree Absolute\" in a final attempt to break Number Six and learn why he resigned from his position as an intelligence agent. Number Six is put into a trance state, causing his mind to regress back to his childhood. He is taken to the \"Embryo Room\", deep below the Green Dome, filled with various props, as well as a caged room that contains living space and a kitchen. He, Number Two, and the Butler (Angelo Muscat) are subsequently locked into the room via a timer that will unlock the room after one week.\n\nNumber Two begins to use regressive therapy following Shakespeare's Seven Ages of Man, using the various props to enact a series of psychodramas, with Number Two playing the authority figure (e.g., father, headmaster, employer) and Number Six the subject (child, student, employee). Each drama is aimed at trying to make Number Six explain why he resigned. During the first six of these, Number Two finds Number Six has developed an aversion to saying the word \"six\". Number Two also comes to like and respect Number Six as he learns more about him.\n\nOn the final day, Number Two enacts the role of military jailer, harshly interrogating Number Six as a prisoner of war. Number Two's efforts seem to have effect as Number Two starts to blather on reasons for resigning, but he becomes concerned when Number Six says he knew too much, including about Number Two. Number Two becomes agitated, and Number Six continues to call him a fool and an idiot. Suddenly, Number Six starts counting down from \"six\", and by the time he has reached zero, has regained full control of his mind. Already exhausted from his efforts, Number Two is shocked. Now in control, Number Six explains that Degree Absolute, a well-known psychiatric technique, has its risks to the one performing the therapy if they have their own psychological problems. Number Six shows this understanding in a brief role reversal (by asking Number Two \"Why don't you resign?\"), much to Number Two's delighted amusement.\n\nNumber Two recovers and joyfully offers Number Six a tour of the Embryo Room. They end at the door timer, finding only five minutes remain before the room unlocks. Number Two becomes scared and pleads with Number Six to tell him why he resigned. Number Six remains quiet as Number Two goes to the kitchen area and pours them both a glass of wine. Number Six suddenly closes the door to the caged area, locking a panicked Number Two inside. The Butler takes the key from Number Two. Number Two paces the caged area while a voice screams \"Die, Six, die!\", until the timer runs out. Number Two falls over, apparently dead. The door to the Embryo room opens where the Supervisor (Peter Swanwick) waits. He tells Number Six they will need the body and then asks Number Six what he wants. Number Six only replies \"Number One\", and the Supervisor offers to take him there. He, Number Six, and the Butler depart the room.\n\n\nThe broadcast date of the episode varied in different ITV regions of the UK. The episode was first shown on Scottish Television Thursday 25 January 1968, on Friday 26 January on ATV Midlands and Grampian Television, on Sunday 28 January on ATV London, whose broadcasts were also taken up by Southern Television, Westward Television and Tyne-Tees; on Friday 2 February on Border Television, on Saturday 3 February on Anglia Television and on Friday 23 February on Granada Television in the North West. The aggregate viewing figures for the ITV regions that debuted the season in 1967 have been estimated at 9.2 million. In Northern Ireland, the episode did not debut until Saturday 6 April 1968, and in Wales, the episode was not broadcast until Wednesday 8 April 1970.\n\n\n"}

He is noted for his work in Indo-European linguistics.\n\nHe was educated at the universities of Halle and Leipzig. He taught at the gymnasium at Wiesbaden and at Leipzig, and in 1872-77 was assistant at the Russian Institute of Classical Philology at the latter. In 1877 he was lecturer at the University of Leipzig, and in 1882 became professor of comparative philology there. In 1884 he took the same position at the University of Freiburg, but returned to Leipzig in 1887 as successor to Georg Curtius; for the rest of his professional life (until 1919), Brugmann was professor of Sanskrit and comparative linguistics there. \n\nAs a young man, Brugmann sided with the emerging Neogrammarian school, which asserted the inviolability of phonetic laws (Brugmann's law) and adhered to a strict research methodology. As well as in laying stress on the observation of phonetic laws and their operation, it emphasized the working of analogy as an important linguistic factor in modern languages.\n\nAs joint editor with Curtius of \"The Studies in Greek and Latin Grammar\", he wrote an article for this work on “Nasalis Sonans,” in which he defended theories so radical that Curtius afterward disclaimed them.\nBrugmann's fame rests on the two volumes on phonology, morphology, and word formation which he contributed to the five-volume \"Grundriss der vergleichenden Grammatik der indogermanischen Sprachen\" (“Outline of the Comparative Grammar of the Indo-Germanic Languages”), published from 1886 to 1893. The other three volumes were written by Berthold Delbrück and provided a still-unsurpassed account of Proto-Indo-European syntax. \nBrugmann's work overflowed the bounds assigned to it, so the first volume was split into two parts. With the indexes split off into a separate volume, the two volumes turned into four. \n\nRealizing the importance of Brugmann's work, three British linguists began publishing an English translation of Brugmann's volumes almost simultaneously with the German edition, under the title \"Elements of the Comparative Grammar of the Indo-Germanic Languages\". This divided Brugmann's second volume into two parts, making a total of five volumes including the indices.\n\nBeginning in 1897, Brugmann began publishing a revision and expansion of his portion of the \"Grundriss\". The final volume of the resulting second edition was published in 1916. \n\nBrugmann's method in presenting his data was radical and can still raise eyebrows today. On most topics, instead of presenting discursive arguments, he simply listed the data which he felt were relevant. The reader was obliged to make up his own mind as to their interpretation. This totally empirical presentation multiplies the time necessary to follow Brugmann's argument, but makes the effort all the more fruitful. \n\nBrugmann's great work did not come out of the blue. It was based on the previous Indo-Germanic grammar by August Schleicher, and that in turn on the previous effort of Franz Bopp. In addition, Brugmann stayed in touch closely with the scholars who were revolutionizing Indo-European linguistics for the daughter languages, in particular Bartholomae for Old Iranian, Hübschmann for Armenian, and Rudolf Thurneysen for Old Irish. \n\nIn 1902-1904, Brugmann published an abridged and slightly modified version of his \"Grammar\", which is still considered a useful reference work by some but does not contain the wealth of data of the longer versions. A French translation of this abridged version exists.\n\nThe total list of Brugmann's works is much longer than this. Some of them were important in their time and some are still of continuing interest, but it is on the two editions of the \"Grundriss\" that his reputation rests. They remain indispensable to every Indo-Europeanist and of great interest to anybody interested in language.\n\nBrugmann was knighted by the King of Saxony, and in 1896 he was invited to attend the jubilee of Princeton University, where he received the degree of doctor of laws.\n\n\nWith Wilhelm Streitberg, he founded the journal \"Indogermanische Forschungen\" (“Indo-European Research”)\n\n"}
{"id": "2268706", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2268706", "title": "History of the Jews in Spain", "text": "History of the Jews in Spain\n\nThe history of the Jews in Spain stretches back to Biblical times according to Jewish history. Spanish Jews once constituted one of the largest and most prosperous Jewish communities in the world. Spain was the unquestioned leader of world Jewry: scientific and philological study of the Hebrew Bible began, secular poetry was written in Hebrew for the first time, and for the only time between Biblical times and the origins of the modern state of Israel, a Jew (Samuel ha-Nagid) commanded a Jewish army. This period ended definitively with the anti-Jewish riots of 1391 and the Alhambra Decree of 1492, as a result of which the majority of Jews in Spain (around 300,000) converted to Catholicism and those who continued to practice Judaism (between 40,000 and 80,000) were forced into exile, although many thousands returned in the years following the expulsion.\n\nAn estimated 13,000 to 50,000 Jews live in Spain today, concentrated in the provinces of Malaga, Madrid and Barcelona as well as having a historic presence in the autonomous cities of Ceuta and Melilla. A significant portion of these are Spanish-speaking Jews who returned to Spain after centuries of exile in northern Morocco both during and after the Spanish protectorate. Ashkenazi Jews, primarily from Latin America but also of European origin, are also present in Spain. In 2014, the descendants of Sephardi Jews who were exiled in 1492 were offered Spanish citizenship, without being required to move to Spain and/or renounce any other citizenship which they currently may have. (See Christian–Jewish reconciliation#Spanish and Portuguese law of return.) The deadline for applications was September 2019, by which time 130,000 Jews had applied.\n\nSome associate the country of Tarshish, as mentioned in the books of Jeremiah, Ezekiel, I Kings, Jonah and Romans, with a locale in southern Spain. In generally describing Tyre's empire from west to east, Tarshish is listed first (Ezekiel 27.12–14), and in Jonah 1.3 it is the place to which Jonah sought to flee from the Lord; evidently it represents the westernmost place to which one could sail.\n\nThe link between Jews and Tarshish is clear. One might speculate that commerce conducted by Jewish emissaries, merchants, craftsmen, or other tradesmen among the Semitic Tyrean Phoenicians might have brought them to Tarshish. Although the notion of Tarshish as Spain is merely based on suggestive material, it leaves open the possibility of a very early Jewish presence in the Iberian peninsula.\n\nMore substantial evidence of Jews in Spain comes from the Roman era. Although the spread of the Jews into Europe is most commonly associated with the diaspora, which ensued from the Roman conquest of Judea, emigration from Eretz Yisrael into the greater Roman Mediterranean area predated the destruction of Jerusalem at the hands of the Romans under Titus. In his \"Facta et dicta memorabilia\", Valerius Maximus makes reference to Jews and Chaldaeans being expelled from Rome in 139 BCE for their \"corrupting\" influences. According to Josephus, King Agrippa attempted to discourage the Jews of Jerusalem from rebelling against Roman authority by reference to Jews throughout the Roman Empire and elsewhere; Agrippa warned that \"the danger concerns not those Jews that dwell here only, but those of them which dwell in other cities also; for there is no people upon the habitable earth which do not have some portion of you among them, whom your enemies might slay, in case you go to war...\"\n\nThe Provençal rabbi and scholar, Rabbi Abraham ben David, wrote in \"anno\" 1161: “A tradition exists with the [Jewish] community of Granada that they are from the inhabitants of Jerusalem, of the descendants of Judah and Benjamin, rather than from the villages, the towns in the outlying districts [of Palestine].” Elsewhere, he writes about his maternal grandfather's family and how they came to Spain: \"When Titus prevailed over Jerusalem, his officer who was appointed over Hispania appeased him, requesting that he send to him captives made-up of the nobles of Jerusalem, and so he sent a few of them to him, and there were amongst them those who made curtains and who were knowledgeable in the work of silk, and [one] whose name was Baruch, and they remained in Mérida.\" Here, Rabbi Abraham ben David refers to the second influx of Jews into Spain, shortly after the destruction of Israel's Second Temple.\n\nThe earliest mention of Spain (Hispania) is, allegedly, found in Obadiah 1:20: “And the exiles of this host of the sons of Israel who are among the Canaanites as far as Ṣarfat (Heb. צרפת), and the exiles of Jerusalem who are in Sepharad, will possess the cities of the south.” While the medieval lexicographer, David ben Abraham Al-Fāsī, identifies Ṣarfat with the city of Ṣarfend (Judeo-Arabic: צרפנדה), the word Sepharad (Heb. ספרד) in the same verse has been translated by the 1st century rabbinic scholar, Yonathan Ben Uzziel, as \"Aspamia\". Based on a later teaching in the compendium of Jewish oral laws compiled by Rabbi Judah Hanasi in 189 CE, known as the Mishnah, \"Aspamia\" is associated with a very far place, generally thought of as Hispania, or Spain. In \"circa\" 960 CE, Ḥisdai ibn Šaprūṭ, minister of trade in the court of the caliph in Córdoba, wrote to Joseph, the king of Khazaria, saying: “The name of our land in which we dwell is called in the sacred tongue, \"Sepharad\", but in the language of the Arabs, the indwellers of the lands, \"Alandalus\" [Andalusia], the name of the capital of the kingdom, Córdoba.”\n\nAccording to Rabbi David Kimchi (1160–1235), in his commentary on Obadiah 1:20, Ṣarfat and Sepharad, both, refer to the Jewish captivity (Heb. \"galut\") expelled during the war with Titus and who went as far as the countries \"Alemania\" (Germany), \"Escalona\", France and Spain. The names Ṣarfat and Sepharad are explicitly mentioned by him as being France and Spain, respectively. Some scholars think that, in the case of the place-name, Ṣarfat (lit. Ṣarfend) – which, as noted, was applied to the Jewish diaspora in France, the association with France was made only exegetically because of its similarity in spelling with the name פרנצא (France), by a reversal of its letters.\n\nSpanish Jew, Moses de León (ca. 1250 – 1305), mentions a tradition concerning the first Jewish exiles, saying that the vast majority of the first exiles driven away from the land of Israel during the Babylonian captivity refused to return, for they had seen that the Second Temple would be destroyed like the first. In yet another teaching, passed down later by Moses ben Machir in the 16th century, an explicit reference is made to the fact that Jews have lived in Spain since the destruction of the First Temple:\nSimilarly, Gedaliah ibn Jechia the Spaniard has written:\n\nDon Isaac Abrabanel, a prominent Jewish figure in Spain in the 15th century and one of the king's trusted courtiers who witnessed the expulsion of Jews from Spain in 1492, informs his readers that the first Jews to reach Spain were brought by ship to Spain by a certain Phiros who was confederate with the king of Babylon when he laid siege to Jerusalem. This man was a Grecian by birth, but who had been given a kingdom in Spain. He became related by marriage to a certain Espan, the nephew of king Heracles, who also ruled over a kingdom in Spain. This Heracles later renounced his throne because of his preference for his native country in Greece, leaving his kingdom to his nephew, Espan, by whom the country of España (Spain) derives its name. The Jewish exiles transported there by the said Phiros were descended by lineage from Judah, Benjamin, Shimon and Levi, and were, according to Abrabanel, settled in two districts in southern Spain: one, Andalusia, in the city of Lucena - a city so-called by the Jewish exiles that had come there; the second, in the country around \"Ṭulayṭulah\" (Toledo).\n\nAbrabanel says that the name \"Ṭulayṭulah\" (Toledo) was given to the city by its first Jewish inhabitants, and surmises that the name may have meant טלטול (= wandering), on account of their wandering from Jerusalem. He says, furthermore, that the original name of the city was Pirisvalle, so-called by its early pagan inhabitants. He also writes there that he found written in the ancient annals of Spanish history collected by the kings of Spain that the 50,000 Jewish households then residing in the cities throughout Spain were the descendants of men and women who were sent to Spain by the Roman Emperor and who had formerly been subjected to him and whom Titus had originally exiled from places in or around Jerusalem. The two Jewish exiles joined together and became one.\n\nHispania came under Roman control with the fall of Carthage after the Second Punic War (218–202 BCE). Exactly how soon after this time Jews made their way onto the scene is a matter of speculation. It is within the realm of possibility that they went there under the Romans as free men to take advantage of its rich resources and build enterprises there. These early arrivals would have been joined by those who had been enslaved by the Romans under Vespasian and Titus, and dispersed to the extreme west during the period of the Jewish-Roman War, and especially after the defeat of Judea in 70. The Jewish historian, Josephus, confirms that as early as 90 CE there was already a Jewish \"Diaspora\" living in Europe, made-up of the two tribes, Judah and Benjamin. Thus, he writes in his \"Antiquities\": “ …there are but two tribes in Asia (Turkey) and Europe subject to the Romans, while the ten tribes are beyond Euphrates till now and are an immense multitude.” One estimate places the number carried off to Spain at 80,000. (Graetz, p. 42). Subsequent immigrations came into the area along both the northern African and southern European sides of the Mediterranean. (Assis, p. 9.)\n\nAmong the earliest records which may refer specifically to Jews in Spain during the Roman period is Paul's \"Letter to the Romans\". Many have taken Paul's intention to go to Spain to minister the gospel (15.24, 28) to indicate the presence of Jewish communities there, as has Herod's banishment to Spain by Caesar in 39 (Flavius Josephus, \"The Wars of the Jews\", 2.9.6). So too, the Mishna implied that there was a Jewish community in Spain, and that there was communication with the Jewish community in Israel.\n\nFrom a slightly later period, \"Midrash Rabbah\" (Leviticus Rabba § 29.2), and \"Pesikta de-Rav Kahana\" (\"Rosh Hashanna\"), both, make mention of the Jewish Diaspora in Spain (Hispania) and their eventual return. Among these early references are several decrees of the Council of Elvira, convened in the early fourth century, which address proper Christian behavior with regard to the Jews of Spain, notably forbidding marriage between Jews and Christians.\n\nOf material evidence of early Iberian Jewry, representing a particularly early presence is a signet ring found at Cadiz, dating from the 8th–7th century BCE The inscription on the ring, generally accepted as Phoenician, has been interpreted by a few scholars to be \"paleo-hebraic\" (Bowers, p. 396). Among the early Spanish items of more reliably Jewish origins is an amphora which is at least as old as the 1st century. Although this vessel is not from the Spanish mainland (it was recovered from Ibiza, in the Balearic Islands), the imprint upon it of two Hebrew characters attests to Jewish contact, either direct or indirect, with the area at this time. Two trilingual Jewish inscriptions from Tarragona and Tortosa have been variously dated from the 2nd century BCE to the 6th century. (Bowers, p. 396.) There is also the tombstone inscription from Adra (formerly Abdera) of a Jewish girl named Salomonula, which dates to the early 3rd century (\"Encyclopaedia Judaica\", p. 221).\n\nThus, while there are limited material and literary indications for Jewish contact with Spain from a very early period, more definitive and substantial data begins with the third century. Data from this period suggest a well-established community, whose foundations must have been laid some time earlier. It is likely that these communities originated several generations earlier in the aftermath of the conquest of Judea, and possible that they originated much earlier. There may have been close contact between the Jewish community of Babylon and Spain, as the Talmud documents that Yitzhak the Exilarch, son of the sister of Rav Beivai traveled from \"Cordoba to Hispania\".\n\nAs citizens of the Roman Empire, the Jews of Spain engaged in a variety of occupations, including agriculture. Until the adoption of Christianity, Jews had close relations with non-Jewish populations, and played an active role in the social and economic life of the province (Assis at p. 9). The edicts of the Synod of Elvira, although early examples of priesthood-inspired anti-Semitism, provide evidence of Jews who were integrated enough into the greater community to cause alarm among some: of the Council's 80 canonic decisions, all which pertain to Jews served to maintain a separation between the two communities (Laeuchli, pp. 75–76). It seems that by this time the presence of Jews was of greater concern to Catholic authorities than the presence of pagans; Canon 16, which prohibited marriage with Jews, was worded more strongly than canon 15, which prohibited marriage with pagans. Canon 78 threatens those who commit adultery with Jews with ostracism. Canon 48 forbade Jews from blessing Christian crops, and Canon 50 forbade sharing meals with Jews; repeating the command to Hebrew the Bible indicated respect to Gentile.\n\nBarbarian invasions brought most of the Iberian Peninsula under Visigothic rule by the early 5th century. Other than in their contempt for Catholics, who reminded them of the Romans, the Visigoths did not generally take much of an interest in the religious creeds within their kingdom. It wasn't until 506, when Alaric II (484–507) published his \"Breviarium Alaricianum\" (wherein he adopted the laws of the ousted Romans), that a Visigothic king concerned himself with the Jews.\nThe tides turned even more dramatically following the conversion of the Visigothic royal family under Recared from Arianism to Catholicism in 587. In their desire to consolidate the realm under the new religion, the Visigoths adopted an aggressive policy concerning the Jews. As the king and the church acted in a single interest, the situation for the Jews deteriorated. Recared approved the Third Council of Toledo's move in 589 to forcibly baptize the children of mixed marriages between Jews and Christians. Toledo III also forbade Jews from holding public office, from having intercourse with Christian women, and from performing circumcisions on slaves or Christians. Still, Recared was not entirely successful in his campaigns: not all Visigoth Arians had converted to Catholicism; the unconverted were true allies of the Jews, oppressed like themselves, and Jews received some protection from Arian bishops and the independent Visigothic nobility.\nWhile the policies of subsequent Kings Liuva II (601–604), Witteric (603–610), and Gundemar (610–612) are unknown to us, Sisebut (612–620) embarked on Recared's course with renewed vigor. Soon after upholding the edict of compulsory baptism for children of mixed marriages, Sisebut instituted what was to become an unfortunate recurring phenomenon in Spanish official policy, in issuing the first edicts against the Jews of expulsion from Spain. Following his 613 decree that the Jews either convert or be expelled, some fled to Gaul and North Africa, while as many as 90,000 converted. Many of these \"conversos\", as did those of later periods, maintained their Jewish identities in secret. During the more tolerant reign of Suintila (621–631), however, most of the \"conversos\" returned to Judaism, and a number of the exiles returned to Spain.\n\nIn 633, the Fourth Council of Toledo, while taking a stance in opposition to compulsory baptism, convened to address the problem of crypto-Judaism. It was decided that, if a professed Christian were determined to be a practicing Jew, his or her children were to be taken away to be raised in monasteries or trusted Christian households. The council further directed that all who had reverted to Judaism during the reign of Swintila had to return to Christianity. The trend toward intolerance continued with the ascent of Chintila (636–639). He directed the Sixth Council of Toledo to order that only Catholics could remain in the kingdom, and taking an unusual step further, Chintila excommunicated \"in advance\" any of his successors who did not act in accordance with his anti-Jewish edicts. Again, many converted while others chose exile.\n\nAnd yet the \"problem\" continued. The Eighth Council of Toledo in 653 again tackled the issue of Jews within the realm. Further measures at this time included the forbidding of all Jewish rites (including circumcision and the observation of the Shabbat), and all converted Jews had to promise to put to death, either by burning or by stoning, any of their brethren known to have relapsed to Judaism. The Council was aware that prior efforts had been frustrated by lack of compliance among authorities on the local level: therefore, anyone — including nobles and clergy — found to have aided Jews in the practice of Judaism were to be punished by seizure of one quarter of their property and excommunication.\n\nThese efforts again proved unsuccessful. The Jewish population remained sufficiently sizable as to prompt Wamba (672–680) to issue limited expulsion orders against them, and the reign of Erwig (680–687) also seemed vexed by the issue. The Twelfth Council of Toledo again called for forced baptism, and, for those who disobeyed, seizure of property, corporal punishment, exile, and slavery. Jewish children over seven years of age were taken from their parents and similarly dealt with in 694. Erwig also took measures to ensure that Catholic sympathizers would not be inclined to aid Jews in their efforts to subvert the Council's rulings. Heavy fines awaited any nobles who acted in favor of the Jews, and members of the clergy who were remiss in enforcement were subject to a number of punishments.\n\nEgica (687–702), recognizing the wrongness of forced baptism, relaxed the pressure on the \"conversos\", but kept it up on practicing Jews. Economic hardships included increased taxes and the forced sale, at a fixed price, of all property ever acquired from Christians. This effectively ended all agricultural activity for the Jews of Spain. Furthermore, Jews were not to engage in commerce with the Christians of the kingdom nor conduct business with Christians overseas. Egica's measures were upheld by the Sixteenth Council of Toledo in 693.\n\nAs demonstrated, under the Catholic Visigoths, the trend was clearly one of increasing persecutions. The degree of complicity which the Jews had in the Islamic invasion in 711 is uncertain. Yet, openly treated as enemies in the country in which they had resided for generations, it would be no surprise for them to have appealed to the Moors to the south, quite tolerant in comparison to the Visigoths, for aid. In any case, in 694 they were accused of conspiring with the Muslims across the Mediterranean. Declared traitors, the Jews, including baptized ones, found their property confiscated and themselves enslaved. This decree exempted only the converts who dwelt in the mountain passes of Septimania, who were necessary for the kingdom's protection.\n\nThe Jews of Spain had been utterly embittered and alienated by Catholic rule by the time of the Muslim invasion. To them, the Moors were perceived as, and indeed were, a liberating force. Wherever they went, the Muslims were greeted by Jews eager to aid them in administering the country. In many conquered towns the garrison was left in the hands of the Jews before the Muslims proceeded further north. Thus was initiated the period that became known as the \"Golden Age\" for Spanish Jews.\n\nThe Eastern Roman Empire sent its navy on numerous occasions at the end of the 7th and beginning of the 8th centuries to try and instill uprisings in the Jewish and Christian Roman populations in Spain and Gaul against Visigoth and Frankish rule, which was also aimed at halting the expansion of Muslim Arabs in the Roman world.\n\nIn 694, at the Council of Toledo, Jews were condemned to slavery by the Visigoths because of a plot to revolt against them encouraged by the Eastern Roman Empire and Romans still residing in Spain.\n\nWith the victory of Tariq ibn Ziyad in 711, the lives of the Sephardim changed dramatically. For the most part, the invasion of the Moors was welcomed by the Jews of Iberia.\n\nBoth Muslim and Catholic sources tell us that Jews provided valuable aid to the invaders. Once captured, the defense of Córdoba was left in the hands of Jews, and Granada, Málaga, Seville, and Toledo were left to a mixed army of Jews and Moors. The Chronicle of Lucas de Tuy records that when the Catholics left Toledo on Sunday before Easter to go to the Church of Saint Leocadia to listen to the divine sermon, the Jews acted treacherously and informed the Saracens. Then they closed the gates of the city before the Catholics and opened them for the Moors. Although, in contradiction to de Tuy's account, Rodrigo Jiménez de Rada's \"De rebus Hispaniae\" maintains that Toledo was \"almost of completely empty from its inhabitants\", not because of Jewish treachery, but because \"many had fled to Amiara, others to Asturias and some to the mountains\", following which the city was fortified by a militia of Arabs and Jews (3.24). Although in the cases of some towns, the behavior of the Jews may have been conducive to Muslim success, such was of limited impact overall. (Assis, pp. 44–45).\n\nIn spite of the restrictions placed upon the Jews as dhimmis, life under Muslim rule was one of great opportunity in comparison to that under prior Catholic Visigoths, as testified by the influx of Jews from abroad. To Jews throughout the Catholic and Muslim worlds, Iberia was seen as a land of relative tolerance and opportunity. Following initial Arab-Berber victories, and especially with the establishment of Umayyad dynasty rule by Abd al-Rahman I in 755, the native Jewish community was joined by Jews from the rest of Europe, as well as from Arab territories from Morocco to Mesopotamia (the latter region known as Babylonia in Jewish sources) (Assis, p. 12; Sarna, p. 324). Thus the Sephardim found themselves enriched culturally, intellectually, and religiously by the commingling of diverse Jewish traditions. Contacts with Middle Eastern communities were strengthened and it was during this time that the influence of the Babylonian academies of Sura and Pumbedita was at its greatest. As a result, until the mid-10th century, much of Sephardic scholarship focused on Halakha.\n\nAlthough not as influential, traditions of the Levant, known as Palestine, were also introduced, in an increased interest in Hebrew language and biblical studies (Sarna, pp. 325–326).\n\nArabic culture, of course, also made a lasting impact on Sephardic cultural development. General reevaluation of scripture was prompted by Muslim anti-Jewish polemics and the spread of rationalism, as well as the anti-Rabbanite polemics of Karaite Judaism.\n\nIn adopting Arabic, as had the Babylonian geonim, the heads of the Talmudic Academies in Babylonia, not only were the cultural and intellectual achievements of Arabic culture opened up to the educated Jew, but much of the scientific and philosophical speculation of Greek culture, which had been best preserved by Arab scholars, were as well. The meticulous regard which the Arabs had for grammar and style also had the effect of stimulating an interest among Jews in philological matters in general (Sarna, pp. 327–328). Arabic came to be the main language of Sephardic science, philosophy, and everyday business. From the second half of the 9th century, most Jewish prose, including many non-halakhic religious works, were in Arabic. The thorough adoption of Arabic greatly facilitated the assimilation of Jews into Arabic culture (Dan, p. 115; Halkin, pp. 324–325).\n\nAlthough initially the often bloody disputes among Muslim factions generally kept Jews out of the political sphere, the first approximately two centuries which preceded the \"Golden Age\" were marked by increased activity by Jews in a variety of professions, including medicine, commerce, finance, and agriculture (Raphael, p. 71).\n\nBy the ninth century, some members of the Sephardic community felt confident enough to take part in proselytizing amongst previously Jewish \"Catholics\". Most famous were the heated correspondences sent between Bodo the Frank, a former deacon who had converted to Judaism in 838, and the converso Bishop of Córdoba, Álvaro of Córdoba. Each man, using such epithets as \"wretched compiler\", tried to convince the other to return to his former religion, to no avail (Katz, pp. 40–41; Stillman, pp. 54–55).\n\nThe first period of exceptional prosperity took place under the reign of Abd ar-Rahman III (882–955), the first independent Caliph of Córdoba. The inauguration of the Golden Age is closely identified with the career of his Jewish councillor, Hasdai ibn Shaprut (882–942). Originally a court physician, Shaprut's official duties went on to include the supervision of customs and foreign trade. It was in his capacity as dignitary that he corresponded with the kingdom of the Khazars, who had converted to Judaism in the 8th century (Assis, pp. 13, 47).\n\nAbd al-Rahman III's support for Arabic scholasticism had made Iberia the center of Arabic philological research. It was within this context of cultural patronage that interest in Hebrew studies developed and flourished. With Hasdai as its leading patron, Córdoba became the \"Mecca of Jewish scholars who could be assured of a hospitable welcome from Jewish courtiers and men of means\" (Sarna, p. 327).\n\nIn addition to being a poet himself, Hasdai encouraged and supported the work of other Sephardic writers. Subjects covered the spectrum, encompassing religion, nature, music, and politics, as well as pleasure. Hasdai brought a number of men of letters to Córdoba, including Dunash ben Labrat, innovator of Hebrew metrical poetry and Menahem ben Saruq, compiler of the first Hebrew dictionary, which came into wide use among the Jews of Germany and France. Celebrated poets of this era include Solomon ibn Gabirol, Yehuda Halevi, Samuel Ha-Nagid ibn Nagrela, and Abraham and Moses ibn Ezra (Sassoon, p. 15; Stillman, p. 58).\n\nHasdai benefitted world Jewry not only indirectly by creating a favorable environment for scholarly pursuits within Iberia, but also by using his influence to intervene on behalf of foreign Jews, as is reflected in his letter to the Byzantine Princess Helena. In it he requested protection for the Jews under Byzantine rule, attesting to the fair treatment of the Christians of \"al-Andalus\", and indicating that such was contingent on the treatment of Jews abroad (Assis, p. 13; Mann, pp. 21–22).\n\nThe intellectual achievements of the Sephardim of \"al-Andalus\" influenced the lives of non-Jews as well. Most notable of literary contributions is Ibn Gabirol's neo-Platonic \"Fons Vitae\" (\"The Source of Life\"). Thought by many to have been written by a Christian, this work was admired by Christians and studied in monasteries throughout the Middle Ages (Raphael, p. 78). Some Arabic philosophers followed Jewish ones in their ideas (though this phenomenon was somewhat hindered in that, although in Arabic, Jewish philosophical works were usually written with Hebrew characters) (Dan, p. 116). Jews were also active in such fields as astronomy, medicine, logic, and mathematics. In addition to training the mind in logical yet abstract and subtle modes of thought, the study of the natural world, as the direct study of the work of the Creator, was ideally a way to better understand and become closer to God (Dan, pp. 7–8). \"Al-Andalus\" also became a major center of Jewish philosophy during Hasdai's time. Following in the tradition of the Talmud and the Midrash, many of the most notable Jewish philosophers were dedicated to the field of ethics (although this ethical Jewish rationalism rested on the notion that traditional approaches had not been successful in their treatments of the subject in that they were lacking in rational, scientific arguments) (Dan, p. 117).\n\nIn addition to contributions of original work, the Sephardim were active as translators. Greek texts were rendered into Arabic, Arabic into Hebrew, Hebrew and Arabic into Latin, and all combinations of vice versa. In translating the great works of Arabic, Hebrew, and Greek into Latin, Iberian Jews were instrumental in bringing the fields of science and philosophy, which formed much of the basis of Renaissance learning, into the rest of Europe.\n\nIn the early 11th century, centralized authority based at Córdoba broke down following the Berber invasion and the ousting of the Umayyads. In its stead arose the independent \"taifa\" principalities under the rule of local Arab, Berber, Slavic, or Muladi leaders. Rather than having a stifling effect, the disintegration of the caliphate expanded the opportunities to Jewish and other professionals. The services of Jewish scientists, doctors, traders, poets, and scholars were generally valued by the Christian as well as Muslim rulers of regional centers, especially as recently conquered towns were put back in order (Assis, pp. 13–14; Raphael, p. 75).\n\nAmong the most prominent of Jews to serve as viziers in the Muslim taifas were the ibn Nagrelas (or Naghrela). Samuel Ha-Nagid ibn Nagrela (993–1056) served Granada's King Habbus and his son Badis for thirty years. In addition to his roles as policy director and military leader (as one of only two Jews to command Muslim armies — the other being his son Joseph), Samuel ibn Nagrela was an accomplished poet, and his introduction to the Talmud is standard today. His son Joseph ibn Naghrela also acted as vizier. He was murdered in the 1066 Granada massacre. There were other Jewish viziers serving in Seville, Lucena, and Saragossa (Assis, p. 14).\n\nThe Granada massacre of 1066 was an Anti-Jewish Pogrom that took place in Granada in 1066 when a Muslim mob stormed the Royal Palace where Joseph had sought refuge, then crucified him. After that, the instigators attacked 1500 Jewish families, killing approximately 4,000 Granada Jews.\n\nThe Golden Age ended before the completion of the Christian \"Reconquista\". The Granada massacre was one of the earliest signs of a decline in the status of Jews, which resulted largely from the penetration and influence of increasingly zealous Islamic sects from North Africa.\n\nFollowing the fall of Toledo to Christians in 1085, the ruler of Seville sought relief from the Almoravides. This ascetic sect abhorred the liberality of the Islamic culture of \"al-Andalus\", including the position of authority that some \"dhimmis\" held over Muslims. In addition to battling the Christians, who were gaining ground, the Almoravides implemented numerous reforms to bring \"al-Andalus\" more in line with their notion of proper Islam. In spite of large-scale forcible conversions, Sephardic culture was not entirely decimated. Members of Lucena's Jewish community, for example, managed to bribe their way out of conversion. As the spirit of Andalusian Islam was absorbed by the Almoravides, policies concerning Jews were relaxed. The poet Moses ibn Ezra continued to write during this time, and several Jews served as diplomats and physicians to the Almoravides (Assis, p. 14; Gampel, p. 20).\n\nWars in North Africa with Muslim tribes eventually forced the Almoravides to withdraw their forces from Iberia. As the Christians advanced, Iberian Muslims again appealed to their brethren to the south, this time to those who had displaced the Almoravides in North Africa. The Almohads, who had taken control of much of Islamic Iberia by 1172, far surpassed the Almoravides in fundamentalist outlook, and they treated the \"dhimmis\" harshly. Jews and Christians were expelled from Morocco and Islamic Spain. Faced with the choice of either death or conversion, many Jews emigrated. Some, such as the family of Maimonides, fled south and east to the more tolerant Moslem lands, while others went northward to settle in the growing Christian kingdoms. (Assis, p. 16; Gampel; pp. 20–21; Stillman, pp. 51, 73.)\n\nMeanwhile, the \"Reconquista\" continued in the north. By the early 12th century, conditions for some Jews in the emerging Christian kingdoms became increasingly favorable. As had happened during the reconstruction of towns following the breakdown of authority under the Umayyads, the services of Jews were employed by the Christian leaders who were increasingly emerging victorious during the later \"Reconquista\". Their knowledge of the language and culture of the enemy, their skills as diplomats and professionals, as well as their desire for relief from intolerable conditions, rendered their services of great value to the Christians during the \"Reconquista\" — the very same reasons that they had proved useful to the Arabs in the early stages of the Moslem invasion. The necessity to have conquerors settle in reclaimed territories also outweighed the prejudices of anti-Semitism, at least while the Moslem threat was imminent. Thus, as conditions in Islamic Iberia worsened, immigration to Christian principalities increased (Assis, p. 17).\n\nThe Jews from the Muslim south were not entirely secure in their northward migrations, however. Old prejudices were compounded by newer ones. Suspicions of complicity with the Moslems were alive and well as Jews immigrated from Muslim territories, speaking the Muslim tongue. However, many of the newly arrived Jews of the north prospered during the late eleventh and early twelfth centuries. The majority of Latin documentation regarding Jews during this period refers to their landed property, fields, and vineyards (Ashtor, pp. 250–251).\n\nIn many ways life had come full circle for the Sephardim of \"al-Andalus\". As conditions became more oppressive in the areas under Muslim rule during the 12th and 13th centuries, Jews again looked to an outside culture for relief. Christian leaders of reconquered cities granted them extensive autonomy, and Jewish scholarship recovered and developed as communities grew in size and importance (Assis, p. 18). However, the Reconquista Jews never reached the same heights as had those of the Golden Age.\n\nCatholic princes, the counts of Castile and the first kings of Leon, treated the Jews as mercilessly as did the Almohades. In their operations against the Moors they did not spare the Jews, destroying their synagogues and killing their teachers and scholars. Only gradually did the rulers come to realize that, surrounded as they were by powerful enemies, they could not afford to turn the Jews against them. Garcia Fernandez, Count of Castile, in the fuero of Castrojeriz (974), placed the Jews in many respects on an equality with Catholics; and similar measures were adopted by the Council of Leon (1020), presided over by Alfonso V. In Leon, the metropolis of Catholic Spain until the conquest of Toledo, many Jews owned real estate, and engaged in agriculture and viticulture as well as in the handicrafts; and here, as in other towns, they lived on friendly terms with the Catholic population. The Council of Coyanza (1050) therefore found it necessary to revive the old-Visigothic law forbidding, under pain of punishment by the Church, Jews and Catholics to live together in the same house, or to eat together.\n\nFerdinand I of Castile set aside a part of the Jewish taxes for the use of the Church, and even the not very religious-minded Alfonso VI gave to the church of Leon the taxes paid by the Jews of Castro. Alfonso VI, the conqueror of Toledo (1085), was tolerant and benevolent in his attitude toward the Jews, for which he won the praise of Pope Alexander II. To estrange the wealthy and industrious Jews from the Moors he offered the former various privileges. In the fuero of Najara Sepulveda, issued and confirmed by him (1076), he not only granted the Jews full equality with the Catholics, but he even accorded them the rights enjoyed by the nobility. To show their gratitude to the king for the rights granted them, the Jews willingly placed themselves at his and the country's service. Alfonso's army contained 40,000 Jews, who were distinguished from the other combatants by their black-and-yellow turbans; for the sake of this Jewish contingent the Battle of Sagrajas was not begun until after the Sabbath had passed. The king's favoritism toward the Jews, which became so pronounced that Pope Gregory VII warned him not to permit Jews to rule over Catholics, roused the hatred and envy of the latter. After the unfortunate Battle of Uclés, at which the Infante Sancho, together with 30,000 men were killed, an anti-Jewish riot broke out in Toledo; many Jews were slain, and their houses and synagogues were burned (1108). Alfonso intended to punish the murderers and incendiaries, but died before he could carry out his intention (June, 1109). After his death the inhabitants of Carrion fell upon the Jews; many were slain, others were imprisoned, and their houses were pillaged.\nAlfonso VII, who assumed the title of Emperor of Leon, Toledo, and Santiago, curtailed in the beginning of his reign the rights and liberties which his father had granted the Jews. He ordered that neither a Jew nor a convert might exercise legal authority over Catholics, and he held the Jews responsible for the collection of the royal taxes. Soon, however, he became more friendly, confirming the Jews in all their former privileges and even granting them additional ones, by which they were placed on an equality with Catholics. Considerable influence with the king was enjoyed by Judah ben Joseph ibn Ezra (Nasi). After the conquest of Calatrava (1147) the king placed Judah in command of the fortress, later making him his court chamberlain. Judah ben Joseph stood in such favor with the king that the latter, at his request, not only admitted into Toledo the Jews who had fled from the persecutions of the Almohades, but even assigned many fugitives dwellings in Flascala (near Toledo), Fromista, Carrion, Palencia, and other places, where new congregations were soon established.\n\nAfter the brief reign of King Sancho III, a war broke out between Fernando II of Leon (who granted the Jews special privileges) and the united kings of Aragon and Navarre. Jews fought in both armies, and after the declaration of peace they were placed in charge of the fortresses. Alfonso VIII of Castile (1166–1214), who had succeeded to the throne, entrusted the Jews with guarding Or, Celorigo, and, later, Mayorga, while Sancho the Wise of Navarre placed them in charge of Estella, Funes, and Murañon. During the reign of Alfonso VIII the Jews gained still greater influence, aided, doubtless, by the king's love of the beautiful Rachel (Fermosa) of Toledo, who was Jewish. When the king was defeated at the battle of Alarcos by the Almohades under Yusuf Abu Ya'kub al-Mansur, the defeat was attributed to the king's love-affair with Fermosa, and she and her relatives were murdered in Toledo by the nobility. After the victory at Alarcos the emir Mohammed al-Nasir ravaged Castile with a powerful army and threatened to overrun the whole of Catholic Spain. The Archbishop of Toledo called to crusade to aid Alfonso. In this war against the Moors the king was greatly aided by the wealthy Jews of Toledo, especially by his \"almoxarife mayor\", the learned and generous Nasi Joseph ben Solomon ibn Shoshan (Al-Hajib ibn Amar).\n\nThe Crusaders were hailed with joy in Toledo, but this joy was soon changed to sorrow, as far as the Jews were concerned. The Crusaders began the \"holy war\" in Toledo (1212) by robbing and killing the Jews, and if the knights had not checked them with armed forces all the Jews in Toledo would have been slain. When, after the sanguinary battle of Las Navas de Tolosa (1212), Alfonso victoriously entered Toledo, the Jews went to meet him in triumphal procession. Shortly before his death (Oct., 1214) the king issued the \"fuero de Cuenca\", settling the legal position of the Jews in a manner favorable to them.\n\nA turning-point in the history of the Jews of Spain was reached under Ferdinand III (who united permanently the kingdoms of Leon and Castile), and under James I, the contemporary ruler of Aragon. The clergy's endeavors directed against the Jews became more and more pronounced. The Spanish Jews of both sexes, like the Jews of France, were compelled to distinguish themselves from Catholics by wearing a yellow badge on their clothing; this order was issued to keep them from associating with Catholics, although the reason given was that it was ordered for their own safety.\n\nThe papal bull issued by Pope Innocent IV in April 1250, to the effect that Jews might not build a new synagogue without special permission, also made it illegal for Jews to proselytize, under pain of death and confiscation of property. They might not associate with the Catholics, live under the same roof with them, eat and drink with them, or use the same bath; neither might a Catholic partake of wine which had been prepared by a Jew. The Jews might not employ Catholic nurses or servants, and Catholics might use only medicinal remedies which had been prepared by competent Catholic apothecaries. Every Jew should wear the badge, though the king reserved to himself the right to exempt any one from this obligation; any Jew apprehended without the badge was liable to a fine of ten gold maravedís or to the infliction of ten stripes. The Jews were forbidden to appear in public on Good Friday.\n\nThe Jews in Spain were citizens of the kingdoms in which they resided (Castile, Aragón, and Valencia were the most important), both as regards their customs and their language. They owned real estate, and they cultivated their land with their own hands; they filled public offices, and on account of their industry they became wealthy while their knowledge and ability won them respect and influence. But this prosperity roused the jealousy of the people and provoked the hatred of the clergy; the Jews had to suffer much through these causes. The kings, especially those of Aragon, regarded the Jews as their property; they spoke of \"their\" Jews, \"their\" \"juderías\" (Jewish neighborhoods), and in their own interest they protected the Jews against violence, making good use of them in every way possible. The Jews were vassals of the king, the same as Christian commoners.\n\nThere were about 120 Jewish communities in Catholic Spain around 1300, with somewhere around half a million or more Jews, mostly in Castille. Catalonia, Aragón, and Valencia were more sparsely inhabited by Jews.\n\nEven though the Spanish Jews engaged in many branches of human endeavor—agriculture, viticulture, industry, commerce, and the various handicrafts—it was the money business that procured to some of them their wealth and influence. Kings and prelates, noblemen and farmers, all needed money and could obtain it only from the Jews, to whom they paid from 20 to 25 per cent interest. This business, which, in a manner, the Jews were forced to pursue in order to pay the many taxes imposed upon them as well as to raise the compulsory loans demanded of them by the kings, led to their being employed in special positions, as \"almonries\", bailiffs, tax collectors.\n\nThe Jews of Spain formed in themselves a separate political body. They lived almost solely in the Juderias, various enactments being issued from time to time preventing them from living elsewhere. From the time of the Moors they had had their own administration. At the head of the aljamas in Castile stood the \"rab de la corte\", or \"rab mayor\" (court, or chief, rabbi), also called \"juez mayor\" (chief justice), who was the principal mediator between the state and the aljamas. These court rabbis were men who had rendered services to the state, as, for example, David ibn Yah.ya and Abraham Benveniste, or who had been royal physicians, as Meïr Alguadez and Jacob ibn Nuñez, or chief-tax-farmers, as the last incumbent of the court rabbi's office, Abraham Senior. They were appointed by the kings, no regard being paid to the rabbinical qualifications or religious inclination of those chosen\n\nIn the beginning of the fourteenth century the position of Jews became precarious throughout Spain as antisemitism increased. Many Jews emigrated from Castile and from Aragon. It was not until the reigns of Alfonso IV and Peter IV of Aragon, and of the young and active Alfonso XI of Castile (1325), that an improvement set in. In 1328, 5,000 Jews were killed in Navarre following the preaching of a mendicant friar.\n\nPeter of Castile, the son and successor of Alfonso XI, was relatively favorably disposed toward the Jews, who under him reached the zenith of their influence - often exemplified by the success of his treasurer, Samuel ha-Levi. For this reason the king was called \"the heretic\" and often \"the cruel\". Peter, whose education had been neglected, was not quite sixteen years of age when he ascended the throne (1350). From the commencement of his reign he so surrounded himself with Jews that his enemies in derision spoke of his court as \"a Jewish court\".\n\nSoon, however a civil war erupted, as Henry II of Castile and his brother, at the head of a mob, invaded on 7 May 1355 that part of the Judería of Toledo called the \"Alcaná\"; they plundered the warehouses and murdered about 1200 Jews, without distinction of age or sex. The mob did not, however, succeed in overrunning the Judería of Toledo proper, which was defended by the Jews and by knights loyal to the King.\n\nThe more friendly Peter showed himself toward the Jews, and the more he protected them, the more antagonistic became the attitude of his illegitimate half-brother, who, when he invaded Castile in 1360, murdered all the Jews living in Nájera and exposed those of Miranda de Ebro to robbery and death.\n\nIn the Cortes of Soria (1380) it was enacted that rabbis, or heads of aljamas, should be forbidden, under penalty of a fine of 6000 maravedís, to inflict upon Jews the penalties of death, mutilation, expulsion, or excommunication; but in civil proceedings they were still permitted to choose their own judges. In consequence of an accusation that the Jewish prayers contained clauses cursing the Catholics, the king ordered that within two months, on pain of a fine of 3000 maravedís, they should remove from their prayer-books the objectionable passages. Whoever caused the conversion to Judaism of a Moor or of any one confessing another faith, or performed the rite of circumcision upon him, became a slave and the property of the treasury. The Jews no longer dared show themselves in public without the badge, and in consequence of the ever-growing hatred toward them they were no longer sure of life or limb; they were attacked and robbed and murdered in the public streets, and at length the king found it necessary to impose a fine of 6,000 maravedís on any town in which a Jew was found murdered. Against his desire, John was obliged (1385) to issue an order prohibiting the employment of Jews as financial agents or tax-farmers to the king, queen, infantes, or grandees. To this was added the resolution adopted by the Council of Palencia ordering the complete separation of Jews and Catholics and the prevention of any association between them.\n\n\"The execution of Joseph Pichon and the inflammatory speeches and sermons delivered in Seville by Archdeacon Ferrand Martínez, the pious Queen Leonora's confessor, soon raised the hatred of the populace to the highest pitch. The feeble King John I, in spite of the endeavors of his physician Moses ibn Ẓarẓal to prolong his life, died at Alcalá de Henares on October 9, 1390, and was succeeded by his eleven-year-old son. The council-regent appointed by the king in his testament, consisting of prelates, grandees, and six citizens from Burgos, Toledo, León, Seville, Córdoba, and Murcia, was powerless; every vestige of respect for law and justice had disappeared. Ferrand Martínez, although deprived of his office, continued, in spite of numerous warnings, to incite the public against the Jews, and encourage it to acts of violence. As early as January, 1391, the prominent Jews who were assembled in Madrid received information that riots were threatening in Seville and Córdoba.\n\nA revolt broke out in Seville in 1391. Juan Alfonso de Guzmán, Count of Niebla and governor of the city, and his relative, the \"alguazil mayor\" Alvar Pérez de Guzmán, had ordered, on Ash Wednesday, March 15, the arrest and public whipping of two of the mob-leaders. The fanatical mob, still further exasperated thereby, murdered and robbed several Jews and threatened the Guzmáns with death. In vain did the regency issue prompt orders; Ferrand Martínez continued unhindered his inflammatory appeals to the rabble to kill the Jews or baptize them. On June 6 the mob attacked the Judería of Seville from all sides and killed 4000 Jews; the rest submitted to baptism as the only means of escaping death.\"\n\n\"At this time Seville is said to have contained 7000 Jewish families. Of the three large synagogues existing in the city two were transformed into churches. In all the towns throughout the archbishopric, as in Alcalá de Guadeira, Écija, Cazalla, and in Fregenal de la Sierra, the Jews were robbed and slain. In Córdoba this butchery was repeated in a horrible manner; the entire Judería of Cordoba was burned down; factories and warehouses were destroyed by the flames. Before the authorities could come to the aid of the defenseless people, every one of them — children, young women, old men — had been ruthlessly slain; 2000 corpses lay in heaps in the streets, in the houses, and in the wrecked synagogues.\"\n\n\"The last town visited was Lérida (August 13). The Jews of this city vainly sought protection in the Alcázar; 75 were slain, and the rest were baptized; the latter transformed their synagogue into a church, in which they worshiped as Marranos.\"\n\nSeveral responses bearing on the widespread persecution of Iberian Jewry between the years 1390 and 1391 can be found in contemporary Jewish sources, such as in the \"Responsa\" of Isaac ben Sheshet (1326 – 1408), and in the seminal writing of Gedaliah ibn Yahya ben Joseph, \"Shalshelet haQabbalah\" (written ca. 1586), as also in Abraham Zacuto’s \"Sefer Yuḥasin\", in Solomon ibn Verga’s \"Shevaṭ Yehudah\", as well as in a Letter written to the Jews of Avignon by Don Hasdai Crescas in the winter of 1391 concerning the events in Spain in the year 1391.\n\nAccording to Don Hasdai Crescas, persecution against Jews began in earnest in Seville in 1391, on the 1st day of the lunar month Tammuz (June). From there the violence spread to Córdoba, and by the 17th day of the same lunar month, it had reached Toledo (called then by Jews after its Arabic name, \"Ṭulayṭulah\") in the region of Old Castile. From there, the violence had spread to Mallorca and by the 1st day of the lunar month Elul it had also reached the Jews of Barcelona in Catalonia, where the slain were estimated at two-hundred and fifty. So, too, many Jews who resided in the neighboring provinces of Lérida and Gironda and in the kingdom of València had been affected, as were also the Jews of al-Andalus, whereas many died a martyr's death, while others converted in order to save themselves.\n\nMany of the Jews from Valencia, Catalonia and Aragon thronged to North Africa, particularly Algiers.\n\nAt the Catholic preacher Ferrer's request a law consisting of twenty-four clauses, which had been drawn up by Paul of Burgos, né Solomon haLevi, was issued in January 1412 in the name of the child-king John II of Castile.\n\nThe object of this law was to reduce the Jews to poverty and to further humiliate them. They were ordered to live by themselves, in enclosed Juderías, and they were to repair, within eight days after the publication of the order, to the quarters assigned them under penalty of loss of property. They were prohibited from practising medicine, surgery, or chemistry (pharmacy) and from dealing in bread, wine, flour, meat, etc. They might not engage in handicrafts or trades of any kind, nor might they fill public offices, or act as money-brokers or agents. They were not allowed to hire Catholic servants, farmhands, lamplighters, or gravediggers; nor might they eat, drink, or bathe with Catholics, or hold intimate conversation (have sexual relations) with them, or visit them, or give them presents. Catholic women, married or unmarried, were forbidden to enter the Judería either by day or by night. The Jews were allowed no self-jurisdiction whatever, nor might they, without royal permission, levy taxes for communal purposes; they might not assume the title of \"Don\", carry arms, or trim beard or hair. Jewish women were required to wear plain, long mantles of coarse material reaching to the feet; and it was strictly forbidden for Jews to wear garments made of better material. On pain of loss of property and even of slavery, they were forbidden to leave the country, and any grandee or knight who protected or sheltered a fugitive Jew was punished with a fine of 150,000 maravedís for the first offense. These laws, which were rigidly enforced, any violation of them being punished with a fine of 300–2,000 maravedís and flagellation, were calculated to compel the Jews to embrace Catholicism.\nThe persecution of the Jews was now pursued systematically. In the hope of mass-conversions, Benedict issued, on May 11, 1415, a bull consisting of twelve articles, which, in the main, corresponded with the decree (\"Pragmática\") issued by Catalina, and which had been placed on the statutes of Aragon by Fernando. By this bull Jews and neophytes were forbidden to study the Talmud, to read anti-Catholic writings, in particular the work \"Macellum\" (\"Mar Jesu\"), to pronounce the names of Jesus, Maria, or the saints, to manufacture communion-cups or other church vessels or accept such as pledges, or to build new synagogues or ornament old ones. Each community might have only one synagogue. Jews were denied all rights of self-jurisdiction, nor might they proceed against \"malsines\" (accusers). They might hold no public offices, nor might they follow any handicrafts, or act as brokers, matrimonial agents, physicians, apothecaries, or druggists. They were forbidden to bake or sell matzot, or to give them away; neither might they dispose of meat which they were prohibited from eating. They might have no intercourse (sex) with Catholics, nor might they disinherit their baptized children. They should wear the badge at all times, and thrice a year all Jews over twelve, of both sexes, were required to listen to a Catholic sermon. (the bull is reprinted, from a manuscript in the archives of the cathedral in Toledo, by Rios [\"Hist.\" ii. 627–653]).\n\nAs soon as the Catholic monarchs Ferdinand and Isabella ascended their respective thrones, steps were taken to segregate the Jews both from the conversos and from their fellow countrymen. At the Cortes of Toledo, in 1480, all Jews were ordered to be separated in special barrios, and at the Cortes of Fraga, two years later, the same law was enforced in Navarre, where they were ordered to be confined to the Juderías at night. The same year saw the establishment of the Spanish Inquisition, the main object of which was to deal with the conversos. Though both monarchs were surrounded by Neo-Catholics, such as Pedro de Caballería and Luis de Santángel, and though Ferdinand was the grandson of a Jew, he showed the greatest intolerance to Jews, whether converted or otherwise, commanding all \"conversos\" to reconcile themselves with the Inquisition by the end of 1484, and obtaining a bull from Pope Innocent VIII ordering all Catholic princes to restore all fugitive conversos to the Inquisition of Spain. One of the reasons for the increased rigor of the Catholic monarchs was the disappearance of the fear of any united action by Jews and Moors, the kingdom of Granada being at its last gasp. The rulers did, however, promise the Jews of the Moorish kingdom that they could continue to enjoy their existing rights in exchange for aiding the Spaniards in overthrowing the Moors. This promise dated February 11, 1490, was repudiated, however, by the decree of expulsion. See the Catholic Monarchs of Spain.\n\nA small number of pre-expulsion synagogues survive, including the Synagogue of Santa María la Blanca and the Synagogue of El Tránsito in Toledo, the Córdoba Synagogue, the Híjar Synagogue, the Old main synagogue, Segovia and the Synagogue of Tomar.\n\nSeveral months after the fall of Granada, an edict of expulsion called the Alhambra Decree was issued against the Jews of Spain by Ferdinand and Isabella on 31 March 1492. It ordered all Jews of whatever age to leave the kingdom by the last day of July: one day before Tisha B'Av). They were permitted to take their property provided it was not in gold, silver, or money.\n\nThe reason alleged for this action in the preamble of the edict was the relapse of so many conversos owing to the proximity of unconverted Jews, who seduced them from Christianity and kept alive in them the knowledge and practices of Judaism.\n\nIt is claimed that Isaac Abarbanel, who had previously ransomed 480 Jews of Málaga from the Catholic Monarchs by a payment of 20,000 doubloons, now offered them 600,000 crowns for the revocation of the edict. It is said also that Ferdinand hesitated, but was prevented from accepting the offer by Tomás de Torquemada, the grand inquisitor, who dashed into the royal presence and, throwing a crucifix down before the king and queen (a type of action a good Christian should have never done), asked whether, like Judas, they would betray their Lord for money. Torquemada was reputedly of converso ancestry, and the confessor of Isabella, Espina, being previously a Rabin. Whatever the truth of this story, there were no signs of relaxation shown by the court, and the Jews of Spain made preparations for exile. In some cases, as at Vitoria, they took steps to prevent the desecration of the graves of their kindred by presenting the cemetery, called the \"Judumendi\", to the municipality — a precaution not unjustified, as the Jewish cemetery of Seville was later ravaged by the people. The members of the Jewish community of Segovia passed the last three days of their stay in the city in the Jewish cemetery, fasting and wailing over being parted from their beloved dead.\n\nThe number of Jews exiled from Spain is subject to controversy, with highly exaggerated figures provided by early observers and historians offering figures which numbered the hundreds of thousands. By the time of the expulsion, little more than 100,000 practicing Jews remained in Spain, the majority having already converted to Catholicism. This in addition to the indeterminate number who managed to return has led to recent academic investigations such as those of Joseph Pérez and Julio Valdeón to offer figures of somewhere between 50,000 and 80,000 practicing Jews expelled from Spanish territory.\n\nJewish expulsion is a well established trend in European history. From the 13th to the 16th century, at least 15 European countries expelled their Jewish populations. The expulsion of the Jews from Spain was preceded by expulsions from England, France and Germany, among many others, and succeeded by at least five more expulsions.\n\nHenceforth the history of the Jews in Spain is that of the conversos, whose numbers, as has been shown, had been increased by no less than 50,000 during the period of the expulsion to a possible total of 300,000. For three centuries after the expulsion, Spanish Conversos were subject to suspicion by the Spanish Inquisition which executed over 3000 people in the 1570-1700 period on charges of heresy (including Judaism among others). They were also subject to more general discriminatory laws known as \"limpieza de sangre\" which required Spaniards to prove their \"old Christian\" background in order to access certain positions of authority. During this period hundreds of conversos escaped to nearby countries such as England, France and the Netherlands, or converted back to Judaism, thus becoming part of the communities of Western Sephardim or Spanish and Portuguese Jews.\n\nConversos played an important leadership role in the Revolt of the Comuneros (1520-1522), a popular revolt and Civil War centered in the region of Castile against the imperial pretensions of the Spanish monarchy.\n\nSmall numbers of Jews started to arrive in Spain in the 19th century, and synagogues were opened in Madrid.\n\nThe Jews of Morocco, where the initial welcome had turned to oppression as centuries passed by, had welcomed the Spanish troops establishing the Spanish protectorate in Morocco as their liberators, General Franco had interviews with some Sefardim, and spoke good about them.\n\nSpanish historians started to take an interest in the Sephardim and Judaeo-Spanish, their language. Spain's rediscovery of the Jews of Northern Morocco who still conserved this language and old Spanish customs was instrumental in ending antisemitism among its ruling classes.\n\nThe government of Miguel Primo de Rivera (1923–1930) decreed the right to Spanish citizenship to a certain number of Sephardim on December 24, 1920. The condition was that they had enjoyed Spanish protection before while living in the Ottoman Empire and that they applied before December 31, 1930. A similar measure was undertaken by the French government regarding non-Muslims in the Levant who had been protected by France before. The decree especially addressed Jews from Thessaloniki who had refused to take either Greek or Turkish citizenship. The decree was later used by some Spanish diplomats for saving Sephardi Jews from persecution and death during the Holocaust which created a kind of legend around the philosemitism of Spain's first military dictator who is said to have given access to Spanish citizenship to all Sephardim.\n\nDuring the Spanish Civil War (1936–1939), synagogues were closed and post-war worship was kept in private homes. Jewish public life resumed in 1947 with the arrival of Jews from Europe and North Africa.\n\nIn the first years of the World War II, \"Laws regulating their admittance were written and mostly ignored.\" They were mainly from Western Europe, fleeing deportation to concentration camps from occupied France, but also Jews from Eastern Europe, especially Hungary. Trudi Alexy refers to the \"absurdity\" and \"paradox of refugees fleeing the Nazis' Final Solution to seek asylum in a country where no Jews had been allowed to live openly as Jews for over four centuries.\" \n\nThroughout World War II, Spanish diplomats of the Franco government extended their protection to Eastern European Jews, especially in Hungary. Jews claiming Spanish ancestry were provided with Spanish documentation without being required to prove their case and either left for Spain or survived the war with the help of their new legal status in occupied countries.\n\nOnce the tide of war began to turn, and Count Francisco Gómez-Jordana Sousa succeeded Franco's brother-in-law Ramón Serrano Suñer as Spain's foreign minister, Spanish diplomacy became \"more sympathetic to Jews\", although Franco himself \"never said anything\" about this. Around that same time, a contingent of Spanish doctors travelling in Occupied Poland were fully informed of the Nazi extermination plans by Governor-General Hans Frank, who was under the impression that they would share his views about the matter; when they came home, they passed the story to Admiral Luís Carrero Blanco, who told Franco.\n\nDiplomats discussed the possibility of Spain as a route to a containment camp for Jewish refugees near Casablanca but it came to naught due to lack of Free French and British support. Nonetheless, control of the Spanish border with France relaxed somewhat at this time, and thousands of Jews managed to cross into Spain (many by smugglers' routes). Almost all of them survived the war. The American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee operated openly in Barcelona.\n\nShortly afterwards, Spain began giving citizenship to Sephardi Jews in Greece, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Romania; many Ashkenazi Jews also managed to be included, as did some non-Jews. The Spanish head of mission in Budapest, Ángel Sanz Briz, saved thousands of Ashkenazim in Hungary by granting them Spanish citizenship, placing them in safe houses and teaching them minimal Spanish so they could pretend to be Sephardim, at least to someone who did not know Spanish. The Spanish diplomatic corps was performing a balancing act: Alexy conjectures that the number of Jews they took in was limited by how much German hostility they were willing to engender.\n\nToward the war's end, Sanz Briz had to flee Budapest, leaving these Jews open to arrest and deportation. An Italian diplomat, Giorgio Perlasca, who was himself living under Spanish protection, used forged documents to persuade the Hungarian authorities that he was the new Spanish Ambassador. As such, he continued Spanish protection of Hungarian Jews until the Red Army arrived.\n\nAlthough Spain effectively undertook more to help Jews escape deportation to the concentration camps than most neutral countries did, there has been debate about Spain's wartime attitude towards refugees. Franco's regime, despite its aversion to Zionism and \"Judeo-Marxist\"-Freemasonry conspiracy, does not appear to have shared the rabid anti-Semitic ideology promoted by the Nazis. About 25,000 to 35,000 refugees, mainly Jews, were allowed to transit through Spain to Portugal and beyond.\n\nSome historians argue that these facts demonstrate a humane attitude by Franco's regime, while others point out that the regime only permitted Jewish transit through Spain. After the war, Franco's regime was quite hospitable to those who had been responsible for the deportation of the Jews, notably Louis Darquier de Pellepoix, Commissioner for Jewish Affairs (May 1942 – February 1944) in Vichy France, and to many other former Nazis, such as Otto Skorzeny and Léon Degrelle, and other former Fascists.\n\nJosé María Finat y Escrivá de Romaní, Franco's chief of security, issued an official order dated May 13, 1941 to all provincial governors requesting a list of all Jews, both local and foreign, present in their districts. After the list of six thousand names was compiled, Romani was appointed Spain's ambassador to Germany, enabling him to deliver it personally to Heinrich Himmler. Following the defeat of Germany in 1945, the Spanish government attempted to destroy all evidence of cooperation with the Nazis, but this official order survived.\n\nAt around the same time, synagogues were opened and the communities could hold a discreet degree of activity.\n\nOn December 29, 1948, the official state bulletin (BOE) published a list of Sefardím family surnames from Greece and Egypt to which a special protection should be granted.\n\nThe Alhambra Decree that had expelled the Jews was formally rescinded on December 16, 1968.\n\nThe later Israeli ambassador Shlomo Ben-Ami still remembers the Spanish Legion escorting his family out of Tangiers, Morocco, towards Israeli ships anchored in Ceuta. During the Spanish transition to democracy, the recognition of Israel was one of the issues of modernization.\n\nThe Union of the Democratic Centre governments were divided. They did not want to risk the Arab friendship and subjected the establishment to the beginning of a durable solution of the Israeli-Arab conflict. After years of negotiations, the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party government of Felipe González established relations with Israel in 1986, denying links between relations and the admission of Spain into the European Economic Community. Spain tries to serve as a bridge between Israel and the Arabs as seen in the Madrid Conference of 1991.\n\nBetween 1948, the year Israel was created, and 2010, 1747 Spanish Jews made aliyah to Israel.\n\nThere are currently around 50,000 Spanish Jews, with the largest communities in Barcelona and Madrid each with around 3,500 members. There are smaller communities in Alicante, Málaga, Tenerife, Granada, Valencia, Benidorm, Cadiz, Murcia and many more.\n\nBarcelona, with a Jewish community of 3,500, has the largest concentration of Jews in Spain. Melilla maintains an old community of Sephardic Jews. The city of Murcia in the southeast of the country has a growing Jewish community and a local synagogue. Kosher olives are produced in this region and exported to Jews around the world. Also there is a new Jewish school in Murcia as a result of the growth in Jewish population immigrating to the Murcia community PolarisWorld.\n\nThe modern Jewish community in Spain consists mainly of Sephardim from Northern Africa, especially the former Spanish colonies. In the 1970s, there was also an influx of Argentine Jews, mainly Ashkenazim, escaping from the military Junta. With the birth of the European community, Jews from other countries in Europe are moving to Spain because of its weather, lifestyle as well as for its cost of living relative to the north of Europe. Some Jews see Spain as an easier life for retirees and for young people. Mazarron has seen its Jewish community grow as well as La Manga, Cartagena and Alicante.\n\nMoreover, Reform and liberal communities have arisen in cities like Barcelona or Oviedo during the last decade.\n\nSome famous Spaniards of Jewish descent are the businesswomen Alicia and Esther Koplowitz, the politician Enrique Múgica Herzog, and Isak Andic, founder of the clothing design and manufacturing company Mango, though only the latter is of Sephardic origin.\n\nThere are rare cases of Jewish converts, like the writer Jon Juaristi. Today there is an interest by some Jewish groups working in Spain to encourage the descendants of the Marranos to return to Judaism. This has resulted in a limited number of conversions to the Jewish faith.\n\nLike other religious communities in Spain, the Federation of Jewish Communities in Spain (FCJE) has established agreements with the Spanish government,<ref name=\"25/1992\">\"Ley 25/1992, de 10 de noviembre, por la que se aprueba el acuerdo de cooperación del Estado con la Federación de Comunidades Israelistas de España.</ref> regulating the status of Jewish clergy, places of worship, teaching, marriages, holidays, tax benefits, and heritage conservation.\n\nIn 2014 it was announced that the descendants of Sephardic Jews who were expelled from Spain by the Alhambra Decree of 1492 would be offered Spanish citizenship, without being required to move to Spain and/or renounce any other citizenship they may have. In 2014, residents of a village in Spain called Castrillo Matajudios voted to change the name of their town due to risk of confusion resulting from the etymology of the name. \"Mata\" is a common suffix of placenames in Spain, meaning \"forested patch\". In this case, it is likely to be a corruption of \"mota\" meaning \"hill\". Confusion arises from the word \"mata\" also meaning \"kill\", thus rendering a name which could be interpreted as \"kill the jews\". The name was changed back to its earlier name which would be less subject to surprise by newcomers Castrillo Mota de Judíos (Castrillo Hill of the Jews). Although a mere anecdote in Spain, where it barely made the national press, this story was widely covered in the English speaking press of the United States, United Kingdom and Israel, often misrepresenting the name of the village as \"Camp Kill the Jews\".\n\nIn 2014 it was announced that the descendants of Sephardic Jews who were expelled from Spain by the Alhambra Decree of 1492 would be offered Spanish citizenship, without being required to move to Spain and/or renounce any other citizenship they may have.\n\n\n\n"}

The ship's design was changed slightly, and the wave cannon was given a new charge level. Two new types of weapons (the Search Laser and Shotgun Laser) were added, bringing the total number of weapon types up to five. A new anti-ground unit bomb was added to the missile inventory.\n\nThough the number of levels was decreased from the previous game, the number of enemies, their durability, and the number of bullets they shoot were greatly increased. Enemy movements and terrain were also made trickier, bringing the game's difficulty up considerably. The same revival system is used as in \"R-Type\", where the player is brought back to a checkpoint whenever their ship is destroyed.\n\nThe game consists of six levels. Though an ending screen is displayed after the player finishes all of the levels once through, the game's true ending is only displayed after the player completes the levels a second time under increased difficulty. The game starts off in a ruined Bydo base, and continues through a giant cave where waterfalls can prevent the ship from progressing. The player battles several huge battleships in the third level, and the terrain constantly shifts around during the fourth and fifth levels. The final level takes place on the Bydo home planet, where the alien organisms are cloned and mass-produced.\n\n\"Super R-Type\", released in 1991 for the Super Famicom, is a semi-port of \"R-Type II\". The game was released for the Wii Virtual Console on January 29, 2008. About half of the levels in \"Super R-Type\" were newly-created, but some are arranged versions of the levels in \"R-Type II\".\n\n\"R-Type II\" for the Amiga is a downgraded though faithful conversion of the original arcade game. It was positively received by magazine critics of the time garnering praise for its accuracy. It was converted by Arc Developments and the graphics were hand-created pixel-by-pixel by in-house graphic artist Jon Harrison. It is missing all the new weapons though (search laser, shotgun laser, scatter bomb) and the helper bits have no firing capability. The same goes for the Atari ST version which misses much gfx and any parallax, but the gameplay and level design remain as faithful to the original as the Amiga version.\n\nThe game was also ported to the Game Boy, but the limitations of the hardware caused the content to be changed around considerably. The Game Boy version contains only 5 levels, and some of the boss names were changed as well.\n\nThe game is coupled with its forerunner in \"R-Types\", which was released for the PlayStation in 1998. This was followed by downloadable releases for the PlayStation Portable and PlayStation 3 over the PlayStation Network. \"R-Types\" includes a new opening and ending movie animation, along with \"R's Library\", which documents some of the game's design settings. A promotional movie for \"R-Type Delta\" is included in this release.\n\nTozai Games ported \"R-Type II\", along with the original \"R-Type\", to the Xbox 360's downloadable service Xbox Live Arcade as \"R-Type Dimensions\" in 2009.

Brentwood is located on Vancouver Island in Mill Bay, British Columbia, Canada.\n\nBrentwood was first founded in 1923. The original location was in Brentwood Bay near Saanich on Vancouver Island, from where its name was derived. The original school was destroyed by a fire in 1947, leaving only the chapel intact. The current school is located westward directly across the bay from the original site, in Mill Bay. The new version of the school opened in September 1961. In 1972, Brentwood College became the first all-boys boarding school in Canada to gradually integrate girls, starting with 20 grade 12 students, becoming officially co-ed for the fall session.\n\nBrentwood's 77-acre oceanfront campus has a dozen tennis courts, four rugby fields, eight student residences, two academic buildings, a rowing boathouse, laundry facilities, a cafeteria, a sportsplex, and a health centre while stretching across two kilometres of ocean shores.\n\nBrentwood's sustainable building use a geothermal loop for heating and cooling as part of the school's commitment to sustainable energy.\n\nIn 2003, the T. Gil Bunch Centre was built. This facility includes a 431-seat theatre, dance studio, media arts room, green room, four dressing rooms, and other production related spaces as well as a music suite.\n\nIn 2010, Crooks Hall was built featuring an oceanfront dining room and student services centre that seats 350 people at rectangular tables.

The screenplay was written by Nick Villiers and Alison Cross. Rafelson has stated that the film forms the final part of his unofficial trilogy with Nicholson, with whom he made \"Five Easy Pieces\" and \"The King of Marvin Gardens\" in the 1970s.\n\nAlex Gates (Jack Nicholson) is a wine merchant living in Miami who has distanced himself from his alcoholic wife Suzanne (Judy Davis) with his philandering, and from his stepson Jason (Stephen Dorff) with his indifference. Alex is heavily in debt, and hatches a plan to steal a valuable diamond necklace from the house of his clients, the Reese family, where his Cuban mistress Gabriela (Jennifer Lopez) works. He cases the house during a wine delivery with Jason, who works in Alex's business, although not happily. Jason becomes attracted to Gabriela, unaware of her relationship with his father.\n\nOn the day of the heist, Alex and his British safe-cracker partner Victor (Michael Caine) arrive at the house under the pretense that the Reeses' wine cellar needs repairs, otherwise their wine will be ruined. Gabriela was supposed to let them in, but she was fired the day before. Fortunately, Alex had cultivated a relationship with the security guard and is able to convince him to admit them. Victor sends Alex and the guard off on an errand while he works on the safe, but a second guard becomes suspicious, although Victor is able to complete the job before being discovered.\n\nThe pair decide that Alex will pawn the necklace in New York City, and he invites Gabriela to go with him. As he is packing, Suzanne chances upon the airline tickets for him and Gabriela and immediately realizes he is having another affair. The two of them get into a physical alteration and she knocks him out. Deciding to leave him, she empties out his suitcase, where he has hidden the necklace, and uses it for her own clothes. Jason walks in and the two of them flee to the Florida Keys. Upon arriving, they discover the necklace, but Suzanne doesn't want to keep it, even after Jason has it appraised, discovering it is worth $1 million. Jason also visits Gabriela back in Miami, giving her the phone number of the place they are staying at.\n\nVictor and Alex meet with Jason's friend Henry (Harold Perrineau). Alex assaults Henry in an attempt to learn Jason's whereabouts, but Henry doesn't know anything. The pair contact various jewelers to be on the lookout for the necklace and get a report from the jeweler who gave Jason the appraisal. Arriving in Key Largo, Victor pretends to flirt with Suzanne, but Jason, who has gotten a description of Henry's assailant, realizes who Victor is and after a fight, escapes with his mother in their car. Victor and Alex give chase and cause an accident that kills Suzanne. Although injured, Jason discharges himself from the hospital and returns to Miami to fight with his father, only to find Gabriela in Alex's bed. After a brief argument, they reconcile.\n\nAlex returns home to find both Jason and Gabriela there and he accuses them of having sex. Meanwhile, Victor has been following Jason and confronts him alone. Jason convinces him that he has returned the necklace to Alex, although he has done no such thing. Victor then goes to Alex's house. The two of them fight and Victor is killed. Later, Gabriela visits Jason, and he shows her the necklace. The next day, she calls Alex to tell him its location. They arrive at Jason's boat and Alex and Jason fight, during which time Alex is critically injured. Gabriela leaves the necklace with him saying that she doesn't want it. But as she is running away she fingers one of the necklace's diamonds that she has kept. With an ambulance on the way, Alex realizes he has no choice but to dispose of the evidence and throws the necklace into the ocean.\n\n\nBritish producer Jeremy Thomas was attracted to work with Rafelson due to what he perceived as the director's European sensibilities. He later remembered:\n\n\"Blood and Wine\" was shot in Miami, South Florida and the Florida Keys, including some scenes at the Caribbean Club in Key Largo. Alex's family home is located in the Coral Gables/Pinecrest area. Gabriela is shown to live in Little Havana. The Reeses live in Millionaire's Row in Miami Beach. Their house is next to Indian Creek and has a view of Collins Avenue. Jason's fishing boat is anchored in the Miami River, near Downtown Miami. Before the dance scene between Alex and Gabriela, we see a view of Southeast Financial Center in Downtown Miami.\n\nRotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, reports that 61% of 31 surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating is 6.1/10. David Rooney of \"Variety\" called it \"an amusingly caustic, straight-up serving of film noir staples spiced with star charisma\". Film critic Roger Ebert wrote, \"\"Blood & Wine\" is a richly textured crime picture based on the personalities of men who make their living desperately. Jack Nicholson and Michael Caine are the stars, as partners in a jewel theft that goes wrong in a number of ways, each way illustrating deep flaws in how they choose to live.\" Edward Guthmann of the \"San Francisco Chronicle\" rated it 2/4 stars and wrote, \"\"Blood & Wine\" has elements of classic film noir – but it's film noir with a sledgehammer and none of the genre's suggestiveness or style.\"\n\nCaine won Best Actor at the San Sebastian International Film Festival.\n\n"}

It shared its western border with Limmu-Ennarea, its eastern border with the Sidamo Kingdom of Janjero, and was separated from the Kingdom of Kaffa to the south by the Gojeb River. Jimma was considered the most powerful militarily of the Gibe kingdoms. Dawro, an Ometo dialect, was the native language; it later slowly gave way to Oromo.\n\nThe origins of Jimma are obscure, although prior to the Oromo migrations, the territory this kingdom came to occupy had been part of the Kingdom of Kaffa. According to legend, a number of Oromo groups (variously given from five to 10) were led to Jimma by a great sorceress and Queen named Makhore, who carried a \"boku\" (usually connected with the \"abba boku\", or headman of the Oromo \"Gadaa\" system) which when placed on the ground would cause the earth to tremble and men to fear. It is said that with this \"boku\", she drove the Kaffa people living in the area across the Gojeb River. While this suggests that the Oromo invaders drove the original inhabitants from the area, Herbert S. Lewis notes that Oromo society was inclusionist, and the only ethnic differences they made are reflected in the history of various kinship groups.\n\nEventually, the Oromo grew unhappy with Makhore's rule, and through a ruse, deprived her of her virginity, and destroyed her power. The various groups then pursued their own courses, loosely bound into a confederation that held councils at Hulle, where laws were passed under the \"abba boku\"; at this point, Jimma was commonly referred to as \"Jimma Kaka\".\n\nAt first, the Badi of Saqqa were the predominant clan (which led to the alternate name of \"Jimma Badi\"), but late in the 18th century another group, the Diggo of Mana, began to extend their domain, conquering the Lalo clan who lived around Jiren, and gaining access to the market and trade center at Hirmata (later called Jimma). Mohammed Hassen believes that the Badi lost their predominant position in part due to raids by king Abba Bagido of Limmu-Ennarea, but also due to constant infighting. It was during the reign of Abba Jifar I that the kingdom of Jimma coalesced, and after this time Jimma was frequently referred to as \"Jimma Abba Jifar\". King Abba Jifar also converted to Islam, and began the long process of also converting his entire kingdom to that religion.\n\nUnder King Abba Gomol, the ancient Kingdom of Garo was conquered and annexed into Jimma. King Gomol settled wealthy men from his kingdom in the former state. He also brought important men from Garo to live at Jiren, thus integrating the two polities.\n\nIt was shortly after his son Abba Jifar II assumed the throne that the power of the \"neguses\" of Shewa began to reach into the Gibe region for the first time in centuries. As Lewis notes, \"Borrelli, Franzoj and other travellers accorded him little hope of retaining his kingdom for long.\" However, heeding the wise advice of his mother Gumiti, he submitted to Menelik II, and agreed to pay tribute to the \"negus\", and counseled his neighboring kings to do the same. However, none followed his example, and King Abba Jifar instead found himself enthusiastically helping the Shewan king conquer his neighbors: Kullo in 1889, Walamo in 1894, and Kaffa in 1897. In 1928, the tribute of Jimma amounted to MTT87,000 and an additional MTT15,000 for the army.\n\nFollowing the death of Abba Jifar II, Emperor Haile Selassie seized the opportunity to finally annex Jimma. As Harold Marcus observes, the kingdom's \"autonomy had been undermined by the declining world economy, the deteriorating health of its ruler, the road that slowly advanced from Addis Abeba, the advent of air power, and the transcendent needs of modern, centralized power.\" On 5 May 1932, the official newspaper \"Berhanena Selam\" editorialized that the kingdom was in danger because her king, Abba Jifar, was old and ill and his grandson and heir no longer properly obeyed the central government and was using the kingdom's revenues to build up an army. Seven days later, on 12 May, 400 soldiers and a team of administrators descended upon Jimma and brought the kingdom to an end. During the reorganization of the provinces in 1942, the last administrative traces of the kingdom vanished into Kaffa Province.\n\nThe Kingdom of Jimma had its own administration, which was centered at the royal palace. An officer referred to as the \"azazi\" (\"the orderer\") served there as the head. His function at the court was essentially that of a majordomo, exclusively overseeing domestic palace affairs. The azazi maintained a number of treasuries, and dispensed funds to cover court-related expenses. The palace also housed professional soldiers, whom the azazi had the power to assign infrastructural maintenance chores to. Other officers oversaw other day-to-day activities at the palace, including artisanal labor and royal court guest hospitality.\n\nLike the other Gibe kingdoms, Jimma's ruler King Abba Jifar also owned many slaves. They served as officials in the royal palace, where they attended to the needs of the King's wives and supervised the abattoir and meal preparation, among other activities. The slaves also acted as jailers, market judges, and stewards of the King's territories. Additionally, they sometimes served as governors of a province, though this position was usually given to wealthy \"nagadras\" (chief of trade and markets).\n\nAt noon, the King, his retinue, court officials and guests dined together at the \"mana sank'a\" (\"house of the table\"). It consisted of a great hall with several large round wooden tables. The King and 20 to 30 other individuals sat around the main table, with the remaining tables ranked in importance according to how close they were positioned to the King. During the evening, the King typically dined alone with one of his wives, and often summoned instrumentalists or Arab merchants with a gramophone for musical accompaniment.\n\nIn Jimma, Maria Theresa Thalers () and salt blocks called \"amoleh\" were used as currency until the reign of Emperor Menelik II.\n\nCoffee (\"Coffea arabica\") became a major cash crop in Jimma only in the reign of King Abba Jifar II. Another source of income was the extraction of oil from Civets, which was used to make perfume.\n\n"}

The firm was previously known as Hicks, Muse, Tate & Furst. It was founded in 1989 by Tom Hicks and John Muse as Hicks, Muse & Co. and was changed in 1994 to reflect the roles of Charles Tate and Jack Furst.\n\nThe son of a Texas radio station owner, Tom Hicks became interested in leveraged buyouts as a member of First National Bank's venture capital group. Hicks and Robert Haas formed \"Hicks & Haas\" in 1984; the next year that firm bought \"Hicks Communications\", a radio outfit run by Hicks' brother Steven. (This would be the first of several media companies bought or created by the buyout firm that involved Steven Hicks.)\n\nHicks & Haas' biggest coup was its mid-1980s acquisition of several soft drink makers, including Dr Pepper and 7 Up. The firm took Dr Pepper/7 Up public just 18 months after merging the two companies. In all, Hicks & Haas turned an $88 million investment funding into $1.3 billion. The pair split up in 1989; Hicks wanted to raise a large pool to invest, but Haas preferred to work deal by deal. Robert Haas went on to form Haas Wheat & Partners a middle market private equity firm based in Dallas.\n\nHicks raised $250 million in 1989 and teamed with former Prudential Securities banker John Muse to form Hicks Muse. Early investments included Life Partners Group (life insurance, 1990; sold 1996). In 1991 Morgan Stanley's Charles Tate and First Boston's Jack Furst became partners.\n\nAs part of its buy-and-build strategy, Hicks Muse bought DuPont's connector systems unit in 1993, renamed it Berg Electronics, added six more companies to it, and doubled its earnings before selling it in 1998. Not every acquisition was successful for Hicks Muse. Less-than-successful purchases included bankrupt brewer G. Heileman Brewing Company of La Crosse, Wisconsin, bought in 1994 and sold two years later for an almost $100 million loss.\n\nThe buyout firm's Chancellor Media radio company went public in 1996. That year Hicks Muse gained entry into Latin America with its purchases of cash-starved Mexican companies, including Seguros Commercial America, one of the country's largest insurers. That year also brought International Home Foods (Jiffy Pop, Chef Boyardee) into the Hicks Muse fold.\n\nIn 1997 Chancellor and Evergreen Media merged to form Chancellor Media (renamed AMFM in 1999). The next year Hicks Muse continued buying US and Latin American media companies, as well as a few oddities (a UK software maker, a Danish seed company, and US direct-seller Home Interiors and Gifts). Hicks Muse and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts merged their cinema operations to form the US's largest theater chain, Regal Cinemas. Regal would file for bankruptcy protection in 2001. The company that year also moved into the depressed energy field (Triton Energy) and formed a $1.5 billion European fund.\n\nAcquisitions in 1999 included UK food group Hillsdown Holdings, one-third of Mexican flour maker Grupo Minsa, and (just in time for millennial celebrations) popular champagne brands Mumm and Perrier-Jouët (it quadrupled its investment when it sold the champagne houses in late 2000). Lured by low stock prices on real estate investment trusts (REITs), the company agreed to buy Walden (formerly Walden Residential Properties) that year.\n\nHicks Muse, along with UK-based Apax Partners, bought British Telecom's yellow page directory business Yell Group for roughly $3.5 billion, making it the largest non-corporate LBO in European history. Yell subsequently acquired US directories publisher McLeodUSA for about $600 million, and floated in 2003.\n\nHicks Muse acquired Nestlé's Ambient Food Business in 2002, which added well-known UK brands Crosse & Blackwell, Branston Pickle, Chivers (marmalade), Sun-Pat (peanut butter), Gale's (honey), Sarson's (vinegar) and Rowntree's (jelly) to the Premier Foods stable. Cereal maker Weetabix Limited and Unilever's cast-offs Ambrosia (creamed rice and puddings) and Brown & Polson, rounded out Premier Foods' portfolio in 2003.\n\nAcquisitions in 2004 included Kerns Oil & Gas (renamed Blackbrush Energy -- natural gas production), Persona (Canadian cable television company), Regency Gas Services (gas processing and distribution), and Centennial Puerto Rico Cable TV (Puerto Rican cable television company). It also agreed to buy a majority stake in trendy luxury shoemaker Jimmy Choo. Disposals during the year included the company's remaining stake in Yell and its stake in Premier Foods.\n\nIn May 2005, Sturm Foods was acquired by HM Capital Partners. Located in Manawa, Wisconsin, Sturm Foods specializes in manufacturing of bulk goods such as oatmeal and markets several sugar free products under private labels.\n\nHicks Muse struggled in the years immediately following the bursting of the internet and telecom bubbles was often cited with Forstmann Little as the highest profile private equity casualties, having invested heavily in technology and telecommunications companies. The firm's reputation and market position were both damaged by the loss of over $1 billion from minority investments in six telecommunications and 13 Internet companies at the peak of the 1990s stock market bubble as well as several traditional buyouts that ended in bankruptcy (e.g., Regal Cinemas, Viasystems Group, International Wire.\n\nTom Hicks resigned from Hicks Muse at the end of 2004 and was replaced at the helm by co-founder John Muse. Hicks would go on to found Hicks Holdings LLC. Charles Tate resigned from Hicks Muse in 2002.\n\nIn January 2005, the company's European arm, separated from Hicks Muse to form Lion Capital LLP, which has since raised over $4 billion across two private equity funds.\n\nIn March 2006, Hicks Muse Tate & Furst changed its name to HM Capital reflecting the departure of Tom Hicks and the new group of partners heading the firm. HM Capital appears to be overcoming initial obstacles, raising new capital from institutional investors for a $1 billion private equity fund, its first in more than five years.\n\nIn 2013, HM Capital began dissolving. The energy group spun out as Tailwater Capital and the food group spun off as Kainos Capital.\n\n"}

It consists of 16 instrumental tracks and two covers of \"Mad World\" by Tears for Fears.\n\nRichard Kelly commissioned Michael Andrews, a San Diego musician and television and film composer who had worked as a member of a range of bands, including The Origin with Gary Jules, whose two solo albums he had produced, and The Greyboy Allstars. Kelly said that he was confident that Michael Andrews could do the job: \"I met with Michael and I just knew right away that he was really, really talented and that he could come up with a really original score. He would allow me to be in there and be really kind of editorial with how I wanted the score to be.\"\n\nMichael Andrews relocated to Los Angeles to work on the film between October and December 2000. As Michael Andrews states, the low budget for the project encouraged him to play a diverse range of instruments for the soundtrack:\n\n\"The film was pretty low budget so my portion of the money was pretty thin. I couldn't hire anyone, it was just me. I played everything; piano, mellotron, mini marimba, xylophone, ukulele, organ. I also brought in two female vocalists Sam Shelton and Tori Haberman. But no guitar because Richard said no guitar or drums; he just wasn't into it. I was down with that - I've played guitar my whole life.\"\nLike many of his role models for soundtrack composing such as John Barry and Ennio Morricone, Michael Andrews wanted to put a song on his otherwise instrumental score. He eventually chose \"Mad World\" (1982) by Tears for Fears, who were one of his and childhood friend Gary Jules' favourite bands while growing up. Andrews enlisted Jules to sing the song, while Andrews himself played the piano. Other songs featured in the film include \"The Killing Moon\" by Echo & the Bunnymen (another of Andrews' and Jules' favourite bands), Joy Division's \"Love Will Tear Us Apart\", The Church's \"Under the Milky Way\" in the party scene, and \"Proud to Be Loud\" by the band Pantera.\n\nAndrews' style of composing owes much to the ground-breaking Symphony No. 3 (Symphony of Sorrowful Songs) by Henryk Górecki, to which Cherita mimes on stage. An excerpt of \"For Whom the Bell Tolls\", as composed by Steve Baker and Carmen Daye, starts the credit sequence at the end of the film. This music was however not included in the album-version of the soundtrack.\n\nIn the 2004 , a number of musical choices are changed. In the film's opening, \"The Killing Moon\" by Echo & the Bunnymen is replaced by \"Never Tear Us Apart\" by INXS. \"The Killing Moon\" later replaces \"Under the Milky Way\" by The Church during the party scene. \"Under The Milky Way\" can be heard in the car scene with Donnie and his father, played on the radio. Many of these tracks were originally meant to be on the soundtrack, but could not be obtained for licensing reasons.\n\nThe score was not put on a soundtrack album until Andy Factor, a friend of Michael Andrews, released it on his independent label, Everloving Records, in 2002. As \"Donnie Darko\" was not a hit at first, there was little interest in the soundtrack in the United States. However, the film enjoyed more popularity in Europe, especially in the UK, where its total box office was greater than that for the whole of the U.S., and so the \"Donnie Darko\" soundtrack album was released.\n\nThis sparked interest in the soundtrack and in the song \"Mad World\", taken from the original soundtrack, which was a 2003 Christmas Number One in the UK singles chart. It has also made the charts in a number of other countries including Ireland, Denmark, the Netherlands, and Australia in 2003 and 2004.\n\nMadonna sampled the song \"Manipulated Living\" for the video introduction on her 2008/2009 Sticky & Sweet Tour.\n\nAll songs were written and performed by Michael Andrews except \"Mad World\", \"Head Over Heels\", and \"The Killing Moon\".\n\n\nCoinciding with the release of the film's director's cut, an expanded two-disc edition of the album was released in the United Kingdom in 2004. This edition included the 1980s pop and alternative rock songs from the theatrical edition and the director's cut.\n\n\nThe second disc is devoted to a remastered version of composer Michael Andrews's score.\n\n"}

He co-authored \"Valentina: Soul in Sapphire\" (1984) with Joseph H. Delaney. The computer program, Valentina, was one of science fiction's earliest examples of sentient computer software, completely unlike mainframe AIs such as HAL and Colossus.\n\nStiegler also wrote the short story, \"The Gentle Seduction\" based on Vinge's ideas about a technological \"singularity,\" the exponential growth of future technology that will drastically affect the human condition. The story's characters are augmented with molecular nanotechnology. The 'seducer' is the technology itself, and perhaps the programmers of the technology. He realized the majority of mankind is more willing to swallow a pill that fixes one's back (this happens in the story) than take a pill that installs a computer in one's forehead (also from the story). He also realized that many humans do not have the mental fortitude to survive the Technological singularity. The heroine of \"The Gentle Seduction\" is a normal woman whose very elemental connection with her own identity is key in soothing humanity's jarring experience of finally meeting an alien mind.\n\nStiegler's software development career partly parallels his science fiction. His non-fiction work, \"Hypermedia and the Singularity\" predates the development of the Web and predicts that hypertext will play a key role in accelerating the evolution of knowledge. Shortly after writing this article, he took over management, of Project Xanadu, the hypertext system envisioned by Ted Nelson. Later software development efforts included the development of DecideRight (1995) which won the Software Publishing Association's CODIE Award for Best Numeric or Data Software Program. In the late 1990s his attention turned to computer security. Later he developed CapDesk, a capability-based desktop resistant to cyberattack, and invented the principles underlying Polaris, an overlay for the Windows operating system that secures the system against several important kinds of computer viruses and trojan horses. He gave talks on object capability security at the RSA Conference in 2012 and 2013.

The clouds carried by the Marin frequently cause rain on the slopes of the mountains in the interior, the Corbières Massif, Montagne Noire, and the Cévennes.
