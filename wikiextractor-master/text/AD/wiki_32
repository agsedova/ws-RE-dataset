Previously he was Minister of Justice from 1972 to 1975. A leading member of the Cameroon People's Democratic Movement (CPDM), Achidi Achu was appointed as Chairman of the National Investment Corporation in 2003, and he was \"elected\", or betterstill appointed by Paul Biya, to the Senate of Cameroon in 2013.\n\nAchidi Achu was born in Bamenda and grew up in Santa, located in the Northwest Province of Cameroon. He completed primary education in Santa and then continued to Cameroon Protestant College, where he had his GCE Ordinary Level. Pa Achu later continued to the University of Yaoundé, where he participated in the creation of the Student Association, which still exists. He also served as the association's first president. He continued his studies in Marseille, France.\n\nAchidi Achu was a state magistrate from October 1965 to October 1966. Later, he was appointed as Minister Delegate at the State Federal Inspectorate in late October 1971. He was subsequently appointed as Minister of Justice by Cameroonian President Ahmadou Ahidjo on 3 July 1972, remaining in that position until 1975. Pa Simon then returned to Santa and started the Rock Farm Ranch as a farmer.\n\nHe stayed out of politics for several years, then he was elected as a member of the National Assembly. President Paul Biya later appointed him as Prime Minister on 9 April 1992, following the March 1992 parliamentary election. He was the first Anglophone Prime Minister of Cameroon.\n\nOn 10 October 1992, the day before the 1992 presidential election, Achidi Achu appeared on Cameroon Radio and Television and addressed the people in French, his second language. In this address, he accused the opposition, led by Social Democratic Front (SDF) candidate John Fru Ndi, of having a \"diabolical plan\" (\"plan diabolique\") to prosecute and execute the leading figures of the state, government, and military if it won the election, and he urged the people to reject the opposition in order to avert potential violence and instability.\n\nFollowing Biya's victory in the 1992 election, Achidi Achu remained Prime Minister until 19 September 1996, when he was replaced by Peter Mafany Musonge. Achidi Achu was later appointed as Chairman of the Board of Directors of the National Investment Corporation (\"Société nationale des Investissements\") on 3 March 2003.\n\nAchidi Achu is a member of the Central Committee of the ruling CPDM. He was also a member of the National Commission for the coordination of Biya's election campaign in the 2004 presidential election and was the president of the campaign's support and follow up committee in the Northwest Province. He has also headed the discipline commission of the CPDM. During the campaign for the July 2007 parliamentary and municipal elections, Achidi Achu was a member of the CPDM's Central Campaign Committee; he was also President of the CPDM Provincial Campaign Committee in the Northwest Province.\n\nIn 2009, Achidi Achu became one of three members of the CPDM North West Section's newly established Council of the Wise, which was intended to formulate strategy and tactics to enable the CPDM to attain dominance in the North West Province, where the opposition Social Democratic Front (SDF) has been traditionally dominant.\n\nIn the April 2013 Senate election, Achidi Achu was elected to the Senate as the top candidate on the CPDM's list for Northwest Province. When the Bureau of the Senate was elected on 12 June 2013, Achidi Achu received the post of Vice-President of the Senate.\n"}

She was previously a Progressive Democrats Teachta Dála (TD) for the Longford–Roscommon constituency from 2002 to 2007.\n\nShe is a native of the townland of Glack, near Longford town.\n\nMae Sexton first became active in elected politics in 1991, when she stood as an independent candidate for Longford Town Council and Longford County Council and was elected to both bodies, receiving the largest number of votes in each case. She stood at the 1992 general election in Longford–Roscommon as an independent candidate, but obtained only 1,160 first preference votes (2.6%), and was eliminated, failing to be elected.\n\nPrior to the 1997 general election, she joined the Progressive Democrats, and stood in the Longford–Roscommon constituency for the party, obtaining 2,289 first preference votes (4.8%), and being eliminated on the second count.\n\nShe was re-elected to both Longford Urban District and County Councils in the 1999 local elections, although her first preference vote for both bodies had declined.\n\nShe stood again at the 2002 general election. Her first preference vote increased to 4,679 (9.4%), and she was elected to Dáil Éireann, finishing 54 votes ahead of a Fianna Fáil candidate for the final seat, having edged out the sitting Fine Gael TD, Louis Belton, by just over 200 votes at an earlier stage in the count. Her election in 2002, in a predominantly rural midland constituency for a party often associated with the urban middle classes was one of the major surprises of that election, and came after a series of near misses from elimination during the progress of the election count.\n\nSexton maintained an active profile within County Longford during her time as a Dáil deputy and built a minor profile nationally as a panellist on political discussion programmes on radio and television. In June 2005, she attracted attention by calling for the Irish government to abandon plans for a referendum on the European Constitution after the defeats of the referendums in France and the Netherlands.\n\nHer political future was affected by changes in constituency boundaries which came into force at the 2007 general election. County Longford was included in a new Longford–Westmeath constituency. At the local elections in 2004, in which Sexton was not allowed to stand because of legislation forbidding TDs and Senators to serve on local councils, her personal vote largely failed to transfer to her local party colleagues, with her former County Council seat being lost and only the Longford Town Council seat being held by the party.\n\nAt the 2007 general election she lost her seat, polling only 2,298 first preference votes (4.2%) in the new constituency and being eliminated on the third count. Unofficial tally figures published in local newspapers showed that her vote had halved in her County Longford base, while she received negligible support in County Westmeath. After the poor performance of the PDs in the election, she said in an interview with local radio that she was still committed to the party.\n\nWith the dissolution of the Progressive Democrats in 2009, Sexton stood as an independent candidate at the 2009 local elections in Longford. She regained her seats on both the Longford County and Town Councils.\n\nIn April 2010, the Labour Party announced that Sexton had accepted an invitation to join the party. Sexton ran in the 2011 general election in Longford–Westmeath alongside sitting Labour TD Willie Penrose. She was unsuccessful garnering 3,960 votes or 6.8% of the poll. She left the Labour Party in December 2012, citing concerns over the budget.\n\nShe was re-elected to Longford County Council at the 2014 local elections. She was an unsuccessful independent candidate at the 2016 general election for the Longford–Westmeath constituency. She lost her seat on Longford County Council at the 2019 local elections.\n\n \n"}

He released his debut album, \"Van Hunt\", in 2004, and a follow-up, \"On the Jungle Floor\", in 2006, both on Capitol Records. He won the Grammy Award for Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals for appearing on the tribute version of the Sly & the Family Stone song, \"Family Affair\", in 2007. He transitioned to Blue Note Records where his 2008 album, \"Popular\", was shelved and would not be released until 2017. He self-released the compilation album \"Use in Case of Emergency\" in 2009.\n\nHunt was born in Dayton, Ohio. His father, Van Hunt, Sr., was a friend of Ohio Players drummer Jimmy \"Diamond\" Williams. Hunt took up the drums at age 7, and saxophone at the age of 8, later adding bass and keyboards. Guitar was the last instrument he learned to play; he played guitar in a rock band called Royalty. Hunt moved to Arlington, Texas for a short time before relocating to Atlanta, Georgia in 1996 to attend Morehouse College, where he studied English, but soon dropped out. In Atlanta, he started producing a few hip-hop demos for Atlanta rappers in order to pay bills. Hunt met up-and-coming record producers and artists like Dallas Austin, Jermaine Dupri and TLC through his work on demos.\n\nHunt wrote and co-produced the song \"Hopeless\" for singer Dionne Farris, formerly of Arrested Development, and joined her band on guitar and keyboards. \"Hopeless\" appeared on the soundtrack for the film \"Love Jones\" (1997). Hunt co-wrote several songs with Rahsaan Patterson on his album \"Love in Stereo\" (1999), and co-wrote with Cree Summer, including the song \"Mean Sleep\", for her album \"Street Faërie\" (1999), produced by Lenny Kravitz. He also collaborated with Joi on the single \"Missing You\" (2002). Through Dionne Farris, Hunt met A&R person Randy Jackson (who later went on to be a judge on Fox's \"American Idol\"). Jackson would become Hunt's manager in 2002.\n\nHunt recorded much of the songs from his debut album in 2000. Producer Dallas Austin took Hunt's recording to Capitol Records, leading him to sign with the label in 2001. Hunt's first album, \"Van Hunt\", was released in February 2004. The album included the singles \"Down Here in Hell (With You)\", \"Dust\", and \"Seconds of Pleasure\", and was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Urban/Alternative Performance. Hunt's second album, \"On the Jungle Floor\", was released in 2006. The album featured the single, \"Character,\" a revisited \"Mean Sleep\", as a duet with Nikka Costa, and a cover of \"No Sense of Crime\" by The Stooges. The album was co-produced by Bill Bottrell. Hunt has toured and appeared with Mary J. Blige, Alicia Keys, Boney James, The Roots, Seal, Angie Stone, Coldplay, The Brand New Heavies, the Dave Matthews Band, and Kanye West.\n\nIn 2006, Hunt appeared with Nikka Costa on the Sam Moore album, \"Overnight Sensational\", on the song \"If I Had No Loot\". Hunt was also featured on \"Half the Fun\", a track on the Count Bass D album, \"Act Your Waist Size\", released on Fat Beats Records.\n\nIn 2007, Hunt won a Grammy Award for Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals, along with John Legend and Joss Stone, for their cover of the Sly & the Family Stone song, \"Family Affair\", which appeared on the 2006 tribute album \"Different Strokes by Different Folks\". Hunt described winning the award as \"one of the bigger pleasures I've had\" to \"The Athens Blur Magazine\" in 2009.\n\nHunt released the 4 track digital EP, \"The Popular Machine\", on August 7, 2007. Hunt announced a full-length album, \"Popular\", to be released on Blue Note Records on January 15, 2008. Hunt moved from Atlanta to Los Angeles in 2007 while the album was nearing completion. Blue Note had taken over Hunt's recording contract after corporate restructuring at Blue Note and Capitol's parent company, EMI. In December 2007, Blue Note announced that they would not be releasing the album, and that Hunt and the label mutually agreed to part ways. Hunt wrote on his MySpace blog in January 2008, that he couldn't promise that \"Popular\" would ever be officially released. Blue Note owns the master recordings and opted not to sell it back to him at an affordable price. Hunt commented that he \"didn't think that they had enough money\" to promote the album properly. \"LA Weekly\" called the album an \"appealingly trippy fusion of funk grooves, punk guitar and soul vocals\", and \"a left-field stunner\". Hunt told the Atlanta alternative weekly newspaper \"Creative Loafing\" that he was \"devastated\" when the label decided not to release the album. In August 2017, \"Popular\" finally saw an official release on all online distributors 10 years after it was shelved.\n\nAs of June 2008, Hunt was recording a fourth album, which he planned to release himself and market using the Internet. Hunt has blogged about his new approach on his MySpace page. Hunt toured the U.S. in July and August 2008. Meanwhile he released \"Use in Case of Emergency\", a compilation of demos, remixes and B-sides recorded between 1997 and 2005, through his Web site in May 2009.

In July 2009, Hunt told \"The Atlanta Journal-Constitution\" that he plans to release one more album and tour once more, but does not know what his plans are after that. Hunt performed at the National Black Arts Festival's tribute to Curtis Mayfield at Atlanta Symphony Hall on July 16, 2010.\n\nOn June 14, 2011 Van Hunt took to his Twitter to announce the release of his first song in 3 years. The song \"June\" was released on June 15 at midnight via Mike Ragogna of The Huffington Post along with the announcement of the title of his forthcoming album (\"What were you hoping for\"?) and its release date. A subsequent longer article about the song \"June\" and the new album and Van's new approach would appear later that same day on the Music remedy website. This article would not only talk about the joint venture-between Hunt's own label Godless-hotspot and Thirty-Tigers. It also goes on to say that \"June\" is the first of a series of free songs that will be released from various sites up until the release of the new album. The next will be \"eyes Like Pearls\" the first official single from the album that is set to be released to radio sometime in July\n\nVan Hunt released updates of work on his upcoming album via PledgeMusic during the course of 2014. In March 2015, he announced the title of his album as \"The Fun Rises, the Fun Sets\", due for release on May 5, 2015. He previewed the release of the new album with the new single \"Vega (Stripes On)\", which was available for release via iTunes and Amazon and followed this up with another single, \"Old Hat\".

NPR has described the band as one with an \"irresistible rock 'n' roll swagger\". \"Rolling Stone\" also went on to include Randolph upon their list of the 100 greatest guitarists of all time. The band has released six studio albums and has been Grammy nominated four times.\nFrontman Robert Randolph was trained as a pedal steel guitarist in the House of God Church and makes prominent use of the instrument in the band's music. The instrument is referred to in many African-American Pentecostal churches as \"sacred steel\". Randolph was discovered while playing at a sacred steel convention in Florida.\n\nThe group's sound is inspired by legendary funk bands such as Earth, Wind & Fire and Sly & the Family Stone. Randolph himself has explained that in his adolescent years before being discovered by the secular community, he was almost completely unaware of non-religious music. He went on exclaim in an interview that “I grew up and saw a lot of older guys playing lap steels and pedal-steel guitars in my church. I had never heard of the Allman Brothers, or even Buddy Guy or Muddy Waters.”\n\nBefore releasing albums with The Family Band, Randolph was selected by avant-garde jazz organist John Medeski to join him and the North Mississippi Allstars on their 2001 jam project, The Word. Just prior to the release of The Word's debut album, Randolph was brought to the attention of music fans through a review by Neil Strauss in the \"New York Times\" in April 2001. On their first non-church tour of the East Coast, Randolph's new Family Band opened for the North Mississippi Allstars and then rejoined the musicians after their set, with Medeski, as The Word.\n\nThe first Robert Randolph and the Family Band album, \"Live at the Wetlands\", was released in 2002 on Family Band Records, recorded live on August 23, 2001, just prior to the club's closing. The band released their studio debut, \"Unclassified\" on August 5, 2003. They attracted the attention of Eric Clapton, and have subsequently toured as a supporting act with the English blues guitarist. Clapton later guested on their 2006 album \"Colorblind\", playing on a cover of \"Jesus Is Just Alright\".\n\nIn 2002, they were hired by ABC to make the network's new NBA theme song. The song, \"We Got Hoops\", only appeared in three telecasts, though it was used throughout both the NBA and WNBA seasons during promotions for both leagues. In September 2003 Randolph was listed as No. 97 on \"Rolling Stone's\" 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time list. Robert entered the list following Leigh Stephens and directly preceding Angus Young. In February 2004 Robert Randolph and the Family Band along with the band O.A.R. released a cover version of Led Zeppelin's \"Fool in the Rain\", which was made available for online purchase through iTunes. This version was played live with O.A.R. at their June 18, 2009 show at Charter One Pavilion in Chicago.\n\nTheir third album, \"Colorblind\", was released October 10, 2006. The song \"Ain't Nothing Wrong With That\" was used in several commercials for NBC, and used in Katherine Jenkins and Mark Ballas' jive on Dancing with the Stars. In June 2008 the Discovery Channel used this same song in a popular promo entitled \"It's All Good\" for their summer lineup. The song \"Thrill of It\" was used throughout the 2007 college football season by ABC during their College Primetime games.\n\nThey worked with producer T-Bone Burnett on their fourth studio album \"We Walk This Road\", released in 2010. They released the supposed first single from that album entitled \"Get There\" but this song did not appear on the album. The first official single from the album is \"If I Had My Way.\"\n\nTheir 2019 recording, \"Brighter Days\", was chosen as a 'Favorite Blues Album' by AllMusic.\n\nRandolph's concerts are known for their lively stage performances, with Randolph content to let the rest of the band play on while he dances. Dance is an integral part of the concerts. During \"Shake Your Hips\", women are encouraged to dance onstage. For the song \"The March\", Randolph leaves his instrument to instruct the crowd on how to properly perform the intricate dance move.\n\nOther noteworthy concert regulars involve the entire band trading instruments allowing each member to show off their musical proficiency. When he becomes completely enthralled by his music, Randolph will kick the chair away from his pedal steel guitar and dance while he plays. A microphone is occasionally passed around the front row of the audience, so they can sing during the song \"I Need More Love\". Audience members are also called up on stage to sing (\"Purple Haze\") or be a guest guitarist for one song.\n\nThe band made its first television appearance on \"Late Show with David Letterman\" on August 5, 2003, performing \"I Need More Love\".\n\nIn 2004 Robert Randolph and the Family Band was the opening act on the Eric Clapton tour. They are featured prominently in the Clapton's \"Crossroads Guitar Festival\" DVD (2004). The band also appears on Bonnaroo Music Festival DVDs. The length of the concerts can vary greatly depending on what songs are played (the band does not use a set list) and how long jams last. Concerts go over the allotted time if the band and the audience are having fun. Most concerts don't have an intermission; instead, band members will exit the stage leaving one or two members a chance to shine with solos. The one time the band does stop is so the band can relax, get hydrated, and plan the encore. On October 9, 2004 Robert Randolph and the Family Band appeared on the PBS television show Austin City Limits.\n\nOn January 24, 2007, they played in Dallas at Victory Plaza outside of the American Airlines Center as part of the 2007 NHL All Star game festivities.

He reviewed more than one thousand films during his tenure there.\n\nCanby was born in Chicago, Illinois, the son of Katharine Anne (née Vincent) and Lloyd Canby. He attended boarding school in Christchurch, Virginia, with novelist William Styron, and the two became friends. He introduced Styron to the works of E. B.

After war service in the Pacific theater, he attended Dartmouth College, but did not graduate.\n\nHe obtained his first job as a journalist in 1948 for the \"Chicago Journal of Commerce\". In 1951, he left Chicago for New York and was employed as a film critic by \"Variety\" for six years before beginning to work for \"The New York Times\".\n\nCanby was an enthusiastic supporter of only specific styles of filmmakers; notably Stanley Kubrick, Spike Lee, Jane Campion, Mike Leigh, Rainer Werner Fassbinder, James Ivory and Woody Allen, who credited Canby's rave review of \"Take the Money and Run\" as a crucial point in his career. On the other hand, Canby was also highly critical of some otherwise acclaimed films, such as \"Rocky\", \"The Empire Strikes Back\", \"Return of the Jedi\", \"Night of the Living Dead\", \"After Hours\", \"Blazing Saddles\", \"A Christmas Story\", \"Witness\", \"Mask\", \"The Natural\", \"Rain Man\", \"The Exorcist\", \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\", \"Deliverance\", \"The Godfather Part II\", \"Alien\" and \"The Thing\". Among the best-known texts written by Canby was an extremely negative review of the movie \"Heaven's Gate\" by Michael Cimino.\n\nIn the early 1990s, Canby switched his attention from film to theatre; he was named the chief theatre critic in 1994.\n\nCanby, was also an occasional playwright and novelist, penning the novels \"Living Quarters\" (1975) and \"Unnatural Scenery\" (1979) and the plays \"End of the War\" (1978), \"After All\" (1981) and \"The Old Flag\" (1984), a drama set during the civil war.\n\nThe career of Vincent Canby is discussed in the film \"\" by contemporary critics such as \"The Nation\"s Stuart Klawans, who talks of Canby's influence.\n\nCanby never married, but was, for many years, the companion of English author Penelope Gilliatt.

In addition to officials and merchants, the road was used by scholars from Gyeongsang on their way to and from the \"gwageo\", national examinations held in the capital.\n\nMuch of the course of the road was destroyed in the course of the 20th century. However, a few small stretches have been preserved. The most notable of these is Mungyeong Saejae, where the road crossed the Sobaek Mountains.\n\n"}

He grew up in Wilmette, Illinois the second oldest of five children including his brothers, Fred and Gordon and sisters, Marge (Peppy) and Marilyn. His high school days were spent at New Trier High School in Winnetka, Illinois.\n\nMacKenzie and his first wife, Alix, studied with Bernard Leach from 1949 to 1952. His simple, wheel-thrown functional pottery is heavily influenced by the aesthetic of Shoji Hamada and Korean ceramics. He is credited with bringing the Japanese Mingei style of pottery to Minnesota, fondly referred to as the \"Mingei-sota style.\"\n\nMacKenzie described his goal as the making of \"everyday\" pots. Accordingly, although his pots are found in major museums and command high prices among collectors, MacKenzie has always kept his prices low and for various time periods did not sign his work (1970s, most of the 2000s) until recently resuming the use of his chop at the end of 2009. Most of his output was produced in stoneware, although he worked in porcelain at times during his career.\n\nMacKenzie was well known as a teacher. Since 1953 he had taught at the University of Minnesota, where he was a Regents' professor emeritus. His students have included Randy Johnston, Dick Cooter, Mike Norman, Jeff Oestreich, Wayne Branum, Mark Pharis, Barbara Diduk, Nancy d'Estang, Paul Dresang, Shirley Johnson, Michael Brady, Sandy Simon, and E.A. (Mike) Mikkelsen.\n\nWarren MacKenzie's second wife of 30 years, Nancy MacKenzie, died in October 2014, at the age of 80. Nancy was an accomplished textile artist using found objects from nature and the recycle bin. Warren continued to live in the home they shared outside Stillwater, Minnesota, where he maintained his studio until his death on December 31, 2018. Until December 2006, MacKenzie also housed a showroom on his property. The showroom operated strictly on the \"honor system\" whereby pots were marked with price stickers and visitors would pay for pots by placing their money in a wicker basket, making change for themselves as appropriate. Unfortunately, due to theft and customers selling his work for an outrageous profit online, MacKenzie closed his showroom, opting instead to sell his pots through the Northern Clay Center in Minneapolis, Minnesota, Trax Gallery in California, Lacoste Gallery in Massachusetts, and the Schaller Gallery in Michigan, as well as exhibitions around the country.\n\nOn December 31, 2018, MacKenzie died aged 94.\n\n"}

Developmental disabilities cause individuals living with them many difficulties in certain areas of life, especially in \"language, mobility, learning, self-help, and independent living\". Developmental disabilities can be detected early on and persist throughout an individual's lifespan. Developmental disability that affects all areas of a child's development is sometimes referred to as global developmental delay.\n\nThe most common developmental disabilities are:\n\n\nThe causes of developmental disabilities are varied and remain unknown in a large proportion of cases. Even in cases of known etiology the line between \"cause\" and \"effect\" is not always clear, leading to difficulty in categorizing causes.\n\nGenetic factors have long been implicated in the causation of developmental disabilities. There is also a large environmental component to these conditions, and the relative contributions of nature versus nurture have been debated for decades.\n\nCurrent theories on causation focus on genetic factors, and over 1,000 known genetic conditions include developmental disabilities as a symptom.\n\nDevelopmental disabilities affect between 1 and 2% of the population in most western countries, although many government sources acknowledge that statistics are flawed in this area. The worldwide proportion of people with developmental disabilities is believed to be approximately 1.4%. It is twice as common in males as in females, and some researchers have found that the prevalence of mild developmental disabilities is likely to be higher in areas of poverty and deprivation, and among people of certain ethnicities.\n\nDevelopmental disabilities can be initially suspected when a child does not reach expected child development stages. Subsequently, a differential diagnosis may be used to diagnose an underlying disease, which may include a physical examination and genetic tests.\n\nThe degree of disability can be quantified by assigning a \"developmental age\" to a person, which is age of the group into which test scores place the person. This, in turn, can be used to calculate a \"\" (DQ) as follows:\n\nformula_1\n\nThere are many physical health factors associated with developmental disabilities. For some specific syndromes and diagnoses, these are inherent, such as poor heart function in people with Down syndrome. People with severe communication difficulties find it difficult to articulate their health needs, and without adequate support and education might not recognize ill health. Epilepsy, sensory problems (such as poor vision and hearing), obesity and poor dental health are over-represented in this population. Life expectancy among people with developmental disabilities as a group is estimated at 20 years below average, although this is improving with advancements in adaptive and medical technologies, and as people are leading healthier, more fulfilling lives, and some conditions (such as Freeman–Sheldon syndrome) do not impact life expectancy.\n\nMental health issues, and psychiatric illnesses, are more likely to occur in people with developmental disabilities than in the general population. A number of factors are attributed to the high incidence rate of dual diagnoses:\n\nThese problems are exacerbated by difficulties in diagnosis of mental health issues, and in appropriate treatment and medication, as for physical health issues.\n\nAbuse is a significant issue for people with developmental disabilities, and as a group they are regarded as vulnerable people in most jurisdictions. Common types of abuse include:\nLack of education, lack of self-esteem and self-advocacy skills, lack of understanding of social norms and appropriate behavior and communication difficulties are strong contributing factors to the high incidence of abuse among this population.\n\nIn addition to abuse from people in positions of power, peer abuse is recognized as a significant, if misunderstood, problem. Rates of criminal offense among people with developmental disabilities are also disproportionately high, and it is widely acknowledged that criminal justice systems throughout the world are ill-equipped for the needs of people with developmental disabilities—as both perpetrators and victims of crime. Failings in care have been identified in one in eight deaths of people with learning difficulties under NHS England.\n\nSome people with developmental disabilities exhibit challenging behavior, defined as \"culturally abnormal behaviour(s) of such intensity, frequency or duration that the physical safety of the person or others is placed in serious jeopardy, or behaviour which is likely to seriously limit or deny access to the use of ordinary community facilities\". Common types of challenging behavior include self-injurious behavior (such as hitting, headbutting, biting), aggressive behavior (such as hitting others, shouting, screaming, spitting, kicking, swearing, hairpulling), inappropriate sexualized behavior (such as public masturbation or groping), behavior directed at property (such as throwing objects and stealing) and stereotyped behaviors (such as repetitive rocking, echolalia or elective incontinence). Such behaviors can be assessed to suggest areas of further improvement, using assessment tools such as the Nisonger Child Behavior Rating Form (NCBRF).\n\nChallenging behavior in people with developmental disabilities may be caused by a number of factors, including biological (pain, medication, the need for sensory stimulation), social (boredom, seeking social interaction, the need for an element of control, lack of knowledge of community norms, insensitivity of staff and services to the person's wishes and needs), environmental (physical aspects such as noise and lighting, or gaining access to preferred objects or activities), psychological (feeling excluded, lonely, devalued, labelled, disempowered, living up to people's negative expectations) or simply a means of communication. A lot of the time, challenging behavior is learned and brings rewards and it is very often possible to teach people new behaviors to achieve the same aims. Challenging behavior in people with developmental disabilities can often be associated with specific mental health problems.\n\nExperience and research suggests that what professionals call \"challenging behavior\" is often a reaction to the challenging environments that those providing services create around people with developmental disabilities. \"Challenging behavior\" in this context is a method of communicating dissatisfaction with the failure of those providing services to focus on what kind of life makes most sense to the person, and is often the only recourse a developmentally disabled person has against unsatisfactory services or treatment and the lack of opportunities made available to the person. This is especially the case where the services deliver lifestyles and ways of working that are centered on what suits the service provider and its staff, rather than what best suits the person.\n\nIn general, behavioral interventions or what has been termed applied behavior analysis has been found to be effective in reducing specific challenging behavior. Recently, efforts have been placed on developing a developmental pathway model in the behavior analysis literature to prevent challenging behavior from occurring.\n\nThroughout history, people with developmental disabilities have been viewed as incapable and incompetent in their capacity for decision-making and development. Until the Enlightenment in Europe, care and asylum was provided by families and the Church (in monasteries and other religious communities), focusing on the provision of basic physical needs such as food, shelter and clothing. Stereotypes such as the dimwitted village idiot, and potentially harmful characterizations (such as demonic possession for people with epilepsy) were prominent in social attitudes of the time.\n\nEarly in the twentieth century, the eugenics movement became popular throughout the world. This led to the forced sterilization and prohibition of marriage for the developmentally disabled in most of the developed world and was later used by Hitler as rationale for the mass murder of mentally challenged individuals during the Holocaust. The eugenics movement was later thought to be seriously flawed and in violation of human rights and the practice of forced sterilization and prohibition from marriage was discontinued by most of the developed world by the mid 20th century.\n\nThe movement towards individualism in the 18th and 19th centuries, and the opportunities afforded by the Industrial Revolution, led to housing and care using the asylum model. People were placed by, or removed from, their families (usually in infancy) and housed in large institutions (of up to 3,000 people, although some institutions were home to many more, such as the Philadelphia State Hospital in Pennsylvania which housed 7,000 people through the 1960s), many of which were self-sufficient through the labor of the residents. Some of these institutions provided a very basic level of education (such as differentiation between colors and basic word recognition and numeracy), but most continued to focus solely on the provision of basic needs. Conditions in such institutions varied widely, but the support provided was generally non-individualized, with aberrant behavior and low levels of economic productivity regarded as a burden to society. Heavy tranquilization and assembly line methods of support (such as \"birdfeeding\" and cattle herding) were the norm, and the medical model of disability prevailed. Services were provided based on the relative ease to the provider, not based on the human needs of the individual.\n\nIgnoring the prevailing attitude, Civitans adopted service to the developmentally disabled as a major organizational emphasis in 1952. Their earliest efforts included workshops for special education teachers and daycamps for disabled children, all at a time when such training and programs were almost nonexistent. In the United States, the segregation of people with developmental disabilities wasn't widely questioned by academics or policy-makers until the 1969 publication of Wolf Wolfensberger's seminal work \"The Origin and Nature of Our Institutional Models\", drawing on some of the ideas proposed by SG Howe 100 years earlier. This book posited that society characterizes people with disabilities as deviant, sub-human and burdens of charity, resulting in the adoption of that \"deviant\" role. Wolfensberger argued that this dehumanization, and the segregated institutions that result from it, ignored the potential productive contributions that all people can make to society. He pushed for a shift in policy and practice that recognized the human needs of \"retardates\" and provided the same basic human rights as for the rest of the population.\n\nThe publication of this book may be regarded as the first move towards the widespread adoption of the social model of disability in regard to these types of disabilities, and was the impetus for the development of government strategies for desegregation.Successful lawsuits against governments and an increasing awareness of human rights and self-advocacy also contributed to this process, resulting in the passing in the U.S. of the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act in 1980.\n\nFrom the 1960s to the present, most U.S. states have moved towards the elimination of segregated institutions. Along with the work of Wolfensberger and others including Gunnar and Rosemary Dybwad, a number of scandalous revelations around the horrific conditions within state institutions created public outrage that led to change to a more community-based method of providing services.\nBy the mid-1970s, most governments had committed to de-institutionalization, and had started preparing for the wholesale movement of people into the general community, in line with the principles of normalization. In most countries, this was essentially complete by the late 1990s, although the debate over whether or not to close institutions persists in some states, including Massachusetts.\n\nIndividuals with developmental disabilities are not fully integrated into society. Person Centered Planning and Person Centered Approaches are seen as methods of addressing the continued labeling and exclusion of socially devalued people, such as people with a developmental disability label, encouraging a focus on the person as someone with capacities and gifts, as well as support needs.\n\nToday, support services are provided by government agencies, non-governmental organizations and by private sector providers. Support services address most aspects of life for people with developmental disabilities, and are usually theoretically based in community inclusion, using concepts such as social role valorization and increased self-determination (using models such as Person Centred Planning). Support services are funded through government block funding (paid directly to service providers by the government), through individualized funding packages (paid directly to the individual by the government, specifically for the purchase of services) or privately by the individual (although they may receive certain subsidies or discounts, paid by the government). There also are a number of non-profit agencies dedicated to enriching the lives of people living with developmental disabilities and erasing the barriers they have to being included in their community.\n\nEducation and training opportunities for people with developmental disabilities have expanded greatly in recent times, with many governments mandating universal access to educational facilities, and more students moving out of special schools and into mainstream classrooms with support.\n\nPost-secondary education and vocational training is also increasing for people with these types of disabilities, although many programs offer only segregated \"access\" courses in areas such as literacy, numeracy and other basic skills. Legislation (such as the UK's Disability Discrimination Act 1995) requires educational institutions and training providers to make \"reasonable adjustments\" to curriculum and teaching methods in order to accommodate the learning needs of students with disabilities, wherever possible. There are also some vocational training centers that cater specifically to people with disabilities, providing the skills necessary to work in integrated settings, one of the largest being Dale Rogers Training Center in Oklahoma City. (See also Intensive interaction)\n\nMany people with developmental disabilities live in the general community, either with family members, in supervised-group homes or in their own homes (that they rent or own, living alone or with flatmates). At-home and community supports range from one-to-one assistance from a support worker with identified aspects of daily living (such as budgeting, shopping or paying bills) to full 24-hour support (including assistance with household tasks, such as cooking and cleaning, and personal care such as showering, dressing and the administration of medication). The need for full 24-hour support is usually associated with difficulties recognizing safety issues (such as responding to a fire or using a telephone) or for people with potentially dangerous medical conditions (such as asthma or diabetes) who are unable to manage their conditions without assistance.\n\nIn the United States, a support worker is known as a Direct Support Professional (DSP). The DSP works in assisting the individual with their ADLs and also acts as an advocate for the individual with a developmental disability, in communicating their needs, self-expression and goals.\n\nSupports of this type also include assistance to identify and undertake new hobbies or to access community services (such as education), learning appropriate behavior or recognition of community norms, or with relationships and expanding circles of friends. Most programs offering at-home and community support are designed with the goal of increasing the individual's independence, although it is recognized that people with more severe disabilities may never be able to achieve full independence in some areas of daily life.\n\nSome people with developmental disabilities live in residential accommodation (also known as group homes) with other people with similar assessed needs. These homes are usually staffed around the clock, and usually house between 3 and 15 residents. The prevalence of this type of support is gradually decreasing, however, as residential accommodation is replaced by at-home and community support, which can offer increased choice and self-determination for individuals. Some U.S. states still provide institutional care, such as the Texas State Schools. The type of residential accommodation is usually determined by the level of developmental disability and mental health needs.\n\nEmployment support usually consists of two types of support:\n\nWorkers with developmental disabilities have historically been paid less for their labor than those in the general workforce, although this is gradually changing with government initiatives, the enforcement of anti-discrimination legislation and changes in perceptions of capability in the general community.\n\nIn the United States, a variety of initiatives have been launched in the past decade to reduce unemployment among workers with disabilities—estimated by researchers at over 60%. Most of these initiatives are directed at employment in mainstream businesses. They include heightened placement efforts by the community agencies serving people with developmental disabilities, as well as by government agencies.\n\nAdditionally, state-level initiatives are being launched to increase employment among workers with disabilities. In California, the state senate in 2009 created the Senate Select Committee on Autism and Related Disorders. The Committee has been examining additions to existing community employment services, and also new employment approaches. Committee member Lou Vismara, chairman of the MIND Institute at University of California, Davis, is pursuing the development of a planned community for persons with autism and related disorders in the Sacramento region. Another committee member, Michael Bernick, the former director of the state labor department, has established a program at the California state university system, starting at California State University East Bay, to support students with autism on the college level. Other Committee efforts include mutual support employment efforts, such as disability job networks, job boards, and identifying business lines that build on the strengths of persons with disabilities.\n\nThough efforts are being made to integrate individuals with developmental disabilities into the workforce, businesses are still reluctant to employ individuals with IDD because of their poor communication skills and emotional intelligence. High functioning individuals with developmental disabilities can find it difficult to work in an environment that requires teamwork and direct communication due to their lack of social awareness. Working with employers to better understand the disorders and barriers that may come from the struggles associated with them, can greatly impact the quality of life for these individuals.\n\nNon-vocational day services are usually known as day centers, and are traditionally segregated services offering training in life skills (such as meal preparation and basic literacy), center-based activities (such as crafts, games and music classes) and external activities (such as day trips). Some more progressive day centers also support people to access vocational training opportunities (such as college courses), and offer individualized outreach services (planning and undertaking activities with the individual, with support offered one-to-one or in small groups).\n\nTraditional day centers were based on the principles of occupational therapy, and were created as respite for family members caring for their loved ones with disabilities. This is slowly changing, however, as programs offered become more skills-based and focused on increasing independence.\n\nAdvocacy is a burgeoning support field for people with developmental disabilities. Advocacy groups now exist in most jurisdictions, working collaboratively with people with disabilities for systemic change (such as changes in policy and legislation) and for changes for individuals (such as claiming welfare benefits or when responding to abuse). Most advocacy groups also work to support people, throughout the world, to increase their capacity for self-advocacy, teaching the skills necessary for people to advocate for their own needs.\n\nOther types of support for people with developmental disabilities may include:\n\nPrograms are set up around the country in hopes to educate individuals with and without developmental disabilities. Studies have been done testing specific scenarios on how what is the most beneficial way to educate people. Interventions are a great way to educate people, but also the most time consuming. With the busy schedules that everybody has, it is found to be difficult to go about the intervention approach. Another scenario that was found to be not as beneficial, but more realistic in the time sense was Psychoeducational approach. They focus on informing people on what abuse is, how to spot abuse, and what to do when spotted. Individuals with developmental disabilities don't only need the support programs to keep them safe, but everybody in society needs to be aware of what is happening and how to help everybody prosper.\n\n\n"}

In 1090 he left the kal'a (Beni Hammad Fort), the traditional capital of the Hammadids to settle in Béjaïa (Bougie) with his troop and His court, which he considered less accessible to the nomads. He left the region because of the destruction caused by the arrival of the banu Hilal. His father had already prepared this transfer by transforming a fishing port into a city he calls An-Nasiriya but which was to assume the name of Bougie, the name of a tribe that inhabit this region.

It had a standing total height of 68 m (223 ft) or 80 m (262 ft), making it the tallest structure in East Asia and the tallest wooden structure in the world at the time of its construction. Only the massive foundation stones of the temple remain in current times. \n\nHwangryongsa was the center of state-sponsored Buddhism during the Silla and Unified Silla eras which were cultural beacons of Buddhism during its time. Its name means \"Emperor/Imperial Dragon Temple.\" Archaeological excavations and other scientific studies of the temple began in April 1976 (OCPRI 1984) and continue today.\n\nHwangnyongsa was built during the Silla period, under the patronage of the Silla royal family, on a plain encircled by mountains near the royal palace compound of Banwolseong (Half-Moon Palace). Construction began in 553 under the reign of King Jinheung, and was not fully completed until 644. King Jinheung originally intended for the temple to be the site of a new palace but when a dragon was seen on the proposed site, a temple was commissioned instead. Hwangnyongsa was designed to be a place where monks prayed for the welfare of the nation by asking for the divine protection of the Buddha and a means to impress foreign dignitaries.\n\nFollowing the defeat of Baekje in the 660s, the Baekje architect, Abiji, was commissioned to build a nine-story wooden pagoda at the site, and labored with two hundred artisans to complete the pagoda. This fact indicates that the Baekje had superior knowledge of wooden architecture. The nine stories supposedly represented the nine nations of East Asia and Silla's future conquest of those states. The pagoda stood until it was burned by Mongolian invasions in 1238. No wooden architecture from the Silla people survives today but the ruins of Hwangnyongsa suggest a Goguryeo influence.\n\nThe temple site in a valley within Gyeongju National Park near Toham Mountain and about from Bunhwangsa Temple, was excavated in 1972, revealing the temple layout and covering 40,000 artifacts.\n\nBuddhism was strongly resisted by the nobles of Silla while the king personally supported the new religion. The king's Grand Secretary, Ichadon, suggested that he forge the king's royal seal and create an order that the people adopt the new religion. When the forgery was discovered by the nobles, Ichadon suggested that he be made the scapegoat, and that through his death the power of Buddha be made manifest. The king agreed to the plan. The nobles were predictably outraged when they discovered Ichadon's forgery and the king ordered his execution. Legend has it that when Ichadon was executed, a series of miracles occurred which proved the power and reality of the Buddhist faith, and the nobles converted to the new state religion. Ichadon's sacrifice was the impetus for the building of Hwangnyongsa Temple.\n\nAnother legend concerns the giant golden Buddha statue that the temple possessed. It was cast in the reign of King Jinheung as the temple centerpiece. The legend states that the gold for the statue came from King Ashoka of India. Ashoka had apparently attempted to cast a golden triad but failed. He then put the gold in a boat along with scale models of Bodhisattvas. Each country that received the boat was equally unable to cast the statues, and not until the boat had arrived in Silla could a statue be cast.\n\nOnly the massive foundation stones of the temple remain in current times. The original complex took seventeen years to complete.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The name was coined because the early dance-hall numbers were invariably four-piece bands (violin-piano-accordion-bass).\n\nCuarteto is almost always upbeat; its rhythm range is similar to that of modern Dominican merengue.\n\nIn the 1970s, cuarteto became one of the cornerstones of Córdoba's cultural identity—together with \"Hortensia\" magazine. Both reflected a local brand of popular culture overlooked by the establishment, and proposed an alternative to the Buenos Aires-centered culture that television was spreading to the rest of the country.\n\nCuarteto was one of the genres that gave birth to the Buenos Aires \"tropical\" scene, which was renamed as \"bailanta\" in the 1990s following the usage of Corrientes province.\n\nCuarteto Leo was the leading cuarteto band for almost 30 years, back in the 1970s. It established the sonic texture that prevails in cuarteto to this day.\n\nIn the 1980s, Carlos \"Mona\" Jiménez became the foremost exponent of cuarteto after the break-up of his two-member \"Cuarteto de Oro\" (\"Golden Quartet\"). He established a pattern of nonsense humour and extravagant behavior that many tried to ape without much success. One of his most popular songs was \"Quién se ha tomado todo el vino\" (\"Who drank all the wine?\"), which was danced with a characteristic hand move.\n\nOthers, such as producer-bandleader \"Negro\" Videla, travelled to the Dominican Republic and Colombia to expand the range of their repertoire. Videla is the unofficial ambassador of Dominican music in cuarteto, with successful covers of merengue hits.\n\nSince the late 1980s, the Tru-la-lá band has had great support from dancers. At one point they were endorsed by the Catholic church for avoiding racy themes in their lyrics. All in all, they have sold over a million records.\n\nRodrigo became the leading cuarteto singer in the mid-1990s, and made inroads into Buenos Aires middle-class audiences. He died in a car crash on June 25, 2000. Many people believe the crash was not an accident, as Rodrigo was (allegedly) a pawn in a feud between rival mobsters. His song \"La mano de Dios\" (The Hand of God), which celebrates Diego Maradona through his most famous goal, has become a classic dance song in Argentina, and was covered by Maradona himself in his successful 2005 talk show.\n\nGary (Argentine singer) was another Cuarteto singer with the Tru-la-lá band, who died of natural causes in 2001.\n\n, some of the most popular cuarteto artists are:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2225919", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2225919", "title": "Vexillatio", "text": "Vexillatio\n\nA vexillatio (plural \"vexillationes\") was a detachment of a Roman legion formed as a temporary task force created by the Roman army of the Principate. It was named from the standard carried by legionary detachments, the \"vexillum\" (plural \"vexilla\"), which bore the emblem and name of the parent legion.\n\nAlthough commonly associated with legions, it is likely that \"vexillationes\" included auxiliaries. The term is found in the singular, referring to a single detachment, but is usually used in the plural to refer to an army made up of picked detachments. \"Vexillationes\" were assembled ad hoc to meet a crisis on Rome's extensive frontiers, to fight in a civil war, or to undertake an offensive against Rome's neighbours. They varied in size and composition, but usually consisted of about 1000 infantry and/or 500 cavalry.\n\nBecause the Roman Army was not large enough to garrison the vast size of the empire (around 400,000 strong at the beginning of the 3rd century), most of it was stationed along the frontiers. This placed the empire in a precarious position when serious threats arose in the interior or along a remote frontier. There was no central reserve and it was rarely possible to take a full legion, or even a major portion of one, to a troubled area without leaving a dangerous gap in the frontier defences. The only logical solution was to take detachments from different legions and form temporary task forces to deal with the threat. As soon as it was taken care of, these \"vexillationes\" were dissolved, and the detachments returned to their parent legions.\n\nThe Roman emperors from the time of Augustus had at their disposal units in Italy and in the city of Rome. Over time these units would increase. Augustus created the praetorians who at the time of Domitianus constituted a force of ten cohorts, each of 1000 men strength on paper and who supplied a disputed number of horsemen. Traianus created the Imperial horseguards, the Equites Singulares Augusti, formed from his proconsular horseguard he had when he was the legate of Germania Inferior of about 1000 horsemen. Septimius made many changes in the Roman military. He doubled the number of the horseguards to 2000 horsemen. He filled the ranks of the Praetorians with provincial soldiers. He levied a new legion, Legio II Parthica, and for the first time in Roman history stationed it on the outskirts of Rome, making it more clear that the Roman emperor was a military dictator. Whenever the emperor went on campaign these guards units stationed in the city of Rome would accompany him. Added to these came the vexillationes of the border legions.\n\nThe \"vexillatio\" system worked initially, due to the mobility provided by the empire's excellent roads and to the high levels of discipline, cohesion and \"esprit de corps\" of these units and the legions from which they came. But during the Crisis of the Third Century (a turbulent period from 235 to about 290) \"vexillationes\" were shifted so rapidly from one area to another that units became hopelessly mixed up and became practically independent. Legions that would proclaim a commander as emperor could have a vexillatio in the real emperor's field army or garrisoned on the frontier. This was a major cause of disorganization in the Roman Army which resulted in sweeping military reforms under Diocletian and Constantine I where the basic army unit became the size of one (Quingenaria=500 Soldiers) or two (Milliaria=1000 Soldiers) cohorts instead of the 5000-man legion.\n\nLater, under the Dominate, \"vexillatio\" refers to a cavalry unit of the Roman army. From the time of Diocletian and the Tetrarchy, and possibly as early as the reign of Gallienus, \"vexillationes\" were the usual cavalry units found on campaign though the ala still remained. In the 4th century the \"Vexillationes palatinae\" and \"Vexilationes\" \"comitatenses\" of the Roman field armies are thought to have been either 300 or 600 men strong. The \"Notitia Dignitatum\" lists 88 \"vexillationes\".\n\nOther units, such as infantry \"cohortes\" and \"centuriae\", and cavalry \"alae\" and \"turmae\", may have had their own \"vexilla\". In addition, \"vexillationes\" with their own \"vexilla\" would have designated units of special troops outside the usual military structure, such as \"vexillarii\" (re-enlisted veterans), who may have served separately from the cohorts of their ordinary comrades.\n\n"}

Matusow's nickname of \"The Mouth\" reflects his reputation for trash-talking at the poker table. He is also known for sometimes ruining hours or days of good play with a single misjudgment (known as a \"Mike Matusow Blow-up\" or \"Mike Matusow Meltdown\").\n\nMatusow began playing poker seriously in the early 1990s, first while working as a poker dealer, then as a professional player. His successes include being a four-time World Series of Poker bracelet winner and the winner of the 2005 World Series of Poker Tournament of Champions.\n\nMatusow was first introduced to poker when he played video poker at the Maxim Casino at the age of 18. He was a regular and played so much that he suffered from repetitive strain injury in his shoulders and arms. He occasionally stole money from his mother's purse and at one point attended Gamblers Anonymous meetings. Matusow was taught Texas hold 'em in 1989 by a rounder named Steve Samaroff.\n\nAt the 1998 World Series of Poker (WSOP), Matusow paid part of Scotty Nguyen's entrance fee into a satellite event for the $10,000 no limit Texas hold 'em Main Event. Nguyen went on to win, and gave $333,333 to Matusow in return for his partial stake. In 1999, Matusow won his first WSOP bracelet, winning the $3,500 No Limit Hold'em event defeating Alex Brenes heads-up to win the title.\n\nIn 2001, he finished 6th place in the WSOP $10,000 no limit Hold 'em main event. Matusow says that the decisive hand was when he was bluffed by eventual champion Juan Carlos Mortensen, but did not trust his instincts to call.\n\nAt the 2002 WSOP, Matusow won his second bracelet by winning the $5,000 Omaha Hi-Low Split 8 or Better event. He defeated fellow professional poker player Daniel Negreanu to win the tournament.\n\nIn the 2005 WSOP, Matusow finished 9th out of 5,619 players in the main event, winning $1,000,000. Several months later, he won the WSOP Tournament of Champions in a heads-up battle against Hoyt Corkins, earning another $1,000,000 in the process, making him the first player to win two million dollar prizes in the same year. He also placed third in the Tournament of Champions the following year, winning $250,000.\n\nAt the 2008 World Series of Poker, Matusow won a third bracelet in the $5000 No Limit 2–7 Draw with rebuys event defeating Jeff Lisandro heads up for the $537,862 first prize. Later in the same year he finished 30th out of 6,844 players in the Main Event, making yet another deep run in the Main Event.\n\nMatusow won his fourth bracelet in 2013 in the $5,000 Seven Card Stud Hi-Lo Split 8 or Better tournament, defeating Matthew Ashton heads-up and earning $266,503.\n\nIn October 2004, Matusow made his first World Poker Tour (WPT) final table at the UltimateBet Aruba Classic, earning $250,000 for 3rd place. In 2006, he finished runner-up to Tony G in the WPT Bad Boys of Poker II in heads-up play. Matusow also appeared in Poker Superstars III, where he made it to the Elite Eight. In the winner-take-all championship match, Matusow beat seven other players to win $500,000. He also appeared in the second, third, fourth, and sixth season of High Stakes Poker. In September 2006, Mike made his debut on the European Poker Tour (EPT) in Barcelona; however, he was eliminated on the first day. In early 2007, Matusow appeared on two episodes of Poker After Dark where he finished 3rd and 2nd respectively. He plays online poker under the following aliases: \"dill pickle\" (UltimateBet); \"mrpokejoke\" (PokerStars); and \"Mike Matusow\" (Full Tilt Poker, where he was formerly a member of \"Team Full Tilt\").\n\nIn July 2007, Matusow won $671,320 after coming in second place at the World Poker Tour Bellagio Cup III Championship after online pro Kevin Saul defeated him during heads-up play. On November 11, 2008 at the World Poker Tour Foxwoods World Poker Finals, Matusow made another WPT final table, He was eliminated after his didn't improve against Jonathan Little's hand of , he finished in 6th place, earning $124,048.\n\nIn 2013, Matusow won the NBC National Heads-Up Championship, defeating Phil Hellmuth 2-1 in the final.\n\nAs of August 2014, his total live tournament winnings exceed $9,000,000. $3,580,911 of his winnings have come at the WSOP.\n\nMatusow has had several personal problems. He has battled drug issues, including a six-month stint in jail in 2004 and 2005 after being caught providing ecstasy and prescription painkillers to an undercover police officer who pretended to befriend Matusow and gained his trust. After several months of an official Las Vegas Metro Police \"Sting Operation\", Matusow was arrested and charged with six category A Felonies, all drug related. A plea deal was later reached where Matusow was incarcerated in the Clark County Detention Center for six months.\n\nMatusow resides in Henderson, Nevada. He often wears a gold chain with the Hebrew symbol 'chai' around his neck. Additionally, Matusow hosted Card Player's poker radio show/podcast, \"the Circuit\", before being replaced by Gavin Smith and Joe Sebok. He was also the host of Card Player's now defunct online video segment, \"The Mouthpiece.\" In one episode, Mike discussed the controversial Ultimatebet.com superuser cheating scandal, as well as seeking legal action as a victim of the scandal against the main perpetrator, former World Series of Poker Champion Russ Hamilton.\n\nMatusow wrote an autobiography titled \"Check Raising the Devil\" that was released May 12, 2009.\n\n"}

Porthtowan is on Cornwall's north Atlantic coast about west of St Agnes, north of Redruth, west of Truro and southwest of Newquay in the Cornwall and West Devon Mining Landscape, a World Heritage Site.\n\nPorthtowan is popular with surfers and industrial archaeologists; former mine stacks and engine houses dot the landscape.\n\nPorthtowan lies along the Godrevy Head to St Agnes heritage coast, which is located on the north Cornwall coast of the Celtic Sea in the Atlantic Ocean. It lies between Godrevy Head (with the Godrevy Towans) and St Agnes Head, north of the village of St Agnes. The Godrevy to St Agnes Heritage Coast has been a nationally designated protected area since 1986. The marine site protects 40 species of mammals and amphibians.\n\nPorthtowan is within walking distance of National Trust coastal and cliff-side walks. Between Porthtowan and Agnes Head is one of Cornwall's \"largest remaining heathland[s].\" Ironically, the heath survived – and was not turned into arable land – because of the soil contamination of previous mining activities. Few plants or species other than heathers and spiders can thrive in the area's environmental condition.\n\nIts name comes from the Cornish words \"porth\" and \"tewynn\" to mean landing place at the sand dunes.\n\nPorthtowan's history is associated with mining and one of its most prominent buildings is a former engine house converted for residential use. Allen's Corn Mill operated at Porthtowan between 1752 and 1816.\n\nPorthtowan owes much of its present-day character to its popularity as a local seaside resort in Victorian and Edwardian times when the local populace from Redruth and the surrounding areas went there, particularly on Bank Holidays.\n\nCoastal settlements in Cornwall between Perranporth and Porthtowan had copper, lead, iron, tin and zinc mines. Porthtowan mines mainly produced copper.\n\nThe South Wheal Towan copper mine also operated in the area. Still visible is its Echo Corner mine stack. The mine had a slide lode that intersected with the main lode, Hamptons and Downright lode. In addition to copper pyrites, brown iron ore was also found in the mine.\n\nThe Tywarnhayle mine was opened in 1826 as United Hills Mine but the name was changed in 1848 to Tywarnhayle Mine. It was an important source of copper ore until about 1860. Its engine house, Taylors Shaft, is visible in the hills surrounding the coastal village.\n\nThe mine was located about 1 kilometre southeast of Porthtowan. It was the United Hills Mine on 3 February 1830 when an engine boiler exploded and killed nine people. In 1906 money was invested to drain and work the Tywarnhayle mine. Water was piped out by Cornwall's first electrical centrifugal pumps, made by Worthington Simpson, at the rate of 1,000 gallons per minute. The amount of copper ore mined between 1826 and 1906 was 86,800 tons.\n\nIn Cornwall the mining industry had its own judicial system. Tywarnhayle was one of the four stannaries. There were three others: Blackmore, Foweymore and, lastly, Kerrier and Penwith. The Stannaries managed mining law, taxation, court proceedings and jails.\n\nThe mine is renowned for its pseudomorphs, in this case tin oxide, or cassiterite, that takes on the shape of the feldspar crystals that it replaces within granite.\n\nWheal Ellen was a 19th-century copper mine. Remains of the mine are visible. It operated primarily from 1826 to 1862.\n\nWheal Lushington, also known as the New Wheal Towan, was a copper mine located on a hill overlooking the beach. The engine house that was built in 1872 was never used as an engine house and has since been converted for other uses.\n\nWheal Towan was one of Cornwall's most prolific 18th century copper mines. In 1772, women and girls worked at the mines, earning 4 to 6 d per day. In 1809 Wheal Towan had a cobbing shed which was a building used to break the ore up with a pointed hammer weighing up to 4 pounds. Teenage girls (bal maidens) sat on low benches and broke the ore to remove the rock and break the ore into small pieces. It was a loud and difficult task, but not as difficult as bucking which came next; this required the ore to be broken down into a powder or granules with a flat-ended cast iron hammer. Some time before 1826 the mine resulted in £130,000 profit, having been mined to a depth of 150 fathoms. It was then closed until 1826. Two 80-inch cylinder steam engines called Wilson's engine from the engineer Samuel Grose (1791–1866) were used in 1826 to drain the mine. The monthly output between January 1827 and March 1828 from the engine ranged from 48.9 to 84.2 million 94 pound bushels.\n\nIt was also known as West Wheal Towan (1850–1867), Lelant Wheal Towan and West Wheal Lucy (1872). During the period he owned it, the mine provided Ralph Allen Daniell of Trelissick with a fortune estimated at the time as a \"guinea a minute\". The first underground steam engine was built in Wheal Towan in 1785. It was reopened in 1872 as West Wheal Lucy and abandoned soon after.\n\nThe only remains on the surface are burrows created from the mine's operations. The burrows head in the direction of Towan Cross.\n\nPorthtowan has a Wesleyan chapel.\n\nPorthtowan beach is a family and surfing Blue Flag beach. Designated Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB), along the coast are Gullyn Rock, Diamond Rock and sandstone and slate cliffs. It has more recently become well known as a surf resort and the surf club building. This is where the judges can be found for the annual SAS Rip Curl Cornish and Open Longboard Championship. The beach is kept under the constant scrutiny of the St Agnes based charity Surfers Against Sewage, which was founded in 1990 to improve water quality in Chapel Porth, Porthtowan, and Trevaunance beaches.\n\nThe Unicorn pub is a beachside bar, eaterie, hotel and hostel, which offers live music, dj's and panoramic sunset views.\n\nOverlooking the Porthtowan Beach is the Blue Bar, which has live music or disc jockeys on the weekend.\n\nAn amateur theatre group, Porthtowan Players, formed in 1968, operates from a permanent stage facility within Porthtowan Village Hall. The group puts on a pantomime, musical theatre show, short plays and a youth production each year.\n\nThere is a bus service within Cornwall by a number of operators. The major operators in the Cornwall area are First South West and Hopleys Coaches. Service runs through the village of St Agnes and other towns. Rail service is offered out of Newquay railway station, Redruth railway station, Truro railway station and other western Cornwall municipalities, which is connected with bus service through the Ride Cornwall and Plusbus programs.\n\nFerry service is available to the Isles of Scilly from Penzance; Padstow to Rock; and other locations. Air travel is available through Newquay Cornwall Airport and private jets, charters and helicopters are served by Perranporth Airfield.\n\n\n"}

She is best known in Europe as the winner of the Eurovision Song Contest in 1992 with the song \"Why Me?\", and in Ireland as a member of the 1970s/1980s band, Chips.\n\nMartin is of Irish, Scottish and Italian ancestry. Her family's surname was originally Martini. Her paternal great-grandfather Francis Martini was born in Dublin to immigrants from Saronno near Milan, Italy. Martin's maternal great-grandparents, William Green and Elizabeth Nangle had a coal-mining background; they had transferred to Belfast from Larkhall, Scotland.\n\nMartin started off her musical career when she joined the band Chips in Omagh in 1969. They quickly became one of the top bands in Ireland on the live circuit and released hit singles \"Love Matters\", \"Twice a Week\" and \"Goodbye Goodbye\" during the mid to late 1970s. In 1972, Martin broke away from Chips to be a vocalist with new band Lyttle People, but rejoined Chips the following year.\n\nThe group appeared on \"Opportunity Knocks\" in 1974 and appeared a number of times on British television promoting their singles, but never scored a UK hit. With multiple entries to the Irish National finals of the \"Eurovision Song Contest\", the band carried on into the 1980s. They scored a final Irish hit in 1982 with \"David's Song\", after which Martin broke away when she won the \"Castlebar Song Contest\" with \"Edge of the Universe\" in 1983. From this point she concentrated on a solo career as well as occasional live appearances with Chips until they recruited a new lead singer (Valerie Roe) in the late 1980s.\n\nShe participated in the National Song Contest four times as a member of Chips, however they did not score successfully. She participated another four times in the contest as a soloist and once more as part of the group \"Linda Martin and Friends\". With nine participations, she has been the most frequent entrant in the National Song Contest's history. She won the contest twice, going on to represent Ireland twice at the Eurovision Song Contest.\n\nThe first of these victories was in 1984 with the song \"Terminal 3\", written by Johnny Logan (under his real name Séan Sherrard). The song came 2nd in the final, being beaten by 8 points. \"Terminal 3\" reached No.7 in the Irish charts. The second victory was in 1992 when her song \"Why Me\" (also written by Logan) went on to win the final in Sweden. This became Ireland's 4th victory in the Eurovision Song Contest and the song reached No.1 in the Irish charts as well as becoming a hit in many European countries.\n\nMartin was, at the time, one of only three artists to finish both first and second at Eurovision, behind Lys Assia and Gigliola Cinquetti. Since then, only Elisabeth Andreassen and Dima Bilan have achieved this, raising the number to five. Martin was the first of the three artists to finish second first and first second, matched only later by Bilan.\nShe has presented the RTÉ quiz show \"The Lyrics Board\", one of the broadcaster's more popular formats. She served as one of Louis Walsh's behind-the-scenes team on the first series of ITV's \"The X Factor\".\n\nShe also served as a judge on the first, second and fourth seasons of RTÉ's \"You're a Star\" and on \"Charity You're a Star\" in Summer 2005 and Summer 2006. She was dismissed from the 2007 season, however, speaking on \"Saturday Night with Miriam\" on RTÉ television on 28 July 2007, she insisted that she was \"open\" to being invited back on to the show. Martin has not ruled out a return to Eurovision following Ireland's dismal performance in the 2007 contest finishing last with only five points.\n\nShe was a guest performer at \"Congratulations\", the 50th anniversary Eurovision concert in Copenhagen, Denmark, in October 2005. Martin was also the Irish spokesperson for Eurovision Song Contest 2007 and was one of the five judges for Eurosong 2009 (Irish Selection for Eurovision). In 2012, she was the mentor for Jedward in the Irish Eurovision final \"Eurosong 2012\".\n\nDuring the interval of Eurovision 2013 the host Petra Mede presented a light hearted history of the contest, during which she explained to viewers that Johnny Logan had won the competition three times, in 1980, 1987 and 1992. Appearing alongside Linda Martin in some vintage footage she joked that he had won the third time disguised as a woman, saying, \"I recognise a drag queen when I see one\". The joke proved controversial, particularly in the Irish media. However, on 1 June 2013, during an appearance on RTÉ's \"The Saturday Night Show\" Martin claimed that she had actually benefited from all the publicity. On the same show she performed a cover of the song \"Get Lucky\" by Daft Punk.\n\nMartin has also appeared in pantomime, in Dublin. She starred in \"Cinderella\" as the Wicked Stepmother, \"Snow White\" as the Evil Queen and \"Robin Hood\" as herself, at the Olympia Theatre.\n\nShe toured \"Menopause the Musical\" with Irish entertainer Twink. While on tour, Twink described Martin as a \"cunt\" during a tirade in May 2010.

He was one of approximately 75 dissidents arrested, tried and convicted in 2003 as part of a crackdown by the Cuban government nicknamed the \"Black Spring\". He was given a twenty-year sentence on a charge of \"activities against the integrity and sovereignty of the State\", causing Amnesty International to declare him as a prisoner of conscience.\n\nEspinosa was a graduate of the University of Havana, where he received a degree in economics. He served on Prime Minister Fidel Castro's Economic Advisory Group from 1965 to 1968 before spending fourteen years as the economic adviser at the Cuban embassy in Belgrade, overseeing Cuba's economic and technological cooperation with Hungary, Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia. In 1984, he returned to Cuba to work at the National Bank, where he was responsible for trade and tourism.\n\nHowever, throughout the 1980s, Espinosa increasingly disagreed with national economic policy. When he discussed his views with a colleague in 1992, he was demoted, and four years later was fired. Espinosa began to write critiques of Cuban economic policy which he published overseas. He also hosted a radio program titled \"Charlando con Chepe\" (\"Chatting with Chepe\") in which he discussed the Cuban economy; the program was carried on the U.S.-funded station Radio Martí.\n\nEspinosa was married to independent Cuban journalist Miriam Leiva.\n\nOn March 19, 2003, Espinosa was arrested during the Black Spring after security agents reportedly spent 10 hours searching his apartment. At a trial on April 3, 2003, Espinosa was accused of \"activities against the integrity and sovereignty of the State\". Authorities stated that Espinosa had received money from the U.S. government, and that \nUS$13,600 had been discovered sewn into one of his jackets. Espinosa was subsequently convicted and sentenced to 20 years in prison. He was one of approximately 75 dissidents arrested and tried.\n\nFollowing a rejected appeal by Espinosa, the Representative of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, Christine Chanet, appealed to President Castro to pardon him. The administration of U.S. President George W. Bush appealed to Castro on Espinosa's behalf, calling on the government to provide treatment for his liver disease. A spokesman described the Cuban government as \"going out of its way\" to be inhumane to its prisoners. Espinosa's wife Leiva reported that he had lost forty pounds since his arrest and was kept in a cell with no windows or running water.\n\nLeiva became active in the Ladies in White, a group of wives of political prisoners which marched through Havana each Sunday protesting their husbands' detention. She continued to march even after Espinosa's early release.\n\nEspinosa was released from prison along with fellow writer Raúl Rivero on November 29, 2004, after serving just over 19 months of his prison sentence; It was his sixty-fourth birthday. The authorities granted him medical parole because his already poor health had declined seriously during his incarceration.\n\nAfter his release, he called on the government to release the remaining Black Spring prisoners, stating, \"The government really committed a very big error with us. We are completely peaceful and we want only the reconciliation of Cuban society.\"\n\nIn 2006, Espinosa stated his opposition to U.S. funding for the Cuban dissident movement, calling it \"counterproductive\" and stating that the Cuban people must solve its own problems. Following Raúl Castro's assumption of the presidency, Espinosa expressed his hope that Castro could be the Deng Xiaoping of Cuba, improving the economy and the standard of living.\n\nHe died of liver disease on September 23, 2013, in Spain.\n"}

For example, the functional flow block diagram is a combination of the functional block diagram and the flow chart.

The film stars Jodie Foster, David Niven, Helen Hayes (in her last film role), and Leo McKern. The film follows an orphan who aims to assist a couple of con-men who attempt to steal an old woman's inheritance money, but instead tries to save the woman's estate.\n\nCon-artist Harry Bundage (McKern) believes that the lost treasure of pirate captain Joshua St. Edmund is hidden at Candleshoe, the large country estate of Lady St. Edmund (Hayes). Having gained access to Captain St. Edmund's hidden will with the help of his cousin Clara (Pickles), a corrupt former cleaning woman at Candleshoe, Harry recruits American Casey Brown (Foster)—an unwanted foster child and hooligan—into the plot, employing her to pose as Lady St. Edmund's granddaughter, the Honourable Margaret, 4th Marchioness of Candleshoe, who was kidnapped at age four by her father and subsequently disappeared after her father's death. Casey is the right age to pass for Margaret and possesses several identifying scars that young Margaret was known to have. Casey agrees to go along with the con and discover further clues in exchange for a cut of the treasure.\n\nLady St. Edmund, however, is living in genteel poverty, and Casey quickly learns that Candleshoe itself is constantly on the verge of being unable to pay its taxes. Priory (Niven), the estate's butler (who is forced to pose as various members of the household to conceal that all the other servants have been let go) manages to keep one step ahead of foreclosure by pawning the house's antiques, conducting tours of the estate, and selling produce at market. Four local orphans adopted by Lady St. Edmund assist Priory.\n\nCasey eventually becomes part of the family and decides to find the treasure for the benefit of Candleshoe, rather than for Harry. This nearly costs the girl her life when she is seriously injured trying to prevent Harry from stealing money from Lady St. Edmund. Casey, now unconscious with a severe concussion, is taken to a hospital, and remains there for several days. Meanwhile, without the money Harry has stolen, Candleshoe is unable to pay its taxes and is within days of foreclosure. When Casey learns that Lady St. Edmund is preparing to go to a retirement home and send the children back to the orphanage, she breaks down and tells them about the treasure. After unraveling the final clue together, the household returns to Candleshoe to find Harry and his crew tearing the place apart to find the hidden treasure. Casey, Priory, and the children manage to fight off the thieves until the police arrive, inadvertently discovering the treasure in the process.\n\nWith Candleshoe safe and her scheme discovered, Casey, feeling she has no right to stay, prepares to return to Los Angeles, but is stopped by Lady St. Edmund, who offers her a real home at Candleshoe. Casey expresses doubt, wondering what will happen if Lady St. Edmund's real granddaughter ever returns, but she is eventually persuaded to return to Candleshoe with Lady St. Edmund. The ending is ambiguous as to whether Casey truly is the real Margaret.\n\nThe four clues revealed in the hunt for the treasure:\n\nCompton Wynyates, in Warwickshire, the home of Spencer, 7th Marquess of Northampton, posed as the fictional estate of Candleshoe.\n\nThe Severn Valley Railway that runs between the midland towns of Bridgnorth and Kidderminister in the United Kingdom was used as a location in the film.\n\n\nOn September 15, 2015, Intrada Records released a special edition of the soundtrack containing the entire score from the film plus bonus material, including alternate takes of some tracks.\n\n\n"}

He is best known for his appearances with Total Nonstop Action Wrestling, where he was known by his ring name Trytan.\n\nWilson joined Total Nonstop Action Wrestling in September 2003 as one-half of a heel tag team, Redshirt Security, with Kevin Northcutt. Northcutt and Wilson were corrupt, physically imposing security guards (who wore red t-shirts) loyal to Don Callis and Jeff Jarrett, and regularly butt heads with the diminutive face \"Blackshirt Security\" (Chris Vaughn and Rick Santel). After Redshirt Security was expanded to three members with the addition of Legend in November 2003, the trio began feuding with the rebels who opposed the administration of Jarrett and Callis, namely Erik Watts, The Sandman, and Raven. This led to a six-man Clockwork Orange House of Fun match on November 19, in which Wilson suffered a broken arm. In 2004, he was fired for steroid abuse and was replaced by Legend.\n\nWilson returned to TNA one year later as Titus, the bodyguard of Jonny Fairplay. The gimmick was never televised, although Wilson made several dark match appearances, including a victory over Dallas on November 19. Fairplay was not employed by TNA on a regular basis, and the Titus character was eventually discarded.\n\nIn early 2005, video packages were aired hyping the debut of Wilson's latest gimmick, Trytan. The Trytan gimmick had aspects similar to The Terminator, including wearing black leather attire, sunglasses and even utilizing the character's classic mannerisms. Even his finisher, a fireman's carry facebuster was dubbed the T-3, the shortened name of \"\", and a take-off of Brock Lesnar's F-5. Wilson began stalking Monty Brown, and would disrupt his matches, extending a hand towards Brown from the entranceway. On March 13, Brown and Trytan faced off at Destination X. Brown eventually gained the upper hand over Trytan, but as he prepared to hit his signature Pounce finisher, the arena lights went out. When the lighting was restored, a masked man was in the ring in place of Wilson. Brown Pounced and pinned the masked man and was awarded the victory, although he had been unable to gain a victory over Wilson. The masked man was later identified as Mideon, but was never properly included in the storyline.\n\nWilson's push was virtually halted following his match at Destination X. He wrestled sporadically for TNA until May 2005, when he was placed in a tag team with Simon Diamond. Diamond and Trytan appeared at Slammiversary on June 19, defeating Apolo and Sonny Siaki in a tag team match. Wilson left TNA the following month when his contract expired and was not renewed.\n\nOn November 14, 2005, Wilson signed a contract with World Wrestling Entertainment. He was assigned to the WWE developmental territory Ohio Valley Wrestling. He originally went by the name \"Tytus\", making his debut at the January 18, 2006 OVW TV show by coming out alongside Da Beast. At the July 25 SmackDown!/ECW tapings, he defeated Funaki in a dark match.\n\nHe then began wrestling in OVW under the ring name Jacob Duncan, a gimmick which saw him dress as a woodsman wearing a mask similar in design to the one Mick Foley wore as Mankind. He also spoke to his \"momma\" about getting his revenge on those who made fun of him growing up, indicating a sign of storyline psychosis.\n\nAfter a match, Jacob was confronted in the ring by The Boogeyman and began a short feud with him. On August 23, Boogeyman unmasked Duncan to reveal his identity. At OVW's 400th anniversary show, Duncan defeated The Boogeyman in a tables match to end their feud. On October 25, 2006, Duncan won the OVW Heavyweight Championship from Chet the Jett in an impromptu title match. On December 15, Duncan dropped the title to Chet. In early 2007, Duncan began feuding with Dan Rodman over the interest of Beth Phoenix, resulting in a \"love triangle\". After the feud ended, Phoenix continued to manage Duncan in OVW before she made her last appearance in OVW on August 15, where she lost to Katie Lea in a number one contenders match for the OVW Women's Championship and then joined the main World Wrestling Entertainment roster full-time. On November 8, 2007, Wilson was released from his WWE developmental contract. On November 1, 2008, Wilson, reusing his Jacob Duncan gimmick, returned to OVW for one night only to cause a surprise attack on Anthony Bravado.\n\n\n"}

She sang \"In Your Eyes\" to clinch a second consecutive win for Ireland in the Eurovision Song Contest.\n\nThe singer represented Ireland again in the Eurovision Song Contest 2010 in Oslo, with the song \"It's for You\". She performed at the semi-final on 27 May 2010, finishing 9th in a field of 17 contestants, thus qualifying for the Grand Final on 29 May 2010. In the final, she finished 23rd in a field of 25 contestants, having received 25 points.\n\nKavanagh is highly regarded among fans of the Eurovision Song Contest, and the OGAE Ireland (official Eurovision fan club) president, Diarmuid Furlong, said: \"A lot of us would regard Niamh as one of the best vocalists who's ever won the Eurovision Song Contest\". While she has enjoyed success in Europe Kavanagh remains relatively unknown in the United States. However, the singer recorded an album in that country following her initial Eurovision success.\n\nKavanagh was born in Glasnevin, Dublin, Ireland. Her father was a singer and a saxophonist. She often sang songs at family parties as a child. Her influences include Aretha Franklin, Ella Fitzgerald and Blood, Sweat and Tears, all of whom she listened to from a young age, as well as Bonnie Raitt.\n\nKavanagh performed as a lead and backing vocalist on the film soundtrack for \"The Commitments\" in songs such as \"Destination Anywhere\" and \"Do Right Woman, Do Right Man\".\n\nIn spite of this, Kavanagh was not prepared for the boost in recognition she received for her later entries in the Eurovision Song Contest.\n\nOn 14 March 1993, twenty-five-year-old Kavanagh performed in RTÉ's \"National Song Contest\", which selected the Irish entry for the larger Eurovision Song Contest, to be held in Millstreet, County Cork, later that spring. Opening the show at Dublin's Point Theatre, Kavanagh performed \"In Your Eyes\" (lyrics and music by Jimmy Walsh). At the close of voting, Kavanagh handily won the \"National Song Contest\" with 118 points from the ten regional juries, a 39-point margin over the runner-up. This win meant Kavanagh and \"In Your Eyes\" would go on to represent Ireland on the Eurovision stage in Millstreet.\n\nAt the Eurovision on 15 May, Kananagh performed \"In Your Eyes\" near the middle of the show, as the fourteenth act out of twenty-five. This time, the voting was much closer, and Ireland exchanged the leading position with the United Kingdom several times throughout the announcement of the results. With 187 points (a record at the time), Kavanagh went on to win the competition in a nail-biting finish, as the result was decided by the final maximum score awarded by the last country to vote. \"In Your Eyes\" went on to be the best-selling single in Republic of Ireland for 1993, and reached number 24 in the UK Singles Chart. It went on to become a double-platinum success and Kavanagh was recognised by people on the street. She recorded an album in Nashville, Tennessee, United States, and this album was produced by John Jennings. She later left music to spend more time with her children.\n\nKavanagh was again representing Ireland in the Eurovision Song Contest 2010, with the song \"It's for You\". The contest was held in Oslo, Norway in May 2010 (semi-final: 27 May 2010; final: 29 May 2010). \"It's for You\" was written by Niall Mooney, Marten Eriksson, Lina Eriksson and Jonas Gladnikoff. Kavanagh performed \"It's for You\" in Oslo alongside her cousin, Niamh Kavanagh, a whistle player, and Nikki Kavanagh, a singer.\n\nKavanagh's possible participation in Eurovision Song Contest 2010 was confirmed on 10 February 2010 when Ireland's public service broadcaster, Raidió Teilifís Éireann (RTÉ), announced the five finalists for Eurosong 2010, the national final to determine entry. The national final occurred during season 48 of \"The Late Late Show\" on 5 March. Kavanagh scored maximum points to beat four other participants.\nAccording to \"The Irish Times\", Kavanagh received \"enormous support\" from journalists and spectators in Oslo, and was much sought after ahead of the event. At the semi-final stage on 27 May 2010 she – along with the other members of the Irish act – qualified for the final, held on Saturday 29 May 2010. Performing 12th on the night, it was the first time in four years that Ireland qualified for the final. The song was the 10th to be performed during the final. At the end of the Eurovision Niamh Kavanagh scored a total of 25 points for Ireland bringing them to 23rd (3rd last) on the leaderboard in front of Belarus and the United Kingdom.\n\nOn Sunday 3 September 2000, Kavanagh performed at the homecoming ceremony for \"the quiet man of the \"Big Brother\" household\", Thomas \"Tom\" McDermott, from Greencastle, County Tyrone, who had just been evicted from the first ever series of the British version of \"Big Brother\" the previous week.\n\nKavanagh appeared on \"The Late Late Show\"s Eurovision edition in 2006, to perform \"In Your Eyes\" along with Linda Martin, and other past Irish Eurovision contestants.\n\nKavanagh was the Irish spokesperson at the Eurovision Song Contest 2008.\n\nOn the New Year's Eve she took part in the Romanian National Final for the Eurovision Song Contest 2011 where she performed her 2010 entry in the Contest and the ABBA hit \"Happy New Year\", alongside Chiara Siracusa and Paula Seling.\n\nIn 2015, Kavanagh was a judge in Irish national final to Junior Eurovision Song Contest 2015\n\nIn 2018, Kavanagh took part in the music video for the Irish entrant for Junior Eurovision Song Contest 2018, \"IOU\" performed by Taylor Hynes. She portrayed the mother character, while 2018 Eurovision entrant Ryan O'Shaughnessy portrayed the father character.\n\nKavanagh is married to her musician husband, Paul Megahey, from Carrickfergus, County Antrim, Northern Ireland, whom she first encountered in a recording studio. The couple have two sons, Jack and Tom, and have lived in Carrickfergus for 11 years. Kavanagh once planned to move to the United States to live there, but changed her mind following her success in the Eurovision Song Contest.

They are currently members of the and play at Woodhorn Lane.\n\nFormed in 1883, the club have played in a number of local and regional leagues, including the Northern Alliance, the East Northumberland League, the North Eastern League, the Midland League, Wearside League and the North Regional League. They were a founding member of the Football League Third Division North in 1921 and are the northernmost team to have played in the Football League. The club were later founder members of the Northern Premier League in 1968 and have been in the Northern League since 1970.\n\nThe club was established in 1883 and began entering the FA Cup in 1887. They joined the Northern Alliance at the start of the 1892–93 season when the league was expanded to twelve clubs. However, the league was reduced to ten club the following season, and as they had finished in the bottom two, Ashington were asked to leave. The club then ceased activities, but were brought back following a large meeting, joining the East Northumberland League in 1895. They went on to win the league title in 1897–98.\n\nAshington applied to rejoin the Northern Alliance in 1901, but were rejected. However, the following season they were elected back into the league, finishing second in the vote to admit three clubs. They won the league in 1913–14 and moved up to the North Eastern League. When football resumed after World War I the club rejoined the North Eastern League, where they remained until being elected into the new Third Division North of the Football League in 1921. After all the applications had been considered by the League, Ashington were one of fourteen clubs marked out for admission in a single bloc, which they duly were. In 1926–27 the club recorded its best performance in the FA Cup, reaching the third round, where they lost 2–0 at home to Nottingham Forest. After finishing bottom of the division in 1928–29 the club lost their bid for re-election, receiving only 14 votes to the 24 received by non-League York City.\n\nAshington subsequently dropped into Division Two of the North Eastern League as Division One had no spaces. With only two clubs eligible for promotion, Ashington appeared to have missed out after finishing third. However, runners-up White-le-Head declined the opportunity of promotion, allowing Ashington to move up to Division One. Five years later the league was reduced to a single division, where they remained until the league folded in 1958 due to the resignation of the Football League clubs' reserve teams, unsuccessfully applying for election to the Football League in 1947 (when no vote took place) and 1950 (when they received no votes).\n\nAlongside several other former North Eastern League clubs, Ashington switched to the Midland League. In 1960 they were founder members of the Northern Counties League, finishing as runners-up in its first season. The North Eastern League was re-established in 1962, but lasted only two seasons. Ashington spent the 1964–65 season in the Wearside League before joining the North Regional League, which was largely composed of Football League reserve teams. They remained in the league for three seasons, before becoming founder members of the Northern Premier League in 1968. In the first season of the league, the club finished third-from-bottom and resigned due to the costs of being in the league. They spent a single season back in the Northern Alliance, before joining the Northern League in 1970. In 1973–74 they reached the semi-finals of the last-ever FA Amateur Cup, losing 3–0 to eventual winners Bishop's Stortford in a replay.\n\nIn 1981 a second division was added to the league, with Ashington remaining in Division One. However, after finishing second-from-bottom in 1983–84 they were relegated to Division Two. In 2000–01 they won Division Two, earning promotion to Division One. However, they spent only a single season in Division One before being relegated back to Division Two. After finishing fifth in 2002–03, they won Division Two again in 2003–04 and were promoted back to Division One. In 2012–13 they won the Northumberland Senior Cup for the tenth time with a 3–0 win over Whitley Bay.\n\nAshington's colours are black and white vertical stripes, used on the shirt and paired with black shorts and black socks for home matches. While away, they use an all light blue shirt and socks with white shorts.\n\nThe Ashington AFC badge has two lions flanking a badge with a stylised AFC logo, with a football between the legs of the A. \n\nAshington moved a new ground named Station Road in 1909, which was renamed Portland Park in 1914. They played at Portland Park during their Football League years, with the club's first Football League match attracting a crowd of 9,000. They remained at Portland Park after dropping out of the league, with the club's record attendance of 13,199 coming for an FA Cup second round tie with Rochdale on 9 December 1950.\n\nIn 2008 the club left Portland Park to move to Woodhorn Lane. The final match was played at the old ground in February 2008 against Seaham Red Star, attracting a crowd of 1,954. The first game at Woodhorn Lane took place on 30 August 2008 against Ossett Albion, with 341 spectators watching a 2–1 win for Ashington in an FA Cup preliminary round game.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Many authorities call it a domestic form of the white-rumped munia (known in aviculture as the striated finch), at least probably, though some state that it originated as a hybrid of this species with others in the genus \"Lonchura\". A DNA study found that it was more closely related to the white-rumped munia but not belonged to Indian muniya family than either bird is to the finch, the chestnut-breasted munia, or the \"Silver Bill\" (presumably the silverbill), indicating that it originated from the white-rumped.\n\nBengalese finches are well adapted to captivity and the company of humans. They breed well and are good foster parents for other finch-like birds.\n\nWhile two males may not get along without other company, it has been found the best \"pairing\" for fostering is to use two males, this works better than either two females or a male and female pairing. Two males will usually accept eggs or even partly grown young without any hesitation.\n\nThese birds like to be close together and tend to all roost in one nest if kept in a group. In an aviary they lay eggs and crowd into a single nest, interfering with incubation (which is performed by the female and lasts 16 days) or damaging the eggs. Thus they breed better if kept as single pairs in individual breeding boxes. This sociability is also responsible for their American name of \"society finch.\"\n\nBengalese finches are quite easy to look after. They are also quite easy to breed provided they are properly sexed. Obtaining a female-male pair can present a difficulty because both sexes look similar. However, it is possible to determine gender by behavior since males tend to display to females. One method to sex Bengalese is to place a single bird in a small cage completely isolated it from its own kind (both sight and hearing) and after several hours then introduce another Bengalese to the cage. If the first bird is a male, it will immediately display to the newcomer. Unfortunately, this does not necessarily mean the introduced bird is a female. But if the first bird does not display it is almost certainly a hen. Also, Society Finches can be housed with other finches including other societies, Zebra Finches, Gouldian Finches, and Spice Finches.\n\nThey are generally given a diet of seeds, such as millets and canary seed, and greens. They will not usually take live-foods, but it has been found they will often accept housefly pupae, which they crack like seeds. This is particularly useful if they are being used to foster species that require a high protein component to be successfully reared.\n\nSociety finches have been used extensively in research on imprinting and on bird vocalizations, often comparing the structure of their songs to syntax.\n\n"}

Founded in 1941 by William Cardinal O'Connell, Archbishop of Boston, the school is named after Saint Sebastian, the Christian martyr who survived an attempted execution by arrows. It is the only Catholic school in the Independent School League. Approximately 350 students are enrolled, with 25% receiving financial aid. Since 1990, the School headmaster is Mr. William L. Burke III.\n\nThe School features an academic program focusing on the liberal arts and offers Spanish and Classics courses. Writing is emphasized with numerous courses in the English curriculum, with Freshmen (9th grade) students taking a special class to hone their skills. Public speaking is also a focus of the academic program, with each student required to deliver an annual speech during his class's weekly chapel meetings.\n\nThe student to teacher ratio at St. Sebastian's is 7:1. The average class size is 10. The school offers 20 classes at the Advanced Placement level. Students are assigned a faculty advisor, and at the end of every quarter, awards for honors students are presented before the school.\n\nSt. Sebastian's has a competitive athletic program, with 11 varsity sports, and 35 teams in total. Its school colors are red and black, and teams are known as the Arrows. Over the years the Arrows have had an intense rivalry with the Belmont Hill School. St. Sebastian's School is a member of the prestigious Independent School League.\n\nThe school has one of the top ice hockey programs in the United States, dating to its founding in 1941. The school regularly produces picks in the NHL Entry Draft. In June 2003, the school was tied for the most first round picks from a single high school, ever, at four. St. Sebastian's now has five first round picks after Noah Hanifin was chosen fifth overall in 2015. The team is coached by Sean McCann, a former Harvard assistant coach and captain, and also a Hobey Baker finalist.\n\nThe campus rink, the Henry T. Lane Rink, is named in honor of Henry Lane who served the school for over 40 years, first as the Varsity Hockey coach and later the Athletic Director. Lane was also a graduate of St. Sebastian's in the class of 1949.\n\nSt. Sebastian's has had great success in recent years with lacrosse, winning ISL Championships in 2012, 2017 and 2019. The School's sailing team was also ranked seventh in the country in 2001. Additionally, the St. Sebastian's varsity golf team achieved back to back undefeated seasons in addition to back to back ISL Championship Victories in 2009 and 2010. \n\nFurthermore, in its 2012 season, St. Sebastian's football team recorded an undefeated record of 9–0, capturing the ISL championship, as well as the NEPSAC championship, becoming the first team in the school's history to have an undefeated season while also winning a bowl game. They won another bowl game in 2015 defeating New Hampton School by a score of 82–50. They won another ISL Championship in 2018. \n\nAlso in 2017, the varsity baseball team won its first ISL Championship in ten years and managed to successfully defend its title a year later in 2018. The golf team recently capped off another championship season, for a record-breaking four ISL Championships in a row from 2016 to 2019.\n\nThe varsity lacrosse team also won the ISL Championship in 2017. After being ranked as high as #8 in the national rankings, the team was invited to the first annual Geico High School Lacrosse Nationals hosted by Catholic University and broadcast on ESPN. The Arrows took down St. Anne's-Belfield School with a final score of 21-8 and then lost 10-12 to The Hill Academy (Ontario, Canada). They were invited back to the tournament the following two seasons, losing both times in the first round to The Hill Academy and Salisbury School respectively.\n\nAfter falling just short of another ISL Championship in 2018, the Arrows completed the program's first perfect season in 2019, winning yet another ISL Championship.\n\nSt. Sebastian's has 6 student publications and 33 different clubs and activities.\nThe school newspaper, \"The Walrus\", is published monthly. The school's debate team competes among private secondary schools in New England. Other student groups manage \"The Arrow\", the school yearbook, as well as \"The Quiver\", a creative literary magazine, and \"The St. Sebastian's Journal\", a collection of student-written scholarly essays. Other students run the school's closed-circuit television network, perform community service (The Arrow Club and Labels Are For Jars), perform in dramatic productions, compete in such activities as chess, robotics, support students of color (MPA), and advocate against destructive decisions such as drug and alcohol abuse (SADD).\n\nThe Guild is the school's association for the mothers of students, rather like the PTA. Founded in 1949, the Guild works for the enhancement of St. Sebastian's School through social events, fund-raising, and volunteer activities. It is named after St. Irene, who befriended and healed St. Sebastian.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2226049", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2226049", "title": "John McNamara (baseball)", "text": "John McNamara (baseball)\n\nJohn Francis McNamara (born June 4, 1932) is a retired American professional baseball manager, coach and player. After spending over 15 years in the minor leagues as a player and player-manager, McNamara helmed six Major League Baseball (MLB) teams for all or parts of 19 seasons between and . He directed the Boston Red Sox to the American League pennant, and was named his league's \"Manager of the Year\" by both the BBWAA and The Sporting News. However, the Red Sox were defeated by the New York Mets in seven games in the 1986 World Series when they failed to hold a two-run, two-out, two-strike lead in Game 6, and a three-run advantage in Game 7.\n\nMcNamara was born in Sacramento, where he attended Christian Brothers High School. At Sacramento City College, he led his team to the 1951 California state championship and later was inducted to the SCC Athletic Hall of Fame. A right-handed batter and thrower who stood tall and weighed , in his playing days he was a peripatetic, weak-hitting catcher, originally signing with the St. Louis Cardinals organization in 1951. He rose as high as the Open-Classification Pacific Coast League during 1956 as a member of his hometown Solons, but he hit only .171 in 76 games played.\n\nHe began his managing career with the Lewis-Clark Broncs in Lewiston, Idaho, of the Class B Northwest League in 1959, and when the club became an affiliate of the Kansas City Athletics in 1960, McNamara joined the Athletics' system. He won Southern League pennants with the Birmingham Barons, the A's Double-A affiliate, in 1966 and 1967 and groomed many future members of the Oakland Athletics' early-1970s dynasty (Baseball Hall of Famers Rollie Fingers and Reggie Jackson, as well as Sal Bando, Blue Moon Odom, Joe Rudi and others) during his tenure as the organization's Double-A manager. At the same time, McNamara also mentored future Hall of Fame manager (then an infielder) Tony LaRussa and future pitching coach (then catcher) Dave Duncan. Jackson, in particular, credits McNamara with helping him through his time with Birmingham, with the racial tensions that existed in the Deep South at the time.\n\nHe then served as a coach at the major-league level for Oakland from through September 18, 1969. On that day, A's owner Charlie Finley fired manager Hank Bauer and promoted McNamara, then 37, to succeed him. The Athletics were in second place in the American League West Division, nine games in arrears of the Minnesota Twins. They went 8–5 under McNamara for the rest of the campaign, then finished second to the Twins again in with an 89–73 mark. Finley replaced him with Dick Williams at season's end, and the A's would go on to win five successive division titles and three straight American League pennants and World Series titles under Williams and Alvin Dark. On the strength of his back-to-back world championships in 1972–73, Williams was elected to the Hall of Fame as a manager.\n\nMcNamara returned to the coaching ranks from 1971–73 with the cross-bay San Francisco Giants before he took over the struggling San Diego Padres as their manager in . The Padres improved incrementally, winning 60, 71 and 73 games through , then signed free agents Fingers and Gene Tenace away from McNamara's old team, the A's. Expected to dramatically improve in , instead the Padres stood at only 20–28 on May 28, when McNamara was fired and replaced by Dark. He spent as a coach for the California Angels, then was hired to succeed Sparky Anderson, also a future Hall of Fame manager, as skipper of the Cincinnati Reds.\n\nThe Reds had finished second to the Los Angeles Dodgers for two consecutive seasons in the National League West Division, and Anderson had been fired amid controversy, reportedly because he refused his front office's order to fire members of his coaching staff.\n\nMcNamara's Reds, minus legend Pete Rose, who had defected to the Philadelphia Phillies as a free agent, won 90 games—two fewer than Anderson's 1978 team. But they edged the Houston Astros by 1 games to win the NL West and became McNamara's first postseason entry. In the 1979 National League Championship Series, however, the Reds dropped the first two games at home in extra innings to the Pittsburgh Pirates, then were swept out of the playoffs in Game 3. Pittsburgh went on to win the 1979 World Series. McNamara's Reds won 89 games but finished third, 3 lengths behind Houston. Then came Cincinnati's frustrating season: the Reds compiled the best overall record in the National League West (66–42, .611), but the split-season format adopted because of the 1981 Major League Baseball strike denied them a place in the playoffs because they finished second (initially to the Dodgers, then to the Astros) in each half-season. The 1981 campaign became all the more distressing because the Reds unraveled, losing 58 of their first 92 games, falling into the division basement. On July 20, 1982, McNamara was fired with Cincinnati 23 games out of first place.\n\nBuzzie Bavasi had been the president of the Padres when McNamara became their manager in 1974, and had moved to the California Angels after the 1977 season as general manager. Along with then-manager Dave Garcia, he had hired McNamara as an Angel coach in 1978, before the Reds' job opened up. After the season, when the Angels lost a heart-breaking ALCS to the Milwaukee Brewers, their veteran manager, Gene Mauch, resigned. Bavasi then hired McNamara a third time, this time as skipper of the Angels. But that team dropped precipitously in the standings, winning only 70 games—23 fewer than in 1982—and finishing 29 lengths behind the Chicago White Sox. The following year, the Angels clawed back to .500 at 81–81 but came within three games of the division champion Kansas City Royals, who won only 84 contests all season.\n\nWhen Ralph Houk, 65, retired as Boston's manager at the close of the 1984 season, the Red Sox approached the Angels about McNamara's availability for the opening; he and Haywood Sullivan, the Red Sox' chief executive officer and co-owner, had managed together in the Athletics' organization in the mid-1960s. With Mauch ready to return to the dugout, the Angels agreed to let McNamara go to Boston, and in , he led the Red Sox to another .500 season; but at 81–81, they finished 18 games behind the Toronto Blue Jays in the American League East Division.\n\nHowever, would be a different story. With fireballing Roger Clemens winning his first 14 decisions en route to the Cy Young Award and American League Most Valuable Player Award, the Red Sox won 95 games and captured the division title, setting the stage for McNamara's second and final postseason appearance as a manager. First they battled back from a three-games-to-one deficit to defeat Mauch's Angels in the 1986 American League Championship Series, reaching the World Series against the National League champion New York Mets.\n\nMcNamara's managerial tactics during the 1986 World Series (especially in the last two games) received much criticism and scrutiny. In the pivotal sixth game, McNamara removed Red Sox ace Roger Clemens in the eighth inning despite the fact that Clemens was still pitching well. Both parties have different stories regarding Clemens's departure. According to Clemens, he did not want to leave the game, but McNamara insisted that Clemens asked to be taken out because he had a blister on his pitching hand. McNamara was also criticized for pinch-hitting Clemens with rookie Mike Greenwell, who struck out on three pitches, when veteran slugger Don Baylor was also available. McNamara's move was further questioned in light of the relatively poor performances of closer Calvin Schiraldi and longtime reliever Bob Stanley, especially considering that he brought Schiraldi into the game for what was supposed to be a two-inning save and left him in the game for the first two outs of the tenth after he blew the save.\n\nYet, perhaps the decision that McNamara will be most remembered for is his leaving first baseman Bill Buckner in the game in the 10th inning rather than removing him for a defensive substitute. McNamara was ridiculed for years afterward for leaving Buckner on the field instead of replacing him with Dave Stapleton, who had previously been used to replace Buckner in late innings for defensive purposes (including Games 1 and 5 of the World Series). He later said, \"I felt Buckner deserved to be on the field when we won.\" The Red Sox players also believed that their manager let sentiment overpower his judgement. Stapleton claimed that \"[McNamara] damn well knows that he messed up. And he very well could have cost us the World Series that year.\" McNamara finally responded to Stapleton's attack in 2011 during an interview with Bob Costas for MLB Network, reneging on his original claim that sentiment was what caused him to keep Buckner in the game and saying that Stapleton had the nickname of \"Shaky\" because of his poor defense.\n\nWith Game 7 delayed a day due to rain in New York, McNamara bumped originally-scheduled starting pitcher Oil Can Boyd in favor of starting Bruce Hurst, the winner of Games 1 and 5 and the presumptive MVP of the series if the Red Sox were to win, on three days' rest; the Red Sox had chosen to go with a normal four-man rotation during the series, unlike the Mets who pitched a three-man rotation. The decision upset Boyd so much that he began drinking heavily afterward and drank himself to the point of intoxication, according to accounts given by McNamara and his pitching coach Bill Fischer, thus rendering him unavailable.\n\nHurst was staked to a 3-0 lead and pitched shutout ball for five innings, but tired in the sixth allowing the Mets to score three runs to tie the game. Since Boyd's actions had left the bullpen shortstaffed in a situation where every pitcher able would need to be available in case of an emergency, McNamara decided to bring Calvin Schiraldi in despite his struggles in Game 6 and the fact that he was still tired from pitching 2.2 innings that night (something he wasn't used to). Schiraldi gave up a tie-breaking home run to Ray Knight, the first batter he faced, and ended up surrendering three runs while recording only a single out. The Red Sox would lose the game 8-5, thus losing the series.\n\nMcNamara's Red Sox not only failed to repeat as divisional or league champions, they failed to reach .500: at 78 wins, they finished 20 games behind the Detroit Tigers. McNamara was invited to return for , and the Boston bullpen was buttressed by the acquisition of All-Star relief pitcher Lee Smith. But the Red Sox played below expectations and were only 43–42, nine games behind the Tigers, by the July 11–14 All-Star break. McNamara was fired during the hiatus, and his interim successor, third-base coach Joe Morgan, promptly won 19 of his first 20 games as skipper to pull the Red Sox into a first-place tie with Tigers by August 3. They went on to win the division championship.\n\nMcNamara's managing career was not over, however. He spent 1989 as a Seattle Mariners scout, but on November 3, 1989, the Cleveland Indians hired him as their skipper for . Under McNamara, the 1990 Indians improved by four games compared with the 1989 edition, going 77–85 and finishing fourth in the AL East, only 11 games behind the Red Sox. But in , Cleveland took a major step backward; they won only 25 of 77 games under McNamara until his firing on July 5, and dropped 105 of 162 games that season.\n\nMcNamara returned to the Angels' organization as a minor league catching instructor, but was called to manage in the majors a final time in at age 64. He became interim pilot upon Marcel Lachemann's resignation on August 6, and had directed them to a 5–9 record when he was hospitalized for a blood clot in his leg on August 20. After coach Joe Maddon helmed the Angels for three weeks while he was treated, McNamara was able to return to the Angels and finish the 1996 season. He compiled a 10–18 overall record and was eventually succeeded by Terry Collins for .\n\nThe 1996 assignment concluded McNamara's managerial career. Over all or parts of 19 seasons, he had a record of 1,167–1,242 (.484).\n\n\n"}

He is well known in Brazil and abroad by his books on recreational mathematics, most of them published under the pen names of Malba Tahan and Breno de Alencar Bianco.\n\nHe has been called by one biographer \"the only mathematics teacher who ever became as famous as a soccer player\". He wrote 69 books of tales and 51 of mathematics and other subjects, which by 1995 had sold over two million books. His most famous work, \"The Man Who Counted\", saw its 54th printing in 2001.\n\nJúlio César's most popular books, including \"The Man Who Counted\", are collections of mathematical problems, puzzles, and curiosities, embedded in tales inspired by the Arabian Nights. He thoroughly researched his subject matters — not only the mathematics, but also the history, geography, and culture of the Islamic Empire which was the backdrop and connecting thread of his books. Yet Júlio César's travels outside Brazil were limited to short visits to Buenos Aires, Montevideo, and Lisbon: he never set foot in the deserts and cities which he so vividly described in his book.\n\nJúlio César was very critical of the educational methods used in Brazilian classrooms, especially for mathematics. \"The mathematics teacher is a sadist,\" he claimed, \"who loves to make everything as complicated as possible.\" In education, he was decades ahead of his time, and today his proposals are still more praised than implemented.\n\nFor his books, Júlio César received a prize by the prestigious Brazilian Literary Academy and was made a member of the Pernambuco Literary Academy. The Malba Tahan Institute was founded in 2004 at Queluz to preserve his legacy. The State Legislature of Rio de Janeiro determined that his birthday, May 6, be commemorated as the Mathematician's Day.\n\nJúlio César was born in Rio de Janeiro but spent most of his childhood in , a small rural town in the State of São Paulo. His father, João de Deus de Mello e Souza, was a civil servant with limited salary and eight (some reports say nine) children to support; so one thing that young Júlio César surely learned to count well were the pennies of his scant allowance.\n\nIn 1905 he was sent with his older brother João Batista to Rio de Janeiro, to attend a preparatory school for a prestigious high school, the Colégio Militar do Rio de Janeiro. He was admitted to the Colégio in 1906, which he left in 1909 for the Colégio Pedro II.\n\nIronically, the kid who would become the most famous Brazilian mathematician of all time was a rather poor student himself. In a 1905 letter to their parents, João Batista tells that little Júlio \"is bad at writing, and a failure in mathematics\". His report card at the Colégio Pedro II in Rio de Janeiro records that he once failed an Algebra exam, and barely passed one on Arithmetics. He later attributed these results to the teaching practices of the time, based on \"the detestable method of salivation\".\n\nHowever, he did give signs of his originality and non-conventionalism in other ways. As a kid in Queluz he used to keep frogs as pets, and at one point he had some 50 animals in his yard. One of them, nicknamed \"Monsignor\", would follow him through the town. As a grown up, he kept up with this hobby after a fashion, by assembling a large collection of frog statuettes.\n\nHis career as a writer began while he was still in high school, when one of his classmates offered him a brand-new pen and a postage stamp from Chile in exchange for an essay on the theme of \"Hope\", the homework for the next day. According to his memoirs, Júlio was called late at night by other anxious students, and by the next morning he had provided four different essays on \"Hope\", at 400 réis the piece. He kept on this activity for the rest of the year, writing on \"Hate\", \"Nostalgia\", and whatever else the teacher demanded.\n\nMany years later he met his teacher, Silva Ramos, and told him of those dubious activities. When Silva Ramos introduced him jokingly to Raul Pederneiras as a \"merchant of Hope and Hate\", he got from the man a prophetic advice: \"Forget Hate, and go on selling Hope. Take up this poetic profession, Merchant of Hope: since that business is profitable for the buyer, and even more so for the seller.\"\n\nJúlio began to write tales on his own while still in his teens, but did not impress the critics in his family. His brother João Batista recalls that Júlio's tales were chock full of superfluous characters with bizarre names like \"Mardukbarian\" or \"Protocholóski\".\n\nIn 1918, at the age of 23, Júlio César offered five of his tales to the editor of the newspaper \"O Imparcial\", where he worked; but his boss did not even look at them. Undaunted, Júlio picked up the manuscripts and brought them back a few days later, this time pretending that they were translations of the work of a certain \"R. S. Slade,\" supposedly the rage in New York City. The first of those tales, \"The Jew's Revenge\", was published in the front page of the next issue of the newspaper; and the rest followed suit.\n\nThis experience convinced Júlio to assume a \"foreign\" pen name. He chose an Arabian identity — because, as he declared in an interview, the Arabs were unsurpassed in the art of storytelling. For the next seven years he prepared himself by studying Arabic and reading all he could on Islamic culture. In 1925, he sold the idea of a series of tales on Oriental themes to Irineu Marinho, editor of the newspaper \"A Noite\" (which would later become a huge Brazilian media conglomerate, the Organizações Globo). His stories, published in the column \"Contos de Malba Tahan\" (\"Tales of Malba Tahan\"), were attributed to a fictitious Arabian scholar of that name, and ostensibly translated by an equally fictitious \"Professor Breno Alencar Bianco\".\n\nWhether for the catchy pseudonym, or (more likely) for the author's lively style and imagination, his books were a resounding success, and he became a national celebrity. Even though his identity soon was known to everybody, he continued to use the name of Malba Tahan in his public life. He had a rubber stamp made with that name in Arabic script, which he used when grading his student's homework; and, in 1952 — by special permission of Brazilian President Getúlio Vargas — he added \"Malba Tahan\" to his own legal name.\n\nBefore being a teacher, he worked for a time as general assistant at the National Library.\n\nJúlio César graduated as an elementary schoolteacher at the Escola Normal do Distrito federal in Rio de Janeiro, and as a civil engineer at the Escola Politecnica in 1913. He started lecturing as a substitute teacher at the Colégio Pedro II, and later became a teacher at the Escola Normal.\n\nHe began teaching history, geography and physics, and only later moved to mathematics.\n\nIn time he became Chair at the Colégio Pedro II, at the Instituto de Educação, at the teacher's school of the Universidade do Brasil (which would become the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro) and at the National School of Education, where he got the title of Professor Emeritus.\n\nBesides his classes at the teacher's school, he delivered over 2000 lectures on the teaching of mathematics, and wrote many books on the subject. In all his works Júlio defended the use of games as teaching aids, and the replacement of chalk-and-blackboard lectures by \"mathematics laboratories\" where students could engage in creative activities, self-study, and object manipulation — a proposal that was seen as heretical at the time.\n\nIn the Brazilian 0-to-10 grading system, Júlio would never give a zero grade. \"Why give a zero, when there are so many numbers to choose from?\" he used to say. He would give to the brightest students the task of teaching the weaker ones: \"by the end of the first semester, they would all be above the pass line.\" he claimed.\n\nWhile his methods and style charmed all his students, he had the opposition of many of his colleagues, who found his approach of connecting mathematics to everyday life as demeaning.\n\nJulio César also spread his message through radio programmes of several stations in Rio de Janeiro, including the Rádio Nacional, Radio Clube, and Rádio Mayrink Veiga, as well as in television, at the TV Tupi of Rio and the TV Cultura of São Paulo.\n\nJúlio was an energetic campaigner for the cause of the Hanseniacs (lepers), who had historically been banned and confined in leper colonies. For over 10 years he edited the magazine \"Damião\", which preached the end of the prejudice and re-incorporation of former inmates into the society. In his testament, he left a message to the Hanseniacs, to be read at his funeral.\n\nJúlio César's last public lecture was delivered in Recife, at the age of 79, to an audience of future teachers. It was about the art of storytelling. Back to his hotel room he apparently suffered a heart attack and expired.\n\nHe had left instructions for his funeral. He did not want people to wear black: quoting a song by Noel Rosa, he explained that \"Black clothes are vanities/of those who enjoy fancy dress;/I only wish for your memories/and memories are colorless\".\n\n\n"}

He was the son of a deputy of the third estate of Dauphiné to the Constituent Assembly.\n\nHe was born in Valence.\nHe entered the magistracy and became \"procureur général\" at Grenoble, but resigned this office on the Bourbon Restoration. He then devoted himself mainly to the study of criminal law, and in 1818 published \"La justice criminelle en France\", in which with great courage he attacked the special tribunals, provosts' courts or military commissions which were the main instruments of the Reaction, and advocated a return to the old common law and trial by jury. The book had a considerable effect in discrediting the reactionary policy of the government; but it was not until 1828, when Bérenger was elected to the chamber, that he had an opportunity of exercising a personal influence on affairs as a member of the group known as that of constitutional opposition. \n\nHis courage, as well as his moderation, was again displayed during the revolution of 1830, when, as president of the parliamentary commission for the trial of the ministers of Charles X, he braved the fury of the mob and secured a sentence of imprisonment in place of the death penalty for which they clamoured.\n\nHis position in the chamber became one of much influence, and he had a large share in the modelling of the new constitution, though his effort to secure a hereditary peerage failed. Above all he was instrumental in framing the new criminal code, based on more humanitarian principles, which was issued in 1835. It was due to him that, in 1832, the right, so important in actual French practice, was given to juries to find \"extenuating circumstances\" in cases when guilt involved the death penalty. In 1831 he had been made a member of the court of appeal (cour de cassation), and the same year was nominated a member of the Academy of Political and Moral Sciences (Académie des Sciences Morales et Politiques).\n\nHe was raised to the peerage in 1839. This status he lost owing to the revolution of 1848 which ended his career as a politician. As a judge, however, his activity continued. He was president of the high courts of Bourges and Versailles in 1849. Having been appointed president of one of the chambers of the court of appeal, he devoted himself entirely to judicial work until his retirement, under the age limit, on 31 May 1860.\n\nHe now withdrew to his native town, and occupied himself with his favorite work of reform of criminal law. In 1833, he had shared in the foundation of a society for the reclamation of young criminals, in which he continued to be actively interested to the end. In 1851 and 1852, on the commission of the academy of moral sciences, he had travelled in France and England for the purpose of examining and comparing the penal systems in the two countries. The result was published in 1855 under the title \"La Répression pénale, comparaison du système pénitentiaire en France et en Angleterre\".\n\nHis son, René Bérenger, continued the work of his father.\n\n"}

This body was the legislature of the Mongolian People's Republic. It delegated much of its powers to an executive committee, the \"Ulsyn Baga Khural\" (Little Khural). The Great Khural held nine sessions between November 1924 and February 1949. Following electoral reforms in 1951, the numbering of its sessions began again. The first was held in July 1951 and the third in July 1957.\n\nIn 1960 a new constitution was adopted and the body was renamed the \"People's Great Khural\" (, \"Ardyn Ikh Khural\"), but the sessions were not renumbered. The fourth took place in July 1960 and the last in September 1992. In Russian and Mongolian historiography, the term \"People's Great Khural\" is frequently extended back to refer to the 1924–60 Khural to distinguish it from the post-1992 State Great Khural.\n\nThe first free, democratic and multi-party election in Mongolia was held in 1990. Then the newly elected parliament changed the Constitution, established the State Baga Khural which replaced the People's Great Khural as the highest legislative body.

It is the administrative center of Berezhanskyi Raion (district), and lies about 100 km from Lviv and 50 km from the oblast capital, Ternopil. The city has a population of about 20,000, and is about 400 m above sea level. The yearly temperature in Berezhany ranges from in winter to in summer.\n\nThe first written mention of Berezhany dates from 1374, when the village was granted by the Governor of Galicia and Lodomeria Vladislaus II to Ruthenian boyar Vas'ko Teptukhovych. Shortly afterwards, in the 14th century it became a part of Poland and became the property of a noble family from Buchach — members House of Buczacki, later Sieniawa. As Mikołaj Sieniawski, a notable Polish military commander and politician envisioned a seat of his family there, on March 19, 1530, King Sigismund I of Poland granted the village a city charter modelled on the Magdeburg Law. The document, among other privileges, granted the new town of \"Brzeżany\", as it was called prior to 1945, with: two markets yearly, one for the day of Our Lord's Ascension and the other for the day of Saint Peter in Chains, that are to be held every year. As to weekly fairs these are to be held every Friday, although with respect to the rights of other nearby towns. Thus, the town is to allow each and every tradesman, cart driver or businessman, regardless of his or her state, gender, faith or rite, to arrive to the town of Brzeżany for trade.\nThe town's location on the route between Lviv and Terebovlya proved beneficial to the city's growth and development. Among the first settlers to inhabit the town were people from Lwów liberated by Sieniawski from Tatar captivity. It soon started to attract settlers from all over Poland, including a large number of Jews, Ukrainians and Armenians. In 1534 Mikołaj Sieniawski also started to construct a large fortress at a steep hill on a small island at the Złota Lipa river (see Berezhany Castle). The stronghold was finished in 1554 and became the main seat of the Sieniawski family and one of the best fortified places in the region. Simultaneously, a large fortified convent and a church of the Bernardines was constructed on the hill nearby. Both fortified places provided a safe refuge for the tradesmen, which added to the city's prominence in trade and commerce. In the early 17th century one of Mikołaj Sieniawski's grandsons, also named Mikołaj, fortified the city itself. The fortress withstood all attacks by Tatars and Cossacks until the Khmelnytsky Uprising of 1648, when it was captured by the Cossacks. In 1655 during The Deluge, it was again captured by the forces of Sweden and the city was again plundered. However, it was rebuilt afterwards and withstood further Cossack attacks in 1667 and 1672.\n\nIn 1675 the town was again sacked and pillaged by the forces of the Ottoman Empire. However,\nMikołaj Hieronim Sieniawski financed the reconstruction of the town. Among the buildings rebuilt were the Bernardine church and a Uniate church in the suburb of \"Polska Adamówka\" (paradoxically being primarily inhabited by Ukrainians and not Poles as the name suggests). Because of its relative safety the town grew and by the end of the 17th century there were nearly 8,000 inhabitants there. After the death of Adam Mikołaj Sieniawski, the last of his kin, the town was inherited by August Aleksander Czartoryski through Sieniawski's daughter Maria Zofia. Czartoryski, a notable magnate, created a large artificial lake in the town's proximity in the early 18th century. Along the bank of that lake, the suburbs of Siółko and Kastelówka were built. After the First Partition of Poland of 1772 the town was annexed by Austria, who attached it to the region of Galicia. After 1867 the town became part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and continued to flourish as it was outside of the region of fortifications, inside which construction of new houses was severely limited. A grammar school was founded there in 1805, and had many notable alumni. Among them were Włodzimierz Bednarski, Franz Kokovsky, Bohdan Lepkyi, Rudolf Moch, Kornel Ujejski, Ruslan Shashkevych, and the future Marshal of Poland Edward Rydz-Śmigły. The town was connected by rail to Tarnopol (modern Ternopil, Ukraine) in 1894 and in 1900 it had a population of 10,610.\nAlthough the city remained quite populous, with time it lost much of its importance as a trade centre and became populated primarily by Jews as a typical shtetl. Also, the castle fell into neglect as the successors of the Sieniawski family, the Czartoryski and Lubomirski families, were owners of many more castles and had no interest in this one in particular. During World War I the town was briefly occupied by Russia, but was soon recaptured by Austria-Hungary. The castle was partially pillaged by Austro-Hungarian soldiers who were stationed there during the war while some of the works of art were evacuated from the palaces of Puławy, Łańcut and Wilanów. At the end of the war the town was part of the short-lived West Ukrainian People's Republic, but in 1919 was awarded to the renascent Poland by the Conference of Ambassadors of the League of Nations, following the short Polish-Ukrainian War. During the Polish-Bolshevik War it was briefly occupied by the Red Army, but was soon recaptured by the Polish Army after the Battle of Warsaw. However, some of the most precious sculptures and paintings from the castle and local churches, evacuated to Kraków, were never returned and instead survived the war in the castle of Pieskowa Skała near Ojców.\n\nAfter the Polish Defensive War of 1939 and the outbreak of the town was briefly occupied by Nazi Germany, after which it was transferred to the Soviet Union. During the Soviet occupation many of the local inhabitants were sent to the Gulag camps; there was also a notable NKVD prison located in the town. In 1941, after the end of the Nazi-Soviet Alliance and the outbreak of the Russo-German War, the town was again occupied by Germany and attached to the so-called Distrikt Galizien of the General Government. Before World War II Brzezany's Jewish population was about 4,000, while after 1939 this population tripled with an additional 8,000 Jews, refugees from eastern German occupied territories. In December 1941, approximately 1,000 Jews were killed in the Lityatyn forest. On 12 June 1943 the Nazis murdered almost all the Jews from the Brzezany ghetto and work camp at the local cemetery; only a few escaped. Between 1942 and the end of the war there was heavy partisan activity in the area, mostly by local branches of the Armia Krajowa.\n\nIn 1944 the town was occupied in the course of Operation Tempest of the insurgent Polish Home Army, but the Polish nationalists were soon pushed aside as the town was occupied by the Red Army. In 1945 it was annexed by the Soviet Union and attached to the Ukrainian SSR. Since 1991 it has been a part of Ukraine.\n\nThere are four secondary schools and a grammar school in the city. A brickyard, a furniture factory, and a glassworks are all of economic importance to Berezhany.\n\nOf architectural significance are the ruins of the five-cornered fortress (completed in 1554), a park originally laid out in the 17th century, and the wooden Church of Saint Nicholas (completed in 1691).\n\n\n\n\n"}

His first professional match was on July 3 versus Boca Juniors, a 3–1 victory.\n\nMenotti remained four seasons in Rosario Central prior to be transferred in 1964 to Racing, then moving to Boca Juniors in 1965, where he would win his first title as player, the 1965 Primera División. Two years later Menotti arrived to the North American Soccer League to play for the New York Generals. In 1968 Menotti was traded to Santos FC where he was teammate of Pelé and won the Campeonato Brasileiro Série A, Intercontinental Supercup and Campeonato Paulista all in 1968. After his tenure with Santos, Menotti signed with Clube Atlético Juventus, where he retired from football in 1970.\n\nAfter retiring from play, Menotti became friends with coach Miguel \"Gitano\" Juárez, with whom he traveled to the 1970 FIFA World Cup in Mexico. Fascinated by the Brazilian style of play led by his friend Pelé, he decided to become a coach himself. Menotti worked as coach assistant of Juárez in Newell's Old Boys.\n\nAs manager, Menotti won his first title with Huracán, the 1973 Torneo Metropolitano with a side that included notable players such as Carlos Babington, Miguel Brindisi, Roque Avallay and the outstanding René Houseman. That squad was widely praised by the media due to their style of playing, being considered one of the best Argentine teams of all time. Huracán played 32 matches, winning 19 with 5 loses. The squad scored 62 goals and received 30.\n\nMenotti was appointed the head coach of the Argentina national team in October 1974.\n\nMenotti was the coach of Argentina when they won their first FIFA World Cup in 1978, defeating the Netherlands in the final.\n\nIn 1979, Menotti led the Argentina U20 national team to success in the World Youth Championship in Japan, with Diego Maradona the team's star player.\n\nAt the 1982 World Cup, Argentina lost to Belgium in their opening match. The team started with Fillol; Olguin, Galván, Passarella, Tarantini; Ardiles, Gallego, Maradona; Bertoni, Díaz, and Kempes. Argentina then defeated Hungary and El Salvador, and met Italy and Brazil in Group 3 of the second round, although they lost both matches.\n\nMenotti was appointed Barcelona head coach in 1983, helping them to win the Copa del Rey, 1983 Copa de la Liga and the 1983 Supercopa de España before leaving in 1984.\n\nOn 3 February 2017, Guadalajara made a formal offer to sign him on as their academy director.\n\nIn January 2019, Menotti was named as the director of the Argentina National Teams.\n\nMenotti always displayed a rebellious streak and cultivated an image of coolness. He wore long hair, dressed casually, and used to drop references to cultural icons in his conversations, from writer Ernesto Sabato to singer Joan Manuel Serrat. He was opinionated on politics, projecting a left-wing socialist image that contrasted with his holding a very visible post during the right-wing military dictatorship.\n\nMenotti famously proclaimed:\n\nBoca Juniors\n\nSantos\n\nArgentina\n\nHuracán\n\nBarcelona\n\nArgentina Youth\n\nArgentina\n\n\n"}

The name for the album was taken from the 14th-century Book of Taliesin.\n\nThe structure of the album is similar to that of their first, with four original songs and three rearranged covers, although the tracks are longer, the arrangements more complex and the sound more polished than on \"Shades of Deep Purple\". The music style is a mix of psychedelic rock, progressive rock and hard rock, with several inserts of classical music arranged by the band's keyboard player Jon Lord.\n\nDeep Purple's American record label aimed for a hippie audience, which was very influential in the US at the time, but the chart results of the album and singles were not as high as expected. This setback did not hinder the success of the three-month US tour, when the band played in many important venues and festivals and received positive feedback from audiences and the press. Deep Purple were still an underground band which played in small clubs and colleges in the United Kingdom, largely ignored by the media and the public. The British record company EMI did not release \"The Book of Taliesyn\" until June 1969, on the new underground prog rock sub-label Harvest Records, and the album did not chart. Even the release of the new single \"Emmaretta\" and new dates in the UK in summer 1969 did not increase album sales or the popularity of Deep Purple in the UK. Perception of the album has changed in later years and it has been reviewed more favourably.\n\nDeep Purple were booked for a long tour in the United States, starting in October 1968, as a result of the unexpected success in the US and Canada of their first album \"Shades of Deep Purple\", fronted by the hit single \"Hush\". The single, released in June, had reached No. 4 in the US Singles Chart and No. 2 in Canada and was the main reason of their sudden popularity overseas. The situation was quite the opposite at home, where the band had been heavily criticized by the media and audiences.\n\nIn July, band and crew relocated from West Sussex to London. Their management rented a house at 13 Second Avenue, Acton Vale, which was used as living quarters and to prepare for the upcoming US tour when they were not away for gigs or promotion. Guitarist Ritchie Blackmore went to live there with his German fiancée Babs Hardie.\n\nExecutives at Tetragrammaton Records, Deep Purple's American label, thought it would be more profitable to have a new album to promote during the US tour, besides the already successful \"Shades of Deep Purple\". Moreover, the eight tracks recorded in May for Deep Purple's debut album and performed live in the British gigs of July and August were deemed insufficient for their shows as headliners in the US. For these reasons, they were pushed back into the studio just a couple of months before the tour began, even though their debut album had not been released in the United Kingdom yet.\n\nThe request of the record label to record a new album only three months after their debut found the band unprepared, because the intense activity after the release of \"Shades of Deep Purple\" had left very little time for writing and rehearsing new songs. Under pressure, the musicians eventually came up with four lengthy original compositions, but to fill up the new album they reworked and expanded three cover songs, following again the example of the American band Vanilla Fudge, which many band members admired. The first was \"Kentucky Woman\", a hit single for Neil Diamond in 1967 which Deep Purple performed live at a BBC session in August. Though written by Diamond, Deep Purple's version musically leans toward the style of Mitch Ryder's recording of \"Devil with a Blue Dress On\". The second cover was \"River Deep – Mountain High\", a single released by Ike & Tina Turner in 1966. Finally, the 1965 Beatles song \"We Can Work It Out\" was chosen after Paul McCartney himself had reportedly expressed appreciation for Deep Purple's version of \"Help!\"\n\nOn the first of August 1968, Deep Purple entered De Lane Lea Studios in Kingsway, London, with producer Derek Lawrence and sound engineer Brian Aintsworth, who had both worked on their previous album. Tetragrammaton's advance of $250,000 had been used to book two weeks in the studio, a time which covered songwriting, rehearsals and recording sessions. Time was granted in larger amount than for the making of \"Shades of Deep Purple\" in May, feeding the band’s ambition of coming up with better original material than their previous effort.\n\nDeep Purple recorded \"Shield\" and \"Anthem\" on the first day. On the first song Ian Paice plays a complex drum pattern which sounds like a repeated clash of glass objects, while the second one required a string quartet for the baroque style interlude in the middle. The following days they proceeded with the composition and recording of \"Exposition/We Can Work It Out\" and of the original track \"Listen, Learn, Read On\". On 19 August, they concluded these sessions with the recording of \"Kentucky Woman\" and of the heavy and up-tempo instrumental \"Wring That Neck\", which came out from a tight collaboration between Blackmore and bass player Nick Simper. The name \"Wring That Neck\" comes from a phrase the band used when they were playing live, describing the bassist or guitarist really bursting at their instruments to create a hard noise (i.e., squeezing, or \"wringing\", the neck of the guitar). Another instrumental called \"Playground\" was written and recorded on 18 August, but the lyrics were never completed and it was eventually discarded. \"River Deep - Mountain High\" was always intended as the final track, so its recording was postponed until the other tracks were finished. The musicians’ perfectionism required extra time to complete the track and it was taped only on 10 October, a long time after the planned deadline for studio recording.\n\nThe mixing was supposed to be overseen by the band members, but their schedule in October was so tight that Lawrence did it without them. This dismayed the band at first, but the sound turned out cleaner, heavier and more polished than on their debut. The tapes were mixed in both mono and stereo, but the mono tapes were trashed, as neither Tetragrammaton nor EMI, Deep Purple's British label, had any use for them.\n\nThe album was released in the United States in October 1968, just in time for the tour. The American label insisted on changing the title of the instrumental \"Wring That Neck\", considered too violent, to \"Hard Road\". The track was used as the B-side of the single \"Kentucky Woman\", issued in December 1968. \"The Book of Taliesyn\" reached No. 54 in the US chart and No. 48 in the Canadian chart. The single peaked at No. 38 in the US and received much airplay, but did not replicate the success of \"Hush\".\nIn an attempt to improve sales of the album, a shorter and heavily edited version of \"River Deep - Mountain High\" was released as a single exclusively in the United States and Canada in February 1969, with \"Listen, Learn, Read On\" as the B-side. It reached No. 53 and No. 42, respectively, in the two countries and was not a success, charting lower than \"Kentucky Woman\". The album was distributed in Canada (in 1968) and Japan (in June 1969) by Polydor Records.\n\nEMI delayed the release of the album in the UK to June 1969, after the band had come back from the US and set up a proper tour of their home country. By that time, the band had already recorded and released their third album \"Deep Purple\" in the US, and recorded a single with a new line-up. \"The Book of Taliesyn\" was the first release by Harvest Records, a new sub-label which EMI executives had devised as an outlet for British underground progressive rock groups. \"Kentucky Woman\", with \"Wring That Neck\" as B-side, was the only single released in the UK in December 1968, but it was retired after only six weeks. Just as had happened with \"Shades of Deep Purple\" the year before, both album and single received little promotion and were widely overlooked, selling much less in the UK than overseas.\n\n\"The Book of Taliesyn\" was reissued many times all over the world, often in a set with the two other albums recorded by the Mk. I line-up. Besides the original issues, the most significant version of the album is the Remastered CD edition of 2000 by EMI, which contains previously unreleased recordings taken from the sessions of August and December 1968 and from TV shows appearances as bonus tracks. All the songs were digitally remastered by Peter Mew at Abbey Road Studios in London. Other notable re-releases of the album include a white vinyl collector's edition issued in 2015 for a Record Store Day.\n\nThe musical style of \"The Book of Taliesyn\" is a mix of progressive rock, psychedelic rock and hard rock and different observers think that in this album the band is more mature and in greater control of its own means of expression. Critics highlight how the compositions are generally longer and more complex than in their debut album. Deep Purple biographer Dave Thompson writes that a dark mood permeates \"The Book of Taliesyn\" with little indulgence to pop rock, citing influences of the American band The Doors in the original tracks written for this album.\n\nThe influence of keyboard player Jon Lord's classical music upbringing is felt strongly in all the tracks, but this time he was not the main person responsible for songwriting and arrangements, which are considered by critics Deep Purple's first real group effort. Lord's interest in mixing rock and classical music would culminate in late 1969 with his \"Concerto for Group and Orchestra\" suite, but he already defined Deep Purple as a symphonic rock band in a 1968 interview. Nick Simper complained about Lord's excessive influence in composition and arrangements in a 1983 interview, which he said \"resulted in a lack of direction for the band.\" \"Anthem\" is perhaps the band's deepest venture into classical music on a regular studio album, with its baroque-style interlude reminiscent of a Bach fugue written by Lord and performed using Mellotron and string quartet. A similar approach can be found on King Crimson's debut album, released a year later. Rearranged excerpts from the second movement of Beethoven's Symphony No. 7 and Tchaikovsky's Ouverture-Fantasy \"Romeo and Juliet\" are in the instrumental intro \"Exposition\", while \"River Deep, Mountain High\" is introduced by the notes of \"Also sprach Zarathustra\", written in 1896 by Richard Strauss and very popular after its inclusion in the film \"\", screened earlier in 1968.\n\n\"Wring that Neck\" and \"Kentucky Woman\" show more traces of the heavier music that the band would embrace in their 70s albums with the Mk.II line-up. Blackmore's guitar work is generally praised by critics. However, in a recent interview, the guitarist defined the album as \"lame\" and remembered that he had not yet found his own style of guitar playing at the time of recording.\n\nThe lyrics written by the band's singer Rod Evans are very functional to the music and the marketing Deep Purple's record label was building up for the American hippie audience. Evans took inspiration for the fantasy-themed \"Listen, Learn, Read On\", which contains lyrical reference to the album's title, from the 14th-century Welsh manuscript Book of Taliesin, a collection of poems attributed to the 6th-century poet Taliesin. The title and cover art of the album were also inspired by the manuscript. Instead psychedelia and its rituals play a large part in the lyrics of \"Shield\". Simper thinks that Evans' lyrics are \"far better than anything (...) has ever been written in other line ups, in Deep Purple.\"\n\nCover art and sleeve notes convey Tetragrammaton's decision to aim the album at the vast American hippie audience, which was very influential in the US at the time. The notes in particular were written in a mystical tone, evoking the bard Taliesyn as a spiritual guide and comparing listening to the songs to an exploration in the band members' souls. \nThe original cover was drawn in pen, ink and color by the British illustrator and author John Vernon Lord, who coincidentally appears to share the same name as Deep Purple's keyboard player. \"The Book of Taliesyn\" was the only record cover John Vernon Lord ever designed and, according to the artist's recent retrospective book \"Drawing upon Drawing\", the original artwork was never returned. In his book, John Vernon Lord remembers the assignment received from his agency Saxon Artists:\n\nThe fee for the job was £30, minus 25% for the agent. John Vernon Lord was, until recently, Professor of Illustration at the University of Brighton.\n\nDeep Purple arrived in California on 15 October 1968 and their first public appearance on American soil was at \"The Dating Game\" TV show on ABC on 17 October. They were the first rock band to perform on the show, where Jon Lord was one of the contestants. The next two days the band played live in the US for the first time as supporting act of Cream in their \"Goodbye\" tour. The concerts were held at the Inglewood Forum near Los Angeles, California, in front of more than 16,000 people each night. Recordings of those live shows were issued in 2002 as \"Inglewood – Live in California\". The next gig at San Diego was the last one supporting Cream, whose management apparently did not appreciate the cheerful reaction of the audience to Deep Purple and dropped them. After a week of forced stop, their American manager succeeded in setting up a tour which included the San Francisco International Pop Festival and venues on the West Coast. This opportunity was very useful for the young musicians, who as headliners could lengthen their live shows up to 90 minutes and gained much needed experience on the road. This was particularly true for Blackmore, who developed and extended his guitar solos, incorporating more improvisations.\n\nThe tour was a success and Deep Purple's popularity in the US received another boost from a TV appearance at \"Playboy After Dark\" alongside Hugh Hefner on 23 October 1968. The band had become a much requested act and more dates were added on the East Coast till the end of the year, including a two nights gig at the Fillmore East with Creedence Clearwater Revival and the James Cotton Blues Band, and Christmas holiday shows at the famous Electric Circus club in New York.\n\nIn late December, the band managers Tony Edwards and John Coletta booked some studio time in New York to record a new single, after the relative failure of \"Kentucky Woman\" and \"River Deep, Mountain High\". The band recorded the cover of Ben E. King's song \"Oh No No No\" and tried \"Lay Lady Lay\" by Bob Dylan and \"Glory Road\" by Neil Diamond, without satisfying results. The record label did not publish those recordings and a surviving take of \"Oh No No No\" can be heard only in the 2000 remastered edition of \"The Book of Taliesyn\".\n\nThe band returned in England on 3 January 1969 and went straight into De Lane Lea Studios to record new songs. The recording sessions were interspersed with gigs and lasted from January to March; most of the songs ended up in their eponymous album, which would be released by Tetragrammaton in the US only in June 1969.\n\nDeep Purple debuted the new single \"Emmaretta\", new material and new takes on songs from their released albums at BBC sessions for the \"Top Gear\" radio show on 14 January. The song \"Hey Bop a Re Bop\" played at those sessions would later become \"The Painter\". Starting on the first of February the band went on tour in Denmark and the UK, with gigs in colleges and small clubs. In an interview, the band commented that in comparison with what they earned in America \"they were actually losing a couple of thousand pounds every night they played in Britain.\" The last UK gig was on 22 March and on 1 April 1969 the band was again on tour in the US, despite the lack of a new album to promote. It was at this time that Blackmore and Lord decided to change Deep Purple's musical style, veering towards straight hard rock, which led to Evans and Simper's dismissal in July.\n\nWhen \"The Book of Taliesyn\" was finally released in the UK in June 1969 a few more dates in the band's home country were added to promote the album release, even if the Mk.II line-up with new members Ian Gillan and Roger Glover was already rehearsing and recording new material in secret.\n\nSongs from this album were performed regularly by the Mk. I line-up. The exceptions were \"Exposition/We Can Work It Out\" and \"Anthem\", whose complex arrangements could not be easily reproduced in a live setting. The Mk. II formation performed \"Kentucky Woman\" in their first shows, but dropped it from the set list together with the few other songs from the first three albums, in favour of new material. Only the instrumental \"Wring That Neck\" remained a staple of Deep Purple's performances for a couple of years, working as a frame for Blackmore and Lord's long improvisations and coming back in the set list of the current line-up in the 2000s.\n\nDeep Purple's albums and singles were almost completely ignored in the UK, a fact that puzzled American reporters. In an interview, Simper tried to explain their lack of success in their home country, saying that the British audience was more interested in a fancy presentation than music and that blues rock \"was becoming very big\" at the time in England. John Peel, head of the \"Top Gear\" radio show, who had met the band in 1968 and had great expectations for \"The Book of Taliesyn\", was not too pleased with the final result:\n\nAmerican reviewers were enthusiastic of Deep Purple's live performances and the lack of a new successful single apparently did not ruin the positive perception of the band in the US, to the point that they were often addressed as an American band. Band members even thought about transferring their residence to the United States, but abandoned the idea when they learned that the 21-year-old Paice could be drafted for the Vietnam War.\n\nModern reviews of the album go from positive to mixed. Joe Viglione of AllMusic compares Deep Purple's production to Vanilla Fudge's, underlining how the two bands covered songs from the same authors and used similar arrangements. He writes that on \"The Book of Taliesyn\" Deep Purple veered more towards progressive rock than their American counterparts, combining meaningful lyrics and \"innovative musical passages\". On the contrary, PopMatters criticizes the \"Spinal Tapish\" lyrics and the lack of hit material on the album with the exception of \"Wring That Neck\", considered \"perhaps the first real Deep Purple composition.\" Blogcritics reviewers stress how the original material, and \"Wring That Neck\" in particular, \"stands the test of time well\". However, Greg Barbrick finds \"Jon Lord’s classical leanings (...) a bit too much\" on tracks like \"Exposition\" and \"Anthem\", where they \"threaten to derail the proceedings\". Canadian journalist Martin Popoff in his \"Collector's Guide to Heavy Metal\" described the album's sound as a mix of hard rock and psychedelic rock usually associated with bands such as Mad River and The 13th Floor Elevators. He found \"The Book of Taliesyn\" very similar in structure and just \"a bit darker, more bombastic and theatrical\" than its predecessor, and considered the song \"Shield\" a \"buried gem\".\n\nAll credits adapted from the original releases.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is formed by the confluence of two forks, the West Fork and East Fork. The name is a misnomer, as there is no true white water on the river. However, there are many rapids due to the steep gradient present - the river falls an average of . The gradient rendered upstream navigation impossible, and in the mid-nineteenth century resulted in the construction of the Whitewater Canal paralleling the river from north of Connersville, Indiana, to the Ohio River.\n\nThe West Fork, shown as the main stem of the river on federal maps, rises in Randolph County, Indiana, approximately northeast of Modoc. It flows south and southeast, past Hagerstown and Connersville, and joins the East Fork of the river at Brookville, Indiana.\n\nThe East Fork rises in Darke County, Ohio, approximately northwest of New Paris. It flows south, through Richmond, Indiana, and joins the West Fork of the river at Brookville, Indiana.\n\nFrom the junction the Whitewater flows southeasterly into Ohio where it eventually joins the Miami River, a tributary of the Ohio River.\n\nFollowing continual flooding problems on the East Fork, and to help control flooding in the Ohio River, the East Fork was dammed by the US Army Corps of Engineers to create Brookville Lake in 1974. Brookville Lake extends from just south of Liberty, Indiana, to Brookville.\n\nCities and towns on the Whitewater River (north to south) include Hagerstown, Cambridge City, Connersville, Laurel, Metamora, Brookville, Harrison (Ohio), and Lawrenceburg. Richmond, Indiana is on the East Fork of the Whitewater River and is the most significant town in the river valley, containing most of the population of the valley. The West Fork of the river is paralleled by State Road 121 from Connersville to west of Brookville, thence by U.S. Route 52 to the Ohio River.\n\nThe region surrounding the Whitewater River is known as the Whitewater Valley. The melting Wisconsin ice cap starting about 21,000 years ago created the Whitewater Valley basin as we know it today. The Whitewater Valley encompasses approximately between Hagerstown in Wayne County and Lawrenceburg in Dearborn County on the Ohio River. The Whitewater River and its valley were the main conduit of settlement of southeastern and eastern Indiana from Cincinnati and Clarksville (opposite Louisville) on the Ohio River during the first half of the nineteenth century, prior to the construction of railroads.\n\nThe Indianapolis and Cincinnati Railroad constructed a line known as the Whitewater Railroad in 1863-1868 on the tow path of the Whitewater Canal, from Hagerstown to just west of Cincinnati. It brought to an end the commercial importance of the river and the canal.\n\nThe river today is devoted to scenic and recreational uses.\n\n\n"}

Graphics device drivers are written for specific hardware to work within a specific operating system kernel and to support a range of APIs used by applications to access the graphics hardware. They may also control output to the display if the display driver is part of the graphics hardware. Most free and open-source graphics device drivers are developed by the Mesa project. The driver is made up of a compiler, a rendering API, and software which manages access to the graphics hardware.\n\nDrivers without freely (and legally) -available source code are commonly known as \"binary drivers\". Binary drivers used in the context of operating systems that are prone to ongoing development and change (such as Linux) create problems for end users and package maintainers. These problems, which affect system stability, security and performance, are the main reason for the independent development of free and open-source drivers. When no technical documentation is available, an understanding of the underlying hardware is often gained by clean-room reverse engineering. Based on this understanding, device drivers may be written and legally published under any software license.\n\nIn rare cases, a manufacturer's driver source code is available on the Internet without a free license. This means that the code can be studied and altered for personal use, but the altered (and usually the original) source code cannot be freely distributed. Solutions to bugs in the driver cannot be easily shared in the form of modified versions of the driver. Therefore, the utility of such drivers is significantly reduced comparison to free and open-source drivers.\n\nThere are objections to binary-only drivers based on copyright, security, reliability and development concerns. As part of a wider campaign against binary blobs, OpenBSD lead developer Theo de Raadt said that with a binary driver there is \"no way to fix it when it breaks (and it will break)\"; when a product which relies on binary drivers is declared to be end-of-life by the manufacturer, it is effectively \"broken forever.\" The project has also stated that binary drivers \"hide bugs and workarounds for bugs\", an observation which has been somewhat vindicated by flaws found in binary drivers (including an exploitable bug in Nvidia's 3D drivers discovered in October 2006 by Rapid7). It is speculated that the bug has existed since 2004; Nvidia have denied this, asserting that the issue was only communicated to them in July 2006 and the 2004 bug was a bug in X.Org (not in Nvidia's driver).\n\nBinary drivers often do not work with current versions of open-source software, and almost never support development snapshots of open-source software; it is usually not directly possible for a developer to use Nvidia's or ATI's proprietary drivers with a development snapshot of an X server or a development snapshot of the Linux kernel. Features like kernel mode-setting cannot be added to binary drivers by anyone but the vendors, which prevents their inclusion if the vendor lacks capacity or interest.\n\nIn the Linux kernel development community, Linus Torvalds has made strong statements on the issue of binary-only modules: \"I \"refuse\" to even consider tying my hands over some binary-only module ... I want people to know that when they use binary-only modules, it's \"their\" problem\". Another kernel developer, Greg Kroah-Hartman, has said that a binary-only kernel module does not comply with the kernel's license (the GNU General Public License); it \"just violates the GPL due to fun things like derivative works and linking and other stuff.\" Writer and computer scientist Peter Gutmann has expressed concern that the digital rights management scheme in Microsoft's Windows Vista operating system may limit the availability of the documentation required to write open drivers, since it \"requires that the operational details of the device be kept confidential.\"\n\nIn the case of binary drivers, there are objections due to free software philosophy, software quality and security concerns. In 2006 Greg Kroah-Hartman concluded that:\n\n\"Closed source Linux kernel modules are illegal. That's it, it is very simple. I've had the misfortune of talking to a lot of different IP lawyers over the years about this topic, and every one that I've talked to all agree that there is no way that anyone can create a Linux kernel module, today, that can be closed source. It just violates the GPL due to fun things like derivative works and linking.\"\nThe Linux kernel has never maintained a stable in-kernel application binary interface. There are also concerns that proprietary drivers may contain backdoors, like the one found in Samsung Galaxy-series modem drivers.\n\nWhen applications such as a 3D game engine or a 3D computer graphics software shunt calculations from the CPU to the GPU, they usually use a special-purpose API like OpenGL or Direct3D and do not address the hardware directly. Because all translation (from API calls to GPU opcodes) is done by the device driver, it contains specialized knowledge and is an object of optimization. Due to the history of the rigidity of proprietary driver development there has been a recent surge in the number of community-backed device drivers for desktop and mobile GPUs. Free and Open Hardware organizations like FOSSi, LowRISC, and others, would also benefit from the development of an open graphical hardware standard. This would then provide computer manufacturers, hobbyists, and the like with a complete, royalty-free platform with which to develop computing hardware and related devices.\n\nThe desktop computer market was long dominated by PC hardware using the x86/x86-64 instruction set and GPUs available for the PC. With three major competitors (Nvidia, AMD and Intel). The main competing factor was the price of hardware and raw performance in 3D computer games, which is greatly affected by the efficient translation of API calls into GPU opcodes. The display driver and the video decoder are inherent parts of the graphics card: hardware designed to assist in the calculations necessary for the decoding of video streams. As the market for PC hardware has dwindled, it seems unlikely that new competitors will enter this market and it is unclear how much more knowledge one company could gain by seeing the source code of other companies' drivers.\n\nThe mobile sector presents a different situation. The functional blocks (the application-specific integrated circuit display driver, 2- and 3D acceleration and video decoding and encoding) are separate semiconductor intellectual property (SIP) blocks on the chip, since hardware devices vary substantially; some portable media players require a display driver that accelerates video decoding, but do not require 3D acceleration. The development goal is not only raw 3D performance, but system integration, power consumption and 2D capabilities. There is also an approach which abandons the traditional method (Vsync) of updating the display and makes better use of sample and hold technology to lower power consumption.\n\nDuring the second quarter of 2013 79.3 percent of smartphones sold worldwide were running a version of Android, and the Linux kernel dominates smartphones. Hardware developers have an incentive to deliver Linux drivers for their hardware but, due to competition, no incentive to make these drivers free and open-source. Additional problems are the Android-specific augmentations to the Linux kernel which have not been accepted in mainline, such as the Atomic Display Framework (ADF). ADF is a feature of 3.10 AOSP kernels which provides a dma-buf-centric framework between Android's hwcomposer HAL and the kernel driver. ADF significantly overlaps with the DRM-KMS framework. ADF has not been accepted into mainline, but a different set of solutions addressing the same problems (known as atomic mode setting) is under development. Projects such as libhybris harness Android device drivers to run on Linux platforms other than Android.\n\nPhoronix, which compares free drivers, is a source for real-world testing:\nIt is uncommon for video-game magazines to report benchmark testing on Linux. Benchmarks on Phoronix are limited in scope, primarily testing games which are available on Linux and support automated benchmarking.\n\nFree and open-source drivers are primarily developed on and for Linux by Linux kernel developers, third-party programming enthusiasts and employees of companies such as Advanced Micro Devices. Each driver has five parts:\n\nThe DRM is kernel-specific. A VESA driver is generally available for any operating system. The VESA driver supports most graphics cards without acceleration and at display resolutions limited to a set programmed in the video BIOS by the manufacturer.\n\nThe Linux graphics stack has evolved, detoured by the X Window System core protocol.\nAMD's proprietary driver, AMD Catalyst for their Radeon, is available for Microsoft Windows and Linux (formerly fglrx). A current version can be downloaded from AMD's site, and some Linux distributions contain it in their repositories. It is in the process of being replaced with an AMDGPU-PRO hybrid driver combining the open-source kernel, X and Mesa multimedia drivers with closed-source OpenGL, OpenCL and Vulkan drivers derived from Catalyst.\n\nThe FOSS drivers for ATI-AMD GPUs are being developed under the name Radeon (xf86-video-ati or xserver-xorg-video-radeon). They still must load proprietary microcode into the GPU to enable hardware acceleration.\n\nRadeon 3D code is split into six drivers, according to GPU technology: the radeon, r200 and r300 classic drivers and r300g, r600g and radeonsi Gallium3D drivers:\n\nAn up-to-date feature matrix is available, and there is support for Video Coding Engine and Unified Video Decoder. The free and open-source Radeon graphics device drivers are not reverse-engineered, but are based on documentation released by AMD without the requirement to sign a non-disclosure agreement (NDA). Documentation began to be gradually released in 2007. This is in contrast to AMD's main competitor in the graphics field, Nvidia, which has a proprietary driver similar to AMD Catalyst but provides no support to free-graphics initiatives.\n\nIn addition to providing the necessary documentation, AMD employees contribute code to support their hardware and features. At the 2014 Game Developers Conference, The company announced that they were exploring a strategy change to re-base the user-space part of Catalyst on a free and open-source DRM kernel module instead of their proprietary kernel blob.\n\nAll components of the Radeon graphics device driver are developed by core contributors and interested parties worldwide. In 2011, the r300g outperformed Catalyst in some cases.\n\nThe release of the AMDGPU stack was announced on the dri-devel mailing list in April 2015. Although AMDGPU only officially supports \"GCN\" 1.2 and later graphics cards, experimental support for GCN 1.0 and 1.1 graphics cards (which are only officially supported by the Radeon driver) may be enabled via a kernel parameter. A separate libdrm, libdrm-amdgpu, has been included since libdrm 2.4.63.\n\nNvidia's proprietary driver, Nvidia GeForce driver for GeForce, is available for Windows XP x86-x86-64 and later, Linux x86-x86-64-ARMv7-A, OS X 10.5 and later, Solaris x86-x86-64 and FreeBSD x86/x86-64. A current version can be downloaded from the Internet, and some Linux distributions contain it in their repositories. The beta Nvidia GeForce driver 331.13 supports the EGL interface, enabling support for Wayland in conjunction with this driver.\n\nNvidia's free and open-source driver is named nv. It is limited (supporting only 2D acceleration), and Matthew Garrett, Dirk Hohndel and others have called its source code confusing. Nvidia decided to deprecate nv, not adding support for Fermi or later GPUs and DisplayPort, in March 2010.\n\nIn December 2009, Nvidia announced they would not support free graphics initiatives. On The company announced that they would release some documentation of their GPUs.\n\nNouveau is based almost entirely on information gained through reverse engineering. This project aims to produce 3D acceleration for X.Org/Wayland using Gallium3D. On March 26, 2012, Nouveau's DRM component was marked stable and promoted from the staging area of the Linux kernel. Nouveau supports Tesla- (and earlier), Fermi-, Kepler- and Maxwell-based GPUs. On , Nvidia employee Alexandre Courbot committed an extensive patch set which adds initial support for the GK20A (Tegra K1) to Nouveau. In June 2014, Codethink reportedly ran a Wayland-based Weston compositor with Linux kernel 3.15, using EGL and a \"100% open-source graphics driver stack\" on a Tegra K1. A feature matrix is available. In July 2014, Nouveau was unable to outperform the Nvidia GeForce driver due to missing re-clocking support. Tegra-re is a project which is working to reverse-engineer nVidia's VLIW-based Tegra series of GPUs that predate Tegra K1.\n\nNvidia distributes proprietary device drivers for Tegra through OEMs and as part of its Linux for Tegra (formerly L4T) development kit. Nvidia and a partner, Avionic Design, were working on submitting Grate (free and open-source drivers for Tegra) upstream of the mainline Linux kernel in April 2012.\nThe company's co-founder and CEO laid out the Tegra processor roadmap with Ubuntu Unity at the 2013 GPU Technology Conference.\n\nNvidia's Unified Memory driver (nvidia-uvm.ko), which implements memory management for Pascal and Volta GPUs on Linux, is MIT licensed. The source code is available in the Nvidia Linux driver downloads on systems that support nvidia-uvm.ko.\n\nIntel has a history of producing (or commissioning) open-source drivers for its graphics chips, with the exception of their PowerVR-based chips. Their 2D X.Org driver is called xf86-video-intel. The kernel mode-setting driver in the Linux kernel does not use the video BIOS for switching video modes; since some BIOSes have a limited range of modes, this provides more reliable access to those supported by Intel video cards.\n\nThe company worked on optimizing their free Linux drivers for performance approaching their Windows counterparts, especially on Sandy Bridge and newer hardware where performance optimizations have allowed the Intel driver to outperform their proprietary Windows drivers in certain tasks, in 2011. Some of the performance enhancements may also benefit users of older hardware.\n\nSupport for Intel's LLC (Last Level Cache, L4-Cache, Crystalwell and Iris Pro) was added in Linux kernel 3.12, and the company has 20 to 30 full-time Linux graphics developers.\n\nMatrox develops and manufactures the Matrox Mystique, Parhelia, G200, G400 and G550. Although the company provides free and open-source drivers for their chipsets which are older than the G550; chipsets newer than the G550 are supported by a closed-source driver.\n\nS3 Graphics develops the S3 Trio, ViRGE, Savage and Chrome, supported by OpenChrome.\n\nArm Holdings is a fabless semiconductor company which licenses semiconductor intellectual property cores. Although they are known for the licensing the ARM instruction set and CPUs based on it, they also develop and license the Mali series of GPUs. On January 21, 2012, Phoronix reported that Luc Verhaegen was driving a reverse-engineering attempt aimed at the Arm Holdings Mali series of GPUs (specifically, the Mali-200 and Mali-400 versions). The reverse-engineering project, known as Lima, was presented at FOSDEM on February 4, 2012. On February 2, 2013, Verhaegen demonstrated Quake III Arena in timedemo mode, running on top of the Lima driver. In May 2018, a Lima developer posted the driver for inclusion in the Linux kernel. As of May 2019, the Lima driver is part of the mainline Linux kernel.\n\nPanfrost is a reverse-engineered driver effort for Mali Txxx (Midgard) and Gxx (Bifrost) GPUs. Introducing Panfrost talk was presented at X.Org Developer's Conference 2018. As of May 2019, the Panfrost driver is part of the mainline Linux kernel.\n\nARM has indicated no intention of providing support for their graphics acceleration hardware licensed under a free and open-source license. However, ARM employees sent patches for the Linux kernel to support their ARM HDLCD display controller and Mali DP500, DP550 and DP650 SIP blocks in December 2015 and April 2016.\n\nImagination Technologies is a fabless semiconductor company which develops and licenses semiconductor intellectual property cores, among which are the PowerVR GPUs. Intel has manufactured a number of PowerVR-based GPUs. PowerVR GPUs are widely used in mobile SoCs. The company does not provide a FOSS driver or public documentation for the PowerVR. Due to its wide use in embedded devices, the Free Software Foundation has put reverse-engineering of the PowerVR driver on its high-priority project list.\n\nVivante Corporation is a fabless semiconductor company which licenses semiconductor intellectual property cores and develops the GCxxxx series of GPUs. A Vivante proprietary, closed-source Linux driver consists of kernel- and user-space parts. Although the kernel component is open-source (GPL), the user-space components—consisting of the GLES(2) implementations and a HAL library—are not; these contain the bulk of the driver logic.\n\nWladimir J. van der Laan found and documented the state bits, command stream and shader ISA by studying how the blobs work, examining and manipulating command-stream dumps. The Etnaviv Gallium3D driver is being written based on this documentation. Van der Laan's work was inspired by the Lima driver, and the project has produced a functional-but-unoptimized Gallium3D LLVM driver. The Etnaviv driver has performed better than Vivante's proprietary code in some benchmarks, and it supports Vivante's GC400, GC800, GC1000, GC2000, GC3000 and GC7000 series. In January 2017, Etnaviv was added to Mesa with both OpenGL ES 2.0 and Desktop OpenGL 2.1 support.\n\nQualcomm develops the Adreno (formerly ATI Imageon) mobile GPU series, and includes it as part of their Snapdragon mobile SoC series. Phoronix and Slashdot reported in 2012 that Rob Clark, inspired by the Lima driver, was working on reverse-engineering drivers for the Adreno GPU series. In a referenced blog post, Clark wrote that he was doing the project in his spare time and that the Qualcomm platform was his only viable target for working on open 3D graphics. His employers (Texas Instruments and Linaro) were affiliated with the Imagination PowerVR and ARM Mali cores, which would have been his primary targets; he had working command streams for 2D support, and 3D commands seemed to have the same characteristics. The driver code was published on Gitorious \"freedreno\",\nand has been moved to Mesa. In 2012, a working shader assembler was completed;\ndemonstration versions were developed for texture mapping and phong shading, using the reverse-engineered shader compiler.\nClark demonstrated Freedreno running desktop compositing, the XBMC media player and Quake III Arena at FOSDEM on February 2, 2013.\n\nIn August 2013, the kernel component of freedreno (MSM driver) was accepted into mainline and is available in Linux kernel 3.12 and later. The DDX driver gained support for server-managed file descriptors requiring X.Org Server version 1.16 and above in July 2014. In January 2016, the Mesa Gallium3D-style driver gained support for Adreno 430; in November of that year, the driver added support for the Adreno 500 series. Freedreno can be used on devices such as 96Boards Dragonboard 410c and Nexus 7 (2013) in traditional Linux distributions (like Debian and Fedora) and on Android.\n\nBroadcom develops and designs the VideoCore GPU series as part of their SoCs. Since it is used by the Raspberry Pi, there has been considerable interest in a FOSS driver for VideoCore. The Raspberry Pi Foundation, in co-operation with Broadcom, announced on October 24, 2012 that they open-sourced \"all the ARM (CPU) code that drives the GPU\". However, the announcement was misleading; according to the author of the reverse-engineered Lima driver, the newly open-sourced components only allowed message-passing between the ARM CPU and VideoCore but offered little insight into Videocore and little additional programability. The Videocore GPU runs an RTOS which handles the processing; video acceleration is done with RTOS firmware coded for its proprietary GPU, and the firmware was not open-sourced on that date. Since there was neither a toolchain targeting the proprietary GPU nor a documented instruction set, no advantage could be taken if the firmware source code became available. The Videocoreiv project attempted to document the VideoCore GPUs.\n\nOn February 28, 2014 (the Raspberry Pi's second anniversary), Broadcom and the Raspberry Pi Foundation announced the release of full documentation for the VideoCore IV graphics core and a complete source release of the graphics stack under a 3-clause BSD license. The free-license 3D graphics code was committed to Mesa on 29 August 2014, and first appeared on Mesa's 10.3 release.\n\nAlthough Silicon Integrated Systems and VIA Technologies have expressed limited interest in open-source drivers, both have released source code which has been integrated into X.Org by FOSS developers. In July 2008, VIA opened documentation of their products to improve its image in the Linux and open-source communities. The company has failed to work with the open-source community to provide documentation and a working DRM driver, leaving expectations of Linux support unfulfilled. On January 6, 2011, it was announced that VIA was no longer interested in supporting free graphics initiatives.\n\nDisplayLink announced an open-source project, Libdlo, with the goal of bringing support for their USB graphics technology to Linux and other platforms. Its code is available under the LGPL license, but it has not been integrated into an X.Org driver. DisplayLink graphics support is available through the kernel udlfb driver (with fbdev) in mainline and udl/drm driver, which in March 2012 was only available in the drm-next tree.\n\nNon-hardware-related vendors may also assist free graphics initiatives. Red Hat has two full-time employees (David Airlie and Jérôme Glisse) working on Radeon software, and the Fedora Project sponsors a Fedora Graphics Test Week event before the launch of their new Linux distribution versions to test free graphics drivers. Other companies which have provided development or support include Novell and VMware.\n\nProject VGA aims to create a low-budget, open-source VGA-compatible video card.\nThe Open Graphics Project aims to create an open-hardware GPU. The Open Graphics Device v1 has dual DVI-I outputs and a 100-pin IDC connector. In September 2010, the first 25 OGD1 boards were made available for grant application and purchase. The Milkymist system on a chip, targeted at embedded graphics instead of desktop computers, supports a VGA output, a limited vertex shader and a 2D texturing unit.\n\nThe Nyuzi, an experimental GPGPU processor, includes a synthesizable hardware design written in System Verilog, an instruction set emulator, an LLVM-based C-C++ compiler, software libraries and tests and explores parallel software and hardware. It can run on a Terasic DE2-115 field-programmable gate array board.\n\nIf a project uses FPGAs, it generally has a partially (or completely) closed-source toolchain. There are currently a couple of open-source toolchains available, however, for Lattice-based FPGAs (notably for iCE40 and ECP5 boards) which utilize Project IceStorm, and Trellis, respectively. There is also a larger, ongoing effort to create the \"GCC of FPGAs\" called SymbiFlow which includes the aforementioned FPGA toolchains as well as an early-stage open-source toolchain for Xilinx-based FPGAs.\n\n\n"}

He was widely known as \"Commander Ellsberg\".\n\nEllsberg was born in New Haven, Connecticut, and grew up in Colorado. He was one of the very few Jews who were accepted into the United States Naval Academy, which graduated him with a Bachelor of Science degree in 1914. He earned his Master of Science degree from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1920. He received an honorary Eng.D. from University of Colorado at Boulder in 1929.\n\nEllsberg was commissioned in the navy in 1914 and served on active duty until 1926. He became an expert in undersea salvage and rescue. In 1926, he raised the navy submarine, \"S-51\". For that success he was promoted to the rank of commander by an Act of Congress and awarded the Distinguished Service Medal by the Navy Department, since which time he has been popularly known as \"Commander Ellsberg\", regardless of his rank. Ellsberg described the raising of the S-51 in his 1929 book, \"On the Bottom\".\n\nOn June 1, 1918, Ellsberg married Lucy Buck. In letters to her he signed his name as \"Ned\". Lucy Ellsberg bore their daughter Mary on 29 August 1921.\n\nAfter leaving active duty, Ellsberg worked for the Tide Water Oil Company and began writing books about his exploits and about historical events.\n\nIn December 1927, Ellsberg volunteered for active duty to rescue survivors trapped in the sunken submarine \"S-4\". The rescue efforts failed and Ellsberg returned home in early January 1928.\n\nEllsberg's 1931 book, \"Pigboats\", inspired the 1933 movie, \"Hell Below\", starring Robert Montgomery, Robert Young, Walter Huston, and Madge Evans.\n\nHis book \"Hell on Ice\" was adapted for an episode of Orson Welles's \"The Mercury Theatre on the Air\" that aired October 9, 1938, on CBS Radio. An adaptation was also presented on Welles's \"The Mercury Summer Theatre of the Air\", broadcast August 9, 1946.\n\nImmediately after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, Ellsberg rejoined the navy. His first assignment was to conduct salvage operations at the newly liberated port of Massawa, Eritrea. Working in beastly heat with virtually no staff and poor administrative support, Ellsberg salvaged a large floating dry dock and several of the ships that had been sunk to block the harbor.\n\nEllsberg returned the port to operation and the ships salvaged were added to the Allies' merchant fleets. During his work in Massawa, Ellsberg reported to the Lend Lease coordinator in Cairo, Egypt, US Army Major General Russell Maxwell. Ellsberg renamed the \"SS Liebenfels\", a large German freighter, salvaged and refitted at Massawa, the \"General Russell Maxwell\". He described the salvage of the port of Massawa in his book \"Under the Red Sea Sun\". Ellsberg was promoted to captain by presidential order on June 19, 1942. The next year he was awarded the Legion of Merit by U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt in honor of his salvage efforts in Massawa.\n\nIn \"Under the Red Sea Sun\", Ellsberg complained that the American contractor that was assigned to give him administrative support was very unhelpful, but he did not name that company. The company, Johnson, Drake & Piper, Inc., itself claimed credit for clearing the port in the privately printed book, \"Middle East War Projects of Johnson, Drake & Piper, Inc., for the Corps of Engineers, U.S. Army, 1942–1943\" (New York: Johnson, Drake & Piper, Inc., 1943). That book contains beautiful photographs and drawings showing projects around the Middle East.\n\nFrom Massawa, Ellsberg went to North Africa to become Principal Salvage Officer in that theater. He worked under Admiral Andrew Cunningham, the British officer commanding naval forces in the area. Ellsberg's activities were detailed in his book \"No Banners, No Bugles\".\n\nEllsberg, worn out from constant work, was ordered home in early 1943 to recuperate.\n\nAfter a time inspecting ship construction activities, Ellsberg was sent to England in time for the Normandy Invasion, where he was instrumental in setting up the Mulberry harbour off the Normandy Beach. He also prepared 89 damaged or superannuated ships for scuttling to make artificial harbors. That operation gained him great admiration in Britain where he was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE). Ellsberg described his experiences in his book, \"The Far Shore\".\n\nHe rose to the rank of rear admiral before he retired from active duty in 1951 to enjoy Maine and Florida with his wife of 33 years. He continued to write, to lecture, and to consult on engineering projects. He died in 1983 at the age of 91, and is buried in Willimantic, Connecticut.\nRear Admiral Ellsberg´s ribbon bar:\n\nWriting was an Ellsberg hobby. He wrote many articles and reports. His books include the following:\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2226141", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2226141", "title": "Springbok Radio", "text": "Springbok Radio\n\nSpringbok Radio was a South African radio station that operated from 1950 to 1985.\n\nSABC's decision in December 1945 to develop a commercial service was constrained by post-war financial issues. After almost five years of investigation and after consulting Lord Reith of the BBC and the South African government, it decided to introduce commercial radio to supplement the SABC's public service English and Afrikaans networks and help solve the SABC's financial problems. The SABC would build the equipment and facilities and would place them at the disposal of advertisers and their agencies at cost for productions and allow them to make use of SABC's production staff.\n\nOn 1 May 1950, the first commercial radio station in South Africa, Springbok Radio, took to the air. Bilingual in English and Afrikaans, it broadcast from the Johannesburg Centre for 113 and a half hours a week. The service proved so popular with advertisers at its launch that commercial time had been booked well in advance. The service started at 6:43am with the music \"Vat Jou Goed en Trek, Ferreira\". The first voice on air was that of Eric Egan, well remembered for his daily \"Corny Crack\" and catch phrase \"I Love You\".\n\nMany drama programmes during the 1950s were imported from Australia but as more funding became available, Springbok Radio produced almost all its programmes within South Africa through a network of independent production houses. By the end of 1950, 30 per cent of Springbok Radio shows were produced by South African talent or material and independent productions were sold to sponsors. At the same time all air time had been sold or used and transmission time was extended. By the end of 1950 the revenue of Springbok Radio was £205,439, in 1961 it had grown to over two million Rand and by 1970 had reached R6.5 million.\n\nBy 1985, Springbok Radio was operating at a heavy loss. After losing listeners with the handing over of its shortwave frequencies to Radio 5 and facing competition from television, despite the late arrival of the medium in 1976, it ceased broadcasting on 31 December 1985.\n\nSpringbok Radio's programme schedules reflected the white, primarily English-speaking, suburban lifestyle of the period, when many women were housewives. Weekday schedules broadly comprised a breakfast session (05:00 - 08:30), women's programmes (08:30 - 14:00), Afrikaans soap operas (14:00 - 16:15), teatime chat shows (16:15 - 16:45), children's programmes (16:45-18:15), dinnertime programmes (18:15 - 19:00), the main news bulletin (19:00 - 19:15), and family shows (19:15 - 24:00). Saturday programmes were generally light: music, sitcoms and quizzes. Sunday was more sedate: music, chat shows, requests for the armed forces (during the 1970s and 1980s), news commentary and drama.\n\nProgrammes included:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBased in Johannesburg, South Africa, this was a non-profit organisation which had collected and archived all sorts of material including sound recordings and photographs related to Springbok Radio. It housed the biggest sound recording archive of the station in the world and was an internationally recognized sound archive. The Society was formed in 2002 by Frans Erasmus in Johannesburg. The archive held many original recordings on tape, reel to reel and transcription discs and also has many private off-air recordings of the station. The society was engaged in a restoration project, transferring the analogue recordings to a digital format. On 1 July 2008, this Society launched Springbok Radio Digital, a service where many of the restored programmes can be heard.\n\nOn 8 May 2012, the archives of the Society was handed over to the SABC Sound Archive.\n\nThe Springbok Radio Preservation Society website currently broadcasts an eight hour weekday programme (Monday 06:00 to Friday 06:00) and a weekend programme (Friday 06:00 to Monday 06:00). The programming is distinct from that of the SABC's Springbok Radio Digital listed below.\n\nThis is a creation of the Springbok Radio Preservation Society of South Africa with assistance from the SABC, in which certain of the Society's restored programmes are streamed. The service started operating on 1 October 2008 and operates a 12-hour service from Mondays to Sundays, repeated four times. The service concentrates on presenting a selection of old time Springbok Radio programing restored and preserved at the Springbok Radio Preservation Society Archive.\n\nSpringbok Radio Digital was officially handed over to the SABC Sound Archive on 8 May 2012.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2226150", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2226150", "title": "Laminin", "text": "Laminin\n\nLaminins are high-molecular weight (~400 to ~900 kDa) proteins of the extracellular matrix. They are a major component of the basal lamina (one of the layers of the basement membrane), a protein network foundation for most cells and organs. The laminins are an important and biologically active part of the basal lamina, influencing cell differentiation, migration, and adhesion.\n\nLaminins are heterotrimeric proteins that contain an α-chain, a β-chain, and a γ-chain, found in five, four, and three genetic variants, respectively. The laminin molecules are named according to their chain composition. Thus, laminin-511 contains α5, β1, and γ1 chains. Fourteen other chain combinations have been identified in vivo. The trimeric proteins intersect to form a cross-like structure that can bind to other cell membrane and extracellular matrix molecules. The three shorter arms are particularly good at binding to other laminin molecules, which allows them to form sheets. The long arm is capable of binding to cells, which helps anchor organized tissue cells to the membrane.\n\nThe laminin family of glycoproteins are an integral part of the structural scaffolding in almost every tissue of an organism. They are secreted and incorporated into cell-associated extracellular matrices. Laminin is vital for the maintenance and survival of tissues. Defective laminins can cause muscles to form improperly, leading to a form of muscular dystrophy, lethal skin blistering disease (junctional epidermolysis bullosa) and defects of the kidney filter (nephrotic syndrome).\n\nFifteen laminin trimers have been identified. The laminins are combinations of different alpha-, beta-, and gamma-chains.\n\n\nLaminins were previously numbered as they were discovered, i.e. laminin-1, laminin-2, laminin-3, etc., but the nomenclature was changed to describe which chains are present in each isoform (laminin-111, laminin-211, etc.). In addition, many laminins had common names before either laminin nomenclature was in place.\n\nLaminins form independent networks and are associated with type IV collagen networks via entactin, fibronectin, and perlecan. They also bind to cell membranes through integrin receptors and other plasma membrane molecules, such as the dystroglycan glycoprotein complex and Lutheran blood group glycoprotein. Through these interactions, laminins critically contribute to cell attachment and differentiation, cell shape and movement, maintenance of tissue phenotype, and promotion of tissue survival. Some of these biological functions of laminin have been associated with specific amino-acid sequences or fragments of laminin. For example, the peptide sequence [GTFALRGDNGDNGQ], which is located on the alpha-chain of laminin, promotes adhesion of endothelial cells.\n\nLaminin alpha4 is distributed in a variety of tissues including peripheral nerves, dorsal root ganglion, skeletal muscle and capillaries; in the neuromuscular junction, it is required for synaptic specialisation. The structure of the laminin-G domain has been predicted to resemble that of pentraxin.\n\nLaminin-111 is a major substrate along which nerve axons will grow, both in vivo and in vitro. For example, it lays down a path that developing retinal ganglion cells follow on their way from the retina to the tectum. It is also often used as a substrate in cell culture experiments. The presence of laminin-1 can influence how the growth cone responds to other cues. For example, growth cones are repelled by netrin when grown on laminin-111, but are attracted to netrin when grown on fibronectin. This effect of laminin-111 probably occurs through a lowering of intracellular cyclic AMP.\n\nLaminins are enriched at the lesion site after peripheral nerve injury and are secreted by Schwann cells. Neurons of the peripheral nervous system express integrin receptors that attach to laminins and promote neuroregeneration after injury.\n\nDysfunctional structure of one particular laminin, laminin-211, is the cause of one form of congenital muscular dystrophy. Laminin-211 is composed of an α2, a β1 and a γ1 chains. This laminin's distribution includes the brain and muscle fibers. In muscle, it binds to alpha dystroglycan and integrin alpha7—beta1 via the G domain, and via the other end it binds to the extracellular matrix.\n\nAbnormal laminin-332, which is essential for epithelial cell adhesion to the basement membrane, leads to a condition called junctional epidermolysis bullosa, characterized by generalized blisters, exuberant granulation tissue of skin and mucosa, and pitted teeth.\n\nMalfunctional laminin-521 in the kidney filter causes leakage of protein into the urine and nephrotic syndrome.\n\nSome of the laminin isoforms have been implicated in cancer pathophysiology. The majority of transcripts that harbor an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) are involved in cancer development via corresponding proteins. A crucial event in tumor progression referred to as epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) allows carcinoma cells to acquire invasive properties. The translational activation of the extracellular matrix component laminin B1 (LAMB1) during EMT has been recently reported suggesting an IRES-mediated mechanism. In this study, the IRES activity of LamB1 was determined by independent bicistronic reporter assays. Strong evidences exclude an impact of cryptic promoter or splice sites on IRES-driven translation of LamB1. Furthermore, no other LamB1 mRNA species arising from alternative transcription start sites or polyadenylation signals were detected that account for its translational control. Mapping of the LamB1 5'-untranslated region (UTR) revealed the minimal LamB1 IRES motif between -293 and -1 upstream of the start codon. Notably, RNA affinity purification showed that the La protein interacts with the LamB1 IRES. This interaction and its regulation during EMT were confirmed by ribonucleoprotein immunoprecipitation. In addition, La was able to positively modulate LamB1 IRES translation. In summary, these data indicate that the LamB1 IRES is activated by binding to La which leads to translational upregulation during hepatocellular EMT.\n\nTogether with other major components of the ECM, such as collagens and fibronectin, laminins have been used to enhance mammalian cell culture, especially in the case of pluripotent stem cells, as well as some primary cell cultures, which can be difficult to propagate on other substrates. Two types of naturally-sourced laminins are commercially available. Laminin-111 extracted from mouse sarcomas is one popular laminin type, as well as laminin mixtures from human placenta, which may primarily correspond to laminin-211, 411 or 511, depending on the provider. The various laminin isoforms are practically impossible to isolate from tissues in pure form due to extensive cross-linking and the need for harsh extraction conditions, such as proteolytic enzymes or low pH, that cause degradation. Therefore, recombinant laminins have been produced since the year 2000. This made it possible to test if laminins could have a significant role \"in vitro\" as they have in the human body. In 2008, two groups independently showed that mouse embryonic stem cells can be grown for months on top of recombinant laminin-511. Later, Rodin \"et al.\" showed that recombinant laminin-511 can be used to create a totally xeno-free and defined cell culture environment to culture human pluripotent ES cells and human iPS cells.\n\nLaminins contain several conserved protein domains.\n\nLaminins are trimeric molecules; laminin-1 is an alpha1 beta1 gamma1 trimer. It has been suggested that the domains I and II from laminin A, B1 and B2 may come together to form a triple helical coiled-coil structure.\n\nThe laminin B domain (also known as domain IV) is an extracellular module of unknown function. It is found in a number of different proteins that include, heparan sulphate proteoglycan from basement membrane, a laminin-like protein from \"Caenorhabditis elegans\" and laminin. Laminin IV domain is not found in short laminin chains (alpha4 or beta3).\n\nBeside different types of globular domains each laminin subunit contains, in its first half, consecutive repeats of about 60 amino acids in length that include eight conserved cysteines. The tertiary structure of this domain is remotely similar in its N-terminus to that of the EGF-like module. It is also known as a 'LE' or 'laminin-type EGF-like' domain. The number of copies of the laminin EGF-like domain in the different forms of laminins is highly variable; from 3 up to 22 copies have been found. In mouse laminin gamma-1 chain, the seventh LE domain has been shown to be the only one that binds with a high affinity to nidogen. The binding-sites are located on the surface within the loops C1-C3 and C5-C6. Long consecutive arrays of laminin EGF-like domains in laminins form rod-like elements of limited flexibility, which determine the spacing in the formation of laminin networks of basement membranes.\n\nThe laminin globular (G) domain, also known as the LNS (Laminin-alpha, Neurexin and Sex hormone-binding globulin) domain, is on average 177 amino acids in length and can be found in one to six copies in various laminin family members as well as in a large number of other extracellular proteins. For example, all laminin alpha-chains have five laminin G domains, all collagen family proteins have one laminin G domain, the CNTNAP proteins have four laminin G domains, while neurexin 1 and 2 each hold six laminin G domains. On average, approximately one quarter of the proteins that hold laminin G domains is taken up by these laminin G domains themselves. The smallest laminin G domain can be found in one of the collagen proteins (COL24A1; 77 AA) and the largest domain in TSPEAR (219 AA).\n\nThe exact function of the Laminin G domains has remained elusive, and a variety of binding functions has been ascribed to different Laminin G modules. For example, the laminin alpha1 and alpha2 chains each have five C-terminal laminin G domains, where only domains LG4 and LG5 contain binding sites for heparin, sulphatides and the cell surface receptor dystroglycan. Laminin G-containing proteins appear to have a wide variety of roles in cell adhesion, signalling, migration, assembly and differentiation.\n\nBasement membrane assembly is a cooperative process in which laminins polymerise through their N-terminal domain (LN or domain VI) and anchor to the cell surface through their G domains. Netrins may also associate with this network through heterotypic LN domain interactions. This leads to cell signalling through integrins and dystroglycan (and possibly other receptors) recruited to the adherent laminin. This LN domain-dependent self-assembly is considered to be crucial for the integrity of basement membranes, as highlighted by genetic forms of muscular dystrophy containing the deletion of the LN module from the alpha 2 laminin chain. The laminin N-terminal domain is found in all laminin and netrin subunits except laminin alpha 3A, alpha 4 and gamma 2.\n\nLAMA1; LAMA2; LAMA3; LAMA4; LAMA5;\n\nLAMA1; LAMA2; LAMA3; LAMA4; LAMA5;\n\nHSPG2; LAMA1; LAMA2; LAMA3; LAMA5; LAMC1; LAMC2; LAMC3;\n\nAGRIN; ATRN; ATRNL1; CELSR1; CELSR2; CELSR3; CRELD1; HSPG2;\nLAMA1; LAMA2; LAMA3; LAMA4; LAMA5; LAMB1; LAMB2; LAMB3;\nLAMB4; LAMC1; LAMC2; LAMC3; MEGF10; MEGF12; MEGF6;\nMEGF8; MEGF9; NSR1; NTN1; NTN2L; NTN4; NTNG1; NTNG2;\nRESDA1; SCARF1; SCARF2; SREC; STAB1; USH2A;\n\nAGRIN; CELSR1; CELSR2; CELSR3; CNTNAP1; CNTNAP2; CNTNAP3; CNTNAP3B; CNTNAP4;\nCNTNAP5; COL11A1; COL11A2; COL12A1; COL14A1; COL15A1; COL16A1; COL18A1; COL19A1; \nCOL20A1; COL21A1; COL22A1; COL24A1; COL27A1; COL5A1; COL5A3; COL9A1; CRB1; \nCRB2; CSPG4; EGFLAM; EYS; FAT; FAT2; FAT3; FAT4; GAS6; HSPG2; \nLAMA1; LAMA2; LAMA3; LAMA4; LAMA5; NELL1; NELL2; NRXN1; NRXN2; NRXN3;\nPROS1; SLIT1; SLIT2; SLIT3; SPEAR; THBS1; THBS2; THBS3; THBS4; USH2A;\n\nLAMA1; LAMA2; LAMA3; LAMA5; LAMB1; LAMB2; LAMB3; LAMB4;\nLAMC1; LAMC3; NTN1; NTN2L; NTN4; NTNG1; NTNG2; USH2A;\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2226159", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2226159", "title": "SonicStage", "text": "SonicStage\n\nSonicStage is the name for Sony software that is used for managing portable devices when they are plugged into a computer running Microsoft Windows. It comprises a music player and library manager, similar to iTunes, Windows Media Player and RealPlayer. It is used to manage the library of ATRAC OMG/OMA and MP3 recordings on a PC. It was first used in VAIO PCs put on the Japanese market in October 2001, and superseded OpenMG Jukebox. Version 2 was found on 2004 model products, and Version 3 on 2005 model products (Sony introduced native MP3 support on its music players in 2005).\n\nThe Sony Connect service was formerly used to purchase recordings online, and could be accessed from within the SonicStage program. However, Sony announced that on the 31 March 2008, its CONNECT download site would be going offline, therefore affecting SonicStage users.\n\nHowever, in late 2008, Sony launched a new online music store called \"bandit.fm\" on a trial basis for a small number of markets. It was expected that Sony would launch bandit.fm globally, however Sony never did this and closed the store in 2016. Japan exclusively uses the mora service.\n\nSonicStage is closely tied to a requirement that the program guard against copyright infractions. Sony music players have a write-only design. Somewhat similar to an Apple iPod, it is not generally possible to move tracks from the music player to the PC hard drive, and thereby from one music player to another. Some earlier models (such as some of the Net-MD line) could not even transfer voice recordings made by the user (with the player's microphone input) to their PC.\n\nCopy restriction is provided not by any one feature, but by a group of design features and software limitations. The main features being:\n\nAs of version 3.4, an intermediate update mostly for Hi-MD users, some of the above restrictions have been relaxed. SonicStage 3.4 allows tracks recorded via digital/analogue inputs on Hi-MD devices to be transferred back in WAV format. Also, files in Sony's proprietary ATRAC format can now be converted to WAV.\n\nSupport for MP3 files in both SonicStage and 2005 model devices is problematic. A 2005 model device may not be able to play some tracks. For example, it may not be able to play low bit rate MP3 tracks, (the ones that may be produced by an Internet radio station, or in a podcast).\n\nSonicStage will play ATRAC3 files directly from a digital music device when the latter is connected to the computer and detected by the software. SonicStage 3 does not play DRM-wrapped MP3 files directly from the device.\nMany bugs, however, are corrected and addressed.\n\nVersion 1.5 adds the native support for ATRAC3plus and Windows Media Audio (WMA). And addition, MP3 encoding plug-in was sold on Sony's on-line stores (SonyStyle Japan: ¥1,590), for their Palm device: CLIÉ. But those encoding function for WMA/MP3 was removed in SonicStage Version 2.0 (SS2.0 supports only the decoding function).\n\nThis is the last version of SonicStage before native MP3 devices were introduced by Sony.\nMP3 is supported by converting the mp3 file to ATRAC format and downloading that file to the device.\n\nThe v2 library manager is \"benign\" in that it sits on top of what is already on the hard drive, and doesn't change what is already there (It will change a file name if the user has configured it as such.) Users can tell it an album exists in a directory, and import that group of files as an album without having the program change the header information in the tracks.\n\nVersion 3 uses the header information in the tracks to get album, artist and track name information.\nThe tracks are placed in the database according to what is in the tracks. When the header fields in a track are blank, the program imports the track into the unnamed album (No name, no artist, no album). As a consequence, when importing tracks, many albums are placed into the album called \"Unnamed\".\n\nTracks under digital rights management cannot be changed, and neither can tracks with a missing source link.\n\nAs noted above, Version 3 lacks an \"Import Album\" feature. SonicStage v3 classifies tracks according to the album-related information present in their headers.\n\n2 GB memory sticks are not supported.\n\nSony have added the option to drop DRM on ripped files in SonicStage v3.3.\n\nSonicStage 3.4 includes an option to de-DRM an entire library (the larger it is, the longer it takes) allowing unlimited transfer and playback on PCs. Users can share non-DRM files with other people.\n\nThe option to de-DRM files does not work on unplayable OMA files.\n\nSonicStage 3.4 does operate on Windows Vista after some manual driver installations.\n\nAdds the ability to import AACLC, as well as HE-AAC.\n\nThe main downside is that a number of features, such as the ability to recover from corrupt track lists, are still missing. Restrictions on what non administrator users could do were due to restrictions imposed by Windows XP and earlier. These restrictions are not present with Windows Vista and later.\n\nVersion 4.3 (SonicStage CP) adds Windows Vista compatibility (Vista 64-bit and Windows 7 64-bit are not officially supported but Sonicstage will run, though there are no drivers for the hardware). As of October 2008, this is the latest version of the English (and other non-Japanese language) SonicStage. From March 29, 2013 onwards this version is no longer available for download from Sony website.\n\nVersion 4.4, released on January 10, 2008 (only in Japan), added HE-AAC transfer function for new walkmans.\n\nSonicStage V is the latest version of the Japanese SonicStage, and features a new user interface like SonicStage for LISMO. Version 5.0 released on October 9, 2008 in Japan. On 9 Feb 2009, version 5.1 was released.\n\nSonicStage V does not work with the Hi-MD/Net MD Walkmans, MP3-CD/ATRAC-CD players (such as CD Walkmans) and other old devices.\n\nSonicStage for LISMO is a stripped-down version of Japanese SonicStage CP, and is a part of the \"LISMO Port\" suite. Version 1.0 was released on February 1, 2008. SonicStage for LISMO developed for a new ATRAC service () of LISMO, the online music store provided by a Japanese mobile phone operator KDDI (au). There are some useful functions to using LISMO, but little value for non-LISMO users. The playable codecs are same as SonicStage Version 4.x, but encoding functions are only available for the ATRAC codecs.\n\nAs of October 2008, 16 au phones (manufactured by Casio Hitachi Mobile Communications, Kyocera, Sanyo, Sharp, Sony Ericsson and Toshiba) support LISMO's ATRAC service.\n\nSony offers the MP3 File Manager for Network Walkmans as a very limited alternative to SonicStage. It only provides a simple drag-and-drop interface and is lacking many of the newer, more advanced features of SonicStage (such as the ability to transfer files back to the computer).\n\nThe application is intended to be installed on the Network Walkman itself.\nAlthough it can be run directly on the device, it is not truly a portable application because it requires that the driver be installed on the computer.\n\nThe most recent version (2.0) can be downloaded from here or here. There is also an older version (1.2) for older Network Walkmans available here.\n\nAs mentioned in this forum, the VAIO Music Transfer software allows files to be dragged and dropped onto the player. It may still require SonicStage to be installed. It works with the NW-A700-series, NW-E00XF-series players as well as the NW-HD1 and NW-HD3.\n\nSony released an MP3 Conversion Tool in 2007. The MP3 Conversion Tool can be used to convert non-DRM protected ATRAC® format audio files stored in your computer to MP3 format audio files. To run the MP3 Conversion Tool, the OpenMG Secure Module is required (included with SonicStage). The tool can be downloaded from Sony's eSupport page, here.\n\n\nFor MiniDisc Walkman, the linux-minidisc project is working continuously to develop a free transfer software for all HiMD- and NetMD-Walkman. The software features a library \"libhimd\" for accessing HiMD-devices and a Qt-based GUI (\"QHiMDTransfer\") which both can be ported to many platforms, current versions are available for Linux, Windows and Macintosh computers. Currently, upload (i.e. transfer from the Walkman to the PC) of MP3s and PCM/ATRAC3/ATRAC3+-recordings (all HiMD Walkman) is possible, more functionality (downloads to the device, deleting, renaming tracks etc.) is being worked on. NetMD is supported as well (through a collection of Python scripts) in the form of downloads (all NetMD) and uploads (MZ-RH1 only). Especially the sophisticated debugging and reverse-engineering protection of OpenMG/AVLib made development tedious but linux-minidisc is the only software to provide this functionality to date. The project homepage can be found here.\n\n\n"}

He was born in Késmárk, Upper Hungary (today: Kežmarok, Slovakia). \n\nHe withdrew from military service temporarily in 1792 because of poor health, but in 1793, he was recalled to the Habsburg military in the Netherlands at the request of Field Marshal Prince Coburg and fought in the Flanders Campaign.\n\nIn 1799 he was appointed commander of the Austrian forces in Italy and Colonel-Proprietor of the Infantry Regiment N.34, a ceremonial position he held until his death. On 18 April 1799, Kray was promoted to Feldzeugmeister. In the 1800 campaign, Kray commanded the Austrian force on the Upper Rhine, charged with the defense of all approaches to Vienna through the German states. After being out-maneuvered by the French, he was disastrously defeated in five consecutive battles. After the Battle of Neuburg, the French acquired both shores of the river, and commanded access to the Danube waterway as far east as Regensburg. During the subsequent armistice, Emperor Francis II replaced Kray with his brother, Archduke John; Kray was discharged on 28 August 1800 and retired to Pest, Hungary. He died there on 19 January 1804. For all his victories, for his fierce competitiveness on the battlefield, the French soldiers referred to him as \"Le terrible Kray, le fils cher de la victoire\" and men from both sides attended his funeral in 1804.\n\nKray was born in Késmárk, Upper Hungary (today: Kežmarok, Slovakia). He was educated in mathematical and other military sciences in Schemnitz and Vienna. \n\nEntering the Austrian army at the age of nineteen in 1754 in the Infantry Regiment 31 \"Hallerstein\" and fought in the Seven Years' War. In 1778, he was promoted from grenadier captain to major and transferred to Infantry Regiment \"Preysach\" 39. After the War of Bavarian Succession, he transferred to the 2nd Szeckler Grenz (border) Infantry Regiment as lieutenant colonel. In 1784 he suppressed a Romanian peasants' uprising in Transylvania. Kray served in the Turkish wars of 1787-91. On 10 May 1788, he defeated a superior Turkish force of 5,000 men commanded by Osman Pazvantoğlu and Kara Mustapha Pasha on the borders of Transylvania. He later led the capture of the Krajova fortress; for this, he was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Military Order of Maria Theresa on 21 December 1789, in May of the following year, Kray was promoted Generalmajor and subsequently ennobled by Emperor Joseph II with the title of Freiherr \"von Krajow und Topolya\". In the Austro-Turkish War of 1787 to 1791 he saw active service at Porczeny and the Vulcan Pass.\n\nPromoted Major General in 1790, three years later Kray commanded the advance guard of the Allies under Prince Coburg, operating in Flanders and the Austrian Netherlands. He distinguished himself at Famars, Menin, Wissembourg, Charleroi, Fleurus, and, indeed, at almost every encounter in the Flanders Campaign with the armies of the French Republic. Promoted to Feldmarschalleutnant on 5 March 1796 Kray served in Archduke Charles's Army of the Lower Rhine. On 19 June, after the Battle of Wetzlar, he forced General Jean-Baptiste Kléber to withdraw from Uckerath. He also defeated French General of Division Jourdan in the clash at Limburg on 16 September. He then fought in various actions, including the victory at Amberg on 24 August, and at the Battle of Würzburg as a divisional commander, when he was largely responsible for the victory of Archduke Charles of Austria. On 19 September, he captured the mortally wounded General of Division François Séverin Marceau-Desgraviers, one of the ablest and bravest French commanders of the day; he returned the corpse to French lines with a guard of honor of the Bethlen Hussars N.35. On 4 March 1796 he received promotion to Lieutenant General (\"Feldmarschal-Leutnant\"). In the celebrated campaign of 1796, on the Rhine and Danube, he performed conspicuous service as a corps commander. In the following year, he was less successful, being defeated on the Lahn, and at Mainz. Worse, his command was surprised and defeated by the French General Louis-Lazarre Hoche in the Battle of Neuwied of 1797. Kray was accused of negligence; a courts-martial found him guilty and sentenced him to two weeks arrest. He requested to resign in protest but this was denied.\n\nKray commanded in Italy in 1799, and reconquered the plain of Lombardy from the French. He won a sharp action at Legnago on 26 March. For his victory over the French at the Battle of Magnano on 5 April, he was promoted Feldzeugmeister (artillery lieutenant general). This victory caused the French army to withdraw to the Adda River. Nevertheless, Kray was replaced when Michael von Melas arrived to take command of the Austrian forces. While the field army won two more major battles, Kray conducted the successful sieges of Peschiera del Garda and Mantua. At the Battle of Novi, he commanded the divisions of Peter Ott and Heinrich Bellegarde. On 6 November, he was defeated by the French in a second clash at Novi Ligure.\n\nThe following year he commanded on the Rhine against Jean Moreau. As a consequence of his defeats at the battles of Stockach, Messkirch, Biberach, Iller River, and Höchstädt, Kray was driven into Ulm. However, by a skillful march round Moreau's flank he succeeded in escaping to Bohemia. After a 15 July truce became effective he was relieved of his command by Emperor Francis II and dismissed from the service. Kray's successor, Archduke John of Austria was disastrously defeated at the Battle of Hohenlinden in December.\n\nKray died in Pest, Hungary on 19 January 1804.\n\nKray was one of the best representatives of the old Austrian army. Tied to an obsolete system, and unable, from habit, to realize the changed conditions of warfare, he failed, but his enemies held him in the highest respect as a brave, skillful, and chivalrous opponent. It was he who, at Altenkirchen, cared for the dying Marceau (1796), and the white uniforms of Kray and his staff mingled with the blue of the French in the funeral procession of the young general of the Republic.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2226161", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2226161", "title": "Education in Bangladesh", "text": "Education in Bangladesh\n\nEducation in Bangladesh is overseen by the Bangladesh's Ministry of Education. Ministry of Primary and Mass Education are responsible for implementing policy for primary education and state-funded schools at a local level. In Bangladesh, all citizens must undertake twelve years of compulsory education which consists of eight years at primary school level and four years at high school level. Primary and secondary education is financed by the state and free of charge in public schools.\n\nBangladesh conforms fully to the UN's Education For All (EFA) objectives and the Millennium Development Goals (MDG) as well as other education-related international declarations. Article 17 of the Bangladesh Constitution provides that all children receive free and compulsory education.\n\nThe main education system is divided into three levels: \n\nAt all levels of schooling, students can choose to receive their education in English or Bangla. Private schools tend to make use of English-based study media while government-sponsored schools use Bangla.\n\nCadet Colleges are important in the education system of Bangladesh. A cadet college is a room and board collegiate administered by the Bangladesh. Military discipline is compulsory at all cadet colleges. Faujdarhat Cadet College is the first cadet college in Bangladesh, established in 1958 over an area of at Faujdarhat in the district of Chittagong. At present there are 12 cadet colleges in Bangladesh, including 3 cadet colleges for girls.\n\nAs of September 2019, tertiary education in Bangladesh takes place at 44 government, 101 private and 3 international universities. Students can choose to further their studies in Chartered Accountancy, engineering, technology, agriculture and medicine at a variety of universities and colleges.\n\nTable: Number of Primary Education Institution, Teacher and Student, 2018\n\nPrimary education\nThe overall responsibility of management of primary education lies with the Ministry of Primary and Mass Education (MOPME), set up as a Ministry in 1992. While MOPME is involved in formulation of policies, the responsibility of implementation rests with the Directorate of Primary Education (DPE) headed by a Director General. The Directorate of Primary Education (DPE) and its subordinate offices in the district and upazila are solely responsible for management and supervision of primary education. Their responsibilities include recruitment, posting, and transfer of teachers and other staff; arranging in-service training of teachers; distribution of free textbooks; and supervision of schools. The responsibility of school construction, repair and supply of school furniture lies with the DPE executed through the Local Government Engineering Department (LGED). The National Curriculum and Textbook Board (NCTB) is responsible for the development of curriculum and production of textbooks. While the Ministry of Education (MOE) is responsible for formulation of policies, the Directorate of Secondary and Higher Education (DSHE) under the Ministry of Education is responsible for implementing the same at secondary and higher education levels. The NCTB is responsible for developing curriculum and publishing standard textbooks.\n\nThe Directorate of Primary Education (DPE) are responsible for conducting the two public examinations:\n\nThe secondary level of education is controlled by the eight General Education boards:\n\nThe boards' headquarters are located in Barishal, Comilla Chittagong, Dhaka, Dinajpur Jessore, Rajshahi and Sylhet.\n\nEight region-based Boards of Intermediate and Secondary Education (BISE) are responsible for conducting the two public examinations:\n\nAt the school level, in the case of non-government secondary schools, School Management Committees (SMC), and at the intermediate college level, in the case of non-government colleges, Governing Bodies (GB), formed as per government directives, are responsible for mobilising resources, approving budgets, controlling expenditures, and appointing and disciplining staff. While teachers of non-government secondary schools are recruited by concerned SMCs observing relevant government rules, teachers of government secondary schools are recruited centrally by the DSHE through a competitive examination.\n\nIn government secondary schools, there is not an SMC. The headmaster is solely responsible for running the school and is supervised by the deputy director of the respective zone. Parent Teachers Associations (PTAs), however, exist to ensure a better teaching and learning environment.\n\nAt the tertiary level, universities are regulated by the University Grants Commission. The colleges providing tertiary education are under the National University. Each of the medical colleges is affiliated with a public university. Universities in Bangladesh are autonomous bodies administered by statutory bodies such as Syndicate, Senate, Academic Council, etc. in accordance with provisions laid down in their respective acts.\n\nThe Technical and Vocational Education System provides courses related to various applied and practical areas of science, technology and engineering, or focuses on a specific specialized area. Course duration ranges from one month to four years. The Technical Education Board controls technical and vocational training in the secondary level.\n\nThe Directorate of Technical Education (DTE) is responsible for the planning, development, and implementation of technical and vocational education in the country. Curriculum is implemented by BTEB. In the Technical Education System, after obtaining a Diploma-in-Engineering degree (four-year curriculum) from the institutes listed below, students can further pursue their educational career by obtaining a bachelor's degree from Engineering & Technology Universities. It normally it takes an additional two and a half to three years of coursework to obtain a bachelor's degree, although some students take more than three years to do so. They can then enroll in post-graduate studies. Students can also study CA (Chartered Accounting) after passing HSC or bachelor's degree and subject to fulfilling the entry criteria of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Bangladesh (ICAB).\n\n\nEnglish-medium schools are mainly private schools where all the courses are taught in English except one Bengali Language subject at ordinary level (O Level). These schools in Bangladesh follow the General Certificate of Education (GCE) syllabus where students are prepared for taking their Ordinary Level (O Level) and Advanced Level (A Level) examinations. The General Certificate of Education system is one of the most internationally recognised qualifications, based in the United Kingdom. The Ordinary and Advanced Level examinations are English equivalent to the Secondary School Certificate (SSC) and Higher Secondary School Certificate (HSC) examinations respectively. Most students sit for these exams from the registered schools in Bangladesh who follow the GCE syllabus. Those who do not attend a school that follows the GCE syllabus may also sit for their Ordinary and Advanced Level examinations from the British Council. These examinations are conducted under the supervision of the British Council in Bangladesh. The GCE examination conducted by the British Council takes place twice a year. Currently there are two boards operating from Bangladesh for Ordinary and Advanced Level Examinations, which are Edexcel and University of Cambridge International Examinations.\nBangladesh has recently opened English version schools translating board textbooks in English. In recent years national language policy has given top priority to English language education in Bangladesh \n\nThe Madrasah Education System focuses on religious education, teaching all the basics of education in a religious environment. Religious studies are taught in Arabic and the students in some areas also serve the local area masjids. Students also have to complete all the courses from the General Education System. Many privately licensed Madrasas take in homeless children and provide them with food, shelter and education, e.g. Jamia Tawakkulia Renga Madrasah in Sylhet.\nIn the Madrasah Education System there are two systems:\n\nOne, called the \"Quomi\" Madrasah system is privately owned and funded and is run according to the Deobandi system of Islamic education, which rejects the rational sciences.\n\nThe other, called the \"Alia\" madrasah system, is privately owned but subsidised by the government (the government spends 11.5% of its education budget on alia madrasahs, paying 80% of teacher and administrator salaries). Quomi madrasahs account for 1.9% of total primary enrollment and 2.2% of secondary enrollment; aliyah madrasahs account for 8.4% of primary and 19% of secondary enrollment. The alia system is like the general education system, except that Arabic is taught in addition to general education. The Madrasah Education Board covers religious education in government-registered Madrasahs in the secondary level. After passing \"Alim\", a student can enroll for 3 additional years to obtain a \"Fazil\" level. Students can go for further general education and earn a university degree. After passing successfully, they can further enroll for another 2 years to obtain a \"Kamil\" level degree. \n\nThe following table provides a statistical comparison of the \"Quomi\" and \"Alia\" madrasah systems.\n\nAs of 2020, approximately one-third of refugee Rohingya children were able to access primary education, primarily through temporary centers run by international organizations. UNICEF runs approximately 1,600 learning centers across the country, educating around 145,000 children. Beginning in April 2020, UNICEF and the Government of Bangladesh will enroll 10,000 Rohingya children in schools where they will be taught the Myanmar school curriculum.\n\nIn Bangladesh, grades equal or above 33% (or one third) is considered as a passing grade. Although by no means it is considered as a good grade.\nSince the education system of Bangladesh is completely controlled by the government up to higher secondary level (or grade 12), the grading system up to this point is more or less the same. For each subject, grades are converted in to grade points (GP) and are summed up and dived by the total number of subjects and thus is called Grade Point Average (GPA). The highest achievable GPA is 5.0. There is also a term called Letter Grade (LG) that indicates a range of GPA for total result or a single GP for a single subject. The grading system is shown below.\nHowever, in Secondary and Higher Secondary Level, a 4th subject or optional subject system is introduced. Although failing in the 4th subject will not be judged as a failure for the whole, Doing good in it can contribute to gain additional grade points. The additional grade points received is simply (GP in 4th subject) - 2. While counting GPA the algorithm can be simply written as\n\nHere, TGP is the total Grade EPoints gained in subjects other than optional. OGP is the additional GP gained in 4th subject. And N is the number of total subjects of course without optional.\n\nNote that GPA cannot be above 5. and Additional GP gained from the optional subject will not be counted if the GP of the subject is less than or equal to 2.\nGaining a GPA of 5.0 or A+ is naturally considered as a good result. However, since a student can gain grade far above the required 80% to receive a GPA of 5.0, the actual grades received in each subject is also included in the official mark sheets given by the education board for PSC, SSC and HSC exams. There is also an unofficial term called Golden A+ which means receiving A+ in all subjects, since a student can receive a perfect GPA also without gaining more than 80% marks in all subjects thanks to the 4th subject system.\n\nThere exists a substantial number of NGO-run non-formal schools, catering mainly to the drop-outs of the government and non-government primary schools. Very few NGOs, however, impart education for the full five-year primary education cycle. Because of this, on completion of their two-to-three-year non-formal primary education in NGO-run schools, students normally re-enter into government/non-government primary schools at higher classes.\n\nThere are Non-Governmental Schools (NGO) and Non-Formal Education Centers (NFE) and many of these are funded by the government. The largest NFE program is the much reputed BRAC program. However, not all NFE graduates continue on to secondary school.\n\nNGO-run schools differ from other non-government private schools. While the private schools operate like private enterprises often guided by commercial interests, NGO schools operate mainly in areas not served either by the government or private schools, essentially to meet the educational needs of vulnerable groups in the society. They usually follow an informal approach to suit the special needs of children from these vulnerable groups. But nowadays, some NGO schools are operating into places where there are both private and government schools.\n\nSimilarly, in NGO-run schools there does not exist any SMC. The style of management differs depending upon differences in policies pursued by different NGOs. Some are centrally managed within a highly bureaucratic set-up, while others enjoy considerable autonomy.\n\nDifferent NGOs pursue different policies regarding recruitment of teachers. Some prepare a panel of prospective teachers on the basis of a rigorous test and recruit teachers from this panel. Other NGOs recruit teachers rather informally from locally available interested persons.\n\nCurrent government projects to promote the education of children in Bangladesh include compulsory primary education for all, free education for girls up to grade 10, stipends for female students, a nationwide integrated education system and a food-for-education literacy movement. A large section of the country's national budget is set aside to help put these programs into action and to promote education and make it more accessible. Recent years have seen these efforts pay off and the Bangladesh education system is strides ahead of what it was only a few years ago. Now even national curriculum books from class 5 to class 12 are distributed freely among all students and schools.\n\nThe educational system of Bangladesh faces several problems. In the past, Bangladesh education was primarily a British modelled upper class affair with all courses given in English and very little being done for the common people. The Bangladesh education board has taken steps to leave such practices in the past and is looking forward to education as a way to provide a poverty-stricken nation with a brighter future.\nAs Bangladesh is an overpopulated country, there is a huge demand to turn its population into labour, which is why proper education is needed and proper help from government in the educational sectors of Bangladesh is crucial.\n\nPublic expenditure on education lies on the fringes of 2 percent of GDP with a minimum of 0.94 percent in 1980 and a maximum of 2.2 percent in 2007.\n\nThe Education system lacks a sound Human Resource Development and deployment system and this has demoralised the primary education sector personnel, including teachers, and contributes to poor performance. Poverty is a big threat to primary education. In Bangladesh, the population is very high. The number of seats available in colleges is less than the number of students who want to enroll, and the number of seats available in universities is also less than the number of students who passed higher secondary level and want to join in a university. Besides, the cost of education is increasing day by day, as a result many students are unable to afford it.\n\nOne study found a 15.5% primary school teacher absence rate.\n\nIn Bangladesh, gender discrimination in education occurs amongst the rural households but is non-existent amongst rich households. There is great difference in the success rates of boys, as compared to girls in Bangladesh. However, in recent years some progress has been made in trying to fix this problem.\n\nThe low performance in primary education is also matter of concern. School drop-out rates and grade repetition rates are high. Poor school attendance and low contact time in school are factors contributing to low level of learning achievement.\n\nMadrasah education in Bangladesh is heavily influenced by religion.\n\nBangladesh has one of the lowest literacy rates in Asia, estimated at 66.5% for males and 63.1% for females in 2014. Recently the literacy rate of Bangladesh has improved as it stands at 71% due to the modernization of schools and education funds.\n\n\n"}

It is the administrative center of the Zbarazh Raion (district), and is located in the historic region of Galicia. The current estimated population is around 13,000.\n\nZbarazh is one of the settings of Henryk Sienkiewicz's novel \"With Fire and Sword\" (1884) in which he gives a detailed description of the famous Siege of Zbarazh. Notable Jewish residents included rabbi Zev Wolf, the singer Velvel Zbarjer and the author Ida Fink.\n\nFirst attested in 1211 as a strong Ruthenian fortress, Zbarazh became a seat of the Gediminid princes Zbaraski towards the end of the 14th century. Ruins of the original castle are extant in the vicinity of modern Zbarazh.\n\nFollowing the 1569 Union of Lublin, Zbarazh became part of Kingdom of Poland's Krzemieniec County and Volhynian Voivodeship. After the first partition of Poland (1772), the town was seized by the Habsburg Monarchy, and remained in the province of Galicia until 1918. In the immediate post-World War I period, a Polish–Ukrainian War took place in Eastern Galicia. After the conflict, Zbarazh returned to Poland, becoming the seat of a county in Tarnopol Voivodeship. In the interbellum Second Polish Republic, it had the population of 8,000, with Jewish, Polish and Ukrainian communities.\n\nAfter the World War II, the town was annexed by the Soviet Union and is now part of Ukraine.\n\nThroughout the centuries, Zbarazh was the capital of the properties of the Zbaraski family. After the line had ended, the town was transferred to the Wiśniowiecki family. It also belonged to the Potocki family. The new Zbarazh Castle was designed for Prince Jeremi Wiśniowiecki in a post-Palladian Italian idiom similar to Scamozzi's by the Dutch architect van Peyen in 1626–31. The castle was partly rebuilt in the 18th century. A palace constructed for the family is located in the nearby town of Vyshnivets.\n\nZbarazh also preserves several remarkable churches, notably the Saviour Church (1600) and the Bernardine Monastery (1627). The Zbarazh Fortress was twice besieged by the Crimean Tatars (1474, 1589). After the second siege, a new castle was completed in 1626. In 1649, during the Khmelnytsky Uprising, the castle was besieged by the Cossacks and their Tatar allies. Defended for 43 days by Polish troops under Jeremi Wiśniowiecki (10 July–22 August), it was not captured.\n\nThe local Roman Catholic church was funded in the mid-17th century by Janusz Wisniowiecki. Destroyed by the Ottoman Turks in 1675, it was rebuilt in 1755, together with a new monastery. In the main nave of the church there was a commemorative plaque in memory of the 100th birth anniversary of Adam Mickiewicz. In the interbellum period, Bernardine monks from Zbaraz operated a middle school here. Both the church and monastery were not destroyed during World War II, after which local Poles were ordered to move to the Recovered Territories, and Soviet authorities began a process of devastation. In the monastery a hospital, later a plant were located, while the church was turned into a warehouse. Some items were saved by the Polish residents, who removed and took them to Poland in 1945. Currently, these items are kept in Bernardine churches in Leżajsk, Rzeszów and Alwernia.\n\nAfter the collapse of the Communist system, the church was handed back to the monks. A first service took place on 3 September 2000.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2226168", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2226168", "title": "Uşak", "text": "Uşak\n\nUşak () is a city in the interior part of the Aegean Region of Turkey. The city has a population of 500,000 (2016 census) and is the capital of Uşak Province. The city was previously known by its Greek name of Ousakeion/Ουσάκειον.\n\nUşak city is situated at a distance of from İzmir, the region's principal metropolitan center and port city. Benefiting from its location at the crossroads of the Central Anatolian plateau and the coastal Aegean Region, and from a climate and agricultural production incorporating elements of both of these zones, Uşak has also traditionally had a strong industrial base. Uşak was the first city in Turkey to have an urban electricity network, and the first city where a collective labor relations agreement was signed, during the Ottoman era, between leather industry employees and workers. It was here that the first factory of Republican Turkey, a sugar refinery, was set up through a private sector initiative among local businessmen. The tradition of industriousness continues today around two industrial zones.\n\nThe first known organized states to have ruled over the region of present-day Uşak were the Phrygians in the eastern portion and the Lydians in the west during the seventh century BC. The Karun Treasure, discovered by clandestine treasure hunters in Uşak in 1965, and whose smuggling outside Turkey and subsequent retrieval decades later from New York City's Metropolitan Museum of Art made international headlines, gives an indication of the high degree of civilization attained by these Anatolian states. The region of Lydia was later taken over by the Persian Empire in the 6th century BC and by Alexander the Great and his successors as of the 4th century. Thereafter, Uşak was ruled successively by the Roman Empire, the Byzantine Empire, the Germiyanids and finally the Ottoman Empire (as of 1429).\n\nThroughout classical times, until the Byzantine period, the city was called Ousakeion (Ουσάκειον) in Greek. Later, following Turkish conquest and domination over the area, the city became known by its Turkish name of \"Uşşak\"; which could mean \"lovers\" and \"minstrels\" simultaneously. Tradition privileges the second derivation, which could be a reference to the region's rich folk literature.\n\nUşak was occupied by the Greek army between 28 August 1920 and 1 September 1922. During the Greek retreat, Greek general Nikolaos Trikoupis was captured near Uşak at the village of Göğem, today buried under a dam reservoir.\n\nUşak was a district center within Kütahya Province until 1953, when Uşak Province was constituted and Uşak became its provincial capital.\n\nAt least since the 17th century there was trade between Uşak and the Dutch republic as reflected in the rug shown thrown over the bannister in Vermeer's painting \"The Procuress.\" The rug was probably produced in Uşak, covers a third of the painting and shows medaillons and leaves. \n\nIn the early 20th century, mercury was discovered in Uşak. The town also manufactured carpet.\n\nAmong other district centers in Uşak Province, Banaz is the largest and is notable for its varied agricultural production as well as for its forests, while Ulubey's canyon is a natural site attracting many visitors.\n\nUşak has a continental Mediterranean climate with cold, wet and regularly snowy winters and hot, long and dry summers.\n\nIn pre-industrial times, Uşak was already a major center of production and export, particularly of Ushak carpets. Ushak carpets are also called Holbein carpets in reference to the 16th century painter Hans Holbein the Younger who depicted them in minute detail in his paintings, reflecting their popularity in European markets. The level of international popularity attained by Uşak's carpets became such that the word \"Ushak\" is considered an English word of Turkic origin.\n\nAlthough Uşak's carpet patterns have evolved since then, large-scale weaving still continues and the name of the city still has an important presence in the market for carpets, both hand-woven and industrial. On the other hand, the district of Eşme, which is also in Uşak Province, is famous for its \"kilims\".\n\n\n"}

Her father was an avid hunter who liked Canada because \"the duck hunting was better there.\" As Hunter was a \"sickly\" child, the family ultimately moved to California to avoid the harsh winters in Saskatchewan. Although they returned to Canada from May to October for many years, most of her schooling was in California.\n\nIn junior high she was placed in an experimental school to test some of Stanford University's psychological theories on intelligence. They used her to score intelligence tests. As a result, she became interested in human intelligence; this along with classical ballet became her passions in life. As a 16-year-old she entered the University of California at Los Angeles as a combination pre-medicine and psychology major while continuing her ballet dancing. She had to choose either going to South America on tour with the Ballet Russe or finishing her degree in pre-medicine. She chose to finish her degree and then realized that she had limited hand eye coordination which would deny her the chance of becoming a neurological surgeon. Two additional events influenced her choice of a career in school psychology. The first occurred in seventh grade, while sitting in an auditorium waiting to be assigned a class. She felt hurt when she was labeled as dumb; these feelings were never forgotten. Because of this experience she felt the need to give positive reinforcement to students in schools--\"Never put a kid down, always build the kid up.\" A second influence occurred during her first work experiences at Children's Hospital in Los Angeles and at Juvenile Hall.\n\nDuring World War II she married an engineer, Robert Hunter, who worked at Lockheed Aviation until he retired. They had two children, a daughter and a son. In 1944 their first child, Cheryl, was born. She went on to become a film editor. In 1946 they had their second child, Robin, who became a school principal.\n\nAfter her children were on their own, she went back to working full-time as an educator. She held many positions, including school psychologist, principal, director of research, and assistant superintendent. She was given the opportunity to implement her educational model in a laboratory school setting. In Hunter's lifetime, she wrote 12 books, over 300 articles, and produced 17 videotape collections.\n\nAccording to the Graduate School of Education at U.C.L.A where she worked, Hunter died at the age of 78 in Los Angeles from a series of strokes.\n\nShe believed that the foremost job of teachers was decision making, and that each teacher makes thousands of decisions each day. All of the decisions a teacher makes can be put into one of three categories: (1) content category - what you are going to teach; (2) teaching behavior category - what you as the teacher will do to facilitate and escalate that learning; and (3) learning behavior category - how the students are going to learn and how they will let you know that they've learned it.\n\nIn response to a question asking her to assess the current educational situation in the 1990s, she said, \"I believe the future of education is bright! We are beginning to unlock the mystery of the human brain and how it processes and learns. We, now, can enable teachers to use that knowledge to accelerate that learning process. No longer is teaching a 'laying on of hands.' It has become a profession that combines science with art to create a better and a more productive world for humankind.\" (Source?)\n\nMadeline Hunter developed the Instructional Theory into Practice teaching model. It is a direct instruction program that was implemented in thousands of schools throughout the United States.\n\nHunter identified seven components for teaching:\n\n\nHunter also developed a direct instructional model and elements of effective instruction.\n\nThe instructional model has seven components: \n\nThe elements of effective instruction are very similar to those of the instructional model, featuring seven components of teaching and behavioral objectives: \n\nHunter was the creator of Instructional Theory into Practice (ITIP). ITIP is a teaching model on inservice/staff development program widely used during the 1970s and 1980s.\n\nMadeline Cheek Hunter. (n.d.). Biographies.

He is the author of a calligraphic rendering of the Greatest Name, used by Baháʼís around the world.\n\nMishkín-Qalam was born in Shíráz but was a resident of Isfahán, which is where he first heard of the Baháʼí Faith. A few years later he travelled to Baghdad and learned in more detail from Zaynu'l-Muqarrabín and Nabíl-i-Aʻzam, but was not confirmed until he later travelled to Adrianople and met Baháʼu'lláh.\n\nBefore becoming a Baháʼí, he was a Súfí of the Ni'matu'lláhí order. He was also a skilled astronomer.\n\nMishkín-Qalam was sent by Baháʼu'lláh to Constantinople (Istanbul), where he began attracting people through his art and vigorously teaching the Baháʼí Faith.

Primarily a third-person shooter, the game also utilizes multiple types of vehicular combat sequences. It was released for the Nintendo 64 on December 3, 1996, and a version for Microsoft Windows was released on September 17, 1997. Good Old Games re-released it on May 3, 2016, as a compatibility update for 64-bit Windows systems.\n\nThe player controls the mercenary Dash Rendar in his efforts to help Luke Skywalker and rescue Princess Leia from Prince Xizor. It is part of the \"\" multimedia project and takes place as a backstory between \"The Empire Strikes Back\" and \"Return of the Jedi\". Tracks from the multimedia project's are used as the game's musical score. The game received mixed to positive reviews from critics. \"Shadows of the Empire\" is the third top-selling Nintendo 64 game for 1997, with more than 1 million copies sold.\n\n\"Star Wars: Shadows of the Empire\" plays primarily as a third-person shooter. Players control Dash Rendar, the game's protagonist. Rendar has use of a blaster pistol which recharges after each shot, but the player character can also pick up additional powerups which provide other properties to the gun. In later levels of the game Rendar acquires a jetpack which can be used to traverse larger gaps. The player character has limited health, which can be replenished with health packs located throughout the game. The player is given a finite amount of lives to complete the game. Additional lives can be acquired, however if the player runs out of lives a game over sequence occurs. Each level is timed and up to three challenge points can be received for performing specific actions or finding hidden tokens.\n\nThe game features other, non-shooter elements. In the game's opening level the player controls Rendar as he pilots a snowspeeder in defense of the Rebel base on Hoth. 360 degree space battles occur in which the player character controls the turret of the protagonist's ship, the \"Outrider\". These levels task the player with destroying a specific number of enemy ships. Other space sequences see the player character pilot the ship, utilizing its forward cannons to destroy targets. In one sequence the player controls the protagonist during a high speed chase sequence on swoop bikes. In this sequence the player must both control the swoop and attack and eliminate an enemy gang before reaching the destination.\n\nThe game's story is divided into four chapters. \"Part I: Escape from Echo Base\" begins shortly before the battle of Hoth, as Dash Rendar and Leebo, Dash's droid co-pilot, arrive at Echo Base to deliver supplies. He briefly talks with Han Solo, who gets him temporary clearance to fly with Rogue Squadron. Dash pilots a snowspeeder into battle, and returns to Echo Base when the shield generator is destroyed, just as the \"Millennium Falcon\" leaves. He makes his way through the base, attempting to return to his ship, the \"Outrider\". Dash encounters several wampas on the way, and has to fight an AT-ST, but eventually makes it back to Leebo and \"The Outrider\", and they escape through an asteroid field.\n\n\"Part II: In Search of Boba Fett\" begins after the end of \"The Empire Strikes Back\", as Dash searches for Boba Fett, who holds Han Solo captive, frozen in carbonite. He hunts down and battles IG-88, who is attempting to repair his ship on Ord Mantell after an altercation with Fett. The droid tells him that Fett is hiding on a moon of the planet Gall. Dash finds Fett, and damages his ship, the \"Slave I\", but Fett manages to escape. Believing that the Emperor will let him take Darth Vader's place if Skywalker is killed, Prince Xizor orders Jabba the Hutt to kill Luke Skywalker.\n\n\"Part III: Hunting the Assassins\" sees Jabba send a group of swoop bikers to Obi-Wan Kenobi's home, where Luke is practicing his Jedi skills. Dash races them to Kenobi's, and eliminates all members of the gang. Luke informs Dash of a secret imperial supercomputer aboard the Imperial Freighter \"Suprosa\", containing unknown important Imperial construction plans for the Death Star II. Dash steals the computer, and battles with a cargo droid in a hangar.\n\n\"Part IV: Lair of the Dark Prince\" begins with Luke, Lando Calrissian, Chewbacca, and Dash infiltrating Xizor's palace on Coruscant to save Princess Leia, whom Xizor has taken captive. Dash enters the palace through the underground sewer system, and battles an enormous dianoga, before entering the palace itself. To stall the mercenary, Xizor summons his droid, which Dash quickly disposes of. After defeating the droid, Xizor flees to his \"Skyhook\" space station. Xizor's forces engage in battle with the Rebellion, but during the conflict an Imperial Star Destroyer arrives. The conflict turns as the Star Destroyer engages Xizor and his forces. Utilizing this distraction, Dash destroys the \"Skyhook\"s outer defenses and proceeds to fly inside the station, destroying its core. Dash is presumably killed in the blast, along with Xizor.\n\nA short pre-credits scene shows Luke and Leia on Tatooine, mourning Dash's death. If the game is completed on medium or higher difficulty levels, this is followed by an additional scene of Dash and Leebo, who had managed a jump to hyperspace to escape the blast. Leebo questions Dash's decision to keep the illusion they had died in the \"Skyhook\"s destruction, to which Dash says, \"It's good to be remembered as a martyr without actually being dead, wouldn't you say?\"\n\nThe work on \"Shadows of the Empire\" project started in late 1994 with the idea of making a side story to the movies. After dismissing the use of the main characters from the movies as the playable character of the new game, which gave the developers more freedom with the game and story, they built on a minor character from the book, Dash Rendar. He has many similarities to Han Solo, including a ship, the \"Outrider\", which bears a close resemblance to Solo's \"Millennium Falcon\". Jon Knoles, who was the game's senior artist and animator and previously worked on other LucasArts games for PC and SNES, is credited with bringing the idea of \"Shadows of the Empire\" and placing it between the films \"The Empire Strikes Back\" and \"Return of the Jedi\".\n\nLucasArts used the level editor of the Jedi engine, previously used on their games \"\" and \"Outlaws\", to create the game's 3D environments. The game was programmed in the language C. The game was originally planned to have 19 levels, \"Nintendo Power\" reported a reduction to 12 levels, and the final release has 10 levels.\n\nLucasArts's choice to be an early adopter of the Nintendo 64 came from what company leaders believed were missed opportunities for revenue on game consoles. When work began on \"Shadows of the Empire\", the Nintendo 64 hardware had not been finalized by Silicon Graphics (SGI) and Nintendo. Therefore, SGI approximated the console's performance and functionality profile using a SGI Onyx supercomputer with the RealityEngine2 graphics subsystem with the Performer 3D API — the architecture which had originally inspired SGI's design of the Nintendo 64. Two developers had extensive experience with the SGI platform, which eased the prototyping of the game for approximately 18 months until the Nintendo 64 hardware was finalized. Eventually, SGI Indy workstations with Nintendo 64 hardware cards were given to the team to replace the software-based profile on Onyx. Because of the team's SGI expertise and the Nintendo 64's design heritage from the Onyx, they ported the game to the console in three days and continued development on Indy, while still performing large environmental precalculations on Onyx. For a prototype controller with which to test the game, they were delivered a modified SNES controller with a primitive analog joystick and Z trigger, designed by Konami. For maximal secrecy under strict nondisclosure agreement, the core team was not allowed to speak to anyone else about the hardware or the project, and the controller prototype was concealed within a cardboard box that the team could place their hands into.\n\nWhile in production, Shigeru Miyamoto, senior marketing director of Nintendo, suggested while viewing an early version of the game that the character of Dash be more animated. He suggested Rendar could become restless when waiting for the player to control him, and more animated in how he holds his weapons. Motion capture was done at LucasArts's sister company Industrial Light & Magic (ILM). The recorded animations proved to be unusable, and the animations had to be redone manually using keyframes. Alias Power Animator was used during this process. Music development began using MIDI approximations of the original film scores by composer John Williams. The team believed that MIDI did not appropriately capture the essence of the music, and so digital samples of the original music were used. As part of the \"Shadows of the Empire\" multimedia project a full soundtrack was composed by Joel McNeely and recorded with the Royal Scottish National Orchestra. Samples of the soundtrack were used in both versions of the game, with the Windows version containing many of the full tracks. For the console version, due to limited cartridge space, the developers sampled the score down to 16-bit at 11 kHz in mono. After some discussion, Nintendo agreed to increase the cartridge space from 8MB to 12MB, giving the developers enough room to sample roughly 15 minutes of music on the cartridge. The game is unique among Nintendo 64 titles for using a digitized orchestral soundtrack, instead of synthesized music like that in \"\". John Cygan voices the game's protagonist, Dash Rendar. Cygan reprises his role in \"\". His droid, Leebo, is voiced by Tom Kane. Luke Skywalker is voiced by Bob Bergen, official audio double for Mark Hamill. Prince Xizor, the game's primary antagonist, is voiced by Nick Tate.\n\nAfter the game's demonstration at the 1996 Electronic Entertainment Expo met with mixed reactions, LucasArts cancelled its plans to release the game with the Nintendo 64 North American launch, postponing it until December to give the production team a few more months for quality.\n\n\"Shadows of the Empire\" was released on December 3, 1996 for the Nintendo 64, three months after the console's launch. It was released in Japan on June 14, 1997. With the developer reporting more than one million copies sold by 1997, \"Shadows of the Empire\" is the third top-selling Nintendo 64 game for that year (September 1996 to August 1997) and the third top-selling game on any system for the 1996 Christmas shopping season. A version for Windows 95 was released on September 17, 1997. In coming decades, compatibility problems arose, so the game was re-released for 64-bit Windows systems on May 3, 2016 through Good Old Games.\n\nOn July 26, 2019 the Nintendo 64 version was re-released in both a standard and Collector's Edition in limited quantities by Limited Run Games.\n\n\"Shadows of the Empire\" has received generally mixed reviews from critics. The most common comment made of the game was that the opening Battle of Hoth is outstanding, but all the other levels are mediocre. Some critics specified that while the different game styles represented give \"Shadows of the Empire\" variety, none of them offered anything new or were executed well. The first person shooter stages (which comprise the majority of the game) drew the strongest criticism, with reviews describing poor controls and camera angles which either give a cripplingly limited view or block the action with Dash's own body. Reviewers often praised the game's polygonal graphics as being convincing enough to affect the player's mood.\n\nA reviewer for \"Next Generation\" remarked that the cartridge format was insufficient for a game of this type, resulting in issues — the lack of fluidity in the sewer waters, and the frequent looping of the music — which could have been easily solved with the greater storage capacity of CD. Chiefly criticizing the multi-genre gameplay, he said the game was especially disappointing in light of its great potential. Doug Perry of IGN similarly said that \"we were disappointed again and again at this game's terrible control, its mediocre gameplay, and the overall knowledge that, once having finished it, you knew that the developers from LucasArts could have orchestrated a much better piece of videogaming.\" Writing in \"GamePro\", Scary Larry highly praised the soundtrack, but concluded that the issues with the gameplay made it a must-have for \"Star Wars\" fans but a poor choice for anyone else. Dissenting from other critics, Shawn Smith of \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" asserted that all the gameplay styles in \"Shadows of the Empire\" are done extremely well, and said it was the best \"Star Wars\" game he had played on either console or PC. The other three reviewers for \"EGM\" were less enthusiastic, with Sushi-X in particular summarizing the game as \"a poor first-person shooter on top of an awesome Hoth battle sequence\". GameSpot's John Broady claimed that \"...the control, camera angles, and frustrating save feature keep it from reaching its full potential\".\n\nMost critics were amazed by the Battle of Hoth level, particularly its success in recreating the scene from \"The Empire Strikes Back\" as an interactive experience. The month prior to their review of the game, \"EGM\"s lead editorial hailed this level as a watershed moment for movie-to-game adaptations, anticipating a new era in which film studios would take into account prospective game adaptations when making a movie.\n\n\"EGM\" named \"Shadows of the Empire\" a runner-up for Nintendo 64 Game of the Year (behind \"Super Mario 64\"). While they noted that there was little competition for this category, since only eight Nintendo 64 games were released in the US in 1996, they called the game \"a tour-de-force that all \"Star Wars\" fans must check out\". They also named it a runner-up for Best Music (behind \"Wipeout XL\").\n\nIn a retrospective review, Allgame's Scott Alan Marriott criticized the shooting sequences as \"rather boring, probably due to the less involving third-person perspective\".\n\n"}

While the five-pointed star is the symbol of the religion, being used to represent the human body and Messengers of God, more common symbols include the nine-pointed star, the Greatest Name, and the Ringstone symbol, representing perfection, and the Messengers of God.\n\nThe five-pointed star, or \"haykal\" () is the symbol of the Baháʼí Faith as mentioned by Shoghi Effendi, head of the Baháʼí Faith in the first half of the 20th century: \"Strictly speaking the 5-pointed star is the symbol of our Faith, as used by the Báb and explained by Him.\" The five-pointed star has been used as the outline of special letters or tablets by both the Báb and Baháʼu'lláh.\n\nHaykal is a loan word from the Hebrew word \"hēyḵāl\", which means temple and specifically Solomon's Temple in Jerusalem. In Arabic, the word also means the body or form of something, particularly the human body. In the Baháʼí tradition, the \"haykal\" was established by the Báb — who told of Baháʼu'lláh's coming — who represented the haykal as a five-pointed star representing the human body as a head, two hands, and two feet. The Báb wrote many letters, tablets, prayers and more in the shape of a five-pointed star, including some that included many derivatives of the word \"Baháʼ\" (see below).\n\nIn Baháʼu'lláh's writings, specifically the \"Súriy-i-Haykal (Tablet of the Temple)\", while the meaning of temple remains present, the haykal is used mainly to mean the human body, but particularly the body of the Manifestation of God — a messenger from God — and the person of Baháʼu'lláh himself. In the Tablet, the haykal is also used to refer to the word of God, which is revealed by the Manifestations of God. He also says in the same Tablet:\"O Living Temple! We have, in very truth...ordained Thee to be the emblem of My Cause betwixt the heavens and the earth...\"\n\nIn Islamic belief God has 99 names, and in some Islamic traditions it is believed that there is a special hidden 100th name, which is the greatest. In Baháʼí belief the \"Greatest Name\" is \"Baháʼ\" (), translated as \"glory\" or \"splendour\". Many symbols of the Baháʼí Faith derive their significance from the word Baháʼ, and it is the root word used in many other names and phrases including Baháʼí (a follower of Baháʼ), Baháʼu'lláh (Glory of God), ʻAbdu'l-Bahá (Servant of Glory), Yá Baháʼu'l-Abhá (O Thou Glory of the Most Glorious), and Alláh-u-Abhá (God is Most Glorious).\n\nIn Twelver Islam, the Greatest Name, or Most Great Name, refers to the Book of God, thus the fact that Baha'u'llah used the verbiage of the Greatest Name signifies Baha'u'llah's writings similar to Bayán - explanation, in Babism.\n\nBaháʼu'lláh often referred to Baháʼís in his writings as \"the people of Baháʼ\", and in addition, the Báb sent a tablet to Baháʼu'lláh with 360 derivatives of the word Baháʼ. Along with daily prayers, Baháʼís are encouraged to recite the phrase \"Alláh-u-Abhá\" 95 times in a form of meditation.\n\nThe symbol known as Greatest Name is an Arabic calligraphic rendering of \"Yá Baháʼu'l-Abhá\" ( usually translated as \"\"O Thou the Glory of the Most Glorious\"!\"). This rendering was originally drawn by the early Baháʼí calligrapher Mishkín Qalam, and later adopted by Baháʼís everywhere.\n\nSince the symbol refers more directly to the Name of God and of the Messenger of God, than any other symbol in the Baháʼí Faith, it is not generally used in a casual manner or to adorn the personal artifacts that are put to common use. The symbol can usually be seen in Baháʼí homes and rings that are produced on a limited scale.\n\nAccording to the Abjad system of Isopsephy, the word Baháʼ has a numerical equivalence of 9, and thus there is frequent use of the number 9 in Baháʼí symbols. The most commonly used symbol connected to the number 9 is the \"nine-pointed star\"; there is no particular design of the nine-pointed star that is used more often than others. While the star is not a part of the teachings of the Baháʼí Faith, it is commonly used as an emblem representing \"9\", because of the association of number 9 with perfection, unity and Baháʼ.\n\nThe number 9 also comes up several times in Baháʼí history and teachings. On the significance of the number 9, Shoghi Effendi wrote:\n\"Concerning the number nine: the Baháʼís reverence this for two reasons, first because it is considered by those interested in numbers as the sign of perfection. The second consideration, which is the more important one, is that it is the numerical value of the word \"Baháʼ\"…\"Besides these two significances the number nine has no other meaning. It is, however, enough to make the Baháʼís use it when an arbitrary number is to be chosen.\"\n\nIts use on gravestone markers was approved by Shoghi Effendi, then head of the religion, in 1944.\n\nThe \"ringstone symbol\" was designed by ʻAbdu'l-Bahá, and, as its name implies, is the most common symbol found on rings worn by Baháʼís, but it is also used on necklaces, book covers, and paintings. It consists of two stars (haykal) interspersed with a stylized Baháʼ. The lower line is said to represent humanity and the world of creation, the upper line the world of God, and the middle line represents the special station of Manifestation of God and the world of revelation; the vertical line is the Primal Will or Holy Spirit proceeding from God through the Manifestations to humanity. The position of Manifestation of God in this symbol is said to be the linking point to God. The two stars or haykals represent Baháʼu'lláh and the Báb.\n\nThe writings of Baháʼu'lláh contain many allegories and symbolic language, often taken from nature (e.g., the sun, clouds, trees, rivers, oceans, valleys, mountains, gardens, birds, etc.), referring to spiritual principles. Christopher Buck analyses a selection of six key scenarios (the Promised One, the Covenant, illumination, lover and the beloved, the Maid of Heaven, the crimson ark and the Holy Mariner) and six root metaphors (physician, wine/water of life, mirror/gems, the journey, lote-tree/Sinai, paradise). Other analysis has been done by Baháʼí scholars John Hatcher, William Collins, and Ruhiyyih Khanum.\n\nA true understanding of the multiple meanings in the sacred texts can only be reached by a purification of the heart, together with the guidance of the Manifestations of God and their appointed interpreters. Baháʼís are free to hold to their own understanding of the texts, as long as they do not force it on others, realize that their understanding is limited, and that they all follow the binding authority of the appointed interpreters.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2226213", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2226213", "title": "Dendroarchaeology", "text": "Dendroarchaeology\n\nDendroarchaeology is a term used for the study of vegetation remains, old buildings, artifacts, furniture, art and musical instruments using the techniques of dendrochronology (tree-ring dating). It refers to dendrochronological research of wood from the past regardless of its current physical context (in or above the soil). This form of dating is the most accurate and precise absolute dating method available to archaeologists, as the last ring that grew is the first year the tree could have been incorporated into an archaeological structure.\n\nTree-ring dating is useful in that it can contribute to \"chronometric\", \"environmental\", and \"behavioral\" archaeological research.\n\nThe utility of tree-ring dating in an environmental sense is the most applicable of the three in today's world. Tree rings can be used to \"reconstruct numerous environmental variables\" such as \"temperature\", \"precipitation\", \"stream flow\", \"drought society\", \"fire frequency and intensity\", \"insect infestation\", \"atmospheric circulation patterns\", among others.\n\nTree ring laboratory scientists from Columbia University were some of the first to apply tree-ring dating to the colonial period, specifically architectural timbers in the eastern United States. For agencies like the National Park Service and other historical societies, Dr. Jacoby and Cook began dating historic structures in the lower Hudson River Valley, New Jersey and Eastern Pennsylvania. This was difficult at the time due to a lack of sufficiently long master dating chronology and access to suitable structures. Not until 1998 was a Boston area master dating chronology developed.\nToday, the effectiveness of tree ring laboratory archaeological dating chronologies covers most of the area that was settled by the first European colonists. The numbers of these are in the hundreds and include historically significant structures such as Independence Hall and the Tuckahoe estate.\n\nThere are two types of dates that can be assigned to tree specimens: \"cutting\" dates, and \"noncutting\" dates. Which date is assigned to a specimen is dependent on whether or not there is evidence that the last ring present on the specimen was the last ring the tree grew before it died.\n\n\"Cutting dates\" can be used for crossdated tree specimens that \"possess evidence that the last ring present on the specimen was the last ring grown by the tree before it died.\" \n\n\"Noncutting dates\" are used for crossdated tree specimens \"if there is no evidence indicating that the last ring present on the specimen is the last one grown before the tree died.\" \nPatterns of tree growth will be similar between trees of the same species, growing in the same climate. These matching patterns align growth rings in different trees formed in the same year. Once aligned, knowing the precise calendar year of any individual tree-ring is the same as knowing the calendar year of all the rings. The goal of a dendroarchaeologist is to determine the year when the last ring was formed. \nCrossdating, the skill of finding matching ring-width patterns between tree-ring samples, is used to assign the precise calendar year to every ring. This is affected by the climate that the timber was in. It is also important to have enough rings to actually confirm a date. Once the rings are dates, the chronology is measured. The last step is to compare the rings with that of ring-width patterns in sampled timbers and a master dating chronology.\n\nFor trees to be useful in archaeological analysis, they must \"produce annual growth rings that are uniform around the tree stem\", they must \"live for decades and, preferably, centuries\" and they \"must have been used extensively by humans either for habitation or fuel.\" One of the problems with this evaluation is that it is possible under certain conditions for a tree to miss a growth-ring or produce two growth rings in a season. During extreme drought there can be insufficient growth of xylem to form a noticeable ring. Alternatively, if a defoliating agent (e.g. drought, late frost, or insect damage) can arrest the growth of a tree early in a year, after which there is a secondary growth period of new foliage causing two rings to form. Another difficulty in the use of tree-ring dating as applied to archaeology is the variety and condition of wood used in construction of archaeological sites. Many such samples are encountered wet. Heartwood can normally retain much of its substance and can be dried out and polished for analysis. On the other hand, ancient wet sapwood samples seldom survive drying out. As a result, the sapwood should either be measured wet and then allowed to dry, or it should be frozen or kept wet.\n\nIn North America, \"millennial-length chronologies have been developed for two species of bristlecone pine (\"Pinus longaeva\" in the Great Basin and \"Pinus aristata\" in the Rocky Mountains), bald cypress (\"Taxodium distichum\"), coast redwood (\"Sequoia sempervirens\"), Douglas-fir (\"Pseudotsuga menziesii\"), eastern cedar (\"Juniperus virginiana\"), juniper (\"Juniperus sp.\"), Larch (\"Larix sp.\"), lodgepole pine (\"Pinus contorta\"), limber pine (\"Pinus flexilis\"), mountain hemlock (\"Tsuga mertensiana\"), ponderosa pine (\"Pinus ponderosa\"), and giant sequoia (\"Sequoiadendron giganteum\") (Jacoby, 2000a).” \n\n“In the southern hemisphere, successful crossdating has been achieved on alerce (\"Fitroya cupressoides\") and pehuen (\"Araucaria araucana\"), also known as 'Chilean pine' or the 'monkey puzzle tree,' specimens in South America, kauri (\"Agathis australis\") specimens in New Zealand, clanwilliam cedar (\"Widdringtonia cedarbergensis\") specimens in Australia and Tasmania, and huon pine (\"Lagarostrobus franklinii\") in Tasmania (Jacoby, 2000al; Norton, 1990).” \n\nThe main application of tree research laboratory science or dendroarchaeology is to produce records of past climates that might be unavailable otherwise. Timber remains give insight into what little remains of our national forests prior to colonial settlement. This also benefits the sciences of paleoclimatology.\n\nDendrochronological dating is potentially applicable wherever trees were growing, except in tropical regions. For use in absolute dating of archaeological sites, it is partially limited by the availability of a master reference chronology for the region concerned. If there is a gap in the chronology (e.g. the inability to use a chronology constructed from pine samples in the British Isle prior to the 17th century due to the lack of use of pine in architecture then) then absolute dating cannot be applied. Additionally, non-climatic influences can also affect the tree-ring pattern of timber samples. Even if a reference chronology is available, care must be taken to identify aberrations in the ring pattern to determine if the sample is usable for dating.\n\nDendroarchaeology has been used extensively in the dating of historical buildings. After cross-matching the chronology from the building with the chronology of living trees, it is immediately possible to figure out the dates at which the historic timbers used in construction were felled. Similarly, if an extended chronology is available, then dating of samples from buildings of known or unknown date is possible. However, a limiting aspect of this application becomes apparent when dating medieval buildings. In such buildings, many timber samples lack completeness out to the underbark surface which can make the task of determining the felling year much more difficult.\n\nThe application of dendroarchaeology in uncovering past trade patterns also becomes possible as chronology records for timber around the world become more complete and accessible. Patterns from individual samples will match much more closely with their native chronologies than with their regional chronology. For example, strong cross dating is found between Irish and English chronologies, but individual ring patterns tend to match better against their local chronologies. Hence, this strong geographical component of tree ring chronologies can be used to source timber samples at archaeological sites to uncover trade routes required for the site construction.\n\nDendrochronology can also be used in concert with radiocarbon dating to allow for more accurate date measurements using radiocarbon dating on archaeological sites. It is known that the concentration of carbon-14 in the atmosphere is not constant. By performing radiocarbon dating on timber samples in a known chronology, radiocarbon dates can be plotted against real time generating a calibration curve that can be used for future radiocarbon samples.\n\nWhile dendrochronology is often considered as an absolute dating method, it can also be used as a powerful tool in the relative dating of an archaeological site. Timber samples may be able to be compared with others on the site to help construct a timeline of events for that particular site. Such samples can also be used to settle issues in constructing a chronological typology for artifacts found on site. The important point is that such within-site analysis can be done whether or not a chronology is available to date the whole assemblage.\n\n"}

Its population is 17,148. Its old latin name was Civitas Campaniae (City of Campagna). Campagna is located in one of the Picentini Mountains valleys at an altitude of 270 meters above sea level.\n\nThe first records of the area date back to the IX century in the Lombard period. The position of the town was strategic for enemies attacks during the Middle Age. Lately, the town became an important cultural and religious center. It was home for many Bishops until the 1973 when the Diocese of Campagna merged with the Archdiocese of Salerno.\n\nDuring the Second World War, Campagna was a temporary home for many Jews thanks to Giovanni Palatucci and his uncle Giuseppe Maria Palatucci. People arrived from the north of Italy and Campagna citizens hid those people in the basements of the churches. Giovanni was later honoured as a Righteous Among the Nations by the Yad Vashem Holocaust Memorial. Much of this is documented in Elizabeth Bettina's book, \"It Happened in Italy\". Today, goods left by the Jews are shown in the Museo della Memoria in the Campagna town centre.\n\nCampagna borders with Acerno, Contursi Terme, Eboli, Olevano sul Tusciano, Oliveto Citra, Postiglione, Serre and Senerchia (this one in the Province of Avellino),\n\nThe municipality counts the \"frazioni\" of Camaldoli, Galdo, Mattinelle, Puglietta, Quadrivio, Romandola-Madonna del Ponte, Santa Maria La Nova and Serradarce. Other localities are Avigliano, Folcata, Oppidi-Varano, Saginara and Sant'Angelo.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCampagna is famous for its traditional summer event ‘A Chiena’ (), which takes place annually every weekend between July and August. During the event, the city river Tenza is deflected from its natural course through the city main street where people wait for the water to come. This tradition comes from the ancient practice of cleaning the streets by using the river water. Later, it was converted into a delightful moment for locals and tourists.\n\nI Fucanoli is festival in honour of Sant'Antonio, taking place on the 17th of January. The celebrations begin in the late afternoon with a service followed by a procession whereby the Sant'Antonio statue is carried in the streets of the city centre. While the statue is carried through the streets, huge fires are ignited.\n\nMonte Carlo in the Principality of Monaco is Campagna's sister city.\n\n"}

Sean Donahue is in the kickboxing ring against the current Thai champion. In his corner is his little brother Jake, who is cheering Sean on. Sean is able to overpower his opponent and wins after a spin kick knocks the Thai fighter out. Sean is rewarded with the championship. En route to their hotel after the fight, Jake and Sean are ambushed by some armed men. Sean is able to fight them off until he is shot at by Khan, who warned Sean he was not to have won the fight. Sean admits that it wasn't his intention but the opponent wasn't much of a contender. Khan, angry with the decision, fights Sean and obliterates him in front of young Jake. Khan performs a triple kick combination starting with a double jump kick to the head, followed by a double jump kick to the chest and a jump spinning back kick, which kills Sean. Jake, saddened and angry, races towards Khan who beats Jake up and knocks him out. \n\nIt has been ten years and Jake is now a New York City detective who has gone undercover to bust a drug deal in an abandoned warehouse. Jake mocks the dealer and tells the dealer that he is a cop. The dealer laughs it off at first, until Jake reveals his badge and wire, which infuriates his fellow officers. The dealer and his two men attempt to begin fighting Jake, who resorts to a street fighting style to ultimate stop the dealer and his men. SWAT arrives and the team leader is unhappy with Jake for his actions. Back at the office, Jake is getting reamed out by Captain O'Day, who tells Jake the dealer may have a chance to call police brutality due to his actions. However, O'Day makes Jake a deal that could get him out of his potential bind. Interpol has contacted NYPD about an operation involving snuff films and wants Jake to take on the operation. When Jake learns the operation is in Thailand, Jake refuses to take the assignment. However, that night, while viewing one of the films, he learns the man who stars in the film is Khan, which triggers the flashback of his brother's death. When Jake gets a call from O'Day to let him off the hook, Jake tells him he's taking the assignment.\n\nUpon his arrival in Thailand, Jake meets his contact Anderson, who tells him that the men behind the snuff films look around for fighters to star in their films. Therefore, Jake must find a way to get attention. While this is going on, an American fighter, Dan Handel, is the latest star of Khan's new film, in which he learns the hard way about what filming is like. When Dan is cut for real and then shot at, he is shocked to discover the body of a dead woman. Khan arrives and beats up Dan before impaling him on a hook, causing his death. Jake's first attempt at a Muay Thai school proves to be unsuccessful. However, his actions grab the attention of Thasi, a Thai-American Muay Thai fighter. That night, as a reward for his latest actions, Khan is given a chance to choose a woman to spend the night with and chooses Molly, an American who came to Thailand to start a modeling career only to find herself duped with nowhere else to go. When she tricks Khan into doing a tradition of washing up for him, she escapes. When Khan sends men after her, Jake comes to her rescue and the two form a bond.\n\nThe next day, Thasi follows Jake, Jake confronts him only to be beaten up. Jake is convinced that he will need more than street smarts if he plans to defeat Khan. Thasi, knowing Jake will not be able to stand a chance against Khan with his current skill, recommends a fighter named Prang, who is the only man to come close to defeating Khan. Since the devastating loss, Prang has resorted to becoming a hermit living off the Mekong River. When Jake arrives to Prang's place, Prang is completely drunk and blows Jake off. As Jake sets off to leave, Prang's chimpanzee steals Jake's passport. The next day, Jake heads to Prang to retrieve his passport and sees Prang getting mugged. Jake's attempt proves unsuccessful with Prang showcasing his martial arts skills, knocking out all of the muggers and sending them away. He admits the mugging was a ruse to see how well Jake can fight and invites him to dinner.\n\nThat night, Prang tells his story of how he fought and ultimately lost to Khan. The loss caused Prang to become a drunken hermit, and yet he had wanted revenge on Khan for a long time. When Jake reveals how Khan had killed his brother ten years ago, Prang is at first reluctant to teach Jake for revenge. However, Prang sees the opportunity as redemption and decides to put Jake through a painful regiment of training. When Jake grows tired of the pain he must endure at the hands of Prang, a confrontation leads to Jake almost leaving Prang, only to apologize and decides to take the training seriously. Molly looks for Jake and must escape Khan's men. Eventually, Molly does reach Jake and the two start a romance. Jake becomes more proficient in martial arts and proves his mettle in an underground fight. When Jake begins winning his fights, it grabs the attention of Mr. McKinney, the scout for the snuff films. Jake accepts McKinney's offer. However, that night, while having dinner with Molly, Jake is stunned by the arrival of both Anderson and Capt. O'Day, who learns Jake's real reason why he accepted the mission. O'Day wants Jake off the mission, but Jake has told them he made contact and he makes his \"movie\" the next day. Anderson fully decides to side with Jake and at first reluctant, O'Day agrees as well.\n\nThe next day, Jake is ready and heads to the location, which consists of a booby-trapped dome made of bamboo. However, when he leaves, Khan has Molly kidnapped and Prang killed. As Jake, wearing the mask of Hanuman makes his way through the first round of goons in the dome, he plays it off pretending like he doesn't know what's going on and even throws his mask to the ground. However, Khan, wearing a black mask, arrives and has Molly tied up and throws Prang's body to the bottom, watery lake where Jake is shocked. Khan and Jake start out with a sword fight until Jake is hit in the side and Khan's mask is sliced off, revealing his face. A visibly upset Jake reveals the photo of Sean from ten years ago and throws it to Khan. Khan knows who Jake is now and promises to send him to Hell. Jake says he has been there for ten years and the two go one-on-one with both nearly equally matching their skills. Khan gets the upper hand and almost sends Jake to death via impalement on a ground spike only for Jake to barely hang on to the cage. When Khan breaks a piece of bamboo as a staff to knock Jake down, Jake grabs the staff and jumps up and begins his assault on Khan. Khan attempts the triple death kick combination only to learn that thanks to Prang's training, Jake has learned to counter the three kicks. Jake finally defeats Khan, to the shock of everyone on set. When Jake attempts to get Molly, Khan gets up and runs towards Jake, who kicks Khan to the dome entryway, which falls on Khan. In his last breath, Khan grabs the rope in an attempt to send Molly to a grounded spike in the water only for Jake to rescue her. \n\nThe Thai authorities arrive with O'Day and Anderson. Jake is relieved to see the film finally get shut down. The Thai authorities blow up the bamboo dome as Molly and Jake celebrate as they can start their lives over together.\n\n\nAccording to an interview with actor Loren Avedon, he shot his scenes independently with his scenes involving Richard Jaeckel as his boss. In addition, in the scene where Avedon's character does the Stallone-like scream after seeing Khan and remember the death of his brother, Avedon told director Lo he wanted to just toss the tape into the fire in anger. However, the director didn't allow it so Avedon ended doing the scream. He also did not get along well with Sherrie Rose, who played his girlfriend in the film. Avedon claimed Rose was acting like a prima donna and told her to \"shut up\" and she had bad mouthed him afterwards.\n\nAccording to an interview with screenwriter/producer Keith W. Strandberg, actress Sherrie Rose had issues with a scene where she was to go topless in a love scene with co-star Loren Avedon. She replaced an actress who refused to do the nudity scene but she also had complained once it was time to shoot the scene. However, the filmmakers were careful in only getting a few seconds of the nudity in the scene. Strandberg also confirmed that Billy Blanks' character of Khan is actually the son of a Thai mother abandoned by his American serviceman father, thus Khan having a hatred for Americans.\n\nThe film has some noticeable similarities to the Jean-Claude Van Damme film \"Kickboxer\", which was released a year earlier and features similar locations, plot and general atmosphere.\n\n\"King Of The Kickboxers\" was actually the fourth film In the No Retreat No Surrender/Karate Tiger Film series, preceded by \"No Retreat No Surrender\", \"No Retreat No Surrender 2 Raging Thunder\" and \"No Retreat No Surrender 3 Blood Brothers\". \n\nIn 1991 Seasonal Films released \"American Shaolin\" which was marketed as being \"King Of The Kickboxers Part II\", So there was speculation that it was \"No Retreat No Surrender 5\" until in 2017 when the film \"The Town Monger\" by Kufewa Acrobatics was released in Malawi it was announced that that was \"No Retreat No Surrender 5\", making \"American Shaolin\" its own standalone film outside the No Retreat No surrender canon and \"The Town Monger\" essentially being \"No Retreat No Surrender 5 The Town Monger\" or \"The King of The Kickboxers Part II\".\n\nJames Goddard, former member of Research and Development at Capcom confirmed in an interview with Capcom Unity that Blanks' character of Khan was the inspiration for his creating the character of Dee Jay in the video game \"Super Street Fighter II\" in 1993.\n\n"}

It is very distinctive with a very broad flattened abdomen, four wing patches and, in the male, the abdomen becomes pruinose blue.\n\nThe male and female have a broad, flattened abdomen which is brown with yellow patches down the sides. In the male the abdomen develops a blue pruinosity that covers the brown colour. Both fore and hind wings have a dark patch at the base. Both the male and female have broad antehumeral stripes. The average wingspan is approximately 70 mm. \"L. depressa\" is very distinctive and should not be confused with any other dragonflies in the region.\n\n\"L. depressa\" is found in central and southern Europe, central Asia and the Middle East. It range extends northwards to southern Scotland, southern Sweden and southern Finland and it occurs on some Mediterranean islands including Corsica, Sardinia, Sicily, and Menorca. Its range does not extend beyond southern Europe into Africa.\n\n\"L. depressa\" is seen near still-water lakes and ponds, feeding on many types of small insects. They occur in both bare and sunny locations, where it is often the first dragonfly to colonise new habitats such as newly created ponds, and well vegetated ponds. \"L. depressa\" are often seen away from water as the adults are very mobile and undergo a period of maturation away from water after emergence. The adults are also migratory.\n\nThe flight period is from April to September but are mostly seen in May and June. Their flight is very fast as they dart and dive above the water. They are very territorial and will fight with rival males and any other dragonflies they happen to encounter. They characteristically return to a favoured perch, in the sun. When a female enters a male's territory the male will fly up and grab the female. Mating occurs on the wing and the pair are in tandem for only a brief period, often less than a minute. The pair separate and the female will find a suitable location for ovipositing, usually a stretch of open water with submerged vegetation. The female oviposits in flight, hovering above the water and dipping the tip of her abdomen in.\nThe eggs hatch in 4 or 5 weeks and the larvae take one to two years to develop. The larvae live in the silt and detritus at the bottom of the pond, lying buried in mud with just the head and eyes showing. After emergence the adults move away from water and undergo a period of maturation which lasts 10 to 14 days.\n\nThis species is usually placed in the genus \"Libellula\" but there is some evidence, based on RNA and DNA analysis, that this species should be placed within the genus \"Ladona\" (Artiss et al., 2001). This change is not yet generally accepted and books and field guides list this species as \"Libellula\"\n\n\n"}

It was held every second year after 1991 until 2013 when it began to be held annually. It has been an open event since 2014. Although the official brand name and organizations of the event have changed over recent years, many Scrabble enthusiasts from more than 30 countries compete to become World Scrabble Champion. The reigning World Scrabble Champion is Nigel Richards, who won his fourth title at the 2018 Mattel World Scrabble Championships by winning the final in London in 2018.\n\nSponsorship of the World Scrabble Championship (WSC) formerly alternated between Hasbro and Mattel, the North American and global owners of the Scrabble trademark, respectively. However, after Hasbro declined to sponsor WSC 2005, Mattel has organized and sponsored all championships. Mind Sports International (MSI) began sponsoring the event in 2013 after successfully organizing their own major Scrabble tournament in Prague in 2012. As of 2018, it is now sponsored by Mindsports Academy.\n\nThe number of players competing in the tournament has risen steadily over time, from 48 in 1991 to 108 in 2009. Each country is allocated seats for the championship, and individual countries' national associations determine which of their players represent them. This is typically done by means of a national rating system or qualifier tournaments. A good performance by a national team according to specific criteria will earn further permanent places for that country.\n\nThe official dictionary, used in the majority of English-language Scrabble-playing countries and colloquially known as SOWPODS (an anagram of OSPD and OSW), was used until 2007. It is a combination of two dictionaries: OSPD (Official Scrabble Players Dictionary), published in the US, and OSW (Official Scrabble Words), published in the UK. Local tournaments used only their respective dictionary for the tournament, and each contains words chiefly used and spelled in US English and UK English. Since 2007, Collins supplies the only dictionary used in the WSC, Collins Scrabble Words, which is published in the UK. It was updated on 21 May, 2015 before later being approved by the World English-Language Scrabble Players Association (WESPA) for tournaments on 1 September.\n\nOn May 17, 2013, Mattel announced that the event would be renamed the Scrabble Champions Tournament, and the tournament would be held annually as part of Mind Sports International's Prague Mind Sports Festival. MSI introduced a 'Last Chance Qualifier' tournament, giving players a last opportunity to qualify for 5 places in the main event if they failed to achieve a place on their national team. A four-way knockout stage was introduced for the top four finishers, which consisted of a best-of-3 semi-final followed by a best-of-5 final. Nigel Richards became World Champion here, making him the first player to defend his world title.\n\nIn 2014 the Scrabble Champions Tournament continued in London, but it became an open event, with all players invited to compete. A quarter-final stage was added, meaning that the top 8 progressed to the knockout stages. Craig Beevers won the event, making him the first British World Scrabble Champion since Mark Nyman in 1993.\n\nIn 2015, following cancellation of the SCT, Mattel and MSI agreed to allow WESPA to organize their own traditional unofficial World Championship, branded the WESPA Championship (WESPAC). It was held in Perth, Australia and followed the invitational format of pre-MSI WSC events. 130 players qualified to play. Wellington Jighere of Nigeria emerged as WESPA Champion after beating Lewis Mackay 4–0 in the final.\n\nIn 2016, the tournament was renamed the \"MSI World Championships\" and was split into two divisions based on players' rankings. MSI also hosted world championships in other languages, including French, German, Spanish and Catalan, alongside the French Duplicate Championship.\n\nThe 2017 MSI World Championships were to be held in Doha, Qatar in August 2017, but on 13 June it was announced that the tournament was to be relocated to Nottingham, United Kingdom. It followed the same format as the 2016 event. This was won by Australian David Eldar. The second WESPA Championships (first held in 2015) were held in Nairobi, Kenya in November and were won by Akshay Bhandarkar.\n\nThe 2018 event, renamed again the Mattel World Scrabble Championships, was organised by Mindsports Academy. The main event was held in Torquay, Devon, but the best-of-5 final was held in London to celebrate the game’s 70th anniversary. The event was won by Nigel Richards.\n\n\n"}

As needs have arisen, MF has developed a broad portfolio of professional degrees for church and school. The religious demography of Norway has changed significantly. There is an increasing need and demand for knowledge and quality in research on, education in and communication about religion and society. MF meets this challenge through interdisciplinary research on religion and society, along with relevant bachelor, master and ph.d. degrees in theology, religion and society.\n\nMF has two centers:\n\n\"MF KOM – Center for Excellence in Research, Development and Communication for Church and Congregation\". This center is an intermediary between scholars at MF and church workers who wish to utilize MF's competency in their own contexts.\n\n\"MF Center for the Advanced Study of Religion, MF CASR\", organizes the research on religion done at MF. It facilitates joint projects between MF and other institutions. MF CASR encompasses areas of research including religious studies, history of religion, philosophy of religion, texts and manuscript research, cultural and art history, along with sociology of religion.\n\n\"Norwegian Philological Institute\" (PHI) is affiliated with and located at MF. The cooperation involves offering courses in classical languages connected with major world religions and cultures.\n\nMF's areas of activity are education, research and communication.\n\nBeginning as a confessional school, today it is an ecumenical inclusive school offering education specific to a number of denominations (Lutheran, Methodist, Catholic, Salvation Army and Pentecostal).\n\nMF was founded in 1907 by a body of people (Norwegian academics, politicians, clergy and lay people) wanting to build the education and research on the Holy Scriptures and the Lutheran Confessions.\n\nThe main reason for the establishing of the School was an appointment to a professoriate at the Faculty of Theology at University of Oslo. The Chair of Systematic Theology was vacant after the death of Fredrik Petersen in 1903, and in 1906 the liberal theologian Johannes Ording was appointed to the Chair. Ording was appointed after a lengthy debate which almost led to a crisis in the Government of Norway. It was not supported by the other leading professors at the faculty, and Sigurd Odland at the Faculty of Theology and the Minister of Church Affairs Christopher Knudsen in the Government left their positions following the appointment.\n\nNotable people in the society and the Church gathering around Odland then took steps to found an independent institution training the clergy. The founding charter was signed October 16, 1907, and the School was opened in the autumn of 1908 with only 8 students (a number that increased to 14 before the end of the first term). The earliest teachers were Sigurd Odland (New Testament), Edvard Sverdrup (Church history), Peter Hognestad (Old Testament), Ole Hallesby (Systematic theology). From 1919 the members of academic staff was granted the right to call themselves professors.\n\nThe school grew steadily, and in 1913 MF was given the right to offer degrees in Theology, and also in Practical Theology from 1925. The school expanded in 1967 and an institute of Christian theology was founded giving a minor, major and a master's degree in Christian Studies. 1977 the school started to train Christian Educators (catechists).\nA major step was the right to award the doctoral degree in 1990. The school was the first private school given the right to do this, and in 2005 the school was accredited as a specialized university institution by the Norwegian authorities. In 2018 the school changed its name from \"MF Norwegian School of Theology\" to \"MF Norwegian School of Theology, Religion and Society\".\n\nMF Norwegian School of Theology, Religion and Society awards the following degrees: bachelor, master, candidatus/a theologiae and Ph.D.\n\nIt offers the following programmes of study that results in the mentioned degrees:\n\nKjell Magne Bondevik,\nValgerd Svarstad Haugland,\nTorild Skogsholm, Helen Bjørnøy.\n\nBjørn Eidsvåg,\nMorten Harket\n\nJan Kjærstad,\nOle Hallesby\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2226259", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2226259", "title": "Massimo Tamburini", "text": "Massimo Tamburini\n\nMassimo Tamburini (November 28, 1943 – April 6, 2014) was an Italian motorcycle designer for Cagiva, Ducati, and MV Agusta, and one of the founders of Bimota. Tamburini's designs are iconic in their field, with one critic calling him the \"Michelangelo of motorbike design\". His Ducati 916 and MV Agusta F4 were included in the Guggenheim Museum's \"The Art of the Motorcycle\" exhibit of 1998–1999.\n\nHe lived and worked in San Marino at the Cagiva Research Center (, CRC), a subsidiary of Cagiva now MV Agusta, from which he retired on December 31, 2008.\n\nTamburini was born on November 28, 1943 in Rimini, where his family were farmers. Although he aspired to attend university, for financial reasons he instead attended the \"Istituto Tecnico Industriale di Rimini\", a technical school in Rimini. According to his biography published by the City of Rimini, he did not finish his technical education for health reasons, and began working at age 18 on heating ductwork.\n\nTamburini said, \"I have always had a huge passion for motorcycles—my mother used to complain about it when I was a little boy, calling it my obsession! I have never had any desire to design anything else.\" His exposure to the motorcycle industry began when he attended the world championship race at Monza in 1961. Captivated by the sound of the MV Agusta's four stroke engine ridden by Provini, and entirely self-taught in design, Tamburini eventually devoted his life to the making of motorcycles.\n\nWhile Tamburini owned a heating business in his home town of Rimini, he was becoming known for his race tuning, improving motorcycles' power and handling, as well as making them lighter. Rimini was a motorcycling enthusiast's town, being near a Benelli motorcycle factory, and the site of many road races following World War II. The MV Agusta 600 four was Tamburini's particular specialty, for which he was known \"throughout Italy\", according to Mick Walker, who said, \"the transformation of what had been an ugly and slow touring bike into a sleek and fast sportster was truly sensational.\"\n\nTamburini created his first motorcycle design in 1971, customizing an MV Agusta 750 Sport by welding the frame himself.\n\nIn 1973, Tamburini, Valerio Bianchi, and Giuseppe Morri founded Bimota. Previously the three had been designing and fabricating air conditioning ducts. The company name was a portmanteau of the first letters of their last names, Bi, Mo, Ta. Speaking of motorcycles of the future, Tamburini summed up his design philosophy by saying, \"The ideal one would be a 750 with the power of a 1000 and the weight of a 500. You don't need a huge amount of power on a road bike, but it's important to have light weight as well.\" Tamburini criticized the Ducati ST2, saying, \"I think the ST2 is an attempt to follow a Japanese concept, and this shouldn't be done by Italians.\"\n\nAfter 11 years at Bimota, Tamburini left and for a short time joined Roberto Gallina's 500 cc Grand Prix world championship team. Then, in February 1985, he joined Claudio Castiglioni's Cagiva Group. Cagiva had acquired Ducati that year, and Tamburini worked designing both Ducati and Cagiva brand motorcycles.\n\nIn 1985, Bimota was under \"controlled administration\", or \"fallimento\", similar to US Chapter 11 reorganization and Tamburini had officially left the company, Giuseppe Morri having purchased Tamburini's Bimota stock. Tamburini's successor as chief designer at Bimota was Federico Martini. Even though Tamburini was in his new position as head of Cagiva's design studio, he continued work back at Bimota, in spite of the falling out with his partners that led to his departure, working on the Bimota DB1 prototype, a bike that used the engine of the Ducati Pantah 750, which was to be presented at EICMA, the Milan motorcycle show. Martini was responsible for the engineering of the DB1, Tamburini, as a consultant to Cagiva, handled the styling.\n\nThe first Ducati he designed was the Paso 750, a bike that helped move fully enclosing bodywork into the mainstream.\n\nTamburini later designed the now classic Ducati 916. South African motorcycle designer Pierre Terblanche and Tamburini were working side by side at the Cagiva Research Center (CRC) on new designs, Tamburini on the 916 and Terblanche on the Ducati Supermono. Terblanche's Supermono, which shared several visual cues with the Tamburini's 916, was shown to the public before the 916, leaving the impression that Tamburini was influenced by Terblanche. In fact, the influence was the other way around, with Terblanche incorporating ideas that Tamburini shared with him in the design studio from his 916 design. Journalist Kevin Ash said that the roots of the 916's styling were found elsewhere, outside Ducati and CRC. Ash said that the timing of the public debut of Honda's advanced oval-piston, 32-valve V4 engine Grand Prix racing bike, the NR750, in August 1991, indicates that NR750 influenced the final shape of the 916, though Tamburini, Terblanche and others at Ducati would not confirm this, Tamburini only saying that he was influenced by \"existing designs.\" Ash said that Tamburini showed a better understanding of visual weight than the NR750's designers, and the 916 design, \"moved it forward, personalized, and Ducati-fied it, in particular the blend of sharp edges and sweeping curves, which, like most innovation, broke existing rules.\"\n\nWhen the Castiglioni brothers sold Ducati in 1996, Tamburini stayed with Cagiva, where he designed the MV Agusta F4 to great acclaim. While designing the F4 c. 1996, he was diagnosed with prostate cancer; his son Andrea said he wanted to survive the illness long enough to finish the F4 and save MV Agusta. \"s Brian Catterson spotted Tamburini riding his creation, the F4, in the hills of Tuscany during the 2001 \"Motorgiro d'Italia\". Tamburini retired from Cagiva in December, 2008.\n\nTamburini was diagnosed with lung cancer in November 2013 and underwent chemotherapy near his residence in San Marino. His health continued to decline, and he died on April 6, 2014 at age 70. Around 500 people attended his funeral in Rimini on April 9, including the mayor in his official capacity.\n\n\nTamburini was awarded the \"Sigismondo d'Oro\" in 2012, the highest award of the city of Rimini.\n\n\n"}

It is one of the most common dragonflies in Europe, occurring in a wide variety of water bodies, though with a preference for breeding in still water such as ponds and lakes. In the south of its range adults are on the wing all year round.\n\n\"Sympetrum\" species are not easy to tell apart and in most areas more than one \"Sympetrum\" species will occur. Females and teneral individuals have light yellow thorax and abdomen. Males turn red as they mature. Females darken with age, becoming a dark chocolate brown, and sometimes develop a blue colouration to the bottom of the abdomen. The wings also develop a brown tinge with age. In all cases the legs have a cream or yellow stripe on a black background - this is a diagnostic feature of this species. The pterostigma of the females can be red, blue, pale blue or brown.\nAdults can be seen on the wing all year round in southern Europe but in northern regions they occur from June to November.\n\nThis small dragonfly is seen in a wide variety of habitats, including lakes, ponds, canals and slow-flowing rivers. They are ambush predators, waiting on a prominent perch - such as a leaf or the top of a gate, until prey fly past, whereupon they will fly after it. They are territorial on breeding waters, often attempting to chase much bigger dragonflies away such as southern hawkers. This habit of repeatedly returning to a sunny spot allows you to easily predict where they are going to land, which is why it is one of the easiest dragonflies to photograph.\n\nIn suitable hunting areas away from water, however, they are not territorial: large numbers may assemble - groups of several hundred in a single field have been recorded - and lines of insects can be seen along the top of field gates.\n\nEggs are not laid, but broadcast from the air: the male holds the female in tandem and swings her down and forward over water. At the furthest point of the arc the female releases some of her eggs to fall on the water.\n\nThis is one of the most abundant dragonflies in Europe, and populations show no evidence of decline.\n\nA taxon named the highland darter used to be considered a separate species, \"Sympetrum nigrescens\". It is found in Ireland, Scotland and Norway. It may be the same taxon as the island darter, formally \"S. nigrifemur\", both being a subspecies of \"S. striolatum\".\n\n\n"}

It is one of the founding texts of Brazilian modernism.\n\nThe novel follows a young man, Macunaíma, \"a hero without a character,\" born in the Brazilian jungle and possessing strange and remarkable abilities—mostly shapeshifting—, as he travels to São Paulo and back again. The protagonist is often considered a representation of the Brazilian personality. The novel employs a composite structure using elements of what would later be called magic realism and a number of dialects of both interior Brazil and São Paulo. It is based on Andrade's research in language, culture, folklore, and music of the indigenous peoples in Brazil.\n\nMacunaíma was an attempt on the part of Andrade to write a novel which represented pan-Brazilian cultura and language.. The author desired to write Macunaíma in the spoken language of Brazil. Macunaíma's catch phrase \"Ai, que preguiça!\" is a pun in both Tupi language and Portuguese as \"Ai\" is a Tupi word for sloth and \"preguiça\" is Portuguese for sloth. This is an example of Andrade using a fused language to write this text, which begins with a simple description \"In the depths of the virgin jungle was born Macunaíma, hero of our people. He was jet black and son of the fear of the night\".\n\nConsidered a \"rhapsody\" by Andrade himself, Macunaíma is a melding of the cultures of Brazil. Most of the folk lore contained within the text is taken directly from native stories; Lucia Sá has shown that Andrade's novel draws heavily on the narratives of the Pemon people that were collected and recorded by Theodor Koch-Grünberg.\n\nIn the tale, Macunaíma travels from his home tribe in the jungle to São Paulo and back again, with chase scenes that go all over the country of in between, in order to retrieve an amulet which he lost. The amulet had been given to him by his lover, Ci before she ascended into the sky to become a star. He encounters all sorts of folk legends and orixas along the way. The interactions which Macunaíma had with most of these characters was imagined by Andrade, though the essence of the folk lore remains true.\n\nIn 1969, the Brazilian production company Filmes do Serro made a film based on the novel, but with a substantially different storyline. The story takes place in Rio de Janeiro rather than São Paulo, and is set at more or less the time the film was made..\n\n"}

Scicluna worked primarily in Canada until 1965, when he ventured to the World Wide Wrestling Federation (WWWF), now known as WWE, using his most famous moniker \"Baron\" Mikel Scicluna.\n\nScicluna was famous for entering the ring with a royal blue cape over his shoulders, indicating that he was of Maltese royal descent. Scicluna was also known for being a master of the \"foreign object\", mainly utilizing a roll of coins to bash opponents out of sight of the referee. He enjoyed success as a tag team wrestler, winning the WWWF United States Tag Team Championship with Smasher Sloan on September 22, 1966, in Washington, D.C.

In the first match at MSG against Sammartino he was disqualified; Sammartino scored the pin in a rematch. Scicluna went on to lose a series of matches to Spiros Arion. In June 1976, Scicluna found himself part of history, as the opponent for Gorilla Monsoon on the night Monsoon engaged in an impromptu tussle with boxing great Muhammad Ali. Scicluna was wrestling Monsoon in a televised match and was sent over the top rope to the floor after receiving a Manchurian Chop. Scicluna waved off his opponent and walked off, taking a countout loss. From there, Ali entered the ring from the audience and tried to jab at Monsoon. Monsoon responded by dropping Ali with an airplane spin. This angle was a part of the buildup toward Ali's infamous boxer vs. wrestler match with Antonio Inoki later in the month.\n\nScicluna retired from active competition in 1983. He was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame class of 1996.\n\nHe was the son of Vincenzo Scicluna and Maria (née' Catania) who were married in Mosta, Malta, on 27 August 1927. He was named after his paternal grandfather Michele Scicluna. In retirement, he lived in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He also worked as a driver for the \"New York Times\". He had a wife, Gloria, and one son. Scicluna died March 20, 2010, from pancreatic cancer.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2226284", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2226284", "title": "Al-Amir bi-Ahkam Allah", "text": "Al-Amir bi-Ahkam Allah\n\nAbu Ali al-Mansur ibn al-Musta'li (; 31 December 1096 – 7 October 1130), better known by his regnal name al-Amir bi-Ahkam Allah () was the tenth Fatimid Caliph, and the 20th Imam of Musta'li Isma'ili sect of Shia Islam, from 1101 to his death in 1130.\n\nThe future al-Amir was born on 31 December 1096 to the Caliph al-Musta'li (). In December 1101, his father died, and at the age of five he was proclaimed caliph by the all-powerful vizier, al-Afdal Shahanshah. Al-Afdal was al-Amir's maternal uncle, and further strengthened the familial ties with the young caliph by marrying him to his own daughter. A decree, dictated by al-Afdal, renewed his appointment as vizier with plenipotentiary powers and ensured his ascendancy over the child-caliph. The first twenty years of al-Amir's reign were thus dominated by al-Afdal, who controlled government and restricted al-Amir to a few ceremonial duties. \n\nDuring this period, the main preoccupation of the Fatimid state was the conflict with the Crusaders of the Kingdom of Jerusalem. The holy war was also the main legitimization for al-Afdal's rule and for the dynasty itself: as the historian Michael Brett writes, following the territorial losses and Nizari schism of the previous decade, that had weakened both the Fatimid state (the \"dawla\") and the Fatimid Isma'ili mission (the \"daʿwa\"), the Crusade \"had given the dynasty fresh purpose\". Despite al-Afdal's continuous campaigns, however, most of Palestine was lost to the Crusaders, along with the coastal cities of Tartus (1102), Acre (1103), Tripoli (1109), and Sidon (1111). Egypt itself briefly invaded by King Baldwin I of Jerusalem in 1117. The Fatimids largely fell back on the coastal city of Ascalon, which developed into a major fortress and outpost (\"ribāṭ\") of the holy war: for the next half-century it was to remain a centre for raids against the Crusader territories, and a guard of the route from Palestine into Egypt. Medieval historians often blame al-Amir for these disasters, but in reality he played no role in the Fatimid government during those years. \n\nAl-Afdal's tutelage ended with his assassination at the hands of Nizari agents in December 1121. Given his own resentment at the subordinate figurehead role in which al-Afdal had relegated him, al-Amir is often suspected of having been complicit in the act. While engaging a public display of grief for his vizier's death, al-Amir moved quickly to imprison al-Afdal's sons and confiscate al-Afdal's enormous wealth, houses, and estates, and brought the moveable items to his own palace. So great was the treasure amassed by al-Afdal that it was considered to have been larger than that of any previous king, and it took forty days to move it. \n\nAs had been left out of government and was unfamiliar with its intricacies, al-Amir selected al-Afdal's long-time chief of staff, al-Ma'mun al-Bata'ihi, as vizier. Al-Ma'mun was a capable administrator, but also much weaker vis-à-vis the caliph than his old master had been: al-Amir resumed many of the old caliphal functions that al-Afdal had assumed for himself, and he henceforth had a voice in government. Al-Amir is portrayed in the sources as \"unusually intelligent and knowledgeable\", and was said to have memorized the Quran.\n\nIn the aftermath of the assassination of al-Afdal, the threat of the Nizaris, who were implacably hostile to the rule of al-Amir and his father, was a major concern of the government, in view of the widespread network of agents they had established. In December 1122 al-Amir convened a meeting of officials in Cairo in which the Nizari claims to the imamate were publicly denounced, and the legitimacy of the Musta'li claims affirmed. A proclamation to that effect, the \"al-Hidāya al-Āmiriyya\", was issued on this occasion and has been preserved to the present day. Al-Amir also paid attention to court the remaining pro-Fatimid Musta'li communities abroad, especially in Yemen, where he sent rich gifts to the Sulayhid queen Arwa al-Sulayhi in 1123. In the same year, the Zirid emir of Ifriqiya, Abu'l-Hasan al-Hasan ibn Ali, also sent envoys to Cairo to announce his return to recognizing Fatimid suzerainty and sought Fatimid assistance in repelling a possible Norman invasion. \n\nIn 1123, the Luwata Berbers invaded Egypt and reached as far as Alexandria, before they were driven back by al-Ma'mun. The war against the Crusaders continued with the loss of Tyre in 1124.\n\nBy 1125, al-Amir began to resent al-Ma'mun's attempts to restrict his authority, and in October 1125 had him, his brother, and his chief aides arrested. They were executed in 1128. Instead of appointing a new vizier, al-Amir now ruled in person, relying on the heads of the various administrative departments for governance. One of them, the Christian Abu Najah ibn Fanna, quickly rose to prominence due to his ability to provide the caliph with money through confiscations from Christians, Jews, and eventually Muslims as well. His ascendancy lasted for three years before he was denounced, arrested, and executed. Having ignored the matter for so long, al-Amir's own reputation was left tarnished from the affair, as well as from his extravagance and profligacy: it is said that the palace consumed 5,000 sheep per month, and the rich gifts he made to his favourites were remarked upon. \n\nIn February/March 1130, al-Amir finally had a son, who was named al-Tayyib. His birth was celebrated with public festivals, and letters were sent abroad announcing his birth as the designated successor. \n\nOn 7 October 1130, al-Amir was assassinated by Nizari agents. He left only a six-month-old son, Abu'l-Qasim al-Tayyib, to succeed him, with no designated regent or serving vizier. Al-Amir's murder not only undid his attempts to once again concentrate power in the caliph's hands instead of over-mighty generals and ministers, but also, given the fragility of succession, endangered the very survival of the Fatimid dynasty. \n\nAl-Tayyib was quickly sidelined, and his fate is unknown; it is unclear whether he died in infancy or was killed. A new regime installed under the regency of his cousin Abd al-Majid which claimed to rule in the name of an unborn son by one of al-Amir's concubines. This regime did not last long, as an army mutiny brought al-Afdal's last surviving son, Kutayfat, to power. Kutayfat abolished the Fatimid dynasty, but was himself assassinated by Fatimid loyalists in December 1131. With no other heir available, Abd al-Majid took over as imam and caliph with the regnal name al-Hafiz li-Din Allah in January 1132, proclaiming that he had received the designation by al-Amir before he had died. \n\nAl-Hafiz' succession broke a continuous line of father-to-son succession of ten generations, something extremely rare in the Islamic world and much remarked upon by medieval authors. Al-Hafiz' accession thus represented an unprecedented departure from the accepted norm, and caused yet another schism in Isma'ilism, as the Musta'li sect was divided into those who accepted al-Hafiz' succession (the \"Hafizis\") and those who did not, upholding instead the imamate of al-Tayyib (the \"Tayyibis\"). The former were mostly concentrated in the Fatimid domains in Egypt, Nubia, and the Levant, while the latter in the Yemen, where Queen Arwa took up a leading role in forming a separate Tayyibi \"daʿwa\".\n\n\n"}

In Balinese gong kebyar styles, there are two types of gangsa typically used: the smaller, higher pitched kantilan and the larger pemade. Each instrument consists of several tuned metal bars (either iron or bronze) each placed over an individual resonator. The bars are hit with a wooden panggul, each producing a different pitch. Duration of sound intensity and sound quality factors are generally accomplished by damping the vibration of the bar with the fingers of the free hand. Balinese gong kebyar gangsas, as with other metallophones in gong kebyar ensembles, are played in neighboring pairs with interlocking, rapid-tempo parts that elaborate on the melody of a piece of music (see Kotekan); these pairs are tuned to be dissonant and create certain wavelengths of sympathetic vibrations to create a shimmering tone (see Ombak) that travels long distances. The gangsa is very similar to the old gendér and the saron.\n\nA gajah is also the name of a completely different one, which is indigenous to the cultures found in the mountain regions (the Cordillera) of the northern Philippines. The gangsa of the northern Philippines is a single hand-held smooth-surfaced gong with a narrow rim. A set of gangsa, which is played one gong per musician, consists of gangsa tuned to different notes, depending on regional or local cultural preferences. The number of gangsa in a set varies with availability, and depends on the tradition of a particular ethnic group of the Luzon Cordillera: Kalinga, Ifugao, Bontoc, etc.\n\nAmong the Kalinga people in the Cordillera region of Luzon Island, the gangsa is played in two ways. One way is called \"toppaya\" and the other is called \"palook.\" In \"toppaya\" style, the musicians play the surface of the gangsa with their hand while in a sitting position, with a single gangsa resting on the lap of each musician. In the \"palook\" style, a gangsa is suspended from the musician's left hand and played with a padded stick held in the musician's right hand. In the \"palook\" style of playing, the players are standing, or they keep in step with the dancers while bending forward slightly.\n"}

The choriamb is sometimes regarded as the \"nucleus\" of Aeolic verse, because the pattern long-short-short-long pattern occurs, but to label this a \"choriamb\" is potentially misleading.\n\nIn the prosody of English and other modern European languages, \"choriamb\" is sometimes used to describe four-syllable sequence of the pattern stressed-unstressed-unstressed-stressed (again, a trochee followed by an iamb): for example, \"over the hill\", \"under the bridge\", and \"what a mistake!\".\n\nIn English, the choriamb is often found in the first four syllables of iambic pentameter verses, as here in Keats' \"To Autumn\":\n\n"}

He was well known for his role as Dr. Joe Gannon in the television drama \" Medical Center\", which aired on CBS from 1969 to 1976.\n\nHe was born in South Bend, Indiana, in 1937, to Virdeen Ruth (née Hopper) and Harry Clyde \"Ted\" Cramton. His father was a racecar driver as well as a racing mechanic and an auto parts salesman. Some confusion existed regarding the year of his birth. According to \"The Washington Post\", \"many reference sources list Mr. Everett's date of birth as 1936, but legal records indicate he was born one year later. He routinely gave his age as consistent with a birth date in 1937.\" His name was later changed to Chad Everett by his agent Henry Willson.\n\nEverett said he did not mind the change because he was tired of explaining his real name, \"Raymon-no-D, Cramton-no-P.\" He was raised in Dearborn, Michigan, where he attended Fordson High School. While there, he played on the football team as a quarterback and began acting in stage plays at age 14. Later, during his junior year at Wayne State University in Detroit, he joined a State Department-sponsored acting troupe that toured India. \"I went into acting because I'm easily bored\", Everett once said. \"Acting seemed to give vent to a lot of different feelings.\" He graduated from WSU with a degree in drama.\n\nEverett's first notable role came in an episode of the ABC/Warner Bros. 1960-1962 detective series \"Surfside 6\". His first major role came a year later in the film \"Claudelle Inglish\", and he subsequently played a deputy in the short-lived 1963 ABC Western television series \"The Dakotas\", which featured Jack Elam as a fellow lawman. After appearing in a number of movies and television series in the later 1960s, he got his big break, landing the role of Dr. Joe Gannon on the innovative medical drama, \"Medical Center\", with costar James Daly.\n\nHe appeared in numerous films and television series, including \"The Singing Nun\", \"Centennial\", \"Hagen\", \"\", \"Star Command\", and \"Mulholland Drive\". He also appeared as a guest star in more than 40 television series such as \"Redigo\", \"Melrose Place\", \"The Nanny\", \"Touched by an Angel\", \"\", \"Caroline in the City\", \"Murder, She Wrote\", \"The Red Skelton Show\", \"The Man from U.N.C.L.E.\", and \"Route 66\".\n\nIn 1972, Everett had a much-publicized dispute with actress and comedian Lily Tomlin. During the taping of the March 31, 1972, telecast of \"The Dick Cavett Show\", Everett was asked by Cavett what animals he owned. Everett replied: \"I have three horses and three dogs and a wife.\" When asked if he would like to think about the billing order, Everett said: \"No, no. She's the most beautiful animal I own.\" Tomlin, who is a lesbian and a feminist, was taken aback by the remark. She said, \"You own? I have to leave\" and walked off the set. In response, Everett made an unflattering allusion to Tomlin's sexual preferences.\n\nIn 1986, Everett's awarded star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame was unveiled.\n\nIn 1987, Everett supplied the voice of Ultraman Chuck in the English version of the animated movie \"\" and voiced several characters in the animated television series \"The New Yogi Bear Show\". He hosted Trinity Broadcasting Network's \"Master's Theater\". He was selected by the family of John Wayne to be the voice of the animatronic figure of Wayne in Disney's Hollywood Studios' \"Great Movie Ride\". Based on Patrick Wayne's suggestion, Everett also provided the voice of John Wayne in a scene that only appears in the VHS version of \"\" (replacing the Hulk Hogan scene that appeared in the theatrical and DVD versions).\n\nIn 2001, Everett played one brief scene with Naomi Watts in David Lynch's \"Mulholland Drive\". \"Salon\" online magazine cited this scene as \"the heart of the movie\".\n\nEverett authored and self-published a book of romantic poetry, which he dedicated to wife Shelby Grant.\n\nFor many years, Everett co-hosted the Labor Day Jerry Lewis Telethon, which raises money and awareness for and about the affliction of muscular dystrophy.\n\nEverett married actress Shelby Grant in Tucson, Arizona, on May 22, 1966. Everett was on location in Tucson filming the 1967 movie, \"Return of the Gunfighter\", at the time of their wedding. They had two daughters, Katherine and Shannon Everett. The couple remained married for 45 years until her death after a brain aneurysm on June 25, 2011. Everett credited his family with being a stabilizing force in his life, stating that even in the worst of times, Grant \"never threatened to leave. She would tell me that she was there for me. If not for my family, I would have been in big trouble.\" Grant noted his romanticism; he sent her so many flowers during their courtship that \"my balcony looked like a burial ground.\" He also often wrote sentimental poems to Grant throughout their marriage, as well as to his daughters. The couple renewed their marriage vows every seven years.\n\nAfter \"Medical Center\" ended, Everett became frustrated when no movie roles were forthcoming and television roles were not working out. A long-time social drinker, he began drinking heavily. He was consuming a quart of vodka a day by the time he quit drinking in 1986. \"I was a functional alcoholic.\" Shelby noted his alcohol-related mood swings and has said, \"finally I confronted him. I came into the bedroom with a big pot of coffee one morning and said 'we have a major problem to deal with here.'\" A month later, Everett caught sight of himself on a video and did not like what he saw. \" 'Finally,' I said, 'I am really in trouble'. I stepped outside and I looked up and said, 'Father, you take it. I can't handle it anymore.'\" The next day, he told his daughters (who were living at home at the time), \"I am addicted to alcohol, and I am not going away to detox. I am going to do it here so that you can see what happens to someone if you let a substance take control of you.\" He attended his first Alcoholics Anonymous meeting the next day and claimed he never drank again, attributing his discipline to his Christian faith and his self-pride.\n\nBeginning in 1973, actress Sheila Scott initiated court proceedings against Everett three times, claiming her son Dale (born 1973) was fathered by him. The lengthy and complicated paternity suit finally ended in 1984, when a California Court of Appeals ruled in favor of Everett. The court stated:\n\n\"From the evidence adduced, the jury concluded that Everett was not Dale's father despite the 94.67 percent probability of paternity from the HLA test.\" and \"In this appeal, we affirm a judgment following a jury verdict finding the defendant and respondent not to be the father of the minor child.\"\n\nEverett refused to take any more tests regarding paternity. He entered into a private financial settlement with Scott in 1973, but steadfastly maintained he was not Dale's father. In 1991, Scott was sentenced to three months' probation following a guilty verdict of \"harassing\" Everett for 18 years, including death threats against him and his wife. She was also ordered to undergo psychological testing and to never publicly declare that Everett was Dale's father.\n\nEverett died July 24, 2012, at his home in Los Angeles after an 18-month battle with lung cancer. He was 75 years old.He was cremated and his ashes were combined with the ashes of his wife, Shelby Grant.\n\n"}

Burr was the Voice Director for the series.\n\nThe series was created to launch Marvel Productions, successor of DePatie–Freleng Enterprises, who had previously produced the 1978 \"New Fantastic Four\" and 1979 \"Spider-Woman\" animated series (where Spider-Man made two appearances).\n\nThe character design for Peter Parker (as well as other supporting characters including Aunt May and J. Jonah Jameson) was also quite faithful to the comic books of the period and hearkened back to the illustrations by John Romita Sr. of the young hero in Spider-Man's newspaper strip adventures from the 1970s. Due to network constraints and demands from parents, characters such as Spider-Man were not allowed to make a fist to strike an opponent, but the show's creators managed to conceal these issues with a focus on action and relatively fluid animation.\n\nMuch like the \"Spider-Man\" newspaper strip of the late 1970s, Peter Parker's character design did away with the 1960s crew cut for a more modern hairstyle during this time, which the character continued to be portrayed with through the 1980s and early 1990s.\n\nLikewise; Parker abandoned the conservative suit and tie of the 1960s comics and previous animated series in favor of dark blue straight-legged linen pants; Paired with a hip turquoise/light blue jacket over a yellow turtleneck (although he infrequently wore a button down shirt in the series and put on a tie for the President's arrival at the New York City airport in \"Dr. Doom, Master of the World\"). Stan Lee once remarked that John Romita Sr. often drew Parker with a turtleneck instead of a collared shirt since he felt it would better hide his Spider-Man costume, which was always worn under his street clothes.\n\nPeter's mask was connected to his costume at the back of the neck, almost like a hood, which he would pull over his head when he changed into Spider-Man.\n\n\"Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends\" was originally believed to be something of a sequel to this solo \"Spider-Man\" animated series, although this has since been disputed as both series first aired at the same time on September 12, 1981. The two series are connected in the latter's third-season episode \"Origin of the Spider-Friends.\" Although not as well known as \"Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends\", it does remain faithful to the character's origin. The animation style of both incarnations and incidental music soundtrack are identical, although the voice actors are different.\n\nOne seeming inconsistency is Norman Osborn (The Green Goblin). In this series, his portrayal is similar to that seen in the comics: wearing a costume and having a split personality. In \"Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends\" he seems to be portrayed as having a serious medical condition as a result of a lab accident, and physically transforming into the Goblin. However, at the end of \"Triumph of the Green Goblin\", he is shown falling, with his disguise in shreds (after colliding with electric wires), and tells Spider-Man he'll go back to the clinic he left to be cured, which can be interpreted as either having a treatment for his Goblin transformation or therapy for his split personality.\n\nIn the episode \"The Prison Plot\" of \"Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends\", there is a flashback sequence that depicts a scene from this series' \"When Magneto Speaks...People Listen\", which hints the two shows are, in fact, connected.\n\nDoctor Doom is pulverized by his laser cannon, accidentally tampered by Spider-Man, and Boris, his old assistant, joins the protagonist to be able to stop him, just like Red Skull dies in the decisive battle. However, since Doctor Doom appears in the third episode and his faithful Boris accompanies him as always, just like Red Skull is still alive in the thirteenth episode, \"Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends\" can not be considered the sequel of 1981 TV series.\n\nThe episodes featuring Doctor Doom had an ongoing storyline about rebels in Latveria trying to topple Doom. Throughout these episodes Doom is able to trick people, especially Jameson, into thinking that he is a kind ruler and international humanitarian.\n\nAll 26 episodes have been released on DVD in the UK by Clear Vision, over four DVD volumes. To avoid confusion with other Spider-Man DVD titles, Clear Vision released the show on DVD under the name \"Spider-Man 5000\".\n\nAs was the case with \"Amazing Friends\", the series was later re-aired in the late 1980s as part of the 90-minute \"Marvel Action Universe\", a syndicated series that was used as a platform for old and new Marvel-produced animated fare (the newer programming featured \"\", \"Dino-Riders\" and on occasion, \"\", which was intended to serve as a pilot for a potential X-Men animated series). The show was last rerun in the US in 1998 as part of the \"UPN Kids Action Zone\" block alongside several other Marvel shows.\n\nThe rights to all Marvel shows were owned by Disney, before Marvel acquired them in 2008. Currently there are no plans for a DVD release in the US or elsewhere.\n\nIn Canada, Morningstar Entertainment released the episode \"The Vulture Has Landed\" on DVD in the set entitled \"Spider-Man Vs. The Vulture\". The set also contains \"The Vulture's Prey\" and \"The Dark Terrors\", both from the 1967 \"Spider-Man\" TV series. Morningstar also released \"Canon of Doom\" (on the \"Fantastic Four VS. Doctor Doom\" set, included in the \"Villains Showdown\" Gift Set that also includes \"Spider-Man Vs. The Vulture\"), although the episode is the Bonus episode on the disc. \"Arsenic And Aunt May\" was also released in the \"Heroes\" box set. All the Morningstar DVDs were mastered from VHS/Betamax copies that were released by Prism Video in 1985 as part of their Marvel Video Library series.\n\nThe series was available for streaming on Netflix from 2011 to 2013. The series became available on the Disney+ streaming service at its U.S. launch in November 2019.\n\n"}

Officially, it is named for the Lowell family, but an ornate \"ALL\" woven into the ironwork above the main gate discreetly alludes to Abbott Lawrence Lowell, Harvard's president at the time of construction. Its majestic neo-Georgian design, centered on two landscaped courtyards, received the 1938 Harleston Parker Medal and might be considered the model for later Harvard houses nearby. Lowell House is simultaneously close to the Yard, Harvard Square, and other Harvard \"River\" houses, and its blue-capped bell tower, visible for many miles, is a local landmark.\n\nLowell was one of the first Houses built in the realization of President Lowell's long-held dream of providing on-campus accommodations for every Harvard College student throughout his career at the College. (\"See Harvard College house system.\") Its first Master, was Mathematics Department chairman Julian Lowell Coolidge, who also instituted Monday-night high table. Historian Elliott Perkins was the first to hold the position of Resident Dean (until recently known as the \"Allston Burr Senior Tutor\") then was Master from 1942 to 1963. Classicist Zeph Stewart was the third Master, and William and Mary Lee Bossert served from 1975 to 1998. Current co-Masters Diana Eck and Dorothy Austin are thus only the fifth Masters in Lowell's 80 years. Lowell's sister college at Yale University is Pierson College.\n\nHouse traditions include Masters' Tea on Thursday afternoons, a May Day Waltz at dawn on the Weeks Footbridge, high table, and the annual Lowell House Opera mounted in the dining hall. Springtime brings the Bacchanalia Formal, often with a live swing band in the courtyard.\n\nFor each Arts First event, the first weekend in May, there is a courtyard performance of the \"1812 Overture\", during which those not part of the official orchestral ensemble are encouraged to assist on kazoos; in lieu of cannon, hydrogen-filled balloons are ignited by the House chemistry tutor; and until recently (see below) the performance would climax with the role originally scored by Tchaikovsky for authentic Russian zvon (a \"bell\" in the Slovakina language or \"bell sound\" in Russian), being played (appropriately enough) by Lowell's own authentic Russian zvon.\n\nThere is a winter holiday dinner, and various sophomore, senior, Roundtable and faculty dinners take place throughout the year. Language tables and special-interest tables are common features of everyday lunches and dinners. Many House events are organized by Lowell's \"House Committee\" of elected undergraduates from within the House. The committee operates separately from the Harvard Undergraduate Council (UC), to organize student events and manage funding. The HoCo, as with the other student government organizations in the Houses, is funded by the UC.\n\nLowell House was the residence of Silas (Method Man) and Jamal (Redman) in the 2001 comedy How High.\n\nAs part of Harvard's House Renewal Project, Lowell House closed for renovation in the summer of 2017; work is expected to be completed in the summer of 2019.\n\nDesigned by the firm of Coolidge Shepley Bulfinch and Abbott and constructed in 1930 for $3.62 million,\nthe House was named for the prominent Lowell family, closely identified with Harvard since John Lowell graduated in 1721. The busts of President Abbott Lawrence Lowell (1909–1933) and poet James Russell Lowell, are featured in the main courtyard. In the Dining Hall are portraits of Lowell and his wife Anna Parker Lowell; his sister, poet Amy Lowell; his brother, astronomer Percival Lowell; and his grandfather John Amory Lowell.\n\nPrior to the 1996 transition to randomized House assignments, Lowell's central location, picturesque courtyard, elegant dining hall, and charming traditions made it a popular housing choice.\n\nThe Lowell House arms are those of the Lowell family, blazoned: Shield: sable, a dexter hand couped at the wrist grasping three darts, one in pale and two in saltire, all in argent. The crest is a stag's head cabossed, between the attires a pheon azure. The motto is \"Occasionem Cognosce\" (\"Recognise Opportunity\") (In more prosaic terms, a shield with a black field displays a right hand cut off at the wrist and grasping three arrows, one vertical and two crossed diagonally, in silver. Above is a stag's head mounted behind the ear, and between its antlers is a barbed, broad arrowhead in blue. The house colors are blue and white.\n\nFor three-quarters of a century, Lowell House's bell tower was home to a set of authentic Russian \"zvon\", one of the few complete sets of pre-revolutionary Russian bells surviving anywhere. The eighteen bells were bought in Russia around 1930 by Thomas Whittemore with the financial aid of millionaire Chicago plumbing magnate Charles R. Cranewho reportedly paid merely their value as scrapjust as they were to be melted down by Soviet authorities. Crane donated them to Harvard in 1930 just as plans for Lowell House were nearing completion.\n\nLike those seen today on Dunster and Eliot Houses, Lowell's tower was originally meant to be a \"clock\"-towerLowell's in particular is reminiscent of Philadelphia's Independence Hall, although it was actually modeled after a Dutch church. With word of Crane's gift, the planned tower was changed to the blue-capped bell tower seen today.\n(One of the eighteen bells did not harmonize with the others, so was hung in the Harvard Business School's Baker Library.) \n\nThe bells originally hung in Moscow's Danilov Monastery (now the seat of the Patriarch of the Russian Orthodox Church) and were installed with the help, at first, of musician Konstantin Konstantinovich Saradzhev, and Vsevolod Andronoff, a former resident of the monastery They range in weight from 22 pounds (10 kg) to 26,700 pounds (12,100 kg, and known to Lowell House students as \"Mother Earth\"). The bells are consecrated, and are of great significance to the Russian Orthodox Church, in the liturgy of which bells play an important role.\n\nAt Lowell, the bells were usually rung on Sundays at 1pm by resident Klappermeisters. After the annual Harvard–Yale football game, Harvard's score would sometimes be proclaimed on the \"Mother Earth,\" with Yale's score tolled on the \"Bell of Pestilence, Famine, and Despair.\"\n\nWith the reopening of the Danilov Monastery, it was suggested that the bells be returned to their original home. At Harvard's June 2008 Commencement, they sounded for the last time at Lowell House, after which the bell tower was partially dismantled so that the bells could be withdrawn. In their places were hung newly cast near-replica bells obtained with the financial assistance of the Link of Times Foundation, created by Russian industrialist Viktor Vekselberg.\n\nThe now-departed bells may still be heard on the Lowell House Virtual Bell Tower. The bells sound Sunday afternoons during term time, and at special events such as commencement.\n\nNotable former residents and alumni of Lowell House include:\n\n\n"}

It was the second of two Sprint Cup Series races held at the Auto Club Speedway (the other being the Auto Club 500) and in 2009 and 2010 it was run in October as part of the Chase for the Sprint Cup.\n\nThe event was first held in 2004, added as part of the 2004 NASCAR Realignment, and was partially featured in the film, \"\". From its inception until 2008 the race was run on Labor Day weekend, which was previously the traditional date of the Southern 500 at Darlington, and in the Inland Empire in the 1970s, the former California 500 United States Auto Club Marlboro Championship Trail race. The 2005 race was famous for Kyle Busch becoming the youngest NASCAR Sprint Cup Series winner ever (then known as the Nextel Cup Series).\n\nAs part of the 2009 realignment in NASCAR Auto Club Speedway, Talladega Superspeedway, and Atlanta Motor Speedway agreed to switch dates, with the Atlanta race moving from its traditional fall date to Labor Day weekend and becoming known as the Labor Day Classic 500. The realignment returned the Labor Day weekend race to the southern United States and gave California its first late season race since the final running of the Winston Western 500 at Riverside International Raceway in 1987. The AMP Energy 500 at Talladega moved into the race date vacated by Atlanta, with the Pepsi 500 moving into Talladega's former October date.\n\nThe Pepsi 500 name was used in August 2008, with Pepsi taking title sponsorship from Sharp. This announcement was made by the speedway's website, Pepsi has been the official soft drink sponsor of the speedway since 1997, before Auto Club Speedway became part of International Speedway Corporation, owner of several circuits on the NASCAR schedule. This was done despite ISC signing a contract with Coca-Cola to replace Pepsi as the official soft drink sponsor of its racetracks in 2008 (the contract is slowly being phased in).\n\nNASCAR announced on January 13, 2010 that they would be shortened 100 miles. NASCAR then announced that, due largely to poor attendance, the 2010 running of this race would be the last as Auto Club Speedway returned to a single date on the Sprint Cup schedule as that race was exchanged to Kansas Speedway in 2011 marking a 2nd race date on June 5, 2011.\n\n\n"}

Situated in the Subcarpathian Voivodeship (since 1999), previously in the Krosno Voivodeship (1975–1998) and the Sanok district, Bukowsko subdistrict, located near the towns of Medzilaborce and Palota (in northeastern Slovakia).\n\nNowotaniec is bordered on the east by Bukowsko, on the north by Wola Sękowa, on the west by Nadolany, on the right bank of the Pielnica river (a tributary of the Wisłok), on the left side of the highway nr 889 from the railroad running from Sanok to Krosno, and on the west by forests covering the slopes of the Bukowica Range.\n\nThis village consists of one street which runs north to south displaying Latin church stone and several houses.\n\nThe parish belongs to the Diocese of Przemyśl, deanery of Sanok. It includes, Nagórzany, Nadolany, and Wola Sękowa. \nThe Roman Catholic cemetery is located westward of the village center.\n\nNowotaniec is just up the road from Bukowsko. Historically it has been a mostly Polish village. The region subsequently became part of the Great Moravian state. Upon the invasion of the Hungarian tribes into the heart of the Great Moravian Empire around 899, the Lendians of the area declared their allegiance to Hungarian Empire. The region then became a site of contention between Poland, Kievan Rus' and Hungary starting in at least the 9th century. This area was mentioned for the first time in 981 (by Nestor the Chronicler), when Vladimir the Great of Kiev took the area over on the way into Poland. In 1018 it returned to Poland, 1031 back to Rus', in 1340 Casimir III of Poland recovered it. In the 14th century the Galicia region along with the Sanok district were annexed to Poland by Casimir III the Great of Poland, who began colonisation of these areas (see: Walddeutsche). In the 14th and 15th centuries a number of new settlements were set up, including Trepcza, Czerteż, Prusiek, Nowotaniec, Kostarowce, Tyrawa Solna, Stróże Wielkie and Małe, Hłomcza, Płowce, Sanoczek, Międzybródź. Those settlements were owned by noble and knights’ families. Substantial land was the property of the Kmita family ruling from Sobień Castle, and Bal from Nowotaniec Castle.\n\nNowotaniec, with upper-suburb Nagorzany, a small town in the county of Sanok, lies in a wooded, hilly area on the highway from Zarszyn to Bukowsko ( away). The start of settlement that became Nowotaniec began as a royal village established in 1366 based on the Privilege of Casimir III the Great. The village was founded on the principles of the Magdeburg Rights, and its inhabitants were exempted from all taxes towards the king for a period of twenty years. In 1409, the ownership of Nowotaniec (Lobetanz) was passed over to the knights of Hungary (Petrus Hungarus de Lobetanz) and his brother. The town itself consists of a marketplace and several streets in the valley of the Pielnica river, a tributary of the Wisłok river (ger. Weisslog ) on the right bank, elevation above sea level. The parish belongs to the diocese of Przemyśl, deanery of Sanok, and includes Darow, Nadolany, Nagorzany, Pielnia, Puławy, Wola Jaworowa and Wola Sekowa with a total of 1,960 Roman Catholics and 156 Greek Catholics (in 1887). Not far from Nowotaniec lies the castle of Zboiska, built in 1529 by Odnowski, palatinate of Kraków.\n\nThe village was a center of the Polish Reformed Church and the Stano family were staunch members of it, supporting a Calvinist church in the village from the end of 16th century until 1713 when they sold the property to Roman Catholics and the Calvinist church in the village was suppressed.\n\nIn the first half of the 19th century plagues fell upon the residents of the region. From the time of the Austrian annexation (1772) Nowotaniec became a subdistrict settlement First owner Mathias Bal de Lobetanz (Bals ownership since 1366 - 1556), next owners family de Stano, since 1714 the Bukowskis family. In the 17th century the village was quite important centre of trade and craftsmanship. A good period ended in 1709, when it was looted by the Swedish troops in the Great Northern War. Nowotaniec was owned by the earl Jaworski-Sas since 1767, and currently Krziwkowicz-Pozniak owns to 1944. This part of Poland was controlled by Austria for almost 120 years. At that time the area (including west and east of Subcarpathian Voivodeship) was known as Galicia since 1772. The Roman Catholic Church in Nowotaniec has a collection of records for Nowotaniec and surrounding Roman Catholic villages in its parish like Nadolany and Nagórzany.\n\nThe Roman Catholic Church in Nowotaniec was established in 1409, the parish in 1424.\n\nAt the end of World War II, after the Germans withdrew, the Ukrainian Insurgent Army became active. Its units terrorised Polish population and destroyed military and police posts. Fights ended in 1947 when as the result of Operation Vistula the Ukrainian population was resettled to Western Poland. Between 1945 - 1949 Nowotaniec was the \"gmina\" due to the destruction of Bukowsko by the Ukrainian Insurgent Army.\n\nThe village was burned down April 1946 by the Ukrainian Insurgent Army too.\n\nThe first Jewish families appeared in Nowotaniec at the start of the 18th century. In 1765, 74 Jews lived in the village. They belonged to the Rymanów community (kohal). However, they have gotten independence earlier, before 1777. Then, 10-12 Jewish families were in village. Four houses belonged to they. In 1824, community (kohal) counted 84 persons. In 1870, 249 persons were Jewish inhabitants already. Community owned synagogue and school. 22 pupils walked for school. In 1900, Jewish community counted 287 persons. Did not have community in village Rabbi. Then, 148 Jews lived in city. In 1921, village counted 524 half-breeds, these 42 Jews in Nowotaniec. \n1885 - Yeshi Michal Gilernter, born 1842 was appointed rabbi.\n\nThe isolated rural flat land has no sign or marker. No wall, fence, or gate surrounds. Reached by crossing private property, access is open to all. The unknown present owner uses site for agriculture. Properties adjacent are agricultural. Private visitors rarely visit. No maintenance. Vegetation is a seasonal problem preventing access. Water erosion is a moderate threat.

Larvae have a two-year developmental cycle. Adults feed predominantly on mosquitoes, gnats, and midges; the larvae feed primarily on other aquatic insect larvae and on tadpoles.\n\nThere is a variant form, \"praenubila\" Newman, which has exaggerated wing spots. This is believed to be related to water temperatures during larval development, and appears to be more common in Europe than in the Americas.\n\nThe four-spotted skimmer is the state insect of Alaska.\n\nThis active dragonfly mainly lives by ponds, vernal pools, and slow flowing rivers; they are most common in June and July.\n\nThe brown colour and the four spots on the wings make them unmistakable.\n\nThe male is considered to be highly aggressive and will defend a given territory from incursions from other males of the species. The male is known to form preferences for prominent perches and will often return to the same perches around the margins of pools and ponds whilst it patrols for intruders. Males have a favourable view of the sky during perching. They look toward a section of the sky away from the sun, with less radiation but a higher UV and blue-violet saturation. Thus, the fovea of the eyes, which is sensitive to blue and UV radiation, is optimally suited to the detection of flying insects against the blue sky. Both sexes are prolific fliers, and mating takes place in the air, rather than on perches or amongst the vegetation. The female lays her eggs on floating vegetation. They tend to be easier to approach than Broad-bodied Chasers.\n\nThe larger emperor dragonfly (\"Anax imperator\") is a predator of this species.

{"id": "2226401", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2226401", "title": "Rossendale Valley", "text": "Rossendale Valley\n\nThe Rossendale Valley also known as the Valley of Rossendale, is situated in the Rossendale area of Lancashire, England, between the West Pennine Moors and the main range of the Pennines. The area includes the steep-sided valleys of the River Irwell and its tributaries (between Rawtenstall and Bacup), which flow southwards into Greater Manchester. The rivers cut through the moorland of the Rossendale Hills, generally characterized by open unwooded land, despite the ancient designation of \"forest\". \n\nThe Valley is part of the Rossendale and Darwen constituency. Jake Berry has been the Member of Parliament for Rossendale and Darwen since 2010.\n\nOne of the earliest sites of historical interest in the valley is that of the dykes at Broadclough, which are associated with the Battle of Brunanburh.\n\nIn late Middle Ages, the valley was part of the Royal Forest of Rossendale. The original medieval meaning of 'forest' was similar to a ‘preserve’, for example land that is legally kept for specific purposes such as royal hunting. So ‘forests’ were areas large enough to support species such as wolves and deer for game hunting and they encompassed other habitats such as heaths, open grassland and farmland, so not necessarily extensively wooded. Initial settlement would have been in \"booths\" or farmsteads and encroachment into the forest would have developed them into small hamlets. Rossendale was governed by a constable nominated by principal landowners who held the position of \"The Greave of The Forrest\" which after 1515 became a quasi-hereditary position held by the Whitacker family at the only ancient hall in the district: Broadclough Hall. \n\nIn 1507 the land in the Forest of Rossendale was demised to copyhold farmers and a new church was established on the hillside at Seatnaze around 1511, presumably considered a convenient location for the population at that time.\n\nIn 1789 an act authorised the construction of new Turnpike trust roads through the district, connecting Bury and Haslingden with Blackburn and Whalley, with a junction at Haslingden to Todmorden via Oakenheadwood, Newchurch, Stacksteads and Bacup. In 1826 the Haslingden and Todmorden trust built another new road along the valley bottom, from Stacksteads through Thrutch, Rawtenstall and Newhall Hey. By 1848 a number of Woollen and Cotton Mills had been established along the river. And by the late 19th-century it was the valley bottom that had become the population centre.\n\nIn 1889, the short-lived Rossendale Valley Tramways Company was established to operate a route between Bacup and Crawshawbooth via Rawtenstall. In 1908 the route was taken over by Rawtenstall Corporation Tramways.\n\nThe Forest contains two Marilyns; Hail Storm Hill and Freeholds Top, as well as the summit of Great Hameldon. Geographically, it is sandwiched between the West Pennine Moors to the west and the South Pennines to the east.\n\nThe Irwell Valley in Rossendale is characterised by the steep sided valley of the River Irwell and its tributaries which dissect the moorland of the Rossendale Hills. In the valley bottom, urban settlements grew up at river crossing points between Rawtenstall and Bacup and today form a contiguous urban and industrial development. Textile mills and chimneys and gritstone terraced houses are the dominant buildings and roads are concentrated in the narrow valley. The river has its source on Deerplay Moor in Cliviger near Burnley, heading south to Bacup, where it turns to the west past Stacksteads. The valley narrows at Thrutch, and the Irwell collects Whitewell Brook shortly afterwards at Waterfoot. It flows onward to Rawtenstall where it is met by Limy Water and then turns back to the south. Collecting the River Ogden at Irwell Vale it continues into Greater Manchester.\n\nThe geology of the area is layers of gritstone, coal and glacial deposits of sand and gravel. These rocks were cut by fast flowing rivers, the Irwell and its tributaries, to form steep valleys with sides typically high and a narrow valley floor. Tree cover on the steep slopes includes remnants of ancient woodland but most areas are more recently planted.\n\nMost Rossendalians consider themselves to live in 'The Valley' and this is still locally a commonly used term to describe the district.\n\nRossendale Valley is claimed to be home to fairies, by a Professor at Manchester Metropolitan University, John Hyatt.\n"}
{"id": "2226403", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2226403", "title": "Gendèr", "text": "Gendèr\n\nA gendèr is a type of metallophone used in Balinese and Javanese gamelan music. It consists of 10 to 14 tuned metal bars suspended over a tuned resonator of bamboo or metal, which are tapped with a mallet made of wooden disks (Bali) or a padded wooden disk (Java). Each key is a note of a different pitch, often extending a little more than two octaves. There are five notes per octave, so in the seven-note pélog scale, some pitches are left out according to the pathet. Most gamelans include three gendèr, one for sléndro, one for pelog pathet nem and lima, and one for pelog pathet barang.\n\nThe \"gendèr\" is similar to the Balinese gangsa, which also has an individual resonator under each key, and the saron, which, although trough-resonated, does have a set of tuned metal bars or keys. It is also similar to the Javanese slenthem, which is pitched lower and has fewer notes.\n\nIn some types of gamelan, two gendèrs are used, both spanning approximately two and a half octaves, the gendèr barung and the gendèr panerus, pitched an octave higher than the other. In Gamelan Surakarta, the gendèr panerus plays a single line of melodic pattern, following a pattern similar to the siter. The gendèr barung plays a slower, but more complex melodic pattern that includes more separate right and left hand melodic lines that come together in kempyung (approximately a fifth) and gembyang (octave) intervals. The melodies of the two hands sometimes move in parallel motion, but often play contrapuntally. When playing gendèr barung with two mallets, the technique of dampening, important to most gamelan instruments, becomes more challenging, and the previously hit notes must be dampened by the same hand immediately after the new ones are hit. This is sometimes possible by playing with the mallet at an angle (to dampen one key and play the other), but may require a small pause.\n\nBoth types of gendèr play semi-improvised patterns called cengkok, which generally elaborate upon the seleh. These are relatively fixed patterns, but can be varied in a number of ways to suit the style, pathet, irama, and mood of the piece, as well as the skill of the performer. The cengkok repertoire for gendèr are more developed and specific than those for most other elaborating instruments. Similarly, the gendèr barung is likely to give cues for changing parts or irama, especially in the absence of a rebab, which usually leads the ensemble. It may also play the buka of a piece.\n\n"}

Ultrasonic frequencies (>20 kHz) are usually used, leading to the process also being known as ultrasonication or ultra-sonication.\n\nIn the laboratory, it is usually applied using an \"ultrasonic bath\" or an \"ultrasonic probe\", colloquially known as a \"sonicator\". In a paper machine, an ultrasonic foil can distribute cellulose fibres more uniformly and strengthen the paper.\n\nSonication has numerous effects, both chemical and physical. The chemical effects of ultrasound are concerned with understanding the effect of sonic waves on chemical systems, this is called sonochemistry. The chemical effects of ultrasound do not come from a direct interaction with molecular species. Studies have shown that no direct coupling of the acoustic field with chemical species on a molecular level can account for sonochemistry or sonoluminescence. Instead, in sonochemistry the sound waves migrate through a medium, inducing pressure variations and cavitations that grow and collapse, transforming the sound waves into mechanical energy.\n\nSonication can be used for the production of nanoparticles, such as nanoemulsions, nanocrystals, liposomes and wax emulsions, as well as for wastewater purification, degassing, extraction of seaweed polysaccharides and plant oil, extraction of anthocyanins and antioxidants, production of biofuels, crude oil desulphurization, cell disruption, polymer and epoxy processing, adhesive thinning, and many other processes. It is applied in pharmaceutical, cosmetic, water, food, ink, paint, coating, wood treatment, metalworking, nanocomposite, pesticide, fuel, wood product and many other industries.\n\nSonication can be used to speed dissolution, by breaking intermolecular interactions. It is especially useful when it is not possible to stir the sample, as with NMR tubes. It may also be used to provide the energy for certain chemical reactions to proceed. Sonication can be used to remove dissolved gases from liquids (degassing) by sonicating the liquid while it is under a vacuum. This is an alternative to the freeze-pump-thaw and sparging methods.\n\nIn biological applications, sonication may be sufficient to disrupt or deactivate a biological material. For example, sonication is often used to disrupt cell membranes and release cellular contents. This process is called sonoporation. Small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs) can be made by sonication of a dispersion of large multilamellar vesicles (LMVs). Sonication is also used to fragment molecules of DNA, in which the DNA subjected to brief periods of sonication is sheared into smaller fragments.\n\nSonication is commonly used in nanotechnology for evenly dispersing nanoparticles in liquids. Additionally, it is used to break up aggregates of micron-sized colloidal particles.\n\nSonication can also be used to initiate crystallisation processes and even control polymorphic crystallisations. It is used to intervene in anti-solvent precipitations (crystallisation) to aid mixing and isolate small crystals.\nSonication is the mechanism used in ultrasonic cleaning—loosening particles adhering to surfaces. In addition to laboratory science applications, sonicating baths have applications including cleaning objects such as spectacles and jewelry.\n\nSonication is used in food industry as well. Main applications are for dispersion to save expensive emulgators (mayonnaise) or to speed up filtration processes (vegetable oil etc.). Experiments with sonification for artificial ageing of liquors and other alcoholic beverages were conducted.\n\nSoil samples are often subjected to ultrasound in order to break up soil aggregates; this allows the study of the different constituents of soil aggregates (especially soil organic matter) without subjecting them to harsh chemical treatment.\n\nSonication is also used to extract microfossils from rock.\n\nSubstantial intensity of ultrasound and high ultrasonic vibration amplitudes are required for many processing applications, such as nano-crystallization, nano-emulsification, deagglomeration, extraction, cell disruption, as well as many others. Commonly, a process is first tested on a laboratory scale to prove feasibility and establish some of the required ultrasonic exposure parameters. After this phase is complete, the process is transferred to a pilot (bench) scale for flow-through pre-production optimization and then to an industrial scale for continuous production. During these scale-up steps, it is essential to make sure that all local exposure conditions (ultrasonic amplitude, cavitation intensity, time spent in the active cavitation zone, etc.) stay the same. If this condition is met, the quality of the final product remains at the optimized level, while the productivity is increased by a predictable \"scale-up factor\". The productivity increase results from the fact that laboratory, bench and industrial-scale ultrasonic processor systems incorporate progressively larger ultrasonic horns, able to generate progressively larger high-intensity cavitation zones and, therefore, to process more material per unit of time. This is called \"direct scalability\". It is important to point out that increasing the power capacity of the ultrasonic processor alone does \"not\" result in direct scalability, since it may be (and frequently is) accompanied by a reduction in the ultrasonic amplitude and cavitation intensity. During direct scale-up, all processing conditions must be maintained, while the power rating of the equipment is increased in order to enable the operation of a larger ultrasonic horn.\nFinding the optimum operation condition for this equipment is a challenge for process engineers and needs deep knowledge about side effects of ultrasonic processors.\n\n"}

He announced his retirement after leaving Newcastle United on 16 May 2007. He is currently the owner and CEO of Durham City.\n\nBernard made his name during his first spell with Newcastle United, after joining on a free transfer from Lyon in late-August 2000. He had an evolving career with the Magpies between 2000 and 2005, even though he was at Darlington on loan in the 2000–01 season. He formed a strong left flank partnership with fellow Frenchman Laurent Robert, being a part of Bobby Robson's side, which finished fourth, third and fifth as well as reaching the knockout rounds of the Champions League and the semi-finals of the UEFA Cup. He was a regular starter at the beginning of the 2004–05 season, but Robson was sacked on 28 August 2004 and replaced by Graeme Souness, who made drastic changes at the club, cutting star players like Craig Bellamy and Laurent Robert.\n\nAfter a dispute over contract negotiations, Bernard left Newcastle on 31 January 2005 to join Southampton on a five-month contract.\n\nWhen Southampton were relegated to the Championship in 2005, Bernard's contract expired and was not renewed by the club.\n\nAfter leaving Southampton, Bernard signed a two-year deal with Rangers on 1 September 2005, after turning down potential moves back to the Premier League with Birmingham City and Bolton Wanderers. He cited the prospect of playing in the Champions League once again was a driving force for his move.\n\nAfter just one season with Rangers, and only nine league appearances, he was released after being made surplus to requirements by new manager Paul Le Guen.\n\nNewcastle fans had mixed opinions when Bernard re-signed for them on 1 September 2006 after reneging on an agreement to join Leeds United.\n\nHowever, his second spell on Tyneside did not turn out as well as hoped, with Bernard struggling for fitness and a series of niggling injuries preventing him from making his second debut for Newcastle. The latest injury was reported to be a hip injury. He made numerous reserve team outings, and was an unused substitute in some UEFA Cup fixtures, including away to Palermo and Levadia Tallinn. He never made an appearance for Newcastle during his injury hampered spell.\nAs a result of this, on 16 May 2007 it was announced that, following the appointment of Sam Allardyce as Newcastle boss Bernard, along with Titus Bramble, Oguchi Onyewu, Craig Moore, and Pavel Srníček would not be playing for the side the following season having been released from their contracts.\n\nHe trained with Toronto FC to keep his fitness up in June 2008, mainly because he is friends with former Toronto midfielder Laurent Robert.\n\nBernard retired from football due to a hip injury. In a 2011 interview, he criticised manager Graeme Souness's man management and blamed him for the death of his career. Bernard's injury will require an operation eventually, but he is prolonging it despite the pain. He may never be able to run or have full mobility again- living with a limp for the rest of his life is almost a certainty . He now fights racism in football as a prominent memberShow Racism the Red Card and has recently appeared on Sky Sports News expressing his views on the 'Suarez/Evra dispute' and stating his displeasure at the consequent actions of the Liverpool players.\n\nIn December 2013 it was announced that Bernard had purchased non-league Durham City and become owner and chairman of the club. On buying the club, Bernard stated \"I want to make Durham one of the best feeder clubs in the north east. At the moment, I don't think the area develops enough youngsters. I want to raise the profile of the club and get links with Sunderland, Newcastle and Middlesbrough. Look at the England team, how many of them are from around here?

Brewer, and is a graduate of Swartz Creek High School.\n\nBrewer started his first band, called 'The Red Devils', at the age of 12. After leaving 'The Red Devils', Brewer formed another band named the 'Jazzmasters' for whom he played drums and sang. In 1964, Brewer joined former DJ Terry Knight as well as bassist Herm Jackson, guitarist Curt Johnson, and keyboardist Bobby Caldwell and formed the band Terry Knight and the Pack. In 1966, he experienced his first top 40 hit with \"I (Who Have Nothing)\". In 1967, Brewer met guitarist Mark Farner who joined the band after Johnson left.\n\nIn 1968, Brewer left Terry Knight and the Pack along with bandmate Mark Farner and recruited Mel Schacher, the bassist for the hit band ? and the Mysterians, and formed Grand Funk Railroad. They hired Terry Knight as their manager. In 1973, Grand Funk released the album \"We're an American Band\", featuring the hit song \"We're an American Band\". This track, written and sung by Brewer, was the band's first #1 single. Still popular, the song has since been recorded by other artists. In addition to playing drums for Grand Funk, Brewer also provided lead vocals for a number of songs. This is evidenced by the first and third verses of the song \"Some Kind of Wonderful\" (1974). Brewer was the baritone lead singer for the group, in contrast to the tenor vocals of Mark Farner.\n\nIn 1977, following the initial breakup of Grand Funk, Brewer and former Grand Funk bandmates Mel Schacher and Craig Frost formed a new band named 'Flint'. Flint released one self-titled album in 1978 before disbanding. He also continued in other musical endeavors, including producing for the band The Godz (from Columbus, Ohio) their self-titled debut album \"The Godz\" in 1978.\n\nIn 1981, Brewer and Farner resurrected Grand Funk for the album \"Grand Funk Lives\" that cracked the Billboard albums chart. Two years later, they split again and Brewer joined Bob Seger's Silver Bullet Band. In 1996 Brewer, Schacher, and Farner reunited as Grand Funk, and were eventually named one of Pollstar's top-grossing acts of 1998. Farner decided to leave the band at the end of 1998 to resume his solo career. In 2000, Brewer and Schacher added vocalist Max Carl, former Kiss guitarist Bruce Kulick and keyboardist Tim Cashion to the line-up. This band has been touring the U.S. and Canada playing about 40 shows per year. \nBrewer played the bongo on Frank Zappa's song \"Let Me Take You to the Beach\" from the album \"Studio Tan\", released in 1978.\nBrewer was featured in \"Classic Rock Drum Solos\" DVD (2007), performing a solo from when he and Grand Funk Railroad sold out Shea Stadium in 1971. In 2000, Don performed as a guest clinician at \"Modern Drummer\" Magazine's annual Drum Festival event, where he was honored as one of the most influential drummers in the history of rock. In 2006 Brewer rejoined Bob Seger & The Silver Bullet Band for their 2006–07 tour; it was his first appearance with the band since he played for them on their 1983 tour. He also played with them on Seger's 2011 tour. He also played drums during Bob Seger's 2014-2015 \"Ride Out\" concert tour throughout the United States.\n\nBrewer lives in Jupiter, Florida, with his wife Sunny Quinn, together since 1985.

Kenkō, being a Buddhist monk, writes about Buddhist truths, and themes such as death and impermanence prevail in the work, although it also contains passages devoted to the beauty of nature as well as some accounts of humorous incidents. The original work was not divided or numbered; the division can be traced to the 17th century.\n\nThe work takes its title from its prefatory passage:つれづれなるまゝに日暮らし硯にむかひて心にうつりゆくよしなし事をそこはかとなく書きつくればあやしうこそものぐるほしけれ\n\"Tsurezurenaru mama ni, hikurashi, suzuri ni mukaite, kokoro ni utsuriyuku yoshinashigoto wo, sokowakatonaku kakitsukureba, ayashū koso monoguruoshikere.\"\n\nIn Keene's translation:What a strange, demented feeling it gives me when I realise I have spent whole days before this inkstone, with nothing better to do, jotting down at random whatever nonsensical thoughts that have entered my head.\n\nHere つれづれ (\"tsurezure\") means “having nothing to do.”\n\nFor comparison, Sansom's translation:To while away the idle hours, seated the livelong day before the inkslab, by jotting down without order or purpose whatever trifling thoughts pass through my mind, truly this is a queer and crazy thing to do!\n\nDespite the distinguished work of Kenko being continually held in high regard among many and considered a classic since the 17th century, the origin to the publication of Kenko's work is unclear. Many people have speculated different theories to the arrival of his work, however, little is known to the exact manner of how the book itself was compiled and put together. One of the most popular beliefs held among the majority was concluded by Sanjonishi Saneeda (1511-1579), who stated that Kenko himself did not edit the 243 chapters of his work, but rather, simply wrote his thoughts on random scrap pieces of paper which he pasted to the walls of his cottage. It was then hypothesized that Kenko's friend, Imagawa Ryoshun, who was also a poet and general at that time, was the one who compiled the book together. After finding the notes on Kenko's wall, he had prudently removed the scraps and combined the pieces together with other essays of Kenko's which were found in possession by Kenko's former servant, and carefully arranged the notes into the order it is found in today.\n\nModern critics today have rejected this account, skeptical of the possibility that any other individual aside from Kenko himself could have put together such an insightful piece of work. However, the oldest surviving texts of Tsurezuregusa have been found in the hands of Ryoshun's disciple, Shotetsu, making Sanjonishi's theory to become widely considered by people today.\n\nThroughout Tsurezuregusa, a consistent theme regarding the impermanence of life is noted in general as a significant principle in Kenko's work. Tsurezuregusa overall comprises this concept, making it a highly relatable work to many as it touches on the secular side among the overtly Buddhist beliefs mentioned in some chapters of the work.\n\nKenko relates the impermanence of life to the beauty of nature in an insightful manner. Kenko sees the aesthetics of beauty in a different light: the beauty of nature lies in its impermanence. Within his work, Kenko quotes the poet Ton’a:\n“It is only after the silk wrapper has frayed at top and bottom, and the mother-of-pearl has fallen from the roller, that a scroll looks beautiful.”\n\nIn agreement with this statement, Kenko shows his support for an appreciation for the uncertain nature of things, and proposes the idea of how nothing last forever is a motivation for us to appreciate everything we have. Kenko himself states this in a similar manner in his work:\n\n“If man were never to fade away like the dews of Adashino, never to vanish like the smoke over Toribeyama, but lingered on forever in this world, how things would lose their power to move us! The most precious thing in life is its uncertainty.”\n\nKenko clearly states his point of view regarding the nature of things in life, and regards the perishability of objects to be moving. In relation to the concept of impermanence, his works links to the fondness of the irregular and incomplete, and the beginnings and ends of things. Kenko states:\n\n“It is typical of the unintelligent man to insist on assembling complete sets of everything. Imperfect sets are better.”\n\n“Branches about to blossom or gardens strewn with faded flowers are worthier of our admiration. In all things, it is the beginnings and ends that are interesting.”\nWithin his work, Kenko shows the relation of impermanence to the balance of things in life. Beginnings and ends relate to the impermanence of things, and it is because of its impermanence that beginnings and ends are interesting and should be valued. Irregularity and incompleteness of collections and works show the potential for growth and improvement, and the impermanence of its state provides a moving framework towards appreciation towards life.\n\nKenko's work predominantly reveals these themes, providing his thoughts set out in short essays of work. Although his concept of impermanence is based upon his personal beliefs, these themes provide a basic concept relatable among many, making it an important classical literature resonating throughout Japanese high school curriculum today.\n\nThe definitive English translation is by Donald Keene (1967). In his preface Keene states that, of the six or so earlier translations into English and German, that by G. B. Sansom is the most distinguished. It was published by the Asiatic Society of Japan in 1911 as \"The Tsuredzure Gusa of Yoshida No Kaneyoshi: Being the Meditations of a Recluse in the 14th Century\".\n\n\n\n"}

It has an important port, situated along the route connecting Suez to Gibraltar, one of the busiest maritime corridors in the world.\n\nGioia Tauro has been continuously inhabited for more than 2500 years. From about 400 BC or so it was inhabited by Greek colonists who called it Matauros or Metauros (). Solinus write that it was established by Greeks from the Zancle. \nIt was one of the smaller ancient Greek centers among the settlements in Southern Italy (Magna Graecia). The ancient poet Stesichorus is said to have been born there. The remains are a little further inland in the old town of Gioia Tauro on a rise overlooking the Tyrrhenian Sea.\n\nIn the 1970s, Gioia Tauro was the main centre for industrial development in Southern Italy, following a burst of violence in Reggio Calabria in 1970, signaling frustration over the central government's neglect of the region. The construction of a large steel plant and port facility was meant to bring income and jobs to Calabria. Until then Gioia Tauro had been a productive and beautiful agricultural area. Profitable farms and olive groves were expropriated and demolished.\n\nThe 'Ndrangheta, a Mafia-type criminal organisation based in Calabria, and in particular the Piromalli clan, exploited the construction of the steelworks until the project was abandoned in 1979, when the crisis in the steel industry could no longer be ignored and the government decided there was no economic basis for it. In the meantime some 1,000 people were killed in conflicts over construction contracts. For a while the homicide rate of Gioia Tauro, was higher than that of New York City.\n\nFollowing this, a proposed electrical energy power station was never built, due to environmental problems. Gioia Tauro became an example of the failure that characterized much of the development of Italy's South as \"industrialisation without development.\"\n\nThe seaport has seven loading docks with an extension of ; it is the largest in Italy and the seventh-largest container port in Europe, with a 2007 throughput of s from more than 3,000 ships. In 2018 the port was in eighth place for EU container traffic, on a higher throughput of \n\nIn 2002 more than one-third of national traffic went through the seaport; it specializes in transshipment activities, replacing the port of Malta as the node for overseas traffic to and from the US and the Far East.\nThe Medcenter Container Terminal (Medcenter, Contship) is the main operator working in the port.\n\nAccording to a 2006 report, Italian investigators estimate that 80% of Europe's cocaine arrives from Colombia via Gioia Tauro's docks. The port is also involved in the illegal arms trade. These activities are controlled by the 'Ndrangheta. In 2014 the US FBI and the Italian police made arrests in a joint operation aimed at smashing a new trafficking route for drugs and weapons that officials said had brought together the Gambino crime family of New York and the 'Ndrangheta. It was alleged that representatives of the criminal organisations discussed plans to ship cocaine and heroin from Gioia Tauro to the United States, selling more than of heroin to an FBI undercover agent, thinking it would be distributed across the United States. A mafia expert said that the US mafia understood that the Sicilian Cosa Nostra had been so weakened that it allowed the 'Ndrangheta to rise.\n\n“In the 1970s, the Christian Democratic Italian Government (with the active encouragement of the left) appropriated (and wasted) tens of billions of dollars to build one of the country’s largest steel plants in Calabria, but the project was abandoned because of a crisis in the steel industry...\n“The government ultimately completed construction of a huge seaport at Gioia Tauro (the sixth largest in the Mediterranean) which was originally meant to service the steel plant...[Alex] Perry [in his book, “The Good Mothers: The True Story of the Women Who Took on the World’s Most Powerful Mafia,” William Morrow publishers, 2018] notes that ‘the railway that connected Gioia Tauro to Europe stopped 1.5 kilometers short of the port, meaning all the cargo’ — legal and illegal — ‘from one of the biggest Mediterranean container ports had to be loaded onto mafia-owned trucks and driven three minutes to the station.’ The port’s legitimate business has struggled in recent years, no doubt a result of Mafia control.”\n“Breaking the Silence in Calabria,” Alexander Stille, The New York Review of Books, Vol. LXVI, No. 16 (October 24, 2019)\n\nThe Piromalli-Molè clan managed to condition the management of the new container terminal. Established in the mid-1990s, it became the largest terminal in the Mediterranean, moving over 2 million containers in 1998. Since 1994, when Contship Italia rented the port area to start transshipment activity and the Medcenter Container Terminal was set up thanks to 138 billion lire (about US$86 million) in state financing, the Piromallis aimed to oblige the Medcenter company, through its vice president Walter Lugli, and the Contship company, through its president Enrico Ravano, to pay a kickback of US$1.50 for each transshipped container, about half of the net profits earned by the two companies.\n\nIn February 2008 the parliamentary Antimafia Commission concluded that the 'Ndrangheta \"controls or influences a large part of the economic activity around the port and uses the facility as a base for illegal trafficking.\" In its report it said that \"the entire gamma of internal or sub-contracted activities is mafia-influenced, from the management of distribution and forwarding to customs control and container storage.\" The extortion of Ravano and Contship was part of a project that \"did not involve simply this security tax, which grew with the port, but also control of activities tied to the port, the hiring of workers, and relations with port unions and local institutions\". \"It effectively eliminated legitimate competition from companies not influenced or controlled by the mafia in providing goods and services, performing construction work and hiring personnel. And it threw a shadow over the behaviour of local government and other public bodies.\"\n\nThe city council of Gioia Tauro was dissolved in 1991 because of infiltration by the 'Ndrangheta. In April 2008, it was dissolved for the second time for the same reason. The town is home to several 'ndrine, such as the Alvaro, Mammoliti, Molè, and Piromalli families.\n\nGioia Tauro's former mayor and deputy mayor, Giorgio Dal Torrione and Rosario Schiavone, were arrested on mafia charges on October 13, 2008. Both had been forced to step down in April, when the city council was dissolved on suspicion of mafia infiltration. 'Ndrangheta boss Gioacchino Piromalli was arrested as well, along with his nephew, also named Gioacchino Piromalli, who is a lawyer. The mayors were accused of employing the younger Piromalli. Police believe the legal work was a front to enable the Piromallis to regain a slice of the business generated by the port of Gioia Tauro.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The division was composed primarily of Hungarian Army \"Volksdeutsche\" conscripts who were transferred to the Waffen-SS following an agreement between Germany and Hungary. The division is commonly known under the \"Maria Theresia\" name in publications, although no documents have been found to confirm this name.\n\nIn December 1943, the 17th SS-Cavalry Regiment from the 8th SS Cavalry Division Florian Geyer was ordered to become the cadre for a new SS cavalry division. On 29 April 1944, the \"SS-Führungshauptamt\" authorised the division to be raised on basis of the 17th SS-Cavalry Regiment. The unit was sent to Kisbér in Hungary to begin forming the new division. While personnel from the \"Florian Geyer\" formed the nucleus of the division, the bulk of the troops were Hungarian \"Volksdeutsche\" (ethnic German) conscripts, transferred to the Waffen-SS following an agreement between Germany and Hungary.\n\nThe division was designated the 22nd SS Volunteer Cavalry Division Maria Theresia. The title referred to Maria Theresa, who had ruled Austria, Hungary and Bohemia in the 18th century. The symbol of the division, a cornflower, was emblazoned on the divisional shield. However, some authors claim that the division was always referred-to in official documents as the 22nd SS Volunteer Cavalry Division, and there are no records that would officially confirm it being named \"Maria Theresia\".\n\nOver the next months, the division continued its organization and training in Kisber, Győr and Budapest, equipped with mostly Hungarian weapons, vehicles and equipment. By June 1944, the divisional strength reached 4,900. In early August \"Oberkommando des Heeres\" (OKH) ordered all divisions forming up in Hungary to send units to the combat zone. The 52nd SS Volunteer Cavalry Regiment entrained for the front in Romania, while the 17th SS Volunteer Cavalry Regiment remained in Hungary to train the rest of the division.\n\n\"Kampfgruppe Wiedemann\" consisted of \"SS Volunteer Cavalry Regiment 52\" with attached artillery, Flak and reconnaissance elements. The \"Kampfgruppe\" was transported from Gyula-Szalonta, Hungary to Arad, Romania, where it was attached to \"General der Panzertruppe\" Hermann Breith's III Panzer Corps, stationed in the area around Debrecen. Elements of the division went into the line on 30 September, forming a defensive ring around the city of Arad along with the Hungarian 9th Infantry Division.\n\nOn 2 October, the Soviet spearheads of Marshal Rodion Malinovsky's 2nd Ukrainian Front began probing towards Arad. On 6 October, Malinovsky launched a major offensive, thus beginning the Battle of Debrecen. Units of the division were quickly outflanked and encircled. The second echelon of Soviet forces sought to destroy the pocket; on 8 October it was split in two. One unit broke out however, with troops swimming across the Harmas river to German lines on the other side. On 30 October the remaining 48 survivors, after a 200-mile trek across enemy territory, linked up with German forces at the town of Dunaföldvár, south of Budapest.\n\nIn mid-October 1944, pro-German Honvédség officers had revealed that the Hungarian Regent, Admiral Miklós Horthy, was negotiating a secret surrender to the Soviets. Hitler sent \"SS-Obersturmbannfüher\" Otto Skorzeny to deal with the problem. Skorzeny commandeered all available elements of the \"Maria Theresia\" to take part in Operation Panzerfaust, which began at 0600 on 15 October. In little over half an hour, a German column led by four Tiger IIs, including a number of \"Maria Theresia\" men, stormed Buda Castle and forced Horthy to abdicate. Simultaneously, Operation \"Panzerfaust\" resulted in the forced detainment of Horthy's youngest son, the pro-peace Nicholas Horthy. Pro-German Arrow Cross leader Ferenc Szálasi replaced Horthy, negotiations were broken off and Hungary remained in the war.\n\nThe battle-ready units of the division were assigned to the IX SS Mountain Corps, which was deployed in Budapest. The division arrived in early November 1944 and took up defensive positions. There it was encircled along with the rest of the Axis troops in the Hungarian capital and destroyed. Only some 170 men got out of the encirclement.\n\nThe survivors, along with those who had not been sent to Budapest, were used to form the 37th SS Volunteer Cavalry Division \"Lützow\", with the remnants of the Flak units being transferred to 32nd SS Volunteer Panzergrenadier Division \"30 Januar\".\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2226500", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2226500", "title": "Chiwara", "text": "Chiwara\n\nA Chiwara (also Chi wara, Ci Wara, or Tyi Wara; ; ) is a ritual object representing an antelope, used by the Bambara ethnic group in Mali. The Chiwara initiation society uses Chiwara masks, as well as dances and rituals associated primarily with agriculture, to teach young Bamana men social values as well as agricultural techniques.\n\nChiwara masks are categorized in three ways: horizontal, vertical, or abstract. In addition, Chiwara can be either male or female. Female Chiwara masks are denoted by the presence of a baby antelope and straight horns. Male Chiwara masks have bent horns and a phallus. The sex of a Chiwara mask is much clearer on horizontal and vertical masks while abstract masks tend to be difficult to classify.\n\nThe appearance of the Chiwara form varies greatly both by region and time produced. Specific master wood carvers also subtly modified the accepted (or even religiously mandated) local forms, forming a distinct \"signature\" or \"school\" of Chiwara figures. These regional variations have been roughly assigned the stylistic categories above. Thus \"the Bougouni / Southern region style\" are an amalgam of several animal motifs combined in the same work, in an abstract style; \"the Bamako / Northern region style\" is usually of the horizontal style; \"the Segu/ Northern region style\" (the heartland of the Bambara Empire) matches the vertical style with the unique \"cut out\" triangular body motif of the males. Other regional styles have been proposed, including \"the Sikasso region style\", with a thin, delicate, vertical form within almost human, snoutless face.\n\nIn Bambara, \"chi\" \"wara\" means \"laboring\" \"wild animal\", and is a representation of Bambara mythos about the creation of farming.\n\nWhile there are several versions of the story, the discovery of agriculture is credited to the hero Chi Wara, a half antelope, half human figure born from the union of the sky goddess Mousso Koroni and an earth spirit in the shape of a cobra. The Chi Wara came to earth to teach humans to sow crops, and thus is honored at both sowing and harvest festivals.\n\nThe Chi Wara itself is usually represented as a Roan Antelope with an almost human face, but also takes shapes of other creatures and emblems of farming. The hero descends from the sky goddess, and thus represents the sun, its body is often elongated and short legged to represent the aardvark who burrows into the earth like a farmer. Its high horns echo the stalks of millet, and it stands on a dancer clad in a mass of raffia stalks to represent both flowing water and a bountiful harvest. The zig-zag patterns echo the movement of the sun across the sky, and the penis of the male figure stands low to the ground, fertilizing the earth.\nThe Chi Wara figures always appear as a male/female pair, combining the elements of fertility of humans with fertility of the earth. The female figure usually carries a young antelope on her back, and is said to represent human beings carried by the Chi Wara hero, as well as a newborn human carried on a mother's back.\n\nAs farmers of the upper Niger river savanna, the blessing of agriculture is of central importance to Bambara society. These traditions survive in part because the Bambara were one of the last cultures in the area to embrace Islam, after the fall of the Bambara Empire in the late 19th century. Bambara culture has traditionally had a strict set of age and caste fraternities (\"ton\"/\"jo\"/\"jow\"), and the \"chi wara ton\" society is one of the more important. It gathers all young adult males of the \"Soli\" age group to work the fields at clearing, sowing and harvest, when the greatest number of laborers is needed. Secret teachings of the \"chi wara ton\" pass the needed skills for this work, upon which the very survival of the community depends.\n\nThe \"chi wara ton\" is also the only major Bambara society which includes both sexes. Women's labor is needed for agriculture, just as both sexes are needed for human reproduction.\n\nThe Chi Wara is always danced with each wooden figure attached to a basket on the dancer's head, and the body covered in a huge pile of raffia. Often the face is obscured with raffia that has been colored or decorated, and the dancer carries a long staff. The figures are always in one or more male/female pairs, with the female usually dancing behind the male, fanning him and spreading his powers into the gathered community. The Male figures leap to represent the antelope, and then scratch the earth with their staves or horns as the Chi Wara teaches humans to cultivate crops. In some communities the Mousso Koroni figure also appears. Initiated children wear a \"Sogono Kuni\" (\"Little antelope head\"), which is quite rare to find in museums. \n\nAfrican sculptural forms became fashionable amongst European artists and collectors at the beginning of the Twentieth century, and the Chiwara, especially in its more abstract forms, became one of the icons of what Europeans called \"Primitive Art\". The artist Guillaume Apollinaire and collector Paul Guillaume published images of the Chiwara in their \"Sculptures nègres\" in 1917, while Picasso, Braque, and Les Fauves became fascinated with African sculpture and masks in general, and the Chiwara figure in particular.\n\nA vertical, male, semi-abstracted Chiwara figure was included in the 1935 Metropolitan Museum of Art exhibit \"African Negro Art\", and the \"Masterpieces of African Art\" at the Brooklyn Museum in 1954, (as well as shows in London and Paris) shows which were highly influential to western artists and collectors. Variations of its triangular cut-out pattern are echoed in mid-20th century Modernist art, and its outline remains one of the most recognizable of African art forms.\n\n\n\n"}

Alongside the Bren, Scout and Machine Gun Carriers, they also moved infantry support weapons.\n\nThe Loyd Carrier was built upon the mechanicals (engine, gearbox and transmission) of a 15 cwt 4x2 Fordson 7V truck with mild steel bodywork to which armour plate (referred to as 'BP Plate' in Loyd manuals) was bolted (to the front and upper sides) depending on application. The engine was at the rear of the Carrier with the radiator behind rather than in front. The transmission then took the drive forward to the axle at the very front where it drove the tracks. Both the front drive sprockets and idlers (which were also sprocketed) at the rear of the tracks were fitted with brakes, actuated by a pair of levers by the driver. To turn the vehicle to the left, the brakes were applied on that side and the Carrier would slew round the stopped track.\n\nThe upper hull covered the front and sides but was open to the rear and above; as the Carrier was not expected to function as a fighting vehicle, this was not an issue. To protect the occupants from the weather, a canvas tilt could be put up; this was standard fitment from the factory.\nAs part of the rapid development program, the Loyd used parts from other vehicles: From the Universal Carrier, the track, drive sprockets, and Horstmann suspension units; from the Fordson 7V, the chassis, engine, gearbox, torque tube and front axle. The brake drums and back plates were designed specifically for the Loyd.\n\nThe Army tested the Loyd Carrier in 1939 and placed an initial order for 200 as the \"Carrier, Tracked, Personnel Carrying\" i.e. a personnel carrier. Initial deliveries were from Vivian Loyd's own company, but production moved to the larger firms, including the Ford Motor Company and Wolseley Motors (13,000 between them) and Dennis Brothers Ltd, Aveling & Barford and Sentinel Waggon Works. Total production of the Loyd Carrier was approximately 26,000.\n\nEarly in the war, the TT along with the TPC variants were part of the standard equipment of Royal Engineer Chemical Warfare Companies. Most of the Chemical Warfare Companies were disbanded or repurposed in 1943 in order to free up their 4.2 inch mortars for desperately needed conventional use by infantry divisions in-theatre; the mortars and supporting equipment were attached to each division's machine-gun battalion in company strength.\n\nBy far the most notable use of the Loyd was in the TT (Tracked Towing) configuration, where it pulled the 6 pounder anti-tank gun from the Normandy landings of 1944 through to the end of the war. There are many wartime photographs of Loyds in action in Normandy, and a number were photographed destroyed in the well-known battle of Villers-Bocage in 1944.\n\nThe Loyd Carrier was also paired with Caterpillar D8 tractors in service with Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers for tank recovery - the Carrier carrying spare equipment for the tractor.\n\nBoth Belgium and the Netherlands bought Loyd TTs from the British Army; they were still in Belgian Army ownership up to at least 1963 as engine rebuild plates have been seen with this date in original Belgian vehicles.\n\nA Belgian variant was the CATI 90 (\"Canon antitank d'infanterie automoteur 90mm\"), a self-propelled gun in use from 1954 to 1962. The vehicle served in infantry units with a paired ammunition carrier.\n\nSome vehicles were sold on into private ownership for farming use (a 1941 No1Mk1 TPC with a ploughing conversion still exists in Nottinghamshire, UK) and a number were placed as targets on Belgian ranges.\n\nLoyd carriers were available in three \"numbers\", which were available in two \"marks\"; all manufactured during wartime, and varied in the type/sourcing of the flathead Ford V8 they were powered with:\n\nThe two marks were:\n\nThere were not many differences between variants, mainly seating and armour plate location:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The building was built in the Art Deco style of the late 1920s by George Conrad Reifel and designed by architect H.H. Gillingham. Best known for showcasing special performances, the venue is also famous for its \"sprung dance floor\", whose horsehair lining absorbs, rather than reflecting back, some of the impact of dancers' feet. At the time it was installed, only a few venues in the world had similar floors.\n\nThe general-admission ballroom accommodates approximately 990 guests (including standing room and table seating).\n\nThe building's street level was built for retail outlets, some of them in their time also notable. Downstairs, below street level, is the Commodore Lanes, a vintage bowling alley and poolroom.\n\nThe building opened in December 1929 as the Commodore Cabaret. With the onset of the Great Depression, the venue briefly closed four months later. It reopened in November 1930, and has since operated under several different owners as one of Vancouver's premier entertainment venues.\n\nFrom 1936 to 1939, shows by bandleader Charlie Pawlett (d. 1981), originally of Nanaimo and a trumpet and violin player, were broadcast on CJOR radio.\n\nSammy Davis Jr. played The Commodore in 1948, and was interviewed there by CKMO radio host Wilf Ray. Other notable acts in following decades included Duke Ellington and Tommy Dorsey.\n\nIn 1969, management of The Commodore was taken over by Drew Burns, launching an era which saw the ballroom transformed into a major rock'n'roll venue.\n\nThe Commodore closed in 1996, but after $3.5 million in renovations (including a new hardwood dance floor) it reopened under the House of Blues banner on November 12, 1999. House of Blues hosted a 75th Anniversary celebration season from December 2003, 2004 to December 4, 2005, though began celebrations early on October 16, 2004 with a performance by Tom Waits.\n\nOver the years the venue has hosted notable Grammy Award or Juno Award winning performers such as The Tragically Hip, James Brown, U2, Coldplay, Radiohead, Sting, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Weezer, The Police, Pearl Jam, KISS, Tina Turner, The Beastie Boys, Nirvana, Kid Rock, Hedley, Oasis, Dr. Dre, Katy Perry, Lady Gaga and Metric.\n\nFor many years, the venue was also noted for an annual St. Patrick's Day concert by the influential local Celtic rock band Spirit of the West. When the band announced its retirement due to lead singer John Mann's declining health, the venue also hosted the band's final concerts in April 2016.\n"}

The winner was Joel Sherman of the United States.\n\nThe World Scrabble Championship 1997 was held in the Stouffer Renaissance Mayflower Hotel, Washington, D.C., and was the second to be held in the United States. Eighty players played a Swiss tournament of twenty-one games each, with each player playing seven games on each of the first three days. The two top players from this tournament then played a best-of-five game final to decide who would be World Scrabble Champion 1997.\n\nPrize money was provided by the Milton Bradley Company, owned by the tournament's sponsor Hasbro, to a total value of $50,100. The winner received $25,000, the runner-up $10,000 and the remainder of the top twenty players received prizes down to $150.\n\nThis was the first World Championship to have featured a\nlive web site,\na copy of which is now archived at the main WSC web site.\n\nAfter the initial Swiss tournament, the top two players were Joel Sherman (16 wins, winning spread +829) and Matt Graham (15 wins, winning spread +993).

Originally known for its Fibre Channel storage networks, the company expanded include a wide range of products marketed as third platform technologies. Offerings included routers and network switches for data center, campus and carrier environments, IP and Fibre Channel storage network fabrics; Network Functions Virtualization (NFV) and software-defined networking (SDN) markets such as a commercial edition of the OpenDaylight Project controller; and network management software that spans physical and virtual devices.\n\nOn November 2, 2016, Singapore-based chip maker Broadcom Limited announced it was buying Brocade for about $5.5 billion. Broadcom has since redomesticated to the United States and is now known as Broadcom Inc.\n\nBrocade was founded in August 1995, by Seth Neiman (a venture capitalist, a former executive from Sun Microsystems and a professional auto racer), Kumar Malavalli (a co-author of the Fibre Channel specification) and Paul R. Bonderson (a former executive from Intel Corporation and Sun). Neiman became the first CEO of the company. Brocade was incorporated on May 14, 1998, in Delaware.\n\nThe company's first product, SilkWorm, which was a Fibre Channel switch, was released in early 1997.\n\nOn May 25, 1999, the company went public at a split-adjusted price of $4.75. On initial public offering (IPO), the company offered 3,250,000 shares, with an additional 487,500 shares offered to the underwriters to cover over-allotments. The top three underwriters (based on number of shares) for Brocade's IPO were, in order, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, BT Alex.Brown, and Dain Rauscher Wessels.\nBrocade stock traded in the National Market System of the NASDAQ GS stock market under the ticker symbol BRCD.\nA second generation of switches was announced in 1999.\n\nOn January 14, 2013, Brocade named Lloyd Carney as new chief executive.\nOn November 2, 2016, Singapore-based chip maker Broadcom Limited announced they were buying Brocade for $5.5 billion. As part of the announcement, Broadcom said they would sell Brocade's networking business to avoid competing with its top customers such as Cisco Systems.\n\nOn August 8, 2017, Brocade announced that its SDN technology had been spun off as a new company called Lumina Networks. This follows the sales of other divisions designed to allow the Broadcom acquisition to proceed, including Ruckus Wireless, Connectem (vEPC), Virtual ADC, Vyatta & vRouter, and Brocade's data center networking business.\n\nBroadcom announced the acquisition of Brocade in Nov 2016, and it completed the acquisition in Nov 2017 for $5.5 billion.\n\nBrocade hardware products include Fibre Channel storage area network (SAN) directors and switches; ultra-low-latency data center switches; Ethernet fabrics, Federal and enterprise Ethernet (LAN/WLAN) switches; WAN (Internet) routers; application delivery controllers (load balancers); Fibre Channel fabric extension switches; embedded Fibre Channel and Ethernet switch blades; Fibre Channel host bus adapters (HBAs); converged Fibre Channel/Ethernet network adapters (CNAs), and Ethernet transceivers. Other hardware solutions from Brocade support common protocols including iSCSI, FCIP, GigE, FICON, FCoE, DCB/CEE, and Layer 4-7 networking protocols.\n\nBrocade also sells software-based networking devices including technology for SDN, Network virtualization, virtual routers, virtual firewalls, virtual Application Delivery Controllers (load balancers), network security appliances and VPNs through its wholly owned subsidiary, Vyatta.\n\nBrocade's first Fibre Channel switch SilkWorm 1000 (SW1000) (released in 1997) was based on the \"Stitch\" ASIC and their own VxWorks-based firmware (Fabric OS or FOS). SilkWorm eventually came to be a long-lived marketing designation for an entire line of products, with the first product being retro-named the SilkWorm 1000 (SW1000) to distinguish it from subsequent platforms. Bruce Bergman was the CEO during most of this period. Product names were generally puns on various kinds of woven fabric, since a switched Fibre Channel network is also called a \"fabric\".\n\nIn 1998, Gregory Reyes joined the company as CEO. In 2001, Brocade released the SilkWorm 6400, which was designated a \"director\" similarly to IBM ESCON directors already well-established in the mainframe computer market. The term \"director\" became universally used for more expensive FC switches.\n\nFrom 2001 to 2003, Brocade released switches based on its third generation ASIC, \"BLOOM\" (Big LOOM). BLOOM introduced increased throughput of 2 Gbit/s instead of 1 Gbit/s. Brocade integrated BLOOM into its first \"pure\" director, the SilkWorm 12000, in April 2002. The director offered up to 128 ports in two 64-port pseudo-switches (\"domains\"). The 12000 represented several internal architecture and technical changes besides the new ASIC: it had an upgraded control processor architecture (Intel i960 moved to PowerPC 405GP), changed the embedded operating system (FOS v4.0 migrated from Wind River Systems VxWorks to MontaVista Linux), and introduced the backplane architecture (hierarchical PCI buses with replaceable blades attached to a backplane). The Bloom ASIC also introduced a notable capability of frame-level Fibre Channel trunking, which provided high throughput with load balancing across multiple cables. It needed to be implemented in the ASIC hardware to ensure in-order delivery of frames. Also hot firmware upgrade was introduced with FOS v4.1 in October 2003.\n\nAt the time, Brocade's main rival, McDATA, held over 90% market share in director segment, owing to a strong position first in the ESCON market, and then in the FICON market. The SilkWorm 12000 director gained over one-third of the market share after its release in 2002. Brocade added mainframe customers with FICON and FICON CUP support on the SilkWorm 12000.\nIn 2003, the SilkWorm 12000 was named “Storage Product of the Year” by \"Computing\".\n\nIn 2004, the BLOOM II improved on the previous ASIC design by reducing its power consumption and die size, while maintaining 2 Gbit/s technology. It powered Brocade's second generation director, the SilkWorm 24000. Still a 128 port design, it was the first one which could operate as a single 128-port switch (a single domain). The new director also used approximately two thirds less power than its predecessor. Brocade introduced also its first multiprotocol Fibre Channel router, the SilkWorm 7420. Brocade also acquired Rhapsody Networks (a SAN virtualization startup company). This was also the time frame in which Brocade first entered into the embedded switch market, delivering multiple switches physically integrated into other vendors' hardware, such as storage controllers and blade server chassis.\n\nAs of March 2009, Brocade had sold over 10 million SAN switch ports with over 44,000 directors installed, and held 75.5% of the overall SAN switch market (Dell'Oro Group, 1Q09 SAN Report).\n\nIn late 2010 Brocade introduced Virtual Cluster Switching (VCS) on the VDX ultra-low-latency data center switch product line. These are DCB/CEE- and TRILL-based switches, eliminating the need for Spanning Tree Protocol, and supporting multi-hop Fibre Channel over Ethernet (FCoE) and self-trunking.\n\nIn May 2011, Brocade launched the industry's first \"Gen 5 Fibre Channel\" (16 Gbit/s) SAN platform family including the Brocade DCX 8510 Backbone, 6510 switch and 1860 Fabric Adapter. The Brocade DCX 8510 is available in 8-slot or 4-slot chassis models supporting up to 384 16 Gbit/s ports at line-rate speeds and 8.2 terabits per second (Tbit/s) of chassis bandwidth. It includes optical UltraScale inter-chassis links (ICLs) which simplify scale-out design for multi-chassis architectures. The Brocade 6510 switch is a 48-port 16 Gbit/s switch designed for virtualized applications and high-performance storage including SSD arrays. Brocade also introduced the 1860 Fabric Adapter, the industry's first adapter which includes AnyIO 16 Gbit/s FC HBA, 10GbE CNA, and 10GbE NIC functionality on the same card.\n\nIn April 2012, Brocade launched the 6505 switch (24-port) entry-level switch.\n\nIn March 2013, Brocade launched the 6520 96-port Gen 5 Fibre Channel high-density switch and announced Brocade Fabric Vision technology. Brocade Fabric Vision technology introduces advanced diagnostics, monitoring, and management capabilities through a combination of ASIC, FOS, and Brocade Network Advisor. New features include Brocade Monitoring and Alerting Policy Suite (MAPS) for fabric-wide threshold configuration and monitoring and Brocade Flow Vision for data flow monitoring and analysis.\n\nIn March 2016, Brocade launched the G620 switch, their first Gen 6 (32 Gbit/s) Fibre Channel product.\n\nBrocade designs its Fibre Channel ASICs for performing switching functions in its SAN switches.\n\nThe first family of SAN switches, the SilkWorm 1000, released in 1997, were based on the first generation of Brocade ASICs, called Stitch. The SilkWorm 6400 series of SAN Director class switches and SilkWorm 2400/2800 switches, released in 1999, were based on the second generation of Brocade ASICs, called LOOM. The SilkWorm 12000/24000 SAN Directors and SilkWorm 3200/3800/3850 SAN switches, released in 2001, were based on the third and fourth generation of Brocade ASICs called BLOOM and BLOOM-II.\n\nThe fifth generation of ASICs, called Condor and Goldeneye (scaled-down Condor), powered the SilkWorm 48000 series of Directors and port blades, FR4-18i Extension Blade, and SilkWorm 200E/4100/4900/7500 series of switches respectively. These products were released into the market in 2004.\n\nThe sixth generation of Brocade ASICs (designed in 2008) are called Condor 2 and Goldeneye 2. Condor 2 supports 40 ports of 8 Gbit/s per ASIC and Goldeneye 2 supports 32 ports of 8 Gbit/s. These ASICs are used in the DCX Backbone Family of chassis and port blades, FS8-18 Encryption Blade, FX8-24 Extension Blade, and 300/5100/5300/7800/Encryption switches.\n\nThe seventh generation of Brocade ASICs are Condor 3. Condor 3 supports 48 ports of 16 Gbit/s per ASIC. These ASICs are used in the DCX 8510 Backbone Family and port blades, and the 6505/6510/6520 switches. The initial 16 Gbit/s product line (DCX 8510-8, DCX 8510-4, 6510 48-port switch, and 1860 Fabric Adapter) was originally launched in 2011. The 6505 24-port switch was launched in May 2012. The 6520 96-port switch was launched in March 2013.\n\nThe eighth generation of Brocade ASICs are Condor 4. Condor 4 supports 32 Gbit/s. These ASICs are used in DCX X6 Backbone Family and port blades, and the G610/G620/G630 switches.\n\nLatest products (Gen 6 - 32G):\n\nRecent products (16G):\n\nBrocade entered into the Federal, ISP, carrier, enterprise and campus switch/router market through its acquisition of Foundry Networks in 2008.\n\nIn September 2010, Brocade entered the 100 Gigabit Ethernet market with the 32-port Brocade MLXe Core Router chassis and a two-port 100 Gigabit Ethernet module, targeted at service providers and data centers, claiming twice the 100 Gigabit Ethernet density of Internet core routers from its competitors Cisco and Juniper. Along with it, the company also released the Brocade Network Advisor application for managing IP, storage, MPLS, application delivery, and wireless elements in converged service provider and data center networks. In November 2011, Brocade announced a large 100 Gigabit Ethernet deployment.\n\nIn December 2010, Brocade began shipping the Brocade VDX 6720 Switch as part of its product family for Ethernet fabric environments based on Brocade VCS Fabric technology designed for highly scalable virtualized and cloud computing environments. In August 2011, Brocade introduced two additional products for this family. The Brocade VDX 6730 Switch is a 10 GbE switch which can also use FCoE to bridge VCS Fabrics with Fibre Channel SAN fabrics. The Brocade VDX 6710 Switch is an entry-level 1/10 GbE switch which enables legacy 1 GbE servers to connect to VCS Fabrics as well as traditional LANs. In September 2012, Brocade announced a modular switch as part of this portfolio. The Brocade VDX 8770 Switch supports single VCS Fabrics as large as 8000+ switch ports supporting up to 384,000 VMs attached to a single VCS Fabric. The VDX 8770 provides port-to-port latency at 3.5 μs across 1, 10, and 40 GbE ports.\n\nIn November 2011, Brocade introduced the Brocade ICX product family. It released the Brocade ICX 6610 Switch for the Federal, enterprise and campus networking segment, with a maximum switching capacity of 576 Gbit/s and forwarding capacity of 432 Mpps with PoE+. In March 2012, Brocade released the Brocade ICX 6430 Switch and Brocade ICX 6450 Switch for the Federal, enterprise and campus networking segments, with full stacking capabilities as well as Layer 2 and Layer 3 functionality. The switches are available in 24- and 48-port 1 GbE models, with optional 1/10 GbE uplink/stacking ports. The company also announced its HyperEdge technology for automated single-point management and mix-and-max stacking for sharing advanced functionality among all the members of a switching stack. In September 2012, Brocade introduced the fixed form factor Brocade ICX 6650 switch. This Ethernet switch features 1/10 GbE ports for server connectivity and 10/40 GbE ports for uplink connectivity. It is designed for data center top-of-rack (ToR) environments and Federal, enterprise and campus LAN aggregation deployments.\n\nIn 2009, Brocade introduced the Brocade Mobility family of Wireless LAN (WLAN) solutions for Federal, enterprise and campus environments, including multiple models of access points and controllers.\n\nThe Brocade software product portfolio includes software networking and network management applications. Network Management solutions include:\n\n\nBrocade software networking solutions include the Brocade Vyatta 5400 vRouter and the Brocade vADX (a virtual version of Brocade's ADX application delivery platform).\n\n\nWithin the Ethernet/IP networking market, Brocade competes with the following companies:\n\nBrocade is a dominant vendor in the Fibre Channel Storage Area Network (SAN) networking market, competing with the following companies:\n\nIn 2005, Gregory Reyes resigned as CEO after being indicted for securities fraud relating to backdating stock option grants. After spending about a year investigating these allegations, the Department of Justice (DoJ), through the US Attorney's Office, the SEC, and the FBI filed criminal and civil charges against Reyes. In roughly the same time frame, the DoJ, SEC, and FBI also began investigating over 100 other companies for similar activities. Greg Reyes and Stephanie Jensen, the former vice president of HR, were charged with 12 counts of fraud. Two counts were dismissed, and on August 7, 2007, Reyes was convicted on the remaining 10 counts. On January 16, 2008, he was sentenced to 21 months in prison and ordered to pay a $15 million fine. Stephanie Jensen, Brocade's former vice president of human resources, was convicted in a separate trial. On March 19, 2008, she was sentenced to four months in prison and ordered to pay a $1.25 million fine. The convictions of both Reyes and Jensen were appealed. On August 18, 2009, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit overturned Gregory Reyes' convictions and sent the case back to the lower courts for retrial, where he was again convicted, and sentenced to 18 months in prison and a $10 million fine. Reyes was incarcerated at the Taft Correctional Institution in Taft, California, with an anticipated release date of December 29, 2011. , a second appeal remains pending.\n\nBrocade announced on August 6, 2012, a San Jose federal court jury returned its verdict in the case of Brocade v. A10 Networks, and found A10 responsible for broad-based intellectual property infringement and unfair competition, awarding approximately $112 million to Brocade The trial lasted three weeks.\nThe jury unanimously awarded punitive damages against A10 and also personally against its CEO Lee Chen, strongly condemning Chen and A10's unfair competition. The jury also returned an unambiguous verdict for patent and copyright infringement and trade secret misappropriation covering A10's entire AX Series load balancing server products. Brocade announced on January 11, 2013, a San Jose federal court confirmed a $60 million damages verdict against A10 Networks and entered an order permanently enjoining A10 from infringing on Brocade's patents involving technologies for Global Server Load Balancing and High Availability. On May 20, 2013, Brocade and A10 reached an agreement to settle the lawsuit, along with all related claims. Among other agreed upon terms, A10 granted Brocade a broad patent license and agreed to pay Brocade $5 million in cash and issue a $70 million unsecured convertible promissory note payable to Brocade.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2226539", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2226539", "title": "British Rail Class 60", "text": "British Rail Class 60\n\nThe British Rail Class 60 is a class of Co-Co heavy freight diesel-electric locomotives built by Brush Traction. They are nicknamed Tugs by rail enthusiasts.\n\nIn the 1980s, British Rail determined there was a requirement for a high-powered Type 5 diesel locomotive for use on its Trainload Freight sector. On 10 August 1987, the British Railways Board issued a competitive tender for response by 7 November, for a fleet of 100 locomotives. Of the six companies invited to tender, only three bid responses were received:\n\nOf the three bidders, Brush was selected, and an order was placed for 100 locomotives in a deal worth around £120 million.\n\nBrush sub-contracted parts construction, with final construction at Brush's erecting shops at Loughborough. The bodyshells, shared with the Class 92 electric locomotives, were fabricated by Procor (UK) of Wakefield. The engine was a higher-powered development of the Mirrlees engine previously fitted experimentally to Class 37 nos. 37 901-37 904.\n\nThe first locomotive was delivered in June 1989 and sent to Derby for testing, which revealed a number of teething problems. Parts requiring modifications included the axle box suspension and the Mirlees engine cylinder head.\n\nUnlike the Classes 59 and 66 (solid girder underframe) the Class 60s have a monocoque stressed skin construction with diagonal trusses - with the external bodywork providing support for the internal components.\n\nTwo different cab designs were considered and full size mock-ups were made in wood, plastic and metal by the Engineering Development Unit at the Railway Technical Centre in Derby. One of these had a French-style raked-forward cab end, similar to the SNCF Class CC 72000, but this was rejected in favour of a more conventional cab.\n\nThe main alternator is a Brush BA1006A type, providing power for the traction motors via rectification circuits to DC, the auxiliary alternator is Brush BAA 702A Auxiliary Alternator, providing power for the radiator fans, lubrication and fuel oil pumps, traction motor cooling fans and air compressors amongst others. The main and auxiliary alternators are both driven by the main engine.\n\nEach of the six axles is driven via a reduction gear by one nose suspended axle hung traction motor (Brush designed and built TM2161A four pole motors). Each motor has a separate microprocessor-controlled power supply (SEPEX in Brush's designation - from \"Separately Excited\"), a system that was first tried on one Class 58, 58050. One feature of this system is that if one set of wheels/axle/motor starts to wheelslip their speed can be reduced without affecting the other motors.\n\nThe engine is an 8-cylinder, 145 litre Mirrlees Blackstone 8MB275T diesel traction engine (275 mm cylinder diameter); the Mirrlees engine was one of the most fuel efficient available at the time (189g of fuel per kWhr), but relatively heavy. The engine was also successfully installed in marine applications such as small ships and passenger ferries. The low cylinder count for the rated power was expected to result in lower maintenance costs.\n\n\nFollowing the privatisation of British Rail all 100 units came under the management of the English Welsh & Scottish (EWS), It was EWS's policy not to reduce the 100 strong fleet, with both fire and collision damaged locomotives receiving repairs. In 2003/04 a number of the fleet were stored, surplus to requirements. Between 2004 and 2007 typically between 50–75% of the fleet would be out of action at a given time. In 2007 the operational fleet was estimated to be 60 locomotives.\nIn June 2007 EWS was acquired by DB Schenker, a wholly owned subsidiary of the German railway company, Deutsche Bahn. Since working for EWS/DB Schenker, Class 60s have typically been employed on stone, aggregate, ballast and petroleum traffic and also on steel trains. By 2009 many Class 60s were in storage, with only fifteen in operation at any one time.\n\nIn September 2010 twenty of the class were offered for disposal by DB Schenker UK, whilst in November 2010 DBS announced that 20 units would be overhauled. In January 2011 DB Schenker announced that seven units would undergo an overhaul, with an option of an overhaul on a further fourteen units. In January 2013, the overhaul was described as an \"upgrade\" to create a new fleet of \"Super 60's\". DB Schenker gave no technical details but, according to Tugtracker, there were mechanical upgrades trialled on 60 099 and electrical upgrades trialled on 60 011. Tugtracker also gives a list of eighteen locomotives upgraded between 1 September 2011 and 1 October 2013.\n\nLocomotives which had gone through the Super 60 program by September 2013 included (17); 60 007, 010, 015, 017, 019, 020, 024, 039, 040, 054, 059, 062, 063, 074, 079, 091, 092, with another four programmed later that year; 60 001, 044, 066 and 60 100, although its unclear if all of these were completed. \n\nIn 2012 some Class 60s were offered for sale through Romic-Ace International Pte Ltd. In late 2013 DB Schenker Rail UK offered 20 locomotives for sale. These were to be purchased on 31 October 2013 by Doncaster-based Wabtec Rail in a £10m deal - the deal was reported to have fallen through in 2014.\n\nIn August 2017 DB Cargo UK offered a further 20 locomotives for sale, these being 60 003, 004, 005, 006, 008, 013, 014, 018, 022, 023, 025, 027, 030, 031, 032, 037, 042, 050, 051, and 052. They were sold to Wabtec Rail. However again this sale subsequently fell through. In late 2018 DB Cargo UK offered 3 Class 60's (60 004, 014 and 018) for sale, which caused the status of the previous sale of Class 60 locomotives to Wabtec to be uncertain, given all 3 locomotives had thought to have been included in the previous Wabtec sale.\n\nOn 1 December 2018 DB Cargo UK offered further Class 60s for sale - 60 008, 028, 029, 046, 055, 064, 070 and 098, which was the first time 60 064 had been put up for sale.\n\nIn 2019 DB Cargo UK offered 60 006, 050, 060, 081 and 086 for sale, stored at Toton. All found buyers with three, initially, sold to metal recyclers (60 006 & 086 sold to Ron Hull, Rotherham, 60 050 to Raxstar) and 60 060 & 081 to 'Private Sales'. Subsequently, 60 086 was resold to a private owner and 60 050 was purchased by the same individual.\n\nOn 20 January 2020 60 006 was scrapped at Toton and was the first of the class to be scrapped.\n\nOn 10 February 2020 60 086 was transferred to the Wensleydale Railway and into preservation. This was followed by 60 050.\n\nIn July 2018 GB Railfreight bought all ten of Colas Rail’s Class 60 locomotives, Colas having replaced them with a further seven orders for Class 70 locomotives.\n\nIn March 2019 DCRail acquired four locomotives from DB Cargo; 60 028, 029, 046, 055. These are being overhauled by DB Cargo at Toton TMD with 60 046 the first to enter service in November 2019.\n\nBy 1990, the class had started to be introduced onto the mainline, replacing previously double headed Class 33 Type 3s in the South East region, as well as Classes 20, 26, 27, 31 and 73. The first locos accepted into traffic were 60 017 and 60 018 in October 1990. The class 60s primarily worked on aggregate (specifically stone) traffic also replacing Class 56s and Class 58s, some of which were withdrawn, others transferred. Their introduction replaced double-heading and also allowed longer and/or heavier trains to be worked.\n\nIn June 2014 it was reported that 10 locos have been sold to Colas Rail. The numbers are 60 002/021/026/047/056/076/085/087/095/096. The first one to appear in the Colas yellow and orange livery was 60 087, which was photographed at Burton-on-Trent on 2 June 2014. In July 2018 Colas Rail sold all ten of its locomotives to GB Railfreight.\n\n\nIn 1989 Railfreight named the Class 60s in traditional fashion; those locomotives attached to the construction and metals sectors were named after British mountains as were some attached to the coal sector. The others (coal and petroleum sectors) received the names of famous British citizens, with an emphasis on those whose contribution had been to science and engineering. Locomotives numbered 60 001 and 60 098 were exceptions, being named \"Steadfast\" and \"Charles Francis Brush\" respectively. The locomotives received the standard liveries of their respective sectors.\nAfter coming into EWS's ownership, the Class 60 locomotives were repainted in the red and yellow EWS livery as and when repainting was necessary. Many others carried vinyl stickers on their sides over the former BR sector liveries, demonstrating EWS's ownership. A few locos received new names including 60 033: \"Tees Steel Express\", painted in British Steel blue, and 60 081, repainted in a mock Great Western Railway green livery and renamed \"Isambard Kingdom Brunel\" in 2000.\n\nIn 2007/08, two locomotives received special liveries: 60 074 received a 'powder blue' livery and was named \"Teenage Spirit\" at the National Railway Museum in York as part of a charity event for the Teenage Cancer Trust. 60 040 was repainted in a red livery and named \"The Territorial Army Centenary\" as part of the celebration of that event. Both of these locos have since been repainted into standard DB Schenker livery.\n\nIn 2010 class 60 number 60 099 was repainted into a Tata Steel silver livery and logo at Toton TMD and unveiled at Tata's Scunthorpe plant on 27 September.\n\nIn January 2011 60 011 became the first member of the class to receive the standard DB Schenker livery, after a repaint at Toton TMD.\n\nIn late May 2014 60 087 emerged from Toton TMD in Colas livery. It was joined by 60 002, 021, 026, 047, 056, 076, 085, 095 and 096.\n\nIn 2019 DCR Cappagh acquired four former DB Cargo Class 60s, from store, which were overhauled and repainted by DB Cargo at Toton TMD. 60 046 and 60 055 were repainted in the DC Rail Freight corporate grey livery. 60 046 regained its original name, \"William Wilberforce\", whilst 60 055 regained its original name, \"Thomas Barnardo\". 60 028 was turned out in a blue livery, with large CAPPAGH logo. On 18 February 2020 the final locomotive of the quartet, 60 029, emerged from a repaint, at Toton TMD, in DC Rail Freight grey and carrying its original name, \"Ben Nevis\".\n\nOn 20th January 2020 work began scrapping locomotive 60 006 at Toton depot, the first Class 60 to be dismantled.\n\nFleet summary 2020.\n\nPresently three members of the class have been preserved.\n\nThe locomotives have been reproduced in scale model form by Heljan in O scale, Lima and Hornby in OO scale and Graham Farish in British N scale.\n\n"}

Having been apprenticed to his uncle, the publisher Johann Jakob Palm (1750–1826), in Erlangen, he married the daughter of the bookseller Stein in Nuremberg, and in the course of time became proprietor of his father-in-law's business.\n\nIn the spring of 1806, the Stein publishing house sent to the bookselling establishment of Stage in Augsburg a pamphlet (presumably written by Philipp Christian Yelin in Ansbach) entitled \"Deutschland in seiner tiefen Erniedrigung\" (\"Germany in her deep humiliation\"), which strongly attacked Napoleon and the behaviour of the French troops in Bavaria. On learning of the violent rhetorical attack made upon his régime and failing to discover the actual author, Napoleon had Palm arrested in and handed over to a military commission at Braunau am Inn on the Bavarian-Austrian frontier, with peremptory instructions to try the prisoner and execute him within twenty-four hours. Palm was denied the right of defence, and after a show trial on 25 August 1806, he was shot the following day without having betrayed the pamphlet's author.\n\nA life-size bronze statue was erected to his memory in Braunau in 1866, and on the centenary of his death, numerous patriotic meetings were held throughout Bavaria. Since 2002 a private foundation at Schorndorf awards a Johann Philipp Palm Prize for freedom of speech and the press.\n\nIt was to Palm that the poet Thomas Campbell was referring when he gave his famous (and possibly apocryphal) toast to Napoleon at a literary dinner. When this caused uproar, he admitted that Napoleon was a tyrant and an enemy of their country, \"But gentlemen! He once shot a publisher.\"\n\nPalm is briefly mentioned in Adolf Hitler's autobiography \"Mein Kampf\" (My Struggle), indirectly in the first sentence of the book. Hitler wrote, \"It has turned out fortunate for me to-day that destiny appointed Braunau-on-the-Inn to be my birthplace.\" Later on the same page, Palm is mentioned by name as a link to the first sentence.\n\n"}

She was the daughter of the Portuguese king Afonso I and Matilda of Savoy. She served as co-regent of Portugal with her brother during the illness of their father Afonso I of Portugal from 1172 until 1173, and regent of Flanders during the interim period after the death of her spouse and the accession of his heir.\n\nTheresa, her brother Sancho and sister Urraca were the only children of Afonso and Matilda to survive to adulthood. Named after her paternal grandmother, Countess Theresa, she was reputedly King Afonso I's favourite.\n\nDuring their father's illness, Sancho at first exercised regency alone but from 1172 he shared the government with Theresa. At that time Afonso started considering to allow Theresa to succeed to the throne, and in 1173 he declared Sancho and Theresa co-heirs. As Afonso's illness progressed, the role of the siblings increased. Sancho took over military matters, while Theresa assumed administrative functions.\n\nDue to her proximity to the throne and fears of a loss of independence, a marriage with an Iberian lord was undesirable. Theresa thus remained unmarried until relatively late.\n\nAround 1183 envoys came from the County of Flanders to ask for Theresa's hand in marriage to Count Philip. Perhaps because of the difficulty of pronouncing her name, she became known as Matilda. Her marriage was celebrated (in the Tournai Cathedral, Bruges) after the death of Elisabeth of Vermandois, first wife of Philip, who hadn't given him any children, and was because Philip needed an heir so that his county wouldn't fall into French hands. For its part, Portugal, a new-born country, managed to secure an important alliance with Flanders, and European recognition. Theresa brought a considerable dowry, something that helped Philip manage his war with France for a couple of more years, before making peace in 1186. A reasonable number of Portuguese immigrants (mainly merchants) also went to Flanders with the infanta.\n\nMatilda lived in one of the most luxurious courts of Europe, in which Philip patronized Chrétien de Troyes, author of a famous cycle of Arthurian stories and one of the fathers of the Holy Grail theme in literature. However, like Elisabeth of Vermandois, Matilda never gave birth, and after Philip's death, the county passed to his sister, Margaret I, and her husband, Baldwin VIII.\n\nAfter Philip's death in August 1191, Matilda, holding extensive dower lands in southern and coastal Flanders, was powerful enough to challenge the rule of her sister-in-law and brother-in-law, provoking unrest among the public in her dower lands by raising the taxes and becoming a central figure of the part of the nobility opposing the succession of Margaret and Baldwin, but was forced to relent.\n\nIn 1193, Matilda married again, this time to Odo III, Duke of Burgundy. Her second marriage produced no children, and so, she ended up being repudiated by the Duke, so that he could marry Alice of Vergy. She returned to Flanders and would be instrumental in arranging the marriage of her nephew Ferdinand to Margaret I and Baldwin VIII's granddaughter, Joan, Countess of Flanders.\n\nShe died when her carriage accidentally fell into a marsh near Veurne where she drowned.\n\nShe is celebrated in Bruges every year.\n"}

{"id": "2226618", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2226618", "title": "Slug and Lettuce", "text": "Slug and Lettuce\n\nSlug and Lettuce is a chain of bars that operate in the United Kingdom, with a large number located in London and South East England. As of 2017, there are a total of 70 outlets. Hugh Corbett opened the first Slug and Lettuce in Islington in 1985. He attempted to enhance the public house environment, at a time when standards were often low.\n\nThe bars are designed for a youthful clientele, and aim to attract an equal number of men and women with \"female friendly\" designs. The chain has remained relevant by continually re-inventing itself for the contemporary marketplace. The chain has gone through a number of owners throughout its history, and is currently owned by the Stonegate Pub Company, based in Luton, Bedfordshire.\n\nHugh Corbett, an entrepreneur with a background in the hotel industry, opened The Slug and Lettuce pub on Islington Green, North London in 1985. At the time, Islington was becoming increasingly gentrified due to its proximity to the City of London financial district. Corbett owned a small number of pubs, which he rechristened with humorous or nonsensical names, with the effect of differentiating them from competitors. His pubs had the then notable differential of stripped out carpets and enlarged windows so that people could see inside from the street. Corbett listed his business in 1989 as Fast Forward, by which time it was a nine-strong chain. In 1990 Roger Protz identified the group as an imitation of David Bruce's Firkin chain pubs.\nIn 1992, the David Bruce-controlled Grosvenor Inns acquired Fast Forward for £4.46 million, bringing Grosvenor's total number of pubs to thirty. By this time, Fast Forward owned thirteen pubs, all based around the London area, with seven under the Slug name. The decision was taken to appeal to customers in their 20s and 30s and make the bar \"more contemporary\", \"more of a bar, less of a pub\", \"young and even rowdy\" and \"not blokey – not a very male environment\", aiming for an equal proportion of both male and female clientele. Sheila McKenzie, who had founded the female-friendly Pitcher & Piano chain, was enlisted to enact these changes, and the Slug and Lettuce concept has been described as her \"brainchild\". Grosvenor felt that the pub chain had \"lost its way\", and concentrated on boosting its food operations.\n\nIn 1995, Slug and Lettuce was rebranded again, this time as a \"contemporary English bar\", designed to occupy the middle ground between a continental café and a classic English pub. By this time, food constituted 30 per cent of total sales. In 1997 the chain identified its primary competitors as the All Bar One and Pitcher & Piano bar chains. In 1998 Grosvenor Inns changed its name to The Slug and Lettuce Group, reflecting the fact that the now 22-strong chain had become the company's sole focus. The chain also announced that it would not stock the amusement with prize machines common in many other pubs. In 1998, the chain encountered its first major setback after it expanded into the North of England with five outlets in Nottingham, York, Manchester, Harrogate and Leeds. These sites all made profit losses in their first six months of operation, which triggered the company's first profit warning. In 1999, the chain first entered the Scottish market, with an outlet in Glasgow. Meanwhile, the company board was criticised for a lack of dynamism and being too slow to expand its number of outlets. The chain launched a website in February 2000. All Slug and Lettuce outlets serve food throughout the day, and the meals are English inspired, with offerings including sandwiches, burgers, pasta and salads. Outlets sell a range of cocktails, beer and wine. Since 2011, outlets have opened early for breakfast.\nIn mid-2000, SFI, the owner of the Litten Tree bar chain, announced a £31.6 million takeover of Slug and Lettuce, paid for in shares, and McKenzie left the chain to pursue new challenges. By this time the chain had 32 outlets. According to analysts, the chain was too small and had too much debt to survive alone. SFI refurbished a number of their existing pubs under the Slug and Lettuce concept, and by 2004 the chain had 56 outlets. In 2005, SFI attempted to reposition the chain as an upmarket place to eat, in anticipation of the forthcoming smoking ban. In June 2005 SFI went into administration, and sold 98 of its 150 outlets to the Laurel Pub Company, controlled by Robert Tchenguiz, for £80 million. In 2008 Laurel itself collapsed, and the Slug chain became a part of the Bay Restaurant Group, later Town & City Pub Company. The chain has withdrawn from a number of locations, including Glasgow and Cardiff, leaving it with only one location in Scotland, and no presence in Wales. In 2010, Town & City began to refurbish the outlets, switching from a brown colour scheme to aubergine and updating upholstery and lighting. In June 2011 Town & City merged with the Stonegate Pub Company.\n\nSince 2011 outlets have opened early to serve breakfast. In September 2012 the Stonegate company chairman Ian Payne announced plans to expand the chain, which he claimed had outperformed the high street for the past three years, and was enjoying double digit growth. As of 2012, outlets are being refurbished with a colour scheme of gold, purple, green and plum.\n\nThe menu largely comprises traditional English inspired cuisine, and includes such items as burgers, curries, pasta and salads. In drinks, the chain focuses on beer, wine and spirits based cocktails such as the Long Island Ice Tea and mojitos. Some outlets sell cask ale. In 2006 the chain switched to selling exclusively fair trade coffee. In 2000, average annual turnover of each site was just below £900,000. Outlets typically occupy around 2,000 square feet in area, and include converted banks and churches.\n\nIn 1994 \"The Times\" described the chain as \"a modish hang-out for the stripped pine brigade\". The chain's interior layout has been described as \"minimalist\". The chain has been criticised by some, such as the writer Will Self, for spreading a bland uniformity throughout British high streets, and for removing individual elements from the pubs that it converts. In 1997, a Slug and Lettuce in a listed building in Islington Green illegally removed its old mahogany bar, which it was later forced to restore.\n\nThe appeal of the Slug and Lettuce concept has seen it become widely imitated, with Zoe Williams of \"The Guardian\" commenting in 2012, \"Does anybody remember in the 90s, when the Slug and Lettuce pub chain deliberately fancied itself up to appeal to the lady drinker? And wham, two seconds later, that's where all the men wanted to drink as well, so that all pubs had to become more like Slugs and Lettuces just to survive?\"\n\n"}

It is the only species in the monotypic genus Howellia. Thomas Jefferson Howell and Joseph Howell discovered the species in 1878.\n\nThe water howellia is found in large area of the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. It can be found in California, Idaho, Montana, and Washington, and it is known historically from Oregon.\n\nThe plant grows in wetland habitat surrounded by forests, which provide organic material. Associated tree species include \"Populus trichocarpa\" (California poplar), \"P. tremuloides\" (quaking aspen), and \"Fraxinus latifolia\" (Oregon ash). The water bodies are located in glacial potholes, river oxbows, ephemeral ponds, flood plains and other areas that fill with water periodically as snow melts and spring rain falls.\n\nThe plant produces two types of flowers. Submerged cleistogamous flowers remain closed and self-pollinate, and flowers that bloom above the surface of the water open into white blossoms and may cross with other individuals. Because it often pollinates itself, the species has a low genetic diversity. Seeds are produced in the water but they require open air for germination, so they sprout when the wetland has dried in the fall.\n\nThreats to this species include loss of habitat to logging and draining and conversion to urban use, alteration of the local hydrology by placement of dams and dikes, deposition of silt, livestock activity, introduced species of plants, low genetic diversity, and climate change.\n\n"}

She studied economics at the University of British Columbia (UBC) earning her bachelor's degree in 1975. She received an MA from the University of Toronto in 1978.\n\nChong's career as an economist began when she moved to Ottawa to work in the Department of Finance, where she was employed until 1980. She then worked for one year as a special advisor in the Prime Minister's Office, dealing with issues pertaining to British Columbia. In 1981 she became a senior economic advisor and worked closely with the late Pierre Elliot Trudeau until the end of his term in 1984. It has been noted that her presence, as a Chinese female, was remarkable in the white male dominated world of government finance and that \"she was a trailblazer for the more inclusive public service that was to come.\" Denise Chong's career in the Canadian government is made even more significant with her realization, through her familial and historical research, that her \"grandparents lived in Canada at a time when they could not participate in White society. They were excluded from it: they could not take out citizenship, they couldn't own land, they couldn't vote.\" \n\nWith the end of Trudeau's term in 1984, Denise Chong left her role as a public servant in order to pursue a career as a professional writer.\n\nThough her professional writing career did not begin until much later, Denise Chong was a journalist for the \"Ubyssey\", a student newspaper at UBC, while she was an undergraduate student there.\n\nDenise Chong has published four non-fiction books of literary non-fiction and edited one compilation of short stories. Because of the importance of the Canadian historical research in Chong's first book, a memoir of her family, \"The Concubine's Children\", she has become \"renowned as a writer and commentator on Canadian history and on the family.\" This book, one of the first non-fiction narrative accounts of the Chinese in Canada, was a \"Globe and Mail\" best seller for ninety-three weeks. \nThat Denise Chong's work has been important to the study of Canada is also reflected by the fact that a speech that she gave for Citizenship Week in 1995 entitled \"Being Canadian\" has been widely anthologized, including in the books \"Who Speaks for Canada: Words that Shape a Country\" by D. Morton and M. Weinfeld (1998), and \"Great Canadian Speeches\" by D. Gruending (2004).\n\nChong's emphasis on the voices of women, as well as her particular brand of nationalism (which is more than a little critical), are both reflected in her edited compilation \"The Penguin Anthology of Stories by Canadian Women\". That many of the authors published in this anthology are also women of transnational identities is a reflection of Denise Chong's concern for the multicultural quality of being Canadian. In Chong's own words, \"Canadian citizenship recognizes differences. It praises diversity. It is what we as Canadians \"choose\" to have in common with each other […] How we tell our stories is the work of citizenship\". In her Introduction to the anthology, Chong highlights what attracted her to the stories, seeming to also articulate one of the strong characteristics of her own writing: \"The plot that interested me was life lived in the chaos and uncertainty of everyday happenings and relationships.\" All of Chong's books evoke such \"everyday happenings and relationships\" amidst the extraordinary circumstances of war, communism, immigration, and racism.\n\nDenise Chong's second book, \"The Girl in the Picture\", about iconic Vietnamese napalm victim Kim Phuc, was also groundbreaking, in its portrayal of everyday life in war-torn Vietnam. Her book \"\", released on 29 September 2009 by Random House Canada., was Chong's first book in a decade. \"Egg on Mao\" tells the story of Lu Decheng, a bus mechanic, who, with two friends, challenged his family's communist allegiance by defacing a portrait of chairman Mao Zedong during the 1989 protests in Tiananmen Square. In an interview about this story exploring human rights in China, Chong said, \"It was a very Chinese act. In the West, we would view something like this as a quixotic and think how naive these men were. But in China, it's your only gesture. Of course they were naive. But you have to balance the futility of the gesture against the weight of repression… people are willing to make a futile gesture for the nobility of having acted.\"\n\nHer 2013 non-fiction book, \"Lives of the Family: Stories of Fate and Circumstance\", relates stories about the experiences of Chinese-Canadian families who settled in Canada's National Capital Region. This work earned her praise in \"Toronto Star\" and \"Vancouver Sun\" book reviews, republished by Penguin Random House Canada \n\n\nIn addition to continuing her career as a writer, Chong serves on the boards, task forces, and committees of several organizations including the Task Force on the Participation of Visible Minorities in the Federal Public Service, the National Advisory Board on Culture Online, and the McGill Institute for the Study of Canada. In 2013, she was appointed to the Order of Canada, the country's highest civilian award.\nDenise Chong lives in Ottawa, Ontario, with her husband, CTV reporter Roger Smith, and her two children, Jade and Kai. She received honorary doctorates from York University in October 2007, Bishop's University, and the University of Northern British Columbia.\n\n"}

Tad's a guy who just gets everything wrong that Dick Grayson gets right, and he doesn't even necessarily have good in his heart... He wanted the bragging rights of being a hero without having anything to recommend him as a hero, except that he got a buzz off the danger.\"\n\nTad Ryerstad is a sociopath and possesses a great deal of rage while being prone to loud outbursts, as well as frequently referring to himself in the third person. The similarities between his name and Nightwing's has gotten him into trouble in the past, and has nearly led to him being murdered on two different occasions.\n\nHaving grown up an orphan, the man who would become Nite-Wing never gained a legal name. Instead, he goes by the first name Tad—originally Tadpole, the nickname he was given whilst in the orphanage because of his diminutive size. He later adopts the last name of Ryerstad, which is the name of a local beer brand. Tad ran away from the orphanage at age 12, and was \"forgotten\"—further proof that Blüdhaven is seeped in corruption and decay. He educated himself, devouring popular culture by stealing paperbacks and comic books and sneaking into countless movies. This inadequate and twisted education, combined with an unstable and loveless childhood, produced a sociopath who believes himself to be a hero.\n\nTad exercised, kept himself in good shape, and patrolled his neighborhood, doing \"good\". He beat people for minor offences, and performed acts of vigilantism at its worst; he brutally assaulted innocent bystanders on at least two occasions, assuming them to be criminals—it is implied that at least one of his victims was killed. One day, he met John Law, the retired hero \"Tarantula\", and after hearing his stories, decided to become a superhero. He had difficulty coming up with a name until he looked across the street from his apartment at an all-night deli specializing in chicken wings. Thus, Nite-Wing was born.\n\nUnfortunately, on his first night out, he ran into a gang that shot him repeatedly. Rushed off to an emergency room, Nightwing spent the whole night defending him from Blockbuster's men, who thought it was Nightwing who was in the hospital. Tad was released from the hospital and went back to take revenge on the gang who put him there, killing them.\n\nTad’s rampage continued, killing men who worked for Blockbuster, eventually even Ricky Noone, one of his major capos. One night, he was cornered by Dudley Soames, the former police inspector turned psychopath, who now called himself Torque. Here, he finally met Nightwing. The two escaped Torque, and Nightwing agreed to help train Tad, not realizing how violent he could be.\n\nTad cornered Blüdhaven’s corrupt Police Chief Redhorn and got all the files he had pertaining to Blockbuster. Presenting them to Nightwing, the two began to attack Blockbuster’s powerbase. They were captured and separated. When Cisco Blaine, an undercover FBI agent, came to free Tad, Tad beat him to death. Upon discovering that he was not a villain, but a government agent, Tad fled. Nightwing eventually tracked him down, and he was imprisoned in Lockhaven Penitentiary. Tad naively attempted to get himself released by giving a detailed account of his \"crime fighting career\" to the Federal agents who held him in custody, fully expecting them to release him since he was a \"good guy\", and the murder had been an innocent mistake on his part.\n\nWhen Torque was captured by Nightwing, he was made Tad’s cellmate. Torque had a plan to escape, and he made Tad a part of it. They drugged the food of Aaron Helzinger, the prison guard who was the reformed villain Amygdala, and when he went berserk, the two escaped. Tad killed Soames after his escape, and was implicated in the murder of Chief Redhorn. However, Tad was innocent of that crime, set up by Blockbuster and the new Tarantula, and he contacted Nightwing to help clear himself. Tad was arrested again, along with Tarantula, and resides again in Lockhaven, serving his time for the murders of Cisco Blaine and Torque.\n\nIn \"Nightwing\" #51, \"Tad's Story\" revealed the detailed history of Tad, but contradicted the previous claim of him being abandoned. Instead, the story showed both of his parents alive; his father Randy as an abusive alcoholic and his mother perpetually using the phone and smoking. Due to his lack of parental involvement, Tad began to read comic books as a means of escapist fantasy.\nSoon, he began to resent his father, who earned money through the sale of stolen goods. Believing firmly in the world of comic books, Tad performs an act he believes to be heroic: the framing of his father. Tad informed his father's crack-dealer of an employer and accused his father of being a snitch. As a result, his father was murdered and his mother sent to jail.\n\nAfter being sent to live with foster parents, he ran away and began to live on his own. Due to his lack of a job, he was usually a vagrant, and could afford to feed himself only through stealing from criminals.\n\nFollowing his capture at the hands of Nightwing and subsequent arrest for the murder of Cisco Blaine, he was revealed to have been left on a Blüdhaven bus on Christmas Eve.\n\nNite-Wing saw himself as a hero, and he sought to bring justice to the world, but his methods were very flawed; he had killed a number of people, including an undercover FBI agent. Tad does not appear to understand the consequences of his actions, merely shrugging off any regret or responsibility by stating that he is a \"good guy\".\n\nTad has no superpowers, however he is a capable and ruthless street fighter. Often, he carries many billiard balls taped to his back and uses a modified three-foot pool stick as a weapon.\n\n"}

{"id": "2226662", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2226662", "title": "Ademption", "text": "Ademption\n\nAdemption, or ademption by extinction, is a common law doctrine used in the law of wills to determine what happens when property bequeathed under a will is no longer in the testator's estate at the time of the testator's death. For a devise (bequest) of a specific item of property (a specific gift), such property is considered \"adeemed\", and the gift fails. For example, if a will bequeathed the testator's car to a specific beneficiary, but the testator owned no car at the time of his or her death, the gift would be \"adeemed\" and the aforementioned beneficiary would receive no gift at all.\n\nGeneral bequests or general gifts - gifts of cash amounts - are never adeemed. If the cash in the testator's estate is not sufficient to satisfy the gift, then other assets in the residuary estate will need to be sold to raise the necessary cash.\n\nSome property lies in a \"gray\" area, in which the testator's specific intent must be determined. For example, where the testator bequeathes \"500 shares of stock\" in a company, this may be read as a general bequest (that the estate should purchase and convey the particular stocks to the beneficiary), or it may be read as a specific bequest, particularly if the testator used a possessive (\"\"my\" 500 shares\"). Such a gift is deemed to be a demonstrative gift. Such demonstrative gifts are deemed to be a hybrid of both specific and general gifts. If one were to bequeath \"500 shares of stock,\" most states would deem that to be a demonstrative gift. The resultant gift to the heir receiving \"500 shares,\" would be the date of death value of 500 shares of that particular stock.\n\nAdemption may be waived if the property leaves the estate after the testator has been declared incompetent. Furthermore, in some cases the beneficiary will be entitled to the proceeds from the sale of property, or to the insurance payout for property that is lost or destroyed.\n\nTo avoid confusion as to what may or may not be adeemed, sometimes the phrase \"if owned by me at my death\" is placed into the articles of a will in which property is being bequeathed.\n\nAs for the sale of land under an executory contract, traditional case law agrees that ademption occurs upon the death of the testator and that the proceeds of sale, when the closing occurs, should not pass to the specific devisee of the property. However, the more modern view and the Uniform Probate Code, which has been adopted by some states, disagrees. These jurisdictions find that when property subject to specific devise is placed under contract of sale before the decedent's death, the proceeds of the sale will pass to the specific devisee.\n\nMany US jurisdictions have ameliorated the effects of the common law doctrine by statute.\n\nIn Wisconsin, state law (854.08) attempts to abolish the common law doctrine of ademption by extinction, by, for example, awarding beneficiaries the balance of the purchase price of the item sold (subject to some limitations).\n\nIn Virginia, ademption occurs with respect to most forms of property, but if the property at issue is stock certificates, then the buyout of the issuer of the stock by another company, and the swapping of the stocks for a new issue by that company, will not adeem the gift of stock. Similarly, if the shares of stock that existed at the time the gift was made have split (for example, where the holder of 500 shares receives a reissue of 1,000 shares each having half the value of the original), then the beneficiary of that gift will be entitled to the number of shares that exist \"after\" the split.\n"}

For news gathering, contribution over public internet is also now used. Modern applications such as hardware and software IP codecs have allowed the use of public 3G/4G networks to broadcast video and audio. The latency of 3G is around 100–500 ms, while 4G is less than 100 ms.\n\n\n"}

Along with the Queen Elizabeth Theatre and the Vancouver Playhouse, it is part of the Vancouver Civic Theatres group of live performance venues. It is the permanent home of the Vancouver Symphony Orchestra. The Orpheum is located on Granville Street near Smithe Street in Vancouver's downtown core. The interior of the theatre was featured prominently in the award-winning 2004 reboot of \"Battlestar Galactica\", where it is dressed to portray a heavenly opera house.\n\nDesigned by Scottish architect Marcus Priteca, the theatre officially opened on November 8, 1927 as a vaudeville house, but it hosted its first shows the previous day. The old Orpheum, at 761 Granville Street, was renamed the Vancouver Theatre (later the Lyric, then the International Cinema, then the Lyric once more before it closed for demolition in 1969 to make way for the first phase of the Pacific Centre project). The New Orpheum, which was the biggest theatre in Canada when it opened in 1927, with three thousand seats, cost $1.25 million to construct. The first manager of the theatre was William A. Barnes.\n\nFollowing the end of vaudeville's heyday in the early 1930s, the Orpheum became primarily a movie house under Famous Players ownership, although it would continue to host live events on occasion. Ivan Ackery managed the Orpheum during most of this period, from 1935 up until his 1969 retirement.\n\nIn 1973, for economic reasons, Famous Players decided to gut the inside of the Orpheum and change it into a multiplex. A \"Save the Orpheum\" public protest and fundraising campaign was launched, which even Jack Benny flew in to help with, and the Orpheum was saved. On March 19, 1974, the City of Vancouver bought the theatre for $7.1 million, with $3.1 million coming from the city itself, and $1.5 million from each of the provincial and federal governments. The Orpheum closed on November 23, 1975 and a renovation and restoration was done by the architectural company Thomson, Berwick, Pratt and Partners. It re-opened on April 2, 1977 and has since been the permanent home of the Vancouver Symphony Orchestra. Tony Heinsbergen, a U.S. designer who originally chose the color scheme for the interior (ivory, moss green, gold and burgundy) was brought back, fifty years later, for the renovation. In 1983, an additional entrance was opened on Smithe Street.\n\nThe theatre was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 1979. The Orpheum's present neon sign was installed during the 1970s, donated by to the theatre by Jim Pattison. The theatre and its neon sign have been used as a key location in several episodes of the science-fiction series \"Battlestar Galactica\" and \"Fringe\", as well as \"\". It was also the location of the filming of the Dan Mangan documentary \"What Happens Next?\" by Brent Hodge.\n\nIn 2006, the Capitol Residences development was proposed for the old Capitol 6 cinema site adjacent to the Orpheum. The City of Vancouver gave the developer permission for extra height and density on their site in return for a major expansion to the Orpheum, including a long desired back stage area. This was the largest amenities trade in the history of the city, and will increase the usability of the facility.\n\n\n"}

Organizational units most commonly appear in X.500 directories, X.509 certificates, Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) directories, Active Directory (AD), and Lotus Notes directories and certificate trees, but they may feature in almost any modern directory or digital certificate container grouping system.\n\nIn most systems, organizational units appear within a top-level organization grouping or organization certificate, called a domain. In many systems one OU can also exist within another OU. When OUs are nested, as one OU contains another OU, this creates a relationship where the contained OU is called the child and the container is called the parent. Thus, OUs are used to create a hierarchy of containers within a domain. Only OUs within the same domain can have relationships. OUs of the same name in different domains are independent.\n\nThe name \"organizational unit\" appears to represent a single organization with multiple units (departments) within that organization. However, OUs do not always follow this model. They might represent geographical regions, job-functions, associations with other (external) groups, or the technology used in relation to the objects.\n\nExamples would include:\n\nIn Sun Java System Directory Server and Microsoft Active Directory (AD), an organizational unit (OU) can contain any other unit, including other OUs, users, groups, and computers. Organizational units in separate domains may have identical names but are independent of each other. \n\nOUs let an administrator group computers and users so as to apply a common policy to them. Organizational Units give a hierarchical structure, and when properly designed can ease administration.\n\nNovell and Lotus supplied the two largest software directory systems. Each of these companies started with flat account and directory structures, and encountered the support and name-conflict limitations inherent in their flat structures. They adopted the X.500 OU concept into their next-generation software around 1993 – Novell with the release of Novell Directory Services (subsequently known as eDirectory), and Lotus with the release of the third version of Lotus Notes. Microsoft allegedly used Novell's directory as a blueprint for the first released versions of AD, but this claim appears suspect, given that X.500 served as the \"granddaddy\" of all directory systems.\n"}

His father was a school teacher. Tretyakov graduated in 1916 from the department of law at Moscow University. He began to publish in 1913 and just before the Russian Revolution he became associated with the ego-futurists. Soon after the publication of \"Iron Pause\", he became heavily involved in the Siberian futurist movement known as \"Creation\" along with artists such as Nikolay Aseyev and David Burlyuk. Perhaps his most famous play at the time was the anti-imperialist \"Roar China!\" (1926), about the Wanhsien Incident.\n\nTretyakov was one of the founders of the constructivist journal \"LEF\", (1923–1925), and its successor \"Novyi LEF\" (\"New LEF\")(1927–1928), and of the associated artistic movement, whose main driving force was the poet Mayakovsky. They declared war on 'bourgeois' culture and claimed that the experimental avant garde works they produced were the artistic voice of the Bolshevik revolution. Boris Pasternak did not believe that any of the group actually wanted to destroy pre-revolutionary art, with one exception - \"The only consistent and honest man in this group of negationists was Sergei Tretyakov, who drove his negation to its natural conclusion. Like Plato, Tretyakov considered that there was no place for art in a young socialist state.\"\n\nHis first play, \"Earth Rampant,\" also known as \"The World Turned Upside Down\", premiered on March 4, 1923, directed by Vsevolod Meyerhold, was a commercial success that ran to 44 performances in 11 weeks, rescuing Moscow's Sohn Theatre, in which it was staged, from imminent bankruptcy. It was dedicated to 'the Red Army and the first soldier of the RSFSR, Leon Trotsky'. His next two of Tretyakov's first plays, \"Can You Hear Me. Moscow?\" and \"Gas Masks\" were directed by the young Sergei Eisenstein. The latter was staged in the Moscow Gas Works, for maximum realism. In 1924 Sergei Tretyakov made a lengthy visit to China, where he taught Russian literature and collected materials for some of his later publications. \"Roar China (Rychi Kitai)\" had its premier at the Meyerhold Theatre on January 23, 1926, and later went on foreign tour, and on tour of provincial theatres in the USSR. Tretyakov also wrote the controversial \"I Want a Baby\" (\"I Want a Child\") (1926), which has seen recent performances in Europe and America. The play advocated selective breeding for the purposes of political (not racial) purity. Meyerhold immediately accepted it for production, but then spent four years battling with the censorship to get it put on stage. Between 1930 and 1931 Tretyakov travelled in Germany, Denmark, and Austria. Before he fell foul of the authorities he translated and popularised other European writers such as Bertolt Brecht. Brecht was also familiar with Tretyakov's literary work and indeed stayed with him in 1935. Tretyakov contributed song lyrics to the film \"Pesn' o geroyakh\" (Song of Heroes) by Joris Ivens set in music by Hanns Eisler.\n\nTretyakov was arrested on July 25, 1937 and charged with espionage. He had fallen under suspicion because of his contacts with foreign writers, and because the political attitudes he had expressed in the 1920s were no longer tolerated. His play \"I Want a Baby\" was denounced in \"Pravda\" in December 1937 as \"a hostile slur on the soviet family.\" He was sentenced to death on September 10, 1937, though in the introduction to the English publication of \"I Want a Baby\", Robert Leach says it seems that in a last act of defiance he threw himself to his death down the stairwell at Butyrka prison. It was standard procedure for those sentenced to death to be photographed prior to execution: the last photograph of Tretyakov, staring defiantly at the camera, is reproduced in David King, \"Ordinary Lives.\" Tretyakov was posthumously rehabilitated in 1956.\n\n\nTretyakov worked with:\n\nBy S.M Tretyakov:\n\nOther notable performances:\n\n\n"}

It was released on August 27, 1996, as one of the first R&B records on Sean Combs' Bad Boy label. The majority of the album was produced primarily by Combs, Tim & Bob and one of the first Hitmen, Stevie J. It also included contributions from group member Daron Jones, Al B Sure!, Kyle West, Arnold Hennings and Boyz II Men vocalist Wanya Morris. The album features label mates the late The Notorious B.I.G., Mase and Faith Evans. Three singles were released from the album: \"Only You\", \"Come See Me\" and \"Cupid\". All of the singles had music videos released.\n\nOriginally known as Forte while in high school and still in their teens, the quartet enlisted the professional management services of Courtney Sills and Kevin Wales. Named after the Atlanta-based club \"112\", the group performed there in front of singers Faith Evans and Usher along with Bad Boy founder Sean Combs. After their performance, the group became the second R&B act signed to Bad Boy behind Faith Evans, who – along with producer Chucky Thompson – recommended Combs to sign them.\n\nAccording to 112 member and producer Daron Jones, the group Boyz II Men was a primary influence on their debut. The reason for their influence was due to them accepting several songs produced by Tim Kelley & Bob Robinson that were initially planned for inclusion on Boyz II Men's second album \"II\". Producer Bob Robinson revealed that Boyz II Men wanted Tim & Bob to produce the majority of \"II\", but Motown Records president Jheryl Busby felt uncomfortable with unknown producers helming a project by a group that was the biggest act in the world at the time. Busby then sought out productions from more established names and as a result, Kelley & Robinson's songs – notably \"Now That We're Done\" and \"Can I Touch You\" – were later given to 112 for their album. Jones felt inconfident about his lead vocals while recording \"Now That We're Done\" and was surprised at the reaction to his performance. Singer Brandy – who was there with the song's co-writer Wanya Morris – caught Jones off-guard when she asked him to teach her how to do the riffs and runs she heard from him.\n\nProducer Stevie J was brought into the project fresh off from his touring with Jodeci and appearing on their 1995 album \"The Show, The After Party, The Hotel\". Stevie served as a mentor to Jones, who expressed a desire to become a songwriter and producer. The first single from \"112\" - \"Only You\" - was hated by the group because of the restrained vocals, which they felt wasn't the best song to showcase their singing. According to Jones, they initially wanted \"Now That We're Done\" released as the first single and the only thing that made them like \"Only You\" was the remix - which was also included on the album. They quickly dismissed the song and felt it wasn't going to be successful. The song about which they were indifferent became a breakout hit for them.\nAnother single \"Cupid\" was primarily inspired by Babyface. The group wanted the songwriter/producer to work on their debut, but financial issues and budget constraints prevented him from working on the album. Jones then felt he could write a \"Babyface\" type of song and later worked with Dallas Austin protégé Arnold Hennings on producing it. Al B. Sure! and Dave Hollister were called in to work on the album as well. While none of Hollister's songs made the final track listing, one of Sure!'s contributions \"Erase The Day\" was left off while his other contribution \"This Is Your Day\" was included on the album. The group started recording in February 1995 and finished the album in January 1996.\n\nLeo Stanley of Allmusic gave the album 4 out of 5 stars stating that \"as the first romantic soul group on Puff Daddy's Bad Boy label, 112 at least has the appearance of originality. However, their eponymous debut demonstrates that this is only an appearance - in reality, they are much like a Boyz II Men clone. That's not necessarily bad, actually. 112 have strong voices, and their smooth harmonies are quite seductive, making the lack of originality in their music easy to overlook. A little more variety on 112 would have been nice—the album consists almost entirely of ballads—but the group's sound and Puffy's professional production make it a pleasurable record nevertheless.\"\n\nSongwriting credits and track listing adapted from liner notes.\n\nNotes\n\nSample credits\n\nAdapted from the album's liner notes.\n"}

The band achieved popular success in 2004 with the release of their debut album, \"The Caitiff Choir\". After frontman Nicholas Brooks departed in 2006, just after the release of the band's sophomore effort \"Sirens\", It Dies Today released \"Lividity\" in 2009 before going on an indefinite hiatus in 2010.. The band reunited briefly for a show in 2012. \n\nIt Dies Today was formed in August 2001 in Buffalo, New York and was originally composed of vocalist Nicholas Brooks, guitarist Chris Cappelli, and guitarist Steve Lemke (who now plays bass). During their formation, most of the band members were only 16 years old. Their initial release was a three-track demo titled \"Let the Angels Whisper Your Name\", recorded in late 2001. The following year, It Dies Today released an EP titled \"Forever Scorned\", which led to the band touring the U.S. with artists such as Between the Buried and Me and Alexisonfire.\n\nIn 2003, Lemke switched to bass as guitarist Mike Hatalak joined. Prior to joining It Dies Today, Hatalak played in bands called Short of Breath, Plain of Ashes, and Stricture. The group eventually signed with Trustkill Records, home to hardcore heavyweights such as Throwdown, Eighteen Visions, and Bleeding Through.\n\nFall 2004 brought about the release of the band's debut full-length \"The Caitiff Choir\". The album sold over 25,000 copies within four months and allowed the band to sell out two national headlining tours with support from Twelve Tribes, Anterrabae, Trivium and others. Alternative Press named them a \"Band To Know\" in 2005. The album has sold 90,000 copies to date.\n\nIn 2005, It Dies Today went on a series of whirlwind tours including tours supporting Bleeding Through, Walls of Jericho, All That Remains, and Throwdown, as well as appearing on the PETA-sponsored \"Compassion Over Fashion\" tour with Most Precious Blood and Remembering Never. The group also supported metal bands such as God Forbid, Machine Head and The Haunted, as well as securing a spot on the coveted Ozzfest second-stage in the summer of 2005. The following summer, the band was scheduled to take part in the Van's Warped Tour but had to cancel due to a vocal injury sustained by Brooks.\n\nIt Dies Today spent 2006 writing and recording their follow-up album with producers Gggarth and Ben Kaplan. Co-producing were vocalist Nick Brooks and guitarist Mike Hatalak, who owns DWS Studios in Niagara Falls, New York.\n\nOn October 17, 2006, It Dies Today released \"Sirens\", which was followed by a U.S. tour. A song from the album, \"Sacred Heart (Sacre Coeur)\" was featured in the 2009 film \"Jennifer's Body\", while another song, \"Sixth of June\", was featured on the \"\". On January 17, 2007 it was announced that Brooks had left the band and that his replacement would be Jason Wood, whom they met while on tour with Still Remains. Before joining It Dies Today, Jason, a Grand Rapids, Michigan native, was the vocalist for the metal outfits Kamilla and The Orphan. Later that year, the band played Warped Tour alongside Still Remains, Throwdown, Poison the Well, As I Lay Dying, and Parkway Drive, among others.\n\nIt Dies Today spent the latter half of 2007 working on their third album, breaking in early 2008 for a small tour before getting back to work for the remainder of the year. After several delays in recording, as well as push-backs by Trustkill Records, the new album \"Lividity\" was released on September 15, 2009.\n\nOn August 13, 2009, it was announced that the band would be playing at Australia's Soundwave Festival in 2010. The band then played at the Mountain Metal Mayhem Festival in Berlin, NH on August 14, 2010 with Within The Ruins, Bloodlined Calligraphy, Threat Signal, Thy Will Be Done, Unearth, and local support. In September 2010, former vocalist Nick Brooks and current It Dies Today guitarist Mike Hatalak formed a new hardcore band called The March. They have since recorded and posted demos on the band's MySpace page.\n\nRumors of a break-up began to spread due the lack of updates, but in December 2010 drummer Nicholas Mirusso posted on the band's Facebook account, \"We are currently on an indefinite hiatus. No promising news to give at the moment, other than we've all been submerged into the \"real\" world.\" Their Facebook account also uploaded two unreleased tracks entitled “Pee Wee…Listen To Reason” and a cover of Alice In Chains' “Them Bones” in October 2011.\n\nOn November 23, 2011 the band announced a reunion show with original vocalist Nicholas Brooks. Days after the performance on January 28, 2012, guitarist Mike Hatalak publicly stated that It Dies Today was no longer a band, but less than a month later, the statement would be retracted when the band stated that their new EP would be out on December 12, 2012. Someone from the band said, \"Yes, patience, please. We are no longer in our early twenties living at our parents' house. We have jobs, responsibilities, and new families we've created. We're not bound by a label, so true fans will appreciate the time we're investing in this.\" However, the planned EP never came to fruition.\n\nOn January 19, 2014, a video featuring a new recording, presumably by Mike Hatalak, was posted on the band's Facebook page. The full demo of the recording, titled \"Son of Dawn, Brilliant Star\", was later released on Lambgoat.com on April 29, 2014, with the band also announcing a set of shows in September to celebrate the 10 year anniversary of the release of \"The Caitiff Choir\" on the same day. This is the first track to feature Nicholas Brooks since the release of \"Sirens\" eight years prior, marking a return to the original lineup for the band. In response to his return, Brooks commented, \"I honestly could not be happier to have the opportunity to not only play shows with these dudes again but to write and record a new album with them as well.\" However, on February 13, 2015, Nicholas Brooks announced that due to a \"severe case of writer's block and family life\", the potential album effort had been postponed indefinitely.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

In the modern era, the typical interpretation for men is black tie for evening wear and black lounge suit for day wear, corresponded by evening dress or cocktail dress for women.\n\nWhether one would choose to wear morning or evening semi-formal has traditionally been defined by whether the event will commence before or after 6:00 p.m.\n\nIn addition, equivalent versions may be permitted of semi-formally applicable ceremonial dresses (including court dresses, diplomatic uniforms and academic dresses), full dress uniforms, religious clothing, and national costumes, and military mess dresses.\n\nFor evening wear (after 6 p.m.), the code is black tie. In formal evening dress, or white tie dress, this practice of substituting colors in ties is much less common since men's fashion tends to follow tradition more deeply as it becomes more formal.\n\nThe origins of evening semi-formal attire date back to the later 19th century when Edward, Prince of Wales (subsequently Edward VII), wanted a more comfortable dinner attire than the swallowtail coat.\n\nIn spring 1886, the Prince invited James Potter, a rich New Yorker, and his wife Cora to Sandringham House, the Prince's hunting estate in Norfolk. When Potter asked for the Prince's dinner dress code, the Prince sent him to his tailor, Henry Poole & Co., in London, where he was given a suit made to the Prince's specifications with the dinner jacket.\n\nOn returning to Tuxedo Park, New York, in 1886, Potter's dinner suit proved popular at the Tuxedo Park Club. Not long afterward, when a group of men from the club chose to wear such suits to a dinner at Delmonico's Restaurant in New York City, other diners were surprised. They were told that such clothing was popular at Tuxedo Park, so the particular cut then became known as the \"tuxedo\".\n\nFrom its creation into the 1920s, this dinner jacket was considered appropriate dress for dining in one's home or club, while the tailcoat remained in place as appropriate for public appearance.\n\nEtiquette and clothing experts continue to discourage wearing of black tie as too formal for weddings, or indeed any event before 6 p.m., such as by Emily Post (1872-1960) and Amy Vanderbilt (1908-1974), the latter arguing that \"no man should ever be caught in a church in a tuxedo\".\n\nFor formal dining, uniformed services officers and non-commissioned officers often wear mess dress equivalents to the civilian black tie and evening dress. Mess uniforms may vary according to the wearers' respective branches of the armed services, regiments, or corps, but usually include a short Eton-style coat reaching to the waist. Some include white shirts, black bow ties, and low-cut waistcoats, while others feature high collars that fasten around the neck and corresponding high-gorge waistcoats. Some nations' armed services have black tie and white tie equivalent variants in their mess dress.\n\nIn tropical areas, primarily in Western diplomatic and expatriate communities, Red Sea rig is sometimes worn, in which the jacket and waistcoat are omitted and a red cummerbund and trousers with red piping are worn instead.\n\n"}

Alexandrina left many written works, which have been studied mainly in Italy by Father Umberto Pasquale. On 25 April 2004 she was declared blessed by Pope John Paul II who stated that \"\"her secret to holiness was love for Christ\"\".\n\nAlexandrina Maria da Costa was born on 30 March 1904, in Balazar, a rural parish of Póvoa de Varzim, Portugal. Her father abandoned the family when she was very young. She had only eighteen months' schooling before being sent to work on a farm at the age of nine. In her teens she started to work in Balazar as a seamstress along with her sister.\n\nAlexandrina said that when she went with other girls to the countryside, she picked flowers that she later used to make flower carpets to the Church of Our Lady of Sorrows in Póvoa de Varzim. One day, she started bleeding from her head, due to a crown of spines, she said. Jesus spoke to her and called her \"Alexandrina das Dores\" (Alexandrina of Sorrows).\n\nAt 14 years old, in March 1918 an incident changed her life. Her former employer along with two other men tried to break into her room. To escape them, Alexandrina jumped 13 feet down from a window, barely surviving. Her spine was broken from the fall. Until age 19, Alexandrina was still able to \"drag herself\" to church where, hunched over, she would remain in prayer, to the great amazement of the parishioners. During the early years, Alexandrina asked the Blessed Mother for the grace of a cure. She suffered gradual paralysis that confined her to bed from 1925 onward. She remained bed-ridden for about 30 years.\n\nThe parish priest lent her a statue of the Immaculate Heart of Mary for the month of May. She asked for a little altar to be fixed to the wall by her bed where it was graced with the statue of Our Lady of Fatima and decorated with flowers and candles.\n\nIn June 1938, based on the request of Alexandrina's confessor, Father Mariano Pinho SJ, several bishops from Portugal wrote to Pope Pius XI, asking him to consecrate the world to the Immaculate Heart of Mary.\n\nThis request was renewed several times until 1941, in which the Holy See asked three times more information about Alexandrina to the Archbishop of Braga. At that time, Cardinal Eugenio Pacelli (later Pope Pius XII) was the secretary of the state of the Vatican, and he later performed the consecration of the world. The Holy See recognized the relation of Alexandrina Maria da Costa with the act of the World Consecration to the Immaculate Heart of Mary in an article about her life and virtues.\n\nAfter December 1938, she corresponded regularly with Sister Lucia.\nAccording to her Vatican biography, from March 1942, for about 13 years until her death, she received no food except for the Holy Eucharist, and her weight dropped to about 33 kilograms (i.e. approximately 73 pounds). She was examined by medical doctors, with no conclusion.\n\nBased on the advice of a priest, her sister kept a diary of Alexandrina's words and mystical experiences. According to her Vatican autobiography Jesus spoke to her, at one point saying: \"You will very rarely receive consolation... I want that while your heart is filled with suffering, on your lips there is a smile\". In 1944, she joined the \"Union of Salesian Cooperators\", offering her suffering for the salvation of souls and for the sanctification of youth.\n\nUmberto Pasquale (1906 - 1985) was a Salesian priest and writer. At the beginning of the 1930s, he went to Portugal and in 1944 he met Alexandrina Maria da Costa, the main subject of his books.\n\nBased on her request, the following words were written on her tombstone:\n\nIn Ireland there is an Alexandrina Society that spreads knowledge of her life and teachings. The aims of the Society are 1) To spread devotion to Alexandrina and make her known, 2) To pray for the conversion of sinners, 3) To pray for Priests and acknowledge any favours received, 4) To pray for members' intentions.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2226759", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2226759", "title": "Volkswagen Group B platform", "text": "Volkswagen Group B platform\n\nThe Volkswagen Group B platform is a mid-size automobile platform from the Volkswagen Group. It has been used for saloon cars/sedans, estate cars/station wagon, and coupés - under the Volkswagen Passenger Cars, Audi, SEAT and Škoda marques over the years.\nMore recently, Volkswagen Group have introduced a new alphanumeric nomenclature for car platforms. The platform code is composed as follows:\n\n\nAn additional + suffix indicates a long-wheelbase variant.\n19741988. An Audi derived platform, the first Volkswagen Passat was nearly identical to the Audi 80 (Audi Fox in US), sharing much of its mechanical systems, including its longitudinal engine placement.\n\n\n19801996. The BX platform, developed by Volkswagen's Brazilian subsidiary (Volkswagen do Brasil), again borrowed heavily from the Audi 80 (Fox/4000) of the day. The BX platform was used for the Brazilian Volkswagen Gol (hatchback), Voyage (sedan, also sold as the Gacel or Senda in Argentina, Fox in the US, or Amazon in some other markets), Parati (3-door wagon/estate), Saveiro (pickup) and Furgão (van) models. The BX platform was quite unique in that it started life with a four-cylinder Volkswagen air-cooled engine (borrowed from the Volkswagen Beetle), and eventually ended up with a more modern water-cooled engine, being sold in the US for the first time as a 1987 model. The VW BX family was restyled in 1987 and 1991.\n\nStill an Audi derived platform, this time based on the Audi 80/4000, again, including its longitudinal engine placement and, on some European models, the quattro four-wheel drive system, rebranded Syncro for Volkswagen cars. The Santana (facelifted) was produced until 2012 in China.\n\n\nThe B3 Volkswagen Passat was the first B platform car to be called Passat in the United States. The B3 was also the first Passat with an independently designed platform: it did not share parts with Audi models. Instead, the design borrowed heavily from the Volkswagen Group A2 platform, being essentially a stretched version of it, and sharing the same transverse engine layout.\n\n\nThe Volkswagen Corrado was an A2 platform car, but it borrowed heavily from the B3 Passat platform for ancillary components (the VR6 version borrowed some suspension components from the A3 platform too).\n\nThe \"B3\" designation is also used to refer to the \"\"Typ\" 89\" version of the Audi 80/90 produced from 1987 to 1992 and the \"\"Typ\" 8B\" Audi Coupé and S2. However these are \"not\" based on the same platform as the B3 Passat, being longitudinally engined cars, and that platform should be considered the \"true\" B3, being the B-class platform historically longitudinally engined and primarily developed by Audi rather than Volkswagen. \n\nThe B4 Passat was a face lifted B3 (receiving its own generation number is controversial), remaining nearly mechanically identical, but with entirely new sheetmetal, and an updated interior design.\n\n\nThe \"B4\" designation is also used to refer to the \"\"Typ\" 8C\" version of the Audi 80 and RS2 produced from 1991 to 1994. However these are \"not\" based on the same platform as the B4 Passat. These are developed from the longitudinal B3 platform too, with some modifications such as an extended rear overhang, longer wheelbase, redesigned suspension and fuel tank.\n\nThe B5 platform employs a longitudinal engine placement, which differs from the Volkswagen Group A platform which have been traditionally transversely mounted. This platform (also known as PL45 under the new VAG scheme) was introduced with the first-generation Audi A4 and the 1996 Volkswagen Passat. B5 platform cars can be equipped with a multilink front suspension and a Torsen centre differential for quattro or 4motion branded four-wheel drive systems. A long-wheelbase derivative of this platform - originally designed for the Chinese market and being used in the 1999 Volkswagen Passat Lingyu, but ultimately being used for its rebadged version under the Škoda brand, the 2002 Škoda Superb - is referred to as PL45+.\n\nIn late 2000, the B5 Passat received a facelift, referred to as \"B5.5\".\n\n\n\nThe designation \"B6\" is used to identify the \"\"Typ\" 8E\" Audi A4/S4 produced from late 2000 to 2005. The platform used by these models is formally known as the PL46 platform.\n\nConfusingly, the historical generation of Volkswagen's Passat are also colloquially referred to as \"B6\", given that they are Volkswagen's sixth generation mid-sized saloon. However this generation of the Passat uses the PQ46 platform, a stretched version of the transverse engined Golf Mk5 and Jetta Mk5's PQ35 platform, also known as A6 to distinguish it from the \"true\" B6 platform.\n\n\n\nThe Audi A4, S4 and RS4 has a \"B7\" generation, from 2005 to 2008. However, this seventh generation of the car was a minor revision of the PL46 platform, but with major revisions to engine ranges, suspension revisions, updated chassis and consumer electronics, and restyled bodywork. The B7 A4/S4 retains the \"Typ\" 8E/8H numbers of the B6 A4/S4, though with different suffixes, while the SEAT Exeo though it has derived from the Audi A4 B7 takes the \"Typ\" 3R number.\n\n\nThe MLB (\"Modularer Längsbaukasten\" in German) or MLP (Modular Longitudinal Platform) component matrix is used in the B8 (A4, A5, Q5), C7 (A6, A7, Q7) and D4 (A8) families of Audi vehicles. This is noteworthy for placing the front differential ahead of the clutch, allowing the front axle to be moved forward 4 inches. This results in an increase in wheelbase and a slightly more rearward weight distribution for better vehicle dynamics.\n\n\n"}

The eighty-eight players played eight games on each of the first three days, in a Swiss tournament. As usual, the top two players then competed in a best-of-five final to decide who would become world champion.\n\nAfter the Swiss tournament, the top two players were Brian Cappelletto representing the United States, with 18 wins and winning spread of +921, and Joel Wapnick, defending champion from 1999, with 17 wins and winning spread +1006. These two players thus contested the final.\n\nIn the first game of the final, Wapnick played first. Both players began by changing tiles, then exchanged straightforward bingos (ANALYSE and IRATELY respectively). Further highlights included Wapnick's WHEEP and BAJU and Cappelletto's INDUSIA. In the final move, trailing 482-464 and with only the O remaining on his rack, Cappelletto needed to score 16 points to force a draw. Unfortunately for him, there was no such move available and, while he played the best available move (ZO for 13), Wapnick took the game 482-479.\n\nThe second game was less high-scoring, with only two bonuses; Wapnick's DRESSING and CONDOLER. Despite this, Cappelletto won the game 410-372 to level the match at 1-1.\n\nIn the third game, Wapnick began the game with a bonus (LOURINg for 64), but Cappelletto won a claustrophobic game 400-352, and lead the match 2-1.

Since 1921, the stadium has been the home of Torquay United Football Club, who currently compete in the National League, the fifth tier of English football. During the first half of the 2018-19 National League South season, the stadium also hosted Truro City games.\n\nAt the time of Torquay United's formation in 1899, Plainmoor was the home of Torquay Athletic Rugby Football Club. In 1904, the rugby club secured the lease of the Recreation Ground, where United had been playing, and United's Torquay and District League rivals Ellacombe moved into the vacated site at Plainmoor, leaving United homeless.\n\nIn 1910 United merged with Ellacombe to become Torquay Town. Ellacombe’s Plainmoor ground became the home of the new club, and the shared home of local rivals Babbacombe.\n\nTorquay Town and Babbacombe finally merged and became Torquay United (again) in 1921. In 1927 United were elected into Division Three South of the Football League.\n\nA new wooden grandstand costing £150 (around £8,958.33 today) was erected for United’s inaugural season in the Football League; it had previously stood at Buckfastleigh Racecourse, where its twin can still be seen today. The roof of the stand was blown off during a gale in 1930.\n\nVery little changed for the next fifty years as the ground saw generations of supporters move through its turnstiles. During the 1954/55 season over 21,000 fans watched Torquay’s 0-1 defeat at the hands of Huddersfield Town. The same season also saw United become one of the first lower division clubs to introduce floodlights to their ground.\n\nDavid Webb came to Plainmoor in 1984 and prompted a few cosmetic changes to the terracing. Then on 16 May 1985, just six days after the Bradford City stadium fire, a third of the old grandstand was destroyed during an early morning blaze. Nobody was hurt, but as a result, the ground’s capacity fell to below 5,000. In the few years after the fire the ground saw little change. At one point the manager’s office and changing rooms were situated in a couple of portable cabins behind the old Mini Stand.\n\nDuring the late 1980s and throughout the 1990s, Plainmoor has finally seen some major changes. The old Mini Stand made way for the all-seating Family Stand, which also houses offices, the boardroom and the club shop, as well as the pub and restaurant Boots and Laces, and the 200 Club bar.\n\nThe Cowshed, made out of corrugated iron and wood, was replaced at the Ellacombe end of the ground by the old mini-stand, while a TV gantry sits on top of the popular side stand. Also, in time for the beginning of the 2000/01 season, the new Sparkworld Stand was opened to accommodate away fans.\n\nThe main stand that was originally from Buckfastleigh Racecourse was demolished in the autumn of 2011 and accordingly the ground capacity was reduced. A new stand filling the complete length of the pitch, unlike the previous stand, was erected during the 2011-2012 season and opened in August 2012, in time for the start of the following season. It was named Bristow's Bench after the late former director, Paul Bristow who so generously supported the club after a lottery win. In December 2012 a big screen was installed between the popular side and the away end.\n\nOn 15 September 2014, Torquay United announced a four-year deal with local company Launa Windows to rename Plainmoor to 'The Launa Windows Stadium', presumably in an effort to increase revenue.\n\nThe land is still owned by the local council, talks about the club purchasing the ground have taken place on several occasions in the past.\n\nIn the not too distant past there was some talk of re-location, Mike Bateson believed that would only happen if:\n\n\nAfter ownership of Torquay United was transferred to Gaming International under the company name Riviera Stadium Limited, talks with Torbay Council have re-opened about the purchase of Plainmoor and developing the ground into housing.\n\n"}

{"id": "2226815", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2226815", "title": "Sampradaya", "text": "Sampradaya\n\nIn Hinduism, a sampradaya ( Sanskrit : सम्प्रदाय IAST \"\") can be translated as ‘tradition’, 'spiritual lineage' or a ‘religious system’. It relates to a succession of masters and disciples, which serves as a spiritual channel, and provides a delicate network of relationships that lends stability to a religious identity.\nThe word \"identity\" in this respect is problematic. Where \"identity\" can be seen as static, \"sampradaya\" allows flexibility; one can leave one \"sampradaya\" and enter another.\n\n\"Sampradaya\" is a body of practice, views and attitudes, which are transmitted, redefined and reviewed by each successive generation of followers. Participation in \"sampradaya\" forces continuity with the past, or tradition, but at the same time provides a platform for change from within the community of practitioners of this particular traditional group.\n\nA particular guru lineage in guru-shishya tradition is called \"parampara\", and may have its own akharas and gurukulas. By receiving diksha (initiation) into the \"parampara\" of a living guru, one belongs to its proper \"sampradaya\". One cannot become a member by birth, as is the case with \"gotra\", a seminal, or hereditary, dynasty.\n\nMembership in a \"sampradaya\" not only lends a level of authority to one’s claims on truth in Hindu traditional context, but also allows one to make those claims in the first place. An often quoted verse from the Padma Purana states:\nAnd another verse states:\nAs Wright and Wright put it, \nNevertheless, there are also examples of teachers who were not initiated into a sampradaya, Ramana Maharshi being a well-known example. A sannyasin belonging to the Sringeri Sharada Peetham once tried to persuade Ramana to be initiated into sannyasa, but Ramana refused.\n\nAccording to the Padma Purāṇa, one of the eighteen main Purāṇas, there are four Vaishnava \"sampradāyas\", which preserve the fruitful mantras:\nEach of them were inaugurated by a deity, who appointed heads to these lineages:\n\nDuring the Kali yuga these sampradāyas appear in the holy place of Jaganatha Puri, and purify the entire earth.\n\nVarious sampradāyas emerged from these four, which are quite different from them. There are also other sampradāyas, such as Swaminarayan Sampradaya, which are not linked to these four sampradaayas.\n\nThe lineage of Sri Bramha Madhava Gaudiya Sampradāya founded by Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu falls under the lineage of Bramha sampradaaya.\n\nThere are three main saivite sampradayas known as \"Kailasa Parampara\" (Lineage from Kailash)- Nandinatha Sampradaya, Adinath Sampradaya and Meykanda Sampradaya.\n\nIn Balinese Hinduism, Dutch ethnographers further subdivided Siwa (shaivaites) into five – Kemenuh, Keniten, Mas, Manuba and Petapan. This classification was to accommodate the observed marriage between higher caste Brahmana men with lower caste women.\n\nThe Nandinatha Sampradaya traces its beginning to at least 200 BCE. Its founder and first known spiritual preceptor was the Maha Rishi Nandinatha. Nandinatha is said to have initiated eight disciples (Sanatkumar, Sanakar, Sanadanar, Sananthanar, Shivayogamuni, Patanjali, Vyaghrapada, and Tirumular) and sent them to various places to spread the teachings of non-dualistic Shaivism all over the world. Saiva Siddhanta Church of Hawaii identifies itself as principle Matha or monestory of lineage . Spiritual lineage of the Nandinatha Sampradaya : Maharishi Nandinath→ Tirumular→→→ unknown→Kadaitswami→ Chellappaswami→ Siva Yogaswami→Sivaya Subramuniyaswami → Bodhinatha Veylanswami\nTamil Shaiva Siddhanta philosophy is known as the descedent from the teaching of Sanatkumara, one of the Kumaras.(Sanatkumara→Satyanjana Darshini→Paranjyoti rishi→Meykandar.\n\nNandinatha and Meykandar Sampradayas are associated with the Shaiva Siddhanta while Adinath Sampradaya is associated with Nath Shaivism. Other popular Saivite sampradayas are Veerashaiva Samprdaya, Lingayat Sampradaya and Srouta Sampradaya\n\nDashanami Sampradaya, \"Tradition of Ten Names\", is a Hindu monastic tradition of \"ēkadaṇḍi sannyasins\" (wandering renunciates carrying a single staff) generally associated with the Advaita Vedanta tradition. They are distinct in their practices from the Saiva \"Tridaṇḍi sannyāsin\"s or \"trident renunciates\", who continue to wear the sacred thread after renunciation, while \"ēkadaṇḍi sannyāsin\"s do not.\n\nThe Ekadandi Vedāntins aim for moksha as the existence of the self in its natural condition indicated by the destruction of all its specific qualities. Any Hindu, irrespective of class, caste, age or gender can seek sannyāsa as an Ekadandi monk under the Dasanāmi tradition.\n\nThe Ekadandis or Dasanāmis had established monasteries in India and Nepal in ancient times. After the decline of Buddhism, a section of the Ekadandis were organized by Adi Shankara in the 8th century in India to be associated with four \"maṭha\"s to provide a base for the growth of Hinduism. However, the association of the Dasanāmis with the Sankara \"maṭha\"s remained nominal.\n\nAdi Sankara founded four (Sanskrit: ) (monasteries) to preserve and develop his philosophies. One each in the north, south, east and west of the Indian subcontinent, each headed by one of his direct disciples.\n\nAccording to Nakamura, these mathas contributed to the influence of Shankara, which was \"due to institutional factors\". The mathas which he built exist until today, and preserve the teachings and influence of Shankara, \"while the writings of other scholars before him came to be forgotten with the passage of time\".\n\nThe table below gives an overview of the four \"Amnaya Mathas\" founded by Adi Shankara, and their details.\n\nThe current heads of the mathas trace their authority back to these figures, and each of the heads of these four mathas takes the title of Shankaracharya (\"the learned Shankara\") after Adi Sankara.\n\nAccording to the tradition in Kerala, after Sankara's \"samadhi\" at Vadakkunnathan Temple, his disciples founded four mathas in Thrissur, namely Naduvil Madhom, Thekke Madhom, Idayil Madhom and Vadakke Madhom.\n\nThere are 2 Shakta Sampradayas, which are\n1. Kalikula : Prevalent in Bengal, Assam, Nepal & Odisha. Primary deity is Kali\n2. Srikula : Prevalent in Tamil Nadu, Andhra, Telengana, Karnataka, Kerala & Sri Lanka. Primary deity is Lalita Devi\n\nBuda sampradaya or Buddha sampradaya is a classification based on the observance of Dutch ethnographers of Brahmana caste of Balinese Hinduism into two: Siwa and Buda. The other castes were similarly further sub-classified by these 19th-century and early-20th-century ethnographers based on numerous criteria ranging from profession, endogamy or exogamy or polygamy, and a host of other factors in a manner similar to \"castas\" in Spanish colonies such as Mexico, and caste system studies in British colonies such as India. This concept of Budha Sampradaya could be applied to all Buddhist communities.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2226817", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2226817", "title": "List of Married... with Children episodes", "text": "List of Married... with Children episodes\n\nThe Fox sitcom \"Married... with Children\" aired its pilot on April 5, 1987, and its series finale aired on May 5, 1997, with the episode \"The Desperate Half-Hour (Part 1)\" and \"How to Marry a Moron (Part 2)\". A total of 259 original episodes aired during the program's run. Currently, all 11 seasons are available on DVD, in Region 1. The list is ordered by the episodes' original air dates. Specials that aired during a regular season run are highlighted in yellow in the list. A season 3 episode, \"I'll See You in Court\", is known as the \"lost episode\" and did not air in North America until June 18, 2002, five years after the series' original run.\n\n<onlyinclude></onlyinclude>\n\nThe first season of \"Married... with Children\" introduces the major characters: Al, Peg, Kelly and Bud Bundy, along with their neighbors, Steve and Marcy Rhoades. The first season is the only one in which Al and Peg are regularly intimate, to the point of Al initiating the sessions. It is also the only one where Peg can be seen doing housework under normal circumstances (despite being bad at it), and she even has her own car, a red Ford Mustang (as seen in \"Sixteen Years and What Do You Get\"). In \"Thinergy,\" Bud mentions that Kelly had been held back a year in school. Al's dislike of the French is first shown in this season and it is also the first time that he calls Marcy a \"chicken.\" It also contains the first mention of Peg's family being \"hillbillies\" from the fictional Wanker County, Wisconsin.\n\nAt the beginning of the second season, Kelly is portrayed as a girl of reasonable intelligence (though she is often teased by Bud for her promiscuity and bleached hair). By the end, however, her character obtains her trademark stupidity that will become both a plot device and comic focus for the rest of the series. This season also contains the first use of the \"Bundy Cheer\" and the first instance of the Bundys leaving Chicago. Additionally, it marked the beginning of the \"Thank your father, kids\" running gag. Although Buck is portrayed in later seasons as having been with the Bundys since he was a pup, Peg implies that they have had him for only three years and Al states that he is actually Bud's pet; he even \"speaks\" once (\"Buck Can Do It\"), something that becomes a regular feature beginning in the fourth season. Michael Faustino (David's younger brother) makes the first of five guest appearances during the course of the series.\n\nThe third season marks a notable increase in the show's popularity, based on Terry Rakolta's morality campaign against the show, which began after the episode \"Her Cups Runneth Over\", where Al and Steve go to a lingerie store in search of Peggy's favorite bra (which had been discontinued). This season also contains the \"lost episode\" \"I'll See You in Court\", which was not aired in North America until June 18, 2002, after the show's initial run on the cable channel FX (and was included in the season-three DVD set). Michael Faustino makes his second guest appearance. During the season, the show became the first to have a quarter of the viewership on Fox.\n\nThe fourth season had the departure of Marcy's husband Steve Rhoades. Marcy remained single for the remainder of the season. This was also the first season where the audience would applaud when a major character would enter a scene for the first time in the episode, the first time that Buck \"speaks\", and a Bundyesque version of the classic film \"It's a Wonderful Life\". In the episode \"It's a Bundyful Life (Part 2),\" Ted McGinley makes a guest appearance as Norman Jablonsky before reappearing as a regular cast member in the next season as Jefferson D'Arcy. Also, Michael Faustino makes his third guest appearance.\n\nThe fifth season marked the introduction of Jefferson D'Arcy (Ted McGinley), as Marcy's new husband. The series reached its 100th episode this season, which was the pilot for the spin-off \"Top of the Heap\", the first of three spinoffs from \"Married... with Children\". Al's favorite show \"Psycho Dad\" is also first referred to in this season, along with his first mention of scoring four touchdowns in one high school football game.\n\nThroughout the season, both Peg and Marcy were pregnant, as Katey Sagal was pregnant in real life. Sagal's child was stillborn six weeks before term, causing her to miss four episodes of this season. At the end of the season's 11th episode,\n\"Al Bundy, Shoe Dick\", the women's pregnancies were revealed to be merely part of one of Al's nightmares. This season also had Steve Rhoades return for one episode, Kelly becoming the \"Verminator\", and the Bundys traveling to England. Additionally, this season introduced Bud's hip hop-inspired alter ego \"Grandmaster B\", concocted to help him with women, which continued after the dream revelation by having Al ask Bud about the nickname and Bud deciding that he likes it enough to use it.\n\nIn the seventh season, the writers introduced Seven (played by Shane Sweet) in an attempt to give the Bundys a third child. When the audience was unreceptive, he was removed from the series with no explanation other than being left at the D'Arcys' (Seven was last seen being told a bedtime story in \"Peggy and the Pirates\"). However, a subtle reference to him is made in season eight, episode 22, when he appears as the missing child on a carton of milk. Bud also loses his virginity during this season and he makes his first appearance with a beard (which was mistaken for dirt in the episode where Bud first notices he is growing a beard). Steve Rhoades also makes another guest appearance during this season, as do Dan Castellaneta and Michael Faustino.\n\nThe eighth season introduces many of Al's friends, including Aaron, Bob Rooney, and Officer Dan (though Officer Dan was not a character in the earlier seasons, the actor who played him also appeared in \"Rock 'n Roll Girl\" as the sheriff who issued Al a ticket for an insulting bumper sticker, \"Weenie Tot Lovers and Other Strangers\" as the police officer who arrested Al, and \"The Egg and I\" as the FBI agent searching for Steve). Al, Jefferson, Bob Rooney, and Officer Dan (along with Griff and Ike, who are introduced in season nine) all become members of NO MA'AM in the episode where the men fight back against a talk show host (played by Jerry Springer) known as \"The Masculine Feminist\". This is also the season where Bud joins a fraternity. The closest to an explanation for Seven's mysterious disappearance 14 months before is in the episode \"Ride Scare\", where a closeup on a carton of milk reveals a picture of Seven with the word \"Missing\". Al's plus-sized model friends simply look at it without comment before helping themselves.\n\nThe ninth season rounds out the cast of Al's friends by introducing Griff, who works at Gary's Shoes with Al, and Ike. Steve Rhoades also makes his final two appearances during this season. The season also includes the cancellation of \"Psycho Dad\", Bud getting a job as a driving examiner, and the first appearances of shoe-store owner Gary (who turns out to be a woman), Marcy's niece Amber (who was introduced as a foil for Bud, before being dropped from the show after a couple of episodes), and reporter Miranda Veracruz De La Hoya Cardinal. Michael Faustino makes his fifth and final guest appearance.\n\nThe tenth season had the death of family pet Buck and his subsequent reincarnation into the body of Lucky, the Bundys' next dog. The season also marks the first appearances of Peggy's father Ephraim (played by Tim Conway) and Peggy's mother, who moves in with the Bundys (although she is never seen, only heard). Also, Peg leaves Al and goes on a search for her father.\n\nThe 11th season was the final season of \"Married... with Children\". Fox moved the show's time slot several times throughout the course of the season, which cost the show ratings. Rising production costs and decreasing viewer shares led to the show's cancellation in April 1997, after the final taping for season 11. Due to this decision, no official \"final\" episode of \"Married... with Children\" was shown. While \"How to Marry a Moron\" was the final episode to be shot, \"Chicago Shoe Exchange\" was the last episode that Fox broadcast. This was the only season to feature teaser scenes before the opening credits, and a few episodes during this season also featured tag scenes just before the closing credits. For this season, the still of Al and Peggy sitting on the couch was dropped from the closing credits, which for this season are shown against a black background and in a separate card format, instead of scrolling. The opening theme was also greatly shortened, dropping the highway scenes taken from \"National Lampoon's Vacation\", and the scene where Al hands every member of his family money. \n\"Bundymania\" was a three-hour-and-forty-five-minute special airing nine dubbed German episodes of the series. The special included interviews with David Faustino, Christina Applegate, Ted McGinley, dog trainer Steven Ritt, Amanda Bearse, and Ed O'Neill.\n\n A. 'Bootsie' is a pseudonym for J.

{"id": "2226829", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2226829", "title": "Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash (album)", "text": "Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash (album)\n\nCrosby, Stills & Nash is the first album by Crosby, Stills & Nash, released in 1969 on the Atlantic Records label. It spawned two Top 40 hit singles, \"Marrakesh Express\" and \",\" which peaked respectively at #28 the week of August 23, 1969, and at #21 the week of December 6, 1969, on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 singles chart. The album itself peaked at #6 on the \"Billboard\" Top Pop Albums chart. It was certified four times platinum by the RIAA for sales of over 4,200,000.\n\nThe album was a very strong debut for the band, instantly lifting them to stardom. Along with the Byrds' \"Sweetheart of the Rodeo\" and The Band's \"Music from Big Pink\" of the previous year, it helped initiate a sea change in popular music away from the ruling late-1960s aesthetic of bands playing blues-based rock music on loud guitars. \"Crosby, Stills & Nash\" presented a new wrinkle in building upon rock's roots, utilizing folk, blues, and even jazz without specifically sounding like mere duplication. Not only blending voices, the three meshed their differing strengths, David Crosby for social commentary and atmospheric mood pieces, Stephen Stills for his diverse musical skills and for folding folk and country elements subtly into complex rock structures, and Graham Nash for his radio-friendly pop melodies, to create an amalgam of broad appeal. The album features some of their best known songs: \"Helplessly Hoping\"; Crosby's response to the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy \"Long Time Gone\"; Stills' lament for Judy Collins \"\"; and \"Wooden Ships,\" a collaboration between Crosby and Stills as well as Paul Kantner of Jefferson Airplane.\n\nStills dominated the recording of the album. Crosby and Nash played guitar on their own songs respectively, while drummer Dallas Taylor played on four tracks and drummer Jim Gordon on a fifth. Stills played all the bass, organ, and lead guitar parts, as well as acoustic guitar on his own songs. \"The other guys won't be offended when I say that one was my baby, and I kind of had the tracks in my head,\" Stills said. Even with this dominance, Stills does not appear on the tracks \"Guinnevere\" and \"Lady of the Island,\" both featuring Crosby and Nash only and an inadvertent precursor of their partnership on record and stage during the 1970s.\n\nDavid Crosby bristled over the plan for \"Long Time Gone\" as he thought he should at least play rhythm guitar on his own song. Stills convinced him to go home for a while and when he returned Crosby was won over by the music track that Stills and Taylor had recorded. In a more recent interview, Crosby contradicted his earlier statement, stating that he had played guitar on the track. He is so credited in the liner notes to the 1991 box set.\n\nThe group performed songs from the album at the Woodstock Festival in August 1969. In late 1969 the group appeared with Neil Young on the Tom Jones TV show and performed \"Long Time Gone\" with Tom Jones sharing vocals.\n\nThis album proved very influential on many levels to the dominant popular music scene in America for much of the 1970s. The success of the album generated respect for the group within the industry and galvanized interest in signing similar acts, many of whom came under management and representation by the CSN team of Elliot Roberts and David Geffen. Strong sales, combined with the group's emphasis on personal confession in its writing, paved the way for the success of the singer-songwriter movement of the early 1970s. Their utilization of personal events in their material without resorting to subterfuge, their talents in vocal harmony, their cultivation of painstaking studio craft, as well as the Laurel Canyon ethos that surrounded the group and their associates, established an aesthetic for a number of acts that came to define the \"California sound\" of the ensuing decade, including the Eagles, Jackson Browne, post-1974 Fleetwood Mac, and others.\n\nThe album has been issued on compact disc three times: mastered by Barry Diament at Atlantic Studios in the mid-1980s; remastered by Joe Gastwirt at Ocean View Digital and reissued on August 16, 1994; reissued again by Rhino Records as an expanded edition using the HDCD process on January 24, 2006. On December 6, 2011, a gold compact disc edition of the album was released on the Audio Fidelity label.\n\nOn the cover the members are, left to right, Nash, Stills, and Crosby, the reverse of the order of the album title. The photo was taken by their friend and photographer Henry Diltz before they came up with a name for the group. They found an abandoned house with an old, battered sofa outside, located at 815 Palm Avenue, West Hollywood, across from the Santa Palm car wash that they thought would be a perfect fit for their image. A few days later they decided on the name \"Crosby, Stills, and Nash\". To prevent confusion, they went back to the house a day or so later to re-shoot the cover in the correct order, but when they got there they found the house had been reduced to a pile of timber.\n\nDallas Taylor can be seen looking through the window of the door on the rear of the sleeve. In the expanded edition, however, he is absent. The original vinyl LP was released in a gatefold sleeve that depicted the band members in large fur parkas with a sunset in the background on the gatefold (shot in Big Bear, California), as well as the iconic cover art. A long folded page inside displayed the album credits, lyrics, track listing, as well as a quasi-psychedelic pencil drawing.\n\nIn a contemporary review, \"Rolling Stone\" critic Barry Franklin called \"Crosby, Stills & Nash\" \"an eminently playable record\" and \"especially satisfying work\", finding the songwriting and vocal harmonies particularly exceptional. Robert Christgau was less enthusiastic in \"The New York Times\", writing that \"[\"Crosby, Stills & Nash\"] is as perfect as has been expected. But it also demonstrates the dangers of perfection: the wildness that should liberate great rock is so well-controlled that when it appears (as on Nash's excellent 'Pre-Road Downs') it seems to have been inserted just to prove the music is rock: the only exception is Crosby's wailing vocal on 'Long Time Gone.'\" In his capsule-review column for \"The Village Voice\", he jokingly said the vocal saves the album from \"a special castrati award\".\n\nIn a retrospective review, Jason Akeny of AllMusic believed some of the songs' themes \"haven't dated well\" but \"the harmonies are absolutely timeless, and the best material remains rock-solid\". In 2003 and 2012, \"Rolling Stone\" ranked \"Crosby, Stills & Nash\" number 262 on their list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.. It was voted number 83 in Colin Larkin's All Time Top 1000 Albums 3rd Edition (2000).\n\nJefferson Airplane guitarist Paul Kantner was finally credited as co-composer of \"Wooden Ships\" on the expanded edition reissue, something long acknowledged on his group's version of the song from their \"Volunteers\" album, released the same year. David Crosby singing an excerpt of \"Come On in My Kitchen\" between \"Long Time Gone\" and \"49 Bye-Byes\" was left off the 2006 expanded reissue at the request of the late Robert Johnson's estate.\n\n\nProduction\n\nAlbum – \"Billboard\" (United States)\nSingles – \"Billboard\" (United States)\n"}

It is located 65 kilometers from Tegucigalpa. \n\nThe municipality of Yuscarán was founded in 1730. After gold, silver and other precious metals were found in its foothills in 1746, Spanish mining companies flooded the area and Spaniards settled the town. Thus, Yuscarán was constructed in the traditional colonial style of 18th-century Spain.\n\nYears of exploitation by the Spanish and later by North American mining companies followed, bringing both advantages and disadvantages. At its height, Yuscarán was a wealthy mining town and home to some of Honduras's most influential families. It was one of the first places in Honduras to get electricity in 1898 – even before Tegucigalpa. Because of its importance, it was declared the capital of the El Paraíso Department in 1869. However, after the mining stopped, most of the foreigners supporting Yuscarán abandoned the town, taking their money and possessions with them.\n\nIn 1979 Yuscarán was declared a National Monument. In its center there are more than 200 colonial homes.\n\nNatives of Yuscarán include the painter Teresita Fortín.\n\nThe mountain of Montserrat towers over the town to the southeast. This biological reserve is also the main source of water for the area, the same water that the villagers use to produce the Yuscaran-brand sugar cane alcohol aguardiente.\n\nWith the decline of the mining industry came the rise of another industry, from which Yuscarán gets its present-day fame: the fabrication of aguardiente, or guaro. The Yuscarán factory, also called the Distileria del Buen Gusto, was founded in 1939. \n"}

{"id": "2226852", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2226852", "title": "Arne Duncan", "text": "Arne Duncan\n\nArne Starkey Duncan is the former United States Secretary of Education from 2009 through December 2015. While his tenure as Secretary was marked by varying degrees of opposition from both social conservatives and teachers unions, he nevertheless enjoyed strong support from the US president who appointed him, Barack Obama. Conservatives and some parents resisted Duncan's push for all U.S. states to adopt the Common Core Standards to determine what students had learned, and most US teachers unions disliked his emphasis on the use of data from student tests to evaluate teachers and schools. Despite antagonism to the changes Duncan had introduced, Obama praised his work at the Department of Education by saying, \"Arne has done more to bring our educational system – sometimes kicking and screaming – into the 21st century than anybody else.\"\n\nDuncan previously served as CEO of the Chicago Public Schools from 2001 to 2009. He is currently a senior fellow at the University of Chicago Harris School of Public Policy and a board member for Communities In Schools and Community X.\n\nDuncan was raised in Hyde Park, a Chicago neighborhood encompassing the University of Chicago. He is the son of Susan Goodrich (née Morton) and Starkey Davis Duncan Jr. His father was a psychology professor at the university and his mother runs the Sue Duncan Children's Center, an after-school program primarily serving African-American youth in the nearby Kenwood neighborhood.\n\nDuncan attended the University of Chicago Laboratory Schools and later Harvard College, where he played on the basketball team and graduated \"magna cum laude\" in 1987 with a bachelor's degree in sociology. His senior thesis, for which he took a year's leave to do research in the Kenwood neighborhood, was entitled \"The values, aspirations and opportunities of the urban underclass\".\n\nAfter graduating, Duncan played professional basketball for several years until 1991. In 1992, childhood friend and investment banker John W. Rogers, Jr., appointed Duncan director of the Ariel Education Initiative, a program mentoring children at one of the city's worst-performing elementary schools and then assisting them as they proceeded further in the education system. After the school closed in 1996, Duncan and Rogers were instrumental in re-opening it as a charter school, \nAriel Community Academy. In 1999, Duncan was appointed Deputy Chief of Staff for former Chicago Public Schools CEO Paul Vallas.\n\nMayor Richard M. Daley appointed Duncan to serve as Chief Executive Officer of the Chicago Public Schools on June 26, 2001. Opinions vary on Duncan's success as CEO; one prominent publication notes improved test scores and describes Duncan as a consensus builder, while another finds the improvements largely a myth and is troubled by the closing of neighborhood schools and their replacement by charter schools, and what it describes as schools' militarization.\n\nDuncan was appointed U.S. Secretary of Education by President Barack Obama and confirmed by the Senate on January 20, 2009. One of Duncan's initiatives as secretary has been a $4 billion Race to the Top competition. It asks states to vie for federal education dollars by submitting proposals that include reforms such as expanding charter schools and judging teachers partly on how well their students do on standardized tests.\n\nIllinois Senator Dick Durbin condemned the Bush-Kennedy charter schools for Washington, D.C., and Duncan and President Obama got the vouchers eliminated. Speaker of the House Boehner got them restored.\n\nIn March 2011, Duncan said 82 percent of the nation's public schools could be failing by the following year under the standards of the No Child Left Behind law. The projection amounted to a startling spike from previous data, which showed that 37 percent of schools were on track to miss targets set by the law. \"Four out of five schools in America would not meet their goals under [No Child Left Behind] by next year\", Duncan said in his statement.\n\nOn July 4, 2014, the National Education Association, the largest teacher's union in the United States, passed a resolution of \"no confidence\" in Duncan's leadership of the Department of Education and asked for his resignation.\n\nOn July 13, 2014, the American Federation of Teachers approved a resolution calling for Education Secretary Arne Duncan to resign if he does not improve under a plan to be implemented by President Barack Obama. The \"improvement plan\" would require that Secretary Duncan enact the equity and funding recommendations of the Equity Commission's \"Each and Every Child\" report; revise the No Child Left Behind and Race To The Top \"test-and-punish\" system of accountability to a \"support-and-improve\" structure; and \"promote rather than question\" teachers and school staff.\n\nOn October 2, 2015, Duncan announced he would be stepping down at the close of 2015, to be succeeded by John King Jr. The media stated his tenure had been marked by a \"\"willingness to plunge head-on into the heated debate about the government's role in education.\"\".\n\nIn March 2016, Duncan announced he would join the Palo Alto-based education group Emerson Collective as a managing partner.\n\nHis 2018 book, \"How Schools Work: An Inside Account of Failure and Success From One of the Nation’s Longest-Serving Secretaries of Education\", details his work pushing forward the Common Core standard and discusses examples of students falling far below the education level needed to pursue college that instigated this policy push.\n\nWhile in Australia, Duncan met his future wife, Karen Leanne Duncan, a native of Tasmania. Their children are Claire (18) and Ryan (16).\n\nWhile at Harvard, Duncan co-captained the varsity basketball team and was named a first team Academic All-American. From 1987 to 1991, Duncan played professional basketball, mostly in Australia, with teams including Melbourne's Eastside Spectres, of Australia's National Basketball League.\nDuncan also participated in the 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2020 NBA All-Star Weekend Celebrity Games. Comedian Kevin Hart conceded the 2014 MVP of the celebrity game to Duncan (20 points, 11 rebounds, 6 assists).

{"id": "2226875", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2226875", "title": "Death Merchant", "text": "Death Merchant\n\nThe Death Merchant is the title and lead character of a series of men's action-adventure books written by Joseph Rupert Rosenberger and published by Pinnacle Books from 1971 to 1988. Richard Joseph Camellion, as described in the books, is a master of disguise, the martial arts and wet-work. Cynical and lethal in equal measure, his normal employer was the CIA – at a cost of $100,000 a mission.\n\nHe is described on the back of the books as \"Richard Camellion, master of death, destruction, and disguise. He gets the dirty jobs, the impossible missions, the operations that cannot be handled by the FBI, CIA, or any other legal or extra-legal force. He is a man without a face, without a single identifying characteristic...except that he succeeds by being a Merchant of Death!\"\n\nAccording to information in \"#30, The Shambhala Strike\", Camellion was born in St. Louis, Missouri. He keeps a ranch in Votaw, Texas, where he lives when not on a mission and has two pet pigs, known as Damon and Pythias. Two books, \"#30 The Shambhala Strike\" and \"#53 The Judas Scrolls\" mention Camellion studying at St. Louis University, where he received a Bachelor of Science degree. It is stated in the former book that Camellion holds a degree in engineering from Washington University in St. Louis. Three other books (\"#1 The Death Merchant\", \"#9 Laser Mission\", #11 \"Manhattan Wipeout\") mention that Camellion is an ex-teacher of history, but this may simply be a cover story.\n\nCamellion is very interested in the occult and the prophecies of Nostradamus.\n\nCamellion's father was in the hardware business (#13, \"The Mato Grosso Horror\").\n\nCamellion donates an unspecified percentage of his fees for each mission to assist struggling college students and also the underprivileged in Texas (#17, \"The Zemlya Expedition\").\n\nThe character uses at least one alias in every book. Examples: James Valdorian, Chester Giffwangle, Leonard Higgdon, Emil Milrich, Milton Sessions, Ludwig Huelsenbeck, Thomas Wang-Ji. On two occasions, when asked if Camellion is his real name, he replies that it does not matter. \"#63 The Soul Search Project\" reveals that Richard Joseph Camellion is not the name on his birth certificate.\n\nIn the first book, he is hired by the Mafia to kill an informant. In later books, he never works for organized crime again but accepts missions from the ONI (Office of Naval Intelligence), NSA, CIA and MAD (West German counter-intelligence)\n\nThe series is more nihilistic than many of its 1970s and 1980s action series counterparts; Camellion does not think twice about killing innocent people if it is the quickest way to get the mission accomplished. For example, \"#62, The Soul Search Project\" sees his team killing 18 New York Police Department officers who try to stop them during a mission. Another book series by Rosenberger, \"COBRA\", features similar characters in this regard.\n\n1. The Death Merchant – Richard Camellion versus the Chicago mob.\n\n2.

As such, he was in 1220 involved with the arrival in Morocco of Berard of Carbio and four other Franciscan missionaries. Prior to setting out to the Muslim lands, the Franciscans had met with Peter's sister, who told them that she had \"a little piece of Morocco in her heart\" and asked them to give Peter her love. Once arrived, the Franciscans started preaching in Marrakesh and strongly denouncing Islam and Muhammad. The Caliph declared them \"mad\" and charged Peter and his Christian soldiers with escorting them out of his kingdom. However, the Franciscans managed to avoid Peter and his men, and repeated their act, highly sacrilegious in Muslim terms, in the market-place of Marrakesh - leading to their being decapitated by the Caliph personally.\n\nSubsequently, Peter moved to Aragon, his mother's homeland, where he \nbecame involved in the schemes and campaigns of his relative, the young and ambitious King James I. In 1229 Peter - continuing his family tradition of seeking a bride in Catalonia - married Countess Aurembiaix of Urgell, who had long been exiled from Urgell by the usurper Guerau IV de Cabrera, and who had been James I's mistress. With Peter as her husband and co-ruler, James helped Aurembiaix regain Urgell under the Aragonese overlordship - after she and Peter agreed to hand over to the King the city of Lleida (see Acquisition of Urgell).\n\nIn 1230, Peter helped the Bishop of Tarragona to conquer the Balearic island of Ibiza from the Moors.\n\nFollowing Aurembiaix's death in 1231, Peter continued as Count of Urgell in a titular capacity, but this position was disputed by his overlord James I.\n\nIn 1236 they came to an agreement by which Peter gave up Urgell, which was given over to the rule of the House of Cabrera and was eventually annexed to Aragon. In exchange, Peter got the newly conquered Balearic islands of Majorca, Ibiza and Formentera, as well as the castles of Pollença, and Alaró (also in the Baleares) and of Almudaina (in Alicante).\n\nPeter ruled these Balearic possessions until his death there in 1258. As he left no legitimate issue, they then reverted to the Aragonese Crown, later becoming the core of Kingdom of Majorca ruled by a minor branch of the Aragonese Royal Family.\n\nPeter left two illegitimate sons, Rodrigo and Fernando.\n\n<BR>\n"}
{"id": "2226889", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2226889", "title": "La Esperanza, Honduras", "text": "La Esperanza, Honduras\n\nLa Esperanza () is the capital city and a municipality of the same name of the department of Intibucá, Honduras. La Esperanza is famous for having the coolest climate in Honduras. It is considered the heart of the \"Ruta Lenca\" (Lenca Trail), a region of Lenca ethnic influence that spans Honduras from Santa Rosa de Copan to Choluteca. Sites on the Lenca Trail have been designated by the government and United Nations development in order to encourage more cultural tourism, and help create new markets for the traditional crafts, such as pottery, practiced by the Lenca, in order to preserve their culture. \n\nThe city of La Esperanza is merged indistinguishably with the city of Intibucá, the head of the neighboring municipality of Intibucá. Intibucá is the older of the twin cities and was originally an indigenous Lenca community, while La Esperanza is the newer ladino community. Although the two cities have separate municipal governments, they are often referred to jointly as \"La Esperanza\" as they are only separated by a city street that crosses the city. Residents of La Esperanza are traditionally referred to as \"esperanzanos\" and residents of Intibucá as \"intibucanos\".\n\nThe area was originally occupied by Maya and Lenca people from pre-Columbian times who formed two settlements called Eramani and Lentercala. In 1647, Mayor Francisco de La Cerda was appointed by the Spanish throne to officially demarcate the territory of the indigenous population. He divided the land into two jurisdictions, not corresponding to the Eramani and Lentercala sites, and created boundaries and names for the surrounding small communities. \n\nOver time, the two jurisdictions developed a rivalry, especially over land. The cities grew in population, especially in the 1800s, and La Esperanza was named a villa on 22 September 1848. La Esperanza officially became a city in 1883 when the department of Intibucá was formed by separating from the neighbouring department of Lempira, then called Gracias.\n\nIn 2002, permits were obtained by the Consorcio de Inversiones SA de CV (CISA) to build a hydro electric dam on the Rio Intibucá over an abandoned hydro project. Called the La Esperanza Hydro Project after the city, the dam began producing electricity for the surrounding communities in 2003, but its phase two expansion was not completed until 2006. The project was the first in the world to generate Certified Emission Reductions (CERs) under the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM).\n\nLa Esperanza sits at an altitude of 1700 meters, making it the highest city in Honduras. It is bisected by the Rio Intibucá which runs from the municipality of Intibucá through the municipality of La Esperanza. La Esperanza is situated in a relatively flat mountain valley, bordered by two chains of mountains, the Sierra de Puca Opalaca to the north and Montaña Zapochoco to the Southeast. The area of the La Esperanza municipality is 138.8 km2 and Intibucá 531 km2.\n\nLa Esperanza Airport runs along the valley south of the two cities.\n\nLa Esperanza experiences two distinct seasons: the rainy season/winter from May to October and the dry season/summer from November to April. The rainiest months are June and September, and the driest months February and March. During the winter, it rains primarily in the afternoon and the intense showers often make small dirt roads into the surrounding mountain communities impassable. La Esperanza receives average annual precipitation of 1400 mm. Due to its high altitude, La Esperanza has a cooler climate than most of Honduras, with an average annual temperature of 18.6 °C (65.5 °F). Temperatures in December and January often fall into the 40s at night. Hail has been reported on occasion, but it has never snowed. In the summer, high temperatures reach the 80s, but with low average humidity around 76%.\nThe projected population of La Esperanza for 2018 is 13,800, with 9,900 in the urban area and 3,900 in rural areas of the municipality. Additionally, the projected population for the neighboring municipality of Intibucá of 63,000 in the municipality, including 23,800 in the urban area and 39,000 in the rural areas, translates to a population of 37,600 in the combined urban areas of La Esperanza and Intibucá.\n\nThe municipality has the following five villages (), which encompass 36 hamlets (caseríos):\n\nThe predominant ethnic group are the Lenca people, who have occupied the southwest region of Honduras since pre-Columbian times. The Lenca are the largest ethnic group in Honduras, numbering just over 100,000. The Lenca once had a distinct language which is now extinct. They continue to practice traditional customs and arts, such as the production of textiles and pottery, dances, and clothing. The Lenca people, particularly women, can be recognised by their unique style of dress, including brightly coloured dresses and woven head scarves called \"pañuelos\".\nLife in La Esperanza and Intibucá is centred primarily on agriculture, which is the mainstay of most residents, especially the Lenca. Due to its uniquely cool climate, the department is able to produce products that other departments cannot, including potatoes, strawberries and apples. La Esperanza is famous for its daily farmers market which draws vendors and shoppers from around the department. Lenca farmers arrive from the surrounding communities and sell their fruits and vegetables in the street, while some La Esperanza residents manage permanent wooden stalls. Produce available includes lettuce, spinach, carrots, cucumbers, broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage, potatoes, tomatoes, sweet and hot peppers, yucca, onions, cilantro, apples, blackberries, mangoes, pineapple, bananas, platanos, avocadoes, grapes, peaches and strawberries. The busiest market days are Saturday and Sunday.\n\nAs in the rest of Honduras, the majority of the population is Roman Catholic, with a growing percentage of Evangelicals. As such, Christmastime or \"Navidad\", and Holy Week preceding Easter, called \"Semana Santa\", are major times of celebration. Christmas Eve, known as \"Nochebuena\", is celebrated with a late-night dinner with family and friends followed by lighting fireworks at midnight. \n\nFor Holy Week, there is generally a series of processions and activities related to each day. Good Friday, \"Viernes Santo\" has the largest procession in a re-enactment of Christ's journey to the cross. The people create \"alfombras\" along the path of the procession, designed carpets on the street made of coloured sawdust. Most businesses are closed Thursday (Maundy Thursday) and Friday of Holy Week, which are national holidays.\n\nIn addition to Christmas and Easter, the people celebrate several other annual festivals and holidays, including:\n\nFestivals may include parades, processions, marching bands, food tents, artisan demonstrations, traditional dancing, live music and fireworks.\n\nLocal people make a variety of skilled handicrafts. Many women's groups use hand-constructed wooden looms to produce traditional Lenca woven textiles such as ponchos, scarves, shawls, head scarves, table runners and tablecloths in bright colours. A growing number of groups have begun to take advantage of the ample number of fallen pine needles from the surrounding forests, which they weave into sturdy and decorative baskets, pot holders, and vases. White clay local to the region is used to produce a variety of unique ceramic items. La Esperanza is well known for the production of sweet, liqueur-like wines from fruits such as strawberries, pears, peaches, blackberries, and apples as well as the local favourite, potatoes. Visitors to La Esperanza can purchase these items and many other artisan products from around Honduras at one of the three primary souvenir stores in town, UMMIL (Union de Mujeres Microempresarias Lencas de Intibuca), Opalacas, and El Rincon del Turista.\n\nOn 23 July 2013 La Esperanza was declared the national capital of Honduran folklore, in tribute to the folklorist and native son of La Esperanza, Rafael Manzanares Aguilar. Rafael Manzanares was a Honduran folklorist, author and musical composer. He created the \"Cuadro Nacional De Danzas Folklóricas de Honduras\" and was instrumental in the revival of folklore traditions in Honduras. \n\nThe designation of the capital of Honduran folklore is realised in La Esperanza each year by the folklore festival \"El Grande de Grandes\". Folk dance groups from all parts of Honduras present their regional dances and costumes while competing in this all-day festival.\n\nLa Esperanza is located on the route between Tegucigalpa and Western Honduras, making it a convenient place for stopping while traveling in the country. It is a designated site of the Ruta Lenca. La Esperanza/Intibucá has plenty of hotels, restaurant and shops in every price range.\n\nSome sites of interest in and around La Esperanza include:\n\nLa Esperanza can be most easily reached by car or bus from Siguatepeque via Highway 22 which is paved and in good condition. From La Esperanza, one can take the road to Yamaranguila and connect with Highway CA 11-A to reach San Juan, Intibucá; Gracias, Lempira; and Santa Rosa de Copán, Copan. Parts of the road between La Esperanza and San Juan are unpaved making them sometimes impassable during the rainy season, but the road is currently being paved. Transportes Carolina operates a fleet of Pullman buses which run hourly to/from Tegucigalpa and San Pedro Sula making stops at major cities along the way. There is also regular mini bus service to Marcala, Yamaranguila, San Juan, Erandique, Gracias and Santa Rosa de Copan all leaving from the main bus terminal near the entrance to town. Chicken buses run to smaller surrounding communities.\n\nThe nearby village of San Juan is known for its coffee production. It is near Erandique, home to the ancient fortress of Lempira, an indigenous Honduran hero who fought against the Spanish.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2226891", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2226891", "title": "Ballad opera", "text": "Ballad opera\n\nThe ballad opera is a genre of English stage entertainment that originated in the early 18th century, and continued to develop over the following century and later. Like the earlier \"comédie en vaudeville\" and the later \"Singspiel\", its distinguishing characteristic is the use of tunes in a popular style (either pre-existing or newly composed) with spoken dialogue. These English plays were 'operas' mainly insofar as they satirized the conventions of the imported \"opera seria\". Music critic Peter Gammond describes the ballad opera as \"an important step in the emancipation of both the musical stage and the popular song.\"\n\nBallad opera has been called an \"eighteenth-century protest against the Italian conquest of the London operatic scene.\" It consists of racy and often satirical spoken (English) dialogue, interspersed with songs that are deliberately kept very short (mostly a single short stanza and refrain) to minimize disruptions to the flow of the story, which involves lower class, often criminal, characters, and typically shows a suspension (or inversion) of the high moral values of the Italian opera of the period.\n\nIt is generally accepted that the first ballad opera, and the one that was to prove the most successful, was \"The Beggar's Opera\" of 1728. It had a libretto by John Gay and music arranged by Johann Christoph Pepusch, both of whom probably experienced vaudeville theatre in Paris, and may have been motivated to reproduce it in an English form. They were also probably influenced by the burlesques and musical plays of Thomas D'Urfey (1653–1723) who had a reputation for fitting new words to existing songs; a popular anthology of these settings was published in 1700 and frequently re-issued. A number of the tunes from this anthology were recycled in \"The Beggar's Opera\".\n\nAfter the success of \"The Beggar's Opera\", many similar pieces were staged. The actor Thomas Walker, who played Macheath in the original production, wrote several ballad operas, and Gay produced further works in this style, including a much less successful sequel, \"Polly\". Henry Fielding, Colley Cibber, Charles Coffey, Thomas Arne, Charles Dibdin, Arnold, Shield, Jackson of Exeter, Hook and many others produced ballad operas that enjoyed great popularity. By the middle of the century, however, the genre was already in decline.\n\nAlthough they featured the lower reaches of society, the audiences for these works were typically the London bourgeois. As a reaction to serious opera (at this time almost invariably sung in Italian), the music, for these audiences, was as satirical in its way as the words of the play. The plays themselves contained references to contemporary politics—in \"The Beggar's Opera\" the character Peachum was a lampoon of Sir Robert Walpole. This satirical element meant that many of them risked censorship and banning—as was the case with Gay's successor to \"The Beggar's Opera\", \"Polly\".\n\nThe tunes of the original ballad operas were almost all pre-existing (somewhat in the manner of a modern \"jukebox musical\"): however they were taken from a wide variety of contemporary sources, including folk melodies, popular airs by classical composers (such as Purcell) and even children's nursery rhymes. A significant source from which the music was drawn was the fund of popular airs to which 18th century London broadside ballads are set. It is from this connection that the term \"ballad opera\" is drawn. This ragbag of \"pre-loved\" music is a good test for distinguishing between the original type of ballad opera and its later forms. Many ballad operas used the same tunes, such as \"Lillibullero\", and by about 1750 it had become clear that there was a need for new tunes to be written. In 1762, Thomas Arne's \"Love in a Village\" presented a new form of ballad opera, with mainly new music and much less reliance on traditional tunes. It was followed in similar style by Charles Dibdin's \"Lionel and Clarissa\" in 1768.\n\n\"The Disappointment\" (1762) represents an early American attempt at such a ballad opera.\n\nIn 1736 the Prussian ambassador in England commissioned an arrangement in German of a popular ballad opera, \"The Devil to Pay\", by Charles Coffey. This was successfully performed in Hamburg, Leipzig and elsewhere in Germany in the 1740s. A new version was produced by C. F. Weisse and Johann Adam Hiller in 1766. The success of this version was the first of many by these collaborators, who have been called (according to Grove) \"the fathers of the German Singspiel\". (The storyline of \"The Devil to Pay\" was also adapted for Gluck for his 1759 French opera \"Le diable à quatre\").\n\nA later development, also often referred to as ballad opera, was a more \"pastoral\" form. In subject matter, especially, these \"ballad operas\" were antithetical to the more satirical variety. In place of the rag-bag of pre-existing music found in (for example) \"The Beggar's Opera\", the scores of these works consisted in the main of original music, although they not infrequently quoted folk melodies, or imitated them. Thomas Arne and Isaac Bickerstaffe's \"Love in a Village\", and William Shield's \"Rosina\" (1781) are typical examples. Many of these works were introduced as after-pieces to performances of Italian operas.\n\nLater in the century broader comedies such as Richard Brinsley Sheridan's \"The Duenna\" and the innumerable works of Charles Dibdin moved the balance back towards the original style, but there was little remaining of the impetus of the satirical ballad opera.\n\nEnglish 19th century opera is very heavily drawn from the \"pastoral\" form of the ballad opera, and traces even of the satiric kind can be found in the work of \"serious\" practitioners such as John Barnett. Much of the satiric spirit (albeit in a greatly refined form) of the original ballad opera can be found in Gilbert's contribution to the Savoy operas of Gilbert and Sullivan, and the more pastoral form of ballad opera is satirised in one of Gilbert and Sullivan's early works, \"The Sorcerer\" (1877). Balfe's opera \"The Bohemian Girl\" (1843) is one of the few British Ballad operas of the 20th century to gain international recognition.\n\n\"The Threepenny Opera\" of Kurt Weill and Bertolt Brecht (1928) is a reworking of \"The Beggar's Opera\", setting a similar story with the same characters, and containing much of the same satirical bite. On the other hand, it uses just one tune from the original—all the other music being specially composed, and thus omits one of the most distinctive features of the original ballad opera.\n\nIn a completely different vein, \"Hugh the Drover\", an opera in two acts by Ralph Vaughan Williams first staged in 1924, is also sometimes referred to as a \"ballad opera\". It is plainly much closer to Shield's \"Rosina\" than to \"The Beggar's Opera\".\n\nIn the twentieth century folk singers have produced musical plays with folk or folk-like songs called \"ballad operas\". Alan Lomax, Pete Seeger, Burl Ives, and others recorded \"The Martins and the Coys\" in 1944, and Peter Bellamy and others recorded \"The Transports\" in 1977. The first of these is in some ways connected to the \"pastoral\" form of the ballad opera, and the latter to the satiric \"Beggar's Opera\" type, but in all they represent yet further reinterpretations of the term.\n\nIronically, it is in the musicals of Kander and Ebb—especially \"Chicago\" and \"Cabaret\"—that the kind of satire embodied in \"The Beggar's Opera\" and its immediate successors is probably best preserved, although here, as in Weill's version, the music is specially composed, unlike the first ballad operas of the 18th century.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2226894", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2226894", "title": "Hister", "text": "Hister\n\nHister (genitive Histri) is the Latin name for the Danube (especially its lower course), or for the people living along its banks.\n\nIt also appears as Ister, equivalent to the Ancient Greek Ἴστρος, which also meant the Danube or the region around its mouth. The Ancient Greek colony of Histria in today's Romania was named using this form of the river's name.\n\nThe term may be related to the name of the region Istria in what is now northwestern Croatia, where a tribe called the Histri lived in ancient times. Some once thought that the local freshwater streams in Istria derived from a (non-existent) southward branch of the Danube.\n\nIn modern English the term is most commonly encountered in its use by Nostradamus, especially in a phrase at quatrain II.24 commonly translated \"most of the battle (or armies) will be against Hister\":\n\nor, in English:\n\nThis is often interpreted to be a prediction of the war against Adolf Hitler's Nazi state in the twentieth century. However, none of the reputable sources listed support this view. In fact all of them point out that the name 'Hister' (as Nostradamus himself explains in his Almanac for 1554) in fact refers in his writings to the Danube, being mentioned (as elsewhere) alongside 'R[h]in' (Rhine) – two rivers that formed the north-eastern frontier of the ancient Roman Empire. \"Un bien sçavant homme dans ce dernier quart se pourmenant le long de la riviere Hister dite Danube\", he writes at Prose Presage 222, \"la terre se parfondant, dans ladite riviere se perdra\" ('A very scholarly man during this last quarter, while walking along the river Hister known as Danube, the ground subsiding, in the said river shall be lost'). This is evidently based on a \"historical\" incident described by Nostradamus himself in his \"Traité des fardemens\" (Proem, p. 19, 1552), involving one Gaspar Ursinus Vellius \"consellier à Vienne en Austriche, qui un soir soy pourmenant le long du Danube la terre se fendit, & tumba & se nya\" ('a councillor at Vienna in Austria who one evening was walking along the Danube, the ground split apart and he fell in and was drowned'). Nevertheless, it has also been acknowledged that Hitler referred to the Danube as \"the river of the future\" and sought to use it to affirm control of \"the heart of Europe.\" The Nazi Government also felt the raw minerals in the Danube area were vital to their goals of conquering sufficient \"living space\" in the Soviet Union. In 1936, Hitler oversaw the remilitarization of the Rhineland, which is located along the Rhine River area in western Germany. \n\nThe term iron cage later referred to a sociology concept developed by German sociologist Max Weber. Following World War I, Weber advised the committee which drafted Germany's ill-fated Weimar Constitution, which was still in force during Hitler's time in power. Despite being intended to create a stable parliamentary democracy for Germany, the Weimar Constitution failed at this objective. Article 48 also granted the emergency powers which aided Hitler's ability to establish authoritarian rule in Nazi Germany.\n\n"}
{"id": "2226896", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2226896", "title": "Buddhist Publication Society", "text": "Buddhist Publication Society\n\nThe Buddhist Publication Society is a charity whose goal is to explain and spread the doctrine of the Buddha. It was founded in Sri Lanka in 1958 by two Sri Lankan Buddhist laymen, A.S. Karunaratna and Richard Abeyasekera, and a European-born Buddhist monk, Nyanaponika Thera. Originally conceived as a limited effort to publish small, affordable books on fundamental Buddhist topics, the Society expanded its scope in response to the reception of their early publishing efforts. Reflecting its Sri Lankan roots, the Buddhist Publication society's publications reflect the perspective of the Theravada branch of Buddhism, drawing heavily from the Pali Canon for source material.\n\nThe BPS regularly supplies Buddhist literature to over 3,000 subscriber members all over the world, in some eighty countries. Its titles have been translated into many other languages, including German, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Czech, Hindi, and Chinese. \n\nThe Buddhist Publication Society publishes a variety of works, in both English and Sinhala, ranging from introductory works to translations of technical philosophical texts. The Society publishes works by a number of noted Theravada monks and lay writers, including books by Nyanaponika Thera, Nyanatiloka Thera, Bhikkhu Bodhi, Piyadassi Thera, Bhikkhu Ñanamoli, Narada Mahathera, Mahasi Sayadaw, Helmuth Hecker, S. Dhammika and Francis Story. \n\nFrom the BPS's inception to 1984 Ven. Nyanaponika Thera was the BPS's English editor. From 1984 until 2002 Ven. Bhikkhu Bodhi was the editor. Since 2005 Ven. Bhikkhu Nyanatusita is the editor.\n\nThe BPS's English-language publications fall into three classes: two series of booklets called \"The Wheel\" and \"Bodhi Leaves\", and full-size books. \n\n\"The Wheel\" consists of booklets issued in a format 4.8 x 7.2 inches, typically ranging from 40 to 80 pages. Since the inception of BPS in 1958 about 250 titles have been published, though not all have been maintained in print. The booklets cover a wide range of topics and can be categorized as: Introductory Booklets; Specific Teachings (on the main topics of Buddhist doctrine, such as the Four Noble Truths, the Noble Eightfold Path, dependent origination, the three marks of existence, kamma and rebirth, and so forth); Meditation and Mind Training; Dhamma Reflections (more personal explorations of the relevance of Buddhist principles for spiritual understanding and practice); Philosophy and Psychology; Faith and Devotion; Monastic Life; Comparative Studies; Buddhist History and Culture; Buddhism and the World Today; Translations from the Pali Canon; Non-Canonical Buddhist Literature. All Wheel Publications have been digitalised and are being reissued in bound volumes as well as put on the BPS website. \n\n\"Bodhi Leaves\" is a series of smaller booklets, hand-sized, between 16 and 40 pages in length. Its range of categories is similar to that of the Wheel, but the tone is different, less expository and more conversational. Bodhi Leaves are intended to offer personal insights into the Buddha's teachings, close-up focus on specific ethical and social problems, and practical guidelines to living by the light of the Dhamma. This series was discontinued some years ago, but the issues are being made available in digital format on the BPS website. \n\nThe BPS's line of full-size books ranges from basic introductions to advanced texts on the finer points of Buddhist doctrine and practice. Books on basic Buddhism include several comprehensive surveys that have long been regarded as essential reference works. Ven. Narada Thera's \"The Buddha and His Teachings\" gives an informative account of the Master's life and teaching, highlighting the doctrines of kamma and rebirth, meditation, the nature of Nibbána, and the way to enlightenment. For a complete biography, Bhikkhu Ñanamoli's \"The Life of the Buddha\" is unique: a vivid and moving portrait of the Enlightened One composed almost entirely from texts of the Pali Canon. This is our most popular title, and though in print for over twenty-five years it is still constantly in demand. For an illuminating account of the Buddha's path two authoritative works can be recommended. One is Piyadassi Thera's popular \"The Buddha’s Ancient Path\", the other is Bhikkhu Bodhi's \"The Noble Eightfold Path\". Both works offer detailed explanations of each of the eight factors of the path, thus showing how Buddhism is to be practiced as a way of life.\n\nFor elementary, original source material on the Dhamma, two compilations by the great German scholar-monk Nyanatiloka Thera (Ven. Nyanaponika's teacher) are still unsurpassed. The more elementary is \"The Word of the Buddha\", first compiled in 1906 and subject to some sixteen reprints. This book arranges the Buddha's sayings around the framework of the Four Noble Truths. The more advanced title is \"The Buddha’s Path to Deliverance\", which documents the Buddha's own instructions on all the different methods of meditation, both for concentration and insight, and arranges them according to the pattern of the seven stages of purification.\n\nThe BPS also publishes accurate translations of several small classics from the Pali Canon, including Achariya Buddharakkhita's \"The Dhammapada\" and (in one volume) \"The Udána and the Itivuttaka\", translated by John Ireland. For more advanced students, the present writer has issued translations of four major Pali suttas along with their commentaries and excerpts from the subcommentaries. The first of these is the best one to start with: \"The Discourse on the All-Embracing Net of Views\", a translation of the Brahmajala Sutta and its commentaries. The others are: \"The Discourse on the Root of Existence (the Mulapariyaya Sutta)\"; \"The Great Discourse on Causation (the Mahanidana Sutta)\"; and \"The Discourse on the Fruits of Recluseship (the Samaññaphala Sutta).\"\n\nBPS books on meditation give qualified guidance in both the practical methods of meditation and the underlying theory. A thorough and informative survey is Amadeo Sole-Leris's \"Tranquillity and Insight,\" which systematically explores both samatha and vipassana meditation according to the classical sources and their modern adaptations. A modern classic is Nyanaponika Thera's \"The Heart of Buddhist Meditation.\" Basic instructions in insight meditation are found in Mahasi Sayadaw's \"Practical Insight Meditation\", while Jack Kornfield's \"Modern Buddhist Masters\" collects tracts from a range of contemporary Theravada meditation masters from Burma and Thailand. A work with a unique flavour is \"The Seven Stages of Purification\" by the late Matara Sri Ñāṇanārāma Mahathera, one of Sri Lanka's most respected meditation masters of recent times. \n\nThe BPS also publishes several books on the Abhidhamma, a systematic arrangement of the Buddha's philosophical and psychological teachings, defining the theory that lies behind his more pragmatically oriented discourses: \"A Comprehensive Manual of Abhidhamma\", a translation of the \"Abhidhammattha-sangaha\" complete with a detailed explanatory guide by the Burmese Sayadaw U Rewatadhamma and Bhikkhu Bodhi. Nyanaponika Thera's \"Abhidhamma Studies\" demonstrates the practical relevance of the Abhidhamma to the spiritual life. To find one's way through the seven books of the canonical Abhidhamma, Nyanatiloka Thera's \"Guide through the Abhidhamma Pitaka\" is of great use. For exploring the full range of classical Theravada thought Achariya Buddhaghosa's masterpiece, The \"Visuddhimagga\" is essential. This is a virtual encyclopaedia of Buddhist doctrine and meditation, which gives detailed coverage to all the meditation subjects and, in its middle chapters, a survey of the Abhidhamma. This is published by BPS in the outstanding translation by Bhikkhu Ñanamoli under the title \"The Path of Purification.\" The BPS also publishes the translation of an earlier, shorter work, the \"Vimuttimagga\" or \"Path of Freedom,\" which served as the example for the \"Visuddhimagga,\" and which is only completely extant in a Chinese translation. A draft translation from the Chinese was done by N.R.M. Ehara, Soma Thera and Kheminda Thera. A new translation of this important work is currently being done by Bhikkhu Nyanatusita. \n\nOver the years BPS has published several works by the greatest Burmese scholar-monk of recent times, Ledi Sayadaw. The Wheel series includes Ledi Sayadaw's \"Manual of Insight (Vipassana Dipani), The Requisites of Enlightenment (Bodhipakkhiya Dipani), The Noble Eightfold Path and Its Factors (Magganga Dipani), The Buddhist Philosophy of Relations (Patthanuddesa Dipani)\" and the \"Manual of Mindfulness of Breathing (Anapana Dipani)\". \"The Manual of the Supreme Man (Uttamapurisa Dipani)\" and, most recently, the \"Manual of Light and the Path of Higher Knowledge (Alin Kyan and Vijjamagga Dipani)\" were published in book form. \n\nThe most recent book publications of the BPS are: \"The Life of Nyanatiloka Thera\" by Hellmuth Hecker and Bhikkhu Nyanatusita, \"Similes of the Buddha\" by Hellmuth Hecker, \"Buddhist Nuns\" by Mohan Wijayaratna and \"Jataka Tales of the Buddha\" by Ken and Visakha Kawasaki.\n\nIn the late 1990s, the BPS entered into co-publication agreements with major Buddhist publishers in the West. The purpose of this step is to make its own works more readily available to readers in the Americas and Europe. The BPS also co-publishes works on Theravada Buddhism first issued by Western publishers, to make them more easily available for Asian readers. To date the BPS's partner in both areas of cooperation has been Wisdom Publications in Boston. \n\nWorks first issued by Wisdom Publications, and then taken over for the Asian readership by BPS, include: \"The Middle Length Discourses of the Buddha\", a translation of the Majjhima Nikaya originally made by Bhikkhu Ñanamoli, U Pandita's \"In This Very Life\" and Ayya Khema's \"Being Nobody, Going Nowhere\". Along with Wisdom, the BPS also publishes a wonderful collection of biographies called \"The Great Disciples of the Buddha\". This book brings to life for the modern reader such outstanding figures as Sariputta and Moggallana.\n\nBPS has also partnered with Pariyatti, a U.S. publisher, importer, distributor, and bookseller affiliated with the Vipassana Research Academy, established in Igatpuri, India, by Sri S.N. Goenka. As well as distributing BPS books in the Americas, Pariyatti has created an imprint called BPS Pariyatti Editions (BPE) to publish American editions of \"The Path of Purification, A Comprehensive Manual of Abhidhamma, The Noble Eightfold Path\" and other popular BPS titles. \n\nSince 1960 the BPS has been issuing a Sinhala-language counterpart of The Wheel called \"Damsak\" (= \"Dhamma-cakka\"), and a series of full-size books in Sinhala called Kalana Mithuru (= Kalyanamitra) Books. From 1960 \"Damsak\" was edited by the famous Sri Lankan missionary monk, Ven. Piyadassi Thera. After his death in 1998, responsibility for the Sinhala publications was taken over by his assistant, A.G.S. Kariyawasam until his death in 2005. Currently, Mr. Senadheera is looking after the Sinhalese publications.\n\nIn 1993, the Society launched the Nyanaponika Dhamma Dana project, named in honor of former Society president Nyanaponika Mahathera. Under the auspices of the project, 50-150 copies of each new book published by the society are sent free of charge to libraries, monasteries, and Buddhist centers around the world. Copies of the Wheel are also sent to a number of Buddhist temples and practice centers, to be distributed free of charge.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Hankin's first purchase was the land of Rehovot, acquired in 1890. A year later he bought the land that later became the settlement and city of Hadera. He then purchased territories for the Jewish Colonial Association in the Galilee.\n\nIn 1888 Hankin married Olga Belkind (1852–1943) in Gedera. She was a woman twelve years his senior, who would become his partner in all his endeavors. Their marriage remained childless.\n\nIn 1908, when the Zionist organization sent Arthur Ruppin and set up the Palestine Land Development Company, Hankin joined. In 1909 or 1910, Hankin completed his first major purchase in the Jezreel Valley. He bought some 10,000 dunams (10 km²) of land in Al-Fuleh, which became the home of Merhavia. This purchase also marked the start of bitter disputes between Arabs and Jews over the rights of tenant farmers who had been evicted, and regarding the employment of Jewish or Arab watchmen for the land.\n\nIn his article, \"Buying the Emek\", Arthur Ruppin described the vicissitudes of this purchase:\n\nBecause of the reluctance of Zionist organizations to pay for land, Hankin frequently agreed to purchase lands and then convinced the Jewish agency or others to finance the \"done deal.\" As Ruppin notes:\n\nDuring World War I, Hankin was exiled by the Turks to Anatolia. Returning to Palestine, he soon resumed his work where he had left off. In 1920, he concluded a deal with the Sursuk family of Beirut for purchase of 60,000 dunams (60 km²) of land in the Jezreel Valley. He negotiated for this land when he had in fact not a penny to finance the purchase. The chairman of the Jewish National Fund, Nehemiah De Lieme, refused to pay for the land, arguing that it was beyond the budget of the Fund, but he was overruled by the Zionist organization and in particular Chaim Weizmann. This tract became home to numerous new kibbutzim and other settlements, including Nahalal, Ginegar, Kfar Yehezkel, Geva, Ein Harod, Tel Yosef and Beit Alfa. Half of this land was unirrigated and considered of low value, but the remainder contained about 500 Arab tenant farmers. These latter, though reimbursed above and beyond the requirements of the law, continued to complain of dispossession.\n\nSubsequently, Hankin was involved in large scale purchases of land in and around Acco. In 1927, Hankin proposed an ambitious 20 year land purchase plan to the Jewish Agency for Israel, a plan that was never carried out in full. In 1932 he became head of the Palestine Land Development Corporation.\n\nHankin understood the necessity to plan for Arab as well as Jewish settlement, and apparently intended to do so. In July 1930 he wrote:\n\nHankin died in Tel Aviv and was buried in the Galilee next to his wife Olga, at the house (\"Bet Hankin\") he had built for themselves at Ein Harod on Mount Gilboa.\n\n\n"}

Her musical style is a blend of indie pop, soul, and rock.\n\nRes released her debut album, \"How I Do\", in 2001 along with its first single \"Golden Boys.\" Despite heavy rotation on VH1, the song did not catch on in radio play. \"Ice King\" (Remixed by Nas) emerged as the second single later that year but also failed to break through with radio audiences and no video was filmed. In early 2002, Res released the third single from \"How I Do\", \"They-Say Vision.\" The song and accompanying video were breakthrough hits and reached #1 on the Billboard Dance chart and #37 on the Hot 100 Singles Sales chart. With the chart success of the single, the album entered the \"Billboard\" 200 for the first time. A fourth single, \"Sittin' Back,\" was also released, but did not enjoy the same success as \"They-Say Vision.\"\n\nMeanwhile, in 2002, Res appeared on a track with Tony Allen, Ray Lema, Baaba Maal, Positive Black Soul and Archie Shepp for the Red Hot Organization's compilation album \"Red Hot and Riot\", a tribute to Nigerian musician Fela Kuti. Res also performed a cover of Jefferson Starship song, \"Miracles\" for the Jennifer Lopez movie \"Maid in Manhattan\".\n\nIn 2003, her record label, MCA Records, was phased out by MCA Inc. and absorbed by Geffen Records. Res was later released from her contract at her request after the label refused to release any further work despite paying her contracted label salary. After parting ways with Geffen, Res was called upon to model for Marc Ecko's \"Ecko Red\" clothing line and appeared in print advertising.\n\nIn 2006, Res recorded \"To Empower\" for the soundtrack of the drama film \"Akeelah and the Bee\". She joined Gnarls Barkley's St. Elsewhere tour providing supporting vocals while writing and recording material for her second album.\n\nIn 2009, Res released her second album \"Black.Girls.Rock!\" through digital media available on iTunes. The album features tracks originally recorded for her shelved Geffen album. \"Black.Girls.Rock!\" is described by Res as \"more of a singer/songwriters album than my debut. Great, classic songs!\" Res funded a limited production run of vinyl pressings.\n\nOn February 14, 2011, Res released a compilation of unreleased demos and remixed songs titled \"A Box of Chocolates\" after the Forrest Gump quote. The digital-only album is mixed by DJ NI** Sky (Nicole Albino of Nina Sky) and features a blend of music from multiple genres of music. The album was intended as a Valentine's Day gift to her fans as they awaited a proper release of \"Black.Girls.Rock!\".\n\nIn 2013, Res signed with Javotti Media/EOne Records and her long-awaited third studio album \"Reset\" was set to be released September 15, 2016.\n\nAs of June 2018, the album had not been released, but an Indigogo campaign to raise funds for the album had raised $39,000.\n\nIn 2009, Res joined long-time collaborator and emcee Talib Kweli to form a hip-hop/electro duo known as Idle Warship. They have released a few teaser tracks online including a song named \"Steady\" that borrows from '80s classic \"Sunglasses At Night\" by Corey Hart. In June 2009, Idle Warship completed their first headlining tour through Europe. They performed to sold-out crowds in Switzerland, Norway, France and Germany.

The fact that \"Smile\" had been shelved two months earlier meant the group had no new material to release in time for the Summer Of Love, although the music composed for that album was radical enough to have been part of it. Another commercial blunder came from their failure to appear at the Monterey International Pop Festival, which they had helped to organize and had been slated to headline as the closing act. In time the album would go on to sell over two million copies but the initial reaction must have given the Beach Boys cause for concern about their popularity and status in their homeland.\n\nHowever, a reworked track list issued under the same title in the UK in late 1967 proved to be another big success.\n\nLike its predecessor, \"Best of The Beach Boys Vol. 2\" is out of print.\n\nThe Duophonic version of the album features true stereo mixes of \"Long Tall Texan\", \"Don't Worry Baby\" and \"Little Saint Nick\".\n\n\"Please Let Me Wonder\" and \"Little Saint Nick\" do not appear on the cassette tape version.\n\n\"Best of The Beach Boys Vol. 2\" (Capitol (D) 2706) hit number 50 in the US during a 22-week tenure.

{"id": "2226941", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2226941", "title": "Stavrovouni Monastery", "text": "Stavrovouni Monastery\n\nStavrovouni Monastery () is a Greek Orthodox monastery which stands on the top of a hill called Stavrovouni (Greek: Σταυροβούνι) in Cyprus; it is sometimes simply known as Stavrovouni. The monastery is one of the few places where one can see a piece of the Holy Cross. Stavrovouni Monastery was founded by Saint Helena (Saint Constantine's mother) in around 327–329 AD and therefore it is one of the oldest monasteries in the world.\n\nThe monastery is located on the peak of the mountain of the same name (Stavrovouni) in the District of Larnaca. The mountain in earlier times had been known under the name of Olympus, but nowadays the highest point of the Troodos Mountains further to the west bears that name. Stavrovouni, as the name already indicates, is dedicated to the Holy Cross; it can be derived from two words 'stavros' (Greek: Σταυρός) for cross and 'vouno' (βουνό) for mountain, so that it basically means \"the mountain of the Cross\".\n\nAccording to religious tradition, the monastery was founded by St. Helena, the mother of the Byzantine Emperor Constantine I, the Great. According to the 15th century Cypriot chronicler Leontios Makhairas, after the end of the First Ecumenical Synod in Nicaea (325), Helena went on a pilgrimage to the Holy Land when she discovered the three crosses on which Jesus and the two thieves had been crucified. She had them excavated and wanted to bring them to Constantinople, but she is said to have left one of these crosses in Cyprus during an involuntary visit caused by shipwreck. Religious history says that the Holy Cross was transferred by a miracle to the peak of a high hill overnight and that a strong light was coming out of that peak. After several unsuccessful attempts to get the Holy Cross out of that mountain, Helena decided to leave a piece there, and built a small chapel to accompany it.\n\nStavrovouni is therefore considered to be one of the oldest monasteries in the world; other ancient monasteries are: Saint Athanasius (344), Saint Anthony (356), Saint Macarius (360), Saint Gabriel (Mor Gabriel) (397), Saint Euthymius (460), Saint Sabbas (Mar Saba) (483) and Saint Catherine, Sinai (565).\n\nThe most significant relic that Stavrovouni Monastery possesses is a piece of the Holy Cross, left at the monastery by Saint Helena. There are references from several sources which report that the Holy Cross used to stand unsupported in the air. Nowadays, the remaining piece of the Cross is kept within a large silver cross. Other relics left at the monastery by Helena include the Cross of the Good Thief, a nail, and, according to some sayings, a part of the rope that had bound Jesus to the Cross.\n\nIn addition, visitors will find two small chains which were worn by Saint Panaretos, Bishop of Paphos, during his life, and which were in direct contact with his body.\n\nStavrovouni is the earliest documented monastery on the island. The oldest written reference dates from the Byzantine period, and it proves that Stavrovouni had been an important religious centre since the 4th century. The relevant information can be found in the memoirs of a Russian traveler, Abbot Daniel, who stayed on Cyprus in 1106. He recorded that the Holy Cross was located on Mount Olympus with the objective of \"warding off evil spirits and curing any illness\", and he noted, \"This cross is like a meteorite, it is not supported in the ground, because the Holy Ghost holds it in the empty space. I, unworthy man, knelt down before this holy, mysterious object and have seen with my own, sinful eyes the inherent holy grace present in this place.\"\n\nAfter its foundation, Stavrovouni was occupied by Orthodox monks living according to the rule of St. Basil. We obtain further historical information from Western visitors to Cyprus in the 13th century. Willibrandi de Oldenburg, for example, visited Stavrovouni in 1211 and wrote, \"The cross of the Good Thief is on the highest mountain in Cyprus\" – which was incorrect, as Stavrovouni is not as high as the Troodos peak. Ludolph von Suchen noted in 1305, \"The mountain is like the Mount Tabor on which the Benedictine monks live. From its peak one can see the Lebanon.\" This is true, but the weather must be very clear in order to verify this.\n\nIn its long history, Stavrovouni went through times of great poverty and hardship caused by the numerous invasions by foreigners on the island. Nowadays, the Holy Cross is no longer there and nobody knows what has happened to it. In 1598, the Bohemian nobleman Krystof Harant noted, \"Nobody knows what the Turks have done with the Holy Cross.\" The walls, the church, the iconostasis, and the monks' cells in Stavrovouni were almost completely destroyed during a great fire in 1888. The only relic which has been preserved down to the present is a silver cross in which a minute piece of the Holy Cross is inserted, the only major reliquary which is still kept in Stavrovouni.\n\nThe records suggest that the monastery had no monks for a period roughly between the 16th and the 19th century, a time when the Turks ruled the island. The monastery was abandoned from 1571, however, some hermits continued to live there. This fact was mentioned by Russian monk and pilgrim, Vasil Grigorovich-Barsky in first half of 18th century. At the end of the 19th century, Elder Dionysios A' moved to Stavrovouni from Mount Athos in 1889, and the monastery was in operation again. In 1890, three more Cypriot monks, again from Mount Athos, joined him at Stavrovouni: Fathers Varnavas – who would become the next Abbot – and his two brothers Kallinikos and Gregorios.\n\nFollowing that, new monks entered the monastery, which grew larger and larger and soon became the spiritual center of the island of Cyprus. The monastery grew so much during the mid-20th century that it was in a position where it was able to send monks to other ruined monasteries to help their growth. For example, monks from Stavrovouni moved to the Monastery of Panagia Trooditissa in Troodos and created a new group. Other monks attempted to move to, and revive, the Monastery of Saint John the Baptist in Mesa Potamos in Limassol.\n\nElder Dionysios A' served as the first Abbot until 1902, and then Elder Varnavas took over. The most recent Abbots are:\n\n\nStavrouvouni Monastery has been a center of spirituality and worship in Cyprus over the last century, as many spiritual monks made their homes there. Saint Filoumenos the Cypriot martyr, member of the Brotherhood of the Holy Sepulchre, is one such important monk who started his monastic life at Stavrovouni. On the 16/29 November 1979, he died violently as a martyr at Jacob's Well, where he served as Superior. His twin brother Archimandrite Elpidios started his monastic life at Stavrovouni, as well.\n\nThe Hieromonk Kyprianos († 1955) is another significant figure who lived at Stavrovouni; he was known for his strict way of life and his helpful advice to the people of Cyprus. Archbishop Leontios of Cyprus (1896–1947) was staying at Stavrovouni for some period and was closely related with Hieromonk Kyprianos.\n\nRecently, the monastery underwent a complete renovation. Its small church was restored again with frescoes and icons by the well-known painter, Fr. Kallinikos, a monk from Stavrovouni. The legend of the foundation is recorded in these pictures: St. Helena in a brilliant red garment and the Finding of the True Cross in Jerusalem. (As an aside, the emperor's mother recognised that she had the true Holy Cross by the miraculous healing of a woman.) Colourful, but also not without the skull painted beneath Christ's Cross for centuries is the Deposition. The majority of the frescoes in the church refer to the Cross and the life of St. Helena. In this manner, Stavrovouni is continuing the deeply rooted Byzantine painting tradition.\n\nStavrovouni has a long tradition in icon painting and frescoes, and its most famous icon painter monk is Father Kallinikos. Even the first Abbot Dionysios A' was an icon painter, and there are several pieces of work by monks from Stavrovouni in the island. Apart from icon painting, the monks work in a number of other services, such as agriculture and production of aromatics for the church. Moreover, locals visit the monastery, especially on feast days, and follow the monks in their worship programme – in liturgy, vespers, etc.\n\n\"Metochia\" or Dependencies (Greek: Μετόχια) are small monasteries or chapels that belong to a main monastery. Stavrovouni has a number of metochia, of which the most well-known is Agia Varvara at the foot of Stavrovouni hill. Until some decades ago, most of the monks used to stay at this \"metochi\" as there was no water and electricity at the top of the hill, and only two or three monks would stay at the top. Other \"metochia\" are Panagia Stazousa and Agios Modestos, which are located between the villages of Pyrga and Klavdia. Today, monks at Agia Varvara work as icon painters and in agriculture, whereas monks at the other two \"metochia\" concentrate more on prayers and live more closely to a hermitic life.\n\nAt present, monks in Stavrovouni live a very strict form of monastic life, similar to that of the monks on Mount Athos. The rule of their first abbot, Dionysios I, forms the basis of this. Women are not allowed to enter the main part of the monastery, but they are allowed to visit the chapel out of it on the top of the hill. They are also allowed to visit the Metochi Agia Varvara at the foot of the hill only on Sundays. This rule is called \"avato\" (Greek: άβατο, meaning: entry is prohibited), and it is analogous to the strict life of monks in Mount Athos where women are not allowed to enter. This rule is applied in order to keep the monks isolated and living a stricter way of life.\n\nToday, there are over 30 monks in Stavrovouni Monastery, and the current Abbot is Archimandrite Athanasios.\n\n\n"}

The municipality of Boaco has a population of 56,985 (2015 est.) and an area of 1,086.81 km (26% of the Boaco Department) while the department (state) is 4,177 km2.\n\nThe city of Boaco, with a population of approximately 19,000 (2006 est.), is located in the mountains 88 km. east of Managua. Boaco is called \"Ciudad de Dos Pisos\" (The Two-Storey City), nicknamed by Dr. Armando Incer Barquero. The city's only two flat places are \"El Parque\" (Park) and the baseball field.\n\nThe name Boaco has its roots in the Zumo and Aztec native languages. It is composed of two words; \"Boa\" or \"Boaj\" (\"Enchanters\") and the suffix \"O\" (\"place\" or \"town\"). In other words, Boaco means \"Place (or Town) of the Enchanters\". The ancient Boaco, or \"Boaco Viejo\" (Old Boaco) was located five leagues (15 miles) east of the present-day city of Boaco. No vestiges of the former population remain. It was founded by Spanish colonists who migrated from today's Guatemala.\n\nIn 1749, the Zambo, Caribe and Mosquito Indians, encouraged by the British colonists on Nicaragua's Atlantic coast, raided Boaco Viejo. They destroyed the town. The few who survived the massacre fled west and founded the new town of Boaco (now known as \"Boaquito\" (\"little Boaco\")) near the Malacatoya River.\n\nBetween 1752 and 1772, the population of what was called Boaquito moved to higher ground, where the city of Boaco is today, mainly due to the endemic diseases and flooding that regularly occurred in the lowlands during the rainy season.\n\nThe municipality of Boaco was traditionally part of the Chontales Department. On February 4, 1910, the government of José Madriz established the department of Jerez with the city of Boaco as its capital. However, the conservative government reversed that law. It was not until July 18, 1935 that the government of Juan Bautista Sacasa created the Boaco Department, incorporating the municipalities of Boaco, Camoapa, San Lorenzo, Teustepe, San José de los Remates and Santa Lucía. Boaco was designated the capital of the department.\n\nBoaco is located in the hilly central region of Nicaragua. Its topography is irregular with many mountains, which are smaller than the mountains in northern Nicaragua.

The city has a population of 200,000, according to the 2012 census, while the population of the department is more than 604,900. Matagalpa is Nicaragua's fourth largest city, the largest in the country's interior, and one of the most commercially active outside of Managua. Matagalpa is the 4th most important city in Nicaragua and is known as the \"Pearl of the North\" and \"Land of Eternal Spring.\"\n\nAccording to Jeronimo Perez, a historian who visited this area in 1855–1856 the name Matagalpa means Cabeza Principal (Main Head) or Pueblo Grande (Big Town) from the Matagalpa indigenous language words: Maika=Head, Calpul* Town-\nBut according to the Matagalpan linguist father Guillermo Kiene, a Catholic priest and missionary who lived from 1898 to 1959, the word Matagalpa comes from the Sumo language, and means \"let's go where the rocks are.\"\n\nThere have been other descriptions of the word Matagalpa: -Here next to the water, and -Among Mountains ( \"Aqui junto al agua\" y \"Entre Montañas\"). These descriptions are believed to be related to the geographic location of the city, which is next to the Grand River of Matagalpa, and also beautifully surrounded by mountains.\n\nMatagalpa was originally an indigenous village. The Cacaopera people, or Matagalpa had their own language, which has been extinct since 1875. A document from the year 1855 with 97 words and phrases from the Matagalpa language can be found in the Daniel G. Brinton section of the American Philosophical Library in Philadelphia.\n\nThe Matagalpa made ceramics of a style known as \"Ceramica Negra\" and \"Naranja Segovia\", they also built stone statues representing their chieftain and warriors. They were feared by the Spanish because they were very brave and effective with their bows and other arms. It took 300 years for the Spanish to submit them, even at the time of Nicaragua Independence in 1821, there were many Cacaopera free in the central mountains of Nicaragua.\nIn 1856 they were decisive to defeat William Walker's filibusters in the Battle of San Jacinto on 14 September 1856, where a column of 60 Cacaopera people with bow and arrows fought at the side of Nicaraguan Patriots winning that battle, which marked the end of Walker adventure in Nicaragua. That quest has been recognized by historians and archaeologists, and there is a popular movement to declare the Cacaopera as National Heroes by the Congress of the Republic next month of September 2011.\n\nMatagalpa was an existing indigenous town when the first Spaniards came to this region by 1528 during an attempt to find a water passage to the \"Northern Sea\", the Caribbean. (Nicaragua's Spanish colonization originated from the direction of the Pacific Ocean, which was called the Southern Sea by the Spaniards.\n\nMatagalpa is located in the continental divide between the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea. Many stories are preserved from colonial times about the British-controlled Mosquito Coast, and the Spanish-colonized Pacific area.\n\nGold was discovered around Matagalpa by 1840. Along with many Spaniards and Mestizos, it attracted German, American and British immigrants. Two of the better known immigrants of this period were Ludwig Elster (from Hannover) and his wife Katharina Braun (from Schwarzwald, Germany Black Forest) who planted the first coffee trees in the area, the beans from which quickly went to market in Germany. Coffee agriculture attracted more than 120 European immigrants, many of whom married Matagalpan women, and many of their descendants still live in the area.\n\nIn 1923 some Danish immigrants also came to Matagalpa, and settled in the highlands as well. Most of the Danish families went back to Denmark. Three families stayed: the Gröns, the Möllers, and the Petersens.\n\nMatagalpa was also the city of refuge for many Nicaraguans escaping the invasion of Tennessean filibuster William Walker who took over much of the country and government in 1856. In Matagalpa the patriots organized the \"Ejército del Septentrión\" (\"Army of the North\"), which fought in and won the Battle of San Jacinto, assisted by 60 Matagalpa, on 14 September 1856, helping to end Walker's rule.\nMatagalpa was also the birthplace of Nazario Vega, Governor and builder of the Cathedral; Bartolomé Martínez, President of Nicaragua, 1923–24; and Carlos Fonseca Amador, founder of the Sandinista Front in 1961.\n\nCurrently the department of Matagalpa is the second most populous in Nicaragua after the national capital (Managua), and the most diversified in production. Over the past few years Matagalpa has experienced a large influx of migrants (mainly peasants) from other departments, causing stress on infrastructure and the environment.\n\nMatagalpa has a beautiful panoramic highway that starts in the city of Matagalpa and extends to the city of Jinotega. Scenic views extend up to away, to the volcanic range near the Pacific coast.\n\nMany historians, archeologists, botanists and ethnologists have arrived in recent years to do research in this region. American and European descendants of the first settlers are also returning to visit the historical homes of their ancestors.\n\nMatagalpa produces and exports beef, cheese, coffee, cacao, onions, tomatoes and mixed fruits and vegetables. For local consumption it produces flowers, wood, corn, beans, fruits (oranges, grapefruits, bananas, plantains) and many kinds of vegetables such as broccoli, and cauliflower.\n\nMatagalpa is known for its coffee, its cattle, milk products, vegetables, flowers and mountains popular with ecotourists. It is the location of such storied mountain tourist resorts as Aranjuez, Santa Maria de Ostuma, and Selva Negra Mountain Resort.\n\nA large part of the economy in Matagalpa depends on eco-tourism. Nature hikes, walks, and excursions are very common throughout Matagalpa, and the northern region on Nicaragua. One of the most recognized eco-tourism sites is Selva Negra Wildlife Refuge, with over of land dedicated to the conservation of the area's diverse flora and fauna.\n\nMatagalpa, along with nearby Jinotega, enjoy \"eternal spring\" or all year, spring-like weather. Matagalpa lies more than above sea level with the average temperature ranging from ., and relative humidity between 75% to 85%. Average rainfall is .\n\n\nMatagalpa is twinned with:\n"}

The UK version was written by English satirist Tony Hendra, who was also the voice director.\n\nIn 1995, World War III begins by accident when a hitman uses an miniature nuclear weapon in a hit which destroys Sicily; Italy mistakes the blast for nuclear terrorism and annihilates Libya, which destroys Israel. Africa bombs Germany, which in turn attacks France. Luxembourg bombs England. Sweden destroys itself. The Russians decide to liquidate the Americans, who in turn unleash their nuclear fleet, leaving only two continents on the verge of World War IV. In the north, America and Russia merge, containing a mutated strain of males, forming the \"USSSR\". In the south, all that is left of womankind retreat to their territory of \"Vaginia\". The armies of these two nations are soon at odds with each other as they perfect their most destructive weapons capable of destroying the universe.\n\nThe Council of the Universe, fearing for everyone's safety, appoints Fred Hero, a retired superhero now working as a garbageman to diplomatically calm the situation down. He is given a powerful light bulb that makes him invincible. Fred firsts starts off with the USSSR and tries to persuade the nation's leader, the Comrade-In-Chief, to get rid of all of the bombs. The Comrade-In-Chief sees Fred as a lunatic and whispers to his three minions to fetch the guards. While he's waiting, The Comrade-In-Chief explains to Fred that all of the men lost their asses during World War III. The women were safe underground. When the war was over, and the women came back up and saw the men without their asses, they just laughed. The Comrade-In-Chief plans to destroy Vaginia with their weapon \"The Big One\" - a missile shaped like a penis. After the history lesson, Fred accidentally meets and promptly falls in love with the nation's female mascot, Liberty. Fred escapes the Comrade's lair with Liberty. When they're finally alone, Fred wishes to marry Liberty, but Liberty finds out that Fred's married. Liberty is shocked and decides to return to the Comrade.\n\nFred then flies over to Vagina and meets the multi-breasted leader Una. Una reveals the Vaginia has a super-weapon called \"Big Mama\" - a spherical missile that has a vagina and nipple on it that is designed to combine with \"The Big One\" and thus destroy the universe. Fred once again tries to get Una to make peace with the USSSR, but this time, Una agrees, but only if he and her have sex. Fred is unable to withstand her advances, and unable to please her complex body. With no hope for peace and mad with rage at the idea of being separated from Liberty, Fred inadvertently starts the Fourth World War. While the two nations fight, Fred eventually decides to try to win Liberty's heart back and save the universe. Liberty is taken on board \"The Big One\", which starts to rise as Fred hurries to her rescue. He manages to get on board and escape with her to the safety of a tropical island only for them to be caught up in the final battle between both nations armies. As the two missiles circle above the sky, this gets the two nations extremely horny for each other. While the two nations have an orgy on the island, Fred tries to get back with Liberty, who still declines Fred's offer, due to Fred still being married. Just then, Fred gets a message from his wife, who says that she's seeing another man, Conan, Fred's Conan the Barbarian-like coworker. Fred and Liberty run toward each other with open arms. As they hug, \"The Big One\" penetrates \"Big Mama\" and both explode in a cosmic orgasm which causes the entire universe to be destroyed. God, who is having sex with his wife notices this but doesn't care. Fred and Liberty arrive in Heaven, and they both have sex in a lone cloud, beginning their new life together.\n\nAfter \"\" and \"The Missing Link\", \"The Big Bang\" is the third feature by Picha, which includes Picha's typical humor and his love of provocation and nonsense. Picha claims that the film is \"the culmination of a trilogy, a mixture of these concerns in the other two films ... a little more tied to the news of the day, only more excessive. \"The Big Bang\" is a film about the all wars, including personal wars you find in the family.\"\n\nProduction lasted from 1984 to 1986. When the film was released in the UK, the British Board of Film Censors cut the film by 10 seconds to remove a sequence in which an animated version of God appeared to be having sex and then uttered an expletive. After the release of the film, Picha put his theatrical work on hold, choosing to produce television cartoons instead.\n\nThe film was released on DVD on 7 February 2011 in the United Kingdom by Lace DVD. There are currently no plans to release this film in North America.\n\n\n"}

SR 542 travels east as the Mount Baker Highway from an interchange with Interstate 5 (I-5) in Bellingham through the Nooksack River valley to the Mt. Baker Ski Area at Austin Pass. It serves as the main highway to Mount Baker and the communities of Deming, Kendall, and Maple Falls along the Nooksack River. The highway was constructed in 1893 by Whatcom County as a wagon road between Bellingham and Maple Falls and was added to the state highway system as a branch of State Road 1 in 1925. The branch was transferred to Primary State Highway 1 (PSH 1) during its creation in 1937 and became SR 542 during the 1964 highway renumbering.\n\nSR 542 begins as Sunset Drive and the Mount Baker Highway at a partial cloverleaf interchange with I-5 to the northeast of downtown Bellingham. The highway travels northeast through suburban neighborhoods along Squalicum Creek and passes Squalicum High School as it leaves the city of Bellingham. SR 542 continues northeast through rural Whatcom County, crossing the Nooksack River and intersecting SR 9 at a roundabout. The concurrent SR 9 and SR 542 travel southeast through the community of Deming along a BNSF rail line and passes Mount Baker Senior High School. SR 542 leaves SR 9 east of Deming and turns north along the North Fork of the Nooksack River and the eastern slope of Sumas Mountain to Kendall, where it serves as the southern terminus of SR 547. The Mount Baker Highway turns east and continues along the Nooksack River North Fork into the Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest at Glacier in the foothills of Mount Baker. SR 542 turns south and serves the Mt. Baker Ski Area on the northeast side of the mountain before splitting into a one-way pair around Picture Lake. The Mount Baker Highway continues through Austin Pass and ends at Artist Point, located at above sea level on Kulshan Ridge.\nEvery year, the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) conducts a series of surveys on its highways in the state to measure traffic volume. This is expressed in terms of average annual daily traffic (AADT), which is a measure of traffic volume for any average day of the year. In 2011, WSDOT calculated that the busiest section of SR 542 was the I-5 interchange in Bellingham, serving 38,000 vehicles, while the least busy section of SR 542 was the one-way pair around Picture Lake in Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest, serving 230 vehicles. The Mount Baker Highway is designated as a National Forest Scenic Byway and serves as the eastern section of the Ski to Sea Race between Mount Baker and Maple Falls, a Memorial Day race with seven legs hosting seven events. The eastern terminus of SR 542, at Artist Point on Kulshan Ridge, is closed annually by WSDOT between October and July due to extreme weather conditions.\n\nThe Mount Baker Highway was constructed by Whatcom County in 1893 as a wagon road traveling northeast from Bellingham along the Nooksack River through Deming and Kendall to Maple Falls. The wagon road was extended from Maple Falls through Glacier to the Mt. Baker Ski Area at Heather Meadows began 1921 and ended in 1926. The Mount Baker Highway was added to the state highway system in 1925 as the Austin Pass branch of State Road 1 and was extended to its current terminus at Artist Point in 1931. The highway was closed seasonally between Glacier and Artist Point until the filming of \"The Call of the Wild\" in 1934 and 1935 prompted interest in the Mount Baker area. The Department of Highways began clearing the highway of snow during the winter of 1934 for the film and continued annually between Glacier and Heather Meadows; however, the highway was not cleared during World War II due to gasoline shortages. The highway was designated as the Austin Pass branch of PSH 1 during the creation of the primary and secondary state highways in 1937 and renumbered to SR 542 in 1964.

Casual wear became popular in the Western world following the counterculture of the 1960s. When emphasising casual wear's comfort, it may be referred to as leisurewear.\n\nWhile casual is \"informal\" in the sense of \"not formal\", informal attire traditionally refers to a Western dress code associated with suits - a step below semi-formal attire - thus being more formal than casual attire.\n\nWith the popularity of spectator sports in the late 20th century, a good deal of athletic gear has influenced casual wear, such as jogging suits, running shoes, and track clothing. Work wear worn for manual labor also falls into casual wear. Basic materials used for casual wear include denim, cotton, jersey, flannel, and fleece. Materials such as velvet, chiffon, and brocade are often associated with more formal clothes. \n\nWhile utilitarian costume comes to mind first for casual dress, however, there is also a wide range of flamboyance and theatricality. Punk fashion and fashion of the 1970s and 1980s is a striking example. Madonna introduced a great deal of lace, jewelry, and cosmetics into casual wear during the 1980s. In the 1990s, hip hop fashion played up elaborate jewelry and luxurious materials worn in conjunction with athletic gear and the clothing of manual labor.\n\nJeans, dress shirt (casually turn down collared), and a T-shirt are typically considered casual wear for men in modern times. \n\nCasual wear is typically the dress code in which forms of gender expression are experimented with. An obvious example is masculine jewelry, which was once considered shocking or titillating even in casual circles, and is now hardly noteworthy in semi-formal situations. Amelia Bloomer introduced trousers of a sort for women as a casual alternative to formal hoops and skirts. The trend toward female exposure in the 20th century tended to push the necklines of formal ball gowns lower and the skirts of cocktail dresses higher. For men, the exposure of shoulders, thighs, and backs is still limited to casual wear.\n"}

The city is also known as “la puerta de entrada al Pantanal”, or entrance to the Pantanal region.\n\nFuerte Olimpo is on east of Chaco Boreal on east shore of Paraguay River near the mouth of Blanco River, to the north the moist ground called humedales from the Gran Pantanal. Fuerte Olimpo is far away from the flood area. \nThe city is surrounded by a wall 4 km long.\n\nThis plain is almost 300 metres above the sea level. The soil is good for farming and cattle raising. Laguna Capitán is a lagoon in Fuerte Olimpo.\nFuerte Olimpo is between two hills, in one is Fuerte Bordón and in the other one is Maria Auxiliadora Cathedral.\nThe hill 3 hermanos are elevations of the region, on top of the middle cerro palms of karanday can be seen and also the moist ground of the Pantanal Nabileque and Sierra de Bordón in Brazil.\n\nThe weather is tropical, temperature is around in summer, and the minimum in winter. The average is . Long droughts followed by strong rains are important characteristics of the region.\n\nFuerte Olimpo is a city with 4998 inhabitants, 2585 men and 2413 women, according to the Census.\n\nThe city was founded by Spain in 1792 named Fuerte Borbón by the Governor Joaquín Alos y Bru, who sent the Commandant José Antonio de Zavala y Delgadillo, to protect the area from the Virreinato del Río de la Plata from the bandeirantes from Brazil. The first settlement was between the Brazilian Forte Porto Carrero and Fecho dos Morros. Caciques Mbayaes were invited for the foundation.\n\nDuring José Gaspar Rodríguez de Francia government it was called Fuerte Olimpo, maybe because of the main Cerro (hill) which was said to resemble Mount Olimpus in ancient Greece. At that time Paraguayan sovereignty established a free port for Brazilian trading.\n\nAt the beginning of Paraguayan War (1865–1870) it was a very important offensive spot in the Mato Grosso, in 1866 Fuerte Olimpo was a strategic place too but it was taken by Brazilians when the campaign ended. Originally, Argentina wanted to own from Fuerte Olimpo to Chaco Boreal to the Bahía Negra, but when Brazil left Paraguay, Argentina did not claim it.\n\nAfter the 1870s the area belonged to large landowners who chopped the quebrechales having native people work as slaves, that period was called tannin cycle, it was the beginning of some industries, forests were destroyed and the place was used for cattle raising good for the kind of weather. Another important aspect was the industries of tiles, palm and bricks. So Fuerte Olimpo became a port for exportation. During the Chaco war in the 1930s Fuerte Olimpo was again an important place for offensive strategies.\n\nIt includes some ports:\n14 de Mayo,\nEsperanza,\nLeda,\nLida, and\nMaria Elena.\n\nThe main activity is cattle raising.\n\nBoats and canoes are the main important means of transportation to get to Fuerte Olimpo. People travel in the riverboat Aquidabán, which goes from Concepción to Bahía Negra.\nAnother way to go there is going Route 9 “The Transchaco highway” to “Cruce Pioneros”, at km. 409, there is no paved route to get to Fuerte Olimpo.\nYou can also get to Loma Plata, at km 444 and there is no paved route until km. 333.\nThere is also a landing runway for small planes.\n\nYou can also ride some motor launches on the Paraguay River to enjoy the wonderful flora and fauna of the region. There are some tourist guides.\n\n\n\n"}

It was written by Paul Vance and Lee Pockriss and first released in June 1960 by Brian Hyland, with orchestra conducted by John Dixon. The Hyland version reached number one on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, selling a million copies in the US, and was a worldwide hit. The song has been adapted into French as \"Itsy bitsy petit bikini\" and into German as \"Itsy Bitsy Teenie Weenie Honolulu-Strand-Bikini\", reaching number one on national charts in both languages. Several versions of the song have proved successful in various European countries. In 1990 a version by British pop band Bombalurina, titled \"Itsy Bitsy Teeny Weeny Yellow Polka Dot Bikini\", reached number one on the UK Singles Chart and in Ireland.\n\nThe story told through the three verses of the song is as follows: (1) the young lady is too afraid to leave the locker where she has changed into her bikini; (2) she has made it to the beach but sits on the sand wrapped in a blanket; and (3) she has finally gone into the ocean, but is too afraid to come out, and stays immersed in the water – despite the fact that she's \"turning blue\" – to hide herself from view.\n\nTrudy Packer recited the phrases \"...two, three, four / Tell the people what she wore\", heard at the end of each verse before the chorus; and \"Stick around, we'll tell you more\", heard after the first chorus and before the start of the second verse.\n\nIn an interview and article by Greg Ehrbar in \"The Cartoon Music Book\", edited by Daniel Goldmark and Yuval Taylor, Rankin-Bass musical director Maury Laws said he 'ghosted' the arrangement of the song for John Dixon, as Dixon had taken on more work than he could handle at that time.\n\nAt a time when bikini bathing suits were still seen as too risqué to be mainstream, the song prompted a sudden take off in bikini sales and is credited as being one of the earliest contributors to the acceptance of the bikini in society. The early 1960s saw a slew of surf movies and other film and television productions that rapidly built on the song's momentum.\n\nHyland's version hit number one on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 on August 8, 1960 and sold over a million copies in the US. It also made the top 10 in other countries, including #8 on the UK Singles Chart. It also reached #1 in New Zealand.\n\nIn September 2006 Paul Vance, the song's co-writer, read on TV his own mistaken obituary, as a consequence of the death of another man, Paul Van Valkenburgh, who claimed to have written \"Itsy Bitsy Teenie Weenie Yellow Polkadot Bikini\" under the name Paul Vance. The impostor had explained his lack of royalty payments for the song by claiming that he had sold the rights as a teenager. Vance, the song's true co-author, has earned several million dollars from the song since 1960, describing it as \"a money machine.\"\n\nThe song was featured in the 1961 Billy Wilder film comedy \"One, Two, Three\" – in a key scene, the character Otto (Horst Buchholz), suspected of being a spy, is being tortured by East German police playing the song to him repetitively, eventually with the record off-center to create a weird howling variation of pitch. The actual recording was re-released in 1962 to capitalize on the film's success, but it did not rechart.\n\nThe song is also used in films such as the 1981 Aparna Sen film \"36 Chowringhee Lane\" as well as \"Sister Act 2\" and \"\".\n\nThe song was going to be one of the tracks for \"Just Dance 2017\", but was removed for an unknown reason. However, it has made an appearance on its sequel \"Just Dance 2018\", performed by The Sunlight Shakers.\n\nThe song was adapted into French under the title \"Itsy bitsy petit bikini\" by André Salvet and Lucien Morisse. The French version was recorded in 1960 first by Dalida and then by Johnny Hallyday and Richard Anthony (Dalida also recorded a version in Italian titled \"Pezzettini di bikini\"). Sales of all three French versions as well as Brian Hyland's English version were combined and reached number one in Wallonia (French-speaking Belgium), charting for nine months from September 1, 1960 to May 1, 1961.\n\nA version by the animated character Funny Bear also reached the top 30 in France in 2007.\n\nRichard Anthony's version of \"Itsy bitsy petit bikini\" appears in the 2006 film \"A Good Year\".\n\n7\" single Barclay 70345 (1960)\n\n7\" single Vogue V. 45-775 (1960)\n\nIn Germany the song was renamed \"Itsy Bitsy Teenie Weenie Honolulu-Strand-Bikini\" and with German lyrics written by Rudolf Günter Loose.

In 2003 West recorded another version of the song with Band Zonder Banaan which reached number 36.\n\nIn 1990, a version was released by Bombalurina, titled \"Itsy Bitsy Teeny Weeny Yellow Polka Dot Bikini\", which featured Timmy Mallett, star of \"Wacaday\", a popular UK children's television show of the time, along with two dancers, Dawn Andrews and Annie Dunkley. Andrews later married Gary Barlow of the group Take That. Mallett told the British pop magazine \"Smash Hits\" that the composer of popular theatre musicals Andrew Lloyd Webber had come up with the idea for making the single, and had asked Mallett to sing on it. The day after recording the song, Mallett took a copy of it on a tour of European clubs where he was making personal appearances, and asked the clubs' DJs to play the song, raising public awareness of the record. In November 2008, schoolteacher and former singer Everton Barnes claimed that he was the real singer on the record, as Mallett had been unable to hit the right notes and sung flat.\n\nThe song was released on Carpet Records, a subsidiary of Andrew Lloyd Webber's Really Useful Group, and Lloyd Webber later admitted that he had produced the song because his wife had bet him that as a composer of musical theatre, he would not be able to make a pop song that was a big hit. The band name \"Bombalurina\" was taken from the name of one of the characters in Lloyd Webber's musical \"Cats\".\n\nThe song reached number one on the UK Singles Chart on August 19, 1990 and was certified silver for sales of 250,000 copies. The single also reached number one in Ireland, and the top ten in several other countries.\n\nThere have been cover versions in many languages.\n\n\n"}

The pavilion, dating from before 1400, was a national monument that had been spared destruction many times throughout history, and the arson shocked Japan.\n\nThe protagonist, Mizoguchi, is the son of a consumptive Buddhist priest who lives and works on the remote Cape Nariu on the north coast of Honshū. As a child, the narrator lives with his uncle at the village of Shiraku (師楽), near Maizuru.\n\nThroughout his childhood he is assured by his father that the Golden Pavilion is the most beautiful building in the world, and the idea of the temple becomes a fixture in his imagination. A stammering boy from a poor household, he is friendless at his school, and takes refuge in vengeful fantasies. When a naval cadet who is visiting the school makes fun of him, he vandalises the cadet's belongings behind his back. A neighbour's girl, Uiko, becomes the target of his hatred, and when she is killed by her deserter boyfriend after she betrays him, Mizoguchi becomes convinced that his curse on her has been fulfilled.\n\nHis ill father takes him to the Kinkaku-ji for the first time in the spring of 1944, and introduces him to the Superior, Tayama Dosen. After his father's death, Mizoguchi becomes an acolyte at the temple. It is the height of the war, and there are only three acolytes, but one is his first real friend, the candid and pleasant Tsurukawa. During the 1944–5 school year, he boards at the Rinzai Academy's middle school and works at a factory, fascinated by the idea that the Golden Pavilion will inevitably be burnt to ashes in the firebombing. But the American planes avoid Kyoto, and his dream of a glorious tragedy is defeated. In May 1945, he and Tsurukawa visit Nanzen-ji. From the tower, they witness a strange scene in a room of the Tenju-an nearby: a woman in a formal kimono gives her lover a cup of tea to which she adds her own breast milk.\n\nAfter his father dies of consumption, he is sent to Kinkaku-ji. On the first anniversary of his father's death, his mother visits him, bringing the mortuary tablet so that the Superior can say Mass over it. She tells him that she has moved from Nariu to Kasagun, and reveals her wish that he should succeed Father Dosen as Superior at Rokuon-ji. The two ambitions—that the temple be destroyed, or that it should be his to control—leave him confused and ambivalent. On hearing the news of the end of the war and the Emperor's renunciation of divinity, Father Dosen calls his acolytes and tells them the fourteenth Zen story from \"The Gateless Gate\", \"Nansen kills a kitten\", which leaves them bemused. Mizoguchi is bitterly disappointed by the end of hostilities, and late at night he climbs the hill behind the temple, Okitayama-Fudosan, looks down on the lights of Kyoto, and pronounces a curse: \"Let the darkness of my heart [...] equal the darkness of the night which encloses those countless lights!\"\n\nDuring the winter of that year, the Temple is visited by a drunk American soldier and his pregnant Japanese girlfriend. He pushes his girlfriend down into the snow, and orders Mizoguchi to trample her stomach, giving him two cartons of cigarettes in exchange for doing so. Mizoguchi goes indoors and obsequiously presents the cartons to the Superior, who is having his head shaved by the deacon. Father Dosen thanks him, and tells him he has been chosen for the scholarship to Otani University. A week later the girl visits the temple, tells her story, and demands compensation for the miscarriage she has suffered. The Superior gives her money and says nothing to the acolytes, but rumours of her claims spread, and the people at the temple become uneasy about Mizoguchi. Throughout 1946 he is tormented by the urge to confess, but never does so, and in the spring of 1947 he leaves with Tsurukawa for Otani University. He starts to drift away from Tsurukawa, befriending Kashiwagi, a cynical clubfooted boy from Sannomiya who indulges in long \"philosophical\" speeches.\n\nKashiwagi boasts of his ability to seduce women by making them feel sorry for him—in his words, they \"fall in love with my clubfeet.\" He demonstrates his method to Mizoguchi by feigning a tumble in front of a girl. She helps him into her house. Mizoguchi is so disturbed that he runs away, and takes a train to the Kinkaku-ji to recover his self-assurance. In May, Kashiwagi invites him to a \"picnic\" at Kameyama Park, taking the girl he tricked, and another girl for Mizoguchi. When left alone with the girl, she tells him a story about a woman she knows who lost her lover during the war. He realises that the woman she is talking about must be the same one he saw two years before through a window of Tenju Hermitage. Mizoguchi's mind fills with visions of the Golden Pavilion, and he finds himself impotent. That evening a telegram arrives at the university bearing news of kindly Tsurukawa's death in a road accident. For nearly a year, Mizoguchi avoids Kashiwagi's company.\n\nIn the spring of 1948 Kashiwagi comes to visit him at the temple, and gives him a \"shakuhachi\" as a present. He takes the opportunity to demonstrate his own skill as a player. In May he asks Mizoguchi to steal some irises and cat-tails for him from the temple garden. Mizoguchi takes them to Kashiwagi's boarding-house, and while discussing the story of Nansen and the kitten, Kashiwagi starts to make an arrangement, mentioning that he is being taught \"ikebana\" by his girlfriend. Mizoguchi realises that this girlfriend must be the woman he saw at Tenju Hermitage. When she arrives, Kashiwagi breaks up with her, and they quarrel. She runs away and Mizoguchi follows, telling her that he witnessed her tragic scene two years ago. She is moved, and tries to seduce him, but again he is assailed by visions of the temple, and he is impotent.\n\nIn January 1949 Mizoguchi is walking through Shinkyogoku when he thinks he sees Father Dosen with a geisha. Momentarily distracted, he starts to follow a stray dog, loses it, and then in a back alley he runs into the Superior just as he is getting into a hired car with the geisha. He is so surprised that he laughs out loud, and Father Dosen calls him a fool. Over the next two months Mizoguchi becomes obsessed with reproducing Dosen's brief expression of hatred. He buys a photograph of the geisha and slips it into Dosen's morning newspaper. The Superior gives no sign of having found it, but secretly places the photo in Mizoguchi's drawer the next day. When Mizoguchi finds it there, he feels victorious. He tears it up, wraps the shreds in newspaper with a stone, and sinks it in the pond.\n\nAs Mizoguchi's mental illness worsens, he neglects his studies. On 9 November 1949, the Superior reprimands him for his poor work. Mizoguchi responds by borrowing ¥3000 from Kashiwagi, who characteristically raises ¥500 of the money by taking back and selling the flute and dictionary he had given as presents. He goes to Takeisao-jinja (a shrine also known as Kenkun-jinja) and draws a \"mikuji\" lot which warns him not to travel northwest. He sets off northwest the next morning, to the region of his birth, and spends three days at Yura (now Tangoyura), where the sight of the Sea of Japan inspires him to destroy the Kinkaku.\n\nHe is retrieved by a policeman, and on his return he is met by his angry mother, who is relieved to learn that he did not steal the money he used to flee. Obsessed by the idea of arson, one day he follows a guilty-looking boy to the Sammon Gate of the Myōshin-ji, and is amazed and disappointed when the boy does not set it alight. He compiles a long list of old temples which have burnt down. By May his debt (with 10% simple interest per month) has grown to ¥5100. Kashiwagi is angry, and comes to suspect that Mizoguchi is considering suicide. On 10 June Kashiwagi complains to Father Dosen, who gives him the principal; afterwards, Kashiwagi shows letters to Mizoguchi that reveal the fact that Tsurukawa did not die in a road accident, but committed suicide over a love affair. He hopes to discourage Mizoguchi from doing anything similar. For the last time, they discuss the Zen story of Nansen and the kitten.\n\nOn 15 June, Father Dosen takes the unusual step of giving Mizoguchi ¥4250 in cash for his next year's tuition. Mizoguchi spends it on prostitutes in the hope that Dosen will be forced to expel him. But he quickly tires of waiting for Dosen to find out, and when he spies on Dosen in the Tower of the North Star, and sees him crouched in the \"garden waiting\" position, he cannot account for this evidence of secret shame, and is filled with confusion. The next day he buys arsenic and a knife at a shop near Senbon-Imadegawa, an intersection 2 km to the southeast of the temple, and loiters outside Nishijin Police Station. The outbreak of the Korean War on 25 June, and the failure of Kinkaku's fire-alarm on 29 June, seem to him signs of encouragement. On 30 June a repairman tries to fix it, but he is unsuccessful, and promises to return the next day. He does not come. A strange interview with the visiting Father Kuwai Zenkai, of Ryuho-ji in Fukui Prefecture, provides the final inspiration, and in the early hours of 2 July Mizoguchi sneaks into the Kinkaku and dumps his belongings, placing three straw bales in corners of the ground floor. He goes outside to sink some non-inflammable items in the pond, but on turning back to the temple he finds himself filled with his childhood visions of its beauty, and he is overcome by uncertainty.\n\nFinally he remembers the words from the \"Rinzairoku\", \"When you meet the Buddha, kill the Buddha\", and he resolves to go ahead with his plan. He enters the Kinkaku and sets the bales on fire. He runs upstairs and tries to enter the Kukkyōchō, but the door is locked. He hammers at the door for a minute or two. Suddenly feeling that a glorious death has been \"refused\" him, he runs back downstairs and out of the temple, choking on the smoke. He continues running, out of the temple grounds, and up the hill named Hidari Daimonji, to the north. He throws away the arsenic and knife, lights a cigarette, watches the pavilion burn, and thinks that \n\"I will live\".\n\n\n\n\nThe only detailed information in English on the arson comes from Albert Borowitz's \"Terrorism For Self-Glorification: The Herostratos Syndrome\" (2005), which includes translations of interview transcripts published in the book \"Kinkaku-ji Enjō\" (1979) by Mizukami Tsutomo, a novelist who had known the boy at school.\n\nThe acolyte's name was Hayashi Yōken, and the Superior's name was Murakami Jikai. The prostitute to whom he boasted was called Heya Teruko. Hayashi's mother threw herself in front of a train soon after the event. His sentence was reduced on account of his schizophrenia; he was released on 29 September 1955, the same year that the rebuilding commenced, and died in March 1956. (Borowitz comments that many accounts avoid giving the acolyte's name, perhaps to prevent him from becoming a celebrity.) The pavilion's interior paintings were restored much later; even the gold leaf, which was mostly all gone long before 1950, was replaced.\n\nMishima collected all the information he could, even visiting Hayashi in prison, and as a result the novel follows the real situation with surprising closeness.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Prior to RFD, individuals living in remote homesteads had to pick up mail themselves at sometimes distant post offices or pay private carriers for delivery (this fee was in addition to the postage paid by the mailer). RFD became a political football, with politicians promising it to voters and using it themselves to reach voters.\n\nThe proposal to offer free rural delivery was not universally embraced. Private carriers and local shopkeepers feared a loss of business. The United States Post Office Department began experiments with Rural Free Delivery as early as 1890. However, it was not until 1893 that Georgia Representative Thomas E. Watson pushed through legislation that mandated the practice. However, universal implementation was slow; RFD was not adopted generally in the United States Post Office until 1902. The rural delivery service has used a network of rural routes traveled by carriers to deliver mail to and pick it up from roadside mailboxes.\nUntil the late 19th century, residents of rural areas had to travel to a distant post office to pick up their mail or to pay for delivery by a private carrier. Postmaster General John Wanamaker, owner of a major department store, was ardently in favor of Rural Free Delivery (RFD), with many thousands of Americans living in rural communities who wanted to send and receive retail orders inexpensively.\n\nHowever, the adoption of a nationwide RFD system had many opponents. Some were simply opposed to the cost of the service. Private express carriers thought inexpensive rural mail delivery would eliminate their business, and many town merchants worried the service would reduce farm families' weekly visits to town to obtain goods and merchandise or that mail order merchants selling through catalogs, such as Sears, Roebuck and Company, might present significant competition.\n\nSupport for the introduction of a nationwide rural mail delivery service came from The National Grange of the Order of Patrons of Husbandry, the nation's oldest agricultural organization.\n\nFayette County in east-central Indiana claims to be the birthplace of Rural Free Delivery. Milton Trusler, a leading farmer in the county, began advocating the idea in 1880; as the president of the Indiana Grange, he spoke to farmers statewide frequently over the following sixteen years.\n\nThe Post Office Department first experimented with the idea of rural mail delivery on October 1, 1891 to determine the viability of RFD. It began with five routes covering ten miles, 33 years after free delivery in cities had begun. The first routes to receive RFD during its experimental phase were in Jefferson County, West Virginia, near Charles Town, Halltown, and Uvilla.\n\nLegislation by US Representative Thomas E. Watson of Georgia mandated the practice, and RFD finally became an official service in 1896. That year, 82 rural routes were put into operation. A massive undertaking, nationwide RFD service took several years to implement, and remains the \"biggest and most expensive endeavor\" ever instituted by the U.S. postal service.\n\nThe service has grown steadily. By 1901, the mileage had increased to over 100,000; the cost was $1,750,321 and over 37,000 carriers were employed. In 1910, the mileage was 993,068; the cost was $36,915,000, and 40,997 carriers were employed. In 1913 came the introduction of parcel post delivery, which caused another boom in rural deliveries. Parcel post service allowed the distribution of national newspapers and magazines, and was responsible for millions of dollars of sales in mail-order merchandise to customers in rural areas. In 1930, 43,278 rural routes served about 6,875,321 families, about 25,471,735 persons, at a cost of $106,338,341. In 1916, the Rural Post \"Good\" Roads Act authorized federal funds for rural post roads.\n\nThe following is a list of the first rural routes established in each state, along with the names of the (up to three) post offices served and the date of establishment.\n\n\n"}

The team was commercially sponsored, but was also partly funded by the Basque Government until the end of 2013, with riders either from the Basque Country, Navarre, La Rioja, Cantabria and the French Basque Country, or who had grown up in the cycling culture of those regions: This policy was abandoned to enable retention of World Tour status. Its sponsor was Euskaltel, a Basque telecom company. Euskaltel–Euskadi was famous for its all-orange team kits. Whenever the Tour de France passed through the Basque Country many spectators lined the route dressed in the team's orange or the colours of the Basque flag.\nThe Euskaltel team also has a second team inside the \"Fundacion Euskadi\", this team rode in a continental category, the name of the team was Orbea. This team was created with the aim of forming the young cyclist before going to the Euskaltel–Euskadi.\n\nFollowing the creation of the Euskadi Cycling Foundation (June 1993), Euskadi was established in 1994 (as Euskadi-Petronor), and has been recognizable among the peloton for their bright orange kit (which developed later in the team's history). After a financially turbulent first few seasons, in which the team was on the brink of folding multiple times, they secured their long term and most successful sponsor Euskaltel. By 1999, with Roberto Laiseka winning the team's first Grand Tour stage win this investment had paid off. In 2001 they were invited to the Tour de France and achieved another victory for Laiseka in the Pyrénées.\n\nAfter a 2003 Tour de France breakthrough success during which both Iban Mayo and Haimar Zubeldia finished in the top-10 of the general classification, with Mayo winning the prized Alpe d'Huez stage. Euskaltel–Euskadi was considered to be a strong contender for the 2004 Tour de France as well. Iban Mayo's commanding victory in the 2004 Critérium du Dauphiné Libéré stage race (traditionally seen as one of the tests for Tour de France contenders), including defeating Lance Armstrong in the Mont Ventoux hill climb individual time trial stage, further fueled the hype. Unfortunately, Mayo was injured in a crash on a \"pavé\" section of an early stage of the Tour de France, and abandoned in the first Pyrénées stage. Zubeldia also failed to deliver in the 2004 Tour de France, to the chagrin of Basque fans lining the road. \"\"I wish that our uniform was not so easy to spot,\"\" admitted directeur sportif Julián Gorospe.\n\nIn the 2005 season the team recruited Aitor González, who won the Tour de Suisse. They again failed to make an impression in the 2005 Tour de France. In 2006 the sporting director Julián Gorospe was replaced by Igor González de Galdeano, who became technical secretary. Euskaltel–Euskadi ranked 13th in the UCI World Tour rankings among 18 teams, but only the top 15 teams automatically qualify for the World Tour for the following year \"\". The other teams qualify based on a variety of criteria, including team points and a dedication to clean racing, but the most important are points earned by individual riders.\n\nUnder points pressure, Euskaltel confirmed in 2012 that it would break with its long-standing policy of signing a majority of Basque riders and would employ riders of other countries to assure its UCI World Tour standing. This has had knock on effects for the makeup of other traditionally Basque teams such as Orbea and Caja Rural. For example, in the 2013 season Euskaltel's Amets Txurruka and Iván Velasco moved to .\n\nThe withdrawal of sponsorship via government funds prompted the team to announce it would be unable to continue after the 2013 season. In September 2013 Formula One racing driver Fernando Alonso expressed a wish to ensure the team's survival by buying their UCI World Tour license but reached no agreement with the team.\nIn 2018 Mikel Landa, the President of the Euskadi Cycling Foundation, established Team Fundación Euskadi on the Continental tour. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Upon the dissolution of the marriage, she retired to religious life.\n\nMafalda of Portugal was born around 1195, the daughter of King Sancho I of Portugal and his queen, Dulce of Aragon.\n\nOn the death of her father, Mafalda, under the provisions of his will, was to receive the Seia Castle and the remaining portion of the municipality as well as all income produced there. Furthermore, she was granted the right to use the title of queen. This created a conflict with her brother Afonso II \"O Gordo\", who, wanting a centralized power, hindered his sister from receiving the titles and the corresponding rights. Afonso feared that something similar could happen with his two sisters, Teresa and Sancha, and their eventual heirs, creating a problem of sovereignty that could come to divide the country. Much of the Portuguese nobles sided with Mafalda and her sisters, but they were defeated. On the death of Afonso II, his son Sancho II granted some lands and castles to his aunts but he made them renounce the title of princess-queen. The final peace came in 1223.\n\nIn 1215, a political marriage was arranged between Mafalda and her young cousin Henry I of Castile. As he was about ten years old, the marriage was never consummated, and it was dissolved the following year on grounds of consanguinity.\nShe returned to Portugal.\n\nMafalda then entered the Abbey of Arouca, which had adopted the Cistercian observance, but was granted a special dispensation to retain control of her inheritance.

Her childhood was not happy and her father died in 1792. In 1808 she married Jan Alois Sudiprav Rettig, a Czech patriot from a half-German speaking family. Under his influence she learned to speak and write correctly in Czech language and also started to use middle name \"Dobromila\". Rettigová was active in Czech National Revival movement, also helped to found an educational institute for girls (her main advice for the girls was to keep their husband happy no matter what). Of her 11 children only three survived into adult age. She died, aged 60, in Litomyšl.\n\nHer early literary works were mostly syrupy and sentimental texts. In 1826 Rettigová published her legendary recipe book called \"A Household Cookery Book or A Treatise on Meat and Fasting Dishes for Bohemian and Moravian Lasses\" (\"Domácí kuchařka aneb Pojednání o masitých a postních pokrmech pro dcerky české a moravské\"). This book became a 19th-century bestseller and for a long time remained the only cookery book written in Czech. Rettigová continued to improve the book with culinary experiments.\n\nThe cookbook is well known until today though most of its recipes, high on fat and carbohydrates, don't fit with modern lifestyle. The book is still being reprinted and a copy can be found in libraries of many Czech households.\n\n"}

{"id": "2227179", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2227179", "title": "A Beautiful Lie", "text": "A Beautiful Lie\n\nA Beautiful Lie is the second studio album by American alternative rock band Thirty Seconds to Mars, released on August 30, 2005 through Virgin Records. It was produced by Josh Abraham.\n\n\"A Beautiful Lie\" differs notably from the band's self-titled debut album, both musically and lyrically. Whereas the eponymous concept album's lyrics focus on human struggle and astronomical themes, \"A Beautiful Lie\"s lyrics are \"personal and less cerebral\". It is the first to feature guitarist Tomo Miličević and the only one to feature bassist Matt Wachter, who left the band in 2007. The album produced four singles, \"Attack\", \"The Kill\", \"From Yesterday\", and \"A Beautiful Lie\"; of which three of those four singles managed to chart within the top 30 on the US Modern Rock chart, with \"The Kill\" and \"From Yesterday\" entering the top three.\n\n\"A Beautiful Lie\" received positive reviews from music critics, many praising the album for diverging from the sound of the band's previous work. The success of the album had helped the band receive accolades for their singles such as \"The Kill\" and \"From Yesterday\".\n\n\"A Beautiful Lie\" was recorded on four different continents in five different countries over a three-year period to accommodate lead singer Jared Leto's acting career. The album's title track, as well as three other songs, were composed in Cape Town, South Africa, where Leto was later met by his bandmates to work on the tracks. It was during this time that Leto conceived the album's title. Prior to this, the album was tentatively to be released under the title \"Battle of One\". It was leaked onto peer-to-peer file sharing networks almost five months before its scheduled release; the version of the album that leaked was unmastered. Because of this, the band was forced to set back the album's release date.\n\nTo promote \"A Beautiful Lie\", Thirty Seconds to Mars included the songs \"Battle of One\" and \"Hunter\" (originally performed by Björk) as bonus tracks. \"Golden passes\" were also included with three of the special versions of the album that entitled the buyer free entrance and backstage access to any Thirty Seconds to Mars show for the rest of their formation.\n\n\"A Beautiful Lie\" sold 21,000 copies in its first week of release in the US and has gone on to sell more than 1.2 million copies in the US alone.\n\nOn November 26, 2006 a special edition of \"A Beautiful Lie\" was released and features different artwork, a third bonus track (all versions have at least two); the UK version of the song \"The Kill\" entitled \"The Kill (Rebirth)\", and a DVD that features the music video for \"The Kill\", the making of the video for \"The Kill\", live performances and MTV2 moments involving the band.\n\nBefore production of the Deluxe Edition, the band requested that the members of the \"Echelon\" send in their names so that they could be thanked for their support over the years. As a result, the inside cover(s) of the Deluxe Edition contain a large list of printed fan names. In addition to this, the front cover contains a lenticular image consisting of the Mithra (phoenix) and the Trinity (skulls).\n\n\"A Beautiful Lie\" was re-released on November 26, 2007, following extensive touring throughout Europe, in an attempt to expose themselves to a larger audience. The re-release is essentially the same as the original release, although includes different artwork. The album was re-released in Ireland again in November 2007, the version contains the UK version of \"The Kill\" and a second bonus track, and an acoustic version of the song \"A Beautiful Lie\" recorded live on a radio session.\n\n\"A Beautiful Lie\" received generally positive reviews from music critics. Jon Wiederhorn from \"Revolver\" noted that \"intensity and passion clearly inform the textural hard rock of \"A Beautiful Lie\",\" which \"boasts echoing riffs, moody bass lines, and strong vocal melodies that evoke a radio-friendly mix of Staind, Nine Inch Nails, U2, and The Cure.\" Jaan Uhelszki of the \"San Francisco Chronicle\" described the album as \"full of ferocious electronics, overcaffeinated guitar lines and anxious drumming paired with brainy, brittle but emotionally austere lyrics.\" \"Nylon\" magazine called it \"an album that is digestible without losing the rough-around-the-edges appeal that the band's rapidly expanding fan base crave.\" Alternative Addiction commented that the band recorded \"an album with a handful of very impressive tracks,\" beginning with \"Attack\", the first song on the record, which \"soars sonically with processing mixed and forceful vocals.\"\n\nChrista L. Titus from \"Billboard\" felt that the band \"proved its potency\" with songs like \"The Kill\", \"Was It a Dream?\", and \"From Yesterday\", and praised Leto's vocal ability by writing, \"[he] alternates between cathartic shouts and a tantalizing croon that shows his capable vocal range.\" Kaj Roth from \"Melodic\" praised the sonic variety and summarized the record as \"an impressive list of anthemic rock songs.\" Davey Boy of Sputnikmusic echoed this sentiment, writing that \"A Beautiful Lie\" \"works well as an album due to greater variety\". He also found the record \"a more controlled effort\" than the band's debut album \"30 Seconds to Mars\" (2002). \"Kerrang!\" magazine called it a \"great album to close your eyes and fall in to, an anthemic eruption of upfront emotion.\"\n\nIn a mixed review, Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic wrote that the \"band floats out of time, inspired heavily by '90s alt rock but too clean, heavy, and facile to truly be part of that tradition, yet too indebted to the past to sound like part of the 2000s, either.\" He found the band \"capable enough at shifting from tense quiet verses to piledriving, heavy choruses, but they borrow the worst habits from all their favorite groups, and then assemble them in insufferably earnest fashion, playing clichés as if they were revelations.\" Christian Hoard of \"Rolling Stone\" stated, \"[d]espite some credible modern-rock tunes, Leto's self-involved myopia guarantees that his band's second disc is long on melodrama.\"\n\nAt the Billboard Music Awards, \"The Kill\" and \"From Yesterday\" were nominated in the category of Modern Rock Single of the Year in 2006 and 2007, respectively. In 2007, \"A Beautiful Lie\" was named Best Album by \"Rock on Request\". Thirty Seconds to Mars received the Kerrang! Award for Best Single in two consecutive years for \"The Kill\" and \"From Yesterday\" in 2007 and 2008. \"Metal Edge\" ranked \"A Beautiful Lie\" one of the top 10 albums of 2005. \"Melodic\" included it among the best albums of the year. Alternative Addiction ranked it at number six on their list of 20 best albums of the year. In 2009, \"Kerrang!\" listed \"A Beautiful Lie\" at number four on their list of the 50 best albums of the decade. The album was included in \"Rock Sound\"s 101 Modern Classics list at number 78.\n\nCredits adapted from \"A Beautiful Lie\" album liner notes.\nThirty Seconds to Mars\n\nAdditional musicians\nProduction\n"}

Before the formation of the Comarca in 1997, Chichica was in the province of Chiriquí in the Republic of Panama. The Comarca is divided into three regions: Ňö Kribo, Nedrini, and Kadri. Each of these is divided into districts, and the districts are divided into \"corregimientos\", or townships per the Panamanian system. Chichica is located in the region Kadri, District Münä, and corregimiento of Chichica.\n\nThe Comarca Ngäbe-Buglé is characterized by mountainous terrain, steep slopes, and generally nutrient poor soil with high rock content, all characteristics that make farming difficult. This is interesting because agriculture and subsistence farming are the main forms of work in the Comarca. On the Caribbean slope there is no dry season and tropical forest dominates the landscape; on the Pacific slope there is a windy dry season (December to April) and a wet season. As a result of increased seasonal variation, there are more localized geographies on the Pacific slope and vegetation consists of grasses mixed with tropical forest cover. Small perennial streams and larger rivers run on both sides of the continental divide and are used for bathing, laundry, and drinking. In the region most travel is done on foot or horseback, however in the community of Chichica year-round road access is available.\n\nThe topography of Chichica is dominated by ridges and valleys, where the concentration of population is along the ridges extending into the valleys. The main town of Chichica is more contiguous as neighborhoods expand or as older neighborhoods grow from water sources in the valleys toward the main ridge. To the North is the Cordillera, or central spine of mountains, that split Panama in North and South halves. To the South are the Pacific Ocean and the coastal plain – making Chichica in the Pacific slope climate. Chichica and its corregimiento does not touch the Cordillera or the Pacific Ocean, however these two topographical/geological formations play heavily into the climate, transportation, diet, and daily lives of the people of Chichica.\n\nThe city of Chichica is located 8.4 miles (13.5 kilometers) North of Tolé in direct line of travel. On roads, Chichica is 15.7 miles (25.2 kilometers) North of Tolé. Using public transportation, which can be picked up at the \"piquera\", or bus stop, in Tolé, it takes between 45 minutes and 1 hour to reach Chichica. Using private transportation, which 4x4 is necessary, the time can be cut in half. Its primary road is oriented in a Southwesterly to Northeasterly direction on top of a ridge. The initial rise into Chichica from the river – Río Culebra – and stream – Quebrada Otoe – is Northwest to Southeast. Lastly, in the neighborhood of Cuatro Pinos, the road changes to a direct North/South orientation.\n\nAs you drive into Chichica from Tolé, the first neighborhood is El Retiero – which is located on the initial incline into Chichica, until the road changes to its SW/NE direction. At this point, there is a trail on your right that leads to the neighborhood of Cerro Plata – a 45 minute walk from the Chichica schools. As you continue forward into Chichica, the neighborhood of La Loma will be to your left, before you reach the store “La Tiendita.” La Loma continues down the hill and wraps behind the school where it meets up with the neighborhood of Las Naranjas. The main part of town that runs from “La Tiendita” to the Health Center is called Chichica Centro or just Chichica. Within that space, there is a small path that runs off to the right, in front of the Evangelical Church, to the neighborhood of La Jujuca. This neighborhood runs past the stream all the way to the large rock outcrop that looks over La Tinta Valley. This trail is also the primary trail to Las Tijeras.\n\nJust after the Health Center, there is a nondescript trail on the left to the neighborhood of La Pita – previously called Los Mangos. When the road diverges for the first time, you have reached the neighborhood of Cuatro Pinos. This neighborhood continues on both roads and stops at the large hill that descends toward Cerro Grito and Peña Blanca. The center of Cuatro Pinos, where a piquera used to exist, is at the triangle of land that divides the road the second time. This division routes the road toward Peña Blanca or toward Cerro Algadón. Lastly, if you follow the road that diverges toward Cerro Algadón, you will descend into the town of Las Lajitas. There is some disagreement about Las Lajitas being its own city or a neighborhood of Chichica; however, the consensus that has been discovered is that Las Lajitas is not part of Chichica due to gathered census data from the Panamanian Government. The main disagreement is between the age groups – older people dividing the two towns and younger people grouping Las Lajitas as a neighborhood of Chichica. There is a confusion of boundaries as well because of the conjoined aqueduct system and a cultural center of Chichica that is located in Las Lajitas.\n"}

{"id": "2227192", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2227192", "title": "Yuksom", "text": "Yuksom\n\nYuksom is a historical town in Geyzing subdivision of West Sikkim district in the Northeast Indian state of Sikkim. It was the first capital of Sikkim established in 1642 AD by Phuntsog Namgyal who was the first Chogyal (temporal and religious king) of Sikkim. The coronation site of the first monarch of Sikkim is known as the \"Throne of Norbugang\". Yuksom is where there is the Norbugang Chorten near the Norbugang throne, the place Namgyal was crowned and several monasteries and a lake. The dynastic rule of the Chogyals lasted for 333 years.\n\nThe Chogyal established the first monastery at Yuksom in Sikkim known as the Dubdi Monastery in 1701, which is part of Buddhist religious pilgrimage circuit involving the Norbugang Chorten, Pemayangtse Monastery, the Rabdentse ruins, the Sanga Choeling Monastery, the Khecheopalri Lake, and the Tashiding Monastery.\n\nFor the Bhutia tribal community of Sikkim, Yuksom has special religious and cultural significance. It has a number of famous Buddhist monasteries and historical monuments as well as ancient Gorkhas small Village. Being at the head of the Khangchendzonga National Park and as the base camp for trekking to Mt. Khangchendzonga, it has large influx of mountaineers from all parts of the world. The village people, as stake holders in biodiversity preservation of the Rathong Chu valley, where the village is situated, have played a significant role in trendsetting and promotion of eco-tourism in the area. The inhabitants of this village have most successfully adopted promotion of ecotourism not only in the region but also for other similar areas in Sikkim. Yuksom is thus considered a model village for eco-tourism.\n\nYuksom literally means the \"meeting place of the three learned monks\" as three monks who came from Tibet selected Phuntsog Namgyal as the first King of Sikkim and gave him the title Chogyal. 'Chogyal' means \"Religious King\" or \"the king who rules with righteousness\". Yuksom is also one of the sacred landscape \"Demazong\" (meaning a valley of rice) of four religious sites blessed by Guru Padmasambhava, which are considered to be the four plexuses of the human body, and Yuksom symbolically represents the 'third eye'.\nBuddhism was introduced to the state from Tibet as early as the 9th century. In Tibet, the struggle for power between the \"Yellow hats\" and the \"Red hats\" led to the latter migrating to Sikkim and converting the mild mannered local Lepchas to Buddhism. In the 13th century, relations between Sikkim and Tibet were cemented by a \"Brotherhood treaty\" signed between the Lepcha chief Thekong Thek and Tibetan prince Khe-Bhumsa at Kavi, in north Sikkim.\n\nIn 1641, Lama Lutsum Chembo travelled from Tibet to Denjong (meaning hidden country) now known as Sikkim to propagate the Buddhist religion. He was then joined by two other lamas, Sempa Chembo and Rinzing Chembo. The trinity of Lamas came from the Kham district in Tibet. Their primary aim was to perpetuate Tibetan hold on Sikkim and to propagate Buddhism in Sikkim. They assembled from different directions at Norbugang, which later came to be known as Yuksom. The area in the Rathong chu Valley at Narbugong was considered as blessed by the 9th century Guru Padmasambhava (Guru Rinpoche). In 1642 the Lamas went in pursuit of the fourth person, as the current three lamas represented three directions of North, South and West and Padmasambhava's vision had predicted the requirement for a fourth person from the east. Near present-day Gangtok, they found a man churning milk. He offered them some refreshments and gave them shelter. So impressed were they by his deeds that they realised that he was a chosen one. They also identified Phunstsog Namgyal's ancestral royal links with Tibet and decided that he was the right person to become the temporal and religious head of the region so brought him to Yuksom. They then crowned him at Norbugang near Yuksom as the temporal and religious king of Sikkim, with the title \"Chogyal\". The crowning took place at Norbugang on a pedestal set in stones, in a pine-covered hill, and he was anointed by sprinkling water from a sacred urn. At that time he was 38 years of age. He was a fifth generation descendant of Guru Tashi, a 13th-century prince from the Mi-nyak House in Kham in Eastern Tibet.\n\nThereafter, the dynastic rule of Chogyals, propagation of the Buddhist religion and building of monasteries and chortens took firm roots in Sikkim. The Namgyal monarchy of 12 kings lasted from 1642 till 1975 (333 years). Tibetan Mahayana Buddhism known as Vajrayana sect was introduced, which ultimately was recognized as the state religion of Sikkim.\n\nYuksom is a large village with a total area of situated at an average altitude of . It lies in a basin-like valley surrounded by mountain ranges. Located at the head of the Khangchendzonga National Park, it is the gateway to Mt. Khangchendzonga. A popular mountaineering trek starts from Yuksom, which is well connected by a road network with Geyzing and Gangtok.\n\nThe climate in Yuksom, which is located at a moderate altitude, is pleasant from March to June and September to November, while in the winter season, the coldest months are December and February.\n\nThe natural environmental setting of the town, ensconced amidst rich forests is further accentuated by its history, architecture and Buddhist legacy that evolved from the 17th century with Yuksom's establishment as the first capital of Sikkim. Situated at the head of Khangchenjunga National Park, the largest Protected Area in Sikkim, and at starting gate for the trekking trail to Mt. Khangchendzonga, Yuksom and its hills was named in the past as Ney-Pemathang for its beautiful landscape. The forest cover in the hills consist of broad-leaved oak, birch, maple, chestnut, magnolia, rhododendron, silver fir, ash and alder, which complement the epithet of \"biodiversity hot-spot\" given to Sikkim.\n\nThe first act that Phuntsog initiated after becoming the King was the conversion of the local Lepcha tribes to Buddhism and set about expanding his kingdom up to the Chumbi Valley in Tibet, parts of modern-day Darjeeling in the south, and parts of eastern Nepal. In this effort the three lamas also lent full support to him.\n\nPhuntsog moved his capital to Yuksom and instituted the first centralised administration. The kingdom was divided into twelve Dzongs or districts under a Lepcha Dzongpon (governor) who headed a council of twelve ministers. During his reign Buddhism was consolidated as the established religion in Sikkim. He was succeeded by his son, Tensun Namgyal in 1670. However, the importance of Yuksum as capital ended when in 1670, Phuntsok Namgyal’s son Tensung Namgyal, shifted the capital to Rabdentse.\n\nAt present, Yuksam is a heritage village in the Geyzing subdivision of West District of Sikkim. It is now an important tourist destination. It is also the starting point of the popular trek to Goechala (via Dzongri). It is the base camp of Himalayan Mountaineering Institute for treks to Mt. Khangchendzonga.\n\nYuksom is a well established village; according to 2001 census, there are 364 households in the village inhabited by 1,951 persons. However, the visiting population of tourists far exceeds the permanent population as it is on the trekking route and is also as a religious centre for Buddhists. In the village, the Bhutias and the Nepalese constitute major communities, with the Bhutia community being the dominant ethnic group. However, the service and the trading sectors are dominated by people from the plains.\n\nWith the Himalayan trekking to Khangchendzonga mountain and the Khangchendzonga National Park, centred in the Yuksom town as the base camp, the economy of the town has now become tourism centric. Consequently, the Khangchendzonga Conservation Committee (KCC) located at Yuksom, with the village community as the stakeholders, with Forest Department acting as the chief coordinating agency, have planned several innovative programmes to promote ecotourism, concurrent with encouragement of local handicrafts.\n\nThe village has well established primary and secondary schools. There are three primary schools, one junior school and a senior secondary school. Basic amenities of primary health, potable drinking water, gas and electric supply, post and telegraph office are all well established. To meet the increasing tourist inflow, infrastructure facilities such as hotels guest houses and transportation have also developed, although with attendant concerns of effect on biodiversity and ecological preservation. The environment awareness level is also very high among the village community so much so that the village is now at the core of social activists. They keep a close watch on the environmental and economic conditions in the village.\n\nThe Yuksom-Dzongri trek is a popular high altitude trek along the Rathong Chu River in West Sikkim. The trek passes through dense forests, alpine lakes and terminates at the Khangchendzonga. An ecotourism impact study of this route has been carried out jointly by the Forest Department, the Mountain Institute and the Khangchendzonga Conservation Committee (KCC), which is based in Yuksom. Considering that this route has recorded large number of visitors (mostly from England, United States, Germany, France, Australia, Netherlands and Switzerland) in the period between 1990 and 2005 (more than doubled in this period of 15 years), two main trekking seasons of March to May and September to November with October being the peak month have been noted. However, the winter months of January and February are the lean months. Based on this study, innovative additional trek routes have been planned to encourage ecotourism all through the year. The additional packages suggested are the \"Monsoon Magic\" Alpine Treks and Subtropical Winter Treks, which would promote ecotourism economy with due consideration of the carrying capacity of the region.\n\nAs sequel to the above efforts by the local community, a biodiversity festival was held at Yuksom, for one day, the first of its kind to be held in Sikkim (the second festival was held at Chungthong) by KCC, and the Forest Department of Government of Sikkim. The objective of the festival was to create awareness among the people of the villages to conserve cultural and natural heritage. This festival was attended by 200 villagers and also some foreign tourists. In the festival the focus was on pictorial exhibitions of the natural biodiversity setting and cultural heritage of the Rathong Chuu valley, the steps taken to preserve and conserve the biosphere, interest of ecotourism in the valley along the trek route Yuksom Dzongri through the Khangchendzonga National Park, diverse exhibits relating to medicine, paper making, horticulture, Khehceopalri Lake pollution and actions for its preservation, effects of deforestation and need to preserve forest wealth, measures for hill slope stability, energy efficient methods for cooking using local produce, garbage reduction, replacement and reuse, composting with biodegradable wastes, promoting traditional handicrafts and handlooms (carpets, sheep wool blankets, etc.). Puppet shows, music and local dance programmes also formed part of the festival.\n\nThe Tibetan Buddhist monastery, Dubdi Monastery, is located in the area and also the smaller Mallu Monastery. Established in 1701, Dubdi Monastery professes to be the oldest monastery in Sikkim and is located at the top of a hill about an hour's walk from Yuksom. It was also known as the Hermit's Cell after its reclusive founder Lhatsun Namkha Jigme.\n\n"}

Before \"Love Gun\" was completed, a Gallup poll indicated that Kiss was the most popular band in the United States, beating Aerosmith, Led Zeppelin and the Eagles. On August 26, 27, and 28, 1977, Kiss recorded three shows at the LA Forum for their next release, the live album \"Alive II\".\n\nThe album cover was painted by fantasy artist Ken Kelly, who previously contributed the cover for 1976's \"Destroyer\".\n\n\"I Stole Your Love\"\n\nWritten by Paul Stanley, \"I Stole Your Love\" is in the same vein as songs like \"Makin' Love\" and \"C'mon and Love Me\". Stanley has said that this song was influenced by Deep Purple's \"Burn\".\n\n\"Christine Sixteen\"\n\nThen-unknown guitarist Eddie and drummer Alex Van Halen played on the demo of this song, as well as \"Got Love for Sale\". The lyrics have a similar theme to \"Goin' Blind\" from \"Hotter Than Hell\"; both songs involve older men falling in love with younger girls. Sampled by Tone Lōc on \"Funky Cold Medina\".\n\n\"Shock Me\"\n\nThe song was inspired by an event that took place during Kiss's \"Rock and Roll Over\" tour, when Ace Frehley suffered an electric shock. On December 12, 1976, Kiss performed a concert at the Lakeland Civic Center in Lakeland, Florida. During the opening number, Frehley touched an ungrounded metal staircase railing. He was knocked to the ground, and the concert was delayed for 30 minutes. The show was eventually completed, and Frehley claimed to have lost feeling in his hand for the remainder of the concert.\n\nThis was the first lead vocal that Frehley recorded. In his autobiography, he states that he originally intended for Simmons to sing the song, but the bassist encouraged Frehley to try it himself. Frehley recorded his lead vocal part while lying on the floor of the studio, because he claimed that this helped him reach the correct pitch.\n\n\"Tomorrow and Tonight\"\n\nThe song was written to try to recapture the feeling of \"Rock and Roll All Nite\", but never reached the success of the aforementioned hit. A soundcheck recording of the song appears on \"Alive II\". The song was never played live by the band until Kiss Kruise VII in November 2017.\n\n\"Love Gun\"\n\nThe title song has been played on every Kiss tour since its release. Stanley has cited it as one of his favorite Kiss songs. It was the first song that Stanley wrote, arranged and produced in its entirety. The song shares many of its lyrics with \"The Hunter\", written by Booker T. & the M.G.'s, and recorded by Albert King, Ike and Tina Turner, Blue Cheer, and Free. In his autobiography \"Face the Music\", Stanley acknowledges the derivation: \"I stole the idea of a 'love gun' from Albert King's version of 'The Hunter,' which Zeppelin also nicked from for 'How Many More Times' on their first album.\" \n\n\"Plaster Caster\"\n\nThe song was inspired by Cynthia Plaster Caster, a former groupie famous for casting penises of famous rock musicians, such as Jimi Hendrix.\n\n\"Then She Kissed Me\"\n\nThe song is one of several gender-reversed covers of the Crystals' 1963 single \"Then He Kissed Me\".\n\n\"Love Gun\" was reissued in 1985. The reissue included the original artwork, and while it featured a plain sleeve the jacket still contained a reference for the original color sleeve. The first 10,000 pressings included an error on the labels; Track 3 on Side A was listed as Plaster Caster but actually played Got Love For Sale. Side B was completely out of order.\n\n\"Love Gun\" was remastered and reissued in 1997 as part of the Kiss Remasters series.\n\nIt was remastered and reissued again in a deluxe edition on October 28, 2014, with sleeve notes by Def Leppard's Joe Elliott and a second disc containing demos, live rarities and a 1977 interview with Gene Simmons. All tracks on the second disc were previously unreleased, bar the demo of \"Reputation\", which had appeared on the compilation \"Kiss 40\" a few months earlier. The three live tracks were recorded at the Capital Centre in Landover, Maryland on December 20, 1977. \"The potential for this to be the greatest deluxe edition of all time,\" noted music writer Geoff Barton, \"is ruined by a too-clean remastering job – plus, if truth be told, a track that has dated badly in 'Christine Sixteen'.\"\n\n\n\n\n"}

She was the fifth daughter of King Sancho I of Portugal and Dulce of Aragon. She was the mother of Danish kings Eric IV, Abel and Christopher I.\n\nBerengaria was the tenth of eleven children born to her parents. By the age of fourteen in 1212, Berengaria was an orphan; her father died in 1212, while her mother had died in 1198. In various annals and ballads she is called Bringenilæ, Bengerd, Bengjerd and related forms.\n\nBerengaria was introduced to King Valdemar through his sister, Ingeborg, the wife of King Philip II of France, another of her cousins; she was by that time at the French court, having left Portugal with her brother Ferrante in 1212.\n\nOld folk ballads say that on her deathbed, Dagmar of Bohemia, Valdemar's first wife, begged the king to marry Kirsten, the daughter of Karl von Rise and not the \"beautiful flower\" Berengaria. In other words, she predicted Berengaria's sons' fight over the throne would bring trouble to Denmark, although this is merely legend and there is no historical proof of this.\n\nValdemar’s first wife, Dagmar of Bohemia, had been immensely popular, blonde and with Nordic looks. Queen Berengaria was the opposite, described as a dark-eyed, raven-haired beauty.\n\nThe Danes made up folk songs about Berengaria and blamed her for the high taxes Valdemar levied, although the taxes went to his war efforts, not just to his wife. The great popularity of the former queen made it difficult for the new queen to gain popularity in Denmark. She is noted to have made donations to churches and convents. Berengaria was the first Danish queen known to have worn a crown, which is mentioned in the inventory of her possessions (1225).\n\nIn 1221 Berengaria, after giving birth to three future kings, died in childbirth. Queen Berengaria is buried in St. Bendt's Church in Ringsted, Denmark, on one side of Valdemar II, with Queen Dagmar buried on the other side of the King.\n\nKing Valdemar's two wives play a prominent role in Danish ballads and myths – Queen Dagmar as the soft, pious and popular ideal wife and Queen Berengaria (Bengjerd) as the beautiful and haughty woman.\n\nWhen Berengaria's grave was opened in 1885, they found her , her and finely built body bones, proving the legends about her reported beauty. A portrait drawing was made to show how she might have looked.\n\n\n"}

Owned by Iowa State University, the station covers the Des Moines metropolitan area. Broadcasting a mix of public radio and talk radio, WOI is the flagship station for Iowa Public Radio's News Network and the market member station for NPR, Public Radio International, and the BBC World Service. The WOI studios are located at Iowa State University's Communications Building, while the station transmitter resides southwest of Ames. Besides a standard analog transmission, WOI broadcasts a digital signal utilizing the HD in-band on-channel standard, is relayed over low-power Ames FM translator K234CN (104.7 FM) and is available online.\n\nHistorically, WOI is among one of the oldest radio stations in the United States, and one of the oldest surviving stations in North America, having begun experimental transmissions in 1911.\n\nThe history of WOI can be traced back to 1911 when physics professor \"Dad\" Hoffman set a transmission line between the Campus Water Tower and the Engineering Building and set up a wireless telegraph station. By 1913 this was known as experimental station 9YI and it was sending and receiving weather reports by Morse code on a regular basis. \n\nThe first sound broadcast was an hour of concert music on November 21, 1921. The Commerce Department issued a full radio license for station WOI in April 1922 and the first regular broadcast took place on April 28, 1922. The original call sign 9YI is now W0YI and is retained by the ISU Campus Radio Club, with the amateur radio station in the Electrical Engineering building.\n\nWOI may be the oldest fully licensed noncommercial station west of the Mississippi River. Another university radio station in Iowa, WSUI at the University of Iowa in Iowa City, also began telegraph transmissions in 1911 and also has claims to being the earliest educational station west of the Mississippi. Other Midwestern universities also started experimental stations in the 1910s: the University of Minnesota's KUOM and St. Louis University's WEW in 1912 and the University of Wisconsin's WHA in 1915. \n\nThe first regular programming on WOI was farm market reports gathered by ticker tape and Morse code, broadcast throughout the state. Another early staple was sporting events by Iowa State's athletic teams. In 1925, \"The Music Shop\" aired for the first time. One of the longest-running programs in the history of radio, it moved to WOI-FM in the 1970s before going off the air in 2006. In 1927. another longtime favorite, \"The Book Club\" was added; it also aired until 2006. \n\nOn December 1, 1949, Iowa State launched an FM adjunct to WOI, WOI-FM at 90.1 MHz. WOI-TV was subsequently launched in 1950 as the first television station in central Iowa. It was also the first commercial TV station in the country owned by an educational institution. It was affiliated with all four networks of its time before it became solely an ABC affiliate in 1955. WOI-TV was sold by the Iowa Board of Regents on March 1, 1994; the station is now owned by TEGNA.\n\nWOI-AM-FM became a charter member of National Public Radio when it began its regular schedule of afternoon news program \"All Things Considered\" in 1971.\n\nToday WOI's programming consists of both NPR and locally produced talk shows along with local news and BBC news updates. The classical music of the early years migrated exclusively to WOI-FM in the 1960s. When the radio services of Iowa's state universities were merged into Iowa Public Radio in 2004, WOI became the flagship of IPR's Operations and IT services.\n\nDue to its location near the bottom of the AM dial and Iowa's mostly flat landscape (with near-perfect ground conductivity), WOI's non-directional 5,000 watt daytime signal reaches most of the state of Iowa, similar to 50,000 watt WHO. With a good radio, WOI can also be heard in parts of Missouri, Minnesota, Nebraska and South Dakota. A single tower is used during the day. At night, because of the nighttime propagation the signal is reduced to 1,000 watts at night and two towers are used in a phased array configuration to protect KFI in Los Angeles, concentrating the signal eastward around Des Moines, Waterloo and Cedar Rapids.\n\n"}

It has been divided into several current cities and towns, including Nashua, Hollis, Hudson, Litchfield, and Merrimack.\n\nThe town was originally part of a larger town of Dunstable, Massachusetts, when Massachusetts stretched from Rhode Island up to Maine. The original tract of land was bisected by the Merrimack River, an important route for the lucrative fur and log trade. Dunstable was incorporated as a township in 1673. On July 3, 1706, during Queen Anne's War, tribes of the Wabanaki Confederacy raided the town, killing nine while seven of the natives were killed.\n\nWhen the New Hampshire-Massachusetts border was surveyed and adjusted in 1741, the northern part of the town was determined to be in New Hampshire, and was incorporated as a New Hampshire town in 1746. Both the northern New Hampshire half and the southern Massachusetts half prospered, and various villages were formed along the Merrimack, but also along Salmon Brook, the Nashua River, Pennichuck Brook, and the Souhegan River, which also ran through the tract.\n\nOver the years, other towns were formed from parts of the original area on both sides of the state line, and in 1836 the remaining part that still bore the name of \"Dunstable, New Hampshire\" was renamed \"Nashua\", after the name of the river that flowed into the Merrimack at the location then referred to as \"Indian Head\". Six years later Nashua split into \"Nashville\" and \"Nashua\", but in 1853 they rejoined and became the \"City of Nashua\". The name Nashville is preserved in the city's Nashville Historic District, and the name Dunstable can still be found in the streets \"New Dunstable Road\", \"Main Dunstable Road\", and \"East Dunstable Road\" .\n"}
{"id": "2227224", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2227224", "title": "Jimaní", "text": "Jimaní\n\nJimaní is the capital and the second largest city of the Independencia Province of the Dominican Republic. It serves as one of the two main thoroughfares to Haiti (with Dajabón), with a duty-free open-air marketplace operating on the border with Haiti. The town suffered damages in the flash flood of May 25, 2004, which killed many citizens during the night and washed away hundreds of homes.\n\nThe name \"Ximani\" is of native Taíno origin. Historian Rafael Leonidas Pérez y Pérez in his book \"Annotations on the history of Jimaní\", says that Ximani was a Cacique of the chieftainship of Xaragua who had control of the town that lied in the middle of the two lakes, Lake Enriquillo and Lake Azuei, as well as the pass that leads to Pic la Selle making it a strategical and important part of the island. The name \"Ximaní\" is recognized when the Spaniards signed a peace agreement with the natives through Enriquillo at \"the Lagoon of Ximaní\" in 1536. \n\nAnother version claims the name belongs to a French Count (Count of Jimaní). Pérez y Pérez clarifies however that this official, was called \"of Jimani\" because of him having owned that land, which was awarded to him during the expansion of the French occupation. The historian argues that the French did not occupy the west side of the island, particularly that territory, until the mid 18th century. \n\nBy the time of the Dominican War of Independence, Jimani was practically deserted with most of the fighting taking place in Neiba. After the independence of 1844 the earliest inhabitants of Jimaní came from various communities of the southwest, such as Neiba, Duvergé, El Estero, Las Salinas, Azua de Compostela, Santa Cruz de Barahona, and Haitian immigrants from the mountains that married or had common-law marriages with Dominicans, forming families in the most populous neighborhood of the community, known as Jimaní Viejo. By the 1930s Jimaní belonged to Neiba and in 1938 it became part of the commune of La Descubierta, forming a part of the Province of Baoruco. \n\nOn the 18 of March 1943, by means of the law number 229, Jimani was elevated to municipal district. On December 29 1948 the province of Baoruco was split into two provinces, the west side receiving the name of Independence Province. On January 1 1950, Jimani officially became the Capital of the new province Independencia. \n\nJimaní has a tropical wet and dry climate and relatively constant temperatures throughout the course of the year. Annual rainfall is distributed, peaking in May and October; the dry season occurs from December through February.\n\nAgriculture and commerce with Haiti represent the main economic activities of this municipality. In agriculture the main products are cassava, batata, melon, peppers, cilantro and tomatoes.\n\nJimaní has a popular duty-free open-air marketplace with Haiti that is also visited by people from adjoining towns and even from distant regions of the country. In this market, basic food products are sold, as well as foreign beverages, clothes, shoes, and new and used electrical appliances. \n\nThe customs zone of the border is called \"The Door\" and it is visited by foreign tourists that come to observe the dynamics of the business and intercultural and interracial relation between Dominicans and Haitians. \n\nThe municipal City Hall receives monthly RD$1,000,000 as mandated by the General Law of Budget, through the Dominican Municipal League. The authorities of the City Hall estimate the internal tax collection to be about $15,000 monthly. \n\nThe municipal districts El Limón and Boca de Cachón receive monthly $500,000 each one, from the transfer ordered by the law through the Dominican Municipal League. \n\nThere are two financial institutions in Jimaní. A branch office of the Reserve Bank and a branch office of the Cooperative of Savings and Credit of Neiba (Coopacrene).\n\nThere are six basic schools with two daily schedules and four public high schools, three of them for adults.\n\nThe municipality has a municipal hospital and four rural clinics or hospitals. The majority of the Jimanisenses prefer to seek medical attention in the Regional University Hospital Jaime Mota of Barahona.\n\nJimaní is mostly Catholic. Local holidays are celebrated March 19, in honor of their Saint San José. A carnival is being added to the Patronal Feast, to expand the celebration. Also being instituted is the celebration of a Cultural Week each year, in memory of the flood that destroyed a big part of the population in May 2004. \n\nAs a historic-cultural monument, Jimaní conserves intact and conditioned the \"Mansion of Trujillo\", one of many the dictator built in the border region, although he never spent the night in this particular one.\n\nLocal governments have carried out different works for the community, such as the reconstruction and restructuring of the municipal cemetery, the reconstruction of street gutters, rehabilitation of electric lighting in the urban area and in the sector of Tierra Nueva. There are also ongoing projects to enlarge the aqueduct network for the neighborhoods of La Cu and El Cerro.\n\nIn Jimaní there are several community associations. For example, in each of the towns that conform the municipality there is an Association of Farmers as well as an Association of Mothers. \n\nThere is also a Lions Club, the Association of Minibuses Jimaní-Barahona, a committee that represents the Association of \"Jimanisenses\" in Massachusetts, US, a technical team of World Vision, Fundasur (Foundation of the South) and Conani (the National Council for Childhood and Adolescence).\n"}
{"id": "2227227", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2227227", "title": "Political Party of Radicals", "text": "Political Party of Radicals\n\nThe Political Party of Radicals (, PPR) was a progressive Christian and green political party in the Netherlands. The PPR played a relatively small role in Dutch politics and merged with other left-wing parties to form GreenLeft (Dutch: GroenLinks) in 1991.\n\nThe foundation of the PPR is linked to formation of the De Jong cabinet and the Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA).\n\nAfter the 1967 general election it became clear that a centre-right cabinet would be formed by the Anti-Revolutionary Party (ARP) and Christian Historical Union (CHU), the Catholic People's Party (KVP) and the People's Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD). Progressive forces within the KVP and ARP had hoped for the formation of a centre-left cabinet with the Labour Party (PvdA) without the participation of the CHU and VVD.\n\nIn March 1967 a group of \"regret voters\" (ARP-members who regretted voting ARP) published an advertisement in the Protestant newspaper Trouw, aimed at the leadership of the ARP: they claimed that the left-wing, so called \"evangelically radical\", ideal of the ARP could not be realised in a cabinet with the VVD. In April this group began to meet regularly with dissidents from the KVP in the Hotel Americain, this gave the group the name \"American Group\". The group included Wilhelm de Gaay Fortman, prominent ARP politician, his son Bas de Gaay Fortman, Jo Cals, former KVP prime minister, and Ruud Lubbers, member of the KVP and future Prime Minister. In May the group became a formal organisation, the Working Group Christian Radicals, which was oriented at making their mother parties more progressive. They had some success in the KVP, which was seeking new allies and a new image, after it had lost the 1967 general election.\nIn February 1968 the leaders of the KVP, Norbert Schmelzer, ARP, Barend Biesheuvel and CHU, Jur Mellema made a public appearance, stating that the three parties wanted to work together more closely. This cooperation would eventually lead to the formation of the Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA) in 1974. With this appearance the hopes of the Christian Radicals within the KVP that a progressive alliance with the Labour Party would be formed, were shattered.\n\nOn 27 April 1968 part of the group of Catholic radicals left the KVP and formed the Political Party of Radicals (PRP). Prominent radicals, like Lubbers and Cals, did not join the party. A group of radical KVP MPs led by Jacques Aarden left the KVP parliamentary party and formed their own group-Aarden, the parliamentary party of the PPR. The party is joined by some prominent \"regret-voters\" from the ARP, most prominently Bas de Gaay Fortman.\n\nThe party began to co-operate closely with the Labour Party (PvdA), the newly founded Democrats 66 (D66) and initially with the left-wing Pacifist Socialist Party (PSP) in the so-called Progressive Accords (PAK). The parties proposed common election manifestos and formed a shadow cabinet. The PSP left the alliance before the negotiations ended, because the alliance was not socialist enough. The PPR participated in the 1971 general election as part of the PAK. The PPR won only two seats, while the PAK wins only 52 seats, a third of parliament. Jacques Aarden led the party in parliament. Some prominent members left the PPR, because they think the party has failed. The Biesheuvel cabinet was formed by the ARP, KVP, CHU, VVD and the Democratic Socialists '70.\n\nIn the 1972 general election the parties tried again. The PAK now won 56 seats and the PPR 7. Former ARP-politician Bas de Gaay Fortman led the party in the elections. A continuation of the Biesheuvel cabinet, which fell within one year is excluded. The only possibility is a centre-left government with the PAK parties and the Christian democratic parties. The PAK parties refuse this possibility and want to form a PAK minority cabinet. A compromise is found in the progressive Den Uyl cabinet, an extra-parliamentary cabinet composed out of PvdA, D66 and PPR and progressive individuals from the ARP and the KVP, including former Radicals such as Lubbers and Wilhelm de Gaay Fortman. The PPR supplied two ministers, Harry van Doorn Minister for Culture, Recreation and Social Work, and Boy Trip, Minister without Portfolio for Science and one state secretary, Michel van Hulten, for Transport, Public Works and Water Management. The fact that the PPR was co-operating with the ARP and KVP, which many members of the party had just left led to considerable upheaval within the party. The party congress adopted a resolution stating that the party would not co-operate with these parties in the next cabinet.\n\nBefore the 1977 elections Bas de Gaay Fortman was replaced as political leader by Ria Beckers. The election results were especially disastrous: the party lost four seats: this is attributed to the political competition between PvdA Prime Minister Joop den Uyl and his Christian Democrat competitor Dries van Agt, which caused many PSP-sympathisers to vote for Den Uyl, and also the anti-KVP/ARP resolution adopted by the congress, which made serious participation in cabinet impossible.\n\nin 1979, following the first direct elections to the European Parliament, the PRP was involved with the Coordination of European Green and Radical Parties (CEGRP) and its unsuccessful efforts to create a single pan-European platform for green and radical politics.\n\nIn the early 1980s the placement of American nuclear weapons became an important political issue. The PPR was involved in the organisation of national demonstrations against nuclear weapons and more than 80% of the members of the PPR attended one of the two mass protests against the placement nuclear weapons of 1981 and 1983.\n\nThe party began to debate its political course: some members (known as the Godebald-group) wanted to continue co-operation with the PvdA. Many of the party's founders and former ministers, such as Erik Jurgens were part of this group. Others wanted to co-operate with the Pacifist Socialist Party and the Communist Party of the Netherlands. They were called the Wageningen Group. Another group wanted to reform the party's course and continue as an independent Green party: Bas de Gaay Fortman and former Provo and Kabouter Roel van Duijn were important exponents of this group. At the party congress of 1981 the party voted on these options, which were colour-coded: the Red option (cooperation with the PSP and CPN), the Blue option (co-operation with the D66 and the PvdA) and the Green option (independent green party). An alliance was struck between the Reds and Greens. The party decided to break its alliance with D66 and the PvdA and try to form an alliance with the PSP and CPN, which would have a strong green identity. In the 1981 general election it kept its three seats. After the elections a CDA/PvdA/D66 cabinet was formed – a continuation of the Den Uyl cabinet without the PPR. The cabinet fell after several months in the subsequent 1982 election where the party lost one seat. In 1985 CDA-dissident Stef Dijkman joined the PPR parliamentary party. He had split from the CDA in 1983 together with Nico Sholten, who joined the PvdA parliamentary party.\n\nIn the 1980s the cooperation between PPR, CPN and PSP began to take shape. The parties co-operated mainly in municipal and provincial elections and legislatures, because a higher percentage of votes is necessary to gain seats in such elections. In the 1984 European election the PPR, CPN and PSP formed the Green Progressive Accord that entered with one list in the European elections. They won one seat, which rotated between the PSP and PPR. Party-members also met each other in grassroots extraparliamentary protest against nuclear power and nuclear weapons. Both the PSP and CPN were unwilling to co-operate intensively with the PPR, which was slightly larger in seats and which they saw as a non-socialist party.\n\nIn 1989 the PSP initiated talks with the PPR and the PSP. Their initiative was supported by an open letter from members of trade unions, environmental movements and the arts which called for one progressive formation to the left of the PvdA. After long negotiations, which were pressured by the fall of the second Lubbers cabinet and the subsequent earlier elections, the party entered in the 1989 general election as part of GreenLeft. They were joined by the Evangelical People's Party (EVP). Ria Beckers was top candidate and she became chair of the GreenLeft parliamentary party. In 1991 the PPR dissolved itself into GreenLeft when GreenLeft became a formal political party. In the same year, GreenLeft's only MEP, former PPR-chair, Verbeek announced that he would not give up his seat in the European Parliament, to allow a former member of the PSP to enter the European Parliament. He would continue as an independent and would be top candidate for The Greens in the 1994 European election, without success.\nThe PPR left a considerable mark on GreenLeft. In particular the green, environmentalist ideals of the PPR still play an important role.\n\nThe name \"Political Party of Radicals\" referenced the origin of the party, it was founded by the so-called Christian Radicals: progressive Catholics. Because they wanted to open their party to all Christians as well as to non-Christians, the dropped the reference to Christianity in their name.\n\nThe party did not have a manifesto of principles, instead election manifestos which addressed current issues guided the party's behaviour.\n\nAlthough the party had Christian roots, it denounced a direct relationship between religion and politics. The party can be seen as an early green party with a post-materialist agenda consisting of environmental protection, third world development, nuclear disarmament, democratisation of the economy and grass roots democracy. The party favoured the implementation of a basic income.\n\nDuring its existence the party changed from a Christian ally of the Labour Party (PvdA) with its roots in the Catholic trade union movement to a party on the left of the PvdA with links to the environmental movement. Several decisions were important in this, but especially the 1981 congress in which the party decided not to cooperate, but try to found a political alliance left of the PvdA with a green program.\n\nThis table the PPR's results in elections to the House of Representatives, Senate, European Parliament and States-Provincial, as well as the party's political leadership: the fractievoorzitter, is the chair of the parliamentary party and the lijsttrekker is the party's top candidate in the general election, these posts are normally taken by the party's leader. It also possible that the leader of the PPR is a member of cabinet, therefore its participation in cabinets is also listed: if the PPR was in cabinet the highest ranking minister is listed. The membership of PPR and the party chair is also represented.\n<nowiki>*</nowiki>: Group Van Aarden, who split from the Catholic People's Party in 1968; no formal ties with the PPR.\n<nowiki>**</nowiki>: elected on combined PvdA/PPR lists (estimate).\n<nowiki>***</nowiki>: elected on combined PPR/CPN/PSP or PPR/PSP lists (estimate).\n<nowiki>****</nowiki>: joined by group Dijkman.\n<nowiki>*****</nowiki>: cooperating in GreenLeft parliamentary parties.\n\nThe PPR supplied several municipal and provincial councillors. In the 1970s it also cooperated in the North Holland provincial executive and in several local executives such as Amsterdam.\n\nIn the following figure one can see the election results of the provincial election of 1982 per province. It shows that the support for the party was distributed equally throughout the country, with a slight tendency to the West (North, Utrecht and South Holland) and South (Brabant and Limburg).\n\n<nowiki>*</nowiki>: elected on combined PvdA/PPR lists (estimate).\n<nowiki>**</nowiki>: elected on combined PPR/CPN/PSP or PPR/PSP lists (estimate).\n\nThe PPRs electorate consisted of young, well educated voters, who often had a Catholic or Protestant background. The electorate was slightly more concentrated in the West (North, Utrecht and South Holland) and South (Brabant and Limburg).\n\nThe highest organ of the PPR was the Congress. It convened once every year. It appointed the party board and decided the order of candidates on electoral lists for the House of Representatives, Senate and European Parliament and had the final say over the party program.\n\nThe PPR published its own magazine which was called \"Radicals Paper\" (Dutch: Radikalenkrant) between 1968 and 1973 and 1982 and 1990 and \"PPR Action Paper\" (Dutch: PPR aktiekrant; PPRAK) between 1973 and 1981.\n\nThe PPRs youth was organised in the Political Party of Radicals Youth (Dutch: Politieke Partij Radicalen Jeugd; PPRJ) In 1991 the PPRJ merged into DWARS GreenLeft youth.\n\nIn the 1980s the scientific institute of the PPR cooperated strongly with the scientific institutes of the PSP and CPN. They published \"De Helling\" together since 1987. The \"Rode Draad\" was published since 1985 it was a magazine for municipal and provincial councillors of both the PSP, PPR and CPN.\n\nSince 1979 the party cooperated with other Green and left-wing parties in organisations like Grael, which later became the European Green Party.\n\nCooperation has been an important theme for the PPR as the party was founded as party of left-wing Christians who wanted to cooperate with the PvdA, which later became committed to forming a political alliance left of the PvdA.\n\nBetween 1971 and 1977 the relations with PvdA and Democrats 66 were especially close. The three parties formed the core of the Den Uyl cabinet. After the elections of 1977, when the PPR lost a lot of seats, and 1981 when the PPR was excluded from the second Van Agt cabinet.\n\nThe relations with the CPN and PSP started out badly, as the CPN and the PSP saw the party as a reformist, non-socialist party. After 1981 when the PPR had committed itself to extra-parliamentary protest the relations with the reforming CPN and PSP became better. In 1989 this resulted in the formation of the GreenLeft\n\n"}

It delivered and assembled the fourth starboard Integrated Truss Segment (S6), and the fourth set of solar arrays and batteries to the station. The launch took place on 15 March 2009, at 19:43 EDT. \"Discovery\" successfully landed on 28 March 2009, at 15:13 pm EDT.\n\nThis mission was originally scheduled to bring the Expedition 9 crew to the ISS. This crew would have consisted of:\nSTS-119 delivered the S6 solar arrays to the space station, completing the construction of the Integrated Truss Structure. STS-119 also carried several experiments, including the Shuttle Ionospheric Modification with Pulsed Local EXhaust (SIMPLEX), Shuttle Exhaust Ion Turbulence Experiments (SEITE), and Maui Analysis of Upper Atmospheric Injections (MAUI).\nSTS-119 was also used for the \"Boundary Layer Transition Detailed Test Objective\" experiment. One tile of the thermal protection system was raised above the others so that, at about Mach 15 during reentry, a boundary layer transition would be initiated. This experiment was repeated during STS-128 with the tile raised to , tripping at Mach 18 to produce more heat.\n\n\n moved from its Orbiter Processing Facility to the Vehicle Assembly Building on 7 January 2009. The payload of the S6 truss segment, solar arrays and batteries were delivered to Launch pad 39A on 11 January. \"Discovery\" moved to the launch pad 39A on 14 January 2009. The move began at 05:17 EST, and was completed at 12:16 EST.\n\nThe STS-119 crew was at Kennedy Space Center from 19–22 January 2009 for the Terminal Countdown Demonstration Test. On 21–22 January 2009, mission managers met for the program level Flight Readiness Review (FRR). Following the FRR, mission managers recommended evaluating the hydrogen flow control valves on \"Discovery\", and set a new target launch date of 19 February 2009.\nDue to the breakage of one of three flow control valves on the previous flight, STS-126, the flow valves of all orbiters were subjected to tests to determine if \"Discovery\" was safe to fly. These valves are used to synchronize the flow of gaseous hydrogen between the external fuel tank and the main engines, creating an even flow. Following the testing of the valves, mission managers decided to postpone the launch, and engineers were asked to replace the suspect flow valves with valves that had less flight time.\n\nFollowing the replacement of the valves, the Mission Management Team gave the approval for launch, and scheduled it for 11 March 2009. The astronauts arrived at the Kennedy Space Center on 8 March 2009 to prepare for launch. The 11 March 2009 launch was scrubbed due to a leak in a liquid hydrogen vent line between the shuttle and the external tank. On 15 March 2009, the shuttle successfully lifted off from pad 39A. The leak problem manifested itself again during STS-127 which led to a thorough test. The root cause was found to be a misalignment in the GUCP (Ground Umbilical Carrier Plate) which was set right leading to a successful flight.\n\nSpace Shuttle \"Discovery\" launched on time at 19:43 EDT without any issues. Upon initial review of early ascent imagery, mission managers did not see anything out of the ordinary with debris at launch. \"We didn't see anything at all in the first quick look,\" noted Bill Gerstenmaier, Associate Administrator for Space Operations, during the post-launch news conference. \"I've seen a lot of launches,\" commented Launch Director Michael D. Leinbach during the conference, \"and this was the most visibly beautiful launch I've ever seen.\" After reaching orbit, the STS-119 crew got to work on their orbit operations, opening the payload bay doors, deploying the Ku band antenna, and activating and checking out the shuttle's robotic arm. The crew also downlinked the imagery taken of the external tank separation.\n\nDuring the countdown a bat was seen to be resting on the external tank. What was originally believed to be a fruit bat was revealed to have been a free-tailed bat that clung onto the fuel tank during the launch. NASA observers had believed the bat would fly off once the shuttle started to launch, but it did not, and it was probably shaken off and incinerated by the rocket exhaust. A bat doctor, analyzing pictures, believed the bat had a broken wing which made it unable to fly off.\n\nFollowing the crew's wakeup call, the members of STS-119 set to work on the day's task of inspecting \"Discovery's\" thermal protection system. Using the shuttle's robotic arm and the Orbiter Boom Sensor System (OBSS), the crew performed the five-hour inspection, and the images and video from the survey would be reviewed by the image analysis team on the ground. In preparation for docking with the space station on flight day three, the crew performed a checkout of the spacesuits that would be used during the mission, as well as extending the ring of the orbital docking system, and installing the docking system's centerline camera.\n\nInitial review of the flight ascent imagery indicated no major problems with foam loss or debris strikes to the orbiter. During the day's Mission Management Team briefing, chairman LeRoy Cain noted that the launch was \"picture perfect\" and the orbiter was in excellent condition. Cain also noted that after an initial review of the telemetry from the launch, the hydrogen flow control valves performed as expected, with no issues seen.\n\nThe crew of \"Discovery\" got to work in the morning preparing for rendezvous and docking with the space station. After performing the rendezvous pitch maneuver (RPM) to allow the Expedition 18 crew to photograph the underside of the orbiter, \"Discovery\" successfully docked with the station at 21:20 UTC. Following hatch leak checks, the hatches were opened at 23:09 UTC. After greeting each other, the crews had a mandatory station safety briefing, and then set to work with initial transfers, including the exchange of Magnus' \"Soyuz\" seat liner for Wakata's. The swap of the seat liners marked Wakata officially joining the Expedition 18 crew as Flight Engineer, and Magnus became a Mission Specialist for STS-119.\n\nDuring the Mission Status briefing, Lead Flight Director Paul Dye commended Archambault on a picture perfect docking. Dye said that no major issues or anomalies were being tracked, but noted that the image analysis team was still working on ascent imagery, and would be reviewing the RPM imagery before making a decision as to whether \"Discovery\" would require a focused inspection.\n\nFollowing the crew's post-sleep activities, the two crews set to work preparing for the next day's spacewalk, by moving the S6 truss out of \"Discovery\" payload bay. Due to clearance restrictions, the station's robotic arm was not able to perform the move by itself, so a series of 'handoffs' were performed to prepare the truss for installation. Phillips and Magnus controlled the station's arm, grappled the truss and moved it into a position where the shuttle's robotic arm, operated by Antonelli, could take possession.\n\nThe station arm was then moved along the mobile base to a work site on the far right side, closer to the installation point. The shuttle's robotic arm then handed the truss back to the station's arm, where it remained overnight.\n\nThe crews took part in a media event with Channel One News, and performed a review of the procedures for the first EVA. Mission Specialists Swanson and Arnold spent the night in the \"Quest\" airlock camping out in a reduced-nitrogen atmosphere, a standard procedure designed for spacewalkers to prevent decompression symptoms.\n\nDuring the Mission Management Team briefing, Lead ISS Flight Director Kwatsi Alibaruho noted that the imagery specialists with the Damage Assessment Team had completed the initial review of the launch and flight day 2 photography, and a focused inspection of the orbiter would not be required.\n\nThe two crews set to work following their wake up call, preparing for the first spacewalk of the mission. Swanson and Arnold exited the \"Quest\" airlock at 16:22 UTC to begin the installation of the S6 truss segment. Once Swanson and Arnold were in position, Phillips and Wakata remotely controlled the station's robotic arm, maneuvering the truss into its final position. Swanson and Arnold then bolted the truss into place, and connected power and data cables, which allowed the ground team to begin remote activation of the segment. The two spacewalkers also removed launch locks, stowed a keel pin, removed and jettisoned four thermal covers, and deployed the blanket boxes that hold the solar arrays in place during launch. The spacewalk ended at 21:11 UTC, for a total time of 6 hours, 7 minutes.\n\nInitially scheduled for flight day 8, managers on the ground decided to move up the deployment of the solar arrays, following the decision that a focused inspection would not be required. It was decided that the deployment of the arrays would be performed on flight day 6, prior to the mission's second spacewalk, in case any issues arose that required a spacewalk to resolve.\n\nAs part of the re-planning for the mission, the crews set to work in the morning deploying the solar wings on the S6 truss. To prepare for the extension of the arrays, the station was maneuvered into a position that allowed constant sunlight to hit the arrays, which allowed them to warm up and prevent what the mission team calls 'stiction', or a sticky friction that happens after the arrays have been in storage for an extended period of time.\n\nThe unfurling of the arrays started at 15:06 UTC, beginning with the channel 1B array. Commanding the unit from the station, Philips paused at the halfway point, and allowed the array to rest in the sun for approximately 45 minutes, and then completed the extension. After successfully extending the 1B array, the astronauts started the 3B array extension at 16:35 UTC. The 3B array was expected to be more difficult to extend, as it had been packed in the blanket box for eight years. As with the first, a pause at halfway was performed to allow the arrays to heat up in the sun. While some stiction was seen, once the final extension began all the slats flattened out, and the arrays were fully deployed at 17:17 UTC. The addition of the final set of solar panels brings the station's power output to 120 kilowatts, and doubles the scientific power to 30 kilowatts. The station's surface area of the arrays is just under one acre, or 38,400 square feet.\n\nLater in the day, Fincke, Lonchakov, Wakata and Magnus participated in a media event with Reuters, Voice of America, and the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.\n\nDuring the Mission Status briefing, Alibaruho expressed how pleased the teams on the ground were with the successful deployment of the arrays, and commended the crew on the deployment activities. Mission Management Team Chairman LeRoy Cain noted that the team was working on a revised timetable to allow critical experiment samples to return to Earth safely. The samples need to be kept in a cold environment, and in the event weather delayed the landing, the team evaluated the best way to preserve the samples. The team approved a revised flight plan that allows \"Discovery\" to delay hatch closure and undocking slightly, to allow the samples to be kept inside the station's freezer longer, while still protecting the landing date of 28 March. Instead of closing the hatch the night before undocking, the hatch would be closed on the same day, flight day eleven.\n\nSwanson and Acaba began the second spacewalk at 16:51 UTC. They loosened bolts, installed foot restraints and prepared tools so that the STS-127 spacewalkers could more easily change out the Port 6 truss batteries later this year. On the Japanese \"Kibo\" laboratory they installed a second Global Positioning Satellite antenna. They photographed areas of radiator panels extended from the Port 1 and Starboard 1 trusses and reconfigured connectors at a patch panel on the Zenith 1 truss that power Control Moment Gyroscopes. After struggling with a pin that kept an \"Unpressurized Cargo Carrier Attachment System\" (UCCAS) from fully deploying, they tied UCCAS safely in place. The spacewalk ended at 23:21 UTC, for a time of six hours and thirty minutes.\n\nAt 20:31 UTC, \"Discovery\" rotated the shuttle-station complex 180 degrees, to avoid a piece of orbital debris. At 23:23, \"Discovery\" began rotating the station back to normal attitude, with the shuttle in 'back'.\n\nFincke continued to work on the Urine Processor Assembly, while Acaba and Arnold entered the \"Quest\" Airlock to prepare for the mission's third spacewalk.\n\nAcaba and Arnold completed the mission's third spacewalk. They helped robotic arm operators relocate the Crew Equipment Translation Aid (CETA) cart from the Port 1 to Starboard 1 truss segment, installed a new coupler on the CETA cart, and lubricated snares on the space station's robotic arm.\n\nThey were unable to deploy the Port 3 unpressurized cargo carrier attachment system (UCCAS). They secured the UCCAS in place until engineers can evaluate the problem. Mission Control cancelled the installation of a similar payload attachment system on the starboard side. The port UCCAS was deployed successfully during STS-127 by releasing the stuck pin with a custom made tool.\n\nThe spacewalk lasted six hours, 27 minutes. It began at 15:37 UTC and concluded at 22:04 UTC.\n\nAt 17:05 UTC, all crew members aboard \"Discovery\" and the space station gathered in the station's \"Harmony\" module and spoke to the President of the United States, members of the United States Congress, and students during a joint news conference.\n\nCrew members from space shuttle \"Discovery\" and the International Space Station closed their respective hatches at 17:59 UTC. The Space Shuttle undocked from the International Space Station at 19:53 UTC.\n\nAntonelli used the shuttle's robotic arm to grapple the Orbiter Boom Sensor System enabling the cameras and laser sensors to scan \"Discovery\" for signs of damage from orbital debris.\n\nThe crew stowed items in the crew cabin and completed a check out the orbiter's flight control surfaces.\n\nFollowing the wake up call, the crew on board \"Discovery\" got to work preparing for entry. After the first landing opportunity was waved off due to high wind concerns, the team on the ground gave the crew a 'go' to proceed with the second opportunity. Following the deorbit burn, the orbiter landed successfully at 15:13 EDT.\n\nThree spacewalks were scheduled and completed during STS-119. The cumulative time in extra-vehicular activity during the mission was 19 hours and 4 minutes.\n\nA tradition for NASA human spaceflights since the days of Gemini, is that mission crews are played a special musical track at the start of each day in space. Each track is specially chosen, often by their family, and usually has a special meaning to an individual member of the crew, or is applicable to their daily activities.\n\n\n"}

In 1814, he took part in the frontier operations in Canada. In 1824, he was selected by Lieut-colonel (afterwards Major-General) T.F. Colby (1784–1852) to take part in Ordnance Survey of Ireland. He was engaged for several years in the trigonometrical branch and subsequently compiled information on the physical aspects, geology, and economic products of Ireland, including the Memoir for which he wrote substantial sections on productive economy.\n\nIn 1837, he formed at Belfast a geological and statistical office, a museum for geological and zoological specimens, and a laboratory for the examination of soils. The work was then carried on by Portlock as the geological branch of the Ordnance Survey, and the chief results were embodied in his \"Report on the Geology of the County of Londonderry and of parts of Tyrone and Fermanagh\" (1843), an elaborate and well-illustrated volume in which he was assisted by Thomas Oldham.\n\nAfter serving in Corfu and at Portsmouth, he was, in 1849, appointed Commanding Royal Engineer at Cork, and from 1851-1856, he was Inspector of Studies at the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich. For a short time, commanding officer at Dover, when the Council of Military Education was formed in 1857, he was selected as a member.\n\nDuring these years of active service, he contributed numerous geological papers to the scientific societies of Dublin and to the British Association. He published, in 1848, a treatise on geology in John Weale's \"Rudimentary Series\" (3rd. ed., 1853). He was president of the geological section of the British Association at Belfast (1852) and of the Geological Society of London (1856-1858). He wrote a \"Memoir of the late Major-General Colby, with a Sketch of the Origin and Progress of the Trigonometrical Survey\" (reprinted in 1869 from Papers on Subjects connected with the Royal Engineers, vols. iii-v.). He also contributed several articles on military subjects to the 8th edition of the Encyclopaedia. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1837. He died in Dublin on 14 February 1864.\n\nHe married twice: firstly Julia Browne at Kilmaine, Co Mayo, Ireland on 24 February 1831, and secondly to Fanny Turner at Cork, Ireland on 11 December 1849. Fanny was the 4th daughter of Major General Charles Turner, KH commander of the Cork District. There was no issue from either marriage.\nHe conducted experimentation, using oxyhydrogen drummond light heliostats to reflect the sun's rays 108 miles over the St George Channel, proving the earth does not have detectable curvature to support a globe hypothesis.\n\n\n"}

The goal of the project was to reduce overpopulation in the southern Gilbert Islands by developing three mostly uninhabited atolls in the Phoenix Islands archipelago:\n\nA secondary goal was to enhance the British presence in the western Pacific in response to growing American influence through the Guano Islands Act, especially on Canton (later Kanton), where a commercial seaplane base was being established. \n\nThe three atolls, Sydney, Hull and Gardner, were renamed in Gilbertese as Manra Island, Orona Atoll and Nikumaroro respectively.

He was a member of the Whig administrations headed by Lord Grey and Lord Melbourne of the 1830s and also published works on financial and penal questions as well as on civil engineering. He was the great-uncle of Irish nationalist leader Charles Stewart Parnell.\n\nParnell was the second son of Sir John Parnell, 2nd Baronet, Chancellor of the Irish Exchequer, and Laetitia Charlotte, daughter of Sir Arthur Brooke, 1st Baronet. His younger brother William Parnell-Hayes was the grandfather of Charles Stewart Parnell. He was educated at Eton and Trinity College, Cambridge. In 1801 he inherited the family estates in Queen's County on the death of his father, bypassing his disabled elder brother according to a special Act of Parliament passed in 1789. In 1812 he succeeded as fourth Baronet, of Rathleague, on the death of his brother.\n\nParnell represented Maryborough in the Irish House of Commons from 1798 until the Act of Union in 1801. In April the following year he was elected to Parliament of the United Kingdom for Queen's County, but relinquished this seat already in July of the same year, when he was returned for Portarlington. However, he resigned the seat already in December 1802. In 1806 he was once again elected for Queen's County, and represented the constituency until 1832. In 1828 he was chairman of the Select Committee on the State of Public Income and Expenditure which successfully recommended abolition of the 280-year old Navy Board and the merging of its functions into the Board of Admiralty.\n\nIt was Parnell's motion on the civil list that the Duke of Wellington's administration was defeated in 1830. The Whigs came to power under Lord Grey and in 1831 Parnell was admitted to the Privy Council and appointed Secretary at War, a post he held until February 1833. He resigned his seat in Parliament the same year but returned in 1833 as the representative for Dundee. When the Whigs again came to power in April 1835 under Lord Melbourne, Parnell was made Paymaster of the Forces and Treasurer of the Ordnance and Navy. These offices were consolidated into that of Paymaster-General in 1836, and Parnell retained this post until the government fell in 1841. The latter year he was raised to the peerage as Baron Congleton, of Congleton in the County Palatine of Chester.\n\nHenry Parnell was also the author of several volumes and pamphlets on matters connected with financial questions, the most important being that \"On Financial Reform\", published in 1830. Parnell was strongly opposed to the prevailing protectionist system and passionately believed in the retrenchment of public expenditure, especially on the armed services. In \"On Financial Reform\", he advocated the repeal of taxes on raw materials and home manufactures, along with the reduction of import duties on foreign manufactures. He also favoured the reduction of taxes on \"luxuries\", such as tea, sugar, tobacco, wine and spirits. In order to pay for these reforms, Parnell proposed the reintroduction of the income tax. According to Sidney Buxton, \"On Financial Reform\" exercised a considerable influence on public opinion and \"laid before the country the financial and fiscal policy that Peel and Gladstone afterwards carried through\".\n\nHe was one of the main representatives of the so-called \"Free Banking School,\" which argued that the best way to achieve monetary stability was to revoke the Bank of England's monopoly on the issue of banknotes. These ideas were defended by Parnell and others in opposition to those of the \"Currency School\" (which advocated legal restrictions on the amount of notes that could be issued, with respect to their deposits in specie) and the \"Banking School,\" which advocated discretionary policy by the banks in monetary matters. The influence of the \"Free Banking School\" declined significantly after Parnell's death in 1842, and the Bank Charter Act 1844 eliminated the right of new banks in England and Wales to issue notes, thus consolidating the Bank of England's monopoly, which Parnell had opposed.\n\nParnell also wrote about penal matters. In the domain of civil engineering, he authored the 1833 and 1838 editions of \"A Treatise on Roads ...\" in which the works and techniques of Thomas Telford are described.\n\nLord Congleton married Lady Caroline Elizabeth, daughter of John Dawson, 1st Earl of Portarlington, in 1801. In 1842, having suffered for some time from ill-health and melancholy, he committed suicide by hanging, aged 65. He was succeeded in his titles by his eldest son John Vesey Parnell. Lady Congleton died in February 1861.\n\n"}

Baker Ski Area is a ski resort in the northwest United States, located in Whatcom County, Washington, at the end of State Route 542. The base elevation is at , while the peak of the resort is at . It is about south of the 49th parallel, the international border with Canada. Despite its name, the Mt. Baker Ski Area is actually closer to Mount Shuksan than Mount Baker.\n\nThe ski area is home to the world's greatest recorded snowfall in one season, , during the 1998–99 season. Mt. Baker also enjoys the unofficially highest average annual snowfall of any resort in the world, with .\n\nThe ski area is known for numerous challenging in-bounds routes and for the many backcountry opportunities that surround it. The backcountry is accessible from several chairlifts, and access is permitted from the resort following the Mt. Baker Ski Area backcountry policy.\n\nThe lifts at Mt. Baker are not named but referred to by number. All are fixed-grip quads. Chairs 3 and 4 access the same point from different sides of the mountain using a continuous loop of cable (haul rope); there is a mid-station at the top for unloading only.\n\nChair 1 runs from the Heather Meadows Lodge upper base area to the top of Panorama Dome. There is a midpoint station on this lift, where other riders can catch it halfway down the mountain, allowing for speedy runs on Austin, Pan Face, North Face, Chicken Ridge, and the famed Chute. Also accessible from Chair 1 is the Canyon and the rest of the Chair 6 terrain. Chair 2 is located at the Heather Meadows Lodge upper base area. This is a chair for beginners. Chair 3 allows customers either to access the Raven Hut Lodge area or return down to Chairs 2 and 3. Chair 4 runs from the Raven Hut Lodge area and back up to the top of Chair 3. Chair 5 replaced two parallel double chairs and accesses intermediate terrain, as well as the experts-only Gabl's run and the Elbow backcountry area. Chair 6 runs to the top of Panorama Dome. Chair 7 is the only chair that leaves from the White Salmon Lodge base area. From it, one can access Chair 8 or the Raven Hut Lodge area. Chair 8 is the longest chair on the mountain and features longer groomed runs as well as access to the Hemispheres and Shuksan Arm backcountry areas. Additionally, there are two handle-tow surface lifts for beginners, one located at White Salmon and one at Heather Meadows.\n\nAs of 2017, Mt. Baker does not have a terrain park.\n\nFuture expansion is limited, according to an interview with the General Manager, Duncan Howat:\n\nStarted in 1985, this slalom snowboard race through the natural halfpipe has evolved into an international event. The Legendary Banked Slalom attracts many professionals from around the world as competitors and allows amateurs of all ages and abilities to compete on the same course over the same period with the professionals. The winner in each category receives a duct tape trophy and an embroidered Carhartt jacket.\n\nMt. Baker Ski Area is often featured in ski and snowboard films and still photography due to its picturesque setting, plentiful snowfall, and the availability of easily accessed advanced terrain. \"The Call of The Wild\" was filmed at Mt. Baker in 1934–35.\n\nFeatured in Season 5, Episode 14 of the TV series, \"Frasier\", entitled \"The Ski Lodge\".\n\nThe ski season typically begins in late November and ends in late April.

{"id": "2227304", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2227304", "title": "Beverage function", "text": "Beverage function\n\nIn catering, beverage functions are functions where beverages are served.\n\nOne important issue of beverage functions is who pays for the drinks. There are three main scenarios:\n\nChoosing among the several options is influenced by several factors. One such factor is etiquette. Providing a cash bar at a function such as a wedding reception is generally considered poor etiquette in the United States.\n\nAnother such factor is cost. A cash bar is the least expensive option for a host. However, there are alternatives between a cash bar and a fully open bar that can limit costs. The host can set a hard limit on cost, beyond which all beverages have to be paid for by attendees. The host can specify that specific beverages, such as a few selected types of wines and beers, are paid for by the host, and that attendees pay for all other types of drinks. The host can set a time limit for an open bar, beyond which it reverts to being a cash bar. Or more complex combinations of these can be employed.\n\nSome venues, such as hotels, subject to the terms of their liquor licenses, may allow attendees to bring their own alcoholic drinks to beverage functions. However, they may also charge attendees a fee, usually charged per bottle (either at a flat rate or as a percentage of the bottle's price), for doing so, known as corkage.\n\nCash bars have their problems for caterers and venue managers. One major problem is the possibility of theft. To prevent this, managers can set up cashiers, who take money and issue drinks tickets, separate from the serving staff who actually serve drinks. Brown and Godsmark recommend to managers that they place only their most trustworthy staff in charge of the cash bars at banquets.\n\nConversely, open bars have problems for hosts, in that they can result in an increased number of intoxicated, and potentially obnoxious and aggressive, attendees, as compared to other options. With open bars, the level of waste also increases (which is reflected in increased costs to the host). Since attendees do not pay for their drinks, they often do not consider them to be as valuable as they would if they had paid for them themselves. This results in drinks being abandoned or forgotten, or simply discarded by guests who leave their drinks (as they go and do something else) after only partly consuming them and then replace them with fresh ones rather than finishing the drinks that they already had.\n\nThe types of drinks served at functions can vary, according to the type of the event, and the types and ages of the attendees. In particular, at wedding receptions whether the bride and groom are themselves alcohol drinkers can affect whether attendees pay for their own alcoholic drinks, or indeed whether alcohol is offered at all. Similarly, alcohol is not served at beverage events for children.\n\nAnother factor that affects whether alcohol is served is liability, for subsequent intoxication and anything that results from it. Many U.S. jurisdictions allow the victims of accidents to sue not only the person who was intoxicated, but also the person who served the alcohol, the person or company employing the bartender, and the board of directors of the company.\n\n"}
{"id": "2227311", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2227311", "title": "Golden Age of Science Fiction", "text": "Golden Age of Science Fiction\n\nThe first Golden Age of Science Fiction, often recognized in the United States as the period from 1938 to 1946, was an era during which the science fiction genre gained wide public attention and many classic science fiction stories were published. In the history of science fiction, the Golden Age follows the \"pulp era\" of the 1920s and 1930s, and precedes New Wave science fiction of the 1960s and 1970s. The 1950s are a transitional period in this scheme; however, Robert Silverberg, who came of age in the 1950s, saw that decade as the true Golden Age.\n\nAccording to historian Adam Roberts, \"the phrase \"Golden Age\" valorises a particular sort of writing: 'Hard SF', linear narratives, heroes solving problems or countering threats in a space-opera or technological-adventure idiom.\"\n\nOne leading influence on the creation of the Golden Age was John W. Campbell, who became legendary in the genre as an editor and publisher of science fiction magazines, including \"Astounding Science Fiction\", to such an extent that Isaac Asimov stated that \"...in the 1940s, (Campbell) dominated the field to the point where to many seemed \"all\" of science fiction.\" Under Campbell's editorship, science fiction developed more realism and psychological depth to characterization than it exhibited in the Gernsbackian \"super science\" era. The focus shifted from the gizmo itself to the characters using the gizmo.\n\nMost fans agree that the Golden Age began around 1938-39, slightly later than the Golden Age of Detective Fiction, another pulp-based genre. The July 1939 issue of \"Astounding Science Fiction\" is sometimes cited as the start of the Golden Age. It included \"Black Destroyer\", the first published story by A. E. van Vogt, and the first appearance of Isaac Asimov (\"Trends\") in the magazine. Science fiction writer John C. Wright said of Van Vogt's story, \"This one started it all.\" The August issue contained the first published story by Robert A. Heinlein (\"Life-Line\").\n\nRobert Silverberg in a 2010 essay argued that the true Golden Age was the 1950s, saying that “Golden Age” of the 1940s was a kind of \"false dawn\". \"Until the decade of the fifties\", Silverberg wrote, \"there was essentially no market for science fiction books at all\"; the audience supported only a few special interest small presses. The 1950s saw \"a spectacular outpouring of stories and novels that quickly surpassed both in quantity and quality the considerable achievement of the Campbellian golden age\", as mainstream companies like Simon & Schuster and Doubleday displaced specialty publishers like Arkham House and Gnome Press.\n\nMany of the most enduring science fiction tropes were established in Golden Age literature. Space opera came to prominence with the works of E. E. \"Doc\" Smith; Isaac Asimov established the canonical Three Laws of Robotics beginning with the 1941 short story \"Runaround\"; the same period saw the writing of genre classics such as the Asimov's \"Foundation\" and Smith's \"Lensman\" series. Another frequent characteristic of Golden Age science fiction is the celebration of scientific achievement and the sense of wonder; Asimov's short story \"Nightfall\" exemplifies this, as in a single night a planet's civilization is overwhelmed by the revelation of the vastness of the universe. Robert A. Heinlein's 1950s novels, such as \"The Puppet Masters\", \"Double Star\", and \"Starship Troopers\", express the libertarian ideology that runs through much of Golden Age science fiction.\n\nAlgis Budrys in 1965 wrote of the \"recurrent strain in 'Golden Age' science fiction of the 1940s—the implication that sheer technological accomplishment would solve all the problems, hooray, and that all the problems were what they seemed to be on the surface\". The Golden Age also saw the re-emergence of the religious or spiritual themes—central to so much proto-science fiction before the pulp era—that Hugo Gernsback had tried to eliminate in his vision of \"scientifiction\". Among the most significant such Golden Age narratives are Bradbury's \"The Martian Chronicles\", Clarke's \"Childhood's End\", Blish's \"A Case of Conscience\", and Miller's \"A Canticle for Leibowitz\".\n\nAs a phenomenon that affected the psyches of a great many adolescents during World War II and the ensuing Cold War, science fiction's Golden Age has left a lasting impression upon society. The beginning of the Golden Age coincided with the first Worldcon in 1939 and, especially for its most involved fans, science fiction was becoming a powerful social force. The genre, particularly during its Golden Age, had significant, if somewhat indirect, effects upon leaders in the military, information technology, Hollywood and science itself, especially biotechnology and the pharmaceutical industry.\n\nA number of influential science fiction authors emerged in the early Golden Age (1938–1946), including the following:\n\nand in the later Golden Age (1947–1959):\n\nAsimov said that \"The dropping of the atom bomb in 1945 made science fiction respectable\" to the general public. He recalled in 1969 \"I'll never forget the shock that rumbled through the entire world of science fiction fandom when ... Heinlein broke the 'slicks' barrier by having an undiluted science fiction story of his published in \"The Saturday Evening Post\"\". The large, mainstream companies' entry into the science fiction book market around 1950 was similar to how they published crime fiction during World War II; authors no longer could only publish through magazines. Asimov said, however, that\n\nHe continued, \"In fact, there was the birth of something I called 'tomorrow fiction'; the science fiction story that was no more new than tomorrow's headlines. Believe me, there can be nothing duller than tomorrow's headlines in science fiction\", citing Nevil Shute's \"On the Beach\" as example.\n\nIt is harder to specify the end of the Golden Age of Science Fiction than its beginning, but several factors changed the market for magazine science fiction in the mid- and late 1950s. Most important was the rapid contraction of the pulp market: \"Fantastic Adventures\" and \"Famous Fantastic Mysteries\" folded in 1953, \"Planet Stories, Startling Stories, Thrilling Wonder Stories\" and \"Beyond\" in 1955, \"Other Worlds\" and \"Science Fiction Quarterly\" in 1957, \"Imagination\", \"Imaginative Tales\", and \"Infinity\" in 1958. In October 1957, the successful launch of the Soviet satellite Sputnik 1 narrowed the gap between the real world and the world of science fiction, sending the West into a space race with the East. Asimov shifted to writing nonfiction he hoped would attract young minds to science, while Robert A. Heinlein became more dogmatic in expressing political and social views in his fiction. Emerging British writers, such as Brian W. Aldiss and J. G. Ballard, cultivated a more literary style, indicating the direction other writers would soon pursue. Women writers, such as Joanna Russ and Judith Merril, emerged. When the leading Golden Age magazine, \"Astounding Stories of Super-Science\", changed its title to \"Analog Science Fiction and Fact\" in 1960, it was clear the Golden Age of Science Fiction was over.\n\n"}
