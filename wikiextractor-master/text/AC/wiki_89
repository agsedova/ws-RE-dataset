Hassan is often referred to in Bangladesh as \"Potua\", a word usually associated with folk artists, due to his down to earth style yet very modern in nature as he always added Cubism other than the folk style to his artworks. In addition to his artistic legacy, two of Hassan's work have come to be part of Bangladesh's political history. The first of this is a monstrous rendition of Yahya Khan, the Pakistani president who ordered genocide in Bangladesh. The second was just before his death, mocking the then dictator of Bangladesh, Hossain Mohammad Ershad. This sketch was titled \"Desh aaj bisshobeheyar khoppre\" (Our land is now in the hand of the champion of shamelessness).\n\nHassan was born in Kolkata on 2 December 1921. His father, Muhammad Hashim, was superintendent of the a local Graveyard. He belonged to a conservative family and his father always opposed to his involvement in paintings. But Quamrul's determination and love for painting made his father enroll Quamrul to Government Institute of Arts (now Government College of Art & Craft), in 1938, under the condition that Quamrul had to pay for his own tuition fee. After his enrollment to the school, Quamrul kept himself busy with not only arts but with other activities such as sports and the Bratachari movement in 1939 and he also joined ARP during the Second World War. He developed connections with the Forward Block, Gononatya Andolon (People's Theatre) and even with several leaders of the Communist Party, got involved with the task of teaching of children and teenagers and contributed to illustrations in publications.\n\nAs a result of his involvement in social and cultural activities, he finished his six-year course in the Art School in nine years. He graduated in 1947. He secured first position in the B Group of the Inter College Bodybuilding competition in 1945. He had become a 'Nayak' of the Bratachari movement. After the partition of India, Quamrul, who was still a student, along with his mother and siblings moved to Dhaka, the then capital of East Pakistan.\n\nHe was involved in the non-cooperation movement of March 1971 and was nominated the chairman of the Resistance Committee of the Hatirpul area. On 23 March, he put up at least ten propaganda posters portraying a monstrous face of Yahya Khan which inspired the freedom Fighters. On 25 March 1971, trenches were dug out late night at Hatirpul area under his leadership. Then he left for Kolkata in the first week of April where he arranged an art exhibition in favor of the liberation war. He came back to Dhaka during the last half of December to help develop the newly liberated Bangladesh. He also designed state monogram of Bangladesh, Freedom Fighters Welfare Trust, Bangladesh Parjatan Corporation, Bangladesh Bank, and Biman Bangladesh Airlines.\n\nAfter the Partition of India, together with Zainul Abedin, he established the Government Institute of Fine Arts (at present, the Faculty of Fine Arts) in 1948. During liberation war he served as the Director of the Art Division of the Information and Radio Department of the Bangladesh Government in exile.\n\nGetting inspired from Zainul Abedin, Jamini Roy, Quamrul Hassan chose to give the folk art tradition a breath of life by incorporating modern ideas in it. He always borrowed the two-dimensionality of pata paintings of fork art in his work, he also attempted to give the quality of three-dimensionality in it. Instead of using mixed colours, in most of his paintings he used primary colors like pata painters. Sometimes, like folk artists, he applied flat colors without creating tonal variations. However, he has attempted to create color perspective by using various colors in one plane, so that a sense of height, distance can be created in the image. This technique was inspired from Henri Matisse. Patriotism was born in him due to his involvement in folk art. Some of his notable works are: \"Goon Tana, The Happy Return, Biral, Nabanna, Gorur Snan\" etc. All of these paintings highlight the lives of lower-class people which has been the topmost priority of his paintings.\n\nHassan was a versatile artist working in practically all media-oil, gouache, watercolors, pastel, etching, woodcut, linocut, pen and pencil. He also worked with woodcuts, specially after the famine of 1974, works that expressed his rage and anger. Quamrul used snakes, jackals and owls to portray the evil in humans, both in his political work and his famine work.\n\nRural women and their plight is another theme Hassan has repeatedly worked on. His treatment of women emphasize the bond between them, most of his paintings of women are of a group of women, only rarely a solo painting can be found. However, he mixes romanticism with realism; the strong curved lines and the contrasted use of color contribute to a sensuous appeal that blunts the edges of harsh reality. His paintings of women can be divided into three phases: the 50s Love and Premarital stage, the end of 50s and the beginning of 70s the happy conjugal life, and the 70s and the 80s the time of marital separation. First stage marks the memories of his late mother. The paintings of the stage were made simply from the painters memories of his lost mother but in an abstracted form. Like the painting three women gossiping over a topic. It was actually his mother gossiping to two other women. Second stage marks the time when he was in love with his wife and they together had a daughter. The notable works of the period can be Afterbath, Jalkeli (waterplay), Loneliness etc. And the third stage marks the time when he and his wife were separated due to some reasons and at this period instead of highlighting some emotions that are visible in his other paintings, he kept on drawing female nudes.\n\nHis political paintings reflected his political understanding and patriotism. Some of his notable works under the category are:\" Freedom Fighters, Female Freedom Fighters, Gonohatyar Agey O Gonohatyar Porey ( Before and after the mass killing)\" etc. His series titled \"Image'74\" shows his political view which portrays the tendency of sacrificing morals and ethics over some personal gains among politicians, bureaucrats and the businessmen of Bangladesh.\n\nHassan died on 2 February 1988 after suffering a massive heart attack while attending the National Poetry Festival. He was buried beside the central mosque of the University of Dhaka.\n\n\n"}

It is native to parts of North America, where it is widespread in Canada and the United States. It has also been noted as an introduced species in parts of Europe and South America. Common names include Pennsylvania smartweed and pinkweed.\n\nPennsylvania smartweed is a variable annual herb reaching to tall. The upright, ribbed stems are branching or unbranched. The lance-shaped leaves reach up to about in length. The blade may be marked with a dark blotch. The brownish ochrea at the base is up to . The inflorescences grow at the top of the stem and from the leaf axils. The flowers have five pinkish or greenish tepals each a few millimeters long.\n\nThis plant grows in moist, disturbed habitat types, such as ponds, reservoirs, riverbanks, irrigated fields, and ditches.\n\nThis plant is an important part of the habitat for waterfowl and other birds, which use it for food and cover. At least 50 species of birds have been observed feeding on the seeds, including ducks, geese, rails, bobwhites, mourning dove, and ring-necked pheasant. The seeds and other parts are eaten by mammals such as the white-footed mouse, muskrat, raccoon, and fox squirrel.\n\nNative Americans have various uses for the plant. The Chippewa use it for epilepsy. The Iroquois use it for horse colic. The Menominee take a leaf infusion for hemorrhage of blood from the mouth and post-partum healing. The Meskwaki use it on bleeding hemorrhoids.\n\n"}

{"id": "2168717", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2168717", "title": "Galilean", "text": "Galilean\n\nGenerically, a Galilean is an inhabitant of Galilee (a region of modern-day Israel). The New Testament notes that the Apostle Peter's accent gave him away as a Galilean (Matthew 26:73 and Mark 14:70). The Galilean dialect referred to in the New Testament was a form of Jewish Aramaic spoken by people in Galilee from the late Second Temple period through the Apostolic Age . Later the term was used to refer to the early Christians by Roman emperors Julian and Marcus Aurelius, among others.\n\nAfter some early expeditions to Galilee to save the Jews there from attack, the Hasmonean rulers conquered Galilee and added it to their kingdom.\n\nThe Galilean Jews were conscious of a mutual descent, religion and ethnicity that they shared with the Judeans. However, there were numerous cultural differences.\n\nThe Pharisaic scholars of Judaism, centered in Jerusalem and Judea, found the Galileans to be insufficiently concerned about the details of Jewish observance – for example, the rules of Sabbath rest. The Talmud says that Yohanan ben Zakkai, a great Pharisee of the first century, was assigned to a post in Galilee during his training. In eighteen years he was asked only two questions of Jewish law, causing him to lament \"O Galilee, O Galilee, in the end you shall be filled with wrongdoers!\" The Pharisaic criticism of Galileans is mirrored in the New Testament, in which Galilean religious passion is compared favorably against the minute concerns of Judean legal scholars, see for example Woes of the Pharisees. This was the heart of a friendly \"crosstown\" rivalry existing between Galilean Zealots and Judean Pharisees.\n\nThe material culture of the 1st century Galilee indicates adherence to the Jewish ritual purity concerns. Stone vessels (which were required by Jewish dietary purity laws) are ubiquitous and mikvehs have been uncovered in most Galilean sites, particularly around synagogues and private houses. \n\nDuring the Great Rebellion (66-70 CE) the Galileans and Idumeans were the most adamant fighters against Rome; they fought the Romans to the death when many Judeans were ready to accept peace terms.\n\nUnlike the Judeans and the Idumeans, the Galileans survived until the 1930s in the village of Peki'in, after which the Jews were expelled to Hadera by the Arab riots. Until 500 years ago, Peki'in had a Jewish majority and in Medieval times, Galilean Jews had presence in many villages such as Kafr Yassif, Biriyya, Alma, and more.\n\n\"Galileans\" (or \"Galilæans\") were also the members of a fanatical sect (Zealots), followers of Judas of Galilee, who fiercely resented the taxation of the Romans, and whose violence contributed to induce the Romans to vow the extermination of the whole Galilean race.\n\n\"Galileans\" was also term used by some in the Roman Empire to name the followers of Christianity, called in this context as the Galilaean faith.\n\n\"Galilean\", as an adjective, describes some aspects of mathematics or astronomy associated with Galileo: see for example Galilean moons and Galilean transformation.\n\n\"Galileans\" are also a fictional race of living planets in the \"Ben 10\" universe that possess the ability to manipulate gravity. The most notable member of this species is Gravattack.\n\n"}

It depicts the face of an uncredited DeVeren Bookwalter as he apparently receives fellatio from an unseen partner. While shot at 24 frames per second, Warhol specified that it should be projected at 16 frames per second, slowing it down by a third.\n\nDespite the salacious title, the film shows only the expression on the young man's face; the implied sexual act itself is not seen. Whether it is a male or a female performing the act is not stated, and the viewer must assume that fellatio is occurring. The salaciousness has also been speculated to be entirely in the title with no fellatio actually being performed.\n\nThe identity of the person performing the act is disputed. Warhol states in his book \"\" (1980) that five different boys performed the fellatio. In this book, Warhol writes that he originally asked Charles Rydell, the boyfriend of filmmaker Jerome Hill, to star in the film, promising that there would be \"five beautiful boys\" to perform the act.\n\nHowever, when Warhol set up the film shoot at The Factory on a Sunday, Rydell failed to show up. Warhol phoned Rydell at Hill's suite at the Algonquin Hotel and asked where Rydell was. Rydell replied that he thought Warhol was kidding, and had no intention of appearing in such a film. When he declined Andy used \"a good-looking kid that happened to be hanging around the Factory that day\", who was later identified as Bookwalter. By that time, the five boys had departed, but Warhol's notoriously poor memory kept the five boys in place for the version given in the much later book \"POPism\".\n\nAccording to Peter Gidal, the film distances the viewer from the experience it purportedly depicts, \"Sometimes the young actor looks bored, sometimes as if he is thinking, sometimes as if he is aware of the camera, sometimes as if he is not.\" Douglas Crimp states that after a few minutes, \"it becomes clear that we will see nothing more than the repetition, with slight variations, of what we've already seen\". This frees the mind to look in a different way. Likewise, the sexual act has the effect of distracting the actor from the presence of the camera, creating a unique kind of unself-consciousness. The film becomes \"a lesson in how to produce a really beautiful portrait without saying 'cheese'!\"\n\nCritic Roy Grundmann argues that \"\"Blow Job\"‘s self-reflexive devices create a new kind of spectatorial address that dislodges audiences from their contemplative positions in a number of ways. \"Blow Job\"‘s reflexivity makes spectators intensely aware that seeing a film makes projecting onto and investing into an image a part of oneself which is also a socialized acculturated act\". Grundmann further claims that \"viewers oscillate between an awareness of their contingency on larger scheme and the promise of ocularcentric mastery of the image\".\n\nIn 1966, Warhol filmed a sequel, \"Eating Too Fast\" (originally titled \"Blow Job #2\") which runs 67 minutes with sound. It features art critic and writer Gregory Battcock as the recipient.\n\n\n"}

Some of its species are known as table coral, elkhorn coral, and staghorn coral. Over 149 species are described. \"Acropora\" species are some of the major reef corals responsible for building the immense calcium carbonate substructure that supports the thin living skin of a reef.\n\nDepending on the species and location, \"Acropora\" species may grow as plates or slender or broad branches. Like other corals, \"Acropora\" corals are colonies of individual polyps, which are about 2 mm across and share tissue and a nerve net. The polyps can withdraw back into the coral in response to movement or disturbance by potential predators, but when undisturbed, they protrude slightly. The polyps typically extend further at night to help capture plankton and organic matter from the water.\n\n\"Symbiodinium\", symbiotic algae, live in the corals' cells and produce energy for the animals through photosynthesis. Environmental destruction has led to a dwindling of populations of \"Acropora\", along with other coral species. \"Acropora\" is especially susceptible to bleaching when stressed. Bleaching is due to the loss of the coral's zooxanthellae, which are a golden-brown color. Bleached corals are stark white and may die if new \"Symbiodinium\" cells cannot be assimilated. Common causes of bleaching and coral death include pollution, abnormally warm water temperatures, increased ocean acidification, sedimentation, and eutrophication.\n\nIn 2014 the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has listed 10 \"Acropora\" species as Threatened. The species are distributed in the Indo-Pacific (over 100 species) and Caribbean (3 species). However, the true number of species is unknown: firstly, the validity of many of these species is questioned as some have been shown to represent hybrids, for example \"Acropora prolifera\"; and secondly, some species have been shown to represent cryptic species complexes .\n\nMost \"Acropora\" species are brown or green, but a few are brightly colored, and those rare corals are prized by aquarists. Captive propagation of \"Acropora\" is widespread in the reef-keeping community. Given the right conditions, many \"Acropora\" species grow quickly, and individual colonies can exceed a meter across in the wild. In a well-maintained reef aquarium, finger-sized fragments can grow into medicine ball-sized colonies in one to two years. Captive specimens are steadily undergoing changes due to selection which enable them to thrive in the home aquarium. In some cases, fragments of captive specimens are used to repopulate barren reefs in the wild.\n\n\"Acropora\" species are challenging to keep in a home aquarium. They require bright light, stable temperatures, regular addition of calcium and alkalinity supplements, and clean, turbulent water.\n\nCommon parasites of colonies in reef aquariums are \"Acropora-eating flatworms\" \"Amakusaplana acroporae\" , and \"red bugs\" (\"Tegastes acroporanus\").\n\nThe following species are recognised in the genus \"Acropora\":\n\n"}

At 15, he joined the Bank of Nova Scotia in Toronto, becoming assistant chief accountant and assistant manager of the Toronto branch. In 1935, he was appointed Secretary of the newly formed Bank of Canada and later became deputy governor. At the outbreak of war, Gordon was appointed Chairman of the Foreign Exchange Control Board, and then from 1941 to 1947, he was Chairman of the Wartime Prices and Trade Board. He became a national figure in Canada during these years, as the WPTB had control over all wages and prices in Canada, and touched the lives of all Canadians. He was also asked to meet with United States economic experts as the USA came into the war, and the U.S. modelled much of its price policy on the Canadian experience. After the war, Gordon was the Canadian representative on the newly formed International Bank for Reconstruction and Development. From 1950 to 1966, he was Chairman and President of the Canadian National Railways. During his colourful career at this post, he re-organised the company, and brought an ailing and bankrupt company into profit.\n\nGordon was involved in the controversy over naming the Queen Elizabeth Hotel, after its founding in Montreal. Quebec nationalists wanted it called Château Maisonneuve in honour of Montreal's founder, Paul Chomedey de Maisonneuve. Gordon decided it should be named for Queen Elizabeth II, who had unexpectedly come to the throne in 1952 while the hotel was still on the drawing boards.\n\nHe was also involved in a controversy in 1962 when he said that no French-Canadian was competent enough to be vice-president of the Canadian National Railway. This statement was ironic because he himself had left high school in grade 10. The febrile atmosphere of the time seized upon these words to imply that he was anti-French, so he proceeded to justify this statement in a more defendable way in the extensive interviews and television appearances made afterwards. He remained a figure of controversy for Quebec nationalists for whom he represented a certain type of English-speaking businessman.\n\nIn 1944, he was made a Companion of the Order of Saint Michael and Saint George. And, in 1968, he was made a Companion of the Order of Canada.\n\nQueen's University in Kingston, Ontario has honoured Gordon, naming a university residence Donald Gordon House, and its conference centre Donald Gordon Centre. He is a member of the Canadian Business Hall of Fame. He was given honorary degrees by several Canadian Universities, including McGill University. He was also a Knight of Grace of the Order of St John of Jerusalem.\n\n"}
{"id": "2168754", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2168754", "title": "Mughal painting", "text": "Mughal painting\n\nMughal painting is a particular style of South Asian, particularly Indian, painting confined to miniatures either as book illustrations or as single works to be kept in albums (muraqqa). It emerged from Persian miniature painting (itself partly of Chinese origin) and developed in the court of the Mughal Empire of the 16th to 18th centuries. The Mughal emperors were Muslims and they are credited with consolidating Islam in South Asia, and spreading Muslim (and particularly Persian) arts and culture as well as the faith.\n\nMughal painting immediately took a much greater interest in realistic portraiture than was typical of Persian miniatures. Animals and plants were the main subject of many miniatures for albums, and were more realistically depicted. Although many classic works of Persian literature continued to be illustrated, as well as Indian works, the taste of the Mughal emperors for writing memoirs or diaries, begun by Babur, provided some of the most lavishly decorated texts, such as the Padshahnama genre of official histories. Subjects are rich in variety and include portraits, events and scenes from court life, wild life and hunting scenes, and illustrations of battles. The Persian tradition of richly decorated borders framing the central image (mostly trimmed in the images shown here) was continued, as was a modified form of the Persian convention of an elevated viewpoint.\nThe Mughal painting style later spread to other Indian courts, both Muslim and Hindu, and later Sikh, and was often used to depict Hindu subjects. This was mostly in northern India. It developed many regional styles in these courts, tending to become bolder but less refined. These are often described as \"post-Mughal\", \"sub-Mughal\" or \"provincial Mughal\". The mingling of foreign Persian and indigenous Indian elements was a continuation of the patronisation of other aspects of foreign culture as initiated by the earlier Turko-Afghan Delhi Sultanate, and the introduction of it into the subcontinent by various Central Asian Turkish dynasties, such as the Ghaznavids.\n\nFrom fairly early the Mughal style made a strong feature of realistic portraiture, normally in profile, and influenced by Western prints, which were available at the Mughal court. This had never been a feature of either Persian miniature or earlier Indian painting. The pose, rarely varied in portraits, was to have the head in strict profile, but the rest of the body half turned towards the viewer. For a long time portraits were always of men, often accompanied by generalized female servants or concubines; but there is scholarly debate about the representation of female court members in portraiture. Some scholars claim there are no known extant likenesses of figures like Jahanara Begum and Mumtaz Mahal, and others attribute miniatures, for example from the Dara Shikoh album or the Freer Gallery of Art mirror portrait, to these famous noblewomen. The single idealized figure of the Riza Abbasi type was less popular, but fully painted scenes of lovers in a palace setting became popular later. Drawings of genre scenes, especially showing holy men, whether Muslim or Hindu, were also popular.\n\nAkbar had an album, now dispersed, consisting entirely of portraits of figures at his enormous court which had a practical purpose; according to chroniclers he used to consult it when discussing appointments and the like with his advisors, apparently to jog his memory of who the people being discussed were. Many of them, like medieval European images of saints, carried objects associated with them to help identification, but otherwise the figures stand on a plain background. There are a number of fine portraits of Akbar, but it was under his successors Jahangir and Shah Jahan that the portrait of the ruler became firmly established as a leading subject in Indian miniature painting, which was to spread to both Muslim and Hindu princely courts across India.\n\nFrom the 17th century equestrian portraits, mostly of rulers, became another popular borrowing from the West. Another new type of image showed the Jharokha Darshan (literally \"balcony view/worship\"), or public display of the emperor to the court, or the public, which became a daily ceremonial under Akbar, Jahangir and Shah Jahan, before being stopped as un-Islamic by Aurangzeb. In these scenes, the emperor is shown at top on a balcony or at a window, with a crowd of courtiers below, sometimes including many portraits. Like the increasingly large halos these emperors were given in single portraits, the iconography reflects the aspiration of the later Mughals to project an image as the representative of Allah on earth, or even as having a quasi-divine status themselves. Other images show the enthroned emperor having meetings, receiving visitors, or in durbar, or formal council. These and royal portraits incorporated in hunting scenes became highly popular types in later Rajput painting and other post-Mughal styles.\n\nAnother popular subject area was realistic studies of animals and plants, mostly flowers; the text of the \"Baburnama\" includes a number of descriptions of such subjects, which were illustrated in the copies made for Akbar. These subjects also had specialist artists, including Ustad Mansur. Milo C. Beach argues that \"Mughal naturalism has been greatly overstressed. Early animal imagery consists of variations on a theme, rather than new, innovative observations\". He sees considerable borrowings from Chinese animal paintings on paper, which seem not to have been highly valued by Chinese collectors, and so reached India.\n\nIn the formative period of the style, under Akbar, the imperial workshop produced a number of heavily illustrated copies of established books in Persian. One of the first, probably from the 1550s and now mostly in the Cleveland Museum of Art, was a \"Tutinama\" with some 250 rather simple and rather small miniatures, most with only a few figures. In contrast the \"Hamzanama\" Akbar commissioned had unusually large pages, of densely woven cotton rather than the usual paper, and the images were very often crowded with figures. The work was \"a continuous series of romantic interludes, threatening events, narrow escapes, and violent acts\", supposedly telling the life of an uncle of Muhammad. Akbar's manuscript had a remarkable total of some 1400 miniatures, one on every opening, with the relevant text written on the back of the page, presumably to be read to the emperor as he looked at each image. This colossal project took most of the 1560s, and probably beyond. These and a few other early works saw a fairly unified Mughal workshop style emerge by around 1580.\n\nOther large projects included biographies or memoirs of the Mughal dynasty. Babur, its founder, had written classic memoirs, which his grandson Akbar had translated into Persian, as the \"Baburnama\" (1589), and then produced in four lavishly illustrated copies, with up to 183 miniatures each. The \"Akbarnama\" was Akbar's own commissioned biography or chronicle, produced in many versions, and the tradition continued with Jahangir's autobiography \"Tuzk-e-Jahangiri\" (or \"Jahangirnama\") and a celebratory biography of Shah Jahan, called the \"Padshahnama\", which brought the era of the large illustrated imperial biography to an end, around 1650. Akbar commissioned a copy of the \"Zafarnama\", a biography of his distant ancestor Timur, but though he had his aunt write a biography of his father Humayun, no illustrated manuscript survives.\n\nVolumes of the classics of Persian poetry usually had rather fewer miniatures, often around twenty, but often these were of the highest quality. Akbar also had the Hindu epic poems translated into Persian, and produced in illustrated versions. Four are known of the \"Razmnama\", a \"Mahabharata\" in Persian, from between 1585 and c. 1617. Akbar had at least one copy of the Persian version of the \"Ramayana\".\n\nMughal court painting, as opposed to looser variants of the Mughal style produced in regional courts and cities, drew little from indigenous non-Muslim traditions of painting. These were Hindu and Jain, and earlier Buddhist, and almost entirely religious. They existed mainly in relatively small illustrations to texts, but also mural paintings, and paintings in folk styles on cloth, in particular ones on scrolls made to be displayed by popular singers or reciters of the Hindu epics and other stories, performed by travelling specialists; very few early examples of these last survive.\n\nIn contrast Mughal painting was \"almost entirely secular\", although religious figures were sometimes portrayed. Realism, especially in portraits of both people and animals, became a key aim, far more than in Persian painting, let alone the Indian traditions. There was already a Muslim tradition of miniature painting under the Turko-Afghan Sultanate of Delhi which the Mughals overthrew, and like the Mughals, and the very earliest of Central Asian invaders into the subcontinent, patronized foreign culture. These paintings were painted on loose-leaf paper, and were usually placed between decorated wooden covers. Although the first surviving manuscripts are from Mandu in the years either side of 1500, there were very likely earlier ones which are either lost, or perhaps now attributed to southern Persia, as later manuscripts can be hard to distinguish from these by style alone, and some remain the subject of debate among specialists. By the time of the Mughal invasion, the tradition had abandoned the high viewpoint typical of the Persian style, and adopted a more realistic style for animals and plants.\n\nNo miniatures survive from the reign of the founder of the dynasty, Babur, nor does he mention commissioning any in his memoirs, the \"Baburnama\". Copies of this were illustrated by his descendents, Akbar in particular, with many portraits of the many new animals Babur encountered when he invaded India, which are carefully described. However some surviving un-illustrated manuscripts may have been commissioned by him, and he comments on the style of some famous past Persian masters. Some older illustrated manuscripts have his seal on them; the Mughals came from a long line stretching back to Timur and were fully assimilated into Persianate culture, and expected to patronize literature and the arts.\n\nThe style of the Mughal school developed within the royal atelier. Knowledge was primarily transmitted through familial and apprenticeship relationships, and the system of joint manuscript production which brought multiple artists together for single works. In some cases, senior artists would draw the illustrations in outline, and more junior ones would usually apply the colours, especially for background areas. Where no artist names are inscribed, it is very difficult to trace Imperial Mughal paintings back to specific artists.\n\nAfter a tentative start under Humayun, the great period of Mughal painting was during the next three reigns, of Akbar, Jahangir and Shah Jahan, which covered just over a century between them.\n\nWhen the second Mughal emperor, Humayun was in exile in Tabriz in the Safavid court of Shah Tahmasp I of Persia, he was exposed to Persian miniature painting, and commissioned at least one work there (or in Kabul), an unusually large painting on cloth of \"Princes of the House of Timur\", now in the British Museum. Originally a group portrait with his sons, in the next century Jahangir had it added to make it a dynastic group including dead ancestors. When Humayun returned to India, he brought two accomplished Persian artists Abd al-Samad and Mir Sayyid Ali with him. His usurping brother Kamran Mirza had maintained a workshop in Kabul, which Humayan perhaps took over into his own. Humayan's major known commission was a \"Khamsa of Nizami\" with 36 illuminated pages, in which the different styles of the various artists are mostly still apparent. Apart from the London painting, he also commissioned at least two miniatures showing himself with family members, a type of subject that was rare in Persia but common among the Mughals.\n\nDuring the reign of Humayun's son Akbar (r. 1556–1605), the imperial court, apart from being the centre of administrative authority to manage and rule the vast Mughal empire, also emerged as a centre of cultural excellence. Akbar inherited and expanded his father's library and atelier of court painters, and paid close personal attention to its output. He had studied painting in his youth under Abd as-Samad, though it is not clear how far these studies went.\n\nBetween 1560 and 1566 the \"Tutinama\" (\"Tales of a Parrot\"), now in the Cleveland Museum of Art was illustrated, showing \"the stylistic components of the imperial Mughal style at a formative stage\". \nAmong other manuscripts, between 1562 and 1577 the atelier worked on an illustrated manuscript of the \"Hamzanama\" consisting of 1,400 cotton folios, unusually large at 69 cm x 54 cm (approx. 27 x 20 inches) in size. This huge project \"served as a means of moulding the disparate styles of his artists, from Iran and from different parts of India, into one unified style\". By the end, the style reached maturity, and \"the flat and decorative compositions of Persian painting have been transformed by creating a believable space in which characters painted in the round can perform\".\n\nSa'di's masterpiece The \"Gulistan\" was produced at Fatehpur Sikri in 1582, a \"Darab Nama\" around 1585; the Khamsa of Nizami (British Library, Or. 12208) followed in the 1590s and Jami's \"Baharistan\" around 1595 in Lahore. As Mughal-derived painting spread to Hindu courts the texts illustrated included the Hindu epics including the Ramayana and the Mahabharata; themes with animal fables; individual portraits; and paintings on scores of different themes. Mughal style during this period continued to refine itself with elements of realism and naturalism coming to the fore. Between 1570–1585, Akbar hired over one hundred painters to practice Mughal style painting.\n\nAkbar's rule established a celebratory theme among the Mughal Empire. In this new period, Akbar persuaded artist to focus on showing off spectacles and including grand symbols like elephants in their work to create the sense of a prospering empire. Along with this new mindset, Akbar also encouraged his people to write down and find a way to record what they remembered from earlier times to ensure that others would be able to remember the greatness of the Mughal empire.\nJahangir had an artistic inclination and during his reign Mughal painting developed further. Brushwork became finer and the colours lighter. Jahangir was also deeply influenced by European painting. During his reign he came into direct contact with the English Crown and was sent gifts of oil paintings, which included portraits of the King and Queen. He encouraged his royal atelier to take up the single point perspective favoured by European artists, unlike the flattened multi-layered style used in traditional miniatures. He particularly encouraged paintings depicting events of his own life, individual portraits, and studies of birds, flowers and animals. The \"Tuzk-e-Jahangiri\" (or \"Jahangirnama\"), written during his lifetime, which is an autobiographical account of Jahangir's reign, has several paintings, including some unusual subjects such as the union of a saint with a tigress, and fights between spiders. Mughal paintings made during Jahangir's reign continued the trend of Naturalism and were influenced by the resurgence of Persian styles and subjects over more traditional Hindu.\n\nDuring the reign of Shah Jahan (1628–58), Mughal paintings continued to develop, but court paintings became more rigid and formal. The illustrations from the \"Padshanama\" (chronicle of the King of the world), one of the finest Islamic manuscripts from the Royal Collection, at Windsor, were painted during the reign of Shah Jahan. Written in Persian on paper that is flecked with gold, has exquisitely rendered paintings. The \"Padshahnama\" has portraits of the courtiers and servants of the King painted with great detail and individuality. In keeping with the strict formality at court, however the portraits of the King and important nobles was rendered in strict profile, whereas servants and common people, depicted with individual features have been portrayed in the three-quarter view or the frontal view.\n\nThemes including musical parties; lovers, sometimes in intimate positions, on terraces and gardens; and ascetics gathered around a fire, abound in the Mughal paintings of this period. Even though this period was titled the most prosperous, artists during this time were expected to adhere to representing life in court as organized and unified. For this reason, most art created under his rule focused mainly on the emperor and aided in establishing his authority. The purpose of this art was to leave behind an image of what the Mughal's believed to be the ideal ruler and state.\n\nAurangzeb (1658–1707) was never an enthusiastic patron of painting, largely for religious reasons, and took a turn away from the pomp and ceremonial of the court around 1668, after which he probably commissioned no more paintings. After 1681 he moved to the Deccan to pursue his slow conquest of the Deccan Sultanates, never returning to live in the north.\n\nMughal paintings continued to survive, but the decline had set in. Some sources however note that a few of the best Mughal paintings were made for Aurangzeb, speculating that they believed that he was about to close the workshops and thus exceeded themselves in his behalf. There was a brief revival during the reign of Muhammad Shah 'Rangeela' (1719–48), but by the time of Shah Alam II (1759–1806), the art of Mughal painting had lost its glory. By that time, other schools of Indian painting had developed, including, in the royal courts of the Rajput kingdoms of Rajputana, Rajput painting and in the cities ruled by the British East India Company, the Company style under Western influence. Late Mughal style often shows increased use of perspective and recession under Western influence.\n\nThe Persian master artists Abd al-Samad and Mir Sayyid Ali, who had accompanied Humayun to India in the 16th century, were in charge of the imperial atelier during the formative stages of Mughal painting. Many artists worked on large commissions, the majority of them apparently Hindu, to judge by the names recorded. Mughal painting generally involved a group of artists, one (generally the most senior) to decide and outline the composition, the second to actually paint, and perhaps a third who specialized in portraiture, executing individual faces.\n\nThis was especially the case with the large historical book projects that dominated production during Akbar's reign, the \"Tutinama\", \"Baburnama\", \"Hamzanama\", \"Razmnama\", and \"Akbarnama\". For manuscripts of Persian poetry there was a different way of working, with the best masters apparently expected to produce exquisitely finished miniatures all or largely their own work. An influence on the evolution of style during Akbar's reign was Kesu Das, who understood and developed \"European techniques of rendering space and volume\".\n\nConveniently for modern scholars, Akbar liked to see the names of the artists written below each miniature. Analysis of manuscripts shows that individual miniatures were assigned to many painters. For example, the incomplete \"Razmnama\" in the British Library contains 24 miniatures, with 21 different names, though this may be an especially large number.\n\nOther important painters under Akbar and Jahangir were:\n\nOthers: Nanha, Daulat, Payag, Abd al-Rahim, Amal-e Hashim, Keshavdas, and Mah Muhammad.\n\nThe sub-imperial school of Mughal painting included artists such as Mushfiq, Kamal, and Fazl. During the first half of the 18th century, many Mughal-trained artists left the imperial workshop to work at Rajput courts. These include artists such as Bhawanidas and his son Dalchand.\n\nMughal-style miniature paintings are still being created today by a small number of artists in Lahore concentrated mainly in the National College of Arts. Although many of these miniatures are skillful copies of the originals, some artists have produced contemporary works using classic methods with, at times, remarkable artistic effect.\n\nThe skills needed to produce these modern versions of Mughal miniatures are still passed on from generation to generation, although many artisans also employ dozens of workers, often painting under trying working conditions, to produce works sold under the signature of their modern masters.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2168758", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2168758", "title": "Euphoria (Australian band)", "text": "Euphoria (Australian band)\n\nEuphoria were an Australian dance-pop trio formed in 1991. They were founded by producer and songwriter Andrew Klippel on keyboards and backing vocals with lead vocals and dancing by Holly Garnett and Keren Minshull. Euphoria had two number-one hits on the ARIA Singles Chart, \"Love You Right\" (November 1991) and \"One in a Million\" (April 1992). Their third single, \"Do for You\" (August 1992), peaked at No. 7. Their sole album, \"Total Euphoria\" (October 1992), reached No. 14 on the related ARIA Albums Chart. Model Jodhi Meares replaced Garnett after she left in 1992. The group disbanded in mid-1993. Holly Garnett died by suicide on 20 October 1998, aged 29.\n\nEuphoria were founded in Sydney in 1991 by producer Andrew Klippel (son of sculptor, Robert Klippel) on keyboards and backing vocals with lead vocals and dancing by both Holly Garnett and Keren Minshull. Klippel and Minshull were bandmates from Electric Soul. Klippel had been in a number of local bands and formed a song writing and production duo, ESP, with Melbourne-based DJ, Ean Sugarman, in the early 1990s. Minshull had previously worked as a session vocalist for Swanee, Noni Hazlehurst, and Jade Hurley. Minshull provided co-lead vocals with Rick Price on \"Celebration of a Nation\" (1988).\n\nOne of the tracks co-written by Klippel and Sugarman, \"Love You Right\", was recorded as a demo. Sugarman provided the band's name after riding with a trucker and playing him the demo, who described it as \"Euphoria\". \"Love You Right\" was issued as a single in October 1991, via ESP/EMI Music Australia. The song and music video were featured on an Australian TV soap opera, \"E Street\". Widespread radio airplay followed, and it reached No. 1 on the ARIA Singles Chart in February 1992, becoming the 24th highest selling single of that year.\n\nThe music video includes two \"E Street\" cast members, Kelley Abbey (who played JoJo Adams) and Simon Baker (Sam Farrell), as backup dancers. At the ARIA Music Awards of 1992 \"Love You Right\" had the group nominated for Best New Talent. It peaked at No. 19 on the Recorded Music NZ Singles Chart in March 1992 and the top 80 in the UK Singles Chart in September.\n\nThe group's second single, \"One in a Million\", was issued in April 1992 and also reached No. 1. On the end of the year singles chart it appeared at No. 51. A third single followed, \"Do for You\" (August), which peaked at No. 7, and the less-successful fourth single, \"I Will Never Leave You\" (November), at No. 41. All four singles appear on their only album, \"Total Euphoria\" (October 1992), which reached No. 14 on the related ARIA Albums Chart. It was co-produced, and all tracks were co-written, by Klippel and Sugarman.\n\nKlippel later claimed that the group had formed after \"Love You Right\" had achieved success. The song had been written and recorded with little expectation of success, and when it became a hit he assembled a group to promote it. Their success was tarnished when it was revealed that Garnett lip-synced to Minshull's vocals in the music video – although Minshull does appear briefly (the reason was that Minshull was 42 at the time, and Garnett was dating Klippel, as well as promotional reasons from the record label who felt Garnett would be the face of the group). A second video for \"Love You Right\" was filmed, with Minshull in a more-prominent role, to promote the single's release in Europe (Minshull later said in an interview on Seven Network’s \"Morning Show\" in 2018 that this was the first time she seen the video). For \"One in a Million\" both Garnett and Minshull shared vocals and screen-time in the video.\n\nAccording to Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, by that time, \"all was not harmonious within the group... It had been decided that the blonde Garnett was a more appropriate face with which to launch and market Euphoria than the dark-haired Minshull. The whole thing backfired, various tensions and bitterness arose within the group.\" Garnett departed in mid-1992, after recording the album, and was replaced by Jodhi Meares on co-lead vocals. Meares appears in the music video for \"I Will Never Leave You\", although she had not recorded the track.\n\nA further single, \"Elated\", was released in July 1993 (No. 66) but the group disbanded soon after. \"Love You Right\" was remixed in 1997, it included a remix by 2 Unlimited. However, the 1997 remix did not chart. McFarlane described the group as, \"one of the first local outfits of the 1990s to embrace a lightweight, techno dance-pop ethic as espoused in the USA by the likes of C + C Music Factory, Black Box and 2 Unlimited.\"\n\nKlippel worked as a songwriter or producer for Human Nature, Marta Sánchez, Katie Noonan, and Jocelyn Brown. He formed the dance bands, Elastic, and A.K. Soul, the latter released singles, \"Free\" and \"Show You Love\", featuring Brown, in 1997.\n\nMinshull and Garnett undertook session vocals work and solo projects. Sugarman relocated to the United States and worked as a DJ, remixer and producer. Minshull continued as a Sydney-based singer-songwriter, releasing an album \"You're Driving\" in 2011 and launching her label, Keren Minshull Music, in 2012. In 2011 she commented that despite their success, she feels that Euphoria is dated and does not reflect the mainstream music of today. However, in a 2018 interview she acknowledged that Euphoria's success helped usher Australia's music industry into the dance genre after years of resistance. Meares returned to modelling and later launched a fashion clothing line.\n\nHolly Garnett died by suicide on 20 October 1998 at the age of 29, partly due to the plight of her older brother, Martin Garnett (born 1966), who is a convicted drug trafficker and was arrested in Thailand in September 1993. Martin was in various Thai prisons and was placed on death row; when he completed his commuted sentence there in 2011 he was transferred to an Indiana prison due to smuggling drugs into that US state (while in a Thai prison). He served the final part of his sentence in Sydney before being freed in 2015.\n\n\n"}

It was named Rhenus adopting the Latin word for the Rhine. Branch offices were established in Antwerp, Mainz, Mannheim and Rotterdam. In 1929 Rhenus merged with Badische Actiengesellschaft, Rheinschiffahrts Actiengesellschaft and other shipping companies merged. In 1934 Hibernia Bergwerksgesellschaft, a subsidiary of VEBA, acquired a majority shareholding in the company.\n\nIn 1969 VEBA restructured. Hugo Stinnes taking over the transport activities of VEBA. In 1971 Hugo Stinnes restructured its inland waterway shipping activities. The Fendel-Stinnes-Schiffahrt company was set up near Duisburg.\n\nIn 1976 Rhenus merged with Fendel-Stinnes-Schiffahrt and WTAG to form Rhenus-WTAG with company headquarters moving to Dortmund. At this stage, Rhenus-WTAG had 40 branch offices throughout Germany. The CCS Combined Container Service was founded at the same time.\n\nIn 1984 Rhenus-WTAG merged with Westfaelische Transport-AG and resumed under the name Rhenus. In 1988 Rhenus was restructured into three companies: Rhenus Weichelt handled road freight transport, Rhenus Lager und Umschlag took on warehousing, transhipment and inland waterway shipping and Rhenus Transport International was responsible for international freight forwarding and air freight.\n\nIn 1990: Hugo Stinnes entered into a strategic alliance with Schenker AG, acquiring a 25% stake in this subsidiary of Deutsche Bahn. In 1991 Stinnes purchased Schenker AG outright and the three Rhenus divisions were restructured again. Rhenus Transport International became part of the newly formed Schenker International; Rhenus Lager und Umschlag then operated under the former name of Rhenus, and Rhenus-Weichelt was merged with Schenker Eurocargo. In 1996 the three divisions were merged.\n\nIn 1993, a 60,000 m² logistics centre opened in Brein. Other logistics centres were opened in the following years in Langgöns, Giessen, Mannheim, Stuttgart, Hanover and Prague. In 1998 Rethmann & Co took over Rhenus.\n\nIn 2000 Rhenus acquired Schweizerische Reederei und Neptun and rebranded it Rhenus Alpina. In the same year, Rhenus started operating the Ikea central warehouse in Salzgitter and launched the International Consolidation Centre in Giessen. In 2002, Rhenus Alpina took over Cargologic and began handling air freight at Bern, Geneva and Zurich Airports. A new logistics centre was built near Paris and an external supplier warehouse for Daimler-Benz opened in Stuttgart. In 2003, Rhenus set up a joint venture with Kerry Logistics in Asia. In 2004 Polish logistics provider Polta was purchased.\nIn December 2014 Rhenus purchased a 50.1% shareholding in Swiss rail freight operator Crossrail. In June 2015 it acquired a 50% shareholding in Austrian rail freight operator LTE Logistik. In January 2019, Rhenus' parent company Rethmann Group acquired Veolia's remaining 30% shareholding of Transdev, and increased its shareholding to 34% by contributing Rhenus Veniro operations to the Transdev portfolio.\n\nRhenus Veniro operates public transport companies in Germany. It was formed in December 2007 when the Eurobahn joint venture between Keolis (60%) and Rhenus (40%) was dissolved, with Rhenus Veniro taking nine bus companies, two railway contracts and a tram contract, while Keolis continued to operate Eurobahn rail services. It currently operates two railway contracts in Rhineland-Palatinate. \n\nIn January 2019, Rethmann Group, the parent company of Rhenus, contributed the Rhenus Veniro operations to the Transdev portfolio as part of its acquisition of Transdev shareholding.\n\n"}

{"id": "2168783", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2168783", "title": "The Delta Force", "text": "The Delta Force\n\nThe Delta Force is a 1986 American action film starring Chuck Norris and Lee Marvin (in his final film appearance) as leaders of an elite group of Special Operations Forces personnel based on the real life U.S. Army Delta Force unit. Directed, co-written and co-produced by Menahem Golan, the film features Martin Balsam, Joey Bishop, Robert Vaughn, Steve James, Robert Forster, Shelley Winters, George Kennedy, and an uncredited Liam Neeson in an early role. Two sequels were produced, entitled \"\" and the direct-to-video \"\". \"The Delta Force\" was \"inspired\" by the hijacking of TWA Flight 847.\n\nIn 1980, Operation Eagle Claw is aborted after a fatal helicopter crash, with the U.S. Delta Force evacuating to their C-130 transports. Among them is Captain Scott McCoy, who, against orders, rescues his wounded comrade, Peterson, from the burning helicopter before the team finally evacuates. McCoy expresses his disgust for the politicians and the military hierarchy that forced the mission to launch despite the risks, and announces his resignation.\n\nFive years later, a group of Lebanese terrorists hijack American Travelways Airlines Flight 282, a Boeing 707 flying from Cairo to New York City via Athens and Rome. Taking all 144 passengers and crew hostage on the Athens-Rome leg, the pro-Khomeini New World Revolutionary Organization (based on Hezbollah), led by two terrorists named Abdul Rafai and Mustafa, force Captain Roger Campbell and his crew to fly the 707 to Beirut, where they make demands to the United States government that, if not met, will result in the death of each of the hostages. During the crisis, they segregate the Jewish passengers from the Americans by forcing a reluctant German flight purser named Ingrid Harding to identify them. A Catholic priest, William O'Malley, joins the Jews in solidarity. Unbeknownst to the authorities, the Jewish hostages are then taken off the plane and transported to a militant-controlled area of Beirut, while a dozen additional henchmen are brought on board.\n\nThe flight departs for Algiers, where the terrorists release the female hostages and children. Meanwhile, Delta Force, led by Colonel Nick Alexander and a recalled-to-duty and newly promoted-to-Major McCoy are deployed to resolve the crisis. Once the female hostages are evacuated, they launch their assault, only to discover too late that there are additional hijackers on board. When the Delta Force blow their cover, Abdul kills a U.S. Navy Diver named Tom Hale. He then forces the pilots to return to Beirut and takes the remaining male passengers with him.\n\nUpon returning to Beirut, the terrorists transport the passengers to a separate location, while the pilots remain in the 707. Working with a sympathetic Greek Orthodox priest, Israeli Army Intelligence prepares an operation to free the hostages. In a prolonged campaign against the terrorists, the Delta Force bide their time to identify the terrorist leaders and locate the hostages. Once the hostages are located, the Delta Force assault the terrorist holdouts, freeing the hostages and evacuating them to the airport. During the battle, McCoy, Peterson, and their team hunt for Abdul and the Jewish hostages. They kill most of the militants but Abdul gravely injures Peterson and flees. While the commandos tend to Peterson, McCoy chases Abdul and tracks him down to an abandoned home. He then engages him into a vicious hand-to-hand fight, breaking Abdul's arm. As the terrorist leader prepares to shoot McCoy, he is killed when McCoy launches a rocket into his car.\n\nWith the hostages and rescue teams secured, the team seizes Flight 282 by secretly infiltrating the airfield through a cotton plantation. Using silenced weapons, Alexander and the Delta team kill the terrorist guards and save the crew. They board the 707 with all of the hostages, taking off to Israel just as McCoy storms the runway on his motorcycle; managing to board after destroying several terrorist jeeps. On board, the team tends to the wounded passengers and the dying Peterson. After having confirmed the hostages are safe and en route home, Peterson says his farewells to McCoy before succumbing to his wounds. In the main cabin the ex-hostages and Delta commandos join together in a rousing rendition of \"America The Beautiful\", not knowing about Peterson's death, except for Alexander, Bobby, McCoy, and O'Malley. In Israel, the Boeing 707 lands safely and the hostages are greeted by their families, while Delta Force disembarks with Peterson's body in tow to their C-130. The team concludes their operation and departs for the United States amidst celebrations by the people.\n\n\n\nAt the 1985 Cannes Film Festival, Cannon announced they would make \"Delta Force\" with their two most popular stars, Chuck Norris and Charles Bronson. The budget was to be $12 million.\n\n\"We look at Chuck as having the potential of a Clint Eastwood,\" said Menahem Golan. \"His acting talent is getting better. He's in the right style, and he's very popular.\"\n\nIn response to the TWA hijacking, Norris said the United States is becoming a \"paper tiger\" in the Middle East. \"What we're facing here is the fact that our passive approach to terrorism is going to instigate much more terrorism throughout the world,\" he said, adding, \"I would have sent the Delta Force immediately.\" \n\n\"I've been all over the world, and seeing the devastation that terrorism has done in Europe and the Middle East, I know eventually it's going to come here,\" added Norris. \"It's just a matter of time. They're doing all this devastation in Europe now, and the next stepping stone is America and Canada. Being a free country, with the freedom of movement that we have, it's an open door policy for terrorism. It's like Khadafy said a few weeks ago. 'If Reagan doesn't back off, I'm going to release my killer squads in America.' And there's no doubt in my mind that he has them.\"\n\nBronson ended up deciding not to appear in the film though he did make \"Death Wish IV\" for Cannon. He was replaced by Lee Marvin. Marvin said the film \"shows the American audience a larger view of terrorism than they're used to seeing on the small screen and the news. There you see a plane at the end of the runway. But what's it like to be on a plane as the facilities deterioriate? It's bad enough on a seven-hour flight - imagine what the bathrooms are like after three or four days.\"\n\nNorris' fee was a reported $2 million.\n\n\"It is the first time that Chuck works with an ensemble of first-class actors,\" said Golan.\n\nBefore the film came out Cannon signed a seven-picture contract with Norris.\n\nFilming started in October 1985. \"The Delta Force\" was entirely shot in Israel. Pentagon scenes were shot at the GG Israel Studios facility near Jerusalem, owned by Menahem Golan and Yoram Globus. The Athens, Beirut, Algiers, and Tel Aviv airport scenes were filmed at Ben Gurion International Airport and its military portion, Lod Air Force Base, although one Athens airport scene where an accomplice of the hijackers exits a taxi, was filmed at the eastern terminal of Ellinikon International Airport while the Athens airport concourse (interior) scenes were filmed in Ben Gurion's main terminal, which at present, is terminal 1. Jaffa was used for scenes of the siege and hostage rescue in the Beirut countryside including midnight oceanic scenes. The film's budget was $9 million.\n\nThe Lockheed C-130H Hercules in the film actually belonged to the Israeli Air Force, registered as 89–9106. It was lent to the Golan-Globus company for filming after it was given a false registration, 14X-FBB and U.S. Air Force designs. Its lease arrangement was similar to Iron Eagle, wherein the United States Air Force refused to participate due to a long-standing policy about not cooperating on any film involving the theft of an aircraft, causing the filmmakers to turn to the Israeli Air Force for the necessary aerial sequences. The army vehicles for the military and terrorists came from the U.S. Army and Israel Defense Forces.\n\nThe Boeing 707-139(B) with the registration N778PA, was operated by several airlines including Olympic Airways, Aer Lingus, Saudia, Turkish Airlines, Pan American World Airways, which operated it as Clipper Skylark from 1962 to 1976. Prior to filming in 1985, the aircraft had been operated by Israeli charter-operator MAOF Air and was retired from commercial service in December 1984. The aircraft was then leased to Golan-Globus Productions in late 1985 while in storage at Tel Aviv (just after the TWA-847 hijacking) and repainted with the fake airline name \"\"American Transworld Airlines\"\" while retaining the MAOF livery, but later changed to \"\"American Travelways Airlines\"\" to avoid confusion and legal action. Upon completion of the film, it was sold to Jet Avionic Systems Incorporated on May 28, 1985. Aerocar Aviation acquired it in January 1986 and sold it to Boeing Military Aircraft Company on March 20, 1986 to be used as a source of spares for the Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker program. The U.S. Air Force acquired it later on and parted its vertical stabilizer and engines for the Boeing KC-135E Stratotanker. N778PA was destroyed by fire in a welding accident while in storage at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in 1992. Portions of the airframe may still exist.\n\nThe 1985 Suzuki SP600 motorcycle used by Chuck Norris was designed by Suzuki specifically for the film. After modifying it and adding the weaponry, Suzuki America gave the bike to Golan-Globus production in Israel prior to filming.\n\nAlan Silvestri's electronic score gained a new life when ABC Sports used it to intro their Indianapolis 500 broadcasts from 1988–1998 and again in 2001. It was also used for the intro of the Brickyard 400 until ABC lost the race rights to NBC Sports in 2001. According to famous Indianapolis 500 anchor Paul Page, he does not want any ESPN/ABC anchor to use this music in intros for the Indianapolis 500 and Brickyard 400 unless he narrates the intros himself.

Quartet Records released a two-disc set in 2013 featuring the Intrada album programme on disc one and the Enigma album listing on disc two; all are now OOP.\n\nMarvin did publicity for the film, which was rare for him. He said the movie was \"a good flick\" and admitted \"but I guess I might be protecting myself, keeping the doors open\" with Cannon. \"There aren't too many firm film offers these days that guarantee money up front.\" Marvin was considering doing a sequel where Delta Force would rescue hostages after a terrorist skyjacking of a luxury liner.\n\n\"The Delta Force\" opened in 1,720 theaters and debuted as #3 in the box office losing to \"The Color Purple\" and \"Down and Out in Beverly Hills\"; it beat \"\" and \"Youngblood\". \"The Delta Force\" earned $5,959,505 on its opening weekend and had a total gross of $17,768,900 in the United States. The film was released on DVD on September 28, 2000. \"The Delta Force\" has been released on Blu-ray in the US, and more recently in the UK by video label Arrow Films.\n\nRotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, reports as of December 2019 that 18% of eleven surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating is 3.9/10. On Metacritic the film has a weighted average score of 37 out of 100, based on 9 critics, indicating \"generally unfavorable reviews\". In a positive review for the \"Chicago Sun Times\", Roger Ebert gave it three out of four stars and called it \"a well-made action film that tantalizes us with its parallels to real life.\" Vincent Canby of \"The New York Times\" wrote that it \"will be the 1986 film all others will have to beat for sheer, unashamed, hilariously vulgar vaingloriousness.\" \"Variety\" described it as \"an exercise in wish fulfillment for those who favor using force instead of diplomacy.\" Kevin Thomas of the \"Los Angeles Times\" wrote in his review: \" ...of so big a project, \"The Delta Force\" is drawn out and complicated.\" Gene Siskel of the \"Chicago Tribune\" gave the film one star out of four and called it \"a prime example\" of \"second-rate action pictures\" and added, \"The action in Beirut is more appropriate for a bad James Bond film than for a subject that has been all too real lately. Norris gets off shooting rocket launchers from his specially built motorcycle, and we sit there stunned at the movie industry's ability to make money off any tragedy.\" Paul Attanasio of \"The Washington Post\" called the film \"one of those disaster movies that Hollywood was churning out 10 years ago,\" which \"doesn't even deliver on its own sordid level. There isn't any action till 70 minutes into the film—and that's a pallid car chase, immediately deflated by composer Alan Silvestri's idiotic disco fanfare.

{"id": "2168786", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2168786", "title": "Wan Chai Pier", "text": "Wan Chai Pier\n\nThe Wan Chai Pier (), or Wan Chai Ferry Pier (), is a pier at the coast of Wan Chai North on the Hong Kong Island of Hong Kong. The pier is operated by Star Ferry, and provides ferry services to Tsim Sha Tsui. The pier is near the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre.\n\nThe current pier is the third generation pier:\n\nAt the end of the Wan Chai reclamation from 1922 to 1929 (Praya East Reclamation Scheme), a pier \"\"120 feet 8 inches long and 35 feet 4 inches wide with four flights of landing steps and situated at the end of Tonnochy Road\"\" was built.\nProbably this pier was damaged in the second World War and had to be repaired. The ferry services between the Wanchai Pier and Jordan Road, Kowloon was in operation as early as 12 November 1949. Because the ferry line mainly catered to passengers on the Hong Kong Island to the east of Wanchai, the China Motor Bus company rerouted its bus route no. 2 so that it passed near the Wanchai Pier. At the same time the bus company started the auxiliary bus route no. 8. The Wanchai Pier was not where it is today. It was located on Gloucester Road, near Tonnochy Road. The bus route no. 8 then and the route no. 11, which entered service later, both had stops on Tonnochy Road.\n\nOn 1 June 1956 the Stewart Pier commenced operation and the ferry service to Jordan Road was rerouted to this pier. On 3 July 1956 a new ferry line to Kowloon City started operation at the Tonnochy Road Pier. This ferry line was terminated on 24 June 1967.\n\nOn 12 November 1963 the ferry service between Hung Hom and Wanchai commenced operation.\n\nFrom 1965 to 1972 Wanchai underwent more land reclamation. The coastline moved north from Gloucester Road to today's Convention Avenue and Hung Hing Road.\n\nIn April 1988 the Jordan Road <-> Wanchai ferry line was terminated and replaced by the new line between Tsim Sha Tsui and Wanchai.\n\nOn 1 April 2011 the Hung Hom <-> Wanchai line was terminated. The Wanchai<->Tsim Sha Tsui line has since been the only remaining ferry service at the Wanchai Pier.\n\nAs the site of the second generation pier is included in the reclamation area of the Central–Wan Chai Bypass project, the government decided to terminate and demolish the 46-year-old second generation Wanchai Pier, and build a new pier at the current coast to the north. The Star Ferry Company that has been operating the Wanchai<->Tsim Sha Tsui ferry line objected to the demolition in 2007.\n\nThe new pier commenced operation on 30 August 2014. It has an area of about 2,200 sq m, about 150 sq m less than the previous pier. The facilities are more or less the same as the Central Star Ferry Pier (Piers no. 7 & 8). The second floor of the new pier will be used for food and catering.\n\nHowever, the second floor reserved for food and catering will have to wait at least half a year to have electricity connection after the pier's operation commenced. Passengers questioned that the new walkway to the new pier was too narrow and insufficient for the passenger flow during peak hours. The Civil Engineering and Development Department replied that the new passenger walkway was designed to accommodate the passenger flow generated by the current ferry line.\n\nThere was a bus terminus right across the Convention Avenue from the Wanchai Pier. The bus terminus commenced operation on 10 March 1968. The China Motor Bus routes 8 and 11 were rerouted there at the same time. As space for a bus terminus was in short supply in Wanchai, the bus terminus was expanded and routes were modified in the 1970s and 80s. After Convention Avenue and Hung Hing Road opened to traffic, a footbridge connecting the Pier and the terminus was built. The terminus was constantly highly saturated and it had been a very important terminus. As the Wanchai North Reclamation Area became more developed, the terminus was never short of passengers.\n\nBus routes operated by the Kowloon Motor Bus, First Bus, Citybus as well as some non-franchised bus companies could be found. Those franchised bus routes provided connections between the pier and other areas in Hong Kong.\n\nBus routes at the bus terminus included: 2A, 2X, 8, 8P, 40, 40M, 905, 960.\nIn the 1970s to 90s, this bus terminus also served as the terminus for Green Minibuses. The first generation Hong Kong Island route 14 (terminated in 1980), route 33 (terminated in 1985) and the current route 36 (relocated to Stewart Road in 1995) minibuses all used this terminus.\n\nOn 6 February 2012, the cross-harbour bus route 930A's morning service to Hong Kong Island was extended to this terminus. On 29 July 2012, the end station of the route 930 was relocated from Admiralty (East) to this terminus. The start station of route 930A's return ride was also relocated to here. These two routes were the first two routes to Tsuen Wan from this terminus. The route 40M used this terminus as the end station. To accommodate the reroute of routes 930 and 930A, the end station of 40M was relocated to the Tamar Central Government Complex and ceased to pass through the Wanchai Pier Terminus.\n\nAccording to the current Sha Tin to Central Link project, the site of the Wan Chai Ferry Pier Public Transport Interchange will be used as the construction site of the Exhibition MTR Station. The terminus is relocated to a site near the coast, a newly reclaimed area to the north of Hung Hing Road, the entrance of which is at the junction of Hung Hing Road and Marsh Road. After the completion of the Exhibition Station, the original site of the bus terminus will be rebuilt into a sheltered transport interchange terminus with 9 single pits, 2 double pits, 1 taxi stand and 2 positions for loading and unloading of goods.\n\n"}

{"id": "2168803", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2168803", "title": "Armand (The Vampire Chronicles)", "text": "Armand (The Vampire Chronicles)\n\nArmand is a fictional character in \"The Vampire Chronicles\" novels written by Anne Rice. At the end of the series, he is approximately 500 years of age. His outward appearance is that of a beautiful adolescent boy, 5’6, with curly auburn hair, large brown eyes and slender fingers. His features are at times compared figuratively to those of Cupid or a Botticelli angel.\n\nArmand is born in 1481 in the former Kiev Rus to the acclaimed hunter Ivan. Armand's original name is Andrei.\n\nAs a child he has the ability to paint vivid pictures of Jesus Christ, Madonna, and the Eastern Orthodox Saints. His astonished parents eventually reveal his gift to the monks in the Monastery of the Caves, who live an ascetic life buried beneath earth, sustained only by water and small amounts of food. Both the monks and Andrei believe he is destined to live such a life, while his father is appalled by the idea. When their ruler, Prince Michael, orders Andrei to paint an icon and bring it to the castle of his brother, the supposedly dead Prince Feodor, Andrei is captured by Tartars and brought as a slave to Constantinople and subsequently sold to a Venetian brothel. There, he is subjected to horrific sexual abuse and develops amnesia.\n\nMarius, a 1500-year-old vampire then living as a painter in Venice, rescues Andrei, giving him an education and a luxurious life. Marius renames him Amadeo. Marius is in love with a courtesan named Bianca Solderini, yet cannot bring himself to turn her into a vampire. Instead, he chooses Amadeo for his beauty, youth and painting skills (apparently lost, along with his memories) to educate 'in the way of the blood', so as to eventually make him a vampire. Amadeo loves Marius single-mindedly and is eager to become a vampire. He does not understand Marius' hesitation to turn him, and in an act of rebellion and anger he seduces an English Lord, whom he eventually abandons after a few nights. However, the English Lord becomes obsessed with Amadeo and enraged by his betrayal, wounds him with a poisoned blade. In doing this, he forces Marius to turn Amadeo into a vampire to save his life. Amadeo is 17 years old at the time of his transformation.\n\nShortly after Amadeo becomes a vampire, Marius' Palazzo is attacked by a Satanic cult of vampires, led by the vampire Santino. They set Marius on fire and kidnap Amadeo and the other children at the Palazzo and take them to Rome. Santino tortures Amadeo by burning his friends to death right in front of him and starving him in a cellar until he is forced to feed on his best friend and innocent children. After five months of such psychological torture, Amadeo is ready to believe everything the cult said in exchange for their love and to forget all he has known before. Because of his strength, he is named the leader of the Parisian coven in 1580, and renamed Armand, since a name with the word 'God' (Deo) in it seemed unfit for the leader of a satanic coven.\n\nRoughly two hundred years later the coven tries to capture Lestat (turned vampire by Magnus, another old target of the coven) and considers destroying him, but Lestat is stronger than Armand, and declares them ridiculous and unfit for the times in which they lived. He disproves their beliefs that they could not look upon crosses, walk into churches, or live in places of light. Realizing that Lestat is right about the coven's obsolescence, Armand falls into despair and destroys most of his own followers. He tries to persuade Lestat to take him along on his journeys, but Lestat refuses. Instead, Armand joins the Théâtre des Vampires and learns to move among mortals.\n\nIn the late 19th century, Lestat's fledglings Claudia and Louis happen upon the theater. Armand sees Louis as a new possibility of integrating into the modern world. When he cannot persuade Louis to leave Claudia, he manages to get rid of her by burning her to death in the sun, and then lets Louis burn the theater with the vampires in it so they can leave together. They stay together until around the 1920s, then part because Louis has never fully recovered from the loss of Claudia, and knows that Armand is at least partly responsible for her death.\n\nAfter the incidents in \"Interview with the Vampire\", Daniel Molloy tries to find Lestat, but is instead found by Armand. Daniel provides a link for Armand to the new time, and they form a relationship. However, Daniel grows more and more impatient, longing to be turned to a vampire, and he and Armand become estranged. By 1985, Daniel manages to destroy his health to such a degree that he is near death, so Armand finally turns him into a vampire. Daniel is Armand's only fledgling to date, and they can no longer stay together afterward.\n\nWhen Lestat brings back Veronica's Veil from his journey in \"Memnoch the Devil\", Armand is struck by the sight of it; his religious fervor revived, he goes into the sun in an attempt to destroy and redeem himself. He not only survives, however, but manages miraculously to save a girl named Sybelle from her abusive brother. Sybelle and her protector, Benji, restore Armand with the blood of a drug dealer, and the three of them become very close. When Armand dictates the book \"The Vampire Armand\" to David Talbot, former head of the Talamasca and by then Lestat's fledgling, he leaves Sybelle and Benji in Marius' care. The latter then turns them into vampires.\n\nIn the 1994 film \"Interview with the Vampire\", Armand was portrayed by Antonio Banderas. Contrary to his book description, this version of Armand was a fully-grown adult (of Spanish origin instead of Russian) when he was turned into a vampire.\n\nIn the 2002 film \"Queen of the Damned\", Armand was portrayed by Matthew Newton.\nIn the 2006 musical, \"Lestat\", Armand was first portrayed by Jack Noseworthy, who left the role a week after the pre-Broadway performance began, and was then replaced by his understudy Drew Sarich, who went with the production onto Broadway.\n"}

It is located in the Meyerland area of Houston, Texas. The school has 553 students and 111 faculty members. It is accredited by the Southwestern Association of Episcopal Schools and is a member of the Houston Association of Independent Schools (HAIS) and the Texas Association of Private and Parochial Schools (TAPPS). Starting in 2020, STES will embark on a $29,000,000 construction project to restore and enhance the school campus. Construction is set to finish between 2023 and 2025.\n\nThe school opened in September, 1955, with the founder T. Robert Ingram, five teachers, and eighty-five students in kindergarten and primary grades. Its first high school class graduated in 1967. Since then, many graduates have gone on to universities and trade schools throughout the nation and abroad.\n\nThe school's mission is \"to form honorable men and women through a classical education grounded in a Christ-centered world view.\" Starting at the kindergarten level, the school offers a structured, classical education.\n\nThe lower school curriculum includes formal instruction in grammar and composition, phonics and spelling, and reading comprehension. The earlier years are largely foundational: students are taught to think about language as a logical, hierarchical progression. In later years, students sharpen these skills and apply them to reading literature, both secular and sacred, and writing short essays. In addition to language, students also receive instruction in arithmetic and mathematical reasoning throughout their entire course of study.\n\nThe middle school curriculum continues the study of language arts: grammar, vocabulary acquisition, writing, and literature. The faculty maintains a largely prescriptionist approach to the study of grammar and syntax and, to this end, grammar is approached in a rigorous, systematic way. Sentence parsing and diagramming are frequently employed to demonstrate the organization of grammatical constructs. As the curriculum progresses, students will be expected to write longer essays about a variety of topics incorporating a more varied lexicon and complex grammatical forms. They will be graded on both style and content. Additionally, students will apply all of their language arts skills to analyzing and criticizing great English language works.\n\nStudents will also continue their study of mathematics, building on the foundation set in the lower school curriculum. The six and seventh grade are largely devoted to the study of pre-algebra and elementary algebra concepts: fractions, integers, square roots and exponents, decimals, and the Cartesian coordinate system, among others. Eighth graders will undertake a formal study of Algebra I to prepare them for the rigors of upper school mathematics.\n\nMiddle school students take a variety of other courses and have a selection of electives available to them. Social studies include investigation of the major political, economic, and social events that shaped the ancient and classical world and provides context for a deeper appreciation of Biblical history. The scientific method is presented through a detailed study of physical and life sciences, wherein students will have the opportunity to participate in exciting demonstrations and experiments that elucidate core concepts. The study of Latin and a modern Romance language (either French or Spanish) is also an important part of the curriculum as is development of basic technology competency critical to navigating the Information age. Finally, electives like choir, strings, band, highland dancing, art, speech, and theater help students to develop important skills and, in many cases, find a lifelong passion.\n\nThe upper school curriculum is primarily intended to prepare students for higher education and to this end students take core, college-preparatory courses and electives based on their individual interests.\n\nThe School has an exceptionally well-developed Advanced Placement (AP) program, wherein students take classes that closely parallel university-level courses in the same subject. These classes follow a strict syllabus and are graded more rigorously than non-AP courses. They culminate in a standardized, comprehensive exam each spring, a passing score on which may earn the student college credit. Most St. Thomas students take at least one AP course throughout their four years and many take two or more.\n\nStudents are required to take English for all four years, and each course is organized along a thematic axis: 9th grade- Epic Literature, 10th- American Literature, 11th- British Literature, 12th- Comparative Literature. Eleventh and Twelfth grade English are each offered with an AP option for well-prepared students intending to sit the national exams in Language and Literature. Each year, upper school students are required to write a comprehensive research paper in addition to the variety of shorter analysis papers they prepare. Central to the English curriculum is a required summer reading program for all students: these carefully selected fiction and non-fiction works are intended to inculcate a lifelong love of reading for pleasure. Finally, students will continue to refine their grammar, syntax, and vocabulary through drills and weekly quizzes in anticipation of standardized tests like SAT and ACT.\n\nAll students take four years of mathematics to include the studies of geometry, algebra II, trigonometry, pre-calculus, calculus, and differential equations. In recent years, students have been divided into an “Accelerated” or “Level” track. The course of study is largely the same, but the “Accelerated” track includes a more in-depth analysis of theoretical topics whereas the “Level” track takes a more applied approach. The culmination of the “Accelerated” track is usually AP Calculus or differential equations whereas “Level” students can choose between calculus, statistics, and finite math.\n\nUpper school students are required to take a minimum of three years of natural science. These courses include biology, chemistry, and physics, some of which includes a weekly, mandatory after-school laboratory section. Upon completion of first year courses in each subject, students may elect to take the corresponding AP course. During certain years, based on student demand, geology and AP Environmental Science are available as natural science electives.\n\nRequired social sciences classes are: two years of American/Texas history, one year of American politics and economics, and one year of history of western philosophy. Well-prepared students may opt to take AP US History during 10th grade and AP US Government & AP Macroeconomics during 11th grade. These courses are substantially more rigorous than their non-AP counterparts and follow the College Board's AP syllabus closely. A variety of social science electives are also typically offered to upperclassman: AP Modern European History, AP Comparative Politics, AP Human Geography, and AP Psychology.\n\nThe study of Latin is an integral part of the Upper School curriculum and is also divided into two tracks: Accelerated and Level. The Level course is intended for students with little or no previous experience with Latin and includes two years study of basic grammatical forms and vocabulary to be applied to translation of simple works. Following the first two years, students will take two “Topics” courses that cover Roman and Greek culture and society and analysis of works in translation. The Accelerated course is for students with a strong foundation in elementary Latin grammar and vocabulary. During the foundational years, students will learn more complex grammatical constructs and build their lexicon. They will apply the aforementioned to translating increasingly complex Latin prose and poetic works in many cases in their original form. Seneca, Cicero, and Horus are several of the writers typically covered. The Accelerated course culminates in AP Latin Virgil, wherein students translate and analyze substantial portions of Virgil's Aeneid. Well-prepared students often complete the Accelerated course by the end of their junior year. In past years, these students could then prepare to sit the AP Latin Literature exam, however this exam has recently been discontinued. Accelerated students who wish to continue their study of the Latin language may do so by engaging in a course of self-study directed by a faculty mentor. Both Level and Accelerated students are encouraged to compete in annual Latin competitions put on by the American Classical League. National Junior Classical League(NJCL) is a youth organization of secondary school students sponsored by the American Classical League. \n\nModern languages available to St. Thomas students are: Spanish, French, and Chinese. Well-prepared students, who begin their study of a particular language in middle school, may sit the corresponding AP exam during their Senior Year. In all cases, the modern language program at St. Thomas aims to give students a strong foundation in four key skill areas: reading, writing, listening, and speaking. To this end, group activities and cultural competency are an integral part of each course.\n\nElectives offered to students vary each year but typically include: yearbook, speech and debate, visual arts, band, dance, drama, mock trial, computer science, and physical education.\n\nAncillary to the curriculum is a dedicated college counseling service available to all upper school students. This includes daily office hours with the counselor, personalized college search help, college visits, essay editing, practice interviews, scholarship and financial aid information, and monthly workshops and newsletters.\n\nThe school has a student bus service from and to Pearland.\n\nThe school offers a wide range of extracurricular and cocurricular activities for students at all levels.\n\nThese include a Mock Trial team that has won 14 regional championships and a state championship, and a yearbook program that has won two Silver Crown and four Gold Crown Awards from the Columbia Scholastic Press Association, most recently in 2012. The yearbook has also won multiple National Pacemaker Awards, the highest national recognition for American student publications.\n\nSTES finished in third place overall at the 2006 TAPPS State Academic Meet. Two STES students tied for 1st place in the overall science category, making top scores in biology, physics, and chemistry.\n\nTwenty-six percent of the Class of 2008 are National Merit semifinalists or commended students.\n\nSTES students have won many accolades in sports competitions as well. The soccer program placed first in the TAPPS state championships in 1994 and 1998, and most recently in 2015-16 Season led By Head Coach, Chris White. The boys varsity cross country team has won 5 Tapps 3A state championships from 2009-2012 and again in 2014 while the varsity girls won their first Championship in 2010.

{"id": "2168812", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2168812", "title": "Beriah Magoffin", "text": "Beriah Magoffin\n\nBeriah Magoffin (April 18, 1815 – February 28, 1885) was the 21st Governor of Kentucky, serving during the early part of the Civil War. Personally, Magoffin adhered to a states' rights position, including the right of a state to secede from the Union, and he sympathized with the Confederate cause. Nevertheless, when the Kentucky General Assembly adopted a position of neutrality in the war, Magoffin ardently held to it, refusing calls for aid from both the Union and Confederate governments.\n\nIn special elections held in June 1861, Unionists captured nine of Kentucky's ten congressional seats and obtained two-thirds majorities in both houses of the state legislature. Despite Magoffin's strict adherence to the policy of neutrality, the Unionist legislature did not trust him and routinely overrode his vetoes. Unable to provide effective leadership due to a hostile legislature, Magoffin agreed to resign as governor in 1862, provided he could choose his successor. Lieutenant governor Linn Boyd had died in office, and Magoffin refused to allow Speaker of the Senate John F. Fisk to succeed him as governor. Accordingly, Fisk resigned and the Kentucky Senate elected Magoffin's choice, James F. Robinson, as speaker. Magoffin then resigned, Robinson ascended to the governorship, and Fisk was re-elected as Speaker of the Senate.\n\nAfter the war, he encouraged acceptance of the Union victory and passage of the Thirteenth Amendment. He died February 28, 1885. Magoffin County, Kentucky was named in his honor.\n\nBeriah Magoffin was born on April 18, 1815 in Harrodsburg, Kentucky. He was the son of Beriah and Jane (McAfee) Magoffin. His father was an immigrant from County Down, Ireland, and his mother was the daughter of Samuel McAfee, a prominent pioneer in early Kentucky.\n\nMagoffin's early education was obtained in the common schools of Harrodsburg. In 1835, he graduated from Centre College in Danville, Kentucky, and in 1838, he earned a law degree from Transylvania University in Lexington, Kentucky. Afterward, he moved to Jackson, Mississippi where he began his legal career. From 1838 to 1839, he served as Reading Clerk for the Mississippi state senate.\n\nMagoffin returned to Kentucky in 1839 due to an illness. He continued his legal practice in Harrodsburg, and was appointed police judge of Harrodsburg by Governor Robert P. Letcher in 1840. On April 21, 1840, he married Anna Nelson Shelby. Shelby was the granddaughter of Kentucky's first and fifth governor, Isaac Shelby. Ten of the couple's children survived infancy.\n\nMagoffin became active in the Democratic Party, serving as a presidential elector in 1844, 1848, 1852, and 1856 and as a delegate to the Democratic National Convention in 1848, 1856, 1860, and 1872. He served one term in the Kentucky Senate in 1850, but declined his party's nomination for a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives in 1851. In 1855 was the Democratic nominee for lieutenant governor, running on a ticket with Beverly L. Clarke, who was defeated by Know Nothing candidate Charles S. Morehead.\n\nMagoffin was elected governor of Kentucky by a vote of 76,187 to 67,283 over Joshua Fry Bell, taking office on August 30, 1859. He supported states' rights and the institution of slavery. Although he believed in the right of states to secede from the union, he hoped to avoid this outcome by reaching an agreement between the southern and northern states. To that end, he wrote a circular letter to the governors of the slave states on December 9, 1860 detailing a plan to save the Union.\n\nMagoffin's plan was to unite the slave states around a set of minimum concessions to see if the North would accept them as an alternative to war. The concessions included a constitutional amendment repealing any state law that interfered with enforcement of the Fugitive Slave Act, passage of amendments to the Fugitive Slave Act ensuring that any state that would not return a fugitive slave or obstructed a slave's return would compensate the owner of the slave, passage of a law requiring extradition of anyone indicted by a grand jury for enticing the escape of a slave, passage of an amendment to the constitution guaranteeing slavery in all current and future territories south of 36 degrees north latitude, passage of an amendment to the constitution guaranteeing all states the right of using the Mississippi River, and provide protection for southern states in the U.S. Senate from oppressive slavery legislation. After the slave state governors refused Magoffin's plan, he endorsed the Crittenden Compromise, authored by fellow Kentuckian John J. Crittenden.\nIn January 1861, Magoffin called the state legislature into special session and asked them to call a convention to determine Kentucky's course in the Civil War. The Unionist majority in the legislature feared that the vote of the convention would be to take Kentucky out of the Union; consequently, they refused to call the convention. In response to President Abraham Lincoln's call for troops on April 15, 1861, Magoffin defiantly declared by telegram, \"I will send not a man nor a dollar for the wicked purpose of subduing my sister Southern States.\" Encouraged by Magoffin's rebuff of Lincoln, Confederate Secretary of War LeRoy Pope Walker requested Kentucky troops for the southern cause a week later, but Magoffin similarly refused him.\n\nMagoffin called another special session of the legislature in May 1861. Again, the legislators refused to call a convention to determine the state's course in the war. Instead, they approved a resolution of neutrality, and Magoffin proclaimed this position on May 20, 1861. Later that month, Magoffin sent a letter to Confederate President Jefferson Davis asking that he recognize and honor Kentucky's neutrality. In August, he sent an identical letter to President Lincoln.\n\nAlthough Magoffin pledged \"to abide by the will of the majority of the people in the state\" and to uphold the state and federal constitutions, Unionists in the legislature did not trust Magoffin. In the state's special elections in June 1861, Unionist candidates swept nine of Kentucky's ten congressional districts and obtained two-thirds majorities in both houses of the General Assembly. From then on, they routinely overrode Magoffin's vetoes.\n\nIn early September 1861, both federal and Confederate troops entered Kentucky. Magoffin declared both sides equally guilty of violating Kentucky's neutrality and demanded that both sides withdraw. A resolution calling for immediate withdrawal by both Union and Confederate forces was defeated in the legislature. Instead, the legislature passed a resolution ordering only the Confederate troops out of the state. Magoffin vetoed the resolution, but his veto was overridden, and he obediently issued the order for the Confederates to withdraw. In November 1861, a self-constituted convention of southern sympathizers met at Russellville, Kentucky in order to form a provisional Confederate government for the state. Despite his southern sympathies, Magoffin denounced the actions of this convention.\n\nMagoffin and the legislature continued to clash throughout the remainder of 1861 and into 1862. They found agreement only on the most menial of legislation, such as a bill to allow the common schools to continue the sessions that had been interrupted by the outbreak of hostilities in 1861. He found particularly onerous a bill forfeiting the citizenship of anyone who fought for or aided the Confederacy, but in March 1862, his veto of the bill was overridden. Magoffin also opposed the military rule of Brigadier General Jeremiah T. Boyle, who he believed was violating the civil rights of states' rights advocates, even if they did not advocate secession.\n\nCalls by the legislature for Magoffin's resignation had begun as early as September 30, 1861. On August 16, 1862, Magoffin declared his willingness to resign on the condition that he be allowed to choose his successor. Because Lieutenant Governor Linn Boyd had died in office in 1859, Speaker of the Senate John F. Fisk was next in line for the governorship. Magoffin refused to accept Fisk as his successor, so Fisk resigned as speaker and the senate elevated Magoffin's choice, James F. Robinson, to speaker. Magoffin resigned as governor on August 18, 1862, and Robinson assumed the office of governor for the remainder of Magoffin's term.\n\nAfter the war, Magoffin returned to his legal practice and engaged in agricultural pursuits in Harrodsburg. A series of land speculation ventures near Chicago, Illinois made him very wealthy. He encouraged his fellow Kentuckians to accept the results of the war. He advocated for civil rights for blacks and urged passage of the Thirteenth Amendment.\n\nIn his last act of public service, Magoffin represented Mercer County in the Kentucky House of Representatives from 1867 to 1869. He died at home on February 28, 1885 and was buried in Spring Hill Cemetery in Harrodsburg. In 1900, a monument was erected in the cemetery in Magoffin's honor. Magoffin County, Kentucky was created in 1860 and also named in his honor.\n\n\n\n"}

In 1915, the company moved to Stockholm with half its employees.

Powell\n\nLazarus Whitehead Powell (October 6, 1812 – July 3, 1867) was the 19th Governor of Kentucky, serving from 1851 to 1855. He was later elected to represent Kentucky in the U.S. Senate from 1859 to 1865.\n\nThe reforms enacted during Powell's term as governor gave Kentucky one of the top educational systems in the antebellum South. He also improved Kentucky's transportation system and vetoed legislation that he felt would have created an overabundance of banks in the Commonwealth. Powell's election as governor marked the end of Whig dominance in Kentucky. Powell's predecessor, John J. Crittenden, was the last governor elected from the party of the Commonwealth's favorite son, Henry Clay.\n\nFollowing his term as governor, Powell was elected to the U.S. Senate. Before he could assume office, President James Buchanan dispatched Powell and Major Benjamin McCulloch to Utah to ease tensions with Brigham Young and the Mormons. Powell assumed his Senate seat on his return from Utah, just prior to the election of Abraham Lincoln as president. Powell became an outspoken critic of Lincoln's administration, so much so that the Kentucky General Assembly asked for his resignation and some of his fellow senators tried to have him expelled from the body. Both groups later renounced their actions.\n\nPowell died at his home near Henderson, Kentucky shortly following a failed bid to return to the Senate in 1867.\n\nPowell was born on October 6, 1812 near Henderson, Kentucky, the third son of Lazarus and Ann McMahon Powell. He attended the common schools of Henderson, and was tutored by George Gayle. He earned a Bachelor of Arts degree from Saint Joseph College in Bardstown, Kentucky in 1833, and began studying law under John Rowan. He then enrolled in the Transylvania University School of Law, studying under Justice George Robertson and Judge Daniel Mayes. He was admitted to the bar in 1835, and partnered with Archibald Dixon to start a law practice in Henderson. The two remained partners until 1839.\n\nOn November 8, 1837, Powell married Harriet Ann Jennings. The couple had three sons before Jennings died on July 30, 1846.\n\nA Democrat in a Whig district, Powell's political career began with an 1836 bid for a seat in the Kentucky House of Representatives. He campaigned vigorously while his opponent, John G. Holloway, relied largely on his party affiliation to carry the election. This proved a critical misstep for Holloway, as Powell secured the surprise victory. Holloway apparently learned from his mistake. Upon the completion of Powell's term in 1838, Holloway challenged Powell again, and defeated him by a considerable majority. Six year later, Powell was chosen as a presidential elector on the Democratic ticket, supporting James K. Polk.\n\nIn 1848, Kentucky Democrats nominated Linn Boyd for governor, but Boyd declined the nomination. Powell was chosen to replace Boyd on the ticket, largely due to the influence of James Guthrie. The Whig party nominated Senator John J. Crittenden, and the race was complicated by former Vice President Richard Mentor Johnson's announcement that he would run as an independent Democratic candidate. Knowing the Democrats' chances were dimmed by having two candidates in the race, Powell arranged a meeting with Johnson, following which the latter withdrew his candidacy and pledged his support to Powell. Nevertheless, Crittenden won the election.\n\nIn the gubernatorial election of 1851, Powell was once again the Democratic Party nominee. The Whigs nominated Powell's friend and law partner, Archibald Dixon. Powell and Dixon traveled the state together, eating at the same taverns, speaking from the same platforms, and generally showing cordiality and friendliness that was rare in Kentucky politics in those days. Powell's margin of victory in the general election was a thin 850 votes, while Whig candidate John P. Thompson defeated the Democratic nominee for lieutenant governor, Robert Wickliffe, by several thousand votes. A third candidate for governor, abolitionist Cassius M. Clay, received 3,621 votes. Powell was the first Democrat elected to the office in almost twenty years. (John L. Helm had ascended to the governorship on Crittenden's resignation.)\n\nThe Whigs also maintained control of the General Assembly, and although Governor Powell was largely able to cooperate with his political opponents, some clashes did occur. As a result of the 1850 census, the General Assembly re-apportioned the state into ten congressional districts. Powell vetoed the redistricting, noting that the districts had been gerrymandered to give the fading Whig party control over the state delegation. The legislature overrode the veto. The governor was successful, however, in vetoing legislation that he felt would have created an overabundance of banks in the Commonwealth.\n\nPowell implemented the use of the state's sinking fund to pay interest on school bonds, a measure which had passed over Governor Helm's veto, but Helm refused to carry out. In 1855, Kentucky's voters passed by landslide a measure to raise the school tax from two cents per hundred dollars of taxable property to five cents per hundred dollars. The measure enjoyed the support of both Governor Powell and superintendent of public schools Robert Jefferson Breckinridge. Under the leadership of Powell and Breckinridge, Kentucky's school system became among the strongest in the antebellum South.\n\nAmong Powell's other successes as governor was his successful lobbying of the legislature to conduct a geological survey in 1854. He also encouraged private investment in transportation in the state. During his term, the state went from having of railroad track in operation to having in operation.\n\nIn January 1858, Powell was elected to the United States Senate. In April of that year, President James Buchanan appointed Powell and Major Benjamin McCulloch commissioners to negotiate settlements with the Mormons in Utah. On arriving in Utah, Powell and McCulloch issued a proclamation by President Buchanan offering clemency to Mormons who agreed to submit to Federal authority. The offer was accepted, and violence was averted.\n\nSenator Powell favored Kentucky's neutrality policy during the Civil War, but nationally, the conflict put him in a tenuous political situation. On one hand, he favored a strong national government and a strict interpretation of the U.S. Constitution. On the other hand, he was an opponent of coercion, and due to Kentucky's proximity to the Southern states, maintained a more sympathetic view of the southern cause than legislators from more northern states. During his term as governor, Powell had been critical of Northern states that refused to abide by the Fugitive Slave Act.\n\nIn 1861, Senator Powell vigorously condemned President Lincoln's decision to suspend the writ of habeas corpus. In 1862, he denounced the arrest of some citizens of Delaware—officially, the arrests were called \"resolutions of inquiry\"—as a violation of constitutional rights. These stances led to calls for his resignation by the Kentucky General Assembly in 1861, and some of his colleagues, led by Kentucky's other senator, Garrett Davis, unsuccessfully attempted to have him expelled from the Senate. Before the end of the war, both the General Assembly and Davis admitted being wrong in their attempts to remove him.\n\nFollowing his successful defense against calls for his removal, Powell continued speaking against what he saw as violations of constitutional rights. In January 1863, he condemned General Order No. 11, an edict by Ulysses S. Grant that barred Jews from the Department of Tennessee, which included regions of Kentucky. In the same speech, he rebuked federal military interference with the elections in Kentucky. In 1864, he opposed a constitutional amendment aimed at freeing the slaves.\n\nFollowing his term in the Senate, he returned to Henderson and resumed his law practice. He was a delegate to the Union National Convention in 1866. In 1867, he was again nominated to the U.S. Senate, but after several ballots over several months, the General Assembly had not elected him. Powell believed that many of the legislators had been elected as a result of election interference by Northern forces, and that their intent was to prevent Kentucky from electing a senator at all, diminishing her influence nationally. In light of this belief, he urged the Democrats to withdraw his name and nominate someone more palatable to Union sympathizers. This they did, putting forth the name of Garrett Davis, who was subsequently elected.\n\nPowell died in his home on July 3, 1867. The cause of death was apoplexy, apparently the result of the toll years of rheumatism had exacted on his nervous system. He is buried at the Fernwood Cemetery in Henderson, Kentucky. The state erected a high marble monument over his grave in 1870. Powell County, Kentucky, is named in honor of Governor Powell.\n\n\n\"The Encyclopedia of Kentucky\" lists the name as \"Mahon.\"<br>\n\"The Encyclopedia of Kentucky\" records that the couple had four children.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2168838", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2168838", "title": "James Garrard", "text": "James Garrard\n\nJames Garrard (January 14, 1749 – January 19, 1822) was an American farmer, Baptist minister and politician who served as the second governor of Kentucky from 1796 to 1804. Because of term limits imposed by the state constitution adopted in 1799, he was the last Kentucky governor elected to two consecutive terms until the restriction was eased by a 1992 amendment, allowing Paul E. Patton's re-election in 1999.\n\nAfter serving in the Revolutionary War, Garrard moved west to the part of Virginia that is now Bourbon County, Kentucky. He held several local political offices and represented the area in the Virginia House of Delegates. He was chosen as a delegate to five of the ten statehood conventions that secured Kentucky's separation from Virginia and helped write the state's first constitution. Garrard was among the delegates who unsuccessfully tried to exclude guarantees of the continuance of slavery from the document. In 1795, he sought to succeed Isaac Shelby as governor. In a three-way race, Benjamin Logan received a plurality, but not a majority, of the electoral votes cast. Although the state constitution did not specify whether a plurality or a majority was required, the electors held another vote between the top two candidates – Logan and Garrard – and on this vote, Garrard received a majority. Logan protested Garrard's election to state attorney general John Breckinridge and the state senate, but both claimed they had no constitutional power to intervene.\n\nA Democratic-Republican, Garrard opposed the Alien and Sedition Acts and favored passage of the Kentucky Resolutions. He lobbied for public education, militia and prison reforms, business subsidies, and legislation favorable to the state's large debtor class. In 1798, the state's first governor's mansion was constructed, and Garrard became its first resident. Due in part to the confusion resulting from the 1795 election, he favored calling a constitutional convention in 1799. Because of his anti-slavery views, he was not chosen as a delegate to the convention. Under the resulting constitution, the governor was popularly elected and was forbidden from succeeding himself in office, although Garrard was personally exempted from this provision and was re-elected in 1799. During his second term, he applauded Thomas Jefferson's purchase of Louisiana from France as a means of dealing with the closure of the port at New Orleans to U.S. goods. Late in his term, his Secretary of State, Harry Toulmin, persuaded him to adopt some doctrines of Unitarianism, and he was expelled from the Baptist church, ending his ministry. He also clashed with the legislature over the appointment of a registrar for the state land office, leaving him embittered and unwilling to continue in politics after the conclusion of his term. He retired to his estate, Mount Lebanon, and engaged in agricultural and commercial pursuits until his death on January 19, 1822. Garrard County, Kentucky, created during his first term, was named in his honor.\n\nJames Garrard was born in Stafford County, Virginia, on January 14, 1749. He was second of three children born to Colonel William and Mary (Naughty) Garrard. Garrard's mother died sometime between 1755 and 1760; afterward, his father married Elizabeth Moss, and the couple had four more children. William Garrard was the county lieutenant of Stafford County, by virtue of which he held the rank of colonel and was in command of the county militia. The Garrard family was moderately wealthy, and the Stafford County courthouse was built on their land. During his childhood, James worked on his father's farm. He was educated in the common schools of Stafford County and studied at home, acquiring a fondness for books. Early in life, he associated himself with the Hartwood Baptist Church near Fredericksburg, Virginia.\n\nOn December 20, 1769, Garrard married his childhood sweetheart, Elizabeth Mountjoy. Shortly thereafter, his sister Mary Anne married Mountjoy's brother, Colonel John Mountjoy. Garrard and his wife had five sons and seven daughters. One son and two daughters died before reaching age two. Of the surviving four sons, all participated in the War of 1812 and all served in the Kentucky General Assembly. A number of his grandsons served in the Civil War, including Union Generals Kenner Garrard and Theophilus T. Garrard. Another grandson, James H. Garrard, was elected to five consecutive terms as state treasurer, serving from 1857 until his death in 1865.\n\nGarrard served in the Revolutionary War as a member of his father's Stafford County militia, although it is not known how much combat he participated in. While on board a schooner on the Potomac River, he was captured by British forces. His captors offered to free him in exchange for military information, but he refused the offer and later escaped.\n\nWhile serving in the militia in 1779, Garrard was elected to represent Stafford County the Virginia House of Delegates, and he assumed his seat for the 1779 legislative session. His major contribution to the session was advocating for a bill that granted religious liberty to all residents of Virginia; passage of the bill ended persecution by citizens who associated with the Church of England upon followers of other faiths and countered an effort by some to establish the Church of England as Virginia's official church. After the session, he returned to his military duties. In 1781, he was promoted to the rank of colonel.\n\nFollowing the revolution, Garrard faced the dual challenges of a growing family and depleted personal wealth. Acting on favorable reports from his former neighbor, John Edwards, Garrard and Samuel Grant headed west into the recently created Kentucky County. By virtue of his military service, Garrard was entitled to claim any vacant land he surveyed and recorded at the state land office. Beginning in early 1783, Garrard made claims for family and friends, as well as for himself. Later in 1783, he moved his family to the land he had surveyed in Fayette County, which had been created from Kentucky County since his last visit to the region. Three years later, he employed John Metcalfe, a noted stonemason and older half-brother of future Kentucky Governor Thomas Metcalfe, to build his estate, Mount Lebanon, on the Stoner Fork of the Licking River. There, he engaged in agriculture, opened a grist mill and a lumber mill, and distilled whiskey. In 1784, he enlisted in the Fayette County militia.\n\nIn 1785, Garrard was elected to represent Fayette County in the Virginia legislature. He was placed on a legislative committee with Benjamin Logan and Christopher Greenup to draft recommendations regarding the further division of Kentucky County. The committee recommended the creation of three new counties, including Madison, Mercer, and Garrard's county of residence, Bourbon. On his return from the legislature, Garrard was chosen county surveyor and justice of the peace for the newly formed county. At various times, he also served as magistrate and colonel of the county militia.\n\nAlthough some historians have identified Garrard as a member of the Danville Political Club, a secret debating society that was active in Danville, Kentucky, from 1786 to 1790, his name is not found in the club's official membership records. Garrard's biographer, H. E. Everman, concludes that these historians may have mistaken Garrard's membership in the Kentucky Society for the Promotion of Useful Knowledge for membership in the Danville Political Club. The groups had similar aims, were active at about the same time, and had several members in common. Other notable members of the Kentucky Society for the Promotion of Useful Knowledge included Isaac Shelby, Christopher Greenup, and Thomas Todd, all future Kentucky governors or gubernatorial candidates.\n\nGarrard's Mount Lebanon estate was designated as the temporary county seat of Bourbon County; the county court first convened there on May 15, 1786, and continued to meet there for many years. In 1789, the Virginia legislature established a permanent county seat named Hopewell, and Garrard was part of the committee chosen to survey the area for the city. He and John Edwards were among the new settlement's first trustees. Upon Garrard's recommendation, the city's name was changed to Paris in 1790. Soon after, he resigned as county surveyor to focus on more pressing needs of defense for the fledgling settlement. At his behest, the Bourbon County Court expanded its militia from one battalion to two at its meeting in August 1790.\n\nAs early as June 25, 1785, Garrard and his friend Augustine Eastin attended meetings of the Elkhorn Baptist Association. In 1787, he helped organize the Cooper's Run Baptist Church near his estate. He was chosen as one of the church's elders and served the congregation there for ten years. Soon after its formation, the church joined the Elkhorn Baptist Association, and in 1789, it issued Garrard a license to preach. Although he owned as many as 23 slaves to work on his vast agricultural and industrial works, Garrard condemned slavery from the pulpit, calling it a \"horrid evil\". Whites and blacks participated equally in worship at Cooper's Run.\n\nGarrard and the other elders of the church started numerous congregations in the state, including one as far away as Mason County. In 1789, Garrard and Eastin began working to reunite the more orthodox Regular Baptists in the area with the more liberal Separatist Baptists. Garrard's former church in Virginia had been a Regular Baptist congregation, and Garrard was considered a Regular Baptist despite his clear advocacy for religious toleration and his open expression of liberal views. Although he never succeeded in uniting the two factions, he was chosen moderator of the Elkhorn Baptist Association's annual meetings in 1790, 1791, and 1795 in recognition of his efforts.\n\nFrom 1785 to 1799, Garrard served as a trustee of Transylvania Seminary (now Transylvania University). In 1794, the Baptist and more liberal trustees united against the orthodox Presbyterian members of the board to elect the seminary's first non-Presbyterian president. That president was Harry Toulmin, a Unitarian minister from England. Toulmin's daughter Lucinda would later marry Garrard's son Daniel. As a result of Garrard's relationship with Toulmin, he began to accept some tenets of Unitarianism, specifically the doctrines of Socinianism. By 1802, Garrard and Augustine Eastin had not only adopted these beliefs, but had indoctrinated their Baptist congregations with them. The Elkhorn Baptist Association condemned these beliefs as heretical and encouraged Garrard and Eastin to abandon them. When that effort failed, the Association ceased correspondence and association with both men. This event ended Garrard's ministry and his association with the Baptist church.\n\nResidents of what is now Kentucky called a series of ten conventions in Danville to arrange their separation from Virginia. Garrard was a delegate to five of these conventions, held in May and August 1785 and in 1787, 1788, and 1792. At the August 1785 convention, the delegates unanimously approved a formal request for constitutional separation. As a member of the Virginia legislature, Garrard then traveled to Richmond for the legislative session and voted in favor of the act specifying the conditions under which Virginia would accept Kentucky's separation.\n\nBefore the final convention in 1792, a committee composed of Garrard, Ambrose Dudley, and Augustine Eastin reported to the Elkhorn Baptist Association in favor of forbidding slavery in the constitution then being drafted for the new state. Slavery was a major issue in the 1792 convention that finalized the document. Delegate David Rice, a Presbyterian minister, was the leading voice against the inclusion of slavery protections in the new constitution, while George Nicholas argued most strenuously in favor of them. Garrard encouraged his fellow ministers and Baptists to vote against its inclusion. The motion to delete Article 9 of the proposed document, which protected the rights of slave owners, failed by a vote of 16–26. Each of the seven Christian ministers who served as delegates to the convention (including Garrard) voted in favor of deleting the article. Five Baptist laymen defied Garrard's instructions and voted to retain Article 9; their votes provided the necessary margin for its inclusion. Historian Lowell H. Harrison wrote that the anti-slavery votes of the ministers may have accounted for the adoption of a provision that forbade ministers from serving in the Kentucky General Assembly. Garrard and the other ministers apparently expressed no dissent against this provision.\n\nAside from his opposition to slavery, Garrard did not take a particularly active role in the convention's proceedings. His most notable action not related to slavery occurred on April 13, 1792, when he reported twenty-two resolutions from the committee of the whole that provided the framework for the new constitution.\n\nFollowing the constitutional convention, it appeared that Garrard's political career was drawing to a close. He resigned all of his county offices to focus on his work in the Elkhorn Baptist Convention and his agricultural pursuits. He was pleased, however, when his son William was chosen to represent the county in the state legislature in 1793. In 1795, William Garrard was reelected, and the other four state legislators from Bourbon County were close associates of Garrard's, including John Edwards, who had recently been defeated for reelection to the U.S. Senate.\nWhen Governor Isaac Shelby announced he would not seek reelection, Garrard's friends encouraged him to become a candidate. The other announced candidates were Benjamin Logan and Thomas Todd. Logan was considered the favorite in the race due to his military heroism while helping settle the Kentucky frontier. However, his oratory was unpolished, and his parliamentary skills were weak, despite his considerable political experience. Todd, who had served as secretary of all ten Kentucky statehood conventions, had the most political experience, but his youth was considered a disadvantage by some. Garrard benefited from his political connections in Bourbon County, and many held him in high regard due to his work in the Baptist church.\n\nUnder the new constitution, each of Kentucky's legislative districts chose an elector, and these electors voted to choose the governor. Both Logan and Garrard were chosen as electors from their respective counties. On the first ballot, Logan received the votes of 21 electors, Garrard received 17, and Todd received 14. A lone elector cast his vote for John Brown, a Frankfort attorney who would soon be elected to the U.S. Senate. Some speculated that Garrard's moral character prevented him from voting for himself, but his political acumen prevented him from voting for a rival, so he voted for Brown, who had not declared his candidacy. No proof exists that this was the case, however.\n\nThe constitution did not specify whether a plurality or a majority vote was required to elect the governor, but the electors, following a common practice of other states, decided to hold a second vote between Logan and Garrard in order to achieve a majority. Most of Todd's electors supported Garrard on the second vote, giving him a majority. In a letter dated May 17, 1796, Kentucky Secretary of State James Brown certified Garrard's election, and Governor Shelby sent him a letter of congratulations on his election on May 27.\n\nAlthough he did not believe Garrard had personally done anything wrong, Logan formally protested the outcome of the election to Kentucky Attorney General John Breckinridge. Breckinridge refused to render an official decision on the matter, claiming that neither the constitution nor the laws of the state empowered him to do so. Privately, however, he expressed his opinion that Logan had been legally elected. Logan then appealed to the state senate, which was given the authority to intervene in disputed elections. In November 1796, the Senate opined that the law giving them that authority was unconstitutional because it did not promote the \"peace and welfare\" of the state. State senator Green Clay was the primary proponent of this line of reasoning. By this time, Garrard had been serving as governor for five months, and Logan abandoned the quest to unseat him.\n\nGarrard was regarded as a strong chief executive who surrounded himself with knowledgeable advisors. His friend, John Edwards, and his son, William Garrard, were both in the state senate and kept him abreast of issues there. He showed that he was willing to continue with Shelby's direction for the state by re-appointing Secretary of State James Brown, but the aging Brown retired in October 1796, only a few months into Garrard's term. Garrard then appointed Harry Toulmin, who had resigned the presidency of Transylvania Seminary in April due to opposition from the institution's more conservative trustees. Although he did not retain outgoing Attorney General John Breckinridge, who had sided with Logan in the disputed gubernatorial election, Garrard still frequently consulted with him on complex legal questions.\nDuring Governor Shelby's term, the General Assembly had passed laws requiring that the governor, auditor, treasurer, and secretary of state live in Frankfort and allocating a sum of 100 pounds to rent living quarters for the governor. Shortly after Garrard took office, the state commissioners of public buildings reported to the legislature that it would be more financially sensible to construct a house for the governor and his large family than to rent living quarters for them for the duration of his term. On December 4, 1796, the General Assembly passed legislation appropriating 1,200 pounds for the construction of such a house. The state's first governor's mansion was completed in 1798. Garrard incited considerable public interest when, in 1799, he commissioned a local craftsman to build a piano for one of his daughters; most Kentuckians had never seen such a grand instrument, and a considerable number of them flocked to the governor's mansion to see it when it was finished. Kentucky historian Thomas D. Clark also relates that Garrard's addition of carpeting to the mansion – a rare amenity at the time – drew many visitors and was described by one as \"the envy and pride of the community\".\n\nAmong the other acts passed during the first year of Garrard's term were laws establishing the Kentucky Court of Appeals and a system of lower district courts. For the first time, lawyers in the state were required to be licensed. Six new counties – including one named in Garrard's honor – were created, along with several new settlements. Garrard approved enabling acts creating twenty-six counties; no other Kentucky governor oversaw the creation of as many.\n\nLeft undone, however, was extending the laws dealing with surveying and registering land claims with the registrar of the state land office. Cognizant that the old law would expire November 30, 1797, Garrard issued a proclamation on November 3 calling the legislature into special session. The legislators convened on November 28, and Garrard, drawing on his experience as a surveyor, addressed them regarding the urgency of adopting a new law and forestalling more lawsuits related to land claims, which were already numerous. Although a wealthy landowner himself, Garrard advocated protecting Kentucky's large debtor class from foreclosure on their lands. Garrard supported pro-squatting legislation, including measures that forbade the collection of taxes from squatters on profits they made from working the land they occupied and that required landowners to pay squatters for any improvements they made on their land. Despite opposition from some aristocratic legislators like John Breckinridge, most of the reforms advocated by Garrard were approved in the session.\n\nGarrard was a member of the Democratic-Republican Party and agreed with party founder Thomas Jefferson's condemnation of the Alien and Sedition Acts. In an address to the General Assembly on November 7, 1798, he denounced the Alien Act on the grounds that it deterred desirable immigration; the Sedition Act, he claimed, denied those accused under its provisions freedom of speech and trial by jury, rights – he pointed out – that he and the other soldiers of the Revolutionary War had fought to secure. He advocated the nullification of both laws, but also encouraged the legislature to reaffirm its loyalty to the federal government and the U.S. Constitution. He was supportive of the Kentucky Resolutions of 1798 and 1799.\n\nAmong the other issues addressed in the 1798 General Assembly was the adoption of penal reforms. Garrard was supportive of the reforms – which included the abolition of the death penalty for all crimes except murder – and lobbied for the education of incarcerated individuals. He also secured the passage of laws reforming and expanding the militia. Among the reforms were the imposition of penalties upon \"distractors\" in the militia, provisions for citizens' hiring of substitutes to serve in the militia on their behalf, and the exemption of jailers, tutors, printers, judges, ministers, and legislative leaders from service. Garrard opposed lowering taxes, instead advocating increased spending on education and business subsidies. To that end, he signed legislation combining Transylvania Seminary and Kentucky Academy into a single institution.\n\nThe difficulties with Garrard's election over Benjamin Logan in 1795 added to a litany of complaints about the state's first constitution. Some believed that it was undemocratic because it required electors to choose the governor and state senators and many offices were appointive rather than elective. Others opposed life terms for judges and other state officials. Still others wanted slavery excluded from the document, or to lift the ban on ministers serving in the General Assembly. In the aftermath of the disputed 1795 election, all parties involved agreed that changes were needed. The present constitution provided no means for amendment, however. The only remedy was another constitutional convention.\n\nCalling a constitutional convention required the approval of a majority of voters in two successive elections or a two-thirds majority of both houses of the General Assembly. In February 1797, the General Assembly voted to put the question before the electorate in the upcoming May elections. Of the 9,814 votes cast, 5,446 favored the call and 440 opposed it, but 3,928 had not voted at all, and several counties recorded no votes on the issue either way. This cast doubt in the minds of many legislators regarding the true will of the people. Opponents of the convention claimed that the abstentions should be counted as votes against the call; this position had some merit, as it was well known that many Fayette County voters had abstained as a protest against the convention. When all of the irregularities were accounted for, the General Assembly determined that the vote had fallen short of the required majority.\n\nOn February 10, 1798, Garrard's son William, still serving in the state senate, introduced a bill to hold another vote on calling a constitutional convention. In May 1798, 9,188 of the 16,388 votes were in favor of calling a convention. Again, almost 5,000 of the ballots contained no vote either way. On November 21, 1798, the House of Representatives voted 36–15 in favor of a convention, and the Senate provided its requisite two-thirds majority days later. No official tally of the Senate's vote was published. The Assembly's vote rendered moot any doubts about the popular vote.\n\nDelegates to the July 22, 1799, convention were elected in May 1799. Neither Garrard nor his son William were chosen as delegates, mostly due to their anti-slavery views. Garrard had been a more active governor than his predecessor, frequently employing his veto and clashing with the county courts. As a result, the delegates moved to reign in some of the power given to the state's chief executive. Under the 1799 constitution, the governor was popularly elected, and the threshold for overriding a gubernatorial veto was lowered from a two-thirds majority of each house of the legislature to an absolute majority. Although the governor retained broad appointment powers, the state senate was given the power to approve or reject all gubernatorial nominees. New term limits were imposed on the governor, making him ineligible for reelection for seven years following the expiration of his term. The restriction on ministers serving in the legislature was retained and extended to the governor's office. Historian Lowell Harrison held that this restriction was \"a clear snub to Garrard\", but Garrard biographer H. E. Everman maintained that it was \"definitely not a blow aimed at Garrard\". Garrard was personally exempted from both the succession and ministerial restrictions, clearing the way for him to seek a second term.\n\nConfident that the results of the 1795 election would be reversed, Benjamin Logan was the first to declare his candidacy for the governorship in 1799. Garrard and Thomas Todd declared their respective candidacies soon after. Former U.S. Representative Christopher Greenup also sought the office. Many of the recent settlers in Kentucky were unaware of his illustrious military record and unimpressed with his unsophisticated speaking skills. Although the candidates themselves rarely spoke negatively of each other, opponents of each candidate independently raised issues that they felt would hurt that candidate. John Breckinridge, Garrard's long-time political nemesis, tried to goad Garrard into making another impassioned plea for emancipation of slaves, which was a minority position in the state, but Garrard recognized Breckinridge's tactics and refused to express any bold emancipationist sentiments during the campaign. The fact that the slavery protections in the new constitution were even stronger than those in the previous document ensured that the incumbent's previous anti-slavery sentiments were not a major concern to most of the electorate. The family of Henry Field, a prominent leader in Frankfort, attacked Garrard for not issuing a pardon for Field, who was convicted of murdering his wife with an ax. After examining the evidence in the case, Garrard concluded that the verdict was reached justly and without undue outside influence, but the charge was raised so late in the campaign that Garrard's defense of his refusal to issue a pardon could not be circulated widely.\n\nWith the advantages of incumbency and a generally popular record, Garrard garnered large majorities in the state's western counties, Jefferson County, and the Bluegrass region of central Kentucky. Surprisingly, he even found support among some voters who had favored Logan four years earlier. The final voting showed Garrard the winner with 8,390 votes, followed by Greenup with 6,746, Logan with 3,996, and Todd with 2,166. Due to the term limits imposed by the new constitution, Garrard was the last Kentucky governor elected to succeed himself until a 1992 amendment to the state constitution loosened the prohibition on gubernatorial succession, and Paul E. Patton was reelected in 1999. In 1801, Garrard nominated Todd to fill the next vacancy on the Kentucky Court of Appeals after the election. Similarly, he appointed Greenup to a position on the Frankfort Circuit Court in 1802.\n\nThe first two years of Garrard's second term were relatively uneventful, but in the 1802 General Assembly, legislators approved two bills related to the circuit court system that Garrard vetoed. The first bill expanded the number of courts and provided that untrained citizens could sit as judges in the court system. Garrard questioned the cost of the additional courts and the wisdom of allowing untrained judges on the bench; he also objected to the bill's circumvention of the governor's authority to appoint judges. The second bill allowed attorneys and judges in the circuit court system to reside outside the districts they served. The General Assembly overrode Garrard's second veto, marking the first time in Kentucky history that a gubernatorial veto was overridden and the only time during Garrard's eight-year tenure.\nOn October 16, 1802, Spanish intendent Don Juan Ventura Morales announced the revocation of the U.S. right of deposit at New Orleans, a right that had been guaranteed under Pinckney's Treaty. The closure of the port to U.S. goods represented a major impediment to Garrard's hopes of establishing a vibrant trade between Kentucky and the other states and territories along the Mississippi River. He urged President Thomas Jefferson to act and publicly declared that Kentucky had 26,000 militiamen ready to take New Orleans by force if necessary. Jefferson was unaware, however, that the secret Treaty of San Ildefonso had ceded control of Louisiana to the French dictator Napoleon Bonaparte in 1800, although a formal transfer had not yet been made. As Jefferson deliberated, Napoleon unexpectedly offered to sell Louisiana to the United States for approximately $15 million. Robert R. Livingston and James Monroe, Jefferson's envoys in France, accepted the offer. The purchase delighted most Kentuckians, and Garrard hailed it as a \"noble achievement\". Soon after the agreement, the Spanish government claimed that the French had not performed their part of the Treaty of Ildefonso and, as a result, the treaty was nullified and Louisiana still belonged to Spain. Jefferson ignored the Spanish protest and prepared to take Louisiana by force. He instructed Garrard to have 4,000 militiamen ready to march to New Orleans by December 20, 1803. The Kentucky General Assembly quickly passed a measure guaranteeing 150 acres of land to anyone who volunteered for military service, and Garrard was soon able to inform Jefferson that his quota was met. Spain then reversed course, relinquishing its claims to Louisiana, and the territory passed into U.S. control two months later.\n\nThe last months of Garrard's second term were marred by a dispute with the General Assembly over naming a new registrar of the state's land office. Garrard first named Secretary of State Harry Toulmin, but the Senate rejected that nomination on December 7, 1803. Next, Garrard nominated former rival Christopher Greenup, but Greenup had designs on succeeding Garrard and asked Garrard to withdraw the nomination, which he did. The Senate then rejected Garrard's next nominee, John Coburn, and accused the next, Thomas Jones, of \"high criminal offense\" and barred him from any further appointive office.\n\nFollowing Jones' rejection, Garrard vetoed a bill that would have allowed the legislature to select the state's presidential and vice-presidential electors; despite the fact that the law ran contrary to the state constitution, Garrard's veto further strained his relations with the Senate. After the Senate rejected nominee William Trigg, the state's newspapers openly talked of an executive-legislative feud and claimed the Senate had its own favorite candidate for the position and would not accept anyone else. When the Senate rejected Willis Green in January 1804, Garrard declared that he would make no more nominations for the position. Accusations of bad faith were exchanged between the governor and the Senate, after which Garrard nominated John Adair, the popular Speaker of the House. The Senate finally confirmed this choice.\n\nHis dispute with the General Assembly over the naming of a land registrar left Garrard embittered, and he retired from politics at the expiration of his second term. He privately backed Christopher Greenup's bid to succeed him in 1804, and Bourbon County's vote broke heavily for Greenup in the election. Although his sons William and James would continue running for public office into the 1830s, Garrard never indicated a desire to run again.\n\nGarrard returned to Mount Lebanon, where he developed a reputation as a notable agriculturist. His son James oversaw the day-to-day operation of the farm and frequently won prizes for his innovations at local agricultural fairs. The Mount Lebanon estate was badly damaged by one of the New Madrid earthquakes in 1811, but Garrard insisted on repairing the damage as thoroughly as possible in order to reside there for the rest of his life. He imported fine livestock – including thoroughbred horses and cattle – to his farm and invested in several commercial enterprises, including several saltworks, which passed to his sons upon his death. He died on January 19, 1822, following several years of feeble health. He was buried on the grounds of his Mount Lebanon estate, and the state of Kentucky erected a monument over his grave site.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2168842", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2168842", "title": "Metaphysical painting", "text": "Metaphysical painting\n\nMetaphysical painting () or metaphysical art was a style of painting developed by the Italian artists Giorgio de Chirico and Carlo Carrà. The movement began in 1910 with de Chirico, whose dreamlike works with sharp contrasts of light and shadow often had a vaguely threatening, mysterious quality, \"painting that which cannot be seen\". De Chirico, his younger brother Alberto Savinio, and Carrà formally established the school and its principles in 1917.\n\nGiorgio de Chirico, unlike many artists of his generation, found little to admire in the works of Cézanne and other French modernists, but was inspired by the paintings of the Swiss Symbolist Arnold Böcklin and the work of German artists such as Max Klinger. His painting \"The Enigma of an Autumn Afternoon\" (c. 1910) is considered his first Metaphysical work; it was inspired by what de Chirico called a \"revelation\" that he experienced in Piazza Santa Croce in Florence. In subsequent works he developed a disquieting imagery of deserted squares, often bordered by steeply receding arcades shown in a raking light. Tiny figures in the distance cast long shadows, or in place of figures there are featureless dressmakers' mannequins. The effect was to produce a sense of dislocation in time and space.\n\nIn 1913, Guillaume Apollinaire made the first use of the term \"metaphysical\" to describe de Chirico's paintings.\nIn February 1917, the Futurist painter Carlo Carrà met de Chirico in Ferrara, where they were both stationed during World War I. Carrà developed a variant of the Metaphysical style in which the dynamism of his earlier work was replaced by immobility, and the two artists worked together for several months in 1917 at a military hospital in Ferrara. According to art historian Jennifer Mundy, \"Carrà adopted de Chirico's imagery of mannequins set in claustrophobic spaces, but his works lacked de Chirico's sense of irony and enigma, and he always retained a correct perspective\". After an exhibition of Carrà's work in Milan in December 1917, critics began to write of Carrà as the inventor of Metaphysical painting, to de Chirico's chagrin. Carrà did little to dispel this idea in \"Pittura Metafisica\", a book he published in 1919, and the relationship between the two artists ended. By 1919, both artists had largely abandoned the style in favor of Neoclassicism.\nOther painters who adopted the style included Giorgio Morandi around 1917–1920, Filippo de Pisis, and Mario Sironi. In the 1920s and later, the legacy of Metaphysical painting influenced the work of Felice Casorati, Max Ernst, and others. Exhibitions of Metaphysical art in Germany in 1921 and 1924 inspired the use of mannequin imagery in works by George Grosz and Oskar Schlemmer. Many paintings by René Magritte, Salvador Dalí, and other Surrealists make use of formal and thematic elements derived from Metaphysical painting.\n\nBetween the two World Wars in Italy there were numerous architectural vulgarisations of the metaphysical poetics of the \"Piazze d'Italia\", whose timeless atmosphere seemed to be congenial to the propaganda needs of the time. Squares of metaphysical flavor were built in the historical centers, as in Brescia or Varese, or in newly founded cities, such as those of the Agro Pontino (Sabaudia, Aprilia), to culminate in the spectacular unfinished E42 in Rome.\n\n"}
{"id": "2168853", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2168853", "title": "Charles Scott (governor)", "text": "Charles Scott (governor)\n\nCharles Scott (April 1739October 22, 1813) was an 18th-century American soldier who was elected the fourth Governor of Kentucky in 1808. Orphaned in his teens, Scott enlisted in the Virginia Regiment in October 1755 and served as a scout and escort during the French and Indian War. He quickly rose through the ranks to become a captain. After the war, he married and engaged in agricultural pursuits on land left to him by his father, but he returned to active military service in 1775 as the American Revolution began to grow in intensity. In August 1776, he was promoted to colonel and given command of the 5th Virginia Regiment. The 5th Virginia joined George Washington in New Jersey later that year, serving with him for the duration of the Philadelphia campaign. Scott commanded Washington's light infantry, and by late 1778 was also serving as his chief of intelligence. Furloughed at the end of the Philadelphia campaign, Scott returned to active service in March 1779 and was ordered to South Carolina to assist General Benjamin Lincoln in the southern theater. He arrived in Charleston, South Carolina, just as Henry Clinton had begun his siege of the city. Scott was taken as a prisoner of war when Charleston surrendered. Paroled in March 1781 and exchanged for Lord Rawdon in July 1782, Scott managed to complete a few recruiting assignments before the war ended.\n\nAfter the war, Scott visited the western frontier in 1785 and began to make preparations for a permanent relocation. He resettled near present-day Versailles, Kentucky, in 1787. Confronted by the dangers of Indian raids, Scott raised a company of volunteers in 1790 and joined Josiah Harmar for an expedition against the Indians. After Harmar's Defeat, President Washington ordered Arthur St. Clair to prepare for an invasion of Indian lands in the Northwest Territory. In the meantime, Scott, by now holding the rank of brigadier general in the Virginia militia, was ordered to conduct a series of preliminary raids. In July 1791, he led the most notable and successful of these raids against the village of Ouiatenon. St. Clair's main invasion, conducted later that year, was a failure. Shortly after the separation of Kentucky from Virginia in 1792, the Kentucky General Assembly commissioned Scott as a major general and gave him command of the 2nd Division of the Kentucky militia. Scott's division cooperated with \"Mad\" Anthony Wayne's Legion of the United States for the rest of the Northwest Indian War, including their decisive victory at the Battle of Fallen Timbers.\n\nHaving previously served in the Virginia House of Delegates and as a presidential elector, the aging Scott now ran for governor. His 1808 campaign was skillfully managed by his step-son-in-law, Jesse Bledsoe, and he won a convincing victory over John Allen and Green Clay. A fall on the icy steps of the governor's mansion early in his term confined Scott to crutches for the rest of his life, and left him heavily reliant on Bledsoe, whom he appointed Secretary of State. Although he frequently clashed with the state legislature over domestic matters, the primary concern of his administration was the increasing tension between the United States and Great Britain that eventually led to the War of 1812. Scott's decision to appoint William Henry Harrison as brevet major general in the Kentucky militia, although probably in violation of the state constitution as Harrison was not a resident of the state, was nonetheless praised by the state's citizens. After his term expired, Scott returned to his Canewood estate. His health declined rapidly, and he died on October 22, 1813. Scott County, Kentucky, and Scott County, Indiana, are named in his honor, as are the cities of Scottsville, Kentucky, and Scottsville, Virginia.\n\nCharles Scott was born in 1739, probably in April, in the part of Goochland County, Virginia, that is now Powhatan County. His father, Samuel Scott, was a farmer and member of the Virginia House of Burgesses. His mother, whose name is not known, died most likely around 1745. Scott had an older brother, John, and three younger siblings, Edward, Joseph, and Martha. He received only a basic education from his parents and in the rural Virginia schools near his home.\n\nShortly after his father died in 1755, Scott was apprenticed to a carpenter. In late July 1755, a local court was preparing to place him with a guardian, but in October, before the court acted, Scott enlisted in the Virginia Regiment. He was assigned to David Bell's company. During the early part of the French and Indian War, he won praise from his superiors as a frontier scout and woodsman. Most of his fellow soldiers were undisciplined and poorly trained, allowing Scott to stand out and quickly rise to the rank of corporal. By June 1756, he had been promoted to sergeant.\n\nScott served under George Washington in the Braddock Expedition, a failed attempt to capture Fort Duquesne from the French. For most of 1756 and the early part of 1757, he divided his time between Fort Cumberland and Fort Washington, conducting scouting and escort missions. In April 1757, David Bell was relieved of his command as part of a general downsizing of Washington's regiment, and Scott was assigned to Captain Robert McKenzie at Fort Pearsall. In August and September, Washington sent Scott and a small scouting party on two reconnaissance missions to Fort Duquesne in preparation for an assault on that fort, but the party learned little on either mission. In November, Scott was part of the Forbes Expedition that captured the fort. He spent the latter part of the year at Fort Loudoun, where Washington promoted him to ensign.\n\nScott spent most of 1759 conducting escort missions and constructing roads and forts. During this time, Virginia's forces were taken from George Washington and put under the control of Colonel William Byrd. In July 1760, Scott was named the fifth captain of a group of Virginia troops that Byrd led on an expedition against the Cherokee in 1760. Scott's exact role in the campaign is not known. The expedition was a success, and Virginia Governor Francis Fauquier ordered the force disbanded in February 1762; Scott had left the army at some unknown date prior to that.\n\nSometime prior to 1762, Scott's older brother, John, died, leaving Scott to inherit his father's land near the James River and Muddy Creek. Having left the army, he had settled on his inherited farm by late 1761. On February 25, 1762, he married Frances Sweeney from Cumberland County, Virginia. With the help of approximately 10 slaves, Scott engaged in growing tobacco and milling flour on his farm. In July 1766, he was named one of two captains in the local militia. Over the next several years, Scott and his wife had four boys and four or five girls.\n\nAs the American Revolution intensified in 1775, Scott raised a company of volunteers in Cumberland County. It was the first company formed south of the James River to participate in the Revolution. The company stood ready to aid Patrick Henry in an anticipated clash with Lord Dunmore at Williamsburg, Virginia, in May 1775, but Dunmore abandoned the city in June, and they joined units from the surrounding counties in Williamsburg later that month. In July, the Virginia Convention created two regiments of Virginia troops, one under Patrick Henry and the other under William Woodford. As those leaders departed for Williamsburg, the Conventions acknowledged Scott as temporary commander-in-chief of the volunteers already assembled there. On August 17, 1775, he was elected lieutenant colonel of Woodford's regiment, the 2nd Virginia. His younger brother, Joseph, served as a lieutenant in the regiment. In December, Woodford dispatched Scott and 150 men to Great Bridge, Virginia, to defend a crossing point on the Elizabeth River. Days later, this force played a significant role in the December 9, 1775, Battle of Great Bridge by killing British Captain Charles Fordyce, thereby halting the British advance on the crossing. Following the battle, colonial forces were able to occupy the city of Norfolk, Virginia, and Lord Dunmore eventually departed from Virginia.\n\nOn February 13, 1776, the 2nd Virginia became a part of the Continental Army; Scott retained his rank of lieutenant colonel during the transition. After spending the winter with part of the 2nd Virginia in Suffolk, Scott was chosen by the Second Continental Congress as colonel of the 5th Virginia Regiment on August 12, 1776; he replaced Colonel William Peachy, who had resigned. The 5th Virginia was stationed in the cities of Hampton and Portsmouth through the end of September. They were then ordered to join George Washington in New Jersey, eventually repairing to the city of Trenton in November.\n\nServing as part of Adam Stephen's brigade, Scott's 5th Virginia Regiment fought in the colonial victory at the December 26 Battle of Trenton. During the subsequent Battle of the Assunpink Creek on January 2, 1777, the 5th Virginia helped slow the advance of a combined force of British light infantry and Hessian mercenaries toward Trenton. Major George Johnston, a member of the 5th Virginia, opined that Scott had \"acquired immortal honor\" from his performance at Assunpink Creek. Following these battles, Washington's main force prepared to spend the winter at Morristown, New Jersey, while Scott's regiment was based at nearby Chatham. From this base, he led light infantry raids against British foraging parties. In his most notable engagement – the February 1 Battle of Drake's Farm – he defeated a superior combination of British and Hessian soldiers. He led another notable raid against a large British force of about 2,000 at the February 8 Battle of Quibbletown.\nIn March 1777, Scott returned to his Virginia farm, taking his first furlough in more than a year. In recognition of his service with Washington, Congress commissioned him a brigadier general on April 2, 1777. At Washington's request, he returned to Trenton on May 10, 1777. His 4th Virginia Brigade and another brigade under William Woodford constituted the Virginia division, commanded by Adam Stephen, who had been promoted to major general. With Stephen and Brigadier General William Maxwell ill, Scott assumed temporary command of the division between May 19 and 24. Washington spent much of mid-1777 trying to anticipate and counter the moves of British General William Howe, and the lull in the fighting allowed Scott time to file a protest with Congress regarding how his seniority and rank had been calculated. After eight months of deliberation, Congress concurred with Scott's protest, placing him ahead of fellow brigadier general George Weedon in seniority.\n\nAt the September 11 Battle of Brandywine, the 4th Virginia Brigade stubbornly resisted the advance of General Charles Cornwallis, but was ultimately forced to retreat. Following the British victory, Howe marched toward Philadelphia, stopping briefly at Germantown. Scott persistently advocated for an attack on Howe's position at Germantown, and although he was initially in the minority among Washington's generals, he ultimately prevailed upon Washington to conduct the attack. On October 4, 1777, the 4th Virginia attacked the British in the Battle of Germantown. Because of their circuitous route to the battle, the field was already covered by heavy smoke from muskets and a fire set by the British in a dry buckwheat field when they arrived; they and the other colonial forces were lost in the smoke and retreated.\n\nAfter the defeat at Germantown, Washington's troops took a position in the hills surrounding Whitemarsh, Pennsylvania, about from Philadelphia. Scott and four other generals initially favored an attack on Philadelphia in December, but after hearing Washington's assessment of the enemy's defenses there, they abandoned the idea. After a series of skirmishes with Howe's men near Whitemarsh, Washington's army camped for the winter at Valley Forge. Scott was afforded the luxury of boarding at the farm of Samuel Jones, about three miles from the camp, but rode out to inspect his brigade daily. Washington granted him a furlough in mid-March 1778, and he returned to Valley Forge on May 20, 1778.\n\nWhen Washington and his men abandoned Valley Forge in mid-June 1778, Scott was ordered to take 1,500 light infantrymen and harass the British forces as they marched across New Jersey. On June 26, the Marquis de Lafayette joined Scott with an additional 1,000 men, in anticipation of a major offensive the next day. General Charles Lee was chosen to command the operation, which was delayed by one day due to inadequate communications and delays in forwarding provisions. Lee shared no battle plan with his generals, later claiming he had insufficient intelligence to form one. On the morning of June 28, Lee launched the attack, beginning the Battle of Monmouth. During the battle, Scott observed American artillerymen retreating. Not realizing that the men had only run out of ammunition, Scott believed the retreat was a sign of the collapse of the American offensive and ordered his men to retreat as well. Lacking a battle plan for guidance, William Maxwell and Anthony Wayne, whose units were fighting adjacent to Scott's men, also ordered a retreat. With such a great number of his men retreating, Lee fell back and eventually aborted the offensive. Although Washington's main force arrived and stopped the British advance, Scott's retreat was partially blamed for giving them control of the battle. Tradition holds that, in the aftermath of the battle, Scott witnessed Washington excoriating Lee in a profanity-laden tirade, but biographer Harry M. Ward considered it unlikely that Scott was present at the meeting. Lee was later court-martialed for the retreat and suspended from command.\n\nFollowing the Battle of Monmouth, the British retreated to New York City. On August 14, Scott was given command of a new light infantry corps organized by Washington. He also served as Washington's chief of intelligence, conducting constant scouting missions from the Americans' new base at White Plains, New York. While Scott's men engaged in a few skirmishes with British scouting parties, neither Washington's army nor the British force at New York City conducted any major operations before Scott was furloughed in November 1778.\n\nA March 1779 letter from Washington to Scott, still on furlough in Virginia, ordered him to recruit volunteers in Virginia and join Washington at Middlebrook on May 1. Men and supplies proved difficult to obtain, delaying Scott's return; during the delay, Washington ordered the recruits to South Carolina to join Benjamin Lincoln, who was in command of the militia forces there. Reports of significant British troop movements toward Georgia had convinced Washington that the enemy was preparing an invasion from the south.\nSoon after Washington's orders were delivered, a British raiding party under George Collier and Edward Mathew arrived in Virginia to capture or destroy supplies that might otherwise be sent southward to aid the reinforcements going to South Carolina. Scott's orders changed again; the Virginia House of Delegates ordered him to immediately prepare defenses against Collier and Mathew's raids. When it became clear to both the legislature and Washington that Collier and Mathew intended only to raid supplies, not to invade, they concluded that the local militia would be able to sufficiently protect Virginia's interests and that Scott should continue to recruit men to reinforce the south. The legislators presented him with a horse, a firearm, and 500 pounds sterling for his quick response to the threat.\n\nScott's recruiting difficulties in Virginia continued, despite the implementation of a draft by the state legislature. Finally, in October 1779, he forwarded troops sent to him from Washington's Northern Army on to Lincoln in South Carolina, fulfilling his quota. He retained only Abraham Buford's regiment with him in Virginia. In February 1780, about 750 men sent by Washington under William Woodford arrived at Scott's camp in Petersburg, Virginia. Virginia authorities, fearing that the British force to the south under General Henry Clinton would turn north to Virginia, detained Scott and Woodford until it was clear that Clinton's object was Lincoln's position at Charleston, South Carolina.\n\nOn March 30, 1780, Scott arrived in Charleston just as Clinton was laying siege to the city. He was captured when the city surrendered on May 12, 1780, and was held as a prisoner of war at Haddrell's Point near Charleston. Although he was a prisoner, he was given freedom to move within a six-mile radius and was allowed to correspond and trade with acquaintances in Virginia. With the death of William Woodford on November 13, 1780, he became primarily responsible for the welfare of the Virginia troops at Haddrell's Point. He requested his parole on account of ill health on January 30, 1781, and in late March, Charles Cornwallis granted the request.\n\nIn July 1782, Scott was exchanged for Lord Rawdon, ending his parole. Washington informed him that he was back on active duty and ordered him to assist General Peter Muhlenberg's recruiting efforts in Virginia, then to report to General Nathanael Greene. Greene wrote that he did not have a command for Scott, and requested that he remain with Muhlenberg in Virginia. The few troops he was able to recruit were sent to a depot at Winchester, Virginia. When the preliminary articles of peace between the United States and Great Britain were signed in March 1783, recruiting stopped altogether. Scott was brevetted to major general on September 30, 1783, just prior to his discharge from the Continental Army. Following the war, he became one of the founding members of the Society of the Cincinnati.\n\nIn October 1783, the Virginia Legislature authorized Scott to commission superintendents and surveyors to survey the lands given to soldiers for their service in the Revolutionary War. Enticed by glowing reports of Kentucky by his friend, James Wilkinson, he arranged for a cabin to be built for him near the Kentucky River, although the builder apparently laid only the cornerstone. Scott first visited Kentucky in mid-1785. Traveling with Peyton Short, one of Wilkinson's business partners, he came to Limestone (present-day Maysville, Kentucky) via the Monongahela and Ohio Rivers. Scott and Short then traveled overland to the Kentucky River to examine the land they would later claim. Scott's stay in Kentucky was a short one; he had returned to his farm in Virginia by September 1785.\n\nOn his return to Virginia, Scott employed Edward Carrington, former quartermaster general of the Southern Army, to set his financial affairs in order in preparation for a move to Kentucky. Carrington purchased Scott's Virginia farm in 1785, but allowed the family to live there until they moved to the frontier. In 1787, Scott settled near the city of Versailles, Kentucky. Between his military claims and those of his children, the Scott family was entitled to in Fayette and Bourbon counties. Scott constructed a two-story log cabin, a stockade, and a tobacco inspection warehouse. In June 1787, Shawnee warriors killed and scalped his son, Samuel, while he was crossing the Ohio River in a canoe; the elder Scott watched helplessly from the riverbank. Although a small party of settlers pursued the Shawnees back across the river, they were not able to overtake them. In volume three of Theodore Roosevelt's \"The Winning of the West\", he stated that Scott \"delighted in war\" against the Indians after the death of his son.\n\nScott focused on the development of his homestead as a way to deal with the grief of losing his son. The settlement became known as Scott's Landing, and Scott briefly served as a tobacco inspector for the area. Determined to make Scott's Landing the centerpiece of a larger settlement called Petersburg, he began selling lots near the settlement in November 1788. Among those who purchased lots were James Wilkinson, Abraham Buford, Judge George Muter, and future Congressman and Kentucky Governor Christopher Greenup.\n\nScott was one of 37 men who founded the Kentucky Society for the Promotion of Useful Knowledge in 1787. Although he did not participate in any of the ten statehood conventions that sought to separate Kentucky from Virginia, he supported the idea in principle. When Woodford County was formed from the part of Fayette County that included Scott's fledgling settlement, Scott declined appointment as the new county's lieutenant. He consented to be a candidate to represent the county in the Virginia House of Delegates. During his single term, he served on the committee on privileges and election and on several special committees, including one that recommended that President George Washington supply a military guard at Big Bone Lick to facilitate the establishment of a saltworks there.\n\nAs tensions mounted between the Indians in the Northwest Territory and settlers on the Kentucky frontier, President Washington began sanctioning joint operations between federal army troops and local frontier militia against the Indians. In April 1790, Scott raised a contingent of volunteers from Bourbon and Fayette counties to join Josiah Harmar in a raid against the Western Confederacy along the Scioto River in what would become the U.S. state of Ohio. The combined force of regulars and militia departed from Limestone on April 18, 1790, crossing the Ohio River and marching to the upper Scioto. From there, they headed south, toward the present-day city of Portsmouth, Ohio, and discovered an abandoned Indian camp. Fresh footprints, including those of a well-known Shawnee warrior – nicknamed Reel Foot because of his two club feet – led away from the camp site. Scott sent a small detachment to follow the tracks; ultimately, they discovered and killed four Shawnee, including Reel Foot. Other than this, the expedition accomplished nothing, and it disbanded on August 27, 1790.\n\nIn June 1790, Harmar and Arthur St. Clair were ordered to lead another expedition against the Indians. Harmar had hoped that Scott, Isaac Shelby, or Benjamin Logan would join the campaign and lead the Kentucky militia, but all three declined. Scott had been elected to represent Woodford County in the Virginia General Assembly, and his legislative duty prevented his service. He believed that the Kentucky militiamen would only serve under Colonel Robert Trotter, a veteran of Logan's earlier Indian fighting campaigns. Ultimately, command of the Kentucky militiamen was given to Major John Hardin, and many militiamen refused to join the campaign, just as Scott had predicted. During the expedition, Scott's son, Merritt, who was serving as a captain in the Woodford County militia, was killed and scalped. The entire expedition was a failure, and it solidified the Kentucky militiamen's strong distrust of Harmar; most vowed never to fight alongside him again.\n\nDuring Harmar's Campaign, Scott was serving in the state legislature in Richmond, Virginia. He was once again appointed to the committee on privileges and election. He also served on the committee on propositions and grievances and several special committees. On December 30, 1790, Virginia Governor Beverley Randolph, possibly acting on a recommendation from Washington, appointed Scott brigadier general in the Virginia militia and gave him command of the entire District of Kentucky. His primary responsibility was overseeing a line of 18 outposts along the Ohio River. In January 1791, President Washington accepted U.S. Senator John Brown's suggestion to appoint a Kentucky Board of War, composed of Brown, Scott, Isaac Shelby, Harry Innes, and Benjamin Logan. The committee was empowered to call out local militia to act in conjunction with federal troops against the Indians. They recommended assembling an army of volunteers to locate and destroy Indian settlements north of the Ohio River. Later that month, Washington approved a plan to invade the Indians' homelands via a raid from Fort Washington (near present-day Cincinnati, Ohio). Most Kentuckians were displeased with Washington's choice of Arthur St. Clair, by then suffering from gout and unable to mount his own horse unassisted, as overall commander of the invasion. Scott was chosen to serve under St. Clair as commander of the 1,000 militiamen who took part in the invasion, about one-third of the total force.\n\nWashington ordered Scott to conduct a series of preliminary raids in mid-1791 that would keep the enemy occupied while St. Clair assembled the primary invasion force. Both Isaac Shelby and Benjamin Logan had hoped to lead the campaign, and neither would accept a lesser position. Shelby nevertheless supported the campaign, while Logan actively opposed it. Scott issued a call for volunteers to assemble at Frankfort, Kentucky, on May 15, 1791, to carry out these raids. Kentuckians responded favorably to the idea of an all-militia campaign, and 852 men volunteered for service, although Scott was only authorized to take 750; Senator John Brown was among the volunteers. After a brief delay to learn the fate of a failed diplomatic mission to the Miami tribes in the Northwest Territory, Scott's men departed from Fort Washington on May 24. The militiamen crossed the Ohio toward a clutch of Miami, Kickapoo, Wea, and Potawatomi settlements near the location of present-day Lafayette, Indiana. For eight days, they crossed rugged terrain and were bedraggled by frequent rainstorms. The harsh conditions spoiled the militia's supplies, and they resorted to gathering the blackberries that were growing in the area; for this reason, the expedition earned the nickname the \"Blackberry Campaign\".\n\nAs Scott's men reached an open prairie near the Wea settlement of Ouiatenon on June 1, they were discovered by an enemy scout and hurried to attack the villages before the residents could react. When the main force reached the villages, they found the residents hurriedly fleeing across the Wabash River in canoes. Aided by cover fire from a Kickapoo village on the other side of the river, they were able to escape before Scott's men could attack. The river was too wide to ford at Scott's location, so he sent a detachment under James Wilkinson in one direction and a detachment under Thomas Barbee in the other to find a place to ford the river. Wilkinson did not find a suitable location, but located and killed a small band of Indians before returning. Barbee located a crossing and conducted a brief raid against the Indians on the other side before returning to Scott. The next morning, Scott's main force burned the nearby villages and crops, while a detachment under Wilkinson set out for the settlement of Kethtippecannunk. The inhabitants of this village had fled across Eel Creek, and after a brief and ineffective firefight, Wilkinson's men burned the city and returned to Scott. In his official report, Scott noted that many of Kethtippecannunk's residents were French and speculated that it was connected to, perhaps dependent upon, the French settlement of Detroit.\n\nLow on supplies, Scott and his men ended their campaign. On the return trip, two men drowned in the White River; these were the only deaths among Scott's men. Five others were wounded but survived. In total, they had killed 38 Indians and taken 57 more prisoner. Scott sent 12 men ahead with the official report for Arthur St. Clair's review; the rest of the men arrived at Fort Steuben (present-day Clarksville, Indiana) on June 15. The next day, they recrossed the Ohio River and received their discharge papers at Louisville, Kentucky.\n\nScott's Wabash Campaign was well-received both in Kentucky and by the Washington administration. On June 24, 1791, Arthur St. Clair encouraged the Board of War to organize a second expedition into the Wabash region and to remove their outposts along the Ohio River to free up manpower and finances as a prelude to his larger invasion. Scott questioned the wisdom of removing the outposts and convinced his fellow members of the Board of War to retain one at Big Bone Lick and one guarding an ironworks at the mouth of the Kentucky River. His instincts later proved to be right; a month later, Indian raiders tried to deny the frontier settlers access to salt by capturing Big Bone Lick, but they were repelled by the militia stationed at the outpost there. Scott also did not believe that 500 men, St. Clair's requested number for the second Wabash expedition, was sufficient for an effective operation.\nIn July, Scott gave permission to Bourbon County resident John Edwards to lead 300 men against a band of Indians suspected of stealing horses on the Kentucky side of the Ohio River. Although Edwards' expedition almost reached the Sandusky River, they found only deserted villages. Unknown to the volunteers, they narrowly missed being ambushed by the Indians in the area. Many of the men who accompanied Edwards accused him of cowardice. Due to illness, Scott was unable to lead the expedition St. Clair requested; instead, he chose his friend, James Wilkinson, to lead it. Wilkinson's men departed on August 1. During their expedition, they destroyed the evacuated village of Kikiah (also called Kenapocomoco), the rebuilt settlement of Ouiatenon, a small Kickapoo village, and several other small settlements in the area. Returning by the same route that Scott's previous expedition had, Wilkinson's men were back in Kentucky by August 21. Scott's and Wilkinson's campaigns took a heavy toll on the Northwest Indians. In particular, the and Kickapoos signed a peace treaty with the United States the following year, and the Kickapoos migrated farther into Illinois and Missouri.\n\nSt. Clair continued his preparations for invading the northwest despite the fact that, by now, he admitted he was unfit for combat due to his ill health. Like Harmar, he was also unpopular in Kentucky, and Scott had to conduct a draft to raise the militiamen needed for St. Clair's expedition. He and most other officers in Kentucky claimed they were too ill to lead the men; most actually feared losing the respect of Kentuckians through their association with St. Clair. Colonel William Oldham was the highest-ranking soldier willing to lead the Kentuckians.\n\nSt. Clair's party left Fort Washington on October 1. On November 3, he ordered his men to make camp on a small tributary of the Wabash River, mistakenly believing they were camping on the St. Marys River. His intent was for the men to construct some protective works the next day, but before sunrise, a combined group of Miami and Canadians attacked the party, routing them and capturing part of their artillery and most of their supplies. Of St. Clair's force of 1,400 men, 600 were killed and 300 captured during the attack. The Kentucky militiamen scattered during the attack, and their leader, Colonel Oldham, was killed. Nevertheless, they and most citizens in Kentucky blamed St. Clair for the entire debacle. St. Clair retreated to Fort Washington, and on November 24, Scott joined him there with 200 mounted volunteers in case the Indians decided to pursue him and invade Kentucky. When it became apparent that no Indian invasion was imminent, Scott's men returned home. As a result of St. Clair's campaign, tribes that had previously been neutral in the conflict – including the Delawares and Wyandots – allied with the Miami and Shawnee against the frontiersmen.\n\nAfter St. Clair's Defeat, President Washington asked Congress to authorize the formation of the Legion of the United States, a 5,000-man force to fight the Indians in the Northwest. Congress approved the proposal in March 1792, and Scott learned from a friend in Philadelphia that he was being considered as commander of the Legion. Ultimately Washington concluded that he was \"of inadequate abilities\"; his known vice of drinking too much alcohol also concerned Washington. Instead, Washington chose \"Mad\" Anthony Wayne to command the Legion. On June 4, 1792 – just days after Kentucky officially gained statehood – the Kentucky General Assembly commissioned Scott and Benjamin Logan as major generals in the state militia. On June 25, Scott was given command of the militia's 2nd Division, which was charged with operating north of the Kentucky River; Logan's 1st Division operated south of the river.\n\nThe new state legislature had also appointed a five-man committee to select a city to be the new state capital. Scott applied to have Petersburg, still a fledgling settlement, designated as the capital. Other localities – including Frankfort, Lexington, Louisville, and Boonesborough – also applied. Frankfort was eventually chosen, as Scott's failure to secure Petersburg's designation as the state capital contributed more than anything else to the settlement's failure to even become a viable city. Scott's son, Charles, Jr., wrote to his brother Daniel that their father was planning to run for Congress in 1792; although Charles, Jr. expressed confidence that his father would be elected, his campaign apparently never materialized or faltered shortly after it began. He was chosen as a presidential elector in 1793.\nWayne originally intended to use Kentucky militiamen in preemptive strikes against the Indians and to conduct the main invasion using only federal troops, but by the time he moved to Fort Washington in mid-1793, he had assembled fewer than 3,000 of the 5,000 troops he had anticipated. He now requested that Scott's and Logan's men join his main force. Logan flatly refused to cooperate with a federal officer, but Scott eventually agreed, and Wayne commissioned him an officer in the federal army on July 1, 1793. He and Governor Isaac Shelby instituted a draft to raise the 1,500 troops he was to command in Wayne's operation. When he joined Wayne at Fort Jefferson on October 21, 1793, he had only been able to raise 1,000 men.\n\nOn November 4, Wayne ordered Scott's militiamen to destroy a nearby Delaware village. Still resentful and distrustful of federal officers and aware that Wayne would not launch a major offensive so close to winter, the men were not enthusiastic about the mission, which many of them considered trivial. That night, 501 of them deserted their camp, though Wayne noted in his report that he believed Scott and his officers had done all they could do to prevent the desertions. Scott attempted to continue the mission with his remaining men, but inclement weather prevented him from conducting a major offensive. Ultimately, the men were only able to disperse a small hunting camp before continuing on to Fort Washington and mustering out on November 10. Wayne ordered Scott to return with a full quota of troops after the winter.\n\nTensions cooled between Wayne and the Kentuckians over the winter of 1793–94. Wayne noticed that, despite their obstinance, the Kentucky volunteers appeared to be good soldiers. The militiamen, after observing Wayne, concluded that he – unlike Harmar and St. Clair – knew how to combat the Indians. Wayne augmented his popularity in Kentucky by building Fort Recovery over the winter on the site of St. Clair's defeat. The Indians' victory over St. Clair had become a part of their lore and inspired them to continue the fight against the western settlers; Wayne's construction of a fort on this site was a blow to the Indian psyche, and his re-burial of some 600 skulls that the Indians had dug up and scattered across the area was popular with Kentuckians, since many of their own were among the dead. While Scott came to respect Wayne personally, his friend, James Wilkinson, began an anonymous campaign to tarnish Wayne's image, coveting command of the Northwest expedition for himself. Scott, on leave in Philadelphia at the time, wrote to Secretary of War Henry Knox to defend Wayne's reputation, breaching his friendship with Wilkinson.\n\nScott returned to Kentucky from Philadelphia in June 1794, mustered 1,500 militiamen, and joined Wayne at Fort Greeneville on July 27. He and Thomas Barbee led this force in support of Wayne's 1,000 regular troops. The combined force marched quickly and captured the recently evacuated Indian town of Grand Glaize on August 8. Here, Wayne ordered the construction of Fort Defiance, which took approximately a week. Scott was responsible for the naming of the fort; while observing its construction, he declared, \"I defy the English, Indians, and all the devils in hell to take it.\" Based upon intelligence provided by Scott's mounted volunteers, Wayne ordered his force to march toward Fort Miami on August 14, anticipating a battle with a combined British and Indian force of 2,400 there. About 8:45a.m. on August 20, Major William Price's brigade of volunteers engaged the Indian force near Fort Miami, beginning the Battle of Fallen Timbers. The well-positioned Indian force turned back Price's men, but Wayne ordered his regulars to conduct a vigorous bayonet charge, which routed the Indians. Major William Campbell, the British commander of Fort Miami, refused to open the fort to his Indian allies, and Wayne's force won a decisive victory.\n\nFollowing the battle, Wayne ordered Scott's volunteers to conduct numerous raids within a fifty-mile radius of their position. Due to a lack of pack horses in Wayne's force, the mounted volunteers were also employed transporting supplies between forts throughout September 1794. They eventually grew weary of garrison duty and complained that the use of their personal horses to transport goods had injured the animals. Many threatened to mutiny if not discharged. On October 13, 1794, Wayne finally ordered them home. In a commendation of Wayne issued on December 4, 1794, the U.S. House of Representatives specifically thanked Scott and his men for their service at the Battle of Fallen Timbers. The Treaty of Greenville formally ended the war in mid-1795.\n\nIn 1795, Scott traveled to Philadelphia to help clarify service records that would determine the final pay of the men who served under him before returning to his farm in Kentucky. He continued to serve, nominally, as major general of the 2nd militia division of the state militia until 1799. Celebrations of Scott's military heroism were held all over Kentucky, sparking his interest in a political career. With the advent of the First Party System, he declared himself a Democratic-Republican, as did most Kentuckians. In 1800, he was chosen as a presidential elector for his district by a vote of 75 to 44 over Caleb Wallace. Scott and his fellow electors all cast their votes for the ticket of Thomas Jefferson and Aaron Burr.\n\nIn 1803, Secretary of War Henry Dearborn appointed Scott and Governor James Garrard to evaluate sites in Kentucky on which to construct a replacement for Fort Washington. Garrard, a central Kentucky native, insisted that the fort should be built at Frankfort. Scott disagreed, contending that the fort should not be in the state's interior and that the hilly terrain around Frankfort was unsuitable for constructing a fort. He waited several days for an appointment with Garrard to try and reach an agreement, but when he was unable to secure one, he asked Dearborn for permission to act alone. Dearborn granted the request and accepted Scott's recommendation of a site in Newport, Kentucky. In 1804, Scott was again chosen a presidential elector with minimal opposition.\n\nIn 1797, Scott's son Daniel, who had settled in Virginia, died. In late 1799 or early 1800, his last son, Charles, Jr., also died. His daughter Martha married future U.S. Senator George M. Bibb in 1799 and moved to Daviess County. Daughter Mary had married and left the farm prior to Scott's return from military service, and youngest daughter Nancy left the farm near the turn of the 19th century, although she never married. After the death of his wife on October 6, 1804, he moved in with his daughter and son-in-law, John and Mary Postlethwait, in Lexington. He sold his farm in Woodford County in October 1805.\n\nAs tensions between the U.S. and Great Britain escalated in the wake of the June 22, 1807, \"Chesapeake\"–\"Leopard\" Affair, Scott applied to Governor Christopher Greenup to raise a mounted militia unit in anticipation of an outbreak of hostilities. Although Greenup granted the requested authorization, Scott remarried on July 25, 1807, and never assembled the militia unit. His second wife, Judith Cary (Bell) Gist, was the 57-year-old widow of Colonel Nathaniel Gist, who had been a prisoner of war with Scott during the Revolutionary War. After their marriage, they moved to Canewood, Gist's family's plantation in Bourbon and Clark counties.\n\nAs the celebrations in honor of Scott's military career continued across Kentucky, he began to consider the possibility of running for governor in 1808. By mid-1806, state senator Thomas Posey and Lexington lawyer Thomas Todd had already declared their candidacies. Posey had been chosen speaker pro tem of the state Senate and, with the death of Lieutenant Governor John Caldwell in 1804, had assumed the role of acting lieutenant governor and presiding officer in the Senate. He subsequently lost his senatorial re-election bid, but continued to act as lieutenant governor and preside over the Senate. His opponents claimed that since he was no longer a member of the Senate, he was not qualified to act as lieutenant governor; additionally, they charged that he was sympathetic to the hated Federalist Party, even though he self-identified as a Democratic-Republican. Although he was not successfully unseated as the Senate's presiding officer, the controversy diminished his chances in the 1808 election. In 1807, Todd removed himself from contention as well, accepting Governor Greenup's appointment to the Kentucky Court of Appeals.\n\nPosey's diminished candidacy and Todd's exit from the race left only one major impediment to Scott's potential candidacy. A movement began in Kentucky to draft former Governor Isaac Shelby as a candidate for another term. Known as \"Old King's Mountain\" for his heroic role in the Revolutionary War Battle of King's Mountain, Shelby could match Scott's military appeal, and as a former delegate to Kentucky's statehood and constitutional conventions and a former governor, his political experience far exceeded Scott's. Ultimately Shelby declined to run, and Scott officially declared his candidacy on February 11, 1808. John Allen had by then declared his candidacy and Green Clay's announcement followed Scott's by about a month. Scott's campaign was managed by his stepson-in-law, Jesse Bledsoe, a law professor at Transylvania University. Bledsoe was among the most able politicians in the state, though he preferred the role of \"kingmaker\" to that of candidate.\n\nAllen and Clay, both lawyers by profession, were hurt by a general distrust of lawyers by the Kentucky electorate. Further, Allen had served as general counsel for Aaron Burr, and several anonymous letters to the state's newspapers accused him of being privy to Burr's alleged scheme to create an independent state in the southwest. Henry Clay was among those who vigorously defended Allen from the charges. Scott also frequently spoke in highly complimentary terms of Allen. As a legislator, Green Clay pushed for measures favorable to debtors; he consequently enjoyed strong support from settlers south of the Green River, many of whom were squatters and land speculators who owed substantial debts to the state. To counter Scott's hero image, Clay supporters pointed to his service with George Rogers Clark in a 1782 expedition against the Shawnee, but the impact of this line of campaigning was minimal. As the most senior Revolutionary War officer in Kentucky, Scott became the recognized leader of the state's veterans' lobby. The Independence Day celebrations held around the state just before the August 1 election provided a boost for his campaign. On election day, he garnered 22,050 votes, compared to 8,430 votes for Allen and 5,516 votes for Clay.\n\nAmong Scott's first acts as governor was appointing Jesse Bledsoe as Secretary of State. Bledsoe delivered Scott's first address to the legislature on December 13, 1808. Later that winter, Scott was injured when he slipped on the icy steps of the governor's mansion; the injury left him confined to crutches for the rest of his life and rendered him even more dependent on Bledsoe to perform many of his official functions. His physical condition continued to worsen throughout his term as governor.\n\nIn domestic matters, Scott advocated increased salaries for public officials, economic development measures, and heavy punishments for persistent criminals. While he desired a tax code that would preclude the need for the state to borrow money, he encouraged legislators to keep taxes as low as possible. He also urged them to convert the militia into a youth army. The General Assembly routinely ignored his calls for reform but did pass a measure he advocated that allowed debtors a one-year stay on collection of their debts if they provided both bond and security.\n\nScott frequently clashed with the legislature, including once when the Senate refused to confirm the appointment of Dr. Walter Brashear as lieutenant colonel commandant of the state militia's second regiment. The governor refused to nominate anyone else for the position, saying that Brashear was the best person for it, and he assumed the senators would not want to be sent a worse nomination. He employed his gubernatorial veto three times over the course of his tenure, but all three were overridden by the legislature. Measures creating Harrison County and allowing squatters to purchase occupied land on more favorable terms were both vetoed because Scott felt that they had been passed too hastily to allow proper debate. Scott also vetoed the revocation of a pension granted to recently retired Kentucky Court of Appeals justice George Muter, because he felt it undermined citizens' confidence in the promises of their government.\n\nThroughout his term, Scott was dogged by rumors of heavy drinking and frequent use of profanity. On one occasion, an unnamed individual believed his reputation had been injured by something Scott had said and challenged him to a duel. He ignored the challenge, after which the challenger threatened to expose him as a coward. Scott was supposed to have replied, \"Post and be damned; but if you do, you will only post yourself a damned liar, and everybody else will say so.\" On another occasion, after reviewing a speech written for him by Bledsoe, the governor was said to have remarked, \"Well, Mr. Bledsoe, I know you think you are a damned sight smarter than I am, and so you are in many respects; but this message as it is now, won't do at all; I'll be damned if it will.\" When Bledsoe asked what was wrong with the speech, he reportedly replied, \"Why, damn it to hell, why don't you put a good solemn prayer at the end of it, and talk about Providence, and the protection of Heaven, and all that?\" After the governor campaigned for Humphrey Marshall's opponent in the 1809 legislative elections, Marshall published an article in the \"Western World\" newspaper that accused him of appearing in front of the court house drunk on election day.\n\nFor most of Scott's tenure as governor, tensions between the U.S. and Great Britain escalated. Sentiment in favor of a U.S. declaration of war against the British was particularly strong in Kentucky. Most Kentuckians resented the replacement of the Embargo Act of 1807 with the weaker Non-Intercourse Act of 1809 and Macon's Bill Number 2. Kentucky Senator Henry Clay became the acknowledged leader of the war hawks in Congress. During an address to the General Assembly on December 4, 1810, Scott expressed little hope of peacefully resolving U.S. grievances against Great Britain. He reminded the General Assembly that France had also violated the United States' maritime rights and urged equal treatment of the two countries for their offenses.\nIn September 1811, William Henry Harrison, then governor of Indiana Territory, visited Kentucky and directed Colonel Samuel Wells to recruit Kentuckians for a new federal regiment then being formed by the authority of Secretary of War William Eustis. Harrison had not applied to Scott for permission to recruit in the state, and many Kentuckians – from Scott's political enemy, Humphrey Marshall, to his trusted advisor, Jesse Bledsoe – perceived this as a slight to the governor. Ignoring Bledsoe's indignation, Scott refused to make an issue of the \"faux pas\" and instead became one of the staunchest supporters of Harrison's rising career.\n\nIn November 1811, a messenger brought news to Kentucky of former Kentucky Attorney General Joseph Hamilton Daveiss's death at the Battle of Tippecanoe, amplifying Kentuckians' outcry for war with the British and Indians. In anticipation of a federal call for volunteers, Scott published messages in the state's newspapers in February and April 1812 whipping up support for the impending war effort. By the end of July, the state's quota of 5,500 volunteers had been met. On August 14, 1812, Scott greeted two regiments of soldiers at the governor's mansion just prior to their muster at Georgetown. He hobbled among the soldiers with his crutch, then turned and hammered it against the mansion's steps and was heard to mutter \"If it hadn't been for you, I could have gone with the boys myself.\"\n\nOn August 25, 1812, Scott's last day in office, he appointed Harrison brevet major general over the Kentucky militia. The appointment was made on advice from incoming Governor Isaac Shelby and Henry Clay. The brevet ensured that Harrison, and not James Winchester – who was unpopular in Kentucky and with his own troops – would lead the state's military forces in the war. Biographer Harry M. Ward noted that Harrison's commission was unconstitutional both because he was not a citizen of the state and because the state militia's allotment of major generals had already been filled. Kentucky historian Lowell H. Harrison concurred that the commission was \"probably illegal\", but further noted that it was \"acclaimed across the state\". The show of confidence from Scott and his aides influenced President James Madison to appoint Harrison as supreme commander of the Army of the Northwest.\n\nFollowing his term as governor, Scott retired to his Canewood estate with his wife and youngest step-daughter, Mary Cecil Gist. Two of his stepdaughters had married during his term as governor. In 1809, Anna Maria Gist married Captain Nathaniel G. S. Hart, who was killed in the River Raisin Massacre in January 1813. Eliza Violet Gist married Francis Preston Blair on July 21, 1812, just prior to the expiration of Scott's term as governor. The governor opined that Blair, who was slightly built, stoop-shouldered, and suffering from tuberculosis, would leave Eliza a widow within six months. Blair survived the tuberculosis and went on to become a trusted advisor to President Andrew Jackson. He outlived Scott's prediction for him by more than sixty years.\n\nBy mid-1813, Scott's health had begun to fail rapidly. He died on October 22, 1813, and was buried on the grounds of Canewood. At the time of his death, he was one of the last surviving generals of the Revolutionary War. His remains were re-interred at Frankfort Cemetery in 1854. Scott County, Kentucky, and Scott County, Indiana, are named in his honor, as are the cities of Scottsville, Kentucky, and Scottsville, Virginia.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2168857", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2168857", "title": "Hank Hall", "text": "Hank Hall\n\nHank Hall is a fictional character in the DC Comics universe who first appeared in \"Showcase\" #75 as Hawk of Hawk and Dove. He later became the supervillain Monarch in the crossover event limited series \"Armageddon 2001\". \n\nAfter that, he became known as Extant, and appeared in the \"Zero Hour\" limited series (as well as some related tie-ins). Hawk was restored, and in the final issue of \"Blackest Night\", he was finally returned to life.\n\nHawk has appeared in numerous cartoon television shows and films. He appears in his first live adaptation in the DC Universe series \"Titans\", played by Alan Ritchson.\n\nHank Hall was originally the superhero Hawk of Hawk and Dove. Hawk represented \"chaos\", while Dove represented \"order\". His brother Don Hall died during Crisis on Infinite Earths and was replaced with Dawn Granger.\n\nMonarch was an oppressive tyrant from a bleak, dystopian Earth fifty years in the future. The people were unhappy with his rule, particularly a scientist named Matthew Ryder, an expert on temporal studies, who was convinced he could use his technology to travel back in time and prevent the maniacal ruler from ever coming to power. He learned that forty years ago, one of Earth's strongest and most powerful heroes would eventually turn evil and become Monarch, and ten years from that event he would conquer the world. During a time travel experiment, Matthew was transformed into a being called \"Waverider\", and began searching the timestream for the hero who would become Monarch, not knowing that Monarch was following him. When Monarch came into battle with the heroes of the present day, he killed Dove, and her enraged partner killed him for it. Removing the villain's mask, Hank discovered that he was Monarch, and donned the armor.\n\nThe reveal of Hank Hall as Monarch led to some controversy amongst the fan community; Monarch was originally intended to be revealed as Captain Atom, with clues in the story pointing towards this which had to be discarded when it was changed at the last minute. This change was due to the premature leaking of Monarch's identity. While Monarch was always supposed to be Captain Atom, this was supposed to be a secret. When Monarch's identity was prematurely leaked, DC decided to preserve the surprise of the story by switching Monarch's identity to that of Hank Hall.\n\nAs many fans pointed out, \"Hawk and Dove Annual\" #2 had Hank Hall fighting Monarch face to face in 2001 with Hawk being the destroyer of Monarch. Dove allowed Waverider to see a multitude of futures and realize Hawk is Monarch.\n\nWhen hostile aliens encounter Monarch and Captain Atom in the past (sometime between 230 and 65 million years ago), they attempt to enlist both (with each figure having no knowledge of the other involved) to assist them in creating a wormhole. The wormhole's creation would destroy the universe in which the primitive Earth existed, but would allow the aliens to travel freely.\n\nShortly after returning to the present, Monarch confronted Waverider and used his power to see the past and future to become aware of the power within him. It is explained at this point, that when Monarch killed Dove, her powers went directly into Hawk. Realising this, Monarch unleashes his hidden powers and becomes Extant. Extant then removes Waverider's timetravel device and joins forces with renegade Green Lantern Hal Jordan, now known as Parallax, in a plan to alter time as they saw fit.\n\nHis first act was to alter the future so that he could have a metahuman army at his disposal, mostly consisting of members of the Teen Titans; his plan was to amass an army so powerful that no one could interfere with his efforts to control time itself. Several armies of heroes banded together to stop his plans before they began in the 30th century, and altered history so that his followers never came to exist in the future.\n\nDown, but not out, Extant began to strike back at the heroes at Ground Zero, the beginning of time. Parallax had warped several metahumans from various time periods together for the ultimate assault, and Extant hit the Atom with a chronal blast, de-aging him into a teenager. Sensing defeat was imminent, he escaped the fight, promising vengeance at a later date.\n\nExtant would first reappear in the 1999 one-shot \"Impulse: Bart Saves the Universe\". In it, Extant picks a fight with the original Justice Society as a means of tricking the Linear Men into saving the life of an innocent bystander who was destined to die. The man they saved would now go on to develop a nuclear weapon that, when tested, would shift the Earth out of its proper orbit, causing massive changes in the timelines of some of Earth's greatest heroes. Among these changes, Hal Jordan never becomes Green Lantern, thus he never becomes Parallax, and never stops Extant from destroying all of time. Fortunately for the citizens of time, Impulse arrives and is barely able to defeat Extant and prevent the Linear Men from saving the doomed scientist.\n\nHe would engage the Justice Society again on a later date as he sought to acquire the reality-warping power of the Worlogog, recently dismantled by Hourman because he feared its power. Although Extant succeeded in his goal with the aid of Metron's stolen Mobius Chair, Doctor Fate learned from the imprisoned Mordru that when Hourman had dismantled the Worlogog, he had retained a small fragment of it, thus creating infinitesimal flaw in the prime Worlogog that the JSA could exploit.\n\nAfter the resurrected Dove sacrificed herself to distract Extant, Hourman divided his Hour of Power amongst his teammates, thus granting them all immunity to Extant's reality warping powers for four minutes, each of them attacking him on a different temporal plane until they were able to separate him from the Worlogog. Following this setback, Extant again attempted to escape. Instead, Extant was teleported by Hourman and Metron, at Atom Smasher's behest, into the seat of an airplane whose crash Kobra had caused earlier (in his relative timestream). As a result of this, Atom Smasher's mother was saved (as she was on the plane when it crashed), but Atom Smasher replaced his mother with a weakened Extant, saving her life but murdering the super villain to stop his threat and ensure that the same number of people died on that plane who had died originally.\n\nIn response to fan-criticism of \"Armageddon 2001\", many of whose readers felt that the character of Hawk had been severely misused in the story's last-minute changes, DC Comics set about restoring the character as he had originally been intended; a hero. DC had already retconned Extant's portion of Hank Hall's timeline in issue 14 of \"JSA\", dated September 2000, in which Metron announced his intention to erase the villain's \"wretched timeline\" with his Mobius Chair. This was the second issue of a 3-part story entitled \"The Hunt for Extant!\", (the details of which are listed above). After this, DC also retconned Monarch's portion of Hall's timeline with the final issue of the 6-part miniseries The Battle for Blüdhaven, dated September 2006, which now depicted Captain Atom's transformation into Monarch, as had been DC's original intention back in 1991. Hawk was restored, but he would not be revived until the final issue of \"Blackest Night\".\n\nIn the \"Blackest Night\" crossover, Hank Hall is reanimated as a member of the undead Black Lantern Corps. The black power rings also try to reanimate his brother Don, but are denied, stating \"Don Hall of Earth at Peace\". Hank then tracks down and attacks Dawn and the new Hawk (Holly Granger). After a short battle, Hank rams his hand into Holly's chest, ripping her heart out, and using it to charge his ring. Holly's body is then revived by a black ring, and the two attack Dawn together. Severely outmatched, Dawn retreats, with Hank and Holly giving chase. Hank and Holly follow Dawn to Titans Tower, where more Black Lantern Titans are attacking the living heroes. The two eventually overwhelm Dawn, with Holly plunging her hand into Dawn's chest. Dawn suddenly radiates a white energy that completely destroys Holly's body and ring. The other Black Lanterns, seeing Dawn as their greatest threat, attack her. However, she turns the light on them, destroying all but Hank, Tempest and Terra who quickly retreat. While battling the Black Lanterns at Coast City, Hank is later brought back to life by the power of the white light. Dawn has a vision of Don who tells Dawn that she can save Hank, and to not give up on him.\n\nAt the beginning of the \"Brightest Day\" event, Hank and Dawn begin working together again as a crime-fighting duo. Dawn expresses worries over Hank's increasingly violent demeanor, but he simply brushes off her concerns. While stopping an army of powerful teenaged super villains in Gotham City, Hank and Dawn are invited by Zinda Blake to join the Birds of Prey. The two are immediately called by Oracle to help Black Canary and Huntress during their battle with a dangerous villainess known as the White Canary. Dove attempts to defeat her herself, but is surprised when White Canary is somehow able to dodge her attack and then draw blood from her. Hank and Dawn later encounter Deadman who Hank asks to resurrect Don. At a crater in Silver City, New Mexico, Deadman attempts to revive Don, only to be prevented from doing so by the Entity. As a number of onlookers (including Jackson Hyde) watch the Entity speak to the heroes, it instructs Hank to catch the boomerang that Captain Boomerang will throw at Dove.\n\nAfter being injured trying to kill himself because of depression, Hank Hall is sent to a hospital while his teammates plan their next move. During his hospital stay, Hank has a vision of himself, clad in a White Lantern uniform and talking to Don. Just before the dream ends, Don assures his brother that he is at peace. Later, Dawn is transported to the Star City forest by the Entity, Hawk unintentionally went with her, but when the \"dark avatar\" made his presence known, the Entity tells them that they must protect the forest and withstand the ultimate savior, which is Alec Holland.\n\nIt was revealed that Captain Boomerang's mission for throwing the boomerang was to free Hawk as an avatar of war from the Lords of Chaos because his act of saving Dove would have broken their hold on him to be his own self. However, he failed to catch the boomerang and instead it was caught by Boston Brand, who ended up dying in the process and used his final act to move his white power ring to Alec Holland and bring back the Swamp Thing in order to cleanse the Green of Nekron's influence.\n\nAs Hawk he possessed a \"danger sense transformation\" which allowed him to change into a super-human with the powers of super strength, unlimited stamina, enhanced speed, increased agility, enhanced body density, extreme durability and healing factor. \n\nHis partner Dove suppresses his violent nature, and without him or her Hank's rage becomes boundless.\n\nAs Monarch he possessed the same powers that he had as Hawk, along with a suit of highly durable armor that was crafted using advanced technology.\n\nAs Extant he had the powers of chronokinesis, energy projection, flight, and omniscience. After piecing together the Worlogog he became nigh-omnipotent.\n\nWhile he was a member of the Black Lantern Corps, Hank wielded a black power ring which allowed him to generate black energy constructs. He was also able to perceive emotional auras. However, whilst he was able to perceive Holly's aura as red for rage, he saw Dawn's as a pure white that his ring could not identify. While wearing the black power ring it lowers his original power by over 50%.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2168861", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2168861", "title": "George Madison", "text": "George Madison\n\nGeorge Madison (June 1763 – October 14, 1816) was the sixth Governor of Kentucky. He was the first governor of Kentucky to die in office, serving only a few weeks in 1816. Little is known of Madison's early life. He was a member of the influential Madison family of Virginia, and was a second cousin to President James Madison. He served with distinction in three wars – the Revolutionary War, Northwest Indian War, and War of 1812. He was twice wounded in the Northwest Indian War, and in the War of 1812 he was taken prisoner following the Battle of Frenchtown in Michigan.\n\nMadison's political experience before becoming governor consisted of a twenty-year tenure as state auditor. Although his military service made him extremely popular in Kentucky, he sought no higher office until the citizens insisted he run for governor in 1816. James Johnson, his only challenger in the race, dropped out early due to Madison's overwhelming popularity, and Madison was elected without opposition. A few weeks later, he became the first Kentucky governor to die in office. Opponents of his lieutenant governor, Gabriel Slaughter, mounted a popular but unsuccessful challenge to Slaughter's succeeding Madison in office.\n\nGeorge Madison was born in June 1763 in the portion of Augusta County, Virginia that eventually became Rockingham County. His parents were John and Agatha (Strother) Madison. His brother James became the Episcopal bishop of Virginia and the president of the College of William & Mary. Another brother was Captain Thomas Madison. They were second cousins to President James Madison.\n\nMadison was educated in the local schools and also received instruction at home. Before he was legally old enough to enlist, he entered the Continental Army as a private during the Revolutionary War.\n\nIt is not known when Madison moved to Kentucky, but land records in Lincoln County indicate he and his brother Gabriel were there by at least 1784. He married Jane Smith and they had four children – Agatha, William, Myra, and George. Jane Smith-Madison died in 1811.\n\nMadison served with the Kentucky militia during the Northwest Indian War. He was a subaltern in Arthur St. Clair's army in the American defeat at the Battle of the Wabash on November 4, 1791. During the retreat, a soldier named William Kennan found Madison sitting on a log. Kennan was being pursued by Indians and admonished Madison to run, but Madison, who was already known to be of frail constitution, stood to reveal that he had been badly wounded and was bleeding profusely. Kennan quickly retrieved an abandoned horse he had seen; he helped Madison astride the horse, and they both escaped.\n\nLater in the war, Madison served under Major John Adair. On November 5, 1792, Adair's men were encamped near Fort St. Clair when they were ambushed by an Indian force under the command of Little Turtle. Adair ordered a retreat, then rallied his men and divided them into three groups. He ordered those under Madison to turn the enemy's flank, but they failed and Madison was wounded again in this battle. Following this, Adair withdrew to Fort St. Clair. In Adair's report to Brigadier General James Wilkinson, he wrote: \"Madison's bravery and conduct need no comment; they are well-known.\"\n\nGovernor Isaac Shelby appointed Madison as Auditor of Public Accounts on March 7, 1796. He served in this capacity in state government for twenty years. He never sought a higher office but 19th-century historian Lewis Collins said that \"there was no office within the gift of the people which he could not have easily attained, without the slightest solicitation.\" In 1800, Madison was appointed as a trustee of the Kentucky Seminary in Franklin County. On December 5, 1806, he served on a grand jury in the case of Aaron Burr's conduct; they did not find grounds for treason charges. Madison was appointed director of the Bank of Kentucky later that year.\n\nDuring the War of 1812, Governor Shelby called for volunteers to serve in the Army of the Northwest. Colonel John Allen raised a regiment, and Madison was commissioned as his second-in-command. The regiment, known as the 1st Rifle Regiment of Kentucky Volunteers, fought under James Winchester at the Battle of Frenchtown. Winchester was captured by General Henry Procter, but about four hundred men under Madison repelled several charges by the British. Madison's men believed they had won the victory when they observed a white flag in the midst of the British force, but the flag was being waved by Winchester as an order for Madison's force to surrender.\n\nWhen Madison discovered that Winchester was waving the flag, he refused the order to surrender on grounds that, as a prisoner, Winchester had no authority to issue it. Proctor demanded Madison's unconditional surrender, but Madison insisted that the terms of surrender include Proctor's protection of the American prisoners from the Indian allies of the British. Proctor initially balked at anything but an unconditional surrender, but after Madison's promise that the Americans would \"sell their lives as dearly as possible\", Proctor acquiesced.\n\nProctor had taken as many prisoners as he had soldiers, and had little power to enforce the terms he had agreed to. The American non-commissioned officers were paroled to return home. Madison and the other officers were taken to Fort Malden, then on to a prison in Quebec. The American wounded who could not march were left under the care of American physicians. Shortly after the battle, the Indians looted the American provisions, which included a large quantity of whiskey. Drunk and violent, they slaughtered many of the American wounded in what became known as the Massacre of the River Raisin.\n\nMadison was freed from prison a year after his capture, as part of a prisoner exchange. He returned to Kentucky following his release and was honored at a public dinner on September 6, 1814. In 1816, he resigned as auditor of public accounts due to failing health. But, submitting to public demand, he became a candidate for governor later that year. James Johnson, the other candidate for office, withdrew from the race due to Madison's popularity, thus the latter was elected without opposition.\n\nMadison traveled to Blue Lick Springs for his health soon after the election, but was too weak to return to Frankfort for the inauguration. A Bourbon County justice of the peace administered the oath of office on September 5, 1816 at the springs. Madison's only official act of office was the appointment of Colonel Charles S. Todd as secretary of state. He died on October 14, 1816, just weeks into his term, the first governor of the state to die in office. He is buried in Frankfort Cemetery.\n\nOpponents of his lieutenant governor, Gabriel Slaughter, immediately challenged his ascendancy to the governorship. They claimed that a governor should not be allowed to serve without having been elected to that office by the people. A measure calling for a special gubernatorial election easily passed the state House of Representatives, but failed in the senate by a vote of 18–14. Slaughter was allowed to exercise the powers of the governor, but many government officials and citizens of the state refused to call him by that title, opting for \"acting governor\" or \"lieutenant governor\" instead.\n\n\nPowell, \"Encyclopedia of Kentucky\", and NGA give Madison's birthplace as Augusta County. Harrison and Hopkins both give Rockingham County.<br>\n\"Encyclopedia of Kentucky\" names these four children. Powell names only two: George and Myra. Hopkins references five children, but does not name them.\n\n"}

{"id": "2168885", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2168885", "title": "Kibeho massacre", "text": "Kibeho massacre\n\nThe Kibeho massacre occurred in a camp for internally displaced persons near Kibeho, in south-west Rwanda on April 22, 1995. Australian soldiers serving as part of the United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda estimated at least 4,000 people in the camp were killed by soldiers of the military wing of the Rwandan Patriotic Front, known as the Rwandan Patriotic Army. The Rwandan Government estimated the death toll to be 338.\n\nFollowing the Rwandan genocide and the victory by the army of the Tutsi-dominated Rwandan Patriotic Army (RPA), many ethnic Hutus, including an unknown number of those who had committed genocide, (Génocidaires) fled from the RPF controlled areas to zones controlled by the French as part of Opération Turquoise and into the neighbouring states of Burundi, Zaire, and Tanzania. When the French withdrew in August 1994, the administration of a number of internally displaced persons (IDP) camps was taken over by the United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda (UNAMIR) and a number of aid organizations. The new Rwandan government, dominated by the victorious Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF), wished to identify those individuals and Interahamwe militia members in the camps who had committed genocide.\n\nIn late 1994, the large camps in the former so-called Safe Humanitarian Zones housed about 350,000 people. The UN set up an Integrated Operations Centre (IOC) to handle the caseload and managed to repatriate about 80,000 IDPs between October 1994 and January 1995. However, this period fortuitously coincided with the period when the new RPF government had reduced the activities of its kill squads after their activities were documented in the officially-denied Gersony Report. In January 1995, after RPF fears of Western sanctions had abated and the sanctioned killings had resumed, the IDPs refused to return to their home villages, where they would be vulnerable to the kill squads. By the third week of February, the OIC had basically stopped working and the camps were filling back up with villagers fleeing the violence in the hills. The UN field workers were caught in a Catch-22. \"The government's hostility to the camps was profound, visceral...A large proportion of those who had taken shelter within Zone Turquoise were seen by the government as perpetrators of the genocide\", in the words of the former director of the United Nations Rwanda Emergency Office (UNREO), and the RPF was contemptuous of the inadequate programs proposed by the UN bureaucracy. In contrast, scholar Gerard Prunier asserts that \"the camps sheltered thousands of women and children as well as men who might or might not have been genocidaires.\" Meanwhile, UN headquarters in New York City insisted on proper procedures and close cooperation with the RPF government. The former UNREO director would later write, \"The government was on board but never fully committed, allowing the humanitarian community to assume responsibility for an 'integrated' approach that in reality never existed.\" The IOC situation reports reflected its conflicting responsibilities, blaming a \"deliberate campaign of disinformation\" for IDPs refusing to leave the camps, while nearly simultaneously reporting \"people return to the camps, fearing for their personal safety. There have been reports that some people are fleeing the communes and entering the camps for the first time.\"\n\nBy early 1995, the Kibeho IDP camp was the largest in Rwanda, sprawling for 9 square kilometers and containing between 80,000 and 100,000 people. UNAMIR presence at the camp was maintained by a Zambian infantry company, with medical services provided by Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF). The RPA maintained a tight cordon around the camp. Refugees wishing to leave the camp to return home had to pass through a checkpoint, where genocide survivors would point out individuals who had taken part in the 1994 killings. \n\nOn 17 April 1995, the \"préfet\" of Butare announced that all camps in the prefecture would be closed immediately. The declared aim of this was to forcibly separate known Génocidaires from those who would be sent home via a staging camp in nearby Butare. Taken by surprise, UNAMIR hastily dispatched 32 Australian soldiers and medical officers to support its presence in Kibeho, on 18 April. \n\nColonel P.G. Warfe of the Australian Army would later describe the events of that day:\nThe Tutsi RPF minister of rehabilitation, Jacques Bihozagara, held a press conference in which he noted, \"There are rumours that if the IDPs return home they will be killed... If that were the government's intention then it would have gone ahead and killed the people within the camps. After all, the camps are within Rwandan territory.\" In contrast, the Hutu RPF minister of the interior, Seth Sendashonga, rushed to Kibeho the next day to stop the shooting and, upon his return to Kigali, held an emergency meeting of the UN and NGOs to arrange transport for the IDPs before the RPA lost all restraint. He further briefed Prime Minister Faustin Twagiramungu, President Pasteur Bizimungu and Vice President/Defense Minister Paul Kagame, who assured him that he would make sure things stayed under control. The next day soldiers opened fire again, killing twenty and killing sixty before surrounding the camp. Journalist and eyewitness Linda Polman, who was accompanying the approximately 80 Zambian soldiers from UNAMIR at Kibeho, described the situation that day:\nSeveral days of mounting tension between those in the camp and the RPF soldiers followed, with the RPF firing (at people and into the air) to control and move the refugees into an increasingly smaller area as processing of IDP continued. One of the Australian medics, Major Carol Vaughan-Evans recalled \"I remember getting there four days preceding the massacre and we certainly weren't wanted. The Government forces [RPA] made that very, very clear... They insisted we only treat people who had decided to leave the camp... The government forces were extremely aggressive indicating that if we didn't empty the hospital they would...[by] killing people who remained\"\n\nOn the morning of 22 April the UNAMIR force discovered about 100 refugees had been wounded or killed in the night. About half of those injured had gunshot wounds, presumably from RPA soldiers, the remainder machete wounds, presumably from Génocidaires who were \"trying to terrorise the refugees into remaining in the camp… so as to provide a human shield.\"\n\nNot long after 10 am, in heavy rain, RPA forces began firing into the crowd in the hospital compound, causing a stampede of refugees against razor wire and barricades. RPA forces continued to fire at fleeing refugees for the next two hours. While initially firing into the massed crowd with rifles, the RPA later began using 60mm mortars. Corporal Paul Jordan wrote \"we watched (and could do little more) as these people were hunted down and shot.\" The RPA slowed for a while after lunch before resuming fire until about 6 pm.\n\nThe MSF and Australian medical teams struggled to cope with the large numbers of wounded, many of whom were later evacuated to Kigali hospital. Despite this, the medical teams continued their work while the infantry sections brought in wounded to the clearing station and hospital, during breaks in the firing. During the morning the hospital was also moved, under fire, into the Zambian compound. Firing continued intermittently throughout the day. Jordan recalls seeing people being \"killed all over the camp.\" The RPA also directed automatic rounds, rocket propelled grenades and .50 calibre machine gun fire at another wave of IDP who tried to break out after 5.00 pm.\n\nThe RPA began burying bodies during the night of 22–23 April. At daybreak of 23 April, Australian Medical Corps personnel began counting the dead. About 4200 were counted in the areas to which they had access, and they noted evidence that unseen bodies had already been removed Terry Pickard's account states the RPA forced Australians to stop counting bodies \"when they realised what was going on\". The Australians estimated that there were still 400-500 bodies uncounted, not including those removed. Scholar Gérard Prunier posits that \"a not unreasonable estimate\" would be over 5000 dead. There were also many wounded, but not as many as would be expected as in combat, as most of the dead were bayoneted or shot at close range, and thus died of their wounds.\n\nMinister Sendashonga had attempted to reach Kibeho on the morning of 23 April but was turned away by the army. President Bizimungu arrived that same afternoon and was told that there had been about three hundred casualties, which he accepted without comment. Bizimungu showed displeasure when a Zambian officer tried to present him with the figure compiled by the Australian unit. Both Rwandan government and UN officials minimized the numbers killed, giving public estimates of 330 and 2000 killed respectively. However, a series of photos taken by UN Provost Marshal Mark Cuthbert-Brown show some of the extent of the massacre on the morning of 23 April, as Zambian troops commenced moving bodies. \n\nInterior Minister Sendashonga asked for an international commission of inquiry but was rebuffed by Kagame. An Independent International Commission of Inquiry, consisting of members handpicked by the RPF, was formed and led by RPF member Christine Omutonyi. After meeting in Kigali between 3 and 8 May, without any field visits, the commission reached a conclusion backing the government account of events that criminal or genocidaire elements were in the camp and that the massacre had happened when \"there had been firing from the IDPs and the RPA suffered casualties... The RPA responded by firing into the crowd,\" and noted that they could not determine fatalities because of \"logistics and time constraints\". The government figure of 338 casualties has never been questioned by any official body.\n\nThose IDPs who were forced to leave the camps were subject to attacks by crowds seeking vengeance for family killed during the genocide, as well as dehydration and exhaustion. On April 24, the IOC announced that 145,228 IDPs had returned to Butare Prefecture from the camps, and two days later revised this figure down to 60,177. Prunier, attempting to make sense of these numbers, notes that if a low estimate of the pre-crisis Kibeho population (about 80,000) is taken as correct, this still means that at least 20,000 people \"vanished.\" From this, Prunier concludes that it is likely that 20,000 to 30,000 former residents of Kibeho died after the massacre as a result of being expelled from the comparative safety of the camps.\nHundreds of patients were evacuated to, triaged and treated at the UN hospital in Kigali operated by the Australian Defence Force. All age groups and both genders were represented with Defence clinicians working round the clock with limited staff and consumable resources. All areas of the hospital were overloaded, including wards, ICU and the operating theatre.\n\nOne Australian eyewitness notes that, \"the events which occurred on that day are still not completely clear but one theory based on the reports of several eye witnesses and Intel reports is as follows\":\nAn account by Thomas Odom, the US Defence Attache in Kinshasa, described the cause in the same way: \"Hard-liners (in the camp) drove other IDPs like cattle to try to break through RPA lines and the RPA commander lost control of the situation. His report adds; \"the camp was heavily populated by people \"involved in the 1994 genocide... and ... was an active insurgent base.\" Odom uses the UN estimate of 2000 killed.\n\nGérard Prunier, author of \"The Rwanda Crisis\" and \"Africa's World War\", expresses skepticism of the claims that génocidaires were a significant factor in the massacre and characterizes the Kibeho as being a miniature version of the characteristics of the invasion of Zaire that would occur 18 months later: \"nontreatment of the consequences of genocide, well-meaning but politically blind humanitarianism, RPF resolve to 'solve the problem' by force, stunned impotence of the international community in the face of violence, and, finally, a hypocritical denial that anything much had happened.\"\n\nThe Kibeho Massacre, and its aftermath, began the final fracturing of the government of national unity that had been created in July 1994. Seth Sendashonga came to the conclusion that the Hutu were being collectively treated as murderers and being shot without trial. He proceeded to make himself a hindrance to the RPF, declaring that the many people arrested from Kibeho should not be held in crowded cells where they were suffocating to death and then canceling an attempt by Kigali mayor Rose Kabuye to distinguish current city residents from those residents returning from Zaire by color-coding their residency permits. After the Directorate of Military Intelligence (DMI) leaked a memo to the press identifying Sendashunga as linked to \"extremist forces\", he disbanded the Local Defense Forces (LDF), groups set up to replace police but largely turned into thugs under the direction of RPF rural leaders. Prime Minister Twagiramungu called a special security meeting on 23 August that reached a climax after three days when Sendashonga, Minister of Finance Marc Rugenera and Vice Prime Minister Alexis Kanyarengwe (all Hutus who had been publicly identified by the DMI as being potential traitors) were joined by Tutsi minister of women's affairs Aloysia Inyumba in confronting Kagame, especially over his recent selection of 117 Tutsis out of the 145 newly appointed \"bourmestres\". Kagame responded by leaving the room, thus ending the meeting. After two days, Prime Minister Twagiramungu announced his resignation but President Bizimungu, furious at the rebellion within the ranks of the government, got Parliament to fire Twagiramungu on August 28. The next day, Sendashonga, Minister of Transport and Communications Immaculée Kayumba, Minister of Justice Alphonse-Marie Nkubito and Minister of Information Jean-Baptiste Nkuriyingoma were fired. Sendashonga and Twagiramungu were placed under house arrest, but were eventually allowed to leave the country unharmed by the end of the year. While the government of national unity ostensibly continued until the presidential crisis of 2000, these events destroyed it for all practical purposes.\n\nJohan Pottier argues that the manner in which the RPF government restricted the access of journalists to information about Kibeho foreshadowed its approach in eastern Zaire later. He states, \"Kibeho was a half-way stage in the development of Kagame's doctrine of tight information control.\"\n\nFour Australians were awarded the Medal for Gallantry for their distinguished service at Kibeho, the first gallantry medals awarded to Australians since the Vietnam War; Corporal Andrew Miller, Warrant Officer Rod Scott, Lieutenant Thomas Tilbrook and Major (then Captain) Carol Vaughan-Evans. All available accounts indicate that the small Australian team found the event deeply distressing, and were frustrated both by being unable to encourage many of the IDP to return home before the massacre and being helpless to prevent it once it was underway. However, some commentaries claim that the Australian actions helped reduce the numbers killed and wounded. Writing in the Australian Army Journal, Paul Jordan, has said that: \"While there was little that we could have done to stop the killings, I believe that, if Australians had not been there as witnesses to the massacre, the RPA would have killed every single person in the camp.\" \n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2168889", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2168889", "title": "Asset allocation", "text": "Asset allocation\n\nAsset allocation is the implementation of an investment strategy that attempts to balance risk versus reward by adjusting the percentage of each asset in an investment portfolio according to the investor's risk tolerance, goals and investment time frame. The focus is on the characteristics of the overall portfolio. Such a strategy contrasts with an approach that focuses on individual assets.\n\nMany financial experts argue that asset allocation is an important factor in determining returns for an investment portfolio. Asset allocation is based on the principle that different assets perform differently in different market and economic conditions.\n\nA fundamental justification for asset allocation is the notion that different asset classes offer returns that are not perfectly correlated, hence diversification reduces the overall risk in terms of the variability of returns for a given level of expected return. Asset diversification has been described as \"the only free lunch you will find in the investment game\". Academic research has painstakingly explained the importance and benefits of asset allocation and the problems of active management (see academic studies section below).\n\nAlthough the risk is reduced as long as correlations are not perfect, it is typically forecast (wholly or in part) based on statistical relationships (like correlation and variance) that existed over some past period. Expectations for return are often derived in the same way. Studies of these forecasting methods constitute an important direction of academic research.\n\nWhen such backward-looking approaches are used to forecast future returns or risks using the traditional mean-variance optimization approach to the asset allocation of modern portfolio theory (MPT), the strategy is, in fact, predicting future risks and returns based on history. As there is no guarantee that past relationships will continue in the future, this is one of the \"weak links\" in traditional asset allocation strategies as derived from MPT. Other, more subtle weaknesses include seemingly minor errors in forecasting leading to recommended allocations that are grossly skewed from investment mandates and/or impractical—often even violating an investment manager's \"common sense\" understanding of a tenable portfolio-allocation strategy.\n\nAn asset class is a group of economic resources sharing similar characteristics, such as riskiness and return. There are many types of assets that may or may not be included in an asset allocation strategy.\n\nThe \"traditional\" asset classes are \"stocks\", \"bonds\", and \"cash\":\nAllocation among these three provides a starting point. Usually included are hybrid instruments such as convertible bonds and preferred stocks, counting as a mixture of bonds and stocks.\n\nOther alternative assets that may be considered include:\n\nThere are several types of asset allocation strategies based on investment goals, risk tolerance, time frames and diversification. The most common forms of asset allocation are: strategic, dynamic, tactical, and core-satellite.\n\nThe primary goal of strategic asset allocation is to create an asset mix that seeks to provide the optimal balance between expected risk and return for a long-term investment horizon. Generally speaking, strategic asset allocation strategies are agnostic to economic environments, i.e., they do not change their allocation postures relative to changing market or economic conditions.\n\nDynamic asset allocation is similar to strategic asset allocation in that portfolios are built by allocating to an asset mix that seeks to provide the optimal balance between expected risk and return for a long-term investment horizon. Like strategic allocation strategies, dynamic strategies largely retain exposure to their original asset classes; however, unlike strategic strategies, dynamic asset allocation portfolios will adjust their postures over time relative to changes in the economic environment.\n\nTactical asset allocation is a strategy in which an investor takes a more active approach that tries to position a portfolio into those assets, sectors, or individual stocks that show the most potential for perceived gains. While an original asset mix is formulated much like strategic and dynamic portfolio, tactical strategies are often traded more actively and are free to move entirely in and out of their core asset classes.\n\nCore-satellite allocation strategies generally contain a 'core' strategic element making up the most significant portion of the portfolio, while applying a dynamic or tactical 'satellite' strategy that makes up a smaller part of the portfolio. In this way, core-satellite allocation strategies are a hybrid of the strategic and dynamic/tactical allocation strategies mentioned above.\n\nIn 1986, Gary P. Brinson, L. Randolph Hood, and SEI's Gilbert L. Beebower (BHB) published a study about asset allocation of 91 large pension funds measured from 1974 to 1983. They replaced the pension funds' stock, bond, and cash selections with corresponding market indexes. The indexed quarterly return was found to be higher than the pension plan's actual quarterly return. The two quarterly return series' linear correlation was measured at 96.7%, with shared variance of 93.6%. A 1991 follow-up study by Brinson, Singer, and Beebower measured variance of 91.5%. The conclusion of the study was that replacing active choices with simple asset classes worked just as well as, if not even better than, professional pension managers. Also, a small number of asset classes was sufficient for financial planning. Financial advisors often pointed to this study to support the idea that asset allocation is more important than all other concerns, which the BHB study lumped together as\n\"market timing\". One problem with the Brinson study was that the cost factor in the two return series was not clearly discussed. However, in response to a letter to the editor, Hood noted that the returns series were gross of management fees.\n\nIn 1997, William Jahnke initiated a debate on this topic, attacking the BHB study in a paper titled \"The Asset Allocation Hoax\". The Jahnke discussion appeared in the \"Journal of Financial Planning\" as an opinion piece, not a peer reviewed article. Jahnke's main criticism, still undisputed, was that BHB's use of quarterly data dampens the impact of compounding slight portfolio disparities over time, relative to the benchmark. One could compound 2% and 2.15% quarterly over 20 years and see the sizable difference in cumulative return. However, the difference is still 15 basis points (hundredths of a percent) per quarter; the difference is one of perception, not fact.\n\nIn 2000, Ibbotson and Kaplan used five asset classes in their study \"Does Asset Allocation Policy Explain 40, 90, or 100 Percent of Performance?\" The asset classes included were large-cap US stock, small-cap US stock, non-US stock, US bonds, and cash. Ibbotson and Kaplan examined the 10-year return of 94 US balanced mutual funds versus the corresponding indexed returns. This time, after properly adjusting for the cost of running index funds, the actual returns again failed to beat index returns. The linear correlation between monthly index return series and the actual monthly actual return series was measured at 90.2%, with shared variance of 81.4%. Ibbotson concluded 1) that asset allocation explained 40% of the variation of returns across funds, and 2) that it explained virtually 100% of the level of fund returns. Gary Brinson has expressed his general agreement with the Ibbotson-Kaplan conclusions.\n\nIn both studies, it is misleading to make statements such as \"asset allocation explains 93.6% of investment return\". Even \"asset allocation explains 93.6% of quarterly performance variance\" leaves much to be desired, because the shared variance could be from pension funds' operating structure. Hood, however, rejects this interpretation on the grounds that pension plans, in particular, cannot cross-share risks and that they are explicitly singular entities, rendering shared variance irrelevant. The statistics were most helpful when used to demonstrate the similarity of the index return series and the actual return series.\n\nA 2000 paper by Meir Statman found that using the same parameters that explained BHB's 93.6% variance result, a hypothetical financial advisor with perfect foresight in \"tactical\" asset allocation performed 8.1% better per year, yet the strategic asset allocation still explained 89.4% of the variance. Thus, explaining variance does not explain performance. Statman says that strategic asset allocation is movement \"along\" the efficient frontier, whereas tactical asset allocation involves movement \"of\" the efficient frontier. A more common sense explanation of the Brinson, Hood, and Beebower study is that asset allocation explains more than 90% of the volatility of returns of an overall portfolio, but will not explain the ending results of your portfolio over long periods of time. Hood notes in his review of the material over 20 years, however, that explaining performance over time is possible with the BHB approach but was not the focus of the original paper.\n\nBekkers, Doeswijk and Lam (2009) investigate the diversification benefits for a portfolio by distinguishing ten different investment categories simultaneously in a mean-variance analysis as well as a market portfolio approach. The results suggest that real estate, commodities, and high yield add the most value to the traditional asset mix of stocks, bonds, and cash. A study with such broad coverage of asset classes has not been conducted before, not in the context of determining capital market expectations and performing a mean-variance analysis, neither in assessing the global market portfolio.\n\nDoeswijk, Lam and Swinkels (2014) argue that the portfolio of the average investor contains important information for strategic asset allocation purposes. This portfolio shows the relative value of all assets according to the market crowd, which one could interpret as a benchmark or the optimal portfolio for the average investor. The authors determine the market values of equities, private equity, real estate, high yield bonds, emerging debt, non-government bonds, government bonds, inflation linked bonds, commodities, and hedge funds. For this range of assets, they estimate the invested global market portfolio for the period 1990 to 2012. For the main asset categories equities, real estate, non-government bonds, and government bonds they extend the period to 1959 until 2012.\n\nDoeswijk, Lam and Swinkels (2019) show that the global market portfolio realizes a compounded real return of 4.45% per year with a standard deviation of 11.2% from 1960 until 2017. In the inflationary period from 1960 to 1979, the compounded real return of the global market portfolio is 3.24% per year, while this is 6.01% per year in the disinflationary period from 1980 to 2017. The average return during recessions was -1.96% per year, versus 7.72% per year during expansions. The reward for the average investor over the period 1960 to 2017 is a compounded return of 3.39% points above the risk-less rate earned by savers.\n\nMcGuigan described an examination of funds that were in the top quartile of performance during 1983 to 1993. During the second measurement period of 1993 to 2003, only 28.57% of the funds remained in the top quartile. 33.33% of the funds dropped to the second quartile. The rest of the funds dropped to the third or fourth quartile.\n\nIn fact, low cost was a more reliable indicator of performance. Bogle noted that an examination of five-year performance data of large-cap blend funds revealed that the lowest cost quartile funds had the best performance, and the highest cost quartile funds had the worst performance.\n\nIn asset allocation planning, the decision on the amount of stocks versus bonds in one's portfolio is a very important decision. Simply buying stocks without regard of a possible bear market can result in panic selling later. One's true risk tolerance can be hard to gauge until having experienced a real bear market with money invested in the market. Finding the proper balance is key.\n\nThe tables show why asset allocation is important. It determines an investor's future return, as well as the bear market burden that he or she will have to carry successfully to realize the returns.\n\nThere are various reasons why asset allocation fails to work.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2168891", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2168891", "title": "Resident Evil Outbreak: File 2", "text": "Resident Evil Outbreak: File 2\n\nResident Evil Outbreak: File #2 is a stand-alone expansion to the original \"Resident Evil Outbreak\". It was released for the PlayStation 2 in Japan on September 9, 2004; North America on April 26, 2005; and Europe on August 26, 2005.\n\nFollowing the success of \"Outbreak\" in Japan, Capcom announced \"File #2\" in late 2004. The same eight characters from the first title return with similar abilities, and the game once again takes place in a zombie-inhabited Raccoon City. Five new scenarios are available, the first four being playable from the beginning. In pre-ordered editions in Japan, the game was packaged with a demo of \"Devil May Cry 3.\"\n\nOn January 1, 2014, the servers were opened back up to the public using alternate fan servers, thus, once again allowing for online play, along with new additions to the server such as banlists and leaderboards.\n\nThe player selects a scenario, difficulty level, and a character. Each difficulty level is associated with enemies and items the player encounters as they progress through the scenario. The game has five scenarios: \"Wild Things\", \"Underbelly\", \"Flashback\", \"Desperate Times\" and \"End of the Road\".\n\nEach scenario has an event checklist consisting of special actions that the player must perform to reach 100% completion. Upon doing so the player will unlock \"Infinity Mode\" in which all the player's weapons never break or run out of ammunition.\n\nEach scenario also has \"SP\" items. These are invisible items hidden throughout the level, and are randomly generated on two paths. There are twenty scenario items for each scenario, and twenty items specific to each character hidden across the five scenarios. If acquired, these items unlock new costumes and the option to listen to character ad-libs. The game comes with two bonus scenarios, \"Elimination\" and \"Showdown\"; both are designed as training guides to boost gameplay.\n\nRather than using USB headphones or a computer keyboard, players use a command \"ad-lib\" system which consists of ten key command phrases, utilized by manipulating the right analog stick on the PlayStation 2 controller and a context-sensitive button. The player can select and request items from their teammate's inventory, or ask the teammate themselves to use the item in question. The new additions included the ad-lib phrase \"Sorry\", and context-related comments on the Map and File screens.\n\nThe sequel also boasted a new difficulty feature and some changes to the game balance. These included a new \"Nightmare Mode\" and several alterations to previous damage charts. The game also included the ability to move the player's character while in attack stance, allowing a character with a gun to move and shoot at the same time.\n\nFor the North American version of the game, the 'ad-libs' from the first game were removed. Subsequently, only when a character used the analog stick or made a request did they make a noise. If an ad-lib was attempted, no sounds were made, negatively affecting gameplay. If a player attempts to tell another that they are poisoned, the chances the message would be noticed are low if they are in the middle of combat. The Japanese release features full voices, while the European version features voices, but without text.\n\nThe Japanese version features Japanese subtitles for the cutscenes while the characters retain the use of English, as with previous \"Biohazard\" titles. Because of the character variety, this leads to a strange continuation where the Japanese subtitles read as having all the characters saying the same thing in some situations.\n\nThe minor character, \"Linda\", is called \"Rinda\" in the Japanese version. In Japan, the game ran on the KDDI MMBB service. In the United States, this service was swapped out for the Sega Network Application Package. Because of this change, several features were removed from the NTSC/PAL versions, including private messaging, advanced search options, and special options to limit the rankings to find specific ranks.\n\nOn March 31, 2007, Capcom closed their PAL and NTSC servers for \"File #2\". Online play was given a major overhaul from that of the previous game. \"File #2\" had a new lobby system, new event system, and an increase in options and modes of play.\n\nCapcom ran events from April to late May of 2005 that were sponsored by various gaming magazines. This included events from \"\" and \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\", amongst others. Clearing these events rewarded the players with characters and costumes. Some events took place in standard levels on set difficulties, while others placed the player in selected levels with Infinite and Nightmare options activated before the two options were available for free use. After all sponsored events ended, Capcom ran two events in circulation, a point bonus event and an SP item hunt.\n\nThe lobby system was revamped to include ten areas with different options in each one; however, this change made it harder to join games with friends. In order for a player to join a friend in their hosted or current game the player needed to enter a menu to search for their name, then exit that menu, choose the area they are in, and find the game. This menu did not mention the number of players in the game when searched for, meaning a game could be full before the player joined.\n\nIn early July, Capcom closed an alternate server, leaving only one choice for the player when they connected. Months after, Nightmare Mode, Infinite Mode, and changes to the Area system were made. HDD Support was dropped from the Area Screen, but players could still host games with HDD mode turned on by activating it offline.\n\nFrom within the game, or by a link on the official Capcom sales page of their United States site, players could look and see their position on the ranking boards.\n\n\"File #2\" is a continuation of the events that occur in the original \"Outbreak\", though the exact order of the scenarios is left ambiguous. Though there is no concrete \"start\" to the game, it ends with the execution of Mission Code: XX in which the government effectively nukes all of Raccoon City to eradicate the threat posed by the T-Virus.\n\nThe first scenario listed is \"Wild Things,\" in which Cindy Lennox leads the rest of the survivors to the Raccoon City Zoo in hopes of reaching a rescue helicopter on the other side of the zoo. Throughout the scenario, players are pursued by an array of animals infected by the virus, the most dangerous being the zombie elephant Oscar, who follows the players from area to area until he is either locked in the Elephant Stage or killed by the players. Should they reach the Front Plaza without killing him or locking him away, he will appear as the final boss; otherwise, the zombie lion Max will be the boss. Once the players reach the end of the stage and board the tram, the tram stops, and the rescue helicopter is shown on fire in the distance, with the pilot dying of his injuries outside of the burning helicopter.\n\nThe second scenario, \"Underbelly,\" follows the players' journey into the city's subway station, where they must find two plates[] to activate the subway train and escape. Before they can leave, however, another moving train runs into a pile of debris and explodes, awakening the \"Giga Bite,\" an enormous zombie flea, who the players later fight at the end of the stage. To initiate this fight, one of the players is kidnapped by the Giga Bite while waiting for their train to depart. After defeating the boss, if the players do not make it back to the train in time, they must find an alternate way out through the Substation Tower.\n\nIn the third scenario, \"Flashback,\" Alyssa Ashcroft leads the survivors to a cabin in the woods where they are met by Albert Lester (Also known as Al), who promises to lead them to a neighboring town. He mysteriously disappears once the players reach a bridge leading to an abandoned hospital. When the players investigate, a masked ax-wielding man chases them throughout the scenario. Players must kill sections of a giant plant that has overtaken the hospital building by injecting it with a serum-filled syringe. The final boss is the core of the plant, which is later found out to be controlled by an infected Dorothy, Al's wife, who was experimented on in the hospital. Al is shown in the ending to have been leading people to the hospital to kill them in order to feed his wife in her plant form. If the player plays through the level as Alyssa, they will experience several flashbacks at different points in the scenario, as Alyssa and a friend who died at the hands of a zombified Dorothy once investigated the hospital's ethics years ago.\n\n\"Desperate Times,\" the fourth scenario, finds the players in the Raccoon City Police Department defending themselves from zombies that have crowded outside of the station. By finding several plates, the players open a secret passage for one of the cops, Rita, to navigate and find help. Before she can return, the zombies break through the gates of the police department, and the players must defeat a certain amount (depending on which difficulty they chose) of them before completing the scenario. The players are forced to leave policeman Marvin behind as they drive away, while he locks himself in the room in which Claire or Leon (depending on whom the player chooses to be) finds him severely wounded in Resident Evil 2.\n\nIn the final scenario, \"End of the Road,\" David King leads the survivors to an Umbrella laboratory, where they are met by two scientists, Linda and Carter, who have returned to get the cure. Before they can leave, an alarm sounds, and a shutter closes the exit, which the scientists are unable to open. The lab is infested with hunters, which Carter fends off by awakening the Tyrant to fight for him. As the group is about to exit, however, the Tyrant turns on the players, killing Carter and throwing Linda from a ledge. The Tyrant then follows the players for the rest of the scenario. The players enter the sewers below the lab, where they find Linda alive. Depending on if the player whether or not killed the Tyrant, they are either washed away in the sewers with Linda or left behind to reach the upper levels themselves. Regardless, the players encounter a mutated Tyrant on the city streets. Players are given a chance to rescue Linda, who is shot by a sniper (who also shoots at the players), and must be carried by the player to the end of the stage. They can choose to escape by truck but must fight Nyx, the final boss, before doing so, or by helicopter, without fighting a final boss.\n\nAlso, in the final scenario, there are four different endings. \"Up and Away with Linda\" is obtained by escaping the city by helicopter with Linda in possession, \"Up and Away\" is obtained by escaping the city by helicopter, but letting Linda die on the way or not finding her, \"Run Like the Linda\" is obtained by escaping the city by truck with Linda in possession, and \"Run Like the Wind\" is obtained by escaping the city by truck, but letting Linda die on the way or not finding her. Obtaining the first or the third ending grants the player the Good ending and epilogue for the character chosen, and obtaining the second or the fourth ending will grant the player the Bad ending.\n\nThe game was developed by Capcom Production Studio1 over a one-year period. Although graphics did not differ greatly from its predecessor, elements of gameplay and online features were overhauled. The ability to strafe and shoot simultaneously was added. Load times were also improved. The game was released on September 9, 2004, in Japan and on April 26, 2005, in North America.\n\n\"Resident Evil Outbreak: File #2\" has been met with mixed reviews: Metacritic gave it a 58/100 and GameRankings gave it a 62.92%. A third game was planned for release (as data was found within the game's disc hinting as such) but was ultimately scrapped due to low sales of this game.\n"}

The WTBCN is one of 36 wildlife trusts covering England, and 46 covering the whole of the United Kingdom.\n\nIn 1912 Charles Rothschild formed the Society for the Promotion of Nature Reserves to protect sites considered \"worthy of preservation\". The society worked to secure statutory protection, and this began with the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949. In 1959 the society took on a coordinating role for local wildlife trusts, which covered the whole of Britain and Northern Ireland by 1978. The society changed its name to the Royal Society of Wildlife Trusts in 2004, and it operates as The Wildlife Trusts.\n\nIn 1956 the Cambridgeshire and Isle of Ely Naturalists’ Trust was founded, and it was followed by the Bedfordshire and Huntingdonshire Wildlife Trust in 1961, the Northamptonshire Wildlife Trust in 1963, and the Peterborough Wildlife Group in 1987. The Bedfordshire and Cambridgeshire trusts merged in 1990, and a further merger produced the Wildlife Trust for Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Northamptonshire and Peterborough in 1994.

The band was founded in the mid-nineties by Tommi and former member Jürgen Sachau in Helsinki Finland. Tommi and Jürgen parted ways after the release of Haltya's 2nd studio album \"Electric Help Elves\", and today Tommi records and produces Haltya mainly on his own, often with the help of other musicians, artists and producers.\nHaltya released their first studio recording on Exogenic Records in 1999 in the form of \"Project Haltya EP\", and received very good feedback and club plays from, among others, Annie Nightingale at BBC Radio One. Their debut studio album \"Forest Flavor\", which came out in 2000, was highly acclaimed by psychedelic electronic music lovers around the world, introducing a new fresh approach to sound imagination at that time. Their musical style took influences from jazz, funk, trance, house, drum n bass and all sorts of other musical directions. The result was seriously booty shaking funky forest music with sparkles on top, the trademark of Haltya.\n\nIn late 2003 Haltya released the studio EP \"Hero\", which made way for the following album \"Electric Help Elves\", released 2004. Featuring the well known Finnish horn section baabelin torvet, a remix for Hidria Spacefolk, combining new elements and live instruments to their sound. The music is groovy, blends in unconventional psytrance instruments like guitars & horns and is best described as Funky Forest Trance.\n\n\"Borboleta Purpura\", Haltya's 3rd studio EP, was released in 2007. It featured a slightly new sound direction as Tommi was influenced by having lived and playing at parties in Brazil at that time. The EP was recorded at mothership space station studios in Helsinki, the studio what would become home to numerous other side project releases incl. the double studio album for the band Headphonics, and Highpersonic Whomen's 2nd album.\n\nHaltya's 3rd studio album titled \"Book of Nature\" released in 2008, featured a more focused approach to song structure and form, alongside collaborations with other musicians and producers. Discussing the sound and process of creating this studio album, Tommi says \"it was written and recorded during my journey's around the world, having visited and produced music in so many amazing places, having met so many interesting people, this album was a global process for me.\"\n\nToday Haltya is considered to be one of the pioneers of electronic, funkedelic, and psychedelic music; as well as being a mainstay in Finnish Suomisaundi.\n\nHaltya has been heard at various parties in countries around the world during their numerous live gigs and dj sets. Aside from Finland, Haltya have played live gigs in Israel, Austria, United States, Turkey, Russia, Brazil, Germany, Denmark, Australia, Ukraine amongst other countries in the world.\n\nThe name \"Haltya\" comes from the Finnish word \"haltija\", which is for elf, or female spirit with wings. It is basically a faerie spirit, although in the old Finnish mythology \"haltija\" can be almost anything. It was believed that a person consists of many spirits, \"haltijas\".\n\n\n"}

He confessed in court to raping and killing 16 young boys between March and September 2004, and was sentenced to 100 lashes followed by execution. All the boys were between 8 and 15 years old. Additionally, he killed two adults. The murder of children around Tehran was recognized as the largest criminal case in Iran for the last 71 years, and has strongly influenced public opinion in the country.\n\nMuhammad Basjee, known as Bijeh, was born into a crowded family. He had six brothers and six half brothers. When he was four years old, his mother died of cancer. His father was a merchant who married immediately after the death of Bijeh’s mother. Bijeh never remembered his mother, but said that his father was a barbaric person. From the very childhood, he was beaten hard and chained with his legs and then beaten with his cane against his body. Even once, his father wanted to kill Bijeh with a stick.\n\nBijeh loved learning at school, but with the pressure and compulsion of his father he was forced to abandon school and work. He was 11 when he came to Khatunabad with his family, where he began working at a furnace. Revenge sparked in Bijeh's thoughts at 11, when he was sexually abused. This rape was then repeated by somebody else.\n\nHe admitted that he had been raped and wanted to take revenge on the community, and that he suffered from his mother's early death and the lack of affection suffered in childhood. Bijeh commented on his main motive for the murders: \"I suffered cruely from childhood, and when I compared my life with others, I had to commit such acts.\"\n\nHe said about his death sentence: \"I do not deserve to be sentenced to death.\" He was arrested on September 14, 2004 and tried in Branch 74 of the Tehran Penal Code under the presiding Judge Mansour Yavarzadeh Yeganeh and his four other lawyers, and by a majority of its judges and on November 27 the same year, he was sentenced to be executed. Bijeh said that if he was not arrested, he would kill 100 children. Police arrested 16 of their offices in the handling of this case, and the judiciary also announce that Pakdasht prosecutors, as well as two investigators and a prosecutor's office, had filed a \"brief\" case.\n\nOn March 16, 2005, in Pakdasht, Iran, the town near the desert area where the killings occurred, in front of a crowd of about 5,000, Bijeh's shirt was removed and he was handcuffed to an iron post, where he received his lashings from different judicial officials. He fell to the ground more than once during the punishment but did not cry out. A relative of one of the victims managed to get past security and stab Bijeh. The mother of one of the victims put a blue nylon rope around his neck, and he was hoisted about 10 meters in the air by a crane until he died.\n\n\n"}

Caribou Coffee was founded in Edina, Minnesota, in 1992. As of May 2015, the company operates 603 locations worldwide.\n\nCaribou Coffee founder, John Puckett, was working as a management consultant for Boston-based firm Bain & Company, helping develop ideas and strategies for other companies, when he decided he wanted to become an entrepreneur. After a trip to Denali National Park in Alaska, he and his wife, Kim, decided to raise money and start a coffee company. His wife stayed with a job at General Motors while John moved to Minnesota to find the first site and put together financing.\n\nThe initial concept for Caribou was a five-day-a-week schedule aimed at downtown office workers, mimicking what worked in Boston. Puckett signed a lease for the first location to be in the large Pillsbury Center office building. However, soon afterward the building's landlord decided not to sign the lease, because another of the building's retail tenants had exclusive rights to selling coffee in the building and had threatened to sue them. As a result, the financing for the store fell through because it was dependent on that specific site. Puckett opted to start looking for an available location in the suburbs, and the first Caribou Coffee shop was started in Edina, Minnesota, a suburb of Minneapolis, in December 1992.\n\nIn 2006 Arcapita (formerly known as First Islamic Investment Bank) was Caribou Coffee's majority shareholder. In 2002, Yusuf al-Qaradawi's involvement with the bank led to a protest of Caribou Coffee. That same year al-Qaradawi stepped down as chairman of the bank's Sharia Board.\n\nAs of 2009, Caribou employed more than 6,000 people.

The test marked the world's first operation of a nuclear reactor in orbit, and also the first operation of an ion thruster system in orbit. It is the only fission reactor power system launched into space by the United States. The reactor stopped working after just 43 days due to a non-nuclear electrical component failure. The Systems Nuclear Auxiliary Power Program (SNAP) reactor was specifically developed for satellite use in the 1950s and early 1960s under the supervision of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission.\n\nThe Systems for Nuclear Auxiliary Power (SNAP) program developed as a result of Project Feedback, a Rand Corporation study of reconnaissance satellites completed in 1954. As some of the proposed satellites had high power demands, some as high as a few kilowatts, the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) requested a series of nuclear power-plant studies from industry in 1951. Completed in 1952, these studies determined that nuclear power plants were technically feasible for use on satellites.\n\nIn 1955, the AEC began two parallel SNAP nuclear power projects. One, contracted out to The Martin Company, used radio-isotopic decay as the power source for its generators; these plants were given odd-numbered SNAP designations beginning with SNAP-1. The other project used nuclear reactors to generate energy, and was developed by the Atomics International Division of North American Aviation. Their systems were given even-numbered SNAP designations, the first being SNAP-2.\n\nSNAP-10A was the first Atomics International, nuclear-reactor power system built for use in space. Evolved from the SNAP-10 300 watt design, SNAP-10A fulfilled a 1961 Department of Defense requirement for a 500 watt system. \n\nMost of the systems development and reactor testing was conducted at the Santa Susana Field Laboratory, Ventura County, California using a number of specialized facilities.\n\nThe SNAP-10A has three major components – a compact nuclear reactor, the reactor reflector and control system, a heat transfer and power conversion system.\n\nThe reactor measures 39.62 cm (15.6 in) long, 22.4 cm (8.8 in) diameter and holds 37 fuel rods containing U as uranium-zirconium-hydride fuel. The SNAP-10A reactor was designed for a thermal power output of 30 kW and unshielded weighs . The reactor can be identified at the top of the SNAP-10A unit.\n\nReflectors were arranged around the outside of the reactor to provide the means to control the reactor. The reflectors were composed of a layer of beryllium, which would reflect neutrons, thus allowing the reactor to begin and maintain the fission process. The reflectors were held in place by a retaining band anchored by an explosive bolt. When the reflector was ejected from the unit, the reactor could not sustain the nuclear fission reaction and the reactor permanently shut down.\n\nThe eutectic sodium-potassium (NaK) alloy was used as a coolant in the SNAP-10A. The NaK was circulated through the core and thermoelectric converters by a liquid metal direct current conduction-type pump. The thermoelectric converters (identified as the long white \"apron\") are doped silicon germanium materials, thermally coupled, but electrically isolated from the NaK heat transfer medium. The temperature difference between the NaK on one side of the thermoelectric converter and the cold of space on the other created an electric potential and usable electricity.\n\nSNAP-10A was launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base by an ATLAS Agena D rocket on 3 April 1965 into a low Earth orbit altitude of approx. 1,300 km. It is in a slightly retrograde polar orbit\n— this ensured that the spent rocket stages landed in the ocean. Its nuclear electrical source, made up of thermoelectric elements, was intended to produce over 500 watts of electrical power for one year. After 43 days, an onboard voltage regulator within the spacecraft – unrelated to the SNAP reactor – failed, causing the reactor core to be shut down, after reaching a maximum output of 590 watts.\n\nAfter the 1965 system failure, the reactor was left in a Earth orbit for an expected duration of 4,000 years.\n\nIn November 1979 the vehicle began shedding, eventually losing 50 pieces of traceable debris. The reasons were unknown, but the cause could have been a collision. Although the main body remains in place, radioactive material may have been released. Later research, published in 2008 and based on Haystack data, suggests that there are another 60 or more pieces of debris of size <10 cm \n\nThe SNAPSHOT test included a cesium Ion thruster as a secondary payload, the first test of an electrically powered spacecraft propulsion system to operate in orbit (following the SERT-1 suborbital test in 1964). The ion-beam power supply was operated at 4500 V and 80 mA to produce a thrust of about 8.5 mN. The ion engine was to be operated off batteries for about one hour, and then the batteries were to be charged for approximately 15 hours using 0.1 kW of the nominal 0.5 kW SNAP system as the power supply. The ion engine operated for a period of less than 1 hour before being commanded off permanently. Analysis of flight data indicated a significant number of high-voltage breakdowns, and this apparently caused electromagnetic interference (EMI), causing attitude perturbations of the spacecraft. Ground tests indicated that the engine arcing produced conducted and radiated EMI significantly above design levels.\n\nThe SNAP reactor program necessitated a safety program and led to the inception of the Aerospace Nuclear Safety Program. The program was established to evaluate the nuclear hazards associated with the construction, launch, operation and disposal of SNAP systems and to develop designs to assure their radiological safety.\n\nAtomics International had primary responsibility for safety, while Sandia National Laboratories was responsible for the Aerospace Safety Independent Review and conducted many of the safety tests. Before launch was permitted, proof had to be obtained that under all circumstances the launch of the reactor would not pose a serious threat.\n\nA variety of tests were successfully completed and several videos of the development and tests are available for viewing. The Idaho National Laboratory conducted three destructive tests of SNAP nuclear reactors at Test Area North prior to the launch of SNAP-10A. The SNAPTRAN-3 destructive experiment, on 1 April 1964, simulated a rocket crash into the ocean, purposely sending radioactive debris across the Idaho desert.\n\nThe testing and development involving radioactive materials caused environmental contamination at the former Atomics International Santa Susana Field Laboratory (SSFL) facilities. The United States Department of Energy is responsible for the identification and cleanup of the radioactive contamination. (The SSFL was also used for the unrelated testing and development of rocket engines by Rocketdyne primarily for NASA.) The DOE website supporting the site cleanup details the historical development of nuclear energy at SSFL including additional SNAP testing and development information.\n\nAtomics International also developed and tested other compact nuclear reactors including the SNAP Experimental Reactor (SER), SNAP-2, SNAP-8 Developmental Reactor (SNAP8-DR) and SNAP-8 Experimental Reactor (SNAP-8ER) units at the Santa Susana Field Laboratory (see Systems for Nuclear Auxiliary Power article). Atomics International also built and operated the Sodium Reactor Experiment, the first U.S. nuclear power plant to supply electricity to a public power system.\n\n, more than 30 small fission power system nuclear reactors have been sent into space in Soviet RORSAT satellites; also, over 40 radioisotope thermoelectric generators have been used globally (principally US and USSR) on space missions.<ref name=\"nasa/doe2010\">\n</ref>\n\n\n"}

The amount of cadmium (Cd) in the alloy can be chosen so as to tune the optical absorption of the material to the desired infrared wavelength. \nCdTe is a semiconductor with a bandgap of approximately 1.5 electronvolts (eV) at room temperature. HgTe is a semimetal, which means that its bandgap energy is zero. Mixing these two substances allows one to obtain any bandgap between 0 and 1.5 eV.\n\nHgCdTe has a zincblende structure with two interpenetrating face-centered cubic lattices offset by (1/4,1/4,1/4)a in the primitive cell. The cations Cd are Hg statistically mixed on the yellow sublattice while the Te anions form the grey sublattice in the image.\n\nThe electron mobility of HgCdTe with a large Hg content is very high. Among common semiconductors used for infrared detection, only InSb and InAs surpass electron mobility of HgCdTe at room temperature.\nAt 80 K, the electron mobility of HgCdTe can be several hundred thousand cm/(V·s). Electrons also have a long ballistic length at this temperature; their mean free path can be several micrometres.\n\nThe intrinsic carrier concentration is given by \n\nformula_1\n\nwhere \"k\" is Boltzmann's constant, \"q\" is the elementary electric charge, \"t\" is the material temperature, \"x\" is the percentage of cadmium concentration, and \"E\" is the bandgap given by \n\nformula_2\n\nUsing the relationship formula_3, where λ is in µm and \"E\". is in electron volts, one can also obtain the cutoff wavelength as a function of \"x\" and \"t\":\n\nformula_4\n\nTwo types of Auger recombination affect HgCdTe: Auger 1 and Auger 7 recombination. Auger 1 recombination involves two electrons and one hole, where an electron and a hole combine and the remaining electron receives energy equal to or greater than the band gap. Auger 7 recombination is similar to Auger 1, but involves one electron and two holes.\n\nThe Auger 1 minority carrier lifetime for intrinsic (undoped) HgCdTe is given by\n\nformula_5\n\nwhere FF is the overlap integral (approximately 0.221).\n\nThe Auger 1 minority carrier lifetime for doped HgCdTe is given by \n\nformula_6\n\nwhere n is the equilibrium electron concentration.\n\nThe Auger 7 minority carrier lifetime for intrinsic HgCdTe is approximately 10 times longer than the Auger 1 minority carrier lifetime:\n\nformula_7\n\nThe Auger 7 minority carrier lifetime for doped HgCdTe is given by\n\nformula_8\n\nThe total contribution of Auger 1 and Auger 7 recombination to the minority carrier lifetime is computed as\n\nformula_9\n\nHgCdTe is a soft material due to the weak bonds Hg forms with tellurium. It is a softer material than any common III-V semiconductor. The Mohs hardness of HgTe is 1.9, CdTe is 2.9 and HgCdTe is 4. The hardness of lead salts is lower still.\n\nThe thermal conductivity of HgCdTe is low; at low cadmium concentrations it is as low as 0.2 W·Km. This means that it is unsuitable for high power devices. Although infrared light-emitting diodes and lasers have been made in HgCdTe, they must be operated cold to be efficient. The specific heat capacity is 150 J·kgK.\n\nHgCdTe is transparent in the infrared at photon energies below the energy gap. The refractive index is high, reaching nearly 4 for HgCdTe with high Hg content.\n\nHgCdTe is the only common material that can detect infrared radiation in both of the accessible atmospheric windows. These are from 3 to 5 µm (the mid-wave infrared window, abbreviated MWIR) and from 8 to 12 µm (the long-wave window, LWIR). Detection in the MWIR and LWIR windows is obtained using 30% [(HgCd)Te] and 20% [(HgCd)Te] cadmium respectively. HgCdTe can also detect in the short wave infrared SWIR atmospheric windows of 2.2 to 2.4 µm and 1.5 to 1.8 µm.\n\nHgCdTe is a common material in photodetectors of Fourier transform infrared spectrometers. This is because of the large spectral range of HgCdTe detectors and also the high quantum efficiency. It is also found in military field, remote sensing and infrared astronomy research. Military technology has depended on HgCdTe for night vision. In particular, the US air force makes extensive use of HgCdTe on all aircraft, and to equip airborne smart bombs. A variety of heat-seeking missiles are also equipped with HgCdTe detectors. HgCdTe detector arrays can also be found at most of the worlds major research telescopes including several satellites. Many HgCdTe detectors (such as \"Hawaii\" and \"NICMOS\" detectors) are named after the astronomical observatories or instruments for which they were originally developed.\n\nThe main limitation of LWIR HgCdTe-based detectors is that they need cooling to temperatures near that of liquid nitrogen (77K), to reduce noise due to thermally excited current carriers (see cooled infrared camera). MWIR HgCdTe cameras can be operated at temperatures accessible to thermoelectric coolers with a small performance penalty. Hence, HgCdTe detectors are relatively heavy compared to bolometers and require maintenance. On the other side, HgCdTe enjoys much higher speed of detection (frame rate) and is significantly more sensitive than some of its more economical competitors.\n\nHgCdTe can be used as a heterodyne detector, in which the interference between a local source and returned laser light is detected. In this case it can detect sources such as CO lasers. In heterodyne detection mode HgCdTe can be uncooled, although greater sensitivity is achieved by cooling. Photodiodes, photoconductors or photoelectromagnetic (PEM) modes can be used. A bandwidth well in excess of 1 GHz can be achieved with photodiode detectors.\n\nThe main competitors of HgCdTe are less sensitive Si-based bolometers (see uncooled infrared camera), InSb and photon-counting superconducting tunnel junction (STJ) arrays. Quantum well infrared photodetectors (QWIP), manufactured from III-V semiconductor materials such as GaAs and AlGaAs, are another possible alternative, although their theoretical performance limits are inferior to HgCdTe arrays at comparable temperatures and they require the use of complicated reflection/diffraction gratings to overcome certain polarization exclusion effects which impact array responsivity. In the future, the primary competitor to HgCdTe detectors may emerge in the form of Quantum Dot Infrared Photodetectors (QDIP), based on either a colloidal or type-II superlattice structure. Unique 3-D quantum confinement effects, combined with the unipolar (non-exciton based photoelectric behavior) nature of quantum dots could allow comparable performance to HgCdTe at significantly higher operating temperatures. Initial laboratory work has shown promising results in this regard and QDIPs may be one of the first significant nanotechnology products to emerge.\n\nIn HgCdTe, detection occurs when an infrared photon of sufficient energy kicks an electron from the valence band to the conduction band. Such an electron is collected by a suitable external readout integrated circuits (ROIC) and transformed into an electric signal. The physical mating of the HgCdTe detector array to the ROIC is often referred to as a \"focal plane array\".\n\nIn contrast, in a bolometer, light heats up a tiny piece of material. The temperature change of the bolometer results in a change in resistance which is measured and transformed into an electric signal.\n\nMercury zinc telluride has better chemical, thermal, and mechanical stability characteristics than HgCdTe. It has a steeper change of energy gap with mercury composition than HgCdTe, making compositional control harder.\n\nThe first large scale growth method was bulk recrystallization of a liquid melt. This was the main growth method from the late 1950s to the early 1970s.\n\nHighly pure and crystalline HgCdTe is fabricated by epitaxy on either CdTe or CdZnTe substrates. CdZnTe is a compound semiconductor, the lattice parameter of which can be exactly matched to that of HgCdTe. This eliminates most defects from the epilayer of HgCdTe. CdTe was developed as an alternative substrate in the '90s. It is not lattice-matched to HgCdTe, but is much cheaper, as it can be grown by epitaxy on silicon (Si) or germanium (Ge) substrates.\n\nLiquid phase epitaxy (LPE), in which a CdZnTe substrate is lowered and spinning on top of the surface of a slowly cooling liquid HgCdTe melt. This gives the best results in terms of crystalline quality, and is still a common technique of choice for industrial production.\n\nIn recent years, molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) has become widespread because of its ability to stack up layers of different alloy composition. This allows simultaneous detection at several wavelengths. Furthermore, MBE, and also MOVPE, allow growth on large area substrates such as CdTe on Si or Ge, whereas LPE does not allow such substrates to be used.\n\nThe advancement of crystal growth technology has proceeded deliberately and steadily for four decades in spite of the high vapor pressure of Hg at the melting point of HgCdTe and the known \ntoxicity of the material.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He was originally drafted by the Phoenix Coyotes and has additionally played for the Colorado Avalanche, Philadelphia Flyers and Vancouver Canucks in the National Hockey League (NHL).\n\nAfter a junior career with Jokerit's under-18 and junior teams, Väänänen was drafted by the Phoenix Coyotes in the 1998 NHL Entry Draft as their second-round pick, 43rd overall. He remained in Finland to play with Jokerit in the professional SM-liiga for two seasons, winning a silver medal with the team in 2000 as runner-up for the Kanada-malja, the SM-liiga's championship trophy. Väänänen then joined the Coyotes in 2000–01 and recorded 16 points in his rookie season. In his fourth season with the Coyotes in 2003–04, he was traded at the trade deadline to the Colorado Avalanche (along with Chris Gratton and a second-round draft choice, used to select Paul Stastny) in 2005 in exchange for Derek Morris and Keith Ballard.\n\nDue to the subsequent NHL lockout, Väänänen returned to Jokerit in 2004–05 and helped his former team to another silver medal, losing the Finnish championship to Kärpät.

However, late in the 2008–09 season, on February 27, 2009, he was placed on waivers and claimed by the Vancouver Canucks. The move by the Flyers, which also included waiving Glen Metropolit, was precipitated by the imminent return of forward Daniel Brière from injury, requiring the club to dump salary to remain under the cap.

It started life as \"Post Office Giro\" but went through several name changes, becoming \"National Giro\" then \"National Girobank\" and finally \"Girobank plc\" before being absorbed into Alliance & Leicester plc in 2003.\n\nThe organisation chalked up notable firsts. It was the first bank designed with computerised operations in mind; the first bank in Europe to adopt OCR (optical character recognition) technology; the first bank to offer interest-bearing current accounts, and the first bank in Europe to offer telephone banking, operating several years prior to the start of Midland Bank's First Direct service. It is widely credited for shaking up the UK banking market, forcing competitors to innovate and respond to the needs of the mass market.\n\nPostal Giro or Postgiro systems have a long history in European financial services. The basic concept is that of a banking system not based on cheques, but rather by direct transfer between accounts. If the accounting office is centralised, then transfers between accounts can happen simultaneously. Money could be paid in or withdrawn from the system at any post office, and later connections to the commercial banking systems were established, often by the convenience of the local bank opening its own account at the Postgiro.\n\nBy the middle of the 20th century, most countries in continental Europe had a postal giro service. The world's first post office giro banking system was established in Austria in the late 19th century by the Österreichische Postsparkasse. By the time the British Postgiro was conceived, the Dutch Postgiro was very well established with virtually every adult having a postgiro account with very large and well used postgiro operations in most other countries in Europe and Scandinavia.\n\nThe term \"bank\" was not used initially to describe the service. The banks' main payment instrument was based on the \"cheque\" (\"check\" in American English) which has a totally different remittance model from the \"Giro\".\n\nIn the banking model, cheques are written by the remitter and then handed or posted to the payee who must then visit a bank or post the cheque to his bank. The cheque must then be cleared, a complex process by which cheques are sorted once, posted to a central clearing, sorted again, and then posted back to the paying branch where the cheque is finally checked and then paid.\n\nIn the Postal Giro model Giro Transfers are sent through the post by the remitter to the Giro Centre. On receipt, the transfer is checked and the account transfer takes place. If the transfer is successful, the transfer document is sent to the recipient, together with an updated statement of account being credited. The remitter is also sent an updated statement. In the case of large utilities receiving thousands of transactions per day, statements would be sent electronically and incorporate a reference number uniquely identifying the remittance for reconciliation purposes.\n\nIn 1959 a Committee set up to investigate the \"Working of the Monetary System in the United Kingdom\" recommended the introduction of a Giro System, and if the main banks did not do this, the possibility of the Post Office introducing it should be investigated.\n\nPolitics played a part in the development of the National Giro as the British Postgiro was named. It reflected a general feeling in the Labour Movement that the banks were not meeting the mass banking needs of the British population. In the early 1960s, the majority of adults in the United Kingdom did not have a bank account and the banks did not court business from the working classes, which they regarded as unprofitable. Working-class employees would be paid weekly in cash, while those in the middle class were more likely to be salaried and paid with a bank cheque at the end of the month. Those who could afford to have a bank account could pay the cheque into the account, but even among the middle class, many had no bank account. It was common practice for cheques to be endorsed to local traders (and especially the milkman) who would know the customer and be prepared to exchange the cheque for cash.\n\nIn the 1960s, although most towns had one or more bank branches, smaller communities very often had no bank branch at all. Post Offices, on the other hand were just about in every community. There used to be about 22,000 Post Offices in the UK compared to about 3,000 bank branches. The Post Office was ideally placed to establish a viable mass banking system.\n\nThe banks also were rather secretive about their tariff structures which were never published. The Post Office would publish a tariff of charges, the key one being that transfers between accounts would be free of charge, thus encouraging the adoption of the system.\nAt a stroke the National Giro, as the service would be called, would, it was hoped, revolutionise banking in the UK.\n\nIn 1965 a White Paper \"A Post Office Giro\" was published, which outlined the system including a computerised central system for processing transactions.\n\nComputerisation, it was argued, would transform the profitability of the new system, and it was estimated that a payment between two National Giro accounts could be made in 24 hours if there was a central accounting office located at a good communications hub. This would also speed up the national bank payment clearing system based on local bank branches and centralised cheque exchange requiring cheques to be returned to local branches. This had (and to this day still has) a 3-5 day clearing cycle.\n\nThe Wilson government placed an Act before Parliament and the Post Office's central planning department and its new Computer Division began business and technical planning for the new service.\n\nBy 20 September 1965 a central site was chosen at Bootle in Lancashire. The Post Office bought land on the site of sidings of the North Mersey Branch railway. It also built a large, purpose built office and data processing complex for the site, completed in March 1968.\n\nThe National Giro was the first financial institution in Europe and possibly the world, to be established from the outset to be fully computerised. What's more, it broke new ground in Europe when it adopted optical character recognition for its transfer, inpayment and outpayment transaction documents, making it possible for the first time for utility companies and mail order companies to print their own personalised remittance slips and automate at least part of the complex accounting processes.\n\nThe early years of National Giro were unprofitable. This was hardly a surprise given that a huge amount had been invested in establishing a service infrastructure that began with zero customers. Similar types of enterprise such as the credit card operator, Barclaycard, would also take many years to begin to build a base from which to begin recouping both capital and labour costs. Nevertheless, the largely middle class press led by the \"Daily Telegraph\" and the \"Daily Mail\" were hostile to the creation of the National Giro as were the banks, which saw it as a long term threat. When a Conservative government came to power in 1970, there were pressures on the government to close the still loss making operation.\n\nThe Post Office made a strong case for adding new services that could transform the financial viability of the operation. Essentially, it proposed that it tackle both the income and expenditure side of the business.\n\n\nThe biggest change, however, took place behind the scenes. Instead of focusing on the needs of the utilities (which had by this time already adopted the Giro) and the personal banking market, National Giro would aim to capture the cash deposit business then dominated by the commercial clearing banks. The Post Office itself was a major customer of the commercial banks. It had a constant need for cash in order for it to pay out social security payments (welfare payments and pensions). Bank notes and coin had to be obtained from the banks which charged a fee for this service. The banks were also charging the depositors of these notes and coin, all of which needed to be counted before being passed on to the Post Office (which itself then had extra costs in counting the money provided by the banks. The new system was brilliantly simple. Large depositors of cash (supermarkets, petrol (gas) stations etc.) would be encouraged through pricing to pay their cash into the Post Office. Post Offices are more convenient and open longer hours so there was a natural case for choosing the Post Office. What's more, the depositor would count the money once and seal it discrete envelopes of say, units of £100, £500 or £1000. The Post Office would take the money on trust, but commit to counting it not on receipt, but within a fixed period, of say 5 days. Thus within the Post Office, money could be handled very easily and its source was clearly marked. The money would be counted at the time it was needed (i.e. when the envelope needed to be opened). Discrepancies were reported to the Giro, so that any attempt at systematic fraud could be easily identified. And the Giro could charge both the depositor for the deposit and the Post Office as an internal charge for the provision of the cash. As these charges were lower than those being charged by the commercial banks, everybody was happy. The Post Office internal handling of cash also became much simplified by the handling of fixed value envelopes.\n\nThe government accepted the plan, and after a great deal of uncertainty National Giro got its long-awaited \"Green Light\".\n\nThe new plan was a great success and provided a firm financial foundation for its operations, although at some cost to the great plan to move the country over to using the Giro for remittances instead of the banks.\n\nBy the late 1970s, one pound in every four pounds deposited in cash at a bank in the UK was deposited with the National Giro at the Post Office. This would later rise to one pound in every three. The organisation was again profitable and repaying its capital costs. Indeed, its rate of return on capital was higher than that of the commercial banks, and this allowed the government to relax the constraints it had placed on the National Giro and even allow for further capitalisation.\n\nIn 1978, National Giro renamed itself National Girobank to re-establish itself in the minds of the public as a bank, rather than some quasi non-bank. Its status as a bank had been fixed in law, but it had until now been reluctant to use the term. It also re-launched its ambition to be the People's Bank, and was the first bank to offer free banking to UK personal customers (provided the account was in credit. This included free postage for the remittance of documents to the Giro Centre as well as free cheques and deposits (the terms inpayments and outpayments were dropped).\n\nThe new campaign was a great success and at first the bank had trouble keeping up with the flow of new business it generated.\n\nLater the bank dropped the word National from its title, simply being known as Girobank plc as a prelude to privatisation.\n\nAlthough the bank gained a large number of new accounts it never reached the level of penetration achieved by the European Postgiros to enable it to become the main payment clearing system in the UK as was the dream of its creators. By the late 1980s, Girobank was Britain's sixth largest bank. The main reasons are given in the next two sections.\n\nThe term Girocheque quickly became associated with welfare dependence. Worse still, the name was often associated with Girobank in the public psyche, making little distinction between the welfare cheque and the business. Having a giro account meant writing one's own girocheques and although recipients of girocheques did not need to have (and most did not have) a giro account, girocheques issued by personal customers were sometimes viewed with suspicion by the recipient. They also carried the name and address of the issuer, making them very noticeably different from the cheques issued by other banks and noticeably similar to welfare girocheques.\n\nThis issue was rectified in the 1978 relaunch. The term girocheque was dropped in favour of the more neutral cheque. Nevertheless, the media continued to refer to Girocheques as Giros.\n\nThe commercial banks had not been slow to respond to the challenge of competing with National Giro and had developed their own credit transfer service known as Bank Giro, primarily aimed at the same utilities that the Giro had attracted. It still mainly required a visit to a bank branch and there was no free postage for the remitter.\n\nThe banks had also responded to the criticism that they were secretive about their tariffs and for the first time published a standard tariff for personal customers. They also began heavy advertising to the personal banking sector in order to capture the customers that National Giro had been forced to give up on during the period between the Green Light and the relaunch of Free Banking some seven years later. They had also adopted new services such as credit cards, personal loans and revolving credit accounts which Girobank could not easily do until it had a significant base.\n\nAlthough the Giro did offer personal loans through a third party, it did not offer many of these main services on its own behalf until after the relaunch in 1978. It added savings accounts, overdrafts, revolving credit accounts, credit and debit cards, and was instrumental in the formation of the LINK ATM consortium of smaller banks and building societies which led the commercial clearing banks to begin linking their own networks which they had hitherto refused to do. It was also quick to establish Internet banking and mass market it to its customers. So although the Girobank ended up looking much like any other bank, it was clearly nothing like the type of bank it originally expected to be, but it had also been instrumental in changing the competitive nature of the banking market in the UK and had been a great innovator.\n\nThe Alliance & Leicester Group won a bidding process for the Girobank operation in 1989 when the government decided to privatise it. The transaction was completed in 1990. By the time of the privatisation, the bank was essentially indistinguishable from its competitors apart from the fact that it used Post Offices to transact cash business. The contract with the Post Office was to continue to be an exclusive one for a fixed period after privatisation. Nowadays, the Post Office provides cash services to many banks on a commercial basis. After privatisation, the bank expanded and opened a £9.5 million operations centre in Wigan.\n\nThe personal banking business of Girobank became part of the Alliance & Leicester Building Society. The Business Banking arm continued trading under the name of Girobank as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Alliance and Leicester, being repositioning as a cash handler and credit card processor for retailers and other banks. In 2003 the Girobank brand was dropped, with the business renamed as Alliance & Leicester Commercial Bank following further consolidation in the Alliance & Leicester Group. In May 2010 Alliance & Leicester was acquired by Grupo Santander, and the name Alliance & Leicester was replaced by Santander UK.\n\nWhile the name \"Girobank\" is no longer used, the organisation lived on within the Alliance & Leicester Group. The name \"Girobank\" is, however, still used on some Giro Credits intended for paying bills, along with the Alliance & Leicester \"plus\" logo. Some councils were continuing to use the original name \"Post Office Giro\" in 2011.\n\nOn 17 March 2009, a campaign was launched to bring back Girobank.\nBackers include some MPs, trade unions and small businesses. \nIn April 2013 the Post Office announced it would be relaunching a banking service accessible through Post Office branches under the Post Office Money brand.\n\n"}

The proposal was a reaction to the Supreme Court's \"Kelo v. New London\" (2005) decision in which Souter joined the majority ruling that the U.S. Constitution allows the use of eminent domain to condemn privately owned real property for use in private economic development projects.\n\nOn March 14, 2006, a ballot initiative favoring this project was defeated by almost a three-to-one margin. Two candidates who had supported the initiative were not elected to the town's Board of Selectmen.\n\nSouter voted with the five-Justice majority in \"Kelo v. New London\", a 2005 decision in which the Court held that the Constitution does not prohibit a local government from condemning private property in order to transfer the land to a commercial developer that promises to bring in more tax revenue than the original owner, so long as such use serves a subjectively-defined \"public purpose,\" such as economic development of a \"distressed\" area. Justice John Paul Stevens wrote the majority opinion, joined by Justices Anthony Kennedy, David Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer. Justice Sandra Day O'Connor wrote the principal dissent, joined by Chief Justice William Rehnquist, and Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas. Justice Thomas also wrote a separate dissent.\n\nOn June 27, 2005, Logan Clements proposed that the Town of Weare use eminent domain to the land and farmhouse where Souter spent most of his youth, and where Souter still resided, for the purpose of constructing a hotel and restaurant on the property. Clements asserted that the Town of Weare would gain more tax revenue and economic benefits from the hotel and restaurant than it did from Souter's private residence. Clements said he would fund the hotel partly with investment capital from objectivists, libertarians, and other investors and hoped that members of prominent objectivist and libertarian groups would be regular customers.\n\nOn June 29, 2005, Travis J. I. Corcoran created an online pledge form in which potential patrons would pledge to spend at least one week at the hotel if it was constructed. Within eight days, more than 1,000 registered users had signed the pledge, and by the pledge deadline of August 29, 2005, a total of 1,418 people had signed. Clements and his staff maintained that they were serious about building the hotel if it gained enough public interest and financial support. \n\nA local group, the Committee for the Protection of Natural Rights, proposed a measure which, if adopted by popular vote, would provide for Souter's house and land to be taken for the construction of an Inn. The measure would create two trusts to fund the hotel project, one to cover legal expenses and another to hold donations to provide \"just compensation\" for Souter's property. Clements announced an effort to add the proposal to the agenda of the Weare town meeting, and in late August, NPR and ABC reported he had managed to gain the 25 signatures required to place it on the ballot. Clements pursued financing and public relations efforts in support of the project. Supporters of the initiative held a rally in Weare on January 21 and 22, 2006, attended by supporters from as far away as Washington State and Texas, and supported of hotel backer Joshua Solomon's candidacy for election to the Weare Board of Selectmen in March 2006. Supporters also canvassed voters door-to-door in Weare and spread word of the ballot initiative. The effort received local, state, and national media attention.\n\nOn February 4, 2006, voters who gathered for the meeting portion of the town's annual election process voted to change the article's wording. The new text simply called upon the state legislature to oppose the taking of private property for use by private development, as some argued the \"Kelo\" decision now allowed. The voice vote was unanimous, although some supporters of the hotel concept later said they were upset by the vote. Under New Hampshire's town election system, any town resident who attends this annual meeting may amend warrant articles, including ones submitted by petition. Clements later condemned this procedure as undemocratic.\n\nWeare voters passed this newly worded article as it appeared on the town ballot when they went to the polls on March 14, 2006. Two candidates for selectman who supported the hotel and were founding members of the Committee for the Protection of Natural Rights were defeated for election.\n\nProfessor Randy Barnett, a lawyer and senior fellow at the Cato Institute who opposed \"Kelo\", found the proposal amusing at first, facetiously calling the hotel an \"excellent public purpose\", but rejected the idea when he found out people were taking it seriously, stating: \"Retaliating against a judge ... violates the holding of \"Kelo\" itself, for the \"intent\" would be to take from A to give to B, in this case to punish A.\" \n\nProfessor Eugene Volokh categorized Clements' actions as political speech protected by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. However, he criticized the hotel proposal itself, on the grounds that \"we shouldn't seriously want government agencies to retaliate against government officials by seizing their property.\" \n\nNew Hampshire's Republican state representative from Weare, Neal Kurk, saw the hotel plans as \"poetic justice\", as he opposed \"Kelo\", but he hopes that \"Justice Souter's property will be protected by the good sense of New Hampshire townspeople.\" \nSterling Burnett, senior fellow at the National Center for Policy Analysis, stated that he thought approval of the proposal would be \"sweet justice\", saying: \"It shows how the sanctity of peoples' homes now exists solely at the whim of local politicians.\" \nEditors of the Missoulian said they \"like[d]\" the proposal and that it would \"be amusing to turn the tables on those who undermine the rights of citizens\", but point out: \"Based on our reading of the Supreme Court's majority opinion in the property-rights case, it takes more than a simple good idea to take someone's home away.\" \n\nAir America Radio commentator Rachel Maddow, appearing on Tucker Carlson's MSNBC \"Situation\" program, dismissed the proposal as a \"creepy\" publicity stunt.\nOne Weare area newspaper praised the Board of Selectmen for its handling of the Clements proposal, noting that it was \"impossible for them to act on it because it had not gone through proper channels.\" \n\n"}

They were active between 1966 and 1969 and closely linked to the Ulster Constitution Defence Committee (UCDC) and Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF), established by Ian Paisley and Noel Doherty in 1966.\n\nThe organisation's inaugural meeting took place in Belfast's Ulster Hall, which would later become the UCDC. Their first incidents quickly followed.\n\nIn the spring of 1966, members bombed an all-girls primary school in Ardoyne, where talks to better relations between Protestants and Catholics were to take place. In May of that year they had their first kill in Shankill, although it was unintentional. The victim was 70-year-old Matilda Gould, a Protestant who the volunteers mistook for the Catholic living next door. Shortly after this, the UVF and UPV took part in the killings of two Catholic men not far from the scene of the first attack. Following the 1967 trial of the UVF's leader Gusty Spence, the two groups were classified as illegal organizations.\n\nIn the spring of 1969, the UPV took part in a bombing campaign across Belfast. The series of bombings took place on 30 March, 4 April, 20 April, 24 and 26 April. These attacks targeted electricity substations that would remove power from the east and south parts of Belfast. Other attacks targeted the water supply. A separate bombing was also planned to target a hydroelectric plant in Ballyshannon. As a result, Irish troops moved toward the border alongside ambulances, and British troops moved into the area as well. The UPV was also involved in the RTE Studio bombing on 5 August 1969.\n\nShortly after the failed attack in Ballyshannon, a message was issued by the groups:\"We wish to state that an active service unit from Northern Ireland was dispatched to undertake this task. So long as the threats from Éire continue, so long will the Volunteers of Ulster’s People’s Army strike at targets in Southern Ireland.\"Several attacks followed, including ones in Bodenstown and Dublin.\n\n"}
{"id": "2168964", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2168964", "title": "Ulster Constitution Defence Committee", "text": "Ulster Constitution Defence Committee\n\nThe Ulster Constitution Defence Committee (UCDC) was established in Northern Ireland in April 1966. The UCDC was the governing body of the loyalist Ulster Protestant Volunteers (UPV). The UCDC coordinated parades, counter demonstrations, and paramilitary activities, in order to maintain the status quo of the government, lead a campaign against the reforms of Terence O'Neill, and stymie the civil rights movement.\n\nThe fourth Prime Minister of Northern Ireland, Terence O'Neill, who began his term in 1963, was trying to modernize industry to stave off an economic depression. This modernization brought foreign industry to Northern Ireland and threatened the Protestant, Unionist, power base. The Unionists held 90 percent of the jobs but foreign industries were hiring Catholics, thus reducing the strength of the Protestants. In 1965, Terence O'Neill also invited and met with Sean Lemass, the Prime Minister of the Republic of Ireland, to promote economic cooperation. The Unionists regarded the Republic of Ireland as the enemy and a report from Brian McConnell, the Home Affairs Minister, said there was a new IRA campaign of subversion.\n\nIan Paisley, a fundamentalist Presbyterian who was politically active, joined the Orange Order and supported the Unionist Party platform. The fundamentalists were associated with 'traditional Unionism,' that supported the Protestant power base with its advantages in jobs, housing, and political power. The ecumenical, liberal movement within Protestantism was thought to be aligning with the political elite and with the Catholics, thereby threatening the advantages enjoyed by working-class Protestants. Ian Paisley's attempt to put four candidates into an election ended up with him withdrawing them when he identified the need for an electoral machine to obtain votes in the Westminster general election.(Boulton 34)\n\nNoel Doherty, a member of Ian Paisley's Free Presbyterian Church of Ulster since 1956, was also a printer who with Paisley formed the Puritan Printing Company and created the first edition of the \"Protestant Telegraph\" in May 1966. Doherty was a great admirer or Gusty Spence, a member of the Ulster Protestant Action. Spence was a much harder character who recreated the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) in March 1966, just prior to the creation of the UCDC. Doherty would propose the political vehicle Ian Paisley needed but Doherty's motives were more aligned with Spence than with Paisley. Doherty used his position of trust with Paisley and began to organise a network of the 'Ulster Protestant Volunteer Corps' about two months prior to the creation of the UCDC.\n\nIan Paisley met with fellow loyalists including Noel Doherty in April 1966, when he discussed a proposal by Doherty to create the Ulster Constitution Defence Committee. Paisley was made the Chairman and a \"12-man united society of Protestant patriots pledged by all lawful methods to uphold and maintain the constitution of Northern Ireland\" (also known as \"the 12 disciples\") was created. Doherty was made the Secretary.(Boulton 34-36)\n\nThe public debut of the UCDC took place on the Shankill Road (West Belfast) on 17 April 1966, in the form of a parade led by Ian Paisley and Noel Doherty. Members of both Doherty's and Spence's newly created organizations participated in the parade and were publicly thanked by Paisley.\n\nIn May 1966, the UCDC decided to organize Doherty's Ulster Protestant Volunteers (UPV), which was a loyalist paramilitary group, into local branches, which were called divisions. The UPV was under the governance of the UCDC, binding it by a constitution which condemned illegal violence.(Boulton 38). Only Protestants were allowed to join and Roman Catholics along with members of the RUC were automatically excluded.\n\nNoel Doherty made it difficult to separate the activities of the UCDC/UPV from the activities of the UVF. He asked members of the UVF and the Armagh Free Presbyterian Church to attend a meeting where the Loughgall division of the UPV would be created. During the meeting both guns and gelignite were discussed, along with reprisals against the IRA. Doherty chaired the meeting but Ian Paisley was not there, and later denied any knowledge, which was supported by Doherty.\n\nDespite the UCDC's disassociation with violence and illegal activities, divisions of the UPV under control of the UCDC were linked with petrol bomb attacks on Catholic schools, shops, bars and homes in the Spring of 1966.(Coogan 49,50) The Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) investigated. Five of these attacks were in April and the 1st week of May.\n\nNoel Doherty facilitated the Loughgall division of the UPV and Gusty Spence's Shankill Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) working together.(Boulton 41) Doherty introduced a quarryman who supplied the explosive, gelignite and detonators to members of the UVF. (Boulton 42)\n\nPaisley organized a picket against a liberal church parade on 6 April 1966. He felt that the church supported Terrence O'Neill's political viewpoint which Paisley opposed. The parade went through a catholic area and a riot broke out (the Presbyterian General Assembly riot). Four policemen were badly injured which began an open hostility between the RUC and Paisley. The Orange Order, the liberal Presbyterian Church and official unionism disassociated themselves from Paisley and said his organizations \"represent a defiance of lawful authority no less serious in essence than that of the IRA.\"\n\nA murder outside a bar known as the Malvern Arms was investigated and the UCDC, led by Ian Paisley was implicated but he denied any knowledge. Gusty Spence, Hugh McClean and Robert Williamson from the UVF, shot four barmen they presumed were IRA men. Off duty RUC men were in the back room of the bar and arrests were made. The three gunmen were convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment.\n\nTerrence O'Neill banned the UVF under the Civil Authorities (Special Powers) Act of 1932. The UCDC and the UPV were not banned but O'Neill made many attempts to tie the organizations together, implying that Ian Paisley was the leader. Ian Paisley denied any connection with the UVF. He and James McConnell, the vice-chairman of the UCDC, expelled Doherty from the UCDC.(Boulton 54) Four days after the murder conviction, Noel Doherty was sentenced to two years on an explosive charge. The quarryman who supplied the explosives, Jim Marshall was fined £200.\n\nIan Paisley was sent to jail on 19 July 1966 for refusing to sign a pledge of good behaviour after the Presbyterian General Assembly Riot. As a result, protests, parades and riots ensued. On Paisley's release on 19 October, his supporters celebrated all over Protestant Belfast. A public opinion poll indicated that 200,000 of Ulster's million Protestants considered themselves as potential Paisley supporters.\n\nEarly clashes between Catholics and Protestants were reported on 7 March 1967.\n\nThe Northern Ireland civil rights movement was founded in February, 1967. It was made up from three distinct social groups: the Catholic middle class; the students of Queen's University; and the working class in the Catholic ghettos. It also included the remnants of the old IRA. The Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association (NICRA), chaired by Mrs. Betty Sinclair was slow starting. When it did start marching, the result was bloody clashes with the various Protestant organizations. (Boulton 66-67)\n\nThe first civil rights march was scheduled for August 24, 1968. It was supposed to proceed from Coalisland to Dungannon by going through Market Square and the town centre. The UCDC/UPC convinced the police to re-route the march through the Catholic part of town. The marchers were met at the outskirts of Dungannon by the police and a large group made up mainly by the Ulster Protestant Volunteers. The police managed to keep both groups apart but were abused by both sides. At the conclusion of the demonstration, the executives of the UCDC thanked the UPV members for their support and stated that, \"The policy of the UCDC, through the UPC, has been and will continue to be to confront the enemy at every opportunity.\" (Boulton 69)\n\nThe next civil rights march was banned as it was supposed to parade through part of Derry within the city walls. This was considered 'sacred' ground by the Protestants and not only the UPV but by all the unionists and the police. The marchers ignored the order and were confronted by the RUC riot squad where 90 marchers and 18 police were injured.\n\"Meanwhile, students at Queens University here announced they would hold a rally of about 1,500 people to protest reported police brutality. A rival meeting was planned by the Ulster (Northern Ireland) Constitution Defense Committee.\"\n\nAnother NICRA demonstration in Belfast on 9 October 1968 was blocked by a crowd led by Ian Paisley. Derry was the site of numerous other civil rights marches and counter marches by the UCDC/UPV. The battles were having a political impact and Terrence O'Neill was a central figure in supporting the reforms to try and control the situation between the civil rights groups and the UCDC/UPV along with other Protestant groups.\n\nThe UCDC was used to lead the campaign against the reforms of the Prime Minister of Northern Ireland, Terence O'Neill, in the late 1960s.(Coogan 51)\n\nThe reforms requested were as follows:\n\nO'Neill proposed reforms that resembled those requested but the proposal toned down the requests leaving neither side satisfied.

{"id": "2168966", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2168966", "title": "Distinctive feature", "text": "Distinctive feature\n\nIn linguistics, a distinctive feature is the most basic unit of phonological structure that may be analyzed in phonological theory.\n\nDistinctive features are grouped into categories according to the natural classes of segments they describe: major class features, laryngeal features, manner features, and place features. These feature categories in turn are further specified on the basis of the phonetic properties of the segments in question.\n\nSince the inception of the phonological analysis of distinctive features in the 1950s, features traditionally have been specified by binary values to signify whether a segment is described by the feature; a positive value, [+], denotes the presence of a feature, while a negative value, [−], indicates its absence. In addition, a phoneme may be unmarked with respect to a feature. It is also possible for certain phonemes to have different features across languages. For example, could be classified as a continuant or not in a given language depending on how it patterns with other consonants.\n\nIn recent developments to the theory of distinctive features, phonologists have proposed the existence of single-valued features. These features, called univalent or privative features, can only describe the classes of segments that are said to possess those features, and not the classes that are without them.\n\nThis section lists and describes the features.\n\nMajor class features: The features that represent the major classes of sounds.\n\nLaryngeal features: The features that specify the glottal states of sounds.\n\nManner features: The features that specify the manner of articulation.\n\nPlace features: The features that specify the place of articulation.\n\nVowels are distinguished by \n\nHowever, laryngoscopic studies suggest the features are\n\nThis system is given by .\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe concept of a distinctive feature matrix to distinguish similar elements is identified with phonology, but there have been at least two efforts to use a distinctive feature matrix in related fields. Close to phonology, and clearly acknowledging its debt to phonology, distinctive features have been used to describe and differentiate handshapes in fingerspelling in American Sign Language. Distinctive features have also been used to distinguish proverbs from other types of language such as slogans, clichés, and aphorisms.\n\nAnalogous feature systems are also used throughout Natural Language Processing (NLP). For example, part-of-speech tagging divides words into categories. These include \"major\" categories such as Noun vs. Verb, but also other dimensions such as person and number, plurality, tense, and others. Some mnemonics for part-of-speech tags conjoin multiple features, such as \"NN\" for singular noun, vs. \"NNS\" for plural noun, vs. \"NNS$\" for plural possessive noun (see Brown Corpus). Others provide more explicit separation of features, even formalizing them via markup such as the Text Encoding Initiative's feature structures. Modern statistical NLP uses vectors of very many features, although many of those features are not formally \"distinctive\" in the sense described here.\n\n\n"}

The report expressed concerns because of the apparent conflict of interest between agent Craig Allardyce, his father Sam Allardyce – and the club itself.\n\nAl-Habsi did not make any first team appearances in his first year at Bolton. Al-Habsi made his full Bolton debut in the 2–1 extra time League Cup victory over Fulham in September 2007.\n\nAl-Habsi then went on to make a further 15 appearances during the course of the 2007/08 season, most notably his performance against Bayern Munich in the UEFA Cup against whom he produced several good saves against the star studded German team. He made his first Premier League start against Wigan Athletic. In December 2008, he was rewarded for his work with an extension to his contract until 2013. Despite this, Al-Habsi lost his place when Jussi Jääskeläinen returned from injury.\n\nIn July 2010, Al-Habsi joined local rivals Wigan Athletic on a season-long loan. He made his debut on 24 August 2010 in a League Cup match against Hartlepool United and made his League debut four days later against Tottenham Hotspur. He was named Wigan's player of the season for the 2010–11 season.\n\nOn 4 July 2011 Al-Habsi joined the club permanently, signing a four-year contract for an estimated £4 million transfer fee from Bolton.\nAl-Habsi established himself as an outstanding penalty saver, saving approximately 50% of all the penalties he faced since joining Wigan. Robin van Persie, Carlos Tevez, Javier Hernández and Mikel Arteta are among the penalty takers Al-Habsi has stopped. This earnt him links to Liverpool and Arsenal. During the back end of the 2012–13 season, Al-Habsi was dropped to the bench as his position as Wigan's number one was threatened by the arrival of the athletic, young Spaniard Joel Robles on loan. Al-Habsi started Wigan's FA Cup semi-final win over Millwall but was on the bench for the final itself. Shortly after the final Wigan were relegated back to the championship.\n\nOn 31 October 2014, Al-Habsi signed for fellow Championship side Brighton & Hove Albion on a one-month loan. After playing only one game for the club, Al-Habsi returned to his parent club Wigan.\n\nFollowing his release from Wigan Athletic, Al-Habsi went on trial with Reading in July 2015. This ended in Al-Habsi signing a two-year contract with the club on 14 July 2015. On 5 January 2017, Al-Habsi extended his contract with Reading until the end of the 2018–19 season.\n\nOn 17 March 2017, Al-Habsi made several crucial saves in a 2–0 victory against playoff rivals Sheffield Wednesday. This performance and others throughout the season saw Al-Habsi named in the EFL Championship team of the season and awarded the Reading player of the season award.\n\nOn 17 July 2017, Al-Habsi moved to Al-Hilal for an undisclosed fee, signing a three-year contract.\n\nOn 29 August 2019, Al-Habsi moved to Championship side West Bromwich Albion on a free transfer, signing a deal until the end of the season with the West Midlands club.\n\nAl-Habsi began playing in his native country Oman at the age of seventeen, and joined the ranks of the Oman under-19s squad, before he was spotted by John Burridge in 2001. Due to the difficulty of securing a work permit, he was unable to move to Europe at this early stage of his career.\n\nHe was called up for Oman, and played in all of their three group matches at the 2004 AFC Asian Cup in China and also made four appearances for the team in their qualifying campaign for the 2006 FIFA World Cup, which they exited in the first group stage after finishing second in a group with Japan, India and Singapore. He was also Oman's first-choice goalkeeper at the 2007 AFC Asian Cup, appearing in all of their three group matches.\n\nAl-Habsi also has appeared as main keeper in four consecutive Arabian Gulf Cups. In each tournament he earned the award for best goalkeeper, most recently at the 19th Arabian Gulf Cup. He kept a clean sheet throughout the 2009 tournament that Oman eventually won.

{"id": "2168969", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2168969", "title": "Dubble Bubble", "text": "Dubble Bubble\n\nDubble Bubble is a brand of pink-colored bubble gum invented by Walter Diemer, an accountant at Philadelphia-based Fleer Chewing Gum Company in 1928. One of Diemer’s hobbies was concocting recipes for chewing gum based on the original Fleer ingredients. Though founder Frank Fleer had come up with his own bubble gum recipe in 1906, it was shelved due to its being too sticky and breaking apart too easily. It would be another 20 years until Diemer would use the original idea as inspiration for his invention.\n\nFleer Chewing Gum Company, in Philadelphia, had been searching for years to produce a formula that allowed bubbles to be blown that did not stick. In 1928, while Walter Diemer was testing new gum recipes, he noticed that his product was less sticky than regular chewing gum, and after testing it he found that he could create bubbles easily. After a year of attempts, he made the first successful batch of bubble gum. But the next morning when trying to recreate his successful concoction, he failed to reproduce the same results. After four months of trying to mimic his first success, he finally made a 300-pound batch of what would become Dubble Bubble. The only food coloring available at the factory was pink, so Diemer had no choice but to use it, and the color would go on to become the standard for gum for the world over. Using a salt water taffy wrapping machine, Diemer decided to individually wrap 100 pieces and brought the stock to a local candy store. The gum was priced at one penny apiece and sold out in one day. Before long, the Fleer Chewing Gum Company began making bubble gum using Diemer’s recipe, and the gum was marketed as “Dubble Bubble” gum. Diemer’s bubble gum was the first-ever commercially sold bubble gum, and its sales surpassed 1.5 million dollars in the first year. To help sell the new bubble gum, Diemer himself taught salespeople how to blow bubbles so that they in turn could teach potential customers.\n\nThe original gum featured a color comic strip, known as the Fleer Funnies, which was included with the gum. The featured characters, ‘Dub and Bub’, were introduced in 1930 but were replaced by the iconic Pud and his pals in 1950. Originally, Pud was much more rotund than the slimmed down version seen in the 1960s. The early comics were especially large and colorful. The comic also included Fleer Fortunes and Dubble Bubble Facts. The comics were sequentially numbered which made collecting them easy. They are not dated though, so it is difficult to know the exact year of release. By the late 1950s and early 1960s, Fleer Funnies shrank to the small size most people remember. More than 1,002 comics have been released over the years. During World War II, Dubble Bubble was distributed to the military. Sugar and latex became scarce due to the war and bubble gum manufacturing was halted in 1942. In 1951, Fleer resumed manufacturing of Dubble Bubble and the popularity of its gum grew steadily. Over time, Fleer extended its reach by adding new flavors and new formats like ball gum and expanded distribution of its products overseas. In 1957, Fleer introduced the first gum 6-pack with Dubble Bubble. In 1998, Dubble Bubble was purchased by Concord Confections and in 1999 they introduced Dubble Bubble as a gumball. In 2003, Tootsie Roll Industries acquired Concord. Since Concord's acquisition, Dubble Bubble has since used a different recipe and also discontinued the comic strips and fortunes on the wrappers, but continued to use Pud as its mascot.\n\nThe main ingredients in Dubble Bubble gum are Sugar, Dextrose, Corn Syrup, Gum Base, Tapioca Dextrin, Titanium Dioxide, Confectioner's Glaze, Carnauba Wax, Corn Starch, Artificial Flavors, Artificial Colors, (FD&C Red 40, Blue 1, Yellow 5, Yellow 6, Red 3), and BHT (to maintain freshness).\n\nThe ingredients of \"1928 Original\" Dubble Bubble gum are Sugar, Dextrose, Corn Syrup, Gum Base, High Fructose Corn Syrup, Artificial Flavor, Colour, Corn Starch and BHT.\n\nDubble Bubble gum products are nut-free, gluten-free, peanut-free and kosher.\n\nDubble Bubble twist gummies is a 6 g, bite-size piece of chewing gum containing 20 calories with 0 g of fat, 0 mg of cholesterol, 5 mg of sodium, 5 g of carbohydrates, 0 g of dietary fiber, 4 g of sugar and 0 g of protein.

It is an offshoot of Warka dynasty. It takes its name from the Yiddish name of Mszczonów, a town in Poland.\n\nThe first Amshinover Rebbe, Rabbi Yaakov Dovid Kalish, was a son of Rabbi Israel Yitzhak Kalish (Yitzchok of Vurka), the (first) Vurker Rebbe.\n\nRabbi Yitzchok of Warka () was a disciple of Grand Rabbi Dovid Biderman of Lelov (1746–1814), who was a disciple of the \"Seer of Lublin\", who was a disciple of Rabbi Elimelech of Lizhensk, who was a disciple of Rabbi Dovber of Mezeritch (the \"Maggid\"), the senior disciple of Rabbi Yisroel ben Eliezer (The Baal Shem Tov), the founder of Hasidism. After the death of Rabbi Dovid Biderman of Lelov, Rabbi Yitzchok became a disciple of Rabbi Simcha Bunim of Peshischa.\n\nRabbi Yaakov Dovid died in 1878 (ד' כסלו תרל\"ח) and was succeeded as Amshinover Rebbe by one of his sons, Menachem Kalish.\n\nWhen Rabbi Menachem died in 1917 (ט\"ז כסלו תרע\"ח), his son, Rabbi Yosef, became the Rebbe in Amshinov, and the other son, Rabbi Shimon Sholom, became rebbe in Otwock ( \"Otvotsk\"). Rabbi Shimon was a major driving force behind the exodus of thousands of young men in Kletzk, Radin, Novhardok, and other yeshivas via Japan to Shanghai at the outbreak of World War II. By the time Shanghai came under Japanese control, it held 26,000 Jews.\n\nRabbi Yerachmiel Yehuda Myer Kalish (1901–1976) of Amshinov, a son of Rabbi Shimon Sholom, was born in Przysucha ( \"Pshiskhe\"), Poland. He studied Torah with his grandfather, Rabbi Menachem of Amshinov.\n\nAfter the war, Rabbi Shimon moved to the United States. Upon his death in 1954 (י\"ט אב תשי\"ד), Rabbi Myer accompanied Rabbi Shimon's body to Tiberias in Israel, and remained there. Rabbi Myer later moved to Tel Aviv, and then to the Bayit Vegan neighbourhood of Jerusalem. Rabbi Myer was noted for his greatness in Torah scholarship, as well as his warmth and sensitivity to all.\n\nRabbi Yaakov Aryeh Yeshia Milikowsky was born in the United States. He is the present Amshinover Rebbe in the Bayit Vegan section of Jerusalem. He is the grandson and successor of Rabbi Yerachmiel Yehudah Meir Kalish of Amshinov, son of Rabbi Chaim and Rebbetzin Chayah Nechamah Milikowsky, daughter of Rabbi Yerachmiel Yehudah Meir Kalish.\n\nHe prays for hours on end, meditating on every word, as a result of which he ends the Sabbath very late. Once an \"adam gadol\", a very learned man, discussed the Halachic implications of the Rebbe's zmanim with the late Rav Shlomo Zalman Auerbach. Reb Shlomo Zalman referred to the Rebbe as a \"Pillar of Fire\" and advised his questioner that one who touches fire will be burnt. The Rebbe is also the mentor of the famous Hasidic preacher, R. Tzvi Maier Zilberberg who considers himself an Amshinov chassid. The renowned rabbi, Reb Yitzchok \"Itche\" Myer Morgenstern, the rosh yeshiva of \"Yeshivas Toras Chochom\" considers the Amshinov Rebbe the \"Tzadik HaDor.\"\n\nThe Amshinover Rebbe is widely known within the Haredi world, and is regarded within Hassidic circles for his exceptional Ahavas Yisroel, love of every Jew; In the present generation the Rebbe himself is considered a \"pillar of tefillah\" and davens for hours on end.\n\nIn 2015 the rebbe founded a new organization called ≤www.amshinov.org≥ Tzedaka V'chesed Amshinov as a charity in memory of Rebbe Meir Ba'al HaNes.\n\nThe Rebbe is also known for his outstanding advice in medical matters. HaRav Meier Bransdorfer, z\"l advised the Rebbeim of \"A Time\" to consult with the Amshinov Rebbe – \"a eish gadol meod\" regarding complicated medical shailas.

The first settlements began around 1800 and developed around factories, harbours, or other local businesses. The larger of these rural communities were Clarkson, Cooksville, Erindale, Meadowdale, Malton, Port Credit and Streetsville.\n\nMany smaller villages also sprung up near the larger towns. These include Barberton, Britannia, Burnhamthorpe, Derry West, Elmbank, Frogmore, Hanlan, Harris’ Corners, Hawkins’ Corners, Lisgar, Lorne Park, Mount Charles, Palestine, Pucky's Huddle, Sheridan and Summerville. The villages prospered until the arrival of the railroads in the late 19th century. The rise of the Industrial age prompted rapid urban growth and a steady economic and population decline in many rural Ontario communities. By 1915 most of the villages, now referred to as the \"lost villages\" of Mississauga, disappeared. Except for a few cemeteries, little is left to record their existence.\n\nLorne Park shares a common history with Clarkson. Before the arrival of the Europeans, all the land in Toronto Township belonged to the Mississauga Indians. The first white settler in the Clarkson-Lorne Park area was Thomas Ingersoll, who established the Government Inn and trading post on the Credit River in 1798.\n\nOn August 2, 1805, the Mississauga Indians sold the British Government the Mississauga Tract, which ran from the Etobicoke Creek to Burlington Bay. The area included of shoreline and extended inland. Out of this land deal Toronto Township was established and many small communities quickly developed. Clarkson and the area that would become Lorne Park were founded along the shores of Lake Ontario.\n\nIn 1820, a log road was built from the mouth of the Credit River to the Humber River, followed shortly by a bridge that enabled travelers going from York to Hamilton to pass through Clarkson and attracted more settlers. By the 1830 logging was a major industry in Lorne Park. Most of the pine wood was exported to England and the United States.\n\nOver the early part of the 20th century Lorne Park grew into a unique community. In 1887, Joseph Thompson bought of land in Lorne Park which became known as Thompson's Wood, now called Jack Darling Park. Thompson's brother Ernest Seton lived there until the home was lost in foreclosure. Ernest left, changed his name to Ernest Thompson Seton and achieved fame as an author and artist.\nThe Lorne Park Post Office opened in 1892 and George D. Perry was the village's first postmaster. James Alberton built the three-story Albertonia Hotel in 1899. In 1927, it was renamed the Lorne Park Lodge but burned down two years later in 1929.\n\nThe Lorne Park Mission Hall was built in 1902. It featured an open porch and a bell tower on the roof. The first library was organized by sawmill owner Robert Taylor in 1903. The first library meeting was held in January, 1904, in the Lorne Park Mission Hall. Reverend H. Thompson officiated over the first Anglican services in 1906, also held at the Lorne Park Mission Hall. St. Paul's Anglican Church was built in 1914. The Lorne Park Baptist Church was founded Sunday, May 18, 1919, in the Lorne Park Mission, with Reverend J. Williamson presiding.\n\nAt some point a \"pleasure grounds,\" was operated in Lorne Park by the Toronto Park Association, included separate parlours for men and women, bowling lanes and merry-go-rounds. Travel to the resort from Toronto was often by steamer. After a series of bankruptcies, the resort lands were sold to cottagers. With access of the QEW highway, suburbanization of the original lands and surrounding area ensued in the post WWII period. (Brown, 1997 Toronto's Lost Villages)\n\nFor the next half century, Lorne Park remained a small burg, until 1968 when it, along with several other villages, was amalgamated to form the town of Mississauga. Six years later, Mississauga was incorporated and now is Canada's 6th largest city. Even though Lorne Park was absorbed into Mississauga, it remained a distinct neighborhood that retains ties to its pioneer origins.\n\nLorne Park Estates is a community, south of Lorne Park, located within the City of Mississauga. It is bordered by Lake Ontario on the south, Lakeshore Road on the north, Jack Darling Park on the west and Richard's Memorial Park on the East. Lorne park, is the closest commercial service area for residents of Lorne Park Estates.\n\nLPEA Homeowners are responsible for municipal taxes and upkeep of the LPEA lands, and are also co-operatively responsible for the maintenance, insurance and taxes on their reserve; including their roads, forests, walking trails, a cottage, a private park and amenities area (the 'Commons') and their of private beaches with riparian rights.\n\nThere are only 2 roads into Lorne Park Estates and they are clearly marked as \"private\" as they are dually privately maintained and privately owned by the Lorne Park Estates Association. These private roads are for the exclusive use of only the residents within the estates, and their invited guests. These privately maintained roads in the community are narrow, uncurbed and with no sidewalks as this is the common preference of their exclusive community.\n\nThe Lorne Park is commonly thought to be named after John Campbell, 9th Duke of Argyll, better known by the courtesy title Marquess of Lorne. However, this is conjecture, as the park was already titled Lorne before he became Governor General, the aetiology of the name Lorne remains a cryptic enigma. The Marquis also was not in attendance at the opening of the park in 1879: The Marquis was in Montreal officiating an investiture ceremony knighting members into the Queen's privy counsel commissioning the official opening of the Beaux Arts Museum that Victoria Day weekend in 1879. Historically the community, and the parklands have seen many changes. The land, first occupied by the Mississaugas, was transferred with larger land portion through Treaty No. 13 to Governor John Graves Simcoe in 1805. The land, which housed a significant stand of pines, was slated to be used for its wood as resources for the British Empire. However, this was not required and the land remained intact and became a subject of interest. First by individuals of the British military who wished to settle, and then by sundry businessmen and investors. Its legal ownership started 1832, ultimately resulting in the owners admirably taking charge of their community. Currently, Lorne Park Estate owners have Canada Postal Service, garbage and water service alliance with the City of Mississauga, homes were electrically heated still into the 1980s, when a gas line deal was brokered with Union Gas. Roads, parks and sewage are handled by the Lorne Park Estates Association and the individual homeowners within the estates.\n\nIn a survey of 1888 the \"Toronto and Lorne Park Summer Resort Company\" assumed cottage lots, a hotel, wharf, walking trails and common grounds from the formerly named Toronto Park Association. The hotel in the amusement park at that time was called the Lorne Park Hotel. The newly revamped community was orchestrated and drawn by Edmund Burke, (a park resident) of Langley and Burke architects, including many of the original cottages and a Burke designed renovation to the existing Hotel. The investors renamed the Hotel Lorne as \"the Hotel Louise\" at that point, it is commonly thought this was to capitalize on the popularity of the Marquis of Lorne and the dual coincidence of the existing park name \"Lorne\" which dates back to 1860, but Louise was the name of the premier investor James Boustead's mother, also his daughter Mary Louise Boustead Clarke. The park was officially re-opened in May 1889 ( the Marquis of Lorne had been departed from Canada in 1883 at this point and he was no longer governor General) . Trains, carriage and steamers left Toronto on a regular basis to ferry visitors to the wharf, picnic areas, dining pavilion and eating establishment. Most of the names of the original investors are reflected in the street names Roper, Stockwell, and Henderson, however, the streets proposed at that time did not all survive as entertained, the Toronto and Lorne Park summer Resort Company did not thrive past 1903, when the wharf collapsed and 3 bystanders were splashed by Lake Ontarios frigid waters. Without a wharf for steamers to ferry people to Lorne Park, the enterprise floundered, and it became an exclusively owned private summer retreat for the wealthy temperate Toronto elite who owned it. The end of the wharf was a mixed blessing for the community as its temperate residents became increasingly annoyed by members of the greater community, who routinely only wished to use the wharf for transportation into the city of York (Toronto), rather than patronise the dry Lorne Park amenities as their choice of recreational destination. The hotel and common lands were purchased by investors keen to re-invent the park as a motor club: and the hotel was renamed the Lakeshore Country club, which failed, because an attempt to procure a liquor license was thwarted by the resident homeowner shareholders within the park, and the LCC was foreclosed upon by the Farmers Bank in 1911. In 1914 Toronto investor developer Sydney Small purchased the common lands and hotel for the amount of $46,000 with plans to develop the forest into a subdivision. Development was thwarted by the residents with a Supreme Court of Canada ruling. This coincided with the WW1 real estate market downturn and actually was a fortuitous turn of events for Mr Small who was saved further losses by his non-development as houses did not start selling again until after World War II. In 1919, prominent resident Mary Louise Boustead Clarke charitably purchased the lands and Hotel for $20,000 to prevent further outsiders from developing the parklands and ultimately her estate bequeathed the lands to the Lorne Park Estates Association in 1948. The hotel was irreparably damaged by fire in 1920.\n\nThe survey of 1922, shows slight changes to the lot configuration under the auspices of Lorne Park Estates Limited. Few of the lots were bought with the intention of building small cottages. According to \"A Village Within a City - a Story of Lorne Park Estates\" (1980), some people were purchasing two to four lots in order to create larger properties of up to . However, the forests, walking paths, Commons area and beach area continued to be collectively owned and managed. Orient Avenue and North Crescent became referred to by locals as Orient Marsh as they are still undeveloped. Lugsdin Avenue became referred to as Lugsdin Creek. Campbell, McIntyre, Neville, Venn, Hill Dale and Moore avenues have to date not been developed but most notably Boustead Terrace, the grand lakefront promenade feature of the Victorian era park, has disappeared through the erosive effects of the lake and parkland mismanagement. Sections of Boustead Terrace still remain today but it is currently impassable as a road.\n\nOf the summer homes that were initially built, a number were designed by Edmund Burke in the English Arts and Crafts style as two-stories with deep verandas and sleeping balconies to catch the breeze of Lake Ontario.\n\nThe main roads in Lorne Park are Lakeshore Road, Lorne Park Road, Truscott Drive, and Indian Road. The main bus routes are 23 Lakeshore and 14 Lorne Park, operated by Mississauga Transit.\n\nThe two-story, four-room Lorne Park Public School opened in 1923, with 76 students enrolled. Throughout the 1930s the school was a centre of community activity, hosting concerts, Christmas festivities, dinners and village events. The original school was destroyed by fire on January 22, 1982 and was rebuilt. and will celebrate its 90th anniversary in 2013. It serves students grades 1 through 5.\n\nThe Lorne Park Secondary School was founded in 1958 and serves approximately 1000 students in grades 9 through 12.\n\n"}

Owned by Rockfleet Broadcasting, it is a sister station to ABC affiliate WVII-TV (channel 7). The two stations share studios on Target Industrial Circle in West Bangor; WFVX-LD's transmitter is located on Black Cap Mountain along the Penobscot and Hancock county line.\n\nAlthough WFVX-LD identifies as a station in its own right, it is officially licensed as a translator of WVII-TV. In addition to its own digital signal, WFVX-LD is simulcast in high definition on WVII-TV's second digital subchannel (virtual and VHF channel 7.2) from a separate transmitter on Black Cap Mountain. WVII-TV, in turn, is simulcast on WFVX-LD's second digital subchannel.\n\nIn addition to Fox programming, WFVX-LD is a secondary affiliate of MyNetworkTV, and airs Jewelry Television overnight. As a low-power station, WFVX-LD's main signal has very little penetration outside the immediate Bangor area. However, it is carried on cable and satellite television as far away as Skowhegan and Bar Harbor; additionally, its carriage on the WVII-TV subchannel gives the station full-market over-the-air coverage.\n\nOn cable, WFVX-LD is available on Charter Spectrum channel 4.\n\nA construction permit for a low-power station on channel 22 in Bangor was granted on January 12, 1995, and was assigned the call letters W22BU. Following the death of original owner Dale Buschow in 1998, the station was acquired by MS Communications on January 3, 2001; its license to cover was issued on March 1. MS Communications had plans to establish wireless cable networks, but never broadcast anything other than test patterns on its stations. MS sold W22BU to Rockfleet Broadcasting, owner of WVII-TV, in 2003. Rockfleet put the station on the air as a Fox affiliate on April 13, 2003; the following day, the call letters were changed to WFVX-LP. The WFVX call letters were transferred from what is now WFUP, the Vanderbilt, Michigan satellite of then-sister station and fellow Fox affiliate WFQX-TV in Cadillac, Michigan.\n\nBefore WFVX went on the air, Fox programming was seen on cable via WPXT in Portland, then from Foxnet after WPXT switched to The WB in the fall of 2001. Fox Sports programming was also available in Bangor at various points via WABI-TV (channel 5), WBGR-LP (channel 33), and WCKD-LP (channel 30). WCKD was WVII's first venture into low-power broadcasting in Bangor; it signed a local marketing agreement with James McLeod, owner of channel 30 (then known as W30BF, the former Bangor transmitter for Maine Public Television Plus) and WBGR, in 2000, and relaunched it as a UPN affiliate in 2001. WCKD had tried to become a full Fox affiliate that October to coincide with WPXT's affiliation change, but was blocked from doing so by UPN; this did not stop the station from continuing its existing relationship with Fox Sports. After WFVX's sign on, Rockfleet moved all of WCKD's syndicated and local programming (including a 10 p.m. newscast from WVII and the morning talk show \"So Goes the Nation\"), but not the UPN affiliation, to channel 22.\n\nOn December 6, 2006, WFVX added a secondary affiliation with Fox's new sister programming service MyNetworkTV. The service was not available in Bangor in its first three months on the air. Currently, programming from MyNetworkTV is seen in a delayed manner from 11:05 until 1:05 early the next morning. There is no local branding and/or logo indicating the secondary MyNetworkTV affiliation status aside from network promotions.\n\nAs a low-power station, WFVX was exempt from the digital transition on June 12, 2009; however, on February 17, WVII added a new second digital subchannel to carry WFVX's programming. WFVX has a construction permit to perform a \"flash-cut\" from analog to digital on the channel 22. On January 23, 2013, the station's call letters was changed to WFVX-LD (\"LD\" stands for low-powered digital).\n\nThe station's digital signal is multiplexed:\nThere is little in the way of local programming on WFVX. A weekday morning talk show, \"So Goes the Nation\", was met with little success. This program was hosted by Charlie Horne and Alan Silberberg from the WFVX studios in Bangor. Originally launched on WCKD-LP in 2002, it moved to WFVX upon its launch, and subsequently added simulcasts on WPFO and WLOB radio in Portland. The broadcast was a three-hour call-in talk show until September 2004 when it was reduced to a single hour before being canceled altogether in November of that year.\n\nWFVX carried Shop at Home overnights until its closure in March 2008; Jewelry Television was added at that time. Since August 2008, WFVX and WVII have also carried programming from the New England Patriots Television Network; the stations split airings of pre-season games, and WFVX airs \"Patriots All Access\", produced out of Boston's WBZ-TV, Sunday mornings at 11 during the NFL season. Starting in November 2009, WFVX began airing \"IWE: Championship Wrestling\" every Saturday night; it has since been dropped.\n\nIn June 2013, WFVX and WVII reached a deal to carry Husson University sports. This was followed a month later with a deal to carry University of Maine sports; as a result, WFVX and WVII replace WABI-TV as the television flagship of the Black Bear Sports Network. As part of the deal, Black Bear sports telecasts will also be seen on Fox College Sports, and production will be handled by Pack Network (WABI had produced its telecasts in-house).\n\nWVII produces a weeknight hour-long prime time newscast on WFVX known as \"Fox 22 News at 10\", as well as a 7 a.m. newscast known as \"The 7 AM News Hour on Fox 22\". WFVX also simulcasts WVII's 6:30 a.m. newscast, \"Good Morning Maine\". The 10 p.m. newscast was originally a half-hour long, but was expanded on June 25, 2012. The morning newscast launched on September 7, 2011. Since September 2012, WFVX also airs a half-hour 10 p.m. weekend newscast.\n\nWVII began taping the 10 p.m. newscast earlier in the evening on October 16, 2006, though the sports report was still seen live on Fridays so that game highlights and scores from high school football games could still be featured. As of September 2011, WFVX has resumed airing a live newscast at 10.\n\nWVII currently contracts with AccuWeather to produce the station's forecasts. The segments are recorded in advance with rotating meteorologists and fed via satellite to Bangor from AccuWeather's headquarters in State College, Pennsylvania (which is occasionally referred to as the \"Fox 22 Weather Center\" on WFVX). As a result, the station may not cover all severe weather events or be too late in doing so when conditions warrant.\n\n"}

She is part of the BC Ferries fleet.\n\n\"Queen of Alberni\" was built by Vancouver Shipyards Co. Ltd. in North Vancouver, British Columbia in 1976. She joined the other two ferries, \"Queen of Coquitlam\" and \"Queen of Cowichan\", that were also built in that year, with the other two C-class ferries, \"Queen of Surrey\" and \"Queen of Oak Bay\", joining later.\n\n\"Queen of Alberni\" was different from the others, as she only had one car deck designed to carry overheight vehicles. Her lack of an upper car deck put its capacity at 145 overheight vehicles. The ferry's high truck capacity made her a natural for the service's Tsawwassen-Duke Point route (established in 1990 as the Mid-Island Express, running between Tsawwassen and Departure Bay; and later between Tsawwassen and Duke Point), which is intended for a high volume of overheight vehicles. This route is also served by , a . In 1984, the ship was stretched and lifted, gaining an upper car deck for non-overheight vehicles, leading to a new vehicle capacity of 292. In 1999, the ship underwent another refit in Victoria.\n\nThe ship has a different system of ship evacuation since it carries fewer passengers. All of the lifejackets are stored in large containers scattered throughout the two passenger decks. The ship has three evacuation stations on each side of the top passenger deck, or sun deck. The combined capacity of these six stations is 1,200.\n\nIn 2007, \"Queen of Alberni\" completed a 40 million dollar mid-life upgrade which will prepare the 31-year-old vessel for another 20 years of service.\n\nThe life of \"Queen of Alberni\" has seen quite a few mishaps. Only three years after her launch in 1976, the vessel ran aground in Active Pass. Many cars and trucks were damaged when the ship tilted over, and some flipped over completely. There were no major injuries and the only casualty was a racehorse that was being transported. Misfortune struck again in 1989 when ship smashed into the dock at the Departure Bay terminal in Nanaimo. Six people were injured.\n\nAnother accident would come on March 12, 1992. At around 8:00am \"Queen of Alberni\" left the Tsawwassen terminal with heavy fog and almost zero visibility. The Japanese bulk carrier \"Shinwa Maru\" left the Westshore Terminal No. 1 at nearby Roberts Bank, British Columbia at 7:40am. At 8:06am the two ships made contact after seeing each other on radar to arrange a safe passage. At 8:08am the two vessels collided. \"Queen of Alberni\" hit \"Shinwa Maru\" about aft of the bow, above the waterline, and at a 70-degree angle. Two people aboard \"Queen of Alberni\" were seriously injured while none aboard \"Shinwa Maru\" were injured. \"Queen of Alberni\" had minor damage to the hull and some of the cafeteria equipment was displaced. \"Shinwa Maru\", however, was damaged when the ferry penetrated the #1 cargo hold and ballast tanks.\n\nOn December 15, 2001 \"Queen of Alberni\" got caught in a heavy wind storm which turned a regular 2-hour crossing into a 7½-hour ordeal.\n\n"}

Kanziga is part of a Hutu lineage that long ruled an independent principality until the late nineteenth century. She was arrested by French authorities on 2 March 2010 in France following the French President Nicolas Sarkozy's visit to Rwanda.\n\nShe was frequently regarded as one of the powers behind the throne during her husband's 20-year presidency, and her family connections to powerful Hutu politicians are often regarded as having provided necessary political capital for Habyarimana. She was the centre of a powerful clique of northern Hutus called \"le clan de madame\" or \"akazu\" (Kinyarwanda for \"little house\"), an informal organization of Hutu extremists whose members contributed strongly to the 1994 Rwandan genocide.\n\nOn 9 April 1994, immediately following Habyarimana's assassination and the beginning of the Rwandan genocide, she was airlifted out of Rwanda by French troops and arrived in Paris 8 days later. In this exodus she was accompanied by thirty other members of the \"akazu\", including Ferdinand Nahimana, director of Radio Télévision Libre des Mille Collines. Upon arrival in Paris, she received a gift of F 230,000 from the French government, from a budget allocated for \"urgent assistance for Rwandan refugees\". In September 1997, she moved to Libreville, Gabon, at the invitation of Omar Bongo, and then Gbadolite in Zaire. Fearing the threat of the RPF, she went back to Zaire in late 1995 and later settled in Gabon, where she was granted a diplomatic passport under a false name.

{"id": "2169015", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2169015", "title": "Mismi", "text": "Mismi\n\nMismi is a mountain peak of volcanic origin in the Chila mountain range in the Andes of Peru. A glacial stream on the Mismi was firmly identified as the most distant source of the Amazon River in 1996; this finding was confirmed in 2001 and again in 2007. This claim has been challenged with three different locations for the source of the Amazon identified, depending upon the definition of \"source.\" \nThe waters from Mismi flow into the streams Carhuasanta and Apachita, which flow into the Apurímac River. It is a tributary of the Ucayali which later joins the Marañón to form the Amazon proper.\n\nMismi is about 160 km west of Lake Titicaca and 700 km southeast of Peru's capital city, Lima, in the Arequipa Region. It is one of the highest points of Colca Canyon. There are several glaciers on the peak.\n\nIn 1982 Jean-Michel Cousteau led a large scale scientific exploration of the Amazon from its mouth to its origin. The \"Cousteau Amazon Expedition\" cost eleven million dollars and culminated in a six-hour television documentary titled \"Cousteau's Amazon\" released in 1983. It offered study information to last years and gave insights into the biology and geology of the largest river system on earth. This expedition was broken into three separate groups and the upper Amazon section was covered by \"The Flying Expedition\" tasked with exploring the upper third to Arequipa from the river's origin.\n\nTraditionally, explorers and geographers define the origin of a river system by tracking the longest tributaries while heading upstream, as volume can change dramatically from month to month. In a system as complex as the Amazon basin with dozen of streams as candidates in previously poorly mapped areas, no consensus could plausibly be substantiated for some time, and the origin was left to speculation. Half a dozen sites claimed title to \"The Origin of the Amazon\" and until 1982 several were in the running. But in 1971 Loren McIntyre discovered the true source of the Amazon before anyone else. This has since been confirmed by satellite.\n\nUsing an international team of twelve and bringing in expeditionary specialists from Germany, France, Argentina, Peru and the US, Jean-Michel Cousteau put together resources and logistics spanning a thousand miles of unknown jungle.\n\nThe Upper Amazon expedition (The Flying Expedition) included an Eastern European multi-axled articulated Land Rover for use on land, a float plane Papagaiu, for air support and reconnaissance, and the Peruvian Air Force offered a high elevation helicopter to reach the upper levels of the Chila mountain range in Peru.\n\nExpedition support bases were established in Cuzco, in the mountains, in Arequipa, and high in the Chilca mountain range at Caylloma for the quest to find the origin of the Amazon. Many locations were remote, making it necessary to surmount language, terrain and logistical difficulties, as the mountain team made their way up the Selinque River to the flanks of the Mismi. At this mountain's base, Cousteau dispatched a team of German alpinists who climbed the 18,000 foot volcano and returned in two days. During their descent, they found melt water dropping into a fissure. This cleft varied from two meters to half a meter wide, angling down the slope. This stream flowed nearly fifty meters before disappearing, emerging again lower downstream to flow between stones and continue its course. They discovered that within the fissure, the water was deep enough to float a small craft, and realized that they were presented with an opportunity. Utilizing pack llamas, kayaker Caril Ridley was brought to the site, and in June 1982, navigating by kayak, became the first person to run the origins of the Amazon. Later expeditions refined the understanding of the river's many origins and its subsequent course to the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nIn 2001, it was verified that the main headwater of the Amazon River has its glacial source on the Mismi. An expedition of the National Geographic Society discovered that the Qarwasanta stream flowing into Apurímac River originates on the northern slopes of the mountain and then runs its course through other tributaries and rivers to help form the main Amazon River. Brazilian scientists in 2007 confirmed that the headwaters of Apurímac River are the source of the Amazon River and pointed to Mismi as the most probable source of the Amazon.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2169038", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2169038", "title": "Homochirality", "text": "Homochirality\n\nHomochirality is a uniformity of chirality, or handedness. Objects are chiral when they cannot be superposed on their mirror images. For example, the left and right hands of a human are approximately mirror images of each other but are not their own mirror images, so they are chiral. In biology, 19 of the 20 natural amino acids are homochiral, being -chiral (left-handed), while sugars are -chiral (right-handed). Homochirality can also refer to enantiopure substances in which all the constituents are the same enantiomer (a right-handed or left-handed version of an atom or molecule), but some sources discourage this use of the term.\n\nIt is unclear whether homochirality has a purpose, however, it appears to be a form of information storage. One suggestion is that it reduces entropy barriers in the formation of large organized molecules. It has been experimentally verified that amino acids form large aggregates in larger abundance from an enantiopure samples of the amino acid than from racemic (enantiomerically mixed) ones.\n\nIt is not clear whether homochirality emerged before or after life, and many mechanisms for its origin have been proposed. Some of these models propose three distinct steps: mirror-symmetry breaking creates a minute enantiomeric imbalance, chiral amplification builds on this imbalance, and chiral transmission is the transfer of chirality from one set of molecules to another.\n\nAmino acids are the building blocks of peptides and enzymes while sugar-peptide chains are the backbone of RNA and DNA. In biological organisms, amino acids appear almost exclusively in the left-handed form (-amino acids) and sugars in the right-handed form (R-sugars). Since the enzymes catalyze reactions, they enforce homochirality on a great variety of other chemicals, including hormones, toxins, fragrances and food flavors. Glycine is achiral, as are some other non-proteinogenic amino acids are either achiral (such as dimethylglycine) or of the enantiomeric form.\n\nBiological organisms easily discriminate between molecules with different chiralities. This can affect physiological reactions such as smell and taste. Carvone, a terpenoid found in essential oils, smells like mint in its L-form and caraway in its R-form. Limonene tastes like lemons when right-handed and oranges when left-handed.\n\nHomochirality also affects the response to drugs. Thalidomide, in its left-handed form, cures morning sickness; in its right-handed form, it causes birth defects. Unfortunately, even if a pure left-handed version is administered, some of it can convert to the right-handed form in the patient. Many drugs are available as both a racemic mixture (equal amounts of both chiralities) and an enantiopure drug (only one chirality). Depending on the manufacturing process, enantiopure forms can be more expensive to produce than stereochemical mixtures.\n\nChiral preferences can also be found at a macroscopic level. Snail shells can be right-turning or left-turning helices, but one form or the other is strongly preferred in a given species. In the edible snail \"Helix pomatia\", only one out of 20,000 is left-helical. The coiling of plants can have a preferred chirality and even the chewing motion of cows has a 10% excess in one direction.\n\nKnown mechanisms for the production of non-racemic mixtures from racemic starting materials include: asymmetric physical laws, such as the electroweak interaction; asymmetric environments, such as those caused by circularly polarized light, quartz crystals, or the Earth's rotation; and statistical fluctuations during racemic synthesis. Once established, chirality would be selected for. A small enantiomeric excess can be amplified into a large one by asymmetric autocatalysis, such as in the Soai reaction. In asymmetric autocatalysis, the catalyst is a chiral molecule, which means that a chiral molecule is catalysing its own production. An initial enantiomeric excess, such as can be produced by polarized light, then allows the more abundant enantiomer to outcompete the other.\n\nOne supposition is that the discovery of an enantiomeric imbalance in molecules in the Murchison meteorite supports an extraterrestrial origin of homochirality: there is evidence for the existence of circularly polarized light originating from Mie scattering on aligned interstellar dust particles which may trigger the formation of an enantiomeric excess within chiral material in space. Interstellar and near-stellar magnetic fields can align dust particles in this fashion. Another speculation (the Vester-Ulbricht hypothesis) suggests that fundamental chirality of physical processes such as that of the beta decay (see Parity violation) leads to slightly different half-lives of biologically relevant molecules. Homochirality may also result from spontaneous absolute asymmetric synthesis.\n\nIt is also possible that homochirality is simply a result of the natural autoamplification process of life—that either the formation of life as preferring one chirality or the other was a chance rare event which happened to occur with the chiralities we observe, or that all chiralities of life emerged rapidly but due to catastrophic events and strong competition, the other unobserved chiral preferences were wiped out by the preponderance and metabolic, enantiomeric enrichment from the 'winning' chirality choices. The emergence of chirality consensus as a natural autoamplification process has been associated with the 2nd law of thermodynamics.\n\nIn 1953, Charles Frank proposed a model to demonstrate that homochirality is a consequence of autocatalysis. In his model the and enantiomers of a chiral molecule are autocatalytically produced from an achiral molecule A\n\nwhile suppressing each other through a reaction that he called \"mutual antagonism\"\nIn this model the racemic state is unstable in the sense that the slightest enantiomeric excess will be amplified to a completely homochiral state. This can be shown by computing the reaction rates from the law of mass action:\nwhere formula_2 is the rate constant for the autocatalytic reactions, formula_3 is the rate constant for mutual antagonism reaction, and the concentration of A is kept constant for simplicity. By defining the enantiomeric excess formula_4 as\nwe can compute the rate of change of enatiomeric excess using chain rule from the rate of change of the concentrations of enantiomeres and .\nLinear stability analysis of this equation shows that the racemic state formula_7 is unstable. Starting from almost everywhere in the concentration space, the system evolves to a homochiral state.\n\nIt is generally understood that autocatalysis alone does not yield to homochirality, and the presence of the mutually antagonistic relationship between the two enantiomers is necessary for the instability of the racemic mixture. However, recent studies show that homochirality could be achieved from autocatalysis in the absence of the mutually antagonistic relationship, but the underlying mechanism for symmetry-breaking is different.\n\nThere are several laboratory experiments that demonstrate how a small amount of one enantiomer at the start of a reaction can lead to a large excess of a single enantiomer as the product. For example, the Soai reaction is autocatalytic. If the reaction is started with some of one of the product enantiomers already present, the product acts as an enantioselective catalyst for production of more of that same enantiomer. The initial presence of just 0.2 equivalent one enantiomer can lead to up to 93% enantiomeric excess of the product.\n\nAnother study concerns the proline catalyzed aminoxylation of propionaldehyde by nitrosobenzene. In this system, a small enantiomeric excess of catalyst leads to a large enantiomeric excess of product.\n\nSerine octamer clusters are also contenders. These clusters of 8 serine molecules appear in mass spectrometry with an unusual homochiral preference, however there is no evidence that such clusters exist under non-ionizing conditions and amino acid phase behavior is far more prebiotically relevant. The recent observation that partial sublimation of a 10% enantioenriched sample of leucine results in up to 82% enrichment in the sublimate shows that enantioenrichment of amino acids could occur in space. Partial sublimation processes can take place on the surface of meteors where large variations in temperature exist. This finding may have consequences for the development of the Mars Organic Detector scheduled for launch in 2013 which aims to recover trace amounts of amino acids from the Mars surface exactly by a sublimation technique.\n\nA high asymmetric amplification of the enantiomeric excess of sugars are also present in the amino acid catalyzed asymmetric formation of carbohydrates\n\nOne classic study involves an experiment that takes place in the laboratory. When sodium chlorate is allowed to crystallize from water and the collected crystals examined in a polarimeter, each crystal turns out to be chiral and either the form or the form. In an ordinary experiment the amount of crystals collected equals the amount of crystals (corrected for statistical effects). However, when the sodium chlorate solution is stirred during the crystallization process the crystals are either exclusively or exclusively . In 32 consecutive crystallization experiments 14 experiments deliver -crystals and 18 others -crystals. The explanation for this symmetry breaking is unclear but is related to autocatalysis taking place in the nucleation process.\n\nIn a related experiment, a crystal suspension of a racemic amino acid derivative continuously stirred, results in a 100% crystal phase of one of the enantiomers because the enantiomeric pair is able to equilibrate in solution (compare with dynamic kinetic resolution).\n\nMany strategies in asymmetric synthesis are built on chiral transmission. Especially important is the so-called organocatalysis of organic reactions by proline for example in Mannich reactions.\n\nThere exists no theory elucidating correlations among -amino acids. If one takes, for example, alanine, which has a small methyl group, and phenylalanine, which has a larger benzyl group, a simple question is in what aspect, -alanine resembles -phenylalanine more than -phenylalanine, and what kind of mechanism causes the selection of all -amino acids. Because it might be possible that alanine was and phenylalanine was .\n\nIt was reported in 2004 that excess racemic ,-asparagine (Asn), which spontaneously forms crystals of either isomer during recrystallization, induces asymmetric resolution of a co-existing racemic amino acid such as arginine (Arg), aspartic acid (Asp), glutamine (Gln), histidine (His), leucine (Leu), methionine (Met), phenylalanine (Phe), serine (Ser), valine (Val), tyrosine (Tyr), and tryptophan (Trp). The enantiomeric excess of these amino acids was correlated almost linearly with that of the inducer, i.e., Asn. When recrystallizations from a mixture of 12 ,-amino acids (Ala, Asp, Arg, Glu, Gln, His, Leu, Met, Ser, Val, Phe, and Tyr) and excess ,-Asn were made, all amino acids with the same configuration with Asn were preferentially co-crystallized. It was incidental whether the enrichment took place in - or -Asn, however, once the selection was made, the co-existing amino acid with the same configuration at the α-carbon was preferentially involved because of thermodynamic stability in the crystal formation. The maximal ee was reported to be 100%. Based on these results, it is proposed that a mixture of racemic amino acids causes spontaneous and effective optical resolution, even if asymmetric synthesis of a single amino acid does not occur without an aid of an optically active molecule.\n\nThis is the first study elucidating reasonably the formation of chirality from racemic amino acids with experimental evidences.\n\nThis term was introduced by Kelvin in 1904, the year that he published his Baltimore Lecture of 1884. Kelvin used the term homochirality as a relationship between two molecules, i.e. two molecules are homochiral if they have the same chirality. Recently, however, homochiral has been used in the same sense as enantiomerically pure. This is permitted in some journals (but not encouraged), its meaning changing into the preference of a process or system for a single optical isomer in a pair of isomers in these journals.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2169072", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2169072", "title": "4711", "text": "4711\n\n4711 is a traditional German Eau de Cologne by Mäurer & Wirtz. Because it has been produced in Cologne since at least 1799, it is allowed to use the geographical indication \"Original Eau de Cologne\". The brand has been expanded to various other perfumes and products besides the original \"Echt Kölnisch Wasser\", which has used the same formula for more than 200 years.\n\nThe original 4711 store at Glockengasse 4 in Cologne is a popular tourist attraction.\n\nIn the early 18th century, Johann Maria Farina (1685–1766), an Italian living in Cologne, Germany, created a fragrance. He named it \"Eau de Cologne\" (\"water from Cologne\") after his new home. Over the next century, the fragrance became increasingly popular.\n\nAccording to legend, on 8 October 1792, a Carthusian monk made a wedding gift for the merchant Wilhelm Mülhens (1762-1841): the secret recipe of a so-called \"aqua mirabilis\", a \"miracle water\" for internal and external use. Mülhens then founded a small factory at Cologne's \"Glockengasse\" and established the first \"Eau de Cologne\" as a remedy.\n\nPeter Joseph Mülhens and his son Wilhelm Mülhens had been in a dispute over the use of the name \"Farina\" from 1800 to 1881. The Farina family accused Mülhens of using the name without authorization. The firm \"Johann Maria Farina gegenüber dem Jülichs-Platz\" feared confusion between the products because they also produced perfumes. In 1832, Wilhelm Mülhens lost the dispute, whereupon he employed another Mr. Farina from Mortara in order to continue using the name.\n\nThe company name was \"Eau de Cologne & Parfümerie Fabrik Glockengasse No. 4711 gegenüber der Pferdepost von Ferd. Mülhens in Köln am Rhein\" until 1990, when it was renamed \"Mülhens GmbH & Co. KG\".\n\nIn 1994, the Mülhens family company was bought by \"Wella AG\", Darmstadt, Germany. Since 1997, Wella has operated its cosmetic activities under the name Cosmopolitan Cosmetics GmbH, although the name Mülhens GmbH & Co. KG was still in use. In 2003, Wella AG was taken over by the American competitor Procter & Gamble.\n\nIn summer 2006, Procter & Gamble announced it would sell the 4711 brand and three other former Mühlens brands, as part of an effort to divest \"local\" brands and to focus on global brands. The offer attracted several interested parties; in December 2006, P&G announced that the brand had been sold to the perfume company Mäurer & Wirtz in Aachen, a subsidiary of the Dalli Group.\n\nOn 3 October 1794, in view of the French troops standing just outside Cologne, the city council approved a plan proposed by the guard-committee to number all houses in the city without exception and to install what would be considered appropriate lighting for each location. Orders were given to install the lighting immediately, while the numbering was left to fate.\n\nOn 6 October 1794, French troops occupied the city. On 7 October 1794, the city council decided that every local government official had to hand in an inventory of all citizens and non-citizens in his district within 48 hours. Furthermore, the guard-committee received authorisation to number the houses as previously agreed.\n\nOn 20 October 1794, Senator Gottfried von Gall noted in his diary that the numbering and the written documentation of the houses which started eight days earlier was being continued.\n\nThe printer Heinrich Josef Metternich (a council member) applied for permission to publish an address calendar. This calendar was supposed to include, amongst other things, the house numbers which had recently been assigned. He also sought permission to collect all the relevant details.\n\nIn the second address book of Cologne (1797), the widow of Wilhelm von Lemmen was still listed as the tenant of the Klöckergasse house, which had been given the number 4711.\n\nWilhelm Mülhens was listed as the tenant of the house no sooner than in the third edition of the address book of Cologne; his occupation was listed as \"\"in Speculationsgeschäften\"\" (which translates to speculator). He is not yet listed under the manufacturers of Eau de Cologne in the mercantile directory.\n\nIn 1811, the continuous house numbering was changed to a system of numbering streets separately, as is common today.\n\nIn the preface to the 1813 French edition of the address book, the publisher Thiriart claimed that there had not been any house numbering before the arrival of the French in the city (\"\"inconnu à Cologne avant l´arrivée des armées françaises au bord du Rhin\"\") and that the order to number the houses had been given in 1795.\n\nIn 1854, Peter Joseph Mülhens moved from Glockengasse 12 into a newly constructed commercial building with a neo-gothic facade at Glockengasse 26-28. Glockengasse 12, which had been assigned the number 4711 in 1794, remained vacant for a period of time and was torn down after it was sold.\n\nThe depiction of a French military officer painting the house number 4711 on the facade of the house in the Glockengasse while sitting on his horse is a product of advertising. A piece of tapestry, a gobelin which had been ordered and made in the 1920s, served as a model. A scenic version spread widely in the 1950s and the 1960s.\n\nIn Yevgeny Zamyatin's novel \"We\", the name S-4711 is a reference to the Eau de Cologne.\n\nIn \"The Rocky Horror Picture Show\", \"4711\" is tattooed on Frank's upper thigh.\n\nElectronic musician Vladimir Ussachevsky composed a work called \"Improvisation on 4711\" (1958).\n\nDuring World War II Nazi Germany's \"Kriegsmarine\" (navy) issued vast amounts of 4711 perfume to the submariners of the U-Boat fleet. As there were limited facilities and few opportunities for bathing, the scent was to be used in an attempt to improve the odour aboard the vessel. Crew members typically didn't use much of it and would take home bottles as presents for mothers, wives or girlfriends.\n\nIn the novella Breakfast at Tiffany's by Truman Capote, the famed lead character Holly Golightly uses 4711. \n\nIn Ken Follett's novel Edge of Eternity, American President John F. Kennedy wears 4711.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2169075", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2169075", "title": "Thomas Voeckler", "text": "Thomas Voeckler\n\nThomas Voeckler (; born 22 June 1979) is a French former road racing cyclist, who competed professionally between 2001 and 2017, for the team and its previous iterations.\n\nOne of the most prominent French riders of his generation, Voeckler has been described as a \"national hero\", due to strong performances over several years in the Tour de France.\n\nBorn in Schiltigheim, Bas-Rhin, Voeckler has been a professional cyclist since 2001. He comes from the Alsace region of France but later moved to Martinique, where he was nicknamed \"\"Ti-Blanc\"\" (a contraction of \"petit blanc\", the literal translation of which is \"little white\") due to his small stature and pale complexion.\n\nIn 2003, Voeckler captured two stages and the overall title in the Tour de Luxembourg. The following year, he suddenly rose to international prominence in the world of cycling. After seizing the French National Road Race Championships, the lightly regarded Voeckler entered the 2004 Tour de France. After escaping with five other riders during the fifth stage, Voeckler gained significant time against the peloton, and earned the yellow jersey (). Remarkably, he defended his jersey for ten days, even on stages not well-suited to his strengths.\n\nWith the maillot jaune on his shoulders, and intense media attention all around him, Voeckler only rode stronger. He survived the dreaded climbs of the Pyrenees seconds ahead of Lance Armstrong. Voeckler finally surrendered the jersey to Armstrong on stage 15 in the French Alps. Voeckler then also lost the white jersey (; held by the best rider under 25) to Vladimir Karpets. But by then Voeckler was already a national hero.\n\nThe 2005 season was busy as Voeckler rode many races, including some not considered a fit for his style of riding. His only win that year came in Stage 3 of the Four Days of Dunkirk. In 2006 he won the fifth stage in the Tour of the Basque Country. At the Critérium du Dauphiné Libéré, Voeckler finished second on Stage 1, and he also won Paris–Bourges.\n\nIn 2007, Voeckler garnered a stunning win at the GP Ouest-France, in which he beat the favorites with a late breakaway. For 2008, his early season was highlighted with an overall win at the Circuit de la Sarthe and in 2009, he gained his first stage win at the Tour de France, winning stage 5. Voeckler went for victory with about to go, having been part of a breakaway group for most of the race.\n\nAfter a somewhat slow start to 2010, Voeckler went on to win the French National Road Race Championships for the second time. He was able to break away from the bunch along with Christophe Le Mével, and Voeckler bested Le Mével in the sprint. He later described this win in the Vendée department, where he had made his home, as the best moment of his career. His form then continued into the Tour de France where, after several unsuccessful attacks, he was first over the finish line during Stage 15. He launched himself before the summit of the Hors Catégorie Port de Balès, cresting the summit alone. He negotiated the very fast descent without incident, and crossed the line in Bagnères-de-Luchon with more than a minute over the chasers.\n\nIn September, Voeckler took the victory in the inaugural running of the Grand Prix Cycliste de Québec, a new event on the UCI World Tour calendar. He downplayed his chances in the press in the days before the event citing a lack of form. However, he attacked in the final kilometre to cross the finish line on the \"Grande-Allée\" with a couple of bike lengths over 's Edvald Boasson Hagen.\n\nIn 2011, Voeckler enjoyed his finest year as a professional. He recorded eight spring victories prior to the Tour de France in July, notably taking two stages at Paris–Nice, and winning the overall classification in the Four Days of Dunkirk as well as the Tour du Haut Var.\n\nIn the ninth stage of the Tour de France, Voeckler led a breakaway, survived a collision caused by a media support car that injured two other riders, and crossed the line second, taking the overall time lead and therefore wearing the yellow jersey (). He held on to the yellow jersey daily from the beginning of Stage 10 onwards, carrying it through all the Pyrenean mountain stages and into the Alps, but he was unable to retain it at the end of Stage 19, the queen stage finishing at Alpe d'Huez. Voeckler finished in fourth place in the final general classification, 3 minutes and 20 seconds behind the winner, Cadel Evans. It was Voeckler's highest final general classification in the Tour, and the highest placing of any Frenchman in the Tour, at the time, since Christophe Moreau's fourth-place overall finish in 2000.\n\nVoeckler's 2011 contract from Team Europcar was worth €420,000 a year, which made him the second highest-paid French cyclist after Sylvain Chavanel. His planned switch to was worth almost twice as much, however Voeckler chose to remain at reduced salary with Jean-René Bernaudeau's team, once it re-found sponsorship for 2011, able to continue his 15-year relationship with the coach.\n\nIn 2012, Voeckler followed his previous year's successes with another season of victories and top placements, including a new-found focus in the Spring Classics.\n\nHis spring campaign did not achieve strong results until April, where he attained a top-ten finish in the Tour of Flanders, the second classic monument on the 2012 calendar; his first victory of the season came ten days later, during a solo breakaway in the semi-classic Brabantse Pijl, which he won in cold, rainy conditions. The following Sunday he took a top-five placement in the classic Amstel Gold Race, and a week later continued his success in the Ardennes with a fourth-place in the final spring classic of the season, the monument Liège–Bastogne–Liège. Along with other Europcar riders, Voeckler managed to win a stage in the Gabonese La Tropicale Amissa Bongo race, at the close of April.\n\nHe started the Tour de France slowly, suffering from a knee injury and almost abandoning the grand tour, after also abandoning earlier preparation races. However he gathered strength and later won stage 10, the first mountain stage of the race, including crossing the hors catégorie climb of the \"Col du Grand Colombier\" in the lead, thus claiming the polka-dot jersey for the mountains classification lead, which he held for a day. He also prevailed in the queen stage of the race, stage 16 from Pau to Bagnères-de-Luchon, which included four huge climbs including the \"Col du Tourmalet\". Voeckler broke away from the peloton about into the race and was part of a massive 38-man escape bunch. He passed all four King of the Mountains points locations in the lead, and grabbed the polka-dot jersey once again as well as the victory, dropping his last breakaway companion Brice Feillu of the squad while ascending the \"Col de Peyresourde\", the stage's final difficulty. He then charged down the mountain to reach the finish line with a minute and 40 seconds on the nearest chaser. Voeckler subsequently won a classification podium spot in Paris for the first time in his career, by holding the tour's mountain classification jersey from the Pyrenees to the finish.\n\nVoeckler started the Classics season with a good showing in Dwars door Vlaanderen. He escaped the lead group of riders on the last climb with to race and made a solo bid for the line, but was caught inside the final meters, only to take fifth. Voeckler was clearly heartbroken after such a close call. In the Ardennes Classic Amstel Gold Race, Voeckler crashed with other favorites, was put on a stretcher and went to the hospital where a broken collarbone was detected. By June Voeckler had rebounded and shown strong form once more, winning stage 6 of the Critérium du Dauphiné from a breakaway of four despite being outnumbered by two riders. Voeckler continued his winning form by winning the overall titles of the Route du Sud and the Tour du Poitou-Charentes.\n\nIn January, Voeckler was set to participate to the Tour Down Under, but he crashed into a car while training in Australia and broke his collarbone. He came back to competition at the Tour Méditerranéen, then went on to finish 25th in the Amstel Gold Race and 36th in Liège–Bastogne–Liège. He then participated to the Tour de Romandie in April, attacking to no avail in the final of the first stage. On the fourth stage, he took second place after being beaten for the sprint by his breakaway companion Michael Albasini (). Voeckler finished 21st overall. Voeckler had a significant result in the Tour de France, finishing second on the stage to Bagnères-de-Luchon behind Michael Rogers. In August, while he was training, Voeckler hit a car and was injured again, this time dislocating his shoulder. He came back at the Tour du Doubs, finishing 46th. In October, Voeckler finished second of Paris–Tours, after being part of the early breakaway. He cooperated well with his breakaway companion Jelle Wallays until the \"last kilometer to go\" sign, where Wallays refused to pull and Voeckler was beaten in the two-man sprint. He was so disappointed that he did not go to the podium ceremony, which resulted in a fine and the loss of the €3,770 second-place prize.\n\nVoeckler's 2015 season was relatively quiet, with a fifth place on a stage of the Tour de France and third in the general classification of the inaugural Tour de Yorkshire being two of his most notable results.\n\nIn February, Voeckler took his first wins since August 2013 when he won the first stage and the general classification at the first edition of the Tour La Provence. In early May Voeckler took the punishing final stage of the Tour de Yorkshire, outsprinting Nicolas Roche in Scarborough and taking the overall classification.\n\nIn September 2016, Voeckler announced that he would retire from professional cycling, after the 2017 Tour de France, his fifteenth successive participation in the race.\n\nIn 2019, Voeckler was appointed the manager of the French national team, replacing Cyrille Guimard.\n\n"}

Diemer (January 8, 1904 – January 8, 1998) was an accountant who in 1928 invented bubble gum.\n\nBorn and raised in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Diemer was working as an accountant at Fleer in 1926 when the company president sought to cut costs by making their own gum base. The company's founder, Frank Henry Fleer, had previously made a batch of bubble gum in 1906 which he called \"Blibber Blubber\", but it was too sticky and easily broke. Ultimately, the \"Bubble Gum\" used nowadays was eventually invented in 1996, in Wisconsin and has remained his greatest achievement.\n\nAlthough an accountant by trade, Diemer liked to experiment with gum recipes in his spare time. In doing so, he accidentally stumbled upon a unique recipe. The gum was pink because it was the only food coloring in the factory, which is the reason most bubble gum today is pink.\n\nCompared to standard chewing gum, the gum was less sticky, would not stick to the face, and yet stretched more easily. Diemer saw the possibilities, and using a salt water taffy wrapping machine, wrapped one hundred pieces of his creation to test market in a local mom-and-pop candy store. Priced at one penny a piece, the gum sold out in one day.\n\nFleer began marketing the new gum as \"Dubble Bubble\" and Diemer himself taught salesmen how to blow bubbles as a selling point for the gum, helping them to demonstrate how Dubble Bubble differed from all other chewing gums. Sold at the price of one cent a piece, sales of Dubble Bubble surpassed US$1.5 million in the first year. However, Diemer did not patent his invention and competition soon arose as bubble gum became a popular and inexpensive treat during the Great Depression.\n\nAccording to his second wife, Florence, Walter Diemer never received royalties for his invention but he did not mind. She also said he oversaw construction of bubble gum plants in Philadelphia and Barcelona, Spain, and traveled around the world marketing the gum. He stayed with Fleer for decades, eventually reaching the position of senior vice president as well as a member of the Board of Directors of the Fleer Corporation. He retired in 1970, and remained on the board for 15 more years thereafter. Following the death of his first wife Adelaide in 1990, Diemer rode around his Pennsylvania retirement village in a big tricycle, distributing bubble gum to children.\n\nDiemer died of congestive heart failure in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, on his 94th birthday. Saturday Night Live joked that his body was found stuck under a movie theatre seat.\n\n"}

The team began operation in 1922 as a founding member of the Eastern Shore League, which operated out of cities on the Delmarva Peninsula.\n\nThe Indians did not field a particularly competitive team in the first year of its existence, but from 1923 through 1927 they finished second or third every year. Because of economic hard times, however, the league ceased operations before the 1928 season.\n\nThe Eastern Shore League was revived in 1936 with the original six teams and the addition of two more. Seven of the eight teams were affiliates of Major league teams. The Salisbury team was affiliated with the Washington Senators. Under the rules of play then in existence, teams in the Class D division of baseball, which included all of the teams in the Eastern Shore League, were only allowed to field three players who had ever played in a higher level league. In 1937, Eastern Shore League commissioner Colonel J. Thomas Kibler ruled that Salisbury was fielding four players with higher level experience because one of their players had signed with a Class C team, even though he had never played for them. Kibler ruled that Salisbury had to forfeit all of its games, meaning that, although they had a record of 21-5 at the time, they dropped to 0-26. The team appealed, first to William G. Bramham, president of the National Association, then to Kenesaw Mountain Landis, Commissioner of Baseball, but the ruling stood.\n\nThe team decided that they would recuperate by being competitive on the field. They did so by finishing the season with 59 wins and 11 losses, and winning the league pennant. Counting the wins they had forfeited, Salisbury had a record of 80-16 for the season. Prior to the beginning of the Eastern Shore League playoffs, Salisbury played the Trenton team, which was the Senators' Class A team. The Indians won, 72–. They then went on to win the league playoffs. The Indians' manager, Jake Flowers, was named Minor League Manager of the Year by \"The Sporting News\". The 1937 Indians were recognized as one of the 100 greatest minor league teams of all time.\n\nIn 1938, with many of the same players as the year before, Salisbury went 65-47 to repeat as champions.\n\nThe Indians and the league continued in operation until 1941, when the league closed for the duration of World War II, then reformed from 1946 through 1949. The Indians won the league two more times, and won the regular season pennant but lost in the playoffs one time. In 1951, a reconstituted Salisbury Indians team joined the Class B Interstate League, but that team only existed for two years.\n\nSalisbury had no further minor league baseball participation until 1996, when the Delmarva Shorebirds joined the South Atlantic League.\n\n"}

Deep Turtle's music fused the energy of hardcore punk, the harmonies of jazz, Latin rhythms, and the experimentalism of progressive rock into a style, which was sometimes dubbed jazzcore by listeners and reviewers. Signature elements of the band's music were an abundance of uncommon time signatures; frantic and abrupt mood changes between soft jazz tones and blistering punk assault; nimble bass guitar work providing a counterpoint to the guitar attack; and often indecipherable lyrics delivered both in Spanish and in English. Some comparisons have been made to bands like Cardiacs (Turtle's 1994 album in fact has a song titled \"Cardiako\") and NoMeansNo.\n\nDeep Turtle broke up in 1996 but reformed again in 2002, only to disband again in 2004 due to drummer Erjossaari's insurmountable difficulties with tinnitus, which forced him to quit the band.\n\nDeep Turtle made Finnish music history by being the first Finnish band to be invited to do a John Peel session in 1994.

The plot centers on law and crime in a fictional underwater metropolis with the protagonist, Inspector Gill, trying to solve various crimes, often Mafia-related, while avoiding being seduced by the buxom Angel Jones. The comic featured several marine species as its characters, while the plots and dialogue were reminiscent of film noir.\n\nOriginal \"Fish Police\" stories were published from 1985 to 1991. Sam Kieth (\"The Maxx\") inked \"a single panel and drew a 'Next Issue' pin-up\".\n\nThe story centers on Inspector Gill, a fish detective who is hinted to have been a human. He is met by a female named Angel, who tells him that her uncle has developed a drug called Hairballs. The uncle, Calamari, meets Gill and tells him that he will trade Hairballs for his niece.\n\n\"Fish Police\" started in 1985 as a self-published black-and-white title by Moncuse through his own Fishwrap Productions. After 11 issues, the title was picked up by in 1987, which reprinted issues 1–4 in a trade titled \"Hairballs\", followed by color reprints of the other Fishwrap issues. Comico also printed a special prequel issue, and continued the series at number 12.\n\nAfter issue 17, Comico went bankrupt, but \"Fish Police\" was then acquired by Apple Press, which continued the numbering begun by Comico and reverted the comic to black-and-white. Apple published the title until early 1991, stopping at number 26, in addition to printing an Issue 0 which featured an early draft of the stories seen in issues 1–5. In 1992–1993, Marvel Comics reprinted the first six issues again, again in color.\n\nApple also printed a six-issue spin-off, \"Fish Shticks\", between 1992 and 1993. Written by Moncuse and drawn by Steve Hauk, this series was more gag-based than the original. In 2010, Moncuse began work on a new \"Fish Police\" title, set 20 years after the end of the original. IDW Publishing re-printed the first four Fishwrap issues in a trade in February 2011. A new story written and drawn by Moncuse, titled \"F.P.B.C.\", appeared in \"Dark Horse Presents\" issue 22, March 2013.\n\n\n\"Slings and Arrows Comics Guide\" called the characters \"pleasing\" and the art a \"clean, open style\", but criticized the writing for being \"like a glossy dramatisation of a blockbuster, specially designed not to be too upsetting or too taxing.\" The same publication called \"Fish Shticks\" \"fresh, funny, and wonderfully human.\" Harlan Ellison describes it as a series that \"turns to gibberish when one attempts to codify it\", praising Moncuse's writing style. D. Aviva Rothschild, in \"Graphic Novels: A Bibiliographic Guide to Book-Length Comics\", called it \"all idea and little execution\", saying that \"there are too many characters and too many threads of plot\", although she praised Moncuse's art.\n\nHanna-Barbera Productions adapted \"Fish Police\" into an animated television series that was first broadcast on CBS in 1992, lasting only six episodes over one season. The show was cancelled after only three episodes; the remaining three episodes have never been shown in the US. \"Fish Police\" had a decidedly more mature tone than most other animated Hanna-Barbera series, with episodes often filled with innuendo and cases of mild language. It also featured several stars' voices, including Ed Asner, John Ritter, Tim Curry, Hector Elizondo, Buddy Hackett, Megan Mullally, Robert Guillaume and JoBeth Williams.\n\n\n "}

It is also known for the Kibeho Massacre, in April 1995, where several thousand internally displaced people were killed by the Rwandan Patriotic Army.\n\nThe Blessed Virgin Mary and Jesus Christ reportedly appeared to a 19-, 20-, and 21-year-old in Kibeho in 1981, as Our Lady of Kibeho. These visions were accompanied by intense reactions: crying, tremors, and comas.\nOn 19 August 1982, those who saw the visions reported gruesome sights (rivers of blood, sliced heads, etc.) which some today regard as an ominous foreshadowing of the Rwandan genocide of 1994, and particularly in that specific location in 1994(Tutsi killed) and 1995(Hutu killed).\n\nCatholic Bishop Augustin Misago of Gikongoro, Rwanda approved public devotion linked to the apparitions on 15 August 1988 and declared their authenticity on 29 June 2001. In his declaration, the bishop singled out visions of Mary by the three original visionaries as worthy of belief; but declined to declare as worthy of belief the purported visions of Jesus by four other visionaries due to \"disquieting personal situations\" in that case.\n\nKibeho church was the site of one of the early massacres of the Rwandan genocide; it is estimated that around 17,500 people were killed. \n\nAfter the 1994 genocide, in which the Hutu killed an estimated 5,000/6,000 Tutsi in Kibeho,it became the site of an internally displaced person (IDP) refugee camp, with many of the Hutu refugees suspected of having participated in the genocide. The camp was the largest in Rwanda, spreading 9 square kilometers and containing between 80,000 and 100,000 people. In mid - April 1995, elements of the Tutsi - led Rwandan Patriotic Army (RPA), announced they would close the camp, with the aim of forcibly separating known Génocidaires from those who would be sent home. As the camp was closed, tensions mounted and RPA troops opened fire on some of the remaining refugees. \n\nThere were no foreign troops or reporters in Kibeho in 1994.\n\nAustralian and Zambian troops of the United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda (UNAMIR) and staff from International Aid Agencies witnessed the massacre.\n\nMany of these were killed in the same school in which the apparitions had occurred; one of the children who reported the vision was even one of the victims. The local bishop recognized officially on 29 June 2001 three cases as authentic. The church \"Notre-Dame des Douleurs\" (Our Lady of Sorrows) was built in Kibeho, supported by Pallottines.\n\nKibeho Massacre\n\n"}

Jesus has just begun preaching in Galilee and has encountered the fishermen Simon Peter and Andrew. In this verse he calls the pair to join him.\n\nThe original Koine Greek, according to Westcott and Hort, reads:\n\nIn the King James Version of the Bible the text reads:\n\nThe World English Bible translates the passage as:\n\nFor a collection of other versions see BibleHub Matthew 4:19\n\nThe phrase \"fishers of men,\" also at Mark 1:17, is one of the most well known lines in the entire New Testament, and the most important metaphor for evangelism. The image probably had an important role in the adoption of the Ichthys as a symbol of early Christianity. The reference has also often been moved from the disciples to Jesus, with him being called the \"fisher of men,\" and the image of Jesus as a fisherman is second only to that of Jesus as a shepherd.\n\nThe translation \"fishers of men\" is well known and used by most authors, but not wholly accurate in a modern context inasmuch as the original Greek is gender neutral. Translators also prefer to avoid the word \"fisher\", since \"fisherman\" has replaced it as the standard term in English, though in recent years \"fisher\" has gained some currency as a gender neutral term for fishermen.\n\nA similar reference to fishing occurs at Jeremiah 16:16, upon which this passage might be based. In Jeremiah the reference is to hunting down sinners, in the Gospels it seems to be a milder metaphor of saving souls. The basic interpretation of the metaphor as referring to the disciples working to catch souls for Jesus as they had previously caught fish is universally agreed upon, there are, however, a number of views of the exact meaning of the metaphor. The metaphor has a somewhat different meaning depending on one's view of the type of fishing the disciples participated in. Wallace argues that the common view of fishing with a line and hook and bringing each fish in individually is misplaced, Simon and Andrew would have used nets to fish and would have brought in large numbers of fish at once through grand acts. Wuellner presents an alternate view arguing that the disciples may have caught fish individually, and even by hand. Manek believes that to fully appreciate the metaphor one must understand how the sea was viewed at the time. He argues that throughout the Old Testament the sea is presented as unholy, to create life God first needed to push away the seas, and in stories, such as that of Jonah, the depths of the sea are portrayed as being synonymous with the underworld. Thus the act of fishing brings the fish from the domain of sin and death to that of God. Similarly the disciples are tasked with bringing souls from sin and evil into the domain of God. The water reference might also be linked to the idea of baptism, which in is explicitly linked to the disciples' mission.\n\nManek also notes that some question whether the metaphor has the universal meaning that is usually understood. Some scholars believe that Jesus only called Simon and Andrew to be fishers because they already had these skills, that is Jesus had met a teacher he would have asked them to teach for him and if he had met a soldier he would have asked him to do battle for him.\n\nThe term \"follow me\" refers to following as a disciple would a Rabbi. Any good Rabbi or teacher would have a group of disciples around him learning and doing tasks for their master. France notes that Jesus' statement is unusual as it invites the disciples to take an active part in his ministry. While both Greek and Jewish religious leaders were traditionally surrounded by a group of disciples it was more common for the disciples to search out a teacher, and for a teacher to express indifference to their followers. This verse clearly depicts Jesus' actively recruiting his followers.\n\nAs such a famous verse it has appeared a number of times in art and culture. Among literary works that reference the verse are Chaucer's \"Summoner's Tale\", Byron's \"Don Juan\", Tennyson's \"Harold\", Joyce's \"A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man\", and G.K. Chesterton's \"The Innocence of Father Brown.\"\n\n"}

The popularity of hard trance peaked during the late 1990s, and has since then faded in scope of newer forms of trance.\n\nHard trance is often characterized by strong, hard (or even downpitch) kicks, fully resonant basses and an increased amount of reverberation applied to the main beat. Melodies vary from 140 to 180 in tempo, and can feature plain instrumental sound in early compositions, with the latter ones tending to implement side-chaining techniques of progressive on digital synthesizers.\n\nHard trance was the final form of progressive to hit the mainstream. It eventually morphed into hardstyle, jumpstyle and gabber. Although hard trance is still made and listened to by many people, its social appeal has undoubtedly waned considerably since the mid-2000s.\n\nThe hard trance sound developed out of the breakbeat hardcore/hardcore era which itself developed from Belgian New Beat industrial style of Techno. When the hardcore breakbeat production community split into its separate subgenres, hard trance began to develop within the breakbeat hardcore production community. Hard trance went on to become one of the dominant and most successful electronic music styles throughout the 1990s in mainland Europe and around the world. The British electronic music scene split off into other styles such as jungle/drum and bass, hardcore, techno and house.\n\n\nRemaining popular around 1993–1997 in mainland Europe, hard trance was associated with mega-raves of many thousands of ravers. Many series of compilation CDs came initially from the originators of the sound and the clubs that promoted it. It ultimately went overground and reached commercial status becoming known commercially as \"maximaal\".\n\nThroughout the 1990s the popularity of the sound caused a flurry of popular and financially successful tracks to be licensed by major record labels, the sound eventually becoming aggressively marketed through commercial compilations on TV, radio and across the different forms of media.\n\nHard trance saw the similar pattern of success that also occurred to other underground electronic musical styles that became commercially successful throughout the 1990s.\n\nThe sound becomes formulaic as popular elements of previous successful tracks, become overused and a standard musical template forms.\n\nThe user-base and production community tire of the new generic overground sound and it becomes tainted by success. This causes a creative movement away from the style, which now appeals to a wider music buying customer base bringing profitability, however the sound suffers as it becomes generic and derivative and a caricature of its former creative self.\n\nThe production community and the original fanbase move onto more creative and less clichéd electronic music styles, sales drop, causing the major labels to drop the artists and sub labels and the music moves back into the underground.\n\nThe sound may continue with a smaller community of customers bringing fewer profits but music once again creating for non commercial reasons, the music either continues to develop or the style disappears often to be rediscovered and recreated with a hybrid or updated style later by a future electronic music community.\n\n\nThe hard trance sound came to the UK via the underground techno community in clubs such as Heaven, Trade, Melt and FF and Fist or through clubs such as The Omen in Morley and Club UK in London. It never reached the same commercial heights or as on the continental mainland due to British music scene already being widely diversified into styles such as jungle/drum & bass, hardcore and house.\n\nAlongside the birth of hard trance, the same producers and record labels were already producing and developing the jumpstyle sound, the successor of gabber, which was popular in the Netherlands. Jumpstyle used the same sounds as the hard trance sound with faster beat patterns but slightly slower than gabber, this developed directly into hardstyle toward the end of the 1990s, which along hardtechno and hard house came to dominate the harder spectrum of electronic music.\n\nThe sound influenced and led to the development of UK hard house and its subgenres, prior to this style the UK clubs where hard house developed were typically already playing a mixture of harder techno styles, progressive trance, electro and hardstyle incorporating many sounds and influences from each style can be heard across the others.\n\nJointly with Happy Hardcore it derived into makina\n\n\n"}

There he rose rapidly from instructor to associate professor and, in 1963, to professor of church history. He was appointed Winn Professor of Ecclesiastical History at Harvard in 1964 and continued teaching there until 1966.

Later in life, Oberman founded the Division for Late Medieval and Reformation Studies at the University of Arizona. His major books include \"The Harvest of Medieval Theology: Gabriel Biel and Late Medieval Nominalism\" (1963), which articulated his program of bridging the gap between the later Middle Ages and Reformation era (at least in the field of theology), and an iconoclastic biography of Martin Luther, translated from German as \"Luther: Man Between God and the Devil\" (1989). About Luther, Oberman wrote: \"There is no way to grasp Luther's milieu of experience and faith unless one has an acute sense of his view of Christian existence between God and the Devil: without a recognition of Satan's power, belief in Christ is reduced to an idea about Christ – and Luther's faith becomes a confused delusion in keeping with the tenor of his time.\" (Oberman, Heiko (1989). \"Luther: Man Between God and the Devil\". Yale University Press. p. 104.) He died on 22 April 2001.\n\nNumerous honorary degrees and affiliations in the United States and abroad pay homage to Oberman's stature as a scholar and an educator. He became member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1963. In 1996, the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences awarded him the prestigious Dr A.H.

In order to ensure the success of the truck of Goldberg, Clear Channel contracted the team of Tom Meents (who was already popular from driving Monster Patrol and Bulldozer) to build and campaign the \"Goldberg\" truck. Meents debuted in the truck in January 2000 at the Georgia Dome, where he won racing and finished third in freestyle. As the year progressed, and as Dennis Anderson struggled in Grave Digger, Meents dominated and capped the year by winning the first Monster Jam World Finals Racing Championship. The following year saw a continuation of the dominance, when Meents won the world racing and freestyle championships.\n\nIn 2001, WCW was bought out by the World Wrestling Federation and the deal with Clear Channel was dropped. For 2002, Meents kept the same truck and body but renamed the truck Team Meents, even retaining much of Goldberg's color scheme and graphics. Once again, Meents swept both the racing and freestyle at World Finals 3.\n\nIn 2003, saw the truck change both name and image to become Maximum Destruction, a name which Meents had intended to run the year before until he delayed those plans out of respect for the September 11 attacks. Neil Elliot began driving a second truck for the team that year as well. The team has remained significantly popular, and is now generally introduced as the chief rival of Grave Digger, the tours' most popular team.\nIn 2005 Meents jumped Maximum Destruction over his old house, before destroying the house with the truck.\n\nIn 2013, Maximum Destruction celebrated 10 years. The trucks were painted in a new livery featuring spikes around the body, and the truck began to be known as \"Max-D\". At World Finals 14, Meents won freestyle in Max-D, earning his 11th World Finals Championship.\n\nIn 2016, Meents's two stepsons, Colton and Jared Eichelberger, joined the team. At World Finals 17, both Meents and Colton competed in the main events while Jared competed in the Young Guns Shootout. During the racing encore, Meents jumped his truck over five monster trucks. In an attempt to break this record, he tried to jump over six trucks in April at Levis Stadium, though the trucks were positioned to either side of the area Meents was jumping, thus not breaking the record. This was mainly because of the conditions of the muddy track. He later reattempted this, successfully jumping over six trucks later in the same month at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey.\n\nIn 2017, Meents sustained an injury and was unable to compete. Due to his injury, Meents did not compete in World Finals 18. Dennis Anderson also sustained an injury, making this the first time where Meents and Anderson both did not compete in the World Finals; Anderson would retire after that season.\n\nIn 2018, at World Finals 19, the Max-D team celebrated their 15-year anniversary of the truck with a special encore after competition ended, featuring all the Max-D trucks throughout the past years, including the original Maximum Destruction truck.\n\nSince the truck debuted as Goldberg, the truck has become known for bouncy and wild rides, and for its ability to make large jumps and take several hits during freestyle runs and not suffer significant damage. The truck is also known for its numerous crashes, often simply as a result of Meents' full-throttle driving. Meents' driving style is emulated by the other drivers, who are said to have graduated from the \"Tom Meents School of Monster Truck Driving\".\n\nMaximum Destruction is one of the few teams in the modern monster truck industry to use a front-mounted engines.\n\nDuring the freestyle portion of a European tour event in Gothenburg, Sweden, Meents hit the backside of a 'step up' jump which caused the truck to rotate backwards, land on the roof at the top of the obstacle and then continue to roll backwards back onto the wheels where Meents continued his run. This inspired drivers to attempt a complete aerial backflip. Travis Pastrana made an attempt during a Season 1 episode of \"Nitro Circus\" using a purpose-built ramp. However, the truck did not get enough rotation and slammed down onto the roof from about 40 feet in the air; Pastran was uninjured.\n\nIn 2009, at World Finals 10 in Las Vegas, Meents rolled on to the floor during the encore in Maximum Destruction. Nobody knew what he was going to do until he launched his truck off the backside of the center jump, which was almost a solid wall of dirt. The truck instantly bounced up into the air and managed to rotate one and half times backwards until landing on the tailgate, resulting in the truck rolling onto its roof. Although spectacular, it did not technically count because he did not land on his tires. It was later revealed in a special DVD release about Meents' build up to the backflip at the World Finals, that he had, in fact, landed a complete backflip in his backyard during testing. Therefore, Meents was the first to land a successful backflip. In 2010, Cam McQueen, driving Pastrana's Nitro Circus truck, completed a backflip in Jacksonville, Florida. This was the first backflip landed in competition.\n\nSince then, there have been many successful and unsuccessful attempts from several drivers. A few drivers have even completed corkscrew type flips where the truck backflips and lands facing the opposite direction. Linsey Weenk, driver of the Lucas Oil Crusader truck, was the first driver to land two backflips in one scored freestyle run.\n\nAfter George Balhan, driver of Mohawk Warrior, landed two consecutive backflips at the 2012 Monster Jam World Finals, Meents was driven to land the double. After months of preparation at his shop in Paxton, Illinois, on June 16, 2012, at the last show of the Monster Jam Path of Destruction Tour at Metlife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, Meents came out in a modified Maximum Destruction stunt truck, built specifically for the double backflip. When Meents hit the jump, his truck completed one rotation, but started to twist in the second rotation then landing on the roof, coming up just short. Then, on Saturday, March 23, 2013, he attempted it again in the encore portion of Monster Jam World Finals 14. The truck landed on the sides of the left side tires, and bounced into a perfect landing, becoming the first successful double backflip. A double backflip has yet to be landed in competition.\n\nSince the debut of the Maximum Destruction name in 2003, there have been 11 trucks fielded by the team:\n\n\nAdditionally, the Maximum Destruction body design has been used on chassis owned by Monster Jam parent Feld Entertainment for international tours; these do not feature the front-mounted engine usually used by the team.\n\n\n\n\nNOTE: All championships have been won by Meents.\n\n\n"}

The team was one of the eight founding members of the American Association.\n\nThe Blues did not field particularly competitive teams until 1918, when they won the AA pennant. The team won again in 1923, and again in 1929. They won the Junior World Series championship both years, defeating the Baltimore Orioles (minor league) and the Rochester Red Wings of the International League, respectively, in best-of-nine series.\n\nIn 1935, the Blues became a farm club of the Pittsburgh Pirates. In 1936 they became an affiliate of the New York Yankees. They won the AA championships five times in the 1930s and 1940s. They defeated the Newark Bears (International League), another Yankees farm club, in the 1938 Junior World Series.\n\nWhen the American League Philadelphia Athletics moved to Kansas City in 1955, the Blues moved to Denver, Colorado, and became the Denver Bears.\n\nThe 1923, 1929, and 1939 Blues were recognized as being among the 100 greatest minor league teams of all time.\n\nThe Kansas City Blues were admitted to the American Association in 1902, and won their first league championship in 1918. They'd win two more, one in 1923 and the second in 1928. However, the onset of The Great Depression took a toll on the team as attendance began to fall. At one point, the Blues lead the league in attendance, but that number would soon be cut in half. Frustrated with how things were going in Kansas City, owner George Muehlebach sold the franchise to a group headed by Hollywood actor Joe E. Brown, and included former MLB star Tris Speaker. Speaker would also serve as the team's manager. The change in ownership did little to spark interest in the team and Speaker was replaced as manager with Nick Allen. who'd won a championship with St. Paul. The franchise was sold again, this time to Kansas City resident and former Cubs player Johnny Kling who in turn hired Roger Peckinbaugh, who'd just been released as manager by the Cleveland Indians to take over as manager for Kansas City.\n\nThe Blues still struggled with attendance, though it did improve, even if Kansas City finished in last place. Another change was made as Peckinbaugh was released and Dutch Zwilling, who piloted the Blues to their 1929 championship, was brought back as manager. The Blues began to rise in the league standings and the attendance rose as well. Another ownership change was afoot as Kling sold the franchise to the New York Yankees who quickly made the Blues one of their farm teams. The home opener in 1939 was a near sell out and the fans went home happy, as outfielder Vince Dimaggio hit a home run in his first at bat. The Blues routed Louisville 8-2 en route to a season that saw Kansas City win 107 games. However, the Blues lost to Indianapolis in the play offs. One of the stars of the Blues that season was a 21 year old shortstop named Phil Rizzuto.\n\nThe Blues would never have a team as great as the 1939 squad again, but the team was a launching pad for future major league players like Johnny Lindell and in later years, Mickey Mantle. And by the 1950s it was over for the Blues altogether, as the franchise ceased once the A's moved from Philadelphia to Kansas City.\n\nHall of Fame alumni\n\nPlayers and managers\nWell-known members of the 1929 Junior World Series-winning Kansas City Blues included:\n\nOther well-known players and managers include: \n\n"}

{"id": "2169225", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2169225", "title": "Ulster nationalism", "text": "Ulster nationalism\n\nUlster nationalism is a minor school of thought in Northern Ireland politics that seeks the independence of Northern Ireland from the United Kingdom without joining the Republic of Ireland, thereby becoming an independent sovereign state separate from both.\n\nIndependence has been supported by groups such as Ulster Third Way and some factions of the Ulster Defence Association. However, it is a fringe view in Northern Ireland. It is neither supported by any of the political parties represented in the Northern Ireland Assembly nor by the government of the United Kingdom or the government of the Republic of Ireland.\n\nAlthough the term Ulster traditionally refers to one of the four traditional provinces of Ireland which contains Northern Ireland as well as parts of the Republic of Ireland, the term is often used within unionism and Ulster loyalism (from which Ulster nationalism originated) to refer to Northern Ireland.\n\nIn November 1921, during negotiations for the Anglo-Irish Treaty, there was correspondence between David Lloyd George and Sir James Craig, respective prime ministers of the UK and Northern Ireland. Lloyd George envisaged a choice for Northern Ireland between, on the one hand, remaining part of the UK under the Government of Ireland Act 1920, while what had been Southern Ireland became a Dominion; and, on the other hand, becoming part of an all-Ireland Dominion where the Stormont parliament was subordinate to a parliament in Dublin instead of Westminster. Craig responded that a third option would be for Northern Ireland to be a Dominion in parallel with Southern Ireland and the \"Overseas Dominions\", saying \"while Northern Ireland would deplore any loosening of the tie between Great Britain and herself she would regard the loss of representation at Westminster as a less evil than inclusion in an all-Ireland Parliament\".\n\nUlster nationalism has its origins in 1946 when W. F. McCoy, a former cabinet minister in the government of Northern Ireland, advocated this option. He wanted Northern Ireland to become a dominion with a political system similar to Canada, New Zealand, Australia and the then Union of South Africa, or the Irish Free State prior to 1937. McCoy, a lifelong member of the Ulster Unionist Party, felt that the uncertain constitutional status of Northern Ireland made the Union vulnerable and so saw his own form of limited Ulster nationalism as a way to safeguard Northern Ireland's relationship with the United Kingdom.\n\nSome members of the Ulster Vanguard movement, led by Bill Craig, in the early 1970s published similar arguments, most notably Professor Kennedy Lindsay. In the early 1970s, in the face of the British government prorogation of the government of Northern Ireland, Craig, Lindsay and others argued in favour of a unilateral declaration of independence (UDI) from Great Britain similar to that declared in Rhodesia a few years previously. Lindsay later founded the British Ulster Dominion Party to this end but it faded into obscurity around 1979.\n\nWhilst early versions of Ulster nationalism had been designed to safeguard the status of Northern Ireland, the movement saw something of a rebirth in the 1970s, particularly following the 1972 suspension of the Parliament of Northern Ireland and the resulting political uncertainty in the region. Glenn Barr, a Vanguard Unionist Progressive Party Assemblyman and Ulster Defence Association leader, described himself in 1973 as \"an Ulster nationalist\". The successful Ulster Workers Council Strike in 1974, (which was directed by Barr), was later described by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Merlyn Rees as an \"outbreak of Ulster nationalism\". Labour Prime Minister Jim Callaghan also thought an independent Ulster might be viable.\n\nAfter the strike loyalism began to embrace Ulster nationalist ideas, with the UDA, in particular, advocating this position. Firm proposals for an independent Ulster were produced in 1976 by the Ulster Loyalist Central Co-ordinating Committee and in 1977 by the UDA's New Ulster Political Research Group. The NUPRG document, \"Beyond the Religious Divide\", has been recently republished with a new introduction. John McMichael, as candidate for the UDA-linked Ulster Loyalist Democratic Party, campaigned for the 1982 South Belfast by-election on the basis of negotiations towards independence. However, McMichael's poor showing of 576 votes saw the plans largely abandoned by the UDA soon after, although the policy was still considered by the Ulster Democratic Party under Ray Smallwoods. A short-lived Ulster Independence Party also operated, although the assassination of its leader, John McKeague, in 1982 saw it largely disappear.\n\nWhile Ulster nationalism went into something of a decline in loyalist circles following the South Belfast by-election, the issue became a matter of policy for the Official National Front, as the Political Soldier wing of the British National Front was known. During the 1980s the group produced a document entitled \"Alternative Ulster – Facing Up to the Future\", which laid out plans for how independence could be achieved and how the independent state would function. Arguing that Ulster represented a nation distinct from the rest of Ireland, and Great Britain, they called for an independent state to be run by a series of Community Councils, with an economy based on distributism. Despite the plans, the NF never had more than minor support in the region and the plans failed to reach a wider audience.\n\nThe idea enjoyed something of a renaissance in the aftermath of the Anglo-Irish Agreement, with the Ulster Clubs amongst those to consider the notion. After a series of public meetings, leading Ulster Clubs member, Reverend Hugh Ross, set up the Ulster Independence Committee in 1988, which soon re-emerged as the Ulster Independence Movement advocating full independence of Ulster from Great Britain. After a reasonable showing in the 1990 Upper Bann by-election, the group stepped up its campaigning in the aftermath of the Downing Street Declaration and enjoyed a period of increased support immediately after the Belfast Agreement (also absorbing the Ulster Movement for Self-Determination, which desired all of Ulster as the basis for independence, along the way). No tangible electoral success was gained however, and the group was further damaged by allegations against Ross in a Channel 4 documentary on collusion, \"The Committee\", leading to the group reconstituting as a ginger group in 2000.\n\nWith the UIM defunct, Ulster nationalism was then represented by the Ulster Third Way, which was involved in the publication of the \"Ulster Nation\", a journal of radical Ulster nationalism. Ulster Third Way, which registered as a political party in February 2001, was the Northern Ireland branch of the UK-wide Third Way, albeit with much stronger emphasis on the Northern Ireland question. Ulster Third Way contested the West Belfast parliamentary seat in the 2001 general election, although candidate and party leader David Kerr failed to attract much support.\n\nNorthern Irish independence is still seen by some members of society as a way of moving forward in terms of the political crisis that continues to haunt Northern Irish politics even today. Some economists and politicians see an independent state as viable but others believe that Northern Ireland would not survive unless it had the support of the United Kingdom or the Republic of Ireland. Although it is not supported by a political party, around 533,085 declared in the 2011 census to be Northern Irish. This identity does not mean they believe in independence, however in a poll based upon what the future policy for Northern Ireland should be, 15% of the poll voters were in favour of Northern Irish independence.\n\nUlster nationalism represents a reaction from within unionism to the perceived uncertainty of the future of the Union by the British government. Its leadership and members have all been unionists and have tended to react to what they viewed as crises surrounding the status of Northern Ireland as a part of the United Kingdom, such as the moves towards power-sharing in the 1970s or the Belfast Agreement of 1998, which briefly saw the UIM become a minor force. In such instances it has been considered preferable by the supporters of this ideological movement to remove the British dimension either partially (Dominion status) or fully (independence) to avoid a united Ireland.\n\nHowever, whilst support for Ulster nationalism has tended to be reactive to political change, the theory also underlines the importance of Ulster cultural nationalism and the separate identity and culture of Ulster. As such, Ulster nationalist movements have been at the forefront of supporting the Orange Order and supporting contested 12 July marches as important parts of this cultural heritage, as well as encouraging the retention of the Ulster Scots dialects.\n\nOutside traditional Protestant-focused Ulster nationalism, a non-sectarian independent Northern Ireland has sometimes been advocated as a solution to the conflict. Two notable examples of this are the Scottish Marxist Tom Nairn and the Irish nationalist Liam de Paor.\n\n\n"}

Hayes House, Rutherford B. Hayes Summer Home and Rutherford B. Hayes State Memorial was the estate of Rutherford B. Hayes, the nineteenth President of the United States, located at the corner of Hayes and Buckland Avenues in Fremont, Ohio. \"Spiegel\" is the German and Dutch word for \"mirror\". The traditional story is that the estate was named by Hayes' uncle Sardis Birchard, who first built it for his own residence. He named it for the reflective pools of water that collected on the property after a rain shower. \n\nRutherford Hayes inherited the estate and moved there in 1873. He died in 1893 and was buried in Oakwood Cemetery next to his wife who had died in 1889. Following the gift of this home to the state of Ohio for the Spiegel Grove State Park, their bodies were reinterred at Spiegel Grove in 1915. They are buried at a memorial on the property. The Rutherford B. Hayes Presidential Center, established in 1916, is also located here. \n\n\"\"Old Whitey\"\", a war horse that served during the Civil War and belonged to then-Major (later Major General) Hayes, became the mascot of the 23rd Ohio Volunteer Infantry. The horse was buried at Spiegel Grove upon his death in 1879, with a grave marker reading \"Old Whitey A Hero of Nineteen Battles 1861-1865\".\n\nSpiegel Grove was designated as a National Historic Landmark on January 29, 1964.\n\nOn October 15, 1966, it was added to the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nThe house was built around 1860 for Sardis Birchard as a two-story brick mansion. It featured many bedrooms and a wrap-around porch. In 1880, after Rutherford B. Hayes had moved in, he expanded the house by the addition of 5 new rooms, and the massive staircase that led all the way up to the 4th floor. In 1889, 6 more rooms were added to the house, giving it its current appearance. After the expansions, the house had more than 30 rooms and of living space.\n\nThe estate was given to the state for the Spiegel Grove State Park. Since then, the house has been open for tourists as a house museum. For a fee, visitors can view the various rooms as well as furniture, books, and other items in the house.

{"id": "2169249", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2169249", "title": "ABA League", "text": "ABA League\n\nThe ABA League, renamed to the ABA League First Division in 2017, commonly known as the Adriatic League First Division, is the 1st-tier regional men's professional basketball league that originally featured clubs from the former Yugoslavia (Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Serbia and Slovenia). Due to sponsorship reasons, the league was also known as the Goodyear League from 2001 to 2006, and as the NLB League from 2006 to 2011.\n\nThe league coexists alongside scaled-down national leagues in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, North Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia, and Slovenia. All but one of Adriatic League clubs join their country's own competitions in late spring after the Adriatic League regular season and post-season have been completed. In the past, the league has also consisted of clubs from Bulgaria (Levski), the Czech Republic (ČEZ Nymburk), Hungary (Szolnoki Olaj), and Israel (Maccabi FOX) that received wild card invitations.\n\nThe Adriatic League is a private venture, founded in 2001 and run until 2015 by the Sidro, a Slovenian limited liability company. Since 2015, the league has been operated by ABA League JTD, a Zagreb-based general partnership for organizing sports competitions. Adriatic Basketball Association is the body that organizes the league and is a full member of ULEB, as well as a voting member of Euroleague Basketball's board.\n\nAt various points throughout mid-to-late 1990s, in the years following the breakup of SFR Yugoslavia and ensuing Yugoslav Wars, different basketball administrators from the newly independent Balkan states floated and informally discussed the idea of re-assembling a joint basketball competition to fill the void left by the dissolution of the former Yugoslav Basketball League whose last season was 1991–92.\n\nHowever, no concrete action towards that end was taken before the summer 2000 ULEB-supported creation of Euroleague Basketball Company under the leadership of Jordi Bertomeu that immediately confronted FIBA Europe, then proceeded to take a handful of top European clubs into its new competition for the 2000–01 season thereby opening an organizational split in European club basketball. During the 2000–01 split in the continent's top club competition, local Balkan basketball administrators from the ULEB-affiliated clubs Cibona, Olimpija, and Budućnost (that already competed in this new 'breakaway' Euroleague competition) shifted the discussions of creating a regional Balkan-wide basketball league into higher gear.\n\nOn the public relations front, Adriatic League was met with strong and mixed reactions. Though many hailed it as an important step for the development of club basketball in the Balkans region, many others felt that it brings no new quality and that it's not worth dismantling three domestic leagues. There was a lot of negative reaction from political circles, especially in Croatia, with even TV panel discussions being broadcast on Croatian state television. A very vociferous opinion in the country saw the league's formation as a political attempt to reinstate Yugoslavia. The league organizers for their part did their best to appease the Croatian public with statements such as the one delivered by Radovan Lorbek in \"Slobodna Dalmacija\" in September 2001: \nTen years later, in a 2011 interview for the Serbian newspaper \"Press\", Roman Lisac explained the league's behind the scenes strategy during its nascent stages was actually quite different: \nOn 28 September 2001, the league announced a five-year sponsorship deal with Slovenian company Sava Tires from Kranj, a subsidiary of Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company. The deal also included naming rights, hence from 2001 until 2006, the competition was known as the Goodyear League.\n\nWith twelve clubs taking part in the inaugural 2001–02 season, the competition commenced in fall 2001 with four teams from Slovenia, four teams from Croatia, three teams from Bosnia-Herzegovina, and one team from FR Yugoslavia. The very first game was contested in Ljubljana between Olimpija and Široki on Saturday, 29 September 2001 at 5:30pm.\n\nThough the competition purported to gather the strongest sides from former Yugoslavia, as mentioned, teams from Serbia were noticeably absent, particularly Belgrade powerhouses and biggest regional crowd draws Partizan and Crvena zvezda. In addition to no clubs from Serbia proper, the league had no Serb-dominated clubs from Bosnia-Herzegovina either. Since the league founders mostly avoided talking about the issue due to fears of media backlash, the fact that no invitations were extended to Serbian clubs was generally explained through security issues due to organizers' fears of crowd trouble if Croatian and Serbian clubs were to start playing again in the same competition. Then in early February 2002, the public got a preview of just that when Cibona and Partizan met in Zagreb as part of that season's EuroLeague group stage. In a nationalistically charged and incident-filled encounter, Croatian fans peppered the Partizan players with rocks, flares, and even ceramic tiles before physically assaulting Partizan head coach Duško Vujošević in the guest team dressing room after the game.\n\nThe Adriatic League debut season was marked by dwindling attendances and lukewarm media support. Still the league did receive a bit of a shot in the arm on 24 February 2002, when its managing body ABA got accepted as full member of ULEB.\n\nFor the 2002–03 season, the league remained at the total number of 12 teams, while it went through major re-tooling internally. By the time season started, four teams dropped out (Sloboda Dita, Budućnost, Triglav, and Geoplin Slovan) to be replaced by: Israeli powerhouse Maccabi Tel Aviv, Crvena zvezda (the first team from Serbia in the competition), the Bosnian outfit KK Borac, and Croatian club KK Zagreb.\n\nIt was important for the league's long term business to negotiate acceptable terms for the Serbian clubs to join the competition. To that end, Lorbek and Lisac went to Belgrade in early April 2002 with an offer of taking in three clubs from FR Yugoslavia for the Adriatic League's 2002–03 season. The offer was flatly rejected initially by the representatives of five YUBA Liga clubs – Partizan, Crvena zvezda, Hemofarm, FMP, and Budućnost – as their unified platform was either all five or nothing. Taking in all five required expanding the league to 14 teams, which was something the league organizers weren't prepared to do due to the associated increase in operating costs. The negotiated agreement thus fell through for the time being. However, it didn't take long for dents to appear in the unified front put forth by five YUBA league clubs – in May 2002 Crvena zvezda's management (three businessmen close to the ruling Democratic Party in Serbia: Živorad Anđelković, Igor Žeželj, and Goran Vesić) hired Zmago Sagadin to be the club's new general manager – and soon after, in June 2002, the club broke the ranks by negotiating terms on its own thus agreeing to join the Adriatic League for the 2002–03 season.\n\nAs of the 2013–14 season the league comprises a 26-game regular season, with the top 4 sides making the play-offs.\n\nFrom 2002 through 2004, four teams qualified, and the playoffs were termed the \"Final Four\"; starting in 2005, eight teams advanced to the \"Final Eight\" round. All playoff rounds consist of one-off knockout matches, unusual among European leagues. However, since all Adriatic League clubs play in domestic leagues at the same time, and many also play in the EuroLeague, the current format has the virtue of limiting fixture congestion for the playoff sides.\n\nIn 2017, the ABA League Second Division was created. The last qualified team from ABA League would be relegated to the Second Division and replaced by the winner of this one.\n\n2019–20 ABA season:\n\nSource\n\nThe following is a list of clubs who have played in the Adriatic League at any time since its formation in 2001 to the current season.

Having retired with the rank of General, he was approached on April 18, 1964 by his former colleague General George Grivas and offered the leadership of the newly formed Greek Cypriot Cypriot National Guard, which post Karayiannis accepted. From April to August 1964 Karayiannis commanded and organised the Cypriot National Guard, whose stated mission was to defend the island against possible Turkish military invasion, and to counter the paramilitary forces of the Turkish Cypriot group known as Turkish Resistance Organization or TMT.\n\nGrivas arrived in Cyprus himself on June 10, 1964 and used the popularity he gained in Cyprus and Greece during the EOKA era to coerce the governments of Greece and Cyprus into appointing him supreme military commander of Cyprus. On July 22 Grivas set himself up in an office at the National Guard headquarters and began to issue orders directly to National Guard units. This incensed Karayiannis who submitted his resignation, which was not accepted.\n\nOn July 4 negotiations on the Cyprus dispute began in Geneva between representatives of the United States, Greek and Turkish governments, with the presence of the United Nations. Special advisor to the US representation was Dean Acheson, and those US proposals eventually became known as the \"Acheson plan\". Karayiannis and Grivas were recalled to Athens on August 5 to confer with the Greek government. Karayiannis reports that he and Grivas were counselled by Minister of Defense Petros Garoufalias to exercise all restraint, as \"Enosis\" was imminent, and to seek the counsel of the Greek government before any action which might lead to escalation. Grivas was to return to Cyprus on August 6, and Karayiannis on August 7.\n\nWhile returning to Cyprus on August 7 on board the Athens-Nicosia airliner, Karayiannis saw shell bursts and smoke in the Kokkina area. On arrival he headed immediately for the Headquarters of the National Guard which he found on full war alert. General Grivas informed Karayiannis that the Swedish battalion of the UN Forces in Cyprus had abandoned their positions on the hill known as Akoni in the Kokkina area on August 6, that Cypriot National Guard units which took their place came under fire from units of the TMT stationed on the nearby hill known as Lourovouno, and that therefore Grivas had ordered an attack on Lourovouno for the morning of August 7. Karayiannis reports that he later found out that the attack on Lourovouno had been ordered without the Greek government having been informed, and that Grivas had misled Makarios and the Council of Ministers of the Republic of Cyprus into thinking he would obtain authorisation from Greece before acting. Karayiannis was once more incensed at Grivas. He became even more incensed when he found out that the attack had been badly organised, so that it had only started at 3:30pm instead of the planned time in the morning, and therefore failed to achieve its objectives by nightfall.\n\nDuring that night Grivas ordered a large number of forces into the Kokkina area and ordered an attack for the next morning. Lourovouno was taken by 07:45 on the morning of August 8. Still without authorisation from Greece, but with the support of Makarios, Grivas escalated operations, with the objective of taking over the entire Kokkina enclave. At 10:05, Grivas was ordered by signal from the General National Defense Staff of Greece to cease offensive operations at that time, which order he ignored. Later the same day, Greek Prime Minister Georgios Papandreou sent a message to Makarios expressing his disapproval of the latter's initiatives. While Grivas went to the field of operations, Karayiannis, who was insisting that the orders of the Greek government to suspend offensive operations be obeyed, remained at the Headquarters of the National Guard in Nicosia.\n\nAt 16:15 on the afternoon of August 8, the Turkish Air Force attacked the Cypriot National Guard formations in the Kokkina area, against no significant resistance as the National Guard operated no aircraft and had very rudimentary anti-aircraft capability. Grivas, who was present in the area, did all he could to prevent the panicking National Guardsmen from abandoning their positions. When the air attacks ceased two hours later, Grivas returned to his office at the Headquarters of the National Guard in Nicosia.\n\nAt 20:00 the Council of Ministers of the Republic of Cyprus convened, with the presence of Makarios, Grivas and Karayiannis. Grivas proposed, and the Council agreed to, an all-out night attack to take over the Kokkina enclave. Karayiannis intervened, asking Grivas whether he had any idea, if such an order were issued, as to when and how it would be carried out by units in the field. Grivas was forced to admit that he could not order an attack for earlier than the afternoon of the next day, August 9. Karayiannis also protested that the Government of the Republic of Cyprus was undertaking offensive initiatives without counsel with the government of Greece, despite prior agreements. The Minister of Interior and Defense of the Republic of Cyprus, Polycarpos Georgadjis, replied by submitting his resignation because, though Karayiannis was leader of the Cypriot National Guard, he was taking orders from Minister of Defense Garoufalias in Greece rather than Georkadjis. The resignation was not accepted.\n\nAfter 21:00 Grivas returned to his office at the Headquarters of the Cypriot National Guard and, in the presence of Georkadjis, Karayiannis and others, submitted his resignation, describing himself as a \"renegade\" for not obeying the orders of the Greek government. He then left his office. Karayiannis immediately ordered all units to regroup, maintain positions and await further orders.\n\nAt 10:00 on the morning of August 9, the Turkish Air Force resumed its operations in the Kokkina area and extended them to civilian targets in the region. Napalm attacks on the villages of Pyrgos, Pigenia, Pachyammos, Pomos and the town of Polis Chrysochous killed 53 and injured 125 civilians. The Turkish Air Force also mistakenly attacked Kokkina itself. The Council of Ministers of the Republic of Cyprus, in an emergency session with Makarios presiding, decided to issue an ultimatum to the Turkish government warning that unless air attacks stopped, a general attack on Turkish Cypriot villages by the Cypriot National Guard would be ordered, and asked General Karayiannis to select two villages for destruction in case the ultimatum was not heeded. Karayiannis reports that he refused the order, saying that he was an army officer and not an executioner of innocent people.\n\nDuring the night of August 9 the military crisis was defused by an intervention of the UN Security Council. All units were ordered to stand down. Only then did Grivas return to his office, having been absent throughout the critical events of August 9. He announced that he was assuming supreme military command of Cyprus once more. Karayiannis reported to him on events during the day and preparations to face a possible landing by the Turkish army, whereupon Grivas instructed Karayiannis not to move a single platoon without his personal approval.\n\nBefore, and during, the Kokkina crisis, Karayiannis found himself charged with duties to both the government of the Republic of Cyprus and of Greece, which became contradictory because of the lack of agreement between the two governments. He also found that Polycarpos Georgadjis and George Grivas interfered with the discharge of his duties. He made his position clear in the account of events he submitted to the government of the Republic of Cyprus immediately after the Kokkina events. Immediately afterwards, he submitted a letter of resignation to Makarios III. Makarios asked Karayiannis to reconsider his decision, which Karayiannis promised to do after returning to Greece to consult with the Greek government. Presumably, Makarios wished Karayiannis to stay on as Chief of Staff of the Cypriot National Guard as a counterweight to Supreme Military Commander Grivas, who Makarios was finding increasingly difficult to deal with. Karayiannis, however, after his return to Greece and consultation with the Greek government, wrote Makarios another letter upholding his decision to resign. Makarios III wrote Karayiannis accepting his resignation and thanking him for his services.\n\nIn June 1965 Karayiannis began a series of articles on his time in Cyprus in the Greek newspaper \"National Herald\", in which he related his account of the facts and accused Grivas of military incompetence, irrational behaviour and psychological weakness. That series of articles, and his report on the Kokkina crisis submitted to the Government of the Republic of Cyprus immediately after events, provide an interesting insight into an important era in the Cyprus dispute and into the personality and actions of George Grivas.\n"}

He played for the Buffalo Sabres, San Jose Sharks, Chicago Blackhawks and Florida Panthers of the National Hockey League (NHL). He won the Stanley Cup with the Blackhawks in 2010, assisting on the deciding goal.\n\nCampbell grew up in Strathroy, Ontario, where he attended elementary school at Colborne Street Public School and high school at Strathroy District Collegiate Institute. He also attended Canterbury High School in Ottawa, while playing for the Ottawa 67's of the Ontario Hockey League (OHL). His parents are Ed and Lorna. He has two brothers, Craig and Darryl. Darryl also played pro hockey for four seasons in the ECHL, lastly for the Mississippi Sea Wolves.\n\nIn 2003, Campbell was quarantined due to a potential SARS outbreak — a relative of Campbell, who worked at a hospital, had visited him just before the relative began to show SARS symptoms and was subsequently hospitalized. This led to the quarantine of both Campbell and then-teammate and roommate Rhett Warrener. Campbell missed three games before being cleared to play again. Neither player had any SARS symptoms.\n\nBrian Campbell and Lauren Miller got engaged during the 2011 NHL All-Star break.\n\nCampbell has been given the nickname \"Soupy\" because he shares his surname with that of the Campbell Soup Company.\n\nCampbell's jersey was retired by the Ottawa 67's' during their 50th anniversary season. It was officially retired on November 3, 2017, at TD Place Arena prior to a game against the Barrie Colts. Campbell is the fifth player to have their number retired by the Ottawa 67's.\n\nCampbell grew up playing minor hockey in his hometown of Strathroy, Ontario, where he won an OMHA Championship at the novice level. He also played AAA hockey for the Elgin-Middlesex Major Bantam Chiefs, along with future NHL teammate Joe Thornton, in 1993–94, which was the organization's inaugural year. In 1994–95, Campbell signed with the Petrolia Jets Jr.B. (OHA) of the Western Ontario Hockey League (WOHL).\n\nFollowing his season with the Jets, Campbell was drafted by the Ottawa 67's. The 67's first-round pick that season was Nick Boynton, who would end up being a defence partner with Campbell for four seasons in Ottawa; they reunited 15 years later as teammates on the 2010 Stanley Cup-winning Chicago Blackhawks.\n\nCampbell was taken by the Ottawa 67's in the OHL as a third-round draft pick in the 1995 OHL Priority Selection. In 1998–99, he won the Red Tilson Trophy as the OHL's Most Outstanding Player. He also won the Max Kaminsky Trophy as the OHL's Defenceman of the Year and the William Hanley Trophy as the OHL's Most Gentlemanly Player, CHL Player of the Year, and finally the Memorial Cup as Ottawa defeated Calgary 7–6 in overtime on home ice.\n\nCampbell was drafted by the Buffalo Sabres as their sixth-round pick in the 1997 NHL Entry Draft. He played his first game for the Sabres in the 1999–2000 season and stayed with the team, wearing number 51, until February 26, 2008, when he was traded to San Jose. During the NHL lockout in 2004–05, he played for Jokerit in the Finnish SM-liiga and won the silver medal in the league championships.\n\nOn January 9, 2007, Campbell was the leading vote-getter amongst Eastern Conference defenceman for the 2007 NHL All-Star Game, earning him his first All-Star appearance. As a result of the Sabres' rotating captaincy policy, Campbell was named an alternate captain for the month of November 2007 and captain for the month of December. Campbell was then selected again to the 2008 NHL All-Star Game.\nThe 2007–08 season was the final season Campbell was under contract with Buffalo. On February 26, 2008, at the NHL trade deadline, the Sabres traded Campbell, along with their seventh-round draft pick in the 2008 NHL Entry Draft (194th overall; Drew Daniels), to the San Jose Sharks in exchange for forward Steve Bernier and their 2008 first-round pick (26th overall; Tyler Ennis). The Sharks were eventually eliminated in the Western Conference Semi-finals by the Dallas Stars, and Campbell became a free agent at the conclusion of the season.\n\nCampbell also led the NHL during the 2007–08 season in games played, being one of just two players to appear in 83 games, or one game more than a team's full schedule, as based on his trade to San Jose; the other was Jeff Halpern. Campbell was named a member of the NHL Competition Committee on April 21, 2008.\n\nOn July 1, 2008, Campbell signed an eight-year contract as an unrestricted free agent with the Chicago Blackhawks for roughly $7.1 million annually. Fox Chicago reported that Campbell chose to sign with the Blackhawks despite allegedly receiving better contract offers from other organizations. He played in all 82 of Chicago's regular-season games in the 2008–09 season, scoring seven goals to go with 45 assists. He contributed two goals with eight assists in 17 Stanley Cup playoff games that season as Chicago advanced to the Western Conference Finals, where they were eliminated by the Detroit Red Wings.\n\nOn March 14, 2010, Campbell was injured in a boarding incident caused by Washington Capitals captain Alexander Ovechkin. Ovechkin was assessed a major penalty and game misconduct for boarding, while Campbell did not return to the game. As a consequence of the illegal boarding hit, Ovechkin was suspended two games by the NHL. Campbell sustained a broken clavicle and broken rib, and was expected to miss seven-to-eight weeks. Despite this, Campbell managed to return by Game 4 of the first round of the 2010 playoffs against the Nashville Predators, igniting the team to a three-game win streak to knock Nashville out of the playoffs, four games to two. Campbell had played in 388 consecutive games prior to the injury. In the Finals, in Game 6, with the Blackhawks up three games to two in the series, Campbell recorded the lone assist on Patrick Kane's overtime game-winner to down the Philadelphia Flyers and clinch the Stanley Cup on June 9, 2010.\n\nDuring the 2011 NHL Entry Draft, Campbell was dealt to the Florida Panthers in exchange for forward Rostislav Olesz.<ref name=\"http://www.chicagonow.com/blogs/blackhawks-red-light-district/2011/06/reports-blackhawks-trade-brian-campbell-to-panthers.html\"></ref> During his first season in Florida, Campbell had 49 assists to go with 4 goals for 53 points and only six penalty minutes, becoming the first defenceman since Red Kelly in the season to win the Lady Byng Memorial Trophy for sportsmanship and gentlemanly conduct combined with a high standard of playing ability.\n\nOn July 1, 2016, Campbell signed a one-year contract as an unrestricted free agent with Chicago for roughly $2 million in base salary, with additional performance-related bonuses included.\n\nOn July 17, 2017, Campbell announced his retirement, but he will join the Blackhawks' business operations department where he will be assisting with various marketing, community relations and youth hockey initiatives.\n\nCampbell was a member of Team Canada at the 1999 World Junior Championships, and was named a First Team All-Star for the tournament. After completion of the Panthers' 2012–13 season, Campbell extended his availability to make his long-awaited senior debut for Canada at the 2013 World Championships in Sweden and Finland.\n"}

In 1995, Harris won the Metros championship, and the New York Golden Gloves two years later. Following these successes, Harris turned professional in 1997.\nHarris made his professional debut on November 4, 1997, when he fought Levi Long and KO'd him in the first minute of the first round. In December of the same year, Harris defeated Adam Salas, forcing the referee to stop the bout prematurely.\n\nThis pattern of aggressive fighting continued for years. Harris won against several competitors, until he faced Ray Oliveira in early 2000. Harris was not able to match Oliveira's overall punch output, and consequently lost a 10-round decision. Later that year, Harris was matched against Ivan Robinson, a fight that many thought he convincingly won. However, due to New Jersey's consensus scoring system, Harris was forced to accept a draw.\n\nOn October 19, 2002, Harris defeated Diobelys Hurtado and captured the WBA junior welterweight title. Harris defended his title twice in the next two years against Souleyman Mbaye and Oktay Urkal, respectively.\n\nIn June 2005 Harris was set to fight Colombian boxer Carlos Maussa as a part of the \"Thunder and Lighting\" Floyd Mayweather Jr. v. Arturo Gatti pay-per-view. Harris started the fight aggressively, and hurt Maussa in the first round. He continued to apply pressure, gunning for a knockout. However Maussa survived, and started to get stronger as the fight went on.\n\nAt this point, Harris grew visibly tired as he desperately tried to score a knockout. However, in the seventh round, Maussa caught Harris with a left hook that sent Harris to the canvas. As the referee began counting, Maussa delivered another punch to Harris as he was down, although Harris was already hurt by the first blow, and the subsequent late punch did not land cleanly. Harris failed to answer the 10-count and the bout was scored as a knockout for Maussa.\n\nVivian Harris and Junior Witter met on September 6, 2007, in Doncaster, England, fighting for the WBC light welterweight belt. Witter came out more aggressive than usual, winning the first six rounds until knocking Harris out in the seventh with a punishing left hook that caught Harris off-guard. Harris once again fell short of winning a championship, not able to answer the count of 10 in his second straight title fight.\n\nVivian Harris and Mexican Noe Bolanos met on August 14, 2009, in Tucson, Arizona, in the main event of ESPN's Friday Night Fights. In Round 2, Harris and Bolanos collided heads. Harris stumbled towards his corner and collapsed while the ringside doctor was talking with him. Harris appeared to be conscious but not entirely alert. He left the ring on a stretcher, was allowed to briefly walk around the fighter area, and was taken to a local hospital as a precaution. The referee stopped the fight officially at 40 seconds of Round 2, declaring the match a No Contest. Six months later he fought against Lucas Martin Matthysse, losing by a controversial fourth-round TKO. In his next fight on the undercard of Mora vs. Mosley against futurewelterweight champion Victor Ortiz, Harris was dropped three times in round two, and was dropped a fourth time in the third round for a KO loss to Ortiz.\n\nReturning in 2011 against welterweight Jesse Vargas, Harris was severely battered in the first round, appearing unprepared for the bout, defenseless, and without skills or stamina, and gave up at the end of the round, virtually ending his career with his third consecutive KO loss. It turns out Vivian had only two weeks notice for this fight and had to drop several pounds in a short time, including two pounds on the day of the fight itself. This drained him and caused his performance to suffer.\n\nVivian fought again in July 2011 against Lanardo Tyner, losing a controversial unanimous decision to him. Harris and several ringside reporters felt he won the fight.\nBoxing Trainer: Lennox Blackmoore, Strength and Conditioning Coach: Farrel Brenner\n\nIn 2009, Harris became the subject of an upcoming television reality series produced by John Edmonds Kozma (producer of Nick Cassavetes' Kentucky Rhapsody\") and shot by filmmaker Richard O'Sullivan. The unnamed reality series never aired.\n"}

He began playing at the age of 6 and was picked for the Chinese men's national squad in 1993 when he was only 15 years old. He holds three majors (3 World Championships). He has been ranked #1 by ITTF for 25 consecutive months, from September 2000 to September 2002, which is the second-longest period for being consecutive #1 of the world as of January 2011. At the end of 2013, Wang Liqin retired from the national team.\n\nWang is the type who changes his playing equipment often. He has perhaps used more than 10 different model of rackets, some of them for a longer period of time, e.g. The Butterfly Timo Boll Spirit, Stiga Clipper CR, Offensive CR, Rosewood V, DHS Hurricane King II, III, and some Nittaku's models. His main forehand rubber is DHS Hurricane II, III, TG III. It is said that he had used Nittaku Hammond, the Tenergy series, and many other rubbers for his backhand.\n\nWang Liqin uses the shakehand grip.

{"id": "2169301", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2169301", "title": "Lansium parasiticum", "text": "Lansium parasiticum\n\nLansium parasiticum, commonly known as langsat () or lanzones () in English; or duku or dokong in Malay, is a species of tree in the Mahogany family with commercially cultivated edible fruits. The species is native to Southeast Asia.\n\nThe tree is average sized, reaching in height and in diameter. Seedling trees 30 years old planted at 8 x 8 meter spacing can have a height of 10 meters and diameter of 25 cm. The trunk grows in an irregular manner, with its buttress roots showing above ground. The tree's bark is a greyish colour, with light and dark spots. Its resin is thick and milk coloured.\n\nThe pinnately compound leaves are odd numbered, with thin hair, and 6 to 9 buds at intervals. The buds are long and elliptical, approximately by in size. The upper edge shines, and the leaves themselves have pointed bases and tips. The stems of the buds measure .\n\nThe flowers are located in inflorescences that grow and hang from large branches or the trunk; the bunches may number up to 5 in one place. They are often branched at their base, measure in size, and have short fur. The flowers are small, with short stems, and have two genders. The sheathe is shaped like a five lobed cup and is coloured a greenish-yellow. The corona is egg-shaped and hard, measuring by . There is one stamen, measuring in length. The top of the stamen is round. The pistil is short and thick.\n\nThe fruit can be elliptical, ovoid or round, measuring by in size. Fruits look much like small potatoes and are borne in clusters similar to grapes. The larger fruits are on the variety known as duku. It is covered by thin, yellow hair giving a slightly fuzzy aspect. The skin thickness varies with the varieties, from to approximately . The fruit contains 1 to 3 seeds, flat, and bitter tasting; the seeds are covered with a thick, clear-white aril that tastes sweet and sour. The taste has been likened to a combination of grape and grapefruit and is considered excellent by most. The sweet juicy flesh contains sucrose, fructose, and glucose. For consumption, cultivars with small or undeveloped seeds and thick aril are preferred.\n\nThere are numerous cultivars of \"L. parasiticum\". Overall, there are two main groups of cultivars, those named \"duku\" and those named \"langsat\". There are also mixed duku-langsat varieties.\n\nThose called duku generally have a large crown, thick with bright green leaves, with short bunches of few fruit. The individual fruit are large, generally round, and have somewhat thick skin that does not release sap when cooked. The seeds are small, with thick flesh, a sweet scent, and a sweet or sour taste.\n\nMeanwhile, the variant commonly known as langsat generally has thinner trees, with a less dense crown consisting of dark green leaves and stiff branches. The bunches are longer, and each bunch holds between 15 and 25 large, egg-shaped fruit. The skin is thin and releases a white sap when cooked. The flesh is watery and tastes sweet and sour. \n\"Lansium domesticum\" var. \"aquaeum\" is distinguished by its hairy leaves, as well as the tightly packed dark yellow fruit on its bunches. The fruit tends to be small, with thin skin and little sap; the skin is difficult to remove. To be eaten, the fruit is bitten and the flesh sucked through the hole created, or rubbed until the skin breaks and the seeds are retrieved. In Indonesia the fruit has several names, including \"kokosan\", \"pisitan\", \"pijetan\", and \"bijitan\". The seeds are relatively large, with thin, sour flesh.\n\nThe seeds of \"L. parasiticum\" are polyembryonic, the multiple embryos resulting from apomixis. \n\n\"Lansium parasiticum\" is traditionally reproduced by spreading seedlings, either cultivated or collected from below the tree. It has been said that new seedlings require 20 to 25 years to bear fruit, with the possibility of the quality being inferior. However other sources quote 12 years to first production from seed and no variations. Production often varies from year to year, and depends to some extent on having a dry period to induce flowering. One example of ten trees in Costa Rica about twenty-five years old produced during five years the following weights of salable fruits: 2008: 50 kilos, 2009: 2000 kilos, 2010: 1000 kilos, 2011: 100 kilos, 2012: 1500 kilos. Experiments in the Philippines with grafting where two trees are planted close to each other and then grafted when one to two meters tall to leave twin root systems on a single main trunk have resulted in earlier and less erratic fruit production.\n\nAnother common method is by air layering. Although the process requires up to several months, the new rooted tree produced is itself ready to bear fruit within two years. Trees cultivated with this method have a high death rate, and the growths are less resilient.\n\nThe third common way to reproduce \"L. parasiticum\" is with grafting. This results in the new trees having the same genetic characteristics as their parent, and being ready to bear fruit within 5 to 6 years. The offspring are relatively stronger than transplanted shoots.\n\n\"Lansium parasiticum\" grows well in mixed agroforests. The plant, especially the \"duku\" variant, prefers damp, shaded areas. It can be grown in the same agroforest as durian, petai, and jengkol, as well as wood-producing trees.\n\n\"Lansium parasiticum\" is grown from low grounds up to heights of above sea level, in areas with an average rainfall of a year. The plant can grow and blossom in latosol, yellow podzol, and alluvium. The plant prefers slightly acidic soil with good drainage and rich in mulch. The \"langsat\" variant is hardier, and can weather dry seasons with a little shade and water. The plant cannot handle floods.\n\n\"Lansium parasiticum\" generally bears fruit once a year. This period can vary between areas, but blooming is generally after the beginning of the rainy season and fruit production some four months later.\n\n\"Lansium parasiticum\" is native to the Malesian phytochorion of Southeast Asia, from Peninsular Thailand and Peninsular Malaysia, to Java, Sumatra, Borneo, the Philippines (Luzon, Camiguin, Basilan, and Mindanao), Sulawesi, the Moluccas, and Western New Guinea.\n\nIt has also been introduced to Laos, Cambodia, Myanmar, Micronesia, Hawaii, Sri Lanka, India, the Seychelles, Trinidad & Tobago, and Surinam, among others. \n\nThe tree is cultivated commercially in Thailand (, langsat), Cambodia, Vietnam, India, Malaysia and the Philippines (). It grows well in the wetter areas (120 inches/3 meters or more annual rainfall) of Costa Rica, where it is still very rare, having been introduced decades ago by the United Fruit Company. A major hindrance to its acceptance seems to be that it is very slow in bearing, said to take 12 years or more from seed. However, air layering from mature trees, as well as grafting, are said to work well and produce much faster.\n\nThe name Duku is reserved for the larger-sized varieties of Langsat, near the size of golf balls, claimed sweeter and with less sap in the peel. A variety called Dokong exported to mainland Malaysia from Thailand (this variety is called 'Longkong' in Thailand) grows tighter in the clusters, giving it a faceted shape, and is preferred by many over the standard Langsat.\n\n\"Lansium parasiticum\" is cultivated mainly for its fruit, which can be eaten raw. The fruit can also be bottled in syrup. The wood is hard, thick, heavy, and resilient, allowing it to be used in the construction of rural houses.\n\nSome parts of the plant are used in making traditional medicine. The bitter seeds can be pounded and mixed with water to make a deworming and ulcer medication. The bark is used to treat dysentery and malaria; the powdered bark can also be used to treat scorpion stings. The fruit's skin is used to treat diarrhea, and in the Philippines the dried skin is burned as a mosquito repellent. The skin, especially of the \"langsat\" variety, can be dried and burned as incense.\n\nThe greatest producers of \"Lansium parasiticum\" are Indonesia, Thailand, the Philippines and Malaysia. The production is mostly for internal consumption, although some is exported to Singapore, Hong Kong and Kuwait.\n\n\n"}

Established in 1998, the awards were initially presented by the Gaylactic Network, with awards first awarded in 1999. In 2002 the awards were given their own organization, the \"Gaylactic Spectrum Awards Foundation\".\n\nThe major award categories are for best novel, short fiction, and other works. The winners and short list of recommended nominees are decided by a jury. One of the most recognized authors, Nicola Griffith has received the most awards overall, with three wins. Griffith also jointly holds the record for most nominations with Melissa Scott, both having received five nominations. Works of any format produced before the awards were first given were eligible to be inducted into the \"Hall of Fame\", although no work has been inducted since 2003. The list of award winners and Hall of Fame inductees has been called a \"who's who of science fiction\" by GLBTQ.com. This article lists the winners in each of the categories, and the inductees to the Hall of Fame.\n\nSince their inception, the awards were given in categories for novels and best other work. Other categories were also added and removed in intervening years, including categories for short fiction (since the second year) and comic books for one year. A short lived \"People's Choice\" award voted by convention attendees was also awarded to one work from any of the category nominee short lists. The award for best novel was the only one to have been handed out every year since the awards began. there were three regular categories: novels, short fiction and other works. The \"other works\" category included comic books, graphic novels, movies, television episodes, multimedia, anthologies, story collections, gaming products, artwork, and music.\nThe categories are open to submission of English-language works released during the prior calendar year in North America that include \"significant positive GLBT content\". The time-frame of eligibility is based on copyright date for first printing for written works, cover date for magazines and comic books, release date for films, first air date for television. Works had to have been \"professionally\" published or distributed to be eligible for consideration and be wholly original and legal. The judges can choose to extend eligibility for a work due to oversight, confusion regarding release dates, or problems with availability. An open nomination/recommendation process is used to identify works to be considered by the judges. Works of any format produced before the inception of the awards are eligible to be inducted into the \"Hall of Fame\"; these inductees were selected solely by the judges.\n\nThe results are decided by a panel of judges from the list of submitted nominees; nominations can be made by anyone. The judges are volunteers from science fiction fandom and GLBT community, with one volunteer as the \"Award Administrator\". The judges review each recommended work and the long list of nominees is reduced via review and discussion to a short list of finalists, and then one or more winners is chosen by consensus or vote. The results are generally announced and presented at Gaylaxicon, a convention dedicated to LGBT science fiction, although on occasion they are presented at Worldcon.\n\nEach award consists of an etched image on lucite on a stand, using a spiral galaxy in a triangle logo, based on the logo of the Gaylactic Network. The award winner's name, work title, award year and category are etched on a small plaque on the base or on the plexiglass itself. A small cash stipend is also awarded to winners in the Best Novel category. The cost of the awards is paid through individual donations and fundraising events.\n\nNicola Griffith has won the most awards. Other authors and editors who have won the award multiple times are David Gerrold, Keith Hartman, Laurie J. Marks, and Stephen Pagel. Melissa Scott has a novel in the Hall of Fame and has won an award for Best Short Fiction. Samuel R. Delany is notable for winning both a special \"Lifetime Achievement\" award and having a novel in the Hall of Fame. Tanya Huff was a finalist five times without winning. The most successful individual comic book creator is Judd Winick, who was nominated twice and won one award for writing Green Lantern comic books. The creators of \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\" also received five nominations across various media, making it the most successful franchise and television series at the awards.\n\nIn the following table, the years correspond to the year of work's release; the ceremonies were always held the following year.

{"id": "2169329", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2169329", "title": "Lanzón", "text": "Lanzón\n\nThe Lanzón is a granite stella associated with the Chavín culture. It is located in the Old Temple of Chavin de Huantar which rests in the central highlands of Peru. The Chavín religion was the first major religious and cultural movement in the Andes mountains, flourishing between 900 and 200 BCE. The Lanzón itself was erected during the Early Horizon period of Andean art circa 500 BCE and takes its name from the Spanish word for \"lance,\" an allusion to the shape of the sculpture. The name is deceiving, as its form more closely resembles a highland plow which would have been used for agricultural purposes at the time. It is suspected because of this that the deity depicted is linked to agrarian worship.\n\nThe Lanzón rests in the heart of Chavín de Huantar. This site at the time was on one of the few passes between the mountainous region of the coast and the dense Amazon. Due to the difficulty of the geography, one must have used these passages. The exposure of Chavín art, such as the Lanzon, to other cultures occurred because of its geographic location. Archaeologists have found textiles which echo the architecture of Chavín and its sculptural artifacts buried as far away as the South Coast in sites such as Karwa, suggesting its influence reached much farther than many other sites at the time.\n\nThe Lanzón is housed in the central cruciform chamber of a labyrinthine series of underground passages in the Old Temple of the ceremonial and religious center of Chavín de Huantar. Devotees would be led into the maze of pitch-black tunnels, eventually coming face to face with the sculpture. The worshipers' disorientation, in addition to the hallucinogenic effects of the San Pedro cactus they were given before entering, only heightened the visual and psychological impact of the sculpture. The imagery of the Lanzon is a complex series of line work which winds around each of the three sides of its floor to ceiling triangular form. Due to the imagery being divided, one would have to circumambulate the fixture in order to fully observe its design. The Lanzon depicts an anthropomorphic figure with a snarl, claws, and teeth akin to a jaguar. The being's hair flows in all directions, ending with the heads of snakes. The eyes are stylized, commonly referred to as pendant eyes. The carving is almost perfectly symmetrical except for one hand being raised with the other lowered. Additionally, there is special attention paid to the eyes, nose, lips, and teeth- deeper set carvings for these features make them project, due to the higher relief, it adds a greater feeling of ferocity.\n\nThe Lanzón expresses a fundamental motif within Chavín art: the jaguar. These representations vary from realism to stylized anthropomorphism, this particular stella falling under the latter category. The imagery of the jaguar occurs so frequently within Chavín art that it has been hypothesized that they were the foundation for the jaguar cult, worshipping the characteristics of these animals. This depiction of an anthropomorphic jaguar deity lends itself to other cosmological beliefs not just of Chavín but of Andean society as a whole. Camay, the belief of an object being a conduit for a deity, is particularly significant when considering the function of the Lanzón. Though it was made of terrestrial material, the Lanzón housed a celestial being, the people of Chavín even brought it offerings of food and ceramics. Furthermore, the central image of the Lanzon functions as axis mundi, or pivot linking the heavens, earth and underworld. This concept is also reflected in the raised and lowered arms, one linked to the celestial and the other linked to the terrestrial. The opposite arms are also reflective of the reverence to duality. Opposites seen in daily life such as night/day, life/death, male/female were considered sacred to create balance. The importance of duality is also seen with the contour rivalry of the snakes and hair, the transformation between man and beast, and the geographical location between the arid mountain range and the lush amazon. Finally, a key cosmological belief within Andean society as a whole, tinku. This is the concept of multiple parts converging to create something wholly new. The strategic geographic location of the Lanzón is placed at the convergence of the Mosna and Wacheqsa rivers.\n\nPiligian, C., \"et al.\" (Producers). (2012, February 2).

It was contested by the year's winners of the four major championships of regular men's golf, which are the Masters Tournament, the U.S. Open, The Open Championship (British Open), and the PGA Championship. It was one of several invitational events for leading male golfers held each year after the PGA Tour and the European Tour seasons had concluded. The competition was organized by the PGA of America and the prize money did not count toward the PGA Tour money list.\n\nThe tournament was staged since 1979 with a couple of short breaks. Beginning in 1991, it was played as a two-day, 36-hole stroke play competition, except in 1998 and 1999, when it was played at match play. From 1979 to 1990, it was played as a one-day, 18-hole stroke play competition. If a player won more than one major in a calendar year or a player declined the invitation to play, the PGA of America filled the four-man field by inviting the former major winner(s) with the best overall finishes in that year's majors.\n\nInitially the PGA Grand Slam of Golf was played at a different golf course each year, but from 1994 to 2006, it was played at the Poipu Bay Golf Course in Koloa, Hawaii on the island of Kauai. The tournament in Hawaii allowed the event to be televised in prime-time American television with live coverage because of the time difference.\n\nIn 2007, the tournament moved to the Mid Ocean Club in Bermuda and it was played in mid-October, reflecting the earlier end to the main part of the PGA Tour season after the introduction of the FedEx Cup. In 2009, the event stayed in Bermuda but moved to the Port Royal Golf Course.\n\nThe final prize fund was $1.35 million, of which $600,000 went to the winner. This was the lowest first prize some of the competitors have played for all year, but on the other hand there was a guaranteed $200,000 for coming in last. From 1991 to 2005, the prize fund was $1 million, of which $400,000 went to the winner. In 2006, the purse was $1.25 million, with $500,000 going to the winner.\n\nIn the 2004 tournament at Poipu Bay Golf Course, Phil Mickelson shot a 59 in the second round.\n\nThe 1986–90 tournaments were played at Kemper Lakes Golf Club in Hawthorn Woods, Illinois, site of the PGA Championship in 1989.\n\nThe event was to be moved to Trump National Golf Club in Rancho Palos Verdes, California for the 2015 contest, but on July 7, 2015 the PGA announced that the 2015 event will not be played at the course. After being unable to find a suitable course, the 2015 event was canceled.\n\nIn March 2016, the event was canceled altogether. \n\nThe year's four major champions in a 36-hole event was previously applied at the original \"World Series of Golf,\" played from 1962 through 1975 at the South Course of Firestone Country Club in Akron, Ohio. Held in early September, Jack Nicklaus won four of the fourteen events, including the first two, and was runner-up in six. All editions had a winner's share of $50,000, a substantial prize in its early years, significantly more than a major.

{"id": "2169349", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2169349", "title": "Day by Day (webcomic)", "text": "Day by Day (webcomic)\n\nDay by Day (also Day by Day Cartoon) is an American political webcomic by Chris Muir. The humor usually centers on four principal characters who had initially been presented as coworkers at an unspecified firm until the firm went out of business on December 25, 2007. Romantic relationships among the principals resulted in marriages and children, with one of the couples opening a small bar in the unnamed Texas Rio Grande Valley ranchland in which the strip is now principally set. Texas license plates figure prominently, as well as the iconic Shiner Beer. These characters (and their friends and family) remain center stage even though some strips focus on public figures and feature none of the main cast, in a manner similar to \"Doonesbury\". The strip has a conservative libertarian viewpoint, and often makes reference to political weblogs. It was a Yahoo! Pick in the \"Comics and Animation\" category in 2004.\n\nThe strip is updated daily, including weekends. It usually follows a loose \"strip story arc\" throughout a given week. Except on Sundays, the strip is usually three colorized panels, comprising a combination of newly drawn art and a library of hand-drawn elements that Muir has digitized and reuses. As with many newspaper comics, the strips for Sundays are larger and have more panels. Muir has stated in interviews that by crafting the cartoons digitally, and using previously drawn faces, expressions, and body postures, he can react to breaking news by crafting a relevant comic and putting it up the next day, breaking or delaying the main storyline.\n\nGenerally, the strip features a running commentary on political events with the characters interacting in a vaguely seen office setting. In addition, the author often shows a \"\"Doonesbury\"-esque\" White House strip with an unseen President talking to his staff. Muir has often used the same treatment to show goings-on at the United Nations and \"The New York Times\".\n\nThe home URL was written vertically on the leftmost edge of the strip, beginning on May 2, 2003, running until the site's redesign in 2006. The comic itself has run since November 1, 2002, with a hiatus from September 12, 2004 to November 30, 2004. The large-format Sunday strips started in 2005.\n\nIn 2007 the strip controversially portrayed Hillary Clinton in blackface and as speaking Ebonics.\n\nLike many other web comics, \"Day by Day\" is supported by a combination of contributions from readers (via PayPal, Amazon and other payment vehicles), banner advertising, and merchandise. Originally it was published without the benefit of syndication. In 2005, the strip became available for print newspaper syndication and was carried by the Hemingford Ledger, the Knoxville News-Sentinel, the North County Times and The San Diego Union-Tribune. In October 2007, \"Day by Day\" discontinued service to newspapers. Also in October 2007, E-book compilations of \"Day by Day\" cartoons became available for free on WOWIO. It had a peak readership of more than 200,000 people a month.\n\n\nThe \"Day by Day\" strip is drawn by cartoonist Chris Muir (born October 30, 1958, in Syracuse, New York). Prior to that, he drew a single-panel comic called \"Altered States\" for about five years for \"Florida Today\" (a Gannett newspaper). Muir currently lives in Florida.\n\nAs to the strip's political viewpoint, Muir stated that he \"wanted to present the point of view that I never see represented in what I call Old Media: the papers, magazines, TV (until Fox News), etc. Where's the voice of the other half, the moderate-conservative half of America, on ethics, economy, politics and the age-old dynamic betwixt men and women?\" The strip is popular amongst conservative bloggers, and often mentions bloggers and blog posts. Muir cites the work of several other cartoonists as inspiration, including Gary Larson and Garry Trudeau.\n\nIn February 2007, Muir visited Iraq and was embedded for five days in Mosul.\n\n"}
{"id": "2169381", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2169381", "title": "EHow", "text": "EHow\n\neHow is an online how-to guide with many articles and 170,000 videos offering step-by-step instructions. eHow articles and videos are created by freelancers and cover a wide variety of topics organized into a hierarchy of categories. Any eHow user can leave comments or responses, but only contracted writers can contribute changes to articles. The writers work on a freelance basis, being paid by article. eHow is frequently called a content farm.\n\neHow was founded by Courtney Rosen in 1999. On 8 February 2001 it filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy. At that time it had $1.16 million in assets and $7.2 million in debts and had used up $23.5 million in venture capital funding in a year and a half that came from companies including Hummer Winblad Venture Partners ($1.3 million) and Dominion Ventures ($982,035). eHow's major debts included $598,460 owed to Vignette Corp., $140,024 to Engage Media in San Francisco and $237,492 to LifeMinders. The Silicon Valley Bank seized $180,548 that was in EHow's accounts to pay off outstanding loans. eHow was acquired by Demand Media in 2006. Originally it was a source of written articles and step-by-step instructions. At the time of its acquisition it had 17,000 articles and 5.8 million visitors a month. A year after purchasing the website Demand Media introduced the video format. In 2008 the site won a Mashable Blogger's Choice award in the 2nd Annual Open Web Awards.\n\nIn 2009 the website introduced a mobile version for cell phone users and also was a CNET Webware 100 Winner in the category of \"Search & Reference\". That same year Demand Media merged their acquisition of Expert Village into eHow and opened a branch operation in the United Kingdom. The moves gave eHow over one million articles and videos available on-line in 2009 and doubled that number by the following year. In 2010 they received a New Media Award.\n\nIt was in 2009 that eHow was noted as having changed its method of identifying content to contract for creation. The company moved from human-identified lists of potential content to the use of a computer-based algorithm, a move that increased revenue by a factor of 4.9 times per article or video created. Getting rid of the human editors who formerly identified and approved content to be produced increased profits for the company by a factor of 20–25 times. The automated program combines search data, internet traffic patterns and the rates of keyword use and uses this information to determine what internet users want to know and also calculates how much money advertisers will pay to appear on the same page content created. Another algorithm, called the Knowledge Engine, then works out what exactly internet users want to know about the subjects identified and details exactly how to approach profitable subjects and what its potential subject longevity is. The machine-created subjects are then proofread by freelance proofreaders for 8 cents each, to ensure that they are clear enough for bidding on by freelance article and video producers. Content producers are then paid about US$15 per article or US$20 per video to produce the product. This change resulted in the Demand Media making an estimated US$200 million in revenue in 2009, including from Google's advertising income.\n\nIn 2011 the site released an iPad application, providing a direct shortcut to the website. That same year the site received a reorganization and overhaul of its look, consolidating its now three million articles and videos into six categories: Home, Health, Food, Style, Money and Family. In 2011 the site was adding more than 5,000 articles and videos a day while employing 13,000 freelance writers, editors and producers. In 2012 a seventh category was added, entitled \"Mom\", focusing on parenting and family issues.\n\nDemand Media and eHow in particular have been criticized for large amounts of low-quality content and for operating as a content farm, paying contributors low rates for content intended to rank high in search results, rather than focus on quality information, with poor quality articles intended mainly to drive up search results rather than inform.\n\nIn 2010 and 2011 Google implemented changes to their algorithms intending to reduce the ranking and impact of content farms. These changes led to a 40% drop in traffic to Demand Media sites. Demand Media responded to the algorithm changes, saying their business model remained solid.\n\nJack Herrick, former owner of eHow, started up wikiHow after concluding that the wiki method of content creation would ultimately produce higher quality work. He described the difference between eHow and wikiHow as \"eating a McDonald's burger vs. a wonderful, home cooked meal\"\n\nSearch engine DuckDuckGo's CEO Gabriel Weinberg has criticized eHow, along with other Demand Media websites, labeling the company a \"content mill,\" because of the website's search engine driven content, low article quality and low writer salaries. DuckDuckGo filters out eHow content because of Weinberg's perception that Demand Media produces low-quality content designed specifically to rank highly in Google Searches for the purposes of promoting advertising.\n\nAnother search engine, Blekko also regarded eHow as spam, blacklisted the site and filtered eHow results out.\n\nWired magazine has also criticized eHow and Demand Media, calling their content: \"slapdash\" and a \"factory stamping out moneymaking content\".\n"}

If an award recipient no longer possesses an original award, companies or individuals have available for purchase South Vietnam's military insignia and awards. \n\nA listing of the most commonly bestowed Vietnam war era decorations is as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeveral decorations (Distinguished Flying Cross, Bronze Star Medal, Air Medal, Commendation Medal, Joint Service Commendation Medal) may be awarded for valor, or for merit. Awards for valor recognize bravery in action against an enemy and have an attached \"V\" device valor device. Awards for merit recognize service.\n\nThe Commendation Medal was another decoration of the Vietnam War, issued frequently in various versions by the different branches of the US armed forces.\n\nAustralia and New Zealand awarded British and Commonwealth orders and decorations to their servicemen in Vietnam, including the Distinguished Service Order, and the Military Cross.\n\nAustralia and New Zealand jointly developed and instituted The Vietnam Medal (though separate Royal Warrants were issued). The obverse of the medal displays an Effigy of Queen Elizabeth II, the reverse shows a man standing between two spheres, a symbolic representation of the ideological struggle. The ribbon incorporates the colours of the three armed services (Red, Navy Blue, and Sky Blue), and the national colours of Vietnam (Red and Yellow).\n\nNew Zealand Defence Force Vietnam Medal Page\n\nIn 1992, Australia struck the Vietnam Logistic and Support Medal. The medal was intended to recognise the Australian servicemen and civilians who provided support for Australian troops. The qualifying criteria for the Medal are service of one day or more as a member or crew of a ship or aircraft operating in the prescribed area of operations of Vietnam in support of Australian forces, or service of one day or more within the prescribed area of operations of Vietnam while attached to a unit or organisation in support of Australian forces.\n\nIt has been awarded to military personnel, Qantas crews, civilian medical personnel, and Embassy staff.\n\nAustralian Government Campaign Medals page\n\nAustralia awarded four Victoria Crosses during the Vietnam War (List of Vietnam War Victoria Cross recipients), two posthumously.\n\nAustralian servicemen were also awarded a large number of individual US and South Vietnamese awards, and the following unit citations:\n"}

Elsasser\n\nWalter Maurice Elsasser (March 20, 1904 – October 14, 1991) was a German-born American physicist, a developer of the presently accepted dynamo theory as an explanation of the Earth's magnetism. He proposed that this magnetic field resulted from electric currents induced in the fluid outer core of the Earth. He revealed the history of the Earth's magnetic field by the study of the magnetic orientation of minerals in rocks.. He was also the first to suggest that the wave-like nature of matter might be investigated by electron scattering experiments using crystalline solids.\n\nThe Olin Hall at the Johns Hopkins University has a Walter Elsasser Memorial in the lobby.\n\nElsasser was born in 1904 to a Jewish family in Mannheim, Germany. Before he became known for his geodynamo theory, while in Göttingen during the 1920s, he had suggested the experiment to test the wave aspect of electrons. This suggestion of Elsasser was later communicated by his senior colleague from Göttingen (Nobel Prize recipient Max Born) to physicists in England. This explained the results of the Davisson-Germer and Thomson experiments later awarded with the Nobel Prize in Physics. In 1935, while working in Paris, Elsasser calculated the binding energies of protons and neutrons in heavy radioactive nuclei. Wigner, Jensen and Goeppert-Mayer received the Nobel in 1963 for work developing out of Elsasser's initial formulation. Elsasser therefore came quite close to a Nobel prize on two occasions.\n\nDuring 1946–47, Elsasser published papers describing the first mathematical model for the origin of the Earth's magnetic field. He conjectured that it could be a self-sustaining dynamo, powered by convection in the liquid outer core, and described a possible feedback mechanism between flows having two different geometries, toroidal and poloidal (indeed, inventing the terms). This had been developed from about 1941 onwards, partly in his spare time during his scientific war service with the U.S. Army Signal Corps.\n\nDuring his later years, Elsasser became interested in what is now called systems biology and contributed a series of articles to Journal of Theoretical Biology. The final version of his thoughts on this subject can be found in his book \"Reflections on a Theory of Organisms\", published in 1987 and again posthumously with a new foreword by Harry Rubin in 1998.\n\nElsasser died in 1991 in Baltimore, Maryland, US.\n\nA biotonic law, a phrase invented by Elsasser, is a principle of nature which is not contained in the principles of physics.\n\nBiotonic laws may also be considered as local instances of global organismic or organismal principles, such as the Organismic Principle of Natural Selection.\n\nSome, but not all, of Elsasser's theoretical biology work is still quite controversial, and in fact may disagree with several of the basic tenets of current systems biology that he may have helped to develop. Basic to Elsasser's biological thought is the notion of the great complexity of the cell. Elsasser deduced from this that any investigation of a causative chain of events in a biological system will reach a \"terminal point\", where the number of possible inputs into the chain will overwhelm the capacity of the scientist to make predictions, even with the most powerful computers. This might seem like a counsel of despair, but in fact Elsasser was not suggesting the abandonment of biology as a worthwhile research topic, but rather for a different kind of biology such that molecular causal chains are no longer the main focus of study. Correlation between supra-molecular events would become the main data source. Moreover, the heterogeneity of logical classes encompassed by all biological organisms without exception\nis an important part of Elsasser's legacy to both Complex systems biology and Relational Biology.\n\n\nElsasser was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1957. From the American Geophysical Union he received the William Bowie Medal, its highest honor, in 1959; and the John Adam Fleming Medal (for contributions to geomagnetism) in 1971. He received the Penrose Medal from the Geological Society of America in 1979 and the Gauss Medal from Germany in 1977. In 1987, he was awarded the USA's National Medal of Science \"for his fundamental and lasting contributions to physics, meteorology, and geophysics in establishing quantum mechanics, atmospheric radiation transfer, planetary magnetism and plate tectonics.\"\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2169426", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2169426", "title": "Bakersfield Brigade", "text": "Bakersfield Brigade\n\nBakersfield Brigade was an American soccer team based in Bakersfield, California, United States. Founded in 2005, the team played in the USL Premier Development League (PDL), the fourth tier of the American Soccer Pyramid, until 2009, after which the franchise folded and the team left the league.\n\nThe team played its home games in the stadium on the campus of Bakersfield Christian High School. The team's colors were black and white.\n\nThe team also fielded a team in the USL’s Super-20 League, a league for players 17 to 20 years of age run under the United Soccer Leagues umbrella.\n\nFormer US national team star and Fox Soccer Channel broadcaster Eric Wynalda is a past member of the Brigade squad.\n\nThe Brigade made their debut in PDL competition in 2005 under head coach Jay Gore, but lost their first competitive game 1–0 to the visiting California Gold. During their first season, Brigade were generally better on the road than they were at home, registering victories over San Diego, Nevada and Southern California Seahorses. Brigade missed out on qualifying for the post-season, finishing 5th in the division and ranked 32nd nationally, despite a comprehensive last-day victory over California Gold. Their season top scorer was CSU Bakersfield striker Lyle Martin, who notched up 5 goals.\n\n2006 was a similar story. A strong season start saw the Brigade register victories over San Diego and Southern California Seahorses, but inconsistency at home in the mid-season again ended the team's playoff hopes fairly early, following five defeats in six games at their home at Bakersfield Christian High School. Brigade finished the season in 7th place; Lyle Martin again led the team's offense, registering 9 goals and 2 assists.\n\n2007 saw a change in leadership and a change in goalkeeper – Jay Gore was replaced by 8-year MLS veteran Francisco Gomez as head coach, USMNT legend Eric Wynalda came on board as an advisor, and shot-stopper Kyle Reynish was drafted by Real Salt Lake; early season, the Brigade's new team seemed to be working, with season-opening victories over Fresno Fuego and Orange County Blue Star bringing them a first ever US Open Cup qualification. Sadly, Brigade's cup dreams ended with a first round 2–0 defeat to USL-1 side Portland Timbers. Similarly, a late-season collapse ended Brigade's playoff hopes quickly – the team suffered six defeats in seven games, including a 5–0 demolition away to Los Angeles Storm, despite Wynalda taking to the field himself for 24 minutes in the Storm return fixture. Brigade finished the season in 8th place; top scorer Santiago Aguilera Navarro scored an impressive 8 goals and 5 assists.\n\nThe 2008 pre-season was one of unprecedented anticipation, after it was announced that Eric Wynalda had signed to play the entire season for the Brigade; however, yet again, the on-field performances were disappointing for the men from Kern County. Five ties and just one win  – 1–0 over Southern California Seahorses – in their first six games left the Brigade with a lot of ground to make up in the second half of the season. Back to back wins over Orange County Blue Star and Ventura County Fusion in mid-June kept their slim playoff chances alive, but four defeats in their last six games, including a 3–1 loss to struggling Orange County Blue Star, left Brigade seventh in the table, out of the playoffs for the fourth consecutive season, and eleven points behind eventual divisional champions, the San Fernando Valley Quakes. Quincy Amarikwa was top scorer, with four goals on the season; Eric Wynalda ultimately featured in just three games, clocking 159 minutes.\n\nThings went from bad to worse for Bakersfield in 2009. Following a generally positive opening day 2–2 tie with Ventura County Fusion, the Brigade promptly lost their next six games on the bounce, allowing six goals against the Southern California Seahorses, four goals against eventual divisional champs Hollywood United Hitmen, and conceded a last minute goal in a 2–1 loss in the return fixture against Ventura. A 3–0 victory at home to Orange County Blue Star at the beginning of June was followed by a 2–0 win over their local rivals Fresno Fuego, and it looked as though a brief resurgence may have been on the cards, but Bakersfield failed to win another game all season, and were out of playoff contention before the end of the month. The pair losses to perennial whipping boys Lancaster Rattlers were hard to take for the men from Kern County; the 6–0 drubbing at the hands of their closest rivals, Ogden Outlaws, on the final day of the season was the final straw, and consigned Bakersfield to the basement for the first time in the team's PDL history. Adam Arteaga scored three of Bakersfield's 13 goals, but it's a backhanded compliment to be the top scorer of a team who found any kind silver lining difficult to find.\n\n\n\nAttendance stats are calculated by averaging each team's self-reported home attendances from the historical match archive at https://web.archive.org/web/20100105175057/http://www.uslsoccer.com/history/index_E.html.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2169442", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2169442", "title": "Primitivism", "text": "Primitivism\n\nPrimitivism is a mode of aesthetic idealization that either emulates or aspires to recreate \"primitive\" experience. In Western art, primitivism typically has borrowed from non-Western or prehistoric people perceived to be \"primitive\", such as Paul Gauguin's inclusion of Tahitian motifs in paintings and ceramics. Borrowings from \"primitive\" or non-Western art has been important to the development of modern art. Primitivism has often been critiqued for reproducing the racist stereotypes about non-European peoples used by Europeans to justify colonial conquest.\n\nThe term \"primitivism\" is often applied to other professional painters working in the style of naïve or folk art like Henri Rousseau, Mikhail Larionov, Paul Klee and others.\n\nPrimitivism is a utopian idea that is distinctive for its reverse teleology. The utopian end toward which primitivists aspire usually lies in a notional \"state of nature\" in which their ancestors existed (chronological primitivism), or in the supposed natural condition of the peoples that live beyond \"civilization\" (cultural primitivism).\n\nThe desire of the \"civilized\" to be restored to a \"state of nature\" is as longstanding as civilization itself. In antiquity the superiority of \"primitive\" life principally found expression in the so-called Myth of the Golden Age, depicted in the genre of European poetry and visual art known as the Pastoral. Primitivist idealism between gained new impetus with the onset of industrialization and the European encounter with hitherto unknown peoples after the colonization of the Americas, the Pacific and other parts of what would become the modern imperial system.\n\nDuring the Enlightenment, the idealization of indigenous peoples were chiefly used as a rhetorical device to criticize aspects of European society. In the realm of aesthetics, however, the eccentric Italian philosopher, historian and jurist Giambattista Vico (1688–1744) was the first to argue that primitive peoples were closer to the sources of poetry and artistic inspiration than \"civilized\" or modern man. Vico was writing in the context of the celebrated contemporary debate, known as the great Quarrel of the Ancients and the Moderns. This included debates over the merits of the poetry of Homer and the Bible as against modern vernacular literature.\n\nIn the 18th century, the German scholar Friedrich August Wolf identified the distinctive character of oral literature and located Homer and the Bible as examples of folk or oral tradition (\"Prolegomena to Homer\", 1795). Vico and Wolf's ideas were developed further in the beginning of the 19th century by Herder. Nevertheless, although influential in literature, such arguments were known to a relatively small number of educated people and their impact was limited or non-existent in the sphere of visual arts.\n\nThe 19th century saw for the first time the emergence of historicism, or the ability to judge different eras by their own context and criteria. A result of this, new schools of visual art arose that aspired to hitherto unprecedented levels of historical fidelity in setting and costumes. Neoclassicism in visual art and architecture was one result. Another such \"historicist\" movement in art was the Nazarene movement in Germany, which took inspiration from the so-called Italian \"primitive\" school of devotional paintings (i.e., before the age of Raphael and the discovery of oil painting).\n\nWhere conventional academic painting (after Raphael) used dark glazes, highly selective, idealized forms, and rigorous suppression of details, the Nazarenes used clear outlines, bright colors, and paid meticulous attention to detail. This German school had its English counterpart in the Pre-Raphaelites, who were primarily inspired by the critical writings of John Ruskin, who admired the painters before Raphael (such as Botticelli) and who also recommended painting outdoors, hitherto unheard of.\n\nTwo developments shook the world of visual art in the mid-19th century. The first was the invention of the photographic camera, which arguably spurred the development of Realism in art. The second was a discovery in the world of mathematics of non-Euclidean geometry, which overthrew the 2000-year-old seeming absolutes of Euclidean geometry and threw into question conventional Renaissance perspective by suggesting the possible existence of multiple dimensional worlds and perspectives in which things might look very different.\n\nThe discovery of possible new dimensions had the opposite effect of photography and worked to counteract realism. Artists, mathematicians, and intellectuals now realized that there were other ways of seeing things beyond what they had been taught in Beaux Arts Schools of Academic painting, which prescribed a rigid curriculum based on the copying of idealized classical forms and held up Renaissance perspective painting as the culmination of civilization and knowledge. Beaux Arts academies held than non-Western peoples had had no art or only inferior art.\n\nIn rebellion against this dogmatic approach, Western artists began to try to depict realities that might exist in a world beyond the limitations of the three dimensional world of conventional representation mediated by classical sculpture. They looked to Japanese and Chinese art, which they regarded as learned and sophisticated and did not employ Renaissance one-point perspective. Non-euclidean perspective and tribal art fascinated Western artists who saw in them the still-enchanted portrayal of the spirit world. They also looked to the art of untrained painters and to children's art, which they believed depicted interior emotional realities that had been ignored in conventional, cook-book-style academic painting.\n\nTribal and other non-European art also appealed to those who were unhappy with the repressive aspects of European culture, as pastoral art had done for millennia. Imitations of tribal or archaic art also fall into the category of nineteenth-century \"historicism\", as these imitations strive to reproduce this art in an authentic manner. Actual examples of tribal, archaic, and folk art were prized by both creative artists and collectors.\n\nThe painting of Paul Gauguin and Pablo Picasso and the music of Igor Stravinsky are frequently cited as the most prominent examples of primitivism in art. Stravinsky's \"The Rite of Spring\", is \"primitivist\" in so far as its programmatic subject is a pagan rite: a human sacrifice in pre-Christian Russia. It employs harsh dissonance and loud, repetitive rhythms to depict \"Dionysian\" modernism, i.e., abandonment of inhibition (restraint standing for civilization). Nevertheless, Stravinsky was a master of learned classical tradition and worked within its bounds. In his later work he adopted a more \"Apollonian\" neoclassicism, to use Nietzsche's terminology, although in his use of serialism he still rejects 19th-century convention. In modern visual art, Picasso's work is also understood as rejecting Beaux Arts artistic expectations and expressing primal impulses, whether he worked in a cubist, neo-classical, or tribal-art-influenced vein.\n\nPrimitivism gained a new impetus from anxieties about technological innovation but above all from the \"Age of Discovery\", which introduced the West to previously unknown peoples and opened the doors to colonialism. As the European Enlightenment. With the decline of feudalism, philosophers started questioning many fixed medieval assumptions about human nature, the position of humans in society, and the strictures of Christianity, and especially Catholicism. They began questioning the nature of humanity and its origins through a discussion of the natural man, which had intrigued theologians since the European encounter with the New World.\n\nFrom the 18th century, Western thinkers and artists continued to engage in the retrospective tradition, that is \"the conscious search in history for a more deeply expressive, permanent human nature and cultural structure in contrast to the nascent modern realities\". Their search led them to parts of the world that they believed constituted alternatives to modern civilization.\n\nThe invention of the steamboat and other innovations in global transportation in the 19th century brought the indigenous cultures of the European colonies and their artifacts into metropolitan centres of empire. Many western-trained artists and connoisseurs were fascinated by these objects, attributing their features and styles to \"primitive\" forms of expression; especially the perceived absence of linear perspective, simple outlines, the presence of symbolic signs such as the hieroglyph, emotive distortions of the figure, and the perceived energetic rhythms resulting from the use of repetitive ornamental pattern. According to recent cultural critics, it was primarily the cultures of Africa and the Oceanic islands that provided artists an answer to what these critics call their \"white, Western, and preponderantly male quest\" for the \"elusive ideal\" of the primitive, \"whose very condition of desirability resides in some form of distance and difference.\" These energizing stylistic attributes, present in the visual arts of Africa, Oceania, and the Indians of the Americas, could also be found in the archaic and peasant art of Europe and Asia, as well.\n\nPainter Paul Gauguin sought to escape European civilization and technology, taking up residence in the French colony of Tahiti and adopted a stripped-back lifestyle which he felt to be more natural than was possible in Europe.\n\nGauguin's search for the primitive was manifestly a desire for sexual freedom, and this is reflected in such paintings as \"The Spirit of the Dead Keeps Watch\" (1892), \"Parau na te Varua ino\" (1892), \"Anna the Javanerin\" (1893), \"Te Tamari No Atua\" (1896), and \"Cruel Tales\" (1902), among others. Gauguin's view of Tahiti as an earthly Arcadia of free love, gentle climate, and naked nymphs is quite similar, if not identical, to that of the classical pastoral of academic art, which has shaped Western perceptions of rural life for millennia. One of his Tahitian paintings is called \"Tahitian Pastoral\" and another \"Where Do We Come From\". In this way Gauguin extended the academic pastoral tradition of Beaux Arts schools which had hitherto been based solely on idealized European figures copied from Ancient Greek sculpture to include non-European models.\n\nGauguin also believed he was celebrating Tahitian society and defending the Tahitians against European colonialism. Feminist postcolonial critics, however, decry the fact that Gauguin took adolescent mistresses, one of them as young as thirteen. They remind us that like many European men of his time and later, Gauguin saw freedom, especially sexual freedom, strictly from the male colonizer's point of view. Using Gauguin as an example of what is \"wrong\" with primitivism, these critics conclude that, in their view, elements of primitivism include the \"dense interweave of racial and sexual fantasies and power both colonial and patriarchal\". To these critics, primitivism such as Gauguin's demonstrates fantasies about racial and sexual difference in \"an effort to essentialize notions of primitiveness\" with \"Otherness\". Thus, they contend, primitivism becomes a process analogous to Exoticism and Orientalism, as critiqued by Edward Said, in which European imperialism and monolithic and degrading views of the \"East\" by the \"West\" defined colonized peoples and their cultures.\n\nIn 1905-06, a small group of artists began to study art from Sub-Saharan Africa and Oceania, in part because of the compelling works of Paul Gauguin that were gaining visibility in Paris. Gauguin's powerful posthumous retrospective exhibitions at the Salon d'Automne in Paris in 1903 and an even larger one in 1906 exerted a strong influence. Artists including Maurice de Vlaminck, André Derain, Henri Matisse and Pablo Picasso grew increasingly intrigued and inspired by the select objects they encountered. \n\nPablo Picasso, in particular, explored Iberian sculpture, African sculpture, African traditional masks, and other historical works including the Mannerist paintings of El Greco, resulting in his masterpiece \"Les Demoiselles D'Avignon\" and, eventually, the invention of Cubism.\n\nThe generalizing term \"primitivism\" tends to obscure the distinct contributions to modern art from these various visual traditions.\n\nAlthough primitivism in art is usually regarded as a Western phenomenon, the structure of primitivist idealism can be found in the work of non-Western and especially anticolonial artists. The desire to recover a notional and idealized past in which humans had been at one with nature is here connected to a critique of the impact of Western modernity on colonized societies. These artists often critique Western stereotypes about \"primitive\" colonized peoples at the same time as they yearn to recover pre-colonial modes of experience. Anticolonialism fuses with primitivism's reverse teleology to produce art that is distinct from the primitivism of Western artists which usually reinforces rather than critiques colonial stereotypes.\n\nThe work of artists connected with the Négritude movement in particular demonstrates this tendency. \"Négritude\" was a movement of neo-African idealism and political agitation that was begun by francophone intellectuals and artists on both sides of the Atlantic in the 1930s, and which spread across Africa and the African diaspora in subsequent years. They self-consciously idealized pre-colonial Africa, something that took many forms. This typically consisted in rejecting overweening European rationalism and the associated ravages of colonialism while positing pre-colonial African societies as having had a more communal and organic basis. The work of the Cuban artist Wifredo Lam is particularly notable among the visual artists of negritude. Lam met Pablo Picasso and the European surrealists while living in Paris in the 1930s. When he returned to Cuba in 1941, Lam was emboldened to create images in which humans, animals, and nature combined in lush and dynamic tableaux. In his iconic work of 1943, \"The Jungle\", Lam's characteristic polymorphism recreates a fantastical jungle scene with African motifs between stalks of cane. It vividly captures the way in which negritude's neo-African idealism is connected to a history of plantation slavery centred on the production of sugar.\n\nIn November of 1910, Roger Fry organized the exhibition titled Manet and the Post-Impressionists held at the Grafton Galleries in London. This exhibition showcased works by Paul Cézanne, Paul Gauguin, Henri Matisse, Édouard Manet, Pablo Picasso, Vincent Van Gogh, and other artists. This exhibition was meant to bring England up to date on the art that had taken place in France for the past 30 years. However, the critics in London were shocked by what they saw. Some called Fry “mad” and “crazy” for showing such artwork to the people of London. Fry’s exhibition called attention to primitivism in modern art even if he did not intend for it to happen. Scholar Marianna Torgovnick stated that this exhibition was viewed as “the English debut of the primitive in high culture.”\n\nIn 1984, The Museum of Modern Art in New York City had a new exhibition focusing on primitivism in modern art. Instead of pointing out the obvious issues, the exhibition celebrated the use of non-Western objects as inspiration for the modern artists. The director of the exhibition, William Rubin, took Roger Fry’s exhibition one step farther by displaying the modern works of art juxtaposed to the non-Western objects themselves. Rubin stated, “That he was not so much interested in the pieces of ‘tribal’ art in themselves but instead wanted to focus on he ways in which modern artists ‘discovered’ this art.” He was trying to show there was an ‘affinity’ between the two types of art. Scholar Jean-Hubert Martin argued this attitude effectively meant that the ‘tribal’ art objects were “given the status of not much more than footnotes or addenda to the Modernist avant-garde.” Rubin’s exhibition was divided into four different parts: Concepts, History, Affinities, and Contemporary Explorations. Each section meant to serve a different purpose in showing the connections between modern art and non-Western ‘art.’\n\nIn 2017, the Musée du quai Branly - Jacques Chirac in collaboration with the Musée National Picasso-Paris, put on the exhibition Picasso Primitif. Yves Le Fur, the director, stated he wanted this exhibition to invite a dialogue between “the works of Picasso – not only the major works but also the experiments with aesthetic concepts – with those, no less rich, by non-Western artists.\" Picasso Primitif meant to offer a comparative view of the artist’s works with those of non-Western artists. The resulting confrontation was supposed to reveal the similar issues those artists have had to address such as nudity, sexuality, impulses and loss through parallel plastic solutions.\n\nIn 2018, the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts had an exhibition titled From Africa to the Americas: Face-to-Face Picasso, Past and Present. The MMFA adapted and expanded on Picasso Primitif by bringing in 300 works and documents from the Musée du quai Branly - Jacques Chirac and the Musée National Picasso-Paris. Nathalie Bondil saw the issues with the ways in which Yves Le Fur presented Picasso’s work juxtaposed to non-Western art and objects and found a way to respond to it. The headline of this exhibition was, “A major exhibition offering a new perspective and inspiring a rereading of art history.” The exhibition looked at the transformation in our view of the arts of Africa, Oceania, and the Americas from the end of the 19th century to the present day. Bondil wanted to explore the question about how ethnographic objects come to be viewed as art. She also asked, “How can a Picasso and an anonymous mask be exhibited in the same plane?”\n\n\n\n"}

Such officers are treated for most intents and purposes as commissioned officers.\n\nIn the Canadian Forces, subordinate officers () as a group consist of the Army and Air Force ranks of Officer Cadet (OCdt) and the Navy's Naval Cadet (NCdt); the French language equivalents are \"Élève-officier (élof)\" and \"Aspirant de marine (aspm)\", respectively.\n\nThe subordinate officer's rank insignia is a single narrow strip of gold braid worn on the cuff of the Service Dress jacket, or on slip-ons on the shoulders of other uniforms. Unlike that of commissioned officers, the peak of the service dress cap (if worn) is plain, identical to that of non-commissioned members (NCMs). However, cap badges and other accoutrements are those of commissioned officers which are different from those of NCMs. In the Royal Canadian Navy, Elliot's Eye (the Executive Curl) is absent from the visible rank.\n\nSubordinate officers are addressed as \"Sir\" or \"Ma'am\" by non-commissioned members, and by rank and name by superior officers. As they do not hold commissions they are not required to be saluted. They may however hold positions of authority, either in an acting capacity or for training purposes, such as second-in-command of a platoon, under the close supervision of a superior officer.\n\nIn the Royal Navy, Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve and Royal Naval Reserve, subordinate officers included Acting Sub-Lieutenants, Midshipmen and Naval Cadets, as well as Probationary Second Lieutenants of the Royal Marines. They held their ranks by Admiralty Board orders. They were officers for the purposes of the Naval Discipline Act 1957 and the Queen's Regulations for the Royal Navy, and were entitled to be saluted and to be addressed as \"Sir\" by ratings and addressed as \"Mr\" by superior officers. They also wore officer uniform, although with a smaller cap badge until April 1927, when it was made the same size as that of commissioned officers. In 1972, all cadets became midshipmen when the rank of cadet was abolished.\n\nFrom 1925, all masters, mates and engineers 1st and 2nd class of the Admiralty Yard Craft Service held the courtesy status of subordinate officer.\n\nSubordinate Officer was also the most junior rank in HM Prison Service. Until late 1922, it was divided into Divisions II and I. It is now simply called Prison Officer.\n\nIn France the rank of Aspirant given to cadets finishing their training is a subordinate officer rank. \n\n"}

Green River chose to record Dry As a Bone for Bruce Pavitt's new label, Sub Pop Records. However, Pavitt couldn't afford to release it until the following year, and, as had happened with Come On Down, the record was delayed. Dry As a Bone was finally released through Sub Pop Records in July 1987, a full year after it was recorded. It was the new label's first non-compilation release. It was promoted by Sub Pop as \"ultra-loose GRUNGE that destroyed the morals of a generation.\" The album's cover art was photographed by Charles Peterson. The song \"Ozzie\" was done originally by Tales of Terror.\n\nSteve Huey of AllMusic has called it Green River's \"strongest individual release...perfecting their sleazy, raucous fusion of '70s hard rock and post-hardcore punk.\" It was reissued in 1990 along with the album Rehab Doll (plus bonus tracks) as the Dry As a Bone/Rehab Doll compilation album.

Before that, he served in both houses of the state legislature, and was elected as the Senate Majority Leader by the end of his term. He served in office in electoral politics from 1989 to 2006. When Leman was elected as lieutenant governor in 2002, he was the first person of Alaska Native ancestry to be elected to statewide office in Alaska. He also has Russian-Polish ancestry.\n\nLeman was born in Pomona, California, and grew up in Ninilchik, Alaska, in a Russian-speaking family of Alutiiq and Russian-Polish ancestry. They were commercial fishermen. He watched his father operate a fish trap during Territorial days, before this fishing method was outlawed by referendum in 1959. \n\nHe subsequently has worked the family salmon setnet operation on Cook Inlet near Ninilchik. He longlined for halibut in Cook Inlet and harvested herring roe on kelp in Prince William Sound. Leman traces his long family history in Alaska to the marriage in Kodiak in 1798 between a Russian shipbuilder and an Alutiiq woman from Afognak.\n\nHe graduated from Ninilchik High School in 1968. He received his bachelor's degree in civil engineering from Oregon State University in 1972 and master's degree in civil/environmental engineering from Stanford University in 1973.\n\nHe and his wife Carolyn raised three children; Rachel, Joseph, and Nicole. Their younger daughter, Nicole, died in a hiking accident in New Zealand in December 2015.\n\nLeman joined the Republican Party in Alaska and became politically active. He was elected in 1988 to the Alaska state house, representing west Anchorage and serving until 1993. He was known as a social conservative, pro-development, pro-business, environmentally-conscious, a supporter of Alaska's military and taxpayer-friendly.\n\nIn 1992 he was elected to represent northwest Anchorage in the State Senate, serving from January 1993 to December 2002. In addition to other assignments, he chaired the Senate State Affairs, Labor & Commerce and Resources committees, and served on its Finance Committee. In his last term, he was elected as Senate Majority Leader.\n\nIn November 2002, Leman became the first person of Alaska Native ancestry to be elected to statewide office when he won the position of Alaska's eighth lieutenant governor. In the fall of 2002 Leman had campaigned to win the Republican nomination for lieutenant governor. His opponents were Gail Phillips, State Representative from Homer; Robin Taylor, State Senator from Wrangell; and Sarah Palin, who had been a mayor of Wasilla. Leman won. Palin was a close second, within 2,000 votes. She later ran for Vice President on a ticket with Senator John McCain for president.\n\nAs lieutenant governor, Leman continued his interests in budget discipline, education accountability, promoting wise use of Alaska's natural resources, and supporting the right to life. Leman was an advocate for fiscal responsibility through adopting and following a five-year plan to reduce State spending by $250 million. A social conservative, he led efforts to require parental notification for girls seeking to have abortions and was a prime sponsor of a 1998 Alaska constitutional amendment that defined marriage as between one man and one woman.\n\nHe was active on the multi-state Energy Council, Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission, and Pacific States Legislative Task Force. He taught the Alaska constitution and legislative process to Boys and Girls State delegates, \"Winning Women\" seminars, and has been a guest lecturer to high school and University of Alaska students.\n\nDuring his four years as lieutenant governor, Leman led Alaska's Faith-Based & Community Initiatives, to develop synergies between government and Alaska's faith communities. After the initiative had been underway for a year, the White House recognized Alaska as a \"role model State\" for its FBCI achievements. Lieutenant Governor Leman spoke on the role of people of faith in politics and community service.\n\nHe represented the State as one of seven commissioners on the Denali Commission, a unique State-federal cooperative effort to improve health care, energy, transportation, economic opportunities and workforce development, primarily in rural Alaska. \n\nThere was speculation Leman might run for governor in 2006, either challenging Frank Murkowski in the primary or running for an open seat if Murkowski retired. Leman planned an announcement in February 2006, but postponed the news to talk more with his family about the decision. In late May 2006, Murkowski announced his plans to run for reelection. A few days later, Leman declined a run for the office (saying Murkowski's decision was only one of many factors) and also opted out of a second term as lieutenant governor. Republican Sean Parnell succeeded Leman.\n\nLoren Leman has long maintained an avid interest in transportation improvements in Alaska. He has managed projects to improve airports, was an early supporter of the Alaska Aerospace Development Corporation's launch facilities on Kodiak, served on the Board of Directors of the Challenger Learning Center in Kenai, and as the national chairman of the Aerospace States Association, an organization of lieutenant governors and governor-appointed delegates from space ports and academia who advise Congress on aviation and space issues. He was a sponsor of legislation to enable the Alaska Railroad to complete a track realignment and improvement project from Ship Creek to Wasilla. He has championed road, port and harbor, and building improvements and served on the Legislature's Deferred Maintenance Task Force in the mid-1990s, identifying more than $1.4 billion in infrastructure improvement needs.\n\nHis other work history includes consulting civil/environmental engineering and fishing. A registered civil engineer in Alaska, Leman has had engineering work during the past 43 years that has spanned the entire State, from Ketchikan to Kotzebue, Unalaska to Wasilla to Yakutat.\n\n\n"}

He was drafted by the Calgary Flames in the 1991 NHL Entry Draft as their 11th round pick, 239th overall.\n\nJantunen began his career in Kiekko-Reipas (later Hockey-Reipas) in 1988, and played there for four seasons. For the 1992–93 season he transferred to KalPa, and in 1993–94 he played for TPS, where he won his first SM-liiga medal, a silver one. He won the Aarne Honkavaara trophy for most regular season goals in the league that season; Jantunen played on TPS's first line with future NHL trophy winners Jere Lehtinen and Saku Koivu.\n\nHis career in the Swedish Elitserien started in 1994, when he began his first season with Frölunda HC. Jantunen stayed with Frölunda for five seasons, broken by a short visit to the NHL (see below). In 1999 he transferred to Färjestad BK, where he played for four seasons, until 2003.\n\nHe won a silver medal in 1995–96 with Frölunda, and two silver medals and the Elitserien championship in 2001–2002 with Färjestad. During his 374-game tenure in Sweden Jantunen recorded a total of 123 goals and 137 assists.\n\nIn April 2003 Jantunen signed a three-year contract with Jokerit, where he was named assistant captain and led the club in scoring with 19 goals during the regular season. He was a team second in overall points, after Glen Metropolit, with 40 points. This total ranked him sixteenth in overall scoring in the league.\n\nIn the 2004–05 season Jantunen won the silver medal with Jokerit. He scored 16 goals during the regular season, sharing the Jokerit top goal scorer title with Glen Metropolit and Toni Dahlman. He was second in overall points in the team with 24 assists, again after Glen Metropolit. He scored two short-handed goals in the playoffs.\n\nA foot injury in August 2005 sidelined Jantunen until November. When he returned to action he was named the captain. The spell was however short, as in December he was stripped of his captaincy, and finally in January 2006 Jantunen was released from his contract for disciplinary reasons. He subsequently signed with Timrå IK in the Swedish Elitserien for the remainder of the season.\n\nAfter the spell with Timrå, Jantunen finally made the long-awaited return home by signing a two-year contract with Lahti Pelicans in April 2006. During the regular season 2006–07 he recorded 41 points in 56 games, which made him the leading scorer of Pelicans (tied with Matias Loppi).\n\nJantunen played three games for the Calgary Flames in 1996–97, scoring no points. He also played 23 games for the Saint John Flames in the AHL, scoring 8 goals and 16 assists.\n\nJantunen has represented Finland at the under-20's World Championships in 1991, as well as in the 1997 IIHF world championships. During his time in TPS, he played in the European Championships and won the gold medal in 1994; he also won a bronze medal in the EHL for Frölunda in 1997.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2169485", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2169485", "title": "Come On Down (EP)", "text": "Come On Down (EP)\n\nCome On Down is the debut EP by the Seattle-based alternative rock band Green River. It was released in October 1985 through Homestead Records, while the band were on their first US tour. It is considered the first grunge record because it was released several months before the \"Deep Six\" album that was compiled by six other Seattle grunge bands.\n\nIn the early 1980s, the Seattle branch of the indie movement was influenced by punk rock, however it removed its speed and its structure and added elements of metal. Although Malfunkshun and Soundgarden were more popular in Seattle at this time, Green River was the first band of this movement to release a recording. \"Come On Down\" has been described as a balance between punk and metal, being similar to a mashup of 1980s metal together with early Mudhoney, and with the sound being \"dirty\". In audio engineering, the term \"dirty\" or \"fuzzy\" describes \"the opposite of clear, clean sound. A dirty tone would have some amount of noise, distortion, or overdrive in the signal.\"\n\nThis record also marks Green River's only record with original guitarist Steve Turner (later of Mudhoney), other than the 2016 LP release of 1984 Demos, and the 2019 LP release of Live At The Tropicana. Turner left the group due to his dissatisfaction with bassist Jeff Ament and guitarist Stone Gossard's heavy metal leanings. The record was released to little fanfare, and did not sell well. Allmusic describes the EP as \"a worthwhile listen but not something that points towards the bright futures that its band members would enjoy.\" It contains the first recording of the song \"Swallow My Pride\", a song describing a lover's disdain for his girlfriend's feverish American patriotism, which was later re-recorded for the band's debut album, \"Rehab Doll\".\n\nIn mid-1985, Green River embarked on its first nationwide tour to promote \"Come On Down\". Release of the record was delayed however, thus negating the purpose of the tour. From all accounts the experience was less than positive, though it did help cement alliances with other emerging American indie rock bands such as Sonic Youth. In 1986, the band continued to play in and around the Pacific Northwest to steadily larger crowds (most notably in Seattle).\n\nLeighton Beezer, who played with Mark Arm and Steve Turner in The Thrown Ups, states that when he first heard Green River play \"Come On Down\", he realized that they were playing punk rock backwards. Additionally, he noted that the augmented fifth note was used by Black Sabbath to produce an ominous feeling but it is not used in punk rock. In the 1996 grunge film documentary Hype!, Beezer demonstrated on guitar the difference between punk and grunge. First he played the riff from \"Rockaway Beach\" by The Ramones that ascends the neck of the guitar, then \"Come On Down\" by Green River that descends the neck. The two pieces are only a few notes apart but sound completely unalike. He took the same rhythm with the same chord, however descending the neck made it sound darker, and therefore grunge.\n\nYour Own Best Friend (Demo) is a bonus track on the 2018 remaster.\n\nThe album’s title track discusses the Green River murders from the murderer’s (Ridgway's) point of view. Ridgway is the second most prolific serial killer in the U.S.\n\n\n"}

The phrase echoed Benjamin Disraeli, who, upon returning from the Congress of Berlin in 1878, stated, \"I have returned from Germany with peace for our time\". It is primarily remembered for its ironic value: less than a year after the agreement, continued pressure for return of the Polish corridor by Hitler, and subsequently the invasion of Poland was followed by declarations of war on Germany by France and the United Kingdom.\n\nIt is often misquoted as \"peace \"in\" our time\", which had appeared long before in the \"Book of Common Prayer\" as \"Give peace in our time, O Lord\", probably based on the 7th-century hymn \"Da pacem Domine! in diebus nostris, Alleluja\". It is unknown how deliberate Chamberlain's use of such a similar term was.\n\nChamberlain's aeroplane landed at the Heston Aerodrome on 30 September 1938, and he spoke to the crowds there:\nThe settlement of the Czechoslovakian problem, which has now been achieved is, in my view, only the prelude to a larger settlement in which all Europe may find peace. This morning I had another talk with the German Chancellor, Herr Hitler, and here is the paper which bears his name upon it as well as mine. Some of you, perhaps, have already heard what it contains but I would just like to read it to you: \" ... We regard the agreement signed last night and the Anglo-German Naval Agreement as symbolic of the desire of our two peoples never to go to war with one another again.\"\n\nLater that day he stood outside 10 Downing Street and again read from the document and concluded:\nMy good friends, for the second time in our history, a British Prime Minister has returned from Germany bringing peace with honour. I believe it is peace for our time. We thank you from the bottom of our hearts. Go home and get a nice quiet sleep.\nChamberlain's return was not universally well-received. 15,000 people protested against the Munich agreement the same day in Trafalgar Square, three times more than welcomed him at 10 Downing Street. Due to Chamberlain's ongoing manipulation of the BBC, this news was largely suppressed at the time. Labour spokesman Hugh Dalton publicly suggested that the piece of paper which Chamberlain was waving was \"torn from the pages of \"Mein Kampf\".\" Disbelieving Chamberlain, Isaac Asimov published in July 1939 \"Trends\", which mentions a World War in 1940. He later wrote \"I was too conservative\" (about when war would begin).\n\n\"Peace In Our Time\" is the title of a 1947 stage play by Noël Coward. Set in an alternative 1940, the Battle of Britain has been lost, the Germans have supremacy in the air and the United Kingdom is under Nazi occupation. Inspired to write this play in 1946 after seeing the effects of the occupation of France Coward wrote: \"I began to suspect the physical effect of four years' intermittent bombing is far less damaging to the intrinsic character of a nation than the spiritual effect of four years of enemy occupation\".\n\n\"Peace in Our Time\" is a 1984 satirical song by Elvis Costello which references Chamberlain. It is featured on the album Goodbye Cruel World.\n\nU.S. President John F. Kennedy alluded to the speech in his 1963 American University commencement address in which he sought \"not merely peace in our time, but peace in all time.\"\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2169524", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2169524", "title": "Isis (DC Comics)", "text": "Isis (DC Comics)\n\nIsis is a DC Comics superhero, as well as a separate Egyptian goddess also living in the DC Universe. The superhero character is modeled closely after the main character of \"The Secrets of Isis\", a live-action American Saturday morning television program starring Joanna Cameron that served as the second half of \"The Shazam!/Isis Hour\". The television character appeared in several late 1970s DC Comics publications.\n\nA subsequent incarnation of the character was introduced into the DC Universe in 2006 as a female counterpart to the character Black Adam, a part of the \"Shazam!\" family of characters. The Egyptian goddess character has been depicted within the \"Wonder Woman\" comic book. \n\nLive-action programs introduced characters inspired by Isis beginning in the 2000s. The 2001 - 2011 television show \"Smallville\" depicted Isis as a superhero form taken on by Lois Lane (Erica Durance) when possessed by the Amulet of Isis in one episode, while Erica Cerra portrayed an Egyptologist named Adrianna Tomaz. The 2010s superhero show \"Legends of Tomorrow\" introduced a version of Isis named Zari Tomaz (portrayed by Tala Ashe). This version was portrayed as a wise-cracking hacker from the future with wind powers derived from an amulet and no superhero code name. In the fifth season her future changed and she became a media mogul and socialite, with her brother Behrad Tarazi (portrayed by Shayan Sobhian) taking control of the amulet.\n\nLike the main character of the first half of the program, Captain Marvel, Isis \nhad roots in ancient Egyptian mythology. \"The Secrets of Isis\" starred Joanna Cameron as Andrea Thomas, a high school science teacher who gains the ability to call upon the powers of the goddess Isis after finding an Egyptian amulet during an archeological dig in Egypt (this is revealed during the opening credits only; no \"origin episode\" was ever produced). Fifteen episodes of \"The Secrets of Isis\" were produced for \"The Shazam! Isis Hour\", and the character also appeared in three episodes of the \"Shazam!\" portion of the show. \"The Secrets of Isis\" was given its own timeslot in 1977, for which seven new episodes were broadcast alongside reruns from the first two seasons.\n\nIsis later appeared in animated form on Filmation's \"Tarzan and the Super 7\" show in 1980, as part of a segment called \"The Freedom Force\". She later guest starred on \"The Kid Super Power Hour with Shazam!\"'s \"Hero High\" segment. Cameron did not participate in these productions, with other voice actors taking over the role.\n\nIsis demonstrated numerous powers that manifested when the need arose. These included flight, super speed, super strength (to a level comparable to Superman and Wonder Woman), telekinesis (the ability to move and levitate objects), geokinesis (the ability to control elements such as fire, earth, wind, and water), the ability to change the molecules of inanimate objects to allow people to pass through them, the ability to act as a human lightning rod, remote viewing, and (at her power's maximum) the ability to stop and reverse time. To activate these powers, Isis usually is shown reciting a rhyming chant (the most frequent being \"Oh zephyr winds that blow on high, lift me now so I can fly!\"). The medallion Andrea Thomas uses to change into Isis also gives her apparent limited powers even when in her non-Isis form, as she is shown communicating telepathically with her pet crow Tut and engaging in minor mind control even without changing. She also received superior hand-to-hand and weapons combat skills from the goddess.\n\nAndrea/Isis' love interest is fellow teacher Rick Mason (although this relationship is more implied than explicitly stated, the two characters are simply shown in many episodes enjoying each other's company: going on picnics, horseback riding, and going for dinner together). As in the classic Lois Lane example, Mason remains oblivious to the physical similarities between Andrea and Isis, beyond some idle speculation in early episodes. In one episode (\"The Seeing Eye Horse\") a blind character realizes that Isis and Andrea have almost identical voices, but otherwise the series never explored the secret identity dilemma in any serious way. During the abbreviated second season, cosmetic changes were made to the Isis character in terms of makeup and hairstyle.\n\nIsis' first appearance in comics was in \"Shazam!\" #25 (Sept.–Oct. 1976). She was later given her own TV tie-in book the following month, titled \"The Mighty Isis\", which ran for two years, actually out-surviving the TV series. The eight-issue run by DC Comics began in October 1976 and ended in January 1978; early issues featured a special \"DC TV\" logo. All stories starred the Andrea Thomas character from the television series; the book was edited by Denny O'Neil, written by Jack C. Harris and most issues illustrated by Mike Vosburg (the first issue was illustrated by Ric Estrada and Wallace Wood). Although early issues stayed within the format of the TV series, later issues covered storylines beyond the scope of the show, such as a story arc involving Andrea abandoning her \"human\" alter ego and cutting ties with her friends and family, resulting in Rick Mason revealing his love for her. Like other DC characters who have been reimagined, this version of Isis, though not mentioned or appearing in \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\", can be assumed to have been retconned out of existence following the 1985 DC miniseries.\n\nIn January 2002, DC Comics re-introduced the goddess Isis as one of the chief gods worshipped by the Bana-Mighdallian Amazons in the Wonder Woman comic. Although the Bana tribe was introduced in 1989, their gods were not shown until 2002. Her introduction depicted her in a standard white sleeveless gown and Egyptian headdress containing her trademark symbol. Later, the various Amazon gods were depicted as selecting more modern appearances for themselves. After this, Isis was then shown as wearing a black business suit with skirt, long straight black hair, and a neck choker containing an ankh.\n\nThe superhero Isis was re-introduced in the DC Universe in the weekly comic book \"52\", in issue #3 (May 2006). In this series, an Egyptian woman named Adrianna Tomaz (an homage to the \"Andrea Thomas\" character on the television program) is a refugee who is enslaved and brought to Black Adam as a gift from Intergang along with $2,000,000 in gold. Upon freeing her and killing the emissaries who had brought her to him, Black Adam found her to be unafraid and highly vocal about how he could change his country for the better.\n\nAfter weeks of discussion during which Adrianna changed the way Adam looked at the world and inspired him to commit kinder acts, Adam retrieved the magical amulet of Isis from the tomb of his wife and children, and asked Captain Marvel, now the Keeper of the Rock of Eternity, to confer its power on Adrianna. The \"Amulet of Isis\" had long ago belonged to another of the wizard Shazam's champions, Queen Pharaoh Hatshepsut of the 18th Dynasty, who had used it to bring peace to her kingdom. Upon Hatshepsut's death the amulet became dormant.\n\nUpon holding the amulet and speaking \"I am Isis,\" Adrianna was transformed and instilled with the powers of the goddess. She and Adam then began traveling the Middle East and freeing enslaved children, hoping to find Adrianna's kidnapped brother. In Week 16 of the series, Adam proposes marriage to Isis, offering a jewel given to Cleopatra by Caesar; they are wed by Captain Marvel, who invokes the gods of all the universes and planets. Intergang unsuccessfully attempts to ruin the wedding with a suicide bomber. Several other \"Shazam!\" characters attend the ceremony, and Mary Marvel, Captain Marvel, Jr., Tawky Tawny and Uncle Dudley serve as members of the wedding party. Isis is a calming influence on Black Adam, transforming him from a ruthless dictator into a more benevolent figure.\n\nThis incarnation of Isis has powers similar to Black Adam's. She can also heal wounds of nearly any severity. She has control over nature, related to her mood: rain falls when she's sad even if she is inside, flowers bloom when she is happy. Her first transformation is triggered by the phrase \"I am Isis\", but later transformations use the phrase, \"Oh Mighty Isis\" instead.\n\nAdrianna finally locates her brother Amon, who has been tortured and crippled by Whisper A'Daire for his refusal to join Intergang's religion of crime and for his multiple escape attempts. Isis stops Black Adam from taking revenge on the Intergang members. Isis is unable to fully heal Amon's wounds because they are too deep and complex. Black Adam asks Amon to say his name; upon doing so, Amon is struck by Shazam's mystic lightning bolt and transformed into Osiris. Reunited with her brother, Isis decides to change the world beginning with China. Osiris convinces her to also change the public perception of the Black Marvel Family. Isis coaxes Black Adam into joining them in a public unmasking of their secret identities and a public declaration of their good intentions for the future. The Black Marvels defeat the demon Sabbac at Halloween when he tries to sacrifice children to Neron, further increasing their popularity. During a charity dinner with Mrs. Sivana, Osiris befriends a humanoid crocodile, Sobek, that escaped from Sivana's lab.\n\nAmanda Waller is not convinced of the Black Marvels' good intentions, and she forms a new Suicide Squad. She sends the Persuader to attack Isis with his radioactive ax. Osiris rushes to help her and he cuts the Persuader in half. Osiris is distraught over the unintentional death, and Isis whisks him away from the scene. Photographic evidence of the incident turns public opinion against the Black Marvel Family. Osiris believes that his powers make him evil, and he blames Black Adam. A series of calculated events arranged by Intergang lead to Osiris' death at the hands of Sobek. The Black Marvels battle with the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, manifested in physical forms controlled by Intergang and Doctor Sivana.\n\nIsis dies when she is infected with diseases from the Horseman, Pestilence, while she defends Adam against the Horseman, Death. Before she dies, Isis tells Adam that she was wrong in trying to change him, and she begs him to avenge her and Osiris' deaths. Adam's path of vengeance instigates World War III. Several weeks later, an unidentified individual takes Isis' amulet; Adrianna appears to be trapped inside it.\n\nIn \"Black Adam: The Dark Age\", Adam (now under his civilian title of \"Teth-Adam\") gets into Khandaq under a false name, and takes her remains despite a shootout in which nearly all his men are killed. In the mountains, he is forced to eat his servant Hassan who offers himself to Black Adam. He fails to notice that he has dropped one of her fingers and her ring at the tomb. He resurrects Isis using the Lazarus Pit. Her resurrection is short lived, as Adam is forced to kill Isis again upon seeing her new body rotting away as soon as she has come back to life. Her bones are then transferred to Doctor Fate's tower, where, with the assistance of Felix Faust, Adam turns them into a magical conduit to imbue himself with god-like powers taken from Isis' corpse itself. Apparently, Isis still could be revived, but every time Adam takes power from her, her bones become more brittle, jeopardizing a new attempt at resurrection. Faust reveals that it is Isis' amulet that can revive her, and that Mary Marvel and Captain Marvel Jr. broke it into four parts and scattered it across the globe. It is later revealed that the missing fragments of her body, the reason the Lazarus Pit failed, were being held by Atom-Smasher who found it when the Justice Society investigated the tomb. He meets Black Adam and gives them to him.\n\nFinally, Black Adam manages to find the pieces of the amulet and reunites it with the now-complete skeleton. The spell apparently backfires, resulting in a shambling, rotting corpse. A séance takes place in which Isis' spirit swears eternal hate for her husband, before returning to death. Black Adam flees, laden with guilt, emptiness, and rage; then Faust begins the real rite, having shown Black Adam the skeleton of Ralph Dibny as a way to hide the real Isis from him and blame \"her\" rotten condition on Black Adam's abuse of their now-shared powers. So Isis is able to be fully restored to life, even if bound by powerful spells to drain her will and bind her to mindless obedience. Now a mere puppet in Faust's hands, Isis' magic is used to free him from his imprisonment in Fate's tower by creating a magical doorway through the tower wall. Felix Faust then drags her away to a hideout, where it is strongly implied that he sexually assaults the paralyzed Isis.\n\nLater, Black Adam, still mourning for her, finds a bloodied flower sprouting in their family shrine. He takes it as a sign that Isis is trying to communicate with him, which becomes apparent when he finds a larger collection of flowers in the shape of the Shazam lightning bolt symbol, pointing in the direction Adam must go to find her. Eventually, Black Adam finds Isis and Felix Faust, and Adam forces Faust to release Isis from his control. The resurrected Isis is far less merciful and forgiving than before, and castrates Faust for his treatment of her. Reunited, Isis and Adam travel to the Rock of Eternity, where they banish Captain Marvel back to Earth as a powerless Billy Batson (Isis has turned him back using magic lightning from saying Shazam from a spell book) and begin setting a plan in motion to \"cleanse the Earth\" of evil their way, even recruiting Mary Marvel to their crusade. The Justice Society come to the Rock of Eternity, seeking to help Billy, only for Isis to brutally attack them, even throwing Jay Garrick into the mists covering the Rock, from which there is no escape. During the course of the fight, the combatants end up in Kahndaq, where the people praise Black Adam's return. Isis then kills several of the followers, claiming that they are tainted by this new Earth. Black Adam attempts to protect his people, only to be attacked by Mary and Billy, who had been tainted by Mary's power. At that point, Jay Garrick appears with the spirit of Billy's father, and Shazam, whom the former had helped Jay recover from the Rock of Finality. Adam is convinced to return his power to Shazam so that the wizard's spirit can save Isis from her corruption. Shazam is released from his stone form. In turn, Shazam takes the power from Isis, Billy, and Mary, and transforms Teth-Adam and Adrianna into statues. Some time later, a shadowy figure appears to the statues in a bolt of lightning, wanting them to be his \"champions.\"\n\nAfter the events of the \"Blackest Night\" storyline, Osiris is resurrected by the White Lantern Entity and returns to Khandaq, vowing to restore the kingdom to its former prosperity. Osiris takes the petrified bodies of Adam and Isis and flies off to an unknown destination. Despite his best efforts, Osiris is unable to return Adam and Adrianna to their living states. He ultimately aligns himself with Deathstroke and his new team of after being told that the mercenary can help him return his family to life. Both Adrianna and Teth-Adam are currently stored in Deathstroke's base of operations, the Labyrinth.\n\nIt is ultimately revealed by the White Lantern Entity that Osiris was resurrected with the express purpose of saving Adrianna from her fate. During a battle with a drug kingpin named Elijah, Osiris experiences a vision of Isis after falling asleep due to the villain Pisces. He is told that he is guilty for his hand in the murder of Ryan Choi, and that in order to free her, he will have to kill more people. Osiris accidentally electrocutes Elijah after waking from his vision after yelling 'Isis,' and returns home to find that more cracks have appeared on Isis' statue. He then surmises that it was Elijah's death which caused the cracks, and states that he will indeed have to kill more people to free Isis from her prison. He then kills a guard at Arkham Asylum using his lightning channelled by saying 'Isis' again, although he seems to not enjoy this action, saying 'Great Ra forgive me.' After killing two bank robbers, Osiris is confronted by Freddy Freeman. Somehow, Osiris manages to steal Freddy's power and give it to Isis. However, Isis' first words upon being reunited with her brother are \"What have you done to me?\" It is soon revealed that the killings Osiris did in her name have corrupted her soul, causing her to haphazardly shift between her kind, caring personality and a callous, cruel one. When Osiris' back is turned, Isis breaks out of the Labyrinth. She goes on a rampage, unable to stop herself from using nature to try to destroy the world. In desperation, she attempts to commit suicide by lightning, but Osiris shields her with his own body. When they awake, Isis discovers that the corruption has left her, but she still feels it inside Osiris, and it worries her.\n\nIt was later revealed by the Entity that Isis was brought back to life because she's the one that will aid the Swamp Thing.\n\nLater, Isis aids her brother Osiris in stopping the Quraci soldiers who are attacking Khandaq. Isis learns that Osiris has become more violent, killing the soldiers. When the Justice League attacks Deathstroke's Titans, they are stopped by Isis, who forces them to leave Khandaq at once. She declares her rulership of Khandaq, and withdraws the country from the United Nations, stating that they will outlaw outsiders and recognize no power but their own, and that any intrusion will incite \"World War III\". The Justice League's only option is to leave, and Deathstroke's Titans leave as well. Isis then tells Osiris that he is not welcome in Khandaq, because of his bloodlust.\n\nIn September 2011, The New 52 rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, Adrianna Tomaz is a young woman who, by fighting pacifically against Khandaq's evil rule, is opposed to her brother Amon entering The Sons of Adam terrorist group. However, after he is killed by Khandaq's forces and she is forced to resurrect Black Adam, Adrianna decides to follow a path of violence, with an unknown voice saying that she will be chosen to wield power.\n\nIn order to change form, Adrianna must be able to say \"I am Isis\", thereby invoking spells involving the energies of the extra-dimensional being once known as Isis on Earth. This spell adds almost a hundred pounds of impervious godly muscle and tissue to her frame. This spell seems to be solely vocal; she cannot access this spell if she is gagged or hampered in some way from talking (the precision of this spell is somewhat erratic). All Adrianna has to say is \"I am Isis\" and she is mystically transformed and instilled with the powers of the goddess. It was later revealed that the powers that Adrianna draws from Isis are the most powerful of the eight Egyptian Gods. When her powers were possessed by Black Adam, he was able to fight off most of the superheroes on Earth alone. When Black Adam transferred both his and Isis's powers to Mary Marvel, she was able to easily withstand Darkseid's Omega Beams.\n\nAfter transforming, Adrianna/Isis gains physical abilities similar to her brother, husband, and the other Marvels. She is superhumanly strong and is easily capable of lifting far in excess of 100 tons, putting her on the same level as Supergirl, Power Girl, Mary Marvel, Donna Troy, Big Barda and Wonder Woman. Isis is also incredibly durable and cannot be harmed by physical force unless the being she is engaged with is stronger than her. She is also totally bulletproof and bladed weapons shatter against her skin. She is superhumanly fast, capable of moving at speeds past mach 10 on Earth. Isis also has far superior reflexes and agility when compared to normal humans or even other superhumans. She is also able to mystically fly through the air at incredible speeds and can travel across and around the planet in minutes. Like the other Marvels, Isis possesses an immense degree of superhuman intelligence, allowing her to come up with solutions to complicated problems quickly. Unlike the other Marvels, Isis's powers focus on the control of nature. She has control over water, fire, earth, air and electricity, and can control the weather and the lava within the Earth. These powers are tied to her emotions. When she cried, it began to rain and when she grew angry, enormous roses crushed the buildings around her. Simply put, Isis is nature and can control its every aspect. In addition to her manipulation of natural materials, Isis possesses the power of telekinesis, allowing her to lift objects, fire blasts of telekinetic force, and to create telekinetic shields. Isis's godly energies are able to heal nearly any wound that has been inflicted upon her with surprising speed (though she has died before). Using a second amulet, Isis is able to achieve clairvoyance and is able to see events happening in the present at remote locations. However, she cannot use this power to see into the past or the future. Due to her death and subsequent resurrection, Isis had a bit of trouble controlling her powers for a time. She stated that this was because Nature had deemed her a failed subject, but she has since regained full control.\n\nIn the alternate timeline of the \"Flashpoint\" event, Isis is mentioned by her brother, Osiris, believing that she has been killed by the Atlanteans/Amazons war. It is revealed that Isis was held captive by the Outsider for Black Adam into selling the Outsider his home country, Khandaq. The Outsider then shot Black Adam and threw him off of his train, joining Isis as his trophy/prisoner.\n\n\n\n\nFans of the TV series, with support from Joanna Cameron, lobbied for the release of the series to DVD for several years. BCI/Ink and Paint has released three DVD sets containing the TV character of Isis:\n\n\nDespite her stated support for the DVD release, Cameron did not participate in the release of the live-action series DVD.\n\n"}
{"id": "2169532", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2169532", "title": "John 1", "text": "John 1\n\nJohn 1 is the first chapter in the Gospel of John in the New Testament of the Christian Bible. The book containing this chapter is anonymous, but early Christian tradition uniformly affirmed that John composed this gospel.\n\nThe original text was written in Koine Greek. This chapter is divided into 51 verses.\n\nSome early manuscripts containing the text of this chapter are:\n\nThe first chapter of the Gospel of John has 51 verses and may be divided in three parts:\nEnglish language versions which typically divide biblical chapters into sections often have more divisions: there are 5 sections in the New International Version and the Good News Translation, and 7 sections in the New King James Version.\n\nThe first part (verses 1–18), often called the \"Hymn to the Word\", is a prologue to the gospel as a whole, stating that the Logos is \"God\" (\"divine\", \"god-like\", or \"a god\" according to some translations).\n\nComparisons can be made between these verses and the narrative of , where the same phrase \"In the beginning\" first occurs along with the emphasis on the difference between the darkness (such as the \"earth was formless and void\", ) and the light (the ability to see things not understood/hidden by the darkness, ).\n\nMethodist founder John Wesley summarised the opening verses of John 1 as follows:\n\nAccording to the writers of the Pulpit Commentary, the phrase \"the light of men\" () \"has been differently conceived by expositors. John Calvin supposed that the \"understanding\" was intended—\"that the life of men was not of an ordinary description, but was united to the light of understanding,\" and is that by which man is differentiated from animals. Hengstenberg regards it, in consequence of numerous associations of \"light\" with \"salvation\" in Holy Scripture, as equivalent to salvation; Christoph Ernst Luthardt with \"holiness\" and many with the \"eternal life\", which would introduce great tautology.\"\n\nEnglish translations of variously translate the Greek as \"understanding\" (e.g. the New King James Version: \"the light shines in the darkness, and the darkness did not comprehend it\"), but in other translations the meaning is given in terms of a struggle between darkness and light: \"the light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it\" (Revised Standard Version). Verses 10 and 11 state that \"He was in the world, and the world was made through Him, and the world did not know Him. He came to His own, and His own did not receive Him\" but theologians differ in their interpretation of these verses. Wesley viewed \"in the world\" as meaning \"even from the creation\", the Pulpit Commentary speaks of the \"pre-Incarnation activity\" of the Word and Joseph Benson wrote that \"He was in the world ... from the beginning, frequently appearing, and making known to his servants, the patriarchs and prophets, the divine will, in dreams and visions, and various other ways\", whereas in Albert Barnes' opinion, \"He was in the world [...] refers, probably, not to his pre-existence, but to the fact that he became incarnate; that he dwelt among human beings\".\n\nThe word \"flesh\" is emphasized as a 'symbol of humanity', drawing the attention to 'the entry of the Word into the full flow of human affairs'.\n\nThe summation of the comparison between darkness and light occurs in the statement \"the law was given through Moses [...] grace and truth came through Jesus Christ\" (). Here John successfully bridges the gap for the reader—including Jewish readers well-versed in the Torah—from the Law to the One who would fulfill the Law (such as the requirement of animal sacrifice for the forgiveness of sins, ), Jesus.\n\nThe end verse of this prologue recalls , that no other possibility of human to know God except through Jesus Christ.\n\nThe second part (verses 19–34) shows the preparation that John the Baptist was in the process of making for the coming of the Messiah, the Messiah's arrival and the Messiah's first disciples. John has been introduced in verse 6 (\"a man sent from God\") and his witness, known already by the reader, has already been recalled: \"This is the One I told you about\". The Greek text has the past tense () but both Charles Ellicott and the Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges prefer a present tense translation such as \"John bears witness\". Verses 19–34 present John's manifesto, delivered to the priests and Levites sent by the Pharisees to investigate his message and purpose. In response to their enquiries, John confesses that he is not the Messiah, nor the reappearance of the prophet Elijah (contrast , where Jesus states that John is \"Elijah who is to come\"), nor \"the prophet\".\n\nJohn then reveals that when the One comes he would be unfit to even so much as untie his sandals, let alone baptize Him like the many he had up to that point. No sooner than the next day the Messiah appears before John the Baptist, and he then acknowledges Jesus as the Lamb of God (verse 29) of whom he had been speaking (verse 30).\n\nThe evangelist divides this series of events into four 'days': the day (or period) when the Jerusalem delegation met John to enquire into his identity and purpose (verses 19–29) is followed by John seeing Jesus coming towards him \"the next day\" (verse 29), and on \"the next day again\" he directs his own disciples towards following Jesus (verses 35–37). A fourth 'day' follows (verse 43) on which Jesus wanted to go to Galilee and invited Philip to follow him. Bengel calls these \"Great Days!\"\n\nAs the chapter progresses further, the gospel describes how Jesus calls his first disciples, Andrew and an unnamed disciple (verses 35–40). The unnamed disciple was possibly John, the evangelist. Andrew finds his brother Simon (verses 41–42), and Jesus changes Simon's name to Cephas (Peter) (verse 42). Cephas, original Greek: (), means \"a rock\" (Young's Literal Translation) or \"a stone\" (King James Version). This provided a powerful analogy as to the role Peter would have after the crucifixion; to lead the development of the church. Name changes occur in other places in the Bible and demonstrate God's authority as well as what that person would become, do, or had done, such as Abram to Abraham and Jacob to Israel. Jesus' first active sign of power was to Nathaniel, who was thoroughly impressed by Jesus' foreknowledge of his personal character.\n\nWithin these verses Jesus is given the following titles:\n\nThe first appearance of the \"disciple whom Jesus loved\" in this Gospel is as one of the two disciples of John the Baptist who become the first followers of Jesus, but this is indicated in a subtle way. Bauckham notes the occurrence of at least two specific words in the narratives of both the first and the last appearance of this disciple: \"to follow\" (Greek: \") and \"to remain/stay\" (Greek: , \"). In verse it is stated that \"Jesus turned, and seeing them following ('akolouthountas'), said to them, \"What do you seek?\"\", then in verse they \"remained ('emeinan') with Him that day\". In the last chapter of the Gospel, the last appearance of the 'Disciple whom Jesus loved' is indicated using similar words: in verse it is written that \"Peter, turning around, saw the disciple whom Jesus loved following ('akolouthounta')\", then in verse \"Jesus said to him [Peter], \"If I will that he remain ('menein') till I come, what is that to you?\" Bauckham sees the placement of the appearances of the disciple as \"the \"inclusio\" of eyewitness testimony\" to privilege his witness (in the Gospel of John ) over Peter's, not to denigrate Peter's authority, but rather to claim a distinct qualification as an 'ideal witness' to Christ, because he survives Peter and bears his witness after Peter. The appearances are also close to Peter's, as the first one, along with Andrew, happened just before Peter's, who was then given the name 'Cephas' (alluding Peter's role after Jesus' departure), and the last one, just after Jesus' dialogue with Peter, acknowledging the significance of Peter's testimony within \"the Petrine's \"inclusio\"\", which is also found in the Gospel of Mark and Luke (see Luke 8 under \"The Women who sustained Jesus\").\n\nVerses 1:19 to 2:1 contains a chronological record of an eyewitness:\n\nIn the Latin Rite of the Catholic Church and in Western Rite Orthodoxy, the chapter's first fourteen verses are known as the \"Last Gospel\", as they are recited at the end of the Tridentine Mass (or \"Extraordinary Form\") of the Mass. This is distinct from the Proclamation of the Gospel that occurs much earlier in the service.\n\nAfter reciting the dismissal formula , the priest reads the Last Gospel in Latin from the altar card to their left. At the beginning of verse 14, (\"And the Word became flesh\"), they genuflect. Any congregants present, who remain standing for the reading, would kneel at this point, responding with (\"Thanks be to God\") at its conclusion.\n\nThis ritual began as a private devotion for the priest after Mass. It is not part of the 1969 Mass of Paul VI (known as the \"Ordinary Form\" widely used today) that was introduced after the Second Vatican Council.\n\n\n"}

Set in an indeterminate country this novel is informed by the corrupt politics and the Mafia of Sciascia's experiences in 1970s Sicily.\n\nThe book starts with the murder of District Attorney Vargas, who is prosecuting a high-profile case. The subsequent investigation failing, the police assign the protagonist Inspector Rogas, \"the shrewdest investigator at the disposal of the police,\" to solve the case. While he is starting his investigation, two judges are killed. After Rogas discovers evidence of corruption surrounding the three government officials, he is encouraged by superiors \"not to forage after gossip,\" but to trail the \"crazy lunatic who for no reason whatever was going about murdering judges.\" This near admission of guilt drives Rogas to seek out those wrongfully convicted by the murdered judges.\n\nRogas finds his likely suspect in Cres, a man who was convicted of attempting to kill his wife. Mrs. Cres accused her husband of trying to kill her by poisoning her rice, which she escaped only because she fed a small portion first to her cat, who died. Rogas concludes that he was probably framed by his wife, and seeks him out, only to find that he has sneaked away from his house. Meanwhile, another district attorney is killed, and eyewitnesses see two young revolutionaries running away from the scene. Rogas, close to finding his man, is demoted, and told to work with the political division to pin the crimes on the revolutionary Left.\n\nFrom this point, Rogas finds Galano, the editor of a revolutionary paper, and has his phone tapped. This leads to Rogas discovering the Minister of Justice at a party with many revolutionary leaders. After this, he and the Minister have a discussion, where the Minister claims he would prefer the revolution, but feels the country is not ready. Following this, Rogas speaks to the President of the Supreme Court, who details a philosophy of justice wherein the court is incapable of error by definition. He also discovers that his suspect, Cres, is in the same complex as the President, but Rogas does not pursue him, hoping that he will kill the President. After Rogas realizes that Cres lives in the complex under a pseudonym and wasn't there to commit a murder, he meets with the Secretary-General of the revolutionary party. Both of them are killed. The book ends with the murder of the Secretary-General being blamed on Rogas.\n\n\"Equal Danger\" is available in paperback under (New York: NYRB Classics, 2003).\n\nA film adaptation of \"Il contesto\" was directed by Francesco Rosi and released in Italy on 12 February 1976.\n\n"}

Despite dozens of appearances in television series and theatrical films, he remains best known as the original \"Chester\" in the radio version of \"Gunsmoke\".\n\nBorn in Salt Lake City, Utah, Baer had a circus background, but began his radio career at Utah station KSL. He studied drama at the University of Utah.\n\nEarly in his career, Baer was a circus ringmaster and publicist. He left those roles for military service in World War II. In the 1950s, he had a job training wild animals at Jungleland USA in Thousand Oaks, California. Still later, he served as a docent at the Los Angeles Zoo.\n\nBaer was a member of the United States Army Air Force during World War II, serving in the Pacific Theatre and earning seven service stars.\n\nBaer in the 1930s served on radio as director of special events for KSL. His first network show was \"The Whistler\", which was soon followed by appearances on \"Escape\" (notably narrating \"Wild Jack Rhett\" and as the title patriot in an adaptation of Stephen Vincent Benet's \"A Tooth for Paul Revere\"), \"Suspense\", \"Tales of the Texas Rangers\" (as various local sheriffs), \"Dragnet\", \"The CBS Radio Workshop\", \"Lux Radio Theater\", \"The Six Shooter\", and \"Yours Truly, Johnny Dollar\", to name a few.\n\nIn 1952, he began playing Chester, the trusty jailhouse assistant to Marshal Matt Dillon on \"Gunsmoke\", eventually ad-libbing the character's full name, \"Chester Wesley Proudfoot\" (later changed to \"Chester Goode\" in the televised version of the series, which featured Dennis Weaver in the role of Chester). Baer's portrayal of Chester was generally considered his finest and most memorable role, and as he often said, the one he found most fulfilling. Baer also worked as a voice actor on several other radio shows produced by Norman MacDonnell, performing as Pete the Marshal on the situation comedy \"The Harold Peary Show\", as Doc Clemens on \"Rogers of the Gazette\", and as additional characters on \"Fort Laramie\" and \"The Adventures of Philip Marlowe\".\n\nOther recurring roles included Eb the farm hand on \"Granby's Green Acres\" (the radio predecessor to television's \"Green Acres\"), Gramps on \"The Truitts\", and Rene the manservant on the radio version of \"The Count of Monte Cristo\". His later radio work included playing Reginald Duffield and Uncle Joe Finneman on the Focus on the Family series \"Adventures in Odyssey\" in the 1980s and 1990s.\n\nRadio playwright and director Norman Corwin cast Baer as Simon Legree in the 1969 KCET television reading of his 1938 radio play \"The Plot to Overthrow Christmas\".\n\nAs an on-camera performer, Baer was recognizable by his distinctive voice, his paunchy appearance, and his balding head. Often he portrayed fussy, bossy, and/or obstinate officials or neighbors. Extended television roles included blustering, by-the-book Mayor Stoner on \"The Andy Griffith Show\", the neighbor Darby on \"The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet\", frequent guest appearances on \"The Addams Family\" as insurance man and city commissioner Arthur J. Henson, and in the late 1990s, Miles Dugan on \"The Young and the Restless\".

He made six guest appearances on \"Perry Mason\" during the last five seasons of the CBS legal drama, including the role of Edward Farraday in the 1962 episode, \"The Case of the Captain's Coins,\" and Willard Hupp in the 1963 episode, \"The Case of the Bouncing Boomerang.\"\n\nHe also appeared on the ABC sitcom \"Harrigan and Son\", on the ABC/Warner Bros. crime drama, \"The Roaring 20s\", on NBC's crime drama \"Dan Raven\" starring Skip Homeier, and on the NBC family drama, \"National Velvet\". Baer was cast twice on Walter Brennan's sitcom, \"The Real McCoys\". He also guest-starred on the CBS sitcoms \"Dennis the Menace\", with Jay North, and \"Angel\", starring Annie Fargé.

On April 13, 1962, he appeared, along with Frank Ferguson and Royal Dano in ABC's crime drama \"\" in the episode \"Journey into Mourning\". He was cast as hotel owner Mr. Kringelein in the 1962 film, \"Gypsy\", opposite Natalie Wood and Rosalind Russell.\nIn 1963, Baer appeared with Charles Aidman and Karl Swenson in the three-part episode \"Security Risk\", a story of international blackmail and intrigue, on the CBS anthology series, \"GE True\", hosted by Jack Webb.\n\nIn 1964, Baer was cast as a sheriff in an episode of Mickey Rooney's short-lived \"Mickey\" sitcom, and as a scientist in an \"Outer Limits\" episode, \"Behold, Eck!\" He was seen in four episodes of \"Hogan's Heroes\" and eight episodes of \"Bewitched\" in various roles as advertising clients of McMann and Tate.\n\nBaer was cast as Horace Greeley, who came to Colorado in 1859 in the Pikes Peak Gold Rush, in the 1965 episode \"The Great Turkey War\" of the syndicated series, \"Death Valley Days\".

He also appeared in \"Two on a Guillotine\" and \"Dave\" (as the Senate majority leader). Baer had a featured role in the 1958 war drama \"The Young Lions\", portraying a German officer and friend of Marlon Brando.\n\nIn perhaps his greatest theatrical performance, Baer was especially proud of his brief appearance in a little-known film, \"White Dog\", a powerful story about racism. Baer plays a character seen at first as a kindly grandfather, only to reveal himself as a hateful bigot who has trained the title character to attack black skin. Baer remarked, \"Often racism, like true evil, presents itself with a smile and a handshake\".\n\nSome 10 years earlier, Baer played a closet racist in a well-known Christmas episode of \"Bewitched\". The episode \"Sisters at Heart\" aired on ABC on December 24, 1970, in which he played the role of Mr. Brockway, the owner of a toy-manufacturing firm.\n\nBaer voiced Ernie Keebler in the cookie commercials before he suffered a stroke in 1997 which affected both speech and movement. He recovered sufficiently to make a handful of appearances at old-time radio conventions in his later years. In the 1980's he dressed in old-time garb as \"Mr. S\", one of the company founders, in commercials for S&W Fine Foods. \n\nIn 1946, Baer met and married circus aerialist and bareback rider Ernestine Clarke. They were together for 54 years until her death on August 5, 2000, in Tarzana, California. \nBaer was a long-term member of St. Nicholas Episcopal Church in Encino, California, where he served in many capacities, including head usher.\n\nIn 1969, Baer gave the eulogy at the funeral of \"The Andy Griffith Show\" castmate Howard McNear. McNear had portrayed Mayberry's Floyd the Barber and Baer had played Mayor Roy Stoner. McNear also portrayed Doc Adams in the radio version of \"Gunsmoke\", often interacting with Baer's character, Chester Proudfoot.\n\nOn November 11, 2002, following another stroke, Baer was taken to the Motion Picture & Television Country House and Hospital. Eleven days later, at the age of 88, he died there.\n\n\n\n"}

They are primarily marine, though some species are known to live in fresh or brackish waters. The various species of this family are known informally as stonefish, stinger, stingfish and ghouls. The most prominent genus of the family is \"Synanceia\", which is sometimes placed in the family Scorpaenidae. Its species are known to have the most potent neurotoxins of all the fish venoms, secreted from glands at the base of their needle-like dorsal fin spines. The vernacular name of the species derives from their behaviour of camouflaging as rocks. The type species of the family is the stonefish, \"Synanceia verrucosa\".\n"}

The company was founded by Marshall & Company and took its name from their Belsize works, where they had built bicycles.\n\nMarshall & Company of Clayton Lane, probably Manchester's first automobile manufacturer, built its first car in 1897. The cars were very similar to the French Hurtu, itself a Benz replica, and were sold badged as Marshalls.\n\nAgencies were established in London and Dublin and the car gained a Gold Medal for efficiency at the 1899 London exhibition. A new more modern four-seat model appeared in 1901 with twin-cylinder engine made by Buchet and was the first to carry the Belsize name as the \"Marshall Belsize\". In 1903 the company name was changed to Belsize Motors and Engineering. In 1906 this changed again to Belsize Motors Ltd.\n\nBefore the First World War they were a major player in the United Kingdom's motor industry, employing 1200 people and making up to 50 vehicles a week. A bewildering range of models were made including taxis, commercial vehicles and fire engines with engines of up to 14.5 litre capacity.\n\nAfter the First World War they followed a single model policy at first with the 15 hp of 2798 cc but this was joined in 1921 by the Belsize-Bradshaw with a 9 hp 1294 cc V-twin engine made by Dorman and designed by Granville Bradshaw that was partly air-cooled and partly oil-cooled. This gained a reputation for being unreliable and was dropped in 1924. It was replaced by a 1250 cc conventional 4-cylinder model, the 10/20 or RM, and a 1696 cc six the 14/30. The latter was at last an up-to-date car with overhead valves, four-wheel brakes and a four-speed gearbox, but at £415 to £650 it was expensive when compared with the opposition. It was however, too late. The company, which had been in the hands of the receiver since 1923, ceased trading in late 1925.\n\nThe company also tried to build a 2496 cc, straight eight engine but this probably never got past the prototype stage although it was advertised at £1050.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2169584", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2169584", "title": "Neckbreaker", "text": "Neckbreaker\n\nIn professional wrestling, a neckbreaker is any throw or slam that focuses its attack on the opponent's neck. One type of neckbreaker involves the wrestler slamming an opponent's neck against a part of the wrestler's body, usually the knee, head or shoulder. The other type of neckbreaker is a slam technique in which the wrestler throws an opponent to the ground by twisting the opponent's neck. This also refers to a \"back head slam\" where a wrestler drops to the mat while holding an opponent by their neck.\n\nThe attacking wrestler first places their opponent face-up across their shoulders, as in an Argentine backbreaker rack, and hooks the opponent's head with one hand and their leg with the other. From here, the attacking wrestler throws the legs of the opponent out backwards and drops down to the mat while holding onto the opponent's head, dragging the opponent down with them to drive their back into the ground and the back of the opponent's neck into the shoulder of the attacking wrestler.\n\nThis move sees an attacking wrestler take hold of an arm of an opponent and then move to a back to back position, so that the opponent's arm hooks across and round the opponent's own head. At this point, the attacking wrestler falls backwards to the ground, forcing the opponent's own arm to drag them to the mat. A straight jacket variation, also known as a cross-armed neckbreaker and double handcuff neckbreaker, exists and sees where the wrestler face their opponent, grab both of their arms and twist around so they have their opponent in a straight jacket hold before finally dropping down to drag the opponent to the floor. This move was best known as William Regal's finisher in the later half of his career, in which he called it the \"Regal Cutter\" and Gail Kim used this move, known as \"Happy Ending,\"\n\nAlso known as a standing somersault neckbreaker and/or rolling neckbreaker, this move sees the attacking wrestler place the opponent in a three-quarter facelock and perform a somersault forwards, then falls down supine, using the momentum of the flip to twist the opponent's neck and back into the ground. John Morrison uses this move calling it the \"Moonlight Drive\".\n\nAn elevated neckbreaker refers to any neckbreaker performed on an opponent who is held on an elevated position. Normally a wrestler places the opponent on the turnbuckle so that they face away from the ring. The wrestler takes hold of the opponent by their neck, and from this position performs many variations of the neckbreaker, like falling to a sitting or kneeling position, or just running forward and pulling the opponent away from the corner, and dropping them in a standard neckbreaker. There are also double team variations.\n\nIn this variation of a muscle buster, which focuses more of the attack on the neck, a wrestler holds his or her opponent upside-down, with both legs hooked and with the back of the opponent's neck against the wrestler's shoulder and then drops to a kneeling or sitting position so that the opponent’s neck hits against the shoulder. It is usually performed against an opponent who is sitting on the top turnbuckle.\n\nA move in which the attacking wrestler performs a gutwrench and lifts the opponent so that their back rests across one of the wrestler's shoulders. The wrestler then reaches forward with both hands and grabs the opponent under the chin. At this point, the wrestler would drop down to the mat backwards, causing the opponent to drop from an elevated height and land on the back of their neck.\n\nThis moves sees a wrestler take an opponent across their shoulders in a fireman's carry. Once there the wrestler does a fireman's carry slam, extending the knee adjacent to the opponent's face and neck. The opponent then lands neck-first across the extended knee, snapping their neck in a similar manner to a shoulder neckbreaker. This move was popularized by Hirooki Goto, who calls it the \"Ushigoroshi\".\n\nThis neckbreaker variation is based on an amateur wrestling technique that requires the wrestler to capture their opponent in a front facelock, as well trap the arm closest to the wrestler's body in the facelock. The wrestler will then spin their body opposite the opponent, either releasing their opponent or continuing to spin with the hold intact. The wrestler can perform the move from a standing position for more impact or from a kneeling position as a wear-down hold.\n\nA hip toss neckbreaker involves the attacker delivering a hip toss to his opponent, and while the opponent is falling down on his back in mid-air, the attacker grabs the opponent's head and neck to execute a neckbreaker, falling down to the mat with the opponent.\n\nThis move sees the wrestler stand behind his opponent, bends them backwards, and apply an inverted facelock. The wrestler then drops down to a single knee with the extended knee impacting with the neck of the opponent.\n\nAlso known as a falling neckbreaker, this move sees the attacking wrestler stand back to back with their opponent, then reaches over their shoulder and takes hold of the opponent by their head or neck. The wrestler then falls to their back while maintaining the hold, dragging the opponent down with them to drive their back into the ground. This move is often used by a wrestler who ducks under an attempted attack by the opponent, such as a clothesline, and is thus back to back with their opponent. A jumping variation also exists. Mickie James popularized this maneuver.\n\nThis is a move in which a wrestler places their opponent in an inverted facelock and then pivots 180°, catching the opponent's head with their free arm (or both arms) and then dropping down onto their back so that both wrestlers are in a supine position, as in a neckbreaker slam. Innovated by Steve Corino, who calls it the \"Old School Expulsion\", this move is also known as a \"Reverse \"Twist of Fate\"\".\n\nThis is a version of a swinging neckbreaker where the attacking wrestler would use a leg rather than hands to perform the twist. With the opponent bent forwards (presumes the opponent is spun around, neck landing on the inside of the wrestler's knee.\n\nA move described as an inverted overdrive is another version of a swinging neckbreaker, in which the attacking wrestler would use a leg (in this case a knee) rather than hands to perform the twist. In this move a wrestler would first place one knee (the one closest to an opponent) against the base of the opponent's neck, who is leaning forward, while underhooking one of the opponent's arms (the furthest one) before falling backwards down to the mat as the opponent is spun over, landing on the back of the head on the attacking wrestler's knee.\n\nThis version of the neckbreaker sees the attacking wrestler put his opponent in a half nelson pumphandle position and lift him up as one would with a vertical suplex and then drop down onto one knee as the opponent's neck is sent down onto the other knee. This move was popularized by Kevin Steen.\n\nBetter known as a hangman's neckbreaker and also known as a kneeling neckbreaker or a sitout neckbreaker. From a back to back position, the attacking wrestler reaches back and pulls the opponent's head over their shoulder, then drops to a sitting, kneeling, or a split-legged position, causing the back of the opponent's neck to impact on the shoulder of the attacking wrestler. Another version of this move is similar to the neckbreaker slam which sees both wrestlers fall to their backs with the opponent's neck being forced down to the mat instead of onto the attacking wrestler's shoulder. A swinging version also exists. This move was the longtime finisher for \"Ravishing\" Rick Rude, who called it the \"Rude Awakening\" and was also the finisher of former WWE wrestler Layla who referred to the move as \"The LayOut\"\n\nThe elevated shoulder neckbreaker, first sees the attacking wrestler lift an opponent into a position where the opponent and the wrestler are back to back with the opponent's head pulled across the shoulder of the attacking wrestler and their legs hooked over the wrestler's legs (the Gory special). From this position the attacking wrestler will drop to a sitting or kneeling position, driving the back of the opponent's neck into the shoulder of an attacking wrestler and the knees of the opponent into the mat. This move can also see the opponent's neck placed over the attacking wrestler's head instead of their shoulder. This move is also famously known as the \"Widow's Peak\", used by former WWE Diva and former Impact Wrestling Knockout, Lisa Marie Varon, better known as Victoria.\n\nAlso known as a front flip neckbreaker, the attacking wrestler stands in front of and facing a sitting opponent before running toward them and performing a somersault over them. As the wrestler falls, they grab the opponent by the head or neck, driving the opponent's head backwards to mat with both wrestlers landing on their backs. The maneuver can also be used against a standing opponent, usually when they are bent over. The standing variation can be used as a counter to a vertical suplex or a similar maneuver.\n\nIn this variation, the attacking wrestler stands behind and facing a sitting opponent before running toward them and performing a somersault over them. As the wrestler falls, they grab the opponent by the back of the head or neck, pushing it downwards as they drop to the mat. This causes the opponent to jerk their neck backwards, snapping it to the mat.\n\nThe attacking wrestler applies a front facelock while he places their hands side by side under each other shoulder and uses their free hand to grab hold of the opponent's far hand before then swinging over the opponent and down to the ground, in a semi-circular motion, so that both the wrestler and the opponent fall to the ground back-first causing the back of the opponent's neck to impact on the shoulder of the attacking wrestler. One variation sees the attacking wrestler fall to a seated position, slamming the opponent's neck into the mat between their legs. Another version that sees the attacking wrestler swing inward, throwing the opponent over and to the ground, is often referred to as a whiplash. WWE Diva Eve Torres used this as finisher and called it \"Heartbreaker\".\n\nAlso known as a snap swinging neckbreaker, the standard version of this move is in a style similar to that of a swinging neckbreaker, in which the wrestler holds them in a front facelock, keeping their heads side by side under each other shoulder. At this point the attacking wrestler swings inward as they dive to the ground, twisting on the opponent's neck and in the process, driving their neck and shoulders into the ground.\n\nAn elevated version first sees the attacking wrestler raise an opponent off the ground, often using a suplex lift, to place the opponent's leg on the top ring rope so that they are face-down while the wrestler holds them in a front facelock, keeping their heads side by side under each other shoulder, making the wrestler the only other thing than the ring ropes keeping the opponent off the ground. At this point the attacking wrestler swings inward as they dive to the ground, twisting on the opponent's neck and in the process lifting the opponent's entire body off the rope, driving their neck and shoulders into the ground. A double team version of this move also exists.\n\nAnother slight variation of the (standing) whiplash move sees the attacking wrestler hook both the opponent's legs (as in a cradle suplex) while keeping both their heads side by side under each other shoulder before then performing the whiplash.\n\n"}

{"id": "2169603", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2169603", "title": "Philipp Lahm", "text": "Philipp Lahm\n\nPhilipp Lahm (; born 11 November 1983) is a German retired professional footballer who played as a right back or defensive midfielder and spent much of his early career playing left back. He was the captain of Bayern Munich, having led them to numerous honours including the 2013 UEFA Champions League as part of the Treble. He is also a former captain of his national team, which he led to win the 2014 FIFA World Cup, before retiring from international football.\n\nLahm is considered by many to be one of the best defenders of his generation and one of the greatest defenders of all time and was included in the World Cup team of the tournament in 2006, 2010, and 2014, and the UEFA Team of the Tournament in 2008 and 2012 and in the UEFA Team of the Year 2006, 2008, 2012, 2013 and 2014. Although Lahm is right-footed, he is able to play on both sides of the pitch, due to his tactical intelligence and versatility. He often cut from the flank to the inside of the pitch to either shoot and/or pass. In particular, he is renowned for his pace, technique, stamina, and precise tackling abilities, as well as his small stature, which earned him the nickname the \"Magic Dwarf\".\n\nLahm developed into a professional football player within the Bayern Munich Junior Team. He joined the team at the age of 11 after a youth coach, Jan Pienta, had scouted him several times while he was playing for the local youth team in his hometown Gern, Munich. He was already considered very talented; one of his coaches, Hermann Hummels, even stated that \"If Philipp Lahm will not make it in the Bundesliga, nobody will anymore.\" He twice won the Bundesliga youth title, the second time as captain of his team, and then was introduced into the B team at the age of 17. His former amateur coach Hermann Gerland considers Lahm to be the most talented player he has ever coached and made him the captain of the B team during his second season. Up to this point Lahm played as a defensive midfielder, right midfielder or right full-back.\n\nOn 13 November 2002, Lahm made his debut for the Bayern Munich first team as a 92nd-minute substitute in a 3–3 draw with RC Lens in the group stage of the Champions League. However, since Willy Sagnol and Bixente Lizarazu were established as Bayern's first choice full-backs, and the club's midfield was also well-staffed, Lahm made no further appearances during the 2002–03 season and was loaned to VfB Stuttgart for the 2003–04 and 2004–05 seasons to gain first team experience in the Bundesliga.\n\nLahm was originally signed as a back-up for Andreas Hinkel, who played as right back, but coach Felix Magath moved him to the left back position, on which he toppled the German international Heiko Gerber. He made his Bundesliga debut on the first day of the season 2003–04 against Hansa Rostock as he came in as a substitute left back in the 76th minute for midfielder Silvio Meissner. He made his first professional start as a left back on the fourth matchday as a 63rd-minute substitute for Gerber and his first game over the full 90 minutes followed on the sixth matchday against Borussia Dortmund. Thereafter he established himself as a regular left back for Stuttgart. On 29 September 2003, Lahm made his first Champions League appearance as a starter against Manchester United. On 3 April 2004, he scored his first ever Bundesliga goal in a 5–1 away win for Stuttgart against VfL Wolfsburg. During the 2003–04 season Lahm appeared for Stuttgart in 31 Bundesliga and seven Champions League matches overall and came second in the election for the German footballer of the year.\n\nDuring his second season in Stuttgart, Lahm had substantially more difficult time. After the Euro 2004 tournament and the resulting shorter vacation and pre-season training he had difficulties getting off the ground and also in conforming with the tactics and system of the new coach Matthias Sammer. However, he still made 16 Bundesliga appearances for Stuttgart before the Christmas break, 14 of them over the full 90 minutes, and six appearances in the UEFA Cup. In January 2005, Lahm suffered a stress-fracture on his right foot and was thus sidelined for four months, making his comeback on 9 April 2005, against FC Schalke 04. Only around five weeks later, he was injured again, this time suffering a torn cruciate ligament which ended his season and simultaneously his career in Stuttgart.\n\nIn July 2005, Lahm returned to Bayern Munich. However, the torn cruciate ligament he had suffered just before his return forced him to start his professional time in FC Bayern on rehabilitation. He returned to the field at the end of November playing first twice for the B team and thereafter making his first professional Bundesliga appearance for Bayern in November 2005 against Arminia Bielefeld. During the 2005–06 season he appeared for Bayern 20 times in the Bundesliga and thrice in the Champions League, contending over field-time evenly with Bixente Lizarazu.\n\nDuring the season 2006–07, Lahm played in all of Bayern's 34 Bundesliga games and in nine of the ten Champions League games and was only substituted twice, mainly because Lahm was the only left back in the team but also due to his sufficiently solid performances during a season that was one of the worst for Bayern in many years. On 20 August 2006, in Bayern's first away match of the season, a 2–1 win over VfL Bochum, he scored his first goal for the club.\n\nFor the 2007–08 season, Bayern bought the German international left back Marcell Jansen and Lahm was supposed to revert to right, both to accommodate Jansen and to replace French right back Willy Sagnol. Due to injuries (both his and Jansen's) he still mainly ended up playing left for Bayern and remained left for the end of the season, although he uttered his wish to play on right several times during the year 2008. During the whole season there were various rumors suggesting that Lahm would leave Bayern in the summer of 2008 to join FC Barcelona and the transfer seemed to be almost a done deal. However, on 16 May 2008 FC Bayern signed a new contract with Lahm. His new contract kept him in Munich through 20 June 2012.\n\nLahm had his most prolific goalscoring season in 2008–09, scoring three times in the Bundesliga and once in the DFB-Pokal. However, the season was a poor one for Bayern, leading to the sacking of head coach Jürgen Klinsmann after less than a year in charge.\n\nOn 8 November 2009, Lahm was given the highest fine in the history of Bayern Munich to date (estimated to be over €25,000) after giving an unauthorised interview in the \"Süddeutsche Zeitung\". He criticised the transfer policy of the club and the lack of game philosophy and strategic planning. Back in May 2008 Lahm had turned down lucrative offers from Manchester United and F.C. Barcelona to stay with Bayern as club president Uli Hoeneß promised to build a team that could challenge in Europe. This incident drew mixed reactions from fans and the media, both local and foreign, with some saying that Lahm should have kept his opinions to himself and others praising him for his honesty. Although he was fined and heavily criticised by the club hierarchy, he kept his place in the Bayern starting line-up and went on to have a good season.\n\nDuring the 2009–10 season under the new coach Louis van Gaal, Lahm was able to play in his preferred position as a right back. After some difficulties in early games he played one of his best seasons ever, forming an excellent partnership on the right wing with Arjen Robben, scoring one goal and giving 12 assists in all of his games. Lahm was also chosen as vice-captain by Van Gaal, and played full-time in all of Bayern's competitive matches apart from the first-round game in the DFB-Pokal. Bayern went on to win the league and cup double and reached the 2010 UEFA Champions League Final, where Lahm played 90 minutes at right-back as they lost to Inter Milan 2–0.\n\nAfter the departure of captain Mark van Bommel in January 2011, Lahm was made the new captain for the remainder of the 2010–11 season and eventually named club captain.\n\nOn 19 May 2012, Lahm captained Bayern in the 2012 UEFA Champions League Final against Chelsea at the Allianz Arena. He scored the team's first penalty in the shootout but Bayern finished as runner-up for the second time in three seasons.\n\nIn the 2012–13 season, Lahm captained Bayern to an historic treble of the Bundesliga, DFB-Pokal and Champions League. In the final of the Champions League on 25 May 2013, Lahm helped his side to a 2–1 victory over fellow Bundesliga side Borussia Dortmund at historic Wembley Stadium in London. After the game, he revealed how happy he was at winning the title, saying \"It's incredible – a huge joy and huge relief. The pressure was enormous after losing in the Champions League final twice.\"\n\nFrom the start of the 2013–14 season, under new manager Pep Guardiola, Lahm has been utilised as a defensive midfielder. Guardiola said of Lahm: \"[He] is perhaps the most intelligent player I have ever trained in my career. He is at another level.\" That season brought a new milestone for Lahm and the club, as he captained Bayern to a record 24th Bundesliga title and the earliest league championship in Bundesliga history, retaining the title with seven games to spare, which beat the mark set by the club in the previous season.\n\nIn June 2014, Lahm signed a new contract keeping him at Bayern until 2018. On 18 October, he scored the first brace of his career in a 6–0 defeat of SV Werder Bremen in the Bundesliga. On 26 April 2015, Bayern were confirmed as Bundesliga champions for the third consecutive season, giving Lahm the seventh league championship of his career.\n\nOn 28 April 2015, Lahm was one of four Bayern players to miss in a 2–0 penalty shootout defeat to Borussia Dortmund in the DFB-Pokal semi-final.\n\nLeading up to the 2015–16 season, Bayern head coach Pep Guardiola stated that Lahm could return to his role at fullback with the arrivals Arturo Vidal and Joshua Kimmich.\nOn 24 February 2016, Lahm made his 100th UEFA Champions League appearance in a 2–2 draw with Juventus in Turin. He equaled Kahn's record \"in Germany\" of 103 matches on 13 April 2016. The 2015–16 season ended with Lahm captaining Bayern to a fourth consecutive Bundesliga title; the first time a team had won four back-to-back championships in the competition's history.\n\nOn 4 February 2017, Lahm made his 500th appearance for FC Bayern in a 1–1 Bundesliga draw with Schalke 04. Three days later, Lahm confirmed that he would be retiring at the end of the 2016–17 season. He had rejected an offer from the club to become a sporting director.\n\nOn 20 May 2017, Lahm, along with teammate Xabi Alonso, made their final career appearance before retiring, Lahm captaining Bayern as they ended the season as champions for the fifth consecutive year. He was substituted in the 87th minute and received a standing ovation from the Allianz Arena crowd in a 4–1 win over SC Freiburg. It was confirmed on 19 July that Manuel Neuer will succeed Lahm as club captain.\n\nLahm entered Bayern Munich's Hall of Fame in 27 May 2017; he won eight Bundesliga titles and the Champions League while playing for the club. \n\nLahm started his international career in the U19 national team. He was part of the team that won silver for Germany in the 2002 U19 European championship playing in all games in the final tournament and scoring a crucial goal in the 90th minute (2–3) against England in a game that ended 3–3. Afterwards he played a few U20 and U21 matches for Germany before impressing Rudi Völler enough to hand the youngster his debut on 18 February 2004, at 20 years of age. His first game was a 2–1 win over Croatia, where he played the full 90 minutes and was chosen as the man of the match by German football magazine Kicker. He was also part of Germany's team in UEFA Euro 2004 in Portugal and played full 90 minutes in all three games. Although Germany did not make it past the group stage, Lahm's performance was considered very promising and many German papers saw this as the sole positive aspect in Germany's lack of accomplishment in the tournament.\n\nLahm missed more than a year of international football between January 2005 and March 2006 due to injuries (stress-fracture on foot and a torn cruciate ligament), including the 2005 Confederations Cup, but after his recovery he immediately made it back to the starting line-up. Even though he injured his elbow in a friendly game right before the 2006 FIFA World Cup and thus had to wear a special cast on his left arm, Jürgen Klinsmann still chose him as first option for the left back position. He scored the first goal in the opening game of the World Cup in Germany against Costa Rica in the sixth minute, cutting inside the area and launching a right foot shot into the top-right corner of the net. He was awarded Man of the Match for his performance in the second group game against Poland. He was also the only German player to play the complete 690 minutes of the World Cup and was also elected to the All Star Team of the tournament.\n\nDuring UEFA Euro 2008 he was in Germany's starting line-up in all games and was only substituted in the final after getting a cut needing stitches on his foot. Lahm started the tournament as a right back but replaced the under-performing Jansen as left back midway through the second game. On 25 June 2008, he scored the winning goal of the Euro 2008 semi-final against Turkey in the 90th minute. He described this as the most important goal of his career and although he was elected \"Man of the Match\", he himself did not consider this as well-deserved. On 29 June 2008 – in the Euro 2008 final against Spain – on 33 minutes Xavi played a piercing ball through the German defence and a lack of communication between Lahm and German goalkeeper Jens Lehmann allowed Fernando Torres to net the decisive goal in the game; Spain prevailed 1–0 to win its second European Championship title in 44 years.\n\nLahm was ever present during Germany's 2010 World Cup qualifying campaign and was the only player to play every single minute.\n\nFollowing the withdrawal of regular captain Michael Ballack from the 2010 FIFA World Cup squad due to injury, Lahm was chosen to captain the team at the upcoming tournament. On 13 June 2010, he captained the national team in the opening game of the 2010 FIFA World Cup against Australia, becoming the youngest player to captain a German side in a World Cup tournament. The team advanced all the way to the semi-finals, where they were defeated by Spain 1–0. Lahm did not play in the third-place (bronze) match against Uruguay due to an infection, so in his absence Bastian Schweinsteiger captained the team which won 3–2.\n\nLahm's captaincy would later become permanent, when coach Joachim Löw announced that Ballack would not be considered to play for Germany anymore.\n\nCaptain Lahm's solid defending helped Germany win all ten qualification matches for UEFA Euro 2012, and he also provided one assist each for Mesut Özil and Mario Gómez. He was an ever-present in the German defence that attracted praise from a variety of sources. Germany won all three group games against Portugal, Netherlands, and Denmark. Lahm scored the opening goal in their 4–2 victory over Greece in the quarter-finals. Germany was eliminated 2–1 by Italy in the semi-finals.\n\nOn 6 September 2013, Lahm was awarded his 100th cap for the German national team in a 3–0 win over Austria during qualification for the 2014 World Cup.\n\nOn 16 June 2014, Lahm started for Germany in central midfield in their first match of the 2014 FIFA World Cup, a 4–0 defeat of Portugal in Salvador, and remained in the position for the other two group games and the round of 16 match against Algeria.\n\nLahm reverted to right back for the quarter-final against France, and remained there in Germany's 7–1 defeat of Brazil in the semi-final. On 11 July 2014, Lahm was named on the 10-man shortlist for FIFA's Golden Ball award for the tournament's best player.\n\nOn 13 July 2014, Lahm led Germany to a World Cup victory, a 1–0 win against Argentina in the final, the fourth time Germany have won the competition and the first for a reunified Germany. Fritz Walter, Franz Beckenbauer, and Lothar Matthäus had skippered West Germany to the World Cup title.\n\nOn 18 July 2014, Lahm, at the age of 30, announced his retirement from international football. He had scored five goals in 113 appearances. On 2 September 2014, Bastian Schweinsteiger succeeded Lahm as captain of the German national team.\n\nOn 8 December 2017, Lahm was named honorary ambassador for Germany's bid to host the UEFA Euro 2024.\n\nLahm is known as a private person who maintains a low-profile outside of football; his best friend Andreas Ottl was the only footballer present at his wedding to Claudia Schattenberg. The couple have a son, Julian, and a daughter, Lenia. A Munich native, Lahm was a lifelong Bayern fan and served as a ball boy at the Olympic Stadium.\n\nLahm is involved in many charity campaigns and events. In June 2007, FIFA announced that Lahm and Owen Hargreaves would visit South Africa in advance to support the 2010 FIFA World Cup. Although Hargreaves never managed to take part in the trip due to injury, Lahm and German national teammate Piotr Trochowski visited the country taking time not only to visit the 2010 FIFA World Cup organizers but also to visit a local SOS Children's Village and to take part in the Kick-AIDS event.\n\nLahm has established a foundation, Philipp Lahm-Stiftung, to support underprivileged children and is also an official ambassador representing \"FIFA for SOS Children's Villages\". In addition he was an ambassador of the 2007, 2008 and 2009 World AIDS Day. He has also taken part in a campaign against speeding and various others such as \"Bündnis für Kinder\", a campaign against child abuse.\n\nLahm was awarded a Tolerantia-Preis on 20 September 2008, due to his outstanding contribution against intolerance and homophobia in sports, particularly in football. He also stated that it's a \"pity that being gay in football is still a taboo subject\" and he would have no problem with a homosexual teammate and is \"not afraid of homosexuals\". However, Lahm does not advise footballers to publicly admit to being homosexual, because of the abuse they would suffer.\n\nIn August 2011 at age 27 he released his autobiography, \"Der feine Unterschied: Wie man heute Spitzenfußballer wird\" (The Subtle Difference – How to Become a Top Footballer), reviewing his football career and personal experiences, the general football environment, football in the social context and the effectiveness of different coaching and training methods. The No.1 bestselling book received extensive media attention in Germany, and has been criticized for parts of the book in which he discerningly analyzed his former coaches' work, among the critics were Rudi Völler (himself criticized by Lahm in the book) and Ottmar Hitzfeld.\n\n\n\"Scores and results table.

According to its website, the \"mission of The Council on Biblical Manhood and Womanhood is to set forth the teachings of the Bible about the complementary differences between men and women, created equally in the image of God, because these teachings are essential for obedience to Scripture and for the health of the family and the church.\" CBMW's current president is Dr. Denny Burk, a professor of biblical studies at Boyce College and director for The Center for Gospel and Culture at The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary.\n\nIts 2017 \"Nashville Statement\" was criticized by egalitarian Christians and LGBT campaigners, as well as by several conservative religious figures.\n\nThe Council on Biblical Manhood and Womanhood was organized in 1987. At a 1986 meeting of the Evangelical Theological Society (ETS), Wayne Grudem gave a speech on \"Manhood and Womanhood in Biblical and Theological Perspectives\" in which he invited delegates to join \"a new organization dedicated to upholding both equality and differences between men and women in marriage and the church.\" This was followed by a meeting in Dallas with Grudem, John Piper, Wayne House, and others. A subsequent meeting was held in Danvers, Massachusetts; at this meeting, the Danvers Statement on Biblical Manhood and Womanhood was finalized. A full-page advertisement containing the full Danvers Statement was published in \"Christianity Today\" in January 1989.\n\nIn 1991, Crossway Books published the organization's lengthy book, \"Recovering Biblical Manhood and Womanhood: A Response to Evangelical Feminism\". Edited by Piper and Grudem, this book included contributions by D. A. Carson, John Frame, Vern Poythress, Douglas J. Moo, Paige Patterson, Elisabeth Elliot, and several other writers. Bill Bright of Campus Crusade for Christ also supported the organization.\n\nIn the late 1990s, CBMW published articles and papers critical of Gender-Neutral Bible translations. CBMW has drawn Christian media attention by expressing concerns about such translations. The organization's thoughts on Bible translations have had influence upon Southern Baptists, Focus on the Family, and other evangelical organizations.\n\nThe CBMW opposes same-sex marriage.\n\nThe CBMW adopted the Danvers Statement in 1988. It summarizes the CBMW's views on sex and gender roles. \n\nThe Danvers Statement has been endorsed or adopted by the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, Southwestern Baptist Seminary , Midwestern Baptist Theological Seminary, Cedarville University, and several independent churches. Randall Balmer says that the Statement was an attempt to \"staunch the spread of biblical feminism in evangelical circles.\" Seth Dowland suggests that the authors of the statement \"framed their position as a clear and accessible reading of Scripture. The Danvers Statement is included in readers such as \"Evangelicalism and Fundamentalism: A Documentary Reader\" (NYU Press, 2008) and \"Eve and Adam: Jewish, Christian, and Muslim readings on Genesis and gender\" (Indiana University Press, 2009).\n\nThe Danvers Statement recognized the \"genuine evangelical standing of many who do not agree with all of our convictions.\"\n\nIn 1994, at the request of Christians for Biblical Equality (a leading Christian egalitarian organization), three leaders of CBMW (then-President Dr. Ray Ortlund, Mary Kassian, and Wayne Grudem) met with three of the CBE's leaders in Chicago to discuss potential points of agreement. According to Grudem, both sides overcame some misunderstandings about each other. One result of the meeting was an agreement to work on a joint statement on abuse in marriage, which was drafted by the CBMW with feedback from the CBE. However, before it was to be issued, the CBE's board declined to join the statement. The statement was later published in the CBMW's own newsletter (later renamed the Journal for Biblical Manhood and Womanhood). It has subsequently been published on their website and in many of their publications.\n\nJames Beck, declining the joint statement on behalf of the CBE Board of Directors, stated: \"We do not feel it would be helpful to convene a joint press conference at ETS to issue a joint statement on abuse. CBE’s position on abuse flows directly out of our theological understanding of Scripture and what it teaches about gender and roles. If we attempt to issue a joint statement with an organization that differs fundamentally from us on this issue, we feel both organizations would be giving very mixed signals to their respective constituencies.\" Wayne Grudem commented: “We regret that CBE declined to join us in this statement. If CBE will not join us in something on which we agree (condemning abuse), then I see little hope that they will be willing to join us in constructive dialogue on issues where we disagree. This is unfortunate for the evangelical world.”\n\nOn 29 August 2017, CBMW released a manifesto on human sexuality known as the \"Nashville Statement\". The Statement expresses support for an opposite-sex definition of marriage, for faithfulness within marriage, for chastity outside marriage, and for a link between biological sex and \"self-conception as male and female.\" The Statement sets forth the signatories' opposition to LGBT sexuality, same-sex marriage, polygamy, polyamory, adultery, and fornication. The statement was signed by 150 evangelical leaders, and includes 14 points of belief. The Statement:\n\nSince its release, the Nashville Statement has been endorsed or adopted by the Presbyterian Church in America (PCA), The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, Midwestern Baptist Theological Seminary, Union University, and Cedarville University. \n\nDue to perceived homophobia, transphobia, and misogyny, the Nashville Statement has attracted controversy.\n\n\nWayne Grudem co-founded a CBMW newsletter, which became the \"Journal for Biblical Manhood & Womanhood\", published biannually. In the Spring of 2019, CBMW renamed its biannual journal \"Eikon: A Journal for Biblical Anthropology.\" \n\nThe journal usually consists of around fifteen articles composed by various evangelical scholars who hold to complementarian views.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2169629", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2169629", "title": "Slängpolska", "text": "Slängpolska\n\nThe Slängpolska (Swedish plural \"slängpolskor\"; \"släng\" Swed. for \"toss, throw, chuck\" and directly cognate to the English \"to sling\") is a Swedish folk dance and sometimes also the description of certain folk music tunes. The dances bearing the name slängpolska can be divided into two major types.\n\nThe first type is for two or four people, and is one of the sixteenth-note versions of the polska. The dances of this type usually have in common that they are danced on the spot, either during parts of the dance or during the entire dance. Focus is on different holds and on the divisions between them, and these divisions could be responsible for the name slängpolska. A typical slängpolska of this type could consist of two basic set positions: one in which the couple is spinning around one another while holding crossed hands outstretched with centrifugal force, the other in which the couple is spinning around one another in a closer position while holding the partner's shoulders and arms. The division between the two parts of the dance is then made by e.g. both dancers spinning out from their hold and then spinning once on their own with a clap of hands, followed by a returning to the hold. A common dance step consists of four steps distributed in the following way over three beats: one long, two short, one long (\"one...-two-and-three...\"). Beat 1, 2 and 3 have almost equal stress and length, which also is reflected in the corresponding music. A very free variant of this slängpolska type, consisting of walking through the room with different holds and turning on the spot with different holds and the same walking steps, could just as well be danced to or time music, as do the related Norwegian dances \"gangar\" and \"bonde\", but in Sweden it is most commonly danced to time music.\n\nThe second type of slängpolska is more related to other polskas than to the above slängpolska type, in that the couples move counterclockwise around the periphery of the room, and choose to do so with or without rotation clockwise around an internal axis, one full rotation for each measure. The music and dances in this category share a high tempo, giving a \"tossing\" feeling, which is often reflected in the rotation part of the dance in the form of a jump or a lift as part of the step recurring in every measure until the couple decides to dance without rotation for a while. The name has been used from midwest Sweden (Värmland) to the north of Sweden, and there is a large diversity in music and dance character, since the name mainly refers to the tempo. Both in midwest and north Sweden there are examples of dances which can both be danced as a slower \"polska\" and as a faster \"slängpolska\" with retention of the basic steps.\n"}

{"id": "2169656", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2169656", "title": "Tsunesaburō Makiguchi", "text": "Tsunesaburō Makiguchi\n\nTsunesaburō Makiguchi (牧口 常三郎, \"Makiguchi Tsunesaburō\" 23 July 1871 [Lunar calendar date on 6 June] – 18 November 1944) was a Japanese educator who founded and became the first president of the Sōka Kyōiku Gakkai (Value-Creating Education Society), the predecessor of today's Soka Gakkai.\n\nMakiguchi was born in the small village of Kashiwazaki, Niigata Prefecture, Japan, in 23 July 1871 (Lunar calendar date on 6 June). Adopted by the Makiguchi family, he moved to Hokkaido, Japan's northernmost island, at the age of 14. Working his way through school, he graduated from Sapporo Normal School (today's Hokkaido University of Education). First employed as an assistant teacher at a primary school affiliated with his alma mater, he later taught high school and served as a dormitory superintendent.\n\nMakiguchi's novel approach to geography appears in his book \"Jinsei Chirigaku\" (A Geography of Human Life) published in 1903 when he was 32. In this work, Makiguchi rejects the prevailing approach to the study of geography, based on the rote memorization of facts and place names, instead advocating a rational understanding of geography based on the relationship of the individual, human activity and industrial advancement to nature.\n\nAlthough recognized as an able teacher, Makiguchi's uncompromising attitude toward authorities created problems. His clashes with officials of the Ministry of Education, school inspectors, ward assemblymen, city councilmen, and top officials of the city of Tokyo were frequent and resulted in frequent transfers between schools. After moving to Tokyo, he served as principal in a succession of six primary schools, from 1913 to 1932.\n\nDuring those years, he devoted much consideration to the relationship between life and education, developing his theories on \"sōka\" or the creation of value, the happiness of the individual, the prosperity of society at large, and their interrelationships in practice. In June 1928, Makiguchi embraced the philosophy and practice of Nichiren Buddhism, having been introduced by Tokyo business high school principal Sokei Mitani. His close friend and disciple Josei Toda followed his Buddhist conversion in 1930.\nHis aforementioned work \"Jinsei Chirigaku\" (\"A Geography of Human Life\"), predates the academic study of geography at the Imperial Universities of Kyoto and Tokyo in 1907 and 1911, respectively, and pioneered a new approach to teaching geography in Japan. Written between the First Sino-Japanese War and the Russo-Japanese War, the work presents human geography as a subject for both formal and nonformal learning to advance an understanding of cultural differences shaping and shaped by the relationship between human activity and its natural environment. While \"Japanese geographers of the time were chiefly concerned with describing the physical features of the earth,\" Makiguchi was arguably the first to discuss human geography as a system of knowledge correlating location theory and spatial distribution of human phenomena with economic, social and political geographies. In Makiguchi's words, \"it is through our spiritual interaction with the earth that the characteristics that we think of as human are ignited and nurtured within us.\" In this work, Makiguchi also formulated the concept of humanitarian competition as an approach to international relations, writing that: \"The important thing is the setting of a goal of well being and protection of all people, including oneself but not at the increase of self-interest alone. In other words, the aim is the betterment of others and in doing so, one chooses ways that will yield personal benefit as well as benefits to others. It is a conscious effort to create a more harmonious community life.\"\n\nIn response to problems throughout the education system that resulted from the Meiji government's adoption of the Imperial Rescript, Makiguchi published the first volume of \"Sōka Kyōikugaku Taikei\" (\"The System of Value-Creation Pedagogy\") together with his close friend and disciple Jōsei Toda on November 18, 1930. The date was later adopted as the Founding Day of Sōka Gakkai. The four-volume work, published over a period of five years, sets forth his thoughts on education and proposals for systemic reform. Rather than education serving the state, as embodied in the Imperial Rescript on Education, Makiguchi proposed a student-centered education with the purpose of ensuring the happiness of the learner.\n\nHe also proposed the creation of an educational system comprising a partnership of school, home and community. In this system, a child would spend half a day in school and the other half in apprenticeships and other types of work activities at home and in the community befitting the nature and needs of the child. Makiguchi felt that implementing such a system would change bored, apathetic learners into eager, self-directed students.\n\n\"Makiguchi developed a theory of value that combined the idea of happiness as the goal of life with that of value as something that can be created. ... In value-creating pedagogy the main point of education is to aim for a happy life and develop the ability and attitude required to create value.\"\n\nSoka philosophy and soka educational theory essentially arose out of Makiguchi's imperative to reform the Japanese education system which increasingly served to support the country's imperialist war efforts against its Asian neighbors. His conceptualizations of value, value creation and happiness thus frame his educational theory.\n\nHe distinguished value as that which emerges or is created from the relationship or interaction between self and object; truth, not a value but an object whose existence cannot be created but revealed or discovered; the value of beauty, a measure of sensory impact on aesthetic awareness; the value of gain, a measure of holistic advancement in life; and the value of good, a measure of contribution to social or public well-being. For Makiguchi, value is determined by \"whether something adds to or detracts from, advances or hinders, the human condition.\"\n\nMakiguchi's theory of value emphasizes a \"participatory inter-connectedness of individuals through community engagement\" that meaningfully enhances the well-being of both the individual and society through the transformational process of pursuing value creation. \"Human life is a process of creating value,\" Makiguchi wrote, \"and education should guide us towards that end. Thus, educational practices should serve to promote value creation.\"\nThe publisher of Makiguchi's \"Sōka Kyōikugaku Taikei\", volume one, in November 18, 1930 was Sōka Kyōiku Gakkai (創 価 教 育 学 会; English: Value-Creation Education Society), a society of reform-minded educators and teachers that over the course of the 1930s grew more inclusive of broader social reform and became today's Soka Gakkai organization. \n\nHis gradual shift in focus from educational to religious means of social reform may be traced to several factors, including the personal tragedies of the deaths of four of his children and the increasing military dominance in every facet of society, in tandem with his embrace of Nichiren's philosophy.\n\nIn Nichiren's teachings Makiguchi had found support for his theory of value-creation and a world view consistent with his aims of educational reform and social betterment centered on addressing the subjective realities of the individual.\n\nDuring World War II, he opposed Japan's military government's attempts to impose the doctrine of State Shinto through strict control of religions and thoughts inimical to its war effort. While there was some debate as to whether Makiguchi's actions were in direct opposition to the war, it is clear that \"his outspoken criticism of the prevailing belief system represents an implicit and explicit protest against an extreme abuse of the educational process for militarist purposes.\"\n\nIn 1943, due to his refusal to accept the talisman and support the war, he was arrested and imprisoned as a \"thought criminal\" together with Jōsei Toda and 20 senior leaders of Sōka Kyōiku Gakkai for violating the Peace Preservation Law revised in 1941 and under which tens of thousands were arrested. Already in his seventies, Makiguchi was subjected to harsh interrogation as the authorities sought to force him to recant his beliefs. Most of the other imprisoned members of Soka Kyoiku Gakkai caved to the extreme interrogation tactics, however Makiguchi never yielded, continuing to assert the value of freedom of religion as a fundamental human right. On 18 November 1944, Makiguchi died in prison of malnutrition.\n\nA secular network of Soka schools around the world, including several independent secondary schools, and two universities (Sōka University of Japan and Soka University of America) were established by Daisaku Ikeda based on Makiguchi's pedagogy.\"The fairly recent growth in the internationalization of Soka education,\" writes Paul Sherman, specialist in global citizenship education in higher education, \"is a reflection of Makiguchi's ideas on the important function of education in human development, in that he believed a key purpose of education was to cultivate global-minded individuals who could be empathetically engaged with the world, while at the same time maintain their roots at the local community level.\"\n\nMakiguchi's value-creating system of education has attracted the attention of educators around the world. His \"Sōka Kyōikugaku Taikei\" has been translated into English, Portuguese, French and Vietnamese. In Brazil, Makiguchi's theory of education based on value-creation has been sponsored in 55 schools and introduced in 1,103 classrooms to more than 340,000 students.\n\nMakiguchi is remembered to this day by members of the Soka Gakkai in Japan and the Soka Gakkai International (SGI) around the world. During morning and evening prayers, members take a moment to express gratitude to the first three presidents of Soka Gakkai: Tsunesaburō Makiguchi (president from 1930-1944), Jōsei Toda (president from 1951–1958), and Daisaku Ikeda (president from 1960–1979, honorary president from 1979 to the present and president of SGI from 1975 to the present)\n\nThe 1973 film \"Ningen kakumei\" (The Human Revolution), directed by Toshio Masuda, dramatizes the educational career of Makiguchi, his relationship with Josei Toda, and his WWII imprisonment for his beliefs during which he died.\n\nIkeda, Daisaku. \"John Dewey and Tsunesaburo Makiguchi: Confluences of Thought and Action.\" 2001.

He was typical of those in his social group who enjoyed lives of privilege and entitlement, adhering to the inevitability and desirability of class distinction.\n\nMorand espoused a reflexive adherence to racial, ethnic and anti-Semitic ideologies. His intellectual influences included the writing of Friedrich Nietzsche, Oswald Spengler, and the author of a treatise on the superiority of the white race, Joseph Arthur de Gobineau.

He served as Vichy ambassador in Romania and Switzerland during World War II.\n\nHe was a patron and inspirational figure for the Hussards literary movement, which opposed existentialism.\n\nMorand made four bids for admission to the prestigious Académie française and was finally accepted in 1968, over the protest of Charles de Gaulle.\n\nSource material indicates that Morand was born in Russia to French parents who subsequently moved to Paris.

The Morand home was a gathering place for the social elite and those notable in the arts and literature. Jules Massenet, composer of popular operas of the era, sculptor Auguste Rodin and writer Oscar Wilde were guests. As a youth Morand was introduced to such luminaries as the actress Sarah Bernhardt, and poet Stéphane Mallarmé. The multi-faceted writer and diplomat Jean Giraudoux was his tutor and became a lifelong friend. His father allied himself with those who believed in the innocence of Alfred Dreyfus, yet maintained a policy of banning Jews from the Morand home.\n\nMorand, a man of \"fin de siècle\" sensibilities, believed in the credo of \"art for art's sake.\" He was ingrained with a deep pessimism, influenced by his father's cautionary advice to \"be always distrustful\". He was an intellectual proponent of Friedrich Nietzsche, and Oswald Spengler espousing the philosophers’ belief in the decadence and decline of civilization. For Morand, class distinctions spoke to the natural order of a civilized society and he subscribed to theories based on the superiority/inferiority of race. He was influenced by the writing of Joseph Arthur de Gobineau, an aristocrat, who presented his case for the superiority of the white race in an essay written in 1853, \"Essay on the Inequality of the Human Races\".\n\nMorand was sent to study at Oxford University. In 1913, he was appointed cultural attaché to the French Embassy in London. His sojourn in England brought him into acquaintance with the prominent members of British society and aristocracy.\n\nMorand often dined at the Hôtel Ritz in the company of Marcel Proust and his confidante, the Princess Hélène Soutzo. The Princess, born Hélène Chrissoveloni, was the daughter of a prominent Greek merchant banker. At the time she made Morand's acquaintance, she was married to an aristocrat of Greek-Romanian extraction, Prince Dimitri Soutzo. Morand and Princess Soutzo had an extended romantic liaison; she divorced her husband in 1924 and married Morand in 1927.\n\nMorand served briefly in the military prior to the outbreak of World War I, but managed to avoid active service in the hostilities and was assigned to the reserve corps. An avid, active sportsman, he had failed his medical exam as unfit for service. Many attributed this exemption to the intervention and influence held by his mistress, Princess Elena Suțu (née Chrissoveloni, 5 Feb 1879 in Galați - 26 Feb 1975 in Paris), the wife of the Romanian general and military attaché Prince Dimitri Suțu (Greek: Soutzos, Romanian: Suțu or Sutzu). His wealth allowed Morand to travel and indulge his interests in fast cars, fine horses and women.\n\nDuring the war years, Morand's life of privilege continued unabated. He frequented the theatres, attended and gave lavish entertainments, and dined in the best restaurants. He spent 1914 to 1918 living alternately in England, Rome, Madrid and Paris. Morand cultivated the Dada and avant-garde art movements. It was in 1917 that he met Jean Cocteau at the premiere of Cocteau's ballet \"\"Parade\"\", whose musical score had been composed by Erik Satie and its production design executed by Pablo Picasso.\n\nHe wrote of his political sympathies during World War I in a journal he kept in 1916 and 1917, which appeared in a volume that was not published until 1948. Morand, like his compatriot, French politician Joseph Caillaux, was committed to effectuating a conciliatory relationship with the Germans and, in essence, the negotiation of a separate peace.\n\nHis post-war life continued much as it had. A tradition of \"Saturday dinners\" had been established with Cocteau and his circle, congregating at the newly in vogue jazz milieu of the Paris cabaret, \"\"Le Boeuf sur le Toit\"\". Morand and the couturiere Coco Chanel traveled in the same social circles and he became her friend and confidante.\n\nIn 1925, Morand was posted in the French legation in Bangkok, Thailand. He used this posting as a jumping off point for extensive travel. He documented his perceptions, filtered through a mindset of the privileged European who lived to the fullest a life of entitlement. He disparaged the cultures of countries through which his travels took him. He had strong theories on race, decrying that the world was becoming a \"foul age of the half-caste\". He derided democracy, bemoaning that Europe had become impotent, in his eyes, \"egotistical, democratic, divided.\"\n\nMorand had a brief stint in the French cinema. During this period, he met 18-year-old actress Josette Day (later \"Belle\" in Cocteau's film \"La Belle et la Bête\"), who became his mistress. Morand had been hired to collaborate with Alexandre Arnoux on a scenario for a proposed project, \"Don Quichotte\", to star the opera singer Feodor Chaliapin. The French version of the film \"Don Quichotte\" was reviewed by \"The New York Times\" upon its opening in New York. Herbert L. Matthews, writing for the newspaper, criticized the Morand/Arnoux script but called it \"an admirable film\", attributable to the talents of director G. W. Pabst and its lead player Chaliapin.\n\nMany were then fleeing Nazi Germany, with a proportion of those in the arts, many of them Jewish, taking refuge in France. Morand saw these exiles as unwanted interlopers. He penned a veiled, anti-Semitic, \"xenophobic diatribe\" titled \"\"France la Doulce\"\", replete with quaint, antique vocabulary. He demonized these emigrants (i.e., Jews) as \"pirates\" whether naturalized or not, called them \"scum\".\n\nIn October 1933, he wrote an article for a new weekly periodical edited by Henri Massis, who had a long-standing alliance with the anti-Semitic, political monarchists, \"Action Française\". Morand alerted the French populace to the peril that was forthcoming:\n\nIn August 1939, Morand was sent to London, assigned to a responsible post at the French embassy. In a prime position to ally himself with Charles de Gaulle and the Free French Forces, Morand instead deserted his post. He relocated to Vichy and swore allegiance to the Vichy government. Such a defection was in keeping with Morand's ideology, his long-term admiration for Philippe Pétain, and his association with the daughter of Pierre Laval, the Comtesse de Chambrun. There were dilemmas, however; as president of the film censorship board, Morand had to ban for moral reasons a film for which he had written the script.\n\nHe divided his time between Paris and Vichy, moving freely between the occupied and collaborationist sections of France. In 1941, he rallied against the hedonism of the French, championing the virtues of patriotism, vitality, and the [Nietzschean] \"feeling of life\" demonstrated by the Nazis. Morand and his pro-German wife welcomed into their Paris mansion the artists sanctioned and lauded by the Nazi regime, such as Arno Breker, Hitler's favorite sculptor, and Ernst Jünger, whose novels glorified warfare.\n\nIn 1943, the Vichy government appointed Morand ambassador to Romania. His tenure in Bucharest earned him no diplomatic distinction. He spent his time using his stature to benefit his own interests and plunder the embassy. During air raids over Bucharest in 1944, Morand fled. He was subsequently transferred to Bern, Switzerland, where he and his wife remained after the war.\n\nAfter the war, he was charged with collaboration with the enemy, but suffered no penalty other than having his government pension revoked.\n\nHe spent the following years residing in Switzerland, Tangiers, the Hôtel de Crillon, and his wife's opulent Paris home.\n\nMorand became an inspirational figure for a literary group who espoused their views in the anti-existentialist journal \"The Hussards\", founded by his friend Roger Nimier.\n\nMorand had sought election into the Académie française in 1939 and 1941, and both times his bid was denied. He attempted to achieve the prestigious distinction again in 1958. This third attempt illuminated the record of his wartime activities and generated an organized opposition to his membership. Charles de Gaulle vetoed his admission. Morand ultimately was granted membership in 1968 but was denied the formal ceremonies that traditionally accompanied the investiture of new members, and de Gaulle refused to receive him at the Elysée Palace.\n\nIt is believed that Morand never reassessed his elitist worldview and political ideology, resolutely retaining his mindset until the end of his life. In interviews, he consistently contrived to evade any references to World War II. It is further posited that he and his wife had used their position to make some attempts to aid Jewish friends but that it was done to dramatise the influence and power they held in the Nazi regime, rather than a demonstration of their humanity. He never came to recognize the suffering that millions endured under totalitarianism.\n\nEzra Pound, who was then living in Paris, translated his first volume of short stories, titled \"Tendre Stocks\", into English. Marcel Proust supplied the preface. With the publication of two volumes of poetry, \"Lampes à arc\" (Arc-Lamps) and \"Feuilles de température\", (Temperature Records), he gained attention and praise that garnered renewed interest in his earlier work. His output was prolific in the interwar period of the 1920s and 1930s, and tapered off during World War II.\n\nMorand made four trips to New York City between 1925 and 1929. He attended soirees which featured such American cultural notables as Carl Van Vechten, F. Scott Fitzgerald and his wife Zelda, Louise Bryant and her future husband, diplomat William Bullitt.\n\nIn 1930, Morand published his observations of the Manhattan scene in \"New York\". Morand explains that he wrote strictly from the viewpoint of the foreign visitor for the foreign reader; he \"followed no other method of telling about New York than to show what pleased me.\" \n\nReviewing the book, one critic noted that Morand \"keeps on repeating the contemporary bromide that ‘the Jews own New York, the Irish run it, and the Negroes enjoy it...Italians hardly can be assimilated.’\" Speakeasies, Morand had concluded: \"I can not think of anything sadder.\" New York City's theatre/entertainment district, the Broadway thoroughfare and its central hub Times Square, suggested to Morand an apocalyptic future:\n\nIn spite of his eccentric summations on New York culture, Morand expressed his appreciation for the city — concurrently disclosing his admiration for the fascist leadership of Benito Mussolini:\n\nMorand was considered a writer of cosmopolitan sensibility who created vivid scenarios of life amid the dislocations — and what some saw as the moral disintegration — of post-World War I Europe. The writing was fast-paced, noteworthy for its wit and mastery of descriptive style. The stories reflected an urban ennui and disillusionment felt by those leading lives fueled by intense emotions and hedonistic self-indulgence.Georges Lemaître wrote in 1938: \"Beyond any doubt Morand is the most typical representative and interpreter of French literature today...His defects and merits, are they not the defects and merits of the world today...\" Supporters and enthusiasts of Morand, Cocteau and André Breton appreciated his \"spiteful humour and surreal urban poetry, and aphoristic prose.\" French critics praised his descriptive facility with words, leading them to categorize him as a \"modernist\", and \"imagist\".\n\nIn 1945, Morand traveled to St. Moritz at the request of Coco Chanel who had enlisted him to write her memoirs. The result was \"The Allure of Chanel\", a slim volume promoted as a conversation between the author and his subject.\n\nMorand's post-World War II literary output concentrated on historical novellas. He devised exotic locales and historical events as metaphors for contemporary politics — \"decoding the past as a link to the present.\" The plots, replete with counterrevolutionaries, nobility unjustly victimized, highlighted collaborationist heroes seeking redemption. In these works Morand was making a case for himself; his fictional characters serving as proxies for an apologist justification of his own wartime activity. \"...Many of Morand's historical figures...[can be] likened to a comedian, accidentally thrust into the unfolding drama of history...a comedy of errors...[the characters] merely symbols.\" \"Parfait de Saligny\" appeared in 1946. \"La Flagellant de Séville\", 1946, draws parallels between the Napoleonic wars and the Nazi occupation of Europe. \"La Folle amoureuse\", \"Montociel: le rajah aux grandes Indes\", were published in 1947.\n\nNot all critics were laudatory. While acknowledging his masterful use of language, they cited the lack of substance in his observations and tendency towards generalizations. It was said his characters were not fully realized portraits but presented to the reader as exaggerated personages, crafted for effect.\n\nOver time, critical appraisal of Morand's work has undergone revision. While recognized for his technique, the content of his work has been faulted for its lack of insightful analysis of a people in cultural context, instead relying on generalizations and stereotype. His work speaks to the\n\nMorand's writing disclosed his \"nostalgia for authority and order\" which in his view, was under threat by the insistent forces of democracy.\n\nMorand died in Paris on July 24, 1976, at the age of 88.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2169666", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2169666", "title": "Percy Cradock", "text": "Percy Cradock\n\nSir Percy Cradock (, 26 October 1923 – 22 January 2010) was a British diplomat, civil servant and sinologist who served as British Ambassador to the People's Republic of China from 1978 to 1983, playing a significant role in the Sino-British negotiations which led up to the signing of the Sino-British Joint Declaration in 1984.\n\nJoining the Foreign Office in 1954, Cradock served primarily in Asia and was posted to the British Chargé d'affaires Office in Peking (now Beijing) at the outset of the Cultural Revolution in 1966. He, along with other British subjects, was manhandled by the Red Guards and the mobs when the office was set on fire on 22 August 1967. After the rioting, Cradock served as Chargé d'affaires in Peking from 1968 to 1969, and later succeeded Sir Edward Youde as British Ambassador to the People's Republic of China in 1978. His ambassadorship witnessed the start of the Sino-British negotiations in 1982, which subsequently resulted in the Joint Declaration in 1984, an agreement deciding the future of the sovereignty of Hong Kong after 1997. However, the decision of Cradock, who was the British chief negotiator in the negotiations, to compromise with the Chinese authorities, was regarded as a major retreat by the general media in Hong Kong and the United Kingdom, and was heavily criticised at that time as betraying the people of Hong Kong.\n\nCradock remained a trusted advisor to the then Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, who appointed him as Chairman of the Joint Intelligence Committee in 1985. After the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, he was the first senior British official to pay a visit to the Chinese leadership in the hope of maintaining the much criticised Joint Declaration. He was successful in fighting to guarantee, in the Basic Law of Hong Kong, that half of the seats of the Legislative Council would be directly elected by 2007. However, Cradock worsened his relationship with Thatcher's successor, John Major, by forcing him to visit China in 1991 after the row between the two countries over the Airport Core Programme of Hong Kong. Major had enough of the compromising attitude of Cradock and the-then Governor of Hong Kong, Sir David Wilson, and finally decided to have both of them replaced in 1992, choosing instead his Conservative-ally Chris Patten as Governor.\n\nUnlike his predecessors, Patten was strongly criticised by the Chinese authorities during his governorship because he introduced a series of democratic reforms without consulting them. Although Cradock had retired, he joined the pro-Beijing camp, and became one of the most prominent critics of Governor Patten, censuring him for wrecking the hand-over agreement that had been agreed with the Chinese government. Cradock and Patten blamed each other publicly a number of times in the final years of British administration of Hong Kong. He once famously denounced Patten as an \"incredible shrinking Governor\", while Patten mocked him openly, in another occasion, as a \"dyspeptic retired ambassador\" suffering from \"Craddockitis\".\n\nCradock spent his later years in writing a number of books on realpolitik diplomacy and was a non-executive director of the \"South China Morning Post\".\n\nPercy Cradock was born on 26 October 1923 in Byers Green, County Durham, to a farming family. He was educated at Alderman Wraith Grammar School in Spennymoor in his childhood when he experienced the decline of the local mining industry, influencing him to become a devoted supporter of Labour for a considerably long time. He was enlisted in the Royal Air Force during the Second World War, and after that, entered St John's College, Cambridge, being the first ever Cradock to enter university in his family history.\n\nCradock studied law and English language at Cambridge. His outstanding performance secured him a number of scholarships. From Cambridge he also developed his interest in sinology, by appreciating the works of Chinese and Japanese literature translated by Arthur Waley.\n\nIn 1950, he defeated his pro-Conservative opponent, Norman St John-Stevas, to become Chairman of the Cambridge Union Society. He subsequently authored a well-received book of the history of the Society in 1953, covering the period from 1815 to 1939. After obtaining the Master of Arts degree, he remained as a law tutor in his alma mater and further obtained an LL.M. In 1953, he was admitted to the bar by the Middle Temple. In 1982, he was bestowed an honorary fellowship by St John's College.\n\nIn 1954, Cradock gave up his academic career in Cambridge and joined the Foreign Office as a late entrant. He served in the London headquarters from 1954 to 1957, and was then posted to the British High Commission in Kuala Lumpur, Malaya (now Malaysia), as First Secretary from 1957 to 1961. He was sent to Hong Kong in 1961 to learn Mandarin, and in the next year became Chinese Secretary of the British Chargé d'affaires Office in Peking, the People's Republic of China. From 1963 to 1966, he was posted back to London, but was sent to Peking for the second time in 1966, serving as political counsellor and officer-in-charge.\n\nAlthough the political situation in China by then was growing increasingly unstable, Cradock and his colleagues managed to maintain the safety of the office at the onset of the Cultural Revolution. Nevertheless, the situation soon became much worse in 1967, when leftist rioting in mainland China spread to Hong Kong, causing the colonial government to adopt tough measures to suppress a series of leftist demonstrations and strikes. The suppression was generally supported by the local residents of Hong Kong, but anti-British sentiment in mainland China was greatly aroused. Many in Peking were enraged by what they regarded as the \"imperialist presence\" in China and viewed the British Chargé d'affaires Office as a target to express their anger.\n\nOn 22 August 1967, a large group of Red Guards and their followers marched to the Chargé d'affaires Office and surrounded the office building, summoning a \"Conference to Condemn the Anti-Chinese Crime Committed by British Imperialists\". At night, the Red Guards and the mobs rushed into the office, setting fire to the building and the cars outside. The fire forced the Chargé d'affaires, Sir Donald Hopson, and Cradock to lead the staff and their family members to quickly evacuate the building, and to \"surrender\" to the mobs. It was reported that Cradock was ordered by the Red Guards to kow-tow to a portrait of Mao Zedong, an act that he firmly refused. During the chaotic scene, Cradock and other British subjects were manhandled, and some of them, both male and female, were sexually harassed before being rescued by the People's Liberation Army. After the rescue, Cradock, Hopson and other British subjects were put under house arrest in the embassy zone in central Peking for months, until the political situation cooled down at the end of 1967.\n\nFor his services during and after the chaos, Cradock was appointed a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George in 1968, and succeeded Hopson as Chargé d'affaires from August 1968 before returning to London in February 1969. Back in London, Cradock became head of the Planning Staff of the Foreign Office from 1969 to 1971, and then an Under-Secretary and head of the Assessments Staff of the Cabinet Office, serving under two Prime Ministers, first, Sir Edward Heath, and secondly, Harold Wilson. Cradock took up his first ambassadorial post from 1976 to 1978 as British Ambassador to East Germany. He also led the British delegation to the Comprehensive Test Ban Discussions in Geneva, Switzerland, from 1977 to 1978.\n\nIn 1978, Cradock was posted to Peking for the third time to succeed Sir Edward Youde as British Ambassador to the People's Republic of China, a post created in 1972 to supersede the position of Chargé d'affaires.\n\nBy then, senior officials in the Hong Kong Government, as well as several land developers in Hong Kong, became aware of the question of the 1997 expiry of the 99-year land lease by China to Britain of the New Territories, contained within the 1898 Sino-British \"Convention for the Extension of Hong Kong Territory\", feeling increasingly uncertain about the future validity of land leases. The colony of Hong Kong was basically made up of Hong Kong Island and Kowloon which were ceded to Britain respectively in 1842 and 1860, and the New Territories, which unlike the first two regions was only leased to the United Kingdom for a 99-year term beginning from 1898. Since the 99-year lease would expire roughly twenty-five years after in 1997, they began to notice that land leases in the New Territories approved by the colonial government might not subsist beyond 1997.\n\nTo test the attitude of the Chinese government to the validity of the leases, the Governor, Sir Murray MacLehose, accompanied by the Senior Unofficial Member of the Executive Council, Sir Yuet-keung Kan, and the Political Advisor to the Governor, (later Sir) David Wilson, accepted an invitation from the Chinese government to visit Peking in 1979. The purpose of the visit appeared highly sensitive to the British government. In Hong Kong, only MacLehose, Kan and Wilson knew the purpose of their mission, which was facilitated by Youde in London and Cradock in Peking, and was endorsed by the Foreign Secretary, Dr David Owen. However, unexpectedly, the leader of Communist China, Deng Xiaoping, simply disregarded the question of land leases and firmly insisted on taking over the whole of Hong Kong on or before 1997. The visit ended in dramatically unveiling the prelude of the Sino-British negotiations over the future of Hong Kong.\nFollowing the victory of the Conservatives in the UK General Election in 1979, the new Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, adopted a tough line in diplomacy, and the question of Hong Kong was no exception. Not long after the military victory of the United Kingdom over Argentina in the Falklands War, Mrs. Thatcher, accompanied by Cradock and Youde, who was now Governor of Hong Kong, paid a visit to Peking on 22 September 1982 in the hope of persuading the Chinese government not to insist on claiming the sovereignty of Hong Kong. During her visit, Thatcher and Cradock discussed the matter with the Chinese leadership, including Chinese Premier Zhao Ziyang and Deng Xiao-ping. Although both sides agreed that a formal negotiation over the future of Hong Kong should be held without delay, their views further clashed on 24 September when Thatcher emphasised in a meeting with Deng in the Great Hall of the People that the Sino-British Treaty of Nanking, Convention of Peking and the Convention for the Extension of Hong Kong Territory were still valid, a fact that was firmly denied by Deng, who instead insisted that China must take over Hong Kong by 1997 regardless of the treaties. When Thatcher, Cradock and Youde left the Great Hall after their meeting with Deng, Thatcher accidentally slipped on the steps outside. The sensational scene was described by the local media as a sign hinting at the defeat of the \"Iron Lady\" by the \"shortie\" (i.e. Deng).\n\nFollowing Thatcher's visit to China, the first round of Sino-British negotiations began in Peking from October 1982 to June 1983 with Cradock as the British chief negotiator. However, due to the heavy clash of views, the negotiations saw little success. Cradock feared that prolonged or broken talks would put China in an advantageous position and would provide it with an excuse to unilaterally decide the future of Hong Kong, at a time when 1997 was rapidly approaching. In this regard, Cradock advised Thatcher to compromise with China so as to let Britain retain some degree of influence over the Hong Kong issue, and one of the major concessions he urged was to stop insisting upon the authority conferred by the three treaties to extend British administration beyond 1997. In a letter to the Chinese authorities towards the end of the first round of negotiations, Thatcher wrote that if the result of the negotiations was accepted by the people of Hong Kong, the British government would recommend Parliament to transfer the sovereignty of Hong Kong to China. The letter indicated Thatcher's shift to a softened stance, which paved the way for the second round of negotiations.\n\nIn July 1983, the United Kingdom and China began their second round of negotiations in Peking, with Cradock remaining as the British chief negotiator. Other British negotiators included Governor Youde and Political Advisor to the Governor, Robin McLaren. The Chinese negotiation team was first chaired by Yao Guang, later succeeded by Zhou Nan. Similarly to the first round, both sides found each other difficult. During the negotiations, Britain suggested that the sovereignty of Hong Kong could be transferred to China in 1997, but to ensure the prosperity of Hong Kong, Britain should be given the right to rule beyond 1997. This suggestion was heavily criticised by Zhou as \"replacing the three unequal treaties by a new one\", thus forcing the talks into a stalemate again.\n\nThe sign of failure of the United Kingdom in the Sino-British talks and the uncertainty of the future of Hong Kong greatly weakened the confidence of the people of Hong Kong in their future, which in turn provoked a crisis of confidence. In September 1983, the foreign exchange market recorded a sudden fall in the exchange rate of the Hong Kong Dollar against the US Dollar. The fall in value of the Hong Kong Dollar triggered a brief public panic in Hong Kong with crowds rushing to food stalls, trying to buy every available bag of rice, food and other essential daily commodities. To stabilise the Hong Kong Dollar and to rebuild the confidence of the general public, the Hong Kong Government swiftly introduced the Linked Exchange Rate System in October, fixing the exchange rate at HK$7.8 per US Dollar. Nevertheless, the Chinese government accused the Hong Kong Government of deliberately manipulating the fall of the Hong Kong Dollar, and threatened that if the Sino-British talks could not reach a satisfactory outcome within a year, they would unilaterally take the sovereignty of Hong Kong in their own way by 1997.\n\nCradock was deeply worried that China would leave the negotiating table and act alone. With much effort, he managed to convince the government in November 1983 that the United Kingdom would surrender any claims of sovereignty or power of governance over Hong Kong after 1997. Such a move was generally regarded as the second major concession offered by the United Kingdom. After that, both sides reached consensus over a number of basic principles in the negotiations, including the implementation of \"One Country Two Systems\" after the transfer of sovereignty, the establishment of the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group before the transfer, and the creation of a new class of British nationality for the British nationals in Hong Kong, mostly ethnic Chinese, without offering them the right of abode in the United Kingdom. Although Cradock was succeeded by Sir Richard Evans as the British chief negotiator in January 1984, Cradock had made most of the agreements which later formed the foundation of the Sino-British Joint Declaration. To acknowledge his critical role in the Sino-British negotiations, he was promoted a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George in 1983, having been a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George since 1980.\n\nAfter rounds of negotiations, the Sino-British Joint Declaration was finally initialled by representatives of both Britain and China on 26 September 1984, and on 19 December, the Joint Declaration was formally signed by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and Chinese Premier Zhao Ziyang in the Great Hall of the People. As one of the main draftsmen of the Joint Declaration, Cradock also witnessed the signing in person. However, the Joint Declaration could not bring confidence to the people of Hong Kong. According to an opinion poll conducted shortly afterwards, only 16% of the respondents felt reassured by it, while 76% of the respondents held a reserved attitude. Furthermore, 30% believed that \"One Country Two Systems\" suggested in the Joint Declaration would be unworkable, showing that the general public of Hong Kong felt insecure and doubtful about the agreement made between Britain and China.\n\nWhen Cradock, a diplomat fluent in Mandarin, left the Sino-British talks in the end of 1983, it was rumoured that he would succeed Sir Edward Youde as Governor of Hong Kong. Yet, the rumour never turned into reality, and on the contrary, Cradock, who was dubbed \"Maggie's Mandarin\", and had become a much trusted advisor to Margaret Thatcher, insisted that he should be posted back to London. By then Cradock had reached the diplomatic retirement age of 60, but Thatcher still appointed him as Deputy Under-Secretary of the Foreign Office and Foreign Affairs Advisor to the Prime Minister, responsible for overseeing the Sino-British negotiations. After the signing of the Joint Declaration in December 1984, he was further appointed as Chairman of the Joint Intelligence Committee in 1985, providing military strategic advice to the Prime Minister, while remaining as Foreign Affairs Advisor. Critics have claimed that the reason for Thatcher entrusting him was because both of them regarded the Soviet Union as Britain's biggest adversary, while the United States was the most important ally, and therefore they could always head to the same direction when making diplomatic decisions. Cradock continued to serve as her advisor through the 1987 General Election,\n\nWhen John Major succeeded Thatcher as the Prime Minister in 1990, Cradock continued to work in 10 Downing Street, but his relationship with Major was not as good as with Thatcher. On 7 February 1991, when Major was holding a cabinet meeting at Number 10, the Provisional IRA launched a mortar bomb at the building, breaking all the windows of the conference room. Fortunately, no one in the cabinet meeting, including Cradock, was injured by the terrorist attack.\n\nSince the Joint Declaration was signed in 1984, Hong Kong had entered its last thirteen years of British colonial rule, which was also known as the \"transitional period\". During the period, China and Britain continued to discuss the details of the transfer of sovereignty of Hong Kong scheduled for 1997. Nevertheless, when the Tiananmen Square crackdown occurred on 4 June 1989, Hong Kong fell into a new series of confidence crises. An unprecedented one million people assembled in downtown Central, expressing their anger towards the Communist regime's military suppression of the peaceful student rally in Peking which was in support of freedom and democracy in China. After the crackdown, the talks between Britain and China came to a halt, with an international boycott of China. In Hong Kong and the United Kingdom, public opinion called for the British government to denounce and abandon the Sino-British Joint Declaration, and many felt worried about transferring Hong Kong from Britain to the Communist regime. Among them, the Senior Unofficial Member of the Executive Council of Hong Kong, Dame Lydia Dunn, even publicly urged Britain not to hand over British subjects in Hong Kong to a regime that \"did not hesitate to use its tanks and forces on its own people\".\n\nCradock was instructed to visit Peking secretly in the end of 1989, trying to maintain the Joint Declaration and to cool down the Communist antipathy in Hong Kong. In Peking, he tirelessly lobbied China to guarantee a greater degree of freedom and democracy in post-1997 Hong Kong. It was due to his efforts that China agreed to gradually promote democratisation in the future Hong Kong Special Administrative Region by allowing half of the sixty seats of the Legislative Council to be directly elected by 2007, which was duly achieved in 2004. The promise guaranteed by China was subsequently reaffirmed in the Annex II of the Basic Law of Hong Kong promulgated in 1990. With the consent of Britain, any reform of the colonial Legislative Council before 1997 would have to be endorsed by China, so as to allow the colonial legislature a ticket for the so-called \"through-train\", enabling it to be smoothly transferred to the post-1997 Hong Kong. To accompany this change, Cradock suggested that the post of \"Deputy Governor\" could be created for the future Chief Executive-elect to let the future leader of Hong Kong get ready for the job before 1997. Cradock believed that these measures would be effective in maintaining the prosperity of Hong Kong, and in the long run, he believed all the seats of the Legislative Council would be directly elected.\n\nApart from the above measures, to rebuild confidence of the people of Hong Kong towards their future, Governor Sir David Wilson introduced the Airport Core Programme, which was also known as the \"Rose Garden Project\", in his annual \"Policy Address\" to the Legislative Council in October 1989. However, as the projected cost was very high, and the programme would endure beyond 1997, the Chinese government soon critically accused Britain of plotting to use the \"Rose Garden Project\" to squander Hong Kong's abundant foreign exchange reserves, and of employing a tactic to secretly withdraw the exchange reserves and send them to the United Kingdom. They even threatened that they would not \"bless\" the project. As a result of the accusations made against it, the British government was anxious to gain the support of China. They secretly sent Cradock to China for several visits in 1990 and 1991, \"explaining\" the details of the new airport project to the Chinese leadership, and attempted to reassure the Chairman of the Central Military Commission of the Chinese Communist Party Jiang Zemin that the new airport would not bring any harm to China. Despite his reassurance, Jiang insisted that the dispute could not be solved unless Prime Minister John Major visited China to sign a memorandum.\n\nUnder pressure from China, Major was forced to visit Peking unwillingly and signed the Memorandum of Understanding Concerning the Construction of the New Airport in Hong Kong and Related Questions with China on 3 September 1991. In the Memorandum, Britain promised to reserve not less than HK$25 billion for the future government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region in exchange for the support of China over the Airport Core Programme. Furthermore, Britain agreed in the Memorandum to adopt an effectively 'proactive' attitude to assist in reducing the government debts of Hong Kong after 1997. In fact, Major felt angry about the visit because he became the first Western leader to pay visit to China after the June Fourth Incident in 1989, while the international community was still boycotting China. After the new airport episode, it was felt by the Conservative government that the soft diplomacy previously adopted by Britain in its relations with China was no longer effective, and Major concluded that Cradock and Governor Wilson had been too kind to the Chinese authorities and that they should take responsibility for that approach.\n\nThe first to go was Governor Wilson. In the New Year Honours List of 1992, it was unexpectedly announced that he would be made a life peer and be elevated to the House of Lords. Shortly afterwards, although Wilson had three more years before reaching the normal retirement age of 60, the British government suddenly announced that the governorship of Wilson would end soon and not be extended. Unlike the general practice, the British government did not name Wilson's successor as the next Governor of Hong Kong, thus leaving a lot of speculation that Wilson was forced to quit due to his weakness. When Wilson left the governorship in July 1992, he was succeeded by Chris Patten, who was Major's Conservative ally, and had risen to become Chairman of the Conservative Party, and a former Member of the Parliament who was recently defeated in the general election. A few months later, the British government announced that Cradock was to step down as Chairman of the Joint Intelligence Committee and Foreign Affairs Advisor. In the announcement, the government left no compliments to Cradock, signifying the discontent of Major.\n\nSoon after assuming the governorship, Patten adopted a tougher line with China, which was at complete variance with that of his predecessors. In his first \"Policy Address\" issued in October 1992, he vowed that all the seats of the Legislative Council would be directly and democratically elected in 1995, which would be the last election to precede the 1997 handover, with a view to accelerate the pace of democratisation of Hong Kong and to protect the fundamental human rights of the Hong Kong people. Even though his decision was welcomed by public opinion in both Hong Kong and Britain, Patten put himself in an unstable and confrontational relationship with China. When his political reform package was passed by the Legislative Council in 1994, the Chinese government decided to terminate the originally planned \"through-train\" arrangement, and to set up their own Provisional Legislative Council unilaterally, affirming that the colonial Legislative Council would not survive after 1997. Also, the planned creation of the post of \"Deputy Governor\" was aborted.\n\nGovernor Patten was much blamed by the Chinese authorities for his democratic reform, with the Director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council of the People's Republic of China, Lu Ping, once famously denouncing him as a \"sinner to be condemned for thousands of years\". In the quarrel between Patten and the Chinese government, Cradock stood firmly against Patten and criticised him on many occasions, blaming him for damaging the planned road-map which had been endorsed by both the British and Chinese governments. In 1995, Cradock publicly said in an interview that \"He [referring to Patten] has made himself so obnoxious to the Chinese\" and later, on another occasion, he described Patten as the \"incredible shrinking Governor\". Yet Patten did not remain silent, and struck back in a Legislative Council meeting, publicly ridiculing Cradock as a \"dyspeptic retired ambassador\". From 1992 to 1997, both Cradock and Patten criticised each other on many occasions, which placed them on increasingly bad terms. Although Cradock was invited by the British government to attend the ceremony of the transfer of sovereignty of Hong Kong on 30 June 1997, Cradock felt that they would not like him to be there and turned down the invitation.\n\nCradock was appointed a Privy Councillor in 1993. From 1996 to 2000, he was a non-executive director of the \"South China Morning Post\". In his later years, he lived in Richmond in southwest London, spending much of the time writing books on the Sino-British negotiations and realpolitik diplomacy. He suffered from ill health and died in London on 22 January 2010, aged 86. His funeral took place at St Mary's Church, Twickenham, in western London on 6 February 2010. Some of his former colleagues, such as former Chief Secretary of Hong Kong, Sir David Akers-Jones, were grieved over his death, but others like the founding chairman of the Democratic Party of Hong Kong Martin Lee commented adversely by saying \"I don't think he was Hong Kong's friend\".\n\nThe two major retreats of Cradock and his compromising attitude in the Sino-British negotiation aroused considerable controversies at that time. Cradock defended his actions on the grounds that he acted from a realist point of view and he thought that the United Kingdom actually had \"no card\" on hand and had little bargaining power at all. The main reasons were firstly, that Hong Kong itself must continue to rely on the provision of fresh water and food from mainland China, and secondly, that the British Armed Forces stationed in Hong Kong were too weak to defend Hong Kong from the Chinese military, and thirdly, to sustain Hong Kong's prosperity and economic development in future, Britain must co-operate with China. From the legal point of view, Cradock believed that since the Convention for the Extension of Hong Kong Territory would expire in 1997, Britain would no longer be able to govern Hong Kong effectively thereafter because the New Territories would have to be returned to China even though Hong Kong Island and Kowloon would not, and that was one of the main reasons why he advised Thatcher to compromise with China. He concluded that the solution that would best serve the interests of Hong Kong was to prevent China from acting unilaterally and to fight for the interests of the Hong Kong people within a limited and mutually agreed framework.\n\nHowever, the attitude of Cradock was heavily criticised. After the Sino-British Joint Declaration was signed, general public opinion in Hong Kong and Britain was that it could not rebuild the confidence of the Hong Kong people towards their future. Many critics even denounced Britain and the Joint Declaration as betraying the Hong Kong people and the future of Hong Kong. Among them, \"The Economist\" news magazine claimed that both Cradock and Thatcher were no different from former Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain who betrayed Czechoslovakia to Nazi Germany by signing the Munich Agreement with Adolf Hitler in 1938. Apart from that, some commentators suggested that Cradock had no reason to concur with China's view on the validity of the three treaties because under the general practice of international law, one must conclude a new treaty to invalidate and replace the old one, and therefore the three treaties were actually still in force.\n\nIt was also claimed that Cradock was indeed not a liberalist because he and the British government did not act for the interests of Hong Kong on the negotiating table. In fact, the British government believed that maintaining a friendly Sino-British relationship was of the utmost importance in preserving British business interests in China. To give up Hong Kong in exchange for a long-term friendship with China was regarded as profitable especially to the business sector in the United Kingdom. In addition, as the Joint Declaration was designed to bring stability to Hong Kong, it effectively closed the \"back door\" of entry into the United Kingdom and therefore avoided a possible influx of 3 million British subjects of Hong Kong to seek asylum or right of abode there.\nCradock was a bitter critic of Governor Patten's political and democratic reform programme, blaming him for enraging the Chinese government, for which he thought Patten should be held responsible. He also blamed the implementation of the reform programme for damaging the agreed \"through-train\" arrangement and other transitional arrangements, and that it would only bring adverse effect to the democratisation of post-1997 Hong Kong. Nevertheless, his pro-Beijing standpoint attracted much opposition and criticism in both Hong Kong and the United Kingdom. The mainstream public opinion at that time was that the memory of the Tiananmen crackdown was still vividly in the mind of many Hong Kong people, and that was why Britain had the responsibility to adequately safeguard human rights in Hong Kong, and to show support for Patten's political reform. Even though the colonial legislature would not survive after 1997, many thought that his reform was worthwhile for Hong Kong to experience the benefits resulting from a democratically elected Legislative Council, and to give a voice to the discontent of the Hong Kong public to the Chinese government by voting in the election. The Foreign Affairs Select Committee of the House of Commons also stated that it would be disreputable for the United Kingdom to not introduce political reform in response to the demand of the people of Hong Kong.\n\nAlthough Governor Patten's political reform was generally supported in Hong Kong, Cradock insisted that if Britain stood against China, Britain would find it very difficult to bargain for Hong Kong any more. In an interview in 1996 with \"The Common Sense\", a documentary produced by the Radio Television Hong Kong, Cradock claimed that the United Kingdom nearly lost all her influence over China because the two countries had been in political dispute. When asked if his attitude was equal to \"kow-tow\" to China, he admittedly replied that no matter whether the Hong Kong people were willing or not, Hong Kong must be handed over to China in 1997. He advised the people of Hong Kong that to build a harmonious relationship with China was always better than confrontation and expressing discontent. On the other hand, he also called for the Hong Kong people to face the reality and not to believe in any illusion and false hope of democracy brought forward by Chris Patten. When asked if he was advising the Hong Kong people to obey China on everything, he said that the people of Hong Kong should know who their \"Master\" was and what they could do was to try their best to convince the Chinese authority to follow what was written in the Joint Declaration, but he reiterated that most importantly, they must face the reality.\n\nIn response to Cradock's criticisms on the political reform, Governor Patten struck back on a number of occasions, and in the Legislative Council meeting on 13 July 1995, he publicly mocked Cradock and those who appeased with China as suffering from \"Craddockitis\":\n\nThough Cradock was on bad terms with Patten, he was highly valued by the Chinese government and the pro-Beijing camp. They generally praised him for playing a vital role in the making of the Sino-British Joint Declaration. The Xinhua News Agency, the official news agency of the Chinese authority, once described Cradock as a \"friend of China and an experienced British diplomat who at the same time bears in mind to safeguard the interests of his country…History has proved his sincerity and objectivity.\"\n\nFrom 1953, Cradock was married to Birthe Marie Dyrlund, who also worked in the Foreign Office. They had no children. Lady Cradoock died in September 2016. Cradock was a member of the Reform Club.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Suradji's victims, ranging in age between 11 and 30, were strangled after being buried in the ground up to their waists as part of a ritual. He buried his victims in a sugarcane plantation near his home, with their heads facing his house, which he believed would give him extra power.\n\nAhmad Suradji lived in Medan, the capital of Indonesia's North Sumatra province. He worked as a cattle-breeder and as a \"dukun\", a class of shaman reputed to possess supernatural powers. Suradji's clientele were often women seeking his guidance on how to find good fortune or maintain their beauty. According to Suradji, his deceased father visited him in a dream in 1986 and commanded him to murder 70 women as part of a black magic ritual. \n\nHis three wives, who were sisters, were also arrested for assisting in the murders and helping him hide the bodies. One of his wives, Tumini, was tried as his accomplice and was sentenced to death before it was reduced to life imprisonment. He was sentenced to death by firing squad and executed on 10 July 2008.\n\nOn 24 April 1997, 21-year-old Sri Kemala Dewi asked a 15-year-old rickshaw puller named Andreas to take her to \"Datuk\". She informed him to keep it a secret and never requested to be picked up. Three days later, Dewi's naked and decomposing body was found in a sugarcane field by a man and was later dug up by a group of people who then called the police. Andreas reported to the police and Dewi's family that he had dropped her off at Suradji's house three days earlier, and so police visited Suradji for confrontation. Although he denied any links with Dewi's killing, police found Dewi's handbag, dress and bracelet in his home. He was later arrested on 30 April 1997. During interrogation, Suradji slowly confessed to Dewi's murder but also revealed that he had killed up to 42 girls in the same fashion and an excavation process had to be carried out in the sugarcane field where Dewi's body was located. Throughout the process, 42 bodies had been found with some being so decomposed to the point where they were unidentifiable.\n\nHe told police that he had a dream in 1986 in which his father's ghost directed him to drink the saliva of 70 dead young women so that he could become a mystic healer. Suradji thought that it would take him too long to encounter 70 dead women singly and so he took up the initiative to kill. As a sorcerer, or dukun, women came to him for spiritual advice for such things like making themselves more beautiful or richer or so Suradji could cast a spell on their spouses so they'll never have an affair. He would take them into a sugarcane field and bury them up to their waist, claiming it was part of the ritual. He would then strangle them until they were dead and proceed to drink their saliva. After, he would strip the clothes from their bodies to accelerate decomposition and bury them back into the ground with their heads pointing toward his house. Suradji stated the following to the police:\n\n"}

After nationalisation in 1948, another 200 were built by private contractors for British Railways (BR). Most had very short working lives as the duties for which they were designed disappeared through changes in working practices or were taken over by diesel locomotives. Two locomotives survived into preservation, with the oldest of the class, 9400 as part of the National Collection.\n\nThe 9400 class was the final development in a long lineage of tank locomotives that can be directly traced to the 645 Class of 1872. Over the decades details altered, the most significant being the adoption of Belpaire fireboxes necessitating pannier tanks.\n\nThe 9400 resembled a pannier tank version of the 2251 class, and indeed shared the same boiler and cylinders as the 2251, but was in fact a taper-boilered development of the 8750 subgroup of the 5700 class. The advantage was a useful increase in boiler power, but there was a significant weight penalty that restricted route availability. The 10 GWR-built locomotives had superheaters but the remainder did not.\n\nThe first ten 9400s were built by the Great Western and were the last steam engines built by the company. After the nationalisation of Britain's railways in 1948, private contractors built another 200 for British Railways.\n\nThe 9400s were numbered 9400–9499, 8400–8499 and 3400–3409. BR gave them the power classification 4F.\n\nNo. 3409 was the last locomotive built for British mainline use by private contractors. It was ordered by GWR in December 1947 and delivered by Yorkshire Engine Company in October 1956.\n\nThe 9400 class were used on Paddington empty stock work right up to the end of steam on the Western Region of British Railways. A familiar sight at the buffer stops at departure side in 1964–1965 was a filthy 9400 class locomotive devoid of number plates simmering at the head of a rake of British Railways Mark 1 coaches.\n\nNumbers 8400 to 8406 served as bank engines on the Lickey Incline after its transferral to the Western Region.\n\nIn retrospect they were a wasteful investment, many having very short lives of less than 10 years as their intended work dried up and diesels took over their remaining duties. 8447 holds the unenviable record of the shortest life of any GWR loco in BR times, beginning in August 1954 and ending just four years and nine months later in May 1959.\n\nTwo have been preserved:\nLima produced a model of the class in 00 gauge between 1978 and 1985 also Graham Farish produced an 00 model in the 1960s.\nGraham Farish manufacture a model of the 94xx in N scale.

Its main source is located in the Los Buellis Hills slightly west of Felter Road. Berryessa Creek has many tributaries, including Piedmont Creek, Calera Creek, and Penitencia Creek. In the summer, Berryessa Creek is mostly dry except in Milpitas, where much of its water comes from urban runoff and tributaries. In winter, however, the creek can flood very high and pose a hazard for surrounding residences. The creek was named after a member of the prominent Basque–Spanish Berreyesa family: Nicolas Berreyesa, a Californio settler granted the Rancho Milpitas in 1834.\n\nBerryessa Creek begins in the Los Buellis Hills near Felter Road. Several different forks of the creek gradually merge until Berryessa Creek becomes a single stream at Piedmont Road. The various forks are located mostly in undeveloped hills owned by a local water department and are used for cattle grazing. After crossing under Piedmont Road, Berryessa Creek forms the northern boundary of Berryessa Creek Park in the Berryessa neighborhood. At Morrill Avenue, Berryessa Creek becomes a straightened ditch. It then winds its way north into Milpitas. In Milpitas, Piedmont Creek, Arroyo de los Coches, and Calera Creek, respectively, dump into Berryessa Creek. The large creek then ends at Lower Penitencia Creek, which continues on to merge with Coyote Creek near the Newby Island Landfill at Dixon Landing Road, and then into the San Francisco Bay.\n\nBerryessa Creek has several tributaries that are primarily from Milpitas. Some of the tributaries are described below.\n\nPiedmont Creek has three or four forks beginning at private ranch properties in the eastern foothills in Milpitas. The south fork is from government property leased to cattle ranching companies and is used to graze cattle. The north fork also originates in the eastern hills but instead begins at the Silvas' private ranch. At Piedmont Road, the two forks of Piedmont Creek becomes an underground stream that winds under residences and dumps into the Berryessa Creek in an industrial zone. The entire length of the creek is only about three miles long.\n\nArroyo de los Coches, alternatively called Los Coches Creek, is a seasonal stream from the Milpitas hills. Named in the 1800s by the Spanish, its name means \"Creek of the Wild Pigs.\" (Los Coches Creek still has many wild pigs.) The creek begins at the former JMP Ranch that is now about to be developed into 17 single-family homes. It passes by Spring Valley Homes and travels parallel to Vista Ridge Road. Now in Ed R. Levin County Park, the creek keeps going west and then winds downhills with Calaveras Road by its side. After crossing Piedmont Road, which marks the boundary between the urban and rural sections of Milpitas, the creek turns into a straightened ditch and continues to travel parallel to Calaveras Road. After going under Interstate 680, it merges with Berryessa Creek.\n\nCalera Creek begins at north Ed R. Levin County Park from a number of springs from the west side of the Monument Peak ridge. It rushes down steep hillsides at about 45 degrees. The creek then reaches the urban parts of Milpitas as it passes by the historic Higuera Adobe. As an artificially created ditch, it then traverses through a number of housing developments and passes Milpitas High School. Calera Creek then merges with Berryessa Creek.\n\nCalera Creek used to be a prime spot for native rainbow trout fishing. When it was converted into a ditch in the 1960s to prevent flooding the newly constructed housing developments, the creek lost almost all of its fish . The Santa Clara Valley Water District now places several plaques at the banks of Berryessa Creek informing passers-by about the ecology and environment of the creek.\n\n"}

Barnett was traveling in war-torn Uganda when he gave a small boy a ride from his destroyed home to a safer village. During their journey, the child did what he knew how to do best – he sang. That simple song of dignity and hope became the catalyst for a program that has changed the lives of thousands of children. From there the African Children's Choir was born. Rallying support from the west, Barnett conducted the first tour, in 1984. As the organization grew so did the needs of the children. The choir began selecting Kenyan children in 1990.

These children have either been orphaned by AIDS, or have parents that can no longer care for and provide for them, or who are in the care of aged grandparents who are unable to effectively care for them. Music for Life Centers provides music, dance, life skills, as well as nutrition and education (many of the centers are actually based in schools).\n\nThese are schools that have been developed for African Children's Choir participants. The children in these schools have all been on tour and are selected for their musical ability, academic potential and have been orphaned and/or come from vulnerable situations. The schools build upon the experiences these children have had while on tour and continue to further develop these children's talents and abilities while providing the support of a family.\n\nThese schools are part of the Music for Life Program that assists children (who are not in the choir) and their communities. These schools have either been built by, or have been financially supported by sponsors. The first of these schools was the African Outreach Academy in Uganda, which served as a community support model in 1984 and was the original home of the African Children's Choir.\n\nIn Sudan, where the infrastructure was decimated by civil war, Music For Life is rebuilding the educational system by providing training for new teachers throughout the country.\n\n12 Million Orphans is an educational campaign representing the over 12 million orphans in sub-Saharan Africa. The program lobbies and cares for some of these children, provides information on this vulnerable sector, and focuses the world's attention on their issues. The main program to reach these children is the Music for Life Centers.\n\n\n"}

Charge-pump circuits are capable of high efficiencies, sometimes as high as 90–95%, while being electrically simple circuits.\n\nCharge pumps use some form of switching device to control the connection of a supply voltage across a load through a capacitor. In a two stage cycle, in the first stage a capacitor is connected across the supply, charging it to that same voltage. In the second stage the circuit is reconfigured so that the capacitor is in series with the supply and the load. This doubles the voltage across the load - the sum of the original supply and the capacitor voltages. The pulsing nature of the higher voltage switched output is often smoothed by the use of an output capacitor.\n\nAn external or secondary circuit drives the switching, typically at tens of kilohertz up to several megahertz. The high frequency minimizes the amount of capacitance required, as less charge needs to be stored and dumped in a shorter cycle.\n\nCharge pumps can double voltages, triple voltages, halve voltages, invert voltages, fractionally multiply or scale voltages (such as ×3/2, ×4/3, ×2/3, etc.) and generate arbitrary voltages by quickly alternating between modes, depending on the controller and circuit topology.\n\nThey are commonly used in low-power electronics (such as mobile phones) to raise and lower voltages for different parts of the circuitry - minimizing power consumption by controlling supply voltages carefully.\n\nThe term \"charge pump\" is also commonly used in phase-locked loop (PLL) circuits even though there is no pumping action involved unlike in the circuit discussed above. A PLL charge pump is merely a bipolar switched current source. This means that it can output positive and negative current pulses into the loop filter of the PLL. It cannot produce higher or lower voltages than its power and ground supply levels.\n\n\n\nApplying the equivalent resistor concept to calculating the power losses in the charge pumps \n\nCharge pumps where the voltages across the capacitors follow the binary number system\n\n"}

The club was founded in 2001, and is an expression of the ambitions of the city council of Almere to play an active role in top sports. To that end, a sports club (Omniworld) was formed, which now comprises a volleyball branch, a basketball branch and a football branch. Before the 2010–11 season, the club was called FC Omniworld.\n\nAlmere City can trace its history back to 1976, with the merger of DWS, Volewijckers and Blauw-Wit into FC Amsterdam. Disgruntled DWS supporters founded their own club, De Zwarte Schapen, named after their nickname, which translates as \"Black Sheep\". The club quickly rose through the ranks of Dutch amateur football, eventually reaching the Hoofdklasse. After several violent incidents on the pitch and a six-month suspension by the Royal Dutch Football Association (KNVB), the club moved from Amsterdam to nearby Almere and changed its name to Sporting Flevoland.\nThat name was changed to FC Omniworld in 2001 as a result of the efforts of a consortium (in which the city of Almere was a participant) to bring professional sports to Almere. These plans included a basketball club (BC Omniworld, now defunct), a volleyball club (VC Omniworld, now defunct) and the football club (FC Omniworld). However, when the Leefbaar Almere party became the largest party in the city council in 2002, the community withdrew from the project. This caused the club to fail the criteria for admission to the professional league in 2004.\n\nPrivate investors were found, and the club managed to meet the first two criteria for admission (among which is a balanced budget) in late 2004 and early 2005. After FC Omniworld's stadium (the 3,000 seater Yanmar Stadion) and pitch were approved by the KNVB as well, the club met all criteria for admission, and joined the 19 clubs already in the Eerste Divisie. The club's first official match would have been held on 12 August 2005 against BV Veendam. However, the referee postponed the match shortly before the kick-off because heavy rain had made the artificial turf pitch unplayable. The club's professional debut came a week later, in an away match against FC Eindhoven, a 2–0 defeat. FC Omniworld registered its first official goal a few days later, in a 2–3 home defeat against FC Den Bosch, as Juan Viedma Schenkhuizen scored to make the score 1–2 in the 37th minute. Omniworld's first league point was achieved a week later, on 29 August against Go Ahead Eagles (2–2). The club's first victory came on 16 September, when Fortuna Sittard were defeated 3–2. In its first season, Omniworld finished in 19th place with 29 points from 38 matches. Forward Sjoerd Ars ended in fifth place in the top goalscorer ranking, with 17 goals.\n\nArs was transferred to Go Ahead Eagles for the 2006–07 season, but the results for Omniworld improved. The club achieved 41 points from 38 matches, finishing the season in 16th place. The 2–7 home match defeat FC Zwolle on the 16th of March 2007 resulted in the then-worst defeat in clubs short history.\n\nIn March 2010, the club was renamed AFC Almere City before being changed again a few weeks later to Almere City FC, as the \"AFC\" prefix was deemed to be too reminiscent of the club's partners AFC Ajax. In their second match of the 2010–11 season, they were defeated 12–1 by Sparta Rotterdam, who equalled Ajax's Dutch league record win, with Johan Voskamp scoring a Jupiler League record eight goals on his debut.\n\nIn August 2019, the club announced plans of building a new grandstand and a club office building. The grandstand was completed during the 2020 winter break and has increased the capacity of the stadium from around 3,000 to 4,501 spectators.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2169788", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2169788", "title": "Upsherin", "text": "Upsherin\n\nUpsherin, Upsheren, Opsherin or Upsherinish (Yiddish: אפשערן, lit. \"shear off\", Judaeo-Arabic: חלאקה, \"ḥalāqah\") is a haircutting ceremony observed by a wide cross-section of Jews and is particularly popular in Haredi Jewish communities. It is typically held when a boy turns three years old. Among those who practice the upsherin, the male infant does not have his hair cut until this ceremony. \n\nThe upsherin tradition is a relatively modern custom in Judaism and has only become a popular practice since the 17th century.\n\nYoram Bilu, a professor of anthropology and psychology at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, suggests that there is little or no religious basis for the custom and its popularity is probably mainly social. The following are some quotes from his paper,\n\nTwo disparate hair-related practices appear to have converged in the haircutting ritual: the growing of ear-locks payoth - s.d.] and the shearing of the head hair. ... Ritual haircut, probably modeled on the Muslim custom of shaving male children's hair in saints' sanctuaries, was practiced by native Palestinian Jews (Musta'arbim) as early as the Middle Ages. Rabbi Isaac Luria Ashkenazi, the 16th-century founder of the celebrated Lurianic School of Kabbalah who assigned special mystical value to the ear-locks, was instrumental in constituting the ritual in its present form. The ritual remained primarily a Sephardi custom following Luria, but in the last 200 years it became widespread among East European Hasidim. From Palestine it spread to the Diaspora communities, where it was usually celebrated in a more modest family\nsetting.\n\nRabbi Chaim Vital wrote in Sha'ar Ha-Kavanot that \"Isaac Luria, cut his son's hair on Lag BaOmer, according to the well-known custom.\" However, the age of his son is not mentioned. An obvious problem raised by Avraham Yaari, in an article in Tarbiz 22 (1951), is that many sources cite that Luria held one should not cut one's hair for the entire sefirah – including Lag BaOmer, (see Shaarei Teshuva, O.C. 493, 8). \n\nWe know from travellers that by the 18th and 19th centuries, the \"hilula\" at Meron on Lag BaOmer with bonfires and the cutting of children's hair had by then become an affair of the masses. A well-known Talmud scholar from Bulgaria, Rabbi Abraham ben Israel Rosanes, wrote that, in his visit to Palestine in 1867, he saw an Ashkenazi Jew giving his son a haircut at the hilula. R. Rosanes says that he could not restrain himself, and went to the Jew and tried to dissuade him, yet was unsuccessful; he also complained that most of the Ashkenazi and Sephardi Jews of Israel were participating in this \"insanity,\" with \"drinking and dancing and fires.\"\n\nA Hasidic rebbe, R. Yehudah Leibush Horenstein, who emigrated to Palestine in the middle of the 19th century, writes that \"this haircut, called \"halaqe\", is done by the Sephardim in Jerusalem at the tomb of Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai during the summer, but during the winter they take the boy to the synagogue or Beit Midrash and perform the haircut with great celebration and parties, something unknown to the Jews in Europe.\"\n\nSome Haredi rabbis, among them Rabbi Yaakov Yisrael Kanievsky (the Steipler) and Rabbi Yitzchak Zev Soloveitchik opposed the practice on various grounds, but it is popular among Hasidic Jews and has spread in recent years to other Jewish groups.\n\nIn the Hasidic community, the \"upsherin\" marks a male child's entry into the formal educational system and the commencement of Torah study. A yarmulke and tzitzis will now be worn, and the child will be taught to pray and read the Hebrew alphabet. So that Torah should be \"sweet on the tongue,\" the Hebrew letters are covered with honey, and the children lick them as they read.\n\nSometimes the hair that is cut off in the \"upsherin\" ceremony is weighed, and charity is given in that amount. If the hair is long enough, it may be donated to a charity that makes wigs for cancer patients.<ref>\n"}
{"id": "2169789", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2169789", "title": "Playing the Angel", "text": "Playing the Angel\n\nPlaying the Angel is the eleventh studio album by English electronic music band Depeche Mode. It was first released on 13 October 2005 through Mute Records internationally, and through Sire Records and Reprise Records in the United States. It was supported by the Touring the Angel tour and the four singles \"Precious\", \"A Pain That I'm Used To\", \"Suffer Well\", and \"John the Revelator\" / \"Lilian\". The album reached number one in over 10 countries and entered the top 10 in the United Kingdom and United States. It has also received gold and platinum certifications in 15 countries.\n\n\"Playing the Angel\" is the first Depeche Mode album to feature lead singer Dave Gahan as co-writer. He wrote the lyrics to \"Suffer Well\", \"I Want It All\" and \"Nothing's Impossible\", while Christian Eigner and Andrew Phillpott wrote the music. Gahan is the lead singer on all songs except for the instrumental \"Introspectre\", and Martin Gore-sung tracks \"Macro\" and \"Damaged People\". Gahan also sings backing vocals on \"Macro\", which was the first time he had sung backing vocals on a song sung by Gore. The title \"Playing the Angel\" is taken from a lyric in the closing song \"The Darkest Star\". It is the fourth Depeche Mode album to get its name from a lyric in one of its songs, the other three being \"Construction Time Again\", \"Some Great Reward\" and \"Black Celebration\".\n\nGillian Telling of \"Rolling Stone\" described the album's sound as featuring \"the band's classic blend of synth-pop beats, heavy guitar riffs and dark lyrics\". The album has been called a more organic record for using more analogue synths than digital ones. In addition, most of the soundscapes presented are harsher and groovier than the more mellow \"Exciter\".\n\nTracks recorded during the \"Playing the Angel\" sessions that did not make the album include \"Martyr\", which was originally planned to be the lead single but was eventually deemed too poppy for the album and saved for \"The Best of Depeche Mode Volume 1\". Other songs include \"Free\", which ended up on the \"Precious\" single and the Japanese version of \"Playing the Angel\".\n\nIn mid-July 2005, the unfinished video for \"Precious\" was leaked online. It is believed to have been leaked through the website of the production team that helped make the video.\n\nThe album was released as a Copy Controlled CD and a deluxe SACD/DVD version (CD/DVD version in the United States) which includes the album on hybrid multi-channel SACD as the main disc and a bonus DVD featuring an exclusive studio performance of \"Clean\" (from \"Violator\"), the video for \"Precious\", a photo gallery and a 5.1 mix of the album. There is also a documentary on the making of the album. All ten of the earlier Depeche Mode albums were re-released in similar format to \"Playing the Angel\", a CD/SACD hybrid (in the US simply a remastered CD) with a DVD featuring a 5.1 mix of each album and a documentary, though \"Playing the Angel\"'s documentary is far less extensive and also shorter than the classic ones. The album was also released on vinyl as double LP housed in gatefold sleeve.\n\nThe iTunes deluxe edition of the album has several bonuses, including another \"bare\" version of a \"Violator\" track, \"Waiting for the Night\", and the music video for \"Precious\". People who placed the album on pre-order were eligible to participate in a ticket pre-sale for most Touring the Angel concerts, the first time such an offer was made by iTunes and Ticketmaster.\n\n\"Playing the Angel\" received positive reviews. E! Online and \"Entertainment Weekly\" gave the album high scores. \"Pitchfork\" gave the album a positive review, but criticized its lack of innovation. However, there are some negative reviews; \"Rolling Stone\" magazine rated the album two-and-a-half stars out of five, lower than the score received by \"Exciter\".\n\nThe album was ranked number 20 on E! Online's Top 20 Albums of 2005 list and number 68 on WOXY's Top 97 Albums of 2005.\n\nThe Red Book version of the album is considered by numerous fans to be poorly mastered, relying on heavy compression to intentionally and artificially boost the output, especially when compared with the vinyl version that was mastered differently.\n\n\"Playing the Angel\" debuted at number six on the UK Albums Chart, selling 32,505 copies in its first week. In the United States, the album debuted at number seven on the \"Billboard\" 200 with first-week sales of 98,000 copies. Both peak chart positions are improvements on the band's previous album, \"Exciter\", which charted at number nine and eight, respectively, although \"Exciter\" attained larger US first-week sales of 115,000 units. \"Playing the Angel\" had sold 418,000 copies in the US as of November 2007. By January 2007, the album had sold 1.6 million copies worldwide (excluding the US and Canada), according to EMI.\n\n\nCredits for adapted from the liner notes of \"Playing the Angel\".\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

This work is considered one of the earliest Arabic Islamic histories to have survived to the present day.\n\nThe author's father ʿAbdullah and brother Muhammad were the leading Egyptian authorities of their time (early 9th century) on Malikite Islamic law. After the father's death, the family were persecuted by the caliph Al-Wathiq for their adherence to orthodox doctrine. Although much quoted by early traditionists and historians, they are rarely mentioned by name because of a family disgrace. In the reign of the caliph Al-Mutawakkil the historian and his brothers were accused of embezzlement of a deceased estate, imprisoned, and one of the brothers even died under torture.\n\nʿAbd ar-Raḥman ibn ʿAbd al-Ḥakam was, strictly speaking, a traditionist rather than a pure and general historian. He was interested mainly in historical incidents which illustrated early Muslim customs which he could use to teach Islamic law. His sources were books compiled by very early traditionists and now lost, and oral sources such as his own father.\n\nFour manuscripts survive of the author's historical work, all of them considered to derive from a single copy originally perhaps made by one of his students. Two of these are titled simply \"Futūḥ mișr\" (, Conquest of Egypt), one is titled \"Futūḥ mișr wa akhbārahā\" (, Conquest of Egypt and some account of it, i.e. of the country), and one has the fuller title given at the head of this article.\n\nA critical edition of the entire Arabic text was published by Charles Torrey, who had earlier translated the North African section into English. A short portion of the work covering only the Muslim conquest of Spain was translated into English by John Harris Jones (Göttingen, W. Fr. Kaestner, 1858, pp. 18–22). The Spanish and North African sections have also been translated into French and Spanish by a number of historians. However, these account for only a small part of the book. Most of the work is devoted to the legendary pre-Islamic history of Egypt, The Muslim conquest of Egypt, The Muslim conquest of North Africa, its early Muslim settlements and its first Islamic judges.\n\nHis work is an almost invaluable source as arguably the earliest Arab account of the Islamic conquests of the countries it deals with. However, it was written some 200 years after the events it describes, and therefore largely mixes facts with later legends.\n\n"}

Along with the French Concorde F-WTSB, the aircraft was used to enable sufficient testing to allow for the Concorde fleet to receive certification. She was stored at Filton airfield from the mid-1980s until 2003, when she was transported by road to the Brooklands Museum in Weybridge, Surrey.\n\nG-BBDG first flew on the 13th of February 1974, having been registered on 7th of August 1973. Her main uses were finalising the Concorde design before the other aircraft entered passenger service and certification prior to Concorde entering passenger service.\n\nThere were some differences between this aircraft and the final production aircraft, such as a thinner fuselage skin. The aircraft was painted in British Airways livery throughout her testing period. The aircraft flew a total of 1282 hrs 9 mins; its final flight was on the 24th of December 1981.\n\nAfter the final flight, she was stored at Filton in a state of semi-airworthiness throughout 1982, where she could be returned to flight in two weeks if required. However this was never required and the aircraft was eventually bought by British Airways as part of a Concorde support buy-out in 1984.\n\nThe aircraft never entered service with British Airways; instead she was used as a major source of spare parts, allowing the airline to operate a fleet of seven aircraft. A hangar was constructed for her at Filton airfield in the late 1980s; her tail was removed prior to its being put in the hangar.\n\nIn 1995, Concorde G-BOAF had her nose damaged in a handling accident at Heathrow Airport. British Airways swapped this nose with the nose of the Filton Concorde. As well as her nose and tail, other parts were taken, including her engines, landing gear and the majority of the components from the hydraulic system. The original nose was later repaired at Brooklands and returned to G-BBDG.\n\nThe aircraft was considered for scrapping many times, but was always found to be useful. In 2001, it was used to test reinforced cockpit doors required for all aircraft after the 9/11 terrorist attacks.\n\nWhen British Airways and Air France retired their fleets in 2003, Brooklands Museum at Weybridge in Surrey accepted the aircraft as a museum exhibit. She was dismantled as fully as possible and the rest was cut up into five major sections and transported by road to Brooklands Museum. The task of structurally disassembling and reassembling the aircraft was carried out by Air Salvage International (ASI). She was then restored by a team of over 100 volunteers from the museum, assisted by students from the University of Surrey.\n\nThe Concorde Experience was opened at the museum in July 2006 by Prince Michael of Kent; it allows visitors to enter the aircraft and experience a virtual flight at speeds up to Mach 2.\n\nAfter many years of being retired and placed in Brooklands, in 2014, Brooklands Museum tested the droop-nose of the Concorde mechanically (without using electricity and any control from the cockpit), the test was deemed a success and helped prove it was possible to activate the nose that hasn't been used for many years.\n\nOn the 23rd of July 2016, G-BBDG had her nose lowered by Jodie Kidd independently for the first time since her retirement, it was watched by a huge crowd including former captains and crew of the aircraft.\n\n"}

Passenger traffic at the airport in 2011 was 1,404,119, making it the 102nd busiest airport in the country. The SJTA owns a small area around the terminal and leases runways and other land from the FAA. \n\nIn 1942, Naval Air Station Atlantic City was built on of leased private land in Egg Harbor Township, New Jersey. Its purpose was to train various carrier air groups consisting of fighter, bomber and torpedo squadrons.\n\nIn August 1943, NAS Atlantic City changed its mission to strictly fighter training, consisting of low and high altitude gunnery tactics, field carrier landing practice (FCLP), carrier qualifications (CQ), bombing, formation tactics, fighter direction, night operations and an associated ground school curriculum.\n\nNAS Atlantic City was decommissioned in June 1958 and transferred to the Airways Modernization Board (AMB), later taken over by the FAA. In November 1958 the then-Federal Aviation Agency, now Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), took over operations of the AMB. The lease transferred to the FAA and was sold for $55,000. Atlantic City decided to retain 84 of the 4,312 acres. The FAA expanded the former U.S. Navy land parcel to about and established the National Aviation Facilities Experimental Center research facility that eventually became the William J. Hughes Technical Center. The South Jersey Transportation Authority (SJTA) initially leased portions of the airport from the FAA and now serves as the airport owner and operator of the facility.\n\nWhen the Navy departed in 1958, the 119th Fighter Squadron of the New Jersey Air National Guard relocated to Atlantic City from their former base at Newark International Airport with their F-84F Thunderstreak aircraft, establishing an Air National Guard base on the site of the former naval air station. The current 177th Fighter Wing of the New Jersey Air National Guard has been at this location ever since.\n\nDuring the 1960s and early 1970s, the active duty U.S. Air Force's 95th Fighter Interceptor Squadron, stationed at Dover AFB, Delaware, maintained an Operating Location and Alert Detachment of F-106 Delta Darts at Atlantic City ANGB on 24-hour alert. After the 177th Fighter Wing reequipped with the F-106 in 1973, the 177th took on the air defence alert mission.\n\nIn the fall of 1983, American International Airways attempted to operate a small hub at the airport with Douglas DC-9-30 jetliners with passenger service to Boston, Buffalo, Chicago, Cleveland, Detroit, Fort Lauderdale, Miami, Orlando, Pittsburgh, Tampa and West Palm Beach. ACY has also had US Airways jet service to Pittsburgh as well as US Airways Express turboprops to Philadelphia, Baltimore and Washington, and Continental Express turboprops and regional jets to Cleveland Hopkins International Airport. This regional jet service for Continental Airlines was operated by ExpressJet Airlines with Embraer ERJs.\n\nDelta Air Lines also had flights to Boston on Delta Connection regional jets operated by Atlantic Coast Airlines until a few years ago. In addition, Delta Connection via its partner Comair operated flights to Cincinnati and Orlando, which ended on May 1, 2007. WestJet had Boeing 737 jetliner flights from ACY to Toronto, but ended them on May 9, 2010, leaving the airport with no international service. On April 1, 2014, United Airlines started service from Atlantic City to Chicago–O'Hare and Houston, but the service was discontinued on December 3, 2014. Air Canada had seasonal flights to Toronto in the Summer of 2015, but has decided not to return in the Summer of 2016, once again leaving the airport without international scheduled flights.\n\nSince 1958, the airport has been home to Atlantic City Air National Guard Base and the 177th Fighter Wing (177 FW), an Air Combat Command (ACC)-gained unit of the New Jersey Air National Guard, operating the F-16C/D Fighting Falcon. Since October 1998, the wing has had an active involvement in Operation Noble Eagle, Operation Southern Watch, Operation Northern Watch, Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom. As an Air National Guard unit, the 177 FW has dual federal (USAF augmentation) and state (support to New Jersey) missions.\n\nACY is also home to Coast Guard Air Station Atlantic City. CGAS Atlantic City was opened on May 18, 1998, and is the newest and largest single airframe unit and facility of the Coast Guard's air stations. It is a product of the merging of the former CGAS Brooklyn/Floyd Bennett Field, NY and Group Air Station Cape May, NJ into one unit. CGAS Atlantic City consists of 10 HH-65C Dolphin helicopters and it maintains two Dolphin helicopters in 30-minute response status. Approximately, 250 aviation personnel comprise the facility's full-time staff, augmented by additional part-time Coast Guard Reserve and Coast Guard Auxiliary personnel. CGAS Atlantic City also provides aircrews and aircraft to the Washington, D.C. area as part of Operation Noble Eagle, the Department of Defense USNORTHCOM / NORAD mission to protect U.S. airspace and, in this case, specifically around the nation's capital.\n\nAtlantic City International Airport covers at an elevation of 75 feet (23 m) above mean sea level. It has two runways: 4/22 is 6,144 by 150 feet (1,873 x 46 m) asphalt/concrete; 13/31 is 10,000 by 150 feet (3,048 x 46 m) asphalt.\n\nAtlantic City International Airport has one terminal. Several charter carriers operate out of the terminal, along with scheduled flights of Spirit Airlines. The terminal has a small layout, making it an alternative to Philadelphia International Airport or Newark Liberty International Airport.\n\nPassengers enter the terminal on the lower-level which has the check-in counters, a small grill and a gift shop. Baggage claim is on this level, with three carousels. After check-in, passengers proceed to the security checkpoint, also on this level. After the security checkpoint, stairs and escalators lead to the departures level. The 10 gates are here, with several open for use by charters and several used by the scheduled carriers. All gates are uniform, with no customization by the airlines. Also on the second level is a café, a bar and a newsstand.\n\nFree Wi-Fi is available throughout the terminal.\n\nAtlantic City International Airport has a six-story parking garage with a covered walkway within steps to the terminal building. Surface parking is within walking distance and shuttle service is provided from the economy parking area to the terminal building.\n\nThe parking garage has rental car facilities for Enterprise, Hertz, Avis and Budget.\n\nTaxi service is available at curbside and a shuttle service is provided by the Atlantic City Jitney Association, located in the airport terminal, outside of baggage claim. A shuttle bus brings passengers to the Egg Harbor City rail station, which provides service to the Atlantic City Line, which runs between the 30th Street Station in Philadelphia to the Atlantic City Rail Terminal. Shuttles to the Egg Harbor rail station connect to shuttles to the visitor's center at the FAA Technical Center and the Stockton University, as well as bus lines to the PATCO Speedline at the Lindenwold station.\n\n\nThe South Jersey Transportation Authority will begin construction of a new aircraft rescue and firefighting station at Atlantic City International Airport. The new 45,000 square foot building will feature vehicle bays, administrative and staff living areas, enhanced equipment and apparatus facilities as well as room for training requirements.\n\nWork began in August 2011 upgrading the passenger screening facilities at airport. The checkpoint expansion will consist of the addition of three new screening lanes as well as improvements to the airport's infrastructure. The TSA will supply the new screening equipment for the expanded area. The expansion also includes development of a Federal Inspection Services station. Under this project, equipment will include additional passenger loading bridges and gates, new technological upgrades, baggage carousel improvements, added retail space and improved check-in capabilities.\n\nA bill has been submitted in the New Jersey legislature that would provide for a rail station at the airport that would become a part of NJ Transit's Atlantic City Line. No specific funding or budget has been drawn up, but estimates for the project are in the range of $25 million to $30 million.\n\nIn 2017 the airport had 53,506 aircraft operations, an average of 147 per day: 41% military, 15% scheduled commercial, 35% general aviation and 9% air taxi. 46 aircraft were then based at this airport: 24% single-engine, 4% jet, 24% helicopter and 48% military.\n\nA technology park housing Next Generation Air Transportation System is currently under construction on the airport property on a lot near Amelia Earhart Boulevard and Delilah Road. The seven-building complex is set to contain of offices, laboratories and research facilities. The park will focus on developing new computer equipment that will transform the country's air-traffic control program into a satellite-based system. The first of the buildings was originally set to open in April 2012 and will contain a lab for the FAA as well as research space for other tenants.\n\nA second office park, the NextGen International Aviation Center for Excellence, is set to be built in nearby Hamilton Township, adjacent to the Hamilton Mall and Atlantic City Race Course, the latter of which is set to be renovated. A new transportation center at the site would transfer workers between the two complexes.\n\nIn 2009, the SJTA awarded a contract to a Ventnor City-based construction firm to construct a hotel on a property leased from the FAA at the intersection of Tilton and Delilah Roads. Plans call for a 135-room hotel including some extended-stay suites, about of conference space, of retail space and possibly a restaurant. The hotel would be built to accommodate a new flood of business travelers brought by the NextGen technical park.\n\nThe SJTA revealed plans for a major road improvement project that would link the airport directly to the Atlantic City Expressway, with construction beginning in 2013. The plan includes new ramps with two overpasses over the expressway. The road would connect Amelia Earhart Boulevard with a bridge over Airport Circle. Plans also call for building a service road with another overpass that would provide access to Delilah Road. Another project involves the installation of an overpass at the end of Amelia Earhart Boulevard next to the entrance to the FAA tech center. The proposed roadway would intrude upon a small section of a mobile home park and land owned by Egg Harbor Township. The project was delayed due to a lack of financing. The 2018 Statewide Transportation Improvement Program included the direct connector, with an estimated cost of $60 million, to be built from 2019 to 2020.\n\nIn February 2011, the New Jersey Legislature authorized the Atlantic City Tourism District, which would promote continued development of tourism in the region. A provision included the potential transfer of operations for ACY to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. New Jersey Governor Chris Christie in March 2013 ordered a takeover of the airport's operations by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.\n\nOn July 26, 1969, TWA Flight 5787, a Boeing 707 operating as a training flight, crashed while performing a practice missed approach with an engine out on runway 13. All five crew members aboard were killed. The NTSB subsequently attributed the cause of the accident to be poor procedures for simulating engine failures and failure to apply the correct procedure for hydraulic failure, as well as loss of hydraulic power to the rudder in a critical flight condition. \n\n"}

Released on Steam on November 30, 2004, it uses many of the assets from \"Half-Life 2\" and its Source engine. It features new levels, optimized for multiplayer arena play, and a few new weapons. Also included are portions of the game's source code, which were the basis for many early Source-based multiplayer modifications. The game is the successor to the popular multiplayer component of the original \"Half-Life\", but is offered as a separate product from \"Half-Life 2\". \"Deathmatch\", like \"Half-Life\"s multiplayer, does not develop any part of the plot or story of the \"Half-Life\" series.\n\nDeathmatch includes some notable features such as instant respawn; weapons that have specific spawn points; and special abilities (sprint, flashlight, etc.). The aim of the deathmatch is simple: the player must kill other players to score points. If the player accidentally self-kills, they lose points. If a player is killed, they will respawn with 100 health points and the default spawn weapons, but will lose all the weapons and ammunition acquired before being killed.\n\nThe game is server based and each server contains different rules for each round therefore there is no default time limit or kill limit for each round.\n\nIn the team deathmatch mode, players are organized in two teams, Resistance and Combine, both of them with different characters that appear exactly as they do in \"Half-Life 2\". In the gaming aspect, team deathmatch has almost the same rules as deathmatch mode, except for:\n\n\nUpon the release and subsequent critical reception of \"Half-Life 2\", reviewers expressed disappointment with the game's lack of multiplayer. Two weeks after the initial release of \"Half-Life 2\", Valve revealed and released \"Half-Life 2: Deathmatch\" on Steam. \"Deathmatch\" was released simultaneously with the Source SDK as a means of promoting game modifications built upon the platform.\n\nPost-release, the game was supported with new maps from Valve as well as updates to the game and its engine. Valve's The \"Orange Box\" does not include \"Half-Life 2: Deathmatch\", however, the game was upgraded to use the Orange Box version of the Source engine in September 2010. Valve announced a free promotional offer on January 10, 2008, which allowed NVIDIA graphics card users to download and play \"Half-Life 2: Deathmatch\" along with \"Portal: First Slice\", \"\", and \"Peggle Extreme\".\n\nIn September 2010, the game was released via Steam for OS X. A Linux version came more than two years later, in March 2013.\n\n\"Half Life 2: Deathmatch\" was well-received upon its release, with reviewers praising its inclusion of the gravity gun. GameSpot lauded the game for the Source engine's \"impressive use of physics\" and the available selection of maps. IGN paid similar compliments to the title, also speaking highly of the \"fast play style that [\"Half-Life 2: Deathmatch\"] produces.\"\n\nMultiple reviews stated that the game suffered from large amount of lag upon release, but GameSpy noted that this was remedied soon after as more servers came online.\n"}
{"id": "2169828", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2169828", "title": "Oystermouth Castle", "text": "Oystermouth Castle\n\nOystermouth Castle () is a Norman stone castle in Wales, overlooking Swansea Bay on the east side of the Gower Peninsula near the village of the Mumbles.\n\nThe first castle was founded by William de Londres of Ogmore Castle soon after 1106 following the capture of Gower by the Normans. In 1116 the Welsh of Deheubarth retook the Gower Peninsula and forced William to flee his castle which was put to the torch. The castle was rebuilt soon afterwards, but was probably destroyed again in 1137 when Gower was once more retaken by the princes of Deheubarth. The Londres or London family finally died out in 1215 when Gower was again taken by the Welsh under the leadership of Llywelyn the Great. In 1220 the Welsh were expelled from the peninsula and the government of Henry III of England returned the barony of Gower to John de Braose who rebuilt both Swansea Castle and Oystermouth.\n\nIn the 13th century the Braose family were Lords of Gower and held the castle as part of their extensive land holdings and titles, including other castles on Gower and in the Welsh Marches. The de Braose dynasty could afford to rebuild Oystermouth castle in stone. A high curtain wall was built, internal buildings added, a chapel, basements, three storey residential buildings with fireplaces and garderobes on each floor. The castle had every residential feature necessary for living in some comfort and was also refortified cleverly. Towards the end of the century Oystermouth rather than Swansea Castle became their principal residence. Edward I paid a brief visit here in December 1284.\n\nBy 1331 the Lords of Gower were living elsewhere and the castle declined in importance in the 14th century.\n\nThe daughter of the last de Breos Lord, Aline de Breos, who improved the chapel making it one of the finest in any castle in south Wales, later married John de Mowbray, and the Lordship of Gower including the castle at Oystermouth passed to the de Mowbrays through this marriage, and then to the Herbert family, and finally the Somersets, who became successive Marquis of Worcester and finally Dukes of Beaufort.\n\nAfter the Middle Ages, the castle gradually fell into ruin. A survey of Gower made in 1650 describes Oystermouth Castle as \"[a]n old decayed castle\" of \"no use, but of a very pleasant situation\". It was portrayed in art in the 18th century as a picturesque ruin, and was restored by George Grant Francis in the 1840s while the castle was owned by the then Duke of Beaufort.\n\nIn 1927 the Duke of Beaufort gave the castle to Swansea Corporation; today, the castle is maintained under the responsibility of the City and County of Swansea council.\n\nIn 2009 the National Assembly for Wales announced it was investing £19 million in the country's heritage sites in an attempt to boost tourism. As part of the programme Oystermouth Castle closed in 2010 while it underwent a £1 m refurbishment; it reopened to the public in July the following year.\n\nFollowing the first phase of conservation works Oystermouth Castle reopened to the public in mid July 2011. The scheme includes new visitor facilities, an educational space, improvements to access and a 30-foot high glass viewing platform and bridge that leads to Alina's Chapel.\n\nOn either side of the entrance gate the walls curve inward, showing that at one time there were supposed to be two round towers built into the gatehouse. It is unknown whether these were ever built.\n\nThe chapel (on the second floor of the chapel block) has 14th century traceried windows. According to local tradition the chapel was built under the direction of Aline de Mowbray.\n\nRemnants of an ornate medieval painting dating back to the 14th century have recently been found in the chapel. The surviving painting is thought to be over 700 years old and was spotted during conservation work in the historic attraction's chapel area. Exposure to the elements has taken its toll on the painting over time but expert Cadw analysis suggests it's a double-arched canopy that contains the figures of angels. Some of the clear elements of the painting that remain include a wing with multiple feathers and circular shapes that form a head with yellow hair surrounded by a nimbus. It's thought the painting is both highly important and testimony to the original design of the chapel attributed to Alina de Breos in the early 14th century that once formed part of a larger work of art.\n\nDuring World War II, the Royal Navy operated the naval trawler, HMT \"Oystermouth Castle\".\n\n\nCitations\n\nBibliography\n\n"}

The rebellion takes its name from the African-born slave, Bussa, who led the rebellion which was defeated by British forces. Bussa's Rebellion was the first of three large-scale slave rebellions in the British West Indies that shook public faith in slavery in the years leading up to the abolition of slavery in the British Empire and emancipation of former slaves. It was followed by the large-scale rebellion in Demerara in 1823 and by an even larger rebellion in Jamaica in 1831–32. Collectively these are often referred to as the \"late slave rebellions\". \n\nBussa () was born a free man in West Africa of possible Igbo descent and was captured by African slave merchants, sold to the British, and transported to Barbados (where slavery had been legal since 1661) in the late 18th century as a slave. Not much is known about him and there are no records of him prior to this date. Since slave owners almost never bothered to keep detailed records about the lives of their slaves (who were considered property), virtually no biographical information about Bussa is available. Records show a slave named \"Bussa\" worked as a ranger on \"Bayley's Plantation\" in the parish of Saint Philip around the time of the rebellion. This privileged position would have given Bussa more freedom of movement than the average slave and would have made it easier for him to plan and coordinate the rebellion.\n\nThe revolts arose at a time when the British Parliament was working on schemes to ameliorate the conditions of slaves in the Caribbean. Preparation for this rebellion began soon after the House of Assembly discussed and rejected the Imperial Registry Bill in November 1815, which would have registered colonial slaves. Historians believe that slaves interpreted some of the parliamentary proposals as preparatory to emancipation, and took action when freedom did not take place.\n\nAmong Bussa's collaborators were Washington, Franklin, John and Nanny Grigg, a senior domestic slave, and Jackey on Simmons' Plantation, as well as other slaves, drivers and artisans. Jackey was a Creole driver who was an important figure. The planning was undertaken at a number of sugar estates, including Bailey's plantation, where it began. By February 1816, Bussa was an African driver, one of the few in his position. He and his collaborators decided to start the revolt on 14 April, Easter Sunday.\n\nBussa, King Wiltshire, Dick Bailey, and Johnny led the slaves into battle at Bailey's Plantation on Tuesday, 16 April. He commanded some 400 freedom fighters, both men and women, most of whom were believed to be Creole, born in the islands. He was killed in battle. His forces continued the fight until they were defeated by superior firepower of the colonial militia. The rebellion failed but its influence was significant to the future of Barbados.\n\n\n\n"}

A droop nose is sometimes fitted where a plane has a sharp nose-up attitude for takeoff and landing, and the nose obscures the view of the runway. In this situation the pilot can lower the nose cone to improve visibility. When in flight, the nose is raised. Only a few supersonic delta wing types have had a drooped nose.\n\nThe first supersonic delta to be given a drooped nose was the Fairey FD2 experimental prototype, which in 1956 became the first aircraft to exceed . When one was converted into the BAC 221 as a testbed for the Concorde ogival wing shape, the droop nose was carried over.\n\nConcorde also has a transparent protective visor over the cockpit windshield, which slid down into the nose as it was lowered. The nose could be drooped to one of two positions; 5 degrees for taxiing and for take-off, and the fully drooped 12.5 degree position used during landing. The nose and visor were hydraulically operated via a small lever on the co-pilot's side of the cockpit. There was also a standby droop system if the main system failed, operated from the cockpit centre console, and as a last resort if both hydraulic systems failed, a lever could be pulled in the cockpit which released the mechanical latches, allowing the nose to fall under gravity to the 12.5 degree position. The droop mechanism was designed and manufactured under sub contract by Marshall Aerospace in Cambridge, UK, by a team led by Norman Harry OBE.\nThe Tupolev Tu-144, the Soviet counterpart to Concorde, also has a droop nose, although its visor is fixed to the nose and did not retract.\n\nThe Soviet Sukhoi T-4 prototype Mach 3 strategic bomber, the Soviet counterpart to the North American XB-70 Valkyrie, had a droop nose which completely covered the cockpit windscreen when raised, and a periscope was provided for forward vision.\n\n"}

He served in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1943 to 1945. Elected as a member of the Manitoba Cooperative Commonwealth Federation, Johnson had a tenuous relationship with the party leadership and was expelled from the party caucus in 1945. After leaving the legislature, he became a member of the communist Labor-Progressive Party.\n\nJohnson was born in Rapid City, Manitoba. His ancestors had moved from Pennsylvania to Ontario in the late eighteenth century. Many were Quakers, and almost all were farmers. He was educated in Rapid City, and at the Brandon Normal School, Brandon College and the Manitoba Medical College. He received a degree in medicine in 1926.\n\nHe served in the ranks of the 27th Battalion during World War I, and was awarded a Military Medal and recommended for a commission. From 1926 to 1931, he served in the Philippines as a hospital superintendent. On returning to Manitoba, he served on the Brandon School Board and the Brandon Health Unit from 1937 to 1943.\n\nJohnson became politically active during this period. He was a member of the Brandon Reconstruction Club in the 1930s, a local division of the Canadian League for Social Reconstruction. In 1936, he became a vice-president of the Brandon CCF club. Johnson was a vocal proponent of socialism, and criticized others in the party who were reluctant to use the term openly.\n\nHe was elected to the Manitoba legislature in a by-election held in the Brandon constituency on November 18, 1943. Along with Beresford Richards, who had been elected for The Pas earlier in the year, he soon became a prominent figure on the party's left-wing. The CCF was the official opposition party during this period, and Johnson distinguished himself in the legislature as his party's health and welfare critic.\n\nSince the 1930s, Johnson had called for cooperation among Canada's left-wing parties. In 1945, this position caused both Johnson and Richards to be expelled from the CCF caucus. Johnson and Richards argued that the CCF should promote friendly relations with the Soviet Union after World War II, and should seek cooperation with other progressive and working-class parties to prevent the Conservatives from returning to power at the federal level. This strategy of cooperation was identical to that favoured by the Labor-Progressive Party in 1945. Many in the CCF believed Johnson and Richards were directly influenced by the LPP, and accused them of disrupting the party. After Richards made their position public in a speech to the legislature, the provincial CCF council suspended both MLAs from the party.\n\nJohnson and Richards sat in the legislature as independent members, and sought re-election as \"Independent CCF\" candidates in the 1945 provincial election. Richards was re-elected, and later returned to the CCF fold. Johnson faced opposition from an official CCF candidate, however, and finished third. The winner in Brandon was Leslie McDorman from the Liberal-Progressive party. Johnson appealed for reinstatement to the CCF after the election, but was rejected at the party's December 1945 convention.\n\nUnlike Richards, whose motivations in 1945 have been described as \"naive and confused\", Johnson's personal philosophy had shifted to Marxism by this period. He joined the Labor-Progressive Party a few years after his expulsion from the CCF. In 1949, he accused social democratic parties such as the CCF of being traitors to the working-class and of propping up the existing capitalist order.\n\nJohnson ran as an independent candidate in the riding of Brandon in the 1949 federal election. Neither the CCF nor the LPP endorsed an official candidate, leaving Johnson as the \"de facto\" candidate of a united left. He finished a distant third, behind Liberal James Ewen Matthews . Johnson later attended the Asia and Pacific Rim Peace Conference in the People's Republic of China in 1952, during the period of the Korean War.\n"}

It has 18,033 inhabitants (2016) and covers an area of 44 km². It is easily reached by the A 92 autobahn and regional trains on the Munich–Regensburg line. Furthermore, it takes just 10 minutes to get to Munich airport.\n\nMoosburg is popular with commuters who travel to Munich, Freising, and Munich airport. There is considerable industry in the town consisting of chemical, electro-technical, food processing, and machine-building plants.\n\nThere was a Benedictine abbey in Moosburg in the 8th century: a cluster of dwellings and artisans sprang up around it. Duke Heinrich der Löwe started the construction of the Kastulus Minster (cathedral) in 1171, dedicated to Saint Castulus – whose supposed relics were brought to the city. In the 12th century, a town was established and received its first charter in 1311. The walls and moat were completed in the 15th century. The town reached its peak during the early part of the 16th century. In 1599, the Benedictines moved to Landshut, reducing Moosburg's importance.\n\nSieges and plundering during the Thirty Year War started the decline of the town. In 1702, a fire reduced half the buildings to ashes. Moosburg suffered further depredation during the War of the Austrian Succession and the Napoleonic Wars. Another disastrous fire in 1865 resulted in the downtown area being redeveloped in the style of the late 19th century.\n\nDuring the 1920s and 1930s, new industries revived the town. In September 1939, a prisoner of war camp Stalag VII-A was built to accommodate 10,000. By early 1945, the number of registered prisoners had grown to more than 70,000—including many in associated labor camps. It is likely that the presence of this camp close to the town center spared it from large-scale bombing.\n\nAfter the liberation of the camp by the Americans at the end of April 1945, it was turned into Civilian Internment Camp #6 for 12,000 German men and women suspected of criminal activity for the Nazi regime. From 1948, the camp served to house German refugees exiled from Eastern Europe. It became a new part of the town, named \"Moosburg-Neustadt\".\n\nThe main altar of the Kastulus Minster is the principal masterpiece of the wood sculptor Hans Leinberger of Landshut. Originally, the altar was a triptych in which the side panels could be swiveled inward to close the altar. Today, the side panels hang above the choir stalls.\n\nThe Romanesque-style west doorway of the Minster was actually built in the 19th century.\n\nThe Baroque facades that survived the 1865 fire can be seen at the east end of Herrnstrasse, for instance, the red front of the chemist's shop.\n\nThe memorial to inmates of Stalag VII-A is a fountain in the center of \"Neustadt\". It consists of four bas-reliefs created out of local stone by the French sculptor Antoniucci Volti while he was a prisoner in the camp.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2169886", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2169886", "title": "Executive Action (film)", "text": "Executive Action (film)\n\nExecutive Action is a 1973 American conspiracy thriller film about the assassination of United States President John F. Kennedy, written by Dalton Trumbo, Mark Lane, and Donald Freed, and directed by David Miller. It stars Burt Lancaster and Robert Ryan. Miller had previously worked with Trumbo on his film \"Lonely Are the Brave\" (1962).\n\nA narrator states that, when asked about the Kennedy Assassination and the Warren Commission report, United States President Lyndon B. Johnson said he doubted the Commission's findings. The narration ends by mentioning that the segment did not run on television, and was cut from a program about Johnson at his own request.\n\nAt a gathering in June 1963, shadowy industrial, political and US intelligence figures discuss their growing dissatisfaction with the Kennedy administration. In the plush home of lead conspirator Robert Foster, he and the others try to persuade Harold Ferguson, a powerful oil magnate dressed in white, to back their plans for Kennedy's assassination. Fellow conspirator James Farrington, a black-ops specialist, labels this as \"executive action\". He shows the group that magnicide is indeed a viable option. He refers to the Lincoln, Garfield, and McKinley assassinations as examples, as well as unsuccessful attempts including against Franklin Roosevelt in 1933. He explains these attempts were carried out by alleged lone fanatics; later scenes show the grooming process unwittingly undergone by Lee Harvey Oswald to fulfill precisely that role in the present conspiracy.\n\nFerguson remains unconvinced, saying such schemes are \"only tolerable when necessary, and only permissible when they work\". Obtaining his approval is crucial to the conspirators, although Farrington proceeds to organize two shooting teams in anticipation that Ferguson will change his mind. One of the teams is shown during practice in the Mojave Desert, shooting moving targets at medium-to-long range. One of the shooters says that he can only guarantee the operation's success if he fires at a target moving below 15 miles per hour. \n\nAfter one of their meetings, Foster and Farrington discuss their murky, paranoid fears about the future of the country under Kennedy, and the security of ruling-class white people across the globe. They both seem privy to plans known to the CIA that Ferguson, a civilian, is perhaps unaware of. Foster forecasts the world population in 2000 at seven billion, most of them non-white and \"[swarming] out of their breeding grounds into Europe and North America\". He sees victory in Vietnam as an opportunity to control the developing world and reduce its population to 550 million, ominously adding \"I know; I've seen the data\". He also states that the same methods can then be applied to unwanted groups in the United States: Asians, blacks, Latinos, poor whites, etc. \nFerguson watches news reports and becomes highly concerned at Kennedy's increasingly liberal direction: action on civil rights, adoption of the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, and nuclear disarmament. The decisive moment comes in an anti-Kennedy news report on the deteriorating situation in South Vietnam. It is followed by Kennedy's October 1963 decision (National Security Action Memorandum #263) to withdraw all US advisers from Vietnam by the end of 1965, effectively ending America's direct involvement in the Vietnam War. Ferguson calls Foster and tells him he now supports their project.\n\nThe scene of the shooting is described. As news of the assassination reaches the conspirators, the film surveys its effects. The shooters leave Dallas and the conspirators work to cover up the evidence. Farrington and his assistant Tim discuss the inconvenience of Oswald's survival. Tim approaches nightclub owner Jack Ruby, who stalks and kills Oswald. The plotters discuss the political fallout in Washington, D.C., concerned about retribution from Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy and the believability of the plot. Foster states that \"Bobby Kennedy is not thinking as Attorney General but as a grieving brother. By the time he recovers it will be too late\". The conspirators agree that people will believe in the story because \"they want to\". Soon after, Foster receives a call from Farrington's assistant: Farrington has died of a heart attack at Parkland Hospital. The conspirators are now insulated from the link to the group that committed the killings.\n\nTheir work is not quite finished. A photo collage of 18 material witnesses is shown, all but two of whom, the film states, died of unnatural causes within three years of the assassination. A voice-over says that an actuary of the British newspaper \"The Sunday Times\" calculated the probability that all these people who witnessed the assassination would die within that period of time to be 100,000-trillion-to-one.\n\n\nThe actor Donald Sutherland has been credited as having conceived of the film, and for hiring Lane and Freed to write the screenplay. Sutherland had planned to act in and produce \"Executive Action\", but abandoned the project after failing to obtain financing, and took a role in another film. \"Executive Action\" was Robert Ryan's final film: He died of cancer four months before its release. Steve Jaffe, former DA Jim Garrison's investigator, was the film's technical consultant and supervising producer.\n\nThe film's musical score was composed by Randy Edelman.\n\nReleased two weeks before the tenth anniversary of Kennedy's assassination, \"Executive Action\" opened to a storm of controversy about the events it depicts, and was consequently pulled from many theaters in its first few weeks. Many television stations also refused to run trailers for the film, among them WNBC-TV in New York City.\n\nBesides the negative press, the film was also generally panned. Pauline Kael called it a \"feeble, insensitive fictionalization...It's a dodo-bird of a movie, the winner of the \"Tora! Tora! Tora!\" prize in miniature. With matchlessly dull performances.\" Leonard Maltin declared the film a \"bomb\" in his \"Movie Guide\", calling it an \"excruciatingly dull thriller [that] promised to clear the air about JFK's assassination but was more successful at clearing theaters.\"\n\nIn contrast, \"The New York Times\" gave it a positive review, its critic Nora Sayre writing that the film \"offers a tactful, low-key blend of fact and invention. The film makers do not insist that they have solved John Kennedy's murder; instead, they simply evoke what might have happened...The film's sternest and strongest point is that only a crazed person acting on his own would have been acceptable to the American public — which, at that time, certainly did not want to believe in a conspiracy.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Roger Ebert was equivocal, giving the film two stars and calling it \"a dramatized rewrite of all those old assassination conspiracy books.\" Ebert stated \"There’s something exploitative and unseemly in the way this movie takes the real blood and anguish and fits it neatly into a semi-documentary thriller.\" He added that \"\"Executive Action\" doesn't seem much to want to entertain\" and called Miller's direction \"colorless\". Ebert continued, saying that the film \"borrows from actual newsreel footage of Kennedy, Oswald and Jack Ruby for most of its power. And it does have power, make no mistake. It has the power of evoking what will probably remain, for most of us, the most stunning public moment of our lives: the moment when we first learned that the President had been shot\".\n\nAt least five other American films dramatize the Kennedy assassination as a conspiracy; \"Executive Action\" sits alongside Oliver Stone's \"JFK\" (1991); John MacKenzie's \"Ruby\" (1992); the 1984 William Tannen film \"Flashpoint\"; and Neil Burger's 2002 pseudo-documentary \"Interview with the Assassin\".\n\nDespite many similarities with the plot of \"JFK\", \"Executive Action\" presents a far more direct and unemotional account of its own touted conspiracy than does Stone's film. \"Executive Action\" is directed in an almost documentary style, and was filmed on a small budget—despite the presence of two big Hollywood names, Robert Ryan and Burt Lancaster. Furthermore, the story is told entirely from the perspective of the conspirators.\n\n\"Executive Action\" was released on DVD on October 23, 2007 in the United States and Canada. It is now available for online viewing through \nAmazon.com Prime Video, Apple's iTunes store's downloadable application and online also through Vudu, Google Play and YouTube for both download and/or streaming video rentals.\n\n"}
{"id": "2169888", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2169888", "title": "Oxwich Castle", "text": "Oxwich Castle\n\nOxwich Castle () is a Grade I listed castle which occupies a position on a wooded headland overlooking Oxwich Bay on the Gower Peninsula, Wales. Although it may occupy the site of an earlier fortification, it is a castle in name only as it is a grand Tudor fortified manor house built in courtyard style.\n\nA charter of 1306 granted in Swansea refers to tenants of \"the ancient knight's fees\" (that is, military tenants) at Oxwich, and this indicates that there may have been some fortifications on the site before the present castle. At this time Oxwich was owned by the de Penres family, who had been in possession since the 1230s. However, with the exception of a ruined tower to the north-east of the castle, which may predate the Tudor building, (and may be the \"\"castrum de Oxenwych\"\" mentioned in a document of 1459) nothing remains of any earlier works.\n\nThe existing buildings were largely created in the 16th century. They consist of a Gateway (built 1520–1538) leading to a courtyard, a Hall at the east of the courtyard opposite the Gateway (1559–1580) and a South Range (1520–38). At the corner of the Hall and the South Range is the six-story South-East Tower. To the north-east of the Castle are the remains of a large stone dovecote.\n\nThe Gateway is surmounted by a plaque with the coats of arms of the Mansell family and the Penrice and Scurlage families to which Sir Rhys was related. The East Range carried a large Hall, and, with the South-East Tower to which it was connected, provided extensive accommodation. It is possible that the construction of this range may have led to the bankruptcy of its builder, Sir Edward Mansell. The South Range contained a kitchen.\n\nOxwich was originally built by Sir Rice Mansel (d. 1559), who also owned Old Beaupre Castle. The structure was built over the original ruined castle, the residence of the Norman de la Mare family during the 13th and 14th century. His son, Sir Edward Mansel (d. 1595) succeeded to the property and between 1560–80 created a much grander structure, called the Great House, capable of housing a large number of guests and retainers. It was a leading example in Wales of the Elizabethan prodigy house. By 1632 however the Castle was already leased out by the Mansell family. Parts of the building collapsed in the eighteenth century. Following this, parts of the South Range were rebuilt and it continued to be used as a farmhouse into the 20th century. In 1949 the Castle was threatened with demolition but was saved and given to the State. The building is now in the care of Cadw.\n\nDuring maintenance works at the Castle in 1968, a gold brooch was discovered by Cyril Grove, which is a rare fine example of medieval British jewellery. The brooch is in the form of a gold ring with mounts, of the period 1320–1340, two inches in diameter. It is set with three rubies and three cameos; it is believed that the cameos were added at a later date and that the brooch may have originally contained sapphires. It may once have been part of the treasure of Edward II or an heirloom of the Mansel family. The brooch is now on display at the National Museum Cardiff.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2169892", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2169892", "title": "Assabet River", "text": "Assabet River\n\nThe Assabet River is a small river about west of Boston, Massachusetts, United States. The river is long. OARS: the Organization for the Assabet, Sudbury and Concord Rivers, headquartered in West Concord, Massachusetts, is a non-profit organization dedicated to the preservation, protection, and enhancement of the natural and recreational features of these three rivers and their watershed. The Assabet and Sudbury Rivers merge in Concord to become the Concord River.\n\nThe river has had many variations of the same name over the centuries, without anyone knowing for sure what it means. Some traditional meanings are associated with the place. \"Assabet\" is said to come from the Algonquian word for \"the place where materials for making fish nets comes from.\" Other traditional meanings are \"at the miry place\" or \"it is miry.\" It is also possible to decode this name in the southern New England branch of Algonquian, spoken by the Nipmuc, Native Americans who once fished there. The name is segmented assa-pe-t from \"assa\", \"turn back\", \"pe\", a short form of \"nippe\", \"water\", used in compounds, and a locative suffix, -t, a shorter form of -et after the vowel. The meaning would be \"at the place where the river turns back.\" During floods the Assabet River reaches peak height sooner than the Sudbury River, so that at the junction of the two rivers the Sudbury's direction of flow can be temporarily reversed. A counter-argument is that the name was a corrupted spelling of Elizabeth. On various historic maps and documents the name has been spelled as Asibath, Assabeth, Asabett, Assabet, Elizbeth, Elizabet, Elizabeth, and Isabaeth. The form of spelling was not uniform until at least 1850. Historic maps up to 1830 are mostly showing Elizabeth River, but by 1856, consistently Assabet River. In present-day Stow, the Elizabeth Brook flows into the Assabet River.\n\nThe Assabet rises at a swampy area in Westborough and flows northeast , starting at an elevation of and descending through the towns of Northborough, Marlborough, Berlin, Hudson, Stow, Maynard, Acton, and finally Concord, where it merges () with the Sudbury River at Egg Rock to form the Concord River, at an elevation of 100 ft (30 m).\n\nAs of 2017 there are nine dams on the Assabet River. Seven were built to power mills. Present-day names: Aluminum City, Allen Street, Hudson, Gleasondale, Ben Smith, Powdermill and Damonmill/Westvale. Two are modern dams for flood control: Nichols and Tyler. The Damonmill Dam is partially breached, so it does not retain water, although it slows flow at flood times. A tenth mill dam, the Paper Mill Dam, in Maynard, was destroyed by the 1927 flood. As of 2017, 39 road bridges, two Assabet River Rail Trail bridges, one abandoned railroad bridge (Hudson) and one active railroad bridge (Concord) cross the river. Its watershed covers . The Assabet marshes in Stow total about , and the Assabet River National Wildlife Refuge and environs in Stow, Maynard, Sudbury, and Marlborough total about .\n\nThe Powdermill dam was constructed for the American Powder Mills complex of 40 buildings on along both sides of the river through the towns of Acton, Concord, Maynard and Sudbury. These buildings were used for manufacture of gunpowder from 1835 to 1940. Evidence of the 23 recorded explosions during that period remains at a few locations along the river. This dam is owned by Acton Hydro Company Inc., which is in the process of renovating the hydropower facility in order to generate electricity. None of the other historic mill dams have any current function.\n\nNathaniel Hawthorne wrote in its praise: \"Rowing our boat against the current, between wide meadows, we turn aside into the Assabeth. A more lovely stream than this, for a mile above its junction with the Concord, has never flowed on earth.\"\n\nHenry David Thoreau often took his students, including Louisa May Alcott on educational boat trips up the Assabet River,\" and he wrote a poem entitled \"The Assabet\" to a love interest stating: \"Up this pleasant stream let's row, For the livelong summer's day, Sprinkling foam where'er we go, In wreaths as white as driven snow\".\n\nAccording to U.S. Geological Survey records the average flow at the gauge in Maynard is per second. February, March and April average > per second. July, August and September average <100 cfs, with weeks at a time < per second. Five municipal wastewater treatment plants discharge cleaned water into the Assabet River (three upstream of the Maynard gauge). In summer months this cumulative contribution of more than per day (roughly per second) can be more than half of the river's total volume.\n\nThe official designation of major flooding on the Assabet River is a water depth of more than seven feet and a flow rate of 2,300 cfs at the gauge maintained by the U.S. Geological Survey on a site in the river behind McDonald's Restaurant. The gauge site is downstream of 114 of the 177 square miles making up the Assabet River drainage. Major tributaries below the gauge, which can contribute to downstream flooding, are Fort Pond, Spence and Nashoba Brooks.\n\n1927: According to the National Weather Service, “The 1927 hurricane season brought a tropical storm that swept northward across western New England on Nov. 3-4, 1927. As its warm, humid air rose over the mountains and hills, torrential rains fell, causing severe flooding over extensive areas in virtually all of northern New England and the upper Hudson basin in New York. Much of New England had been soaked by rains throughout October. In all, 85 people were lost.” Locally, the November 11, 1927 issue of The Maynard News reported bridges damaged and water flooding the Mill buildings closest to the river, and also the gunpowder factory a bit further east on Powdermill Road (Route 62). The Waltham Street Bridge situated next to what is now Tedeschi Food Mart, Maynard, had been built in 1840, then widened to add an electric trolley track and sidewalk in 1900. It was destroyed by the flood. A new bridge was installed in 1928, since replaced in 2013.\n\n1936: “The Great Flood” was described as the worst flood in New England since 1850. Damage in Massachusetts was estimated at in excess of $200,000,000. In today’s dollars that would have been billions. The winter of 1935-36 had been hard, with deep snowfalls and long cold snaps that turned streams and rivers to solid ice. Spring came early, with mild weather and heavy rain. By mid-March, rivers were rising across the state. Locally, bridges were damaged and roads washed out.\n\n1955: From a Maynard resident “In August of 1955 my parents brought me to see water flowing over the bridge. We stood on the south side, on Waltham Street.” The high water crest of 8.94 feet from Hurricane Diane was the highest the river has been since record keeping began in 1942.\n\n1968 and 1979: These were the first major floods after two flood control dams were built upstream. Both peaked at 8.1 feet at the gauge. In Maynard, the first put water over the retaining wall next to the mill buildings, necessitating sandbagging and pumping to save factory equipment belonging to Digital Equipment Corporation, which owned the entire mill building complex at the time. The equally high water of January 1979 did not get into the mill because Digital had built the wall higher – on its side. Walnut Street was again under water, and AT&T was sandbagging its building on the Walnut Street side.\n\nFlood control: Three major and eight minor flood control sites hold back high water in times of floods. The George H. Nichols Dam was built in Westborough in 1968, the Tyler Dam in Marlborough in 1965 and the Delaney Complex (on the Elizabeth Brook tributary) in Stow in 1971. The minor sites are on other tributary brooks. Collectively, these have a flood hold-back capacity in excess of 3.5 trillion gallons. The Nichols Dam also serves as a water-providing reserve in times of low water, to help maintain some flow in the river. The two most recent major floods were in 1987 and 2010; for both, water level at the gauge peaked at 7.1 feet, and volume was 2,500 cubic feet per second.\n\nWater caltrop, more commonly known as water chestnut, species \"Trapas natans\", is an invasive waterplant from western Asia. The initial introductions in the U.S. were in the 1870s in Cambridge, MA, followed by deliberate introduction into ponds near the Concord and Sudbury Rivers. This is now an invasive, habitat-destroying plant across many of the eastern states. On the Assabet River, OARS (Organization for the Assabet, Sudbury and Concord Rivers) organizes an annual plant pulling event in early July. Volunteers in canoes hand-pull the surface-floating rosettes of leaves and nuts before the nuts mature and fall to the bottom.\n\nAlewife, \"Alosa pseudoharengus\" is an anadromous species of herring found in North America, anadromous meaning that it mates and is born in fresh water, but live most of its life in saltwater. In pre-Colonial and early Colonial times, alewife swam from the Atlantic Ocean upstream into the Merrimack, and then the Concord and then the Assabet and Sudbury Rivers for the spring mating season. The Industrial Age brought dams to the rivers in order to power mills. Because access to the upper reaches of the rivers was denied the alewives became locally extinct.\n\nBeaver, \"Castor Canadensis\", was common in pre-colonial times. The town of Concord was in part started as a trading site between Native Americans and the English colonists. One estimate is that circa 1630, more than 10,000 beaver pelts per year were being taken in land that now makes up Massachusetts and Connecticut. Due to aggressive hunting, beaver were extirpated (regionally extinct) from all of Massachusetts by 1750. Reintroduction to the state started in the west around 1930, then spread east. Beaver now populate the Assabet River watershed to the point that stream culverts under roads need to be periodically cleared of attempts at dams, and trees on land adjacent to the river are downed for food, dam construction and den building. Licensed trappers are hired to remove nuisance beaver families. Where not intruding on human space, beaver improve the local ecology. Dams create wetlands which foster wildlife diversity, contribute water to the underlying aquifers, and combat summer droughts.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2169907", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2169907", "title": "Max Malini", "text": "Max Malini\n\nMax Malini (born Max Katz Breit; 1873 – October 3, 1942) was a magician who at his peak performed for several US Presidents and at Buckingham Palace, receiving gifts from monarchs across Europe and Asia. Many magicians hold him in high esteem for his skill and bold accomplishments.\n\nMax Malini was born in the small town of Ostrow on the borders of Russia and Austria. At a young age, he emigrated to the US with his Jewish family, settling in New York City. He studied juggling at age twelve, but under the tutelage of a fire-eater, ventriloquist, and magician, Professor Seiden, Max began his studies of magic when he was fifteen.\n\nAs he grew older, he began performing in bars. As his reputation grew, he would sell tickets to see a private show in his hotel room. He specialized in close-up magic, performing with coins and card magic.\n\nMalini was part of that rare breed of performer, the itinerant magician, and even rarer breed of magician in that he performed magic based on sleight of hand rather than large illusions. (It made traveling much easier.)\n\nHis performance style was marked by great audacity. For instance, according to magician Paul Daniels in his show \"The Magic of Max Malini,\" Max, speaking in a heavy Yiddish accent, would often walk up to a celebrity and, unannounced, bite a button from their cuff and magically restore it. He would also borrow a gentleman's hat for a coin effect, where he would cover the coin and attempt to make it flip over. This he would fail to do, but would finish by lifting the hat to reveal a block of ice under the hat, barely large enough to fit.\n\nOne of Malini's signature routines was the blindfold card stab, which operated as follows. On a table a pack of cards were mixed and swirled around by a lady from the audience. The audience would blindfold Max with handkerchiefs. Malini then requested the name of a playing card, and when someone called out a card, he would stab a knife into the cards, then raise it up in the air, thereupon it was seen that he had impaled the correct card.\n\nHe died in Honolulu, Hawaii, on October 3, 1942. He had been in poor health for some time and his last performances were done sitting in a chair. Though his cremation was in Hawaii and done by Oahu Cemetery, 2162 Nuuanu Avenue, his ashes were received in Chicago on January 5, 1943, and signed for by Myron Weinstein Brothers Memorial Chapel, 1300 West Devon Avenue, Chicago. His ashes are interred in the Waldheim Jewish Cemetery, 1400 Des Plaines Ave, Forest Park, IL 60130, Gate 47, Lot 137, Section D, Row 11, Grave 6, next to those of his first wife Lizzie Katz.

{"id": "2169914", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2169914", "title": "Eugène Marais", "text": "Eugène Marais\n\nEugène Nielen Marais (; 9 January 1871 – 29 March 1936) was a South African lawyer, naturalist, poet and writer. He has been hailed as an intellectual genius and an Afrikaner hero.\n\nMarais was born in Pretoria, the thirteenth and last child of Jan Christiaan Nielen Marais and Catharina Helena Cornelia van Niekerk. He attended school in Pretoria, Boshof and Paarl, and much of his early education was in English, as were his earliest poems. He matriculated at the age of sixteen.\n\nAfter leaving school, he worked in Pretoria as a legal clerk and then as a journalist before becoming owner (at the age of twenty) of a newspaper called \"Land en Volk\" (\"Country and (the Afrikaner) People\"). He involved himself deeply in local politics.\n\nHe began taking opiates at an early age and graduated to morphine (then considered to be non-habit forming and safe) very soon thereafter. He became addicted, and his addiction ruled his affairs and actions to a greater or lesser extent throughout his life. When asked why he took drugs, he variously pleaded ill health, insomnia and, later, the death of his young wife as a result of the birth of his only child. Much later, he blamed accidental addiction while ill with malaria in Mozambique. Some claim his use of drugs was experimental and influenced by the philosophy of de Quincey.\n\nMarais married Aletta Beyers, but she died from puerperal fever a year later, eight days after the birth of their son. Eugène Charles Gerard was Marais' only child.\n\nIn 1897 — still in his mid-twenties – Marais went to London to read medicine. However, under pressure from his friends, he entered the Inner Temple to study law. He qualified as an advocate. When the Boer War broke out in 1899, he was put on parole as an enemy alien in London. During the latter part of the war he joined a German expedition that sought to ship ammunition and medicines to the Boer Commandos via Portuguese East Africa (now Mozambique). However, he was struck down in this tropical area by malaria and, before the supplies could be delivered to the Boers, the war ended.\n\nFrom 1905 Marais studied nature in the Waterberg ('Water mountain'), a wilderness area north of Pretoria, and wrote in his native Afrikaans about the animals he observed. His studies of termites led him to conclude that the colony ought to be considered as a single organism, a prescient insight that predated the elaboration of the idea by Richard Dawkins. In the Waterberg, Marais also studied the black mamba, spitting cobra and puff adder. Moreover, he observed a specific troop of baboons at length, and from these studies there sprang numerous magazine articles and the books \"My Friends the Baboons\" and \"The Soul of the Ape\". He is acknowledged as the father of the scientific study of the behaviour of animals, known as Ethology.\n\nAs the leader of the Second Afrikaans Language Movement, Marais preferred to write in Afrikaans, and his work was translated into various languages either late in his life or after his death. His book \"Die Siel van die Mier\" (\"The Soul of the Ant\", but usually given in English as the \"Soul of the White Ant\") was plagiarised by Nobel laureate Maurice Maeterlinck, who published \"La Vie des Termites\" (translated into English as \"The Life of Termites\" or \"The Life of White Ants\"), an entomological book, in what has been called \"a classic example of academic plagiarism\" by University of London's professor of biology, David Bignell.\n\nMarais accused Maeterlinck of having used his concept of the \"organic unity\" of the termitary in his book. Marais had published his ideas on the termitary in the South African Afrikaans-language press, both in \"Die Burger\" in January 1923 and in \"Huisgenoot\", which featured a series of articles on termites under the title \"Die Siel van die Mier\" (The Soul of the (White) Ant) from 1925 to 1926. Maeterlinck's book, with almost identical content, was published in 1926. It is alleged that Maeterlinck had come across Eugene Marais' series of articles, and that it would have been easy for Maeterlinck to translate from Afrikaans to French, since Maeterlinck knew Dutch and had already made several translations from Dutch into French before. It was common at the time for worthy articles published in Afrikaans to be reproduced in Flemish and Dutch magazines and journals.\n\nMarais sent a letter to Dr. Winifred de Kock in London about Maeterlinck, in which he wrote that The famous author had paid me the left-handed compliment of cribbing the most important part of my work... He clearly desired his readers to infer that he had arrived at certain of my theories (the result of ten years of hard labour in the veld) by his own unaided reason, although he admits that he never saw a termite in his life. You must understand that it was not merely plagiarism of the spirit of a thing, so to speak. He has copied page after page verbally. \n\nSupported by a coterie of Afrikaner Nationalist friends, Marais sought justice through the South African press and attempted an international lawsuit. This was to prove financially impossible and the case was not pursued. However, Marais gained a measure of renown as the aggrieved party and as an Afrikaner researcher who had opened himself up to plagiarism because he published in Afrikaans out of nationalistic loyalty. Marais brooded at the time of the scandal: \"I wonder whether Maeterlinck blushes when he reads such things [critical acclaim], and whether he gives a thought to the injustice he does to the unknown Boer worker?\"\n\nMaeterlinck's own words in \"The Life of Termites\" indicate that the possible discovery or accusation of plagiarism worried him:\n\nIt would have been easy, in regard to every statement, to allow the text to bristle with footnotes and references. In some chapters there is not a sentence but would have clamoured for these; and the letterpress would have been swallowed up by vast masses of comment, like one of those dreadful books we hated so much at school. There is a short bibliography at the end of the volume which will no doubt serve the same purpose.\n\nDespite these misgivings, there is no reference to Eugène Marais in the bibliography. Maeterlinck's other works on entomology include \"The Life of the Ant\" (1930).\n\nProfessor VE d'Assonville wrote about Maeterlinck as \"the Nobel Prize winner who had never seen a termite in his whole life and had never put a foot on the soil of Africa, least of all in the Waterberg.\".\n\nRobert Ardrey, an admirer of Eugène Marais's, attributed Marais' later suicide to this act of plagiarism and theft of intellectual property by Maeterlinck. Ardrey said in his introduction to \"The Soul of the Ape\", published in 1969, that 'As a scientist he was unique, supreme in his time, yet a worker in a science unborn.' He also refers to Marais' work at length in his book \"African Genesis\".\n\nThere is evidence that Marais' time and research in the Waterberg brought him great peace and joy and provided him with artistic inspiration. In the poem \"Waar Tebes in die stil woestyn\", he writes (as translated into English by J. W. Marchant) 'There would I know peace once more, where Tebes in the quiet desert lifts it mighty rockwork on high ...'. (Tebus is one of the principal peaks of the area). That said, Marais was a long-term morphine addict and suffered from melancholy, insomnia, depression and feelings of isolation.\n\nIn 1936, deprived of morphine for some days, he borrowed a shotgun on the pretext of killing a snake and shot himself in the chest. The wound was not fatal, and Marais therefore put the gun barrel in his mouth and pulled the trigger. He did so on the farm Pelindaba, belonging to his friend Gustav Preller. For those who are familiar with the dark moods of certain of Marais' poems, there is a black irony here; in Zulu, Pelindaba means 'the end of the business' – although the more common interpretation is 'Place of great gatherings'.\n\nMarais and his wife Aletta are buried in the Heroes' Acre, Pretoria.\n\nMarais' work as a naturalist, although by no means trivial (he was one of the first scientists to practise ethology and was repeatedly acknowledged as such by Robert Ardrey and others), gained less public attention and appreciation than his contributions as a literalist. He discovered the Waterberg Cycad, which was named after him (\"Encephalartos eugene-maraisii\"). He was the first person to study the behaviour of wild primates, and his observations continue to be cited in contemporary evolutionary biology. He is among the greatest of the Afrikaner poets and remains one of the most popular, although his output was not large. Opperman described him as the first professional Afrikaner poet; Marais believed that craft was as important as inspiration for poetry. Along with J.H.H. de Waal and G.S. Preller, he was a leading light in the Second Afrikaans Language Movement in the period immediately after the Second Boer War, which ended in 1902. Some of his finest poems deal with the wonders of life and nature, but he also wrote about inexorable death. Marais was isolated in some of his beliefs. He was a self-confessed pantheist and claimed that the only time he entered a church was for weddings. An assessment of Marais' status as an Afrikaner hero was published by historian Sandra Swart.\n\nAlthough an Afrikaner patriot, Marais was sympathetic to the cultural values of the black tribal peoples of the Transvaal; this is seen in poems such as \"Die Dans van die Reën\" (The Dance of the Rain). The following translation of Marais' \"Winternag\" is by J. W. Marchant:\n\n\"Winter's Night\"\n\nO the small wind is frigid and spare<br>\nand bright in the dim light and bare<br>\nas wide as God's merciful boon<br>\nthe veld lies in starlight and gloom<br>\nand on the high lands<br>\nspread through burnt bands<br>\nthe grass-seed, astir, is like beckoning hands.<br>\n<br>\nO East-wind gives mournful measure to song<br>\nLike the lilt of a lovelorn lass who's been wronged<br>\nIn every grass fold<br>\nbright dewdrop takes hold<br>\nand promptly pales to frost in the cold!\n\nWhile the above translation is generally faithful, and is a fine poem in English, it does not quite capture the terse directness of the Afrikaans language, which makes Afrikaans poetry so bittersweet and evocative, striking straight to the heart and soul. Below follows a translation by Farrell Hope, which may closer reflect the original Afrikaans idiom. Note the above version by J. W. Marchant, as well as the third version below by At de Lange, both translate the Afrikaans word in the poem \"skade\" (damage) as if it was \"skadu\" (shade). This is a common error in translating the poem and misses the point Marais was making: that the British forces had destroyed the Boer farms.\n\n\"Winternight\"\n\nO cold is the slight wind,\nand keen.\nBare and bright in dim light\nis seen,\nas vast as the graces of God,\nthe veld's starlit and fire-scarred sod.\nTo the high edge of the lands,\nspread through the scorched sands,\nnew seed-grass is stirring\nlike beckoning hands.\n\nO mournful the tune\nof the East-wind refrain,\nlike the song of a girl\nwho loved but in vain.\nOne drop of dew glistens\non each grass-blade's fold\nand fast does it pale\nto frost in the cold!\n\nAn English translation by At de Lange preserves the musicality of the poem quite well:\n\n\"Winter's Night\"\n\nO cold is the windlet\nand spare.\nAnd bright in the dim-light\nand bare,\nas vast as God's mercy has bade,\nlie the plains in starlight and shade.\nAnd high in the ridges,\nspreaded in burnt ditches,\nare the grass plumes stirring\nlike beckoning hands.\n\nO tune with grief laden\non the east wind's drone,\nlike the song of a maiden\nin her love made alone.\nIn each grass blade's fold\na drop of dew gleams bold,\nand it pales quickly\nto frost in the cold!\n\nThis 2012 movie directed by Katinka Heyns explores Marais' convalescence from malaria on a farm in the Waterberg.\n\n\n\nThe progenitors of the Marais name in the region were Charles and Claude Marais, from the Paris region of France. The Marais name has retained its original French spelling and pronunciation in South Africa.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Rex and recently God Head, is a heavy-metal vocalist, musician and producer known primarily for his work with Ulver and Arcturus.\n\nBorn in Oslo but raised in Cascais, Kristoffer Rygg was 16 years old when he formed Ulver, considered one of the most iconoclastic bands from the Norwegian black metal scene. He was an instrumental instigator for later subcategories such as avant-garde metal.\n\nIn addition, he was vocalist for Borknagar (1995–1997) and Arcturus (1993–2003), both of which comprise many eminent musicians from the early Norwegian black metal scene. Rygg was responsible for introducing Borknagar to the singer who replaced him, ICS Vortex, when he resigned from the band.\n\nKristoffer Rygg possesses a wide range of vocal textures and styles, ranging from baritone, countertenor, crooning and even black metal style screaming. He often records multiple tracks of himself to create dense male choirs on albums such as the majority of the vocals on Kveldssanger.\n\nIn 2005, Rygg collaborated with Portuguese musician/producer Daniel Cardoso in the project Head Control System. The music was described by the label as \"groovy rock/metal with progressive edges and cinematic components.\" Their first and only full-length, entitled Murder Nature was released on 4 April 2006 through The End Records.\n\nIn recent years Rygg has been involved in freeform/improvisational project Æthenor which includes notable musicians such as Stephen O'Malley of Sunn O))), Daniel O'Sullivan of Guapo and David Tibet of Current 93. In April 2008 he played five concerts with Æthenor. It was his first time on stage in over a decade. Rygg has since participated in several mini-tours and concerts with Æthenor. Their triple residency at the Oslo jazz club Blå resulted in the much-acclaimed 4th album En Form for Blå.\n\nIn 2009, fifteen years after their only concert back in 1993, he decided to reintroduce Ulver live in concert. The first show was hosted by the Lillehammer Norwegian Literature Festival Norwegian Festival of Literature, and initiated by the late author Stig Sæterbakken. A year later, and after a series of shows around Europe, Rygg stood in front of a full house at the main stage of Oslo's National Opera & Ballet. A DVD/Blu-ray from the event was released commercially, and includes liner notes by Rygg and Sæterbakken.\n\nRygg owns and operates Jester Records, an underground label specializing in experimental music, including Ulver, which has since their early metal days metamorphosed into a musical composite difficult to categorize. He has acted as guest vocalist, lyricist, engineer, producer, remixer etc. for a very large list of other artists, including Alkaline Trio, Mindless Self Indulgence, Genghis Tron, Darkthrone, Mayhem, Emperor, Ihsahn, Dimmu Borgir, The Gathering, Merzbow, Carpenter Brut and Sunn O))) et al.\n\nHe is part of the studio-collective Crystal Canyon in Oslo, and has two children, Leon and Astra.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

For his activities, he earned the nickname \"God's smuggler\". He is known for having prayed \"Lord, make seeing eyes blind\" when he was stopped at the border of a communist country for his car to be inspected.\n\nVan der Bijl was born in Sint Pancras, the Netherlands, the fourth of six children of a poor, near-deaf blacksmith and an invalid mother. He told John and Elizabeth Sherrill, when they transcribed his memories for their book \"God's Smuggler\", \"From the day I first put on wooden shoes – \"klompen\" we call them in Holland – I dreamed of derring-do\".\n\nIn the 1940s, he enlisted in the colonial army of the Dutch East Indies during the rebellion that would eventually form Indonesia, which first adventure initially had unpleasant results; he endured a period of severe emotional stress while he was serving as a soldier. He was wounded in the ankle during the fighting; during his rehabilitation, he read the Bible obsessively, eventually converting to Christianity. Van der Bijl studied at the WEC Missionary Training College in Glasgow, Scotland.\n\nIn July 1955, van der Bijl visited communist Poland \"to see how my brothers are doing\", a reference to the underground church there. He signed up on a government-controlled communist tour, the only legal way to be in the country. During that time, he felt called to respond to the Biblical Commission, \"Wake up, strengthen what remains and is about to die\" (). That was the start of a mission leading him into several communist-ruled countries in which religious belief was actively persecuted.\nIn 1957, he travelled to the Soviet Union’s capital, Moscow, in a Volkswagen Beetle, which later became the symbol of Open Doors, the organization he founded. An older couple, the Whetstras, had given him their new car because they had prayed about it and believed that Andrew would need the car. A man who lived in Amersfoort, Karl de Graaf, claimed that God told him to teach Van der Bijl to drive. Later, when Van der Bijl was in a refugee camp in West Germany, Philip Whetstra called Van der Bijl to come to the Whetstras' new house in Amsterdam. Although Van der Bijl was violating the laws of all of the countries that he visited by bringing religious literature, he often placed the material in view when he was stopped at police checkpoints, as a gesture of his trust in what he believed to be God's protection. That was the realization of his childhood dreams of darings-do.\n\nVan der Bijl visited China in the 1960s, after the Cultural Revolution had created a hostile policy towards Christianity and other religions, during the so-called Bamboo Curtain. He went to Czechoslovakia when the suppression by Soviet troops of the Prague Spring had put an end to relative religious freedom there. He encouraged Czech believers and gave Bibles to the Russian occupying forces. During that decade, he also made his first visits to Cuba after the Cuban Revolution.\n\nIn 1967, he published the first edition of \"God's Smuggler,\" written with John and Elizabeth Sherrill. \"God's Smuggler\" tells the story of his early childhood, conversion to Christianity, and adventures as a Bible-smuggler behind the Iron Curtain. By 2002, it had sold over 10 million copies in thirty-five languages. A comic book adaptation of \"God's Smuggler\" was published in 1972 by Spire Christian Comics.\n\nAfter the fall of communism in Europe, he shifted his focus to the Middle East and has worked to strengthen the church in the Muslim world. In the 1970s, he visited war-torn Lebanon several times, stating that \"global conflict in the end times will focus on Israel and its neighbouring countries.\"\n\nIn the 1990s, van der Bijl again travelled several times more to the Middle East. In his book \"Light Force\", he tells of Arab and Lebanese churches in Lebanon, Israel and Israeli-occupied areas expressing great delight at the mere visit of a fellow Christian from abroad since they felt that the church in the Western world at large was largely ignoring them.\n\nIn similar fashion, van der Bijl and a companion, Al Janssen, visited Hamas and PLO leaders, including Ahmed Yassin and Yasser Arafat, and handed out Bibles.\n\nVan der Bijl's tenth book, \"Secret Believers: What Happens When Muslims Believe in Christ\", was released on 1 July 2007.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2169963", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2169963", "title": "Poland's Wedding to the Sea", "text": "Poland's Wedding to the Sea\n\nPoland's Wedding to the Sea was a ceremony meant to symbolize restored Polish access to the Baltic Sea that was lost in 1793 by the Partitions of Poland. It was first performed on February 10, 1920, by General Józef Haller at Puck (Putzig). In the early spring of 1945, following the Polish-Soviet advance into Pomerania, a number of such ceremonies took place in several locations. The most famous 1945 Weddings to the Sea were performed by the soldiers of the Polish Army on March 17, 1945 in Mrzeżyno (Regamünde), and on March 18 in newly captured port of Kołobrzeg (Kolberg).\n\nIn October 1920, General Jozef Haller was named commandant of the Pomeranian Front of the Polish Army, a unit created to peacefully recover former German Empire's province of Pomerelia, which was granted to the Second Polish Republic by the Versailles Treaty. On 18 January 1920, units of the 16th Infantry Division entered Torun (Thorn), and in the following days, Polish soldiers moved northwards, finally reaching the Baltic Sea coast on February 10. Their progress was slow but steady, with a few incidents of sabotage, carried out by the retreating Germans.\n\nEarly in the morning of February 10, General Haller and his staff, on the way from Torun (Thorn) to Puck, met at Danzig Hbf. rail station with members of Polish community of the Free City of Danzig. Haller, fearing a German provocation, stayed in the train, which was entered by Dr. Jozef Wybicki, grandson of Jozef Wybicki, who handed to him two platinum rings, funded by Polish families of Danzig. One of the rings was later thrown into the sea in Puck.\n\nAfter the meeting, the train with Haller and other Polish officials headed for Puck, where it was welcomed by crowds of Kashubians. At the Puck Rail Station the General mounted a horse, heading towards the sea with a unit of uhlans. The symbolic event was witnessed, among others, by Wincenty Witos, Stanislaw Wojciechowski, Maciej Rataj, Pomeranian Voivode Stefan Laszewski, Polish envoy to Free City of Danzig Maciej Biesiadecki, General Kazimierz Sosnkowski, Dr Jozef Wybicki, and the \"King of the Kashubians, Antoni Abraham\". Main point of the ceremony was marked by a Roman Catholic service, with a sermon told by Reverend Jozef Wrycza. Flag of the Polish Navy was blessed, and then, to the salvo of 21 guns, it was raised on a mast by sailors Eugeniusz Pławski and Florian Napierala. This symbolically meant that from then on, Polish seacoast was guarded by the Navy.\n\nGeneral Haller in his memoirs (published in 1964 in London) wrote that on that day, the Bay of Puck was frozen, so local fishermen cut an ice hole, into which Haller threw the ring. Before it fell into the water, the ring rolled on the ice: \"Several fishermen ran after the ring, but none of them managed to catch it, and it fell into the icy water. When I asked why they did not catch it, the fishermen prophetically answered they would catch it in Szczecin\". After throwing the ring into the water, Haller said the following words: \"In the name of the Holy Republic of Poland, I, General Jozef Haller, am taking control of this ancient Slavic Baltic Sea shore\". Wojciech Kossak, inspired by these events, painted in 1931 \"Polish Wedding to the Sea\".\n\nThe 1920 wedding to the sea took place north of the Port of Puck, in the area which belonged to the Naval Airforce. A commemorative post was later erected there, with a Polish eagle and the date. The post was destroyed during the 1939 German Invasion of Poland. Its replica now stands in the Port of Puck, next to the bust of General Haller.\n\nOn February 11, 1920, a day after the symbolic wedding, Kashubian fishermen invited Haller to Wielka Wies (now Władysławowo), to carry out another ceremony, this time in the open waters of Baltic Sea. Haller accepted the invitation, and entered a cutter \"Gwiazda Morza\" (\"Star of the Sea\"). This made the General a very popular person among the locals. Haller himself purchased a plot of land near Wielka Wies, founding a district called Hallerowo. The town of Władysławowo was created after a merger of Wielka Wies and Hallerowo.\n\nIn the early spring of 1945, a number of symbolic Weddings to the Sea took place along the Baltic Sea coast. The most well-known such ceremonies were on March 17, 1945, at the town of Mrzeżyno (Regamünde), and on March 18 at Kołobrzeg (Kolberg). This is what Polish historian Hieronim Kroczynski wrote in his book \"Polskie tradycje morskie 967-1945\" (\"Polish Naval Traditions 967 - 1945\"):\n\n\"In early 1945, the First Polish Army, formed in the Soviet Union, and subordinated to the Soviet 1st Belorussian Front, reached Pomerania, the ancient land of the Piasts, which was to become Polish again. During the Pomeranian Operation, as our units approached the sea, Polish soldiers remembered the historic 1920 Wedding to the Sea. The 1945 ceremony took place in war situation, as until the end of the war, the 10-kilometer wide strip of coast was officially regarded as frontline. The headquarters of the First Army decided that its units were to organize their own weddings. These ceremonies took place from March 15 to April 6, along the Baltic Sea coast from Dziwnow (Berg Dievenow) to Gdynia (Gdingen). In the spirit of the 1920 tradition, rings were thrown into the water, and oaths of allegiance to the sea were sworn by the participants. Furthermore, in several cases flags of military units were dipped in water. On March 17, 1945, First Warsaw Cavalry Brigade had its own ceremony at Mrzeżyno, and on March 18, main ceremony of both First and Second Army took place at Kołobrzeg\".\n\nPolish historian Hieronim Kroczynski from Kolobrzeg, who has been investigating Polish weddings to the sea says that the first ceremony of this kind in 1945 took place on March 8, near the village of Grzybow, west of Kolobrzeg. On that day, a patrol of the 16th Infantry Regiment reached the shore. Colonel Wladyslaw Jurak, who had been a schoolteacher before the war, told the soldiers about the 1920 wedding, and the group spontaneously decided to repeat the ceremony.\n\nNews of this event reached headquarters of the 6th Infantry Division, to which the 16th Infantry Regiment belonged. Soon, General Michal Rola-Zymierski found out about it, and on March 10, 1945, text of the oath taken during weddings to the sea was printed by a Polish Army newspaper \"Zwyciezymy\": \n\"I swear to you, Polish Sea, that I, a soldier of the Homeland, faithful son of the Polish nation, will not abandon you. I swear to you that I will always follow this road, the road which has been paved by the State National Council, the road which has led me to the sea. I will guard you, I will not hesitate to shed my blood for the Fatherland, neither will I hesitate to give my life so that you do not return to Germany. You will remain Polish forever\".\n\nSoon afterwards, a number of weddings took place: \n\nOn March 17, 1945, two fully armed regiments of uhlans of the First Warsaw Cavalry Brigade stood ready at the main market square at Gryfice (Greifenberg). Following the order of their commandant, Major Stanislaw Arkuszewski, the soldiers headed towards Mrzeżyno, via Trzebiatow (Treptow an der Rega). After reaching the coastline, corporal Sochaczewski and uhlan Kobylinski rode their horses into the water, throwing two rings, which they had received from Major Arkuszewski. At the same time, uhlans of the 2nd and 3rd Regiments said the following words: \"We swear eternal allegiance to the sea\". Some sources claim that the oath was taken only by Major Arkuszewski.\n\nThe tradition of the 1945 wedding is still alive in Mrzeżyno. Every year, patriotic events take place on March 17, and the ceremony is repeated by mounted reenactors, with rings thrown into the sea.\n\nFirst Soviet units appeared in western suburbs of Kołobrzeg (Kolberg) on March 4, 1945. The Battle of Kołobrzeg began on the same day. By March 17, the Germans were pushed back to the beach and the sea, and in the night of March 17/18, the defenders of the city decided to abandon their lines, and evacuate most units to Swinemünde. The ceremony took place on March 18 in the evening. Polish historian Pawel Pawlowski, manager of the Museum of Polish Weapons at Kołobrzeg says that the town was chosen for the main 1945 Wedding to the Sea due to its symbolic importance, as the Germans turned it into a fortress (Festung Kolberg). Furthermore, Nazi propaganda turned the 1807 Siege of Kolberg into a myth, making an expensive film about it.\n\nThe decision about the main Kołobrzeg ceremony was taken on March 18 in the morning, after the hostilities had ended. On the same day in the evening, soldiers of the 7th Infantry Regiment of the First Polish Army were to take part in the wedding, which was organized by Colonel Piotr Jaroszewicz, who later became the Prime Minister of Poland. The ceremony began at 4 p.m. Central European Time, or at 6 p.m. Moscow Time, which was used by Soviet forces and Communist Polish troops. At this hour, some 200-300 soldiers of the 7th Regiment stood by the ruins of a fort near the entrance to the Port of Kołobrzeg. Specially constructed stand was filled with political officers, while the nearby lighthouse was in ruins, blown up by German engineers. The evening was cloudy, and soon it became to get dark. The ceremony began with a Roman Catholic service, then Polish national flag was raised, followed by a speech of Major Stanislaw Russijan, commandant of the 7th Regiment. The orchestra played Polish anthem, and another speech was given by Jaroszewicz, who said, among others:\n\n\"Remember this day, as it is history. Future generations will talk about this event with respect, like we talk about our great ancestors. You are creating history, like once it was created by Boleslaw Chrobry and Wladyslaw Krzywousty. You have gone the right way, from the Oka river to the Baltic, you have not chosen the wrong way, through the sands of Iran, and the swamps of Italy. That is why you have captured Kołobrzeg\".\n\nThe ring was thrown into the sea by Corporal Franciszek Niewidziajlo, who himself was born in Kresy, near Zbaraz. Niewidziajlo also gave a speech, saying: \"We have come here, to the Sea, after a hard and bloody effort. We see that our effort has not been wasted. We swear that we will never leave you. By throwing this ring into your waves, I am marrying you, because you have always been and always be ours\".\n\n\n"}

The conquest resulted in the destruction of the Visigothic Kingdom and the establishment of the independent Emirate of Córdoba under Abd al-Rahman I (ruled 756–788), who completed the unification of the Muslim-ruled areas (known as al-Andalus). The conquest marks the westernmost expansion of both the Umayyad Caliphate and Muslim rule into Europe.\n\nDuring the caliphate of the Umayyad Caliph Al-Walid I, forces led by Tariq ibn Ziyad disembarked in early 711 in Gibraltar at the head of an army consisting of Berbers from north Africa. After defeating the Visigothic usurper Roderic at the decisive Battle of Guadalete, Tariq was reinforced by an Arab force led by his superior \"wali\" Musa ibn Nusayr and continued northward. By 717, the combined Arab-Berber force had crossed the Pyrenees into Septimania. They occupied further territory in Gaul until 759.\n\nThe historian al-Tabari transmits a tradition attributed to the Caliph Uthman who stated that the road to Constantinople was through Hispania, \"Only through Spain can Constantinople be conquered. If you conquer (Spain) you will share the reward of those who conquer (Constantinople).\" The conquest of Hispania followed the conquest of the Maghreb. Walter Kaegi says Tabari's tradition is dubious, arguing that conquest of the far western reaches of the Mediterranean Sea was motivated by military, political and religious opportunities. He considers that it was not a shift in direction due to the Muslims failing to conquer Constantinople in 678. \n\nHistorian Jessica Coope of University of Nebraska argues that the pre-modern Islamic conquest was unlike Christianization because the latter was \"imposed on everyone as part of a negotiated surrender, and thus lacked the element of personal conviction that modern ideas about religious faith would require\" while conquest of \"dar al-harb\" was not motivated by a goal of converting the population to Islam, but by the belief that everyone was better off under Islamic rule.\n\nPrecisely what happened in Iberia in the early 8th century is uncertain. There is one contemporary Christian source, the \"Chronicle of 754\" (which ends on that date), regarded as reliable but often vague. There are no contemporary Muslim accounts, and later Muslim compilations, such as that of Al-Maqqari from the 17th century, reflect later ideological influence. This paucity of early sources means that detailed specific claims need to be regarded with caution.\n\nThe Umayyads took control of Hispania from the Visigoths, who had ruled for roughly three hundred years. At the time of the conquest, the Visigothic upper class was beginning to fracture, and had many problems with succession and maintaining power. This was partially due to the fact that the Visigoths were only 1-2% of the population, which made it difficult to maintain control over rebelling populations. The ruler at the time was King Roderic, though this is somewhat contentious.\n\nThe manner of King Roderic's ascent to the throne is unclear; there are accounts of a dispute with Achila II, son of his predecessor Wittiza. Later regnal lists, which cite Achila and omit Roderic, are consistent with the contemporary account of civil war. Numismatic evidence suggests a division of royal authority, with several coinages being struck, and that Achila II remained king of the Tarraconsense (the Ebro basin) and Septimania until circa 713. The nearly contemporary \"Chronicle of 754\" describes Roderic as a usurper who earned the allegiance of other Goths by deception, while the less reliable late-ninth century \"Chronicle of Alfonso III\" shows a clear hostility towards Oppa, bishop of Seville (or Toledo) and probably a brother of Wittiza, who appears in an unlikely heroic dialogue with Pelagius.\n\nThere is also a story of one Julian, count of Ceuta, whose wife or daughter was raped by Roderic and who sought help from Tangier. However, these stories are not included in the earliest accounts of the conquest.\n\nAccording to the later chronicler Ibn Abd al-Hakam, the Tangier governor Tariq ibn Ziyad led a raiding force approximately 1,700 men strong from North Africa to southern Spain in 711. However, 12,000 seems a more accurate figure. Ibn Abd al-Hakam reports, one and a half centuries later, that \"the people of Andalus did not observe them, thinking that the vessels crossing and recrossing were similar to the trading vessels which for their benefit plied backwards and forwards\". They defeated the Visigothic army, led by King Roderic, in a decisive battle at Guadalete in 712. Tariq's forces were then reinforced by those of his superior, the wali Musa ibn Nusayr, and both took control of most of Iberia with an army estimated at 10,000–15,000 combatants.\n\nAccording to the Muslim historian Al-Tabari, Iberia was first invaded some sixty years earlier during the caliphate of Uthman (Rashidun era). Another prominent Muslim historian of the 13th century, Ibn Kathir, quoted the same narration, pointing to a campaign led by Abd Allah bin Nafi al Husayn and Abd Allah bin Nafi al Abd al Qays in 32 AH. However, this putative invasion is not accepted by modern historians.\n\nThe first expedition led by Tariq was made up mainly of Berbers who had themselves only recently come under Muslim influence. It is probable that this army represented a continuation of a historic pattern of large-scale raids into Iberia dating to the pre–Islamic period, and hence it has been suggested that actual conquest was not originally planned. Both the \"Chronicle of 754\" and later Muslim sources speak of raiding activity in previous years, and Tariq's army may have been present for some time before the decisive battle. It has been argued that this possibility is supported by the fact that the army was led by a Berber and that Musa, who was the Umayyad Governor of North Africa, only arrived the following year – the governor had not stooped to lead a mere raid, but hurried across once the unexpected triumph became clear. The historian Abd al-Wāḥid Dhannūn Ṭāhā mentions that several Arab-Muslim writers mention the fact that Tariq has decided to cross the strait without informing his superior and wali Musa. The Chronicle of 754 states that many townspeople fled to the hills rather than defend their cities, which might support the view that this was expected to be a temporary raid rather than a permanent change of government.\n\nThe Chronicle of 754 stated that \"the entire army of the Goths, which had come with him [Roderic] fraudulently and in rivalry out of hopes of the Kingship, fled\". This is the only contemporary account of the battle and the paucity of detail led many later historians to invent their own. The location of the battle is not totally clear but was probably the Guadalete River.\n\nRoderic was believed to have been killed, and a crushing defeat would have left the Visigoths largely leaderless and disorganized, partly because the ruling Visigoth population is estimated to have been a mere 1 to 2% of the total population. While this isolation is said to have been \"a reasonably strong and effective instrument of government\"; it was highly \"centralised to the extent that the defeat of the royal army left the entire land open to the invaders\". The resulting power vacuum, which may have indeed caught Tariq completely by surprise, would have aided the Muslim conquest immensely. It may have been equally welcome to the Hispano-Roman peasants who were probably – as D.W. Lomax claims – disillusioned by the prominent legal, linguistic and social divide between them and the \"barbaric\" and \"decadent\" Visigoth royal family.\n\nIn 714, Musa ibn Nusayr headed north-west up the Ebro river to overrun the western Basque regions and the Cantabrian mountains all the way to Gallaecia, with no relevant or attested opposition. During the period of the second (or first, depending on the sources) Arab governor Abd al-Aziz ibn Musa (714–716), the principal urban centres of Catalonia surrendered. In 714, his father, Musa ibn Nusayr, advanced and overran Soria, the western Basque regions, Palencia, and as far west as Gijón or León, where a Berber governor was appointed with no recorded opposition. The northern areas of Iberia drew little attention to the conquerors and were hard to defend when taken. The high western and central sub-Pyrenean valleys remained unconquered.\n\nAt this time, Umayyad troops reached Pamplona, and the Basque town submitted after a compromise was brokered with Arab commanders to respect the town and its inhabitants, a practice that was common in many towns of the Iberian Peninsula. The Umayyad troops met little resistance. Considering that era's communication capabilities, three years was a reasonable time spent almost reaching the Pyrenees, after making the necessary arrangements for the towns' submissions and their future governance.\n\nIn 713, Abd al-Aziz ibn Musa subdued the forces of the Visigothic count Theodemir (or \"Tudmir\"), who had taken over southeastern Iberia from his base in Murcia after the power vacuum following king Roderic's defeat. Theudimer then signed a conditional capitulation by which his lands were made into an autonomous client state under Umayyad rule (\"the rule of God\"). \n\nHis government and the Christian beliefs of his subjects were respected; in exchange, he pledged to pay a tax (\"jizya\") and to hand over any rebels plotting against Umayyad rule or the Islamic religion. In this way, the life of many inhabitants remained much the same as before Tariq's and Musa's campaigns. The treaty signed with Theudimer set a precedent for the whole of Iberia, and towns surrendering to Umayyad troops experienced a similar fate, including probably the \"muwallad\" Banu Qasi based in the Ebro valley, and other counts and landowners.\n\nIn exception to this pattern, some towns (Cordova, Toledo, etc.) were stormed and captured unconditionally by the Umayyads, to be governed by direct Arab rule. In the area thought to be part of King Roderic's territory, Mérida also staged a prolonged resistance to the Umayyad advance, but was ultimately conquered in mid-summer 712. As of 713 (or 714), the last Visigothic king, Ardo, took over from Achila II, with effective control just over Septimania, and probably the eastern Pyrenean threshold and coastal areas of the Tarraconense.\n\nIslamic laws did not apply to all the subjects of the new rulers. Christians were ruled by their own Visigothic law code (\"Forum Iudicum\") as before. In most of the towns, ethnic communities remained segregated and newly arriving ethnic groups (Syrians, Yemenites, Berbers and others) would erect new boroughs outside existing urban areas. However, this would not apply to towns under direct Umayyad rule. In Cordova, the Cathedral was partitioned and shared to provide for the religious needs of Christians and Muslims. This situation lasted some 40 years until Abd ar-Rahman's conquest of southern Spain (756).\n\nAn early governor (wali) of al-Andalus, al-Hurr ibn Abd al-Rahman al-Thaqafi, spread the rule of the Umayyad Caliphate up to the Ebro valley and the northeastern borders of Iberia, pacifying most of the territory and initiating in 717 the first forays across the Pyrenees into Septimania. In addition, he laid out the foundations of Umayyad civil administration in Iberia, by sending civil administration officials (\"judges\") to conquered towns and lands guarded by garrisons established usually next to the population nuclei. \n\nMoreover, al-Hurr restored lands to their previous Christian landowners, which may have added greatly to the revenue of the Umayyad governors and the caliph of Damascus, by increasingly imposing the \"vectigalia\" on the former; this was a tax applied on a specific region or estate, and not per capitation (\"jizya\"). Only non-Muslims were subject to taxation, apart from a Muslim subject's compulsory alms-giving. The task of establishing a civil administration in conquered al-Andalus was essentially completed by the governor Yahya ibn Salama al-Kalbi 10 years later.\n\nThe period following al-Hurr's office saw the establishment of the Arabs in southern Septimania during Al-Samh ibn Malik al-Khawlani's tenure as wali. Narbonne fell (720), and no sooner had he garrisoned it than the Arab commander led an offensive against Toulouse. During this Umayyad thrust or its aftermath, King Ardo died (721).\n\nIn the first stage of the invasion, the armies were made up of Berbers and different Arab groups. These peoples, clustered around the banner of the Umayyads, did not mix together, remaining in separate towns and boroughs. The Berbers, recently subdued and superficially Islamized, were usually in charge of the most difficult tasks and the most rugged terrains, similar to the ones found in their north African homeland, while the Arabs occupied the gentler plains of southern Iberia.\n\nConsequently, the Berbers went on to stations in Galicia (possibly including Asturias) and the Upper Marches (Ebro basin), but these lands remained unpleasant, humid and cold. The grievances resented by the Berbers under Arab rulers (attempts to impose a tax on Muslim Berbers, etc.) sparked rebellions in north Africa that expanded into Iberia. An early uprising took place in 730, when Uthman ibn Naissa (Munuza), master of the eastern Pyrenees (Cerretanya), allied with the duke Odo of Aquitaine and detached from Cordova.\n\nThose internal frictions continually threatened (or sometimes may have spurred) the ever-expanding Umayyad military effort in al-Andalus during the conquest period. Around 739, on learning the news of Charles Martel's second intervention in Provence, Uqba ibn al-Hajjaj had to call off an expedition to the Lower Rhone in order to deal with the Berber revolt in the south instead. The following year, the Berber garrisons stationed in León, Astorga and other north-western outposts gave up their positions, and some of them even embraced the Christian religion. The Muslim settlement was thereafter established permanently south of the Douro's banks.\n\nThe Berber rebellions swept the whole of al-Andalus during Abd al-Malik ibn Katan al-Fihri's term as governor. Reinforcements were then called from the other end of the Mediterranean in a military capacity: the \"Syrian\" (actually Yemeni Arabs). The Berber rebellions were quelled in blood, and the Arab commanders came up reinforced after 742. Different Arab factions reached an agreement to alternate in office, but this did not last long, since Yusuf ibn 'Abd al-Rahman al-Fihri (opposed to the Umayyads) remained in power up to his defeat by Abd al-Rahman I in 756, and the establishment of the independent Umayyad Emirate of Cordova. It was in this period of unrest that the Frankish king Pepin finally captured Narbonne from the Andalusians (759).\n\nIn Yusuf's and Abd-ar-Rahman's fight for power in al-Andalus, the \"Syrian\" troops, a mainstay of the Umayyad Caliphate, split. For the most part, Arabs from the Mudhar and Qais tribes sided with Yusuf, as did the indigenous (second or third generation) Arabs from northern Africa, while Yemeni units and some Berbers sided with Abd-ar-Rahman, probably born to a north African Berber mother himself. In 756, south and central al-Andalus (Cordova, Sevilla) were in the hands of Abd-ar-Rahman, but it took still 25 years for him to hold sway over the Upper Marches (Pamplona, Zaragoza and all the northeast).\n\nThe Iberian Peninsula was the westernmost tip of the Umayyad Caliphate of Damascus and was under the rule of the governor of Ifriqiya. In 720, the caliph even considered abandoning the territory. The conquest was followed by a period of several hundred years during which most of the Iberian peninsula was known as Al-Andalus, dominated by Muslim rulers. Only a handful of new small Christian realms managed to reassert their authority across the faraway mountainous north of the peninsula.\n\nIn 756, Abd al-Rahman I, a survivor of the recently overthrown Umayyad Dynasty, landed in al-Andalus and seized power in Cordova and Seville, and proclaimed himself \"emir\" or \"malik\", removing any mentions of the Abbasid Caliphs from the Friday prayers. In the wake of these events, southern Iberia became \"de jure\" and \"de facto\" independent from the Abbasid Caliphate. Although this was not accepted outside al-Andalus and those North African territories with which it was affiliated, Abd al-Rahman, and especially his successors, considered that they were the legitimate continuation of the Umayyad caliphate, i.e. that their rule was more legitimate than that of the Abbasids. It seems that Abd ar-Rahman never considered establishing a separate principality. (See Caliphate of Córdoba.)\n\nDuring the unification of al-Andalus in the reign of Abd ar-Rahman before his death in 788, al-Andalus underwent centralization and slow but steady homogenization. The autonomous status of many towns and regions negotiated in the first years of the conquest was reversed by 778, in some cases much earlier (Pamplona by 742, for example). The Hispanic Church based in Toledo, whose status remained largely undiminished under the new rulers, fell out with the Roman Church during the Adoptionist controversy (late 8th century). Rome relied on an alliance with Charlemagne (in war with the Cordovan emirs) to defend its political authority and possessions, and went on to recognize the northern Asturian principality (\"Gallaecia\") as a kingdom apart from Cordova, and Alfonso II as king.\n\nThe population of al-Andalus, especially local nobles who aspired to a share in power, began to embrace Islam and the Arabic language. However, the majority of the population remained Christian (using the Mozarabic Rite), and Latin (Mozarabic) remained the principal language until the 11th century.\n\nAbd ar-Rahman I founded an independent dynasty that survived until the 11th century. That line was succeeded by a variety of short and small emirates (\"taifas\") unable to stop the push of the expanding northern Christian kingdoms. The Almoravids (1086–1094) and the Almohads (1146–1173) occupied al-Andalus next, and the Marinids in 1269, but that could not prevent the fragmentation of Muslim-ruled territory. The last Muslim emirate, Granada, was defeated by the armies of Castile (successor to Asturias) and Aragon under Isabella and Ferdinand in 1492. The last wave of expulsions of Spaniards of Muslim descent took place in 1614.\n\nAs discussed above, much of the traditional narrative of the Conquest is more legend than reliable history. Some of the key events and the stories around them are outlined below.\n\n\n"}

His racing career began as a hobby during his studies at the University of Georgia, where he earned a business degree. Jones originally wanted to race motocross, but his dad suggested stock cars since they were safer.\n\nAfter his sixth race Jones went out to dinner with his father, where he told him that he wanted to be a NASCAR champion. He and his father then developed a six-year plan that would allow Jones to move up the ladder and begin to fulfill his dream.\n\nIn 1995, Jones moved to the NASCAR Busch Series with his own team called Buckshot Racing. After a disappointing rookie campaign where his best finish was a ninth at South Boston Speedway, Jones hired Ricky Pearson, son of the legendary David Pearson, as his crew chief. Jones won two races over the next three years, winning the Most Popular Driver award in 1998. In 1999, after marrying his longtime girlfriend Jina, he made the jump to Winston Cup driving the No. 00 Pontiac, with Ricky's brother Larry Pearson taking over his Busch ride. Crown Fiber Communications was the major sponsor of the car. Jones failed to qualify several times in his rookie year, including the first two races of the season. On the occasions in which he did make the field, a DNF was the typical result. After nine starts, he decided to end his bid for Rookie of the Year and returned to the Busch Series. During his Busch campaign of 2000, he had one pole, three top-tens, and finished 21st in points.\n\nIn 2001 he returned to the Cup Series, driving the No. 44 Georgia-Pacific-sponsored Dodge Intrepid for Petty Enterprises. Unfortunately, the season was a struggle. He failed to qualify 5 times and had 10 DNFs, finishing 41st in points with a best result of 16th at Talladega in the spring, and again at Phoenix. Due to a growing family, Buckshot stopped racing full time in April of 2002. After missing the Daytona 500, he was 35th in points after Martinsville, with a top finish of 12th in his home race at Atlanta. He returned for 2 races in 2003, finishing 17th for Phoenix Racing at Daytona in July, and leading 19 laps for Michael Waltrip Racing in a career-best performance at Talladega in September before retiring with damage from a blown tire.\n\nBuckshot has since sold his team and temporarily retired from racing. He last appeared in a NASCAR sanctioned race in 2004, when he ran two Busch Series events. He currently works in land development and real estate in Gwinnett County, Georgia. He returned to auto racing in the Snowball Derby in December 2006 but finished last after being caught in an early accident. In 2007, he returned to racing to drive the No. 00 Chevrolet for DMT Motorsports in the Southern Division of the USAR Hooters Pro Cup Series, but re-retired at the end of the season. In 2015, Jones raced in the third division of the Whelen Modified Tour.\n"}

There are two distinct subspecies, both endangered and listed together on federal and state endangered species lists. The northern subspecies (\"Reithrodontomys raviventris halicoetes\") is lighter in color and inhabits the northern marshes of the bay, and the southern subspecies (\"Reithrodontomys raviventris raviventris\") lives in the East and South Bay marshes. They are both quite similar in appearance to their congener species, the [Western harvest mouse, \"R. megalotis\"], to which they are not closely related. Genetic studies of the northern subspecies have revealed that the salt marsh harvest mouse is most closely related to the plains harvest mouse, \"R. montanus\", (), which occurs now in the Midwest]. Its endangered designation is due to its limited range, historic decline in population and continuing threat of habitat loss due to development encroachment at the perimeter of San Francisco Bay.\n\nThe southern population of the salt marsh harvest mouse tends to have dark brown fur above and a pinkish cinnamon or tawny belly; moreover, the tail is likewise bicolored. An adult's length is five to seven centimeters (2 to 3 inches) and a tail length of six to ten centimeters (2 to 4 inches). The height is between 1.5 and 2.1 centimeters (0.6 to 0.8 inches). Weight of a mature mouse is approximately 10 to 20 grams (0.35 to 0.7 ounces). The northern subspecies is also dorsally brown or reddish brown, but the venters tend to be white or cream, and rarely with a hint of reddish; tail length is usually about 120% of the body length. The upper incisors are grooved. As a member of the Neotominae subfamily, the dental formula of \"R. raviventris\" is .\n\nThis species is nocturnal, with particularly noted activity on moonlit nights. This mouse is particularly resourceful, making use of ground runways of other rodents; moreover, he also exhibits climbing agility. It occupies marsh habitats where pickleweed and marsh plants abound. Its many predators feature hawk, snake and owl species, as well as shorebirds and larger mammals. Predation by domestic cats is an issue due to encroachment of the limited habitat by humans at the perimeter of the San Francisco Bay.\n\nAs would be expected of a mouse native to salt marshes, this species is a competent swimmer and is tolerant of salt in its diet and water supply. It eats seeds and plants, especially pickleweed and glasswort, one of the most common salt marsh plant species.\n\nSimilar species are the Plains Harvest Mouse, and the Fulvous Harvest Mouse, which has a longer tail. The species co-occurs with the similar Western harvest mouse, which tends to have dorsal fur that is more gray than \"R. raviventris\" and with ventral fur that is white to grayish; and the House mouse which is gray, has a scaly tail and incisors without grooves, unlike those of the salt marsh harvest mouse.\n\nSurvey data from Suisun Marsh found that the salt marsh harvest mouse can live up to 18 months and possibly longer. Females commonly have two litters per year. In the summer, when salinity of water and vegetation increases, the mice have a notable advantage due to their ability to drink and survive purely on salt water. The northern species can survive purely on salt water, but prefers freshwater to saltwater. The southern species can survive on either, and does not display a preference.\n\nThe mice depend heavily on vegetation cover, particularly pickleweed and tules (\"Schoenoplectus\" \"spp\".). Pickleweed (\"Salicornia virginica\") is their primary and preferred habitat as well their main food source; However, \"R. raviventris\" are found in a variety of marsh habitats, including diked and tidal wetlands. The salt marsh harvest mouse is not an aggressive species; many mice live in close quarters, withstanding short durations of high population density due to seasonal flooding that restricts individuals to small patches of dry ground. They can also survive tidal or seasonal flooding due to their superior ability to swim, float and climb.\n\n\"R. raviventris\" home range and habitat use differ temporally across age and sex. Juveniles exhibit home ranges of 600–700 m² whereas adults exhibit home ranges of 1300–1500 m². Males and females also differ in the structural complexity of their occupied habitat during fall and summer (breeding season) but occupy the same habitat during winter and spring. While the cause is still unknown, this seasonal disparity in habitat use may be related to a reduced risk of predation and intraspecific competition in more structurally complex habitats. Furthermore, movement of \"R.raviventris\" individuals within their home ranges varies seasonally, with mean distance traveled highest in June and lowest in November.\n\nThis organism is known to be found in the following specific locales (among others):\n\nThe salt marsh harvest mouse has lost much of its habitat to extensive development of bayside marshland, pollution, drugs, boat activity, and commercial salt harvesting. It has been on the endangered lists since the 1970s, and has protected habitat within numerous Bay Area wildlife refuges. Individual political jurisdictions have conducted research and established habitat protection strategies to protect the salt marsh harvest mouse. For example, the city of San Rafael, California has established a shoreline setback standard to prevent any land development within fifty feet of the shoreline; this measure has been applied to several specific land developments along the San Francisco Bay shoreline. Researchers like Katherine Smith of California Department of Fish and Wildlife are at the forefront of research helping to identify how threats like climate change impact the species while increasing the understanding of its biology, ecology and behavior.\n\nThe preservation of the salt marsh harvest mouse habitat was a subject of discussion in 2009 Economic Stimulus package. The mouse was mentioned numerous times in Congress by Republicans such as Rep. Mike Pence and Rep. Dan Lungren to highlight the wasteful spending of the bill. It was claimed that $30m of the 2009 economic stimulus would be spent on habitat restoration to protect the mouse. The rumor was apparently started by Michael Steel, press secretary for John Boehner. This was disputed in a San Francisco Chronicle article by Democratic U.S. Rep Jackie Speier.\n\n"}

{"id": "2169993", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2169993", "title": "Mark Lane (author)", "text": "Mark Lane (author)\n\nMark Lane (February 24, 1927 – May 10, 2016) was an American attorney, New York state legislator, civil rights activist, and Vietnam war-crimes investigator. He is best known as a leading researcher, author, and conspiracy theorist on the assassination of United States President John F. Kennedy. From his 1966 number-one bestselling critique of the Warren Commission, \"Rush to Judgment\", to \"Last Word: My Indictment of the CIA in the Murder of JFK\", published in 2011, Lane wrote at least four major works on the JFK assassination and no fewer than ten books overall.\n\nMark Lane was born in The Bronx, New York, the son of Harry Arnold and Elizabeth Levin (Levin was changed to Lane in the 1920s), and raised in Brooklyn, New York. He served in the United States Army after World War II. After attending Long Island University, he received an LL.B from Brooklyn Law School in 1951. As a law student, Lane was the administrative assistant to the National Lawyers Guild and orchestrated a fund-raising event at Town Hall in New York City that featured American folk singer Pete Seeger.\n\nFollowing his admission to the New York bar in 1951, Lane established a practice with Seymour Ostrow in East Harlem. Although Lane acquired a reputation as \"a defender of the poor and oppressed,\" Ostrow later asserted that Lane was \"motivated more by his ambition and quest for publicity than any dedication to a cause or concern for the interest of his clients.\" The partnership dissolved in the late 1950s.\n\nIn 1959, Lane helped found the Reform Democrat movement within the New York Democratic Party. He was elected with the support of Eleanor Roosevelt and presidential candidate John F. Kennedy (JFK) to the New York Legislature in 1960. During his own campaign, he also managed the New York City area's campaign for JFK's 1960 presidential bid. He was a member of the New York State Assembly (New York County's 10th District, encompassing East Harlem and Yorkville, where Lane resided) in 1961 and 1962. In the legislature, Lane spent considerable time working to abolish capital punishment. Lane promised to serve for only one term, and then manage the campaign for his replacement—which he did.\n\nIn June 1961, during the civil rights movement, Lane was the only sitting legislator to be arrested for opposing segregation as a \"Freedom Rider\". In 1962, he ran for Congress in the Democratic primary and lost. In the 1968 presidential election, Lane appeared on the ballot as a third party vice-presidential candidate, running on the Freedom and Peace Party ticket (an offshoot of the Peace and Freedom Party) with Dick Gregory.\n\nFour weeks after the assassination of Kennedy on November 22, 1963, Lane published an article in the \"National Guardian\" dealing in-depth with 15 questions regarding statements by public officials about the murders of J. D. Tippit and John F. Kennedy from the perspective of a defense attorney. The statements were about the witnesses who claimed to have seen Lee Harvey Oswald on the sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository; the paraffin test which, to Lane, indicated that Oswald had not fired a rifle recently; the conflicting claims about the rifle which at first was, as the police announced, a German Mauser and afterwards a smaller guage Italian Mannlicher–Carcano; the Parkland Hospital doctors announcing an entrance wound in the throat, and the role of the FBI and the press, who convicted Oswald before his guilt was proven. In June 1964, according to historian Peter Knight, Bertrand Russell, \"prompted by the emerging work of the lawyer Mark Lane in the US ... rallied support from other noteworthy and left-leaning compatriots to form a Who Killed Kennedy Committee, members of which included Michael Foot MP, the wife of Tony Benn MP, the publisher Victor Gollancz, the writers John Arden and J. B. Priestley, and the Oxford history professor Hugh Trevor-Roper.\" Russell published a highly critical article weeks before the Warren Commission Report was published, setting forth \"16 Questions on the Assassination\" and equating the Oswald case with the Dreyfus affair of late nineteenth-century France in which the state wrongly convicted an innocent man. Russell also criticized the American press for failing to heed any voices critical of the official version.\"\n\nIn 1975, Lane became the Director of the Citizens Commission of Inquiry (CCI), which challenged the veracity of official accounts of the assassination \n\nLane applied to the Warren Commission to represent the interests of Oswald, but the Commission rejected his request. Three months later Walter E. Craig, president of the American Bar Association, was appointed by the Commission to represent the interests of Oswald. Craig himself stated that he was not counsel for Oswald; and official records do not indicate that Craig or his associates named, cross-examined, or interviewed witnesses of their own. Lane continued to search for clues for Oswald's innocence. He was called to testify before the Commission but was not permitted to cross-examine witnesses. According to R. Andrew Kiel in \"J. Edgar Hoover: The Father of the Cold War\", \"After the Warren Commission's final report was completed in September 1964, Lane interviewed numerous witnesses ignored by the Commission.\"\n\nFor Lane, Commission chairman Chief Justice Earl Warren had only contempt. According to biographer Ed Cray, Warren \"deemed Lane a publicity seeker who 'played fast and loose' with the subject.\" Warren maintained prior to his death that the Commission had investigated all leads and left no witness unheard.\n\nLane provided testimony to the Warren Commission in Washington, D.C. on March 4, 1964. Lane testified that he had contacted witness Helen Markham sometime within the five days preceding his appearance before the Commission and that she had described Tippit's killer to him as \"short, a little on the heavy side, and his hair was somewhat bushy\". He added, \"I think it is fair to state that an accurate description of Oswald would be average height, quite slender with thin and receding hair.\"\n\nIn addressing the assertion that Markham's description of Tippit's killer was not consistent with the appearance of Oswald, the Warren Commission stated that they had reviewed the telephone transcript in which she was alleged to have made it. The Commission wrote: \"A review of the complete transcript has satisfied the Commission that Mrs. Markham strongly reaffirmed her positive identification of Oswald and denied having described the killer as short, stocky and having bushy hair.\" As a result of this, Lane was called to re-appear before the Warren Commission in July 1964. Chief Justice Earl Warren told him that the commission had \"every reason to doubt the truthfulness\" of some of Mr. Lane's testimony due to the appearance of him misrepresenting what Markham told him.\n\nLane published an indictment of the Warren Commission, entitled \"Rush to Judgment\", using these interviews as well as evidence from the 26 volumes of the Commission's report. Despite the fact that the majority of Mark Lane's material for his book came from the Warren Report itself, as well as from interviews with those who were at the scene, sixteen publishers canceled contracts before \"Rush to Judgment\" was published. The book became a number one best seller and spent 29 weeks on the \"New York Times\" best-seller list. The book criticizes in detail the work and conclusions of the Warren Commission and remains one of the most remarkable books about the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. It was adapted into a documentary film in 1966.\n\nLane questions, among other things, the Warren Commission conclusion that three shots were fired from the Texas School Book Depository and focuses on the witnesses who had recounted seeing or hearing shots coming from the grassy knoll in Dealey Plaza. Lane questions whether Oswald was guilty of the murder of policeman J.D. Tippit shortly after the Kennedy murder. Lane also states that none of the Warren Commission firearm experts were able to duplicate Oswald's shooting feat.\n\nAccording to former KGB officer Vasili Mitrokhin in his 1999 book \"The Sword and the Shield\", the KGB helped finance Lane's research on \"Rush to Judgment\" without the author's knowledge. The KGB allegedly used journalist Genrikh Borovik as a contact and provided Lane with $2000 for research and travel in 1964. Mark Lane called the allegation \"an outright lie\" and wrote, \"Neither the KGB nor any person or organization associated with it ever made any contribution to my work.\"\n\nLane later wrote \"A Citizen's Dissent\", documenting his response to the Warren Commission's governmental findings on the Kennedy assassination. He also wrote the first screenplay of the 1973 film \"Executive Action\" (starring Burt Lancaster and Robert Ryan), with Donald Freed, and his associate, Steve Jaffe, was supervising producer and credited with supplying much of the research material for the film. Lane asserted in his 1991 book \"Plausible Denial\" that he only worked on the first draft of the screenplay which was ultimately credited to Dalton Trumbo. He noted that he collaborated with Donald Freed on it and after seeing subsequent drafts, they complained both privately to the producer and publicly at press conferences, pointing out errors in the work.\n\nIn 1991, Lane described \"Plausible Denial\" as his \"last word\" on the subject and told Patricia Holt of the \"San Francisco Chronicle\": \"I'll never write another sentence about the (JFK) assassination\". In November 2011, Lane published a third major book on the JFK assassination titled \"Last Word: My Indictment of the CIA in the Murder of JFK\".\n\nLane represented the political advocacy group Liberty Lobby as an attorney when the group was sued over an article in \"The Spotlight\" newspaper implicating E. Howard Hunt (a convicted Watergte burglar) in the Kennedy assassination. Hunt sued for defamation and was awarded $650,000 in damages. Lane successfully got this judgment reversed on appeal. \n\nThis case became the basis for Lane's book \"Plausible Denial\". In the book, Lane claimed that he convinced the jury that Hunt was involved in the JFK assassination, but mainstream news accounts asserted that some jurors decided the case on the issue of whether \"The Spotlight\" had acted with \"\"actual malice\"\". Lane represented Willis Carto after Carto lost control of the Institute for Historical Review in 1993.\n\nIn 1995, Lane lost a defamation suit against book publisher Random House, which used the caption \"Guilty of Misleading the American Public\" under a photo of Lane in an advertisement for Gerald Posner's \"Case Closed\". He sought $10 million in damages for disparagement of his integrity and the unauthorized use of his photograph. Lane was rebuked by Judge Royce C. Lamberth of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia who said: \"A conspiracy theory warrior outfitted with Lane's acerbic tongue and pen should not expect immunity from an occasional, constrained chastisement.\" A similar suit filed by Robert J. Groden against Random House was dismissed the previous year by a federal judge in New York.\n\nIn 1970, Lane involved himself in several war crime inquiries being conducted primarily by antiwar organizations such as the National Committee for a Citizens Commission of Inquiry on U.S. War Crimes in Vietnam Citizens Commission of Inquiry and the Vietnam Veterans Against the War. Lane used his contacts and raised funds to support these events, including what would become the National Committee for a Citizens Commission of Inquiry on U.S. War Crimes in Vietnam National Veterans Inquiry and the VVAWs Winter Soldier Investigation. National Committee for a Citizens Commission of Inquiry on U.S. War Crimes in Vietnam and VVAW had originally combined their efforts toward the production of one large war crime investigation, and Lane was initially invited to join the organizing steering committee. Lane suggested the Winter Soldier name, based on Thomas Paine's description of the \"summer soldiers\" at Valley Forge shrinking from service to their country in a time of crisis. Lane would often travel with fellow activist Jane Fonda to antiwar speaking engagements and fundraising rallies. Lane was also writing a book, \"Conversations with Americans\", a collection of interviews with US servicemen about war crimes in the Vietnam War.\n\nLane's close association with the National Committee for a Citizens Commission of Inquiry on U.S. War Crimes in Vietnam and VVAW would be short-lived. Tod Ensign recalled\n\nIt was a mistake to think that celebrities like Jane Fonda and Mark Lane who were used to operating as free agents would submit to the discipline of a steering committee. We should have placed them, instead, on an advisory panel where their visibility and political and money contacts would have been used without having to tangle with them on broader strategic and tactical questions.\n\nNational Committee for a Citizens Commission of Inquiry on U.S. War Crimes in Vietnam staffers criticized Lane as being arrogant and sensationalistic, and said the book he was writing had \"shoddy reporting in it\". National Committee for a Citizens Commission of Inquiry on U.S. War Crimes in Vietnam leaders refused to work with Lane further and gave the VVAW leaders a \"Lane or us\" ultimatum. VVAW did not wish to lose the monetary support of Lane and Fonda, so the National Committee for a Citizens Commission of Inquiry on U.S. War Crimes in Vietnam split from the project. The following month, after caustic reviews of Lane's book by authors and a Vietnam expert, VVAW also distanced itself from Lane.\n\nJames Reston Jr., in the \"Saturday Review\", calls Lane's book disreputable, in that all of the reports contained in it are admittedly unverified, and lean toward the salacious. \"Lane makes no pretense of distinguishing between fact and a soldier's talent for embellishment\", Reston observed. Commenting on the book's redeeming social value, Reston added that \"it would be to show that a pattern of atrocities exists in Vietnam, proving that while My Lai was larger, it was not unique. This needs to be demonstrated, since the Pentagon continues to insist that My Lai was an isolated case. But the effort will have to be left to more responsible parties, like the National Veterans Inquiry.\" A review of Lane's book by Neil Sheehan in the \"New York Times Book Review\" claimed that four of the 32 servicemen interviewed by Lane for the book had misrepresented their military service, according to the Defense Department. Lane responded to Sheehan's inquiries by stating that the Defense Department is the least reliable of all sources for verification of atrocity accounts and that verification of simple facts about the interviewees was \"not relevant.\" Sheehan called Lane's book irresponsible, concluding that, \"Some of the horror tales in this book are undoubtedly true\", and the \"men who now run the military establishment cannot conduct a credible investigation... But until the country does summon up the courage to convene a responsible inquiry, we probably deserve the Mark Lanes.\" Because of Sheehan's review, Simon and Schuster reneged on the contract for the book. When Lane disproved Sheehan's charges, they were forced to settle with him.\n\nThe controversial book reviews caused concern in the VVAW leadership, as Andrew E. Hunt notes,\n\nSheehan's exposé had placed VVAW leaders in a difficult position. Lane's involvement with the planning of the Winter Soldier Investigation had been extensive. His legal and financial assistance had proven invaluable. Few VVAWers doubted his sincerity or devotion to the effort. Yet they feared associating with Lane could tarnish months of difficult work. \"Then the question became, 'How do we protect our integrity?'\" recalled Joe Urgo, \"'How do we separate ourselves from this guy?'\" Organizers hoped Lane would maintain a low profile. Their wishes were fulfilled.\n\nVVAW veterans involved with the WSI event then realized they needed to take control, and insisted that there be no more interference from the likes of Lane. A new, all-veteran steering committee was formed without Lane. Ultimately, the WSI was an event produced by veterans only, without the need of civilians such as Lane and Fonda.\n\nLane wrote \"Murder In Memphis\" with Dick Gregory (previously titled \"Code Name Zorro\", after the Central Intelligence Agency's name for King) about the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr., in which he alleged a conspiracy and government coverup. Lane represented James Earl Ray, King's alleged assassin, before the House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) inquiry in 1978. The HSCA said of Lane in its report, \"Many of the allegations of conspiracy that the committee investigated were first raised by Mark Lane ...\n\nIn 1978, Lane began to represent the Peoples Temple. Temple leader Jim Jones hired Lane and Donald Freed to help make the case of what it alleged to be a \"grand conspiracy\" by intelligence agencies against the Peoples Temple. Jones told Lane he wanted to \"pull an Eldridge Cleaver\", referring to the fugitive Black Panther who was able to return to the United States after repairing his reputation.\n\nIn September 1978, Lane visited Jonestown, spoke to Jonestown residents, provided support for the theory that intelligence agencies conspired against Jonestown and drew parallels between Martin Luther King and Jim Jones. Lane then held press conferences stating that \"none of the charges\" against the Temple \"are accurate or true\" and that there was a \"massive conspiracy\" against the Temple by \"intelligence organizations,\" naming the CIA, FBI, FCC and the U.S. Post Office. Though Lane represented himself as disinterested, the Temple paid Lane $6,000 per month to help generate such theories. Regarding the effect of the work of Lane and Freed upon Temple members, Temple member Annie Moore wrote that \"Mom and Dad have probably shown you the latest about the conspiracy information that Mark Lane, the famous attorney in the ML King case and Don Freed the other famous author in the Kennedy case have come up with regarding activities planned against us—Peoples Temple.\" Another Temple member, Carolyn Layton, wrote that Don Freed told them that \"anything this drug out could be nothing less than conspiracy\".\n\nLane was present in Jonestown during the evening of November 18, 1978, and witnessed or heard part of the events claiming at least 408 lives (out of a total recount of 915 carried out five days later); these events involved, up to some extent, murder-suicide by cyanide poisoning and were compounded by the murder of Congressman Leo Ryan and four others at a nearby airstrip. For months before that tragedy, Jones frequently created fear among members by stating that the CIA and other intelligence agencies were conspiring with \"capitalist pigs\" to destroy Jonestown and harm its members. This included mentions of CIA involvement in the address Jones gave the day before the arrival of Congressman Ryan.\n\nDuring the visit of Congressman Ryan, Lane helped represent the Temple along with its other attorney, Charles R. Garry, who was furious with Lane for holding numerous press conferences and alleging the existence of conspiracies against the Peoples Temple. Garry was also displeased with Lane for making a veiled threat that the Temple might move to the Soviet Union in a letter to Congressman Ryan.\n\nLate in the afternoon of November 18, two men wielding rifles approached Lane and Garry, who had earlier been sent to a small wooden house by Jones. It is not clear whether the gunmen were sent to kill Lane and Garry, but one of the gunmen recognized Charles Garry as an attorney in a trial that the gunman had attended. After a relatively friendly exchange, the men informed Garry and Lane that they were going to \"commit revolutionary suicide\" to \"expose this racist and fascist society\". The gunmen then gave Garry and Lane directions to exit Jonestown. Garry and Lane then sneaked into the jungle, where they hid and called a temporary truce while the tragedy unfolded.\n\nOn a tape made while members committed suicide by ingesting cyanide-poisoned punch, the reason given by Jones to commit suicide was consistent with Jones's previously stated conspiracy theories of intelligence organizations allegedly conspiring against the Temple, that men would \"parachute in here on us\", \"shoot some of our innocent babies\" and \"they'll torture our children, they'll torture some of our people here, they'll torture our seniors\". Parroting Jones's prior statements that hostile forces would convert captured children to fascism, one temple member states, \"[T]he ones that they take captured, they're gonna just let them grow up and be dummies\". Annie Moore and Carolyn Layton were among the 900 who died.\n\nLane later wrote a book about the tragedy, \"The Strongest Poison\". Lane reported hearing automatic weapon fire, and presumes that U.S. forces killed Jonestown survivors. While Lane blames Jones and Peoples Temple leadership for the deaths at Jonestown, he also claims that U.S. officials exacerbated the possibility of violence by employing \"agents provocateurs\". For example, Lane claimed that Temple attorney (and later defector) Timothy Stoen, who, Lane alleged, had repeatedly prompted the Temple to take radical action before defecting, \"had evidently led three lives\", one of those being a government informant or agent.\n\nLane is the author of the 1970 book \"Arcadia\" in which he details the effort to prove that James Joseph Richardson, a black migrant worker in Florida, had been falsely accused of killing his seven children. He was convicted of the murders through corrupt means used by the authorities involved. Richardson had been on death row for almost five years for the crimes, escaping execution by virtue of the Furman v. Georgia Supreme Court decision. Nineteen years after the book was published he received a hearing in which the charges were dropped thanks to the interventions of Lane and Miami's then- prosecutor, Janet Reno. Richardson was released from prison after 21 years, and Richardson's babysitter, though suffering from dementia, later confessed to the murders.\n\nLane resided in Charlottesville, Virginia. He continued to practice law and lectured on many subjects, especially the importance of the United States Constitution (mainly the Bill Of Rights and the First Amendment) and civil rights.\n\nAt the annual Law Library of Congress and American Bar Association Law Day symposium 2001, on the question, \"Who are the paradigms for the lawyer as reformer in American culture?\", Mark Lane was one of the twelve legal figures featured by panel moderator, Bernard Hibbitts, professor at the University of Pittsburgh School of Law.\n\nOn May 10, 2016, Lane died of a heart attack at his home in Charlottesville at the age of 89.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The area code was one of the original area codes established in October 1947 by AT&T in the North American Numbering Plan (NANP).\n\nAfter the State of New Jersey with area code 201, the District of Columbia was the second Numbering Plan Area (NPA). NPAs that covered an entire administrative region received a code in which the second digit was '0'.\n\nAs of April 2020, the District of Columbia has not experienced an area-code split or overlay because the area code is not expected to be exhausted until the third quarter of 2022. Washington is thus one of the largest cities where seven-digit dialing is still possible. However, calls are connected if the area code is dialed. There is no provision for long-distance calls within the area code.\n\nFrom the 1950s to 1990, area code 202 was an unpublished alternate area code for the nearby suburbs in Maryland and Virginia, which were officially in area codes 301 and 703, respectively. This arrangement permitted seven-digit dialing of local calls throughout the metropolitan area. One side effect was that a central office prefix could only be duplicated in jurisdictions a safe distance from the metropolitan area, such as the Eastern Shore of Maryland or southwestern Virginia. However, on October 1, 1990, this arrangement was terminated because of pending number exhaustion throughout the area. This did not free up enough numbers to meet demand on either side of the Potomac River, forcing the split of area code 410 from 301 in 1991 and the split of area code 540 from 703 in 1995. The region's continued growth in the 1990s ultimately resulted in the suburban area codes being overlaid, with 301 being overlaid with 240 in 1997 and 703 being overlaid with 571 in 2000. \n\nYears after the introduction of mobile number portability, many cell phone customers on the Virginia and Maryland sides of the metro have 202 numbers.\n\nEven with the implementation of ten-digit dialing in the Washington metro, much of the Washington area is still a toll-free calling zone–one of the largest in the eastern United States, covering large slices of northern Virginia and southern Maryland.\n\nAreas such as Alexandria, Arlington, Fairfax, Falls Church, McLean and Tysons in Virginia (703/571) and Rockville, Gaithersburg, Upper Marlboro, Bethesda and Landover in Maryland (301/240) are a local call to Washington.\n\n"}

{"id": "2170017", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2170017", "title": "Energy Policy Act of 2005", "text": "Energy Policy Act of 2005\n\nThe Energy Policy Act of 2005 () is a bill passed by the United States Congress on July 29, 2005, and signed into law by President George W. Bush on August 8, 2005, at Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque, New Mexico. The act, described by proponents as an attempt to combat growing energy problems, changed US energy policy by providing tax incentives and loan guarantees for energy production of various types.\n\nThe Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 was repealed, effective February 2006, by the passing of this act.\n\n\nIn Congressional bills, an \"authorization\" of a discretionary program is a permission to spend money IF money has been appropriated; while an \"appropriation\" is the provision of funds so it can be spent. The authorizations above will not get carried out if money is never appropriated for them.\n\n\nThe bill amends the Uniform Time Act of 1966 by changing the start and end dates of daylight saving time, beginning in 2007. Clocks were set ahead one hour on the second Sunday of March (March 11, 2007) instead of on the first Sunday of April (April 1, 2007). Clocks were set back one hour on the first Sunday in November (November 4, 2007), rather than on the last Sunday of October (October 28, 2007). This had the net effect of slightly lengthening the duration of daylight saving time.\n\nLobbyists for this provision included the Sporting Goods Manufacturers Association, the National Association of Convenience Stores, and the National Retinitis Pigmentosa Foundation Fighting Blindness.\n\nLobbyists against this provision included the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, the United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism, the National Parent-Teacher Association, the Calendaring and Scheduling Consortium, the Edison Electric Institute, and the Air Transport Association. This section of the act is controversial; some have questioned whether daylight saving results in net energy savings.\n\nThe Act created the Energy Efficient Commercial Buildings Tax Deduction, a special financial incentive designed to reduce the initial cost of investing in energy-efficient building systems via an accelerated tax deduction under section §179D of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) Many building owners are unaware that the [Policy Act of 2005] includes a tax deduction (§179D) for investments in \"energy efficient commercial building property\" designed to significantly reduce the heating, cooling, water heating and interior lighting cost of new or existing commercial buildings placed into service between January 1, 2006 and December 31, 2013.\n§179D includes full and partial tax deductions for investments in energy efficient commercial building that are designed to increase the efficiency of energy-consuming functions. Up to $.60 for lighting, $.60 for HVAC and $.60 for building envelope, creating a potential deduction of $1.80 per sq/ft. Interior lighting may also be improved using the Interim Lighting Rule, which provides a simplified process to earn the Deduction, capped at $0.30-$0.60/square foot. Improvements are compared to a baseline of ASHRAE 2001 standards.\n\nTo obtain these benefits the facilities/energy division of a business, its tax department, and a firm specializing in EPAct 179D deductions needed to cooperate. IRS mandated software had to be used and an independent 3rd party had to certify the qualification. For municipal buildings, benefits were passed through to the primary designers/architects in an attempt to encourage innovative municipal design.\n\nThe Commercial Buildings Tax Deduction expiration date had been extended twice, last by the Energy Improvement and Extension Act of 2008. With this extension, the CBTD could be claimed for qualifying projects completed before January 1, 2014.\n\nThe commercial building tax deductions could be used to improve the payback period of a prospective energy improvement investment. The deductions could be combined by participating in demand response programs where building owners agree to curtail usage at peak times for a premium. The most common qualifying projects were in the area of lighting.\n\nSummary of Energy Savings Percentages Provided by IRS Guidance\n\nPercentages permitted under Notice 2006-52\n\nPercentages permitted under Notice 2008-40\n\nPercentages permitted under Notice 2012-22\nEffective date of Notice 2012-22 – December 31, 2013; if §179D is extended beyond December 31, 2013, is also effective (except as otherwise provided in an amendment of §179D or the guidance thereunder) during the period of the extension.\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office review of the conference version of the bill estimated the Act will increase direct spending by $2.2 billion over the 2006-2010 period, and by $1.6 billion over the 2006-2015 period. The CBO did not attempt to estimate additional effects on discretionary spending.\nThe CBO and the Joint Committee on Taxation estimated that the legislation would reduce revenues by $7.9 billion over the 2005-2010 period and by $12.3 billion over the 2005-2015 period.\n\nThe collective reduction in national consumption of energy (gas and electricity) is significant for home heating. The Act provided gible financial incentives (tax credits) for average homeowners to make environmentally positive changes to their homes. It made improvements to home energy use more affordable for walls, doors, windows, roofs, water heaters, etc. Consumer spending, and hence the national economy, was abetted. Industry grew for manufacture of these environmentally positive improvements. These positive improvements have been near and long-term in effect.\n\nThe collective reduction in national consumption of oil is significant for automotive vehicles. The Act provided tangible financial incentives (tax credits) for operators of hybrid vehicles. It helped fuel competition among auto makers to meet rising demands for fuel-efficient vehicles. Consumer spending, and hence the national economy, was abetted. Dependence on imported oil was reduced. The national trade deficit was improved. Industry grew for manufacture of these environmentally positive improvements. These positive improvements have been near and long-term in effect.\n\n\nThe Act was voted on and passed twice by the United States Senate, once prior to conference committee, and once after. In both cases, there were numerous senators who voted against the bill. John McCain, the Republican Party nominee for President of the United States in the 2008 election voted against the bill. Democrat Barack Obama, President of the United States from January 2009 to January 2017, voted in favor of the bill.\n\n\nTo remove from 18 CFR Part 366.1 the definitions of \"electric utility company\" and exempt wholesale generator (EWG), that an EWG is not an electric utility company.\n\nJune 28, 2005, 10:00 a.m. Yeas - 85, Nays - 12\n\nThe bill's conference committee included 14 Senators and 51 House members. The senators on the committee were: Republicans Domenici, Craig, Thomas, Alexander, Murkowski, Burr, Grassley and Democrats Bingaman, Akaka, Dorgan, Wyden, Johnson, and Baucus.\n\nJuly 29, 2005, 12:50 p.m. Yeas - 74, Nays - 26\n\n\n\n\n"}
