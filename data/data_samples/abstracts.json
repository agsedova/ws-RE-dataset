After graduating Harvard in 1900,  he established himself as a music critic,  writing for the New York Globe,  New York Mail and finally New York World-Telegram\\.  As a poet he was published in \"Trend\",  for which he served as an editorial staffer beginning in 1914\\.  As a novelist,  his 1929 novel \"Prima Donna\" was called by one New York Times critic \u201can amazing achievement; nothing quite like it has been done in this country before\\. \u201d He went on to put Sanborn in the same league with Willa Cather,  Edith Wharton and Thornton Wilder\\.  Sanborn was remarked upon as one of the great originals of 1920s-1930s culture\\.  Sanborn's wealth of connections in intellectual and cultural circles included Van Wyck Brooks,  Rosa Ponselle,  Mark Van Doren and Llewelyn Jones\\.  His friendship with Wallace Stevens \\( whom he met at Harvard\\)  included a great influence upon Stevens\u2019 interest in music and thus his poetry\\.  He was a good friend and sometimes lover of Carl Van Vechten,  who he convinced to assume editorship of \"Trend\"\\.  He was also a radio commentator for the Philadelphia Orchestra\\.  Sanborn died at 61 of an apparent heart attack in his Greenwich Village apartment a few hours after he had attended a performance at the Metropolitan Opera House\\.  He had just completed the first paragraph of his review\\.  \n\n", "sentences": [{"sentenceId": "1794434:0:0", "sentenceText": "", "sentenceStart": 0, "sentenceEnd": 0, "entities": []}, {"sentenceId": "1794434:0:0", "sentenceText": "", "sentenceStart": 0, "sentenceEnd": 0, "entities": []}, {"sentenceId": "1794434:0:0", "sentenceText": "", "sentenceStart": 0, "sentenceEnd": 0, "entities": []}, {"sentenceId": "1794434:0:0", "sentenceText": "", "sentenceStart": 0, "sentenceEnd": 0, "entities": []}, {"sentenceId": "1794434:0:0", "sentenceText": "", "sentenceStart": 0, "sentenceEnd": 0, "entities": []}, {"sentenceId": "1794434:0:0", "sentenceText": "", "sentenceStart": 0, "sentenceEnd": 0, "entities": []}, {"sentenceId": "1794434:0:0", "sentenceText": "", "sentenceStart": 0, "sentenceEnd": 0, "entities": []}, {"sentenceId": "1794434:0:0", "sentenceText": "", "sentenceStart": 0, "sentenceEnd": 0, "entities": []}, {"sentenceId": "1794434:0:0", "sentenceText": "", "sentenceStart": 0, "sentenceEnd": 0, "entities": []}, {"sentenceId": "1794434:0:0", "sentenceText": "", "sentenceStart": 0, "sentenceEnd": 0, "entities": []}, {"sentenceId": "1794434:0:0", "sentenceText": "", "sentenceStart": 0, "sentenceEnd": 0, "entities": []}, {"sentenceId": "1794434:0:0", "sentenceText": "", "sentenceStart": 0, "sentenceEnd": 0, "entities": []}, {"sentenceId": "1794434:0:0", "sentenceText": "", "sentenceStart": 0, "sentenceEnd": 0, "entities": []}, {"sentenceId": "1794434:0:0", "sentenceText": "", "sentenceStart": 0, "sentenceEnd": 0, "entities": []}, {"sentenceId": "1794434:0:0", "sentenceText": "", "sentenceStart": 0, "sentenceEnd": 0, "entities": []}, {"sentenceId": "1794434:0:0", "sentenceText": "", "sentenceStart": 0, "sentenceEnd": 0, "entities": []}, {"sentenceId": "1794434:0:0", "sentenceText": "", "sentenceStart": 0, "sentenceEnd": 0, "entities": []}]}, "1794437": {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1794437", "title": "Messeturm K\u00f6ln", "text": "The Messeturm K\u00f6ln \\( German for Fair Tower Cologne\\)  is a highrise building which is 80 meters high,  in Cologne,  Germany\\.

The term \"dynamic packaging\" is often used incorrectly to describe the less sophisticated process of interchanging various travel components within a package,  however,  this practice is more accurately described as \"dynamic bundling\"\\.  True dynamic packaging demands the automated recombination of travel components based on the inclusion of rules that not only dictate the content of the package but also conditional pricing rules based on various conditions such as the trip characteristics,  suppliers contributing components,  the channel of distribution,  and terms of sale\\.  Dynamic packages are primarily sold online,  but online travel agencies will also sell by phone owing to the strong margins and high sale price of the product\\. \n\n", "sentences": [{"sentenceId": "1791536:0:0", "sentenceText": "", "sentenceStart": 0, "sentenceEnd": 0, "entities": []}, {"sentenceId": "1791536:0:0", "sentenceText": "", "sentenceStart": 0, "sentenceEnd": 0, "entities": []}, {"sentenceId": "1791536:0:0", "sentenceText": "", "sentenceStart": 0, "sentenceEnd": 0, "entities": []}, {"sentenceId": "1791536:0:0", "sentenceText": "", "sentenceStart": 0, "sentenceEnd": 0, "entities": []}]}, "1791537": {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1791537", "title": "Borah High School", "text": "Borah High School is a three-year public secondary school in Boise,  Idaho,  one of four traditional high schools in the Boise School District\\.

This park is operated by Miami-Dade County Parks and Open Spaces Department\\.  The park in itself attracts more than 50, 000 visitors a year because of its unique agricultural environment\\.  The garden features more than 500 different types of international exotic fruits,  vegetables,  herbs,  and spices\\.  Visitors are allowed to sample fallen fruits,  enjoy lunch at the Mango Cafe,  or schedule a tour of the park\\. \nThe Redland area,  part of southern Miami-Dade County,  has always been known for its many farms,  unique ability to grow fresh fruit,  and its reddish soil\\.  Mary Calkins Heinlein was the daughter of pioneer sub-tropical farmers and had always had a passion for fruits and gardens in South Florida\\.  She had a goal to showcase the Redland and its rich agricultural environment\\.  In 1935,  she got in contact with county commissioners and pioneer Parks Director to begin multiple transactions to purchase 18 acres in the Redland\\.  County commissioner Preston B\\.  Bird finalized the deal in 1943 and received ownership for the land with Heinlein\\.  South Date County's Park Development Department signed a contract with William Lyman Philips to develop the vision that Heinlein had for the garden\\.  In 1944,  construction began and Heinlein was named Superintendent\\.  The garden featured many different fruits and agricultural developments that Heinlein had hoped for\\.  It even showcased two historical structures: the original Redland Schoolhouse and a coral rock building\\.  After inspiring the creation of the garden and naming it the Redland Fruit and Spice Park,  Heinlein's 10-year reign ended in 1959 when she retired as Superintendent\\.  She continued to stay an active garden club member and develop insights on the different fruits that should be planted until she died in 1979\\.  In memory of her and Preston B\\.  Bird,  the county renamed the Redland Fruit and Spice Park to the Preston B\\.
