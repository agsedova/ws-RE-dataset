After beginning her club career with Wolves, Unitt began a long association with Everton in 2000. This was intersected by a three-year spell at Fulham between 2001 and 2004 and a summer on loan to New Jersey Wildcats in 2005. She left Everton in 2012 for a two-year stint at Birmingham City and later played for Notts County in 2014. A sturdy left back, Unitt has won over 100 caps for the England women's national football team since her debut in August 2000. She represented England at the 2001, 2005 and 2009 editions of the UEFA Women's Championship as well as at the FIFA Women's World Cup in 2007 and 2011. She was ruled out of both the 2013 UEFA Women's Championship and the Great Britain squad for the 2012 London Olympics due to injury. In 2004 and 2006 Unitt was named The Football Association's (FA) International Player of the Year. In 2016, she was inducted into the English Football Hall of Fame at the National Football Museum.\n\nUnitt started her footballing career with Wolves Women as a 14-year-old. She joined Everton Ladies for 2000–01, before signing a professional contract with Fulham L.F.C. the following season. After a successful spell at Fulham, she returned to Everton in 2004. Her achievements to date include winning the domestic treble with Fulham in the 2002–03 season and the 2010 FA Women's Cup with Everton.\n\nIn July 2005, Unitt joined American W-League side New Jersey Wildcats for the last seven games of their season, teaming up with England and former Fulham teammate Rachel Yankey. The Wildcats eventually won the W-League championship, beating the Ottawa Fury Women by 3–0 in the championship match with Unitt scoring the first goal. Unitt also trained with Malmö FF in December 2005, but, fearing burn-out, rejected a contract offer from the Swedish club.\n\nWith Everton dormant ahead of the 2011 FA WSL season, Unitt played for Leeds City Vixens in the FA Women's Premier League Cup.\n\nAt the end of the 2011 FA WSL season, Unitt put in a transfer request after eight years at Everton. Following negotiations a move to Birmingham City was announced in February 2012. After her time at the club was disrupted by injury, Unitt rejected Birmingham's offer of a contract extension in January 2014 and left the club as a free agent. She signed for Notts County on 30 January 2014, only to suffer an injury to the cruciate ligament in her other knee during the 2014 FA WSL season. In December 2014 she agreed to stay with Notts County, combining her rehabilitation with a place on the club's coaching staff.\n\nIn 2016, Unitt played for Solihull Moors L.F.C., a women's football club in the West Midlands, in the FA Women's Premier League.\n\nUnitt first played for England in 2000, after 16 appearances for the U18s. Her senior debut came in August 2000, in a 1–0 friendly defeat to France, before 50,000 spectators at Stade Vélodrome. She scored her first international goal in England’s victory over the Netherlands in September 2004, and scored twice more in her home town of Walsall during England's 4–1 friendly win over the Czech Republic in May 2005.\n\nUnitt was named the Nationwide International Player of the Year at the 2004 The FA Women's Football Awards. She won the same award in 2006, voted for by the fans on the FA website.\n\nIn May 2009, Unitt was one of the first 17 female players to be given central contracts by The Football Association.\n\nAt the 2007 FIFA Women's World Cup in China, Unitt was the only outfield member of the England squad who remained unused. On the occasion of her 90th cap, she eventually made a World Cup debut in June 2011, starting England's 1–1 draw with Mexico in Wolfsburg. In March 2012 a Euro 2013 qualifier in Croatia saw Unitt win her 100th international cap. Captain for the day, Unitt scored England's third goal in a 6–0 victory, with a diving header.\n\nA foot injury kept Unitt out of contention for a place in the Great Britain squad for the 2012 London Olympics. During her absence Steph Houghton became the first choice left–back for the national team. In May 2013 Unitt suffered an anterior cruciate ligament injury in Birmingham's 1–1 FA WSL Cup draw with Lincoln, which ruled her out of UEFA Women's Euro 2013.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2057086", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2057086", "title": "Flattop", "text": "Flattop\n\nA \"flattop\" is a type of short haircut where the hair on the top of the head is usually standing upright and cut to form a flat-appearing deck. This deck may be level, or it may be upward or downward sloping. This type of haircut is usually performed with electric clippers, either freehand or using the clipper-over-comb method.\n\nWhen a flattop is viewed from the front, varying degrees of squarish appearance are achieved by the design of the upper sides as they approach and round or angle on to the flat deck. Possibilities are somewhat limited by skull shape, the density of the hair and the diameter of the individual shafts of hair, but may include: boxy upper sides with rounded corners; boxy upper sides with sharp corners; rounded upper sides with rounded corners; rounded upper sides with sharp corners. The hair on the sides and back of the head is usually tapered short, semi-short, or medium.\n\nA flattop might be graduated in length on the top of the head from one and a half inches at the front hairline to about a quarter inch at the crown to a half inch as it starts curving down the back of the head, tapering to the skin near the middle of the ears. A variant form known by several names including flattop with fenders and flat top boogie has long sides known as fenders with or without a ducktail. \n\nFlattops are traditionally groomed with hair control wax, commonly referred to as butch wax. Certain hair textures do not require waxes or straighteners to maintain their hold. Since the haircut is short and quickly grows out of its precisely-cut shape, maintenance haircuts are required at least every few weeks, and some flattop wearers get haircuts as often as once a week.\n\nThe flattop has maintained a contingent of dedicated wearers since it was introduced. It was very popular in the 1950s, but faded in popularity with the emergence of longer hair styles in the late 1960s and 1970s. It had a brief reappearance in the 1980s and early 1990s, before dropping off again.\n\nThe haircut is usually done with electric clippers utilizing the clipper over comb technique, though it can also be cut shears over comb or freehand with a clipper. Some barbers utilize large combs designed for cutting flattops. Others use wide rotary clipper blades specifically designed for freehand cutting the top of a flattop. \n\nWhen cutting a new flattop or when cutting a flattop with full boxy or boxy rounded upper sides or a flattop with fenders, the hair at the upper sides and top has to be boxed in. If the hair on the upper sides is initially contoured, it may not be possible to achieve a squarish effect. The hair at the crown is cut from about one quarter to one half inch while the barber stands behind the patron. He then positions himself in front and cuts the top hair to about two inches in length and then to the desired height across the top from side to side while progressing back to the shorter hair at the crown. \n\nThe exact lengths are dependent on skull shape and the style of flat top. Intricate cutting of the deck and upper sides follows to achieve a specific inclination and squarish effect. Natural skull shape and certain deck inclinations and heights often leave an area at the center top of the head where the scalp is visible through the hair. This area is called a \"landing strip\", a metaphor for the landing strip on the deck of a flattop (aircraft carrier). Some flattops are designed to cause a landing strip to show to varying degrees.\n\n\n\n"}

The first was the frigate \"Esmeralda\" captured from the Spanish at Callao, Peru, by Admiral Lord Thomas Alexander Cochrane of the Chilean Navy, in a bold incursion on the night of 5 November 1820. The second was the corvette \"Esmeralda\" of the Chilean Navy which, set against superior forces, fought until sunk with colors flying on 21 May 1879 at the Battle of Iquique. These events mark important milestones for the Chilean Navy and the ship's name is said to evoke its values of courage and sacrifice.\n\nConstruction began in Cádiz, Spain, in 1946. She was intended to become Spain's national training ship. During her construction in 1947 the yard in which she was being built suffered catastrophic explosions, which damaged the ship and placed the yard on the brink of bankruptcy. Work on the ship was temporarily halted. In 1950 Chile and Spain entered into negotiations in which Spain offered to repay debts incurred to Chile as a result of the Spanish Civil War in the form of manufactured products, including the not yet completed \"Esmeralda\". Chile accepted the offer and the ship was formally transferred to the ownership of Chile in 1951. Work then continued on the ship. She was finally launched on 12 May 1953 before an audience of 5,000 people. She was christened by Mrs. Raquel Vicuña de Orrego using a bottle wrapped in the national colors of Spain and Chile. She was delivered as a four-masted topsail schooner to the Government of Chile on 15 June 1954, Captain Horacio Cornejo Tagle in command.\n\nHer sister ship is the training ship for the Spanish Navy, the four-masted topsail schooner . Sometime in the 1970s \"Esmeralda's\" rigging was changed to a four-masted barquentine by replacing the fore gaffsail (course sail) by two main staysails. The third (top) main staysail is still in place. She has now five staysails, three topsails, six jibbs, three course gaff sails, four square sails, 21 all in all.\n\nHer first voyage was to the Canary Islands and then on to New Orleans, where a distillation plant was installed. She then proceeded through the Panama Canal and arrived at Valparaíso on 1 September 1954 to much fanfare.\n\nSince her commissioning, \"Esmeralda\" has been a training ship for the Chilean Navy. She has visited more than 300 ports worldwide acting as a floating embassy for Chile. She participated in Operation Sail at New York City in 1964, 1976 and 1986, and the Osaka World Sail in 1983. She also participated in International Regattas of Sail in 1964, 1976, 1982 and 1990 winning the coveted Cutty Sark Trophy in the last two participations.\n\nIn 2016, Esmeralda visited New Zealand to participate in the 75th Anniversary Celebrations of the foundation of the Royal New Zealand Navy (RNZN)\n\nIn 2019, Esmeralda visited Singapore in light of the APEC Chile 2019.\n\nReports from Amnesty International, the US Senate and Chilean Truth and Reconciliation Commission describe the ship as a kind of a floating jail and torture chamber for political prisoners of the Augusto Pinochet regime from 1973 to 1980. It is claimed that probably over a hundred persons were kept there at times and subjected to hideous treatment, among them British priest Michael Woodward, who later died as a result of torture.\n\nDue to this dark part of its history, the international voyages of the Esmeralda are often highly controversial - especially at the time when Pinochet was still in power but even after the restoration of Chilean democracy. The ship's arrival in various ports is accompanied by protests and demonstrations by local political groups and Chilean left-wing political exiles. Such protest actions were recorded, among other places, at Amsterdam, Dartmouth, Quebec, Vancouver and Victoria, British Columbia, Wellington, Piraeus and Haifa, as well as at Santiago in Chile itself.\n\n\n\n"}

The \"Parkway\" name signifies that the station is a distance from Tiverton town itself: it is actually located in the civil parish of Burlescombe, near Sampford Peverell, to the east of Tiverton itself, and close to the junction of the M5 motorway with the A361 North Devon link road. It is from via .\n\nThe station is operated by Great Western Railway and is also served by CrossCountry trains.\n\nThe Bristol and Exeter Railway opened on 1 May 1844 but it ran south of Tiverton, so a station known as \"Tiverton Road\" was opened to serve the town. This station was renamed \"Tiverton Junction\" on 12 June 1848 when the Tiverton branch line was opened to a station in the town itself. By the 1980s the branch had closed and the Junction station only saw a couple of trains in each direction each day, while cars on the M5 sped past just a few yards from the platforms, so a decision was taken to relocate the station a short distance to the east, close to the motorway junction where traffic from Barnstaple and Ilfracombe from the A361 joined.\n\nTiverton Junction closed on 11 May 1986 and the new station was opened the following day by David Mitchell MP, the Minister of Transport at the time. It was built by British Rail on the site of the former Sampford Peverell railway station that had closed on 5 October 1964.\n\nAn additional car park for the station was opened in late 2007 as the original car park was too small when FGW increased the services to the station. The additional car park is situated alongside (but not accessed by) the A361 road and requires a short walk to the station, while the original is alongside the platform.\n\nThe main entrance and a large car park are on the west side of the station, where a single-storey brick building at platform level incorporates a ticket office and a shop selling newspapers, drinks and snacks. This is the platform for trains towards London Paddington, Bristol Temple Meads and the north.\n\nAccess to the platform for trains towards Exeter, Plymouth and Penzance is over a ramped footbridge. The buildings on this platform are two large metal and glass waiting shelters.

This was particularly evident in early 2014 when a storm breached the sea wall at Dawlish causing disruption to train services west of Exeter; a coach park was built to accommodate the coaches used for this.\n\n"}

The show was produced by Touchstone Television and ran for two seasons on The WB from September 29, 1999 to May 18, 2001.\n\nBrooke McQueen (Leslie Bibb) and Sam McPherson (Carly Pope), students at Jacqueline Kennedy High School, are polar opposites. Brooke is a popular cheerleader and Sam is an unpopular journalist. Their respective groups are forced to socialize when Brooke's father and Sam's mother get engaged and the two girls have to share a house.\n\nThe plot of the first season revolves around the girls' school life, rival groups of friends, mutual animosity and plan to separate their parents. At the end of the season, Sam finds Brooke's real mother and encourages her to come back to town, which breaks up the engagement and splits the new family apart.\n\nBy the second season, Brooke and Sam realize that their parents were happy together, and therefore team up to reunite them, a move which results in the girls slowly becoming close friends, and even referring to each other as \"family\", though tensions rise when they both get involved with the same boy. Also, a reversal of fortunes takes place, with Brooke resigning from cheerleading to focus on school issues and Sam experiencing a surge of sudden popularity at school. In the end of the second-season finale — which turned out to be the unexpected series finale when the show was cancelled — Brooke is run over by a drunk and angry Nicole Julian (Tammy Lynn Michaels).\n\n\n\nThe complete series of \"Popular\" has been released on DVD in region 1 by Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment. The DVD versions of select episodes had to change several songs that were used in the original aired episodes to stock music due to licensing fees. Shows like \"Daria\", \"Mission Hill\", \"Grosse Point\" and other television series also went through similar situations where their DVD and streaming (ex. Netflix, Hulu) counterparts used stock music as a replacement in order to cut costs of using other artists' music.\n\nThe show's main opening theme was excerpted from the song \"Supermodels\", a track from indie singer-songwriter Kendall Payne's 1999 album \"Jordan's Sister\". Ending theme song is \n\"High School Highway\" by Sydney Forest.\n\nSeason 1\nSeason 2\n\nIn 2012, \"Entertainment Weekly\" listed \"Popular\" at #21 in their list of the \"26 Best Cult TV Shows Ever\", calling it \"the proto-\"Glee\"\" and saying it \"celebrated the value of outcasts and portrayed overplayed topics—Homecoming Court, sex, and secrets—through an absurdist lens.\"\n\nIn February 2000, the casts of \"Popular\" and \"Freaks and Geeks\" competed against each other in a special celebrity week of \"Family Feud\" hosted by Louie Anderson.\n\nLeslie Bibb and Carly Pope appeared in \"Grosse Pointe\" (episode 6) as actresses from \"Popular\" in a volleyball game against Johnny and Courtney.\n\nIn 2012, several of the main actors reunited and raised $30,000 for AIDS Walk in Los Angeles.\n\n"}

It was released on May 23, 2006, as a replacement for Socket 939.\n\nAM2 processors are incompatible with 939 motherboards and vice versa, and although it has 940 pins, it is incompatible with Socket 940. Socket AM2 supports DDR2 SDRAM memory but not DDR memory, which the previous Socket 939 supported. AnandTech reported that Socket AM2 system performance was only about 7% faster than Socket 939 equivalents, with most applications about 2% faster, despite having over 30% greater memory bandwidth due to DDR2 support.\n\nThe first processor cores to support socket AM2 were the single-core Orleans (Athlon 64) and Manila (Sempron), and the dual-core Windsor (Athlon 64 X2 and Athlon 64 FX). Most processors on Socket AM2 include SSE3 instructions and were developed with 90 nanometer technology, while later models featured 65 nanometer technology.\n\nSocket AM2 also supports newer AMD Phenom processors, which were originally built for Socket AM2+ but backward compatible with AM2, however, this depended upon the system/motherboard manufacturer to supply a BIOS firmware update to operate the processor.\n\nSocket AM2 was a part of AMD's generation of CPU sockets that included Socket F for servers and Socket S1 for mobile computing.\n\nThere are also single-socket Opteron processors available for AM2.\n\nWhile technical documentation was readily available for earlier generations of AMD processor sockets, the AM2 Processor Functional Data Sheet (AMD document number 31117) has not been made publicly available.\n\nThe 4 holes for fastening the heatsink to the motherboard are placed in a rectangle with lateral lengths of 48 mm and 96 mm for AMD's sockets Socket AM2, Socket AM2+, Socket AM3, Socket AM3+ and Socket FM2. Cooling solutions should therefore be interchangeable.\n\nMultiple sockets have been announced which are in theory pin-compatible with socket AM2, but which differ in terms of features.\n\n\nSocket AM2+ is an intermediate successor to socket AM2, which features split power planes, and HyperTransport 3.0. Socket AM2+ chips can plug into a socket AM2 motherboard (although certain motherboard manufacturers do not support this), but operate only with HyperTransport 2.0.\n\n\nSocket AM3 processors are able to run on Socket AM2 and AM2+ motherboards with appropriate bios updates, but not vice versa. AM3 processors have a new memory controller supporting both DDR2 and DDR3 SDRAM, allowing backwards compatibility with AM2 and AM2+ motherboards.

Each episode featured stories, all of which appeared to defy logic, and some of which were allegedly based on actual events. The viewer was offered the challenge of determining which are true and which are false. At the end of the show, it was revealed to the viewer whether the tales were true or works of fiction.\n\nThe series was hosted by James Brolin in season one and by Jonathan Frakes in seasons two, three and four. The show was narrated by Don LaFontaine for the first three seasons and by Campbell Lane for the fourth and final season.\n\nThe stories told in the program all had some connection with the supernatural, ghosts, psychic phenomena, coincidences, destiny, and/or with other such unusual occurrences.\n\nEach episode of the show, as well as all stories within, were introduced with a pun or some other form of witticism pertaining to the particular story and episode, and they all included the underlying moral that not everything we perceive as truth and falsehood is as such, and that it can often be difficult to truly separate fact from fiction, hence the show's title. In the Frakes era, the intros were filmed on a set resembling the interior of a Victorian mansion.\n\nEach episode typically featured four stories, at least one of which was true and at least one of which was a complete fabrication. The majority of true stories on the show were based on first-hand research conducted by author Robert Tralins, while many of the ones that turned out to be fiction were simply modern-dressed re-telling of urban legends.\n\nFrom season two onwards Jonathan Frakes would end each story with a pun related to the story, for comical effect.\n\n\"Beyond Belief: Fact or Fiction\" has gained a cult following. The show was often aired sporadically, sometimes going for weeks or even months between airings. There is a two-year lag between Don LaFontaine and Campbell Lane's stints as narrator for the show, during which time it was believed that it had been cancelled, only for it to be brought back for another season in the summer of 2002. It was eventually cancelled after its 2002 season. During his stint as narrator, Lane played the character John August in the Season 4 segment 'The Cigar Box'.\n\nIn Germany, where \"Beyond Belief: Fact or Fiction\" is known as \"X-Factor: Das Unfassbare\" (\"The Unfathomable\"), the show was especially successful and still has a cult following. This led to the \"X-Factor\" brand being extended to other shows: \"The Paranormal Borderline\" became \"X-Factor: Die fünfte Dimension\" (\"The Fifth Dimension\"), \"X-Factor: Wahre Lügen\" (\"True Lies\") is a German series, and \"Scariest Places on Earth\" became \"X-Factor: Die wahre Dimension der Angst\" (\"The Real Dimension of Fear\").\n\nStarting on 4 November 2018, to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the series' premiere in Germany, RTL II produced two special episodes under the name \"X-Factor: Das Unfassbare kehrt zurück (The Unfathomable Returns)\", hosted by Detlef Bothe. However, this revival was heavily panned by audiences due to the much poorer quality in comparison to the original.\n\nEach episode featured five stories, all of which defied logic, but some of which were based on actual events. The viewer was offered the challenge of determining which were true and which were false. At the end of the show, it was revealed to the viewer which tales were true (the stories bolded on this list) and which ones were works of fiction.\n\nOf the 225 stories told over the course of the 45 episodes, 132 (59%) were revealed to be \"fact.\" Each episode of the series' run had at least one \"fiction\" story and at least two \"fact\" stories.\n\n<onlyinclude></onlyinclude>\n\nDuring its final run of Fox, the series was picked up for reruns by the Sci-fi Channel and ran from July 2002 to August 2005.

This led to the election of Mohammad Ali Rajai, the previous prime minister, winning 13,001,761 votes out of the 14,573,803 votes cast, which was 89% of the votes. The vote turnout was 65.29%.\n\nRajai was killed a few weeks later on 30 August 1981, together with his prime minister, Mohammad Javad Bahonar.\n\nIn 1981, Iran experienced two elections. The first election of 1981 took place on July 24. The reason for the July election was due to the impeachment of the President of Iran, Abolhassan Bani-Sadr (r. February 5, 1980- June 20, 1981).\n\nAfter the Iranian Revolution in 1979, Bani-Sadr became the first president of Iran on February 5, 1980. He also claimed the role of Supreme Commander. The Majlis, Iran’s parliament, impeached Bani-Sadr. Bani-Sadr was impeached due to allegations stating he was attempting to undermine clerical power in Iran. Ayatollah Khomeini was at the top of these allegations since he was the Supreme Leader and a marja' (someone of high clerical ranking in Shi'i Islam) in Iran. It is important to note that in Iran, the supreme leader has more power than the president, Bani-Sadr was allegedly trying to undermine Iran’s top figure, Khomeini. After Bani-Sadr was found in hiding, he and his followers fled to France or were exiled (this information varies by source).\n\nMohammad-Ali Raja’i was Prime Minister in Iran prior to the impeachment of Bani-Sadr. After the impeachment of Bani-Sadr, Iran set up the Presidency Council, which was made up of three men: Prime Minister Mohammed Ali Raja’i, Speaker of Parliament Hojatolislam Hashemi Rafsanjani, and Chief Justice and head of the Islamic Republican Party Ayatollah Mohammed Beheshti. Raja’i took over the day-to-day part of the presidency until the election was held.  \n\nIn Iran, presidential candidates must be approved by the Guardian Council. 71 Iranians applied for the presidency, but only four were allowed to run. This election saw an approximate 64.24% turnout of eligible voters, or 14,573,803 out of 22,687,017 registered voters. All candidates ran under the Islamic Republican Party because Iran more or less banned all other political parties except for the Islamic Republican Party. The Islamic Republican Party was the leading party in Iran. As for the Islamic Republican Party itself, it was founded in 1979 by Iranians of high clerical status and approved by Khomeini. The party was founded within revolutionary spirits, and its purpose was to continue the revolutionary agenda. The Islamic Republican Party would rally, purge, and overthrow any organization or person that was counterrevolutionary.\n\nAll of the candidates were revolutionaries. Mohammad-Ali Raja’i was (the first) Prime Minister of Iran prior to the impeachment of Bani-Sadr, then he was part of the committee that fulfilled the presidency until the election. The runner up, Abbas Sheybani, was an Iranian politician, and still is today. Seyed Akbar Parvaresh was a descendant of the Prophet Mohammed, as well as an Iranian politician. Habibollah Asgaroladi-Mosalman was also an Iranian politician.\n\nRaja’i was sworn in as president on August 15, 1981. The presidency of the former Prime Minister did not last long. On August 30, 1981, Raja’i and Mohammad-Javad Ba-Honar, the succeeding Prime Minister, were assassinated in a bombing. After Raja’i’s assassination, the next presidential election took place October 2, 1981. Voter turnout increased by 2,000 plus voters in the October Elections, resulting in 74.26% of eligible voters participating in the election. Ayatollah Khamenei was elected President of Iran, receiving 94.4% of the votes. Khamenei was president from 1981-1989.\n"}

He served twice as Director General of Police (DGP) for the state of Punjab, India, where he is credited with having brought the Punjab insurgency under control. While many see him as a hero, there are accusations that he and the forces under his command were responsible for human rights violations \"in the name of stamping out terrorism.\" Gill retired from the IPS in 1995.\n\nGill was an author, editor, speaker, consultant on counter-terrorism, and served as president of the Institute for Conflict Management and president of the Indian Hockey Federation (IHF).\n\nGill joined the Indian Police Service in 1958 and was assigned to the Assam and Meghalaya states in northeast India.\n\nIn the early 1980s, Gill served as Inspector General of Police in Assam. Vinayak Ganapathy, writing for rediff.com in 2003, noted \"Gill's no-nonsense style of functioning, which earned him the sobriquet 'supercop' in Punjab, made him unpopular among influential sections of the population\" in Assam and called him \"a controversial figure\". While Director General of police in Assam, Gill was charged with kicking a demonstrator to death, but was acquitted by the Delhi High Court. Gill lived in the northeast region of India for 28 years, returning to his home state of Punjab in 1984.\n\nHe has been called a \"supercop\", for his work in Punjab, where he was the Director General of Police\n\nDuring this era when Sikh extremists in the Khalistan movement were active in Punjab, there were reports of human rights violations in the Punjab region.\nAmnesty International reported that, from 1983 to 1994, armed groups struggling to form an independent Sikh state, assassinating perpetrators of the 1984 Sikh pogroms or Congress Party members, and taking hostages. It further reported that the police responded with a \"crackdown\", illegally detaining, torturing and killing \"hundreds of young men\".\nHuman Rights Watch (HRW) reported that from the 1980s Sikh separatists were guilty of targeted assassinations and attacks upon Hindu minorities in the Punjab state.\nHRW also reported that the government response resulted in further serious human rights violations against \"tens of thousands\". HRW report in 1991 described the security forces using “increasingly brutal methods to stem the militant movement, resulting in widespread human rights violations.” Thousands of civilians and suspected militants were summarily executed in staged \"encounter\" killings. Many \"disappeared\" while in police custody and thousands were detained without trial and subjected to torture. The post-1991 period coincides with Gill’s second tenure as Director General of Punjab police. It is this period that witnessed the most serious escalation of violence.\n\nIn May 1988, he commanded Operation Black Thunder to flush out militants hiding in the Golden Temple.\nCompared to Operation Blue Star, little damage was inflicted on the Golden Temple.\nIn what was reported as a successful operation, around 67 Sikhs surrendered and 43 were killed in the encounter.\nGill stated that he did not want to repeat the mistakes made by Indian army during Operation Blue Star.\nIn contrast to prior operations, minimum force was used under full public scrutiny.\n\n1991 saw the peak of violence in Punjab, with more than 5000 reported killed. In 1992, the Indian government, \"intent on retaking Punjab from terrorism\", appointed Gill as Chief of Police in Punjab. The police and army instituted a crackdown, and in 1993 the reported death toll was less than 500. In 1993, \"The New York Times\" reported, the people of Punjab no longer feared the Sikh \"rebels or gangs\", but instead feared the army and police. Patricia Gossman describes Gill as having a “goal to eliminate, not merely arrest, militant Sikh leaders and members. KPS Gill also expanded a bounty system of rewards for police who killed known militants – a practice that encouraged the police to resort to extrajudicial executions and disappearances.” The police were awarded financially for killing militants. “India’s central government created a special fund to finance Punjab’s death squads, to pay the network of informants who provided information about militants and those suspected of supporting militants, and to reward police who captured and killed them”. The reward was about 50,000 rupees ($1,670). In an article in \"India Today\" on 15 October 1992 it was written that \"the rush of claiming cash rewards is turning police into mercenaries. Besides the rewards for killing militants (annual outlay for the purpose: Rs 1.13 crore [$338,000]), the department gives 'unannounced rewards' for killing unlisted militants\".\n\nJaswant Singh Khalra was a human rights activist who was taken into custody by Punjab Police on 6 September 1995. Human Rights Watch reported that an 11 September 1995 writ of habeas corpus from the Supreme Court was presented to Gill, and officials denied that police had detained him. (2005 testimony by Special Police Officer Kuldeep Singh indicated that Gill later visited Khalra in October 1995, a few days before Khalra was killed.)\n\nUnder Gill the scope of tracking down and arresting militants went beyond Punjab to other parts of India. “There were several reports during 1993 that Punjab police \"hit teams\" were pursuing alleged Sikh militants in other parts of India. On 17 May, one such team raided an apartment in Calcutta looking for alleged militant Lakshmi Singh. According to neighbours, Punjab police commandos broke into the apartment early that morning, shot Singh and his wife in their bedroom, then fled with the bodies. The government of West Bengal lodged a protest with the Punjab government, but no disciplinary action was reported against the police commandos\".\n\nGill founded the Institute for Conflict Management (ICM) and was its first president.\n\nGill began advising governments on counter-terrorism matters.\n\nIn 1997, the Chief minister of Assam state, Prafulla Kumar Mahanta, requested his services as security advisor.\nHowever, since the sexual harassment case against him was pending he was not able to take this appointment.\n\nIn 1999, Delhi Police arrested Richhpal Singh, who was allegedly a Babbar Khalsa suicide bomber on a mission to assassinate Gill.\nHe arrived in Delhi from Pakistan on an Afghan passport.\nTwo kilograms of the explosive RDX, four detonators, and some \"live wire\" were recovered from him.\nIn an interview after this incident, Gill claimed that he had been a target of four or five such assassination attempts by Babbar Khalsa and other Sikh militant groups. Gill stated that he was not afraid.\n\nIn 2000 the government of Sri Lanka sought his expertise as an anti-terrorism expert to help them draw a comprehensive counter-terrorism strategy against Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam He was approached by Lakshman Kadirgamar who was the foreign minister of Sri Lanka After the defeat of Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam the similarity in the tactics used by Sri Lanka with the tactics used by Gill in Punjab was noted in an article published in India Today\n\nGill was appointed security adviser to the state of Gujarat after 2002 Gujarat violence. Gujarat Chief minister Narendra Modi, commenting on his appointment, stated “It is good to have an experienced person such as Gill as my security advisor. Gill had very effectively tackled the Punjab terrorism problem.” He requested deployment of 1,000 extra specially-trained riot police from Punjab state to combat the violence. He was credited with controlling violence after his appointment. He arrived in Gujarat on 3 May 2002 He subsequently blamed a \"small group\" of people for the Gujarat riots.\n\nIn April 2003, there was a report that Gill was being considered for the position of governor of Assam. The Northeast Study Group, of which Gill is a member, had advised against assigning a state's previous security personnel to a state as governor. The Chief minister of Assam agreed.\n\nMartin Regg Cohn argued in a \"Toronto Star\" editorial that policies followed in Punjab by Gill should be utilised in fighting the Taliban in Afghanistan.\nAn academic paper, \"The Gill Doctrine: A Model for 21st Century Counterterrorism?\", analysing his tactics in the successful fight against the Punjab insurgency was presented at the annual meeting of American Political Science Association on 30 August 2007.\n\nThe government of Chhattisgarh state in India appointed him a security adviser to help control Naxalites in 2006. After an attack by Naxalites killed 55 policemen in 2007 Gill commented that the issue was one of \"underdevelopment in police forces. The state policy was to leave these tribal areas alone and that gave Naxalites a base. There used to be just 3,000 police for an area the size of Switzerland. That is now changing but it will take time. But yes, it is a winnable war.\".\n\nIn March 2008, India's hockey team failed to qualify for the Olympics for the first time since the team's debut in 1928.\nNarender Batra, one of 11 IHF vice presidents, on resigning his position over the failure to qualify, accused Gill of \"autocratic functioning\", and called on the entire IHF staff to step down. Gill responded that the critics were \"professional mourners\" who were proud to \"run down the establishment\", and stated \"I will respond to these things at a later stage. We do not have an instant coffee machine that you can get results instantly.\"\nAlok Sinha, writing for \"India Times\", noted that the top two executives, Gill and the Secretary-General, did not even talk to one another.\nThere were rumours that the secretary general of the IHF, leader of the anti-Gill faction, would also resign.\n\nLess than a month after the qualification failure, in April 2008, Aaj Tak Television reported that it had caught the Secretary-General of the IHF taking a bribe on camera to choose a player in a \"sting\". There were renewed calls for Gill to resign.\n\nAfter the allegations of corruption, the Indian Olympic Association (IOA) suspended the IHF indefinitely on 28 April 2008. IOA president Suresh Kalmadi said in a press conference that \"We have great respect for K P S Gill and it is not personal.\"\n\nAs of September 2009, Gill remained president of the Institute for Conflict Management. As of July 2009, he was also winding up the affairs of the suspended Indian Hockey Federation as it merged with its replacement, Hockey India.\n\nAn Indian Administrative Service (IAS) female officer named Rupan Deol Bajaj filed a complaint against Gill for, in 1988, \"patting\" her \"posterior\" at a party where he was alleged to be drunk. In August 1996, he was convicted under Section 354 (outraging the modesty of a woman) and Section 509 (word, gesture or act intended to insult a lady), generally summarised as sexual harassment. \n\nGill was sentenced to pay a fine of Rs 200,000 and to suffer three months rigorous imprisonment, followed by two months' ordinary imprisonment, and finally to serve three years of probation. \n\nAfter final appeals before the Supreme Court in July 2005, the conviction was upheld but the jail sentences were reduced to probation. The victim had declined to accept the monetary compensation, and the court ordered that it be donated to women's organisations.\n\nGill was an outspoken critic of the Indian Government's handling of national security issues. He blamed it for \"soft nature and under-preparedness\", and argues that policy was formed without input from anti-terrorism experts, and that the country lacked a national security policy.\n\nGill received a Padma Shri award, India's fourth-highest civilian honour, in 1989 for his work in the civil service.\n\nGill wrote his first book \"Punjab: The Knights of Falsehood\" in 1997 (reprinted in 2008 in paperback), covering the Punjab insurgency . The book received positive reception in the Press and was deemed to provide a \"great degree of authenticity\" to the narrative of the events. However, his political coverage was criticised as placing too much responsibility for the insurgency on the Akali Dal, while absolving the Indian National Congress.\n\nGill was editor of the quarterly journal of the ICM, \"Faultlines: Writings on Conflict and Resolution\" and also wrote the ICM website, South Asia Terrorism Portal.\n\nHe edited the 2001 book \"Terror And Containment: Perspectives on India's Internal Security\" with Ajai Sahni. With Sahni, he also co-authored \"The Global Threat of Terror:Ideological, Material & Political Linkages\".\n\nOther books published by Gill are\n\nKanwar Pal Singh Gill was admitted to Sir Ganga Ram Hospital in Delhi on 10 May 2017. He had been suffering from peritonitis but died of sudden cardiac arrest due to cardiac arrhythmia on 26 May 2017.\n\n\n"}

Salvatore. The books are \"The Crystal Shard\", \"Streams of Silver\" and \"The Halfling's Gem\". They tell the tale of ranger Drizzt Do'Urden the drow (or dark elf), Wulfgar the barbarian warrior, Regis the halfling, dwarf king Bruenor, and Bruenor's adopted human daughter Catti-brie. It is the first of Salvatore's \"Forgotten Realms\" novels, describing the events that created some of the best-known characters in that world. The final book of this series, \"The Halfling's Gem\", appeared in \"The New York Times\" Best Seller list.\n\nA prequel trilogy, \"The Dark Elf Trilogy\", followed, as did several subsequent sequel series such as \"Legacy of the Drow\" and \"Paths of Darkness\".\n\n\nIn later years, these and other books featuring the character Drizzt Do'Urden have been rebranded as installments of \"The Legend of Drizzt\", and such publications of the \"Icewind Dale Trilogy\" are identified on their covers as books IV, V and VI of that series.\n\n\nFollowing from the comic adaption of \"The Dark Elf Trilogy\", Devil's Due Publishing continued with the adaptation of \"Crystal Shard\". The second issue (October 2006) reaching 20 and the third issue (December 2006) reaching 18 in the top 100 Independent comic for their respective months.\n\nDevil's Due Publishing announced the individual issues for this series would be collected into a trade paperback with Tyler Walpole serving as the cover artist. The series was adapted by Andrew Dabb and pencilled by Val Semeiks. The trade paperback for \"Streams of Silver\" was ranked 34 in the top 100 Graphic Novels for August 2007 with an estimated pre-order sale quantity of 2,524.\n\nThe final issue of \"Halfling's Gem\" was announced on 18 September 2007 and was shipped in December 2007. The final issue #3 completes the adaptation of \"Dark Elf Trilogy\" and \"Icewind Dale Trilogy\".\n\nThe entire trilogy was ranked 9th in Banophernalia's top 10 books for 2000. In the same site, the series was given 3 stars for \"Crystal Shard\" and 3.5 stars for \"Streams of Silver\" and \"The Halfling's Gem\". It was considered standard enjoyable fantasy fare although clichéd.\n\nIan Strelec, staff reviewer for \"d20zines.com\" awarded \"Streams of Silver\" a B+ rating. Vivid descriptions and good characterisations were praised in the novel; however, he was critical of unrealistic situations as well an overemphasis on combat scenarios.\n\nThe last volume of the trilogy, \"The Halfling's Gem\", was ranked 14th in the \"New York Times\" paperback best sellers' list on 11 March 1990.\n\nPaul Hughes, in an editorial review of the trilogy on Amazon's website, wrote that while the book is not Tolkien it has \"brought legions of enthusiastic fans to the genre\". The reviewer also stated that it is essential for any \"Drizzt true believer\".\n"}

Their music has been compared to that of The Offspring, and they list Bad Religion, NOFX and Lagwagon as musical influences.\n\nIn 1993, Josh Kemble united with Jayce Molina on guitar, Josh Hagquist (of The Beautiful Mistake) on bass, and Billy Nichols on drums to form the band Half-Off. After a few shows, the band decided to find a better name, and a relative suggested \"Dogwood\" in reference to the legend of the dogwood cross.\n\nBy 1996, Dogwood had been signed by the now-defunct Rescue Records label, which was also the home for such bands as P.O.D., No Innocent Victim, and Point Of Recognition. While on Rescue, Dogwood released two studio records, \"Good Ol' Daze\" and \"Through Thick & Thin\". Dogwood andRescue Records parted ways, and then in 1998 the band self-released an eponymous album. This was later re-released without the track \"Never Die\" as \"This is Not a New Album\" on Facedown Records.\n\nThe band caught the eye of Tooth & Nail Records. In 1999, \"More Than Conquerors\" was released, followed by \"Building a Better Me\" in 2000, \"Matt Aragon\" in 2001, and \"Seismic\" in 2003. In 2004, Tooth & Nail released a Dogwood greatest hits album titled \"Reverse, Then Forward Again\".\n\nAccording to their MySpace page, they are currently signed to Roadside Records.\n\nTheir recent show was on October 2011 and the band went inactive. In a Breathecast.com interview, vocalist Josh Kemble told that band never called it quits. He stated, \"I think we just never really did an official farewell tour or breakup and we also haven't played in a really long time. Some people said it's over but we never actually declared that. It's kind of an unspoken, rode off into the sunset type of thing. There's that mystery of reunion or another show,\".\n\nOn November 29, 2016, the band announced their reunion and played shows with MxPx and Five Iron Frenzy on January 13–14, 2017 in Ventura and San Diego, CA. This marked their first show since October 2011 and it featured the lineup of Kemble, O'Donnell, Harper, and Castillo. On December 19, 2017, the band teased a new song \"Titles\", which will be part of Indie Vision Music's \"Family and Friends Sampler\" on December 24.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Source\":\nSan Diego Music Awards Past Winners\n\n\n\n"}

The band started out as a melodic death metal band with singer Terje Buaas, shifting to doom metal, mixing distorted guitars and heavy drumming with clean guitars and vocals from Kari Rueslåtten. The band went on to experiment with genres such as progressive rock, jazz, ambient, folk and electronica.\n\nThe story of the band began in 1990, then known as Nightfall, consisting of Rune Hoemsnes, Trond Engum, Geir Nilsen and Terje Buaas. In 1992, Kari Rueslåtten replaced Buaas and, together with Finn Olav Holthe, they became The 3rd And The Mortal. The band were one of the forerunners of the atmospheric metal scene having been one of the first to have a leading female singer, they inspired bands such as The Gathering, Flowing Tears and Nightwish. Their first EP \"Sorrow\" was released in 1994 followed by the album \"Tears Laid in Earth\" in 1994. After Rueslåtten's departure in 1995 the band had Ann-Mari Edvardsen join as vocalist. With her, the band released full-length albums \"Painting on Glass\" in 1996 and explored an even more experimental sound in 1997 with \"In This Room\".\n\nAfter the departure of Edvardsen and an absence of 5 years, the band returned in 2002 with \"Memoirs\", an album with recordings made during previous years. A new female vocalist was found in Kirsti Huke, who is present on the majority of songs, with second vocalist Andreas Elvenes backing her up on a couple of tracks. \"Memoirs\" differs from previous albums by being more electronics based. After \"Memoirs\", the band did a small tour in Mexico City on July 19, 2002, along with eight shows in Germany and the Netherlands during September and October 2002.\n\nIn 2004, the band released \"EPs And Rarities\". This is a compilation consisting of the \"Sorrow\" and \"Nightswan\" EPs + the b-side of the \"Stream\" single and the bonus-track from the Japanese \"In This Room\" album. In 2005, the band released their last album \"Project Bluebook: Decade of Endeavour\", which is a compilation EP with two new studio tracks, another unreleased song performed live in 1998 and four different live versions of Mortal classics recorded on the European tour in 2002.

{"id": "2057223", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2057223", "title": "Path tracing", "text": "Path tracing\n\nPath tracing is a computer graphics Monte Carlo method of rendering images of three-dimensional scenes such that the global illumination is faithful to reality. Fundamentally, the algorithm is integrating over all the illuminance arriving to a single point on the surface of an object. This illuminance is then reduced by a surface reflectance function (BRDF) to determine how much of it will go towards the viewpoint camera. This integration procedure is repeated for every pixel in the output image. When combined with physically accurate models of surfaces, accurate models of real light sources (light bulbs), and optically correct cameras, path tracing can produce still images that are indistinguishable from photographs.\n\nPath tracing naturally simulates many effects that have to be specifically added to other methods (conventional ray tracing or scanline rendering), such as soft shadows, depth of field, motion blur, caustics, ambient occlusion, and indirect lighting. Implementation of a renderer including these effects is correspondingly simpler. An extended version of the algorithm is realized by volumetric path tracing, which considers the light scattering of a scene.\n\nDue to its accuracy and unbiased nature, path tracing is used to generate reference images when testing the quality of other rendering algorithms. In order to get high quality images from path tracing, a very large number of rays must be traced to avoid visible noisy artifacts.\n\nThe rendering equation and its use in computer graphics was presented by James Kajiya in 1986. Path Tracing was introduced then as an algorithm to find a numerical solution to the integral of the rendering equation. A decade later, Lafortune suggested many refinements, including bidirectional path tracing.\n\nMetropolis light transport, a method of perturbing previously found paths in order to increase performance for difficult scenes, was introduced in 1997 by Eric Veach and Leonidas J. Guibas.\n\nMore recently, CPUs and GPUs have become powerful enough to render images more quickly, causing more widespread interest in path tracing algorithms. Tim Purcell first presented a global illumination algorithm running on a GPU in 2002. In February 2009 Austin Robison of Nvidia demonstrated the first commercial implementation of a path tracer running on a GPU , and other implementations have followed, such as that of Vladimir Koylazov in August 2009. This was aided by the maturing of GPGPU programming toolkits such as CUDA and OpenCL and GPU ray tracing SDKs such as OptiX.\n\nPath tracing has played an important role in the film industry. Earlier films had relied in scanline renderers to produce CG visual effects and animation. In 1998, Blue Sky Studios rendered the Academy Award-winning short film \"Bunny\" with their proprietary CGI Studio path tracing renderer, featuring soft shadows and indirect illumination effects. Sony Pictures Imageworks' Monster House was, in 2006, the first animated feature film to be rendered entirely in a path tracer, using the commercial Arnold renderer. Also, Walt Disney Animation Studios has been using its own optimized path tracer known as Hyperion ever since the production of \"Big Hero 6\" in 2014. Pixar Animation Studios has also adopted path tracing for its commercial RenderMan renderer.\n\nKajiya's rendering equation adheres to three particular principles of optics; the Principle of global illumination, the Principle of Equivalence (reflected light is equivalent to emitted light), and the Principle of Direction (reflected light and scattered light have a direction).\n\nIn the real world, objects and surfaces are visible due to the fact that they are reflecting light. This reflected light then illuminates other objects in turn. From that simple observation, two principles follow.\n\nI. For a given indoor scene, every object in the room must contribute illumination to every other object.\n\nII. Second, there is no distinction to be made between illumination emitted from a light source and illumination reflected from a surface.\n\nInvented in 1984, a rather different method called radiosity was faithful to both principles. However, radiosity relates the total illuminance falling on a surface with a uniform luminance that leaves the surface. This forced all surfaces to be Lambertian, or \"perfectly diffuse\". While radiosity received a lot of attention at its invocation, perfectly diffuse surfaces do not exist in the real world. The realization that scattering from a surface depends on both incoming and outgoing directions is the key principle behind the Bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF). This direction dependence was a focus of research resulting in the publication of important ideas throughout the 1990s, since accounting for direction always exacted a price of steep increases in calculation times on desktop computers. Principle III follows.\n\nIII. The illumination coming from surfaces must scatter in a particular direction that is some function of the incoming direction of the arriving illumination, and the outgoing direction being sampled.\n\nKajiya's equation is a complete summary of these three principles, and path tracing, which approximates a solution to the equation, remains faithful to them in its implementation. There are other principles of optics which are not the focus of Kajiya's equation, and therefore are often difficult or incorrectly simulated by the algorithm. Path Tracing is confounded by optical phenomena not contained in the three principles. For example,\n\n\nThe following pseudocode is a procedure for performing naive path tracing. The TracePath function calculates a single sample of a pixel, where only the Gathering Path is considered.\n\nAll the samples are then averaged to obtain the output color. Note this method of always sampling a random ray in the normal's hemisphere only works well for perfectly diffuse surfaces. For other materials, one generally has to use importance-sampling, i.e. probabilistically select a new ray according to the BRDF's distribution. For instance, a perfectly specular (mirror) material would not work with the method above, as the probability of the new ray being the correct reflected ray – which is the only ray through which any radiance will be reflected – is zero. In these situations, one must divide the reflectance by the probability density function of the sampling scheme, as per Monte-Carlo integration (in the naive case above, there is no particular sampling scheme, so the PDF turns out to be 1).\n\nThere are other considerations to take into account to ensure conservation of energy. In particular, in the naive case, the reflectance of a diffuse BRDF must not exceed formula_1 or the object will reflect more light than it receives (this however depends on the sampling scheme used, and can be difficult to get right).\n\nSampling the integral for a point can be done by either of the following two distinct approaches:\n\nBidirectional Path Tracing combines both \"Shooting\" and \"Gathering\" in the same algorithm to obtain faster convergence of the integral. A shooting path and a gathering path are traced independently, and then the head of the shooting path is connected to the tail of the gathering path. The light is then attenuated at every bounce and back out into the pixel. This technique at first seems paradoxically slower, since for every gathering sample we additionally trace a whole shooting path. In practice however, the extra speed of convergence far outweighs any performance loss from the extra ray casts on the shooting side.\n\nA path tracer continuously samples pixels of an image. The image starts to become recognisable after only a few samples per pixel, perhaps 100. However, for the image to \"converge\" and reduce noise to acceptable levels usually takes around 5000 samples for most images, and many more for pathological cases. Noise is particularly a problem for animations, giving them a normally unwanted \"film-grain\" quality of random speckling.\n\nThe central performance bottleneck in Path Tracing is the complex geometrical calculation of casting a ray. Importance Sampling is a technique which is motivated to cast fewer rays through the scene while still converging correctly to outgoing luminance on the surface point. This is done by casting more rays in directions in which the luminance would have been greater anyway. If the density of rays cast in certain directions matches the strength of contributions in those directions, the result is identical, but far fewer rays were actually cast. Importance Sampling is used to match ray density to Lambert's Cosine law, and also used to match BRDFs.\n\nMetropolis light transport can result in a lower-noise image with fewer samples. This algorithm was created in order to get faster convergence in scenes in which the light must pass through odd corridors or small holes in order to reach the part of the scene that the camera is viewing. It has also shown promise in correctly rendering pathological situations with caustics. Instead of generating random paths, new sampling paths are created as slight mutations of existing ones. In this sense, the algorithm \"remembers\" the successful paths from light sources to the camera.\n\nThe reflective properties (amount, direction and colour) of surfaces are modelled using BRDFs. The equivalent for transmitted light (light that goes through the object) are BSDFs. A path tracer can take full advantage of complex, carefully modelled or measured distribution functions, which controls the appearance (\"material\", \"texture\" or \"shading\" in computer graphics terms) of an object.\n\n\n"}

It was here Chief Poundmaker was arrested, and where six Cree and two Stoney men were hanged for their participation in the Frog Lake Massacre and other killings. In reference to the hanging, then Prime Minister Sir John A. Macdonald said in a letter that, \"the executions... ought to convince the Red Man that the White Man governs.\"\n\nIts location near the confluence of the North Saskatchewan and the Battle rivers offered access to fresh water, as it was many years before an on-site well was made available; and offered an alternative means of transportation to the Red River cart. As the site was on a plateau, the fort was easily defensible, and offered clear lines of sight for the surrounding area and to Government Ridge – thus providing warning against possible attacks. The fort sheltered around 500 people, and they helped to fortify Battleford.\n\nBattleford being designated capital of the North-West Territories played a substantial role in the decision to locate the fort there. The government's belief was that the presence of the NWMP would act as a civilizing influence on the First Nations in the area and help them to transition from their nomadic lifestyle to a more stationary one, modelled on European societies. They also hoped that the NWMP would assist settlers in their homesteading efforts and their presence in the area would encourage the people to respect the law.\n\nThe difficulties that had plagued Native American–government relations in the United States, along with the high Aboriginal population in the Battleford area, further prompted the federal government to establish a strong NWMP presence. Both the Canadian government and the First Nations were quite aware of what had transpired south of the \"Medicine Line\" and sought to follow a different path.\n\nThe original Canadian Pacific Railway route was also to pass through Battleford, along the Qu'Appelle route, but it was eventually built on a more southerly route, which resulted in the moving of the capital of the North-West Territories from Battleford to Regina, then known as Pile o' Bones.\n\nIn the spring of 2008, Tourism, Parks, Culture and Sport Minister Christine Tell proclaimed in Duck lake that \"the 125th commemoration, in 2010, of the 1885 Northwest Resistance is an excellent opportunity to tell the story of the prairie Métis and First Nations peoples' struggle with Government forces and how it has shaped Canada today.\"\n\nFort Otter was constructed at Battleford's government house located at the capital of the North-West Territories (1876 and 1883). The largest Canadian mass hanging occurred here when eight First Nations men were executed for murder in the aftermath of the Frog Lake Massacre.\n\nThe fort was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 1923, known as Fort Battleford National Historic Site, to commemorate its role as military base of operations for Cut Knife Hill, Fort Pitt, as a refuge for 500 area settlers and its role in the Siege of Battleford.\n\n"}

UDLD complements the Spanning Tree Protocol which is used to eliminate switching loops.\n\nIf two devices, A and B, are connected via a pair of optical fibers, one used for sending from A to B and other for sending from B to A, the link is bidirectional (two-way). If one of these fibers is broken, the link has become one-way or unidirectional. The goal of the UDLD protocol is to detect a broken bidirectional link (e.g. transmitted packets do not arrive at the receiver, or the fibers are connected to different ports).\n\nFor each device and for each port, a UDLD packet is sent to the port it links to. The packet contains sender identity information (device and port), and expected receiver identity information (device and port). Each port checks that the UDLD packets it receives contain the identifiers of his own device and port.\n\nUDLD is a Cisco-proprietary protocol but HP, Extreme Networks, and AVAYA all have a similar feature calling it by a different name. HP calls theirs Device Link Detection Protocol (DLDP). Extreme Networks call it Extreme Link Status Monitoring (ELSM) and AVAYA calls theirs, Link-state Tracking. \n\nSimilar functionality in a standardized form is provided as part of the Ethernet OAM protocol that is defined as part of the Ethernet in the First Mile changes to 802.3 (previously 802.3ah).

Entities are foundational to the organizational structure and definition of SGML documents. The SGML specification defines numerous entity types, which are distinguished by keyword qualifiers and context. An entity string value may variously consist of plain text, SGML tags, and/or references to previously defined entities. Certain entity types may also invoke external documents. Entities are called by reference.\n\nEntities are classified as general or parameter:\n\nEntities are also further classified as parsed or unparsed:\n\nAn internal entity has a value that is either a literal string, or a parsed string comprising markup and entities defined in the same document (such as a Document Type Declaration or subdocument). In contrast, an external entity has a declaration that invokes an external document, thereby necessitating the intervention of an entity manager to resolve the external document reference.\n\nAn entity declaration may have a literal value, or may have some combination of an optional codice_2 identifier, which allows SGML parsers to process an entity's string referent as a resource identifier, and an optional codice_3 identifier, which identifies the entity independent of any particular representation. In XML, a subset of SGML, an entity declaration may not have a codice_3 identifier without a codice_2 identifier.\n\nWhen an external entity references a complete SGML document, it is known in the calling document as an SGML document entity. An SGML document is a text document with SGML markup defined in an SGML prologue (i.e., the DTD and subdocuments). A complete SGML document comprises not only the document instance itself, but also the prologue and, optionally, the SGML declaration (which defines the document's markup syntax and declares the character encoding).\n\nAn entity is defined via an \"entity declaration\" in a document's document type definition (DTD). For example:\n\n<!ENTITY greeting1 \"Hello world\">\n<!ENTITY greeting2 SYSTEM \"file:///hello.txt\">\n<!ENTITY % greeting3 \"¡Hola!\">\n<!ENTITY greeting4 \"%greeting3; means Hello!\">\n\nThis DTD markup declares the following:\n\nNames for entities must follow the rules for SGML names, and there are limitations on where entities can be referenced.\n\nParameter entities are referenced by placing the entity name between codice_14 and codice_15. Parsed general entities are referenced by placing the entity name between \"codice_16\" and \"codice_15\". Unparsed entities are referenced by placing the entity name in the value of an attribute declared as type ENTITY.\n\nThe general entities from the example above might be referenced in a document as follows:\n\n<content>\n</content>\nWhen parsed, this document would be reported to the downstream application the same as if it has been written as follows, assuming the codice_18 file contains the text codice_19:\n\n<content>\n</content>\nA reference to an undeclared entity is an error unless a default entity has been defined. For example:\n\nAdditional markup constructs and processor options may affect whether and how entities are processed. For example, a processor may optionally ignore external entities.\n\nStandard entity sets for SGML and some of its derivatives have been developed as mnemonic devices, to ease document authoring when there is a need to use characters that are not easily typed or that are not widely supported by legacy character encodings. Each such entity consists of just one character from the Universal Character Set. Although any character can be referenced using a numeric character reference, a character entity reference allows characters to be referenced by name instead of code point.\n\nFor example, HTML 4 has 252 built-in character entities that do not need to be explicitly declared, while XML has five. XHTML has the same five as XML, but if its DTDs are explicitly used, then it has 253 (&apos; being the extra entity beyond those in HTML 4).\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2057290", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2057290", "title": "Tf–idf", "text": "Tf–idf\n\nIn information retrieval, tf–idf or TFIDF, short for term frequency–inverse document frequency, is a numerical statistic that is intended to reflect how important a word is to a document in a collection or corpus. It is often used as a weighting factor in searches of information retrieval, text mining, and user modeling.\nThe tf–idf value increases proportionally to the number of times a word appears in the document and is offset by the number of documents in the corpus that contain the word, which helps to adjust for the fact that some words appear more frequently in general. tf–idf is one of the most popular term-weighting schemes today. A survey conducted in 2015 showed that 83% of text-based recommender systems in digital libraries use tf–idf.\n\nVariations of the tf–idf weighting scheme are often used by search engines as a central tool in scoring and ranking a document's relevance given a user query. tf–idf can be successfully used for stop-words filtering in various subject fields, including text summarization and classification.\n\nOne of the simplest ranking functions is computed by summing the tf–idf for each query term; many more sophisticated ranking functions are variants of this simple model.\n\nSuppose we have a set of English text documents and wish to rank which document is most relevant to the query, \"the brown cow\". A simple way to start out is by eliminating documents that do not contain all three words \"the\", \"brown\", and \"cow\", but this still leaves many documents. To further distinguish them, we might count the number of times each term occurs in each document; the number of times a term occurs in a document is called its \"term frequency\". However, in the case where the length of documents varies greatly, adjustments are often made (see definition below). The first form of term weighting is due to Hans Peter Luhn (1957) which may be summarized as:\nBecause the term \"the\" is so common, term frequency will tend to incorrectly emphasize documents which happen to use the word \"the\" more frequently, without giving enough weight to the more meaningful terms \"brown\" and \"cow\". The term \"the\" is not a good keyword to distinguish relevant and non-relevant documents and terms, unlike the less-common words \"brown\" and \"cow\". Hence an \"inverse document frequency\" factor is incorporated which diminishes the weight of terms that occur very frequently in the document set and increases the weight of terms that occur rarely.\n\nKaren Spärck Jones (1972) conceived a statistical interpretation of term-specificity called Inverse Document Frequency (idf), which became a cornerstone of term weighting:\n\nIn the case of the term frequency , the simplest choice is to use the \"raw count\" of a term in a document, i.e., the number of times that term occurs in document . If we denote the raw count by , then the simplest tf scheme is . Other possibilities include\n\nThe inverse document frequency is a measure of how much information the word provides, i.e., if it's common or rare across all documents. It is the logarithmically scaled inverse fraction of the documents that contain the word (obtained by dividing the total number of documents by the number of documents containing the term, and then taking the logarithm of that quotient):\n\nwith\n\nThen tf–idf is calculated as\n\nA high weight in tf–idf is reached by a high term frequency (in the given document) and a low document frequency of the term in the whole collection of documents; the weights hence tend to filter out common terms. Since the ratio inside the idf's log function is always greater than or equal to 1, the value of idf (and tf–idf) is greater than or equal to 0. As a term appears in more documents, the ratio inside the logarithm approaches 1, bringing the idf and tf–idf closer to 0.\n\nIdf was introduced, as \"term specificity\", by Karen Spärck Jones in a 1972 paper. Although it has worked well as a heuristic, its theoretical foundations have been troublesome for at least three decades afterward, with many researchers trying to find information theoretic justifications for it.\n\nSpärck Jones's own explanation did not propose much theory, aside from a connection to Zipf's law. Attempts have been made to put idf on a probabilistic footing, by estimating the probability that a given document contains a term as the relative document frequency,\n\nso that we can define idf as\n\nNamely, the inverse document frequency is the logarithm of \"inverse\" relative document frequency.\n\nThis probabilistic interpretation in turn takes the same form as that of self-information. However, applying such information-theoretic notions to problems in information retrieval leads to problems when trying to define the appropriate event spaces for the required probability distributions: not only documents need to be taken into account, but also queries and terms.\n\nThe Term Frequency and the Inverse Document Frequency can be formulated using Information theory; it helps to understand why their product have a meaning in terms of joint informational content of a document. A characteristic assumption about the distribution formula_12 is that:\n\nThis assumption and its implications, according to Aizawa: \"represent the heuristic that tf-idf employs.\"\n\nRecall the expression of the Conditional entropy of a \"randomly chosen\" document in the corpus formula_14 conditional to the fact it contains a specific term formula_15 (and assume that all documents have equal probability to be chosen, and small formula_16 being r=probabilities)):\n\nIn terms of notation, formula_18 and formula_19 are \"random variables\" corresponding to respectively draw a document or a term.\nNow recall the definition of the Mutual information and note that it can be expressed as\n\nThe last step is to expand formula_21, the unconditional probability to draw a term, with respect to the (random) choice of a document, to obtain:\n\nThis expression shows that summing the Tf-idf of all possible terms and documents recovers the mutual information between documents and term taking into account all the specificities of their joint distribution (for details, see. Each Tf-idf hence carries the \"bit of information\" attached to a term x document pair.\n\nSuppose that we have term count tables of a corpus consisting of only two documents, as listed on the right.\n\nThe calculation of tf–idf for the term \"this\" is performed as follows:\n\nIn its raw frequency form, tf is just the frequency of the \"this\" for each document. In each document, the word \"this\" appears once; but as the document 2 has more words, its relative frequency is smaller.\n\nAn idf is constant per corpus, and accounts for the ratio of documents that include the word \"this\". In this case, we have a corpus of two documents and all of them include the word \"this\".\n\nSo tf–idf is zero for the word \"this\", which implies that the word is not very informative as it appears in all documents.\n\nThe word \"example\" is more interesting - it occurs three times, but only in the second document:\n\nFinally,\n\n(using the base 10 logarithm).\n\nThe idea behind tf–idf also applies to entities other than terms. In 1998, the concept of idf was applied to citations. The authors argued that \"if a very uncommon citation is shared by two documents, this should be weighted more highly than a citation made by a large number of documents\". In addition, tf–idf was applied to \"visual words\" with the purpose of conducting object matching in videos, and entire sentences. However, the concept of tf–idf did not prove to be more effective in all cases than a plain tf scheme (without idf). When tf–idf was applied to citations, researchers could find no improvement over a simple citation-count weight that had no idf component.\n\nA number of term-weighting schemes have derived from tf–idf. One of them is TF–PDF (Term Frequency * Proportional Document Frequency). TF–PDF was introduced in 2001 in the context of identifying emerging topics in the media. The PDF component measures the difference of how often a term occurs in different domains. Another derivate is TF–IDuF. In TF–IDuF, idf is not calculated based on the document corpus that is to be searched or recommended. Instead, idf is calculated on users' personal document collections. The authors report that TF–IDuF was equally effective as tf–idf but could also be applied in situations when, e.g., a user modeling system has no access to a global document corpus.\n\n\n"}

It runs in a north–south direction linking the state's Eastern Goldfields to the coast.\n\nThe Coolgardie–Norseman stretch (National Highway 94) forms part of the Perth to Adelaide National Highway route and has a higher proportion of heavy traffic. This section passes through an undulating countryside, mainly dotted with patches of trees, scrub and salt lakes. The interstate traffic continues eastwards via Eyre Highway from its junction in Norseman. The Norseman–Esperance portion (National Route 1) is a part of Australia's Highway 1. The scenery changes to agricultural land, and on approach to Esperance it passes near lakes and hillsides.\n\nFollowing the Western Australian gold rushes of the 1890s, a track developed between Coolgardie and Esperance, the closest harbour to the goldfields. A road was constructed along this track in the late 1920s and 1930s. From the late 1930s attention turned to sealing the road, but it took until 1960 before a single-lane seal was constructed between Coolgardie and Esperance. The road was gazetted as Coolgardie–Esperance Highway three years earlier, on 16 August 1957. Further work occurred between 1974 and 1980, providing a two-lane sealed road for the length of the highway.\n\nCoolgardie–Esperance Highway commences at Great Eastern Highway at Coolgardie. It heads south as National Highway 94 to Norseman, the starting point of the interstate route Eyre Highway. Coolgardie–Esperance Highway continues south as National Route 1 to the coastal town of Esperance, at a roundabout with Harbour Road, Fisheries Road, and Norseman Road. Harbour Road is the southernmost section of the highway, a controlled-access bypass of the town linking to South Coast Highway and the Esperance Port.\n\nCoolgardie–Esperance Highway is generally a two-lane single carriageway road, with a speed limit of , except in and around built up areas. Between Coolgardie and Norseman the highway proceeds through \"undulating, timbered, and salt lake country\", while south of Norseman it travels across agricultural land, and on approach to Esperance it passes near lakes and hillsides.

The highest percentage of heavy traffic was 51.6% north of Goldfields Highway.\n\nThe reported safety of Coolgardie–Esperance Highway has varied between assessments. Reports commissioned by the Royal Automobile Club of Western Australia (RAC) in 2006 and 2008 the entire highway a three-star safety rating out of five. The state's overall highway network was generally rated as three-star or four-star, with around 10% in 2006 and 5% in 2008 receiving a two-star rating. The National Highway section was assessed by the Australian Automobile Association in 2011 to be among the lowest risk highways in the country, based on total number of casualty crashes per length of road. However, individual risk based on casualty crash rates per vehicle kilometre travelled was assessed as medium-high. In 2013, that portion of the highway was assessed as having 7% of its length rated as one-star, 47% as two-star, and 46% as three-star out of five stars.\n\nFollowing the Western Australian gold rushes of the 1890s, a track developed between Coolgardie and Esperance, the closest harbour to the gold fields. Horse-drawn carts would transport supplies and travellers along the route. Due to the sandy nature of the track, horse feed shipped into Esperance needed to be distributed to various points along the track. The Eastern Goldfields Railway from Perth to Kalgoorlie opened in 1897, and a branch railway extended down to Norseman in 1909. By this time, however, it was much cheaper to transfer goods by rail from Fremantle, and no longer profitable to cart goods along the track from Esperance to Norseman.\n\nThe newly formed Main Roads Board took over control and maintenance of the Coolgardie–Esperance route and twenty-one other important roads between 1926 and 1928, which were declared \"main roads\". To increase the usability of the overall main road network, the work schedule for these roads prioritised the worst individual segments, rather than any one road. The Coolgardie to Esperance route was allocated £3,000 for new construction in the first year of these arrangements. By January 1927, construction had commenced on an portion north of Salmon Gums, which had been colloquially known as \"The Glue Pot\".\n\nConstruction works continued in the following years, including around Widgiemooltha in 1929, Scaddan in 1930, and at Higginsville in 1931. From October 1931, work on the northern end and southern end of the road was included as part of the government sustenance work scheme, funded by a federal grant. In 1932 the Red Lake–Grass Patch–Treslove section was worked on, and a portion at Salmon Gums was improved in 1933, with the continuation of the relief work scheme resulting in £5000 being allocated to the road. By August 1933, the whole route was reported to be in reasonable condition, apart from some rough portions between Coolgardie and Widgiemooltha.\n\nConstruction of the Coolgardie–Widgiemooltha section was completed in 1934, and opened to traffic progressively between June and September of that year. The constructed length was extended to Pioneer between late-1934 and May 1935, with works then progressing to the Pioneer–Norseman portion. The works at Norseman were by August nearly complete, and by November construction was underway south of Norseman, on the Scaddan–Gibson section. Further construction was undertaken in early 1936 south of Norseman and Gibson, and near Esperance later in the year. The Red Lake to Treslove portion was under construction in 1937, with further work near Esperance, Widglemooltha, and Treslove in 1938.\n\nIn 1938, attention from local governments in the area focused on providing a sealed road along the highway. The matter was raised at the April 1938 conference of local governing bodies, and again in September 1939. In 1945, it was noted by the Commissioner of Main Roads that it could be years before Coolgardie–Esperance Highway would be sealed. Such work was still to be completed on the Merredin–Southern Cross road, having been discontinued due to war and not yet restarted as bitumen was in short supply.\n\nWork to provide a bitumen surface was under way by January 1948, with prepared for surfacing by April through \"reconditioning and tar priming\". In July, Minister for Works Doney stated that there was no time frame for works beyond the section out of Coolgardie. There were no further surfacing works planned in 1950, nor in 1952 while Great Eastern Highway was still yet to be fully sealed. In April 1953 the Dundas Road Board considered bitumenising the road an urgent matter, especially the section north from Norseman. Dr. D. N. Kirkham of the Dundas Road Board considered that section to be a \"disgrace to the country\", the poorest quality experience along the interstate route between Sydney and Perth.\n\nThe road was gazetted as Coolgardie–Esperance Highway on 16 August 1957, but remained unsealed until 1960, when a 3.7 metre wide (single-lane) seal was completed between Coolgardie and Esperance. In 1974 the road was upgraded further and a two lane seal completed was between Coolgardie and Norseman. In 1980 a two lane seal was completed between Norseman and Danielle Siding, completing the two lane seal from Coolgardie to Esperance.\n\nThe Esperance Port Access Corridor project upgraded Harbour Road in Esperance to improve freight access. It involved realignment of the road and railway leading to the port to provide grade separation between them, through a rail tunnel under Harbour Road and a local road connection (Twilight Beach Road to The Esplanade) via a bridge over the railway. The project was funded by the state and federal governments. Construction commenced in 2012, with the turning of the first sod on March 15 by federal transport minister Anthony Albanese and state transport minister Troy Buswell. The project was completed in June 2014.\n\n"}

Đuro became something of an epitome for the Bosnian people, primarily due to his accent and slang. He was also one of the founding members of SCH and the frontman of the award-winning Sarajevo rock band Bombaj Štampa. In August 1992, several months into the Bosnian War, he moved to Slovenia where he has been residing ever since.\n\nHe has starred in the Academy Award-winning film \"No Man's Land\" and has had supporting roles in numerous high-profile films, including \"The Smell of Quinces\", \"Time of the Gypsies\", \"Kuduz\", \"Bal-Can-Can\", \"In the Land of Blood and Honey\" and \"See You in Montevideo\". He has also created the critically and commercially acclaimed comedy series \"Naša mala klinika\", which has spawned an entire franchise with Slovenian, Croatian and Serbian counterparts.\n\nBorn to a Serb father from Kruševac and Bosniak mother Fadila, his twenty-one-year-old father died of cancer when infant Branko was only one.\n\nWhen Đurić was fourteen, his widowed mother married painter Branislav \"Branko\" Popovac so part of the youngster's adolescence was spent with a stepfather who encouraged him to pursue his artistic talents.\n\nFrom an early age Đurić exhibited a propensity for public performance. He completed his secondary education at the First Sarajevo Gymnasium, graduating in 1980. In 1981, he applied at the Academy of Performing Arts (ASU), a newly established faculty within the University of Sarajevo, but got rejected. Following the ASU rejection, he instead enrolled in journalism studies at the University of Sarajevo's Faculty of Philosophy.\n\nĐurić didn't give up on acting after the ASU rejection, getting work as an extra in various TV Sarajevo productions. He also continued applying at ASU ahead of each new academic year, and after two more rejections in 1982 and 1983, finally got accepted on his fourth try in 1984. Once accepted at ASU, he quit the journalism studies where he had completed two years.\n\nIn April 1984, while contemplating giving ASU another try, Đurić joined \"Top lista nadrealista\", a new prime-time television show being launched by TV Sarajevo as an overlap between folk music and sketch comedy. Made by a group of Sarajevo youths from the New Primitivism sub-cultural milieu Đurić already knew well and was on friendly terms with, the sketches were framed as comedy fillers in-between folk music performances by top local folk music stars. Being a bit of a new piece in this group of sketch performers, young Đurić right away proved a good fit with fellow youngsters who had prior been cutting their teeth via putting out a 15-minute weekly radio segment airing as part of the Saturday morning \"Primus\" program on Radio Sarajevo's channel two before now getting the chance to showcase their talents in front of a large television audience.\n\nIn parallel with \"Top lista nadrealista\" being shot, Zabranjeno Pušenje, one of the bands from the same New Primitives scene released its debut album and Đurić played a small role in the TV Sarajevo produced video for their \"Neću da budem Švabo u dotiranom filmu\" track. At the said video shoot directed by the aspiring film director Ademir Kenović, Đurić told Kenović of his continual woes getting accepted at ASU to which Kenović responded by sending over his friend Vuk Janić to help Đurić prepare and hone material for the upcoming audition. Đurić finally got accepted.\n\nIn early June 1984, \"Top lista nadrealista\" television episodes started airing on TV Sarajevo's second channel. Early reaction was largely one of indifference, but after a few episodes, the sketches started catching on. By now known to the wider public by his nickname Đuro, Đurić was a prominent member of the troupe, playing multiple characters, though the one that got him most attention was his portrayal of a jumpy TV station security guard with a catchphrase \"Ćega, ba\". TV show's popularity as well as its folk music context led to lucrative offers to all members of the group from local folk music promoters and managers, such as Rizo Rondić, of doing sketch comedy at their clients' live shows and tours through Bosnian towns and villages. Đuro and colleague Zenit Đozić took many of those offers throughout the second part of 1984, cashing in their \"Nadrealisti\" prominence by performing as comic relief on folk music tours named \"Udri kapom o ledinu\", \"Zasviraj i za pojas zadjeni\", \"Prođoh Bosnu pjevajući\", etc.\n\nFrom late 1984 and into 1985, Đuro participated in \"Audicija\", a no frills stage comedic production that began as academic project consisting of Academy of Stage Arts (ASU) students creating, developing, and performing characters based on various individuals applying to the academy. Conceptualized as a series of one-on-one auditions between each applicant and a professor, with students drawing upon their own auditioning experiences, the production gained prominence after one of its stage shows got filmed and broadcast on TV Sarajevo's \"Noćni program\". Performing alongside fellow academy students Željko Ninčić, Admir Glamočak, Emir Hadžihafizbegović, Haris Burina, Saša Petrović, Jasmin Geljo, Željko Kecojević, and Senad Bašić, Đuro's streetwise Sarajevan, Solomon Bičakćić, proved to be among the more popular characters from the show. Though drawing mostly poor reviews from the critics, \"Audicija\"'s folksy humour soon became a comedy smash hit all over Yugoslavia with Đurić performing in 150 stagings of the show across the country before quitting his participation and even somewhat distancing himself from the show. Subsequent ASU generations would also start performing the show and taking it on the road across the country.\n\nCashing in on the sudden popularity of his comedic everyman persona, Đuro, an ASU student, starred in a series of television commercials shot in early 1985 for the local tourist board in Sarajevo – popularizing tourism on Jahorina and Bjelašnica mountains around the city – with recycled folksy catchphrase from \"Audicija\", \"Joj razlike, drastićne\", delivered in heavy Sarajevan accent as somewhat of a punchline. At first, the commercials – directed by Đurić's old friend and professional collaborator Ademir Kenović and produced by Ismet \"Nuno\" Arnautalić with Goran Bregović providing the music – aired somewhat infrequently. However, they would soon gain further significance due to their jingle-like, Bregović-composed tune (featuring Đuro's vocal singing about the mountains) getting made into a full-length track called \"Hajdemo u planine\" ('Let's Go to the Mountains') on Bijelo Dugme's (Bregović's band) next studio album \"Pljuni i zapjevaj moja Jugoslavijo\" released in November 1986, this time sung by the band's vocalist Alen Islamović. With the song in heavy radio rotation and the album selling well, the commercials also began airing a lot more frequently, leading to a surge of popularity for Đurić throughout late 1986 and early 1987. Due to Bregović's habit of mercilessly reusing and recycling old material, the same tune would in 1992 also be sung by Iggy Pop as \"Get the Money\" on the \"Arizona Dream\" movie soundtrack.\n\nAlso in 1985, while still in his first year at ASU, the young actor got cast against type by Kenović for the leading role in TV drama \"Ovo malo duše\", a touching coming-of-age story written by Ranko Božić, with Đuro set to play the role of Ibrahim Halilović, suddenly single father in a remote Bosnian village after his wife passes away. The movie was shot throughout 1986 and aired in January 1987 on TV Sarajevo. \"Ovo malo duše\" led to a few more dramatic roles on television for Đurić – in \"Znak\" series on TVSa and \"Vanja\" movie that aired on TV Novi Sad.\n\nHe also continued doing TV commercials – this time for Dedo and Nana coffee – going back to his, by now well established, \"good-natured, streetwise Sarajevo guy\" persona.\n\nĐuro then caught a bit of break when the Cannes-winning director Emir Kusturica cast him in \"Dom za vešanje\", which became the young actor's very first role in a feature film. The fact this was Kusturica's first feature after the director's Palme d'Or-winning previous effort ensured plenty of attention for the project along with a Cannes showing. Though his part in the movie was minor (he played one of the Gypsy thugs in Italy), Đuro left a good impression that opened many doors for the young actor.\n\nBy 1989, a sought-after actor all over Yugoslavia, Đuro played memorable supporting role in \"Kuduz\", Kenović's feature film debut. He also participated in \"Kako je propao rokenrol\" (a three-story ensemble film by the recent graduates from the Belgrade's Faculty of Dramatic Arts), playing the male lead in the third story opposite Vesna Trivalić about a young couple preparing for the arrival of their first baby.\n\nIn fall 1989, \"Top lista nadrealista\"'s second series started airing, a 7-episode chunk that achieved huge viewership rates in addition to critical praise, all of which solidified Đuro's status in the country. Playing different funny characters every week like street policeman Rade Pendrek, cranky average TV viewer Reuf, high-strung TV news director Đuđi, host of do-it-yourself segment 'Đurine kućne čarolije', etc. led to another huge wave of popularity for the actor.\n\nAt the outbreak of Bosnian War during spring 1992 Đuro was in Sarajevo before fleeing the city in late August 1992, several months into the siege, and settling in Ljubljana.\n\nHe also works in Croatia, where he had a TV show \"Pet Minuta Slave\" (\"Five Minutes of Fame\") on Nova TV, as well as the comedy series \"Naša mala klinika\" (\"Our Little Clinic\"), which was being aired on POP TV and Nova TV.\n\nIn the mid-2000s, Ðurić starred in and directed TV series \"Brat bratu\", the Slovenian version of \"Only Fools and Horses\". The series got cancelled after thirteen episodes due to poor viewership.\n\nIn February 2007, Ðurić has appeared on B92 television in Serbia in \"Ðurine žute minute\" short segments, a slightly different take on his widely popular \"Ðurine kućne čarolije\" sketch, which he performed on \"Top lista nadrealista\". The segments, which had a commercial tie-in with Telekom Srbija's Žute strane (Yellow Pages), mostly received poor reviews and were quickly taken off the air.\n\nIn 2011, he played a Serbian soldier in movie \"In the Land of Blood and Honey\". This was Đurić's second movie about the Bosnian War. The first one was 2001 film \"No Man's Land\". In it, Ðurić played Čiki, a Bosniak soldier.\n\nIn parallel with trying to make it as an actor, and later after managing to become a successful one, Đuro was involved with bands though his musical engagement was mostly scheduled around his acting one.\n\nHe started with a band called Ševe in the early 1980s with childhood friend Nedim Babović. Đuro then joined punk outfit SCH in 1983, but soon transferred to Bombaj Štampa re-joining Nedim Babović. As Đurić's acting career took off, the band also became more prominent, although their activity was always sporadic. In 1987 their debut album got released.\n\nIn December 2008, he reunited with Bombaj Štampa for a concert in Sarajevo featuring original guitarist Nedim Babović and drummer Dragan Bajić along with bassist Ernie Mendillo (The Brandos). More concerts followed and an album of new material will be released in the spring of 2010.\n\nOn 25 July 2019 he and his band Bombaj štampa gave two-hour performance on Zenica city square – as one of many concerts during Zenica summer fest 2019 (second main show of this festival). He performed, among other songs, his new song called \"Čekić\" – that will appear on the album that is due to be released in September 2019 –, as well as one opera.\n\nĐurić married Slovenian actress and singer Tanja Ribič whom he met while filming \"Cheese and Jam.\" They have two daughters, Zala and Ela.\n\nFrom his first marriage, he has a son, Filip.\n\nHe resides in Ljubljana, where he leads a production company \"Theatre 55.\"\n\n\n\n"}

It carries a pejorative tone and is relatively rarely used to describe the speaker: \"I limped down the aisle and asked a fellow to move along one seat so I could sit down, but he refused: \"I'm alright Jack\". So I hit him with my crutch, your Honour.\"\n\nThe phrase is believed to have originated among Royal Navy sailors, where a ladder was slung over the side of a ship, and when the last sailor climbed on board he would say, \"I'm alright Jack, pull up the ladder\". The use of the name \"Jack\" derives from Jack Tar, an archaic term for a British sailor. Another variant of the story depicts the origin of the phrase among sailors returning home from duty who, instead of being treated as brave heroes, were forced to fend for themselves in a dog-eat-dog society.\n\nIt was used in the title of the film \"I'm All Right Jack\" (1959) and appears in lyrics of popular song Which Side Are You On?

The Paseo del Prado is the oldest historical city street in Madrid and was declared Bien de Interés Cultural (BIC). It runs north-south between the Plaza de Cibeles and the Plaza del Emperador Carlos V (also known as Plaza de Atocha), with the Plaza de Cánovas del Castillo (the location of the Fuente de Neptuno, and of the Ritz and Palace five-star hotels) lying approximately in the middle. The Paseo del Prado forms the southern end of the city's central axis (which continues to the north of Cibeles as the Paseo de Recoletos, and further north as the Paseo de la Castellana).\n\nThis densely tree-lined, wide and central avenue is a landmark for the city residents and the location of important cultural and tourist spots in the city, including the so-called \"Golden Triangle of Art\", which encompasses three museums: the Prado Museum (with highlights such as Diego Velázquez's \"Las Meninas\" and Francisco de Goya's \"La maja vestida\" and \"La maja desnuda\"), the Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum (housing a collection that spans eight centuries of European painting), and the Reina Sofia Museum (where Pablo Picasso's \"Guernica\" hangs, among a collection of 20th-century art). In the vicinity are located the Parque del Buen Retiro and the Casón del Buen Retiro (hosting the 19th-century collection of the Prado Museum), as well as the headquarters of the Real Academia Española (the Spanish language academy), the Bolsa de Madrid (the city's stock exchange), and the Congreso de los Diputados (the national congress).\n\nThe Paseo del Prado boulevard includes several monuments and enclosures that are of historical and artistic interest, erected in the eighteenth century for the Hall of Prado urban project.

Now Sony's products branded as CineAlta include camera, camcorder, recorder, cinema server, and projector. \"CineAlta\" is a portmanteau of Cine, from cinematography, and Alta, an Italian word for \"high\".\n\nThe first CineAlta logo was designed by Hiroki Oka, Chief Art Director of Sony CreativeWorks Corporation, based at the Atsugi Technology Center. The twinned ribbons represent the marriage of film and videotape, arranged in a way to deliberately evoke the infinity symbol, to symbolize the infinite possibilities. The CineAlta logo was updated by Tetsuro Sano and applied for the first time to the F65.\n\nCineAlta cameras record onto HDCAM tapes, XDCAM Professional Discs, SRMemory, or SxS flash memory cards. They have the ability to shoot at various frame rates including 24fps and a resolution of up to 8K. The camera can be used with a Miranda DVC 802 converter. This allows the camera to output SDI, DV, and multiple HD outputs.\n\nIn June 1999, George Lucas announced that of the \"Star Wars\" Prequel Trilogy would be the first major motion picture to be shot 100% digitally. Sony and Panavision had teamed up to develop the High Definition 24p camera that Lucas would use to accomplish this and thus the first CineAlta camera was born: the Sony HDW-F900 (also called the Panavision HD-900F after being \"panavised\"). However, the science-fiction film \"Vidocq\" was actually the first released feature that was shot entirely with digital cinematography. Lucas held a private screening of \"\" for the Atsugi Technology Center staff, and inserted a credit to specifically thank the Sony engineers at Atsugi for the use of the HDW-F900.\n\nFor \"\" the more advanced Sony HDC-F950 was used, with higher resolution and better color reproduction than its predecessor. The film was cropped to a 2.40:1 aspect ratio from its native 16:9 frame. As a result, only 818 of the 1080 vertical pixels were actually used; but there is an anamorphic adaptor lens from Canon, which allows shooting in 2.39:1 without losing any pixels. Manuel Huerga's \"Salvador\" is the first movie shot with this adaptor.\n\n2002's \"Russian Ark\" was recorded in uncompressed high definition video using a Sony HDW-F900. The information was recorded uncompressed onto a hard disk which could hold 100 minutes, thus allowing the entire film to be shot in a single 86 minute take. This was very complicated, as in 2002 there wasn't widely available technology for high capacity hard disk-recording; even less for doing this portably, on battery power, with the camera moving inside and outside, from to . Four attempts were made to complete the shot which had to be completed in one day due to the Hermitage Museum being closed for the shooting; the first three had to be interrupted due to technical faults, but the fourth attempt was completed successfully.

Originally given the name Paxton, it is described as, “a vast city established by Earth on the planet Oasis but since colonized by numerous other races as well. Even the Chooms, who had lived here before the first Earth people, had come to refer to the city by its nickname of Punktown.” Besides the indigenous Choom, human in appearance aside from wide mouths cut back to their ears, the stories often include or focus on a variety of alien races, clones, mutants, and sentient machines. The stories tend to feature common citizens as their protagonists, rather than the larger-than-life heroes of cliché science fiction, an exception being mutant private eye Jeremy Stake, protagonist of the novels \"Deadstock\" and \"Blue War\". Beyond their grounding in science fiction, Punktown stories also notably combine elements of horror, fantasy and occasionally detective noir.\n\nThomas has related in interviews that he first devised the city in 1980, with a handful of short stories appearing in small press publications before the collection \"Punktown\" was released in 2000. The \"Punktown\" stories are sometimes cited as early examples of the New Weird subgenre; Paul Di Filippo in \"Asimov's\" describing the initial collection as \"a harbinger of the New Weird... Not that the concept of Punktown really needs any shoring-up by cliques or claques.\"\n\nForeign language editions of a number of Punktown books have appeared in Germany, Russia, Poland, and Greece.

On August 22, 1930, as a lieutenant-colonel, he overturned the eleven-year dictatorship of Augusto B. Leguía after a coup d'état in Arequipa.\n\nFollowing Leguía's resignation, Manuel Ponce was interim president until Sánchez was chosen on August 27. The new president flew to Lima and himself served as provisional president until the military with whom he had effected the coup forced him into exile after six months in office.\n\nLuis Miguel Sánchez Cerro was born in Piura on August 12, 1889 to Antonio Sánchez and Rosa Cerro. He was the first Peruvian President to have Indigenous Peruvian ancestry as well as allegedly also being of Afro-Peruvian Malagasy descent based on a rumour he was from a part of Piura populated by descendants of Malagasy slaves.\n\nLuis Miguel Sánchez was wounded in five places and lost three fingers of his left hand when he seized the spitting muzzle of a machine gun (with his bare hands) and turned it against government forces during the overthrowing of President Guillermo Billinghurst, in 1914.\n\nIn 1921 he was again shot and injured when captured in Lima, in an unsuccessful attempt to overthrow President Leguía. During his exile abroad he served with the Spanish Foreign Legion in Morocco, where he was wounded. He got a post at the ministry of war in 1924. He also served with the Royal Army of Italy in 1925, and took advanced military studies in France in 1926.\n\nIn 1931, as president of the military junta, Sánchez awarded Prince Edward VIII of Wales with Peru's Order of the Sun, and proceeded to escort the prince and his entourage in the voyage back to the United Kingdom. Sánchez was awarded in return with the Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire.\n\nAfter six months in office, prominent Peruvian Navy officers held talks with Colonel Sánchez, and told him that only a single regiment in Lima remained loyal to his regime. As a result of this, Sánchez resigned, stating that he \"only wanted to save his country,\" and that he \"had no political ambition.\"\n\nThe Navy then selected Chief Justice Ricardo Leoncio Elías of Peru's Supreme Court as the new president of the Republic on March 1, 1931.\n\nIn October 1931, the military Junta permitted a national election. Luis Sánchez was allowed to participate and won the elections by a majority of 19,745 votes, running as the candidate for the Revolutionary Union which he founded. President Luis M. Sánchez was inaugurated at Peru's Government Palace as the forty-fifth President of Peru.\n\nThe results, however, were contested by the main opposition party, APRA.\n\nIn March 1932, as he was leaving Lima's socialite Church in Miraflores, an assassination attempt by an unknown individual – later identified as José Melgar – took place. Melgar attempted to shoot the president in the chest, but missed. The president himself was armed and almost shot his aggressor, but was stopped short of doing so by his bodyguards after they arrested the man.\n\nDays after, the president commuted the death sentence of José Melgar to imprisonment for twenty-five years. He claimed that his \"actions were entirely personal\". The assassin claimed that his actions were not \"politically motivated\".\n\nOn June 1932, another revolt against President Sánchez took place in Huaraz. The President closed both the National College and the National University as \"hotbeds of revolutions,\" and appealed for voluntary contributions to purchase three squadrons of bombing planes in order to put down further revolts.\n\nIn September 1932, a group of Peruvian civilians and military dressed as civilians, staged a private raid and seized the Colombian town of Leticia. They then expelled the town's Colombian officials and demanded the support of the Peruvian Government. The surge of patriotism was too strong to be resisted by Sánchez.\n\nBy the \"Saloman-Lozano Treaty\" of 1922, Peru ceded to Colombia a \"Corridor to the Amazon\" at the tip of which is Leticia. However, the Treaty was kept in secret until the end of the Augusto B. Leguía dictatorship, and it was considered \"null\" and \"unequal\" by the new authorities under Sánchez.\n\nBy the end of September 1932, both Colombia and Peru were mobilizing men, money and munitions. On February 1933, at least three thousand Colombian troops with artillery and machine guns were deployed behind the Putumayo River, facing roughly equal Peruvian military forces. At Peru's Military Aviation School near Lima, President Sánchez approvingly inspected a brand new fleet of Douglas combat planes, just arrived from the United States.\n\nThe Council of the League of Nations sent Lima an important telegram, in which Peru was commanded by the Council \"to refrain from any intervention by force on Colombian territory and ... not hinder the Colombian authorities from the exercise of full sovereignty and jurisdiction in territory recognized by a treaty to belong to Colombia.\"\n\nOn April 30, 1933, while at Santa Beatriz racetrack in Lima, President Sánchez had just finished reviewing twenty thousand young recruits for Peru's undeclared war with Colombia, when Abelardo de Mendoza, a member of the suppressed APRA Party, shot him through the heart.\n\nParliament proceeded to choose General Oscar R. Benavides to succeed Sánchez as Provisional President. Benavides had already served a term as Provisional President in 1914.\n\n"}

{"id": "2057411", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2057411", "title": "Richard Caliguiri", "text": "Richard Caliguiri\n\nRichard S. Caliguiri (October 20, 1931 – May 6, 1988) was an American politician who served as the mayor of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania from 1977 until his death in 1988.\n\nCaliguiri was of Italian Arbëresh ancestry, and grew up in the City of Pittsburgh's Greenfield neighborhood.\nHe started his public service career in the CitiParks department of Pittsburgh later running for city council in the early 1970s. Caliguiri first ran for mayor as a longshot in 1973 but lost the Democratic primary to popular incumbent mayor Peter Flaherty; Flaherty was so popular that, for the first time in city, history no candidate opposed him in the general election. In his position as President of the Pittsburgh City Council, Caliguiri was appointed interim Mayor in 1977 after Flaherty was appointed Deputy Attorney General in President Jimmy Carter's administration. Caliguiri's departure from the City Council necessitated the 1978 special election which allowed independent Democrat Michelle Madoff her seat.\n\nCaliguiri officially won the mayor's office in an election later in 1977, and was reelected twice, serving until his death in 1988. Under Caliguiri's leadership, Pittsburgh began its \"Renaissance II\" plan, an urban renewal and revitalization plan based on the \"Renaissance\" plan of former mayor and governor David L. Lawrence. The plan was generally considered a success (especially with the city's skyline) but was hampered by a sharp and permanent downturn in the city's economy and resulting population shifts.\n\nDuring Caliguri's tenure, Pittsburgh's economy began a marked downturn during the deindustrialization of the 1980s with the decline of the large steel producers such as U.S. Steel and Jones and Laughlin. Long time industrial giants that called Pittsburgh headquarters such as Gulf Oil and Koppers both were victims of the 1980s arbitrage and hostile takeover climate. Gulf was absorbed by Chevron and Koppers by British firm Beazer, both resulting in the region losing several thousand high salaried corporate headquarter jobs. The period was also marked by Pittsburgh-based Westinghouse's run up to bankruptcy and reorganization in 1990 (later to become CBS and move to New York) and Rockwell International's move to California and eventually Wisconsin. By the end of Caliguiri's time in office, not a single major steel mill operated in a city once known as the \"Steel City\", and the city that once boasted more Fortune 500 corporate headquarters save for New York and Chicago, had fewer than ten.\n\nIn 1986, in response to some citizen complaints and legal action by the ACLU, the city, by order of Mayor Caliguiri, placed a plaque entitled \"Salute to Liberty.\" and reading: \"During this holiday season, the city of Pittsburgh salutes liberty. Let these festive lights remind us that we are the keepers of the flame of liberty and our legacy of freedom.\" Three years later, by two 5-4 decisions, the United States Supreme Court upheld in part and denied in part the city's position in \"County of Allegheny v. American Civil Liberties Union\".\n\nIn the late 1980s, Caliguiri was diagnosed with amyloidosis, a rare and serious protein disorder. Coincidentally, within a few years in the mid to late 1980s, three of Pennsylvania's most prominent political leaders were afflicted with the disorder. Caliguiri as well as longtime Erie Mayor Louis Tullio and Pennsylvania Governor Bob Casey were all diagnosed with the incurable and usually fatal disease.\n\nCaliguiri refused to allow his declining health to affect his leadership and declined to step down as mayor. He died in 1988 at the age of 56, and was interred in Pittsburgh's Roman Catholic Calvary Cemetery.\n\nIn October 1990, a commemorative statue of Caliguiri sculpted by Robert Berks was dedicated on the steps of the Downtown Pittsburgh City-County Building on Grant Street. According to Caliguiri's son David, previous ideas had included a renaming of Grant Street and the Pittsburgh Civic (later Mellon) Arena. Caliguiri, who graduated from Taylor Allderdice High School in 1950, was inducted into their alumni hall of fame in 2010.\n\nThe Mayor is spotlighted in a cameo playing himself in the sport/cult classic \"The Fish That Saved Pittsburgh\" in 1979. Near the middle of the film he is seen on the extreme right introducing to a cheering crowd the city's basketball team at an indoor rally. He slips off camera for a few seconds and then is seen again patting them on the back and shaking hands with the actors and coach, before he extends across the crowd to shake Julius Erving's hand (one of the \"actors\" on the team) and is met warmly by a surprised Dr. J.\n\nOn May 18, 1987 Caliguiri was a guest on a national broadcast of \"The Today Show\" as it filmed in Pittsburgh.\n\n"}
{"id": "2057413", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2057413", "title": "Ocean Rain", "text": "Ocean Rain\n\nOcean Rain is the fourth studio album by the English post-punk band Echo & the Bunnymen. It was released on 4 May 1984 and reached number four on the UK Albums Chart, number 87 on the United States \"Billboard\" 200, number 41 on the Canadian \"RPM\" 100 Albums and number 22 on the Swedish chart. Since 1984 the album has been certified gold by the British Phonographic Industry. \"Ocean Rain\" includes the singles \"The Killing Moon\", \"Silver\" and \"Seven Seas\".\n\nThe band wrote the songs for the new album in 1983. In early 1984 they recorded most of the album in Paris using a 35-piece orchestra, with other sessions taking place in Bath and Liverpool. Receiving mixed reviews the album was originally released as an LP and a cassette in May 1984 before it was reissued on CD in August. The album was reissued on CD in 2003, along with the other four of the band's first five studio albums, having been remastered and expanded before again being reissued in 2008 with a live bonus disc. The artwork for the album was designed by Martyn Atkins and the photography was by Brian Griffin. Echo & the Bunnymen played a number of concerts in 2008 where they performed \"Ocean Rain\" in full and with the backing of an orchestra.\n\nFollowing the poor reception of Echo & the Bunnymen's third album, 1983's \"Porcupine\", the band recorded the single \"Never Stop\". The title track of the single was produced by Hugh Jones, who had produced the band's second album, 1981's \"Heaven Up Here\". The single introduced a new sound for the band with an expanded arrangement including congas, marimbas, violins and cellos. After \"Never Stop\" was released on 8 July 1983 the band toured the Outer Hebrides in Scotland before two successful concerts at the Royal Albert Hall in London on 18 and 19 July. Also that month, the band was filmed by RPM Productions for the Channel 4 documentary series \"Play at Home\". Filmed in a café used by the band they recorded acoustic versions of two old songs, \"Stars Are Stars\" and \"Villiers Terrace\", as well as two new songs, \"The Killing Moon\" and \"Silver\", for their episode of \"Play at Home\" titled \"Life at Brian's\".\n\nAfter spending some time in Liverpool writing new songs for the album, the band recorded their sixth session for John Peel's radio show on BBC Radio 1 on 6 September 1983. The songs recorded were \"Nocturnal Me\", \"Ocean Rain\", \"My Kingdom\" and \"Watch Out Below\", which would all later appear on the band's fourth album \"Ocean Rain\" – \"Watch Out Below\" was later renamed \"The Yo Yo Man\". When the band's John Peel session was broadcast on 10 October 1983, the punk zine \"Jamming\" said, \"[The songs] hint at a readjustment and a period of new positive recovery.\"\n\nEcho & the Bunnymen were booked to headline a two-week youth festival at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre in Stratford-upon-Avon on the evening of 23 October 1983. Due to a high demand for tickets a matinee performance was added. The matinee concert at Stratford-upon-Avon saw the live debut of \"Seven Seas\". With representatives from the band's record company and lead singer Ian McCulloch's mother in the audience, the performance was nervous and uncertain; although the evening performance, without the record company representatives and McCulloch's mother, was much improved.\n\nAt the end of 1983 Echo & the Bunnymen recorded a live special called \"A Crystal Day\" for the Channel 4 programme \"The Tube\". Ignoring their old material, the band played \"The Killing Moon\", \"Nocturnal Me\", \"Ocean Rain\" – which had now developed into a ballad – and an early version of \"Thorn of Crowns\" called \"Cucumber\".\n\nThe band recorded and self-produced \"The Killing Moon\" – which was released on 20 January 1984 – at Crescent Studio in Bath, Somerset. After catching a cold, McCulloch completed the recording of the vocals for the song at Amazon Studio in Liverpool, where de Freitas also completed the drumming. The band then went to Paris where they were booked into Les Studios des Dames and Studio Davout. Henri Loustau, the engineer at des Dames, assisted on the string passages and Adam Peters provided the string arrangements and played cello and piano. McCulloch, not happy with the lead vocals he had recorded in Paris, re-recorded most of the vocals at Amazon Studio in Liverpool.\n\nContinuing the band's prominent use of strings – which began with the 1982 single \"The Back of Love\" – they recorded \"Ocean Rain\" using a 35-piece orchestra. Lead guitarist Will Sergeant said, \"We wanted to make something conceptual with lush orchestration; not Mantovani, something with a twist. It's all pretty dark. 'Thorn of Crowns' is based on an eastern scale. The whole mood is very windswept: European pirates, a bit Ben Gunn; dark and stormy, battering rain; all of that.\" During recording De Freitas used xylophones and glockenspiels in addition to his usual percussion, bass player Les Pattinson used an old reverb machine at des Dames and Sergeant's solo on \"My Kingdom\" was played using a Washburn acoustic guitar which he distorted through a valve radio.\n\nAs with their previous albums, the album cover was designed by Martyn Atkins and the photography was by Brian Griffin. With the band wanting to continue the elemental theme of the previous three albums, the photograph used on the front cover of the album is a picture of the band in a rowing boat which was taken inside Carnglaze Caverns, Liskeard, Cornwall. In his 2002 book \"Turquoise Days: The Weird World of Echo & the Bunnymen\", author Chris Adams describes the cover as \"a perfect visual representation of arguably the Bunnymen's finest album\".\n\nThe picture on the front cover of the original album was kept for the 2003 reissue. However, the design was altered slightly by graphic designer Rachel Gutek of the design company guppyart. This release contains an expanded booklet written by music journalist Max Bell giving the background to the album. The booklet contains a number of photographs which are credited to Sergeant and Pattinson.\n\n\"Ocean Rain\" was first released on 4 May 1984 as an LP and on cassette by Korova in Europe. It was subsequently released by Sire Records in the United States on 14 May and on CD in Europe and the United States on 24 August 1984. The album was marketed as \"the greatest album ever made\" and McCulloch later said it was because they believed it was. Although he also said it was meant as a joke when he said, \"That wasn't my idea! I was on the phone to <nowiki>[</nowiki>Rob Dickins, managing director of Warner Bros.], just joshing and I said 'Oh, it's the greatest album ever made.' And he used it on the poster.\" In a 2005 interview for \"Record Collector\" magazine, Sergeant asked, \"Why not?\". After wondering \"what all the fuss was about\", he went on to ask, \"Doesn't every band think that way when they've got a new record out?\"\n\nAlong with the other four of the band's first five albums, \"Ocean Rain\" was remastered and reissued on CD in 2003 – these releases were marketed as 25th anniversary editions. Eight bonus tracks were added to the album: \"Angels and Devils\", which had been recorded at The Automatt in San Francisco, was the B-side to the single \"Silver\" and was produced by The Bunnymen and Alan Perman; five \"Life at Brian's – Lean and Hungry\" tracks (\"All You Need Is Love\", \"The Killing Moon\", \"Stars Are Stars\", \"Villiers Terrace\" and \"Silver\") which had been recorded for the Channel 4 programme \"Play at Home\"; and two live tracks (\"My Kingdom\" and \"Ocean Rain\") which were recorded for \"A Crystal Day\", a Channel 4 special for \"The Tube\". The \"Life at Brian's – Lean and Hungry\" track, \"Silver\", and the two \"A Crystal Day\" tracks had previously been unreleased.\n\nThe reissued album in 2003 was produced by Andy Zax and Bill Inglot. A collector's edition was released in October 2008 which, while still including \"Angels and Devils\", replaced the bonus tracks of the 25th anniversary edition with the extended 12-inch single versions of \"Silver\" and \"The Killing Moon\". The collector's edition also includes a bonus disc containing a recording of the band's 1983 Royal Albert Hall concert, omitting only two encore tracks \"Heroin\" and \"Do It Clean\" which are included on the Crystal Days box set.\n\nThere were three tracks from the original \"Ocean Rain\" album which have been released as singles. The first of these was \"The Killing Moon\" which was released on 20 January 1984. The second single was \"Silver\" which was released on 13 April 1984. The final single to be released from the original album was \"Seven Seas\" which was released on 6 July 1984. This was the first time Echo & the Bunnymen have released more than two singles from one album.\n\nThe album was released to mixed reviews. Describing Echo & the Bunnymen's change from the more rock sound of their previous albums to the lighter sound of \"Ocean Rain\", music journalist Max Bell said in his 1984 review for \"The Times\" newspaper, \"This time vocalist Ian McCulloch has tempered his metaphysical songs with a romantic sweetness and the band's melodies are more to the fore. Acoustic guitars, brushes and sparingly used keyboards all add to the album's optimistic warmth and there is a consistency of atmosphere in songs like 'Seven Seas' and 'Silver', the current single, which justifies the departure.\"\n\nHowever, \"Rolling Stone\" described the album as \"too often a monochromatic dirge of banal existential imagery cloaked around the mere skeleton of a musical idea\". Saying that the album had some nifty choruses and nice atmospheres, the review went on to say it \"evinces too little melodic development and too much tortured soul-gazing\". In his 1984 review for \"NME\", Biba Kopf said, \"... \"Ocean Rain\" has been designed to buttress the notion of the group's importance. Not unnaturally the results have the opposite effect.\" He went on to criticise McCulloch's lyrics, which he described as \"tired juxtapositions of mysterious buzzwords, nonsense, and banality\", and the music, \"mellotron-style wash of strings and bleating wood winds\".\n\n\"Ocean Rain\" reached number four on the UK Albums Chart in its first week of release and stayed on the chart for 26 weeks. In the United States it entered the \"Billboard\" 200 at number 172 on 9 June 1984 and stayed on the chart for 11 weeks, reaching a peak of number 87. It entered the Canadian \"RPM\" 100 Albums chart at number 89 before it reached a peak of number 41. Staying on the Swedish chart for three weeks the album reached a peak of number 22. As of 1984, \"Ocean Rain\" has been certified gold by the British Phonographic Industry for having sold more than copies.\n\nOf the singles from the album; \"The Killing Moon\", which was released on 20 January 1984, reached number nine on the UK Singles Chart and number seven on the Irish Singles Chart; \"Silver\", released on 13 April 1984, reached number 30 on the UK Singles Chart and number 14 on the Irish Singles Chart; and \"Seven Seas\", released on 6 July 1984, reached number 16 on the UK Singles Chart and number 10 on the Irish Singles Chart.\n\nOver the years since its release, the album has attracted more positive commentary and also sometimes more nuanced views. In a highly praising retrospective review on AllMusic, Jason Ankeny gave the album a 5-star rating. He described it as \"dramatic and majestic\", praising the \"sweeping string arrangements and hauntingly evocative production.\" He felt that in comparison to the band's album \"Porcupine\", the \"conventional and simple structural parameters\" of \"Ocean Rain\" made it Echo & the Bunnymen's \"most beautiful and memorable effort\" and he asserted that \"The Killing Moon\" was the band's \"unrivalled pinnacle\".\n\n\"The Killing Moon\" is featured in the original theatrical version of the opening sequence of the 2001 cult film \"Donnie Darko\". However, in the , the song is replaced by INXS's \"Never Tear Us Apart\", with \"The Killing Moon\" being placed later in the movie.\n\nWhen reissued in 2003, Andrew Harrison in \"Blender\" described the album as \"a portrait of splendid derangement with spectacular orchestrations\". \"Mojo\" said the album had \"effervescent songs, sympathetically orchestrated\".\n\nIn his 2005 book \"Rip It Up and Start Again: Post Punk 1978–1984\", British music journalist Simon Reynolds describes the album as \"lush, orchestrated and [...] overtly erotic\". Mark Blacklock, in Robert Dimery's 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die, wrote that the album's confidence, lush strings, romance, warmth and poetry, means that \"it stands the test of time better than any other Bunnymen album\".\n\nWhen reviewing the remastered reissue of the album, \"Pitchfork\" described it as being \"stuffed with queasy midtempo tracks and bizarre orchestration\" although they did conclude that it's not impenetrable, ultimately giving it a positive score of 8.6/10. Reviewing the collector's edition for the BBC, Chris Jones described the album as both \"the last truly great record they made\" and \"the point where the cracks began to show, but were masked with such beauty as to hardly matter\". Jones went on to say how the 35-piece orchestra helped on tracks such as \"Nocturnal Me\" but made others, such as \"The Yo-Yo Man\", \"flounder under the weight of intrusive arrangements\". Adam Sweeting wrote that \"Ocean Rain\" was \"only half a classic album\", adding: \"If you picture it in its original LP format, side two is superb, while side one sounds like a few extra songs they hastily knocked off to go with it\".\n\nIn the first season of \"Stranger Things\", the fifth episode, \"The Flea and Acrobat\" featured \"Nocturnal Me\" in the end credits. The Swedish heavy metal band Ghost covered \"Nocturnal Me\" for their \"Popestar\" EP, which consisted mainly of cover versions.\n\nOn 16 September 2008, Echo & the Bunnymen played a concert at the Royal Albert Hall in London playing the album with the backing of a 16-piece orchestra. Two similar concerts subsequently took place at Radio City in New York City on 1 October 2008 and at the Liverpool Echo Arena on 27 November 2008. These concerts were played with a 10-piece orchestra which was conducted by Rupert Christie. The posters used to advertise the concerts have the image of the band from the cover of the album overlaying an image of the venue. Further concerts took place in Europe and North America during 2009.\n\nThe concerts were received well. Simon O'Hagan, reviewing the London concert in \"The Independent\", described it as \"a moving, memorable evening\" and went on to describe McCulloch's voice as \"torn silk\" and \"magnificent\". Giving the London concert five out of five stars, Angus Batey, writing in \"The Guardian\", described \"The Killing Moon\" as a \"dizzying high\" which was \"topped by 'Ocean Rain' itself, where the strings are held back until the end of the second verse so that they hit with a euphoric punch of almost physical intensity, sunny melodic optimism piercing the lyrics' chiaroscuro of storm clouds and 'blackest thoughts'.\" However, Adam Sweeting, for \"The Daily Telegraph\", said the orchestra \"often didn't add much beyond a vague sonic sludge\".\n\nReviewing the New York concert for \"Rolling Stone\", Jim Allen described Radio City as an \"appropriately dramatic, grandiose setting\", and added that McCulloch \"was in fine voice, growling and sneering wondrously\". Reviewing the Liverpool concert, Jade Wright wrote in the \"Liverpool Echo\" that McCulloch \"was on form – one part Lou Reed, one part Oliver Reed, with a bit of Jim Morrison thrown in for good measure.\"\n\nAll tracks written by Will Sergeant, Ian McCulloch, Les Pattinson and Pete de Freitas except where noted.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Meat and potato pie comes in many versions and consists of a pastry casing containing: potato, either lamb or beef, and sometimes carrot and/or onion.

A meat and potato pie has a similar filling to a Cornish Pasty and differs from a meat pie in that its content is usually less than 50% meat. They can be typically eaten as take-aways but are a homemade staple in many homes. Often it is served with red cabbage.\n\nIn 2004, ITV's \"The Paul O'Grady Show\" voted the produce of The Denby Dale Pie Company as the UK's best Meat and Potato Pie.\n\nIn 2017, Martin Appleton-Clare set a new speed eating record at the World Pie Eating Championship in Wigan, Greater Manchester.

As in the Order of the Eastern Star, members of the Order must be age 18 and older; men must be Master Masons; and women must be related to Masons as wives, mothers, daughters, widows, sisters, nieces, aunts, et cetera, or have been active members of the International Order of the Rainbow for Girls or Job's Daughters International for more than three years and be recommended by a Master Mason. (Note: As of 2017, women without masonic relationships may apply for membership with the sponsorship of two master masons in good standing.) \n\nAmaranth was based on the Amaranten order created by Queen Christina of Sweden in 1653 for the ladies and knights. It lasted only to 1654 when Christina of Sweden abdicated.\n\nIn 1860, James B. Taylor of Newark, New Jersey drew upon Queen Christina's order to create a new fraternal society. In 1873, Robert Macoy organized Taylor's society into the Order of the Amaranth, part of a proposed Adoptive Rite of Masonry. Eastern Star was to be the first degree, and until 1921, Amaranth members were required to join Eastern Star first.\n\nIn the Order's teachings, the members are emphatically reminded of their duties to God, to their country and to their fellow beings. They are urged to portray, by precept and example, their belief in the \"Golden Rule\" and by conforming to the virtues inherent in TRUTH, FAITH, WISDOM and CHARITY they can prove to others the goodness promulgated by the Order.\n\nAmaranth is organized into Courts, under Grand Courts at the State level. The primary body is called the Supreme Council (which has some subordinate Courts directly under it, as well). Women members of the Order are addressed as \"Honored Lady\", while men are referred to as \"Sir Knight\".\n\nThe officers of a Court are:\n\n\nThe Royal Matron, Royal Patron, Associate Matron, Associate Patron, Secretary, Treasurer, Conductress, Associate Conductress and the Trustees are elected by the members of the Court. All are elected annually with the exception of the Trustees, who serve three year terms. One Trustee is elected each year, with the senior Trustee serving as Chairman. The remaining officers are appointed each year by the Royal Matron-elect prior to installation. The elected officers – excluding Secretary, Treasurer and Trustees – are considered line officers and normally advance to the next office the following year: Associate Conductress becoming Conductress, Conductress becoming Associate Matron and so forth. These advancements are not automatic, however, and are subject to the affirmative vote of the members.\n\nThe order's primary philanthropic project is the Amaranth Diabetes Foundation. In the time that the order has been partnered with the Foundation, over $17,000,000 has been donated, funding many research projects. The insulin pump for diabetics is one such example of a project that received Amaranth funds. Additional projects may be designated by individual Grand jurisdictions and/or the local courts. The flag of the appropriate country is prominently displayed at all meetings.\n\n\n"}

On the show, Brown played the character of Officer Terry Webster.\n\nBrown was seven years old when his family moved from Havana to Harlem, NY. At 15, he formed the singing group 'The Parthenons', which had a single TV appearance shortly before breaking up. Brown quit high school at 16, after being invited to do so by a few frustrated teachers. He left New York to move to Los Angeles at 17. After a few years of not being sure what he wanted to do, he decided to go back to school. He passed the college entrance exam and was admitted to Los Angeles City College where he majored in Theater Arts to \"take something easy\". He ended up really enjoying it and returned to New York to attend the American Musical and Dramatic Academy. He worked as a school janitor to pay his tuition.\nHe met his wife Tyne Daly while at AMDA, where they both studied under Philip Burton, Richard Burton's mentor. They were married for 24 years, from 1966 to 1990. They have three daughters.\n\nBrown says he feels acting is just something he \"fell into\". Six months out of school, he appeared in Joseph Papp's New York Shakespeare Festival (now called Shakespeare in the Park), and next in \"The Comedians\" with Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor. His work then took him to Africa for four and a half months, Paris, then Southern France. And a chance meeting with Alex Haley who was on his way to Africa to work on a story he was writing (which turned out to be \"Roots\").\n\nDuring the 1960s, Brown had a variety of roles in films, including Henri Philipot in \"The Comedians\" (1967), Theon Gibson in \"Dayton's Devils\" (1968), and Dr. Willard in \"Bullitt\" (1968). His 1970s films included \"\" (1970), \"The Man\" (1972), and \"Wild in the Sky\" (1972), co-starring Brandon deWilde, as anti-war, anti-establishment guerrillas, who devise a scheme to destroy Fort Knox with an atomic bomb.\n\nBrown later played Tom Harvey (son of Chicken George, great-grandson of Kunta Kinte, and great-grandfather of Alex Haley) in the 1977 television miniseries \"Roots,\" and 1979's \".\"\n\nIn 1980, he starred in the TV movie \"The Night the City Screamed\", and in \"Stir Crazy\" opposite Gene Wilder and Richard Pryor. Later in 1984 he starred in the TV movie \"The Jesse Owens Story\" in the role of Lew Gilbert. He then went on to a supporting role in yet another miniseries \"North & South\" in 1985 as the character Garrison Grady.\n\nIn 1986, he won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Directing for a Drama Series for directing the final episode (\"Parting Shots\") in season 5 of \"Cagney & Lacey\". His directing career continued with the television film \"Alone in the Neon Jungle\" (also known by its earlier name \"Command in Hell\"), which was network premiered by CBS on Sunday January 17, 1988. It was characterised in \"The Washington Post\" by Tom Shales as 'a stupefyingly preposterous bungle, but only in its better moments', while a marginally more favourable assessment praised 'cop characters that are humanized with humor and the realistically gritty feel that comes with filming on location in Pittsburgh instead of Hollywood'.\n\nBrown co-starred in the comedy sequel \"House Party 2\" in 1991, and the Showtime television show \"Linc's\" from 1998 thru 2000. Brown also directed several second-season episodes of the television series \"Hill Street Blues.\" More recently, Brown had a recurring role on the FX drama series \"Nip/Tuck.\"\n"}

It was the first concept album by Kamelot. This album, along with its sequel \"The Black Halo\" (2005), is a rock opera inspired by the story of Goethe's Faust. Epica tells Part 1 while The Black Halo tells Part 2. (Goethe's Faust has two parts.) Most of the lyrics were written before the actual music was composed. The album inspired the naming of the band Epica after its release.\n\n\nThe story takes place at an unknown time and place on Earth. God has commanded all angels to serve alongside humans on the Earth, but one angel named Mephisto has refused to obey this order, claiming that he takes orders from God alone. For this, Mephisto is expelled from heaven. God eventually decides to give Mephisto one chance: If Mephisto can claim the soul of God's favorite man, an alchemist and scholar named Ariel, then can he return to heaven. If not, then Mephisto will be condemned to hell forever. (Prologue) Mephisto agrees and searches for Ariel.\n\nMeanwhile, Ariel is introduced, and he begins to ponder his research on the true meaning of life and why God created humans. (Center of the Universe) He concludes that neither science nor religion can truly answer these questions. Feeling restless, he decides to leave his home country to search for answers. He bids his farewell to everyone, including his lover Helena, as he departs on a quest for answers, vowing never to return. (Farewell) Years pass as Ariel searches. He becomes addicted to drugs, (Interlude I: Opiate Soul) and eventually turns to the occult, during which he sees a brief vision of Mephisto. (The Edge of Paradise) He begins to think of Helena, whom he misses greatly, while aimlessly walking through the wilderness, regretting his decision to leave. (Wander) He gives up his search and decides to commit suicide, believing that he will never find the answers he is looking for. (Interlude II: Omen) But before Ariel has the chance, Mephisto arrives and proposes a deal: Mephisto will help Ariel in his search for the questions, and fulfill all his worldly desires; in return, Mephisto will claim Ariel's soul when he dies. (Descent of the Archangel) Ariel is then mysteriously transported to Mephisto's castle, (Interlude III: At the Banquet) where the fallen angel throws a feast in his honor. At the feast, Ariel agrees to Mephisto's contract, but with one modification: Mephisto can only claim Ariel's soul if Ariel experiences joy so sublime that he wishes to live forever in that moment. Mephisto begrudgingly accepts this deal. (A Feast for the Vain)\n\nAfter leaving Mephisto's castle, Ariel is found by Helena, who has been searching for him over the years since he left. Ariel is shocked and overjoyed. (On the Coldest Winter Night) Ariel and Helena sleep together, and a child is conceived, unbeknownst to both of them. After spending some time with Helena, Ariel decides to leave and continue his search for the truth. With the newfound power that Mephisto has provided him, he feels that the answers are within his grasp. Ariel tells Helena of his intent to go, saying that, while he loves her, \"love means nothing to me, if there is a higher place to be.\" (Lost & Damned) After Ariel leaves, Helena is heartbroken and, vowing that she will continue to love Ariel even in death, drowns herself in a river, also unknowingly killing her unborn child. Both are brought to heaven at the plea of the river spirit. (Helena's Theme) Helena's body is then discovered, and a town crier announces her suicide. (Interlude IV: Dawn) After learning of Helena's suicide and pregnancy, Ariel becomes increasingly upset and weeps at the river where Helena died. (The Mourning After (Carry On))\n\nConsumed with grief, Ariel questions whether he should continue his quest. He blames both God and himself for Helena's death, but Mephisto encourages Ariel to continue his journey, claiming that human emotion will ultimately be their demise, calling it a curse. In Ariel's weakened state, Mephisto's influence over him grows, and he agrees to continue his quest. Helena watches him from heaven. (Ill Ways to Epica)\n\nAriel's story continues in \"The Black Halo\".\n\n\n"}

Editor Larry Hama hired him to write back-up stories for Marvel Comics' \"Savage Sword of Conan\". Writing under the name \"Charles Dixon\", he would eventually take over the lead feature of Conan on a semi-regular basis. He contributed stories to the Larry Hama edited re-boot of \"Savage Tales\" highlighted by a number of western stories illustrated by John Severin.\n\nIn 1986, he began working for Eclipse Comics, writing \"Airboy\" which was edited by Timothy Truman followed by cat yronwode for the bulk of its 50 issue run. Continuing to write for both Marvel and Eclipse on these titles, as well as launching \"Strike!\" with artist Tom Lyle in August 1987 and \"Valkyrie\" with artist Paul Gulacy in October 1987, he began work on Carl Potts' \"Alien Legion\" series for Marvel's Epic Comics imprint, under editor Archie Goodwin. He produced a three-issue adaptation of J. R. R. Tolkien's \"The Hobbit\" for Eclipse with artist David Wenzel between 1989 and 1990, and began writing \"Marc Spector: Moon Knight\" in June 1989 for editor Carl Potts.\n\n\"The Punisher Kingdom Gone\" graphic novel (August 1990) led to him working on the monthly \"The Punisher War Journal\" and later other \"Punisher\" titles, and brought him to the attention of DC Comics editor Dennis O'Neil, who asked him and Tom Lyle to produce a Robin mini-series featuring the Tim Drake incarnation. The series proved popular enough to spawn two sequels – \"The Joker's Wild\" (1991) and \"Cry of the Huntress\" (1992). This led to both an ongoing monthly series which Dixon wrote for 100 issues before leaving to work with CrossGen Comics, and to Dixon working on \"Detective Comics\" from #644 (May 1992) to #738 (Nov. 1999) through the major Batman stories \"'\" and \"KnightsEnd\" for which he helped create the key character of Bane, \"\", \"\", \"\", and \"No Man's Land\". Dixon and Lyle co-created the Electrocutioner in \"Detective Comics\" #644 (May 1992) and Stephanie Brown in \"Detective Comics\" #647 (August 1992). Much of his later run was illustrated by Graham Nolan.\n\nHe was DC's most prolific Batman writer in the 1990s in addition to writing \"Detective Comics\" he pioneered the individual series for \"Robin\", \"Nightwing\" (which he wrote for 70 issues, and returned to briefly with 2005's #101) and \"Batgirl\", as well as creating the team and book \"Birds of Prey\".\n\nWhile writing multiple \"Punisher\" and \"Batman\" comics and October 1994's \"Punisher/Batman\" crossover, he launched \"Team 7\" for Jim Lee's WildStorm/Image and \"Prophet\" for Rob Liefeld's Extreme Studios. He wrote many issues of \"Catwoman\" and \"Green Arrow\", regularly having about seven titles out each month between 1993 and 1998. In 1994, Dixon co-wrote the \"Batman-Spawn: War Devil\" intercompany crossover with Doug Moench and Alan Grant. Dixon and Tom Grummett crafted a \"Secret Six\" one-shot (Dec. 1997) as part of the Tangent Comics imprint.\n\nIn March 2002, Dixon turned his attention to CrossGen's output, slowly leaving \"Robin\", \"Nightwing\", \"Birds of Prey\" and \"Batgirl\" over the next year although he co-wrote with Scott Beatty the origin of Barbara Gordon's Batgirl in 2003's \"Batgirl: Year One\". For CrossGen he took over some of the comics of the departing Mark Waid, taking over \"Sigil\" from #21, and \"Crux\" with #13. He launched \"Way of the Rat\" in June 2002, \"Brath\" (March 2003), \"The Silken Ghost\" (June 2003) and the pirate comic \"El Cazador\" (Oct 2003), as well as editing Robert Rodi's non-Sigilverse \"The Crossovers\". He wrote the \"Ruse\" spin-off \"Archard's Agents\" one-shots in January and November 2003 and April 2004, the last released shortly before CrossGen's cancellation of all of its series.

In May 2006, he contributed to IDW Publishing's Free Comic Book Day \"Transformers\" giveaway, leading to Dixon writing the \"Transformers: Evolutions\" miniseries.\n\nIn July 2004, Dixon began his return to the DC Universe with \"Richard Dragon\", a revival of the 1970s kung-fu character, which ran for 12 issues. In March of the following year, he returned briefly to \"Nightwing\" before shifting his efforts to the Wildstorm imprint, writing the stand-alone \"Claw the Unconquered\" (Aug 2006 – Jan 2007); the movie-adaptation of \"Snakes on a Plane\", the movie-spin-off \"Nightmare on Elm Street\", and the Wildstorm Universe title \"Grifter/Midnighter\" from May 2007.\n\nIn January 2007, he wrote the \"Connor Hawke: Dragon's Blood\" mini-series featuring Green Arrow's son Connor Hawke, and in March 2008, Dixon returned to writing \"Robin\". He wrote \"Batman and the Outsiders\", a project he was signed to at the last minute, after original writer Tony Bedard dropped out due to being occupied with \"Final Crisis\"-related work. On June 10, 2008, Dixon announced on his forum that he was no longer \"employed by DC Comics in any capacity.\" He nonetheless did occasional work for DC after this, including 2017's \"Bane: Conquest\" limited series, and a special issue for Robin's 80th anniversary.\n\nIt was announced in August 2008 that he would write Dynamite Entertainment's series \"The Man with No Name\" based on the Western character.

This married Citroën's famous hydropneumatic suspension system to sophisticated electronics, enabling the handling of the car to automatically adapt to how it was being driven as well as virtually eliminating body roll (one of the main criticisms of Citroën's hydropneumatic system was the amount of body roll). The Hydractive system was soon to become available to the public first in Citroën's XM model 1989, and Xantia model 1993. In 1995 Activa prototypes' active anti-roll-bar was introduced in the Xantia Activa, making it one of the few production cars to have active suspension.\n\nThe Activa 1 included full hydraulically connected, single wheel independent four-wheel steering, anti-lock brakes and traction control, which were high-tech for the time, while the Activa 2 was more conventional, except the anti-roll-system and featured a center console keypad instead of a gear lever and a navigation system. In addition, the Activa 1 featured electronically operated doors which could all be opened at once using a remote control. Mechanically, the Activa 1 was powered by a 3.0L SOHC PRV 24 valve V6 engine producing at 6000 rpm and of torque at 3600 rpm, coupled to a 4-speed automatic transmission.

John Guthrie, a minister of the Evangelical Union church, and Anne Orr. He originally enrolled at Glasgow University to study law, but abandoned this in favour of painting in 1877. Unlike many of his contemporaries he did not study in Paris, being mostly self-taught, although he was mentored for a short time by James Drummond in Glasgow and then John Pettie in London.\n\nHe lived most of his life in the Scottish Borders, most notably in Cockburnspath, Berwickshire, where he painted some of his most important works, including \"A Hind's Daughter\" (1883), and \"Schoolmates\". He was strongly influenced by the French Realists, especially Jules Bastien-Lepage, and was associated with the Glasgow Boys.\n\nHe was elected an associate of the Royal Scottish Academy in 1888, and a full member in 1892. In November 1902 he was unanimously elected to succeed Sir George Reid as RSA president, and he was knighted the following year. In 1920 the King of Belgium conferred Guthrie with the Cross of Commander of the Order of the Crown. A member of Glasgow Art Club Guthrie exhibited often at the club's annual exhibitions.

Lutz was slated to direct the vampire feature \"Razorwire\", though the film never moved into production.\n\nAfter working on several of his projects, Lutz became a protégé of Hype Williams. Since the late 1990s, Lutz has directed dozens of music videos for popular artists and been noted for his high-budget, visually distinctive music videos for popular music singles, including videos for The Wanted, R. Kelly, Usher, Kanye West, Jay-Z, Korn, David Guetta, Nelly Furtado, Sean Paul, Justin Bieber, Drake, Nicki Minaj, T.I., Little Mix, Rihanna, Union J, Fifth Harmony, Miguel, One Direction, Zayn Malik and Iggy Azalea. In 2004, Lutz appeared in Mya Baker's documentary film \"Silence: In Search of Black Female Sexuality in America\".\n\nIn 2015, Lutz founded his own production company, Popp Rok, in Toronto. In 2017, he appeared on episode 7 of \"America's Next Top Model Cycle 23\", \"X Marks The Spot\", as the director for a Gypsy-Sports-themed music video.\n\nIn addition to music video direction, Lutz has directed two feature films and a television film; he made his feature directorial debut in 2015 with \"Across the Line.\" The film starred Stephan James and the storyline was inspired by the 1989 Cole Harbour District High School race riots.\n\n\"Across the Line\" was set and shot in Nova Scotia. The first screening of \"Across the Line\" was 19 September 2015 at the Atlantic Film Festival where it won the award for Best Atlantic Feature. The film opened for limited in British Columbia and Ontario on 8 April 2016, with screenings in various Canadian cities throughout that month. The \"National Post\" assessed the film at 2.5/4 stars, noting the story's unwavering focus on racial themes was \"to the detriment of the film's depth and realism\" but noted that video producer Director X \"makes the transition to feature film-making look easy\". In 2017, the film was the subject of an episode of \"The Filmmakers\", the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation's web talk series on Canadian film.\n\nIn 2016, he directed the teen drama television film \"\".

Fleet Secondary Modern School, the earliest school in the town, moved into the site in 1960 and reopened as Court Moor School on 11 May. At the time, the school had only one building, 500 students and 20 teachers. Court Moor became a comprehensive school in 1974 and is part of the Hart school district.\n\nThe school is adjacent to the Basingstoke Canal and part of its site is designated a nature conservation area. The school gate is narrow because it was originally intended to be the trade entrance. Local residents were worried about the consequences of having the intended main gate opening onto their estate and it was never widened.\n\nThe Department for Education and Skills (DFES) recorded that in 2000 some 70% of all pupils leaving the school that year had attained five or more GCSE A*-C results, well above the national average of 49%. League tables for 2005, indicate that 76% of all pupils taking exams that year gained 5 or more A*-C results. The school was awarded Science College status in 2004. The school was inspected by OFSTED in 2009, where it received a rating of \"outstanding\" overall. The school was last inspected by OFSTED in 2013, where it received a rating of \"good\" overall.\n\nThe House System came to Court Moor School in late 2010, bringing in a change in the way the school was organised. It has changed the Celebration of Achievement events and has introduced a certain measure of charity fund raising to the school. The four houses are: Brunel, Austen, Nightingale and Wellington. They all raise money for one chosen charity, that is decided each year by the students.\n\nCourt Moor's Student Council is made up of form representatives, year representatives, the head boy and the head girl. Student Council meetings are attended by two representatives from each year, the head boy, the head girl and the permanent teacher representatives - the head teacher, chairman of the governors and the site manager.\n\nThe Student Council Committee has successfully worked with other aspects of the school to improve the school society. It has planned and implemented projects such as the picnic bench shelters, funded by the schools PTA, and the schools newspaper (The CMS Newspaper).\n\nIn 2012 the Student Council entered the CMS Newspaper into the Speaker of the House of Commons's School Council Awards. Although not shortlisted, each school received the \"We made a difference\" web badge, that was on the school's website.\n\nThe CMS Newspaper (Court Moor School Newspaper) was set up in 2012 by the Student Council. It successfully launched its first Issue on Thursday, 29 March. It has since been replaced with regular PowerPoints made in a after-school club.\n\nCourt Moor School has won several awards.\nThese include: Fairtrade school status; 'A school using the Olympic Values' recognition; Science College status; The UNICEF Rights Respecting School Mark; The Arts Council of England's Arts Mark; An ICT School Mark and a Speakers School Council \"We made a difference\" recognition in 2012.\n\n\n\n"}

By 1980, Bergamini had recruited singer Simona Buja, keyboardist Fabrizio Chiari and bassist Mauro Montacchini to form Kirlian Camera. Their demo cassette Dawn attracted the attention of Italian Records, a popular independent label. Christmas 1981 saw the release of their debut vinyl which despite being low-budget immediately sold-out prompting a re-issued, with it finally selling more than 6000 copies.\n\nNot long after the band had constant lineup changes, Simona left but rejoins straight away then the following year, Montacchini leaves being replaced by Giorgio Vecchi. Eventually they were the first Italian group to be signed to Virgin Records.\n\nBetween 1982 and 1984, Bergamini also took part in the Italian Italo disco group Hipnosis, which won a platinum award for sales in Germany, and had a top-10 hit in several European countries and South America with their single \"Pulstar\". Angelo unexpectedly decides to leave the pop-music the concentrate on Kirlian Camera.\n\nDuring the second half of the Eighties, the sound of Kirlian Camera became gradually darker, moving away from the synth pop sound that marked some of their early releases. In 1988, Buja leaves Kirlian Camera and the band have temporary singers Bianca Hoffmann-Santos and Suzanne Reddington-Gardner who are replaced for a while by Emilia Lo Jacono. Despite this the band release a 2-CD collection called \"The Ice Curtain\" with new singer, Barbara Boffelli.\n\nIn 1993, they signed to German label Discordia, which licensed the self-produced album \"Todesengel, The Fall of Life\". 1995 came to see them collaborate with label mates Dive on the Obsession EP and :Wumpscut: .\n\nDuring 2000 the lineup is stabilized when talented singer/composer/writer Elena Alice Fossi joins Kirlian Camera. She is also the leader of side-projects Alice Neve Fox, Spectra*paris and Siderartica, and co-leader in the Stalingrad project (nowadays renamed as Stalingrad Valkyrie) with Bergamini himself.\n\nDuring 2013, Kirlian Camera release \"Black Summer Choirs\".\n\nOn late 2017, the band of Elena Alice Fossi and Angelo Bergamini releases the hit-single \"Sky Collapse\" (featuring Eskil Simonsson of Covenant) via Dependent Records, that immediately gains some remarkable success in Central Europe, reaching position nr. 1 in the German Alternative Charts. After a few months, 2018, the new album \"Hologram Moon\" (released on standard and special edition including the bonus album \"Ghost Novas\") quickly becomes the real best-seller of the band ever as far as a full-length studio work is concerned, even entering the official German music charts and keeping position nr.1 on the German Alternative charts for several weeks. Elena Alice Fossi definitely becomes one of the most appreciated singers ever on the global electronic music scene.\n\nOn 26 April 1999, Kirlian Camera were drawn into the then-current sensationalism over Goth culture when they were off-handedly mentioned by social scientist Alfred Schobert in \"Der Spiegel\", in an interview printed as a sidebar to a 4-page newspaper feature on the Columbine High School shootings. Schobert contended that the group (along with Death in June and Boyd Rice) was an example of a \"neo-fascist element\" in contemporary goth and EBM music, and accused them of performing a Roman salute onstage.\n\nIn their next cd, the group issued a communique, stating that they were offended by the witch hunt against them, but that they wanted to keep their political opinion to themselves, refusing to place the band within one specific political orientation. They denied that they were \"right wing extremists\", pointing out that past member Nancy Appiah was Ghanaian, and that they sing lyrics by the Jewish-German poet August Stramm. However, they were not allowed to respond in der Spiegel, and as a result show cancellations and protests by Anti-Fascist Action continued to dog them up through 2002.\n\n\n\n"}

He served as a delegate to the Continental Congress and, while in Congress, signed the Articles of Confederation. He also served as President of Pennsylvania's Supreme Executive Council, a position analogous to the modern office of Governor.\n\nReed was born in Trenton in the Province of New Jersey in 1741, the son of Andrew Reed, a shopkeeper and merchant, and Theodosia Bowes. His grandfather, Joseph Reed (1650–1727), was born in Carrickfergus, County Antrim in Ulster and settled in West Jersey. His brother, Bowes Reed (1740–1794), would serve as a colonel in the Revolutionary War and as Secretary of State of New Jersey. The family moved to Philadelphia shortly after Reed's birth and, as a boy, Reed was enrolled at Philadelphia Academy (later to be known as the University of Pennsylvania). He received his bachelor's degree from the College of New Jersey (later known as Princeton University) in 1757 and, soon after, began his professional education under Richard Stockton. In the summer of 1763, Reed sailed for England, where, for two years, he continued his studies in law at Middle Temple in London.\n\nDuring the course of his studies, Reed became romantically attached to Esther de Berdt, the daughter of the agent for the Province of Massachusetts Bay, Dennis de Berdt. Though very fond of Reed, de Berdt was aware of Reed's intention to return to Philadelphia and initially refused consent for Esther to marry Reed. Reed returned to the Colonies with only a tenuous engagement to Esther, and with an understanding that he would return to settle permanently in Great Britain shortly after. Following the death of his father, Reed finally returned to London to find that Esther's father had died during Reed's return trip to Britain. Reed and Esther married in May 1770 at Saint Luke's, Cripplegate, near the City of London. Finding the de Berdt family in financial difficulties, Reed remained in London long enough to help settle his wife's family's affairs. Together with the widowed Mrs. de Berdt, Esther and Reed sailed for North America in October 1770.\n\nThe Reeds would have five children: Joseph, who would become a prominent lawyer; Denis de Berdt; George Washington, who would become a Navy commander; Esther; and Martha.\n\nAt the beginning of the Revolutionary War, Reed ran a successful Philadelphia law practice, from which he resigned at the request of George Washington. In 1775, Reed held the rank of colonel and he subsequently served in the capacity of secretary and aide-de-camp to Washington.\n\nOn October 20, 1775, Reed wrote a famous letter to Colonel John Glover of the \"Marblehead Men\" Regiment of seamen in the Continental Army, setting the design of the First Navy Flag, the Evergreen Tree of Liberty flag. Colonel Glover was the owner of the \"Hannah\" vessel (named for his wife) and was the action officer, along with Stephen Moylan, for commissioning the other First Navy ships (\"Franklin\", \"Hancock\", \"Harrison\", \"Lee\", \"Lynch\", \"Warren\", and \"Washington\"), often called the \"Washington Cruisers\". Reed wrote: \"What do you think of a Flag with a white Ground, a tree in the middle, the motto: \"Appeal to Heaven\".\"\n\nIn 1775, Reed commenced service as Adjutant-General of the Continental Army. In this service he became one of General Washington's closest confidants; Washington wrote letters to him frequently and rarely traveled or made any substantial military decision without first consulting Reed. In December 1776, anxious to know the location of General Charles Lee's forces following the Continental Army's chaotic retreat from Manhattan, Washington opened a letter from Lee to Reed which indicated that they were both having serious doubts about Washington's decision-making and abilities. This was extremely disconcerting to Washington, as Reed was one of his most trusted officers. Reed continued to serve in the army without pay until the close of the war; although, with fewer than three years in the Continental Army, Reed is not listed as a Propositi of the Society of the Cincinnati. Though he took part in many military engagements in the northern and eastern theaters of the war, Reed was never wounded. In 1777, Reed was offered the positions of brigadier general and Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, both of which he declined. He was elected to Congress in 1778, whilst also serving as President (Governor) in Pennsylvania.\n\nReed has been recognized for his integrity, and when offered a bribe of £10,000, as well as the most valuable office in the colonies, to promote the cause of colonial reconciliation with the British crown, Reed's reply was, \"I am not worth purchasing; but, such as I am, the King of Great Britain is not rich enough to do it.\" As a delegate to the Continental Congress, Reed accused Benedict Arnold of military malpractice whilst the latter was in command at Philadelphia. The subsequent court martial largely exonerated Arnold and received strong opposition from other members of Congress.\n\nIn 1778, Reed was one of the five delegates from Pennsylvania to sign the Articles of Confederation. On December 1, 1778, he was elected President of the Supreme Executive Council of Pennsylvania, a position analogous to the modern office of governor. Reed received 61 of the 63 votes and assumed office immediately. George Bryan, acting president since the death of Thomas Wharton on May 23, 1778, received only one vote for president, but was re-elected to the vice-presidency with an overwhelming majority similar to Reed's final tally. Reed was re-elected to the presidency twice – on November 11, 1779, and November 14, 1780 – each time defeating William Moore, with a final count of 59 to 1 at the second election. Reed's third and final term came to a close on November 15, 1781, when he was eventually succeeded by Moore.\n\nDuring Reed's tenure as president, in addition to prosecuting Benedict Arnold, Reed oversaw the abolition of slavery in Pennsylvania and the awarding of Revolutionary soldiers with lifelong \"half-pay\". Pennsylvania passed a law for the gradual abolition of slavery in 1780.\n\nReed's antipathy to Pennsylvania's Loyalist residents has been well attested by historic sources. Whilst in Congress, he advocated for the seizure of Loyalist properties and treason charges for those aligned with Great Britain (Reed and his family then lived in a confiscated Loyalist home). In an overall sense, Congress regarded the Loyalist citizens in a more tolerant manner. As the President of Pennsylvania, Reed oversaw numerous trials of suspected Loyalists. After James Wilson defended 23 people accused of treason, a mob, stirred up by Reed's speeches and their own liquor consumption, attacked Wilson in what was to be later known as the \"Battle of Fort Wilson\"; only the arrival of cavalry saved Wilson and his friends. Following the cavalry's handling of the conflict, Reed pardoned and released the remaining rioters.\n\nReed's term as President of Pennsylvania corresponded with the transformation of America's wartime fortunes from desolation, at Valley Forge from December 1777 to May 1778, into victory, at Yorktown on October 19, 1781. Working with James Madison in the Continental Congress, Reed passed a bill that resulted in the surrounding of Charles Cornwallis' army. Once the bill was validated, General Anthony Wayne gathered the resources that were necessary for the Pennsylvania Line to march to Yorktown to engage in the historic siege.\n\nOn the other hand, Pennsylvania went bankrupt in 1780 due to Constitutionalist policies which mandated state-controlled markets and self-imposed embargoes. Ultimately the state called on Robert Morris to restore the economy. He did so by opening the ports to trade, and allowing the market to set the value of goods and the currency. Morris and his allies supplied the majority of war materials to the troops when the state failed to act.\n\nIn 1784, Reed visited England with the hope of improving his health but was not successful. He returned to Pennsylvania and died in Philadelphia on March 5, 1785, at the age of 43. Reed was buried in Philadelphia's Laurel Hill Cemetery in 1868.\n\n\n"}

For the role of producer, Osbourne worked with Linda Perry, widely known for working with artists such as Christina Aguilera, Pink, Courtney Love and Gwen Stefani.\n\nThe Japanese edition of the album contains a cover of the 1986 Stacey Q song \"Two of Hearts\" as a bonus track.\n\nThe album received mixed to positive reviews from music critics, many of which beginning with an admonition to forget about her previous work. \"Billboard\" said \"the singer sounds incredibly at home in such surroundings.\" Giving the album three out of five stars, \"Rolling Stone\" called it an \"occasionally invigorating disc of shiny dance rock\". In a C+ review, \"Entertainment Weekly\" writer Timothy Gunatilaka wrote: \"'Redlight' and 'I Can't Wait' make for fine party starters, and there are fairly groovy beats throughout.

Not long after the albums release, Osbourne's record label Sanctuary dropped her due to the album's commercial underperformance.\n\nOsbourne promoted the album with several appearances on TV shows and award ceremonies, including \"\", and the MTV Australia Video Music Awards 2005. Osbourne also made an appearance on \"Friday Night with Jonathan Ross\", during which Ross made comments on Osbourne's weight in regards to the album cover, saying she had been \"airbrushed\". Osbourne later said of the appearance: \"The band that was performing was New Order and they refused to play until he apologised. A lot of it wasn't shown on TV because if they saw what he really said to me, I don't think any parent in the world would ever watch his show again. What he said to me destroyed me for two years.\" Osbourne also said Ross' comments caused her to \"sabotage\" her record deal: \"I thought, 'What the fuck is the point in me doing this shit when a grown man insults me in this way? I'm not strong enough to do this. I'd rather be the trust-fund kid that everyone thinks I am than work my arse off to get insulted.'\" She admitted herself to rehab in June 2005, which stopped any further promotion for the album.\n\nAll songs written by Linda Perry, except where noted.\n\nJapanese edition bonus track\n\nOne Word was released as the first and only single from the album. It debuted and peaked at number nine on the UK Singles Chart on 25th May 2005 where it lasted seven weeks on the chart.

His sister was Jean Cadell a well-known actress. From the age of 16 he studied in Paris at the Académie Julian, where he was in contact with the French avant-garde of the day. While in France, his exposure to work by the early Fauvists, and in particular Matisse, proved to be his most lasting influence. After his return to Scotland, he was a regular exhibitor in Edinburgh and Glasgow, as well as in London.\nCadell was a left-handed painter. While a student, the President of the Royal Scottish Academy tried to stop him painting with his left hand because 'No artist ever became great who did so.' Cadell swiftly replied 'Sir and did not the great Michelangelo paint with his left hand?' The President did not respond and left the room quickly. A fellow student asked Cadell how he had known that Michelangelo was left-handed. Cadell confessed 'I didn't know but nor did the president.'\n\nCadell spent much of his adult life in Scotland and had little direct contact with many of the new ideas that were being developed abroad. He therefore tended to use subjects and environments that were close at hand – landscapes, fashionable Edinburgh New Town house interiors, still life and figures in both oil and watercolour. He is particularly noted for his portraits of glamorous women whom he painted in a loose, impressionistic manner, depicting his subject with vibrant waves of colour. He enjoyed the landscape of Iona enormously, which he first visited in 1912 and features prominently in his work. During the 1920s he spent several summers with Samuel Peploe, another Scottish Colourist, on painting trips to Iona, and was also friends with the Scottish architect Reginald Fairlie.\n\nFollowing the death of his close friend Ivor Campbell, in World War I, he enlisted, serving in the 9th Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders and the 9th Royal Scots regiments.\n\nHe lived at 6 and 22 Ainslie Place, Edinburgh from 1920-1932. During this time he befriended Reginald Fairlie who lived at 7 Ainslie Place and they remained friends thereafter. He then lived at 30 Regent Terrace from 1932-1935 where he found it more and more difficult to sell his paintings because of the economic climate. He finally moved to 4 Warriston Crescent where he died on 6 December 1937. He is buried with his family in Dean Cemetery. The grave lies on the southern boundary wall of the main cemetery. Although Cadell failed to make much income from his paintings it would be wholly wrong (as some claim) to say he died \"in poverty\". As his houses reflect, he was from a very wealthy family, and it is more correct to say he was largely financially supported by his family.\n\nIn 1932, Cadell was mugged, and in 1935 was severely injured in a fall from a tram car. He died of cancer in 1937.\n\nTwo of his paintings were offered for over £500,000 in 2009.\n\nCadell's Estate is represented by Portland Gallery, London.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2057516", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2057516", "title": "N-Butyllithium", "text": "N-Butyllithium\n\nn\"-Butyllithium (abbreviated n\"-BuLi) is an organolithium reagent. It is widely used as a polymerization initiator in the production of elastomers such as polybutadiene or styrene-butadiene-styrene (SBS). Also, it is broadly employed as a strong base (superbase) in the synthesis of organic compounds as in the pharmaceutical industry.\n\nButyllithium is commercially available as solutions (15%, 25%,1.5 M, 2 M, 2.5 M, 10 M, etc.) in alkanes such as pentane, hexanes, and heptanes. Solutions in diethyl ether and THF can be prepared, but are not stable enough for storage. Annual worldwide production and consumption of butyllithium and other organolithium compounds is estimated at 1800 tonnes.\n\nAlthough butyllithium is colorless, \"n-\"butyllithium is usually encountered as a pale yellow solution in alkanes. Such solutions are stable indefinitely if properly stored, but in practice, they degrade upon aging. Fine white precipitate (lithium hydroxide) is deposited and the color changes to orange.\n\n\"n\"-BuLi exists as a cluster both in the solid state and in a solution. The tendency to aggregate is common for organolithium compounds. The aggregates are held together by delocalized covalent bonds between lithium and the terminal carbon of the butyl chain. In the case of \"n\"-BuLi, the clusters are tetrameric (in ether) or hexameric (in cyclohexane). The cluster is a distorted cubane-type cluster with Li and \"C\"HR groups at alternating vertices. An equivalent description describes the tetramer as a Li tetrahedron interpenetrated with a tetrahedron [\"C\"HR]. Bonding within the cluster is related to that used to describe diborane, but more complex since eight atoms are involved. Reflecting its \"electron-deficient character,\" \"n\"-butyllithium is highly reactive toward Lewis bases.\n\nDue to the large difference between the electronegativities of carbon (2.55) and lithium (0.98), the C-Li bond is highly polarized. The charge separation has been estimated to be 55-95%. For practical purposes, n-BuLi can often be considered to react as the butyl anion, \"n\"-Bu, and a lithium cation, Li.\n\nThe standard preparation for \"n\"-BuLi is reaction of 1-bromobutane or 1-chlorobutane with Li metal:\nIf the lithium used for this reaction contains 1–3% sodium, the reaction proceeds more quickly than if pure lithium is used. Solvents used for this preparation include benzene, cyclohexane, and diethyl ether. When BuBr is the precursor, the product is a homogeneous solution, consisting of a mixed cluster containing both LiBr and BuLi, together with a small amount of octane. BuLi forms a weaker complex with LiCl, so that the reaction of BuCl with Li produces a precipitate of LiCl.\n\nSolutions of butyllithium, which are susceptible to degradation by air, are standardized by titration. A popular weak acid is biphenyl-4-methanol, which gives a deeply colored dilithio derivative at the end point.\n\nButyllithium is principally valued as an initiator for the anionic polymerization of dienes, such as butadiene. The reaction is called \"carbolithiation\":\nIsoprene can be polymerized stereospecifically in this way. Also of commercial importance is the use of butyllithium for the production of styrene-butadiene polymers. Even ethylene will insert into BuLi.\n\nButyllithium is a strong base (pK ≈ 50), but it is also a powerful nucleophile and reductant, depending on the other reactants. Furthermore, in addition to being a strong nucleophile, n-BuLi binds to aprotic Lewis bases, such as ethers and tertiary amines, which partially disaggregate the clusters by binding to the lithium centers. Its use as a strong base is referred to as metalation. Reactions are typically conducted in tetrahydrofuran and diethyl ether, which are good solvents for the resulting organolithium derivatives (see below).\n\nOne of the most useful chemical properties of \"n\"-BuLi is its ability to deprotonate a wide range of weak Brønsted acids. \"t\"-Butyllithium and \"s\"-butyllithium are more basic. \"n\"-BuLi can deprotonate (that is, metalate) many types of C-H bonds, especially where the conjugate base is stabilized by electron delocalization or one or more heteroatoms (non carbon atoms). Examples include acetylenes (\"H\"-CC-R), methyl sulfides (\"H\"-CHSR), thioacetals (\"H\"-CH(SR), e.g. dithiane), methylphosphines (\"H\"-CHPR), furans, thiophenes and ferrocene (Fe(\"H\"-CH)(CH)). In addition to these, it will also deprotonate all more acidic compounds such as alcohols, amines, enolizable carbonyl compounds, and any overtly acidic compounds, to produce alkoxides, amides, enolates and other -ates of lithium, respectively. The stability and volatility of the butane resulting from such deprotonation reactions is convenient, but can also be a problem for large-scale reactions because of the volume of a flammable gas produced.\n\nThe kinetic basicity of \"n\"-BuLi is affected by the solvent or cosolvent. Ligands that complex Li such as tetrahydrofuran (THF), tetramethylethylenediamine (TMEDA), hexamethylphosphoramide (HMPA), and 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO) further polarize the Li-C bond and accelerate the metalation. Such additives can also aid in the isolation of the lithiated product, a famous example of which is dilithioferrocene.\n\nSchlosser's base is a superbase produced by treating butyllithium with potassium tert-butoxide. It is kinetically more reactive than butyllithium and is often used to accomplish difficult metalations. The butoxide anion complexes the lithium and effectively produces butylpotassium, which is more reactive than the corresponding lithium reagent.\n\nAn example of the use of n-butyllithium as a base is the addition of an amine to methyl carbonate to form a methyl carbamate, where n-butyllithium serves to deprotonate the amine:\n\nButyllithium reacts with some organic bromides and iodides in an exchange reaction to form the corresponding organolithium derivative. The reaction usually fails with organic chlorides and fluorides:\n\nThis reaction is useful for preparation of several types of RLi compounds, particularly aryllithium and some vinyllithium reagents. The utility of this method is significantly limited, however, by the presence in the reaction mixture of n-BuBr or n-BuI, which can react with the RLi reagent formed, and by competing dehydrohalogenation reactions, in which n-BuLi serves as a base:\n\nThese side reaction are significantly less important for RI than for RBr, since the iodine-lithium exchange is several orders of magnitude faster than the bromine-lithium exchange. For these reasons, aryl, vinyl and primary alkyl iodides are the preferred substrates, and t-BuLi rather than n-BuLi is usually used, since the formed t-BuI is immediately destroyed by the t-BuLi in a dehydrohalogenation reaction (thus requiring 2 equiv of t-BuLi). Alternatively, vinyl lithium reagents can be generated by direct reaction of the vinyl halide (e.g. cyclohexenyl chloride) with lithium or by tin-lithium exchange (see next section).\n\nA related family of reactions are the transmetalations, wherein two organometallic compounds exchange their metals. Many examples of such reactions involve Li exchange with Sn:\nThe tin-lithium exchange reactions have one major advantage over the halogen-lithium exchanges for the preparation of organolithium reagents, in that the product tin compounds (CHSnMe in the example above) are much less reactive towards lithium reagents than are the halide products of the corresponding halogen-lithium exchanges (CHBr or CHCl). Other metals and metalloids which undergo such exchange reactions are organic compounds of mercury, selenium, and tellurium.\n\nOrganolithium reagents, including \"n\"-BuLi are used in synthesis of specific aldehydes and ketones. One such synthetic pathway is the reaction of an organolithium reagent with disubstituted amides:\n\nTHF is deprotonated by butyllithium, especially in the presence of TMEDA, by loss of one of four protons adjacent to oxygen. This process, which consumes butyllithium to generate butane, induces a reverse cycloaddition to give enolate of acetaldehyde and ethylene. Therefore, reactions of BuLi in THF are typically conducted at low temperatures, such as –78 °C, as is conveniently produced by a freezing bath of dry ice/acetone. Higher temperatures (−25 °C or even −15 °C) are also used.\n\nWhen heated, \"n\"-BuLi, analogously to other alkyllithium reagents with \"β-hydrogens\", undergoes β-hydride elimination to produce 1-butene and lithium hydride (LiH):\n\nAlkyl-lithium compounds are stored under inert gas to prevent loss of activity and for reasons of safety. \"n\"-BuLi reacts violently with water:\nBuLi also reacts with CO to give lithium pentanoate:\n\n\n"}

The X3J13 committee was formed in 1986 to draw up an American National Standards Institute (ANSI) Common Lisp standard based on the first edition of the book \"Common Lisp the Language\" (also termed \"CLtL\", or \"CLtL1\"), by Guy L. Steele Jr., which was formerly a \"de facto\" standard for the language. The primary output of X3J13 was an American National Standard for programming language Common Lisp (X3.226/1994), approved December 8, 1994. X3J13 later worked with International Organization for Standardization (ISO) working group SC22/WG16 on an internationally standardised dialect of Lisp named ISLISP.\n\nThe original chair of the committee was Doctor Robert Mathis of Ohio State University, with Mary van Deusen as secretary. Guy L. Steele Jr. was originally the vice-chair. In later years, Mathis stepped down as chair and Steele assumed that role.\n\nThe efforts of the committee were guided by its charter, the successful creation of which is credited to the coordinating efforts of Susan P. Ennis, a representative of Amoco Production Company. The charter lays out the committee's goals and priorities, and a broadly defined list of some topics to be addressed.\n\nThe committee formed several subcommittees to help its members better concentrate their efforts.\n\nThe Cleanup Subcommittee, chaired by Larry Masinter, established a standardised format for the submission of proposals for voting. These issue writeups, while not themselves part of the standard, were deemed sufficiently useful for the Common Lisp HyperSpec to include and cross-reference them for the benefit of readers, providing information about the original intent of the committee in its decisions. These writeups also serve as a historical record of those alternate solutions to problems which were, ultimately, not adopted.\n\nChaired by Sandra Loosemore, this subcommittee created proposals for issues relating to Lisp compiling. Guy Steele acknowledged in the second edition of \"Common Lisp the Language\" the large contribution of the Compiler Subcommittee toward clarifying the compiling process described in the first edition, parts of which Steele describes as \"vague\".\n\nJon L. White was the chair of the Iteration Subcommittee. Among the issues dealt with by this group was the generalized codice_1 macro – a domain-specific language to which the second edition of \"CLtL\" devotes a full chapter. The \"ALGOL-like\" syntax of this macro, differing from Lisp's more usual s-expression syntax, was and remains somewhat controversial.\n\nThe Character Subcommittee, chaired by Thom Linden, had the task of defining how the standard would deal with the issues surrounding different character sets. The resolution of these matters, particularly the ability to use any character in the name of a symbol, was intended to make Common Lisp simpler for international users.\n\nChaired by Kent Pitman, the Error Handling Subcommittee plugged what was described as \"the biggest outstanding hole in Common Lisp\" with the condition system, a general mechanism for handling errors, warnings, and other exceptional situations.\n\nThe committee referred to the resulting specification as a \"condition system\" rather than an \"error system\" to accommodate one system for handling exceptional situations of various kinds, whether fatal or non-fatal, whether continuable or not, and whether the result of program error or simple resource limit (such as stack overflow). Conditions are \"signaled\" at one point in the code and may be handled at another point. This use of the term \"signal\" is different from the typical operating system's notion of signals (except on Lisp machines where this variant use of the term evolved); the operating system notion of signaling was out of scope for this committee, and consequently was not addressed in the ANSI Common Lisp standard. Asynchronous interrupts and IEEE floating point trapping was also out of scope for this committee's work and was not addressed in the standard.\n\nKathy Chapman was the chair for the Drafting Subcommittee, which was responsible for the drafting of the actual standard document. Further, the subcommittee oversaw efforts to keep terminology consistent and accurate throughout the committee's activities.\n\nThe final standard produced by the X3J13 committee was published as American National Standard X3.226, and also in hypertext form as the Common Lisp HyperSpec.\n\nThe book \"Common Lisp the Language\", although authored mostly by Guy L. Steele Jr., was the product of an ad hoc committee that had formed around 1980 and had worked collaboratively to produce the original \"de facto\" standard for Common Lisp before the formation of X3J13. X3J13 began its work with \"Common Lisp the Language\" as a base document and proceeded from there in the design of what would become ANSI Common Lisp. Steele served on the committee and gave them permission to use any or all parts of its first edition in their efforts.\n\nDocuments published by X3J13 were later used, together with quotations from certain committee members, in the production of \"Common Lisp the Language\" Second Edition, which was released in 1990, giving the Common Lisp community a way to preview many features that were expected to appear in the committee's final standard document. That edition bears similarity to the standard in content, though not in form. However, substantive changes were made, in the form of both additions and deletions, between the publication of the book and the final draft of the ANSI standard.\n\nIn sum, the original edition of \"Common Lisp the Language\" was the document on which X3J13 originally based its work. The Second Edition, by contrast, was Steele's own work, not a committee product and had no official status within X3J13 or ANSI. As acknowledged in the Second Edition preface, it was not authorized by X3J13, the choice of content as a snapshot of the work in progress was not formally synchronized with X3J13, and the final version was not reviewed or approved by X3J13.\n\n\n"}

In 1948, it started \"Line\", a \"magazine for elegant women\", as well as a French edition of the Belgian \"Tintin\" magazine.\n\nIn 1960, Dargaud bought the weekly \"Pilote\" magazine from René Goscinny, Albert Uderzo, and Jean-Michel Charlier. Goscinny continued as editor of the magazine, and Charlier was album editor for a period. In October 1961, Dargaud published the first \"Asterix\" album.\n\nIn 1974, Dargaud wanted to diversify, and \"Pilote\" became a monthly magazine, and spawned two other monthly magazines. The new magazines were \"Lucky Luke Mensuel\" (a Western themed magazine around the series \"Lucky Luke\") and \"Achille Talon Magazine\" (a humor based magazine around the series \"Achille Talon\"). However, both magazines could not sustain a readership and folded within a year. The comics from these two magazines were put back into \"Pilote\".\n\nIn 1988, Dargaud was acquired by Média-Participations. Two years later, it sold the weekly gardening and do-it-yourself magazine to Média-Participations as well.\n\nIn 1992, the publisher Le Lombard became a part of Dargaud, followed in 1993 by Les Éditions Blake et Mortimer.

As described in Jesus had been fasting for forty days and nights prior to the temptation. The word \"minister\" or \"served\" is often interpreted as the angels feeding Jesus. France states that this seems to reference where the prophet Elijah is fed by angels. Traditionally artists have depicted the scene as Jesus being presented with a feast. John Milton in \"Paradise Regained\" has a detailed description of the feast the angels present to Jesus. Clarke notes that ending the temptation narrative with a meal reflects the common literary device of using a feast scene to emphasize a happy ending. That the divine angels provide Jesus with the food is a clear sign that it is acceptable for him to break his fast. To Jones the divine relief is proof that Jesus was never wrong because he never lost his faith in God during the temptation scene. Hill notes that in the War Scroll found at Qumran angels are described as forming an army to battle evil. This is somewhat at odds with the portrayal of angels in the gospels, but could in theory be linked to this verse with the angels actually aiding in driving off Satan rather than simply ministering to Jesus.\n\nSome early manuscripts containing the text of this verse are:\n"}

Driven from his throne, Metabus is chased into the wilderness by armed Volsci, his infant daughter in his hands. The river Amasenus blocked his path, and, fearing for the child's welfare, Metabus bound her to a spear. He promised Diana that Camilla would be her servant, a warrior virgin. He then safely threw her to the other side, and swam across to retrieve her. The baby Camilla was suckled by a mare, and once her \"first firm steps had [been] taken, the small palms were armed with a keen javelin; her sire a bow and quiver from her shoulder slung.\" She was raised in her childhood to be a huntress and kept the companionship of her father and the shepherds in the hills and woods.\n\nModern scholars are unsure if Camilla was entirely an original invention of Virgil, or represents some actual Roman myth. In his book \"Virgil's Aeneid: Semantic Relations and Proper Names\", Michael Paschalis speculates that Virgil chose the river Amasenus (today the Amaseno, near Priverno, ancient Privernum) as a poetic allusion to the Amazons with whom Camilla is associated.\n\nIn the \"Aeneid\", she helped her ally, King Turnus of the Rutuli, fight Aeneas and the Trojans in the war sparked by the courting of Princess Lavinia. Arruns, a Trojan ally, stalked Camilla on the battlefield, and, when she was opportunely distracted by her pursuit of Chloreus, killed her. Diana's attendant, Opis, at her mistress' behest, avenged Camilla's death by slaying Arruns. Virgil says that Camilla was so fast on her feet that she could run over a field of wheat without breaking the tops of the plants, or over the ocean without wetting her feet.\n\nGiovanni Boccaccio's \"De mulieribus claris\" includes a segment on Camilla. She is not often a subject in art, but the female figure in \"Pallas and the Centaur\" by Sandro Botticelli (c. 1482, Uffizi) was called \"Camilla\" in the earliest record of the painting, an inventory of 1499, but then in an inventory of 1516 she is called Minerva, which remains her usual identification in recent times. She was the subject of an internationally successful opera, \"Camilla\" by Giovanni Bononcini (1696).\n\nCamilla is similar to Penthesilea of Greek mythology.\n\n"}
{"id": "2057583", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2057583", "title": "Husein Gradaščević", "text": "Husein Gradaščević\n\nHusein Gradaščević (31 August 1802 – 17 August 1834) was an Ottoman Bosnian and later independent Bosniak military commander who later led a rebellion against the Ottoman government, seeking autonomy for Bosnia. Born into a Bosnian Muslim noble family, Gradaščević became the captain of Gradačac in the early 1820s, succeeding his relatives (among whom were his father) at the position. He grew up surrounded by a political climate of turmoil in the western reaches of the Ottoman Empire. With the Russo-Turkish war (1828–29), Gradaščević's importance rose; the Bosnian governor gave him the task of mobilizing an army between the Drina and Vrbas. By 1830, Gradaščević became the spokesperson of all Ottoman captains in Bosnia, and coordinated the defense in light of a possible Serbian invasion. Sparked by Ottoman Sultan Mahmud II's reforms that abolished the Janissaries and weakened the privileges of the nobility, and the autonomy and territory granted to the Principality of Serbia, much of the Bosnian nobility united and revolted. Gradaščević was chosen as the leader, and claimed the title of Vizier. This uprising, with goals of autonomy, lasted three years and included termination of Ottoman loyals mainly in Herzegovina. Among notable accomplishments, Gradaščević led forces victorious against the Ottoman field marshal in Kosovo. The uprising failed, while all captaincies were abolished by 1835. Temporarily exiled in Austria, he negotiated his return with the Sultan and was allowed to enter all of the Ottoman Empire except Bosnia. He died under controversial circumstances in 1834 and was buried in the Eyüp Cemetery in Istanbul. \n\nGradaščević received the honorific \"the Dragon of Bosnia\" (), and is considered a Bosniak national hero.\n\nThe first known captain of the Gradaščević captaincy in Gradačac is Mehmed-\"kapetan\", whose rule lasted until 1169 A.H. (1755–1756). The name of his successor is unknown, although this next captain was eventually succeeded by Mehmed-\"kapetan\" in 1765. (It was a common tradition among Bosniaks for children to be named after their paternal grandfathers). Mehmed-\"kapetan\" was in turn succeeded by Osman Gradaščević, who was known to be one of the most powerful Bosnian captains of the period. Osman-\"kapetan\" had six male heirs. In order of birth, they were Hamza, Murat, Osman, Muharem, Husein, and H. Bećir. As Hamza died in 1212 A.H. (1797–1798) it was Murat-\"beg\" Gradaščević who succeeded him to the captaincy.\n\nHusein was born in the town of Gradačac (in northern Bosnia), to Osman and his wife Melek-\"hanuma\" in 1802, at the Gradaščević family house. Outside of family tradition and folklore invented much later, little is known of his childhood. It is said that he spent much time around the family fort while it was undergoing renovations. He grew up during turbulent times and taking into account his father's military experience and brother Osman's services during the 1813 war against Serbia, young Husein surely heard many first hand accounts that shaped his personality.\n\nOsman senior died in 1812 when Husein was merely ten years old. Certain scholars have argued that his mother was also dead by then, although some family traditions claim otherwise. By all accounts, his mother had a strong influence on Husein's upbringing. Upon his father's death, Husein deferred to his eldest brother Murat because of his age and status as successor to the Gradačac captaincy, in fact Husein Gradaščević rose to the head of the Gradačac military captaincy only after his brother Murat was poisoned in the 1821 by rival aristocrats attempting to gain the favor of the desperate Grand Vizier.\n\nAs his status implied, Husein was well educated, learning to read and write at an early age. At sixteen he was taught Arabic calligraphy by Murat's personal scribe \"Mullah\" Mustevica, who praised his brightness and called him a \"gifted child\". In addition to this, Husein was taught by two Bektashi \"dervishes\". It is not known for certain whether Husein belonged to a dervish order but, based on his great piety and the modest lifestyle that he would demonstrate in the future, it is often assumed that he did.\n\nHusein married Hanifa, sister of Mahmud-\"kapetan\" of Derventa, at an early age. Although the exact date is unknown, his son Muhamed-\"beg\" Gradaščević was probably born no later than 1822 when Husein himself was twenty years old. The pair would also have a daughter, Šefika, born in 1833. Neither Muhamed nor Šefika were known to have had children themselves.\n\nWhen Husein took over the Gradačac captaincy, he focused most of his attention on administration of internal affairs. It is notable that all of Husein's construction projects were related to the city of Gradačac and its immediate area. During his rule, Gradačac further expanded its status as one of the most prosperous captaincies in Bosnia.\n\nThe first and most notable construction was that of the Gradačac Castle. The fort had existed for decades and was subject to extensive renovations since the time of Mehmed-kapetan in 1765. Husein's father Osman and brother Murat had done some work as well, in 1808 and 1818–19 respectively. However, the exact nature of Husein's contribution is unknown. The castle's tower has long been associated with Husein but architectural evidence points to the tower existing alongside the rest of the complex from earlier times. It seems likely that Husein was merely responsible for a significant renovation of the tower that lingered in the people's memory.\n\nHusein did have a new castle built, in a large project which included the construction of an artificial island surrounded by a moat up to 100 meters wide and of a great depth. The castle was named \"Čardak\" and the surrounding village quickly derived its name from it. The walls were of an oval shape, the entire structure being seventeen meters long and eight meters wide. The complex and area also included a mosque, wells, a fishery, and hunting grounds.\n\nWithin the Gradačac city walls Husein's most significant contribution to the city was the clock tower () which was built in 1824. The object's base is 5.5 by 5.5 meters, while the height is 21.50 meters. It was the last object of this type to be built in Bosnia.\n\nSome 40 to 50 meters outside the city walls lies Husein's greatest architectural contribution to Gradačac: the Husejnija mosque. Built in 1826, it features an octagonal dome roof and a particularly high minaret of 25 m. Three smaller octagonal domes are found above the verandah. Islamic decorations and artistry are seen on the door and surrounding wall as well as the interior. The entire complex is surrounded by a small stone wall and gate.\n\nHusein's rule in Gradačac was also notable because of his tolerance towards the Christian populace under his jurisdiction; both Catholic and Orthodox. Though social norms of the time dictated that the Ottoman sultan's official approval was necessary for the construction of any non-Islamic religious buildings, Husein approved the construction of several such buildings without it. A Catholic school was built in the village of Tolisa in 1823, followed by a large church that could hold 1,500 people. Another two Catholic churches were built in the villages of Dubrave and Garevac, while an Orthodox church was built in the hamlet of Obudovac. During Husein's captaincy, the Christians in Gradačac were known to be the most satisfied in Bosnia.\n\nHusein entered the higher political scene in Bosnia in 1827, largely due to the impending Russo-Turkish War (1828–1829) and his role in preparing the defense of the boundaries of Bosnia. Upon receiving orders from the Bosnian vizier Abdurahim Pasha, Husein mobilized the Gradačac populace and strengthened his defenses. During talks held in Sarajevo between the vizier and the Bosnian captains, it is said that Husein stayed the longest to discuss strategy. He was appointed commander of an army that he was to mobilize from the lands between the Drina to the Vrbas. By all accounts, he did a satisfactory job. However, in mid-June 1828, Husein had to rush to Sarajevo with a small accompanying force to get the vizier to safety following a revolt among the troops.\n\nBy 1830, Husein had risen to new political heights as he was able to speak on behalf of all (or at least most of) the captains of Bosnia. At that time, he was coordinating the defense of Bosnia against a possible invasion by Serbia, as well as taking it upon himself to address Austrian authorities and warn them against any incursion across the Sava. The authority he wielded in the later years of his captaincy in Gradačac explains the great role he was to have in the years to follow.\n\nIn the late 1820s, Sultan Mahmud II reintroduced a set of reforms that called for further expansion of the centrally controlled army (\"nizam\"), new taxes and more Ottoman bureaucracy. These reforms weakened the special status and privileges of the Bosnian Muslim nobility. Many Bosnian leaders had also been disappointed by Ottoman negligence to the plight of the Muslim refugees arriving from the Principality of Serbia. Contrary to popular belief, however, Husein Gradaščević was not greatly opposed to these reforms.\n\nIn 1826, during the Auspicious Incident, Sultan Mahmud II abolished the Janissaries, through use of military force, executions and exile. Mahmud II then banned the revered Bektashi Order and decreed his Turkish commanders to launch campaigns against prominent Balkan Muslim leaders causing great instability in Rumelia. Gradaščević's immediate reaction to the abolition of the Janissaries was not unlike that of the rest of the Bosnian aristocracy; Gradaščević threatened with military force to subdue anybody opposed to the Sarajevo Janissaries. When the Janissaries killed \"naqib al-ashraf\" Imam Nurudin-effendi Šerifović, however, his tone shifted and he rapidly distanced himself from their cause. Gradaščević did realize that economic hardship was the main reason of Janissary dissent. After this, Gradaščević generally maintained good relations with imperial authorities in Bosnia. When Abdurahim Pasha became vizier in 1827, Gradaščević was said to have become one of his more trusted advisors. This culminated in Gradaščević's large role in the Bosnian mobilization for the Russo-Ottoman war. Following a riot in the Sarajevo camp during these preparations, Gradaščević even provided shelter for the ousted Abdurahim Pasha in Gradačac before assisting him in his escape from the country. Gradaščević was also relatively loyal to Abdurahim's successor, Namık Pasha, reinforcing Ottoman garrisons in Šabac upon his orders.\n\nThe turning point for Gradaščević came with the end of the Russo-Ottoman War and the Treaty of Adrianople on 14 September 1829. According to the provisions of the treaty, the Ottoman Empire had to grant autonomy to Serbia, and also cede it six districts. This outraged the Bosnian nobility, launching numerous protests.\n\nBetween 20 and 31 December 1830, Gradaščević hosted a gathering of Bosniak aristocrats in Gradačac. A month later, from 20 January to 5 February, another meeting was held in Tuzla to prepare for a revolt. From there, a call was issued to the Bosnian Muslim populace asking them to rise up to the defense of Bosnia. It was then that the popular Gradaščević was unofficially chosen to head the rebellion. Further details of this meeting are murky and disputable. According to certain contemporary sources, their demands from Constantinople were:\n\n\nAnother outcome of the Tuzla meeting was an agreement that another general meeting should be held in Travnik. Since Travnik was the seat of the Bosnia Eyalet and of the vizier, the planned meeting was in effect a direct confrontation with Ottoman authority. Gradaščević thus asked all involved to help assemble an army beforehand. On 29 March 1831, Gradaščević set out towards Travnik with some 4,000 men.\n\nUpon hearing word of the oncoming force, Namık Pasha is said to have gone to the Travnik fort and called the Sulejmanpašić brothers to his aid. When the rebel army arrived in Travnik they fired several warning shots at the castle, warning the vizier that they were prepared for a military encounter. Meanwhile, Gradaščević sent a detachment of his forces, under the command of Memiš-aga of Srebrenica, to meet Sulejmanpašić's reinforcements. The two sides met at Pirot, on the outskirts of Travnik, on 7 April. There, Memiš-aga defeated the Sulejmanpašić brothers and their 2,000-man army, forcing them to retreat and destroying the possessions of the Sulejmanpašić family. On 21 May, Namık Pasha fled to Stolac following a short siege. Soon afterwards, Husein Gradaščević was honorably proclaimed the \"commander of Bosnia, chosen by the will of the people\". On 31 May he demanded that all Bosnian aristocrats immediately join his army, and called on the general populace who wished to do so. Thousands rushed to join him, among them being numerous Christians, who were said to comprise up to a third of his total forces. Gradaščević split his army in two, leaving one part of it in Zvornik to defend against a possible Serbian incursion. With the bulk of the troops he set out towards Kosovo to meet the Grand vizier, who had been sent with a large army to quell the rebellion. Along the way, he took the city of Peć with a 25,000-strong army and proceeded to Priština, where he set up his main camp.\n\nThe encounter with Grand Vizier Reşid Mehmed Pasha happened on 18 July near Štimlje. Although both armies were of roughly equal size, the Grand Vizier's troops had superior arms. Gradaščević sent a part of his army under the command of Ali Pasha Fidahić, the captain (\"kapetan\") and sanjak-bey of Zvornik, ahead to meet Reşid Pasha's forces. Following a small skirmish, Fihadić feigned a retreat. Thinking that victory was within reach, the Grand Vizier sent his cavalry and artillery into forested terrain. Gradaščević immediately took advantage of this tactical error and executed a punishing counterattack with the bulk of his forces, almost completely annihilating the Ottoman forces. Reşid Pasha himself was injured and barely escaped with his life.\n\nFollowing claims from the Grand Vizier that the Sultan would meet all Bosnian demands if the rebel army would return home, Gradaščević and his army turned back. On 10 August the leadership of the rebellion met at Priština and decided that Gradaščević be declared Vizier of Bosnia. Gradaščević refused at first, but eventually accepted. This was made official at an assembly held in Sarajevo on 12 September, where in front of the Tsar's Mosque, those present swore on the Quran to be loyal to Gradaščević and declared that, despite potential failure and death, there would be no turning back.\n\nAt this point, Gradaščević was not only the supreme military commander, but Bosnia's leading civilian authority as well. He established a court around him, and after initially making himself at home in Sarajevo, he moved the center of Bosnian politics to Travnik, making it the \"de facto\" capital of the rebel state. In Travnik, he established a \"divan\", a Bosnian congress, which together with him made up the Bosnian government. Gradaščević also collected taxes at this time, and executed various local opponents of the autonomy movement. He gained a reputation as a hero and a strong, brave, and decisive ruler. One anecdote that illustrates this is Husein-kapetan's alleged response to whether he was scared of waging war against the Ottoman Empire. \"God I fear slightly,\" Gradaščević replied, \"the Sultan not at all, and the Grand Vizier no more than my own horse.\"\n\nDuring this lull in armed conflict with the Ottomans, attention was turned to the autonomy movement's strong opposition in Herzegovina. A small campaign was launched against the region from three different directions:\n\n\nAs it happened, Namık Pasha had already abandoned Stolac, so this attack was put on hold. The attack on Gacko was a failure as the forces from Posavina and south Podrinje were defeated by Čengić's troops. There was one success, however; in October, Husein Gradaščević had deployed an army under the command of Ahmed-beg Resulbegović, who had put his life in danger while attempting to capture Trebinje from Resulbegović's loyalist and heavily armed cousins.\n\nA Bosnian delegation reached the Grand Vizier's camp in Skopje in November, and was promised that the Grand Vizier would insist to the Sultan to accept Bosnian demands and appoint Gradaščević as the official Vizier of an autonomous Bosnia. His true intentions, however, were manifested by early December when he attacked Bosnian rebel units stationed on the outskirts of Novi Pazar. Yet again, the rebel army handed a defeat to the imperial forces. Due to a particularly strong winter though, the Bosnian troops were forced to return home.\n\nMeanwhile, in Bosnia, Gradaščević decided to carry on his campaign against the captains in Herzegovina that were loyal to the Sultan, despite the unfavorable climate. The captain of Livno, Ibrahim-beg Fidrus, was ordered to launch a final attack against the local captains and to thus end all domestic opposition to the autonomy movement. To achieve this, Fidrus first attacked Ljubuški and the local captain Sulejman-beg, which he defeated and then secured the whole of Herzegovina except Stolac in the process. Unfortunately, the rebel detachments that laid siege to the Stolac Fortress met cannon fire and ambushes organized by Ali-paša Rizvanbegović in early March of the next year. Receiving information that the Bosnian ranks were depleted due to the winter, Rizvanbegović broke the siege, counterattacking the rebels and dispersing their forces; in doing so he proved that his fortress at Stolac was nearly impregnable. Husein Gradaščević, knowing of the eventual outcome, sent another well-equipped force towards Stolac from Sarajevo, under the command of Mujaga Zlatar, but it was ordered back on 16 March after receiving news of a major offensive on Bosnia being planned by the Grand Vizier.\n\nThe Ottoman campaign began in early February. The Grand Vizier sent two armies: one from Vučitrn and one from Shkodër. Both armies headed toward Sarajevo, and Gradaščević sent an army of around 10,000 men to meet them. When the Vizier's troops succeeded in crossing the Drina, Gradaščević ordered 6,000 men under Ali-paša Fidahić to meet them in Rogatica while units stationed in Višegrad were to head to Pale on the outskirts of Sarajevo. The encounter between the two sides finally happened on the Glasinac plains to the east of Sarajevo, near Sokolac, at the end of May. The Bosnian army was led by Gradaščević himself, while the Ottoman troops were under the command of Kara Mahmud Hamdi-paša, the new imperially recognized vizier of Bosnia. In this first encounter, Gradaščević was forced to retreat to Pale. The fighting continued in Pale and Gradaščević was once again forced to retreat; this time to Sarajevo. There, a council of captains decided that the fight would continue.\n\nBy 1832, after a series of smaller clashes, a decisive battle occurred outside Sarajevo; although Husein Gradaščević was initially successful, he was defeated when Serbian rebels arrived and sided with and reinforced the forces of Mahmud II.\n\nThe final battle was played out on 4 June at Stup, a small locality on the road between Sarajevo and Ilidža. After a long, intense battle, it seemed Gradaščević had once again defeated the Sultan's army. Near the very end, however, Herzegovinian troops under the command of Ali-paša Rizvanbegović and Smail-aga Čengić broke through defenses Gradaščević had set up on his flank and joined the fighting. Overwhelmed by the unexpected attack from behind, the rebel army was forced to retreat into the city of Sarajevo itself. It was decided that further military resistance would be futile. Gradaščević fled to Gradačac as the imperial army entered the city on 5 June and prepared to march on Travnik. Upon realizing the difficulties that his home and family would experience if he stayed there, Gradaščević decided to leave Gradačac and continue on to Austrian lands instead.\n\nIf the choice to flee Bosnia was not already clear, the Sultan's furious \"fatwa\" declaring Gradaščević \"no good\", an \"evil-doer\", a \"traitor\", a \"criminal\" and a \"rebel\" may have convinced Gradaščević to leave. Due to various customs and procedures, however, Gradaščević's departure from Bosnia was held up for several days. After pleading with Austrian officials to ease their restrictions, Gradaščević finally reached the Sava River boundary with a large party of followers on 16 June. He crossed the river into Habsburg lands the same day, along with some 100 followers, servants, and family. Though he expected to be treated as a Bosnian vizier, he instead found himself held in quarantine in Slavonski Brod for nearly a month, with his weapons and many of his possessions taken away.\n\nGradaščević and other rebels managed to flee across the Sava to Vinkovci and then Osijek, in Austrian territory. Some 66 men, 12 women, 135 servants and 252 horses accompanied him.\n\nAustrian officials faced constant pressure from the Ottoman government to move Gradaščević as far away from the border as possible. On 4 July he was moved to Osijek where he essentially lived in internment. His communications with the rest of his family and social circle were severely limited and he complained about his treatment to the authorities several times. His conditions would eventually improve, and before he left Osijek he remarked to local officials that he had enjoyed his stay there. Although intensely homesick and only partially in control of his own destiny, Gradaščević retained his pride and dignity. He was said to have lived a luxurious life that included jousting competitions with his companions.\n\nIn late 1832, he agreed to return to Ottoman territory to receive a \"ferman\" of pardon from the Sultan. The terms, read to him in Zemun, were very harsh, insisting that Gradaščević not only never to return to Bosnia, but also never to set foot on the European lands of the Ottoman Empire either. Disappointed, Gradaščević was forced to obey the terms and rode on to Belgrade. He entered the city on 14 October in the manner of a true vizier, riding a horse decked out in silver and gold and accompanied by a large procession. He was greeted as a hero by the Muslims in Belgrade and treated like an equal by the local \"pasha\". Gradaščević stayed in the city for two months, during which his health deteriorated (as was documented by local doctor Bartolomeo Kunibert). He left the city for Constantinople in December, but as his daughter was still very young, his wife remained in Belgrade, joining him in the spring of the following year.\n\nIn Constantinople Gradaščević lived in an old \"janissary\" barracks at \"atmejdan\" (Hippodrome square) while his family lived in a separate house nearby. He lived a relatively quiet life for the next two years, the only notable event being an offer from the Sultan for Gradaščević to become a high-ranking \"pasha\" in the Nizami army; an offer that Gradaščević indignantly refused.\n\nHe died in Constantinople in 1834 at the age of thirty-two. Legend has it that he was poisoned by imperial authorities but, considering his long failing health, a more probable cause might have been cholera.\n\nHusein Gradaščević was a living legend in his own time. Upon his death, he also became something of a martyr for Bosnian pride. There was a well-known saying among Bosniaks that \"for years after his death not a single man among our people would be able to hear his name and not shed a tear.\" This positive sentiment was not exclusive to the Muslim population, as Christians from Posavina are thought to have shared a similar view for decades.\n\nAlthough a majority of the Bosniaks in Herzegovina supported the cause of Husein Gradaščević, some of its ruling kapetans such as Ali-paša Rizvanbegović supported Sultan Mahmud II for their own personal gains, in the years that followed the \"Herzegovina kapetans\" suffered during the Herzegovina Uprising (1875–1878) mainly due to the lack of a centralized authority in Bosnia Eyalet.\n\nThe first historic literature written about Gradaščević can be found in Safvet-beg Bašagić's work from 1900, \"A short introduction into the past of Bosnia and Herzegovina\". However, due to historical differences between the Bašagić and Gradaščević families, Safvet-beg's view of Husein-kapetan is somewhat opinionated. A year later, Gradaščević was mentioned by Kunibert in his works on the first Serbian Uprising, which painted a positive picture of Gradaščević as a tragic hero.\n\nIn the years that followed, Gradaščević was mentioned, either specifically or in the context of the movement he led, by D. Pavlović, Slavko Kaluđerčić, and Hamdija Kreševljaković. The general sentiment was that the autonomy movement was merely a reaction to imperial reforms by the Bosnian upper class. This view would be predominant among historians for decades. Gradaščević had a minor resurgence during World War II when Ustaše launched a propaganda-rooted proposal to bring his remains back to Sarajevo.\n\nDuring the time of Communist Yugoslavia, Gradaščević and his movement were rarely mentioned. The perceived upper-class resistance to implementation of modern reforms did not go well with communist ideology. Gradaščević was briefly mentioned in such a light by Avdo Sućeska in his 1964 work on Bosnian captains. It would be another 24 years before Gradaščević was mentioned again. This time it was in Galib Šljiva's 1988 work on Bosnia in the first half of the 19th century. Though several historiographical controversies were resolved, there was no significant shift in the perception of Gradaščević.\n\nSince the Yugoslav Wars and the Bosniak national awakening, Gradaščević and his movement have experienced a rebirth among historians and the common public alike. Works by Ahmed S. Aličić, Mustafa Imamović, and Husnija Kamberović have all cast Gradaščević in a more positive light. Gradaščević is once again widely considered the greatest Bosniak national hero, and is a symbol of national pride and spirit. The main streets in Gradačac and Sarajevo are both named after him, as well as numerous other places in Bosnia and Herzegovina. An impressive statue and monument to Gradaščević are to be built in Gradačac sometime in the near future. Talk of returning Gradaščević's remains to Bosnia has been proposed, but little has come of it.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2057590", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2057590", "title": "Christina's World", "text": "Christina's World\n\nChristina's World is a 1948 painting by American painter Andrew Wyeth and one of the best-known American paintings of the middle 20th century. It is a tempera work done in a realist style, depicting a woman semi-reclining on the ground in a treeless, mostly tawny field, looking up at a gray house on the horizon; a barn and various other small outbuildings are adjacent to the house. It is owned by the Museum of Modern Art in New York as part of its permanent collection.\n\nThe woman in the painting is Anna Christina Olson (3 May 1893 – 27 January 1968). She probably suffered from Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease, a genetic polyneuropathy. Wyeth was inspired to create the painting when he saw her crawling across a field while he was watching from a window in the house. He had a summer home in the area and was on friendly terms with Olson, using her and her younger brother as the subjects of paintings from 1940 to 1968. Olson was the inspiration and subject of the painting but she was not the primary model; Wyeth's wife Betsy posed as the torso of the painting. Olson was 55 at the time that Wyeth created the work.\n\nThe house depicted in the painting is known as the Olson House in Cushing, Maine and is open to the public, operated by the Farnsworth Art Museum. It is a National Historic Landmark and has been restored to match its appearance in the painting, although Wyeth separated the house from its barn and changed the lay of the land for the painting.\n\n\"Christina's World\" was first exhibited at the Macbeth Gallery in Manhattan in 1948. It received little attention from critics at the time, but Alfred Barr, the founding director of the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA), bought the painting for $1,800. He promoted it at MoMA and it gradually grew in popularity over the years. Today, it is considered an icon of American art and is rarely loaned out by the museum.\n\nIt is often perceived as the embodiment of a strong sense of longing.\n\nIn Arthur C. Clarke's novel \"\", \"Christina's World\" is one of the two paintings (the other one being Vincent van Gogh's \"Bridge at Arles\") hanging on the living room wall of \"an elegant, anonymous hotel suite” to which the astronaut David Bowman is transported after passing through the Star Gate. It does not appear in the directed by Stanley Kubrick.\n\nIn issue #28 of Garth Ennis's comics series \"Preacher\", Jesse Custer is sitting in front of the painting in the MoMA, examining it. In issue #43 (November 1998), whose story is titled \"Christina's World\", Jesse relates his visit to the museum to his mother, Christina L'Angell, who explains to him that when she first discovered the painting in a book, she thought Wyeth had painted her own life. In addition, the cover to issue #43 by artist Glenn Fabry is a variation of \"Christina's World\", with Christina L'Angell in the role of Anna Christina Olson.\n\nThe painting is also part of the sci-fi movie Oblivion from 2013, paying hommage to the book A Space Odyssey. \n\nThe painting is shown and discussed in the American thriller film \"The In Crowd\". \n\nThe life of Olson and her encounter with Wyeth is portrayed in the novel \"A Piece of the World\" by Christina Baker Kline.\n\nThe painting appears in the 2016 British film \"War on Everyone\" during a scene where Terry looks at a reproduction hanging on a wall in Jackie's house, and comments: \"It's kinda creepy. It's like something bad's gonna happen but there's nothing she can do about it.\"\n\nA print of the painting was seen periodically in episodes in the last three seasons of the American television series \"That Girl\", a sitcom that aired on ABC from September 8, 1966 to March 19, 1971. It first appeared hung on the wall parallel to the bed in the apartment bedroom of title character Ann Marie (played by actress Marlo Thomas), in overall episode number 84 (season 3, episode 24), \"It’s So Nice to Have a Mouse Around the House\", that aired on March 13, 1969. In overall episode number 111 (season 4, episode 25), “Easy Faller,” that aired on March 19, 1970, it had been moved to the wall above the headboard of the bed. It stayed there for the remainder of the series.\n\nA scene in the 1994 film \"Forrest Gump\" was inspired by the painting. When Jenny returns home she throws herself on the ground, mirroring \"Christina's\" pose in reverse.\n\n"}

His family moved to Chicago, Illinois, where he became an outstanding basketball and baseball player at DuSable High School, graduating in 1942. He attended Xavier University of Louisiana and then served with the United States Army for three years, fighting in Europe during World War II.\n\nAfter the war, Clifton joined the New York Rens, an all-black professional basketball team that toured throughout the United States. Noted for his large hands, which required a size 14 glove, he was invited to join the Harlem Globetrotters, for whom he played from the summer of 1948 to the spring of 1950. Still a talented baseball first baseman, during the basketball off-season in 1949 Clifton played for the Chicago American Giants in Negro League baseball. By 1950, his performance with the Globetrotters, in particular his exceptional ball-handling ability, led to his signing a contract with an NBA team.\n\nOn April 25, 1950 the 1950 NBA draft was held; Clifton became the second African-American player to be drafted by the NBA after Chuck Cooper. He was the first to sign an NBA contract. Harold Hunter (April 26) was cut in training camp. He played his first game for the New York Knicks on November 4, four days after the debut of Washington Capitols player Earl Lloyd, the first black player to appear in an NBA game. Already 27 years old when he made his debut, Clifton in his first season helped lead the team to its first-ever appearance in the NBA finals, losing in game seven. During his eight seasons in the NBA, Clifton averaged 10 points and 9 rebounds per game. He was named to the 1957 NBA All-Star team, scoring 8 points in 23 minutes in the game. At age 34, he became the oldest player in NBA history to be named an All-Star.\n\nIn 1957, Clifton was part of a multi-player trade between the Knicks and the Fort Wayne Pistons, but after one season in Detroit he retired from basketball. In the summer of 1958, he joined the Detroit Clowns baseball team in the Negro Leagues, along with his former Harlem Globetrotters teammate Reece \"Goose\" Tatum.\n\nIn 1961, he was coaxed out of retirement by the Chicago Majors of the fledgling American Basketball League (ABL). After the league folded at the end of 1962, the 40-year-old Clifton retired permanently.\n\nClifton's contributions to his community during his sporting career and after his playing days have been recognized by the Associated Black Charities of New York City. They have honored him by naming one of the Black History Maker Awards the Nathaniel 'Sweetwater' Clifton Award. In 2005, the New York Knicks basketball team renamed their monthly \"City Spirit Award\" in his honor. The Sweetwater Clifton City Spirit Award is given to a member of the community who goes above and beyond his or her normal duties to make the lives of others in the tri-state area better.\n\nClifton, who played softball for the Brown Bombers and Capitol Records team of the \"Daddy O\" Daylie League, was also inducted into Chicago 16 Inch Softball Hall of Fame.\n\nOn his death in 1990, Sweetwater Clifton was interred in the Restvale Cemetery in the Chicago suburb of Alsip.\n\nOn February 14, 2014, Clifton was announced as a 2014 inductee by the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. He formally entered the Hall as a contributor on August 8.\n\n"}

The species was first described by Michael Denis and Ignaz Schiffermüller in 1775. It is found in the west Palearctic in a wide band through northern, central and eastern Europe and Russia (up to the Ural Mountains). In the south it is spread through northern Spain and northern Portugal, northern Italy, Macedonia, Bulgaria, and northern Greece. In Europe it is found wherever its food plants grow. It is traditionally thought of as a species typical of heathland and moorland but it can often be found in places where heather and its relatives are in garden cultivation. In the mountains it is found up to an elevation of over 2000 metres above sea level.\n\nThis is a small but attractive species, with a wingspan of 26–34 mm (individuals hatched in higher altitudes tend to be smaller than those from the lowlands). The forewings are brown, often tinged with purple and marked with a complex pattern of white markings which are supposed to recall a true lover's knot. The hindwings are grey or buff. It flies from the latter half of June to the beginning of August and is attracted to light and the flowers of its food plants.\n\nThe species has a wingspan of 26–34 mm. Its forewings are brick red; the veins white; lines dark, irregularly edged with white; stigmata edged with white and black scales; the claviform elongate, slender; the orbicular small and round; hindwing ochreous fuscous.

Alama began his career in the 1980s when he appeared as a contestant on the talent show broadcast Studio El Fan, on which he received the Platinum Award.\n\nAlama's fame came after Studio El Fan followed by yearly albums and number-one hit singles such as \"Ya rait\" , \"'Aan Jad\" (\"Seriously\") and \"Alby Asheq'ha\" (\"My Heart Adores Her\") which was the first Arabic song in history to be made into a music video. Alama continued his success into the 2000s with the release of his chart-topping albums \"Saharony El Leil\" (2001), \"Tab Leh\" (2002), \"El Hob El Kebeer\" (2004) and \"Ba'asha'ak\" (2008), the latter which earned the artist the Platinum certification from Virgin Megastores for its record sales. One of his recent albums \"Seneen Rayha\" (2010) saw the artist team with Starbucks for its release and sale, making him the first Arab artist to have his album sold at Starbucks. The Starbucks album \"Starz Vol. 1\" also included a song featuring international pop artist Shakira.

{"id": "2057640", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2057640", "title": "Functus officio", "text": "Functus officio\n\nFunctus officio refers to an officer or agency whose mandate has expired, due to either the arrival of an expiry date or an agency having accomplished the purpose for which it was created. When used to describe a court, it can refer to one whose duty or authority has come to an end: \"Once a court has passed a valid sentence after a lawful hearing, it becomes \"functus officio\" and cannot reopen the case.\"\n\nFunctus officio is thus bound up with the doctrine of res judicata, which prevents the re-opening of a matter before the same court, tribunal or other statutory actor which rendered the final decision in the absence of statutory authority. There are many exceptions; for instance, where a statute authorizes variations of the original decision, the decision maker may revisit his or her previous decision. Common examples include legal competency hearings, parole board hearings and family law proceedings. There is an important difference between \"res judicata\" and \"functus officio\": the former refers to the end of a case, while the latter refers to the expiration of an office. \"Functus officio\" derives from \"fungere\": to perform, end or expire. It is cognate to the ordinary English word \"defunct\". \"Res judicata\" means \"the thing has been decided\" and derives from the principle \"interest reipublicae ut sit finis litium\" (it is for the good of the commonwealth that there be a terminus to litigation).\nCanadian doctrinal and judicial writing on \"functus officio\" is sparse, even though the rule itself derives from a 19th century case of the English Court of Appeal (In re St. Nazaire Co. (1879), 12 Ch. D. 88). Essentially, the rule holds that the court has no jurisdiction to reopen or amend a final decision, except in two cases: (1) where there has been a slip in drawing up the judgment, or (2) where there has been error in expressing the manifest intention of the court. More recently, this Court affirmed that the rule need not always be rigidly applied to tribunals in the administrative law context when the policy reasons for it are not present. In the Canadian case of \"Chandler v Alberta Association of Architects\", Sopinka J. wrote in relation to the principle of \"functus officio\": \"The general rule (is) that a final decision of a court cannot be reopened ... the rule applied only after the formal judgment had been drawn up, issued and entered, and was subject to two exceptions: where there had been a slip in drawing it up, and where there was an error in expressing the manifest intention of the court.\"\n\nThe existence and scope of a right of appeal has often been made the focus of analytical attention in applying the \"functus\" doctrine. Such was the case when the power of the Court of Chancery to rehear cases was extinguished by the Judicature Acts in 1873 by fusing common law and equity jurisdictions into one court and providing for a single appeal to a newly created Court of Appeal (In re St. Nazaire, supra). Originally, this was also the focus of the \"functus\" analysis for administrative tribunals that had rights of appeal tightly constrained by statute (see Grillas v. Minister of Manpower and Immigration, 1971 CanLII 3 (S.C.C.), [1972] S.C.R. 577). However, the underlying rationale for the doctrine is clearly more fundamental: that for the due and proper administration of justice, there must be finality to a proceeding to ensure procedural fairness and the integrity of the judicial system.\n\nAs a general rule, once . . . a tribunal has reached a final decision in respect to the matter that is before it in accordance with its enabling statute, that decision cannot be revisited because the tribunal has changed its mind, made an error within jurisdiction or because there has been a change of circumstances. . . .\nTo this extent, the principle of functus officio applies. It is based, however, on the policy ground which favours finality of proceedings rather than the rule which was developed with respect to formal judgments of a court whose decision was subject to a full appeal.\n\nIf a court is permitted to continually revisit or reconsider final orders simply because it has changed its mind or wishes to continue exercising jurisdiction over a matter, there would never be finality to a proceeding, or, as G. Pépin and Y. Ouellette have perceptively termed it, the providing of [translation] “legal security” for the parties. This concern for finality is evident in the definition of functus officio:\n\n[translation] Qualifies a court or tribunal, a public body or an official that is no longer seized of a matter because it or he or she has discharged the office. E.g. A judge who has pronounced a final judgment is functus officio.\nThe principle ensures that subject to an appeal, parties are secure in their reliance on the finality of superior court decisions.\n\nThis common law rule is further reflected in modern rules of civil procedure (see, e.g., Nova Scotia Civil Procedure Rules, Rule 15.07) and the interpretation of criminal appeal provisions (see R. v. H. (E.F.) 1997 CanLII 418 (ON C.A.), (1997), 115 C.C.C. (3d) 89 (Ont. C.A.), considering s. 675 of the Criminal Code). Whether in its common law or statutory form, the doctrine of functus officio provides that only in strictly limited circumstances can a court revisit an order or judgment (see Nova Scotia Civil Procedure Rules, Rule 15.08). If it were otherwise, there would be, to paraphrase Charron J. A. in H. (E.F.), supra, at p. 101, the recurring danger of the trial process becoming or appearing to become a “never closing revolving door” through which litigants could come and go as they pleased.\n\nIn addition to this concern with finality, the question of whether a court is clothed with the requisite authority to act raises concerns related to the separation of powers, a principle that transcends procedural and common law rules. In our view, if a court intervenes, as here, in matters of administration properly entrusted to the executive, it exceeds its proper sphere and thereby breaches the separation of powers. By crossing the boundary between judicial acts and administrative oversight, it acts illegitimately and without jurisdiction. Such a crossing of the boundary cannot be characterized as relief that is “appropriate and just in the circumstances” within the meaning of s. 24(1) of the Charter.\n"}

She was introduced as the second Captain Marvel and she gained super powers after being bombarded by extradimensional energy, produced by an energy disruptor weapon. The character joined and eventually became leader of the Avengers for a time. She was also a member of Nextwave and the latest Ultimates team. She has also been known as Photon, Pulsar and beginning in 2013, Spectrum.\n\nAkira Akbar portrayed young Monica Rambeau in the Marvel Cinematic Universe film \"Captain Marvel\" (2019).

Still later, she received two one-shot titles, both written by Dwayne McDuffie and illustrated by Mark D. Bright. She also starred in \"Avengers: Unplugged\" #5. She returned in \"The Avengers\" vol. 3 with sporadic appearances between issues #1–59. During this run, she also appeared in \"Avengers: Infinity\" #1–4 (September–December 2000), \"Maximum Security\" #2–3 (both Jan. 2001), \"Thor\" vol. 2 #30 (Jan. 2001) and the \"Avengers Annual\" in 2001.\n\nIn 2009, Rambeau appeared in the limited series, \"Marvel Divas\" (partly inspired by \"Sex and the City\"). She was one of the main characters, alongside Black Cat, Hellcat, and Firestar.\n\nAfter a cameo in \"Great Lakes Avengers\" #1 and \"New Thunderbolts\" #8–9, she appeared in \"Order\" #5–6. She starred in \"Nextwave\" #1–12. Following the cancellation of that series, Rambeau was seen briefly in \"Civil War\", \"She-Hulk\", and as a main character in \"Marvel Divas\" #1–4 and \"Heralds\" #1–5. She appears \"Iron Age\" #1 (2011), \"Captain Marvel\" #7–8, \"Journey into Mystery\" #649, and \"Age of Ultron\".\n\nStarting in September 2013, she appeared as one of the lead characters in the Marvel NOW! relaunch of \"Mighty Avengers\", she acted as the team's field leader under the new codename Spectrum.\n\nShe was part of the 2015's Ultimates team, written by Al Ewing and drawn by Kenneth Rocafort, the team consisted of Monica Rambeau, Black Panther, Blue Marvel, Miss America, and Captain Marvel. In Marvel NOW! (2016), the Ultimates broke up but are later reunited and asked to become the heralds of Galactus, who is now the Lifebringer of Worlds. The second volume ended at a special #100 issue and it includes an appearance of the original Ultimates team.\n\nShe was a major character in the Avengers weekly story-arc \"Avengers: No Road Home\", alongside Hawkeye, Hercules, Hulk, Scarlet Witch, Vision, Voyager and Rocket Raccoon. It was meant to be a spiritual successor to previous Avengers weekly story-arc, \"Avengers: No Surrender\".\n\nMonica Rambeau was born in New Orleans, Louisiana to Frank and Maria Rambeau. She was a lieutenant in the New Orleans harbor patrol, and operated as a cargo ship captain. Trying to prevent the creation of a dangerous weapon, Rambeau was exposed to extra-dimensional energy. As a result, she was thereafter able to convert her body to energy. After this event, the media dubbed her \"Captain Marvel\". Following a close call where her excess energy nearly made her a danger to others before that power was drained off by Iron Man and Spider-Man, she decided to use her powers to fight crime under that name. She was told by Ben Grimm that the name had originally been used by the late Kree hero Mar-Vell, but Grimm assured her that \"Marv wouldn't mind. I probably ain't the only 'Thing' in the world either.\"\n\nRambeau sought out the Avengers for help in mastering her new powers and became a member-in-training, soon aiding them against Egghead. Befriended and mentored by Avengers veterans Captain America and the Wasp, Captain Marvel soon graduated to full membership after the battle against Plantman. She became their first African-American heroine.\n\nShe assisted Doctor Strange and the Scarlet Witch in battling Dracula.\n\nTwo of Rambeau's enemies are super-powered psychiatrist Moonstone (Karla Sofen), and Moonstone's powerful pawn Blackout (Marcus Daniels), who wields the Darkforce. Captain Marvel first encountered them when the Avengers opposed the duo's escape from incarceration in Project: PEGASUS. After that, Rambeau temporarily lost her ability to transform back to human form during a battle against Dr. Eric Paulson, in which she fought alongside Spider-Man and Starfox. She was with the team when the Beyonder abducted them and other Earth superheroes for the first Secret Wars saga.\n\nMoonstone and Blackout returned as members of Baron (Helmut) Zemo's Masters of Evil, participating in an occupation of Avengers Mansion and trapping Rambeau in the Darkforce dimension. With help from The Shroud, Rambeau was able to escape in time to help retake the Mansion. During the battle, Moonstone became temporarily paralyzed and Blackout died. Another of Rambeau's major early foes was the murderous interstellar pirate Nebula, who shanghaied Rambeau into space for an extended period before she reunited with the Avengers.\n\nCaptain Marvel also took part in battles against the Beyonder, a confused Jean Grey, Kang the Conqueror, Attuma, and Grandmaster.\n\nRambeau later replaced the Wasp as leader of the Avengers, commanding them in battles against the X-Men, the Olympian Gods, and the Super-Adaptoid. She spent a lot of time refereeing squabbles between Hercules and the Submariner, and dealing with the duplicitous telepath Dr. Druid, who sought to supplant her as Avengers chairman and undermined her authority at every opportunity.\n\nWhen honorary Avengers member and wife of the Submariner Marrina transformed into the gigantic sea monster Leviathan, Captain Marvel led the hunt for the creature. During the battle that followed, Rambeau transformed herself into a massive bolt of lightning to try and stop the beast. She made contact with the water and accidentally conducted herself across the surface of the ocean, dispersing her atoms so widely that she barely regained physical form. She reformed as a frail, withered husk of a woman devoid of super-powers.\n\nAfter retiring from the team, Rambeau regained first her physical health, and eventually her powers, initially developing the ability to manipulate mechanical energy for various effects. She resumed crimefighting, facing foes such as Brazilian crime lord Kristina Ramos, Moonstone, and Powderkeg. At the same time, she served as a cargo ship captain in her friend Ron Morgan's shipping company before starting her own charter business.\n\nRambeau stayed connected with the Avengers and served as a reservist, sometimes assuming leadership duties in the absence of the current chair. She helped repel an Atlantean invasion of the surface world and assists in the Acts of Vengeance, which involved a concentrated, multi-villain attack on Earth's superheroes, or in the Terminus Factor. Rambeau led a reserve substitute roster during the team's first United Nations-backed reorganization. She took on another leadership role during the and led an Avengers delegation to the Shi'ar Empire to petition for peace.\n\nWhen a group of aliens calling themselves Starblasters tried to push the moon away from Earth, Quasar assembled a team with some of the most powerful heroes of the world, recruiting Rambeau, Carol Danvers, Black Bolt, Hyperion, Ikaris, Darkstar, Vanguard and Perun. During this adventure, her original powers gradually regenerated, fully returning when the alien Stranger accelerates the process.\n\nWhen Genis became an adventurer, he was known as Captain Marvel like his father before him—which Rambeau resented. After she, Starfox and Genis teamed up to defeat the Controller, Genis tried to concede the Captain Marvel title to Rambeau since he felt she was more worthy of it. Rambeau declined out of respect for the Mar-Vell legacy and adopted a new alias: Photon.\n\nAfter the return of the main avengers from the pocket universe created by Franklin Richards almost all the current and former Avengers members were trapped in a curse created by Morgan Le Fay where they served her as soldiers in a guard called Queen's Vengeance. Due to her strong loyalty to the group Rambeau, under the name Daystar, was one of the first Avengers to recover their will and rebel against the sorceress.\n\nLater when Photon was attacked by the Wrecking Crew in the Mardi Gras of New Orleans, she asked the Avengers for help and wound up being involved in an adventure in Arkon's world with the group and her old fellow Avenger, Black Knight.\n\nFor a time, Rambeau's mother intercepted her Avengers calls out of fear for her daughter's safety. After discovering this deception, Rambeau led an unofficial force of Avengers against the 'Infinites', who planned on relocating the galaxy. Next Photon was involved in the events of Maximum Security, and fought with her former teammates against Bloodwraith, and Lord Templar and Pagan.\n\nAfter that, Rambeau helped the team in the deep-space monitoring station with Quasar and Living Lightning, called into action in Kang's War, (supporting also her friend Janet van Dyne and advising the new recruit Triathlon on his current issues as the newest member of the team), in the world crisis caused by Zodiac, and when the Scarlet Witch suffered a nervous breakdown and attacked the Avengers.\n\nWhen Genis-Vell wanted to establish a new identity for himself, he began calling himself Photon. Rambeau confronted him, but she decided to let Genis keep the Photon alias after she came up with a name she liked better: Pulsar.\n\nRambeau later led the Nextwave team, part of the Highest Anti-Terrorism Effort (H.A.T.E.), against Unusual Weapons of Mass Destruction created by the Beyond Corporation© where she avoided using a code name and wore a new uniform.\n\nDuring the Superhero Civil War, Rambeau was a member of Captain America's Secret Avengers, but also registered as a member of the Initiative.\n\nWhen Brother Voodoo asked for Rambeau's help in tracking down some evil sorcerers, she revealed a former relationship with Brother Voodoo to Black Cat, Hellcat, and Firestar. Despite her breaking it off, Voodoo still had feelings for Rambeau. She agreed to aid him, rekindling their relationship in the process.\n\nShe later attended Emma Frost's birthday party in Las Vegas where she helped solve a cosmic crisis involving Frankie Raye.\n\nThe group continued to meet partly over their support of Firestar, who had battled and defeated breast cancer. She assisted Carol Danvers, in an investigation in the Gulf of Mexico, where Rambeau indicated that she was still fearful of using her powers under the water since her traumatic experience in battle against Marrina Smallwood, and aided Iron Man in the Avengers' deep-space monitoring station against ancient Viking monsters who claimed to be the Emperor of Mars.\n\nDuring the \"Infinity\" storyline, Monica Rambeau took the name of Spectrum as she chased after the criminal Blue Streak. Even the police officers that arrested him were impressed by her latest alias and her new costume. Spectrum returned to a specialist shop in New York where a man named Luc sells designer superhero costumes. He mentioned that someone was waiting for her in the next room. Monica recognized the man, though apparently all he wanted to do was talk and ask for help. Spectrum heard the explosions when Proxima Midnight began her attack on the city. Her mysterious guest says he cannot be seen in America, and needed her help for a mysterious mission, but she was adamant...he is in a costume shop, and if he wanted her help, he'd put on a costume and come help her.\n\nMonica became field leader of Luke Cage's new Mighty Avengers team in the wake of the event.\n\nDuring the \"Last Days\" part of the \"Secret Wars\" storyline, Spectrum devised a plan to destroy Earth-1610 to keep it from colliding with Earth-616. In desperation during the two weeks before the end of the world, Spectrum channeled her full power and went to destroy Earth-1610. However, right before she could successfully destroy the other Earth, she spotted a group of children who lived there, causing her to hesitate for only a moment, long enough for Ultimate Reed Richards to capture her.\n\nDue to bombardment by extra-dimensional energies, Rambeau can transform herself into any form of energy within the electromagnetic spectrum. Among the many energy forms she has assumed and is able to control are cosmic rays, gamma rays, X-rays, ultraviolet radiation, visible light, electricity, infrared radiation, microwaves, radio waves, and neutrinos. By assuming an energy-form, she gains all of that energy's properties.\n\nShe is invisible and intangible in many of her energy forms (the most frequent exception being visible light), and is capable of flight in all her energy forms (reaching velocities up to and including light speed). She also has the ability to project these energies from her body while she is in human form (only one wavelength of energy at a time), usually in the form of energy blasts from her hands. She mentally controls both the type and quantity of energy she wishes to transmit. The maximum amount of energy she can transmit at a given time is unknown. Rambeau can also divert small amounts of various energies for employment as force beams, which have the equivalent to 300 tons of TNT of explosive force. A variation of this ability enables her to project light-based holographic illusions of herself. Rambeau has also shown the ability to split her energy form into several miniature energy forms that are under her mental command, each miniature Rambeau is able to react and fly at light-speed.\n\nWhen she encounters a new or unfamiliar energy, Rambeau can often duplicate it given enough time for analysis. Rambeau tends to be physically insubstantial in her energy forms, though with concentration and effort she can sometimes perform tasks such as briefly grasping an object, either by partially solidifying or by applying some sort of force to the object in question.\n\nShe is immortal and does not age beyond her prime.\n\nWhen Rambeau temporarily lost her original powers after a massive energy expenditure, she developed the ability to shunt any mechanical energy directed towards her through a dimensional interface surrounding her body, granting her increased strength, resistance to impact, and the ability to fly. After Rambeau asked Reed Richards to examine these new abilities, he theorized that she accessed the same dimension from which she derived her energy powers to create the interface.\n\nRambeau has strong leadership skills and law enforcement experience due to both of her time as a police officer and former leader of the Avengers. She is an excellent markswoman, unarmed combatant, detective, and swimmer with extensive nautical expertise. She has received Harbor Patrol training, and Avengers training in unarmed combat by Captain America.\n\nRambeau is able to retain her energy form for several hours with no ill effects. She can only transform herself into one wavelength of energy at a time, but she can transform between one energy-state and another in a fraction of a second. Extensive energy transformation and manipulation can be physically taxing once she re-assumes her physical form. Rambeau can also be forcibly reverted to her original form by other forces.\n\nDuring the \"Age of Ultron\" storyline, Rambeau appears amongst the superhero resistance against Ultron.\n\nLike other inhabitants of this reality, Monica Rambeau would periodically visit Earth-616 for vacations. Due to the nature of the interdimensional travel, she received duplicate powers to her counterpart and would masquerade as her. It is implied that the inexperienced Rambeau appearing around that time in \"Black Panther\" was, in fact, this alternate. Rambeau claimed that the main reason she visited Earth-616 was not because she would gain superpowers but because her parents were still alive in that reality.\n\nMonica Rambeau is featured in \"New Warriors\" #11–13, in an alternate reality that is listed as Earth-9105, where she goes under the code-name of Sceptre. She is part of a murderous version of the Avengers, who enforce the will of the tyrannical female Sphinx. She briefly makes an appearance in \"Avengers Forever\" when she and several other alternate, evil Avengers are brought forth in order to battle the main protagonists.\n\nPhoton is shown as a reservist member of the Avengers and aids them during the searching of the twelve items of power, fighting against the Green Lantern. After the battle for the last item in the Savage Land, Monica takes part in one annual JLA-Avengers meeting at the Justice League Satellite in the new merged world that the villain Krona created, being unaware of the changes. After that she appeared fighting along with other Captain Marvels of both universes (Mar-Vell, Shazam!) in the final battle.\n\nMonica Rambeau appears in \"Marvel Zombies vs. The Army of Darkness\" issue #3 in her Nextwave uniform, fighting alongside the rest of the team against a zombified Power Pack.\n\nAlthough Monica Rambeau has never appeared in Marvel Comics' future-era MC2 line, the comics feature her daughter by Derek Freeman, Blacklight, who first appears in \"A-Next\" #9.\n\nMonica Rambeau has a brief appearance in \"What if the Scarlet Witch Hadn't Acted Alone?\", \"What If? Avengers Disassembled\" (2006).\n\n\n\n"}

It marks the west side of the mouth of the Norwalk River on northern Long Island Sound.\n\nThe island, at the time known as \"White Island\", was purchased by Captain Robert Sheffield in 1804 for $6000. In 1826 Gershom Smith, Sheffield's son in law, sold 4 of the island's at the southwest point to the United States government for the purpose of building a lighthouse. Smith would serve as the first keeper for the light which was completed in 1828. At the time the island was known as Smith Island. The first light originally ran on oil.\n\nIn 1857 the light was upgraded to a fourth-order Fresnel lens. The original tower was replaced by a Victorian style limestone (masonry) dwelling, with a high light tower in the gable, in 1868. The Fresnel lens from 1857 was moved into the new structure and with a focal plane above water it was visible for more than . The lighthouse is of the same design as lighthouses at Great Captain Island and Morgan Point in Connecticut; Old Field Point Light and Plum Island in New York; and Block Island North in Rhode Island.\n\nGreens Ledge Light was built to the west of Sheffield in 1900 and was better located to warn ships of the rocks and shoals on the approach to Sheffield Island harbor and Norwalk harbor. Sheffield Island Light was then deactivated in 1902. Sheffield Island Lighthouse was put up for sale in 1914 and purchased by Thorsten O. Stabell. In 1986 the 118-year-old structure was purchased by the Norwalk Seaport Association for renovation and restoration. In 1989 the lighthouse was placed on the National Register of Historic Places. In 1993 an electric generator was added to the structure. In the fall of that year, a great storm flooded the basement of the building and artifacts were lost or destroyed. In 2002 the Seaport association started ferry service to the island, which is still running. In October 2011 the lighthouse was re-lit by a solar powered system installed to replace the gasoline generator system. The beacon is focused only on the Norwalk side and is not intended for use as navigation.\n\n\n\n"}

Moore and Steve Luedders-Dieckbrader for Progressive Peripherals and Software (PP&S) out of Colorado. It was later modified and re-released as Ultimate Wizard.\n\nEach level contains keys, and the object involves getting Wilfrid to get the key to move on to the next location. Each level also requires a different spell to find the key, and every key found gives him a finite number of times he could cast the spell. Some spells cast projectiles, which could either kill or freeze enemies, while some would teleport Wilfrid around, either by turning him to a non-corporeal \"shadow\" or by instantly moving him to his starting point.\n\nThe player character, Wilfrid, is a wizard in purple robes, and his enemies include witches, knights, giant insects, and other various monsters.\n\n\"Wizard\" was created contemporaneously with the Epyx release Jumpman. Steve Luedders stated that it was a coincidence, and that he felt \"Wizard\" could have been more successful if \"Jumpman\" had not been released first (company size and marketing resources being a significant factor).\n\nCraig Smith and Aaron Hightower teamed up to make an improved construction set in their homes in North Richland Hills, Texas. They communicated with Sean and Steve to understand the memory layout for the levels and then set out to create an advanced construction set better than the one included with the original game. Among other things, their construction set included the ability to create \"treasure matrices\" that allowed the user to create special effects similar to the ones seen in the main levels. The original set had remnants in its code alluding to features that had been disabled, likely due to their instability or lack of documentation.\n\nPP&S took the code from Craig and Aaron, and released it commercially in a package called the \"Wizard Expansion Set\". This add-on pack also included 50 new levels from a competition held by the company specifically for the expansion; none of the new levels had any advanced features because of the limitations of the original construction set.\n\nElectronic Arts, including Paul Reiche III, used the Construction set created by Aaron and Craig to create a new set of levels. The Construction Set was also included by EA, as were a combination of levels from the original game and from the expansion pack, albeit in a different order from the original PP&S releases. The \"Ultimate Wizard\" version also featured some changes to existing levels to increase their difficulty, as well as different sprites for some of the game's monsters.\n\n\"Compute!'s Gazette\" approved of the \"instant playability\" of the Commodore 64 version of \"Ultimate Wizard\", reporting that it \"has become a favorite of the neighborhood youngsters\".\n\n"}

DCAS takes two not necessarily contiguous memory locations and writes new values into them only if they match pre-supplied \"expected\" values; as such, it is an extension of the much more popular compare-and-swap (CAS) operation.\n\nDCAS is sometimes confused with the double-width compare-and-swap (DWCAS) implemented by instructions such as x86 CMPXCHG16B. DCAS, as discussed here, handles two discontiguous memory locations, typically of pointer size, whereas DWCAS handles two adjacent pointer-sized memory locations.\n\nIn his doctoral thesis, Michael Greenwald recommended adding DCAS to modern hardware, showing it could be used to create easy-to-apply yet efficient software transactional memory (STM). Greenwald points out that an advantage of DCAS vs CAS is that higher-order (multiple item) CAS\"n\" can be implemented in O(\"n\") with DCAS, but requires O(\"n\" log \"p\") time with unary CAS, where \"p\" is the number of contending processes.\n\nOne of the advantages of DCAS is the ability to implement atomic deques (i.e. doubly linked lists) with relative ease.\nMore recently, however, it has been shown that an STM can be implemented with comparable properties using only CAS. In general however, DCAS is not a silver bullet: implementing lock-free and wait-free algorithms using it is typically just as complex and error-prone as for CAS.\n\nMotorola at one point included DCAS in the instruction set for its 68k series; however, the slowness of DCAS relative to other primitives (apparently due to cache handling issues) led to its avoidance in practical contexts. , DCAS is not natively supported by any widespread CPUs in production.\n\nThe generalization of DCAS to more than two addresses is sometimes called MCAS (multi-word CAS); MCAS can be implemented by a nestable LL/SC, but such a primitive is not directly available in hardware. MCAS can be implemented in software in terms of DCAS, in various ways. In 2013, Trevor Brown, Faith Ellen, and Eric Ruppert have implemented in software a multi-address LL/SC extension (which they call LLX/SCX) that while being more restrictive than MCAS enabled them, via some automated code generation, to implement one of the best performing concurrent binary search tree (actually a chromatic tree), slightly beating the JDK CAS-based skip list implementation.\n\nIn general, DCAS can be provided by a more expressive hardware transactional memory. IBM POWER8 and Intel Intel TSX provide working implementations of transactional memory. Sun's cancelled Rock processor would have supported it as well.\n\n"}

His first two books appeared under the pseudonym Patrizio Canaponi: the short story collection \"Een gondel in de Herengracht\" (\"A Gondola in the Herengracht\", 1978, Anton Wachter Prize, 1979) and the novel \"De draaideur\" (\"The Revolving Door\", 1979). Van der Heijden then began publishing under his own name in the 80s. Van der Heijden has won many awards, including all the big Dutch literary awards: the 2013 P. C. Hooft Award for his entire oeuvre, the 2012 Libris Literatuur Prijs for \"Tonio\", and the 2007 AKO Literatuurprijs for \"Het schervengericht\" and the 1997 AKO Literatuurprijs for \"Onder het plaveisel het moeras\".

The whole event is seen through the eyes of a social reject and ex-convict who is walking in the streets of Amsterdam at that particular day. He witnesses violent clashes between police and anti-monarchist anarchist squatters who provoke riots during the coronation, protesting against poor housing conditions and using the occasion to tackle the institution of monarchy and the idea of government authority in general.

Some examples of subalgebras are subgroups, submonoids, subrings, subfields, subalgebras of algebras over a field, or induced subgraphs. Shifting the point of view, the larger structure is called an extension or a superstructure of its substructure.\n\nIn model theory, the term \"submodel\" is often used as a synonym for substructure, especially when the context suggests a theory of which both structures are models.\n\nIn the presence of relations (i.e. for structures such as ordered groups or graphs, whose signature is not functional) it may make sense to relax the conditions on a subalgebra so that the relations on a weak substructure (or weak subalgebra) are \"at most\" those induced from the bigger structure. Subgraphs are an example where the distinction matters, and the term \"subgraph\" does indeed refer to weak substructures. Ordered groups, on the other hand, have the special property that every substructure of an ordered group which is itself an ordered group, is an induced substructure.\n\nGiven two structures \"A\" and \"B\" of the same signature σ, \"A\" is said to be a weak substructure of \"B\", or a weak subalgebra of \"B\", if\n\n\"A\" is said to be a substructure of \"B\", or a subalgebra of \"B\", if \"A\" is a weak subalgebra of \"B\" and, moreover,\n\nIf \"A\" is a substructure of \"B\", then \"B\" is called a superstructure of \"A\" or, especially if \"A\" is an induced substructure, an extension of \"A\".\n\nIn the language consisting of the binary functions + and ×, binary relation <, and constants 0 and 1, the structure (Q, +, ×, <, 0, 1) is a substructure of (R, +, ×, <, 0, 1). More generally, the substructures of an ordered field (or just a field) are precisely its subfields. Similarly, in the language (×, , 1) of groups, the substructures of a group are its subgroups. In the language (×, 1) of monoids, however, the substructures of a group are its submonoids. They need not be groups; and even if they are groups, they need not be subgroups.\n\nIn the case of graphs (in the signature consisting of one binary relation), subgraphs, and its weak substructures are precisely its subgraphs.\n\nFor every signature σ, induced substructures of σ-structures are the subobjects in the concrete category of σ-structures and strong homomorphisms (and also in the concrete category of σ-structures and σ-embeddings). Weak substructures of σ-structures are the subobjects in the concrete category of σ-structures and homomorphisms in the ordinary sense.\n\nIn model theory, given a structure \"M\" which is a model of a theory \"T\", a submodel of \"M\" in a narrower sense is a substructure of \"M\" which is also a model of \"T\". For example, if \"T\" is the theory of abelian groups in the signature (+, 0), then the submodels of the group of integers (Z, +, 0) are the substructures which are also abelian groups. Thus the natural numbers (N, +, 0) form a substructure of (Z, +, 0) which is not a submodel, while the even numbers (2Z, +, 0) form a submodel.\n\nOther examples:\n\nIn the category of models of a theory and embeddings between them, the submodels of a model are its subobjects.\n\n\n"}

It is a privately owned electronic commerce company based near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The retailer began operating in the mid-1990s.\n\nThe website offers mainstream and adult video via a group of websites which include \"AdultDVDEmpire.com\", \"AdultEmpire Unlimited\", \"AdultEmpire.com\", \"GayDVDEmpire.com\", \"AdultEmpireCash.com\", \"PornStarEmpire.com\" and \"UsedDVDEmpire.com\".\n\nDVDEmpire.com was created by Jeff Rix and John-Michael D’Arcangelo, two computer programmers. At the time they were both working on eCommerce projects for an industrial safety distributor. D’Arcangelo approached Rix, telling him about the new DVD format, pitching the idea of selling online. On August 18, 1997, DVDEmpire.com website was launched. It was incorporated in Pennsylvania on September 17, 1997 as Right Ascension, Inc. With $6,000 in start-up funds, the company became a full-time occupation for the two partners. The site's design aimed for ease of navigation, and allowed customers to edit every aspect of their orders prior to shipment, and were the first to offer pre-ordering of DVDs.\n\nIn late 1997, DVDEmpire.com launched AdultDVDEmpire.com and began selling adult DVDs. This move coincided with the first adult DVD release, Bobby Sox by Vivid Studios.\n\nThe website was first operated near Mars, Pennsylvania in early 1998. After outgrowing that location, operations were moved to its current facility in Warrendale, Pennsylvania in August 2000.\n\nRather than compete with other websites' spending on marketing, the owners of DVDEmpire.com instead chose to focus on building a closer relationship with existing customers. Efforts concentrated on customer service, website simplicity, and effective order fulfillment.\n\nIn 2000, as most other DVD retailers on the Internet were slashing prices (to the point where products were being sold at a loss), DVDEmpire.com remained one of the higher priced DVD retailers. By continuing to follow the original business plan of customer service and order fulfillment, DVDEmpire.com weathered the price wars and the dotcom collapses in 2000, and emerged with a still-viable company. In late 2000, their two largest competitors (Reel.com and DVDExpress.com) sold their assets and closed their doors.\n\nIn October 2015, Adult Empire announced a new partnership with TLA Entertainment.\n\nIn December 2006, Adult DVD Empire became the first adult retailer to start selling high-definition titles, with the release of Wicked Pictures' \"Camp Cuddly Pines Powertool Massacre\" on HD DVD. In March 2007, Adult DVD Empire became the first adult retailer to offer Blu-ray titles, starting with Vivid's \"Debbie Does Dallas ... Again\".\n\nIn June 2007, Adult DVD Empire became the first online retailer to offer adult content for the iPhone, partnering with Digital Playground to offer complete hard-core scenes and launched a fully responsive website in August 2015.\n\nIn September 2014, Adult DVD Empire released the first movie under its new production label, Adult Empire Films (later restyled as AE Films). The label received multiple nominations at both the AVN and XBIZ award ceremonies in 2016.\n\nIn February 2007, DVDEmpire.com announced that it would be closing its video game division. This announcement came in the form of an open letter to the industry, posted on their website, which included such statements as \"Video Game Industry Does Not Care\" and \"80% of Games Suck\". The letter cited preferential treatment for larger sellers, lack of price protection, and overall inferior game quality as the main contributors to the division's demise. (Note: The original letter is no longer available on DVDEmpire.com)\n\nTwo weeks later on February 12, 2007, DVDEmpire.com officially closed their games section and, according to another memo posted on their site, donated the remaining games to the Mars Home for Youth.\n\nThe company now employs 60 full- and part-time employees, with its websites handling up to 2.5 million unique visitors each month.

He served as a delegate for Pennsylvania to the Confederation Congress from 1785 to 1787.\n\nCharles Pettit was born in 1736. His parents were Andrew and Dinah (Woolverton) Pettit of Hunterdon County, New Jersey. \n\nIn 1758 he married Sarah Reed, a half-sister of Joseph Reed. Reed exerted considerable influence on Pettit's later career, bringing him into politics.\n\nIn 1767 Pettit accepted the first of many public service positions as a deputy surrogate for the province to assist his brother-in-law, Reed, who was Secretary. When Reed resigned in 1769, Pettit was appointed as the colony's secretary. \n\nAfter studying with an established firm, Pettit was admitted to the bar in 1770. In 1773 he was selected as a member of the Governor's Council.\n\nPettit served as a personal secretary to Governor William Franklin from 1772 to 1774, and moved to South Amboy, New Jersey. As the Revolution neared, he resigned his post. \n\nHe returned to it in 1776 when appointed as secretary to the revolutionary governor, William Livingston. From 1776 to 1778 Pettit held the office of provincial secretary (a title specified by the 1776 New Jersey State Constitution and later known as Secretary of State of New Jersey).\n\nIn 1777, his brother-in-law Joseph Reed again influenced his career. Reed was then serving in the Continental Congress and worked on the committee that recommended an overhaul of the quartermaster's function. In 1778, Pettit was appointed deputy quartermaster general, essentially a civilian post. But it came with a commission as a colonel in the Continental Army, a perk which offended some of the army's line officers. Pettit kept the accounts for the corps from then until his resignation in 1781. He also moved to Philadelphia to be closer to the Congress, which was temporarily meeting in New York. \n\nAfter his military service, Pettit resumed a mercantile career, this time in Philadelphia. He had been a member of the American Philosophical Society, based in that city, since 1779. He was elected to represent Philadelphia in the state's House of Representatives in 1784 and 1785. The legislature twice selected him as a delegate to the Continental Congress, where he served from 1785 to 1787. He also was appointed a trustee for the University of the State of Pennsylvania in 1786; he continued in the post after it merged to create the University of Pennsylvania in 1791.\n\nPettit died in Philadelphia in 1806.\n\n\n"}

Many reviewers have praised the game for making noticeable improvements over \"Zelda\", but various shortcomings – which include long passwords unless the system is used in conjunction with an add-on providing battery-backed RAM, repetitive gameplay, and poor collision detection – prevent the game from being superior to the 1986 Nintendo title. But overall, reviewers have called \"Neutopia\" one of the better video games of its type and one of the better titles in the TurboGrafx-16 library. There would eventually be a sequel to the game, \"Neutopia II\", in which Jazeta disappears and his son sets out to find him.\n\n\"Neutopia\" takes place in the distant past in the land of Neutopia – a prosperous and peaceful land in which the people worshipped at a Sacred Shrine and were watched over by Princess Aurora. The land was divided into four contiguous areas called spheres: land, subterrain, sea, and sky. The people lived in prosperity and happiness with the help of eight spiritual medallions which were controlled by the Princess and were used for good; a \"Climactic Castle\" was built as a symbolization of their prosperity. Each of the medallions represented powers of an ancestor whom Neutopia's nemesis, the evil demon Dirth, turned to stone but whose spirit remains.\n\nThen, one night, Dirth appears and invades the land. He sends his army of demons to ravage the land, and he captures Princess Aurora and holds her captive in the Climactic Castle, where he would rule over the invading demons. He also steals the eight medallions, which he now controls for evil purposes; he scatters the eight medallions across the four spheres and places them in crypts. A young warrior named Jazeta arrives at the Sacred Shine, where he is given a \"charmed compass\" which \"has the force of the medallions\" and can guide him to them. He is also told that he would inherit the wisdom of his ancestors and win the Princess' love if victorious. Jazeta then ventures out to defeat Dirth and rescue Princess Aurora, so that she can free Dirth's spell over the ancient ancestors' spirits and use the medallions to restore peace to Neutopia.\n\n\"Neutopia\" is an action adventure game which features a top-down perspective and labyrinthine exploration similar to that of \"The Legend of Zelda\". The player controls Jazeta as he sets out to rescue Princess Aurora from Dirth. The game has four levels called spheres which Jazeta must explore and recover the two medallions from each. The medallions are hidden in crypts, where each medallion is guarded by a boss. After collecting all eight of them, Jazeta gains access to the North Pole, where Dirth resides. The player controls Jazeta by moving in any direction with the control pad. Jazeta can also attack with his weapons or use items, scroll through messages, or access the \"status screen\" with the controller. Jazeta's life meter, the weapons he is currently holding, and the amount of gold and bombs remaining are displayed during gameplay on the top of the screen. On the status screen, players can choose an item to use, see which direction they must travel as indicated by the charmed compass (which also sounds an alarm when Jazeta is near a crypt or a medallion), and view the map of the crypt Jazeta is in, provided they have collected the Crystal Ball inside.\nThroughout the game, players can collect information from other non-player characters, many of whom are located in caves throughout the overworld, in which some can be uncovered only by burning objects with fire, blowing up walls with bombs, or by pushing certain rocks. While Jazeta's main weapon is a sword, he can also use other items scattered throughout the game. The \"fire rod\" unleashes fireballs whose strength and range depend on Jazeta's health level; Other items include the \"moonbeam moss\" which can illuminate dark rooms; the \"rainbow drop\" which allows Jazeta to cross small gaps; \"falcon shoes\" which give him extra speed; medicine which refills his life meter; magic rings which can transform tough enemies into weaker ones; hourglasses which temporarily stop enemies; and wings which can warp him back to the place where he last received a password. Jazeta can also obtain sword, shield, and armor upgrades throughout the game which can increase attack power, increase defense against projectiles, and decrease enemy damage, respectively; each type of sword, shield, and armor ranges from bronze to silver to \"strongest\". Enemies in the game include spear-throwing goblins, fireball-throwing fish, fake rocks, ghosts, and charging knights.\n\nJazeta has a life meter, which increases by one unit every time the player collects a medallion or finds a monk throughout the spheres; it decreases whenever he gets hit, and the game ends when it runs out. However, provided players have collected the \"Book of Revival\", they can continue and restart the game wherever they have last obtained a password, even after the console has been shut off; passwords also allow players to resume play at a later time. In addition, for users with a TurboGrafx-CD or a TurboBooster-Plus, they can save their progress in the systems' RAM via a \"File Cabinet\" feature; in the same places where passwords are distributed, players have the option to save the game in one of four available file slots, each of which can be overwritten at any time with a new file.\n\n\"Neutopia\" was developed by Hudson Soft and was released on in Japan for the PC Engine and in 1990 in North America for NEC's TurboGrafx-16 console. It received preview coverage in video game magazines \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" and \"GamePro\", which it was described in the latter as \"a magic and monsters type role play\". The game received a brief description in \"GamePro\"s May 1990 issue and a full walkthrough in the premiere issue of \"TurboPlay\" in June that year. It would later be released for the Wii's Virtual Console service in Japan on , in North America on , and in Europe on ; it was released alongside \"Super Metroid\" and \"\". It was released for the PlayStation Network along with a series of other TurboGrafx-16 titles that were published by Hudson Soft; it was released in Japan on , and in North America on . It was also later released in North America on March 2, 2017, around the same time as the launch of the Nintendo Switch and \"\".\n\nSince its release, people have widely regarded \"Neutopia\" as a clone of Nintendo's \"The Legend of Zelda\". The PC Engine version of the game was reviewed in the February 1990 issue of German magazine Power Play, where reviewer Martin Gaksch called the game \"\"Zelda\" on the PC-Engine\" and said that the \"differences between \"Zelda\" and \"Neutopia\" must be found with an electron microscope\". They said that the graphics, music, and gameplay were good, and that the only thing that kept \"Neutopia\" from being superior to \"Zelda\" was the 24-character password system and that the text was in Japanese. \n\n\"Neutopia\" received much coverage from various video gaming websites after its release on the Virtual Console, and each drew comparisons to \"Zelda\". Adam Romano from Defunct Games noted that \"Neutopia\" was released two years before \"\" and said that \"Neutopia\" \"kept pace with or were actually ahead of the Nintendo curve\". He said that gameplay and backgrounds remain varied and that \"the fire rod weapon is especially fun to wield\", but he noted that the things that keep the game from being better than \"Zelda\" were repetitive and frustrating dungeon exploring, boring boss battles, long passwords (for those who do not own a TurboGrafx-CD), and several \"head-scratching moments\" which include references to Judaism and Islam as well as quotes from \"Star Wars\". Marcel van Duyn from Nintendo Life noted many similarities to \"Zelda\", including the existence of 8 dungeons and medallions, the need to blow up walls or burn bushes to uncover secrets, the dungeon designs, and the need to push blocks to uncover staircases. However, he noted that what sets it apart from \"Zelda\" are the fire rod, the ability to warp with wings, and a lower difficulty level. He concluded that the game, while copying \"Zelda\", might be better as it added additional features that set it apart. Destructoid's Tony Ponce compared the game's copying of \"Zelda\" to \"China Warrior\"s copying of \"Kung-Fu Master\", and he pointed out what are also considered \"Zelda\" clones such as \"Crusader of Centy\" and \"Alundra\" for the Sega Genesis and PlayStation, respectively.\n\nGameSpot's Austin Shau reviewed \"Neutopia\" in November 2007 and said progression through the game was \"quick and direct\" but was also more linear, unlike with \"Zelda\". He praised the game for its variety of environments, which he said \"helps to combat monotony\", but he noted the lack of detail in the graphics itself. He also criticized the game's sound, in which he said the background music was a series of \"grating instrumentations\" while also pointing out the low-quality TurboGrafx-16 sound chip. IGN's Lucas Thomas called \"Neutopia\" \"one of the most shameless \"Legend of Zelda\" clones ever created\" in nearly every aspect. He praised one of the differences in the presence of the fire rod, which he said \"is unlike any weapon the 8-bit Link ever wielded\"; he also noted the clean, crisp graphics and a good quality soundtrack. However, he criticized another difference from \"Zelda\", that \"Neutopia\" had poor collision detection, saying that it can lead to additional damage to Jazeta, which causes the power of the fire rod to decrease and lead to the annoying \"beeping sound\" just as in \"Zelda\". In general, Thomas said that, despite its lack of originality, \"Neutopia\" is a good TurboGrafx-16 game which has deserved all the praise it has received.\n\n"}

Originally, Nemty appears to have been the patron of the ancient area around Badari, which was the center of the cult of Horus. Due to lack of surviving information, it is not very well known what the original function of Nemty was or whether he was more than just a title of Horus referring to some specific function.\n\nOver time, Nemty became considered simply as the god of ferrymen and was consequently depicted as a falcon standing on a boat, a reference to Horus, who was originally considered as a falcon. As god of ferrymen, he gained the title Nemty, meaning \"(one who) travels\". His later cult center was in Antaeopolis, but also in Per-Nemty (House of Nemty) in the 12th Upper Egyptian nome.\n\nNemty appears in the tale \"The Contendings of Horus and Seth\" which describes the settlement of the inheritance of Osiris, seen as a metaphor for the conquest of Lower Egypt by Upper Egypt (whose patron was Seth), at the beginning of the Old Kingdom. In this tale, one of Seth's attempts to gain power consists of his gathering together the gods and providing good arguments, convincing all of them (in later traditions, all except Thoth). Seth fears magical intervention by Isis, Horus' wife (in early Egyptian mythology), and so holds the gathering on an island, instructing Nemty not to allow anyone resembling Isis to be ferried there. However, Isis disguises herself as an old woman and unknowingly Nemty takes her across after being paid a gold ring, having rejected the first offer of gruel, resulting in the disruption of the council by her use of magic. Nemty is punished for his error, by having his toes cut off, which is more severe than it appears, since as a falcon, he would no longer be able to perch and thus would not be able to reside on the boat.\n\nIn older literature, the hieroglyphs of the god were read as \"Anti\" or \"Anty\". Several studies confirmed that this reading is not correct.\n"}

Tepper. The novels explore the Lands of the True Game, a portion of a planet explored by humanity somewhere in the future. (As such, these novels could be classified as (science fiction) although this does not become apparent until quite late in the overall story; up to that point, the stories appear to be fantasy.)\n\nEach of the trilogies focuses on the point of view of one particular character. The Peter trilogy tells the story from the point of view of Peter, a shape-shifting youth. The Mavin series tells an earlier portion of the story from the point of view of Mavin Manyshaped, Peter's shape-shifting mother. The Jinian series overlaps with and extends the Peter series and tells the story from the point of view of Jinian, a young wizardly woman.\n\nThe stories were subsequently collected into a one-volume edition titled \"The True Game\" (1985).\n\nThe stories were subsequently collected into a one-volume edition titled \"The Chronicles of Mavin Manyshaped\" (1985).\n\nThe stories were subsequently collected into a one-volume edition titled \"The End of the Game\" (Nelson Doubleday, 1986).\n\nWithin the Lands of the True Game, humans have come to possess \"talents\".\n\n\nAn additional group of humans known as the \"immutables\" has the ability to quench any of these talents while another group of humans, the \"wizards\", has the ability to use magic/technology to produce effective results. Wizardry is learned, rather than appearing in adolescence as a talent does. Having any other talent does not negate wizardry. The so-called \"thirteenth talent\" was confirmed only to be possessed by one person, and was the ability to \"link\" with others and utilise or combine their talents.\n\nOther humans are just ordinary humans and are referred to as pawns.\n\nFor the most part, the talented humans live in groups called demesnes and the demesnes are constantly warring with each other in great games. In the process, as usually occurs with wars, death and destruction and waste occurs, especially among the pawns. The stories examine the morality of the so-called True Game and other related issues.\n\nAs time goes on, we are introduced to the earlier history of humans on the planet and even to the creatures who occupied the planet prior to the arrival of the humans (and who are now much-diminished as a result of human colonization). Ultimately, the story deals with the question of whether life on the planet will survive at all.\n\nOrson Scott Card reported that the series came to \"a powerful, illuminating conclusion that lifts this story out of the ranks of grunting blood-and-thunder adventure and into the heady realm of thoughtful, entertaining science fiction.\"\n"}

He represented \"Kristiania Skøiteklub\" (now \"Oslo Skøiteklub\").\n\nOscar Mathisen was born in Kristiania (now Oslo) as the youngest of seven children. His parents, Carl Anton Mathisen (born in Østre Toten in 1852) and Pauline Mathisen (born in Vang, Hedmark in 1853), had five sons and two daughters: Carl Markus (1875), Petter Jørgen (1877), Johan Ingval (1879), Agnis Pauline (1880), Sigurd Valdemar (1883), Margit Antoni (1885), and Oscar Wilhelm (1888), all born in Kristiania.\n\nOscar Mathisen was National Champion in 1907 at the age of 18, and became World Champion the following year (four years after his brother Sigurd Mathisen), despite falling on the 500 m. During his career, he set 14 world records, with his 1,500 m record from 1914 standing unrivalled for 23 years. The day before he set that 1,500 m record, he had broken Jaap Eden's world record on the 5,000 m and thereby had become the world record holder on all distances. He became World Allround Champion five times, a record that stood until 2013 when it was broken by Sven Kramer, and European Allround Champion three times.\n\nAfter World War I, he became a professional skater and he was Professional World Champion in 1920. He continued his skating career until 1929. In that last year of his career, then 40 years old, he went to Davos, where people were preparing for the European Championships, and proved that he could still skate fast by beating the world record times on both the 500 m and the 1,000 m, although his times were not recognised as world records because he was a professional skater.\n\nMathisen always was a gentleman in defeat and showed genuine respect towards skaters who had beaten him and top skaters afterwards, as illustrated by his losses against Nikolay Strunnikov and his message to Oleg Goncharenko. His life ended tragically. Mathisen killed his wife and then himself after his wife had suffered from severe depressions for many years.\n\nIn 1959, a statue of Mathisen was erected outside of Frogner stadion in Oslo, where he celebrated many of his triumphs. Every year since 1959, the Oscar Mathisen Memorial Trophy is awarded to the most outstanding speed skating performance of the season.\n\nAn overview of medals won by Mathisen at important championships he participated in, listing the years in which he won each:\n\nOver the course of his career, Mathisen skated 14 world records:\n\nTo put these personal records in perspective, the \"Notes\" column lists the official world records on the dates that Mathisen skated his personal records.\n\nNote that Mathisen's personal records on the 500 m and the 1,000 m were not recognised as world records by the International Skating Union (ISU) because Mathisen was a professional skater when he set those.\n\nApart from on the 3,000 m, every one of these personal records was faster than the official world record on the given distance at the time, while in most cases, Mathisen himself already was the world record holder. As for the 3,000 m, this was not an official world record event, as governed by the ISU, until 1932. Both the first official world record on this distance (by Clas Thunberg in 1932) and the second one (by Michael Staksrud in 1933) were actually slower than Mathisen's personal record. When Ivar Ballangrud set the third official world record on the 3,000 m in 1935, the 3,000 m world record finally was faster than Mathisen's personal record.\n\nMathisen has an Adelskalender score of 192.560 points. He held first place on the Adelskalender for 7,649 days between 1909 and 1930, more than twice as long as anyone else. The number two on the list of people who led the Adelskalender for the highest number of days is Ivar Ballangrud (who actually replaced Mathisen at the top of the Adelskalender) with 3,675 days.\n\n"}

Carey\n\nWilliam Polk Carey (May 11, 1930 – January 2, 2012) was an American philanthropist and businessman. He was the founder of W. P. Carey & Co., a corporate real estate financing firm headquartered in New York City, and donated the funds to establish the Carey Business School at Johns Hopkins University, the University of Maryland Francis King Carey School of Law and the W. P. Carey School of Business at Arizona State University.\n\nAs a young man, Carey attended elementary school at Calvert School and left Roland Park's Gilman School to go to the Pomfret School in Connecticut, then attended Princeton University. He left Princeton for supposedly missing chapel, and attended the University of Pennsylvania before establishing himself in New Jersey working in his step-father's car dealership. Carey resided in New York City and Rensselaerville, New York. Carey was an alumnus of the Delta Phi fraternity and was an active member in the University of Pennsylvania chapter. He was an active member of the University Club in NYC. He was also Governor General of the Society of Mayflower Descendants in New York State.\n\nIn the mid-1990s, the Gilman School started discussing much-needed renovations of Carey Hall, the school's main building which houses the Upper School students. Carey Hall, named after Carey's grandmother, was constructed in 1910 and remained the same until late 2006. Carey donated 10 million dollars to the school's capital campaign fund, a sum that was one fifth of the total amount of money raised for the renovation of Carey Hall. On December 10, 2007, Carey Hall was officially re-opened as Carey cut the ribbon signaling the start of a new generation in a new, updated Carey Hall.\n\nCarey was benefactor to the Arizona State University College of Business. In 2002, Carey donated $50 million to the College of Business. In recognition of his gift, the University renamed its business school the W. P. Carey School of Business.\n\nCarey announced December 5, 2006, his donation of $50 million to The Johns Hopkins University. He was a trustee emeritus at Hopkins and donated the money through his W.P. Carey Foundation. The gift was the largest to Hopkins in support of business education and is now called the Carey Business School. The Hopkins business school will be named after William Carey's great-great-great-grandfather, James Carey. The school offers full- and part-time MBA programs, as well as specialized master's degree programs in finance, marketing, information systems, health care management, and enterprise risk management. The school's Master of Science in Real Estate program was one of the first in the Baltimore/Washington, D.C. corridor.\n\nOn April 25, 2011, Carey announced his donation of $30 million to The University of Maryland School of Law. The emphasis of the gift was to increase the school's endowment. The school is being named after Carey's grandfather, Francis King Carey, who was a graduate of the Law School (Class of 1880).\n\nIn 2019, The W. P. Carey Foundation donated $125 million to the University of Pennsylvania Law School, setting a new record as the largest gift to a law school. In recognition of the Foundation and its long-term involvement with Penn, the Penn Board of Trustees approved a resolution designating that the school would be named the University of Pennsylvania Carey Law School as of November 8, 2019. The name change, which the Carey Foundation and the University of Pennsylvania Law School had intended to take place simultaneously with the announcement of the gift, proved unpopular with students and alumni, thousands of whom quickly signed an online petition protesting the Foundation's decision to replace \"Penn Law\" with \"Carey Law\" as the law school's new \"short form\" name; in response to the backlash, the Law School and Foundation agreed to delay the full name-change to \"Penn Carey Law\" until the beginning of the 2022 Fall Term.\n\n"}
{"id": "2057851", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2057851", "title": "Podmore case", "text": "Podmore case\n\nThe Podmore Case was a controversial landmark English criminal case. It involved a murder conviction based on a painstaking police investigation, and from careful evaluation of the forensic evidence.\n\nOn 10 January 1929, two men found the decomposing, rat-bitten body of a man behind some boxes in a locked garage in Southampton; the garage was used as a storeroom by the local agent of the Wolf's Head Oil Company, and the body was identified as that of the agent Vivian Messiter, who had been missing for some time.\n\nThe victim was reported as missing for nine weeks prior to the discovery of his body, and while police had checked the garage, they did not pursue the matter thoroughly since they found it locked. It was only when a new oil company agent came to take over the garage when it was opened and the body discovered.\n\nPreliminary examination of the body revealed a puncture over the left eye, which led police to think that Messiter had been shot, but further examination by Sir Bernard Spilsbury indicated that the real cause of death was multiple severe blunt force trauma to the skull, so much so that \"it was fractured everywhere except on top\". The examination of the crime scene further revealed the presence of extensive blood splatter to the height of several feet, which meant that the man had been murdered in the same location.\n\nA bloodstained hammer was found near the scene, and upon examination of it, Spilsbury found a hair consistent with that of the eyebrow hair of the dead man. Since the wounds on the victim were also consistent with the hammer, it was Spilbury's conclusion that the hammer, wielded with great force, was the murder weapon.\n\nAmong the papers that were found was a reply to an advertisement for local agents, signed \"William F. Thomas\". In pursuing this lead the police were able to discover that a man of that name had worked for a Wiltshire building contractor and had disappeared after allegedly absconding with a large number of wage packets.\n\nDetectives assigned to the case next went to the lodgings where \"Mr. Thomas\" had stayed before his disappearance. Apparently his departure was so hurried that he negligently left many clues behind. From these the police were able to determine that \"William Thomas\" was an alias for one William Henry Podmore, who was known to the police, as he was wanted for fraud in Manchester. Suspicion immediately fell on him, and he was subsequently arrested and brought in for questioning.\n\nIt was determined that Podmore did indeed work as Messiter's assistant, but as the police still did not have enough evidence for him to be charged with murder, he was convicted of fraud and sentenced to six months in prison.\n\nIn the meantime, a breakthrough in the case came with the careful examination of a receipt book for oil sale commissions. Based on a study of indentations between the lines of a genuine receipt made by pencilled writing on the sheet above—which had been torn out—it was determined that Podmore had been reporting to Messiter sales of oil to non-existent customers, and collecting commissions on these sales. Police theorized that upon learning of this, Messiter had confronted Podmore about the swindle, whereupon Podmore, being aware of the Manchester charge, had lost his nerve and murdered him with the hammer.\n\nWhile in prison on the fraud charge, Podmore confessed that he had stolen money from Messiter. This was reported to the authorities and he was arrested immediately on his release from Winchester prison and sentenced to a further six months. During this second term of imprisonment he again spoke to fellow prisoners about the murder. Consequently, fourteen months after the murder, the police were certain that they now had enough evidence to charge Podmore with murder. His trial began in March 1930 at Winchester Assizes. Because it was obvious that Messiter had still been repeatedly battered with the hammer even when unconscious, public opinion was overwhelmingly against Podmore. While the hair evidence was played up by the media, it was only part of a painstaking police investigation although it unquestionably identified the murder weapon. Of greater importance was the receipt book, as well the testimony of two fellow prisoners of Podmore who stated that he had confessed in their presence.\n\nWilliam Henry Podmore was found guilty of the murder of Messiter, and hanged on 22 April 1930 despite some public outcry against the verdict.\n\n"}

Fox Airfield is a county-owned, public airport in Los Angeles County, California, five miles northwest of Lancaster, California. Locally known as Fox Field, the airport serves the Antelope Valley.\n\nThe National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2011–2015 categorized it as a \"general aviation\" facility. The airport has limited scheduled cargo operations. The U.S. Forest Service has a fixed wing airtanker base on the airfield which becomes one of the main hubs in the region for aerial firefighting suppression efforts during fire season.\n\nFox Field had scheduled passenger air service as early as the late 1950s operated by Southwest Airways with Douglas DC-3 aircraft primarily to the Los Angeles International Airport (LAX). Southwest Airways then changed its name to Pacific Air Lines which in 1959 was operating new Fairchild F-27 turboprops from the airport nonstop to Las Vegas and also to Burbank Airport (BUR, now Hollywood Burbank Airport) on a daily basis as well as operating Martin 4-0-4 and DC-3 prop aircraft on flights to LAX. By 1960, Pacific was operating daily F-27 propjet flights to San Francisco (SFO) from Fox Field via a stop in Bakersfield and also nonstop to LAX. In 1968, Pacific Air Lines merged with Bonanza Air Lines and West Coast Airlines to form Air West which in turn continued to serve the airport with F-27 flights to LAX. Also in 1968, Cable Commuter Airlines was operating de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter service to LAX. Air West then changed its name to Hughes Airwest which continued to operate scheduled passenger service with the Fairchild F-27 turboprop primarily to Los Angeles International Airport during the early 1970s with several nonstop flights a day. By 1983, Mojave Airlines was operating flights to LAX, San Diego, Ontario and Mammoth Yosemite Airport with Beechcraft C99 turboprops. In 1985, commuter air carrier Desert Sun Airlines was operating up to five flights a day nonstop to LAX with Beechcraft 99 turboprops.\n\nFox Field currently does not have any scheduled passenger flights with the nearest airline service being available at the Bob Hope Airport in Burbank.\n\nGeneral William J.

The Portuguese state privatised the company in several phases, from 1996 to 2011.\n\nIn March 2007 the group made a US$3 billion takeover of Horizon Wind Energy, the Texan-based wind power producer. At the time, it was the largest renewable energy deal to date and made EDP the fourth largest wind power producer in the world. The firm's renewables operations (including Horizon) are now contained within its majority-owned subsidiary EDP Renováveis, 25% of which was floated on the Lisbon Stock Exchange in 2008.\n\nThe company was ranked at position 239 in the 2009 issue of the Forbes Global 2000.\n\nChina Three Gorges Corporation, a SOE, won in December 2011 the bidding for the Portuguese government's 21.35% interest in the company. The transaction is expected to be concluded by April 2012. As of February 2014, just under 45% of the ownership of EDP was controlled by five institutional shareholders. Amongst the others were the Qatar Investment Authority and BlackRock.\n\nIn late 2018 EDP's largest shareholder, China Three Gorges Corporation, proposed a hostile takeover of EDP. This was ultimately rejected at the shareholders meeting on April 24, 2019.\n\nThe Group became the first Iberian company to own significant generating and distribution assets in both sides of the border, with a controlling position in the Spanish company HC Energía, and it is also present in the electricity sectors of Latin America – with a major presence in the United States, Brazil, Africa and Macau, in the generation, distribution and trading businesses.\n\nThe EDP Group's activities are centered on the generation and distribution of electric power, as well as the information technologies areas. In addition, the group's business includes complementary and related areas, such as water, gas, engineering, laboratory testing, vocational training and real estate management. It once had businesses in the IT consulting (Edinfor) and telecommunications (ONI Telecom) sectors, but these were sold, respectively, to Logica and the private equity group The Riverside Company.\n\nIn 2006 35% of the energy produced by EDP was from renewable energy sources, and, as of the end of 2007, the company announced that 39% of its energy was already emissions-free and that it was aiming for a 75% renewable energy production by 2013.\n\nIn November 2019 EDP announced that it had reached a 50/50 Joint Venture agreement with the French gas and power company Engie to merge their fixed and floating offshore wind power activities, primarily targeting markets in Europe, the United States and selected geographies in Asia. \n\nThe EDP Foundation is a non-profit organization set up and financed by the company as a means to foster the development of cultural, scientific and educational activities. It is headquartered at \"Central Tejo\", a former CRGE-owned 50 MW coal-powered plant at the Lisbon riverfront, decommissioned in the 1960s.

As a Cleveland rookie he was a key return man, averaging 24.3 yards per return and contributing to the Browns' 1964 NFL championship, and backup running back behind featured fullback Jim Brown and blocking halfback Ernie Green. He moved up to become the Browns' featured running back after Brown's retirement at the end of the 1965 season.\n\nWhen Jim Brown retired before the 1966 season, Kelly became the starter. For the next three years, he rushed for 1,000 yards, led the NFL in rushing touchdowns, and won All-NFL and starting Pro Bowl honors.

In 1929, after a few months of violin instruction, he began to take piano lessons with Marius-François Gaillard. Marguerite Long became his piano teacher in 1933, and three years later, Paul Pannesay. In 1938, Cochereau was introduced to the pipe organ by Marie-Louise Girod, a student of Marcel Dupré. He continued his organ studies with André Fleury and Paul Delafosse, whom Cochereau succeeded as titular organist at St. Roch in Paris in 1942.\n\nAfter one year of law studies, Cochereau decided to dedicate himself to a musical career, and entered the Conservatory of Paris in 1943. He left the Conservatory in 1949 with first prizes in harmony (class of Maurice Duruflé), music history, fugue and counterpoint (class of Noël Gallon), composition (class of Tony Aubin), and organ (class of Marcel Dupré).\n\nIn September 1948, Cochereau made his first recital tour to Hungary. One year later, he married Nicole Lacroix, a pianist and composer, with whom he had two children: Jean-Marc (1949–2011), conductor and late director of the Tours Conservatory, and Marie-Pierre, a professional harpist.\n\nIn 1949, at age 26, Pierre Cochereau was appointed director of the Le Mans Conservatory, where he stayed until 1956.

He was buried at the Cimetière Belleville in Paris.\n\nPierre Cochereau had a worldwide reputation as a concert organist and especially as a brilliant improviser. In his improvisations, Cochereau had created a musical language that was eminently personal, recognizable as of the opening notes. Stylistic influences regarding counterpoint, formal structure, and harmonic language, included composers such as Marcel Dupré, Maurice Duruflé, Noël Gallon, Olivier Messiaen, and Florent Schmitt.\n\nAs a composer, Cochereau left several organ works, chamber music, and choir compositions. Many of Cochereau's organ improvisations were transcribed and published.\n\nIn 2012 Anthony Hammond published, with the University of Rochester Press (Eastman School of Music), a book on Pierre Cochereau – the first full-length English language study of him, written with full assistance and support from the Cochereau family and former colleagues.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Gorsuch (/ˈɡɔːrsətʃ/), was an American attorney and politician. Between 1981 and 1983, while known as Anne M. Gorsuch, she served under President Ronald Reagan as the first female Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). She was the mother of current Associate Justice of the Supreme Court Neil Gorsuch.\n\nBorn Anne Irene McGill in Casper, Wyoming, she was one of seven children of Joseph John McGill II, a surgeon, and Dorothy Jean (née O'Grady). She grew up in Denver, where she attended St. Francis DeSales High School.\n\nDuring three consecutive summers, she took classes in Spanish at the National University of Mexico. She studied at the University of Colorado at Boulder, earning a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1961 at the age of 19. She then attended the University of Colorado Law School where she received a Juris Doctor degree in 1964 at the age of 22. McGill participated in the undergraduate Honors Program and Mortar Board society, and was an editor of the University of Colorado Law School's law review. She was awarded a Fulbright Scholarship to study criminal law for one year in Jaipur, India, and she and her new husband David Gorsuch travelled there together\n\nGorsuch was first employed as an attorney with a bank trust department, then as an assistant district attorney for Jefferson County, Colorado, and as deputy district attorney for the City of Denver, Colorado. Subsequently she was a corporate attorney for Mountain Bell Telephone. In 1975 she was elected to the Colorado House of Representatives, and served in office for two two-year terms. She was voted Outstanding Freshman Legislator, but was considered by some to be a member of the \"House Crazies,\" a group of \"conservative lawmakers intent on permanently changing government.\"\n\nIn 1980, Gorsuch served on President-elect Reagan's transition team as a member of his Advisory Committee on Intergovernmental Relations. Shortly after Reagan was inaugurated, Gorsuch was nominated as administrator of the EPA. The nomination was unanimously confirmed by the Senate three months later on May 5, 1981.\n\nGorsuch based her administration of the EPA on the New Federalism approach of downsizing federal agencies by delegating their functions and services to the individual states. She believed that the EPA was over-regulating business and that the agency was too large and not cost-effective. During her 22 months as agency head, she cut the budget of the EPA by 22%, reduced the number of cases filed against polluters, relaxed Clean Air Act regulations, and facilitated the spraying of restricted-use pesticides. She cut the total number of agency employees, and hired staff from the industries they were supposed to be regulating. Environmentalists contended that her policies were designed to placate polluters, and accused her of trying to dismantle the agency.\n\nThriftway Company, a small oil refinery in Farmington, New Mexico, asked Gorsuch for a meeting to discuss the regulations limiting lead content of gasoline, the program under Section 211 of the Clean Air Act designed to reduce the amount of lead in gasoline in annual phases, and to receive relief from the standard. In December 1981, while EPA was developing revisions to those regulation at the request of the Reagan Administration, Gorsuch met with representatives from the company, who asked her to excuse Thriftway from compliance with the lead limits because \"the company faced financial ruin if it could not obtain quick relief from the regulations\". Gorsuch did not commit herself in writing but she did tell them they could count on her promise as the word of the EPA Administrator that she would not enforce the regulations.\n\nIn 1982, Congress charged that the EPA had mishandled the $1.6 billion toxic waste Superfund by taking certain inappropriate and potentially illegal actions including withholding disbursements in order to affect a California political campaign. When Congress demanded records from Gorsuch, she refused and as a result became the first agency director in U.S. history to be cited for contempt of Congress. The stand off ended during late February 1983, when Richard Hauser, the deputy White House counsel, confirmed one or more Reagan Administration officials had in fact reported to the White House that they had heard the E.P.A. administrator say at an Aug. 4 1982 luncheon aboard the former Presidential yacht Sequoia that she was holding back more than $6 million in Federal funds to clean up the Stringfellow Acid Pits toxic waste site near Los Angeles to avoid helping the Senate campaign of former Gov. Jerry Brown of California, a Democrat. The White House then abandoned its court claim that the documents related to this incident could not be subpoenaed by Congress because they were covered by executive privilege and the EPA turned the documents over to Congress. Gorsuch immediately resigned her post effective March 3, 1983, citing pressures caused by the media and the congressional investigation.\n\nLooking back at her tenure several years later, Gorsuch expressed pride in the downsizing done under her watch and frustration at the program backlogs and lack of staff management skills that she encountered while at the helm of the agency. She said there was a conflict between what she was required to do under a \"set of commands from Congress,\" and what her own priorities were, although she felt that by the end of her administration, she had developed a way of resolving those conflicts. In her retrospective, Gorsuch admitted that she and her staff \"were so bogged down in the fight with Congress over the doctrine of executive privilege, that the agency itself seemed hardly to be functioning,\" but claimed that despite appearances the agency still functioned. Analysts have argued that she was given a difficult job by the Reagan Administration, but she was not provided the support she needed, leading to her early departure from her director position at the EPA.\n\nGorsuch was promised another job by Reagan, and in July 1984, he appointed her to a three-year term as chair of the National Advisory Committee on Oceans and Atmosphere, a move that was criticized by environmental groups. She described the post as a \"nothing-burger\", and both the House and the Senate passed non-binding resolutions calling on President Reagan to withdraw the appointment. Ultimately, Gorsuch chose not to accept the position.\n\nAfter leaving government service, she wrote a 1986 book about her experiences entitled \"Are You Tough Enough?\" She then worked as a private attorney in Colorado until her death.\n\nAnne McGill married David Gorsuch after finishing law school.

A model for all motion picture cameras they have produced is the \"cat-on-the-shoulder\", a small, light, quiet motion picture camera.\n\nIn the late 60's Beauviala was working as a professor of electronics in the University of Grenoble. With the project to make a movie about the evolution of the city and of its architecture, but unable to find the proper tools, Beauviala decided to create the camera himself. Though the movie would eventually be abandoned this led to the creation of Aaton in 1971.\n\nAfter several initial prototypes, the Aaton LTR 16 mm movie camera became available on the market in the late 1970s. It has been succeeded by several improved models, including the LTR, LTR 54, XTR, X0, XTRplus, and XTRProd.\n\nAaton also pioneered the linking of timecode to motion pictures in the acquisition stage. Aatoncode was one of the earliest schemes for encoding a timecode signal in the frame margins of 16mm film, allowing rigorous synchronization of audio and film in post-production.\n\nAs of January 2015, the currently available line of cameras offers the 16mm Xterà (along with its still used predecessors the XTR Prod), the A-Minima (a small camcorder-sized 16mm camera) and the 35mm Penelope (along with the still in use 35-III).\n\nIn 2004 Aaton introduced the Cantar-X, a multichannel digital audio recorder designed to be used on location.\n\nIn 2005/2006, the company started to test and exhibit the successor to the 35‑III, a quiet 35mm camera called Penelope. Specially designed with a native 2-perf camera system (with an optional kit to switch to 3-Perf), the Penelope eventually became available for purchase in October 2008.\n\nDuring the 2010 NAB Show Jean-Pierre Beauviala and AbelCine officially announced Aaton's first digital camera, called Delta Penelope. A fully functional prototype was exhibited at the NAB Show two years later, with plans for a limited test run in 2012 and an eventual release in 2013. Evolving from a variation of the Penelope (with a digital mag) to a new concept, the camera most notably featured a \"cat-on-the-shoulder\" inspired design and a Dalsa Super-35 CCD sensor (with a native 3.5K resolution) mounted on a specially developed/patented mechanism designed to bring unprecedented image quality, closer to what film provides.\n\nOn April 26, 2013, an official statement was issued by founder Jean-Pierre Beauviala announcing that due to quality issues involving the Dalsa sensors for the planned Delta Penelope, the company had to declare bankruptcy so it could have time to find a new investor. In May 2013 Beauviala sent an e-mail detailing the situation of Aaton and explaining that despite the recent troubles the company was still functioning and mainly developing its next digital audio recorder (tentatively called Cantar-X+), and a digital-camera aiming at documentary-style filming (called D-Minima).\n\nOn June 18, 2013, Transvideo acquired Aaton through its holding company ITHAKI. Still based in Grenoble and with the same development team, the new company now named Aaton Digital was then focusing on the release of their new digital recorder (the Cantar-X3) and planning the release of a new \"cat-on-the-shoulder\" (sic).\n\nOn October 22, 2013, Jean-Pierre Beauviala left Aaton Digital/Transvideo where he was working as a consultant.\nThis latest information engage only Jean-Pierre Beauviala as he never had any kind of formal cooperation with Aaton-Digital.\n\nIn March, 2014, Aaton Digital officially introduced the Cantar-X3, the next successor in their line of on-field digital audio recorder.\nIn March 2015 the first commercial Cantar-X3 is delivered to the NoyzBoyz in Amsterdam, more than 100 products are in order confirming the fantastic interest of the audio community for this new sound machine and also the creativity of Aaton's engineers.\n\nIn March, 2017, Aaton Digital launched the CantarMini and the same month won the \"best of Show Award\" at the \"NAB show\" in Las Vegas.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Invasion of the Flying Saucers and Flying Saucers from Outer Space) is a 1956 American horror science fiction film from Columbia Pictures, produced by Charles H. Schneer, directed by Fred F. Sears, that stars Hugh Marlowe and Joan Taylor. \"Earth vs. the Flying Saucers\" was released as a double feature with \"The Werewolf\".\n\nThe film's storyline was suggested by the bestselling, 1953 non-fiction book \"Flying Saucers from Outer Space\" by Maj. Donald Keyhoe.\n\nThe film's stop-motion animation special effects were created by Ray Harryhausen.\nScientist Dr. Russell Marvin (Hugh Marlowe) and his new bride Carol (Joan Taylor) are driving to work when a flying saucer appears overhead. Without proof of the encounter, other than a tape recording of the ship's sound, Dr. Marvin is hesitant to notify his superiors. He is in charge of Project Skyhook, an American space program that has already launched 10 research satellites into orbit. General Hanley (Morris Ankrum), Carol's father, informs Marvin that many of the satellites have since fallen back to Earth. Marvin admits that he has lost contact with all of them and privately suspects alien involvement. The Marvins then witness the 11th falling from the sky shortly after launch.\n\nWhen a saucer lands at Skyhook the next day, a group of aliens in metallic suits exit, and the infantry guards open fire, resulting in the death of one alien, while others and the saucer are protected by a force field. The aliens proceed to kill everyone at the facility but the Marvins; General Hanley is captured and taken away in the saucer. Too late, Russell discovers and decodes a message on his tape recorder: the aliens wanted to meet with Dr. Marvin and landed in peace at Skyhook for that purpose, but instead, they were met with violence. Impatient to conduct that meeting after everything has gone sideways, Marvin contacts the aliens and steals away to meet them, followed closely by Carol and Major Huglin (Donald Curtis). They and a pursuing motorcycle patrol officer are taken aboard a saucer, where the aliens extract knowledge directly from the General's brain. The aliens explain they are last of their species, having fled from their destroyed solar system. They have shot down all the launched satellites, fearing them as weapons. As proof of their power, the aliens give Dr. Marvin the coordinates of a naval destroyer that opened fire on them, and which they have since destroyed. Horrified by the cold, unempathic nature of the aliens, Carol begins to break down, and the patrol officer, despite an attempt by Marvin to stop him, pulls his revolver and fires on the aliens; he is subjected to the same mind control process as General Hanley. The aliens explain that they will eventually return General Hanley and the patrol officer. As the interaction continues, Carol becomes increasingly irrational, while Marvin tries to remain calm. Major Huglin and the Marvins are released with the message that the aliens want to meet with the world's leaders in 56 days in Washington, D.C. to negotiate an occupation of Earth.\n\nDr. Marvin's later observations discover that the aliens' protective suits are made of solidified electricity, and grant them advanced auditory perception. From other observations, Marvin develops a counter-weapon against their flying saucers, which he later successfully tests against a single saucer. As they escape, the aliens jettison Gen. Hanley and the patrol officer, both falling to their deaths. Groups of alien saucers then attack Washington, Paris, London, and Moscow, but are destroyed by Dr. Marvin's sonic weapon. The defenders also discover that the aliens can be easily killed by simple small arms gunfire once they are outside the force fields of their saucers.\n\nWith the alien threat eliminated, Dr. Marvin and Carol quietly celebrate the victory by going back to their favorite beach, resuming their lives as newlyweds.\n\n\nSpecial effects expert Ray Harryhausen animated the film's flying saucers using stop-motion animation. Harryhausen also animated the falling masonry when saucers crash into various government buildings and monuments in order to make the action appear realistic. Some figure animation was used to show the aliens emerging from the saucers. A considerable amount of stock footage was also used, notably scenes during the invasion that showed batteries of U.S. 90 mm M3 guns and an early missile launch. Stock footage of the destruction of the warship HMS \"Barham\" during World War II was used for the United States Navy destroyer that is sunk by a flying saucer. Satellite launch depictions made use of stock film images from a Viking rocket launch and a failure of a German V-2 rocket. The aircraft that are shown crashing after being hit by an alien ray is actual stock footage shot of a real military aircraft accident that happened during World War II, on July 23, 1944.\n\nThe voice of the aliens was produced from a recording made by Paul Frees (uncredited) reading their lines and then hand-jiggling the speed control of an analog reel-to-reel tape recorder, so that it continually wavered from a slow bass voice to one that is high and fast.\n\nDuring a question-and-answer period at a tribute to Ray Harryhausen and a screening of \"Jason and the Argonauts\" held in Sydney, Australia, Harryhausen said he sought advice from noted 1950s UFO \"contactee\" George Adamski on the depiction of the flying saucers used in the film. He also noted that Adamski appeared to have grown increasingly paranoid by that time. The film's iconic flying saucer design (a static central cabin with an outer rotating ring with slotted vanes) matches descriptions given to Maj. Donald Keyhoe of flying disc sightings in his best-selling flying saucer book.\n\nFrom contemporary reviews, \"Earth vs. the Flying Saucers\" was reviewed in \"Variety\", where the reviewer noted that the special effects were the real stars of the film. \"This exploitation programmer does a satisfactory job of entertaining in the science-fiction class. The technical effects created by Ray Harryhausen come off excellently in the Charles H. Schneer production, adding the required out-of-this-world visual touch to the screenplay, taken from a screen story by Curt Siodmak, suggested by Major Donald E. Keyhoe's \"Flying Saucers from Outer Space\". The \"Los Angeles Times\" was also fairly positive, writing that although the saucers \"look like art department concoctions\", the film still \"has a sort of pseudoscientific charm\". The \"Monthly Film Bulletin\" gave the film a negative review, stating that the \"semi-documentary technique\" was \"pretentious\" and the film's use of stock footage, \"crude model-work\" and most of the best-known science-fiction clichés made the film \"a long-winded and rather bleak invasion from outer space\". Bosley Crowther of \"The New York Times\" was also negative, calling the film \"utter nonsense that is childishly and humorlessly put forth\".\n\n\"Earth vs. the Flying Saucers\" has reached an iconic status in that many films in the \"flying saucer\" subgenre that followed, imitated and incorporated many of the elements established by Ray Harryhausen. In an article for \"The New York Times\" film reviewer Hal Erickson noted that, \"Anyone who's seen the 1996 science-fiction lampoon \"Mars Attacks!\" may have trouble watching \"Earth vs. the Flying Saucers\" with a straight face\". The later campy film could be seen as an homage to the era, especially to the contributions made by \"Earth vs. the Flying Saucers\".\n\nThe four-issue comic book mini-series \"Flying Saucers vs. the Earth\" (2008), released by TidalWave Productions as part of their Ray Harryhausen Signature Series, re-imagined the events of the film from the perspective of the alien invaders, identified here as the Sons of Aberrann. A preview of the first issue was included on the 50th Anniversary DVD release of the film.\n\n"}

The company uses eucalyptus as the prime raw material for the production of pulp and fine printing and writing paper. Portucel is Europe's largest producer of bleached eucalyptus kraft pulp. It is also one of the five largest European producers of uncoated wood-free paper.\n\nPublicly traded on Euronext Lisbon, Portucel is controlled by the industrial conglomerate Semapa which owns almost 77% of its shares.\n\nAs part of the significant investment in the expansion and internationalization of its production activities, the “Portucel Soporcel Group” has taken the decision to change its corporate brand to “The Navigator Company”.\n\nThe company has its origins in the early 1950s, when the paper mill of Cacia, Baixo Vouga, started its operations. After the Carnation Revolution in 1974, the Portuguese paper industry was nationalized and became highly subsidized by State funds. Portucel Soporcel remained well after the privatization of the company to Semapa in 2004, as one of the largest beneficiaries of state business grants and incentives due to its strategic interest for both Portugal's exportation and local eucalyptus economies.\n\nPortucel began operations at the Cacia mill in 1953 producing raw pine pulp, and became a pioneer worldwide in 1957 when it introduced sulphate bleached eucalyptus pulp, at the kraft process, into its production.\n\nIn 1967, at the Setúbal mill, Inapa began its operations in a production unit integrated with Portucel, transforming pulp into paper that was sold throughout Europe.\n\nPortucel bought Papéis Inapa in 2000, thus creating a strategic partnership of great importance in initiating the restructuring process of the pulp and the paper sector in Portugal. With the takeover of Soporcel in 2001, Portucel rebranded itself the Portucel Soporcel Group.\n\nThe Soporcel factory in Figueira da Foz, Portugal, was initially intended to be built in the Portuguese territory of Angola, by then an overseas province of Portugal. Due to the Carnation Revolution in Lisbon on 25 April 1974, the project which included both forestation and construction of industrial facilities in Angola, was delayed and changed. The factory would be installed some years later, in Portugal. Although it began operations in 1984 with the inauguration of the mill at Figueira da Foz, Soporcel had been constituted five years earlier. The first paper machine (PM I) began working in the year 1991, and currently has a capacity of 350,000 tonnes/year.\n\nThe installation of the second paper machine (PM II – 425,000 tonnes/year), representing the most advanced technology in the sector, reinforced the position held by the Figueira da Foz mill in the European segment of the uncoated woodfree paper market.\n\nSoporcel was acquired by Portucel in 2001, creating the Portucel Soporcel Group.\n\nThe group's production structure is based at three mills, situated at Setúbal, Figueira da Foz, and Cacia.\n\nThe brand Navigator is produced by the group. The Portucel Soporcel Group is responsible for woodland assets in Portugal, totaling approximately 120 thousand hectares. This land is managed in accordance with the principles set out in the group's Forestry Policy. The eucalyptus, more specifically the \"Eucalyptus globulus\" species, which is considered at world level to provide the ideal fibre for the production of high-quality papers, occupies 74% of this area. Due to this role, it is a well known wine, honey, seeds and specific tree (besides eucalyptus which is its main cultivar) producer. It has a well-equipped private fire department to prevent fires within its forests.\n\nBesides its woodland assets and plants in Portugal, Portucel has developing since 2010 forestation and industrial projects abroad. It studied extensive forestry and industrial investments in Uruguay, Brazil, and Angola, but chose Mozambique for the effect.\n"}

As tubal infertility is a common cause of infertility, tuboplasties were commonly performed prior to the development of effective in vitro fertilization (IVF). Or repair of any type of tube-like structure, including the Eustachian tube in the head & neck.\n\nDifferent types of tuboplasty can be distinguished:.\n\nAbove surgical procedures are performed through either a laparotomy or laparoscopy approach. \nTechniques include the use of microsurgery, laser, electrocautery, hydrodissection, mechanical dissection, and use of surgical stents, hoods, adhesions barriers, and more.\n\nResults depend on the underlying pathology and the skill of the surgeon. Pregnancy rates may range from 0-48% (Rock, 1985)\n\nEctopic pregnancy is a complication after a tuboplasty. It may require a salpingectomy (removal of a tube).\n\nSchroder is credited to have performed the first tuboplasty when he created an ampullary cuff and thus reopened an occluded tube in 1884. The first postoperative pregnancy was reported by Martin in 1891, however it aborted. For about a century tuboplastic procedures were the main approach to correct tubal infertility situations. With the development of IVF technology, IVF has increasingly supplanted tuboplasty as a treatment for tubal infertility.\n\n"}
{"id": "2057912", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2057912", "title": "Dante Lavelli", "text": "Dante Lavelli\n\nDante Bert Joseph \"Gluefingers\" Lavelli (February 23, 1923 – January 20, 2009) was an American football end who played for the Cleveland Browns in the All-America Football Conference (AAFC) and National Football League (NFL) from 1946 to 1956. Starring alongside quarterback Otto Graham, fullback Marion Motley, placekicker Lou Groza and fellow receiver Mac Speedie, Lavelli was an integral part of a Browns team that won seven championships during his 11-season career. Lavelli was known for his sure hands and improvisations on the field. He was also renowned for making catches in critical situations, earning the nickname \"Mr. Clutch\". \"Lavelli had one of the strongest pairs of hands I've ever seen,\" Browns coach Paul Brown once said of him. \"When he went up for a pass with a defender, you could almost always count on him coming back down with the ball.\"\n\nLavelli grew up in Hudson, Ohio and played football, baseball and basketball at his local high school. After graduating, he enrolled at Ohio State University, where he played only a handful of games before he was drafted for service in the U.S. Army during World War II. Returning in 1945 after serving in Europe, he joined the Browns in the team's first-ever season in the AAFC. Helped by Lavelli's play, the Browns won each of the AAFC's championships before the league dissolved in 1949 and the team was absorbed by the NFL. Cleveland continued to succeed in the NFL, winning championships in 1950, 1954 and 1955. Lavelli, who helped found the National Football League Players Association toward the end of his career, retired after the 1956 season.\n\nAfter retiring from football, Lavelli held a variety of coaching and scouting jobs and was active in NFL alumni affairs. He also ran a furniture store in Rocky River, Ohio. He was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1975. He died in a Cleveland hospital in 2009.\n\nLavelli was born and grew up in Hudson, Ohio, a small town in the northeastern part of the state. Both of his parents were Italian immigrants. His father Angelo Lavelli was a blacksmith who made shoes for horses on nearby farms. As a child, he practiced catching by throwing baseballs against walls and trying to catch them when they bounced back. He liked to have friends throw ping-pong balls at him to see if he could catch them.\n\nLavelli was a standout as a running back at Hudson High School and developed a reliable set of hands. Lavelli's Hudson High Explorers football team had three undefeated seasons and won three county championships. He also played baseball and basketball in high school.\n\nNotre Dame offered Lavelli a scholarship, and he committed to attend the school. After he had a chance encounter with Eddie Prokop, however, an able running back who was a fifth-string player for Notre Dame, Lavelli was convinced to look elsewhere. \"If Eddie Prokop were a fifth-string player, I was not one to sit on anyone's bench,\" he later said. Lavelli enrolled at Ohio State University in 1941 after learning that Paul Brown was appointed the football team's new head coach. Brown had developed a sterling reputation as the high school coach at Massillon Washington High School in Massillon, Ohio, losing only eight games in nine years there. Lavelli's catching ability had made him a star infielder in high school, and the Detroit Tigers of Major League Baseball recruited him to play second base in the low minor leagues. He refused the invitation, opting to concentrate on football.\n\nOn arrival at Ohio State, Lavelli roomed with Les Horvath and Don McCafferty and played on the freshman team under coach Trevor Rees. Brown switched Lavelli to end (the position is now called wide receiver). His playing time with the football team was limited, however, due to injury. He became a first-string end as a sophomore in 1942, but was ailing from a charley horse in his thigh and sat out the first game of the season against a Fort Knox military team. He had recovered by the third game of the season and started in a game against Southern California. Lavelli was hit in the knee while grabbing for a pass near the end of the game, however, and broke a bone. He was sidelined for the rest of the season. The Buckeyes won the college football national championship that year.\n\nAfter the 1942 season, Lavelli was drafted by the U.S. Army as American involvement in World War II intensified. After basic training and a number of other specialized courses on land-sea assaults, he was sent with the 28th Infantry Division to fight in the European Theatre of World War II. There his division landed on Omaha Beach, part of the Allied invasion of Germany-occupied France in 1944. He was involved with American forces in Germany's Battle of the Bulge offensive and in the Siege of Bastogne later the same year. One in five members of his division was killed in battle.\n\nAfter returning from the war, Lavelli was again offered a chance to play baseball with the Tigers. He saw a matchup in late 1945 between the National Football League's New York Giants and Washington Redskins and noticed that a former teammate at Ohio State named Sam Fox was an end for the Giants. \"I thought if he could make the grade, so could I,\" Lavelli later said. When Paul Brown offered him a chance to play on a new professional team he was coaching in the All-America Football Conference (AAFC) in 1946, Lavelli jumped at the opportunity. He was given a $500 bonus ($ in today's dollars) for signing with the team, called the Cleveland Browns.\n\nLavelli attended the Browns' first training camp in 1946. Competition was fierce for a spot on the roster, but Lavelli was one of the men who made it. He was up against a number of National Football League veterans and former college stars. \"The toughest game I ever played in was the first intrasquad scrimmage game,\" he said later. \"Nobody talked to each other for two days.\" He joined an offense that featured quarterback Otto Graham, fullback Marion Motley, placekicker Lou Groza and fellow end Mac Speedie. Lavelli quickly became Graham's top passing target and led the AAFC in receiving as a rookie with 40 receptions and 843 yards. The Browns made it to the league championship that season, and Lavelli caught the game-winning touchdown in a 14–9 victory over the AAFC's New York Yankees. The victory \"didn't mean so much then, but as time goes on, it builds,\" Lavelli said in 2008.\n\nThe Browns won the AAFC championship again in 1947. Lavelli finished second in the league in receiving behind his teammate Speedie. Both Lavelli and Speedie were named to all-AAFC teams, as they had been in 1946. Lavelli broke his leg in a preseason game in 1948 and sat out seven weeks. He came back later in the year and helped Cleveland finish a perfect season, catching a touchdown pass in a 31–21 win over the AAFC's Brooklyn Dodgers in the championship game. In a game against the Los Angeles Dons the following year, Lavelli caught four touchdowns and had 209 receiving yards, an AAFC record. In 1949 Cleveland won the AAFC championship for the fourth year in a row. The AAFC dissolved before the 1950 season and three of its teams, including the Browns, were absorbed by the more established National Football League (NFL). Lavelli was the AAFC's all-time leader in yards per catch and second in receiving yards behind Speedie.\n\nAs the Browns won in the AAFC, Lavelli continued his studies at Ohio State between seasons and got his degree in 1949. He married Joy Wright of Brecksville, Ohio that year.\n\nWhen Cleveland entered the NFL in 1950, questions lingered about whether the team could sustain its early dominance. The Browns, however, began the season by beating the defending NFL champions, the Philadelphia Eagles. Dante Lavelli recalls, \"The game I'll never forget is the first game we played in the National Football League. We beat the Philadelphia Eagles, 35-10. We went back to Cleveland the next day and waiting for us was something else we could be proud of. The press has asked Bert Bell, commissioner of the NFL, what he thought of the game. 'The Browns are the greatest football club I ever saw,' he said.\" \n\nThe team finished with a 10–2 regular-season record and reached the championship game after winning a playoff game against the New York Giants. In the championship against the Los Angeles Rams, Lavelli caught 11 passes – then a record for a title game – and had two touchdown receptions. The Browns won the game 30–28.\n\nCleveland reached the NFL championship game the following year but lost to the Rams. The 1952 and 1953 seasons followed a similar pattern: the Browns made it to the championship game but lost both times to the Detroit Lions. Lavelli was named to the Pro Bowl in 1951 and 1953. He was seventh in the NFL in receiving yards in 1951, with 586. He gained 783 receiving yards in 1953, the fifth-highest total in the league.\n\nOver the years, Lavelli developed a reputation for making big plays when they counted most, as he had done with his touchdown reception in the Browns' first championship game in 1946. He was nicknamed \"Mr. Clutch\" in a Pittsburgh Steelers scouting report, although \"Gluefingers\" – a name bestowed upon him by Browns announcer Bob Neal – was more widely used. He practiced with Graham tirelessly to refine routes and was not afraid to run over the middle, where he risked a pounding from defenders when the ball came his way. \"Dante was the greatest guy at catching a ball in a crowd that I have ever seen,\" Brown once said. Among other innovations, he and Graham also mastered sideline patterns at a time when few teams used them.\n\nThe Browns won another championship in 1954, thanks in part to a strong regular-season performance from Lavelli. Lavelli led the team in receiving that year and made the Pro Bowl after the Browns beat the Lions for their second NFL title. A third NFL championship followed in 1955. In the championship game against the Rams, Lavelli caught a touchdown in the second quarter and scored a second time on a 50-yard pass just before the end of the first half. The Browns won 38–14.\n\nLavelli initially planned to retire in 1955 but came back for a final year in 1956, when the Browns posted a 5–7 record, the team's first-ever losing season. In his 11-year career, Lavelli caught 386 passes for 6,488 yards and 62 touchdowns. He was a confident receiver, former teammates said in later years. He could often be heard calling for Graham to throw him the ball while running routes. He was also known for his ability to improvise on the field. In a 1955 game against the Eagles in slippery conditions, he caught the winning touchdown with less than a minute left by swinging around the goalpost with his arm to get open.\n\nDuring his Browns career, Lavelli was involved in the creation of the National Football League Players Association. The concept of a union to represent players in league matters was hatched in Lavelli's basement in 1954. Lavelli and two teammates, Abe Gibron and George Ratterman, met every Wednesday to discuss the union. They approached Creighton Miller, a Cleveland lawyer and former Notre Dame star who had worked briefly as an assistant coach with the Browns, for help. The union was founded at a meeting before the NFL championship game in 1956. The following year, the players got $50 per exhibition game, a $5,000 minimum salary, injury pay and medical care. The union is now the primary representative of players in labor negotiations and disputes with the NFL.\n\nAfter retiring from football, Lavelli ran an appliance business on Cleveland's west side. From 1961 through 1963, he served as an assistant to Graham, who was coaching college stars in the annual College All-Star Game. Lavelli was also an assistant coach with the Browns and a scout for the Chicago Bears. He later owned a furniture store in Rocky River, Ohio and had an interest in two bowling alleys. He had a hand in founding the NFL Alumni Association, a charitable organization.\n\nLavelli was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1975, joining former teammates Graham, Motley and Groza and coach Paul Brown. Later in life, he golfed and attended NFL alumni events and lobbied to get the NFL to recognize his and other players' AAFC statistics. The NFL refused to incorporate AAFC statistics into its own when the league dissolved and the Browns became part of the NFL, in contrast to the NFL's recognition of statistics from the American Football League (AFL) following the AFL-NFL merger. Lavelli called it a \"double standard\". He died in 2009 at 85 at Fairview Hospital in Cleveland of congestive heart failure and bladder and kidney infections and is buried in St. Mary's Cemetery, Hudson, OH. He and his wife Joy had three children, Lucinda, Edward and Lisa; as well as four grandchildren, Aaron, Noah, Luke and Danielle. Hudson High's stadium is named in honor of him.\n\nThe Akron Community Foundation established a Dante Lavelli Scholarship Fund in 2010 to help Hudson High athletes pay for college. \"He was one of the best I’d ever seen,\" Willie Davis, a defensive end who played for the Browns shortly after Lavelli retired, said. \"He set the mold with his running patterns and catching the ball.\" After Lavelli died, Graham praised his abilities and remembered his eagerness to get his hands on the ball. \"He was always coming into the huddle and telling me he was open and that I should throw to him,\" Graham said. \"He wasn't saying that to be a big shot. He just loved to play. If he was open by a few inches, he'd be yelling, 'Otto, Otto.'

He has written or edited several books on economics, ecology, and biotechnology.\n\nBailey was born in San Antonio, Texas, and raised in Washington County, Virginia. He lives in Washington, D.C., and Charlottesville, Virginia, with his wife Pamela.\n\nBailey attended the University of Virginia, where he earned a B.A. in philosophy and economics in 1976. He worked briefly as an economist for the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. From 1987 to 1990 he contributed articles to Forbes. Bailey worked as a reporter for \"The Tico Times\" in San José, Costa Rica during 1990 and 1991. His articles and reviews have appeared in national newspapers and magazines and have been selected for inclusion in The Best American Science Writing anthology series. Bailey was the founding producer of the PBS series Think Tank and has produced or co-produced several series and documentaries for PBS television and ABC News. Since 1997 he has been a science correspondent for \"Reason\" magazine. Bailey was the 1993 Warren T. Brookes Fellow in Environmental Journalism at the Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI).\n\nHe has lectured at Harvard University, Rutgers University, McGill University, University of Alaska, Université du Québec, the Cato Institute, the Instituto de Libertad y Desarrollo (Chile), and the American Enterprise Institute. A column he wrote in 2004, \"The battle for your brain\" received a Southern California Journalism award from the Los Angeles Press Club and was included in the book, \"The Best of American Science and Nature Writing 2004\". Bailey testified before a congressional sub-committee in 2004 on, \"The Impact of Science on Public Policy.\" In 2006 he was on the shortlist of nominees of \"personalities who have made the most significant contributions to biotech in the last ten years\" compiled by the editors of Nature Biotechnology.\n\nIn 1989, in an article in \"Forbes\", Bailey wrote a \"...sneering attack ...\" on Jay Forrester, the father of system dynamics. In the article he described the book, \"The Limits to Growth\" (LTG) as \"as wrong-headed as it is possible to be.\" Bailey said that, \"\"Limits to Growth\" predicted that at 1972 rates of growth the world would run out of gold by 1981, mercury by 1985, tin by 1987, zinc by 1990, petroleum by 1992, copper, lead and natural gas by 1993.\" According to physical chemist and energy expert, Ugo Bardi, \"...Bailey's accusations are just plain wrong.\" In 1993 Bailey repeated his accusations in his book, \"Ecoscam\". In it, he claimed that none of the projections of the 1972 \"LTG\" study turned out to be correct.\n\nIn his 1993 book, \"Ecoscam\", Bailey wrote, \"Despite a great deal of continuing scientific uncertainty, it appears that CFCs do contribute to the creation of the Antarctic ozone hole and perhaps a tiny amount of global ozone depletion. ... [I]t makes sense to phase out the use of CFCs.\" When \"Science\" reported in July 2016 that the ozone layer was restoring itself after CFCs were banned, Bailey wrote, \"Since atmospheric pollution presents significant barriers to assigning property rights, I concluded that the international treaty banning CFCs was the appropriate response.\"\n\nThe position taken in his 1995 book \"The True State of the Planet\" has been described as \"growth forever\" or \"Promethean\" arguing for unrestrained exploitation based on assumptions of unending nature, value derived exclusively from man's changes to material, and exceptional human resourcefulness. His follow-up book \"Earth Report 2000\" was recognized for being among the works of established authors \"who have argued that past and present widely accepted visions of environmental deterioration and disaster ... have little or no basis in fact.\" Citing these two books, Holt, Pressman and Spash describe the CEI as believing, \"technology will solve all environmental problems and that present environmental dilemmas are simply a necessary outcome of much needed economic growth.\"\n\nBailey has described himself as a \"libertarian transhumanist.\" He explains this in his book \"Liberation Biology\".\n\nIn 2005, Bailey said that new data convinced him that the earth is definitely warming and that the likely cause is human activity. He has endorsed a carbon tax as one possible solution. He has stated in the article \"Global Warming — Not Worse Than We Thought, But Bad Enough\":\n\nDetails like sea level rise will continue to be debated by researchers, but if the debate over whether or not humanity is contributing to global warming wasn't over before, it is now ... as the new IPCC Summary makes clear, climate change Pollyannaism is no longer looking very tenable.\n\nBailey is critical of Al Gore and his film about global warming, writing, \"On balance Gore gets it more right than wrong on the science (we'll leave the policy stuff to another time), but he undercuts his message by becoming the opposite of a global warming denier. He's a global warming exaggerator.\"\n\nBailey voted for George W. Bush in both 2000 and 2004, a fact which he later wrote made him \"disheartened and ashamed.\" In 2008, he voted for Barack Obama because he felt that \"[t]he Republicans must be punished and punished hard.\"\n\n\n\n"}

The UK edition retailed at seven shillings and sixpence (7/6) and the US edition at $2.00.\n\nIt is the first novel to feature the character of Miss Marple and her village of St Mary Mead. This first look at St Mary Mead led a reviewer in 1990 to ask why these are called cosy mysteries: \"Our first glimpse of St Mary Mead, a hotbed of burglary, impersonation, adultery and ultimately murder. What is it precisely that people find so cosy about such stories?\"\n\nThe character had previously appeared in short stories published in magazines starting in December 1927. These earlier stories were collected in book form in \"The Thirteen Problems\" in 1932.\n\nColonel Lucius Protheroe is wealthy, active in the church and a magistrate. Yet almost no one in his village, St Mary Mead, likes him; the vicar, Rev. Leonard Clement, endures his public insults while setting up an evening meeting to discuss irregularities in the accounts, and Protheroe's 16 year old daughter Lettice cannot bear him. Both express a wish for him to die, out of frustration with him. Clement sees Mrs Anne Protheroe in tight embrace with Lawrence Redding, clearly tired of her husband. That evening, the Colonel is found murdered in the Vicar's study.\n\nVicar Clement is called away to a home two miles distant. He walks there and back, learning that they had not called him. He is late for the meeting with Protheroe, set for 6:15 pm. He meets Redding, who is leaving the vicarage. Upon entering the study, he finds Protheroe bent over at the desk, shot in the head, dead. He calls Dr Haydock, who arrives at 6:55 and estimates time of death as 30 minutes earlier. Dr Haydock calls the police. A note is found beneath the corpse, along with the Vicar's clock. The note is marked with a time of 6:20 pm and the clock is set to 6:22. The note is odd, saying I can no longer wait for you, though it was made clear to Protheroe upon his arrival that the vicar would not arrive before 6:30 and Protheroe seemed perfectly willing to wait at the time.\nNews spreads quickly in St Mary Mead. No one, including Miss Jane Marple outdoors in her garden, hears a shot from the study. Several in the village did hear an odd sort of shot from the woods, but later than 6:25. Inspector Slack and Chief Constable Melchett arrive to inspect the scene and search for clues. The inspector is thorough, but not quite as thorough as Miss Marple in gathering information and making sense of it. The Inspector scorns the older women in the village, single or widowed, despite their observant ways. Rather soon, two people confess to the murder. Lawrence Redding, the artist who uses a building on the vicarage property as his studio, confesses to the crime. The police do not believe him. Next, Mrs Anne Protheroe confesses to committing the murder. Nor is she believed, because others saw her outdoors. Other possible suspects include Archer, a man treated harshly by Protheroe for poaching; Mrs Lestrange, who appeared recently in the village and sees only Dr Haydock. The other outsider is Dr Stone, an archaeologist and his assistant, Gladys Cram, who are working at a site on the Protheroe estate. Miss Marple has a list of seven in her mind.\n\nMiss Marple sees Miss Cram carrying a suitcase into the woods at midnight, and Clement later finds the suitcase. Miss Marple's nephew Raymond West has met Stone and does not recognize the man claiming to be him. In the suitcase is valuable silver belonging to the Protheroes. Slack learns that Stone is not an archeologist but a thief with a long record.\nMiss Marple compares people in new situations with people she has observed in village life, and then thinks out what is really happening, never relying of what people say, but on what she can verify. The Vicar respects her intelligence. Clement is interested to find the murderer, as is Miss Marple, as are the police. The police send the note to a specialist, who says that it was not written by Protheroe.\n\nMelchett shares this news with Clement. Clement and Melchett proceed to Curate Hawes’ rooms because of a phone call of confession. Hawes is barely alive, and has received the actual note written by Protheroe from Redding on the previous evening, which accuses Hawes of stealing funds from the church. Dr Haydock saves Hawes' life; Redding had substituted a dangerous drug in place of the usual medication, hoping Hawes, dead, would appear as the murderer, and that is what Melchett and Clement believe. Miss Marple arrives at Hawes' rooms, because the local phone operator first mistakenly connects Melchett's call to Haydock to her phone before making the connection correctly. She is glad that Hawes will survive and then explains who the murderer is. Melchett is unwilling to believe her; at the end, he knows she is right. No one heard a shot because a silencer was used on the pistol owned by Redding. Redding places the pistol with silencer in a potted plant when he visits Clement earlier in the afternoon. Anne Protheroe then shoots her husband at 6:25 after walking past Miss Marple and showing how she carried no purse, no gun. Then Anne meets up with Redding, and both are seen in public by 6:30 pm. Redding returns to the vicarage just before Clement returns, removing the pistol and actual note, and placing the misleading note. Miss Marple sees Redding as a handsome man with many talents, and ruthless, wanting marriage only with a wife who brought wealth. A hint is dropped that someone saw Redding switch the medication for poor Hawes. Redding met with Anne at night outside her home, where the police overheard their conversation and used the facts to bring the pair to trial.\nLettice explains that Mrs Lestrange is her mother, the first wife of Protheroe, who deserted him. She is mortally ill and wants to be near her daughter.\n\n\nReviews at the time of publication were generally positive about Miss Marple, dubious about the how the murder happened, but pleased at Christie's writing style. A later review finds the story more to the taste of 1990, and likes the village and its people. The author, looking back on her own work in her autobiography in the 1970s, thought her main plot \"sound\", but perhaps there were too many characters and subplots.\n\nThe \"Times Literary Supplement\" of 6 November 1930 posed the various questions as to who could have killed Protheroe and why, and concluded, \"As a detective story, the only fault of this one is that it is hard to believe the culprit could kill Prothero [\"sic\"] so quickly and quietly. The three plans of the room, garden, and village show that almost within sight and hearing was Miss Marple, who 'always knew every single thing that happened and drew the worst inferences.' And three other 'Parish cats' (admirably portrayed) were in the next three houses. It is Miss Marple who does detect the murderer in the end, but one suspects she would have done it sooner in reality\".\n\nThe review of the novel in \"The New York Times Book Review\" of 30 November 1930 begins, \"The talented Miss Christie is far from being at her best in her latest mystery story. It will add little to her eminence in the field of detective fiction.\" The review went on to say that, \"the local sisterhood of spinsters is introduced with much gossip and click-clack. A bit of this goes a long way and the average reader is apt to grow weary of it all, particularly of the amiable Miss Marple, who is sleuth-in-chief of the affair.\" The reviewer summarised the set-up of the plot and concluded, \"The solution is a distinct anti-climax.\"\n\nH C O'Neill in \"The Observer\" of 12 December 1930 said that, \"here is a straightforward story which very pleasantly draws a number of red herrings across the docile reader's path. There is a distinct originality in her new expedient for keeping the secret. She discloses it at the outset, turns it inside out, apparently proves that the solution cannot be true, and so produces an atmosphere of bewilderment.\"\n\nIn the \"Daily Express\" of 16 October 1930 Harold Nicolson said, \"I have read better works by Agatha Christie, but that does not mean that this last book is not more cheerful, more amusing, and more seductive than the generality of detective novels.\" In a short review dated 15 October 1930, the \"Daily Mirror\" review declared, \"Bafflement is well sustained.\"\n\nRobert Barnard wrote sixty years later that this is \"Our first glimpse of St Mary Mead, a hotbed of burglary, impersonation, adultery and ultimately murder. What is it precisely that people find so cosy about such stories?\" He found the resolution a bit hard to believe, yet the story is more appealing to readers of 1990 than to those in 1930. \"The solution boggles the mind somewhat, but there are too many incidental pleasures to complain, and the strong dose of vinegar in this first sketch of Miss Marple is more to modern taste than the touch of syrup in later presentations.\"\n\nChristie herself later wrote: \"Reading \"Murder at the Vicarage\" now, I am not so pleased with it as I was at the time. It has, I think, far too many characters, and too many sub-plots. But at any rate the \"main\" plot is sound.\"\n\nIn a discussion with J K Rowling in 2014, author Val McDermid remarked that \"The Murder at the Vicarage\" is the book that got her interested in detective stories; she described the humour in that novel and said that Christie did not get enough credit for the humour in her detective mysteries. McDermid quoted from the descriptions of the four women in the village, particularly “Miss Hartnell who was feared by the poor”, for its humour and the terse description that conveyed so much.\n\nThe Vicar and his wife, Leonard and Griselda Clement, who made their first appearance in this novel, continue to show up in Miss Marple stories. Notably, they feature in \"The Body in the Library\" (1942) along with Slack and Melchett, and \"4.50 from Paddington\" (1957).\n\nThe character of Miss Marple had previously appeared in short stories published in magazines starting in December 1927. These earlier stories were collected in book form in \"The Thirteen Problems\" in 1932.\n\nThe story was adapted into a play by Moie Charles and Barbara Toy in 1949 and opened at the Playhouse Theatre on 16 December 1949. Miss Marple was played by Barbara Mullen.\n\nThe BBC adapted the book into a film on 25 December 1986, with Joan Hickson as Miss Marple, Paul Eddington as the vicar, and Polly Adams as Anne Protheroe. The adaptation was generally very close to the original novel with four major exceptions: the trap which exposes the killer is changed to involve another murder attempt, the characters of Dennis, Dr. Stone, and Gladys Cram were deleted, Bill Archer is present in the kitchen while the murder takes place, and Anne commits suicide out of remorse instead of being tried.\n\nIt was presented again on the ITV series \"Agatha Christie's Marple\" by Granada Television in 2004 with Geraldine McEwan as Miss Marple, Tim McInnerny as the vicar, Derek Jacobi as Colonel Protheroe, and Janet McTeer as Anne. This version eliminates the characters of Dr. Stone and Gladys Cram, replacing them with the elderly French Professor Dufosse and his granddaughter Hélène.\n\nOther changes include the elimination of Miss Weatherby, the changing of Mrs. Price-Ridley's first name from Martha to Marjorie, the renaming of Bill Archer to Frank Tarrent, and the addition of a plotline in which the Colonel stole 10,000 francs from the French Resistance, which led to the death of an agent.\n\nTwo major departures from the book are the portrayal of Miss Marple as Anne's close friend and the addition of a series of flashbacks to December 1915, when a younger Miss Marple was engaged in a forbidden love affair with a married soldier.\n\nIn both versions, the vicar's role is reduced and he does not participate in the investigation since his presence as the narrator was unnecessary in a filmed version.\n\n\"The Murder at the Vicarage\" was released by HarperCollins as a graphic novel adaptation on 20 May 2008, adapted and illustrated by \"Norma\" (Norbert Morandière) (). This was translated from the edition first published in France by in 2005 under the title of \"L'Affaire Prothéroe\".\n\n\nThe novel was first serialised in the US in the \"Chicago Tribune\" in fifty-five instalments from Monday, 18 August to Monday, 20 October 1930.\n\nThe dedication of the book reads:\n\"To Rosalind\"\n\nThe subject of this dedication is Christie's daughter, Rosalind Hicks (1919–2004) who was the daughter of her first marriage to Archibald Christie (1890–1962) and Agatha Christie's only child. Rosalind was eleven years of age at the time of the publication of this book.\n\n"}
{"id": "2057944", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2057944", "title": "Étienne Polverel", "text": "Étienne Polverel\n\nÉtienne Polverel (1740–1795) was a French lawyer, aristocrat, and revolutionary. He was a member of the Jacobin club. In 1792, he and Léger Félicité Sonthonax were sent to Saint-Domingue to suppress a slave revolt. Polverel was an abolitionist and after a few years he had emancipated the slaves of the colony and given them political equality.\n\nBorn in Bearn, Polverel served as syndic for the region, and he was hired as a jurist by the Estates of Navarre to represent and defend the independence of the kingdom before the \"Parlement\" of Paris.\n\nÉtienne Polverel came from a wealthy, aristocratic background. By profession he was a lawyer. Polverel was also a Freemason and a member of the Jacobin Club. Some of the members in his Masonic lodge in Bordeaux were free blacks from Saint-Domingue, so he had early contacts with them before being sent to the colony on September 17, 1792.\n\nPolverel was sent to Saint-Domingue along with Leger Felicite Sonthonax to enforce a law passed on April 4, 1792, which decreed that free blacks and whites in the colony were to have equal rights. Jacques Pierre Brissot, a prominent abolitionist at the time, lobbied for them to be sent and ensured that they were. The rights that were then denied to free blacks were the franchise and the right to hold office in the Colonial Assembly (the legislative body that ran internal affairs in the colony). The Assembly was at the time run only by whites. About 10,000 French troops went with Polverel and Sonthonax to help enforce the April 4th decree.\n\nIn 1795, after issuing emancipation proclamations in Saint-Domingue, Polverel was recalled to France. The National Convention had passed its own abolition of slavery, which vindicated Polverel and Sonthonax. However, plantation owners in France were furious with Polverel for having done so, so they put him on trial once he returned to France. The Committee of Public Safety (Comité de Salut public) deliberated for a few months on what to do about Sonthonax and Polverel, but Polverel got sick and died before a verdict on his fate was reached.\n\nLike many Jacobins, Polverel was a fervent supporter of the Revolution and its ideals. He was also a nationalist. Polverel was primarily committed to upholding the laws of the French assembly. In the Jacobin view, those who dissented from passed laws were not in the opposition, they were counter-revolutionaries to be dealt with harshly. Polverel seemed to have agreed with this view.\n\nFollowing the French Revolution in 1789, Polverel began contributing to radical newspapers where he published articles against slavery. So ardent was his opposition to slavery that on one occasion he attempted to remove some pro-slavery members of the Jacobin club because of their views. The Revolution, thought Polverel, had no room for pro-slavery sentiments.\n\nDespite his personal opposition to slavery Polverel put the laws of the France first. When he and Sonthonax arrived in Saint-Domingue, one of their first acts was to issue a proclamation declaring that they had arrived to save slavery, not abolish it.\n\nSaint-Domingue was probably the wealthiest colony in the world up until 1789. Rich whites held the best land, and mostly used it to grow sugar cane. Less profitable land was used to grow coffee, and both free blacks and whites owned coffee plantations. Coffee and sugar plantations produced tremendous wealth for France and its colonies, but the slave-laborers could not enjoy the fruits of their labor because they had few, if any, rights.\n\nThe Haitian Revolution of 1790 did not begin merely as a slave uprising. Instead, it was the combined result of two simultaneous though unrelated revolts. First, the free blacks of Saint-Domingue began an armed rebellion to gain equal rights with the white settlers. Although free blacks and colonial whites mingled and had generally decent relations, the whites held on to all political power and were willing to use violence to maintain it. The problem of the white colonists had to be settled before the matter of slavery. But even the whites were not totally unified: poor whites resented the wealth and influence of the rich plantation owners, and the wealthy were fearful of having their property stolen.\n\nSecond, the slaves revolted for various reasons. Some wanted to gain their immediate freedom, others fought for improved conditions on the plantations. For example, some slaves had heard that King Louis XVI was going to allow them to freely work for three days out of the week. While the truth of this statement from the King was disputed, it nevertheless encouraged some slaves to join the revolt so as to gain the rights allegedly promised to them.\n\nThe situation in the colony was therefore extremely precarious and needed careful handling.\n\nPolverel arrived in Le Cap aboard the \"America\" as a Civil Commissioner to Saint-Domingue on 17 September 1792, along with Sonthonax and Jean-Antoine Ailhaud. He was given charge of Ouest, and when Ailhaud abandoned his post, Polverel took responsibility for Sud province as well.\n\nWhen Sonthonax and Polverel first arrived in Saint-Domingue, they were met with hostility by the white settlers. Because the whites feared that Polverel came to abolish slavery, few of them supported the civil commissioners' mission, so Polverel turned to the free blacks for support. The free blacks proved to be the only reliable group that Poverel could ally with.\n\nOn May 5, 1793, Polverel issued a proclamation which demanded enforcement of the Code Noir. The Code Noir was a series of laws which stated that slaves must be treated with respect and not abused. Although passed in 1685, the Code Noir was never respected by the white colonists, who routinely abused the slaves. Polverel's proclamation on May 5 stated that slaves must be given basic provisions and small plots of land for them to manage. To ensure enforcement, the proclamation was translated to Creole and read aloud on all slave plantations. This would ensure that slaves would become aware of their new protections.\n\nShortly after the proclamation was issued, a new governor arrived in Le Cap, Saint-Domingue. His name was François-Thomas Galbaud du Fort. He owned property in the colony and hoped to preserve the slave system. For these reasons, he distrusted and even hated Polverel and Sonthonax. Galbaud insulted the civil commissioners, and his pro-slavery rhetoric was supported by many of Le Cap's whites. Sonthonax and Polverel returned to Le Cap (they were in different regions of Saint-Domingue) and imprisoned Galbaud in a ship because of his defiant behavior.\n\nGalbaud, however, enjoyed support from the sailors then anchored near the ship and from other whites in the city. On June 20, 1793, Galbaud managed to escape and attack Le Cap, aiming to capture Sonthonax and Polverel. The commissioners, massively outnumbered, escaped to the outskirts of the city. Galbaud's followers rampaged through the city, and fires burnt much of it to the ground. To recapture the city, Polverel and Sonthonax issued a statement saying that all blacks who would join them and fight against Galbaud would be granted French citizenship. Some of the slaves who were revolting answered their call, as did many freed blacks. Some white troops also remained loyal to Polverel. With the combined efforts of these three groups, Polverel returned to Le Cap, defeated Galbaud, and took control of the city.\n\nBy this time, Spain and Britain had declared war on France. White colonists in Saint-Domingue had already signed an alliance with the British who would aid them in putting down the slave insurrection. Both of these empires wanted Saint-Domingue, especially Spain, which had a colony on the same island. To combat the French and Spanish threat, Polverel needed to gather even more support to preserve French rule in Saint-Domingue. In August 1793, Polverel and Sonthonax issued general emancipation for all blacks born in France's colonies, including for their families. Polverel followed that proclamation with another in October, which stated that all blacks were to be French citizens and enjoy full and complete equality. Following emancipation, though, Polverel hoped to provide one more incentive for the blacks to fight for the French Republic. He therefore decreed that blacks were to be given exclusive rights over land in a year's time. He also passed other laws on post-slave labor, including a requirement that freed slaves continue to work on their plantations for one year following the decree. This finally won over the remaining blacks who were not loyal to the Republican government, and they joined together to repel the incoming British and Spanish troops. The blacks of Haiti were not just freed but legally equal to whites.\n\n"}
{"id": "2057953", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2057953", "title": "Charles Philippe Leblond", "text": "Charles Philippe Leblond\n\nCharles Philippe Leblond, (February 5, 1910 – April 10, 2007) was a pioneer of cell biology and stem cell research and a Canadian former professor of anatomy. Leblond is notable for developing autoradiography and his work showing how cells continuously renew themselves, regardless of age.\n\nIn 1946, Leblond found that, when he poured liquid photographic emulsion on a histological section containing a radio element, the emulsion was eventually activated by the radio-element; and if thereafter routine photographic development and fixation were applied to the emulsion-covered section, black silver grains appeared in the emulsion wherever it overlay sites containing a radio-element. This liquid emulsion approach has been used to develop a new High Resolution Autoradiography procedure characterized by close contact between emulsion and section. Such close contact makes it possible to localize the radio-elements in the section at high resolution, so that radio-elements can be localized at high magnification in the light microscope.\n\nThis procedure has been utilized to examine some of the dynamic features of body components, with the main findings as follows:\n\n\nHis results threw doubt on the validity of three traditional concepts dear to biologists in the earlier part of the twentieth century: \"stability\" of the cell, in which the cell and its components are unchanging, permanent structures; \"specificity\" of cell function, in which each cell type has a distinct, unique function; and \"activity-rest alternation\" of cell function, in which each period of cellular activity is followed by a period during which the activity ceases.\n\nHe has proposed replacing cell \"specificity\" by \"multipotentiality\", \"activity-rest alternation\" by \"continuity\" and \"stability\" of cell components by \"renewal\". These various results have provided the foundation not only for modern stem cell research, but also for modern cell biology.\n\nAs Nobel laureate George Palade noted on the occasion of the 1992 Prix Marie-Victorin to Leblond, Charles Leblond's discoveries are so fundamental that they are taught in schools and colleges throughout the world.\n\nCP Leblond was born in Lille, France, in 1910, the son of a building contractor who died when Leblond was only 10 years old, leaving his mother to raise four boys on her own. A brilliant student, Leblond debated becoming a film producer, an architect or a scientist. In the end, he decided on science, and enrolled in Medicine at the University of Paris. He was fascinated by his first course in histology and decided to pursue this field as a career.\n\nLeblond obtained his M.D. degree from the University of Paris in 1934. His doctoral thesis described the histochemical localizion of ascorbic acid, which he found to predominate in steroid-secreting cells. This study led him, with a Rockefeller postdoctoral fellowship in hand, to the endocrinology-orientated Department of Anatomy at Yale University in 1935, where he carried out studies on factors influencing maternal behavior. It was here that he met his wife Gertrude Sternschuss, to whom he was married for 64 years. Leblond had 4 children for which he chose names starting with the letter \"P\": Philippe, Paul, Pierre and (Marie)-Pascale. He also had 7 grandchildren.\n\nIn 1937, Leblond joined the Laboratoire de Synthese Atomique in Paris which was involved in preparing radioactive isotopes for use in investigating the fate of various molecules in biological processes. Under the guidance of Antoine Lacassagne, Leblond injected radioiodine-128, into a rat and found that the label promptly accumulated in the thyroid gland, presumably incorporated into the thyroid hormone precursor thyroglobulin. To localize this label more precisely within the thyroid tissue, Leblond attempted to use the novel technique of autoradiography.\n\nUnfortunately, Leblond's first attempt to use autoradiography failed, the reason being that the radioiodine-128 isotope, with its extremely short half-life (25 minutes), disintegrated so quickly that too little radioactivity remained to be detected by the photographic emulsion.\n\nIn 1941, Leblond moved to McGill University as a lecturer in histology, and quickly rose to assistant (1943), associate (1946), and then full professor of anatomy (1948). He served as the chair of the Department of Anatomy from 1957–1974.\n\nAt McGill, Leblond used the newly-available radioiodine-131 with a half-life of 8 days, to repeat his autoradiographic experiment on thyroid tissue. With this method, the resolving power was less than 100 µm, but nonetheless he was able to localize the radioactivity to specific thyroid [follicles].\n\nLeblond's early career at McGill was interrupted by World War II, during which he served in the Free French Forces. He was dispatched first to Rio de Janeiro, then to London, where he conducted medical exams of would-be soldiers.\n\n\"In 1946, after returning to Montreal from service with the Free French Forces, it was clear to me that the crude technique previously used for radioautography had to be improved\". In collaboration with Leonard Bélanger, Leblond worked on increasing the resolution of the autoradiographic technique. They were advised by physicist Pierre Demers to melt the emulsion from Eastman Kodak lantern slides, paint it directly on the sections, and then develop the emulsion while it was still attached to the histologic sections. This resulted in a tenfold improvement in resolution. Subsequently, Leblond and his colleagues developed a technique in which the histologic slides were dipped directly into liquid emulsion. The use of thinner sections and emulsion coats led to further advances in resolution, and the introduction of tritium was a technical milestone.\n\nHigh Resolution Autoradiography procedure continues to be used today by molecular biologists to detect RNA molecules in situ, and to study the localization of genes and DNA sequences.\n\nLeblond used autoradiography to introduce radioactive precursors of DNA and then examine the renewal and fate of cells of several basic tissue types. He demonstrated for the first time that most cells and tissues in the adult body undergo continued renewal. Using mathematical models and modern methods of quantitation, Leblond and his colleagues estimated with remarkable accuracy the turnover and mitotic rates of numerous cell types. He and his colleagues made fascinating discoveries that resulted in the introduction of \"time dimension\" to cells and tissues, opening the doors to the understanding of the cell cycle and to the identification of stem cells.\n\nIn the male seminiferous epithelium, studies by Leblond and Yves Clermont in the early 1950s had deciphered how spermatogonia gave rise to spermatocytes, which then differentiated into mature sperm cells in a specific cycle.\n\nTo maintain the population of spermatogonia, the seminiferous epithelium was shown to contain a population of stem cells which divided to produce differentiated cells as well as to maintain their own number. As noted in a seminal publication by Leblond, \"the reappearance at each cycle of a new dormant cell which acts as the stem cell of spermatocytes is described as the 'Stem Cell Renewal Theory'\" . This article is the first one in which nests of cells dividing in an adult organ are designated as \"stem cells\".\n\nLeblond and his colleagues also found evidence for the presence of occasional adult stem cells even in tissues which are composed almost entirely of non-dividing cells. In skeletal muscle, the muscle fibers had been shown to exhibit an age-related increase in the number of nuclei. His studies showed that muscle satellite cells could be considered to be adult stem cells in muscle fibers.\n\nFrom the studies of Leblond and his colleagues, it was concluded that the body has three types of cell populations:\n\n\nTo mark his 65th birthday in 1975, Leblond was honored at an international symposium on the existence of stem cells in adult tissues; the resulting book, Stem Cells of Renewing Cell Populations, was the first formal, comprehensive account on the subject.\n\nWhen Leblond and his colleagues used 14C-bicarbonate, and then 35S-labeled amino acids to investigate protein synthesis, they were astonished to find that virtually all cells in the body incorporated label. This led them to the conclusion, considered heretical at the time, that all cells continually synthesized proteins. This was among the first evidence to replace the Specificity concept with the idea that most cells are multipotential in their functions.\n\nIt is of interest that autoradiographic studies by Leblond during this period also settled a controversy regarding the cellular site of synthesis of ribonucleic acid. Using radiolabeled cytidine in some forty cell types, he and his colleagues were the first to demonstrate decisively that RNA is continuously synthesized in the nucleus and then migrates to the cytoplasm.\n\nA majority of body proteins is glycosylated, although the proportion of carbohydrates in proteins is quite variable. Leblond had shown in earlier studies that the Golgi region in most cell types was dramatically stained by the periodic acid-Schiff staining technique, which is specially directed to carbohydrate-rich proteins carrying 1,2 glycols. In the electron microscope, using the periodic acid silver technique, there was a gradient of staining intensity from the cis to the trans side of the Golgi apparatus, suggesting that carbohydrate residues were added to proteins at this site.\n\nTo test this hypothesis, light and then EM autoradiographic studies were carried out by Leblond and Neutra in 1966 after injecting rats with 3H-glucose or 3H-galactose. Within ten minutes, the label was dramatically localized to the Golgi apparatus of intestinal goblet cells, indicating that this was the cellular site of addition of sugar residues in the synthesis of the carbohydrate side chains of mucous glycoproteins.\n\nThis discovery had a tremendous impact on the scientific community, being the first evidence for a functional role of the Golgi apparatus in the synthetic process.\n\nOther classics include: identification of how skeletal bones grow through osteoblast deposition and osteoclast remodeling, early discovery of the biogenesis and metabolism of thyroxine and detection of triiodothyronine, early prediction of DNA semiconservative replication published days after the Watson and Crick Nature article, the discovery of axonal transport, the Warshawsky et al. finding that nascent proteins are processed from the rough endoplasmic reticulum through the Golgi apparatus into pancreatic zymogen granules (made in hot competition with the Palade lab at Rockefeller University), the first realization that the Golgi apparatus is the site of terminal glycosylation, the discovery of the cell coat, the cellular biogenesis of collagen, and new insights into the ultrastructure of basement membrane.\n\nAt 65, instead of retiring, Leblond continued his research with an NIH Fogarty Scholarship at the National Institute of Dental Research, where he learned about immunohistochemistry. This launched a twenty-year molecular exploration culminating in the concept of the basement membrane as an integrated polymer, rather than as layers of separated macromolecules initially favored by others.\n\nLeblond continued to attend all weekly departmental seminars well into his 90s and continued to publish in peer-reviewed journals into the new millennium. He learned to use a computer at age 90, starting a presentation at an international conference back in 2004, by noting: \"A month ago, I thought Power Point was a tool for sharpening pencils.\"\n\nHis total contributions resulted in the publication of 430 scientific papers, many of them still frequently cited. In late September 2006, he published his final article—about detecting the MMP9 cysteine activation switch for the first time in remodeling cartilage.\n\nLeblond was preceded in death by his wife of 64 years, Gertrude Sternschuss, who died in 2000. After Gertrude died, Leblond married a childhood friend, Odette Lengrand, in 2001; they were both 91. Odette died in 2004.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2057955", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2057955", "title": "Mehmed Spaho", "text": "Mehmed Spaho\n\nMehmed Spaho (13 March 1883 – 29 June 1939) was a Bosniak politician and leader of the Yugoslav Muslim Organization. He was the first Bosnian Muslim politician in the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. Spaho was described as the \"undisputed leader of the Bosniaks between the two world wars\" by the newspaper \"Oslobođenje\" in 2013. He died under mysterious circumstances in a Belgrade hotel.\n\nSpaho was born in Sarajevo, at the time part of Austria-Hungary, into a coppersmith family. His father Hasan was an expert of the Sharia law, and before the Austrian-Hungarian occupation, he was a judge in the Ottoman cities of Jajce, Sofia, Damascus and Cairo. His mother was Fatima (née Bičakčić). Spaho had three sisters, Behija, Aiša and Habiba, and two brothers, Fehim and Mustafa.\n\nSpaho attended elementary school in Sarajevo, where he was a good student. In 1906 graduated from the Faculty of Law at the University of Vienna. At the end of 1907 he passed the doctoral exam and on 7 February 1908, he was officially named dr. iur. In Vienna, Spaho was a member of an organization called \"\"Zvijezda\"\" (The Star), an organization that gathered Muslim students. This organization promoted a closer cooperation between Serbs and Bosnian Muslims. Pro-Croat oriented Hakija Hadžić claimed that he challenged Spaho to a duel, while both of them were in Vienna, but Spaho refused to appear.\n\nWhen he returned from Vienna in 1906, Spaho worked as a court clerk until 1908. In 1910 he became a lawyer clerk for Josef Fischer. When the Commercial Chamber was established in Sarajevo in 1910, on its session held on 11 November 1910, Spaho was elected to be its secretary with an annual payment of 6,000 kronas; he started to work on 1 January 1911. During that time, he had an ambition to enter the Diet of Bosnia, along with other group of Muslims educated outside Bosnia and Herzegovina. His group eventually failed to enter the Diet. In 1914, Spaho was elected to the Sarajevo City Council, after his political associate and friend, Esad Kulović, stepped down. By this, Spaho dealt with both, economics and politics.\n\nAt the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, Bosnian Muslim leadership was divided. One part supported the autonomy of Bosnia and Herzegovina within Austria-Hungary, another part saw Bosnia and Herzegovina as part of Hungary, while others saw it united with Croatia. The idea about Yugoslavism was not yet present, for the Bosnian Muslim political elite had not even entertained such thoughts until the final months of World War I. It was Spaho who first articulated the pan-Yugoslavist sentiment in the Bosnian Muslim community. Spaho was not a significant politician at this point. On 15 February 1918, he stated in the \"Novosti\" magazine that the salvation of Bosnian Muslims was only within the \"unity of all Serbs, Croats and Slovenes\".\n\nDuring the war, Spaho entered a mission of the Council of Nutrition of Bosnia and Herzegovina, led by Governor Stjepan Sarkotić. As a member of the mission, Spaho traveled on 4 March 1918 to meet the Prime Minister of Hungary, Sándor Wekerle, to whom Spaho explained the hard food situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina. This mission was also received by the Minister of War, Rudolf Stöger-Steiner von Steinstätten, to whom Spaho explained the Memorandum of Peoples of Bosnia and Herzegovina in which it was explained that the requests made on requisition of cattle, hay, straw, wool etc. were undue. The next day, the mission was received by Ernst Seidler von Feuchtenegg, the Prime Minister of Austria. Spaho asked von Feuchtenegg to approve more potatoes for planting to be sent in Bosnia and Herzegovina. On 10 March, the mission was received by the Emperor, Charles I, whom Spaho asked to help to the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina with the food problem. He ended his request by praising the soldiers from Bosnia and Herzegovina who fought \"heroically, on all fronts\".\n\nBecause of his loyalty towards the monarchy, Spaho was decorated with the Order of Franz Joseph with a Knight Cross on 2 May 1918 in Sarajevo. During the time, Spaho still didn't support Yugoslavism, but only in Sarkotić's telegram to the Emperor from 23 September 1918, Spaho was marked as a supporter of Yugoslavism. Sarkotić's motive to make such telegram occurred after István Tisza, Hungarian Prime Minister visited Sarajevo. While in Sarajevo, Tisza spoke with the President of Diet of Bosnia, Safvet beg Bašagić, and Spaho, as with Secretary of the Commercial Chamber, and a lawyer, Dr. Halid Hrasnica. In that conversation, Bašagić claimed that it would be the best for Bosnia and Herzegovina to unite with other Croatian lands, or if that wouldn't be possible, at least to gain autonomy; Spaho and Hrasnica both disagreed and claimed ti would be the best if Bosnia and Herzegovina would become a part of Yugoslavia. Spaho complained to Tisza about Austrian-Hungarian treatment of Bosnian Muslims during the war, as they recruited, he claimed, elderly and the children and he complained about the procedure conducted in the requisition. He also stated that the differences between the religious groups in Bosnia and Herzegovina had faded during the war, and claimed that the majority of population supports the unification within Yugoslavia. After Tisza ended the meeting with the Bosnian Muslim delegation, he met with the representatives of Serbs who gave him the Memorandum in which it was stated that Croats, Serbs and Slovenes demand a united Yugoslav state. Three years later, Spaho complained to the Parliament in Belgrade that he was bypassed when this Memorandum was signed, even though he supported the same idea.\n\nIn the October 1918, Spaho, nevertheless, supported the Memorandum which was given to Tisza by Croat and Serb representatives. On 13 October 1918, Spaho called the session of Bosnian Muslim intellectuals to discuss their support for the Yugoslav state, but instead of a session, a group of Muslim intellectuals, among which was Spaho also, stated that they won't make any announcements without the approval of the National Assembly of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs. This statement made Spaho to enter the Plenum of the National Council of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs. Spaho was one of the two Bosnian Muslims to be a member. Even though other Bosnian Muslims later supported the Yugoslav state, Spaho was the one to be prioritized.\n\nOn 3 November 1918, when the first National Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina was formed, Spaho was named Commissioner for Trade, Post and Telegraph. As a Commissioner, Spaho was very active, especially with helping Bosnian Muslim families that were victims of violence before the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs united with the Kingdom of Serbia. Some ministers in the National Government demanded that the help must be offered to all victims, however, Spaho insisted that the victims that were victims of violence after 1 November 1918 must be prioritized, mainly Bosnian Muslims in East Bosnia.\n\nWhen the first government of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia was formed on 22 December 1918, whose president was Stojan Protić, Spaho was named Minister of Forestry and Mining. Spaho entered the Government as a representative of the Muslim religious group, and stayed in it until 23 February 1919, when he resigned.\n\nPolitical gathering of Bosnian Muslims was mostly around the political newspapers that were published after the war. There were two major newspapers, the \"Vrijeme\" (the Time) and the \"Jednakost\" (the Equality). The political group that gathered around the \"Vrijeme\" was called the \"Muslim Organization\", to which Spaho belonged. They emphasized their programme on 8 January 1919, advocating democracy, constitutionality, justice and harmony, and moreover, they announced their readiness to cooperate with everyone with the construction of the \"unique state of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes\", on the concept of equality of all three nationalities. The Yugoslav Muslim Organization (JMO), as it will be named, demanded protection of Islamic religious rights and protection of Muslims by the Constitution. The JMO was more a religious group, then a political party. They also demanded that all land must be given to each in order to secure one's existence and to protect large landowners, as that is, according to them, the interest of the state. Not just they demanded the protection of large landowners, who were the Bosnian Muslim beys, but they also requested retention of the serfs. The JMO also favoured decentralization of the state. As opposed to the JMO, the political group that gathered around the \"Jednakost\" newspaper, the Yugoslav Muslim Democracy (JMD), did not deal with either religious or agrarian questions, but only demanded that the power must be transferred more to the local level; nevertheless, they also supported the Karađorđević dynasty and Belgrade centralism. The Yugoslav Muslim Organization was officially established on 16 February 1919. All Bosnian Muslim organizations were united within it, except the \"Jednakost\" group, which joined Svetozar Pribićević's Yugoslav Democratic Party. At its foundation, Spaho wasn't member of the JMO, but he was a member of the \"Vrijeme\" political group, although not among its key persons. As a minister in the first government, Spaho couldn't influence the founding of the JMO. The JMO's first president was a mufti from Tuzla, Ibrahim Maglajlić. Spaho became a member of the JMO in May 1919.\n\nIn the same year, Spaho entered the Provisional National Office (PNO) in Belgrade. He was among 10 Bosnian Muslim representatives. Before the first session of the PNO, Spaho resigned from Ministry of Forestry and Mining due to his disagreement with the decisions of the Government, as the Government only took away the land of the Muslim landowners. As a member of the PNO, Spaho spoke about the injustice made towards the Bosnian Muslims. In the PNO, Spaho also cooperated with the Croat representatives, and was supported by his party, the JMO, with that. Spaho was very active in the PMO and spoke out about the inequality when it comes to Bosnian Muslims.\n\nIn 1920, Spaho was involved in a political campaign before the election of the Constituent Assembly. The election was held on 28 November 1920, and Spaho entered the Assembly. This time, Spaho joined the opposition. Again he was very active, especially around the questions which involved the Bosnian Muslim equality and their representation within the Government. Most of the time, Spaho and the JMO were in the opposition in the Constituent Assembly, however, as the time passed, they eventually deferred to the Government. The Government of Nikola Pašić wanted to get the JMO on their side for the vote of the new Constitution. In order to gain their reliance, he promised them the territorial compactness of Bosnia and Herzegovina, instead of its regional self-government, which was advocated by the JMO.\n\nPašić's proposal was accepted by some members of the JMO. In the letter which was sent by the JMO to Pašić which included the requests for their support to the new constitution, the proposal about the territorial compactness wasn't even mentioned, but only improvements around the treatment of Bosnian Muslims. The JMO club in the Assembly was divided, one part supported the negotiations with the government, while other was against the negotiations. Eventually, Spaho became a member of the JMO's delegation to negotiate with the Government, along with Hamdija Karamehmedović and Osman Vilović. On 15 March 1921, they made an agreement with Pašić. In this agreement, Pašić promised to secure the Muslim religious autonomy, make certain changes with the lands of beys, secure the payment of damages to the Bosnian Muslim landowners of some 255 million Yugoslav dinars and to secure the territorial compactness of Bosnia and Herzegovina based on its territorial boundaries. The JMO club accepted the agreement and chose Spaho and Karamehmedović to be their ministers in the Government; Spaho would take certain economic ministry while Karamehmedović would take the Ministry of Health.\n\nOn 26 March 1921, Spaho entered the Pašić's Government as Minister of Trade and Industry. However, his second ministerial position didn't lasted for long. The JMO representatives often clashed with the Radicals of Nikola Pašić, accusing them for trying to trick the JMO by not respecting the agreement they made. The speech made by the member of the Radical Party, Milan Srškić, in which he stated that Bosnian Muslim landowners shouldn't get the payments for damage, but the social help, and that only the ones who were really poor, made the JMO leave the Government. Spaho and Karamehmedović resigned on 1 June 1921. Both of them accused the Pašić's Government of not respecting the agreement. However, the Government had a meeting the next day and decided that they would pay for the damage and that the JMO ministers should return to their posts, which they did the very next day. Eventually, the whole JMO club decided to support the new Constitution, while Spaho himself stated that he would only oppose the 135th Article of the Constitution, in which was stated that municipalities of the banovinas will be able to defect to other banovinas if a majority agreed to do so, as this could damage the territorial commpactnes of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Soon, the whole JMO was again divided into factions, one that supported the 135th Article, the other that opposed it; among those who opposed it was Džafer-beg Kulenović. Those who supported the 135th Article were marked as a pro-Serb faction, while those who opposed were marked as the pro-Croat faction, even though the party's official newspaper denied the existence of any faction. Because of the problem with the 135th Article, on 26 June 1921, Spaho made an irrevocable resignation, while Karamehmedović resigned four days later. The new Vidovdan Constitution was accepted on 28 June, while both, Spaho and Karamehmedović, nevertheless, remained on their ministerial posts. On 3 September, while Spaho was on his way to Ljubljana to open a fair, a communist activist tried to assassinate him by planting a 14 kilogram naval mine, as he thought Spaho would travel by sea; however, Spaho took the train and avoided the assassination. The perpetrator was arrested and admitted his guilt.\n\nAfter voting the Vidovdan Constitution, part of the JMO thought that the party should break up the relations with Nikola Pašić; this part, led by Spaho, left Ibrahim Maglajlić, the President of the JMO. On 8 October 1921, the party elected the new Central Committee, electing Maglajlić as an honorary president and Spaho as its president. Spaho's election was seen as the party's turn towards left and basing on the autonomist policy. The Radicals and the Democrats argued for the ministerial posts, while the JMO, in this struggle, tried to secure better position of Bosnian Muslims. In JMO itself, the turmoil escalated between the leftists, led by Spaho, and rightists, led by Maglajlić; it is also thought that this turmoil was caused by the Radical Party in order to weaken the political strength of the JMO.\n\nOn the evening of 28 June 1939, Spaho departed Sarajevo for Belgrade by train, after receiving an invite from Prince Paul of Yugoslavia. With him was his personal secretary Mehmed Hadžihasanović, son of prominent Sarajevo dealer and then-senator Uzeir-aga Hadžihasanović. They arrived early the next morning at a train station, greeted by Džafer Kulenović, among others. Spaho arrived by car to the \"Srpski kralj\" (\"The Serbian King\") hotel, where he stayed when in Belgrade, and sat down at a desk to inspect some letters which had built up in his absence. Around that time, the hotel room received a phone call, an invite to take part in a \"police celebration\". Spaho declined to attend, saying he was overloaded with work. He took something to write and, at that moment suddenly grabbed his chest and fell off his chair. Hadžihasanović rushed over to his side, but it was too late, Spaho was deceased. His funeral on 30 June 1939 was attended by an estimated crowd of 30,000 mourners.\n\nSeveral versions of his death have circulated since that morning in 1939. One says that, while preparing an outfit for Spaho, Hadžihasanović heard a shout coming from the bathroom, rushing over, only to find him dead by the faucet. Another claims that he fell onto a bed on his way to the bathroom, others state that he died in the bathroom. Spaho's daughter Emina specified in March 2013 that he was served poisoned coffee upon leaving the bathroom, dropping almost immediately after his first sip. On 5 July 1939, Mehmed Sulejmanpašić, a reporter for the Turkish newspaper \"Cumhuriyet\" published a story claiming that Spaho had been poisoned and that his death was not a natural one, arguing that the attitude of Belgrade police chief Dragi Jovanović, who \"\"spent the entire time in the room with the Spaho's body, chasing out anyone who lingered for more than half a minute,\"\" was suspicious.\n\nOn the occasion of the 130th anniversary of his birth in 2013, his 91-year-old daughter Emina Kadić spoke to the newspaper \"Oslobođenje\" about her belief that her father had been poisoned when she was 17. She reiterated her theory in 2014, on the occasion of the 75th anniversary of her father's death, stating that Prince Paul was the one who ordered her father's assassination.\n\nKadić added that the Prince saw her father as a nuisance due to his fight for Muslim rights in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, and for being against the Cvetković–Maček Agreement, believing it to be an attempt by Serbs and Croats to divide Bosnia, and having it become part of Serbia and Croatia, disappearing from existence. She claims her father's disapproval of the Cvetković–Maček Agreement and the division of Bosnia amongst the Serbs and Croats as the main motive behind the assassination on the Serb holiday Vidovdan. Kadić said that her brother Zijah went back to Belgrade years later and spoke to the waiter who served their father the coffee that morning. She said that the waiter, named Dragan Vujić, admitted that he personally poured the poison into the cup of coffee. She said \"\"Why this was never investigated is another story.\"\" Kadić described her father as a kind man, who, although spending a lot of time working in Belgrade, would relax in his garden upon returning to Sarajevo.\n\nLess than two months after Spaho's death, the Cvetković–Maček Agreement was signed, temporarily dividing Bosnia and Herzegovina until World War II and the creation of Communist Yugoslavia.\n\n"}

{"id": "2057965", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2057965", "title": "Toco toucan", "text": "Toco toucan\n\nThe toco toucan (\"Ramphastos toco\"), also known as the common toucan or giant toucan, is the largest and probably the best known species in the toucan family. It is found in semi-open habitats throughout a large part of central and eastern South America. It is a common attraction in zoos.\n\nGerman zoologist Philipp Ludwig Statius Müller described the toco toucan in 1776.\n\nTwo subspecies are recognized:\n\nThe toco toucan has a striking plumage with a mainly black body, a white throat, chest and uppertail-coverts, and red undertail-coverts. What appears to be a blue iris is actually thin blue skin around the eye. This blue skin is surrounded by another ring of bare, orange skin. The most noticeable feature, however, is its huge bill, which measures from in length, which is yellow-orange, tending to deeper reddish-orange on its lower sections and culmen, and with a black base and large spot on the tip. It looks heavy, but as in other toucans it is relatively light because the inside largely is hollow. The tongue is nearly as long as the bill and very flat. This species is the largest toucan and the largest representative of the order Piciformes. The total length of the species is . Body weight in these birds can vary from , with males averaging against the smaller female, which averages . Among standard measurements, the wing chord is , the tail is and the tarsus is . Other than the size difference, there are no external differences between the sexes. Juveniles are duller and shorter-billed than adults. Its voice consists of a deep, coarse croaking, often repeated every few seconds. It also has a rattling call and will bill-clack.\n\nThe bill is the largest relative to body size of all birds providing 30 to 50% of its body surface area, although another Neotropical species, the sword-billed hummingbird, has a longer bill relative to its body length. It was called by Buffon a “grossly monstrous” appendage. Diverse functions have been suggested. Charles Darwin suggested it was a sexual ornament: “toucans may owe the enormous size of their beaks to sexual selection, for the sake of displaying the diversified and vivid stripes of colour with which these organs are ornamented\". Further suggestions have included aid in peeling fruit, intimidating other birds when robbing their nests, social selection related to defense of territory, and as a visual warning.\n\nResearch has shown that one function is as a surface area for heat exchange. The bill has the ability to modify blood flow and so regulate heat distribution in the bird, allowing it to use its bill as a thermal radiator. In terms of surface area used for this function, the bill relative to the bird's size is amongst the largest of any animal and has a network of superficial blood vessels supporting the thin horny sheath on the bill made of keratin called the rhamphotheca.\n\nIn its capacity to remove body heat the bill is comparable to that of elephant ears. The ability to radiate heat depends upon air speed: if this is low only 25% of the adult bird's resting heat production to as much as four times this heat production. In comparison, the bill of a duck and the ears of elephant can shed only 9 to 9.1% of resting heat production. The bill normally is responsible for 30 to 60% of heat loss. The practice of toco toucans of placing their bills under their wings may serve to insulate the bill and reduce heat loss during sleep. It has been observed that \"complexities of the vasculature and controlling mechanisms needed to adjust the blood flow to the bill may not be completely developed until\nadulthood.\"\n\nThe toco toucan occurs in northern and eastern Bolivia, extreme south-eastern Peru, northern Argentina, eastern and central Paraguay, and eastern and southern Brazil (excluding southern Rio Grande do Sul, the dry regions dominated by Caatinga vegetation and coastal regions between Ceará and Rio de Janeiro). Other disjunct populations occur along the lower Amazon River (Ilha de Marajó west approximately to the Madeira River), far northern Brazil in Roraima, coastal regions of the Guianas and it has been recently registered in north-west Uruguay. It only penetrates the Amazon in relatively open areas (e.g. along rivers). It is resident, but local movements may occur.\n\nIt is, unlike the other members of the genus \"Ramphastos\", essentially a non-forest species. It can be found in a wide range of semi-open habitats such as woodland, savanna and other open habitats with scattered trees, Cerrado, plantations, forest-edge, and even wooded gardens. It is mainly a species of lowlands, but occurs up to near the Andes in Bolivia. It is easily seen in the Pantanal.\n\nThe toco toucan eats fruit using its bill to pluck them from trees, but also insects, frogs, small reptiles, small birds and their eggs and nestlings. The long bill is useful for reaching things that otherwise would be out-of-reach. It is typically seen in pairs or small groups. In flight it alternates between a burst of rapid flaps with the relatively short, rounded wings, and gliding. Nesting is seasonal, but timing differs between regions. The nest is typically placed high in a tree and consists of a cavity, at least part of which is excavated by the parent birds themselves. It has also been recorded nesting in holes in earth-banks and terrestrial termite-nests. Their reproduction cycle is annual. The female usually lays two to four eggs a few days after mating. The eggs are incubated by both sexes and hatch after 17–18 days. These birds are very protective of themselves and their chicks.\n\nLike the keel-billed toucan, the toco toucan is sometimes kept in captivity, but has a high fruit diet and is sensitive to hemochromatosis (an iron storage disease). Also, pet toco toucans must not be permitted to eat mouse (or rat) meat, due to a risk of bacterial infection. There is an ongoing population management plan that should help to revert the decreasing captive population of the toco toucan for Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA) member institutions. This is the second management plan that is occurring since 2001.\n\nBecause it prefers open habitats, the toco toucan is likely to benefit from the widespread deforestation in tropical South America. It has a large range and except in the outer regions of its range, it typically is fairly common. It is therefore considered to be of Least Concern by BirdLife International.\n\n\n"}

Free energy relationships establish the extent at which bond formation and bond breakage happen in the transition state of a reaction, and in combination with kinetic isotope experiments a reaction mechanism can be determined. Free energy relationships are often used to calculate equilibrium constants since they are experimentally difficult to determine.\n\nThe most common form of free-energy relationships are linear free-energy relationships (LFER). The Brønsted catalysis equation describes the relationship between the ionization constant of a series of catalysts and the reaction rate constant for a reaction on which the catalyst operates. The Hammett equation predicts the equilibrium constant or reaction rate of a reaction from a \"substituent constant\" and a \"reaction type constant\". The Edwards equation relates the nucleophilic power to \"polarisability\" and \"basicity\". The Marcus equation is an example of a quadratic free-energy relationship (QFER).\n\nIUPAC has suggested that this name should be replaced by linear Gibbs energy relation, but at present there is little sign of acceptance of this change.\nThe area of physical organic chemistry which deals with such relations is commonly referred to as 'linear free-energy relationships'.\n\nA typical LFER relation for predicting the equilibrium concentration of a compound or solute in the vapor phase to a condensed (or solvent) phase can be defined as follows (following M.H.

{"id": "2057978", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2057978", "title": "Water pumping", "text": "Water pumping\n\nThe pumping of water is a basic and practical technique, far more practical than scooping it up with one's hands or lifting it in a hand-held bucket. This is true whether the water is drawn from a fresh source, moved to a needed location, purified, or used for irrigation, washing, or sewage treatment, or for evacuating water from an undesirable location. Regardless of the outcome, the energy required to pump water is an extremely demanding component of water consumption. All other processes depend or benefit either from water descending from a higher elevation or some pressurized plumbing system.\n\nThe ancient concept of the aqueduct took simple and eloquent advantage of maintaining elevation of water for as long and far a distance as possible. Thus, as water moves over great distances, it retains a larger component of its potential energy by spending small portions of this energy flowing down a slight gradation. A useful aqueduct system ultimately depends on a fresh water source existing at a higher elevation than the location where the water can be of use. Gravity does all the work. In all other instances, pumps are necessary.\n\nIn day-to-day situations, available water is often contaminated, unhealthy, or even naturally poisonous, so that it is necessary to pump potable water from lower levels to higher levels, where it can be of use. A fresh water source in a lower stream, river, pond, or lake is often pumped to higher ground for irrigation, livestock, cooking, cleaning or other uses by humans, who quite naturally need fresh water. This will purify mostly fresh water, and the treatment of largely contaminated water refer endlessly to pumping.\n\nA coil pump is a low lift pump which is composed of a tube, shaped as a coil and mounted on a rotating axle powered by an engine or an animal capable of turning the axle around rapidly. Due to the rotation, water is then picked up by the tube and pumped upwards in the hose. The coil pump, as many low lift pumps, is commonly used for irrigation purposes and for drainage of lands. It is currently still used by farmers in Asia.\n\nThe coil pump was built as an alternative to the Archimedean screw. Unlike the Archimedean screw, it can run horizontally while the Archimedean screw is tilted at about 30°. The coil pump, if fitted with a suitable rotating seal, can deliver water to a greater height, typically 5-10m, above their discharge opening. Despite the emergence of new pumps that operate on other principles, the coil pump remains an important tool as some of it other benefits are that they can be built and repaired easily at a very low cost. This is possible as all the components can be built from local resources as metal; which can be obtained and cast into the desired form easily.\n\nHowever, as mentioned before, the pump only allows the lifting of water over a small height. This makes it unsuitable for water drainage or irrigation over larger height differences or many other pumping applications besides drainage and irrigation.\n\nA spiral pump , sometimes called a Wirtz pump, is a low lift pump which is composed of a long piece of metal plating, which is wound into a coil and sealed at the top and back extremities so as to resemble a cylinder. The outer cavity serves as the inlet, while the inner (partial) tube serves as the outlet. A coiled plastic tube will suffice for this arrangement. The outlet pipe is fixed to a water wheel, engine or animal which is capable of rotating the pump quickly. Due to this rotation, water is picked up by the outer cavity and pumped upwards in the hose.\n\nThe spiral pump, as many low lift pumps, is commonly used for irrigation purposes and for drainage of lands. Based on the same principle as the Archimedean screw, it consists of a rotating tube or plane (screw) to move a liquid. Unlike the Archimedean screw, it can pump while horizontal. The Archimedean screw must be tilted at an angle. The spiral pump, if fitted with a suitable rotating seal, can deliver water to a greater height than the coil pump, typically 5-10m, above their discharge opening. Its main drawback is that the output is small - an output proportional to the volume of the largest coil being moved each revolution. Despite the emergence of new pumps that operate on other principles, the spiral pump remains an important tool as it can be built and repaired easily at a very low cost. This is possible as all the components can be built from local resources such as sheet metal bent into the desired form with or without machine tools.\n\nThe Zürich pewterer H.A. Wirtz invented the pump in 1736. The first published description and mechanical analysis was written by one JH Ziegler twenty years later, in 1766, with Wirtz' consent. Wirtz' original pump was powered by a stream wheel in the Limmat river, to raise water for a dye house.\n\n"}

PICMG is distinct from the similarly named and adjacently-focused PCI Special Interest Group (PCI-SIG).\n\nPICMG currently focuses on developing and implementing specifications and guidelines for open standards-based computer architectures from a wide variety of interconnects.\n\nPICMG is a leading standards development organization in the embedded computing industry. Members work collaboratively to develop new specifications and enhancements to existing ones. The members benefit from participating in standards development, gain early access to leading-edge technology, and forging relationships with thought leaders and suppliers in the industry.\n\nThe original PICMG mission was to provide extensions to the PCI standard developed by PCI-SIG for a range of applications. The organization's collaborations eventually expanded to include a variety of interconnect technologies for industrial computing and telecommunications. PICMG's specifications are used in a wide variety of industries including industrial automation, military, aerospace, telecommunications, medical, gaming, transportation, physics/research, test & measurement, energy, drone/robotics, and general embedded computing.\n\nIn 2011, PICMG completed its transfer of assets from the Communications Platforms Trade Association (CP-TA). Since 2006, CP-TA had been a collaboration of communications vendors, developing interoperability testing requirements, methodologies, and procedures based on open specifications from PICMG, The Linux Foundation, and the Service Availability Forum. PICMG has continued the educational and marketing outreach formerly conducted by members of the CP-TA marketing work group.\n\nOpen specifications and standards provide several benefits including multiple sources, scalability and upgrades, a large ecosystem of interoperable products, proven and tested designs, and much more. But they should not be confused with open source. The open source groups tend to focus on specific product designs where even the Gerber files, schematics, and mechanical drawings are included. This lends itself to monochrome, commodity products with little differentiation. Open specification/open standard groups on the other hand define focus on common interfaces for interoperable products rather than finished products. Multiple vendors contribute to the base definitions and interfaces, but the implementation can vary greatly. The result is a rich and diverse set of interoperable products geared for a wide range of applications.\n\nFor many years, PICMG used a numerical naming convention with specification being referred to as “PICMG X.YY”. Where X was used denoted differing form factors (“1” for slot card based single board computers, “2” for CompactPCI and “3” for AdvancedTCA) while YY was used to indicate incremental changes, option definitions or slight variation of a specification form its core specification. In 2003, PICMG added an acronym-based naming convention for its specifications to yield better results from internet search engines. Specifications are now often named ABCD.X where ABCD is an acronym of the specification. In this naming convention, base or main specification are denote with X=0 (i.e. ABCD.0) and PICMG subsidiary specifications are denoted X>0. PICMG subsidiary specifications represent how various options or variations of a based specification should be handled.\n\nThese groups represent standing committees which may result in new subsidiary specification, revisions to existing specification, reference materials for future PICMG committees or new PICMG specifications.\n\nThe following specifications were developed by the ASI SIG which has now disbanded and has transferred these documents to PICMG. \n\nThe PICMG has active liaisons with several industry bodies including the Service Availability Forum.\n\n\n"}

From 1939 until 1945 the Union was outlawed in Nazi Germany. After 1945 it had lost some of its influence; in 1950 the Union of Poles in Germany split into two organizations: the \"Union of Poles in Germany\" (), which refused to recognize the communist Polish government of the Polish United Workers' Party, and the \"Union of Poles \"Zgoda\" (Unity)\" (), which recognized the new communist government in Warsaw and had contacts with it. The split was healed in 1991.\n\nThe union was intended to express the views of the Polish minority in Germany, This partly comprised the Polish-native population of the former East German provinces which remained with Germany under the conditions of the Treaty of Versailles (Upper Silesia, East Brandenburg, Pomerania, Warmia) or areas where Poles settled in Middle Ages (East Prussia) — mostly farmers and workers — and partly the Polish immigrants in Ruhr area (see Ruhr Poles).

However, the Polish minority was only legally recognised as such in Upper Silesia, where they possessed international status due to Treaty of Versailles. In other areas Poles had no special minority rights.\n\nIn February 1933 the Union created a central financial institution, \"Bank Słowiański\" (The Slavic Bank), with a professional and technical staff. This institution was one of many Polish financial and economic organisations in Germany, such as: banks of peasant farmers, cooperatives, agricultural circles and savings banks. Up to 1931, twenty-one Polish credit banks acted in Germany.\n\nIn Nazi Germany Poles faced increased problems, as the Nazis attempted to force cultural unity on the country. Poles outside of the Upper Silesia, such as Lower Silesia, were forced to declare German nationality; activists of the union were subject to persecutions. However, the union was kept legal in the hope of avoiding escalations of ethnic conflict that would create problems for the German minority in Poland (mostly in the autonomous Silesian Voivodeship, in Wielkopolska and the then Pomeranian Voivodeship, comprising parts of former West Prussia in the Polish Corridor, 1919–1939).\n\nThe leaders of the Union found it necessary to invent new symbols for the Union to avoid the possibility that Poles would adhere to the new “national” symbols, such as the Nazi salute and the swastika.\n\nThis led to invention of the symbol of the Union, the Rodło, a stylized representation of the Vistula river. The reason for its adoption was that the Polish national symbol, the White Eagle, was not allowed by Prussian law. The Nazi swastika provided a certain inspiration for the Poles's own alternative symbol that was designed to be a challenge to Nazi Germany.\n\nIt was created by the graphic designer Janina Kłopocka, who made a rough sketch of \"the emblem of the Vistula river, cradle of the Polish people, and royal Kraków — the cradle of Polish culture\". The white emblem was placed on a red background to emphasize the solidarity with the Polish nation and its soul.\n\nOriginally, the Union, with headquarters in Berlin (until the outbreak of World War II), was divided into four districts. In October 1923 the District V was created, with capital in Złotów (). It covered the area of Grenzmark Posen-West Prussia. Also, the province of Lower Silesia was in 1928 added to District I. Union of Poles in Germany According to postwar estimates based on rescued archives, in mid-1924 Union of Poles in Germany had approximately 32 000 members in all districts:\n\nEven before the German invasion of Poland, leading anti-Nazi members of the Polish minority were deported to concentration camps; some were executed at the Piaśnica murder site. The Union was outlawed by the Nazi government in August, 1939.\n\nMembers of the Polish minority who held German citizenship were subject to obligatory military service in the German regular Armed Forced; those who did not, were obliged to forced labor or emigration into the Government General of occupied Poland. In 1945, most of areas populated by the Polish minorities were located inside the new post-War Polish border, the Oder-Neisse line.\n\nAfter the war, many members found it difficult to be recognised as ethnic Poles by the new Communist authorities, as some - like the Kashubians (grandfather of Donald Tusk is an example) - had served as \"\"Germans\"\" in the German Wehrmacht. Moreover, along with most Poles, they were unsympathetic to the Communist ideology of the new government. Unlike most of Polish society, the native Poles in former German territory sometimes had no experience of a Polish state concept, other than under Communism. Some of them, who had held German citizenship prior to 1945, emigrated en masse into West Germany subsequently, during the Communist regime in the People's Republic of Poland. (As did numerous Kashubians and nearly all Lutheran Protestant, pro-Prussian Masurians of southern East Prussia.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

(April 28, 1812 – March 1, 1856) was an Italian priest of the Society of Jesus. He was a missionary in the Oregon Territory and later founded Santa Clara College in California, United States.\n\nBorn in Rome in 1812, and educated at the Roman College. Nobili entered the Society of Jesus in 1828 and taught humanities in Jesuit colleges in Italy, notably the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome. He was ordained a priest in 1843. Nobili was later assigned to do missionary work in North America and was assigned to accompany Father Pierre DeSmet, S.J. in his missionary work in the Oregon Territory. Nobili's missionary work took him amongst the many Native American tribes in the territory, where he learned the tribes' languages and customs.\n\nNobili stayed in the Oregon Territory until 1849, when he was ordered to go to California. Joined by Father Michael Accolti, S.J., Nobili first traveled to San Francisco, then onto San Jose. Upon his arrival in San Jose, Archbishop Joseph Alemany appointed him the pastor of Mission Santa Clara, then recently acquired from the Franciscans. He continued his missionary work in part, ministering to the sick and dying during a cholera epidemic in 1850.\n\nAs part of his pastoral work, Nobili established a preparatory school in 1851 on the mission's premises. In 1853 the school began offering advanced courses, and its name was changed to Santa Clara College. During Nobili's tenure as president, a new academic building and dormitory (1854), a gymnasium (1855), and a small gothic chapel (1856) were constructed. According to the 1854-55 Catalogue, he also directed the purchase of a \"new and complete philosophical and chemical apparatus, comprising all the recent improvements\" previously unavailable in California. The College would later grow into present-day Santa Clara University.\n\nWhile overseeing the construction of the chapel in January 1856, Nobili stepped on a nail. He died of Tetanus shortly thereafter in Santa Clara on the first day of March. Archbishop Alemany presided over his funeral Mass and laid his body to rest near the altar of the unfinished chapel.\n\nNobili Avenue in Santa Clara and the Nobili Residence Hall at Santa Clara University are named in his honor.\n\n"}

The robbery would gain the gang considerable notoriety from both the New York press and the city's underworld as Ike Marsh was said to have stated the gang was \"\"just as good as those cowboys.\"\".

It is a series of translucent plastic tubes and \"houses\" for use in home terrariums, designed specially for hamsters. The design of the Habitrail is modular and can be configured however the owner likes, as well as disassembled for cleaning. The Habitrail is meant to mimic the habitat of the animal in question, usually a warren, or series of tunnels. The mascot for Habitrail is \"Herbie the Hamster\", who even has a video game based on him called \"Habitrail Hamster Ball\" produced by Data Design Interactive in 2005 and released for the PS2, and the PC.\n\nLarge Habitrails may contain multiple bathroom spots chosen by the pet, and a good Habitrail should incorporate small holes and metal bars to increase ventilation. Habitrails do not make good cages for gerbils, due to the tendency of these animals to chew obsessively on the rim of the cage.\n\nInnovative features, including the bed, food area, and hamster wheel, make excellent use of the enclosure's small areas. Use of clear plastics also makes it easy to see the hamster scuttling around the various pods and tunnels.\n\nAlthough Habitrails make fun and unique homes for hamsters or mice, they are rather small. This tends to be a problem for Syrian hamsters, who often get lodged in the tubes, particularly those that are pregnant. Conversely, Habitrails tend to be too large to work well for dwarf hamsters, such as the Roborovski and White Russian types, as they can not climb up the tube. In response, the Rolf C. Hagen Corp. introduced two new housings in 2007: the Habitrail OVO, which featured a larger modular design that also made it easier to observe hamsters and maintain their housing, and a similar cage with narrower tubes designed for dwarfs.\n\nThe wheel(s) that come with the Habitrail OVO cage have three long holes that line the middle of the wheel where the hamster is to run; Habitrail has stated that the holes are to allow waste to drop through, but the legs of hamsters (especially the dwarfs) tend to fall into the holes. The high & smooth stairs leading to the feeding dish tend to be difficult for smaller hamsters to negotiate.\n\nThe word \"habitrail\" is also used in reference to enclosed pedestrian walkways, particularly those with few or no side branches, offering no personal choice of route, and those interconnecting unpleasant workplaces such as factories and office buildings.\n\nThe Habitrail has become such a long-running institution that the name has almost become a generic word for any maze-like tubular structure: for example, \"habitrail\" is a common term for the raised wire-form ball guide in a pinball machine.\n\n"}

The population of Mahé was 77,000, as of the 2010 census. It contains the capital city of Victoria and accommodates 86% of the country's total population. The island was named after Bertrand-François Mahé de La Bourdonnais, a French governor of Isle de France (modern-day Mauritius).\n\nMahé's tallest peak is Morne Seychellois at , which lies in the Morne Seychellois National Park. The northern and eastern parts of the island are home to much of the population and the Seychelles International Airport which opened in 1971. The southern and western parts have Baie Ternay Marine National Park, Port Launay Marine National Park, and University of Seychelles. The Sainte Anne Marine National Park lies offshore, as do Conception Island, Thérèse Island, Anonyme Island and several smaller islands.\n\nMahé was first visited by the British in 1609 and not visited by Europeans again until Lazare Picault's expedition of 1742. The French navy frégate \"Le Cerf\" (English: The Deer) arrived at Port Victoria on 1 November 1756. On board was Corneille Nicholas Morphey, leader of the French expedition, which claimed the island for the King of France by laying a Stone of Possession on Mahe, Seychelles’ oldest monument, now on display in the National Museum, Victoria.\n\nIn August 1801 a Royal Navy frigate HMS \"Sibylle\" captured the French frigate \"Chiffonne\" on the island. Mahé remained a French possession until 1812 when it became a British colony. It remained a colony until 1976 when Seychelles became an independent nation.\n\nMahé's forests have rare endemic plants found only in Seychelles, such as the critically endangered \"Medusagyne oppositifolia\" (the jellyfish tree), the carnivorous \"Nepenthes pervillei\" (Seychelles pitcher plant), and many unique species of orchid.\n\nMahé had a huge land reclamation project due to a shortage of housing, in the areas of Bel Ombre and the Port of Victoria.\n\nMahé's economy is mainly dependent on tourism.\nAir Seychelles has its head office on the property of Seychelles International Airport on the island. The Port of Victoria is home to a tuna fishing and canning industry.

The present gate, which is the fifth one to have stood on the site, was built between 2011 and 2014 to designs of the Italian architect Renzo Piano.\n\nThe first gate which stood on the site was Porta San Giorgio, which was built in 1569 to designs of either Francesco Laparelli or Girolamo Cassar. The gate was renamed Porta Reale () in around 1586, before being rebuilt in 1633, probably to designs of Tommaso Dingli. It was briefly renamed Porte Nationale during the French occupation of Malta in 1798, but its name reverted to \"Porta Reale\" when Malta fell under British rule in 1800. In 1853, this was once again replaced by a larger gate, which was also known as Kingsgate or \"Kingsway\". These first three gates were all fortified, forming part of Valletta's city walls. The gate was also informally called the \"Porta di terra\" (meaning \"land gate\") since it was the only landward approach to the city.\n\nThe last fortified gate was demolished in 1964, being replaced by a Futurist gate designed by Alziro Bergonzo. This gate was then demolished in 2011, and it was replaced by Piano's gate which was completed in 2014.\n\nCity Gate is located within the Porta Reale Curtain, a curtain wall at the centre of the Valletta Land Front, located between St. James' and St. John's Bastions. A bridge spanning across Valletta's deep ditch leads to the gate. The gate was originally protected by a \"couvre porte\", an advanced ditch and a lunette known as St. Madeleine's Lunette. During British rule, the lunette was demolished and part of the advanced ditch was filled in. The site was later occupied by the bus terminus, with the Triton Fountain at the centre. The square around the fountain has been converted into a pedestrian area.\n\nThe gate marks the beginning of Republic Street (), Valletta's main street which goes all the way until Fort Saint Elmo at the opposite end of the city. The buildings in the immediate vicinity of the City Gate include the Parliament House, the ruins of the Royal Opera House and the City Gate Shopping Arcade. Saint James Cavalier and Saint John's Cavalier are located on either side of the gate, near the Parliament House and shopping arcade respectively.\n\nCity Gate was one of the three gates leading to the city – the others being the Marsamxett Gate and Del Monte Gate, on the western and eastern extremities of the city. Marsamxett Gate was demolished in the early 20th century, while Del Monte Gate was replaced by Victoria Gate in 1885.\n\nThe original gate to Valletta was known as \"Porta San Giorgio\", and was built during the reign of Grand Master Jean Parisot de Valette, after whom the city is named. Porta San Giorgio was possibly designed by Francesco Laparelli, the Italian military engineer who designed most of the fortifications of Valletta, or by his Maltese assistant Girolamo Cassar. Construction started in April 1566 and it was complete by 1569. The gate was rather plain in design, and was simply an unadorned small opening in the curtain walls.\n\nA timber bridge originally linked Porta San Giorgio with the countryside across the ditch. Sometime before 1582, a stone bridge replaced the wooden one. The bridge itself was replaced a number of times, but its rock-hewn foundations remain intact and continue to support the present bridge.\n\nIn around 1586, during the reign of Grand Master Hugues Loubenx de Verdalle, the gate was renamed \"Porta Reale\". In the late 16th century, a smaller outer gate was built and a triumphal arch was added above the original gate.\n\nThe second city gate was built in 1633, during the magistracy of Grand Master Antoine de Paule. This gate was more ornate than its predecessor \"Porta San Giorgio\", and it consisted of a central archway with a smaller arch at each side, and a wooden drawbridge across the deep, dry ditch that lies immediately outside the city walls.\n\nThis gate is often attributed to the Maltese architect Tommaso Dingli, although there is no documentary evidence supporting this claim.\n\nDuring the French occupation of Malta in 1798–1800, the gate was known as \"Porte Nationale\". In accordance with Proclamation No. VI of 1814, which was issued by Governor Sir Thomas Maitland, the British coat of arms was installed at the gate in 1815. This coat of arms might have been the work of the sculptor Vincenzo Dimech.\n\nThe gate was modified over time, and by the late 18th and early 19th centuries there were a number of features which had not been part of Dingli's original design. The gate was demolished in 1853 since it was too small and had to be widened.\n\nThe remains of a 17th-century drawbridge believed to have been installed at Porta Reale are now exhibited at the Fortifications Interpretation Centre.\n\nThe third city gate was built in 1853, during the height of British rule of Malta. The gate was known as \"Porta Reale\", and was also known as \"Putirjal\" in Maltese and \"Kingsgate\" or \"Kingsway\" in English.\n\nThe gate was designed by Col. Thompson of the Royal Engineers, and it consisted of two central arches with two smaller ones. There were two statues on either side of the gate: one of Philippe Villiers de L'Isle-Adam, the first Grand Master in Malta, and one of Jean Parisot de Valette, the founder of the city. On 24 July 1892, a bronze bust of Pope Pius V, who had made significant financial contributions to the building of Valletta, was installed above the archway on the rear of the gate.\n\nBy the early 20th century, the gate was regarded as too small to cope with the large influx of people entering the city. The first proposals to address this issue were made in the 1920s, and some included replacing the gate with an open carriageway. Kingsgate survived the bombings of World War II, although it was slightly damaged in April 1942, when the bridge leading to the gate was hit by aerial bombardment. The statues of L'Isle-Adam and de Valette were destroyed during this attack.\n\nThe first plans to redevelop the Royal Opera House and the entrance of Valletta were made in the 1950s. This project was revived by Prime Minister George Borg Olivier in 1962, focusing on the city gate. The project to replace the gate with a larger one was announced at the 1963 Trade Fair Exposition, and the gate was pulled down in June 1964.\n\nFollowing the demolition of the gate, the bust of Pius V was placed into storage, before being retrieved by the Valletta Local Council in 1993. In 2005, the bust was moved to Great Siege Square, close to Saint John's Co-Cathedral and the Law Courts.\n\nThe fourth city gate was built between June 1964 and August 1965 to designs of the architect Alziro Bergonzo, in the Italian rationalist style. The gate consisted of a large opening in the centre with two smaller ones on the sides, and it had a simple design with limited ornamentation. Pope Pius V Street () passed on top of the gate.\n\nThe gate was part of a project that was never fully completed, that of redeveloping the entrance to Valletta and the Royal Opera House. It was controversial at the time of its construction, with the general public having mixed opinions on the gate. In March 1965, when construction of the gate was underway, the Chamber of Architects criticized its design as an \"architectural flop\". Arguments in favour of the gate said that it offered a better view of the bastions, and its design reflected the fortifications' austerity.\n\nFurther criticism was directed towards the gate in subsequent decades, and there was public interest to replace the gate. The Italian architect Renzo Piano first made plans to redevelop the entrance of Valletta in 1988, but the project was shelved by 1992. In 2008, the government resumed contact with Piano to replace the gate. Piano's new plans were revealed on 27 June 2009, and City Gate was demolished between 2 and 5 May 2011, with Prime Minister Lawrence Gonzi attending the demolition. The demolition of City Gate and the nearby Freedom Square arcades cost a total of €1.39 million.\n\nThe fifth and present city gate was constructed between 2011 and 2014 to designs of Renzo Piano. This gate is very different from the previous ones, as it consists of a breach in the bastions, flanked by large blocks of stone which are separated from the curtain walls by high blades of steel. Like the fourth gate, it was also built as part of a project to redesign the city entrance. The project also turned the ruins of the Royal Opera House into an open-air theatre known as \"Pjazza Teatru Rjal\", and a new Parliament House was built occupying part of Freedom Square.\n\nThe new city gate, like the rest of Piano's project, was controversial. The majority of the Maltese welcomed the demolition of the fourth gate, although it was one of the few examples of Italian rationalist architecture on the island. Some critics of the new gate preferred a more traditional design similar to the third gate. The new gate has been compared to the ancient Egyptian Temple of Edfu, with critics saying that the breach in the bastions is out of place in the largely Mannerist and Baroque city.\n\nIn October 2014, an art installation entitled \"Prospettiva\" was inaugurated in Girolamo Cassar Avenue, close to the bus terminus. The installation incorporates elements from the five gates which have stood at the entrance of Valletta, and it was designed by the architect Chris Briffa. The installation commemorates Valletta's selection as European Capital of Culture in 2018.\n"}

The park borders on the Sun City entertainment complex. It is currently administered by the North West Parks and Tourism Board.\n\nThe area is defined by alternating ridges and valleys forming concentric rings, a geological formation that rises abruptly from the surrounding plains. The Pilanesberg is named for chief Pilane of the Kgafêla people, who ruled from Bogopane, Mmamodimokwana and eventually Mmasebudule during the 1800s. The 'Pilanesberg Alkaline Ring Complex' is the park's primary geological feature. This vast circular feature is geologically ancient, being the crater of a long-extinct volcano – the result of eruptions some 1,200 million years ago. It is one of the largest volcanic complexes of its type in the world, the rare rock types and formations make it a unique geological feature, and a number of rare minerals occur in the park.\n\nScattered throughout the park are various sites that are assigned to the Iron and Stone Ages and illustrate the presence of man during those early periods.\n\nThe park has an area of , and visitors can travel through in a standard road vehicle. Although most of the 188 kilometers of track is not surfaced, it is all maintained in good condition. The three main tarred roads are named Kgabo, Kubu and Tshwane. There are several camps, including Bakgatla and Manyane, serving the park from the perimeter. Several lodges are situated in the interior of the park. For day visitors, there are several stops on the inside where there are bars and gift shops. Near the center of the park, there is an artificially constructed lake, the Mankwe Dam, and Thabayadiotso, which means \"the Proud Mountain\".\n\nThe scenic terrain lies in the transition zone between Kalahari and Lowveld, and both types of vegetation are found here. As a result of the park being in a transition zone, there are overlaps in mammals, birds, and vegetation. Today, Pilanesberg Game Reserve accommodates almost every large mammal of southern Africa.\n\nDistinct vegetation communities can be found in the Pilanesberg. The broad vegetation communities present in the Park have been described as follows:\n\n\nThe park has a rich array of southern African wildlife including the Big Five, the five most dangerous game animals in Africa. Most of the animal species of southern Africa live in the Pilanesberg Game Reserve today, including lions, elephants, black rhinos, white rhinos, Cape buffaloes, leopards, cheetahs, Hartmann's mountain zebras, giraffes, hippos and crocodiles. The Cape wild dog (\"Lycaon pictus pictus\") had been extirpated from the park, but successful reintroduction efforts have been carried out. Over 360 bird species were counted. The Pilanesberg is not in a location which the Big Five animals would naturally inhabit, however they have been brought into the 550 square kilometers of African bushland.\n\nAs of December 2010 the total count of large mammals was approximately 10,000, including:\n\n\nOther cats can be found, such as caracals.\n\nThe only indigenous southern African mammals that are not there are bontebok, blesbuck, spotted hyena, nyala and roan antelope.\n\nThe diversity of birdlife is excellent with over 360 species having been recorded. Though some are migrants, most others are permanent inhabitants. Their food sources vary with some eating carrion or live prey, others eat seeds, fruit or tiny water organisms.\n\nThere is a self-guided trail in the Walking Area at the Manyane Complex in the east, which offers environmental education whilst game viewing and bird watching on foot. Also at Manyane, there is a walk-in aviary with over 80 species of indigenous birds.\n\nHumans have been in the Pilanesberg area since the Middle Stone Age. Many artifacts from this period can be found throughout the Park. Hunter-gatherers roamed the area well before the first Setswana-speaking people settled as cattle and grain farmers.\n\nDuring the later Iron Age period, the ancestors of the Batswana and Basotho people occupied the area. They were cattle farmers and pastoralists who also worked copper and iron.\n\nMajor Tswana towns were established during the late 18th century. Most of these towns were destroyed during the Difaqane wars that raged in the Pilanesberg/Magaliesberg region in the late 1820s, when Mzilikazi occupied the region. The towns were destroyed and the Ndebele ruled over the area during the period.\n\nIn the late nineteenth century, Pilanesberg served as a sanctuary to Mzilikazi’s rebel Zulu warriors who passed through the area as they fled the wrath of the Zulu king, Shaka. A mission station was established more or less in the northwestern part of the park, on the farm \"Driefontein\", which lay wedged between a large section of land traditionally owned by the Bakgatla-ba-Kgafela (commonly known as the Bakgatla) tribe. This land constitutes much of the northern region of today's Pilanesberg reserve.\n\nWhat is now the southern section of the Pilanesberg reserve was originally a set of farms which were sold to and registered in the names of a number of Boer farmers by the Transvaal government in the 1860s. These farmers were responsible for building the Houwater dam - now known as the Mankwe dam - which is the Pilanesberg's largest standing water reservoir. During the 1960s, these farms were re-purchased by the South African government, which, under Apartheid policies, re-settled the Bakubung tribe from nearby Ventersdorp onto the farms Wydhoek, Koedoesfontein, and Ledig. These farms, situated on and in the southern part of the Pilanesberg reserve adjacent to Sun City, were subsequently delivered to Bophuthatswana, a large northwestern bantustan, for administration and control. As a result, the only remaining private property inside the Pilanesberg reserve amounts to 3 small sections (likely graveyards, approximately 3 hectares each in size) as well as a farm (approximately 608 hectares) registered in the name of Catherina Clark, a daughter of Jan Smuts.\n\nFollowing Bophuthatswana's independence from South Africa in 1977, then-president Lucas Mangope decided to re-introduce wildlife and convert the Pilanesberg into a game reserve. A planning committee was established to develop the game reserve, which was to include the whole of the Pilanesberg mountains. However, to facilitate this new designation, people residing in the area had to be re-settled. Following that, all buildings in the area, including the mission church on Driefontein but excluding the magistrate court building, were demolished. (The magistrate court building, a lovely Cape Dutch style structure, burned down in an accidental blaze in the 1980s. It was subsequently partially rebuilt. A new building, the Pilanesberg Centre, was also erected near where the court used to stand.) Additionally, all non-native flora were razed from the region in an attempt to ensure only authentic native plant life would exist in the park.\n\nFollowing negotiations with the Bophuthatswana government, the Bakgatla tribe, under Chief Tsidimane Pilane, agreed to the inclusion of the mountainous region of their property within the Pilanesberg reserve. The 60 families of the Bakgatla tribe farming and living near the mission station at Driefontein were re-settled under an agreement with the tribal authority. They were moved to a newly planned town on the farm Sandfontein, to the east of the Pilanesberg Game Reserve.\n\nThe Bophuthatswana administration also negotiated with the Bakubung tribe to purchase their land within the southern region of the park. The tribe was offered land on adjacent farms Zandrivierspoort, Palmietfontein, and Mahobieskraal, in exchange for portions of the farms Ledig, Koedoesfontein, and Wydhoek, on a hectare-for-hectare basis. As the agricultural value of the new land on offer exceeded that of the old, the Bakubung eventually accepted the offer. (Around the same time, Sun International obtained a ninety-nine-year leasehold over the adjacent farm Doornhoek and built the Sun City complex, which abuts the Pilanesberg reserve, along the common boundary with the farm Ledig.)\n\nIt was at this point that work began on Operation Genesis, which involved the reintroduction of long-vanished species after completion of approximately 100  km of fencing around the reserve's perimeter. This reintroduction was still ongoing when the Pilanesberg Game Park was opened in the early 1980s by President Mangope with Chief Pilane present.\n\n6000 animals were resettled into the park over the course of the early 1980s with Operation Genesis, which was featured on a two-part episode on Wild Kingdom in 1981. It was the largest game resettlement program in the history of the country. The 6000 animals were released into the quarantine area of 10 km² in groups and after a few weeks the fences were dropped. As the purpose of the park was a feeder for other parks no lions or cheetahs were brought in. However, leopards were naturally present as were brown hyena and mountain reedbuck. Currently, this is The Park in the world that has the highest concentration of hyena. Also brought in was a family of elephants. As no mature bulls were brought in as they were too large, the young bulls caused a bit of havoc and killed 17 rhinoceroses. The reason for this was there was no parental care and the young bulls came into adolescence at too young an age. However, by this time the transport techniques had improved so 6 older bulls were brought in from the Kruger. This suppressed the adolescence problem. The young culprits were all shot.\n\nThe creation of the Pilanesberg Game Reserve is considered one of the most ambitious programs of its kind to be undertaken anywhere in the world. Operation Genesis is still the largest game translocation undertaken in the world, and as a result, the park now has in excess of 10,000 animals.\n\nIn 1990 when Nelson Mandela was released, tourism in South Africa boomed. Camps and lodges were built on the park's perimeter and it became a tourist destination. In response to this, in 1993, the focus was changed from game animals to predators. Lions from the Etosha National Park in Namibia were relocated to this park despite serious concerns from the surrounding communities. Since then, the lions' numbers have been increasing in the park. A similar attempt with cheetahs from Namibia has had no such success.\n\nFollowing the attempted forceful reoccupation of Bophuthatswana by various factions in 1994, President Mangope was deposed and Bophuthatswana was reincorporated within the Republic of South Africa, placing the entire Pilanesberg Game Reserve officially within South Africa's borders.\n\nThe size of the park was increased from 552 to 572  km in May 2004 as part of a workable 10-year plan to establish a corridor between Pilanesberg and Madikwe Game Reserve. The 20  km that was added on the northwestern was the first bit from Pilanesberg's side. On the Madikwe's side, there have already been several additions towards the southeast. There are also several private owners dropping fences from the middle moving towards Pilanesberg and Madikwe. Property, that was selling for R30,000/km 2 years ago, is now selling for R500,000/km. Plans are being concluded to add a large piece of land to the park in the next two years. A recent poll conducted by the South African Tourism Board found that the Pilanesberg has jumped to the number 1 ranking on the list of most popular public game reserves in South Africa. This comes after many years of trailing the Kruger National Park. It is thought that Pilanesberg’s close proximity to Johannesburg coupled with the fact that it is malaria-free has led to its new-found popularity.\n\n\n"}

He served as private secretary to King William IV (when William was the Duke of Clarence) from 1827 to 1828, and Spencer was knighted for his services. He had a distinguished career in the Royal Navy and was well liked by the men he commanded.

{"id": "2058080", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2058080", "title": "MIDI keyboard", "text": "MIDI keyboard\n\nA MIDI keyboard or controller keyboard is typically a piano-style electronic musical keyboard, often with other buttons, wheels and sliders, used for sending MIDI signals or commands over a USB or MIDI 5-pin cable to other musical devices or computers. The basic MIDI keyboard does not produce sounds by itself, as it lacks an onboard sound module. Instead, MIDI information on keys or buttons the performer has pressed is sent to a receiving device capable of creating sound through modeling synthesis, sample playback, or an analog hardware instrument. The receiving device could be: \n\nWhile many digital and analog hardware keyboards in the aforementioned categories of digital piano, stage piano, and synthesizer can be used as MIDI controllers if they have MIDI capability, they often do not offer the same level of software integration and number of MIDI-mappable controls as a dedicated MIDI keyboard. MIDI keyboards are often utilized by individuals who work with DAWs and software instruments, from hobbyists to professional musicians working in recording studios or concert stages.\n\nBelow is an example of possible signal chains for a MIDI keyboard setup, with the goal of producing audio:\n\nMIDI Keyboard → 5-pin MIDI connector OR USB cable (will need a “B” connector, so \"USB A to B\" or \"USB C to B\", depending on computer) → computer running a DAW or a standalone VST/AU instrument OR a sound module OR a digital piano, stage piano, or synthesizer with MIDI capability → audio sound device (amplifier and speakers or headphones)\n\nWhen using a MIDI keyboard with a computer, class compliance must be taken into consideration. Class compliant means, essentially, \"plug and play\": upon being plugged in (USB or 5-pin) and powered up, MIDI keyboards that are class compliant should be recognized by any computer. MIDI keyboards and MIDI-capable hardware keyboards that are not class compliant require a keyboard-specific software driver to be installed on the computer in order for the keyboard to be recognized.\n\nWhile most MIDI keyboards produced in the 2010s are bus-powered, meaning their electrical power is supplied through the same USB connection that transfers MIDI data to the computer, some keyboards have the option of, or even require, using external power to operate. If using a traditional 5-pin MIDI connector instead of USB, the MIDI keyboard will likely require external power, as 5-pin MIDI connections cannot send the current needed to power a keyboard. If using a MIDI-capable hardware keyboard as a controller, one will also likely need external power, as most 2010s hardware keyboards rely on external power to function.\n\nThe action of a keyboard is the internal mechanism by which the keys work in order to move and produce sound, or, in this case, MIDI data. Two major types of keyboard actions exist: those derived from traditional, European, key-based instruments and non-traditional, contemporary designs that allow for expanded playing possibilities.\n\nMIDI controllers in this category have keys meant to resemble those of a grand piano, pipe organ, or synthesizer. Each of these action types is designed differently from the next, which, in turn, gives the action a particular \"feel\" to the player and lends it to an ideal usage.\n\nMany examples of the above actions, other than the waterfall keys, will include a small lip that protrudes from the top of the distal end of the white keys. This is emulating a customary design detail found on acoustic piano keys. Keyboards with any type of hammer action are most likely to display this lip.\n\nMost of these traditional key keyboards determine the attack velocity, sustain, and release of a note based on a calculation made between two sensors in each key. Some high-end keyboards now feature triple sensors, claiming improved accuracy in the tracking of key movement, which could translate into a more detailed, and perhaps more expressive, performance.\n\nSome MIDI keyboards are capable of sending aftertouch data, which can be assigned to a variety of effects, including: vibrato, pitch bends, and volume swells. Aftertouch data is generated when a key is depressed further into the keybed after its initial depression (without releasing the key). Keyboards can be equipped with channel or polyphonic aftertouch. The former sends only one aftertouch message, regardless of which key is depressed; the latter sends individual aftertouch messages for each key. Keyboards with every key aftertouch can enable the performer to create aftertouch effects on particular notes, such as emphasizing a melody note by continuing to press it.\n\nNot all MIDI keyboards utilize variations on the traditional piano-style action. One example of a MIDI keyboard with a non-traditional action is the Continuum Fingerboard, which is based on a \"fretless\" type keyboard interface, enabling portamento style note changes at will during play. Another unconventional MIDI keyboard is the Tonal Plexus keyboard, which provides for up to 1266 different pitches possible through the TPX6 1266 Keys (Microtonal MIDI Controller).\n\nThe Roli Seaboard line of MIDI keyboards has soft, squishy keys. All the above-mentioned MIDI keyboards take the concept of aftertouch to new heights: for instance, the Roli Seaboards can sense left-to-right, front-to-back, downward pressure/depth, and the rate of change in each of these parameters. All that information can then be used to control the behavior of a digital instrument.\n\nMIDI keyboards come in a wide range of sizes and number of keys, each with their own benefits and drawbacks. Generally speaking, some sizes are more common while others are less common, both in online stores and in bricks and mortar music stores.\n\n\n\nMost 25-key through 49-key keyboards come equipped with synth or semi-weighted actions. Most 49-key and 61-key keyboards come equipped with semi-weighted actions, but some may be found with hammer actions. Waterfall keys can be found occasionally on some 61-key and 73-key keyboards. Most 73-key through 88-key keyboards come equipped with hammer actions; however, some may be outfitted with semi-weighted actions.\n\nMIDI keyboards are usually full-size keys, like a grand piano. Some smaller keyboards use minikeys, which are smaller. Some tiny keyboards have flat minikeys which are even smaller.\n\nMany MIDI keyboards include control devices (other than the keys), which may allow for manipulation of DAW controls and/or the sound generator (either software or hardware). Provided they are mapped, or mappable, to the correct function, these allow the player to access a DAW or alter the sound of an instrument patch without taking hands off the keyboard.\n\nMIDI keyboards often have the ability to accept foot controllers, of which there are four main types: piano pedals, expression pedals, stomp boxes, and organ-style foot pedal keyboards.\n\n"}

Some stories were rewritten for this book. Later editions of the collection, with the additional story \"\"The Things That Are Gods\"\", are included in \"The Compleat Traveller in Black\".\n\nThe series deals with an unnamed protagonist, who \"has many names but only one nature\" and who bears a staff of curdled light, held together by interesting forces, travelling through a landscape in which Order and Chaos are in conflict. With this, and with the powers invested in him by \"the One for whom all things are neither possible or impossible\", he is enabled to counter Chaos, \nalthough he must do so in answer to the spoken wishes of the people around him, always with consequences they had not intended and often to their detriment. As an example, the Traveller hears the wish of a skilled assassin that he could get the fame to which his expertise should entitle him. Are not all great artists admired and respected? Is he not the cunningest hand with dagger, garotte, and subtle poison? The Traveller replies, as usual: \"As you wish, so be it.\" The following morning, the Traveller finds the assassin's body on a dunghill: his crimes have been discovered and properly attributed to him, and he has received the execution the law prescribes.\n\nAmong the Traveller's powers are the ability to bind and free Elementals, which in these tales are varied and more than five in number.\nThe Traveller's ultimate purpose is to reduce the power of Chaos, and thus the utility of magic, until everything should have a single nature.

He is married to Nina and they have two daughters, Tatiana (b. February 28, 1980) and Olga (b. July 1, 1984). Ilie Ilașcu worked as chief economist at \"Dnestr\" Research Institute in Tiraspol. Ilașcu became known for his opposition to Moldovan Communist Party politics regarding the Moldovan language, for openly advocating the usage of Latin script and for recognition of a Moldovan-Romanian identity, as well as for giving Moldovan the status of official language.\n\nHis opponents nicknamed him \"glavnîi extremist\" (chief extremist) instead of \"glavnîi economist\" (chief economist). In January 1989 he was one of the founders of a Moldovan association in Tiraspol. On July 9, 1989 he was arrested for the first time, being released with excuses after few days. Also in 1989 he was dismissed from his job, but was able to regain his position after appealing to the prosecutor office. On September 5, 1989 as he spoke at a meeting in Tiraspol in favour of the language laws passed by the Moldovan parliament, he was taken away by policemen, who needed to protect him from the crowd of political opponents.\n\nStarting with 1989, he was the president of the Tiraspol branch of the \"Moldovan Popular Front\", which advocated the union of Moldova and Romania.\n\nHe is a leader of the Democratic Forum of Romanians in Moldova. In 2010, Ilașcu announced he will support Mihai Ghimpu and the Liberal Party.\n\nOn June 2, 1992, he and three more ethnic Romanians (Andrei Ivanțoc, Alexandru Leșco and Tudor Petrov Popa) were arrested by the breakaway Transnistrian government and charged with the murder of two separatist officials.\n\nOn December 9, 1993, the Supreme Court of Transnistria found him guilty of a number of offences defined in the Criminal Code of the Moldovan Soviet Socialist Republic, including incitement to commit an offence against national security, organisation of activities with the aim of committing extremely dangerous offences against the State, murdering a representative of the State with the aim of spreading terror, premeditated murder, unlawfully requisitioning means of transport, deliberate destruction of another's property and illegal or unauthorised use of ammunition or explosives.\n\nIlașcu was sentenced to be shot and the other three defendants were sentenced to hard labour for terms between 12 and 15 years. They had no right of appeal.\nDuring the trial, the defendants were kept in reinforced iron cages, as they were considered \"extremely dangerous\". This decision was contested by various international human rights organizations, which doubted the fairness of the trial and alleged that they were prosecuted only because they were members of the Tiraspol branch of the Popular Front, a Moldovan party which favours a union with Romania. For years he was kept in solitary confinement without access to family and medical assistance.\n\nWhile in the Transnistrian prison, Ilașcu was elected twice to the Moldovan Parliament on the lists of the Democratic Christian Popular Front, in 1994 and 1998 election.\n\nIn October 2000, he received Romanian citizenship, after which he renounced his Moldovan citizenship. In the same year, he was elected to the Senate of Romania for the Greater Romania Party, representing Bacău County. Reelected in 2004, Ilașcu served as a member of the Senate until 2008.\n\nIlașcu was eventually released on May 5, 2001, two years after he filed an application with the European Court of Human Rights and following a verdict of the European Court for Human Rights, where he had sued both Russia and Moldova.\n\nThe other three members of the group were released as follows:\n\nRussian authorities denied any involvement in the affair.\n\nThe European Court of Human Rights judged in 2004 that the authorities have infringed the human rights (as defined by the European Convention on Human Rights) of Ilie Ilașcu and the other three people arrested by the Transnistrian government. The ruling came after a legal process that began in 1999. The court ruled that the Supreme Court of the PMR was not an actual court with any jurisdiction over the detainees, and its findings that led to their conviction were not considered. Under the court's decision, Russia was to pay Ilașcu 187,000 euros. Alexandru Tănase was a lawyer for Ilașcu.\n\n\n"}

As he sailed northwesterly through the passage, Dampier charted and named various islands which lay between the Dampier and Vitiaz Straits: Sir George Rook's Island (later Rooke Island, now Umboi Island), Long Island (Arop Island) and Crown Island.\n\nDuring the New Guinea Campaign (1942-1945), control of the Vitiaz Strait took on strategic military importance. The Japanese landed two battalions at Lae and Salamaua on the Huon Gulf on 8 March 1942 giving them control of the Dampier and Vitiaz Straits. Japanese forces lost control of the Vitiaz and Dampier Straits after the capture of Finschhafen by Australian troops and the later landing of American forces on New Britain (December 1943). General Douglas MacArthur announced that Rooke Island (now called Umboi Island) had been occupied on Saturday 12 February 1944 by American forces who met no opposition. Allied control was made secure by landings in the Admiralty Islands on 29 February 1944.\n"}

The number of movable blocks determine how difficult it is to trap the cats, while the unmovable blocks make it hard to move blocks around and hinder navigation.\n\nDuring each level, a clock ticks away until it reaches a certain point, which is represented by a blue line. When this happens, more cats are spawned into the level, making it more difficult, but also increasing the potential reward. After the new cats have spawned, the blue line moves further around the clock and it resumes ticking.\n\nPoints are awarded for completing a level and for eating pieces of cheese. Players are awarded extra points based on how quickly they complete the level and the difficulty involved. The best scores are displayed on the high score table, which shows the best games overall and from the past 24 hours.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2058124", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2058124", "title": "North Carolina Transportation Museum", "text": "North Carolina Transportation Museum\n\nThe North Carolina Transportation Museum is a museum in Spencer, North Carolina. It is a collection of automobiles, aircraft, and railway vehicles. The museum is located at the former Southern Railway's 1896-era Spencer Shops and devotes much of its space to the state's railroad history. The museum has the largest collection of rail relics in the Carolinas. Its Back Shop building of nearly three stories high is most notable for its size of two football fields long.\n\nThe museum was founded in 1977, when the Southern Railway deeded of land to North Carolina for a transportation museum. Two years later, another was added to the original donation; the entirety of the railway's largest former steam locomotive repair shops. The museum's first exhibit called People, Places and Time opened in 1983. The museum grew over the years, most notably in 1996, with the opening of Barber Junction, a relocated railroad depot from some 30 miles away, and the newly renovated Bob Julian Roundhouse. Barber Junction serves as the museum's Visitor's Center and departure point for the on-site train ride. The Bob Julian Roundhouse serves as the hub for most of the museum's railroad exhibits, but also includes aviation exhibits and site history.\n\nSeveral bays of the Spencer Shops roundhouse, built in 1924, are devoted to locomotives and rolling stock in the museum collection restored by volunteers. It was here that steam locomotives from 1924-1953 were repaired. In the first 16 stalls, visitors can walk among the massive locomotives and rail cars on display in an open-air setting. Moving into the enclosed Elmer Lam gallery in stalls 17 through 20, aviation exhibits dominate, with a full size replica Wright Flyer, Piedmont Airlines exhibits, and more. Moving into the restoration shop occupying stalls 21 through 32, visitors may also see volunteers working on various railroad pieces, and even manufacturing parts. The remaining five stalls are dedicated to additional enclosed exhibits.\n\nThe museum is the largest repository of rail relics in North and South Carolina and averages 80,000 visitors annually. About three-thousand people were employed to repair the trains at the Spencer Shops in the first half of the twentieth century. The Flue Shop, where all the flues for steam engines were formerly produced, has become the Bumper To Bumper exhibit, featuring vintage and antique cars. These include: several Model Ts, a Model A, and even a Ford Model R (the 1907 predecessor to the Model T). A Highway Patrol car from 1935, a Divco Milk Truck, a Lincoln Continental and others are also part of the museum's collection.\n\nIn 2005, the museum's Back Shop underwent a massive renovation, which included repairs to the roof, re-pointing of the brick, and a stabilization of the building's floor. This building, where the full overhaul of steam locomotives once took place, is most notable for its size. It is two football fields long and nearly three stories tall. However, it may be most notable for the words \"Be Careful,\" standing some three feet tall, visible from nearly anywhere on the north end of the site. In 2009, the museum opened the Back Shop to the public for the first time, with an access ramp on the south end. In 2017 the backshop was opened completely, allowing more exhibits.\n\nThe museum has a heritage railroad, which operates passenger excursion trains on a seasonal schedule. Trains are usually powered by the Norfolk and Western #620, however, at times the Southern #6133 or Southern #2601 is used. These two engines also assist in special events where two or more trains are operating. Though the museum has no operating steam locomotives of its own, but occasionally has visiting steam locomotives such as Lehigh Valley Coal 0-6-0T #126, Flag Coal Company 0-4-0T #75, and Jeddo Coal Company 0-4-0T #85, all owned by the Gramling Locomotive Works of Ashley, IN.\n\nIn 2012 and 2013, the Tennessee Valley Railroad Museum's Southern 2-8-0 #630 visited the museum offering employee and public excursions to Barber, NC and Winston-Salem, NC. From 2014 to 2015, the Norfolk and Western 611 (owned by the Virginia Museum of Transportation) was restored to operating condition at the museum, and ran public excursions departing from Spencer in 2016 and 2017. Destinations included Lynchburg, VA, Asheville, NC, Charlotte, NC, and Greensboro, NC. The #611 has also been used on site for \"At The Throttle\" and \"Be The Fireman\" sessions, Cab Rides, Caboose Rides, and it has pulled the Museum's Passenger Train.\n\nAlso in 2015, the American 4-4-0 \"Leviathan\" locomotive visited the museum for the Lincoln Funeral Train event, commemorating 150 years since that event took place. Tickets can purchased to ride the roundhouse turntable.\n\nThe museum hosts a number of annual events and some one-time railroading events that bring rail fans from across the country. In 2012, the Bob Julian Roundhouse was the stage for all 20 of Norfolk Southern's Heritage locomotives during a two-day photographic event. In 2014, the museum hosted Streamliners at Spencer, with notable 1930s - 1950s era locomotives gathered around the Bob Julian Roundhouse turntable for a four-day event. Streamliners at Spencer included the Class J 611 Steam Passenger locomotive, visiting from the Virginia Museum of Transportation. This notable locomotive remained in Spencer for repair and restoration work to allow it to once again pull passenger excursions across the southeast.\n\nAnnual events include Day Out With Thomas, the Polar Express, Fire Truck Show, Automobile shows, A Tractor Show, the Harvest Festival, the Easter Bunny Express, Valentine Wine and Dine trains, and the new Brew and Choo Beer Train. The NCTM is also host to Boy Scout Rail Camp, which allows for Boy Scouts and Leaders to camp out on the historic facility and earn the railroading merit badge. It is the largest railroad related scouting event in the nation.\n\nThe museum contains steam and diesel locomotives.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The ship was acquired by the United States Navy from the Southern Pacific Company on 6 April 1898. The ship was renamed and commissioned at New York on 14 April 1898, Commander Willard H. Brownson in command.\n\nAfter fitting out as an auxiliary cruiser, the ship joined in the Spanish–American War and patrolled the coastal waters between Block Island and Cape Henlopen until 27 May. That day, \"Yankee\" stopped at Tompkinsville, New York to coal ship. On 29 May, she returned to sea and shaped a southerly course to join the fleet off Cuba. \"En route\", she touched briefly at St. Nicholas Mole, Haiti, on the evening of 2 June and then continued on toward Cuba. Early the following morning, \"Yankee\" joined the blockade off Santiago de Cuba and conducted patrols there for the next five days.\n\nOn the morning of the 6 June, she dueled shore batteries briefly and, near Santiago and on 7 June, joined \"Marblehead\" and \"St. Louis\" for a cable cutting incursion into Guantanamo Bay. While \"St. Louis\" dragged for and cut the three cables, \"Yankee\" and \"Marblehead\" covered her activities by engaging the Spanish gunboats \"Alvarado\" and \"Sandoval\". After putting the Spanish gunboats to flight, the two American warships turned their attention toward the fort at Caimanera which had been making a nuisance of itself with its single large-caliber gun—a venerable, smooth-bore muzzleloader. As \"Yankee\" and \"Marblehead\" silenced their last adversary, \"St. Louis\" completed her cable-cutting mission; and the three ships exited the bay.\n\n\"Yankee\" then briefly resumed blockade duty off Santiago, but on the 8 June got underway for St. Nicholas Mole with dispatches. On 9 June, just before she arrived at her destination, the auxiliary cruiser stopped two merchantmen and inspected them. They turned out to be the Norwegian SS \"Norse\" and the British SS \"Ely\", so \"Yankee\" allowed them to proceed on their way. She completed her mission at Haiti and returned to Santiago early the following morning. At about noon on 10 June, \"Yankee\" set a course for Port Antonio, Jamaica, to deliver dispatches and to search for the suspected blockade runner SS \"Purissima Concepcion\". After delivering the dispatches at Port Antonio on 10 June. and visiting Montego Bay in search of \"Purissima Concepcion\", the warship returned to the Santiago area on 12 June. However, that same day, she received orders to move again, this time to Cienfuegos, about halfway up the southern coast of Cuba from Santiago, to stand guard there against \"Purissima Concepcion\"s expected run.\n\nThe auxiliary cruiser arrived off Cienfuegos on 13 June and began patrolling the approaches to the harbor. At about 13:15 that afternoon, she spied a steamer standing out of the port toward her. Identifying the stranger as the Spanish gunboat \"Diego Velázquez\", \"Yankee\" cleared for action and closed the enemy. At about range, the American ship put her helm over, unmasked her port battery, and opened fire. The Spanish gunboat, markedly inferior to \"Yankee\" in armament, opted for a running fight in which she presented the smallest possible target and in which \"Yankee\" could bring only one or two of her guns to bear without turning away from her target's course. Consequently, \"Diego Velázquez\" came about and headed back toward Cienfuegos, firing as she went. \"Yankee\" followed, shooting her port forecastle gun constantly and periodically turning to starboard to unmask her entire port battery. Ultimately, \"Diego Velázquez\" reached safety under the protection of Sabanilla Battery, and the gunboat \"Lince\" came out to join her in the fray. \"Yankee\" continued to fire her port battery as she passed the two gunboats and shore battery abeam at about range. She completed one pass and then put the helm to port and came about for another pass, this time bringing her starboard battery into action for the first time. During \"Yankee\"s second pass, \"Diego Velázquez\" and \"Lince\" abandoned the fight and sought refuge in Cienfuegos harbor. \"Yankee\" continued firing on Sabanilla Battery until 15:00 and then withdrew to her blockade station off the harbor.\n\n\"Yankee\" remained off Cienfuegos for two days. On 14 June, there was a brief moment of anxiety when a large man-of-war started out of the harbor. \"Yankee\" cleared for action and stood in toward the warship, but all hands breathed a sigh of relief when the newcomer was identified as the neutral German SMS \"Geier\". The following afternoon, the auxiliary cruiser gave up her vigil for \"Purissima Concepcion\" off Cienfuegos and set a course back to the eastern end of Cuba. She rejoined the Santiago blockade on 16 June but put into the anchorage at Guantanamo Bay the following day to take on coal. Late on the 18 June, the ship returned to sea bound once more for blockade duty off Cienfuegos. On the 19 June, during the passage from Guantanamo Bay to Cienfuegos, \"Yankee\" stopped and inspected two sailing vessels—a British schooner and a Norwegian bark—and a steamer, the British SS \"Adula\". All three had their papers in order, and the auxiliary cruiser allowed them to proceed unmolested. That evening, she arrived off Cienfuegos and began cruising on blockade station between that port and Casilda.\n\nAt about 08:30 on the morning of 20 June, \"Yankee\" sighted a steamer lying in Casilda harbor closely fitting the description of \"Purissima Concepcion\". The American ship stood in as close to the shoals as she dared and then fired a shot across the steamer's bow in an unsuccessful effort to make her show her colors. Instead, the merchantman began preparations for getting underway. Yankee responded by opening a steady fire at extreme range. As the supposed Spanish steamer moved farther into shoal water and disappeared behind some islets, \"Yankee\" shifted fire to an enemy gunboat and a floating battery, both of which had opened an ineffective fire upon her. The extreme range—in excess of —made the gunfire from both sides so ineffective that \"Yankee\" broke off the engagement and resumed her patrols between Casilda and Cienfuegos. The auxiliary cruiser continued her blockade of that stretch of the Cuban coast until 24 June, when her dwindling supply of coal forced her to head for Key West. \"En route\" to that base, she visited the Isle of Pines where she captured and destroyed five Spanish fishing vessels on the 25 June.\n\n\"Yankee\" arrived in Key West on 27 June and began taking on coal. She completed her refueling operation and departed Key West on 3 July, bound for New York, where she arrived two days later. She remained at New York until the 12 July, taking on ammunition for transportation to the Eastern Squadron on the Cuban blockade. On 13 July, she reached Norfolk, where she spent another four days taking on additional ammunition for the ships of the blockading squadron. \"Yankee\" left Hampton Roads on 17 July and arrived in Guantanamo Bay four days later. There, she began the tedious but dangerous job of transferring her cargo of ammunition to the various warships in the anchorage. The ship remained at Guantanamo Bay until 11 August, when she resumed blockade duty, patrolling initially in search of the armed merchant ship \"Montserrat\". Three days later, while she cruised the northern coast of Cuba, \"Yankee\" received word of the cessation of hostilities in response to Spain's suit for peace. She reentered Guantanamo Bay on the afternoon of 15 August and remained there until the 24 August when she headed home.\n\n\"Yankee\" stopped briefly at Tompkinsville at the end of August and then made a round-trip voyage to League Island, and back to Tompkinsville at the beginning of September. She returned to League Island on 19 September. There, her crew of New York Naval Militia reservists left the ship to return home via train for mustering out. Though she remained in commission technically until decommissioned on 16 March 1899, \"Yankee\" spent the interim at League Island. That location also remained her home for the more than three years she spent in reserve. Her inactivity ended when she was placed back in commission on 1 May 1903, Commander G. P. Colvocoressee in command.\n\nFollowing recommissioning, \"Yankee\" served along the east coast between Chesapeake Bay and the Maine coast training landsmen in the ways of the sea. Early in December 1903, she headed south for winter maneuvers and gunnery drills with the North Atlantic Fleet in the gulf and the Caribbean around Hispaniola. \"Yankee\" served at Santo Domingo to help restore order and to straighten out the country's financial muddle. On 1 February, the ship was fired upon by rebel troops. In response, the United States sent the protected cruisers USS \"Columbia\" and USS \"Newark\". In the Santo Domingo Affair, the two ships bombarded the city and sent a landing party ashore on 11 February.\n\nAfter visiting a number of West Indian ports in conjunction with the exercises, she returned north late in March 1904, and on 6 April, was moored to a pier at League Island where she remained until October. On 16 October, she got underway for Newport News to embark 400 landsmen there before resuming her training schedule.\n\nIn December, \"Yankee\" made a round-trip voyage to Panama to exchange marine garrisons in the Canal Zone. She disembarked some of the returning marines at Hampton Roads on 31 December 1904 and on New Year's Day 1905 pushed on toward Tompkinsville to deliver the remainder. After a return voyage to Newport News, she headed for League Island where she entered the navy yard for repairs on 13 January.\n\nThe ship completed those repairs on 9 March and loaded men, stores, and ammunition at Tompkinsville from the 10 March to 12 March before getting underway for the West Indies. For the next seventeen months, the island of Hispaniola, Cuba's neighbor to the east, became her center of operations. Successive coups since assassination of the dictator Heureaux in 1899 had added civil strife and anarchy to the list of woes of a country already racked by desperate financial problems. \"Yankee\" spent most of her time in Dominican waters and ports, departing infrequently for replenishment stops at such American bases as Key West and Guantanamo Bay and made one voyage back to New York in July 1905 for repairs at the New York Navy Yard.\n\nOn 20 August 1906 she had a very minor collision with a float being towed by in the East River. The ship, by then classified as a transport, left for Santo Domingo on 21 August 1906 and after participating in the Presidential Naval Review held at Oyster Bay from 2 September to 4 September, she unloaded stores at New York in preparation for inactivation. On 25 September, \"Yankee\" was again placed out of commission at Portsmouth, New Hampshire. Sometime during the next two years, she was moved to the Boston Navy Yard, for it was at that location that she was once again commissioned on 15 June 1908, Commander Charles C. Marsh in command.\n\nAfter shakedown early in July, the ship resumed a familiar duty—training. With naval militia reservists or Naval Academy midshipmen embarked, she spent the summer of 1908 cruising the Atlantic coast between Boston and Chesapeake Bay. On 23 September 1908, during one such training exercise, \"Yankee\" ran aground on Spindle Rock near Hen and Chickens lightship. She remained there until refloated on 4 December. Her reprieve however, was short-lived. While being towed to New Bedford on the day she was refloated, she sank in Buzzards Bay. \"Yankee\"s name was finally struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 17 April 1912.\n"}

Built as El Sud\" in 1892 by Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company, in Newport News, Virginia for the Southern Pacific Railroad's Morgan Line. The Navy acquired \"El Sud\" on 6 April 1898, at the beginning of the Spanish–American War and renamed her \"Yosemite\". It commissioned her on 13 April 1898 under Commander William H. Emory.\n\nAfter fitting out at League Island, Philadelphia, and at Newport News, Virginia, \"Yosemite\" departed Hampton Roads on 30 May for duty with the Eastern Squadron off the coast of Cuba. She stopped at Key West, Florida, for five days and then headed for Havana on 7 June, arriving there the same day. \"Yosemite\", however, kept on the move. She left Havana the next day; visited Santiago and Guantanamo Bay on the 10th; and then, after a brief return to Santiago, headed for Kingston, Jamaica, on the 12th. The auxiliary cruiser spent the night of 16 and 17 June at Kingston and returned to Cuban waters on the 19th. On 23 June, she cleared the Guantanamo Bay area for San Juan, Puerto Rico. She arrived off San Juan on the 25th to participate in the blockade of that port.\n\nSoon after her arrival, \"Yosemite\" intercepted the Spanish steamer SS \"Antonio Lopez\" at 5:20 AM on 28 June when the latter tried to run into San Juan, beginning the Third Battle of San Juan. In spite of heavy covering fire from enemy shore batteries and gunboats \"Ponce de Leon\", \"Isabella II\", and \"Concha\", \"Yosemite\" attacked the blockade runner and succeeded in pounding her almost to pieces. She expended 251 5-inch (127-mm) shells in the encounter. At the conclusion of that encounter, the auxiliary cruiser pulled back out of range of the gunboats and their protecting shore batteries to resume her blockade station. She concluded that assignment on 15 July and, after a three-day visit to St. Thomas in the Danish West Indies (Virgin Islands), headed back toward the Virginia Capes on the 18th.\n\n\"Yosemite\" arrived at Hampton Roads on 22 July and remained there until 15 August, two days after hostilities ceased. For almost a month, she operated along the Atlantic coast. Then, between 8 and 19 September, the auxiliary made a voyage to Haiti and then resumed east coast operations briefly before putting in at League Island on 23 September—apparently for repairs because she remained until late in December. \"Yosemite\" departed League Island on 29 December and arrived in Norfolk on the 30th. The ship remained there until 8 April 1899 at which time she got underway for New York. Following a month-long stay, the auxiliary cruiser departed New York on 10 May for duty in the Mediterranean Sea, the Suez Canal, and the Indian Ocean. She arrived in the Mariana Islands, at San Luis d'Apra on Guam, on 7 August.\nShe spent the next eight months at Guam surveying the harbor and serving as station ship. On 17 April 1900, \"Yosemite\" departed Guam for a voyage to Japan where she underwent repairs at Yokohama and Uraga. Following a brief visit to Nagasaki on 7 and 8 June, the ship headed for the Philippines on the 9th. She arrived in Cavite on the 14th and began additional repairs. On 30 June, \"Yosemite\" completed repairs and set a course for Guam. She reached the harbor at San Luis d'Apra on 6 July and resumed duty as station ship. Between 2 and 29 August, she made a round-trip voyage back to Cavite to pick up stores for Guam. Upon her return to Guam, \"Yosemite\" resumed station-ship duties.\n\nOn 13 November 1900, the former auxiliary cruiser was blown from her anchorage by a particularly violent Typhoon-first ashore and then out to sea from Apra harbor. For two days, her crew fought heroically to save their ship, but she shipped water badly and, due to a damaged screw, made only two knots headway even after the storm passed. Finally, after the weather abated completely, her crew was taken off by the U.S. Navy collier , and \"Yosemite\" was scuttled.\n\n"}

It stars Helen Slater, Keith Gordon, Christian Slater and Richard Bradford.\n\nBillie Jean Davy, a teenager in Corpus Christi, Texas, rides with her younger brother, Binx on his Honda Elite Scooter to a local lake to go swimming. At a drive-in, Hubie Pyatt, a rowdy local teen, and his friends hit on Billie Jean, but Binx humiliates him by throwing a milkshake in his face. Later on at the lake, as Billie Jean tells Binx about the weather in Vermont, a place he has always wanted to visit, Hubie steals Binx's scooter.\n\nAs Binx goes to retrieve his scooter later that night, Billie Jean goes to the authorities with her friends Putter and Ophelia. Detective Ringwald is sympathetic but urges them to wait the problem out. When Billie Jean returns home, she finds Binx beaten, and his scooter severely damaged. The next day, Billie Jean, Binx and Ophelia go to Mr. Pyatt's shop to get the amount of $608 to repair the scooter. While initially appearing helpful and understanding, Mr. Pyatt propositions Billie Jean and then attempts to rape her.\n\nMeanwhile, Binx has found a gun, and when Billie Jean flees from the back of the store, clearly distressed, he turns it on Mr. Pyatt. Mr. Pyatt tells him the gun is unloaded, but Binx fires it, wounding Mr. Pyatt in the shoulder. They race away from the shop and become fugitives.\n\nBy the time Ringwald realizes that he made a mistake not listening to Billie Jean, the situation is spinning out of control. Billie Jean wants only the cash to fix her brother's scooter and an apology from Mr. Pyatt. With help from Lloyd Muldaur, the teenage son of the district attorney, who voluntarily becomes her \"hostage\", Billie Jean makes a video of her demands, featuring herself with her long, blonde hair chopped into a crew cut. As media coverage increases, Billie Jean becomes a teen icon, and young fans follow her every movement. Facing uncertain dangers, both physical and legal, Billie Jean is forced to turn her friends Putter and Ophelia in to the cops for their safety. When Ringwald arrives and demands to know where Billie Jean is, Ophelia defiantly replies, \"Everywhere!\"\n\nMr. Pyatt issues a bounty for her apprehension, and Billie Jean realizes the best plan is to turn herself in. To avoid attracting too much attention, she and her brother Binx both arrive in disguise. But the disguise is blown, and the situation descends into a riot, which results in Binx getting shot. As Binx is taken away in an ambulance, Billie Jean confronts Mr. Pyatt and gets him to admit his actions that led to him being shot. He gives Billie Jean the money, but she refuses to take it all and rams her knee into his crotch, sending him sprawling to the ground and knocking over a nearby torch. She then tell him to keep his money and to go buy somebody else, throwing the money back in his face. Mr. Pyatt gets to his feet as the overturned torch begins to set his merchandise stands on fire, The onlookers (including Hubie), seeing how Billie Jean was exploited and their indirect involvement in it, throw all the Billie Jean merchandise into the rapidly growing fire and leave in disgust. As the merchandise stands burn down, Billie Jean departs as well, but not before thanking Ringwald and giving Floyd a kiss. Later, Billie Jean and Binx (in an arm sling) are hitchhiking in Vermont. Binx, after complaining about the cold, admires a red snowmobile.\n\n\nCraig Safan produced the original score for the film writing a couple of synthpop-styled instrumental tracks. Furthermore, some rock songs were added to the soundtrack which had never been officially released. The movie's theme song \"Invincible\" by Pat Benatar peaked at number 10 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 in September 1985, while Billy Idol's reissue of his single \"Rebel Yell\" climbed up to number six on the UK Singles Chart in October 1985.\n\n\nJay Boyar of the \"Orlando Sentinel\" stated that the film \"has quite a lot going for it\" and \"doesn't get many points for finesse, but it has energy, good performances and more wit than you'd expect.\" He added, \"One reason that sections of the movie are effective is that Helen Slater has enough style and presence to be believable as a young woman who is taken for a modern Joan of Arc. As Billie Jean, she's got the clear eyes of a dreamer and the toughness of a winner.\" Janet Maslin of \"The New York Times\" said that the film is \"competently made, sometimes attractively acted (particularly by Peter Coyote)... and bankrupt beyond belief. It's hard to imagine that even the film makers, let alone audiences, can believe in a sweet, selfless heroine who just can't help becoming a superstar.\" The film holds a 40% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 10 reviews.\n\nThe film was released on Betamax and VHS home video in 1985.\n\nIn 2009, Sony Pictures Home Entertainment released in Europe a Spanish-titled DVD \"La Leyenda de Billie Jean\", with 4:3 open matte image, but without any bonus material.

{"id": "2058228", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2058228", "title": "Twelf", "text": "Twelf\n\nTwelf is an implementation of the logical framework LF developed by Frank Pfenning and Carsten Schürmann at Carnegie Mellon University . It is used for logic programming and for the formalization of programming language theory.\n\nAt its simplest, a Twelf program (called a \"signature\") is a collection of declarations of type families and constants that inhabit those type families. For example, the following is the standard definition of the natural numbers, with codice_1 standing for zero and codice_2 the successor operator.\n\nHere codice_3 is a type, and codice_1 and codice_2 are constant terms. As a dependently typed system, types can be indexed by terms, which allows the definition of more interesting type families (relations). Here is a definition of addition:\n\nThe type family codice_6 is read as a relation between three natural numbers codice_7, codice_8 and codice_9, such that M + N = P. We then give the constants that define the relation: codice_10 indicates that any natural number codice_7 plus zero is still codice_7. The quantifier codice_13 can be read as \"for all codice_7 of type codice_3\".\n\nThe constant codice_16 defines the case for when the second argument is the successor of some other number codice_8 (see pattern matching). The result is the successor of codice_9, where codice_9 is the sum of codice_7 and codice_8. This recursive call is made via the subgoal codice_22, introduced with codice_23. The arrow can be understood operationally as Prolog's codice_24, or as logical implication (\"if M + N = P, then M + (s N) = (s P)\"), or most faithfully to the type theory, as the type of the constant codice_16 (\"when given a term of type codice_22, return a term of type codice_27\").\n\nTwelf features type reconstruction and supports implicit parameters, so in practice one usually does not need to explicitly write codice_13 (etc.) above.\n\nThese simple examples do not display LF's higher-order features, nor any of its theorem checking capabilities. See the Twelf distribution for its included examples.\n\nTwelf is used in several different ways.\n\nTwelf signatures can be executed via a search procedure, so Twelf can be used as a logic programming language. Its core is more sophisticated than Prolog, since it is higher-order and dependently typed, but it is restricted to pure operators: there is no cut or other extralogical operators (such as ones for performing I/O) as are often found in Prolog implementations, which may make it less well-suited for practical logic programming applications. Some of the use of cut rule as used in Prolog is obtained through the ability to declare that certain operators belong to deterministic type families, which avoids recalculation. Also, like λProlog, Twelf generalizes the Horn clauses underlying Prolog to hereditary Harrop formulas, which allow for logically well-founded operational notions of fresh-name generation and scoped extension of the clause database.\nTwelf's main use today is as a system for formalizing mathematics (especially the metatheory of programming languages). Used this way it is closely related to Coq and Isabelle/HOL/HOL Light. However, unlike those systems, Twelf proofs are typically developed by hand. Despite this, for the problem domains at which it excels, Twelf proofs are often shorter and easier to develop than in the automated, general-purpose systems.\n\nTwelf is particularly well suited to the encoding of programming languages and logics, because it has a built-in notion of binding and substitution. Most logics and programming languages of interest make use of binding and substitution. When implemented in Twelf, binders can often be directly encoded using the technique of higher-order abstract syntax (HOAS), in which the meta-language (Twelf) binders are used to represent the object-level binders. As a consequence, standard theorems such as type-preserving substitution and alpha conversion come \"for free\".\n\nTwelf has been used to formalize many different logics and programming languages (examples are included with the distribution). Among the larger projects are a proof of safety for the Standard ML programming language, a foundational typed assembly language system from CMU, and a foundational proof carrying code system from Princeton.\n\nTwelf is written in Standard ML and binaries are available for Linux and Microsoft Windows. it is under active development (mostly at Carnegie Mellon University).\n\n"}

Brisebois (7 March 1850 – 13 February 1890) was a politician, soldier, and police officer with the North-West Mounted Police (NWMP) of Canada. He was born 7 March 1850 at South Durham, Canada East, now Durham-Sud, Quebec.\n\nBrisebois showed himself to be an excellent student and was fluently bilingual in English and French. At 15 he dropped out of school to fight for the Union Army in the American Civil War and went on to spend a further three years serving in Italy with the volunteer unit \"Devils of the Good Lord\". Upon his return to Canada he worked on the first census in Canada.\n\nIn 1873, he was chosen by Sir John A. Macdonald, because of his military experience (and Conservative politics), to be one of nine commanding officers with the new NWMP. He distinguished himself as a trainer, and showed remarkable foresight by attempting to enforce strict restrictions on buffalo hunting (over-hunting, among other reasons, led to a massive decline in the buffalo population). However, he was criticized for an inability to maintain discipline among his men, and his decision to take a common-law Métis wife. As his division's insubordination reached near-mutiny proportions, he clashed more and more with his direct superior James Farquharson Macleod. On Macleod's suggestion, Fort Brisebois was renamed to Fort Calgary (now Calgary, Alberta) in June 1876, and Brisebois resigned in August.\n\nBrisebois then rode, alone, 1200 kilometres to Winnipeg. Eventually, he returned to Quebec, and helped a Conservative candidate, Désiré-Olivier Bourbeau defeat a Liberal cabinet minister named Wilfrid Laurier (the future Prime Minister). In 1880, he was made the registrar of land titles, and assigned to Minnedosa, Manitoba. He and his wife Adelle (whom he had legally married sometime after resigning from the NWMP) led an active social life, founding a snowshoe club and holding Roman Catholic church services in their home. During the Northwest Rebellion of 1885, he helped mobilize militia units.\n\nHe died of a heart attack in Winnipeg in 1890, and was buried in St. Boniface, Manitoba.\n\n"}

{"id": "2058250", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2058250", "title": "Wildlife of Costa Rica", "text": "Wildlife of Costa Rica\n\nThe Wildlife of Costa Rica comprises all naturally occurring animals, fungi and plants that reside in this Central American country. Costa Rica supports an enormous variety of wildlife, due in large part to its geographic position between the North and South American continents, its neotropical climate, and its wide variety of habitats. Costa Rica is home to more than 500,000 species, which represents nearly 5% of the total species estimated worldwide, making Costa Rica one of the 20 countries with the highest biodiversity in the world. Of these 500,000 species, a little more than 300,000 are insects.\n\nOne of the principal sources of Costa Rica's biodiversity is that the country, together with the land now considered Panama, formed a bridge connecting the North and South American continents approximately three to five million years ago. This bridge allowed the very different flora and fauna of the two continents to mix.\n\nCosta Rica is considered to possess the highest density of biodiversity of any country worldwide. While encompassing just one third of a percent of Earth's landmass, approximately the size of West Virginia, Costa Rica contains four percent of species estimated to exist on the planet. Hundreds of these species are endemic to Costa Rica, meaning they exist nowhere else on earth. These endemic species include frogs, snakes, lizards, finches, hummingbirds, gophers, mice, cichlids, and gobies among many more.\nCosta Rica's biodiversity can be attributed to the variety of ecosystems within the country. Tropical rainforests, deciduous forests, Atlantic and Pacific coastline, cloud forests, and mangrove forests are all represented throughout the 19,730 square miles of Costa Rica's landmass. The ecological regions are twelve climatic zones. This variation provides numerous niches which are filled by a diversity of species.\n\nCosta Rica demonstrates biodiversity conservation for developing countries. Over twenty-seven percent of the country's land has a protected status as national parks, wildlife refuges, forest preserves, and more. The Costa Rican government is active in protecting its biodiversity for the ecological services they provide. The government imposes a five percent tax on gasoline to generate revenue to pay landowners to refrain from clear-cutting on their land and instead to create tree plantations. This provides Costa Ricans, or “Ticos” as they call themselves, incentive to become active tree farmers instead of cattle ranchers. Tree farms provide some habitat for wildlife, enabling some measure of biodiversity to remain in these areas despite humans’ use of these natural resources.\n\nCosta Rica's biodiversity contributes to the numerous ecological services the environment provides. Every aspect of the ecosystem from the different species of plants to the diversity of animal species contributes to natural services like water purification, provision of food, fuel, fiber, and biochemicals, nutrient cycling, pollination and seed dispersal, and climate regulation, just to name a few. As the diversity of species increases, more of these services can be provided and to a greater extent.\n\nBiodiversity has contributed to the economy of Costa Rica. Ecotourism brings in 1.92 billion dollars in revenue for the country. Ecotourism is defined as \"tourism directed toward exotic, often threatened, natural environments, especially to support conservation efforts and observe wildlife.\" Costa Rica's abundant biodiversity makes the country an attractive destination for ecotourism. Thirty-nine percent of tourists cite nature as their primary reason for visiting the country. The profitable industry of ecotourism entices businesses to capitalize on natural resources by protecting and preserving them rather than consuming them.\n\nThreats to Costa Rica's biodiversity include a rapidly growing human population, developing coastlines for the industry of tourism and harmful agricultural practices all contributing to pollution and environmental degradation. The practice causing the largest concern for Costa Rica's environment is deforestation. Costa Rica has the fourth highest rate of deforestation in the world. Almost four percent of its current forested lands are cut each year. Clearing land for cattle ranching is the most common cause of deforestation. This form of environmental damage along with the farming of monocultures leads to areas where only a few species of plants are present. Ultimately, decreases in plant diversity leads to decreased animal diversity.\n\nThere are about 1,251 species of butterflies and at least 8,000 species of moths. Butterflies and moths are common year round but are more present during the rainy season. Ten percent of known butterfly species worldwide reside in Costa Rica.\n\nCosta Rican butterflies and moths have made amazing adaptations to the environment. Some examples of these are the following:\nEcotourism is one of Costa Rica's primary economic resources, and the country's butterflies add a lot to that. They bring life to tropical forests, not only with the diversity in colour, but with the magnificence of the flowers that they help pollinate.\n\nSome common butterflies and moths in Costa Rica include:\n\nSome notable insects in Costa Rica are stingless bees and sweat bees such as \"L. figueresi and L. aeneiventre\", ants such as leaf-cutter ants and army ants, Hercules beetle, and many katydids.\n\nInvertebrate species make up most of Costa Rica's wildlife. Of the estimated 500,000 species, about 493,000 are invertebrates (including spiders and crabs). It is known that there are tens of thousands of insects and microscopic invertebrates in every land type and elevation level. However, they are largely unnoticed or unidentified.\nThere are known 183 species and subspecies of terrestrial gastropods from Costa Rica and numerous freshwater gastropods and bivalves.\n\nCosta Rica is home to around 175 amphibians, 85% of which are frogs. Frogs in Costa Rica have interesting ways of finding fishless water to raise their young in. Fish, of course, will eat tadpoles and eggs. Poison dart frogs put their eggs in water pools in bromeliads. Other methods include searching ponds before laying eggs, and laying eggs in wet soil. There are 35 species of \"Elutherodoctylus\" frogs, 26 species of \"Hyla\" frogs and 13 species of glassfrogs.\n\nNotable frog species in Costa Rica include red-eyed tree frog, a few species of poison dart frogs, the semitransparent glassfrogs, and the large smoky jungle frog. Some other notable toad species in Costa Rica include the ten species of \"Bufo\" toads and the giant toad, a huge toad known for its wide appetite. It has been documented eating almost anything, including vegetables, ants, spiders, any toad smaller than itself, mice, and other small mammals.\n\nBesides the frog species, approximately 40 species of lungless salamander and two species of caecilian are found in the country, both rarely seen and little known. Costa Rican amphibians range in size from the rainforest rocket frog, at 1.5 cm (0.5 in), to the giant toad, at up to 15 cm (6 in) and 2 kg (4.4 lb).\n\nRepresentatives of all three orders of amphibians - caecilians, salamanders, and frogs and toads - reside in Costa Rica. Due to environmental degradation and the sensitive nature of amphibians to pollution, Costa Rica has seen declines and even extinctions in amphibian populations. Monteverde Cloud Forest Reserve is a critical habitat for certain species of the order Anura. However, forty percent of the members of this order that reside in this reserve are estimated to have gone extinct since 1987. This equals twenty species of frogs and toads.\n\nThe highland-dwelling golden toad, Bufo periglenes, has not been witnessed in its highly restricted habitat of the central mountain ranges of Costa Rica since 1989. Within one year, the number of juveniles counted at their most prevalent breeding site declined from over 1,500 individuals to only one. The International \nUnion for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) declared the golden toad endangered, but it is likely extinct due to the lack of sightings since over two decades ago. Suspected causes for the toads probable extinction include a combination of intense El Nino weather patterns which resulted in a drought, increased pollution added to the environment, climate change, and an invasive fungal species, Chiriqui harlequin.\n\nAmphibians in Costa Rica have acquired many adaptations for survival. Some frog species, especially those of the poison dart frogs, have learned to lay eggs in water devoid of predatory fish. For some species this means laying eggs in small collections of water in the leaf litter, then transporting the eggs to bromeliads. Other species have adapted the ability of direct development. This means that the frog develops completely inside the egg without transitioning to the tadpole phase. This decreases vulnerable exposure to predators and the frog emerges from its egg as a froglet, much better equipped to protect itself.\n\nApproximately 225 reptiles are found in Costa Rica. This includes over 70 species of lizards, mostly small, forest-dwelling anoles. Large lizards such as the striped basilisk, black iguana, and green iguana are probably the country's most regularly encountered reptiles. Snakes number about 120 species in the country, including 5 powerful boas and a wide diversity of harmless colubrids.\n\nThere are about 20 venomous snakes, including colorful coral snakes and various vipers such as the common eyelash viper and two formidable, large bushmasters. The venomous snakes of Costa Rica are often observed without issue if given a respectful distance.\n\nAmong turtles, 5 of the world's 7 species of sea turtles nest on the nation's beaches. Two crocodilians, the widespread spectacled caiman and the large, sometimes dangerous American crocodile are found in Costa Rica. The country's reptiles range in size from the delicate 15 cm (6 in) Hallowell's centipede snake of the genus \"Tantilla\" to the hulking leatherback turtle, at 500 kg (1100 lb) and 150 cm (60 in).\n\nCosta Rica is home to nearly 250 species of mammal. Medium-sized forest-dwelling mammals are often the most appreciated mammalian fauna of the country. These include four species of monkeys such as the frantic white-headed capuchin and noisy mantled howlers; two species of sloths; the opportunistic white-nosed coati; and the fierce predator, the tayra.\n\nBats comprise more than half of the mammal species in the country, unusually outnumbering rodents twice over. Bats are adapted to various foraging methods and foods; including nectar, fish, insects and parasitized blood, as the case with the infamous vampire bats. Prominent bats include the tiny, communal roosting Honduran white bat and the huge, predatory spectral bat, the largest New World bat. Large fauna, such as tapir, jaguar, and deer are rarely encountered, being both elusive and tied to now-fragmented undisturbed habitats. Costa Rican mammals range in size from the 3-gram thumbless bat of the family Furipteridae to the 250 kg (550 lb) Baird's tapir.\n\nAnteaters are common in lowland and middle elevation throughout Costa Rica. The most commonly seen of Costa Rica's three anteaters species is the northern tamandua. The giant anteater is huge and endangered. The other anteater is the silky anteater.\n\nWild cats that exist in Costa Rica are: jaguars, ocelots, pumas, jaguarundi, margays, and little spotted cats.\n\nMost big cats in Costa Rica are nocturnal or hide in trees in the rainforest like the margay. The most likely place to find a big cat is in the Simon Bolivar Zoo in San José, Costa Rica where there is a selection of all the native big cats along with other animals. Ocelots usually hunt on the ground at night and rarely climb trees. An ocelot's diet consists of birds, monkeys, rats, and other small animals. The little spotted cat is the smallest wild cat and does not grow bigger than a house cat. They live in cloud forests up to 3200 m.\n\nThe jaguar is the largest wild cat in Costa Rica and can grow up to 2 m. They are very rare in Costa Rica and their numbers continue to decline drastically. The jaguarundi looks like a cross between a weasel and a cat. It is plain grey with a sleek body, hunts day and night, and has adapted best to human changes. The margay spends most of its life in trees. The puma is the second largest cat in Central America and its fur is brown and unspotted.\n\n894 bird species have been recorded in Costa Rica (including Cocos Island), more than all of the United States and Canada combined. More than 600 of the Costa Rican species are permanent residents, and upwards of 200 are migrants, spending portions of the year outside of the country, usually in North America. Seven of the Costa Rican species are considered endemic, and 19 are globally threatened. Costa Rica's birds range in size from the scintillant hummingbird, at 2.2 grams and 6 cm (2.4 in), to the huge jabiru, at 6.5 kg (14.3 lb) and 150 cm (60 in) (the American white pelican is heavier, but is an accidental species).\n\nScarlet macaws are a common species of Costa Rica. Unlike many bird species, macaws form a monogamous breeding pair and mate for life. Both males and females help care for young and raise chicks for up to two years before they fledge. Threats to the macaw include their popularity in the pet trade. One individual can be sold for up to one thousand dollars.\n\nThe resplendent quetzal, a trogon with a stunning physical appearance, can also be found in parts of Costa Rica. The bird's long grey and black tail feathers can stretch up to a meter long and are its defining feature. Resplendent quetzals live in cloud forests and are most active in the canopy. They can be found in several of Costa Rica's parks and reserves, including the Monteverde Cloud Forest, Santa Elena Cloud Forest Reserve, Braulio Carrillo National Park, Poas Volcano National Park, Chirripo National Park, and the Juan Castro Blanco National Park. Resplendent quetzals eat fruit, insects, small frogs, lizards, and snails and have distinctive echoing calls. Unfortunately, the bird is endangered because its cloud forest habitat has been widely destroyed across Central America.\nHummingbird species demonstrate adaptation with bill shape and size. Certain species have specialized bills that allow them to feed from the flowers of certain species of plants. The relationship between the hummingbird and plant is mutualistic because the hummingbird transfers pollen between plant individuals in exchange for nectar. Because different species of hummingbirds are adapted to specific plants, [pollination] of the right plants with the right pollen is ensured. The mangrove hummingbird is endemic to Costa Rica and specializes in feeding from the tea mangrove plant.\n\nCosta Rican officials have explored the possibility of shutting down their national zoos in an effort to demonstrate a more advanced appreciation for the wildlife in their country.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2058259", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2058259", "title": "Alta Battalion", "text": "Alta Battalion\n\nThe Alta Battalion () was an independent battalion within the Norwegian 6th Division based in the village of Alta in western Finnmark and commanded by Lt. Colonel Arne Dagfin Dahl. The Alta battalion was multiethnic, being it was constituted by ethnic Norwegians, Sámi and Kvens. It made great successes in halting the German invasion of Norway at Narvik.\n\nThe Alta battalion was mobilized 10 October 1939 to help guard Norway's neutrality in the Second World War and positioned in the border areas of eastern Finnmark during the Finnish Winter War to safeguard the northernmost areas of Norway against possible Soviet aggression. At the time the battalion consisted of around 900 soldiers. Guard and patrol duty in the border areas brought the battalion near the brutality of war and served to harden the men of the unit. After seeing the fighting and burning town in Petsamo the soldiers and officers of the Alta Battalion began to view war as a reality and not merely something found in the history books.\n\nThe Alta battalion was then demobilized on 15 January 1940. As the battalion deactivated, Lt. Col. Dahl realised that the international situation was still unstable and the unit might be needed again soon. Thus the soldiers were ordered to tag their uniforms and personal equipment before handing them in for storage. This precautionary measure helped the battalion greatly when it was again needed less than three months later.\n\nAfter the return to Alta a ski company of ninety volunteers was formed and retained for another two months of training. On average the battalion was not considered especially ski-worthy and most of the soldiers had their only skiing experience from the neutrality duty.\n\nAfter the German invasion of Norway on 9 April 1940 the battalion was once more mobilized, the soldiers making their way to Alta by boats or reindeer sleds, then being transported to the front area by the Hurtigruten steamships \"Dronning Maud\" and \"Kong Haakon\", and the cargo ship \"Senja\". The battalion departed the pier in Alta on 19 April 1940 and arrived at Sjøvegan on 21 April.\n\nDuring the coming two-month-long campaign in the mountains north and east of Narvik the battalion spearheaded the 6th Division's advance against the German 3rd Mountain Division in the Narvik area. The standard issue weapons of an infantry squad of the battalion during the campaign was one Madsen light machine gun and Krag-Jørgensen rifles.\n\nWhen the battalion left for the front it consisted of around 830 men, with 112 horses and 100 ski sleds.\n\nThe unit spent the entire two-month campaign conducting offensive operations against general Eduard Dietl's entrenched troops. The at first lightly armed infantrymen attacked through the extreme mountainous terrain of northern Nordland against far better trained German gebirgsjäger and fallschirmjäger troops; the unit was only occasionally supported by artillery or air power, usually only being backed up by the unit's 18 Colt M/29 heavy machine guns and its few 81 mm mortars. On the German side the Luftwaffe became progressively more active in the campaign as the Germans recruited collaborators who constructed new air bases in the more southerly regions of the country. Especially important for the Luftwaffe's ability to support the German forces on the Narvik Front was the rapid improvement of Værnes air base, giving the German bombers much more time to operate over the northern front lines.\n\nNevertheless, by early June 1940, in co-operation with French and Polish land forces, as well the RAF, the Royal Navy and the French and Polish navies, the 6th Division had pushed the German invaders out of the vital port of Narvik and forced them into a small pocket by the Swedish border. In the mountainous inland areas of the front the Alta Battalion was continuously on the attack, suffering many casualties in the process of throwing back the crack German troops. During the last phase of the fighting Luftwaffe bombers steadily increased their attacks against the allied forces, while the Norwegians deployed their few Fokker C.V light bombers and Heinkel He 115 and Marinens Flyvebaatfabrikk M.F.11 seaplanes in support of the offensive. The elderly Fokker biplanes proved themselves to be surprisingly effective at low level bombing of German positions. The RAF provided a certain extent of fighter cover with the Gloster Gladiators of No. 263 Squadron RAF and the Hawker Hurricanes of No. 46 Squadron RAF, although these were too few to continuously patrol the entire front line.\n\nIn the last weeks of the fighting the battalion was combat-hardened, and well-equipped because of the large amounts of German equipment captured by the advancing fishermen-farmers and reindeer herders of the Alta Battalion. For the first time ever Norwegian infantry advanced utilizing weapons such as submachine guns and hand grenades. During the last weeks of the campaign the battalion's mortars had been worn out by the constant use, with the base plates often being in need of replacement, hence the capture of German 50 mm and 81 mm mortars was very welcome. A number of German mountain guns that had been air dropped by the Luftwaffe to the besieged 3rd Mountain Division were also seized by the battalion and sent back to Alta. In Alta gunners began training with the captured pieces, the intention being deploying them on the front at the earliest opportunity.\n\nWhile the Alta Battalion was fighting Dietl's men at the front a training battalion of three companies was formed at Altagård and Banak back in Finnmark. In addition Alta Battalion also formed smaller local forces in western Finnmark, including an air warning unit of fifteen men in Kårhamn. Although the training battalion was supposed to provide replacements and reinforcements for the active battalion the fighting ended before it could see any action.\n\nDuring the fighting a small number of trained foreigners joined the battalion, amongst these were nine Estonians that joined up on 19 May.\n\nAs the Alta Battalion and the other formations of the 6th Division prepared for one last push against the beleaguered Germans and Austrians of the 3rd Mountain Division, the Third Reich unleashed Fall Gelb and invaded France and the Low Countries. The German 10 May invasion, and the disastrous consequences of this operation for the Allies, led to the land, sea and air forces committed to the Norwegian Campaign being suddenly withdrawn, with notice given the Norwegian authorities only days before the evacuation.\n\nWithout the support of the RAF and the Royal Navy the Norwegian government lost all hope of prevailing against the Germans, and fled the country with the evacuating Allies. The last order of the evacuating government to the Norwegian units opposing the Nazis was: \"Demobilise\".\n\nAfter the conclusion of the campaign Eduard Dietl commented that at the time of the Norwegian capitulation his forces would have been able to hold out for only another 24 to 48 hours, after which they would have had to abandon the entire Narvik front and cross into Sweden.\n\nAs the still undefeated units of the 6th Division, amongst them the Alta Battalion, marched down from the snow-covered hills on 9 June 1940 many of the soldiers cried tears of bitterness and disappointment that victory had been snatched from them. At 0000hrs 10 June 1940 the ceasefire came into effect. During the early hours of the 10th the soldiers of the battalion marched to Grovfjord, under intermittent air attacks, from where they embarked fishing boats for the journey back to Altagård.\n\nAt the capitulation the battalion's archives were removed from Altagård and shipped into exile, initially to the Faroe Islands.\n\nIn all the battalion suffered 71 casualties out of around 900 men during the Norwegian Campaign.\n\nAt the end of the Norwegian Campaign the battalion was demobilised and the soldiers returned to their homes and civilian occupations. During the occupation many former members of the battalion were active in the resistance movement, mostly working with gathering intelligence on German forces in Finnmark.\n\n"}

{"id": "2058267", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2058267", "title": "American Samoa Community College", "text": "American Samoa Community College\n\nAmerican Samoa Community College (ASCC) is a public community college in the village of Mapusaga, American Samoa. Only legal residents of American Samoa who have graduated from high school or obtained a General Equivalency Diploma are admitted to ASCC.\n\nIt is American Samoa's only tertiary education institution. The main Mapusaga campus has a variety of two-year programs. Also associated with the college are a nursing school at LBJ Hospital and vocational facilities in the Tafuna Industrial Complex.\n\nASCC awarded 139 degrees and certificates in 2016, including 75 Associate of Arts degrees, 60 Associate of Science degrees, 3 Certificate of Proficiency, and one Bachelor in Elementary Education. In 2016, the college had 1,254 enrolled full-time students and 553 enrolled part-time. Around 27 percent majored in liberal arts but other popular majors were business management, accounting, criminal justice, education, nursing and health science.\n\nAmerican Samoa Community College was established in 1970. It started its first year with 474 attending school in Utulei at the old navy buildings that once were the High School of American Samoa (now Samoana High School). Enrollment increased to 550 in the fall of 1971 and 872 by the spring of 1972. The college originally offered an associate degree and transfer to baccalaureate-granting colleges. It offered vocational, teacher, adult education and manpower training. Nurse training was added in 1976. The college was granted one-year accreditation in 1973 and received entitlement to funds under the Higher Education Act of 1963. When The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints closed its Mapusaga High School in 1974, the government of American Samoa purchased the buildings for $1.5 million, signed a 50-year lease for the 20-acre property, and moved the college here. The college received accreditation from the Commission of Junior Colleges, Western Association of Schools and Colleges in 1976. The college's new wing was constructed in 1978 at a cost of $3.5 million. ASCC received a $1.5 million federal grant in 1978 in order to establish a Teacher Corps project to improve the teaching quality.\n\nThe college was established in 1970 as part of the American Samoa Department of Education to provide residents the opportunity to enjoy postsecondary education in the liberal arts, teacher training, vocational-technical education, and general education. The first freshman class had only 131 students. The school moved into a few buildings on the island before moving permanently to its current location in Mapusaga in 1974.\n\nIn 1979, the U.S. Economic Development Administration provided a grant that allowed the college to add five modern buildings for the fine arts, nursing, science, and vocational training. ASCC was also able to add a cafeteria and a gymnasium. A new library was added in 2003. New administrative offices, lecture hall and two new teacher education classrooms were added in 2008. The computer and science labs were renovated and upgraded with funding from the American Reinvestment and Recovery Act in 2011. Groundbreaking for the Multi-Purpose Center was initiated in 2013.\n\nThe Health Care Center at ASCC opened in November 1985. The college also began a program to enable local nurses to take national tests as registered and licensed practical nurses.\n\nSamoan artist Sven Ortquist has been an artist-in-residence at the college.\nASCC offers Associate of Arts and Associate of Science degrees, as well as certificate programs.

{"id": "2058291", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2058291", "title": "Evangelist portrait", "text": "Evangelist portrait\n\nEvangelist portraits are a specific type of miniature included in ancient and mediaeval illuminated manuscript Gospel Books, and later in Bibles and other books, as well as other media. Each Gospel of the Four Evangelists, the books of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, may be prefaced by a portrait of the Evangelist, usually occupying a full page. Their symbols may be shown with them, or separately. Often they are the only figurative illumination in the manuscript. They are a common feature in larger Gospel Books from the earliest examples in the 6th century until the decline of that format for illustrated books in the High Middle Ages, by which time their conventions were being used for portraits of other authors. \nThey originate in the classical secular tradition of the author portrait, which was often the only illustration in a classical manuscript, also used as a frontispiece (not unlike the contemporary author photo, though this is usually shown on the back cover or wrapper). A very few examples of Late Antique secular author portraits survive, and rather more later copies. Some examples also draw on the conventions of the Late Antique consular portrait, much used for the Emperors, who were also consuls. Examples of these, copied from the original, can be seen in the Chronography of 354 (see also the Missorium of Theodosius I of 30 years later). The Evangelist may be holding a book, but is not writing in it, and he faces the front on a large throne, surrounded by an elaborate frame, usually domed or pedimented. These frameworks are thought to draw from the style of the Scaenae frons, or elaborate proscenium structures of Roman theatres.\n\nThe traditional symbols of the Evangelists were often included in the images, or especially in the Insular tradition, either given their own additional images on a separate page, or used instead of an evangelist portrait. The symbols are: the Lion of Mark, the Eagle of John, the Ox or Calf of Luke and the Angel or Man of Matthew. Often all are shown with wings, as in the familiar winged lion used in the coat of arms of Venice, whose patron saint was Mark. Sometimes, as in the example from Lorsch, the symbols are shown dictating the text to the evangelist.\n\nLate Antique evangelist portraits often show standing figures, as in the ivory panels of the Throne of Maximianus in Milan, but from the Insular art of the 7th to 10th centuries, evangelist portraits in manuscripts nearly always closely followed the seated classical models, showing the Evangelists at full-length, either looking out at the viewer or writing at a table or desk and seen at an oblique angle. These were derived from unknown classical prototypes, similar to those in the Codex Amiatinus and Saint Augustine Gospels, though both of these types are rather different from the general types. Usually a setting is provided for the figure. Details of the classical models, such as anachronistic scrolls and scroll-boxes, and a small writing-stand with a single dolphin-shaped support (see gallery below), survive well into the Middle Ages, sometimes clearly misunderstood by the artists concerned. Perhaps because of the secular origins of the typology, haloes are less likely to be worn than in other types of image. The level of detail shown in the furniture and fittings is unusual for Early Medieval art. An arch behind the author, often with curtains hanging across it, in some examples close to the classical models, gradually is turned into a decorative framing device for the whole scene.\n\nEarly Gospel Books often had a very elaborate and costly treasure binding or cover in metalwork, often with jewels and ivories. These most often featured a central panel with Christ in Majesty, often including the Evangelists and/or their symbols in the corners. Versions of the same composition appear in all media used for Early Medieval religious art, including wall paintings. The Tassilo Chalice is an 8th-century example of pure metalwork with five oval medallion portraits of Christ and the Evangelists (with symbols) round the cup.\n\nThe early artists of the Insular period often show evangelists from the front who appear to be standing, although a chair is drawn behind them; the human figure was not a focus of interest or skill for these artists. Later Insular depictions seem to show figures without chairs, who are standing. Most of Europe continued to use the seated model however, usually seen in a three-quarters on view, and usually with a cushion behind. Sometimes all four evangelists were combined on a page, sometimes around a Christ in Majesty. Standing portraits were usual, however, for wall and later panel paintings (and in the Tree of Jesse composition) with the Evangelists often treated as, and mixed with, other saints. \nThe Gospel book as a medium for heavily illustrated manuscripts declined in the West from the Romanesque period, and with it the use of the Evangelist portrait. In the Eastern Orthodox world, the Gospel Book remained a primary focus for illumination, and Evangelist portraits, derived from contemporary Byzantine versions, are heavily represented among the earliest illuminations from the new Slav national traditions, such as the 11th-century Ostromir Gospels and the Khitrovo Gospels of about 1390 from Muscovy. In the West the portraits continued to be found in Bibles, more often as the picture within a historiated initial at the start of each Gospel. Other books sometimes contained them as well. Similar compositions began to be used for other saint-authors, especially for St Jerome, who is often shown in a book-lined study, often with his symbol, a lion, dozing at his feet. Similarly St Gregory the Great may be shown with a dove, representing his inspiration from the Holy Spirit, whispering in his ear.\n\n"}

The hourglass of the title refers to the use of this object as a symbol in obituaries and death notices among the Poles.\n\nIn \"Father's Last Escape,\" the concluding story of the novel, Schulz makes an explicit reference to Franz Kafka's \"The Metamorphosis\" (Schulz helped his one-time fiancee translate Kafka's \"The Trial\" into Polish, a translation for which Schulz provided an introduction). The old man's business has been liquidated and all his functions and authorities taken over by his wife or relatives. Even the pretty, young Polish maid Adela has gone and been replaced by Genya, \"anemic, pale, and boneless,…and so absent-minded that she sometimes made a white sauce from old letters and invoices.\" Father's response is to turn himself first into wallpaper, then a piece of clothing, and finally into a big crablike insect who — unlike Kafka's passive victim — runs around the house, searching endlessly for something. His wife can catch the creature in her handkerchief sometimes, but cannot hold him. One day, however, she must have managed because Father appears at lunch, as the main course, after which he escapes the table, never to be seen again.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2058300", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2058300", "title": "Nash Papyrus", "text": "Nash Papyrus\n\nThe Nash Papyrus is a collection of four papyrus fragments acquired in Egypt in 1898, inscribed with a Hebrew text which mainly contains the Ten Commandments and the first part of the Shema Yisrael prayer, in a form that differs substantially from the later, canonical Masoretic text and is in parts more similar to the chronologically closer Septuagint. It has been suggested that the text might have been the daily worship of a Jew living in Egypt at the time. The fragments comprise a single sheet and are not part of a scroll. The papyrus is of unknown provenance, although it is allegedly from Fayyum. The text was first described by Stanley A. Cook in 1903. Though dated by Cook to the 2nd century CE, subsequent reappraisals have pushed the date of the fragments back to about 150–100 BCE. The papyrus was by far the oldest Hebrew manuscript fragment known at that time, before the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls in 1947.\n\nThe papyrus fragments were acquired by W. L. Nash, the secretary of the Society of Biblical Archaeology. He presented them to Cambridge University Library in 1903.\n\nTwenty-four lines long, with a few letters missing at each edge, the papyrus contains the Ten Commandments in Hebrew and a short middle text, followed by the start of the Shema Yisrael prayer. The text of the Ten Commandments combines parts of the version from Exodus with parts from Deuteronomy . A curiosity is its omission of the phrase \"house of bondage\", used in both versions, about Egypt – perhaps a reflection of where the papyrus was composed.\n\nSome (but not all) of the papyrus' substitutions from Deuteronomy are also found in the version of Exodus in the Septuagint, a Greek translation of the Pentateuch from the 3rd–2nd centuries BCE, made in Alexandria. The Septuagint also interpolates before Deuteronomy the preamble to the Shema found in the papyrus, and the Septuagint also agrees with a couple of the other variant readings where the papyrus departs from the standard Hebrew Masoretic text. The ordering of the later commandments in the papyrus (Adultery–Murder–Steal, rather than Murder–Adultery–Steal) is also that found in most texts of the Septuagint.\n\nThe papyrus preamble before Shema Yisrael, also found in the Septuagint, is taken from , which is the only time the recurring formula \"This is the commandment(s) and rules and teachings...\" mentions the Exodus from Egypt. The Nash preamble correctly cites Moses as the speaker rather than God as in the Septuagint. The insertion of Deuteronomy 4:45 before Shema Yisrael in the papyrus and especially the Septuagint, which has two preambles in the same section: and the interpolation to , was probably done to distance the central Shema Yisrael prayer from its context: sections dealing with the entry to the Promised Land of Canaan.\n\nAccording to the Talmud it was once customary to read the Ten Commandments before saying the Shema. As Burkitt put it, \"it is therefore reasonable to conjecture that this Papyrus contains the daily worship of a pious Egyptian Jew, who lived before the custom came to an end\". It is thus believed that the papyrus probably consisted of a liturgical document, specifically the constituents of a Phylactery, which may have purposely synthesised the two versions of the Commandments, rather than directly from Scripture. However, the papyrus' similarities with the Septuagint, support a possibility that a Hebrew text of the Pentateuch was in circulation in Egypt in the 2nd century BCE, and served both the Nash papyrus and the Septuagint translation as source, but which differs significantly from the modern Jewish Masoretic Text.\n\nCurrently the manuscript is in the Cambridge University Library (MS Or.233).\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2058313", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2058313", "title": "ICT 1301", "text": "ICT 1301\n\nThe ICT 1301 and its smaller derivative ICT 1300 were early business computers from International Computers and Tabulators. Typical of mid-sized machines of the era, they used core memory, drum storage and punched cards, but they were unusual in that they were based on decimal logic instead of binary.\n\nThe 1301 was designed by an ICT and GEC joint subsidiary, Computer Developments Limited (CDL) at GEC's Coventry site.\nThe 1301 was the main machine in the line. Its main memory came in increments of 400 words of 48 bits (12 decimal digits or 12 four-bit binary values, 0-15) plus two parity bits. The maximum size was 4,000 words. It was the first ICT machine to use core memory.\n\nBacking store was magnetic drum and optionally one-inch-, half-inch- or quarter-inch-wide magnetic tape. Input was from 80-column punched cards and optionally 160-column punched cards and punched paper tape. Output was to 80-column punched cards, line printer, and optionally to punched paper tape.\n\nThe machine ran at a clock speed of 1 MHz and its arithmetic logic unit (ALU) operated on data in a \"serial-parallel\" fashion—the 48-bit words were processed sequentially four bits at a time. A simple addition took 21 clock cycles; hardware multiplication averaged 170 clock cycles per digit; and division was performed in software.\n\nThe computer was announced in May 1960. The first customer delivery was in 1962, a 1301 sold to the University of London. About 150 to 200 of these machines were sold. One of their main attractions was that they performed British currency calculations (pounds, shillings and pence) in hardware. They also had the advantage of programmers not having to learn binary or octal arithmetic as the instruction set was pure decimal and the arithmetic unit had no binary mode, only decimal or pounds, shillings and pence. The London University machine was restored to working condition by a group of enthusiasts completing their task in 2012.\n\nA typical 1301 requires 700 square feet (65 square metres) of floor space and weighs about . It consumes about 13kVA of three-phase electric power. The electronics consist of over 4,000 printed circuit boards each with many germanium diodes (mainly OA5), germanium transistors (mainly Mullard GET872), resistors, capacitors, inductors, and a handful of thermionic valves and a few dozen relays operated when buttons were pressed. Integrated circuits were not available commercially at the time.\n\nThe card reader could read 600 standard punched cards per minute, each with a capacity of up to 80 characters. The card punch could punch 100 cards per minute.\n\nThe line printer could print 600 lines of 120 characters per minute. It used a print barrel made up of 120 print wheels each with 50 characters around its edge. Each of the 120 print positions had a print hammer which when fired squeezed the paper and an inked ribbon between itself and the rotating print barrel for a fraction of a second. It is reputed to be the first commercially produced barrel printer.\n\nA drum could record 12,000 words of data. It also had 400 words of 'reserved' storage where the computer's bootstrap program (then called Initial Orders) was stored. Up to 8 drums could be attached. Average access time was 5.7 ms.\n\nThe standard magnetic tape system (called tape type 3) used half-inch-wide (12.7 mm) magnetic tape with ten tracks at a density of 300 bits per inch. Four of the tracks held data, four more tracks held the inverse of the data and there was a parity bit for both groups of four. This allowed single-bit errors to be corrected and double-bit errors to be detected. Up to eight Ampex TM4 tape decks, running at 75 inches per second for a throughput of 22,500 digits per second, could be connected. Spools could hold up to of tape and were of the three-prong design common at the time for professional audio recorders rather than the later industry standard expanding-hub design.\n\nThe \"High Speed\" magnetic tape system (called tape type 1) used one-inch-wide (25.4 mm) magnetic tape running at 150 inches per second, with sixteen tracks at a density of 300 bits per inch. Eight of the tracks held data, with check data on the other eight, allowing single-bit errors to be corrected and double-bit errors to be detected. Up to eight tape decks could be connected, giving a throughput of 90,000 digits per second. Spools could hold up to of tape and were of three-prong design.\n\nThere was also a system based on quarter-inch magnetic tape. This had a single write head and two read heads. The read heads were identical but each read from half of the width of the tape.\nEach digit was represented by two flux-reversal portions on the tape. The length of these segments determined the value of each digit. This meant that tape capacity was somewhat data dependent. The offcuts from damaged tape were compatible with the then normal audio tape recorders so there was a great deal of recycling.\n\nOne or two paper-tape readers could be connected, each with a speed of 1,000 characters per second.\n\nA paper-tape punch of 300 characters per second was available.\n\nAn online teleprinter was available, though very few machines had these.\n\nTowards the end of the life of the 1301, a single ICT standard interface could be added to allow data to be written to the by-then industry-standard magnetic tape.\n\nThe ICT 1300 was identical to the 1301 in every way except that its card reader was limited to 300 cards per minute and its line printer was limited to 300 lines per minute. It tended to be sold with less core storage and drum storage and without magnetic tape. A drum with only a quarter of the read/write heads fitted was commonly used, giving 3,000 words of 48 bits as backing storage.\n\nThe ICT 1302 was a larger version of the 1301 with the new ICT standard interface for connecting peripheral devices (the standard interface was later used on the ICT 1900 series).\n\nVery few ICT 1301 computers remain in existence around the world, and of them, none is working.\n\n\"Flossie\" is the nickname given to an ICT 1301 () in storage at The National Museum of Computing at Bletchley Park, England. The computer had originally been used for computing exam results for students at the University of London. It is hoped that this will eventually be restored to operating condition.\n\nA second ICT 1301, which is close to operating condition, is on display at the Toitū Otago Settlers Museum in Dunedin, New Zealand. This computer — the first in the city of Dunedin — was originally used by the Cadbury confectionery factory for calculating invoices and payroll.\n\nThere is a third machine named Arthur located in Cumbria, UK. The machine belongs to the Time-Line Computer Archive museum and although nearly complete, is not in working condition.\n\n"}

He was brother of fellow army officer Ørnulf Dahl. He took his examen artium in 1912, graduated from business school in 1919 and entered law studies at the Royal Frederick University in 1921. In 1924, he dropped out of university, to become director of the Norwegian Automobile Federation. Dahl had gained an international pilot licence in 1918.\n\nOn 17 September 1921, Dahl married Kristiania-born Astri Thinn Christophersen (b. 12 July 1901). By 1930, the couple had three daughters.\n\nIn the years 1920-1924, Dahl worked as a physical education teacher at the school St. Hanshaugens gymnasium. From 1920 to 1924 he worked as a secretary at the Oslo Forsvarsforening, and from 1923 to 1929 he edited the automotive magazine \"Norsk Motorblad.\"\n\nDahl graduated from the Norwegian Military Academy in 1915, with the rank of first lieutenant. During the First World War, Dahl first saw service in the Norwegian Army's neutrality guard in 1915-1916, with the 14th Infantry Regiment. He then served as the Norwegian military attaché to the United Kingdom (1916-1919) and Belgium (1917-1919). \n\nIn connection with this assignment to Belgium Dahl spent time at the front lines as an observer. According to a report on the Alta Battalion by the Norwegian Ministry of Health and Care Services, Dahl saw action during his time at the front, fighting in a British unit at the Battle of the Somme in 1916.\n\nAfter returning to Norway in 1919, Dahl spent five years working at the Norwegian Military Academy. In 1929 he became an adjutant to Haakon VII of Norway, and in 1930 was promoted to captain.\n\nDahl assumed command of the Alta Battalion in 1939 and led it through the 1940 Norwegian Campaign. He has since been considered perhaps the best Norwegian battalion commander during the fighting at Narvik.\n\nHe later served in the UK and the U.S. as well as having other commands before in the fall of 1944, as a full colonel, he was made commander of the Norwegian Military Mission.\n\nIn 1941 Dahl became the first Norwegian to attend the Command and General Staff College at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.\n\nDahl was given charge of the Norwegian forces that were transferred to assist in the Liberation of Finnmark from November 1944. Once there, he assumed control of the front from the Soviets, commanding the Free Norwegian Forces that had followed him from Britain, locally raised militias, and recently arrived police troops from Sweden. At the time of the German capitulation in Norway on 8 May 1945 Dahl had under his Finnmark command around 3,000 soldiers. Although involved in very little fighting, the force under Dahl's command was heavily involved in helping the civilian population of Finnmark and served as a symbol of Norwegian sovereignty in the area. Dahl on his part was concerned that the Russian forces which had been stationed in Eastern Finnmark since the October 1944 Petsamo-Kirkenes Operation might not leave after war's end.

{"id": "2058337", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2058337", "title": "Picatrix", "text": "Picatrix\n\nPicatrix is the name used today, for a 400-page book of magic and astrology originally written in Arabic under the title Ghāyat al-Ḥakīm, which most scholars assume was originally written in the middle of the 11th century, though an argument for composition in the first half of the 10th century has been made. The Arabic title translates as The Aim of the Sage or The Goal of The Wise. The Arabic work was translated into Spanish and then into Latin during the 13th century, at which time it got the Latin title \"Picatrix\". The book's title \"Picatrix\" is also sometimes used to refer to the book's author.\n\n\"Picatrix\" is a composite work that synthesizes older works on magic and astrology. One of the most influential interpretations suggests it is to be regarded as a \"handbook of talismanic magic\". Another researcher summarizes it as \"the most thorough exposition of celestial magic in Arabic\", indicating the sources for the work as \"Arabic texts on Hermeticism, Sabianism, Ismailism, astrology, alchemy and magic produced in the Near East in the ninth and tenth centuries A.D.\" Eugenio Garin declares, \"In reality the Latin version of the \"Picatrix\" is as indispensable as the \"Corpus Hermeticum\" or the writings of Albumasar for understanding a conspicuous part of the production of the Renaissance, including the figurative arts.\" It has significantly influenced West European esotericism from Marsilio Ficino in the 15th century, to Thomas Campanella in the 17th century. The manuscript in the British Library passed through several hands: Simon Forman, Richard Napier, Elias Ashmole and William Lilly.\n\nAccording to the prologue of the Latin translation, \"Picatrix\" was translated into Spanish from the Arabic by order of Alphonso X of Castile at some time between 1256 and 1258. The Latin version was produced sometime later, based on translation of the Spanish manuscripts. It has been attributed to Maslama ibn Ahmad al-Majriti (an Andalusian mathematician), but many have called this attribution into question. Consequently, the author is sometimes indicated as \"Pseudo-Majriti\".\n\nThe Spanish and Latin versions were the only ones known to Western scholars until Wilhelm Printz discovered an Arabic version in or around 1920.\n\nThe work is divided into four books, which exhibit a marked absence of systematic exposition. Jean Seznec observed, \"\"Picatrix\" prescribes propitious times and places and the attitude and gestures of the suppliant; he also indicates what terms must be used in petitioning the stars.\" As an example, Seznec then reproduces a prayer to Saturn from the work, noting that Fritz Saxl has pointed out that this invocation exhibits \"the accent and even the very terms of a Greek astrological prayer to Kronos. This is one indication that the sources of \"Picatrix\" are in large part Hellenistic.\":\n\nAccording to Garin:\nAccording to the Prologue, the author researched over two hundred works in the creation of \"Picatrix\". However, there are three significant Near/Middle Eastern influences: Jabir ibn Hayyan, the Brethren of Purity, and ibn Wahshiyya's \"Nabataean Agriculture\". The influence of Jabir ibn Hayyan comes in the form of a cosmological background that removes magical practices from the context of diabolical influences and reasserts these practices as having a divine origin. The author of \"Picatrix\" utilizes Neoplatonic theories of hypostasis that mirror the work of ibn Hayyan.\n\nThe Arab historian, Ibn Khaldun, in his Muqaddimah, ascribed authorship of \"Picatrix\" (referring to the original Arabic version, under the title \"Ġāyat al-Ḥakīm\" غاية الحكيم و أحق النتيجتين بالتقديم) to the astronomer and mathematician Maslama Al-Majriti, who died between 1005 CE and 1008 CE (398 AH). This attribution is problematic: the author of the Arabic original states in its introduction that he completed the book on 348 AH, which is ~ 959 CE. Moreover, the author states that he started writing the \"Picatrix\" after he completed his previous book, \"Rutbat al-Ḥakīm\" رتبة الحكيم in 343 AH (~ 954 CE). This makes the authoring more than five decades before Al-Majriti's death, and if his estimated birth year is to be accepted, he would be only around 5 years old when he started writing it. As well, according to Holmyard, the earliest manuscript attribution of the work to Maslama al-Majriti was made by the alchemist al-Jildaki, who died shortly after 1360, while Ibn Khaldun died some 20 years later. However, no biography of al-Majriti mentions him as the author of this work.\n\nMore recent attributions of authorship range from \"the Arabic version is anonymous\" to reiterations of the old claim that the author is \"the celebrated astronomer and mathematician Abu l-Qasim Maslama b. Ahmad Al-Majriti\". One recent study in \"Studia Islamica\" suggests that the authorship of this work should be attributed to Maslama b. Qasim al-Qurtubi (died 353/964), who according to Ibn al-Faradi was \"a man of charms and talismans\". If this suggestion is correct it would place the work in the context of Andalusian sufism and batinism.\n\nThe odd Latin title is sometimes explained as a sloppy transliteration of one \"Buqratis\", mentioned several times in the second of the four books of the work. Others have suggested that the title (or the name of the author) is a way of attributing the work to Hippocrates (via a transcription of the name \"Burqratis\" or \"Biqratis\" in the Arabic text). Where it appears in the Arabic original, the Latin text does translate the name Burqratis as \"Picatrix\", but this still does not establish the identity of Burqratis. Ultimately, linking the name, Picatrix, with Hippocrates, has fallen into disfavor because the text separately cites Hippocrates under the name \"Ypocras\".\n\nMartin Plessner suggests that a translator of the \"Picatrix\" established a medieval definition of scientific experiment by changing a passage in the Hebrew translation of the Arabic original, establishing a theoretical basis for the experimental method: \"the invention of an hypothesis in order to explain a certain natural process, then the arranging of conditions under which that process may intentionally be brought about in accordance with the hypothesis, and finally, the justification or refutation of the hypothesis, depending on the outcome of the experiment\".\n\nPlessner notes that it is generally agreed that awareness of, \"the specific nature of the experimental method–as distinct from the practical use of it–is an achievement of the 16th and 17th centuries.\" However, as the passage by the translator of the Hebrew version makes clear, the fundamental theoretical basis for the experimental method was here established prior to the middle of the 13th century.\n\nThe original passage in Arabic describes how a man who witnessed a treatment for a scorpion's sting (drinking a potion of frankincense that had received seal imprints) had gone on to experiment with different types of frankincense, assuming that this was the cause for the cure, but later found that the seal images were the cause for the cure, regardless of the substance upon which they were impressed. The author of the \"Picatrix\" goes on to explain how the explanation of the effectiveness of cures passed on to him by authorities was then proved to him by his own experience.\n\nThe Hebrew translator changed the passage in question to include the following:\nAnd that was the reason which incited me [to devote myself to astrological magic]. Moreover, these secrets were already made known by Nature, and the experience approved them. The man dealing with nature has nothing to do but producing a reason of what the experience has brought out.\nPlessner also notes that \"neither the Arabic psychology of study nor the Hebrew definition of the experiment is rendered in the Latin \"Picatrix\". The Latin translator omits many theoretical passages throughout the work.\"\n\nIn exploring the cross-cultural circulation of the text Avner Ben-Zaken enlisted to the Picatrix's scholarship the “Yates thesis,” and argued that the text played a latent, though central, role in shaping the philosophy of Renaissance natural magic and in giving the stimulus needed to transform occultist notions into experimental science. For Renaissance thinkers unfriendly to the establishment, natural magic offered an alternative program for natural philosophy, and some turned it against Aristotelian philosophy, which they viewed as hegemonic. Moreover, these rebels presented natural magic as a scientific practice, a culture deeply grounded in non-European contexts. For Ficino and Pico, natural magic originated in the ancient Near East, brought Renaissance Europe through cross-cultural exchanges that involved Kabalistic texts and Arabic works on magic. For Agrippa, natural magic carried a new program for science, as well as new practices and new personas. For him, the magus—the new experimental naturalist—was a figure that first came to life in the ancient East. For Campanella, natural magic offered a bottom-up construction of natural philosophy that also entailed a new organization of society, in which reason and firsthand experience order both nature and society. All perceived Picatrix as a text that embodied both: a strong alternative program for the study of nature, and a strong cultural program for challenging European culture from outside. In imagining this alternative, they eventually returned their science to its historical point of origin, the East. Ficino, Agrippa, and in a sense Campanella pushed the argument further, laying a foundation for a heliocentric worldview, initiating the search for the hidden forces of nature, and casting the magician virtuoso as the godfather of natural philosophy.\nThus, the Picatrix was essential for turning natural magic into philosophy, for transforming the magus into an experimentalist, and for transforming the practice of natural magic into an institutional system of education. It inspired the proposal that scholars shift their focus from Scholasticism to the distant sources of natural magic.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2058338", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2058338", "title": "Staphylococcus haemolyticus", "text": "Staphylococcus haemolyticus\n\nStaphylococcus haemolyticus is a member of the coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS). It is part of the skin flora of humans, and its largest populations are usually found at the axillae, perineum, and inguinal areas. \"S. haemolyticus\" also colonizes primates and domestic animals. It is a well-known opportunistic pathogen, and is the second-most frequently isolated CoNS (\"S. epidermidis\" is the first). Infections can be localized or systemic, and are often associated with the insertion of medical devices. The highly antibiotic-resistant phenotype and ability to form biofilms make \"S. haemolyticus\" a difficult pathogen to treat.\n\n\"S. haemolyticus\" is nonmotile, nonsporulating, facultatively anaerobic, and Gram-positive. Cells are typically coccus-shaped and range from 0.8-1.3 μm in diameter. It lives on a wide variety of substrates, including glucose, glycerol, maltose, sucrose, and trehalose. It also tests positive for acetoin production, arginine, dihydrolase, benzidine, catalase, hemolysis, and lipase; it tests negative for coagulase, DNase, ornithine decarboxylase, phosphatase, urease, and oxidase.\n\nOptimal growth occurs between 30 and 40 °C in the presence of oxygen and 10% NaCl. However, some strains can grow at temperatures that range between 18 and 45 °C. Growth at 15 °C or 15% NaCl is poor or absent.\n\nThe \"S. haemolyticus\" strain JCSC1435 genome contains a 2,685,015 bp chromosome and three plasmids of 2,300 bp, 2,366 bp, and 8,180 bp. The chromosome is comparable in size to those of \"S. aureus\" and \"S. epidermidis\" and contains a similar G+C content. In addition, a large proportion of the open reading frames (ORFs) are conserved across all three species. On average, orthologous ORFs are 78% identical. However, \"S. haemolyticus\" does have unique chromosome regions distributed near \"oriC\" (the origin of chromosomal DNA replication), and these regions are collectively referred to as the “oriC environ”.\n\nAs noted, some \"S. haemolyticus\" ORFs differ from \"S. aureus\" and \"S. epidermidis\". Some of these ORFs encode gene products with known biological features, such as the regulation of RNA synthesis, the transport of ribose and ribitol, and the essential components of nucleic acid and cell wall teichoic acid biosynthesis. Other unique ORFs likely encode products involved with bacterial pathogenesis and at least three of these ORFs show homology to staphylococcal hemolysins.\n\nThe \"S. haemolyticus\" genome also contains many insertion sequences (ISs). These IS elements may promote frequent genomic rearrangements which accelerate the diversification of the species. Theoretically, these adaptations might help \"S. haemolyticus\" overcome the adverse effects of chemical exposure (i.e. the use of antibiotics). The table below contains a list of genes known to be associated with \"S. haemolyticus\" antibiotic resistance.\n\nLike other Gram-positive microbes, \"S. haemolyticus\" has a thick, rather homogenous, cell wall (60-80 nm) composed of peptidoglycan, teichoic acid, and protein. Peptidoglycan of group A3 (with L-lysine as the diamino acid in position 3 of the peptide subunit and a glycine-rich interpeptide bridge) is a characteristic feature of this microbe, and the two predominant cross-bridges are COOH-Gly-Gly-Ser-Gly-Gly-NH2 and COOH-Ala-Gly-Ser-Gly-Gly-NH2. Alterations of these cross-bridges are implicated in glycopeptide resistance. \"S. haemolyticus\" teichoic acids are water-soluble polymers with repeating phosphodiester groups covalently linked to peptidoglycan. Peptidoglycan type L-Lys-Gly 3.5-4.0, L-Ser0.9-1.5 Teichoic acid contains both glycerol and N-acetylglucosamine. The major cell wall fatty acids are CBr-15, CBr-17, C18, and C20.\n\nCertain strains of \"S. haemolyticus\" are capable of producing a capsular polysaccharide (CP). \"S. haemolyticus\" strain JCSC1435 contains a capsule operon located within the “oriC environ”. This operon contains 13 ORFs in a 14,652-bp region and is referred to as the \"cap\" locus. The first seven genes of \"cap\" (\"capA\" through \"capG\") are homologous to the \"S. aureus\" \"cap5\" or \"cap8\" locus. However, \"capH\" through \"capM\" are unique to \"S. haemolyticus\", and this region encodes enzymes for a unique trideoxy sugar residue that is N-acylated by aspartic acid.\n\nCP production is influenced by culture medium and growth phase. Cultivation in tryptic soy broth (TSB)], TSB with 1% glucose, brain heart infusion broth, or Columbia broth with 2% NaCl favors the production of CP; cultivation on Columbia salt agar plates is suboptimal. Only trace amounts of CP are generated before the end of exponential phase, and the maximal rate of CP production does not occur until early stationary phase.\n\nCP is considered a virulence factor because it provides resistance against complement-mediated polymorphonuclear neutrophil phagocytosis.\n\nThe ability to adhere to medical devices and subsequently form biofilms is a major virulence factor associated with \"S. haemolyticus\". Biofilm formation increases antibiotic resistance and often leads to persistent infections. \"S. haemolyticus\" biofilms are not polysaccharide intercellular adhesin (PIA) dependent, and the lack of the \"ica\" operon (the gene cluster that encodes the production of PIA) can be used to distinguish \"S. haemolyticus\" isolates from other CoNS species.\n\nBiofilm formation is influenced by a variety of factors including carbohydrates, proteins, and extracellular DNA. Detachment assays with NaIO, proteinase K, or DNase result in 38%, 98%, and 100% detachment, respectively. The high level of detachment associated with DNase treatment has led several authors to suggest a cell-to-surface and/or cell-to-cell adhesion function for extracellular DNA. Biofilm formation also appears to be influenced by the presence of glucose and NaCl. Biofilm formation is enhanced when cultivated in TSB with 1% glucose and decreased when cultivated in TSB with 3% NaCl. The production of a capsular polysaccharide decreases biofilm formation.\n\nSubinhibitory concentrations (subminimum inhibitory concentrations) of the antibiotic dicloxacillin also affect the growth of \"S. haemolyticus\" biofilms. Biofilms formed in the presence of subinhibitory concentrations of dicloxacillin contain less biomass and have an altered composition. They are thinner, cover less surface area, and are less hydrophobic, but they also have an increased level of resistance to dicloxacillin.\n\nSome \"S. haemolyticus\" strains produce enterotoxins (SE) and/or hemolysins. In a study of 64 \"S. haemolyticus\" strains, production of SEA, SEB, SEC, and/or SEE was noted (only SED was absent). In addition, 31.3% of the strains were found to produce at least one type of enterotoxin.\n\n\"S. haemolyticus\" can be identified on the species level using a variety of manual and automated methods. The most frequently employed are: the reference method (based on growth tests), API ID 32 Staph (bioMe´rieux), Staph-Zym (Rosco), UZA (a rapid 4-h method), and polymerase chain reaction and electrophoretic analysis of the 16S rRNA, hsp60, or sodA gene sequence. Preference towards a particular method usually depends on convenience, economics, and required specificity (some species have identical 16S rRNA).\n\"S. haemolyticus\" is the second-most clinically isolated CoNS (\"S. epidermidis\" is the first) and it is considered an important nosocomial pathogen. Human infections include: native valve endocarditis, sepsis, peritonitis, and urinary tract, wound, bone, and joint infections. Infrequent soft-tissue infections usually occur in immunocompromised patients. Like other CoNS, \"S. haemolyticus\" is often associated with the insertion of foreign bodies, such as prosthetic valves, cerebrospinal fluid shunts, orthopedic prostheses, and intravascular, urinary, and dialysis catheters. \"S. haemolyticus\" is multi-drug resistant and able to form biofilms, which makes infections especially difficult to treat.\n\n\"S. haemolyticus\" can colonize central venous catheters and cause serious medical complications. Colonization occurs when \"S. haemolyticus\" migrates from the skin, along the external surface of the device, or from the hub, due to manipulation by health care workers. In either scenario, a high probability exists that the microbe will form a biofilm. These infections can remain localized or become systemic (i.e. bacteremia). The severity of infection varies depending on the type of catheter, frequency of manipulation, and virulence factors of the \"S. haemolyticus\" strain. Removal of the catheter is usually considered to be the best treatment, but this is not always possible. Alternatively, vancomycin or teicoplanin may be administered. Recent evidence suggests that glycopeptides can be supplemented with β-lactams to work synergistically.\n\n\"S. haemolyticus\" has the highest level of antibiotic resistance among the CoNS. Various strains are resistant to one or more of these antibiotics: penicillins, cephalosporins, macrolides, quinolones, tetracyclines, aminoglycosides, glycopeptides, and fosfomycin (see table in Genome structure), and multidrug resistance is common. As indicated above, even glycopeptide-resistant (vancomycin and teicoplanin) strains have begun to emerge.\n\n"}

From its inception in 1963 until 1998, it was operated by the Scarborough Board of Education.\n\nIt has 919 students . The school motto is \"\"\"\", which is Latin for \"Let the Zeal for Learning Flourish\".\n\nBy 1847, when Scarborough had grown to the point where an education system was more organized than the township's original, and a single school was required. The township established 16 School Sections, of which SS # 6 included the Woburn community. A school, also designated SS #6, was erected on Markham Road, just north of the 2nd Concession (Ellesmere Road). It was a one-story frame structure, with windows for light and a wood stove for heat. Between 1850 and 1862, Alexander Muir taught at SS #6. He composed \"The Maple Leaf Forever\", which for many years was Canada's unofficial national anthem; hence the maple leaf in the school crest.\n\nA second school site of , on Ellesmere Road just east of Markham Road, was purchased from James Purvis, the owner of the surrounding property, for $200 in 1862. The second SS # 6, Woburn Public School, was built on the site in 1863. In 1895, an addition to the back of the building expanded it to two rooms. A few years later, the convenience of two outdoor privies was finally added. The school operated this way until 1956. By then, though, the old school just could not keep up with the demands of modern education or with the enrollment resulting from suburban development which had reached the area in the 1950s.\n\nWhen the Scarborough Board of Education was formed in 1954, additional land for another new Woburn school was acquired for $21,000. In 1960, before the new school was built, it was officially named \"Woburn Collegiate Institute\". The Woburn building was designed by architects Parrott, Tambling and Witmer, and a construction contract worth $1.4 million was awarded in 1962 to Louis Donolo Ontario Ltd. The previous 1863-vintage S.S. # 6 was later demolished.\n\nWoburn Collegiate Institute opened on September 3, 1963 as Scarborough's ninth collegiate to a total enrollment of 443 students, and the ceremonial opening took place on November 28, 1963. Two major additions were completed at a cost of $2.6 million in 1965 and 1969, including a new auditorium and auto shop. In 1973, school enrollment reached a peak of 2,302 students.\n\nIn May 2013, Woburn C.I. celebrated its 50th anniversary.\n\nWoburn is a two-storey, building on of land, with 72 classrooms, 2 large gymnasia (which each may be divided into two smaller sections), a weight training room, a dance studio, an auto shop, two music rooms, two tech shops, a library (resource centre) and a 960-seat auditorium. The school also has a main office, a guidance office (student services) and an office for each of its departments. The building encloses a garden quadrangle, known by the students as \"The Quad\", which has a statue by Romanian-Canadian sculptor Sorel Etrog entitled \"Soma\". Identical statues can be found inside the Yonge-Eglinton Centre and York University's Accolade East building. Behind the school is a 400-m track, football field and goalposts for outdoor sports activities.\n\n, Woburn has 919 students. The school has also been the home for Scarborough's secondary gifted programme for exceptional students since 1978.\n\nThe SAC is selected by the Woburn students:\n\nThe SAC represents Woburn students at the school and in the community. The SAC organizes social activities and encourages school spirit. In the past SAC events have included dances, Charity Week activities, Spirit Week activities, Carnival, Woburn's Got Talent, Spirit Days, Grade 12 BBQ and the Semi-Formal. Funding for all clubs and most sports teams comes from the sale of SAC/ID cards and from fund-raising activities.\n\nPrefects are the good-will ambassadors of Woburn. Working closely with faculty, the Prefects of Woburn are responsible for making sure school events run smoothly, such as Welcome Day, photo days, and other various fairs such as the career and volunteer fairs. Furthermore, the Prefects also plan an annual event for the children at Woburn Jr. called Springfest.\n\nWoburn Robotics, formally known as Team 188, gathers every year to take part in the FIRST Robotics Competition, an international contest that teams students up with engineers and sponsors from local businesses to develop skills in science, technology, marketing, and leadership. In six intense weeks the team brainstorms, designs, constructs, and tests its 120-pound robot for the competition, whose objective is different every year. The robots are then immediately shipped off to compete in other tournaments. Team 188 is also an active participant in the VEX Robotics Competition, an annual precursor to the FIRST championship.\n\nWoburn Collegiate Institute is a Grade 9 to 12 school operates on a non-semestered system. From its founding until 2003, it previously had Grade 13, which was morphed into the Ontario Academic Credit (OAC) in 1984.\n\nThe flagship subject of Woburn academics is a part of many Woburn student's lives, and it is rightfully considered an extracurricular activity in itself. Perhaps the best method to describe Woburn's strength in mathematics is to look at the school's representation in the International Mathematical Olympiads (IMO). Canada first began sending the now six-member team to the event in 1981. Beginning with Woburn's first student representation at the event in 1986, over the next 18 years Woburn would be represented at the IMO an impressive eleven times, exceeding the representations of more famous academically elite high schools such as Earl Haig Secondary School (seven times), and Upper Canada College (five times).\n\nIn addition to the IMO, Woburn students have also gone on to represent Canada in the International Chemistry Olympiads (IChO) and International Physics Olympiads (IPhO).\n\nWoburn is noted for its excellence in computer science. PEG is a group of students who meet on a weekly basis after school to study advanced computer science topics, discuss algorithms and approaches to difficult problems, often on the level of the International Olympiad in Informatics (at which Woburn has been represented a total of twenty times). Topics covered and types of problems approached vary depending on competition entries.\n\nThe learning methods used vary as well: sometimes students meet in study groups with their leader teaching them and solving practice sheets or programming problems, sometimes they are taught by one of the senior students, sometimes they work on the problem as a team, and sometimes they are taught by their coaches.\n\nPEG students meet after school typically two nights per week to prepare for competitions in programming. Every year, members take part in competitions at provincial, national and international levels. PEG started its own competition in 1995, called the Woburn Challenge, to draw in both students from other schools and university students. This contest had grown to become province-wide (occasionally wider). The Woburn Challenge was discontinued in 2002 and restarted in October 2015.\n\nSince its formation in the early 1990s, PEG has participated in a large number of competitions.\n\nThe school is notable for its music programme, consisting of several hundred students in band and choir classes, a Madrigal Choir, a concert choir, a Chamber Choir, two concert bands, a Wind Ensemble, a jazz band and a jazz combo.\n\nThe ensembles of the music programme have regularly been invited to perform at national-level competitions and often make excursions to the US, including Orlando, Florida in mid-May, 2006. The Wind Ensemble and Madrigal Choir have done particularly well in competitions, consistently placing at or near the top of the standings. On February 17, 2006, the Wind Ensemble travelled to the Musicfest competition held at the Le Parc Hotel, in Markham, Ontario, playing at the highest level, B500. The band received a gold rating.\n\nWoburn's music department is student-represented by way of the Music Council, a body of elected students who help to keep the programme running smoothly. The Council plans and runs many events and fundraisers through the year.\n\nIn May 2012, Woburn's Festival Chorus, Festival Winds and Jazz band performed at MusicFest Nationals in Ottawa, Ontario. All three ensembles received a silver award.\n\nThe Woburn Rookie Drama Festival (usually just called Rookie) is a festival of short plays held annually every spring at Woburn. The most notable part of the festival is that all of its plays are directed, acted, crewed, and sometimes written entirely by students with no teacher assistance. Furthermore, students do all of the organization required to put on the festival each year and act as Masters of Ceremony. At over 40 years old, it is among the longest running high school clubs in the city. The first Woburn Rookie Drama Festival took place in the spring of 1963 and was overseen by then drama teacher John Wilcox.\n\nAny student who wants to direct a play is automatically accepted. A month before the festival, there is an open audition during which actors perform short scenes that are either improved or done with only a short time to prepare. Directors request the actors they want, and the organizers assign actors to plays (often the most popular actors are assigned to several plays in smaller roles). The festival itself lasts for one to three evenings with two to four plays per night. There are usually short scenes between plays.\nEvery year the festival has a theme chosen by the organizers. Sometimes the plays themselves are sometimes related to the theme, but normally the theme only applies to the short scenes between plays while the next cast is setting up. These scenes are usually directed or starring the MCs.\n\nAt Woburn, the school has the Three Rs system:\n\n\n\n"}

The village got its name from a type of river grass which became the favorite food for river terrapins. In early 20th century, British officers came to the villages to survey for new areas to be developed in Segamat district.\n\nThe British officers were surprised to see the river terrapins since they had not seen those animals before. They asked the villagers the name of those animals and the villagers answered, \"\"Labi-labi, tuan,\"\" (\"River terrapins, sir\"). Because they didn't know the name of those animals, the British officers referred to them as \"labis\" in the plural form. Therefore, the British officers decided to name the settlement Labis.\n\nAnother theory is that in the 17th century, a member of the Malaccan royal family was travelling through the area. He saw something that intrigued him. He called out to his advisors to tell him what it was, he went \"Habis? Habis?\" thus accidentally blurting out the name Labis.\n\nMalays here planted paddy field and poultry as the main source of food, living in villages such as Kampung Paya Merah, Kampung Tenang and Kampung Sungai Gatom.

It is in the Los Angeles Unified School District. It was established in 1931.\n\nAlexander Hamilton High School opened in fall 1931, with Thomas Hughes Elson as the principal. It was designed by architects John C. Austin and Frederick C. Ashley. The three-story administration building held the administration, library, and science departments and 24 classrooms. Other buildings were a manual training building, another for physical training, and a fourth for the cafeteria and \"domestic science.\" The capacity would be 1000, with plans permitting increasing to 2500. Building costs were $125,000 for the land, $400,000 for the structure, and $200,000 for equipment. Built in the Northern Italian Renaissance style, multicolored and patterned brickwork, elaborate cast stone decoration, and a bell tower clad in verdigris copper distinguish the building.\n\nIn May 1931, while Hamilton was under construction, architects Austin and Ashley were selected to design Griffith Observatory. Individually, each had designed a Carnegie library: Austin conceived the Anaheim Public Library (opened 1909), and Ashley drew up Los Angeles' Arroyo Seco branch library (opened 1914). Together, they had designed Monrovia High School (opened 1928 – its front stairs are like Hamilton's, and it also has a bell tower). Austin designed Los Angeles High School's third location (opened 1917; demolished 1971) and the Shrine Auditorium (opened 1926), and he was one of three designers of Los Angeles City Hall (opened January 1, 1928).\n\nThe school's builders were Sarver & Zoss. Three post offices they later built are on the National Register of Historic Places: the Beverly Hills Main Post Office (opened 1934); the San Pedro Post Office (opened 1935), and Los Angeles' Terminal Annex (opened 1940).\n\nAustin & Ashley later designed Hamilton's $100,000, six-room, auditorium, Waidelich Hall which opened on April 20, 1937. Arthur George Waidelich was the second principal (1935–1936) and died at the school. In February 21, 1989, the auditorium was renamed Norman J. Pattiz Concert Hall. A brass plaque made by the industrial arts department to commemorate the 1937 dedication was removed during renovation.\n\nEarly photographs from the school's archives show the campus in its pre-World War II state, with only the main building completed. The photos show dozens of 1920s and 30s cars parked along Robertson Boulevard in front of the school. The bell tower still exists today, but no longer houses a working bell.\n\nToday, there exist Brown Hall (which houses administrative offices, the library, and classrooms and is named in honor of Walker Brown, Principal (1940–1956), the lab building, the tech building, the humanities building, the music building, and other structures. There is a large Theater Hall, named Norman J. Pattiz Concert Hall), a cafeteria, two gym buildings (boys' and girls'), and a workshop building. On the west part of the campus is Los Angeles Department of Water and Power Distribution Station 20 and Cheviot Hills High School, a continuation school. The athletic fields include Al Michaels Field (a football and track stadium named for sportscaster Al Michaels, Hamilton's famous alum) and a community garden, the Hami Garden. The Hami Garden was a joint project funded by the South Robertson Neighborhood Council and the Hami High Environmental Club in 2009. It is maintained by community members and Hamilton High School students.\n\nIn 1932, its attendance boundaries extended as far north as Mulholland Highway.\nIn fall 2007, some neighborhoods zoned to Hamilton were rezoned to Venice High School.\n\nAs of 2011–2012:\n\n\nHamilton High is divided into six \"small learning communities,\" or SLCs,\" which coordinate their own curricula and staff. They are:\n\n\nDuring the 2008/2009 school year, the L & M (Leadership & Management) was eliminated and the students were placed in the four remaining non-magnet SLCs.\n\nThe Music Academy gained national attention in June of 2002 when the Disney Channel premiered the reality TV show \"Totally in Tune,\" which chronicled members of the Academy's Symphony Orchestra.\n\nThe Music Academy is a Grammy-recognized school.\n\nHamilton's school newspaper is called \"The Federalist\", a reference to and the original name of \"The Federalist Papers\" initiated and largely written by Alexander Hamilton. \"The Federalist\" has been archived by the Hamilton High Alumni Association.\n\nThe Humanities Magnet operates an editorial called \"Die WeltanshauunG\" (\"World View\").\n\nKeystone-Mentone complex, a student family housing facility of the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA), is zoned to Hamilton. Rose Avenue Apartments was previously zoned to Hamilton, but was rezoned to Venice High School in 2007.\n\nPalms Middle School, Webster Middle School and Marina Del Rey Middle School feed into Hamilton.

{"id": "2058367", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2058367", "title": "Badarian culture", "text": "Badarian culture\n\nThe Badarian culture provides the earliest direct evidence of agriculture in Upper Egypt during the Predynastic Era. It flourished between 4400 and 4000 BCE, and might have already emerged by 5000 BCE. It was first identified in , Asyut Governorate.\n\nAbout forty settlements and six hundred graves have been located. Social stratification has been inferred from the burying of more prosperous members of the community in a different part of the cemetery. The Badarian economy was based mostly on agriculture, fishing and animal husbandry. Tools included end-scrapers, perforators, axes, bifacial sickles and concave-base arrowheads. Remains of cattle, dogs and sheep were found in the cemeteries. Wheat, barley, lentils and tubers were consumed.\n\nThe Badari culture is primarily known from cemeteries in the low desert. The deceased were placed on mats and buried in pits with their heads usually laid to the south, looking west. This seems contiguous with the later dynastic traditions regarding the west as the land of the dead. The pottery that was buried with them is the most characteristic element of the Badarian culture. It had been given a distinctive, decorative rippled surface.\n\nBadari culture is so named because of its discovery at El-Badari (), an area in the Asyut Governorate in Upper Egypt. It is located between Matmar and Qau, approximately 200 km northwest of present-day Luxor (ancient Thebes). includes numerous Predynastic cemeteries (notably Mostagedda, Deir Tasa and the cemetery of itself), as well as at least one early Predynastic settlement at Hammamia. The area stretches for 30 km along the east bank of the Nile. It was first excavated by Guy Brunton and Gertrude Caton-Thompson between 1922 and 1931. Most of the local cemeteries have yielded distinctive pottery vessels (particularly red-polished ware with blackened tops), as well as terracotta and ivory anthropomorphic figures, slate palettes, stone vases and flint tools. The contents of Predynastic cemeteries at have been subjected to a number of analyses attempting to clarify the chronology and social history of the Badarian period.\n\nPopulations in the Badari culture planted wheat and barley, and kept cattle, sheep, and goats; their livestock was given ceremonial burial. They used boomerangs, fished from the Nile and hunted gazelle. Little is known of their buildings, although remains of wooden stumps have been found at one site and may have been associated with a hut or shelter of unknown construction. Pits that have been found may have served as granaries. Some Badarian sites also show evidence of later predynastic use. The Badarians discovered that malachite could be heated into copper beads. They wore jewelry made of ivory, copper and quartz. Amulets in the shape of animals such as the antelope and hippopotamus have been found.\n\nBadarian grave goods were relatively simple and the deceased wrapped in reed matting or animal skins and placed with personal items such as shells or stone beads. Green malachite ore, perhaps used for personal decoration, has also been detected on stone palettes. Their dead were generally buried facing west, and sometimes accompanied by female mortuary figures carved from ivory.\n\nBasalt vases found at Badari sites were most likely traded up the river from the Delta region or from the northwest. Shells came in quantities from the Red Sea. Turquoise possibly came from Sinai. A Syrian connection is suggested for a four-handled pot of hard pink ware. The black pottery, with white incised designs, may have come directly from the West, or from the South. The porphyry slabs are like the later ones in Nubia, but the material could have come from the Red Sea Mountains. The glazed steatite beads were not made locally. These all suggest that the Badarians were not an isolated tribe, but were in contact with the cultures on all sides of them. Nor were they nomadic, having pots of such size and fragility that would have been unsuitable for use by wanderers.\n\nThe Badarian culture seems to have had multiple sources, of which the Western Desert was probably the most influential. Badari culture was likely not to have been solely restricted to the Badari region since related finds have been made farther to the south at Mahgar Dendera, Armant, Elkab and Nekhen (named \"Hierakonpolis\" by the Greeks), as well as to the east in the Wadi Hammamat.\n\nDental trait analysis of Badarian fossils found that they were closely related to other Afroasiatic-speaking populations inhabiting Northeast Africa and the Maghreb. Among the ancient populations, the Badarians were nearest to other ancient Egyptians (Naqada, Hierakonpolis, Abydos and Kharga in Upper Egypt; Hawara in Lower Egypt), and C-Group and Pharaonic era skeletons excavated in Lower Nubia, followed by the A-Group culture bearers of Lower Nubia, the Kerma and Kush populations in Upper Nubia, the Meroitic, X-Group and Christian period inhabitants of Lower Nubia, and the Kellis population in the Dakhla Oasis. Among the recent groups, the Badari makers were morphologically closest to the Shawia and Kabyle Berber populations of Algeria as well as Bedouin groups in Morocco, Libya and Tunisia, followed by other Afroasiatic-speaking populations in the Horn of Africa. The Badarian skeletons from Kellis were also phenotypically distinct from those belonging to other populations in Sub-Saharan Africa.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2058370", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2058370", "title": "Doctor Sivana", "text": "Doctor Sivana\n\nDoctor Thaddeus Bodog Sivana is a fictional supervillain appearing in comic books published by DC Comics. Created by Bill Parker and C. C. Beck, the character is the archenemy of the superhero Captain Marvel, both of whom first appeared in \"Whiz Comics\" #2 (cover-dated February 1940) by Fawcett Comics. A mad scientist and inventor bent on world domination, Sivana was soon established as Captain Marvel's archenemy and most frequent Golden Age foe, appearing in over half of the Fawcett \"Captain Marvel\" stories published between 1939 and 1953.\n\nSivana has kept his role as one of the key archenemies of Captain Marvel, now also known as Shazam, through to the character's appearances in DC Comics, which eventually acquired the rights to Fawcett's superhero characters. In 2009, Doctor Sivana was ranked as IGN's 82nd-greatest comic book villain of all time.\n\nThe character made his cinematic debut in the DC Extended Universe 2019 film \"Shazam!\", portrayed by Mark Strong.\n\nInfamously evil, Doctor Sivana appeared in well over half of all of the Golden Age Captain Marvel comic stories, and in all of the first four stories, after having deduced Captain Marvel's dual identity as boy radio broadcaster Billy Batson early on. Depicted as a brilliant, if evil, scientist, Sivana used all manner of unusual inventions and techniques against the Marvels. He was at first a good man who wanted to help humanity, but big business, bosses and other concerns blocked and checked him and even called him mad, until, embittered, he turned against humanity and moved to Venus. He somehow held high status among the beings of the planet Venus. He returned to Earth, establishing himself as a villain, and clashed with Capt. Marvel in the latter's first fight. Along with the Marvel Family, Sivana entered publishing limbo in 1953, following a ruling in the \"National Comics Publications v. Fawcett Publications\" court case finding that Captain Marvel was an illegal infringement of Superman.\n\nNational Comics (today DC Comics) acquired the rights to the Captain Marvel characters in 1972, relaunching them in a new title, \"Shazam!\" the following February. The characters' twenty-year absence from publication was explained as the result of Doctor Sivana and the Sivana Family having trapped the Marvels, their friends, other superheroes, and, by accident, themselves in a sphere of Suspendium, due to Sivana Jr. distracting Doctor Sivana by slapping him on the back in congratulation, and making him crash the spaceship into the Suspendium sphere, a compound that kept them in suspended animation from 1953 until 1973. They were released when the Suspendium sphere neared the Sun, melting it enough that Captain Marvel was revived, he and the other Marvels then pushed it back to Earth. The Sivanas escaped in their spaceship, but were captured by Captain Marvel in the same issue despite another attempt at world domination. He still makes many attempts at world domination, including a multi-issue storyline where he traveled across America, threatening to destroy entire cities unless he was acknowledged as Rightful Ruler of the Universe. In \"Shazam!\" #28 he was responsible for bringing Black Adam back using his reincarnation machine.\n\nSivana continued to appear in \"Shazam!\"-related stories through the \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\" limited series in 1985. He was reintroduced by Roy Thomas and Tom Mandrake in the miniseries \"\" in 1987. This Sivana was the same mad scientist that the previous one had been, except that he only had two children (Beautia and Magnificus), and was Billy Batson's step-uncle.\n\nJerry Ordway revised the character of Sivana for his 1994 graphic novel \"The Power of Shazam!\" and the resulting ongoing series, and this revision has been retained in all following DC publications. The modern Sivana, in addition to being a mad scientist, was also a powerful and influential tycoon (\"a la\" Lex Luthor of the \"Superman\" comics). The former CEO of his own Sivana Industries, Sivana's corrupted dealings and crossing of Captain Marvel led to his own destruction and his intense hatred of the Marvel Family. Beautia and Magnificus Sivana are reintroduced again in this series; their mother, Sivana's ex-wife Venus, is briefly seen in \"Power of Shazam!\" #27.\n\nAfter \"The Power of Shazam!\" series ended in 1999, Sivana was rarely seen until \"Outsiders\" #13–15 (August–October 2004), in which he reorganizes the supervillain group the Fearsome Five, appointing himself leader. Sivana and his four associates Mammoth, Psimon, Jinx, and Shimmer (a fifth, Gizmo, is killed by Sivana for challenging the scientist's position as resident genius) continued to appear at irregular intervals in the pages of \"Outsiders\".\n\nSivana is a short, bald, self-described mad scientist with a penchant for developing unusual technologies. He often plots to do away with Captain Marvel and his Marvel Family, but is usually thwarted in his plans. His trademark phrases are \"Curses! Foiled again!\" and his mocking laughter \"Heh! Heh! Heh!\" He also coined the insulting name Big Red Cheese to refer to Captain Marvel, a name that the Captain's friends have adopted with which to light-heartedly tease him.\nThaddeus Bodog Sivana, born in 1892, began with the best intentions and was one of Europe's best scientific minds, with progressive scientific ideas that could revolutionize industry but were rejected by everyone he approached. Laughed out of society by people who called his inventions impractical and his science a fake, Sivana took his family to the planet Venus in a spaceship he had invented. There he stayed until his children were grown, and Earth not as backward as when he left it. (Since his children were adults by 1940, his departure from Earth would implicitly have been the late 1910s or early 1920s.) During his years away, struggling to tame the Venusian jungle, Sivana turned bitter and planned his revenge against the world that had shunned him. He initially plotted his revenge with a radio silencer that would disable all radio communications permanently. He tried to extort $50 million, only to be stopped by Captain Marvel in his first adventure. Cap broke through the window of the building where Sivana was hiding and defeated the guards, binding them securely with tubing ripped from the radio-silencer. Sivana planned to kill Captain Marvel with a blast from his Atom-Smasher, but Cap leaped back out the window and escaped. During the fight, Sivana's returning army angrily asked why Captain Marvel had defeated them in their war against America despite their highly advanced weaponry. Sivana appeared to have been killed by the Atom-Smasher blast, but he returned a short time later, having somehow learned Captain Marvel's identity. He sent a letter to Billy Batson to lure him to the planet Venus, disguising himself as 'Professor Xerxes Smith'. Sivana's henchmen bound and gagged Batson, and Sivana tried to take away his memory using a Memory Mangler. Billy regained his memory after stumbling into the cave of Shazam and accidentally saying the word \"Shazam\". Sivana's henchmen rebelled against him and set off an explosion that destroyed the Mangler. Ironically, Captain Marvel saved Sivana and his daughter Beautia, who the henchmen had left to die. Sivana continued to nurse a megalomaniacal grudge against humanity and also a personal enmity with the Marvel Family. This persisted even after Cap revealed Sivana's former benevolent inventions (which Sivana considered useless), leading to his being awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics. Far from being pleased, Sivana was insulted by the prize and stated that only when he was crowned Ruler of the Universe would he consider himself properly honored.\n\nThe Golden Age Sivana was a twice-widowed father with four children: good-natured adult daughter Beautia who, when first seen, was Empress of Venus. Beautia has bewitching beauty which affects men like a drug, which Sivana once used to try to make her win an election. Beautia's remaining siblings include the Super-strong Magnificus, and evil teenagers Georgia and Thaddeus Sivana, Jr. As the Sivana Family, Sivana, Georgia and Sivana Jr. attempted to destroy Captain Marvel, Mary Marvel, and Captain Marvel Jr., respectively. They traveled through time using the Rock Of Eternity to various points in the history of Atlantis (Ancient, Modern, and Future). There they attempted to steal technology to build a machine that would create a barrier around the Earth, thereby preventing the Marvels from calling down lightning. Georgia and Jr. possess brilliant minds like their father, and share his enmity with the Marvel Family, but Magnificus and Beautia rarely fight the Marvels. In fact, Beautia has an unrequited crush on Captain Marvel, not realizing that he is really an adolescent boy.\n\nFollowing the \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\" miniseries, Sivana was first reintroduced as Billy Batson's step-uncle in a 1987 miniseries, \"Shazam! The New Beginning\". Magnificus and Beautia were depicted as his only children.\n\nA second retcon in 1994 established Sivana as a wealthy tycoon with political influence, similar to Lex Luthor, only to have the events surrounding an archaeological expedition to Egypt he sponsored lead to both the creation of Captain Marvel and the fall of Sivana's fortunes. Blaming Captain Marvel for his fall from grace, Sivana dedicated himself wholeheartedly to using his inventions and intellect against the Marvel Family. In current continuity, Sivana's ex-wife Venus is still alive, as are all four Sivana children. They resemble their Pre-Crisis counterparts.\n\nThe evil scientist appears briefly in the \"Infinite Crisis\" storyline. Sivana also appeared along with Lex Luthor in the four-issue 2005 limited series \"Superman/Shazam: First Thunder\" by Judd Winick and Joshua Middleton, which depicts the first meeting between Superman and Captain Marvel.\n\nIn the 2006–2007 limited series \"52\", Sivana was abducted to Oolong Island, a tropical paradise run by Intergang, where he and many other DC Universe \"mad scientists\" are allowed to live a hedonistic lifestyle while creating the inventions of their wildest dreams and pitting them against one another. They create the Four Horsemen of the Apokolips and succeed in capturing Black Adam, whom Sivana then tortures for weeks, until Adam is freed by heroes storming the island. Georgia and Thaddeus Jr. were reintroduced in \"52\" Week Twenty-Six (November 1, 2006), in which they appear alongside Beautia, Magnificus, and their mother Venus, who wants Sivana found and has a charity dinner with the Black Marvel family.\n\nDr. Sivana turned out to be indirectly responsible for the main conflict of \"52\": disruptions in the fictional time stream caused by a mutated Mister Mind. Sivana had captured Mind, a worm who happened to be another of Captain Marvel's villains, and the scientist had bombarded it with treatments of Sivana's own \"Suspendium\" time-travel compound. As a result, Mr. Mind mutated (or, according to himself, matured—as he had apparently been in larval form all this time) into a \"hyperfly\", a (sometimes) planet-sized moth-like figure with the ability to travel in time and across realities, posing a serious threat to the Multiverse. He is finally thrown back in time to the day where Dr. Sivana found him.\n\nOn the cover of \"Justice League of America\" #13 (vol. 2), it shows Doctor Sivana as a member of the new Injustice League. Doctor Sivana is one of the villains featured in \"Salvation Run\".\n\nIn the 2008 miniseries \"Final Crisis\", he is placed on the new Society's inner circle by Libra. Dr. Sivana was with Libra when Calculator was accused of sending computer codes that would help the resistance. Sivana joins with Lex Luthor in betraying Libra, after being made to watch one of his own daughters succumb to the Anti-Life Equation. Sivana creates a device to shut down the Justifiers' helmets, allowing Luthor to attack Libra.\n\nDoctor Sivana later shows up as a member of Cheetah's Secret Society of Super Villains.\n\nIn September 2011, The New 52 rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, Doctor Sivana first appears in \"Justice League\" #7, depicted as a respected scientist desperate to save his family from an unknown plight. With science having failed him, he turns to magic (specifically the legend of Black Adam). Dr. Sivana's team finds what he believes to be the tomb of Black Adam; while attempting to open it, the scientist is half-blinded by magical lightning to the face (which has the side-effect of letting him see magic).\n\nAfter Doctor Sivana's alliance with Black Adam fails, he heads to the Rock of Eternity where he can't get in because of a magical shield. He cries out for someone to help him save his family saying that while science has failed them, magic could save them. A voice is then heard saying it is indeed possible. The voice also says it has been watching him with the magic eating away his body but not his mind. Doctor Sivana asks for the voice's name and discovers a caterpillar-like creature trapped in a bottle. The creature claims that people call him Mister Mind and makes note that he and Doctor Sivana shall be the \"best of friends.\" Introduced as a well-built man of average height, using his magic-seeing eye causes Doctor Sivana to slowly wither to a form resembling his stooped, traditional Fawcett appearance.\n\nIn the fifth installment of the \"Multiversity\" series, \"Thunderworld\" (December 2014), Thaddeus Sivana of Earth-5 (a world populated by traditional interpretations of \"Shazam!\" characters) coordinates with his doppelgangers from many of the 52 worlds of the Multiverse to defeat the Marvel Family of Earth-5 and, eventually, conquer the remaining DC Multiverse. He has his three offspring Thaddeus Jr, Georgia and Magnificus storm the Marvel Family's Rock of Eternity and seize control of it, pitting themselves against their opponents, but soon finds he has been betrayed by the Legion of Sivanas and is defeated. The Legion continues to feature heavily in later chapters of \"The Multiversity\". They invade Earth 42 and cull many of its heroes in \"Guidebook\", and sell weapons sourced from alternate worlds to the Freedom Fighters of Earth 10 in \"Mastermen\".\n\nIn the \"Watchmen\" sequel \"Doomsday Clock\", Doctor Sivana is among the villains that attend the underground meeting held by Riddler that talks about the Superman Theory. He is among the villains that do not want to relocate to Kahndaq.\n\nSivana, now in an alliance with Mister Mind, is seen attending an appointment at a doctor's clinic. With Mister Mind inside his ear, Sivana, in possession of an encyclopedia of magical monsters, asks Mind about some of the various magical monsters named in the book. When he goes to see the doctor, Sivana attacks him and is ordered to cut out his tongue by Mister Mind, as it is vital for a spell.\n\nIn order for Black Adam to distract the Shazam Family while he and Doctor Sivana went to the Monsterlands to free the Monster Society of Evil, Mister Mind summoned the Seven Deadly Enemies of Man who assist him. Mister Mind and Doctor Sivana head to the Monsterlands in order to build the Monster Society of Evil from its inhabitants. As King Kid fights the Shazam Family in Philadelphia, Doctor Sivana and Mister Mind are directed to a boat by Dummy who cannot accompany them since he cannot deal with water. When they arrive at the Dungeon of Eternity, Mister Mind states to Doctor Sivana that the inmates of the Dungeon of Eternity were gathered from all over the Magiclands and imprisoned for challenging the Council of Wizards. In addition, Mister Mind stated that the Monsterlands used to be called the Gods' Realm until the day of Black Adam's betrayal which led them to strip the gods of their powers and close the doors to the Magiclands. They find a small prison containing Superboy-Prime in the Monsterlands as Superboy-Prime states that he can hear what Mister Mind is saying. Mister Mind and Doctor Sivana begin their plans to free the Monster Society of Evil from the Dungeon of Eternity. Mister Mind senses the fight between the Shazam Family and Mamaragan as he instructs Doctor Sivana to stab his magical eye with a dagger which starts to melt the doors to the cells holding the Monster Society of Evil. Then Mister Mind started to control C.C. revealing to Billy that he is using him as a host and not Doctor Sivana. Mister Mind states to the Shazam Family that he plans to use C.C. to unite the Magiclands under his rule. He then proceeds to summon the Monster Society of Evil and Doctor Sivana to his side.\n\nDoctor Sivana has genius-level intellect. In addition, he can see magic with his left eye.\nDoctor Sivana once discovered a mathematical formula which, when recited, allowed him to walk through walls and solid objects, making himself almost impossible to imprison or even catch. By the end of the Pre-Crisis stories, Captain Marvel supplies a material called Marvelium to create a prison cell that prevents that effect, thus containing Dr. Sivana.\n\n\n\n\nDr. Thaddeus Sivana appears in DC Films' \"Shazam!\", portrayed by Mark Strong as an adult and Ethan Pugiotto as a child. In this version, Thaddeus is alienated from his abusive father, the CEO of Sivana Industries, and his unsympathetic brother Sid. During a car ride with them in 1974, he is whisked away to the Rock of Eternity by the wizard Shazam, who summons Thaddeus as part of his quest for a champion who is sufficiently pure of heart to be the vessel of his powers. Shazam rejects Sivana when he proves easily corrupted by the temptation of demons called the Seven Deadly Sins. His abrupt return to his father's car results in a vehicular accident that renders his father a paraplegic, for which Sid blames him. After embarking on a lifelong quest to return to Shazam's lair, he succeeds in doing so decades later and steals the Eye of Sin, a talisman with which he can summon the Seven Sins to use his body as a vessel, granting him magical powers, which he promptly uses to murder his father and brother. This prompts Shazam to select 14-year-old Billy Batson as his new champion, leading to a confrontation between him and Sivana. When he and the Seven Deadly Enemies of Man fight Shazam and his now-powered foster siblings in the conflict, Doctor Sivana was defeated by Shazam and the Seven Deadly Sins are re-imprisoned. In the mid-credits, Doctor Sivana is in his cell writing symbols on the walls until his pencil breaks. He is approached by Mister Mind who strikes an allegiance with him.\n\n\nAn alternate universe version of Doctor Sivana appears in \"\" (a companion to \"Justice League: Gods and Monsters\"), voiced by Daniel Hagen.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2058376", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2058376", "title": "Turners Cross (stadium)", "text": "Turners Cross (stadium)\n\nTurners Cross is an all-seater football stadium located in and synonymous with the district of Turners Cross in Cork, Ireland. It is home to the Munster Football Association, and League of Ireland side Cork City.\n\nIt was the first all-seated, all-covered stadium in Ireland following redevelopment in 2009, and it is currently one out of only two, the other being the Aviva Stadium.\n\nCork City play their home games in the stadium. The ground also sees a large volume of matches every year under the auspices of both the Munster F.A. and the F.A.I., including local, regional, national, and international matches and cup finals at schoolboy, junior, intermediate, senior, and underage international level.\n\nFor many years Turners Cross was little more than a pitch with a few grassy banks and a covered terrace euphemistically called \"The Shed\". However, since the early 2000s, the stadium has been redeveloped by the Munster F.A. to become the only stadium in use in the League of Ireland that is all seated and all covered on all four sides.\n\nAs of 2015, the configuration of the stadium consists of the 1,857-seat covered \"Donie Forde Stand\", which holds the stadium control box, press broadcasting area, and the family section. This is faced by the 1,128-seat covered \"Derrynane Road\" stand.\n\nAt the western end of the ground is the covered St. Anne's Stand which has a capacity of 2,720. The newest stand (the \"Joe Delaney Stand\") is at the eastern end, on a site previously occupied by \"The Shed\". The Shed previously held over 2,500 supporters and was home to Cork City F.C.'s more vocal fans. This newly developed section seats 1,660 and was opened in March 2007.\n\nWhile known locally and amongst fans as \"The Cross\", the ground has also been nicknamed \"The Box\" in the past. This accounts for the title of Plunkett Carter's book on Cork soccer, \"From The Lodge to The Box\", where 'the lodge' refers to 'Flower Lodge'. \"Flower Lodge\" was originally owned by the Ancient Order of Hibernians and was the previous home of Cork soccer. This ground was subsequently sold to the Gaelic Athletic Association, and renamed \"Páirc Uí Rinn\", for Christy Ring, a noted County Cork hurler.\n\nCork Constitution, then a rugby and cricket club, was the first club to lease the Turners Cross grounds in 1897. (A once popular trivia question was \"Which President of Ireland scored a penalty at Turners Cross?\" The answer is Éamon de Valera (1882–1975) who in his early years played rugby for Rockwell. The penalty in question was during a Rockwell vs Cork Constitution rugby match in the Munster Cup.) \n\nTurners Cross was in use for association football by 1905, and gaelic games by the 1920s. Something of a battle developed to acquire permanent use of the grounds in the 1920s. Nemo Rangers secured the ground in 1926, and sought help from the Cork County Board to make the situation permanent. However costs forced Nemo to abandon it in 1929, with the Munster Football Association subsequently stating that they had 'acquired' the ground at their AGM two weeks later. In order to provide a long-term home for the Munster F.A. and Cork soccer, the FAI negotiated a 98-year lease on Turners Cross with the land's owner Helena O'Sullivan. Subsequently, during the 1940s, Cork United (whose home grounds were at the Mardyke) also used the ground for training matches and 'B' team matches. In January 1947, following extensive flooding in the city, Cork United switched a league match with Drumcondra to the Cross at reputedly 15 minutes notice.\n\nWhen Evergreen United were elected to the League of Ireland in 1951, they became sub-tenants of the FAI at the ground in a sharing arrangement with the Munster F.A. Evergreen later changed their name to Cork Celtic. After winning their first (and only) Dublin City Cup, by defeating Drumcondra in the final, which was held at the Cross, the next day's Irish Press stated, \"Turner's Cross ground itself is not conducive to good football, and there was absolutely no atmosphere.\" Celtic themselves made it clear that without owning the ground it would only ever have a basic level of upkeep. \n\nAt the start of the 1977/78 season, Celtic again looked for a longer lease on the ground in order to develop it for the purpose of raising additional income. The club had been in decline since winning the League in 1974, and saw developing it as their only means of survival. The FAI's legal advisers had previously been unable to find the property owner or their original lease, however a complex ownership structure was eventually unravelled. Unable to resolve the tenancy situation with the FAI, Celtic spent no money on the upkeep of the Cross and it was eventually deemed unfit for use by the League for the 1978/79 season. As a result, the club moved to Flower Lodge for what would be their final season - being expelled from the League in the summer of 1979. Despite this, Cork Celtic's holding company still held the sub-lease. \n\nIn 1980 a legal wrangle arose when Cork United (who, as Albert Rovers, had replaced Cork Hibernians in the League in 1976) announced plans to move from Flower Lodge to Turners Cross. Cork United were hoping that the ground's location and more compact space would attract more supporters. However the trustees of the defunct Cork Celtic club, still holding the sub-lease, demanded £10,000 to relinquish it. With the help of Des Casey of Dundalk F.C. (the League's representative on the board of the FAI), the situation was resolved, which allowed Cork United to call the ground 'home' for the next two seasons. The playing surface remained notoriously bad, however, being branded 'the worst in the League', with Cork United also promising to upgrade the ground in the event of the lease situation being resolved. After Cork United were expelled from the League in 1982 the FAI closed the ground, then sold its interest in it to the Munster Football Association the following year. \n\nThe Munster F.A. initiated a programme of ground improvements, spending approx £80,000 initially, and the ground was reopened in May 1985. League of Ireland football was supposed to return to the Cross that Autumn via Amby Fogarty's new Cork Hibernians side. However the club was removed from the League of Ireland without playing a game as the Munster F.A. refused the new team a lease on the ground unless they had their own public liability insurance, which Hibernians could not afford. Cork City, who had played their first two seasons in Flower Lodge after being elected to the League of Ireland in 1984, then sought a move to become tenants of the MFA at Turners Cross due to the cost of insurance at the Lodge. The move was granted by the Munster F.A. Meanwhile the M.F.A. proceeded with the next stages of its planned improvements. A grant of £30,000 in 1989 was spent on cosmetic improvements to complete 'Phase Two'.\n\nHaving failed to buy Flower Lodge in 1988, Cork City moved to their own ground in Bishopstown in 1992. With Cork City gone, the Munster F.A. were able to announce plans to invest up to £1.5 million in the ground. Work on the main stand (what would become the Donie Ford Stand) costing £300,000 (made up of a government grant of £200,000 and an F.A.I. contribution of £100,000) was announced in 1996, bringing the stated spending to approx £750,000, with the work being completed in 1998. But Cork City's move to Bishopstown backfired and, following bankruptcy, the club returned to Turners Cross as tenants in 1996, where it has remained to date.\n\nIn 2000 the Munster F.A. received a grant of £100,000 from the Department of Sport for further investment. This started a new round of development in the first decade of the new century, where the Derrynane side of the ground was made all-seater, a covered all-seated stand was installed at the St. Anne's Road End of the ground, and the 'Shed' was replaced by a new, covered, all-seater stand - the Joe Delaney Stand.\n\nTurners Cross has hosted a small number of men's senior internationals, including a friendly between the national team and Belarus in May 2016 (1–2), and a \"B\" team fixture against England in 1990 (4–1). Elsewhere in Cork, Flower Lodge hosted a full international on 26 May 1985 between Ireland and Spain (0–0), while The Mardyke hosted Ireland vs Hungary in 1939 (2–2). The stadium has also hosted eight Republic of Ireland under-21 national football team games and other international underage games – including games in the 1994 UEFA European Under-16 Football Championship.\n\nIn addition to soccer, rugby and gaelic games, boxing and gymkhana events have also been held at Turners Cross over the years.\nOn 16 October 2017, ex-hurricane Ophelia blew the roof off the Derrynane Road stand.\n\n"}

It was commissioned in 1927 by Rev Daniel Cohalan D.D., Bishop of Cork. The church was the first Irish church to be built from concrete instead of brick, and is one of the largest suspended-ceiling churches in Europe. Opened in 1931, the church is based on the principles of Art Deco which makes strong use of symmetric and geometric forms.\n\nRocque's map of Cork of 1759 is the first to show significant housing in the Turners Cross area in the areas that are now Evergreen St (then Maypole Lane) and Quaker Rd (then Graveyard Lane). Previous maps of Cork in 1690 and 1726 show only occasional houses associated with what were then farms on the southern edge of Cork City. The oldest housing still existing in Turners Cross now dates from the mid 19th century.\n\nIn 1879, the Cork and Macroom Direct Railway, which had shared the Cork, Bandon and South Coast Railway station at Albert Road in the city centre, moved its city terminus to a new station they created - Cork Capwell railway station in the Turners Cross area. This was used until 1925, when both the Cork and Macroom and Cork, Bandon and South Coast railways were merged into Great Southern Railways and the terminus reverted to Albert Road.\n\nNew housing was continually developed in the Turners Cross area until the 1950s, when there was little remaining spare land in the area.\n\nTurners Cross is home to Cork City FC which is based in the Turners Cross Stadium.\n\nNearby there is also a rugby stadium, Musgrave Park, which is home to both Dolphin RFC and Sundays Well RFC. In addition, Musgrave Park is used for many home matches in the Pro14 tournament by Munster Rugby.\n\nThe local GAA club is Nemo Rangers, although they sold their grounds in Turners Cross for housing and relocated to a new location in Douglas during the Celtic Tiger era.\n\nThe main primary school in the area is \"Bunscoil Chríost Rí\", which is a Catholic mixed (co-educational) school. The secondary schools in the area are \"Christ King\", a girls only school, and \"Coláiste Chríost Rí\", a boys school.\n\nTurners Cross takes its name from an important junction, where the road from Cork to Kinsale separated from one of the roads to Douglas and Carrigaline. The road to Douglas and Carrigaline is now the R851.\n\nThe N27 dual-carriageway, which links Cork City Centre to Cork Airport passes through Turners Cross. This handles the bulk of the traffic that used the road to Kinsale.\n\nSeveral bus routes serve Turners Cross, including route 203 (from Farranree to Ballyphehane via Turners Cross), 206 (Grange to Cork City Centre), 219 (Mahon to Bishopstown and CIT), and regional bus route 226 (Kent Station to Kinsale).\n\nAlthough both the Cork-Macroom and Cork, Bandon and South Coast railways previously went through Turners Cross, it is not currently served by rail. The nearest active railway station is Cork Kent railway station.\n"}

It was first brought to Western culture by Sakura Nyoichi, better known as George Ohsawa, as part of the Macrobiotic Diet, based a recipe widely used in traditional Japan. Brown rice is its primary and can be its only solid ingredient. Many kokkoh recipes include other whole grains, seeds and seasonings, most commonly sweet rice, azuki beans, sesame seeds, oats, barley, soybeans and kombu.\n\nBroadly speaking, the term \"kokkoh\" may be applied to any dish in which cereals are diluted in water. However, the rice dish discussed here is by far the most common form.\n\nNo matter which cereals are used in a kokkoh recipe, preparation is similar and simple. The cereals are soaked in water for two to three hours. Additional water is then added, and the mixture boiled or pressure cooked to completion. In some cases, the cereals are toasted in a dry skillet, or roasted in sesame oil before cooking takes place.\n\nKokkoh is recommended as both a substitute for mother's milk and a means of weaning infants from it. (In the former case the recipe often calls only for brown rice ground to a fine powder and water.) Besides its soft and easily digestible texture, kokkoh is recommended as such because its mixture has a high and varied protein content; combined, the amino acids in each of the ingredients described at the outset include virtually all those needed for consumption. It is thus especially well suited for the growth needs of a child. When used solely for weaning, it is recommended that kokkoh be introduced at between 8 months and a year of age. It may be used as breast milk substitute as early as five months, but with a larger proportion of water, in order to further dilute the mixture.\n\nKokkoh is also an important part of the macrobiotic diet, in accordance with the diet's heavy emphasis upon grains. Along with its use as a means of weaning, kokkoh is a common breakfast food among macrobiotic eaters of all ages.\n\nIf kokkoh is used as a milk replacements for infants, it can lead to unnatural weight gain and iron or vitamin B12 deficiencies.\n\n"}

{"id": "2058414", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2058414", "title": "Yemenia", "text": "Yemenia\n\nYemenia () is the flag carrier airline of Yemen, based in Sana'a. It operates scheduled domestic and international passenger flights to destinations in Africa and the Middle East, as well as to Asia and Europe out of its hubs at Sana'a International Airport, and to a lesser extent Aden International Airport. Yemenia is a member of the Arab Air Carriers Organization.\n\nYemenia dates its origins back to \"Yemen Airlines\", a company that was founded in the second half of the 1940s and owned by Ahmad bin Yahya, then King of Yemen.\n\nWhen the Yemen Arab Republic was proclaimed in 1962, Yemen Airlines was issued a new airline licence on 4 August of that year (which remains valid until today), thus becoming the flag carrier of the country, with its head office in the Ministry of Communication Building in Sana'a. In 1967, the airline entered a co-operation with United Arab Airlines, which lasted until 1972. During that period, it was known as \"Yemen Arab Airlines\".\nIn September 1972 and following nationalisation Yemen Airlines was reorganised and renamed \"Yemen Airways Corporation (YAC)\". At March 1975 YAC had 60 employees; the airline's fleet consisted of four DC-6Bs and four DC-3s that served domestic destinations and an international network that included Asmara, Cairo, Djibouti, Dhahran, Jeddah and Kuwait. On lease from World Airways, YAC operated a pair of Boeing 737-200 aircraft for two and a half years until the carrier ordered an aircraft of the type in mid-1976. In early 1977, a new airline was jointly established by the governments of the Yemen Arab Republic and Saudi Arabia, with both countries holding 51% and 49% of the shares, respectively, and the name \"Yemen Airways\" was adopted on 1 July 1978. In April 1978, a two-year contract for the provision of two Boeing 707-320Cs that included the supply of aircrews and engineering support was signed with British Midland Airways (BMA). In July 1979, the carrier signed a three-year agreement with Pan Am for the provision of technical maintenance and personal training. Two de Havilland Canada Dash 7s were ordered. The unilateral cancellation of the contract signed with BMA by Yemen Airways led the British carrier to file a claim against the Yemeni airline, which resulted in the impoundment of one of its Boeing 727-200s.\n\nAt July 1980 the workforce was 750 and chairmanship was held by Shaif M. Saeed. By this time, five Boeing 727-200s, two Boeing 737-200s, one Douglas DC-6A and three DC-3s made up the airline's fleet. Domestic scheduled passenger services linked Sana'a with Baydhan, Hodeida, Mareb and Taiz; Abu Dhabi, Athens, Cairo, Damascus, Dhahran, Dubai, Jeddah, Karachi, Kuwait, Muscat, Rome and Sharjah were part of the international network. Cargo services were also undertaken. The two Dash 7s were part of the fleet by March 1985, along with five Boeing 727-200s and one Boeing 737-200, and the airline had expanded its route network to include Amsterdam, Bombay, Frankfurt, Larnaca and London-Gatwick. The number of employees had grown to 1,100.\n\nWhen South Yemen was united with the Yemen Arab Republic to form today's Yemen in 1990, plans were made to form a single national airline by merging South Yemen's Alyemda into Yemenia. To achieve this, the shares held by Saudi Arabia were bought back by the government of Yemen in 1992. The merger took place in 1996.\nYemenia became an Airbus A310 operator in 1995 with two leased A310-200s; the introduction of the Airbus A310-300 followed in March 1997.\n\nAt March 2000 the chairmanship was held by Hassan Sohbi and the number of employees was 4,017. The aircraft operated at this time consisted of three Airbus A310-300s, two Antonov An-26s, five Boeing 727-200 Advanced, one Boeing 737-200 Advanced, one Boeing 737-200C, four Dash 7s, two DHC-6 300s and two Lockheed C130H Hercules. The list of domestic destinations served at this time were Aden, Al Ghaydah, Ataq, Hodeidah, Riyan Mukalla, Sanaa, Seiyun, Socotra and Taiz, whereas Abu Dhabi, Addis Ababa, Amman, Asmara, Bahrain, Beirut, Cairo, Damascus, Dar es Salaam, Djibouti, Doha, Dubai, Frankfurt, Jeddah, Johannesburg, Karachi, Khartoum, London, Moroni, Mumbai, Nairobi, Paris, Riyadh, Rome and Sharjah comprised the international network. On lease from International Lease Finance Corporation (ILFC), the first Boeing 737-800 joined the fleet in May 2002. The first Airbus A330-200 entered the fleet in 2004 on lease from ILFC.\n\nSince 2008, a number of safety actions by the European Union have been taken against Yemenia because of alleged poor maintenance standards in Yemen. In July 2009, France suspended the airworthiness certificates of two Yemenia Airbus A310 aircraft that were registered in the country. European services to Frankfurt were relaunched in December 2009. Since then, systematic inspections of Yemenia aircraft parked at EU airports are carried out, in order to assess and verify the safety standards. On 20 January 2010, then British Prime Minister Gordon Brown announced that, owing to concerns of terrorist activity in Yemen, flights between the UK and the country would be suspended, as long as the security situation would not improve.\n\nIn March 2015, Yemenia was forced to suspend all flight operations until further notice due both to a military conflict that had Sanaʽa International Airport as a target of air raids and to restrictions over the Yemeni airspace. In August 2015, Yemenia reinstated flights to Aden International Airport, with the first flight originating from Saudi Arabia. The blockade was reinstated on 21 February 2016, and lifted on 14 November 2017, when the first commercial flight touched down at Aden International Airport. Flights were cancelled once again, this time for less than a week, resuming on 1 February 2018.\n\nAccording to \"The National\" newspaper in November 2018, Yemenia announced that they would be seeking to resume flights from Aden International Airport to Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Muscat and Salalah in the Persian Gulf and Asmara, Moroni, and Djibouti in Africa, as well as leasing more aircraft. However, there has not been any addition to the destinations of Yemenia airlines (Cairo, Amman, Jeddah, Khartum and Mumbai).\n\nThe head office is located in the Hassaba District, in Downtown Sanaʽa, however the building was destroyed by fire during fighting in May 2011. On 3 June the same year, during the 2011 Yemeni revolution, the building was again set on fire.\n\nAs of 2019, Yemenia operates scheduled flights to 29 destinations. The network is enlarged by codeshare flights operated by Felix Airways.\n\n, Yemenia has an all-Airbus fleet that consists of the following aircraft:\n\nIn 2008, during the Dubai Air Show, the carrier signed a contract for the purchase of ten Airbus A350-800s. The order was subsequently altered to include the larger -900 version. In , Yemenia signed a memorandum of understanding with Airbus for USD 700 million that covered ten Airbus A320s; the order was firmed up in . The first Airbus A320 joined the fleet in . The A320 order was later restructured and four of them were converted to the A320neo.\n\nOver the years, the airline has operated the following aircraft types:\n\nThe company's worst accident occurred on 30 June 2009, when Yemenia Flight 626 from Sana'a to Moroni, Comoros crashed into the sea shortly before landing. Of the 142 passengers and eleven crew that had been on the Airbus A310-300 with the registration 7O-ADJ, only a young girl survived the accident.\n\nThere were a number of further incidents and accidents:\n\n"}

Released in June 2005, it is also their bestselling. It features a dedication to Lowell's own \"Irish\" Micky Ward who is featured on the album's cover and is the subject of the album's title track. It is also their final record with Hellcat Records before moving to their own vanity label, Born & Bred Records.\n\nThe album features one of the band's biggest and most well known singles, \"I'm Shipping Up to Boston\", which the band originally released on the \"Fields of Athenry\" single, although it re-recorded it for \"The Warrior's Code\". The band released the song on their own as a single in 2006. However, it became a hit after being featured in the Oscar-winning movie \"The Departed\" and its soundtrack.\n\nThe band filmed music videos for \"Sunshine Highway\", \"The Warrior's Code\" and two videos for \"I'm Shipping Up to Boston\", the second was used for \"The Departed\". A video for the track \"Tessie\" was also filmed in 2004 when the song was released as its own single.\n\n\"The Warrior's Code\" was the first Dropkick Murphys studio album to feature Tim Brennan and Scruffy Wallace.\n\n\"Your Spirit's Alive\" was written in memory of the band's friend Greg \"Chickenman\" Riley, who died in a motorcycle accident in 2004. It also references former Boston Bruins player Garnet Bailey and Massachusetts-born hockey player Mark Bavis, who both died during the September 11 attacks.\n\n\"The Warrior's Code\" is about Lowell, Massachusetts boxing legend Micky Ward, who is also shown on the album's cover. The song would later be used in the 2010 film \"The Fighter\", a biopic about Ward.\n\n\"Captain Kelly's Kitchen\" is another of the band's traditional arrangements.\n\n\"Sunshine Highway\" was the first single from this album and has been featured on Royal Caribbean's Sports' Deck, even though the song is about drug rehabilitation.\n\n\"The Green Fields of France\" is a cover of the anti-war ballad by Eric Bogle.\n\nThe lyrics to \"I'm Shipping Up to Boston\" come from unpublished Woody Guthrie lyrics, consisting of a short rant by a sailor looking for a wooden leg in Boston. It is the band's second adaptation of a Woody Guthrie song, the first being \"Gonna Be a Blackout Tonight\" on their previous studio album, \"Blackout\".\n\n\"Wicked Sensitive Crew\" was written in response to accusations that the band's music and image promoted violence. The song includes the lyric \"I ain't ashamed I cried when Mickey died in \"Rocky II\"\", although Mickey actually died of a heart attack after a confrontation with Clubber Lang in \"Rocky III\". The band actually address this in the album credits, stating that \"Mickey actually died in Rocky 3 but, hey, sue us, two rhymed better.\"\n\n\"Last Letter Home\" is the story of a correspondence between American Sgt. Andrew Farrar and his family before his death in the current Iraq War. With the Farrar family's permission, the band released the song as a single. All of the proceeds went to the family. The band also performed an acoustic version of the song \"Fields of Athenry\" at his funeral; the recording was included as the B-side for the single.\n\n\"Tessie\" is a reworking of a Boston Red Sox rally song. The song is listed as a bonus track, as it had been previously released on the \"Tessie\" EP in 2004, the same year the Red Sox won their first championship in 86 years.\n\nA second bonus track titled \"Hatebomb\" can be found on the Japanese release.\n\nThe album received mostly positive reviews from critics. Allmusic gave the album a rating of 3.5 out of five stars, praising the \"alternating lead vocals, a tag team of rage and bravado.\" PopMatters gave the album a mostly positive review and commented on the band's musical versatility: \"They can do straightforward punk rock (“Your Spirit’s Alive”) or straightforward Irish folk (“The Green Fields of France”). They can mix it up, and write a punk rock song that sounds like an Irish standard, (the title track, which features a healthy mix of bagpipes and mandolin).\" Punknews.org had similar praise for the album, stating: \"This is a dynamic record that frequently changes gears between faster punk and hardcore tracks and more subtle renditions of traditional material. While they've not departed from their established style, it seems that the Murphys' songwriting is in perfect sync with their ambition.\"\n\n\n\n\n"}

C. Beaton (Marion Chesney). The novels are published in the UK by Constable & Robinson and are set in the Scottish Highlands, in the fictitious town of Lochdubh.\n\nHamish Macbeth is the eldest of seven siblings and has three brothers and three sisters. His parents are crofters and as the eldest son, Hamish is expected to contribute to his family's income. He lives in Lochdubh's police station and keeps some sheep and chickens and grows some vegetables. He is occasionally guilty of poaching a salmon, sometimes for himself, but often as a gift or bribe for others.\n\nHamish has a reputation for laziness. He loves the town of Lochdubh (meaning 'black lake' (loch) in Gaelic and pronounced Lokh-DOO) and is content and at peace with his life and lacks ambition. Of great concern to Hamish and his fellow villagers is the threat of possible closure of Lochdubh's police station, something his superior and archenemy, Chief Inspector Blair, would like to see. Hamish avoids promotion, occasionally even deliberately destroying attempts to give him recognition for his accomplishments. His position as \"local bobby,\" sees him sometimes left out of official investigations and he must often work outside official channels, as the detectives from neighbouring Strathbane CID do not appreciate his help. Despite this, it is Hamish's natural \"Highland curiosity\" and local knowledge and intuition that combine to solve crimes.\n\nEarly in the series, Hamish has an on-again, off-again romance with Priscilla Halburton-Smythe, the daughter of a wealthy local landowner. The romance ultimately ends in a broken engagement because of her sexual coldness; thereafter, his luck with women, including Elspeth Grant, a reporter with whom he has a relationship, continues to be poor. Hamish is very attached to his pets, first his dog Towser, then in later books his dog Lugs (Scots for \"ears\") and a \"domesticated\" wildcat named Sonsie (Scots for \"cheeky\").\n\nHamish is tall and thin. He has hazel eyes and long eyelashes and fiery red hair.\n\nThe fictional village of Lochdubh is set in the real county of Sutherland. Although Lochdubh and the neighbouring town of Strathbane are fictional places, the series refers to real Scottish towns such as Dornoch, Dingwall and Inverness.\n\nIn an interview, the author recalls, \n\n\n\nThe Hamish Macbeth books were adapted into the BBC Scotland television series \"Hamish Macbeth\". Running for three series between 1995 and 1997, the titular police officer was played by Robert Carlyle. The first and second series comprised six episodes and the third had an additional two-part series finale to make eight episodes. The series bore little relation to the content of Beaton's novels. Macbeth and Lochdubh were retained, in name at least, but little else survived.\n\nThe author was not happy with the TV series. \"It wasn't like the books, I wrote about a six-foot laid-back highlander and I got a 5ft 8\" Glaswegian with a chip on his shoulder,\" Beaton says. \"It was an unfortunate experience.\"\n\nThe TV adaptations took several liberties with the plots, combining elements from several novels into each episode, changing the details enough to make them work together.\n\nWhile Beaton was not happy with the changes, the TV series developed a loyal fan base, and many viewers have since come to know the Hamish Macbeth that Beaton originally created. Her earlier novels are being reprinted and re-released to fill the gaps between new volumes.\n\nBeaton has often been left out of plans for her own creations. \"They wanted to do a making of Hamish Macbeth without even mentioning me at all,\" Beaton joked. \"However, it does lead to ideas to killing people.\"\n\nIn 2016, another Beaton creation, Agatha Raisin, became a TV series.\n"}
{"id": "2058436", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2058436", "title": "Battle of Veii", "text": "Battle of Veii\n\nThe Battle of Veii, also known as the Siege of Veii, was a battle involving ancient Rome, approximately dated at 396 BC. The main source about it is Livy's \"Ab Urbe Condita\".\n\nThe Battle of Veii was a battle between the Romans, who were led by Marcus Furius Camillus, who had been elected dictator, and the Etruscan city of Veii. Veii had engaged the Romans in a long and inconclusive war during which it was often under siege. In order to break the siege once and for all, a tunnel was constructed by the Romans beneath the city. While this occurred, Camillus attacked the city on all sides so as to distract the soldiers and residents of Veii from the tunnel construction by forcing their soldiers to defend the walls. The Romans then emerged from the entrance of the tunnel and their forces quickly overwhelmed Veii.\n\nThe Romans were led by Marcus Furius Camillus, elected \"dictator\" (in the Roman Republic, this was an emergency general rather than a tyrant) after Rome had suffered defeats. Their opponent, the Etruscan city of Veii, was a large city about 16 km (10 miles) from Rome. Veii had engaged the Romans in a long and inconclusive war during which it had often been under siege. One significant legend from this war was the Battle of the Cremera (see: Battle of the Cremera), which propelled the fame of the house of Fabia. In order to break the siege once and for all, a tunnel was reputedly built beneath the city of Rome.\n\nLivy describes the scene with the Veientines holed up in their city, the main Roman force encamped outside and a second force set to attack from within via the tunnel. After Camillus had taken the auspices, he had uttered the following prayer:\nPythian Apollo, guided and inspired by thy will I go forth to destroy the city of Veii, and a tenth part of its spoils I devote to thee. Thee too, Queen Juno, who now dwellest in Veii, I beseech, that thou wouldst follow us, after our victory, to the City which is ours and which will soon be thine, where a temple worthy of thy majesty will receive thee.\n\nRelying on the superior size of the Roman army, Camillus attacked the city on all sides. The intent of Camillus' attack was to distract the Veientines from the mine by forcing their soldiers to defend the walls.\n\nThe Veientines wondered \"what had happened to make the Romans, after never stirring from their lines for so many days, now run recklessly up to the walls as though struck with sudden frenzy\".\n\nAs the unsuspecting Veientines rushed to defend their walls from the suddenly frantic Roman army, the Romans entered the tunnel. At this time, the Romans emerged from the entrance of the tunnel inside the temple of Juno and the forces inside and out quickly overwhelmed Veii. After the fighting slackened, Camillus offered to spare the unarmed who began to surrender as the soldiers gathered loot.\n\nThe wealth so impressed Camillus that he gave a speech, during which he turned and stumbled, which was seen to be an omen of his later condemnation and the sack of Rome, the latter of which followed a few years later after the Battle of the Allia.\n\nThe male population of Veii was slaughtered and the women and children enslaved. The city was subsequently repopulated by Romans. This destruction of the Etruscan stronghold secured Rome's growing place in central Italy. \n\n"}

{"id": "2058453", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2058453", "title": "CharlieCard", "text": "CharlieCard\n\nThe CharlieCard is the payment method for the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA), and several regional public transport systems in the U.S. state of Massachusetts. It is a MIFARE-based contactless smart card on which the passenger loads fares, and was introduced on December 4, 2006. It replaces the metal token, that last of which was sold at Government Center station on December 6, 2006. The CharlieCard is named after a fictional character in the folk song \"M.T.A.\", often called \"Charlie on the MTA\", which concerns a man forever trapped on the Boston subway system – then known as the Metropolitan Transit Authority (MTA) – because he cannot pay the 5-cent surcharge required to leave the train. One day the traditional CharlieCard system will be replaced with AFC 2.0, a system similar to the London Oyster Card. The new system will allow payments with contactless cards and smartphones, as well as new CharlieCards.\n\nThe CharlieCard is named after the lead character in the 1948 protest folk music song, \"M.T.A.\". The song was written to protest a fare increase in the form of an extra five cent exit fare for longer rides and was later made popular by the Kingston Trio in 1959. One of the rejected names for the farecard system was \"The Fare Cod\", a pun on both the way locals might pronounce \"Card\" and the fish that was once integral to the Massachusetts economy, and also a reference to other transit cards named for ocean animals, such as London's Oyster and Hong Kong's Octopus. Another rejected name was T Go card with the T being the symbol for the MBTA.\n\nCharlieCards work on the MBTA's subway and bus services, most of which were converted in 2006. Token sales ended on December 6, 2006. The final fare-controlled station to be converted was Fields Corner station on December 22, 2006. They were originally expected to be usable on MBTA commuter rail and ferry boat services by December 2008, with testing on the Commuter Rail originally planned for summer 2008. However, testing had been pushed back to 2009, and full implementation had not been expected until 2011. By 2012, the MBTA had abandoned plans to accept CharlieCards on the commuter rail system. CharlieCards are not accepted on THE RIDE.\n\nCharlieCards are gradually being expanded to the other transit authorities in Massachusetts. CharlieCard acceptance has expanded to the MetroWest Regional Transit Authority (October 2010), Brockton Area Transit Authority (March 2011), Lowell Regional Transit Authority (November 2011), Merrimack Valley Regional Transit Authority (branded \"Tap and Ride Card\"; February 2012), Montachusett Regional Transit Authority (March 2012), Worcester Regional Transit Authority (April 2012), Cape Ann Transportation Authority, Cape Cod Regional Transit Authority (November 2012), Southeastern Regional Transit Authority (January 2013), and Berkshire Regional Transit Authority (January 2014).\n\nIn November 2017, the MBTA Fiscal and Management Control Board approved a $723 million contract that would replace the original CharlieCard and CharlieTicket with a new system (\"AFC 2.0\", for Automated Fare Collection) by 2021, that would allow fare gates to be compatible with contactless payment systems that have since been built into many credit cards and smartphones. To speed boarding, payment readers would be installed at all doors of Green Line trolleys and buses (to allow a proof-of-payment system) and cash-on-board payments would no longer be allowed, requiring customers to load cash onto cards at vending machines or retailers. It would also be extended to the Commuter Rail, where passengers would tap on and off. Public meetings on the new system were held in 2017 and 2018, but then stopped in 2019 until a revised plan was announced in December 2019. The new plan, costing over $900 million, would roll out more gradually from 2020 to 2024. It would lower CharlieTicket fares to match CharlieCard fares when the paper CharlieTickets start using contactless payments instead of magnetic stripe readers. CharlieCards would no longer be free, but would allow for one trip on a negative balance, and there would be 1,000 additional points of sale for fare media.\n\nThe CharlieCard can store value (keep a cash balance) and hold a combination of time-based passes which allow unlimited rides during a set period of time. Passengers use the plastic CharlieCard by tapping it against a target on a gate or a vehicle farebox. If left in a wallet, the card can usually be read when the wallet is placed on the reader. The gate or farebox then either automatically debits the cost of the passenger's ride, or verifies that the card has a valid transfer or that the card has a pass that is valid for travel at the given time and location. Transit riders can add value or a monthly pass to their cards at machines located at MBTA stations and vehicles, MBTA ticket offices, retail sales terminals at select outlets and online. Since the system operates offline, any purchases made online must be loaded to the card at a fare vending machine. \n\nThe original CharlieCards show no expiration date, but they did expire without warning five years after they were first activated. The first cards began expiring around November 2011. Newer CharlieCards have expiration dates printed on them and are valid for ten years, with the exception of Student CharlieCards which expire at the end of the school year they are issued. Users may tap their cards at a kiosk to find information on the expiration date; this information is not available online. Expiration of time-based passes that might be loaded onto a CharlieCard should not be confused with expiration of the CharlieCard itself; once a CharlieCard expires, it cannot be renewed and must be replaced. The purpose of expiration is to force users to replace CharlieCards on a periodic basis before they wear out and are no longer readable. To replace an expired CharlieCard, users must go to the Downtown Crossing pass sales office during weekday business hours, or mail the card to the MBTA. Time passes and stored value left on the expired card can be moved to the replacement card.\n\nToken collectors have been retrained as \"Customer Service Agents\" (CSAs) and assigned to guide MBTA customers in the stations. However, new insulated booths were constructed which allow the CSAs to monitor fare machine use and assist when necessary. Many riders had complaints about the customer service agents for being rude and unhelpful. The MBTA also plans \"Hub Stations\" within six existing subway stations. These glass-walled control rooms will house personnel monitoring various signal and alarm systems, including closed-circuit television. Personnel in the Hub Stations will be able to direct customer service agents to customers, and will interact with customers via call boxes located throughout the system. To support the added technology, the MBTA is connecting all subway stations in a fiber optic loop digital network, largely using its own right of way.\n\nThis planned change to \"Hub Stations\" never actually occurred and in March 2017 the MBTA announced they were planning on privatizing their customer service positions to increase efficiency. The MBTA went with a company called 'Block By Block\", and named the new CSA's as \"Transit Ambassadors\". To not confuse the new TA's with the original CSA's, Ambassadors wear bright red shirts with a giant T logo on the back with the words \"Questions? Ask Me\". In August 2017, the new Transit Ambassador program began rolling out at Massachusetts Avenue and Chinatown on the Orange Line. As of April 2020, Transit Ambassadors now cover 31 stations (13 on Orange, 11 on Red, 5 on Green, and 2 on Blue), with the remaining stations covered by a CSA. \nThe automated fare collection equipment is also compatible with the MBTA's CharlieTicket, a paper card with a magnetic stripe that operates as a stored-value card or time-period (monthly, weekly, or daily) pass. The MBTA first implemented the stored-value CharlieTicket on the Silver Line in February 2005. The ticket is inserted into a slot in the gate or farebox, the fare is deducted, and the remaining balance is displayed on a small screen. The ticket is then returned to the rider even if there is no remaining value.\n\nOn September 18, 2008, two 150-bike parking cages were made available at the Alewife station, next to the MBTA parking garage. Since then, a number of MBTA stations have been provided with secure, monitored bicycle parking cages. See Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority#Bicycles for details. Previously, access to these cages required a free special Bike CharlieCard. But as of the spring of 2013, any CharlieCard can be registered for bike cage access.\n\nCharlieCards can be reloaded, and CharlieTickets can be purchased and exchanged for new ones at Fare Vending Machines (FVMs) in transit stations, and elsewhere in the system including buses. All FVMs accept credit and debit cards; most also accept cash and coins. The AFC fareboxes on buses and light rail trains accept CharlieCards, Change Tickets, CharlieTickets, cash (up to $20 bills), and coins. When customers pay with cash on the bus, they may receive their change on a \"ChangeTicket\".\n\nThe MBTA gives a discount for CharlieCard users that began with the fare increase that took effect on January 1, 2007, and continuing with later increases. For example, a subway or trolley ride costs $2.40 with a CharlieCard but $2.65 with a CharlieTicket or cash. Local bus riders get a $0.50 discount with a CharlieCard ($1.60 vs $2.10),express bus riders pay an extra $1 or $1.50 depending on the route, and similar surcharges had been planned for commuter rail, and harbor ferries, but not THE RIDE. The MBTA also plans to continue providing the cards themselves free of charge, at pass offices, at stations throughout the system, at local retailers, and online.\n\nThere is also a senior citizen/disabled citizen Charlie pass, with reduced fares for qualifying individuals, called a \"Senior/TAP\" (Transportation Access Pass) CharlieCard. Middle school and high school students also can obtain a discounted CharlieCard.\n\nThe bulk of the MBTA's vehicles and stations were transitioned to the CharlieCard-compatible system throughout 2006, with Fields Corner the last to be converted on December 22, 2006.\n\nFare Vending Machines are available at all underground stations, as well as on the baggage-claim level of Logan International Airport terminals, inside Fenway Park, and at all stations on the Green Line \"D\" Branch. Proof-of-Payment Validation machines are installed at select stops on the other Green Line branches.\n\nThere are no plans to install Fare Vending Machines at Silver Line surface stops at the present time. Instead, the MBTA plans to install fare card sales terminals inside retail stores at other heavily trafficked locations in the system, including along busy bus routes and near selected Green Line and Silver Line stops, and in non-traditional locations such as Fenway Park. Fare vending machines were later installed at all airport stops before the Silver Line became free to board at the airport, removing the need for the Fare Vending Machines.\n\nThe Green Line is the most heavily traveled light rail line in the United States, with an average of 230,000 riders each weekday. Because of this heavy ridership, at selected stops on the Green Line the MBTA implemented a system known as Show-N-Go, which allows riders to flash their monthly passes and enter through the rear doors of a train, reducing congestion at the front door. This worked well when monthly passes were on paper tickets, as each month's pass differed visually from the previous month, but became an issue when the MBTA encouraged riders to store their monthly passes on their CharlieCards, as passes held this way cannot be verified visually.\n\nThe MBTA's solution was to turn the surface portion of the Green Line into a proof-of-payment system to increase the efficiency of boarding at peak times on surface Green Line stops. All doors on all trolleys open at some or all stations, depending on the branch. Passengers can pay their fare in several ways, depending on their payment method. Passengers paying with cash must enter through the front door and pay at the farebox, where they may receive a proof-of-payment receipt. Stored-value CharlieCard or CharlieTicket holders may also need to pay at the farebox.\n\nHowever, selected stops on all four of the Green Line branches contained ticket validators which allowed passengers to have money deducted from their CharlieCards or CharlieTickets before boarding, and provided them with a proof-of-payment. With this receipt in hand, passengers could enter through the rear doors of trolleys. In addition, MBTA inspectors with handheld validators were stationed at the busiest stops to deduct money from and verify monthly passes on CharlieCards, also allowing these riders to enter through any door. (Thirty of the handheld readers had been deployed, with an additional 20 coming by the end of January 2007, according to the MBTA.) Persons holding monthly passes could also just enter through any doors. All passengers, even those who entered through the rear doors, were still be required to go to the front of the train and make payment (or show their receipt) to trolley drivers. MBTA Transit Police conducted random checks to make sure riders had paid their fares.\n\nIn July 2012, the MBTA reverted to a \"front door only\" boarding policy on surface stations outside of peak hours to combat fare evasion. This policy also requires passengers getting off the streetcar to walk all the way to the front of the car to exit.\n\nThis later changed to an all door boarding during busy hours and a front door only during off-peak hours. \n\nSecurity flaws in the CharlieCard technology were studied and reported in a presentation by Henryk Plötz and Karsten Nohl at the Chaos Communication Congress in December 2007, which described a partial reverse-engineering of the algorithm used in the MIFARE Classic chip. The MIFARE Classic smartcard from NXP Semiconductors, owned by Philips, was reported as compromised in March 2008 by a group of researchers led by Karsten Nohl, a Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science, University of Virginia.\n\nIn addition, the security used on the mag-stripe CharlieTickets was broken by a team of MIT students. They were scheduled to give a talk about their findings at DEFCON 16 in August 2008, but were stopped after a federal lawsuit was filed against them by the MBTA, which resulted in a restraining order being issued. However, their presentation had already been published by DEFCON before the complaint was filed. On August 19, the court ruled the students could give their presentation.\n\nOther MIT students leveraged the technology behind Charlie Cards in 2013, with the development of Sesame Ring, a wearable ring embedded with an RFID tag that would save riders time in passing through MBTA station faregates. The students formed a company called Ring Theory and funded development of the product using a Kickstarter campaign. The Sesame Ring can be ordered online, or purchased in the MBTA Gift Store in Cambridge. The product was developed with full cooperation from the MBTA.\n\n\n\n"}

He completed his education at the University of Western Ontario and worked as an advertising executive.\n\nHe ran for the Ontario legislature in the 1977 provincial election, but lost to New Democratic Party candidate Mac Makarchuk in the riding of Brantford. In 1977 and 1978, Gillies worked as research assistant to Ontario Premier Bill Davis. He ran again in the 1981 election, and defeated Makarchuk by over 3,000 votes.\n\nGillies served as a backbench supporter of the Davis government, and endorsed Larry Grossman for the party leadership in January 1985; Grossman, however, would lose the leadership contest to Frank Miller. When Miller became the Premier of Ontario on February 8, 1985, he named Gillies as a minister without portfolio.\n\nThe Progressive Conservative Party was reduced to a tenuous minority government following the 1985 provincial election. Gillies himself was narrowly re-elected in Brantford, defeating NDP candidate Jack Tubman by 1,141 votes. He was promoted to Minister of Skills Development on May 17, 1985 but accomplished little before the Tories were defeated in a non-confidence motion in the house two months later.\n\nIn opposition, Gillies served as his party's critic for skills development, labour and the environment. Gillies took an interest in labour and human rights issues, and was one of the first PC MPPs to work for LGBT rights in Ontario. He was defeated in the 1987 provincial election, finishing third against Liberal candidate Dave Neumann.\n\nGillies ran communications and advertising for the Ontario Progressive Conservatives in the 1990 provincial election in support of new party leader Mike Harris.\n\nAfter leaving politics, Gillies became a vice-president of the public relations firm Hill & Knowlton. He later worked as a consultant for the Liquor Control Board of Ontario, the Royal Bank of Canada and other corporations and non-profit organizations, and came out as gay. He has served as a director of Orchestra London, the Brant Social Development Council, the Brantford Symphony Orchestra, and the Enos Foundation, the Public Affairs Association of Canada and serves on the advisory council of ProudPolitics. Gillies has also served on committees for Autism Speaks Canada and TVOntario.\n\nGillies has published columns in the Toronto Star, Toronto Sun and Hamilton Spectator.\n\nGillies worked on endangered species issues for the WildAid Conservation Society in 2011 and 2012. In 2013 and 2014, he provided consulting services to the Patey Law Group, Accident Resolution Group, Canadian Centre on Substance Abuse, the Carpenters Union, Clean Prosperity and Toronto Expo 2025.\n\nIn 2011, Gillies helped spearhead a national campaign to have shark fin banned in Canada. He led his hometown of Brantford to become the first municipality in North America to ban the trade and possession of shark fin through a by-law passed on May 24, 2011. This led to the introduction of similar legislation in Toronto, Oakville, Mississauga and other Canadian cities.\n\nGillies ran as the Progressive Conservative candidate in Brant in the 2014 election, but was not re-elected to the legislature.\nIn the summer of 2014, Gillies became Associate Director of Policy on the campaign of Toronto mayoralty candidate John Tory.\n\nIn January 2015, Toronto mayor John Tory named Gillies as secretary of the Mayor's Task Force on Toronto Community Housing, under the chairmanship of Senator Art Eggleton. In June 2016 Gillies joined Enterprise Canada Public Affairs as Municipal Practice Lead. At Enterprise, he has represented corporations including Enbridge Gas Distribution, Emovis Technologies, associations such as the Downtown-Yonge Business Improvement Area, and governments/public agencies including York Region, Peel Region, Halton Region, the City of Hamilton, City of Niagara Falls and Metrolinx.\n\nIn 2016 at the annual convention of the Ontario Progressive Conservative Party, Gillies was presented with a special achievement award by leader Patrick Brown for his decades of service to the party.\n\nIn 2018 Phil Gillies was appointed executive director of the Ontario Construction Consortium, a think tank supported by the unionized construction sector.\n"}

Gen. J.E.B. Stuart's cavalry. Stuart arrived at Gen. Robert E. Lee's headquarters between noon and 1 p.m., and about an hour later Brig. Gen. Wade Hampton's exhausted brigade arrived. Stuart ordered Hampton to take a position to cover the left rear of the Confederate battle lines. Hampton moved into position astride the Hunterstown Road four miles northeast of Gettysburg, blocking access for any Union forces that might try to swing around behind Lee's lines. Two brigades of Union cavalry from Brig. Gen. Judson Kilpatrick's division under Brig. Gens. George Armstrong Custer and Elon J. Farnsworth were probing for the end of the Confederate left flank later the afternoon of July 2.\n\nCuster's men collided with Hampton on the road between Hunterstown and Gettysburg. As he led a charge of Company A, 6th Michigan Cavalry, against the Confederate rear guard, Custer fell under his wounded horse and was saved by his orderly, Norvell F. Churchill. Hampton wanted to escalate the action, positioning most of his brigade along a ridge in readiness to charge Custer's position. At that stage, Elon Farnsworth arrived with his brigade. Hampton did not press his attack, and an artillery duel ensued until dark when Hampton withdrew towards Gettysburg.\n\nThe battlefield (colloq. \"North Cavalry Field\", which is northeast of the Gettysburg Battlefield) is privately owned and includes a power plant. The village of Hunterstown has a small plaque commemorating the nearby engagement, and on July 2, 2008, a marble monument honoring Custer was unveiled and dedicated.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2058504", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2058504", "title": "Cranium Command", "text": "Cranium Command\n\nCranium Command was an attraction at the Wonders of Life pavilion at Walt Disney World Resort's Epcot theme park. The show was a humorous presentation on the importance of the human brain.\n\nThe show's script was written by Jenny Tripp, a staff writer in Disney Feature Animation, and directed by Jerry Rees, who in addition to many other Disney film-based attractions, directed \"The Brave Little Toaster\". The pre-show itself was the first directing effort of Gary Trousdale and Kirk Wise, famous for later directing \"Beauty and the Beast\" and \"The Hunchback of Notre Dame\".\n\nIt premiered on October 19, 1989; as of January 4, 2004 it began to operate seasonally, closing permanently on January 1, 2007. During the 2007 International Food & Wine Festival, the entrance was used as a wine presentation. The pavilion has continued to be used for various Epcot festival events.\n\n From the entrance at the back of the pavilion, guests walked into a very basic, sparsely themed holding room with a digital counter reading the time until the next show. On the walls hung propaganda posters encouraging guests to enlist in the \"Cranium Command\" (similar signage could be seen advertising the show around the Wonders of Life pavilion). Also there was signage including brain teasers and humorous gags and puns, setting the stage for both the concept and tone. Guests were then led into a narrow, tall room with brightly colored carpeted walls. Facing the guests was a plain movie screen, and closed automatic doors to their left.\n\nThe movie screen would soon illuminate showing an animated segment featuring the boisterous and loud General Knowledge (voiced by Corey Burton) briefing his \"Cranium Commando\" troops on their mission: to pilot human brains and keep the people they're in out of trouble. A bumbling little soldier named Buzzy (Scott Curtis) had been given one of the most difficult missions of all: piloting a twelve-year-old boy.\n\nWhen General Knowledge spoke in the pre-show and was explaining that they were different kinds of brains, he showed a picture of Albert Einstein, as the example of a person who used his brain and Ernest P. Worrell (a popular fictional character played by Jim Varney, who was appearing in series of feature films produced by Disney at the time), as an example of the opposite. At the end of the preshow, General Knowledge asked the guests, \"\"Hey, you Goldbricks! This ain't no Spectator Sport! Where do you think you are, Disney World?!\" Get your strollers in line and hustle!\", pointing towards the theater as the automatic doors swung open.\n\nThe main show was presented in a 200-seat, dimly-lit theater designed to represent the inside of a human head; the outside world seen on video displays where the eyes would be. Buzzy was now presented as an Audio-Animatronic on an articulated seat so that he could move around during the performance. Helping him pilot the twelve-year-old named Bobby (also acted by Scott Curtis), via appearances on other video screens, were the logical Left Brain (Charles Grodin), the wacky Right Brain (Jon Lovitz), the hungry Stomach (George Wendt), the panicky Bladder who is also referred to as \"Elimination\" (Jeff Doucette, in an uncredited role), the Adrenal Gland (Bobcat Goldthwait) who was prone to overreacting, and the heart's Right and Left Ventricles (Dana Carvey and Kevin Nealon, reprising their Hans and Franz roles from Saturday Night Live). The monotone Hypothalamus (voiced by Kirk Wise), which regulated autonomic bodily functions, was represented via Audio-Animatronics as a robot.\n\nThe show took Buzzy's host through a typical day: getting up, skipping breakfast, running to school after missing the bus, meeting and falling for a cute new girl (Annie, played by Natalie Gregory), protecting her from bullies, getting involved in a food fight at lunch, getting sent to the principal (Kenneth Kimmins), and being thanked by the girl, then kissed after asking her out. At each point in the day, the various organs of the body talked to Buzzy, explained the problems they were facing, and in many cases argued over how Buzzy should deal with the situation. In the end, Buzzy (via help of General Knowledge's advice) eventually learned how to effectively balance the needs of his body crew in order to combat potential stressful situations.\n\nThe attraction was the only fully surviving element from the original 1978 plans for EPCOT Center's \"Life and Health\" pavilion. Titled \"The Head Trip\", it was to share a theatre space with a dentistry-themed show called \"Tooth Follies\". Designed by legendary Imagineer Rolly Crump, the stage and concept would be similar to the final incarnation, but with three animatronics dedicated to emotion, intellect and the nervous system. When Disney was unable to find a sponsor to host the pavilion, the construction of Life and Health was delayed indefinitely. However, an expansion pad between the Universe of Energy pavilion and the Horizons pavilion was kept as Disney still planned to build it.\n\nIn the mid-1980s, then Disney CEO Michael Eisner finally secured MetLife to sponsor the Life and Health pavilion, now renamed \"Wonders of Life\" and restarted development. Imagineer Steve Kirk replaced Crump on the project, and worked with Barry Braveman to flesh out the idea of \"The Head Trip\" into its own full attraction. Partially inspired by the 1943 Walt Disney-produced animated propaganda film Reason and Emotion, they explored the idea of transforming the concept into a parody of the Star Trek franchise. The human head was to be represented as a bridge on a spaceship much like the Starship Enterprise. Kirk explains: \"...there was one character with a supporting cast on film for different parts of the body. Originally there was a captain, a Mr. Spock type, several ensigns at each of the senses, there was an officer for reason, there was an officer for emotion... so there was a little cast of these little characters about, maybe, 2 feet tall in this pretty big theatre that was a pretty involved bridge of a ship, which was, again, inside the human head.\" Eventually, the budget was reduced to only be able to include one audio-animatronic figure and a robot, eventually becoming the Hypothalamus. Kirk hoped that the show would have been reprogrammed over the years to include different versions of the show in order to discuss a variety of health-related topics, but that idea never came to be.\n\nWith the budget reduction also came a new take on the concept along with its final name. Now titled \"Cranium Command\", the show featured a military theme wherein \"brain pilots\" take control of a mechanized human head. The main audio-animatronic character was dubbed \"Captain Cortex\" and ran the body, now that of a young boy, much like one would a military craft. He reports under his commanding officer \"General Knowledge\", who lectured the audience during the pre-show and then to Cortex in the main show. With time and resources running low, Imagineering outsourced production of the animated and live-action film portions to Colossal Pictures, who had previously worked with them on the 3D show \"Magic Journeys\". However, halfway into production Disney executives killed this version of the project to have it retooled by their own Feature Animation department. Animator Steve Moore, who worked on both versions, recalled, \"They were doing more of a Fred Crippen, Roger Ramjet style, which was fun, but not winning points with the clients. Storytelling was Colossal's Achilles heel ...they took the story given to them by Imagineering and followed it, thinking they were giving their client what they wanted. Unfortunately, it was written like an educational film from the '40s - very dry and condescending. No amount of style could make up for the lack of substance. And even though Colossal was executing Imagineering's story, their inability to interpret the story into something workable sunk them.\"\n\nIn May 1989, director Jerry Rees was approached by Peter Schneider, (at the time) president of Walt Disney Feature Animation, to speak with several Disney brass members including Eisner, Jeffrey Katzenberg, Marty Sklar and Tom Fitzgerald. They all unanimously loathed Colossal Pictures' take on \"Cranium Command\" and sought him out to fix it. After a brief review, Rees cited the various issues and recommended that the project be rewritten from scratch. The executives gave Rees full creative freedom aside from needing to keep General Knowledge and the overall stress-management theme, per the sponsor's request. Unfortunately they only had five months to complete the project, as they had to reach the October deadline. \n\nRees rounded up as many animators from Feature Animation as he could, including Gary Trousdale, Kirk Wise and Tom Sito. The latter three along with Rees crafted an entirely new storyline in under a week with Jenny Tripp penning the script. One of the largest changes was the personality of General Knowledge, now based on R. Lee Ermey's character from \"Full Metal Jacket\". Per Wise, \"We thought it would be funny if the character who was supposed to teach you how to manage your stress screamed at you incessantly like a psychotic drill sergeant.\" They also changed the pilot's name from Captain Cortex to Buzzy, a bumbling young recruit. Rob Minkoff was slated to direct the animated preshow as Rees needed to focus on the live-action heavy main show, but dropped out to take over the Roger Rabbit short \"Roller Coaster Rabbit\". Schneider desperately asked the unproven Trousdale and Wise duo to step in as directors. Wise claims, \"Saying \"yes\" turned out to be the smartest thing Gary and I ever did.\" In addition, the pre-show of \"Cranium Command\" was the very last project at Disney Feature Animation to be traditionally inked and painted on cels.\n\nWhile work on the animation commenced at the newly built animation wing at Disney-MGM Studios, Rees flew to Los Angeles to begin filming the live-action main show elements. Eventually he would end up directing nearly all of the show elements, per him: “Everything that you see and hear from the 8 screens, 2 Audio-Animatronic figures, and the 10 discreet channels of sound.\" The complexity of creating the seemingly uncut point-of-view shots which had to interact with several other pieces of media was a \"wild\" task for the ambitious director. Without optical or digital assistance, he used camera tricks and matching blur frames to stitch together the POV footage to seem like one continuous shot. In addition, Rees took the cinematographer and camera operators to the filming locations prior to shooting. When there, they would do tests to figure out how to make the camera express behavior and emotion such as shyness, love, anger, fear, panic and worry. This was essential to the intended immersion that you were inside a boy's head, looking out his eyes as he experienced life and reacted to it.\n\nAfter the POV filming was complete, Rees took to a soundstage to film the live-action scenes involving the \"body crew\". Wanting to turn audience members' expectations on their ears, he cast various famous comedians of the time to play the roles in zany sets. The project's complexities continued to dominate, as Rees had to put one eye on the filming and one eye on a monitor playing the POV video in order to cue up the footage accordingly. Finally, he reached post-production by first mocking the eight screens of the theatre in Los Angeles and editing all the various film items together along with the animatronic dialogue, which bewildered executives such as Katzenberg when reviewing the production.\n\nOnce editing was complete, Rees came back to Orlando and spent the remaining time with Imagineering in the finished theatre putting all the pieces together. While Rees himself articulated the audio-animatronic of Buzzy, animator Rebecca Rees (Jerry's wife) took control of the live-animation of the droning Hypothalamus robot, as she was the one who came up with the idea behind the character. In an uncredited role, Kirk Wise voiced the Hypothalamus. For the animation of the Buzzy animatronic, Rees used the concept of the articulated arm the character sits on to create the illusion of centrifugal force. For example, when the boy's head turned right (simulated through the POV eye footage), Buzzy's platform and chair would swing to the left. This was yet another device to immerse the audience into the experience to feel like they were riding inside a human head even though the bench seating in the theatre did not move.<ref name=\"Keith Gluck /\">The Disney Project podcast episode 8 \"Welcome to Jerry Rees Month\" http://www.thedisneyproject.com/2013/06/the-disney-project-podcast-episode-8.html</ref>\nComposer David Newman, who had previously worked with Rees on \"The Brave Little Toaster\" and \"Back to Neverland\" (a short about animation at Disney-MGM Studios starring Walter Cronkite and Robin Williams) wrote the show's music score. The pre-show's score evokes the tone of military marching music, but becomes more orchestral in the main show. Unlike most music created for theme park attractions, there are multiple leitmotifs more in common with a fuller film score. In an interview, Newman briefly cited that it was a lot of fun, much like his other projects with Rees.\n\n\"Cranium Command\"'s opening was largely overshadowed by its sister attraction in Wonders of Life, the flight simulator thrill ride Body Wars. (Epcot's first) It also happened to have a poor location, tucked away in the back obscured by many other exhibits. Still, the attraction was regarded then and for almost the entire pavilion's lifespan as its \"hidden gem\" for its wit, charm, self-aware humor and fast-paced nature. The \"Unofficial Guide to Walt Disney World\" book series even termed the attraction as \"Epcot's hidden gem\", stating \"Epcot and Walt Disney World could use a lot more of this type of humor.\" It remains beloved by many Disney fans a decade after its closure. Jerry Rees even stated that out of the record-setting 13 theme park attractions he helmed for Disney, Cranium Command was at the top of the list of the ones he most loved working on, so much so that for years afterward he unsuccessfully tried to get a feature film made shot entirely from a man's point-of-view.\n\nA \"Cranium Command\" trading pin featuring Buzzy was released in 2012 in tribute of Epcot's 30th anniversary and a Vinylmation twin pack featuring Buzzy and General Knowledge was released in 2014.\n\nThe attraction never changed over the course of its 17-year lifespan, aside from the entrance marquee. Upon opening, the entrance advertised the famous live-action comedians featured in the show but did not stick out much. In the mid-90s, it was remodeled to a much more theatrical appearance, focusing more on the militaristic and animated portions of the show, proudly featuring General Knowledge and Buzzy.\n\nThe show has a number of ties to important Disney history as well. At the grand opening, Jeffrey Katzenberg was so impressed by the pre-show that he claimed it was almost more entertaining than the main show itself. When he got back to Glendale, he found himself needing to assign a new director to \"Beauty and the Beast\" after firing Richard Purdum from the project due to creative differences. Immediately he thought of Gary Trousdale and Kirk Wise, who were major players on turning the troubled \"Cranium Command\" project around in record time, and giving it a great sense of humor which \"Beast\" desperately needed at the moment. Katzenberg quickly hired the duo who in turn ended up making \"Beauty and the Beast\" one of the most critically acclaimed animated films of all-time, and one of Disney's largest hits.\n\nAnother connection was that Pete Docter wound up as an animator on the project (one of his first jobs), who would later become a director at Pixar. Coincidentally, Docter's third feature \"Inside Out\" had a very similar premise (exploring the mind of an 11-year-old girl) and he admitted the attraction played a part inspiring its development.\n\nThe Disney short \"Inner Workings\", which debuted with Walt Disney Animation Studios' \"Moana\" also shares similar themes. Directed by Leo Matsuda, the short \"is the story of the internal struggle between a man’s Brain—a pragmatic protector who calculates his every move, and his Heart—a free-spirited adventurer who wants to let loose.\" \"Cranium Command\", along with the World War II propaganda short \"Reason and Emotion\" is cited as one of the main inspirations for the short.\n\nAfter shutting down in 2007, the attraction was left intact but closed to public access. In 2017, Matt Sonswa, an urban explorer, posted an exploration video on YouTube of the show building showing the pre-show, theater, and animatronics to be in good condition. A number of animatronic elements including Buzzy were marked by the Walt Disney archives for preservation. Cranium Command subsequently became an increasingly popular destination for urban explorers.\n\nOn February 21, 2019, Disney announced that the Wonders of Life pavilion, including the Cranium Command show building, will be repurposed as a new pavilion entitled Play!. What will happen to the show itself is currently unknown.\n\nIn December 2018 it was reported that the Buzzy animatronic had been stolen. The theft generated a considerable amount of reactions and speculation.\n\nIn January 2019, Disney urban explorer Dave Ensign claimed on the Cinemoddities podcast that he had contacted Disney insiders and discovered that Buzzy had never been stolen although his hat and coat were. Allegedly, urban explorers were frequently taking selfies with Buzzy who was mounted dangerously high above a mechanical pit in the stage. Ensign explained that facility operations had \"stolen\" the figure: \"They had an order to remove him so people wouldn't hurt themselves by sneaking in there and climbing on the sets. Unfortunately, nobody told operations or security who found it missing and assumed he'd been stolen.\" Disney made no official comment on the matter.\n\nIn May 2019, the Orlando Sentinel reported that the Buzzy animatronic was still missing from the closed attraction.\n\nIn September 2019, two men, former Disney employee Patrick Spikes and his cousin Blaytin Taunton, were arrested in connection to the theft of the Buzzy animatronic character's belongings and selling them on the black market. In February 2020, after both men made a plea deal of no contest regarding the theft and sale of the belongings and those of Haunted Mansion props, Spikes was sentenced to ten years probation and 250 hours of community service, while Taunton was sentenced to five years probation and 125 hours of community service. Both men were also ordered to pay over $25,000 in restitution and are no longer permitted to set foot on Disney property.\n\n\n\n"}

His reputation, however, was severely tarnished after his death when he was implicated in the plot to kill Sir Thomas Overbury. Astrologers continued to revere him, while writers from Ben Jonson to Nathaniel Hawthorne came to characterize him as either a fool or an evil magician in league with the Devil.\n\nForman was born in Quidhampton, Fugglestone St Peter, near Salisbury, Wiltshire, on 31 December 1552. At the age of nine he went to a free school in the Salisbury area but was forced to leave after two years following the death of his father on 31 December 1563. For the next ten years of his life he was apprenticed to Matthew Commin, a local merchant. Commin traded in cloth, salt and herbal medicines, and it was during his time as a young apprentice that Forman started to learn about herbal remedies. After arguments with Mrs Commin, Simon found his apprenticeship terminated, and he eventually went to study at Oxford as a poor scholar. He then spent a year and a half at Magdalen College, Oxford, where he may have become interested in medicine and astrology.\n\nThrough the 1570s and 1580s Forman worked as a teacher while studying the occult arts. In the early 1590s he moved to London starting up a practice as a physician in Philpot Lane. Having survived an outbreak of the plague in 1592 his medical reputation began to spread. In 1597 a Buckinghamshire clergyman named Richard Napier (1559 – 1634) became his protégé. In the 1590s Forman began to develop a more serious interest in the occult eventually setting up a thriving practice as an astrologer physician, documented in his detailed casebooks of his clients' questions about illness, pregnancy, stolen goods, career opportunities and marriage prospects. His success and his methods attracted the attention of the College of Physicians (now the Royal College of Physicians) who attempted to ban him from medical practice. He eventually obtained a license to practice from the University of Cambridge in 1603.\n\nWith a notable sexual appetite, Forman pursued numerous women. He wrote of his conquests in his diaries, showing as little regard for the background of his inamoratas as for the location of consummation. Many of his clients provided brief affairs. He wrote of having his first sex with his \"beloved\" on 15/12/1593, 5:00 PM, London.\" Then writing after \"She died 13/6/1597.\" On 22 July 1599, Forman wed seventeen-year-old Jane Baker. Having never been content with just one woman, the marriage sadly, “did not make much difference to (his) way of life, except that he had an inexperienced girl now as mistress of the house; he continued to be master.” In 1611, he accurately predicted his own death on the River Thames. Another astrologer, William Lilly, reports that one warm Sunday afternoon in September of that year, Forman told his wife that he would die the following Thursday night (12 September). And, sure enough:\n\nMonday came, all was well. Tuesday came, he not sick. Wednesday came, and still he was well; with which his impertinent wife did much twit him in his teeth. Thursday came, and dinner was ended, he very well: he went down to the water-side, and took a pair of oars to go to some buildings he was in hand with in Puddle-dock. Being in the middle of the Thames, he presently fell down, only saying, 'An impost, an impost,' and so died. A most sad storm of wind immediately following.\n\nFive years after his death he was implicated in the murder of Thomas Overbury when two of his patients, Lady Frances Howard and Mrs Anne Turner, were found guilty of the crime. During the testimony of Howard's trial, lawyers hurled accusations at Forman, claiming that he had given Lady Essex the potion with which she plotted to kill Overbury. During the trial he was described by Sir Edward Coke, Lord Chief Justice of the King's Bench as the \"Devil Forman\"; the result being that his reputation was severely tarnished.\n\nForman's papers have proven to be a treasure trove of rare, odd, unusual data on one of the most studied periods of cultural history. They include autobiographies, guides to astrology, plague tracts, alchemical commonplace books and notes on biblical and historical subjects. They also contain his disputes with the College of Physicians and his largely unsuccessful magical experiments. At one time he possessed the copy of the \"Picatrix\" currently in the British Library. Forman left behind a large body of manuscripts dealing with his patients and with all the subjects that interested him, from astronomy and astrology to medicine, mathematics, and magic. His \"Casebooks\" are the most famous of these resources. They, like his diaries and autobiographies, contain extensive details of his life. His only printed work was a pamphlet advertising a bogus method for divining longitude while at sea.\n\nHis intimate knowledge of Shakespeare's circle makes him especially attractive to literary historians. Modern scholars—A. L. Rowse is one prominent example, and others have followed his lead—have exploited Forman's manuscripts for the manifold lights they throw on the less-exposed private lives of Elizabethan and Jacobean men and women. One of Forman's patients was the poet Emilia Lanier, Rowse's candidate to have been Shakespeare's Dark Lady; another patient was Mrs Mountjoy, Shakespeare's landlady. Sixty-four volumes of his manuscripts were collected by Elias Ashmole in the seventeenth century, and are now held in the Bodleian Library, Oxford. His records have been digitised by a team led by Professor Lauren Kassell of the University of Cambridge.\n\nAmong Forman's manuscripts is a section titled the \"Bocke of Plaies,\" which records Forman's descriptions of four plays he saw in 1610-11 and the morals he drew from them. The document is noteworthy for the listing of three Shakespearean performances: \"Macbeth\" at the Globe Theatre on 20 April 1610; \"The Winter's Tale\" at the Globe on 15 May 1611; and \"Cymbeline,\" date and theatre not specified. The fourth play described by Forman is a \"Richard II\" acted at the Globe on 30 April 1611; but from the description it is clearly not Shakespeare's \"Richard II\". The manuscript was first described by John Payne Collier in 1836, and in the 20th century it was suspected as one of his forgeries. Most modern scholars now accept the section as authentic, but some still suspect it could be a forgery.\n\nSimon Forman is the protagonist of the Elizabethan mystery series by Judith Cook, \"The Casebook of Dr Simon Forman—Elizabethan doctor and solver of mysteries\". The novels are based on the original casebook manuscripts, and contain a mix of historical and fictional characters.\n\nDr Moth, a role loosely based on Forman, is played by Antony Sher in the 1998 film \"Shakespeare in Love\".\n\nForman's life and work form the basis of the 2019 video game \"Astrologaster\".\n\n\n"}

He was recognized as one of the best defensive shortstops of the dead-ball era. He had more putouts, assists, and total chances than any other shortstop of the era, and his 1914 totals of 425 putouts and 969 chances are still American League records for shortstops (and the major league record for putouts). He also led the American League in assists by a shortstop on five occasions and holds the major league record with nine triple plays.\n\nAs a batter, Bush did not hit for a high batting average but was regularly among the major league leaders in drawing bases on balls, sacrifice hits, stolen bases, and runs scored.

His 337 sacrifice hits still ranks fifth in major league history, and his 1909 total of 52 sacrifice hits is the fourth highest in major league history. He ranked among the American League leaders in stolen bases ten times, and, during the decade from 1910 to 1919, the only players to score more runs than Bush were Ty Cobb, Eddie Collins, and Tris Speaker.\n\nBush also served as a manager in professional baseball for the Washington Senators (1923), Indianapolis Indians (1924–26, 1943–44), Pittsburgh Pirates (1927–29), Chicago White Sox (1930–31), Cincinnati Reds (1933), Minneapolis Millers (1932, 1934–38), and Louisville Colonels (1939). His 1927 Pittsburgh Pirates won the National League pennant and lost to the 1927 Yankees in the World Series. Bush was also a co-owner of the Louisville Colonels (1938–1940) and Indianapolis Indians (1941–52), president of the Indians (1941–52, 1956–69), and a scout for the Boston Red Sox (1953–55). He was given the title \"King of Baseball\" during Major League Baseball's 1963 winter meetings. He was known as \"Mr. Baseball\" in Indianapolis and was an inaugural inductee of the Indiana Baseball Hall of Fame.\n\nBush was born in 1887 in Indianapolis, Indiana. He was the son of Irish-American parents and raised on the east side of Indianapolis. His father died when Bush was a child, and at the time of the 1900 United States Census, Bush was living with his mother and two older siblings in Center Township, near or in Indianapolis.\n\nBush was one of the best defensive shortstops of the dead-ball era. He collected more putouts, assists, and total chances than any other shortstop of the era, and his 1914 total of 425 putouts is still the Major League record for shortstops. His 1914 total of 969 chances is also still the American League record. He also led the American League in assists by a shortstop on five occasions: 1909 (567), 1911 (556), 1912 (547), 1914 (544), and 1915 (504). Bush also holds the Major League record (shared with Bid McPhee) for most career triple plays with nine. Bush's triple plays came on May 4, 1910, April 24, 1911, May 20, 1911, September 9, 1911, April 6, 1912, August 23, 1917, August 14, 1919, May 18, 1921, and September 14, 1921.\n\nAs a batter, Bush ranked among the American League leaders in bases on balls 12 straight years, from 1909 through 1920, and led the league five times. His career high was 118 bases on balls in 1915. During the decade from 1910 to 1919, no Major League player had more bases on balls than Bush. At the time of his retirement in 1923, Bush had 1,158 walks, second best in Major League history trailing only Eddie Collins.\n\nBush also collected 337 sacrifice hits in his career, ranking him fifth on the all-time Major League leader list (behind Hall of Famers Eddie Collins and Willie Keeler). He led the league with 52 sacrifice hits in 1909 (fourth highest single season total in Major League history) and hit another 48 (seventh highest single season total in Major League history) in 1920.\n\nIn 1920, \"Baseball Magazine\" rated Bush among the top ten players in Major League Baseball over the past decade in the categories of \"waiters\" (1st with an average of 88.4 bases on balls per year), \"run-getters\" (4th with an average of 90 runs per year), and \"base-stealers\" (7th with an average of 30.4 stolen bases per year).\n\nBush was also one of the shortest players in the Major Leagues at five feet, six inches (1.7 meters) and weighed between 130 and 140 pounds. Bush once said, \"I used to tell 'em it ain't how big you are, it's how good you are. But whenever another team had an uncommonly small player, I'd slip up and compare heights. Always turned out he was an inch taller than me.\"\n\nBush's nickname, \"Donie\", was reportedly bestowed on him as a result of a comment by Detroit teammate Ed Killian in 1909. Bush explained, \"One day after I had struck out, I asked Eddie Killian what kind of ball I swung at and missed. Killian said it was a donie ball. I never learned what a donie ball was, but the Tigers started calling me Donie and the name just stuck.\"\n\nBush began his professional baseball career in 1905 playing for the Sault Ste. Marie Soo in the Copper Country Soo League. In 1906, he played portions of the season for the Zanesville Moguls in the Ohio–Pennsylvania League and the Saginaw Wa-was of the Southern Michigan League. In early August 1906, he was acquired by the Dayton Veterans of the Central League. He appeared in 58 games for Dayton, compiling a .158 batting average with 98 putouts and 156 assists.\n\nIn 1907, he played for the South Bend Greens in the Central League. He appeared in 127 games, compiling a .279 batting average with nine doubles and seven triples. \"Baseball Magazine\" noted that, while playing in South Bend, Bush earned \"the reputation of being the fastest, best all-around shortstop the Central League had ever seen.\"\n\nAt the end of the 1907 season, after a good showing in South Bend, Bush was drafted by the Chicago White Sox, Boston Red Sox and Detroit Tigers, and was awarded to the Tigers. He was sold by the Detroit team to play the 1908 season for the Indianapolis Browns of the American Association. He appeared in 153 games for Indianapolis and was the team's starting shortstop with 330 putouts, 472 assists, 54 errors, 856 total chances, and a .937 fielding percentage. As a batter, he had 28 stolen bases, 18 sacrifice hits, seven triples, and a .247 batting average. He helped Indianapolis win the American Association pennant for 1908, and at the end of the 1908 season, \"The Sporting Life\" wrote that Bush was \"generally credited with being the best ball player outside the big leagues during the season in the minors which has just closed.\n\nIn late August 1908, Bush, then known as \"Ownie\", was sold by the Indianapolis club to the Detroit Tigers. He joined the Tigers in mid-September after Detroit's starting shortstop, Charley O'Leary, had been injured. Bush replaced O'Leary at shortstop for the team's final 20 regular season games. Bush's performance in the final weeks of the season, during a tight pennant race, was credited with having \"thrust the panting Tigers first over the line.\" Because Bush had not been with the Tigers for more than 30 days, he was ineligible to play in the 1908 World Series. At the end of the 1908 season, \"Baseball Magazine\" wrote:\nThis diminutive and youthful shortstop came to the rescue of the Detroit club and made it possible for them to win the American League pennant. . . . He helped to win the American Association pennant for the Hoosiers by his wonderful all around work, and then came on to Detroit in time to save Jennings' team from defeat. He is about as fast as Cobb on the bases, a great fielding shortstop and a good batsman, a man who hits right or left handed with equal efficiency.\n\nIn January 1909, Bush signed a contract to return to the Tigers, and he became the Tigers' starting shortstop for the next 13 seasons. He compiled a .273 batting average and a .380 on-base percentage in 1909 and led the American League with 676 plate appearances, 88 bases on balls, and 52 sacrifice hits. His 52 sacrifice hits remains the fourth highest single season total in major league history, and his .380 on-base percentage was the third highest in the American League in 1909 behind teammate Ty Cobb and Eddie Collins. His 114 runs scored was second in the league behind only Cobb. Bush's 52 stolen bases also set an American League rookie record that stood for 83 years until Kenny Lofton stole 66 bases in 1992.\n\nBush also played in all seven games of the 1909 World Series against the Pittsburgh Pirates, becoming the surprise hitting star for Detroit. With Detroit stars Ty Cobb and Sam Crawford slumping in the World Series (batting .231 and .250 respectively), Bush hit .318 with an on-base percentage of .483. He also scored five runs, collected five bases on balls, was twice hit by a pitch, and compiled nine putouts, 18 assists, and three double plays (but also committed five errors).\n\nAfter a brief holdout in the spring of 1910, Bush re-signed with the Tigers in mid-March. During the 1910 and 1911 seasons, Bush led the American League in bases on balls for the second and third consecutive seasons. His total of 49 stolen bases ranked third in the American League in 1910, and his 126 runs scored in 1911 ranked second in the league. Defensively, Bush's 1910 fielding percentage of .940 led American League shortstops, and his 1910 defensive Wins Above Replacement (WAR) rating of 2.0 ranked third among all American League players, regardless of position. In 1911, he led the American League's shortstops with 372 putouts, 556 assists, and 75 errors. His range factor of 6.19 in 1911 was a career-high and the second best among American League shortstops. In the voting for the 1911 Chalmers Award (the predecessor of the American League Most Valuable Player award), Bush finished in 14th place, as teammate Ty Cobb won the award.\n\nIn 1912, Bush led the major leagues with 117 bases on balls. \"The Sporting Life\" noted: \"Bush is one of the hardest men in the game to pitch to. He is so small that a pitcher has to have absolute control to get the ball over for him, and it makes him a most valuable lead-off man for a team, because there is hardly a day that he does not reach the bases one or more times.\" During the 1912 season, Bush also led all American League players (regardless of position) with 547 assists, and his 6.00 range factor was the highest among American League shortstops. He also ranked among the American League leaders with a defensive WAR of 1.8 (4th among players at all positions), 107 runs scored (7th), 37 stolen bases (8th), 317 putouts at shortstop (4th), a .929 fielding percentage (2nd among shortstops), and 66 errors (2nd).\n\nIn 1913, Bush led the American League with 694 plate appearances and was again among the league leaders with 80 bases on balls (3rd), 44 stolen bases (6th), 98 runs (8th), 331 putouts at shortstop (2nd), and 510 assists at shortstop (2nd). \"Baseball Magazine\" praised Bush for his range: \"In the field Bush sometimes appears ragged, but this is not owing to lack of finish in handling stinging grounders. It is rather a direct result of his eagerness to spear everything within reach and just a little beyond. No chance is too hard for him to try, and more than most fielders can say he pulls down the drive and relays it to first.\" In its annual selection of an All-America Baseball Team, \"Baseball Magazine\" named Bush as the second best shortstop in the American League, calling him \"one of the cleverest fielders in the game\" and citing \"his unsurpassed ability to get on bases and his great speed and nice judgment in run-getting once he earns standing room on first.\"\n\nIn 1914, Bush led the American League with 721 plate appearances and 112 bases on balls while also scoring 97 runs and compiling 35 stolen bases and a .373 on-base percentage. In the voting for the 1914 Chalmers Award (the predecessor of the American League Most Valuable Player award), Bush finished in a tie with Home Run Baker for third place, trailing only Eddie Collins and Sam Crawford, and ahead of Shoeless Joe Jackson, Tris Speaker and Ty Cobb.\n\nIn 1915, Bush, along with Detroit's all-star outfield of Ty Cobb, Sam Crawford, and Bobby Veach, helped lead the Tigers to a 100-54 record and a second-place finish in the American League. Bush again led all American League players with 703 plate appearances and 504 assists and was again among the league leaders with 118 bases on balls (2nd), 99 runs (6th), 35 stolen bases (8th), 340 putouts at shortstop (2nd), 61 double plays turned at shortstop (2nd), 5.45 range factor at shortstop (2nd), and 57 errors (2nd).\n\nAt the end of the 1915 season, J. C. Kofoed in \"Baseball Magazine\" rated Bush as the best shortstop in the American League. Kofoed wrote that Bush had only five fewer chances than Rabbit Maranville and seven fewer errors, noted that Bush made \"spectacular plays\" in the field \"day after day\". Kofoed also dismissed those who relegated Bush to the \"poor hitting class\", noting that Bush got on base and scored more often than any of his Detroit teammates. \"The Sporting Life\" that same year noted that Bush \"is just about the most methodical and consistent person connected with our national game.\"\n\nIn appreciation of Bush's efforts during the 1915 season, Detroit fans raised funds to allow Bush to purchase a new Paige automobile. The \"Detroit Free Press\" wrote:\nThere never was a player who deserved a testimonial more than Donie deserves this one. The little infielder has been the mainstay of the Tigers' defense all season and has saved game after game by his sensational stunts. . . . Off the field he has never permitted his spirits to flag, declaring right up to the last minute that the Tigers were going to win the pennant. . . . Apart from baseball, Bush is a mighty fine fellow, good-natured, lively, generous, and the sort of man anyone would like to have for a friend.\n\nIn January 1916, \"The Sporting Life\" reported that \"Bush has been driving his new car most of the time since he left Detroit and is said to be only a few laps behind (Barney) Oldfleld as a speed merchant.\"\n\nIn 1916, Bush continued to rank among the American League leaders in multiple categories with 75 bases on balls (7th), 27 sacrifice hits (9th), 435 assists (5th among all players regardless of position), 278 putouts at shortstop (4th), and a .954 fielding percentage at shortstop (3rd). \"Baseball Magazine\", in choosing its All Star American League Team, chose Bush at the shortstop position. Writer F. C. Lane observed: \"But the best performer, taking everything into consideration, was Donie Bush of Detroit. Bush is simply unsurpassable as a fielding shortstop and while a weak hitter according to the records he is nevertheless a dangerous man on the offensive through his well-known ability to secure free passage to first base and his amazing swiftness of foot once he reaches that initial station on the homeward journey.\"\n\nIn 1917, Bush led the American League with 112 runs scored, stole 34 bases, and compiled a career-high batting average of .281 with a .370 on-base percentage. Bush also broke up a noteworthy no-hitter on July 11, 1917. With Boston Red Sox pitcher Babe Ruth having allowed no hits, Bush hit a scratch single in the eighth inning. After giving up the single to Bush, Ruth struck out the Tigers' Bobby Veach, Sam Crawford, and Ty Cobb in the ninth inning to secure a 1–0 complete game shutout. In a 1942 speech in Los Angeles‚ Ruth called this game his greatest thrill. At the end of the 1917 season, \"Baseball Magazine\" rated Bush as the second best shortstop in the American League behind Ray Chapman. Writer F. C. Lane called him \"one of the greatest ground coverers and all round fielders on any diamond.\"\n\nIn 1918, Bush's batting average dropped 47 points from the prior season to .234. Despite the drop in average, Bush continued to rank among the American League's leaders with 594 plate appearances (1st), 79 bases on balls (2nd), 280 putouts at shortstop (2nd), 74 runs scored (4th), and 48 errors (3rd). \"Baseball Magazine\" that same year published a feature story on how a player's hands make him suitable for one position or another. The author wrote: \"Donie Bush is a wonderful shortstop all will agree. Bush is a little man perhaps the shortest of stature in organized baseball. But his hand is very broad, thick and bony as well as freckled. It is a typical scoop hand.\"\n\nIn 1919, Bush continued to perform well defensively. His 290 assists at shortstop led the American League, and his .943 fielding percentage was third best among the league's shortstops. Offensively, he continued to rank among the league's leaders with 75 bases on balls (5th), 22 stolen bases (7th), and 82 runs scored (10th). That same year, Bush authored an article in \"Baseball Magazine\" titled, \"Inside Points on Playing Short.\" Bush argued that shortstop was the toughest position on the infield:\nYou hear a lot of third baseman raving about the hard chances they get, but any time the shortstop is looking for a berth that is nice and quiet and restful in comparison to his own he casts longing glances at third. Look up the records and see what becomes of the shortstops who get too old to cover all the ground between second base and the foul line. A lot of them camp on third for a while. And why shouldn't they? A man can play third when he can't play short. That's a cinch.\n\nIn 1920, Bush led the American League with 48 sacrifice hits—the seventh highest total in Major League history. Despite his advancing age, Bush retained considerable speed, stealing 15 bases and hitting 18 doubles and five triples. \"Baseball Magazine\" in June 1920 noted: \"Donie Bush is aging, yet gets around with tremendous agility.\"\n\nIn 1921, Ty Cobb took over from Hughie Jennings as manager of the Tigers. Bush became involved in repeated arguments with Cobb's \"first lieutenant\", Dan Howley. The \"Detroit Free Press\" wrote that Howley \"never is quite so contented\" as he is when arguing with Bush and added: \"Bush would fight at the drop of a hat for Dan, yet the midget never gets nearly so mad at anyone as he does when Howley, with deliberate intent, corners Donie somewhere and starts a debate. . . . Often Donie becomes so enraged that he pulls his cap off his head and throwing it off the door of the hotel lobby or in the turf of the ball field, stamps on it in his hysteria.\" For the first half of the season, Bush continued as the Tigers' starting shortstop. Halfway through the season, however, Cobb moved Bush from his regular shortstop position to second base.\n\nIn August 1921, Detroit owner Frank Navin placed Bush on waivers, ending his 13-year career with the Tigers. \"The Sporting News\" reported on Bush's departure from Detroit as follows:\nThe passing of Bush removes one of the spectacular figures of Detroit baseball history. . . . Built low to the ground and extremely aggressive, Bush presented a spectacle that appealed to the heart of the gallery. He always did things in a sensational manner. His style made the hard ones look harder and the easy chances look hard. . . . Of Bush's fielding the outstanding feature always was his throwing. In that, more than in anything else, Bush stood apart. He had an uncanny ability to judge the speed of a runner on his way to first. He never seemed to hurry a throw, and he seemed never to throw with speed. Most of the time he apparently lobbed the ball but he always got his man, sometimes by a fraction of a step -- but he got him. This ability of Bush's was always a matter of amazement to spectators and they could never solve the riddle of it.\n\nIn late August 1921, Bush was selected off waivers by the Washington Senators and became the team's starting shortstop for the final 33 games of the 1921 season. In January 1922, the Senators acquired shortstop Roger Peckinpaugh, relegating Bush to playing second and third base. Bush began the 1922 season on a hot streak at the plate. By mid-May, he was averaging a run every three at bats, a rate on par with Babe Ruth, leading \"The Sporting News\" to write that Bush was playing the best baseball of his life. Bush appeared in 41 games for the 1922 Senators and finished the season with a .342 on-base percentage and 21 bases on balls in 158 plate appearances.\n\nDespite having a line-up that included Baseball Hall of Famers Walter Johnson, Goose Goslin, Sam Rice, and Bucky Harris, the 1922 Senators finished the season with a 69-85 record and in sixth place in the American League. In December 1922, Washington owner Clark Griffith hired Bush to replace Clyde Milan as player-manager for the 1923 season. \"The Sporting News\" opined that Bush had the characteristics to make a solid manager: \"The same traits that made our friend Donie a great little ball player have been recognized when Clark Griffith appoints him manager. Brains, a good pair of hands, and a bulldog disposition made him a playing success against the handicap of being undersized and rather weak of arm. . . . He ought to make quite a manager; ought to put something into that Washington team that it lacked.\"\n\nOn August 2, 1923, Bush noticed early in a game that Hank Severeid and Wally Gerber of the St. Louis Browns had switched spots in the batting order and batted out of turn. In the second, fifth and seventh innings both players made outs, and Bush said nothing. In the ninth inning, Gerber hit a single with two out and a runner on first base. Bush appealed to the umpire that Gerber had batted out of order. Gerber was declared out to end the game.\n\nBush led the 1923 Senators to a fourth-place finish and a 75-78 record, two positions higher in the standings and seven fewer losses than the 1922 team. In October 1923, and despite the improved record, team owner Clark Griffith fired Bush as the team's manager. The shift drew criticism from the Washington press, and one newspaper even urged a boycott of the Senators over the firing of Bush. Griffith initially declined comment on his release of Bush, but as criticism intensified, Griffith said in a written statement that he found Bush \"incompetent as a manager, failing to maintain discipline among the players, utter disregard of the development or use of young players, favoritism and indifference when the ball game was over as to ways or means of improving conditions.\" The Senators went on to win the 1924 World Series under new manager Bucky Harris.\n\nAfter being released by the Senators, Bush returned to his hometown where he was hired as the manager of the Indianapolis Indians of the American Association. In July 1924, a \"Bush Day\" was held in Indianapolis with 10,000 fans showing up to honor Bush and present him with gifts. In his first year as manager of the Indians, Bush led the Indians to a second-place finish in the American Association, narrowly losing the pennant to St. Paul in the final series of the 1924 season. His team again finished in second place in 1925, losing the pennant to Louisville.\n\nIn 1926, Bush developed appendicitis during a road trip and returned to Indianapolis to undergo surgery. After a period of convalescence, Bush returned to his role as manager and led the Indians to their third consecutive second-place finish.\n\nIn October 1926, Bush was hired to replace Bill McKechnie as manager of the Pittsburgh Pirates. The Pirates were loaded with talent but had finished in third place in 1926. In Bush's first year in Pittsburgh, he led the 1927 Pirates to a National League pennant with a 94–60 record. The Pirates were then swept in the by the 1927 New York Yankees in the World Series. During the 1927 season, Bush had a feud with Pirates star Kiki Cuyler. Cuyler was unhappy about being switched from third to second in the batting order, and he allegedly slackened his effort for a few games. Bush reacted by benching Cuyler in August and not playing him again for the rest of the season, even keeping him out of the World Series. Bush ignored chants from Pirate fans, \"We want Cuyler! We want Cuyler\", in the games at Pittsburgh. After the season, the Pirates traded Cuyler to the Cubs.\n\nBush's Pirates finished in fourth place in 1928 and in second place in 1929. During the 1929 season, Bush complained to a Pittsburgh reporter about the new \"lively ball\", saying, \"It's not a ball‚ it's a bullet. Somebody's going to get killed if they don't watch out. A pitcher who has to put the ball over hasn't a chance. All he can do is to pitch and duck.\"\n\nAt the end of August 1929, Bush suddenly resigned as the Pirates' manager. At the time, \"The Sporting News\" noted that many of the Pittsburgh fans turned against Bush when he benched Cuyler in 1927 and that Bush had never been able to get the local fans behind him.\n\nOn September 30, 1929, Bush signed a two-year contract to serve as the manager of the Chicago White Sox starting with the 1930 season. He took over a team that had finished in seventh place with a 59-93 record in 1929. In 1930, the White Sox again finished in seventh place, improving only slightly to 64-90.\n\nBy July 1931, a public debate was under way as to whether Bush or team owner Charles Comiskey was to blame for the White Sox' poor showing. Many in the press blamed Comiskey for the shortage of talent at Bush's command. During a July road trip to the East, the White Sox had only \"five workable pitchers\", a term \"The Sporting News\" defined as \"those who could throw a ball.\" Bush complained about the lack of \"cooperation\" from Comiskey in acquiring players as his 1931 team compiled both the lowest batting average (.260) and the highest earned run average (5.04) in the American League and dropped to eighth place with a 56-97 record. Bush resigned at the end of the 1931 season.\n\nIn 1932, Bush managed the Minneapolis Millers in the American Association to a 100–68 record and a first-place finish.\n\nOn November 10, 1932, the Cincinnati Reds announced that they had two weeks earlier retained Bush as manager for the 1933 season. Upon his hiring, one newspaper reporter predicted: \"No bed of roses awaits the new manager here. . . . He falls heir to a run-down team, with little financial backing and a quick-to-criticize public.\" The 1933 Reds finished in last place with a 58-94 record, compiled the lowest batting average (.246) in the National League, and lacked a pitcher who was able to muster more than 10 wins.\n\nIn December 1933, Bush was hired as the manager of the Minneapolis Millers, the team he had coached in 1932. He remained with the Millers from 1934 to 1938 and won pennants in 1934 and 1935. Ted Williams played for the Millers in 1938, saw his batting average jump 75 points over the prior year, and later credited Bush with some of his success. After learning that Bush had died, Williams said: \"I've been in the game for 36 years and nobody has any closer affection to my heart than Ownie.\" He noted that Bush was as \"fiery as a man could be...a man who tried to be tough but was as soft as a grape.\"\n\nIn September 1938, Bush announced that he was resigning his position as manager of the Minneapolis Millers to become a co-owner, general manager and field manager of the Louisville Colonels of the American Association. Bush and two partners, Indiana banker Frank E. McKinney and Tom Yawkey (owner of the Boston Red Sox), purchased the club reportedly for $175,000 -- $100,000 for the plant (including a 14,500-seat park built in 1923 for $400,000) and $75,000 for the franchise and players.\n\nAfter taking over the Colonels, Bush lauded the team's shortstop, Pee Wee Reese, as \"the best-looking shortstop prospect he's seen in his 30-odd years in baseball.\" In July 1939, Bush and McKinney recouped much of their investment by trading Reese to the Brooklyn Dodgers for $35,000 and three players. Co-owner Yawkey reportedly objected to the trade, but Bush and McKinney held a majority interest in the club.\n\nAfter the 1940 season, Bush and McKinney sold their two-thirds interest to Yawkey. Bush was in a St. Louis hospital at the time and stated that he was selling his interest in the team due to poor health.\n\nBush remained a resident of Indianapolis throughout his life. He lived on the 200 block of North Walcott Street in east Indianapolis from at least 1910 through 1940.\n\nIn December 1941, after Bush recuperated from a lengthy illness, Bush and McKinney bought the Indianapolis Indians from Norman Perry. Bush, who became the team's president as well as a co-owner, said at the time, \"It always was my ambition, since I was a kid, to have a share in the ownership of the Indianapolis club.\"\n\nBush and McKinney hired Gabby Hartnett as the team's field manager for 1942. In November 1942, Bush announced that he would take over as field manager in 1943 while continuing as the club's president as well. Bush managed the team for the entire 1943 but was forced by ill health to give up his role as field manager in May 1944, hiring his long-time friend Mike Kelly to take over as the team's manager.\n\nOn July 20, 1951, Bush and McKinney sold majority control of the Indianapolis baseball club to the Cleveland Indians. On February 25, 1952, Bush was replaced as the club's president after holding the position for nearly 10 years. Bush continued to hold a minority interest in the club and remained with the club as an executive without title. \"The Sporting News\" noted that the reorganization marked the first time since Bush's playing days that he had been without an official title. In November 1952, Bush and McKinney sold their remaining 25% interest in the Indianapolis club to the Cleveland Indians.\n\nFor three years following his disassociation with the Indianapolis club, Bush worked as a scout for the Boston Red Sox. In January 1956, Bush and McKinney led a successful effort to transform the Indianapolis club into a community-owned team through a public stock offering. On January 30, 1956, Bush was named president and general manager of the club.\n\nOn February 1, 1969, Bush announced that he was resigning as the club's president after holding the position continuously since 1956. Bush, who was 81 years old, stated that he was quitting as the result of \"a front-office squabble\" with the club's chairman, Louis Hensley, and general manager, Max Schumacher.\n\nBush remained affiliated with professional baseball for 65 years. He was given the title \"King of Baseball\" during Major League Baseball's 1963 winter meetings. In 1967, the stadium in which the Indianapolis Indians played was renamed from Victory Field to Bush Stadium in his honor.\n\nIn 1972, at age 84, Bush was working as a scout for the Chicago White Sox.

Her music style could be described as pop. Most of her music is in Spanish, although a few tracks on some albums were recorded in English. Although her albums are not readily available in the U.S. record shelves as they are in Spain and Latin America, they can be found on the Internet. She has sold more than 1,000,000 records since 2002.\n\nChenoa was born in Mar del Plata, Argentina on June 25, 1975, although her family moved to Majorca, Spain, when she was eight. She grew up in a musical family; both parents were musicians who used to sing in hotels at live music shows. At the age of 16, Chenoa began to sing professionally, taking part in her parents' show. When her mother fell ill, Chenoa had to stand in for her. Her fathers family is of Italian descent and her maternal grandmother is Lebanese.\n\nShe graduated as a nursery school teacher and started performing in the Casino de Mallorca shows when she was 20. There, Chenoa acquired a good stage presence before entering the first edition of the Spanish television show Operación Triunfo (a talent-search contest for the Eurovision Song Contest) in 2001.\n\nHer first album was \"Chenoa\", released in April 2002 in Spain. The first single was \"Atrévete\", a song whose English version is also included in the album as \"Mystify\", but the greatest hit of this album was \"Cuando tú vas\", played all over Spain in the summer of 2002. \"Chenoa\" sold over 500,000 copies in Spain after 61 weeks in the Top 100 chart, and she was nominated for the Spanish music industry awards Premios Amigo as best new female artist and best female artist. Year 2002 finished with a Spanish tour that included more than 90 dates. In April 2003, Chenoa competed in and won Eurobest, a European song contest in which she performed \"It's Raining Men\".\n\nThe unplugged album \"Mis canciones favoritas\" was Chenoa's second album. It was recorded in Barcelona in April 2003, and included some of her favorite songs such as \"Man in The Mirror, Respect, Chain of Fools\", and \"Love of My Life\". This CD + DVD was released on a limited edition of 100,000 copies.\n\n\"Soy mujer\" was the title of her second studio album, recorded in Miami and Madrid in 2003. Pop, rock, Latin, Arab, and Anglo sounds are mixed in this album, which reached number one in the Spanish album chart and sold more than 250,000 copies after 47 weeks in the top 100. The album also charted in Venezuela reaching the number two position.\n\nThe singles released were \"En tu cruz me clavaste, Soy lo que me das, Siete pétalos, Dame\" (which topped the Spanish charts for three consecutive weeks in 2004), and \"Soy mujer\". Chenoa was nominated again for the Premios Amigo award as best female artist and completed an 80-date tour in Spain. In 2004, she was nominated for the \"Tu Música\" award as best new artist in Puerto Rico.\n\nIn May and June 2004, she started her \"Soy mujer\" promotional tour around Venezuela, Puerto Rico, and Argentina.

Venezuela has also awarded Chenoa in 2005 with the Mara de Oro 2005 for the best new international artist of the year.\n\nChenoa's third studio album \"Nada es igual\" was released in November. Produced by Dado Parisini (Laura Pausini, Nek, Tears for Fears), and recorded in Milan, this pop-rock album explored a new direction in Chenoa's music. \"Nada es igual\" was not only a sample of her musical evolution, but also of her new personal challenge. \"Rutinas\" was the first single, which again reached number one in the Spanish charts. The album sold more than 100,000 copies in Spain after 21 weeks in the top 100 and was also promoted in Mexico and other Latin-American countries. The following singles were \"Tengo para ti\" and \"Donde estés\". 2006 finished with a Spanish tour of more than 40 locations.\n\"Me enamoro del dolor\" was covered in English by Maria Arredondo and is called \"Even When You're With Me.\"\n\nOn October 9, 2007, Chenoa released her fifth studio album called \"Absurda Cenicienta\", for which she wrote all the songs herself. The first single was \"Todo irá bien\". The album peaked at number one in the iTunes Latin Albums and went to the number two position in the Spanish albums charts. It also received Gold certification in its first week in the Spanish album chart. The single \"Todo irá bien\" has topped the charts in Puerto Rico, Costa Rica, Spain, etc. and a total of 12 countries.\n\nOn July 25, 2009, Chenoa's new single \"Duele\" from her upcoming album, \"Desafiando la gravedad\", premiered for the first time on Cadena Dial. 'Desafiando la Gravedad finds her once again co-writing the bulk of her material, this time with producers Yoel Henríquez and Mauricio Gasca, and once again developing her style as a pop/rocker. The album opens with a trio of standout songs that signal the direction of the album. The opener, \"Buenas Noticias,\" is an upbeat song with acoustic guitar, a syncopated drum track, and bubbly touches of electronic effects. The chorus hits hard with Chenoa belting out the refrain as a dense Wall of Sound kicks in, electric guitar, backup vocals, and all. \"Nada de Nada\" is more intense, a surging electro-rock song powered by an overdriven electric guitar riff and muscular duet vocals by Mexican diva Gloria Trevi. These two songs are interspersed by \"Duele,\" a power ballad of heartbreak that showcases the vulnerable side of Chenoa. While these three standout songs get Desafiando la Gravedad off to an impressive start, there's plenty more to enjoy as the album progresses, changing tempo often over the course of its dozen tracks.'\n\nShe was selected to join Italian tenor Andrea Bocelli in his 2011 World Tour.\n\nOn November 2011 Chenoa released Como un fantasma (EP) produced by Nigel Walker. The first single was \"Como un fantasma\" and the second one \"Simplemente tú\".\n\nFrom September 2012 till 2013, Chenoa took part in the Spanish radio morning show Atrévete (Cadena Dial) on Tuesdays and Thursdays.\n\nOn September 17, 2013, Chenoa released her sixth studio album Otra dirección both in English and Spanish via Alias Music.

It came preceded by the lead single \"Quinta Dimensión\" and its English version \"Life's an Equation\", released in late-June. The song \"Júrame\" (English version: \"Humanized\") was released as the second single in late-January 2014.\n\nOn April 1, 2016, Chenoa released her seventh studio album #SoyHumana via Alias Music. Almost all of the lyrics are written by herself. The album was recorded in Majorca, Spain and entirely produced by Swedish producer Maria Marcus. It came preceded by the lead single \"Soy Humana\". Then two more single was taken from that album \"Tú y Yo\" and \"Entra en mi Realidad\". Chenoa toured during 2 years with this album with almost 40 gigs.\n\n\n\n"}

It is a wading bird native to Australia and commonly found on its coastline. The similar South Island pied oystercatcher (\"H. finschi\") occurs in New Zealand.\n\nThe name \"oystercatcher\" is something of a misnomer for this species, because they seldom eat oysters, which are found mainly on rocky coastlines. Pied oystercatchers frequent sandy coastlines, where they feed mainly on bivalve molluscs, which are prised apart with their specially adapted bill.\n\nThis Australian species is easily recognized by the characteristic 5–8 cm long orange-red beak, slender pink legs and black and white plumage. With the wings extended, a white wing-stripe is also visible. The male and female show little differentiation, except that the males generally sport a shorter, wider beak.\n\nPied oystercatchers feed mainly on bivalve molluscs, but also take other invertebrates. The techniques they use to break open the shells of the molluscs vary greatly and are thought to be learned behavior.\n\nThey nest in shallow scrapes made in open areas near the shore and produce 2–3 eggs in a typical clutch. Each couple protects its nesting area and often uses the same area year after year. Like the gulls they share the shore with, oystercatchers will band together to mob a perceived threat.\n\nThe pied oystercatcher is considered federally to be 'secure' and in New South Wales, Australia, is listed as 'endangered'.\n\n"}

In addition to spoons, he plays the flute and recorder. To the larger public, he is probably best known for his collaborations with Soundgarden and Frank Zappa.\n\nArtis had been active since 1972 as a street artist when he had his first collaboration with a major artist, appearing on stage with Frank Zappa in Eugene, Oregon, and at New York's Palladium, in 1981.\n\nIn 1992 Artis made a guest appearance, (as local talent), at Bumbershoot, Seattle, which that year featured a lineup of acts including Soundgarden, who were to become instrumental in bringing Artis to the attention of a wider audience.\n\nIn 1993 he published a compilation of his poems and short stories called \"Artis-Aspirations to Manifestations from the Womb to the Void\". In 1994, an NPR's \"Morning Edition\" focused on him and his artistic rejection of material values. His song \"Wake Up Call\" opened the 1995 compilation \"Northwest Post-Grunge.\"\n\nIn the same year, he recorded \"Spoonman\" with Soundgarden, a song written by Chris Cornell, and named for and featuring Artis for an upcoming album \"Superunknown\". He played the spoons in the song and appeared in the music video. On their 1994 tour, he opened up for the band in New York City, and Shepherd's Bush in London. The single charted at number three on the US Mainstream Rock Tracks chart and at number nine on the US Modern Rock Tracks chart. The song also became a top twenty hit on the UK Singles Chart. In 1995, the song won the Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance.\n\nChris Cornell commented:\nIt's more about the paradox of who [Artis] is and what people perceive him as. He's a street musician, but when he's playing on the street, he is given a value and judged completely wrong by someone else. They think he's a street person, or he's doing this because he can't hold down a regular job. They put him a few pegs down on the social ladder because of how they perceive someone who dresses differently. The lyrics express the sentiment that I much more easily identify with someone like Artis than I would watch him play.\nOn November 10, 1995, he released an album titled \"Entertain the Entertainers\". \nThe album was rated four and a half stars out of five by Allmusic.com who called his release \"an exceptional album showing off a very good range for an artist that would otherwise be known more for the gimmick of his chosen instruments, regardless of his abilities on them.\"\n\nArtis has performed at many festivals, mostly in Canada and the United States. Other bands he has played with include Aerosmith and Phish, and he has been a featured performer at Seattle's Bumbershoot Festival (2003 and 2004) and the Oregon Country Fair.

{"id": "2058594", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2058594", "title": "Abbey of Kells", "text": "Abbey of Kells\n\nThe Abbey of Kells (\"Mainistir Cheanannais\" in Irish) is a former monastery in Kells, County Meath, Ireland, north of Dublin. It was founded in the early 9th century, and the Book of Kells was kept there during the later medieval and early modern periods before finally leaving the abbey in the 1650s. Much of the Book of Kells may have been created there, but historians cannot be certain of the exact date and circumstances of its creation.\n\nThe Abbey of Kells was reportedly founded by St. Columba ca. 554, after High King Diarmuid Mac Caroll of Tara granted the land.\n\nThe Abbey was refounded from Iona, the building taking from 807 until the consecration of the church in 814. The site was a former Irish hill fort. In 814, Cellach, Abbot of Iona, retired to Kells, but, contrary to what is sometimes claimed, it is clear from the \"Annals\" that Iona remained the main Columban house for several decades, despite the danger of Viking raids. Only in 878 were the main relics, with Columba's reliquary shrine specified in the records, moved to Ireland, with Kells becoming the new main Columban house. Though not mentioned, this might well have been when the Book of Kells came to Kells.\n\nAmong other theories, it is believed that the Book of Kells may have been either started in Iona and finished in Kells or written entirely in Kells by successive generation of monks. It certainly was in Kells, and is generally believed to have been brought there from Iona.\n\nThe Vikings continually raided the abbey during the 10th century and it was repeatedly sacked and pillaged. Despite the constant raids, the monks managed to keep the Book of Kells intact until 1006 when it was stolen from the shrine. A reference in the \"Annals of Ulster\" is generally believed to refer the theft of the Book of Kells and it relates that the manuscript was returned after two months without its cover. The force of the removal of the cover probably explains the missing illustrations at the beginning and end of the book.\n\nThe book was stored in the abbey for the remainder of the Middle Ages. In the 12th century, details of land charters for the abbey were copied onto blank pages of the Book of Kells as was common practice for the period. This is the earliest confirmed reference to its presence at the abbey. Later in the same century, the monastery was dissolved with the abbey becoming a parish church and the Book of Kells continued to be kept there. Catholic landowners acquired the land.\n\nThe Book of Kells remained at Kells until the 1650s when Cromwell's troops were stationed in the town. At that point it was sent to Dublin for safekeeping. In 1661, the Book of Kells ended up in Trinity College, Dublin where it has stayed ever since.\n\nToday, the monastic site includes a 10th-century round tower that rises around 90 feet from the original street level. It has five windows on the top floor rather than the usual four, overlooking the five roads leading into Kells.\n\nThe current church building (Church of Ireland) dates to 1778 and was renovated in 1965.\n\nNearby is St. Columb's House, a 10th-century oratory. There are also a number of 9th- to 10th-century high crosses. Three crosses and a cross base are located on the site itself, whilst the 9th-century \"Market Cross\" (originally at the abbey's eastern gate) is now located in front of the old courthouse. Legend has it that it was damaged by Cromwellian soldiers and that it was used to hang participants of the 1798 rebellion.\n\nThe round tower and high crosses are a National Monument of Ireland.\n\nThe monastic site is open to the public.\n\n\n\n"}

Beverages vary based on the amount of each of these key ingredients, the method of preparation, and the inclusion of other ingredients (varying from sugar or honey to salt or cardamom). Instant milk tea powder is a mass-produced product. \n\nLocal variations include:\n\nIn Britain, when hot tea and cold milk are drunk together, the drink is simply known as \"tea\" due to the vast majority of tea being consumed in such a way. The term \"milk tea\" is unused, although one may specify \"tea with milk\" if context requires it. This may cause confusion for people from cultures that traditionally drink tea without milk.\n\nThe Milk Tea Alliance is a term used to describe an online democratic solidarity movement made up of netizens from Thailand, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. The Milk Tea Alliance arose in response to the increased presence of Chinese trolls and nationalist commentators on social media. Australia has also been suggested to be a member of the Milk Tea Alliance, however the relation to actual milk tea is tenuous with the milk product Aptamil standing in for an actual variety of milk tea in imagery. \n\nThe \"Milk Tea Alliance\" moniker emerged in 2020 after Chinese nationalist Internet commentators criticised the Thai actor Bright for \"liking\" an image on Twitter which referred to Hong Kong as a \"country\", and called for a boycott of his TV programme. Twitter users in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and the Philippines joined Thai users in what \"The Telegraph\" called \"a rare moment of regional solidarity\".\n"}

Thomas\n\nWilliam Isaac Thomas (August 13, 1863 – December 5, 1947) was an American sociologist, understood today as a key figure behind the theory of \"symbolic interactionism\". \n\nWith the help of Polish sociologist Florian Znaniecki, W.I. Thomas developed and influenced the use of empirical methodologies in sociological research and contributed theories to the sociology of migration. Thomas went on to formulate a fundamental principle of sociology, known as the \"Thomas theorem\" (aka \"Thomas dictum\"), whereby he would contend that \"if men define situations as real, they are real in their consequences.\" This microsociological concept served as a theoretical foundation for the field of symbolic interactionism which was developed by Thomas's younger peers—primarily at the University of Chicago.\n\nWilliam Isaac Thomas was born on a farm in the Elk Garden section of Russell County, Virginia, on 13 August 1863. His mother was Sarah Price Thomas and his father was Thaddeus Peter Thomas, a Methodist minister of Pennsylvania Dutch descent. Thomas' father, wanting to broaden the educational opportunities for his children, moved the family to Knoxville, home of the University of Tennessee, when Thomas was a boy.\n\nIn 1888, Thomas married his first of two wives, Harriet Park, and in 1935, after the two divorced, Thomas married Dorothy Swaine Thomas, 36 years his junior.\n\nAfter leaving Harvard as a lecturer, Thomas gradually withdrew into retirement. Thomas spent his time in New York City, New Haven. He died at the age of 84 years old in Berkeley, California, on 5 December 1947. His body rests at Old Gray Cemetery in Knoxville, Tennessee.\n\nBeginning in 1880, Thomas studied literature and classics at the University of Tennessee, where he obtained a B.A. degree in 1884 and became Adjunct Professor in English and Modern Languages. While at Knoxville, Thomas also taught courses in Greek, Latin, French, German, and Natural history. At the same time, he developed an interest in ethnology and social science after reading Herbert Spencer's \"Principles of Sociology\".\n\nFrom 1888–1889, he attended the German universities of Berlin and Göttingen to pursue studies of classic and modern languages. During his time in Germany, he also furthered his interest in ethnology and sociology under the influence of German scholars such as Wilhelm Wundt.\n\nUpon his return to the United States in 1889, Thomas taught at Oberlin College in Oberlin, Ohio from 1889 to 1895 as a professor of English and then sociology.\n\nIn 1894, Thomas was invited to teach a class in sociology at the University of Chicago, whose preeminent sociology department is seen as the founding location of the discipline in the United States. The next year, he relocated to the University of Chicago permanently in order to pursue graduate studies in sociology and anthropology in the university's new department of sociology, where he finished his Ph.D. thesis, \"On a Difference in the Metabolism of the Sexes\", in 1896. After the completion of this work, he returned to Europe to conduct field studies in various ethnic and cultural problems in preparation for the writing of a comparative work on European nationalities that he never completed.\n\nFor nearly the next 25 years, Thomas taught sociology and anthropology at the University of Chicago, becoming instructor in 1895, assistant professor in 1896, associate professor in 1900, and professor in 1910. From 1895 until 1917, he also co-edited the \"American Journal of Sociology\".\n\nThomas' first major publication would be in 1907 with the book \"Sex and Society\". Despite a biological bias that would nowadays be considered sexist by many (e.g. \"Anthropologists…regard women as intermediate between the child and the man\"), the book was progressive for its time. In \"Sex and Society\", Thomas speculates that women's intellect might actually be superior to that of men's \"due to their superior cunning\" and \"superior endurance.\"\n\nFor the next decade (1908–1918) Thomas conducted research and began collaborating with Florian Znaniecki in 1913 to write \"The Polish Peasant\" \"in Europe and America.\" This work utilized an empirical methodological framework which was groundbreaking at the time and introduced the ideas of Social Organization/Disorganization.\n\nIn 1918, Thomas was arrested and mired in scandal due to his relationship with the wife of a U.S. army officer. Though charges under the \"Mann Act\" were eventually dropped, Thomas' moral and academic reputation was permanently damaged and he was dismissed by the University of Chicago before his trial reached a verdict.\n\nAfter the scandal, Thomas relocated to New York City and would never again obtain a tenured position. From 1923 to 1928, he lectured at the New School for Social Research, a progressive but marginally influential academic institution at that time, where he was able to make connections with a younger generation of sociologists who would eventually help Thomas restore his reputation. Thorstein Veblen, who had co-founded the school in 1919, had fallen from academic grace for similar reasons, and the school was therefore sympathetic to Thomas' plight. Thomas continued his research thanks to the support of philanthropists and institutions.\n\n1923 saw Thomas release his first work under his own name since his scandal. \"The Unadjusted Girl\" examines female delinquency, mainly in terms of transactional and casual sex, through the lens of socialization and how young women are imbued by society to conceive of sex and how this affects their behaviors and outcomes. Thomas conceives of this socialization as a \"definition of one's situation\" and is his earliest known application of the Thomas theorem.\n\nIn 1927, Thomas was elected president of the American Sociological Society (now known as the American Sociological Association). He belonged to a group often referred to as the earlier psychological school of sociologists along with Franklin Henry Giddings, E.A. Ross, Charles Cooley, and Ellsworth Faris. Thomas never published any material on the subject, but did use it as lecture material.\n\nIn 1928, Thomas co-authored \"The Child in America\" alongside research assistant Dorothy Swaine Thomas. This work explores how communal expectations of adjustment or maladjustment of children informs behavior problems in children and how the definition of these children's situations affects how they conceive their own maturation and behavior. This work marks the first use of the Thomas theorem verbatim.\n\nIn 1936, Pitirim A. Sorokin, chairman of the sociology department at Harvard University, invited Thomas to become a visiting lecturer. Thomas accepted the invitation and remained in Harvard until 1937.\n\nThough Thomas began his career focused on ethnography and macro-sociological studies, as his career progressed he became increasingly involved in the work of micro-sociology. When discussing his interests, Thomas writes:The sociopsychological aspects of culture history, or otherwise stated, social psychology as examined in relation to races, nationalities, classes, interest groups, etc., in different cultural situations and historical epochs; and second, personality development in normal, criminal and psychopathic individuals in relation to cultural situations and particular trains of experience as seen through their life-histories, which may be in the form of autobiographies, case studies, continuous and organized inter-views, etc. (I do not say `psychoanalysis' because of the meaning which this term has acquired).Furthermore, explaining about sociologists who have influenced him, Thomas writes:I do not feel that I have been greatly influenced by any of my teachers of sociology. My interests, as I have indicated, were in the marginal fields and not in sociology as it was organized and taught at that time, that is, the historical and methodological approach of Professor Small and the remedial and correctional interests of Professor Henderson.\nIn 1908, Thomas received a substantial grant from Helen Culver through the Helen Culver Fund for Race Psychology. The grant was to be used to finance research on the life and culture of immigrants for ten years. Until 1918, Thomas utilized the grant to undertake several journeys to Europe in order to study the background of East European immigrant groups. Initially planning to study several nationalities, he narrowed his topic down to immigrants from Poland, who formed the largest and most visible ethnic community in Chicago. For this purpose Thomas studied the Polish language, interviewed members of Chicago's Polish community, and made field trips to Poland.\n\nConsidered a pioneer of the biographical approach in social research and migration studies, Thomas employed methods of field observation that ethnographers had developed previously to study non-literate societies. Thomas has anecdotally claimed that an accident inspired him to use personal written material as primary ethnographic sources. Thomas recounted that while he was walking through a Chicago neighborhood he was almost hit with a garbage bag that had been thrown out of a window. The bag hit the ground and burst open on the sidewalk, revealing a letter that had been written by a Polish immigrant. This chance occurrence serendipitously led Thomas to develop the biographical approach to empirical sociological research that would prove part of his lasting reputation in the field.\n\nHe spent the next several years collecting oral and written reports from Chicago's Polish community as well as from Polish natives. Thomas utilized newspaper reports, archives of organizations, personal letters, diaries, and public documents which he acquired by placing advertisements in Chicago's Polish-language press, offering, for example, 10 or 20 cents for each mailed letter collected from Poland. This empirical approach of using first hand biographical material to measure larger social patterns was one of the early applications of empirical ethnography in the study of sociology, and can inform the methods of sociological studies which are conducted today.\n\nIn 1913 on one of his journeys to Poland, Thomas met the Polish sociologist Florian Witold Znaniecki, who was editing the journal \"Wychodźca polski\" (\"The Polish Emigrant\") and directing an organization representing Polish emigrants in Warsaw. Znaniecki assisted Thomas in his studies of organizations, which proved to be a valuable resource. When World War I broke out the following year, Znaniecki himself left Poland, which had been partitioned between three of the warring parties and now became a theater of war. Znanieck decided to travel to Chicago, where he met up with Thomas, but whether or not Thomas had formally invited Znaniecki remains unclear.\n\nIn all events, Thomas immediately employed Znaniecki as his research assistant. Znaniecki eventually became Thomas's co-author on their monumental work \"The Polish Peasant in Europe and America\" (1918–1919), which Lewis Coser called \"the earliest major landmark of American sociological research\". In it, Thomas and Znaniecki used a biographical approach to understanding culture in general. Furthermore, Thomas and Znaniecki's work developed an approach to understanding ethnicity in particular, which in many respects was ahead of its time and is currently being rediscovered in the context of transnational studies in migration. Studies akin to this work led to conclusions which may be seen as common knowledge today such as urbanization leads to the dissolution of shared fate and leads to the creation of new identities. Analysis which may be less ubiquitous lies in Thomas and Znaniecki's investigation of social organization. Thomas and Znaniecki note that as immigrant groups (such as the Poles they studied) are isolated from the environment they were socialized in and there is no form of enforcement of social rules, these social rules start to dictate a population's moral behaviors less and less. Thomas notes that this process primarily affects social institutions before it secondarily affects the conceptions and behaviors of social actors.\n\nIn his highly acclaimed work, \"The Unadjusted Girl\" (1923), Thomas explores female delinquency and promiscuity by exploring how women are socialized in distinct backgrounds to conceive of sex, responsibility and ladyhood based on personal interpretations of their situations and how this affects their behaviors and outcomes. It is through these psychosociological interpretations that Thomas introduced and developed the influential concept of the \"definition of the situation\". \n\nAccording to the \"definition of the situation\", prior to making a decision, people \"generally examine and deliberate about occurrences before acting.\" Individuals do not react to reality or facts, but rather their perception or personal 'definition' of these situations and facts. Therefore, the \"real\" facts of social interactions are the subjective interpretations individuals give to an objective reality. \"If people view somebody as great, then he is.\" Along with the ideas of George Herbert Mead, this concept later proved to be an important part of social constructionism, and of the rebellion of symbolic interactionism against structural functionalism.\n\nThomas' 1928 book, \"The Child in America\", co-authored with his research assistant Dorothy Swaine Thomas, includes a notion, drawing from his initial idea of the \"definition of the situation\", that would become a fundamental law of sociology, known as the \"Thomas theorem\": “If men define situations as real, they are real in their consequences.”\n\n\"The Child in America\" specifically investigated the misbehavior of children can be attributed to communal expectations of behavior and how these children define their own situations is indicative of their own conceptions maturation and acceptable behavior. Though this formation of definitions seems inherently individualistic, Thomas acknowledges that these definitions which dictate our behaviors spawn from societal institutions such as the family. Thomas also dialogues with the idea of \"spontaneous\" definitions which can alter and modify one's understanding of one's own definitions and symbols. Thomas states this can occur putting different people in the same situation or even placing the same individual in the same situation multiple times or with varying contexts.\n\nThe idea that personal definitions can be \"spontaneously\" changed through a process of negotiation is fervently contested by many sociologists who believe that an obedience to a novel set of rules and expectations is what dictates a shift in one's definitions over time.\n\nDespite the prominence gained through \"The Polish Peasant\", Thomas's reputation, both academic and non-academic, proved precarious. For a number of reasons, he was subject to critical attention from the conservative Chicago establishment. \n\n\nIn 1918, the FBI arrested Thomas under the \"Mann Act\", which prohibits \"interstate transport of females for immoral purposes,\" while in the company of one Mrs. Granger, the wife of an army officer with the American forces in France. It has been suggested that Thomas's arrest was meant to discredit his wife, who at the time was a pacifist activist. Although Thomas was acquitted of the charges in court, his career was damaged irreversibly by the negative publicity. The university, under conservative Harry Pratt Judson, dismissed him without awaiting the outcome of his trial and with little protest from his colleagues.\n\nThe University of Chicago Press, which already had published the first two volumes of \"The Polish Peasant\", released its contract with him, so that the work's remaining three volumes had to be published in Boston by Richard G. Badger. The Carnegie Corporation of New York, which had previously commissioned Thomas to write a volume for its \"Americanization\" series, refused to publish it in Thomas' name. Thus, in 1921, \"Old World Traits Transplanted\" appeared by authors Robert E. Park and Herbert A. Miller, who had contributed only minor parts to the book. It was not until 1951 that the book's authorship was re-credited to Thomas by a committee of the Social Science Research Council and reissued with its author's actual name.\n\n\n\n"}

It is mainly known for its well-preserved, heavily fortified medieval town wall and half-timbered houses.\n\nBüdingen is in the south of the Wetterau below the Vogelsberg hills at an altitude of approx. 160 meters. The city is situated 15 km northwest of Gelnhausen and about 40 km east from Frankfurt am Main. Historically, the city belongs to Oberhessen.\n\nBüdingen is situated in a wet and swampy valley. The castle and the old town therefore rest on centuries-old oak planks, placed horizontally across vertical beech piles (poles). The water level has to be kept high enough so that no air can reach these foundations.\n\nSince 1972, the municipality includes the following formerly independent villages: Aulendiebach, Büches, Büdingen (core or centre), Calbach, Diebach am Haag, Düdelsheim (the largest municipality), Dudenrod, Eckartshausen, Lorbach, Michelau, Orleshausen, Rinderbügen, Rohrbach, Vonhausen, Wolf, and Wolferborn.\n\nIn the same year, the district (\"Landkreis\") of Büdingen was dissolved, and Büdingen and the district of Friedberg formed the \"Wetteraukreis\", with Friedberg becoming the new district capital.\n\nAround 700 the wooden church of Saint Remigius was built by an unknown lord. In 847 a \"Büdingen\" was named in a document for the first time, but it is not clear which Büdingen was meant, because there are some other smaller towns with the same name in Germany and Lorraine. An additional floor was added to St. Remigius's church in about 1050 and the building has basically remained unchanged since then.\n\nIn 1131 the House of Büdingen were mentioned for the first time. They became Burggrafen of Gelnhausen in 1155. The \"villa\" () Büdingen was officially mentioned in 1206. The ruling House of Büdingen died out with Gerlach II before 1247.\n\nTheir heirs were the houses of Hohenlohe-Brauneck, of Isenburg-Kempenich, of Trimberg, of Hohenlohe and of Isenburg. On 26 July 1330, Holy Roman Emperor Louis IV granted the status of a market town to Luther of Büdingen.\n\nWith his edict of liberty in 1353, Burggraf Heinrich II granted freedom and some independence to the people of Büdingen. In return the people had to defend the city, so the Marksmen's Society was founded. This society still exists today as one of the oldest rifle associations in Germany.\n\nSince 1442 the masters of Büdingen have been known as Grafen of Isenburg-Büdingen. After a local war, Graf Ludwig II built an enormous new defensive wall with 22 towers around the old stronghold between 1480 and 1510. These walls are still nearly completely extant and they are one of the most important medieval fortifications in Germany.\n\nIn 1521, Martin Luther allegedly passed through. In the same year, the town became Protestant, later to become Calvinist.\n\nIn 1576, the Black Death killed many inhabitants, as it did again in 1632.\n\nIn 1590, a great fire destroyed many buildings.\n\nBetween 1633 and 1634 114 people were victims of witch hunting, although the first prosecutions took place in 1567. During the Thirty Years' War, in 1634, the town was taken by Imperial troops, who defeated the Swedish occupants.\n\nIn 1578 Emperor Rudolf II rewarded the Grafen/Counts of Büdingen with the \"Jubilate\"-market (from the Latin word jubilate: \"to praise\"); an occasion for feasting. In 1806 the County of Ysenburg-Büdingen was annexed to the Principality of Isenburg-Birstein. After the Congress of Vienna, the Principality of Isenburg was divided in 1816 between the Grand Duchy of Hessen-Darmstadt and the Electorate of Hessen; Büdingen went to Hesse-Darmstadt. In 1840, Graf Ernst Casimir III was promoted by a decree of the Grand Duke to the status of hereditary prince.\n\nIn 1601 Graf Wolfgang Ernst founded the Latin School, known today as the Wolfgang-Ernst-Gymnasium. In 1712 Graf Ernst Casimir I issued an edict of tolerance permitting religious dissenters to settle in Büdingen. As a result, by 1724 there was a suburb at the Lower Gate (Jerusalem Gate) where Huguenots, Waldensians, sectarians, and other separationists lived.\n\nIn 1822, administration and justice were split in the Grand-Duchy of Hesse-Darmstadt. Büdingen became seat of the Büdingen counties lawcourt, which was followed in 1852 by the installation of the district of Büdingen. In 1839, the laborers' school (later called the trade school) was founded. The Mathildenhospital was built between 1867 and 1868. In 1879, a credit union (today the \"Volksbank\"), was founded. In 1936 Büdingen became a garrison town; U.S. troops were stationed there since 1945. The last American troops (1st Squadron, 1st Cavalry Regiment) departed Büdingen on 15 August 2007, ending 71 years of town history as a military garrison.\n\nMail service between Büdingen and Frankfurt am Main began in 1739: one mail coach and two mounted messengers a week. The Gießen–Gelnhausen railway, including Büdingen station was opened between Büdingen and Gelnhausen on 30 November 1870. In 1879 the new Gymnasium was built, including a gym and the principal's residence. Between 1888 and 1895 built a water main and began partial installation of a sewage system. The municipal gas works was established in 1910, and Büdingen received electric light in 1913.\n\n\n\n Other personalities associated with the town: \n\n"}

Situated 50 kilometres (32 mi) north of Brandon, Manitoba on the Little Saskatchewan River. The town's name means \"flowing water\" in the Dakota language. The population of Minnedosa reported in the 2006 Statistics Canada Census was 2,474. The town is located in the Rural Municipality of Minto and bordered to the south by the Rural Municipality of Odanah.\n\nPrior to the arrival of Europeans in the area of Minnedosa, the land was primarily traveled and used by the nomadic Ojibway, Cree, Assiniboine, and Sioux peoples. John Tanner was the grandson of John Tanner who had been raised by a Shawnee. He was an American settler who arrived in the area in 1869. The younger Tanner was the first Métis settler in the area and ran a ferry service across the Little Saskatchewan River. When a bridge was built in 1879, the ferry became obsolete and at the same time, a small town, Tanner's Crossing, was started nearby. John Armitage moved to the area around this time in 1877, and began to build a sawmill and gristmill. He joined together with Tanner to lay out a new town site and eventually Armitage had accumulated of property. Tanner named the new town Minnedosa, from the Dakota word \"mnidúza\" meaning \"flowing water\".\n\nAlthough Minnedosa once hoped to be a site of a river crossing for the Canadian Pacific Railway's transcontinental railway, the honour was initially given to Rapid City, while the actual site of the railway was later settled on a site much further south creating the city of Brandon. In 1883 Minnedosa was incorporated as a town, it had experienced a period of growth from settlement schemes put forth by the Canadian government. As Minnedosa became a town, this coincided with the actual arrival of the railway in 1883, bringing about more growth for the now quickly growing settlement.\n\nA dam was proposed in 1907 and approved in December of the same year by the Government of Canada. It was built on the Little Saskatchewan River near the town. After several delays, the dam was completed in 1912, creating Minnedosa Lake. Water first flowed over the spillway on April 10, 1912. Minnedosa was the second community in the Province of Manitoba to generate its own hydroelectric power. An earlier project in 1900 was also on the Minnedosa River and supplied power to the town of Brandon, Manitoba. Initially privately owned, the generation plant was taken over by the Manitoba Power Commission in 1920 and replaced by a diesel generation plant and by 1930, power from the provincial grid. The lake was used as a source of water for the town, for recreation, and for supplying the engines of the Canadian Pacific Railway. On May 4, 1948 the spillway of the dam failed due to erosion of structure, and the resulting flood damaged many homes and businesses in the town. The spillway was not repaired until 1950 by the Prairie Farm Rehabilitation Administration.\n\nSince 1981 the Minnedosa Ethanol Plant has been producing ethanol to be blended into gasoline, as of late 2007 it has been expanded into one of the largest ethanol facilities in Canada. This plant is owned and operated by Husky Energy.\n\nMinnedosa has a humid continental climate (Köppen \"dfb\") typical of southern Manitoba. As a result of its far inland position at a relatively high latitude, winters are extremely cold with a January mean of below . In the relatively short summers Minnedosa experiences warm and sometimes hot temperatures due to warmer continental air masses. It is prone to cold nights year-round, with every single month having recorded air frost.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

All potential applicants take an entrance exam in November to January. If they pass the first round of admissions, the applicant is called in for a group interview. Admissions is based on entrance exam scores, standardized test results (seventh grade NJ ASK results), teacher recommendations, and the interview. Once admitted, the student is required to attend a two-week summer program. The program runs from 8:00 am to 3:00 pm and transportation is not provided. Students spend time in CAD, Math Analysis I, AP Physics 1, and Humanities classes.\n\nAll eighth grade students in Morris County are eligible to take the admissions test – the Accuplacer exam, offered by the College Board – after acquiring specific teacher recommendations. Students must have completed or be enrolled in an Algebra 1 course at their middle school. Because the Academy for Mathematics, Science, and Engineering is typically the most popular academy in terms of student interest as compared to the other academies offered by the Morris County Vocational School District, the selection process is thus particularly competitive. The admissions rate for the 2015-2016 school year was 16.4%.\n\nBecause of the workload and challenge of the curriculum, no Academy class has graduated with the full twenty-six members with which it originally started. The first graduating class in 2004, for example began with 24 students but only graduated 12. The second fared slightly better, beginning with 21 students and graduating 14 students. The 2009 graduating class lost 8 members in the first 2 quarters of their freshman year, another at the end of their sophomore year, and another before the start of their senior, year leaving it as the second-smallest class with 13 students. Recent classes have been slowly improving; the 2010 graduating class graduated 15, and the 2013 class graduated 21. The 2017 class is on track to become the first class to graduate all 26 members.\n\nAlthough it is not allowed for there to be an activity that only Academy students can participate in, Academy students are responsible for founding many of Morris Hills High School's activities, such as the Astronomy Club which was formed in 2006 by the members of the class of 2009. There is also an Academy Physics club which consists of the five Freshman academy students with the highest first marking period average. Members of the Academy Class of 2013 established the Morris Hills chapter of the Junior State of America, and members of the Academy Class of 2017 established the Morris Hills chapter of the Science Olympiad. Since some clubs meet from 7:30 to 8:00, there may be problems in attending the meetings due to the extended school day for Academy students (which begins at 7:18 to allow for the Z-Block course, versus the 8:05 time for Morris Hills Students).\n\nStudents, if they wish, can play sports with other students in Morris Hills High School.\n\nAcademy students must accumulate 170 credits to graduate, 50 credits more than the New Jersey state graduation requirement and 30 credits more than Morris Hills High School graduation requirement. In doing so, students must meet multiple sets of requirements imposed by the state, the school district, and the Academy itself.\n\nState requirements include physical education (three quarters physical education and one quarter of health annually), one year of a foreign language, one year of fine arts, one year of business and financial literacy, and one computer proficiency class. In practice, the business requirement is fulfilled by the mandatory Academy Business Strategies course, the computer requirement is fulfilled by the mandatory CAD courses, and most students take three or four years of a language in accordance with the recommendations of highly selective universities. The only remaining requirements that students must pay attention to is the visual and performing arts requirement. The art requirement can be fulfilled through the Morris Hills offerings consisting of Chorus, Band, String Ensemble, Music Appreciation, Fundamentals of Music 1, AP Music Theory, Foundation Art, Drawing and Painting, Digital Art and Design, AP Studio Art, and AP Art History, among others.\n\nAcademy course requirements are listed below. Notably, students go through the science curriculum by taking physics, then chemistry, then biology, in an approach known as \"Physics First\" (see section below). Students must take multiple science and technology courses, such as computer aided drafting and engineering. Students must also take four years of mathematics instead of three, one year more than the state and district requirement.\n\nThe Academy operates on a quarterly grading system and uses a 100-point numerical scale. Grade point averages are thus based out of 100 rather than the traditional 4.0 used by many other high schools. Honors courses receive 5 extra points when factored into the GPA calculation, and Advanced Placement courses receive 10 extra points when factored into the GPA calculation.\n\nAcademy students are not ranked due to the competitiveness of the program and the small class size.\n\nAll courses denoted \"Academy\" are taught at the honors level and are taught to only students of the Academy. These courses are often more rigorous than their counterparts taught to Morris Hills students. All courses denoted \"AP\" represent courses under the Advanced Placement program offered by the College Board. These courses are taught to a mixed group of students from both the Academy and Morris Hills, with the notable of exception of freshman year AP Physics 1.\n\nFreshmen who enter the Academy already having taken a geometry course in middle school are eligible to place out of the course through an end-of-course exam. Students who receive a passing score take an additional elective course. Some students choose to pursue an AP course, such as AP Computer Science Principles, as this additional elective (see list below).\n\n\n\n\nStudents can choose from a comprehensive list of 25 Advanced Placement courses offered by Morris Hills High School. While the only course in which students \"must\" enroll in order to graduate is AP Physics 1, nearly all students take advantage of other Advanced Placement offerings during their sophomore, junior, and senior years.\n\nIn practice, however, Academy students have extremely limited schedules and very few available blocks to take electives of their choice, largely due to the numerous core science and technology classes required as part of the program. Typically, students only have enough space in their schedules to take one AP course sophomore year, four during their junior year, and three or four during their senior year, depending on each student's specific situation in regards to the arts requirement, desire to continue with a foreign language, and placement out of freshman year Geometry.\n\nMorris Hills High School offers students the option to take any Advanced Placement exam offered by the College Board, even those for which there is not a corresponding course at the school. Some students choose to self-study courses during the school year and take the exam in May to potentially receive college credit.\n\nThe Academy curriculum employs the Physics First approach, in which freshmen take an introductory physics course (AP Physics 1) rather than the traditional biology course offered to most high school freshmen. The primary difficulty with the implementation of Physics First in most high school curricula lies within the fact that most high school freshmen lack the required Algebra 1 background prior to beginning the introductory physics course, but since all Academy students are required to enter freshman year having completed an Algebra I course, the Academy does not encounter this issue. The basic trigonometry – including the three trigonometric functions – necessary in physics is also taught to students at the beginning of their Geometry course. Further topics in trigonometry – including graphs of trigonometric functions – are rearranged to be taught earlier in the Algebra II/Pre-Calculus curriculum through special cooperation between the Physics and Mathematical Analysis instructors. The Physics First approach emphasizes concepts in Physics in the instruction of Chemistry and concepts of Chemistry in the instruction of Biology.\n\nAcademy students may elect to study AP Physics C (both the and components of the course) later during their high school careers. These courses are offered in conjunction with Morris Hills High School. Note that there is no opportunity for students to take AP Physics 2, except through self-study.\n\nThe senior year internship is a mandatory component of the Academy curriculum and students cannot graduate without having completed one (or more internship) totaling to one hundred hours. The internship must be approved by the board of education of the Morris County Vocational School District and must be demonstrably related to the fields of mathematics, science, and engineering.\n\nNearly all Academy students earn college credits while in high school. Most of these credits are earned through high scores achieved on Advanced Placement exams, as well as courses approved by Seton Hall University (including the sophomore year Academy Chemistry course) or the New Jersey Institute of Technology. All Academy graduates are awarded an official NJIT transcript listing credits earned through the articulation agreement.\n\n"}

The churchyard wall contains the remains of a round tower, which suggests that a monastic community may have existed on the site before the castle was built.\n\nThe most noteworthy attraction in Ardrahan is Tulira Castle, once owned by playwright and independence activist Edward Martyn. Tulira Castle was for a long time owned by Galway County Council, but was bought in 2015 by CarTrawler owner Niall Turley for €5.8 million.\n\nThe church at Labane, Ardrahan, which was the parish church of Joe Roche, has several stained glass windows by Alfred E. Child, Ethel Rhind and Michael Healy.\n\nArdrahan is on the R458.\n\nArdrahan railway station opened on 15 September 1869, was closed to passenger traffic on 5 April 1976 and finally closed on 11 June 1983.\nA new railway station has opened as part of phase one of the reopening of the Western Rail Corridor between Ennis and Athenry.\n\nThere are two schools in Ardrahan: Labane N.S, Ballyglass N.S.\n\nArdahan hurling club won its first Galway Senior Hurling Club Championship title in 1894 and since then has won it on 11 occasions, having contested 18 county finals in its history. It is second on the role of honour to Castlegar who have won 17 titles. The last title was won after a replay in 1978, against rival neighbours Ballindereen. Other significant wins include the U21 title in 1977, the U21 B in 2001 and also in 2010, and two county minor titles in 1975 and 1978.\n\nArdrahan also has a Camogie club. In 2006 the U14 girls won the Féile Final and went on to represent Galway in Cork at All-Ireland stage. They got to the All-Ireland Semi-Final.\n\nAlso in 2019, the u14 girls won the Féile Final and went on to represent Galway in Cork, at division 3. There they won all but one of their matches and went on to win the cup All-Ireland final against na Fianna. They had a narrow win of only one point. This was a huge achievement for all involved.\n\nArdrahan is mentioned in William Hope Hodgson's book \"The House on the Borderland\" as the nearest greater village to a small village called Kraighten, near which the author's diary has been found.\nArdrahan also features in the rousing ballad \"The West's Awake\", most famously rendered by Joe McDonagh in the immediate aftermath of Galway's All Ireland Hurling Championship victory of 1980.\n\n\n"}
