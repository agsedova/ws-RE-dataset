He had already begun his singing career at the age of 15.\n\nCarvalho abandoned athletics in 1972, concentrating solely on his music, and immediately became famous in his native Angola, as well as in Portugal. After the Carnation Revolution in April 1974, he would become a hit both with immigrants from the ex-Portuguese colonies, and Portuguese of both African and European descent. He has released over 30 albums, singing in Portuguese and traditional Angolan languages. His tracks are a mixture of Portuguese folk sounds, semba, kizomba and latin elements.\n\nWhile Angola was still a Portuguese colony, Bonga was an outspoken supporter of independence. This led him to be exiled from Angola in the early 1970s.\n\nAt this time, Portugal was ruled by the authoritarian and conservative Estado Novo regime government, founded by Salazar. Barceló de Carvalho's status as a Portuguese star athlete allowed him the rare freedom of movement, which he used – under the name of Bonga Kuenda – to carry messages between exiled pro-independence African fighters and compatriots still in Angola. When the Portuguese government and its political police (P.I.D.E.) realised Bonga Kuenda and Barceló de Carvalho were the same man, Bonga was forced into exile in Rotterdam, where, in 1972, he definitively adopted the name Bonga and recorded his first record, \"Angola 72\". His iconic track \"Mona Ki Ngi Xica\", which would feature on the soundtrack of Cédric Klapisch's 1996 film \"When the Cat's Away\" (\"Chacun cherche son chat\"), was introduced on this album. A warrant for his arrest was issued in Angola for the seditious lyrics of the album, forcing him to move nomadically between Germany, Belgium and France until Angola's independence from Portugal in 1975, brought about by the events of the Carnation Revolution. While in Europe, Bonga met other Portuguese-speaking musicians and adapted the sounds of semba to his already diverse music style.\n\nAfter independence, the new Angolan government took Angola's best solo acts and founded and supported an orchestra called \"Semba Tropical\". The purpose was to revive the lost music industry, as described by a People's Republic of Angola ministry spokesman during the band's tour in Europe in the mid-1980s:\n\"We had great problems because of the war for independence. When the Portuguese left they dismantled some of the basic structure by smashing and sabotaging equipment and we had to start from scratch. After independence there were no bands at all. Those which were formed were not active because they had no instruments.\" As it was the case under Portugal's colonial rule, only a tiny minority of Angolans (1%) were allowed to get an education. Thus, the newly independent country, with relatively good infrastructure, and blessed with rich natural resources, was in fact badly mismanaged and plagued by corruption and failed central planning for several decades after independence from Portugal.\n\nAfter Angola's independence Bonga lived for some time in Paris and Angola, before establishing his main residence in Lisbon. As post-colonial life in Angola disintegrated into corruption, squalor, brutality, and an interminable and bloody civil war, Bonga remained critical of the political leaders on all sides. Bonga's voice of peace and conscience continues to make him a hero to the people of Angola no matter where he resides. He remains fiercely dedicated to the ideal of nonviolence, he states simply: \"We must live without harming others.\"\n\nNow aged 74, he publishes in 2016 his thirty-first album Recados de Fora (Messages from Elsewhere) which include 9 new songs including Tonokenu, plus the covers of Sodade Meu Bem Sodade, a composition of Zé do Norte already sung by Maria Bethânia or Nazaré Pereira, and Odji Maguado composed by the Capeverdean writer B. Leza and popularised by Cesaria Evora in her 1990 album, \"Distino di Belita\".\n\nBonga received the distinction of \"Knight of the Order of Arts and Letters\" by the French government. The honorable mention was delivered by the Ministry of Culture of France in a ceremony on 10 December 2014 in Angola.\n\n\n\n"}

It was East Prussia's sole university and was specially regarded for its mathematics and astronomy. The campus was severely damaged by British aerial bombing in August 1944 during World War II. The Albertina was closed after Königsberg was captured by the Red Army in 1945.\n\nAfter the war, Königsberg was renamed Kaliningrad and the new Russophone \"Kaliningrad State Pedagogical Institute\" used the campus of the Albertina from 1948 to 1967, including the main Albertina building inaugurated in 1862, in which some of the original structure can still be seen. In 1967, the institute received the status of a university and became known as \"Kaliningrad State University\".\n\nIn 2005, during the celebrations of the 750th anniversary of the founding of Königsberg, President Vladimir Putin of Russia and Chancellor Gerhard Schröder of Germany announced that the university would be renamed \"Immanuel Kant Russian State University\" in honour of Immanuel Kant.\n\nAs of 2005, the university consisted of twelve faculties with courses ranging from Natural Sciences to the Humanities. It had approximately 12,800 students enrolled, both undergraduate and post-graduate, and 580 faculty staff. IKSUR's Kant Society was created to study Kantianism, or Kantian philosophy. The university is also interested in the historical connections between Königsberg and Russia as far back as the 16th century.\n\nIn 2010-2011 the university is undergoing an enlargement and rebranding process which will lead to changing its name from Immanuel Kant State University of Russia to Immanuel Kant Baltic Federal University.\n\nThe Immanuel Kant Baltic Federal University of today is an educational, scientific, cultural and enlightenment centre of the westernmost region of Russia.\n\"Social and cultural services and tourism; Law; Services; Interpreting and translation studies; Applied mathematics and informatics; Marketing; Mathematical maintenance and administration of information systems; Tourism; Mathematics; Philosophy; Journalism; Transport management and logistics.\"\n\nPercentage of students according to the major fields of study\n\nA science park was set up at the university in 2008. The major task of the park is the concentration of research potential. The IKBFU innovation park implements the Presidential programme for training managerial staff for national enterprises. The educational courses offered within this programme enable students to acquire expertise in the application of approaches and tools for strategic development in a business environment.\n\nThe level of international cooperation places IKBFU amongst the top ten higher educational institutions of Russia. One of the goals of the International Office of IKBFU is to promote interest in the Russian educational system among the Baltic Sea States. The aim of the International Office is managing and coordinating international activities of the university as a whole, its students and Ph.D. candidates, teachers and staff members. The International Office deals not only with the academic and research exchange programs or organization of foreign delegations visits, but also launches and arranges international events including international cyber sport tournaments and theatre festivals.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2334511", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2334511", "title": "What Is Life?", "text": "What Is Life?\n\nWhat Is Life? The Physical Aspect of the Living Cell is a 1944 science book written for the lay reader by physicist Erwin Schrödinger. The book was based on a course of public lectures delivered by Schrödinger in February 1943, under the auspices of the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies where he was Director of Theoretical Physics, at Trinity College, Dublin. The lectures attracted an audience of about 400, who were warned \"that the subject-matter was a difficult one and that the lectures could not be termed popular, even though the physicist’s most dreaded weapon, mathematical deduction, would hardly be utilized.\" Schrödinger's lecture focused on one important question: \"how can the events in space and time which take place within the spatial boundary of a living organism be accounted for by physics and chemistry?\"\n\nIn the book, Schrödinger introduced the idea of an \"aperiodic crystal\" that contained genetic information in its configuration of covalent chemical bonds. In the 1950s, this idea stimulated enthusiasm for discovering the genetic molecule. Although the existence of some form of hereditary information had been hypothesized since 1869, its role in reproduction and its helical shape were still unknown at the time of Schrödinger's lecture. In retrospect, Schrödinger's aperiodic crystal can be viewed as a well-reasoned theoretical prediction of what biologists should have been looking for during their search for genetic material. Both James D. Watson, and Francis Crick, who jointly proposed the double helix structure of DNA based on, amongst other theoretical insights, X-ray diffraction experiments by Rosalind Franklin, credited Schrödinger's book with presenting an early theoretical description of how the storage of genetic information would work, and each independently acknowledged the book as a source of inspiration for their initial researches.\n\nThe book is based on lectures delivered under the auspices of the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies, at Trinity College, Dublin, in February 1943 and published in 1944. At that time DNA was not yet accepted as the carrier of hereditary information, which only was the case after the Hershey–Chase experiment of 1952. One of the most successful branches of physics at this time was statistical physics, and quantum mechanics, a theory which is also very statistical in its nature. Schrödinger himself is one of the founding fathers of quantum mechanics.\n\nMax Delbrück's thinking about the physical basis of life was an important influence on Schrödinger. However, long before the publication of \"What is Life?\", geneticist and 1946 Nobel-prize winner H. J. Muller had in his 1922 article \"Variation due to Change in the Individual Gene\" already laid out all the basic properties of the \"heredity molecule\" (then not yet known to be DNA) that Schrödinger was to re-derive in 1944 \"from first principles\" in \"What is Life?\" (including the \"aperiodicity\" of the molecule), properties which Muller specified and refined additionally in his 1929 article \"The Gene As The Basis of Life\" and during the 1930s. Moreover, H. J. Muller himself wrote in a 1960 letter to a journalist regarding \"What Is Life?\" that whatever the book got right about the \"hereditary molecule\" had already been published before 1944 and that Schrödinger's were only the wrong speculations; Muller also named two famous geneticists (including Delbrück) who knew every relevant pre-1944 publication and had been in contact with Schrödinger before 1944. But DNA as the molecule of heredity became topical only after Oswald Avery's most important bacterial-transformation experiments in 1944. Before these experiments, proteins were considered the most likely candidates.\n\nIn chapter I, Schrödinger explains that most physical laws on a large scale are due to chaos on a small scale. He calls this principle \"order-from-disorder.\" As an example he mentions diffusion, which can be modeled as a highly ordered process, but which is caused by random movement of atoms or molecules. If the number of atoms is reduced, the behaviour of a system becomes more and more random. He states that life greatly depends on order and that a naïve physicist may assume that the master code of a living organism has to consist of a large number of atoms.\n\nIn chapter II and III, he summarizes what was known at this time about the hereditary mechanism. Most importantly, he elaborates the important role mutations play in evolution. He concludes that the carrier of hereditary information has to be both small in size and permanent in time, contradicting the naïve physicist's expectation. This contradiction cannot be resolved by classical physics.\n\nIn chapter IV, Schrödinger presents molecules, which are indeed stable even if they consist of only a few atoms, as the solution. Even though molecules were known before, their stability could not be explained by classical physics, but is due to the discrete nature of quantum mechanics. Furthermore, mutations are directly linked to quantum leaps.\n\nHe continues to explain, in chapter V, that true solids, which are also permanent, are crystals. The stability of molecules and crystals is due to the same principles and a molecule might be called \"the germ of a solid.\" On the other hand, an amorphous solid, without crystalline structure, should be regarded as a liquid with a very high viscosity. Schrödinger believes the heredity material to be a molecule, which unlike a crystal does not repeat itself. He calls this an aperiodic crystal. Its aperiodic nature allows it to encode an almost infinite number of possibilities with a small number of atoms. He finally compares this picture with the known facts and finds it in accordance with them.\n\nIn chapter VI Schrödinger states:\n\nHe knows that this statement is open to misconception and tries to clarify it. The main principle involved with \"order-from-disorder\" is the second law of thermodynamics, according to which entropy only increases in a closed system (such as the universe). Schrödinger explains that living matter evades the decay to thermodynamical equilibrium by homeostatically maintaining negative entropy in an open system.\n\nIn chapter VII, he maintains that \"order-from-order\" is not absolutely new to physics; in fact, it is even simpler and more plausible. But nature follows \"order-from-disorder\", with some exceptions as the movement of the celestial bodies and the behaviour of mechanical devices such as clocks. But even those are influenced by thermal and frictional forces. The degree to which a system functions mechanically or statistically depends on the temperature. If heated, a clock ceases to function, because it melts. Conversely, if the temperature approaches absolute zero, any system behaves more and more mechanically. Some systems approach this mechanical behaviour rather fast with room temperature already being practically equivalent to absolute zero.\n\nSchrödinger concludes this chapter and the book with philosophical speculations on determinism, free will, and the mystery of human consciousness. He attempts to \"see whether we cannot draw the correct non-contradictory conclusion from the following two premises: (1) My body functions as a pure mechanism according to Laws of Nature; and (2) Yet I know, by incontrovertible direct experience, that I am directing its motions, of which I foresee the effects, that may be fateful and all-important, in which case I feel and take full responsibility for them. The only possible inference from these two facts is, I think, that I – I in the widest meaning of the word, that is to say, every conscious mind that has ever said or felt 'I' – am the person, if any, who controls the 'motion of the atoms' according to the Laws of Nature\". Schrödinger then states that this insight is not new and that Upanishads considered this insight of \"ATHMAN = BRAHMAN\" to \"represent quintessence of deepest insights into the happenings of the world. Schrödinger rejects the idea that the source of consciousness should perish with the body because he finds the idea \"distasteful\". He also rejects the idea that there are multiple immortal souls that can exist without the body because he believes that consciousness is nevertheless highly dependent on the body. Schrödinger writes that, to reconcile the two premises,The only possible alternative is simply to keep to the immediate experience that consciousness is a singular of which the plural is unknown; that there is only one thing and that what seems to be a plurality is merely a series of different aspects of this one thing…\n\nAny intuitions that consciousness is plural, he says, are illusions. Schrödinger is sympathetic to the Hindu concept of Brahman, by which each individual's consciousness is only a manifestation of a unitary consciousness pervading the universe — which corresponds to the Hindu concept of God. Schrödinger concludes that \"...'I' am the person, if any, who controls the 'motion of the atoms' according to the Laws of Nature.\" However, he also qualifies the conclusion as \"necessarily subjective\" in its \"philosophical implications\". In the final paragraph, he points out that what is meant by \"I\" is not the collection of experienced events but \"namely the canvas upon which they are collected.\" If a hypnotist succeeds in blotting out all earlier reminiscences, he writes, there would be no loss of personal existence — \"Nor will there ever be.\"\n\nIn a world governed by the second law of thermodynamics, all isolated systems are expected to approach a state of maximum disorder. Since life approaches and maintains a highly ordered state, some argue that this seems to violate the aforementioned second law, implying that there is a paradox. However, since the biosphere is not an isolated system, there is no paradox. The increase of order inside an organism is more than paid for by an increase in disorder outside this organism by the loss of heat into the environment. By this mechanism, the second law is obeyed, and life maintains a highly ordered state, which it sustains by causing a net increase in disorder in the Universe. In order to increase the complexity on Earth—as life does—free energy is needed and in this case is provided by the Sun.\n\n\n\n"}

The subtitle is used to differentiate it from \"Batman Forever\", another beat 'em up published by Acclaim at around the same time. One or two players, playing as Batman and Robin, fight Two-Face, the Riddler, and numerous henchmen.\n\nTaking on the role of either Batman or Robin, players can punch, kick, and use special combination attacks to defeat waves of enemies.\n\nThe special combinations applied to enemies can add up to a possible 150+ hits on a single villain.\n\nSpecial weapons, such as Batarangs, can be found throughout the levels. It is sectioned off into stages, and arranged with waves of enemies before ending with a boss.\n\nThe game has a two-player mode, which allows both players to use the same character if so desired.\n\nAcclaim first demonstrated the game at the 1996 American Coin Machine Exposition. \"Batman Forever: The Arcade Game\" was Acclaim Entertainment's first arcade game. It was built on Sega's \"Titan\" technology, the hardware which formed the foundation for the Sega 32X and Sega Saturn. Even though the arcade version was only released in America, it can also run on Japanese and European Titan systems.\n\nPrior to the release of the arcade and home versions, an Atari Jaguar CD port was in development by Probe Entertainment after Atari Corporation and Acclaim announced their partnership in 1995 that included plans to release three titles for the system, but \"Batman Forever: The Arcade Game\" was later licensed to Atari Corp. a few months later after the announcement of the partnership and was going to be based upon the PlayStation version that was also in development at the time. The port was originally slated to be published around the third quarter of 1995 and was later rescheduled for an April/Q1 1996 release, but work on the port was discontinued sometime in 1995 and was never released. \n\n\"Batman Forever: The Arcade Game\" was also in the prospect of being converted on arcade hardware using technology based on the then-upcoming Panasonic M2.\n\nReviewing the arcade version, a \"Next Generation\" critic praised the large selection of elaborate moves and combos, likening it to the \"Street Fighter\" series in this respect, as well as the use of sprite scaling to enable a wider range of movement and deeper gameplay, but still argued that the game lacks sufficient innovation to save the aging 2D beat 'em up genre. He also criticized the predictable level design and the gloomy graphics, saying they make it difficult to follow the action.\n\nThe Saturn conversion received mediocre reviews. Criticisms widely varied from review to review, but the most commonly cited problems were that the gameplay is too repetitive and the character graphics are blocky. Critics mostly assessed the game on its own terms rather than its quality as a conversion, though a \"Next Generation\" critic noted that the Saturn version is missing frames of animation from the arcade version. He summarized the game, and beat 'em ups in general, as \"All flash, and absolutely zero substance.\" Lee Nutter of \"Sega Saturn Magazine\" called it \"a poor man's \"Guardian Heroes\", except that it is actually quite expensive.\" \"GameSpot\"s Glenn Rubenstein and \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\"s Shawn Smith and Dan Hsu were somewhat more positive, remarking that while the game is objectively weak, its sheer loudness and chaotic energy are not without a certain charm. \"GamePro\"s The Rookie, while having little but criticism for the game, said that fans of side-scrolling beat 'em ups should try the game as a rental, since the genre had largely died out by the time of the game's release.\n\nIn a feature on the game, \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" stated that the Saturn and PlayStation versions are identical aside from minor cosmetic differences, such as differing loading screens and the PlayStation version lacking the Batmobile intro's screen blurring effect. In his review of the PlayStation version, \"GamePro\"s Gideon said it was a faithful conversion, but that the fun of the arcade version simply does not translate to the home console experience.\n\n"}

He is currently in charge of Fleetwood Town's development squad and is caretaker manager of the first team squad.\n\nHe started his professional career with Rangers and went on to play over 100 games for each of Dunfermline Athletic, Aberdeen and Preston North End. He then played for Fleetwood Town before finishing his career at Kilmarnock. Nicholson earned three full caps for Scotland, all won during his time with Dunfermline.\n\nBorn in Dumfries, Nicholson watched matches of hometown club Queen of the South with his father. From playing youth football in Dumfries, he then joined Rangers. Limited appearances in Rangers' first team over several years saw him move on in 2000. Some records show that he scored once for Rangers in a UEFA Champions League qualifier against FC Haka in 1999, but Nicholson has stated that the goal should be credited to Jonatan Johansson.\n\nNicholson joined Dunfermline Athletic under the helm of Jimmy Calderwood and was a first team regular in what was the Pars' most successful period since the George Farm era. 2002-03 saw them finish 5th, and the following season they finished fourth as well as reaching the 2004 Scottish Cup Final, qualifying for a UEFA competition for the first time since 1970.\n\nNicholson's performances at East End Park saw him signed by Aberdeen for a fee of £250,000 in July 2005 and re-joined former boss Calderwood who had since moved to Pittodrie. The move paid dividends as his strong performances towards the end of the 2006–07 season saw him score vital goals. The most notable of these was the last minute equaliser against Hearts which all but clinched third place for Aberdeen, with only two matches of the season left at that stage.\n\nThe \"Dons\" qualified from their group in the 2007-08 UEFA Cup after a 4–0 win against F.C.

Nicholson returned from injury for the final game of the 2009-10 season only to limp off the field within 15 minutes suffering from an injury to the same leg. Nicholson returned to the side in January 2011 playing regularly for the remainder of the season. He was released by Preston at the end of the 2011-12 season.\n\nNicholson signed for Fleetwood Town for the 2012-13 season. He then moved to Kilmarnock in August 2013 on a short term contract.

He was given by Duke John and his father, King René, the charge of upholding by force of arms their claims on Catalonia.\n\nLouis XI, who had joined his troops to those of the princes of Anjou, attached Boffille to his own person, made him his chamberlain and conferred on him the vice-royalty of Roussillon and Cerdanya (1471), together with certain important lordships, among others the county of Castres, confiscated from James of Armagnac, duke of Nemours (1476), and the temporalities of the bishopric of Castres, confiscated from John of Armagnac. He also entrusted him with diplomatic negotiations with Flanders and England.\n\nIn 1480 Boffille married Marie d'Albret, sister of Alain I of Albret \"le Grand\", thus confirming the feudal position which the king had given him in the south.

{"id": "2334536", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2334536", "title": "Cry to Heaven", "text": "Cry to Heaven\n\nCry to Heaven is a novel by American author Anne Rice published by Alfred A. Knopf in 1982. Taking place in eighteenth-century Italy, it follows the paths of two unlikely collaborators: a Venetian noble and a maestro from Calabria, both trying to succeed in the world of the opera.\n\nSet in eighteenth-century Italy, \"Cry to Heaven\" focuses on two characters, peasant-born Guido Maffeo, who is castrated at the age of six to preserve his soprano voice, and fifteen-year-old Tonio Treschi, the last son of a noble family from the Republic of Venice, whose father, Andrea, is a member of the Council of Three of \"La Serenissima\". Although Guido becomes a star of the opera as a teenager, he loses his voice at eighteen, as many castrati did. After a suicide attempt, he becomes a music teacher in the Naples conservatorio. Tonio, on the other hand, learns that his older brother Carlo was exiled for embarrassing the family. Although Andrea attempts to cut Carlo out of the family, Carlo returns after Andrea's death, and plots to regain his original position. Revealing that Tonio is actually his illegitimate son, he has Tonio castrated, and sends him off with Guido to study in Naples.\n\nAlthough everyone in Venice is inclined to believe that Carlo was behind his castration, Tonio cannot accuse him of the crime because doing so would result in the extinction of the Treschi family. After some soul-searching, he decides to remain in Naples and study under Guido, holding off on revenge until after Carlo and his mother (also Carlo's lover and later wife) have children to ensure the family line.\n\nBy the power of Tonio's almost inhuman soprano voice, Guido is roused from his depression, and takes him as a star student. Tonio progresses in his lessons extremely quickly. Guido also has Tonio perform some of his original compositions, which begin to impress audiences at the \"conservatorio\".\n\nTonio, for his part, struggles to come to terms with his castrato status; in his own mind, he is \"less than a man\". At first, he finds it difficult even to associate with his fellow castrati. As time goes on, he has a love affair with another castrato boy, Domenico, and after Domenico leaves, with Guido himself. He comes to dominate the \"conservatorio\"—in addition to being a star student, he soon befriends all the boys his age, and becomes something of a leader and confidant.\n\nTonio also continues his studies in fencing and firearms, which, in Guido's words, make him into a \"hero\" to his fellow students, especially after, in self-defense, he kills a student who vowed to kill him. As he was raised to be a gentleman, and because he was castrated relatively late in life, he continues to act like a man, unlike the more effeminate poses of castrati boys. Despite the fact he is a castrato, even local noblemen come to respect him both as a sparring partner and as a friend.\n\nHowever, Guido and others need to scheme to get Tonio, finally, out of the conservatorio and onto the stage. After his debut, Guido and Tonio travel to Rome for his operatic premiere. There he gains the patronage of a powerful cardinal, Calvino, and befriends a powerful count from Florence, di Stefano. Although he is almost booed off the stage for upstaging the operatic star Bettichino, he proves a great success, and both he and Guido have a bright futures in front of themselves. Tonio even becomes lovers with an English noblewoman and widow, Christina, seemingly restoring him to his former status.\n\nNonetheless, Tonio is unable to break free of the desire for revenge against Carlo. After having two children by Carlo, Tonio's mother, Marianna, dies. Soon afterwards—and before his Mardi Gras opera performance—hitmen sent by Carlo try to kill him. Against the wishes of all his friends, Tonio vows to return in time for an Easter opera, then disappears.\n\nIn Venice, Carlo has become a pathetic, alcoholic wreck. Disguised as a woman (a trick he learned for the opera), Tonio succeeds in \"seducing\" his father and capturing him. Intoxicated, Carlo not only curses ever coming back to Venice, but also wants to take Tonio's place, finding the city decadent and confining. Although he promises never to try and hurt Tonio again, he attempts to kill him the second he has the opportunity. In response, Tonio finally kills Carlo. He then returns to his friends, at last able to fully pursue his life.\n\nWith the completion of her second novel, \"The Feast of All Saints\" (1979), American author Anne Rice started her research for another, which she planned to set during the French Revolution with a violinist as its protagonist. Rice, however, changed her mind when she read about castrated opera singers and a Naples conservatory during her research, and became interested in them, seeing potential in how the Italian society viewed them as less than men, yet flocked to their opera performances. Rice did historical research for \"Cry to Heaven\": W.J. Henderson's \"Early History of Singing\" provided the foundation for how Guido taught singing, and in Vernon Lee's \"Studies in the 18th Century in Italy\", she read about \"Achilles en Sciro\" by Metastasio, which she later used for Tonio's debut in Rome. A 1972 recording \"\"Baroque Venice\", Music of Gabrieli, Bassano, Monteverdi\" directly inspired Tonio's musical experience at San Marco, while Alessandro Scarlatti's \"The Garden of Love\" inspired the duet of Tonio and Christina—the only part of the novel written to music. For the settings, she relied on her travels to Venice and Rome a few years earlier, and read the diary of German author Johann Wolfgang von Goethe detailing his trip to Naples, although she found a lack of material on the conservatories.\n\nRice wrote the first two hundred pages of \"Cry to Heaven\" as a contrast to Tonio's life as a castrato for the rest of the novel. She quickened her narrative pacing to suit her audience, in an attempt to remedy an issue that she felt had hindered the success of \"The Feast of All Saints\" (1979). Parts of her largely unpublished novella \"Nicholas and Jean\" (1963) were incorporated into \"Cry to Heaven\", among them a female role being played by a man. With her previous novel's failure to become a bestseller and her Simon & Schuster editor's lack of interest in \"Cry to Heaven\", Rice \neventually returned to Alfred A. Knopf, the publisher of her debut novel \"Interview with the Vampire\" (1976); at the time, two-thirds of the novel had been completed. She struggled with deciding where to end the novel. \"Cry to Heaven\" was published in October 1982. In retrospective, she felt that the novel had very little spontaneity, was too \"calculated\", and that the historical aspect of it took on too much importance, as in \"The Feast of All Saints\". After its publication, Rice made an effort to return to the spontaneity with which that she had written \"Interview with the Vampire\".\n\n\"Cry to Heaven\" sold fewer hardcover copies than \"The Feast of All Saints\", which had sold fewer than 20,000 copies in hardcover. \"Cry to Heaven\", like \"The Feast of All Saints\", did not reach the same level of success that \"Interview with the Vampire\" did.\n\n\"Cry to Heaven\" received mixed reviews. \"The Washington Post\"s Joseph McLellan called it \"an absorbing look at a fascinating and little-known world.\" McLellan wrote that Rice's historical research, writing, and subject matter of opera and castrati distinguished it from other historical novels. Alice Hoffman, in her review for \"The New York Times Book Review\", described it as \"bold and erotic, laced with luxury, sexual tension, music\". However, she felt that Rice falsely increased narrative tension through \"melodramatic dialogue, odd elongation of words, [and] a confusing switch of narrative focus\". Michiko Kakutani of \"The New York Times\" called it a \"dark, humid melodrama\" and enjoyed the historical details and Tonio's \"emotional development\", although she wrote that the secondary characters were two-dimensional and superficial. Additionally, she stated that Rice's frequent foreshadowing and the clichéd and emotionally overwrought dialogue detracted from the novel's appeal. Writing for \"The Los Angeles Times Book Review\", Pat Hilton wrote that, excepting the conclusion, \"Cry to Heaven\" was \"satisfying\", and felt that its questions about masculinity were contemporary.\n\n\n"}

It is from Milan and from Monza.\n\nThe city was founded by the Romans on the banks of the river Molgora.\n\nA hostel at the site was founded in 1052, just outside the walls of medieval Vimercate, offering refuge and assistance to travellers and pilgrims. In the first half of the 13th century Franciscan friars from the nearby monastery in Oreno, traditionally believed to have been visited by St Francis himself, and founded the new Franciscan monastery under the \"Custody of Monza\". During the 13th century it increased in importance and was occupied by Lectors and Maestri.\n\nIn one of the frescoes in the convent is an ornament (circa 1311) showing the coats of arms of the Visconti and Della Torre families. The date is the time when a truce between the two families was signed on Epiphany of that year. The truce between the two Milanese families was guaranteed by Henry VII, Holy Roman Emperor. In 1456 Francesco Sforza, Duke of Milan, provided a special grant with an annual offering of fifty florins, founding the \"Cappellania di San Francesco\" (Chapter of the Chapel of Saint Francis) in the church.\n\nIn 1798 the monastery, suppressed by the Cisalpine Republic, was sold in 1799 by the Feudal Mayor of Vimercate, Dr Giuseppe Banfi. He conceded the use of the monastery to the six remaining friars, supporting them for life. Afterwards he transformed the monastery into a residence. Since then the Banfi family has owned the site.\n\nIn different areas of the monastery there are some fragments of frescos, which, even if quite small, make it possible to distinguish two subsequent attempts at decorating the church during the first half of the fourteenth century, evidence of the prestige of the monastery in that period.\n\n\nThe area of Oreno has maintained its medieval look with an 11th-century monastery, Saint Michael's Church and the stately homes Villa Gallarati Scotti and Villa Borromeo.\n\nThe town has more new developments such as the \"Torri Bianche\" skyscrapers which host a 16 screen cinema, a shopping arcade and many county offices plus the new Central Bus Station designed by Mario Botta in 1998, which serves the area and has many facilities.\n\nOn the east side of the city rises the \"Centro Scolastico Omnicomprensivo\", a scholastic centre, which is known for the quality and high standards of the \"Licei\" (High Schools). Particularly renowned is the Scientific and Classic Liceo \"Antonio Banfi\". Within the communal borders there are many parks, used for concerts and shows.\n\nVimercate received the honorary title of city with a presidential decree on June 28, 1950.\n\n\n"}

The land was donated by Edward Harkness, who also donated much of the cost of the original buildings. Built specifically to house a medical school and Presbyterian Hospital, it was the first academic medical center in the world. Formerly known as the Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center (CPMC), the name change followed the 1997 formation of New York-Presbyterian Hospital, a merger of two medical centers each affiliated with an Ivy League university: Columbia-Presbyterian with Columbia University, and the New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center, with Cornell University's Weill Cornell Medical College.\n\nThe Medical and Graduate Education Building was designed by architects Diller Scofidio + Renfro and Gensler with structural engineer Leslie E.

It is located in Sophia Gardens on the River Taff. It is home to Glamorgan County Cricket Club and is listed as an international Test cricket venue.\n\nThe venue is home to Glamorgan County Cricket Club which has played its home matches there since 24 May 1967, after moving away from Cardiff Arms Park. A 125-year lease of the ground was acquired in 1995, with the previous leaseholders, Cardiff Athletic Club, moving its cricket section (Cardiff Cricket Club) to the Diamond Ground in Whitchurch. Beside the cricket ground is the large sports hall complex of the Sport Wales National Centre. Cardiff Corinthians F.C. have previously used the area for football. In July 2007, Glamorgan cricketer Mike Powell was granted his wish to have a rib, removed during surgery, buried at the ground.\n\nSophia Gardens has been an international cricket venue since 20 May 1999, when it played host to the 1999 Cricket World Cup match between Australia and New Zealand. From 2001 to 2012, the ground was a regular venue for One Day Internationals, hosting nine matches in 12 years, but it was not until 2006 that it hosted its first England match, the first match of the series against Pakistan on 30 August 2006. In 2012, the ground was named as one of three venues for the 2013 ICC Champions Trophy, along with The Oval and Edgbaston; it hosted five matches, including the opener between India and South Africa on 6 June 2013, and the semi-final between India and Sri Lanka on 20 June. The ground also hosted two Twenty20 Internationals between England and Pakistan in September 2010, and it is due to host another against Australia in August 2015.\n\nOn 11 April 2008, the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) announced that the venue would host a series of major Test matches over the next four years. It would host its first Test match on 8 July 2009 as the opening match of an Ashes series between England and Australia. This made Sophia Gardens the 100th Test match venue. In July 2011, the ECB stripped the ground of its right to host the 2012 West Indies Test because of Glamorgan's late payment of the £2.5 million fee it owed for hosting the 2011 Sri Lanka Test. The ground was originally set to host a Test match against New Zealand in 2013, but this was given up in exchange for the 2013 Champions Trophy. The ground was chosen as the venue for the first Test of the 2015 Ashes series.\n\nThe ground was one of 11 venues for the 2019 Cricket World Cup. It was host for four group matches.\n\nThe £9.4 million cost to redevelop stadium was funded by with approximately half (£4.5 million) being provided in the form of a Cardiff Council loan. It is possible that the revamped stadium could host seven Test matches, nine One Day Internationals and two World Cup games up to 2028, injecting at least £50 million into the local economy. Construction of the redevelopment of Sophia Gardens began in April 2007, and the redeveloped stadium was first opened for competitive matches on 9 May 2008, when the Glamorgan Dragons played the Gloucestershire Gladiators in a Friends Provident Trophy match in which the Gladiators won by six wickets.\n\nOn 4 March 2008, Glamorgan Cricket Club announced a 10-year sponsorship deal with SWALEC, thought to be the biggest single sponsorship by a county cricket club, giving SWALEC the naming rights to the new stadium, worth in excess of £1.5 million over 10 years.\n\nIn June 2015, ahead of the First Test of the 2015 Ashes series, the stadium was renamed as simply \"The SSE SWALEC\" in reflection of the ownership of sponsors SWALEC by SSE plc. The new logo from June 2015 was designed to reflect the shape of the stadium. In April 2018 the stadium officially reverted to its traditional name of Sophia Gardens following the end of the sponsorship deal.\n\n\n"}

Set in World War II, the player flies a RAF Mosquito long range fighter-bomber equipped with rockets, bombs and a cannon. Missions include destroying German fighter planes, bombers, V-1 flying bombs, U-boats, and trains. In 1988 Atari Corporation released a version on cartridge styled for the then-new Atari XEGS.\n\n\"Ace of Aces\" received mixed reviews but went on to become one of the best-selling Commodore 64 video games published by Accolade.\n\nUpon launching the game a menu screen with options to either practice or partake in a proper mission is shown. If the player decides to do the practice mode, they can choose whether to do dog fight training or a U-Boat or train bombing. When playing the practice mode, the enemies are less aggressive. There are five different view options — the cockpit, both left and right wings, the navigational map and the bomb bay — which can be accessed by using the keyboard or by double-tapping the fire button and moving the joystick to the desired direction. When in missions, the player controls a twin-engined balsa RAF Mosquito which is already airborne, mitigating the necessity of takeoff. When starting a mission, the player chooses what supplies they wish to bring, but the more the player brings the lower the maximum speed of the plane. At the end of missions, landing is not required and points are awarded according to how many enemies are shot down, along with the amount of unused fuel, bombs, and missiles. When missions are completed, the player can choose to combine two or more of the other missions to produce a mashup.\n\nIn a 1987 \"Compute!\" article, \"Ace of Aces\" was noted as Accolade's second best selling Commodore 64 game. \"Compute!\", along with other reviewers, praised the graphics and sound in \"Ace of Aces\". 1991 and 1993 \"Computer Gaming World\" surveys of strategy and war games gave it one and a half stars out of five, calling it \"somewhat ahistorical\". In issue 20 of \"Zzap!64\", the reviewer said it was the best factual war simulation they had played. They compared it to \"Dambusters\" and said the playability in this was better. \"Desert Fox\" was also used as a comparison, which was referred to as \"sometimes unbelievable\". An article by the \"Computer and Video Games magazine\" published in 1986 said that it was another well-made and well-presented game by Accolade and continued to say that the action-packed gameplay would be able to keep \"even the most critical computer pilot busy for some time to come\". All four criteria were highly rated, with graphics getting a 10, along with sound, value and playability all getting an 8.\n\nThe graphics, along with sound and other features which were highly praised in the Commodore 64 version weren't so highly acclaimed in the Master System version. Chad Reinhardt for \"Defunct Games\" mentioned that \"Ace of Aces\" starts with potential but the poor controls and lack of ability to interact with the plane makes it forgettable. Reinhardt criticised how different the practise mode was from the main game and continued by adding how little help it actually helps when attempting missions. He gave the game a D+ overall. Other reviewers commented that there was no feeling of excitement when playing the Sega version. In a review on \"Kultboy\", it was given a rating of 20% and said the reasoning behind the low review was because the plane, which is meant to be a fighter plane, flies like a tanker. Comparatively the score for graphics the game was given was high, with 68%. \"Sega Pro\" gave the game a rating of 56 and praised the graphics when they were static but continued on to say they were impractical in-game.\n\nThe ZX Spectrum version was met with reviews disliking the complexity of changing controls and how it may be distracting during a dogfight. In issue 38 of \"Your Sinclair\", reviewers Ben Stone, Paul Sumner and Mike Dunn criticised the difficulty of the game and how the game only contains enough gameplay for a few days. Steve Panak, writing for \"ANALOG Computing\", preferred \"Ace of Aces\" to \"Infiltrator\" as an Atari 8-bit flight simulator.\n\n"}

The name is the feminine of \"Polish\" in the Italian language. The polacca was frequently seen in the Mediterranean. It had two or three single-pole masts, the three-masted vessels often with a lateen hoisted on the foremast (which was slanted forward to accommodate the large lateen yard) and a gaff or lateen on the mizzen mast. The mainmast was square-rigged after the European style. Special polaccas were used by Murat Reis, whose ships had lateen sails in front and fore-and-aft rig behind.\n\nSome polacca pictures show what appears to be a ship-rigged vessel (sometimes with a lateen on the mizzen) with a galley-like hull and single-pole masts. Thus, the term \"polacca\" seems to refer primarily to the masting and possibly the hull type as opposed to the type of rig used for the sails. Two-masted polaccas were referred to as brig-polaccas with square sails on both masts. Three-masted polaccas were called ship-polaccas or polacca-settees. \n\nCapt.

Selecting law as his profession, he studied at Oviedo, Ávila, and the University of Alcalá, before becoming a criminal judge at Seville in 1767.\n\nHis integrity and ability were rewarded in 1778 by a judgeship in Madrid, and in 1780 by appointment to the council of military orders. In the capital Jovellanos was a respected member of the literary and scientific societies; he was commissioned by the Society of Friends of the Country (Madrid's economic society) in 1787 to write his most well-known and influential work, \"Informe en el expediente de ley agraria\" (\"A report on the dossier of the Agrarian Law\"), a project which he completed in 1794, and published in 1795.\n\nIn his work on agrarian law, he called on the crown to eliminate the concentration of land ownership in the entailment of landed estates, ownership of land by the Catholic Church, and the existence of common lands unavailable to private ownership. In his view, Spain's wealth lay in its agricultural productivity which would allow its population to grow and prosper. In the eighteenth-century regime of land tenure, productivity was stifled by the latifundia (large landed estates) of the political elites and the Catholic Church as an institution, and common lands where there was no incentive for individuals to invest in its productivity. Jovellanos was influenced by Adam Smith's \"The Wealth of Nations\" (1776), which saw self-interest as the motivating force for economic activity. Jovellanos's recommendations were not implemented in Spain, but did influence thinking about agrarian land reform in the viceroyalty of New Spain by Bishop Manuel Abad y Queipo in the early nineteenth century before its independence in 1821. In turn, his writings influenced Alexander von Humboldt's thinking and writing on land issues in Mexico. Jovellanos also influenced thinking about agrarian land reform in Mexico in the late period of President Porfirio Díaz's regime by Andrés Molina Enríquez, who was the intellectual father of the article that empowered the State to expropriate land and other resources following the Mexican Revolution Constitution of 1917 \n\nInvolved in the disgrace of his friend, Francisco de Cabarrús, Jovellanos spent the years 1790 to 1797 in what amounted to exile at Gijón, engaged in literary work and in founding the Asturian institution for agricultural, industrial, social and educational reform throughout his native province.\n\nHe was summoned again to public life in 1797 when, turning down the post of ambassador to Russia, he accepted that of minister of grace and justice, under \"the prince of peace\", Godoy, whose attention had been directed to him by Cabarrus, then one of his favorites. Displeased with Godoy's policy and conduct, Melchor de Jovellanos combined with his colleague Saavedra to procure his dismissal. Godoy returned to power in 1798 and Jovellanos was again sent away to Gijón.\n\nTogether with Asturian intellectual colleagues such as González Posada, Caveda y Solares and his sister Xosefa Xovellanos, Jovellanos then focused on the study of Asturias. He intended to start several projects in the study of his native Asturian language, including an Academy of Asturian Language and an Asturian dictionary, but in 1801 he was imprisoned in Bellver Castle (Majorca) and was forced to put all his cultural projects on hold.\n\nThe Peninsular War, and the advance of the French into Spain, set him once more at liberty. Joseph Bonaparte, having gained the Spanish throne, made Jovellanos the most brilliant offers, but the latter rejected them all and joined the patriotic opposition. He became a member of the Supreme Central Junta and contributed to reorganize the Cortes Generales. This accomplished, the Junta at once fell under suspicion, and Jovellanos was involved in its fall. In 1811 he was enthusiastically welcomed to Gijon; but the approach of the French forced him to leave once more. The vessel in which he sailed was compelled by bad weather to put in at Vega de Navia (now known as Puerto de Vega) in Asturias, and there he died on November 27, 1811.\n\nPedro de Silva, the second President of the Principality of Asturias, is a direct descendant of Gaspar Melchor de Jovellanos through his mother, María Jesús Cienfuegos-Jovellanos Vigil-Escalera.\n\nJovellanos's prose works, especially those on political and legislative economy, constitute his real claim to literary fame. In them, depth of thought and clear-sighted sagacity are couched in a certain Ciceronian elegance and classical purity of style. Besides the \"Ley agraria\", he wrote \"Elogios\", and a most interesting set of diaries or travel journals (1790–1801, first published in 1915) reflecting his trips across Northern Spain. He also published several other political and social essays.\n\nHis poetical works comprises a tragedy, \"Pelayo\", the comedy \"El delincuente honrado\", satires, and miscellaneous pieces, including a translation of the first book of \"Paradise Lost\".\n\nEnlightenment in Spain\n\n\n"}

One of the members who established the Kibbutz was Ami Saull, who was born in Manhattan 1932, and was nephew of Israel Galili and father of the film maker Dror Shaul (Operation Grandma) (Sweet Mad). Kissufim is part of the Shalom bloc of Israeli settlement meant to secure Israel's southern border with the Gaza Strip from the numerous Palestinian Fedayeen infiltrations. The national government has recently financed building additions to each home which also serve as bomb shelters, with reinforced concrete.\n\nTell Jemmeh is a major archaeological site located about 5 kilometers east-northeast of Kissufim, on the southern bank of HaBesor Stream.\n\nThe kibbutz economy largely relies on its milk production, chicken farming, a citrus grove which is being phased out, an avocado orchard, and renting out land to the Israel Defense Forces. Avocados are the primary income and Kissufim is one of the only producers of Avocados in Israel during the summer months. Income from land rented from the IDF helps cover the pension costs and other agricultural land is managed by neighboring villages, with profits split.\n\nAt one point it had a factory that produced plastic frames for glasses and raised chinchillas for their fur. Both endeavours were economic failures. The village also houses an archaeological museum (named after Ami Saull, father of Dror Shaul) displaying artifacts found in the surrounding area. Kissufim is currently undergoing a process of privatization in which homes will soon be owned by individuals rather than the collective.\n\nThe nearby crossing into the Gaza Strip, named for the kibbutz, was the main route for traffic into the Gush Katif Israeli settlement bloc. It was permanently closed to inbound Israeli civilian traffic on 15 August 2005 as part of the disengagement plan. The last Israeli soldier left the Gaza strip and closed the gate at dawn of 12 September 2005, completing the Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip.\n\n\n\n"}

He became chemist and apothecary to the dukes of Lauenburg, and then to the Elector of Saxony, Johann Georg II, who put him in charge of the royal laboratory at Dresden. Intrigues engineered against him caused him to resign this position in 1677, and for a time he lectured on chemistry at Annaberg and Wittenberg. Invited to Berlin by Frederick William, in 1679 he became director of the laboratory and glass works of Brandenburg. In 1688 the king of Sweden, Charles XI, brought him to Stockholm, ennobling him under the name \"von Löwenstern-Kunckel\" in 1693 and making him a member of the Bergskollegium, the Board of Mines.

{"id": "2334657", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2334657", "title": "Moxy (band)", "text": "Moxy (band)\n\nMoxy is a Canadian hard rock and heavy metal band, formed in Toronto, Ontario, in 1974, from previous members of the rock group Leigh Ashford – which included singer Douglas \"Buzz\" Shearman (former teen singer of Sherman & Peabody), alongside Greg Godovitz of Fludd & Goddo, and Gil Moore (later of Triumph), Earl Johnson (former member of King Biscuit Boy), Bill Wade (former member of Outlaw Music and Brutus under the alias Hally Hunter that also included Gino Scarpelli of Goddo) and Terry Juric, as Leigh Ashford. The group changed its name to Moxy in late 1974. This name change was accompanied by a change in the group's sound. Buddy Caine, a former bandmate of Earl Johnson, was added to the group in 1975.\n\nMoxy toured extensively in Canada before having a hit in late 1975 with \"Can't You See I'm A Star\". Moxy then toured the United States on the strength of their radio airplay. Markets in which the band was very popular included Ontario, Chicago, St. Louis, Detroit, and San Antonio. Joe Anthony, \"the Godfather of Rock\" in San Antonio on KISS-FM was largely responsible for the popularity of the band in south Texas and helped bring about their first headline appearance in the U.S. in 1977, appearing with AC/DC as their opening act.\n\nDespite the death of Joe Anthony, the Moxy-Texas connection has continued into the present with Moxy's hits like \"Can't You See I'm A Star\", \"Moon Rider\", and \"Sail On Sail Away\". \"Midnight Flight\", \"I'll Set You on Fire\" and \"Are You Ready\" remain on the daily rotation at many Texas radio stations.\n\nMany of the guitar solos on the band's debut album were performed by guest session musician Tommy Bolin, who had previously been the lead guitarist for The James Gang and later replaced Ritchie Blackmore in Deep Purple.\n\nIn the spring of 1974, Buzz Shearman joined up with Earl Johnson, Bill Wade, and bassist Kim Fraser. Still calling themselves Leigh-Ashford, they made their first appearance on the music scene in October 1974 at Scarborough's notorious rock club \"The Knob Hill Hotel\". Shortly thereafter, Fraser was replaced by Terry Juric on the recommendation of Earl Johnson and the group changed its name to MOXY. Their first single release was a trial run of \"Can't You See I'm A Star\", which was distributed by Yorkville Records. The promising sound of the single received heavy radio support from CHUM (AM) in Toronto and led to the band's signing of a contract with Polydor Records of Canada in December 1974. The Polydor Records contract was mainly due to the popularity and success of the former band, Leigh Ashford, and to Buzz Shearman's reputation.\n\nThe independently produced self-titled album, \"MOXY\", also known as the Black Album, was recorded over two weeks in early 1975. Mark Smith of Bachman–Turner Overdrive fame acted as co-producer for the album. While in Van Nuys, California at Sound City Studios recording this album, session guitarist Tommy Bolin was in the studio next door. Bolin was so impressed with the no-nonsense, to-the-bones sound of Moxy that when asked by the band's manager Roland Paquin to fill in, he said yes. Earl Johnson was actually supposed to have done all the guitar parts, but got into a disagreement with the producer and was consequently tossed out of the studio. Roland Paquin knew Bolin from when he was a road manager for The James Gang. After the Moxy sessions, Bolin continued to work on his first solo album \"Teaser\", and later that year got the call from David Coverdale to join Deep Purple. Having heard the impact of the twin guitars, Moxy then headed back to Toronto in search of a rhythm guitarist who would free up Earl Johnson to play the material on tour that had been added to the songs in the studio by Tommy Bolin. Buddy Caine, a friend of Earl Johnson's, became the needed second guitarist, allowing the group to then hit the road with a Canadian tour that included Ontario, Quebec and the Maritimes, where the group mostly played small venues.\n\nThe first album found its way to hard rock stations in the southern US. In the winter of 1975, \"Can' t You See I'm A Star\" and \"Moon Rider\" were receiving heavy radio support from KMAC/KISS in San Antonio, Texas. Tommy Bolin's contribution would get some much needed attention for the album in the U.S. media, even though Bolin always downplayed his involvement. Moxy renegotiated a new contract with Polydor of Canada for distribution in affiliation with Mercury Records. Both labels were owned by PolyGram Records at the time, who reissued the self-titled debut album in North America and worldwide in 1976. In the spring of 1976, \"Fantasy\" and \"Sail On Sail Away\" hit the top 20 charts on KISS-FM radio in San Antonio, Texas. KISS-FM disc jockey Joe Anthony had the freedom to play the album in its entirety on many occasions through the late 1970s.\n\nAfter a few years of touring Moxy went from a bar band to headline concert attraction in Canada. \"Moxy II\" was recorded in the band's hometown of Toronto at Sound Stage studio with famed Aerosmith producer Jack Douglas. This was a year after the first album for Canadian fans, but just three months after the reissued copy of Moxy I was released in the U.S. \"Moxy II\" received international press coverage for the band. Most reviews predicted success for the band and comparisons were made to Aerosmith, Rush and Deep Purple. \"Moxy II\" was also highly acclaimed on its release by Geoff Barton of the UK music publication \"Sounds\", who made the album available to its readers for the special price of only £1.50. Geoff Barton would later refer to Moxy as the Canadian Zeppelin.\n\nIn the fall of 1976, Moxy was touring throughout Ontario, Quebec and the Maritimes. They then toured Texas as the opening act for Black Sabbath and Boston, except at the new Convention Center arena in San Antonio 24 October 1976, where Boston was the opening act. ref name=\"Fink2017\"/> 17 November 1976, \"Take it Or Leave It\", reached No. 14 on the Top 30 CHUM AM in Toronto and in Texas \"Midnight Flight\", \"Cause There's Another\" and \"Take it or Leave It\" received heavy radio support. Moxy then toured California, Illinois and Missouri. \"Cause There's Another\" reached No. 16 on CHUM (AM) radio on 26 March 1977.\n\nMarch 1977, after touring non-stop since the release of \"Moxy II\", Moxy went back to the studio in Toronto to record another album with Jack Douglas producing again. The result was \"Ridin' High\" which once more contained all-original material written by the band members with a harder and heavy sound than the first two albums. The album received good reviews, with nomination of a Juno Award in 1977 for most promising group of the year. However airplay was limited as FM radio stations in Canada and northern U.S. shifted to softer rock. Nevertheless, in the southern U.S. and Europe, \"Are You Ready\", \"Ridin' High\" and \"I'll Set You on Fire\" received heavy radio support.\n\nOn 27 July 1977, Joe Anthony brought Moxy to Texas for their first headline appearance in the U.S. in Austin at Armadillo World Headquarters. The next night in San Antonio at the Municipal Auditorium and on 29 July in Corpus Christi, Texas, at Ritz Music Hall, with AC/DC as the opening act for all three dates. Moxy went on to tour throughout California, Illinois, Missouri, Michigan with bands like Styx, The Ramones, Hall & Oates, Rainbow, The Runaways and Trooper, ending the tour with a headline show at Massey Hall in Toronto.\n\nThe hard touring and rigorous schedule was beginning to take its toll on the band by late 1977. Most of the band members had been touring since the late 1960s in other bands before Moxy was formed. Living a life filled with sex, drugs and rock and roll, the band had been slowly self-destructing for years. Buzz Shearman had developed vocal cord problems and singer-soundman Brian Maxim (singer on \"Moxy V\") had to be called in to hit the high notes off-stage. Shearman decided to leave in late 1977 after the \"Ridin' High\" tour, due to personality conflicts and to seek medical attention for his vocal cords and drinking problem.\n\nMichael Rynoski, who later changed his name to Mike Reno and played with Loverboy, replaced Buzz Shearman and made his musical debut on Moxy's next album. Bill Wade had also left the band in early 1977 and had been replaced by Danny Bilan.\n\nDanny Bilan would later join Wild T and the Spirit after turning up on Hanover Fist's album \"Hungry Eyes\". Moxy's new album's title track \"Under the Lights\" and \"High School Queen\" made the charts in Canada, but the album lacked the punch of the band's earlier works instead opting for a laid-back sound. Moxy then toured across Canada playing many festivals including the Canadian World Music Festival with Aerosmith, Johnny Winter, Ted Nugent and Triumph but the band no longer garnered a strong response in terms of either record sales or audiences that it had with Shearman as the vocalist. Shearman formed his own band called \"Buzz Saw\" with ex-Christmas guitarist Bob Bulger and drummer Frank Russell. Earl Johnson had left Moxy in the summer of 1978 just after the album's release and was replaced by Woody West who was a former member of the big band version of The Stampeders and a former member of Brutus.\nShearman rejoined Moxy in late 1979, touring Canada and Texas with Buddy, Terry, and Danny alongside new guitarist Doug MacAskill. Terry Juric had appeared on Thor's 1978 album \"Keep The Dogs Away\" during Moxy's down time and then appeared on pop-rocker Stanley Frank's 1980 album \"Play It Til It Hurts\". Bill Wade during this time performed on The Cry's 1980 album \"Wispear\" and then formed the band Bongo Furies with fellow Canadian rocker Gino Scarpelli and bassist Terry McKeowen. In March 1980, Buzz was a candidate to replace the deceased Bon Scott in AC/DC but because his recurring vocal cord problems would not allow him to tour extensively, AC/DC band members ultimately decided on ex-Geordie singer Brian Johnson. In 1982, Buzz, Earl and Bill helped fellow Canadian singer-songwriter Lee Aaron on her debut album, \"The Lee Aaron Project\". By 1983, Buzz was working a day job at Shaw Industries, just barely holding Moxy together while shopping around for a new record deal. Buzz died in a motorcycle accident, on 16 June 1983, at the age of 33, just north of Toronto.\n\nMoxy's remaining original members reunited soon after Buzz's death to put on a benefit concert and release a retrospective package, with proceeds earmarked for Valerie (Buzz's widow) and Jesse Shearman (son). The retrospective package released by Pacemaker Records, called \"A Tribute to Buzz Shearman\", features three previously unreleased Moxy songs with Buzz on vocals: \"Highway\", \"Eyeballs\" and \"Trouble\". Buddy Caine, Terry Juric, Danny Bilan and Brian Maxin (Moxy's 1970s backup singer) later formed the band Voodoo. The Buddy Caine Band would later be formed by Buddy, who wrote a song in honor of Buzz called \"Feed The Fire\" that was released on the 1994 album . Earl Johnson soldiered on, recording songs like \"Heaven On Heels\", \"Body Contact\" and \"Killer on the Loose\" with Tom Griffin (co-writer of \"Candy Delight\" on \"Moxy V\"), Howie Warden, and Danny \"Coke\" Colonello playing local Toronto bars and night clubs like El Mocambo, Gasworks, and Larry's Hideaway. Bill Wade would later show up on Thor's 1997 album \"An-THOR-Logy\", recorded in 1979.\n\nIn 1999, Bill Wade gets Moxy back together into his home studio, with Earl Johnson and Buddy Caine after a 20-year recording gap, to produce Moxy's fifth studio album, \"Moxy V\". The new album returned them to the hard rock sound of the first three albums. New vocalist Brian Maxim (former member of Stumbling Blind and The Passing Fancy), who was considered a true member of Moxy, as Brian sung back-ups for \"Buzz\" on tour back in 1977, worked with Buddy Caine and Terry Juric in the band Voodoo and worked with \"Buzz\" at Shaw Industries in the early 1980s. The album includes \"Working Man\" (an early tune by Billy Wade), \"Yuccatan Man\"\" (unreleased Buddy Caine composition from the early Moxy days) and \"Walking on the Wild Side\" (unreleased Earl Johnson composition from the early Moxy days). Bill Wade grew very ill shortly after \"Moxy V\" was released. Unable to continue, a replacement for Bill became necessary and a bass player was also needed. Bill's replacement was Kim Hunt who was known in the Toronto area as a former member of Zon. Bill would succumb to cancer on 27 July 2001, at the age of 53.\n\nFor their 25 anniversary Moxy played in San Antonio alongside fellow special guests Saxon in 2000 again in 2004 with Budgie and Michael Schenker (Scorpions and UFO) at the annual Legs Diamond bash in the Sunken Garden Theater to the delight of 6,000 fans. The popularity that Moxy held in Europe prompted the band's first tour outside North America in 2001, accompanied by a new CD cover of \"Moxy V\" unique for the European fans.\n\nOn 12 January 2001, Moxy appeared at the legendary El Mocambo club in Toronto. This appearance was video recorded but has still not been officially released as a DVD. World Studios however has released one song from the performance for public viewing – World Studios – \"Time To Move On\".\n\nLate 2001 saw Moxy move to a new label Bullseye Records of Canada and release the greatest hits live album \"Raw\", which was recorded in Pickering, Ontario at a secret warehouse performance to an invitation-only audience. Bullseye also re-released \"Moxy V\" in North America with remastered and re-edited songs and a new track sequence supervised by Earl Johnson at Soho Studios in Toronto by engineer Glenn Belcher.\n\nBrian Maxim left the band in 2003 and his replacement was Alex Machin who fronted A Foot in Coldwater, a successful 1970s band from the Toronto area. Alex had also fronted Champion on one album released in 1984. For the 30th anniversary of Moxy's classic debut album in 2005, Moxy played the \"Voyageur Days Festival\" in Mattawa, Ontario, with Canadian classic rockers Chilliwack, Toronto, Trooper, Goddo, Killer Dwarfs and Ray Lyell. On 26 August 2005, Moxy performed \"Can't You See I'm A Star\" and \"Cause There's Another\", the band's two biggest Canadian hits, live on Citytv in Toronto. In December 2008, guitarist Buddy Caine retired to spend more time at home with his family.\n\nFor Moxy's 40th anniversary a new band was assembled by founding member Earl Johnson. A new album and DVD titled \"40 Years And Still Riding High\" was released in 2015 and included Juno award-winning vocalist Nick Walsh, Alexis Von Kraven (drums), Rob Robbins (guitar, background vocals) and Rod Albon (bass guitar). Moxy signed with Perris Records for the North American and South America release. In the UK and Europe the CD and DVD was released on the Escape Music label. The first pressing was a Limited Edition of 2,000 copies and includes the Live DVD in a triple CD boxset.\n\nMoxy's first three albums with Buzz Shearman remain Moxy's best known and most commercially successful, with \"Moxy I\" on vinyl being especially sought-after by die-hard Bolin fans. Their compilations \"A Tribute to Buzz Shearman\", and \"Raw\" live have sold well over the years, especially in Texas. The songs \"Train\" and \"Time to Move On\" appear on \"The Ultimate: The Best of Tommy Bolin\" box set in 1989. In 2004, the song \"Cause There's Another\" appear on a compilation album of Canada's most popular rock and roll acts called \"When Cancon Rocked!\"\n\nAlso in 2004, Moxy made the KZEP FM (San Antonio, Texas) \"Top 104 Best Groups of All Time\" at number 87, ahead of Quiet riot, Mötley Crüe, Whitesnake, Queensrÿche, and Iron Maiden. \"Can't You See I'm A Star\" appeared in the Pierre Trudeau mini-movie (approximately 40 minutes into part two) that was released in 2005. In 2006, Moxy was featured in an article that included band's like Ram Jam and Tucky Buzzard called \"Top 6 Classic Rock Bands You Never Knew You Didn't Know\" written by Dave White.\n\n2009 saw the release of a song endorsed by Moxy and Valerie Shearman honoring Buzz Shearman, written and composed by Canadian musician Don Coleman titled \"LOUD HARD FAST & WILD\".\nMoxy's original catalogue of albums were again available starting in the mid-1990s when Valerie Shearman oversaw the release of all of Moxy's back catalogue on CD through Pacemaker Records, and again in the mid-2000s this time through Unidisc Music Inc. An unreleased Moxy track with Buzz Sherman on vocals was unearthed in 2009. The song titled \"You Can't Stop the Music in Me\" was released to radio and online retailers on Buzz's birthday, 8 March 2009. The song was co-written with Billy Wade, and recorded in 1981 with his Moxy bandmates. A retrospective DVD with the same title was released in November 2009 covering the early years of Moxy.\n\nNote: Buddy Caine is listed on the album \"Moxy\", but did not join the band until after the album was finished.\n\n\n\n\n"}

He played in Major League Baseball for the Chicago Cubs, Montreal Expos, Toronto Blue Jays, Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, Atlanta Braves, and Chicago White Sox. He has been a starter, reliever and closer during his baseball career.\n\nDowns was born and raised in Louisville, Kentucky. He attended Pleasure Ridge Park High School, where he was selected as Kentucky's Mr. Baseball. He was selected by the Atlanta Braves in the 12th round of the 1994 Major League Baseball draft, but he opted to attend the University of Kentucky instead of signing a professional contract. In 1996, he played collegiate summer baseball in the Cape Cod Baseball League for the Yarmouth-Dennis Red Sox. At the end of his junior season at Kentucky, he was selected by the Chicago Cubs in 3rd round (94th overall) of the 1997 Major League Baseball draft.\n\nDowns made his debut for the Williamsport Cubs, of the New York–Penn League a Low-A affiliate of the Cubs. He made his way through the minor leagues and eventually made the Cubs roster for opening day . Between the time Downs started in the Cubs' system and when he made the major leagues, he was briefly in the Minnesota Twins system as he was sent by the Cubs to the Twins in November 1998 as a player to be named later from an earlier trade that had brought Mike Morgan back to the Cubs for a second stint. Downs was traded back to the Cubs by the Twins in May 1999 as part of a trade that also saw Rick Aguilera go to Chicago.\n\nDowns made his major league debut for the Chicago Cubs on April 9, . he finished with a 4–3 record with an ERA of 5.17.\n\nAt the MLB trading deadline for the 2000 season, July 31, 2000, Downs was traded by the Cubs to the Expos for Rondell White.\n\nOn June 11, 2004, while playing for the Edmonton Trappers, the Triple-A affiliate of the Expos, Downs threw a no-hitter against the Las Vegas 51s.

His official position was First Vice Minister of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, to which he was promoted (from just Vice Minister) immediately before the Korean Workers' Party Conference of 28 September 2010. He is the leading figure in international talks over the country's nuclear weapons program, including the six-party talks in Beijing.\n\nIn February 2007, North Korea agreed, with the help of Kim Kye Gwan, to disarm their nuclear program. This involved shutting down its nuclear reactor and eventually dismantling its atomic weapons program, just four months after the communist state shocked the world by testing a nuclear bomb. Kim Kye Gwan is North Korea's leading spokesperson and head negotiator in matters concerning the North's nuclear ambitions, and will most likely enter the limelight for his role in facilitating North Korea's Nuclear Disarmament deal struck in February.\n\nKim met with Christopher R. Hill, the U.S. assistant secretary of state, when Hill visited Pyongyang in June 2007, afterwards announcing that North Korea would promptly shut down its Yongbyon nuclear facility.\n\nHe was also present at the airport to greet Bill Clinton on his arrival in North Korea for a visit in August 2009 concerning the release of two American journalists imprisoned by North Korea.\n\nHe was also present at the airport to greet Jimmy Carter on his arrival in North Korea for a visit in August 2010 concerning the release of an American teacher imprisoned by North Korea.\n\nKim was appointed First Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs in September 2010, replacing Kang Sok-ju.\n\nIn December 2010, Kim invited the serving Governor of the U.S. State of New Mexico, Bill Richardson, to North Korea in an unofficial capacity. He met Richardson upon his arrival in Pyongyang on December 16, where Richardson told reporters that his \"objective is to see if we can reduce the tension on the Korean peninsula, that is my objective. I am going to have a whole series of talks with North Korean officials here and I look forward to my discussions\", he said.\n\nIn July 2011, he traveled to New York City in order to meet with U.S. officials in the Department of State, to encourage recent moves toward possible peace talks. Private food aid shipments (of flour, meant for starving North Korean children) through the Demilitarized Zone have begun again, though South Korea will likely not resume official, government-based food aid shipments — or de-nuclearization and peace talks — until North Korea shows some sign of apologizing for the sinking of the Cheonan and its most recent nuclear test. So far, North Korea — which is still under sanctions for pursuing nuclear weapons (it was regarded as a state sponsor of terrorism and was one of three countries in President George W. Bush's so-called \"Axis of Evil\" with Iraq and Iran) — has refused to do so. These incidents, and others, have together drastically raised tensions between the two countries within the last two years since talks broke down in 2009 (the North and South are technically still in a state of war, having only signed a truce, and not a formal peace treaty). However, additional motives to sign a deal are the ongoing and worsening food shortages, as well as the upcoming centennial of the birth of North Korea's founder and \"Great Leader\", Kim Il-sung, the father of the second leader, Kim Jong-il.\n\nIn May 2018, he s involved with the discussion about nuclear disarmament. \n\n\n"}

Yung died due to gas inhalation at the age of 26, during the peak of her career.\n\nYung was born in Hong Kong on 7 May 1959 to a civil service family as an only child. Her childhood was relatively uneventful until the death of her father when she was aged 7.\n\nAt 15, Yung left Hong Kong for England in late 1974 to join her mother who had immigrated to the United Kingdom (TVB K100 Feature Interview, 1985). Yung, her mother and a family friend, whom Yung considered her \"uncle\", first moved to Barkingside, Ilford, near London. Together as a family, they later settled in Histon, a small village in Cambridge. There, the adults operated a small fish and chips shop where Yung helped out during the weekends.\n\nWhile in Hong Kong, Yung attended Rosaryhill School (located at Stubbs Road in Hong Kong), where she had completed her primary and some of her secondary education through Form 4 (TVB K100, 1985). She continued with her GCE O levels at a secondary school in Cambridge. After the completion of her 'O' levels, she was admitted to a 2-year foundations program at the Anglia Ruskin University (CCAT). Upon the completion of this program, she went to London to study textile design at the Central School of Art and Design. She spent 4 years at this school (TVB K100 Feature Interview, 1985).\n\nYung returned to Hong Kong and joined the Miss Hong Kong pageant in 1982, in which she was awarded 8th place. After the pageant, she was offered an acting contract by TVB. She made her acting debut in 1982, in a Cantonese wuxia series named \"Sup Sam Mui\" also known as \"The Legend of the Unknowns\" set in the Qing dynasty, co-starring Kent Tong and Simon Yam in which Yung played a Manchu princess, Princess Sheung (TVB K100 Feature Interview, 1985). This was the TV drama that shot her into the limelight. Although Yung played a relatively minor role in this drama, she managed to gain TVB's confidence to cast her in what would become the drama (\"The Legend of the Condor Heroes\") that would make her a household name in Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, Vietnam and other countries with sizeable especially Cantonese-speaking populations in the 1980s. Her popularity persists through present day due to her lead role in \"The Legend of the Condor Heroes\" (TVB K100 Feature Interview, 1985).\n\nYung's most famous TVB swordplay series was \"The Legend of the Condor Heroes\" in which she portrayed the character Wong Yung. TVB made several costumed/period dramas in the 1980s based on famous martial arts swordplay novels by Louis Cha. Cha's \"The Legend of the Condor Heroes\", has been adapted numerous times to TV dramas and film, but none has attained a popularity as the one made by TVB in 1983. The innocent swordsman, Kwok Ching was played by Felix Wong. The cast in this edition also featured Michael Miu, Sharon Yeung, Patrick Tse and Louise Lee.\n\nYung's other TV dramas included \"The Foundation\", \"The Man in the Middle\", \"The Fearless Duo\", \"United We Stand\", \"The New Adventures of Chor Lau-heung\", \"The Rough Ride\" and \"The Battlefield\".\n\nYung was found unconscious due to gas inhalation in her apartment on Broadcast Drive, Kowloon on the morning of 14 May 1985 (Spiritus Temporis, 2007). According to her friend and actor (who was rumoured to have begun courting Yung), Stephen Chow Sai-lung, Yung had called him on the night of 13 May 1985. Chow asserted that she was troubled by her failing relationship with Kent Tong Chun-yip. After hanging up, Chow was concerned and he went to her home. However, he could not gain entrance to her apartment. He then thought that nobody was home and subsequently left.\n\nChow returned to Yung's apartment on the morning of 14 May 1985. He knocked on Yung's door again but no one answered. Chow said he smelled gas fumes through Yung's apartment door. He then climbed up the exterior apartment building wall to her second floor apartment and prised open her front window. He entered Yung's apartment (from the window) and discovered her unconscious and sprawled on the living room floor. Chow immediately alerted the building's security and police. Yung was rushed to the nearby Baptist Hospital, Kowloon where she was pronounced dead on arrival.\n\nThere were many rumours regarding the cause of her death. Some had attributed it to an accident, suicide or perhaps even foul play. One of the most widely circulated rumours was that her suicide was the result of her depression over her supposed broken relationship with then TVB actor, Kent Tong Chun-yip. (In an interview conducted by a Hong Kong radio station on 14 March 1985, when asked about rumours regarding her relationship with Kent Tong Chun-yip, Yung had explained that he was merely a friend and respected colleague.) The rumours concerning the association of her death with Kent Tong Chun-yip were largely based on Stephen Chow's account of her last 24 hours. There were also rumours which claimed that Stephen Chow was Yung's boyfriend. According to Yung's TVB colleagues, she had not behaved abnormally in the days before the incident and there was no hint that she was depressed or suicidal. Yung also sounded very optimistic about her future in her radio interviews both on 14 March 1985 and one conducted two weeks before her death. Yung did not leave a suicide note. At the time of her death, Yung was involved in filming the final chapters of the TVB drama, \"The Battlefield\". Filming was due to conclude in June 1985. She was to start shooting on a new drama called King of Ideas, alongside onscreen partner Kent Tong before her untimely death. Her role was given to TVB local actor Maggie Cheung.\n\nYung's funeral was a big event and was attended by throngs of fans and many prominent Hong Kong celebrities. Her remains were placed in the World Funeral Parlor, Hung Hom, Kowloon for fans and friends to pay their final respect. Her friends and co-stars in her TV dramas such as Michael Miu, Felix Wong, Tony Leung Chiu-wai, Andy Lau were pallbearers for her casket. Yung had a Catholic funeral. She was cremated in Hong Kong on 19 May 1985 and her ashes were brought back and laid to rest at the Cambridge City Cemetery in Cambridge, England (YouTube, Fan Video, 2007).\n\nYung's grave stone in Cambridge city cemetery continues to be visited by Chinese fans who remember her role in the 1983 Condor Heroes production. In 2017 the original white stone with black lettering was replaced by a dark stone with golden lettering that also marks the death of her mother (1926-2017). The golden lettering on a dark background is common to several gravestones in the area, but Yung's stone is distinctive in that it is heart-shaped and includes black-and-white photographs of both individuals.\n\n"}

He is a member of the Likud party. Rivlin was Minister of Communications from 2001 to 2003, and subsequently served as Speaker of the Knesset from 2003 to 2006, and again from 2009 to 2013. On 10 June 2014, he was elected President of Israel.\n\nRivlin argues for a Greater Israel that would embrace all people and give the Palestinians of the West Bank and Gaza full Israeli citizenship. He is also a strong supporter of minority rights, particularly for Arab Israelis. He supports the one-state solution to the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. Rivlin is fluent in Arabic.\n\nReuven Rivlin was born in Jerusalem during the Mandate era to the Rivlin family, which has lived in Jerusalem since 1809. He is a descendant of students of the Vilna Gaon. His parents were Rachel \"Ray\" Rivlin and Yosef Yoel Rivlin. Yosef created the first Hebrew edition of the Koran and was a candidate for president of Israel in 1957 before withdrawing in favor of the incumbent Yitzhak Ben-Zvi.. Reuven Rivlin is the great-grandson of Yosef Rivlin, a founder of Jerusalem's Nahalat Shiv'a neighborhood.\n\nRivlin attended Gymnasia Rehavia high school, and served in the Intelligence Corps of the Israel Defense Forces. During the Six-Day War, he fought with the Jerusalem Brigade and accompanied the Paratroopers Brigade as an intelligence officer. After military service, he studied law at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.\n\nBefore entering politics, Rivlin served as legal advisor of the Beitar Jerusalem Sports Association, manager of the Beitar football team, and chairman of the association; member of the Jerusalem City Council; member of the El Al Board; Chairman of the Israel Institute for Occupational Safety and Hygiene; a board member of the Khan Theater, and board member of the Israel Museum.\n\nHe was first elected to the 12th Knesset in 1988, and served as Likud chairman from 1988 to 1993. He lost his seat in the 1992 elections, but returned to the Knesset following the 1996 elections. Re-elected in 1999, he was appointed Minister of Communications in March 2001, serving until February 2003, when he was elected Knesset Speaker following the 2003 elections. During his term as Speaker, he was criticized for breaking the tradition of political neutrality of the post; he was one of Ariel Sharon's harshest critics regarding the disengagement plan, and had a public confrontation with Aharon Barak, Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, concerning the court's authority to declare legislation illegal.\n\nRivlin was re-elected in 2006 and 2009. He ran in the 2007 election for President as the Likud candidate. He withdrew after the first round of voting when it became clear that Kadima MK Shimon Peres had sufficiently broad support to inevitably win in a run-off.\n\nOn 30 March 2009, the Knesset elected Rivlin as Speaker with a majority of 90 votes out of 120.\n\nFor his first official visit as Knesset Speaker, he chose the Arab-Israeli town of Umm al-Fahm, just south of the Galilee. He was accompanied by MKs Uri Orbach (The Jewish Home) and Afu Agbariyah (Hadash), a resident of the city.\n\nSince 1999, Rivlin has employed Rivka Ravitz, a Haredi woman, first as his bureau chief and campaign advisor, and, upon his election to President, as his chief of staff. Ravitz is credited with managing Rivlin's successful campaigns for Knesset Speaker and President of Israel, and often accompanies him on his local appearances, as well as visits to foreign heads of state.\n\nRivlin was elected as the 10th President of Israel on 10 June 2014, receiving the support of 63 MKs in a runoff vote against MK Meir Sheetrit. In his bid to become President, he won support from both Arab legislators who appreciated his courtesy, and from right-wingers like Naftali Bennett and Danny Danon, who join him in a desire to make the West Bank a part of Israel proper.\n\nRivlin was sworn in on 24 July 2014, succeeding Shimon Peres. Upon his election as President, he immediately ceased being a member of the Israeli Parliament.\n\nOn March 25, 2015, Rivlin, in his role as President, officially chartered Benjamin Netanyahu with the assignment of forming a new government following elections the previous week. In his remarks during the ceremony, Rivlin noted that the first priority of the new government should be to mend the frayed relationship Israel's government has with the United States, and he expressed his disapproval of Netanyahu's election day exhortation that Arab voters were being bused to polling booths by NGOs and were voting \"in droves\". \"One who is afraid of votes in a ballot box will eventually see stones thrown in the streets\", said Rivlin.\n\nOther critical issues he recommended the new government address included establishing greater stability to avoid early elections and \"healing the wounds, mending the painful rifts, which have gaped open in the past years, and widened further in the course of this recent election\".\n\nIn July 2015, following Rivlin's condemnation of the firebombing of a Palestinian home by suspected Jewish extremists that resulted in the death of a Palestinian toddler, Rivlin received death threats. Rivlin labelled those who committed the violence as \"terrorists\", lamenting that his own people had \"chosen the path of terror\", and that Israel was lax in confronting Jewish religious terrorism and Jewish extremists.\n\nOn September 25, 2019, following elections, Rivlin gave Netanyahu, the head of the larger bloc, the first opportunity to pull together a coalition. When Netanyahu was a unable to do so, Rivlin gave the opportunity to Benny Gantz. Should Gantz fail, any MK will have 21 days to garner a Knesset majority to form a government. On November 21, 2019, Rivlin gave formal notice to Knesset Speaker Yuli Edelstein that Benny Gantz’s mandate to form a government had drawn to a close and the mandate to create a governing coalition would now lie with the Knesset. This is the first time in Israel's history that the Knesset has been tasked with doing so, and should it fail to do so, a new election will be called.\n\nAlthough considered a nationalist and hawkish on the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, Rivlin is a supporter of minority rights, particularly those of the Arab-Israelis. As speaker of the Knesset, Rivlin made his first official visit to the Arab-Israeli city of Umm al-Fahm, often portrayed as a locus of anti-state and pro-Palestine sentiment and agitation.\n\nIn June 2010, Rivlin ignored calls to remove Balad MK Haneen Zoabi for joining the Gaza flotilla. Rivlin's actions in defending the parliamentary rights of Zoabi were criticized by some, but others praised his courage in defending Israeli democracy. The same year, a group of rabbis on government payroll called on Jewish Israelis to not rent apartments to non-Jews. Rivlin protested this declaration, saying, \"In my opinion, their statement shames the Jewish people. If such a thing were said in relation to Jews anywhere on the globe, a hue and cry would be raised in Israel on the need to stand up against anti-Semitism.\"\n\nWhen asked about conditions for African refugees in Israel Rivlin stated, \"As a democrat and a Jew, I have a hard time with concentration camps, where people are warehoused.\" In 2013, Rivlin slammed Beitar fans who chanted anti-Arab slogans when two Arab players were added to the team. Rivlin told a gathering of academics: \"Israeli society is sick, and it is our duty to treat this disease.\"\n\nIn November 2014, Rivlin cancelled a scheduled performance of Amir Benayoun after the singer released an anti-Arab song. In 2016, Rivlin forbid Balad MK Jamal Zahalka to enter the presidential residence (\"Beit HaNassi\"), after Zahalka and other MKs of Balad met with the families of Palestinians who were killed while attacking Israeli civilians.\n\nIn 2000, Rivlin supported legislation that would make it illegal for women to wear prayer shawls. The law was not passed, but Rivlin's position on the issue led to estrangement with his American-Israeli feminist cousin, Lilly Rivlin. In 2008, the Knesset choir sang the \"Hatikva\" at a welcoming ceremony without the female members of the choir. Rivlin admitted that as Knesset speaker, he was careful not to invite women to sing so as not to create a conflict with Orthodox Jews.\n\nRivlin has voiced support for a version of a one-state solution, and remains a staunch supporter of Jewish settlement in the West Bank. In 2010, he said that he \"would rather accept Palestinians as Israeli citizens than divide Israel and the West Bank in a future two-state peace solution\".\nAccording to Rivlin, Israel's fight is not with the Palestinian people or Islam, but against murderous terrorism. He pointed out that Palestinians could not be expected to accept a two-state solution where \"one state is an invincible superpower, and the other is sub-autonomous\", while declaring that, \"West Bank settlements are as Israeli as Tel Aviv\". He told Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, \"Israel is working and trying to bring an end to the tragedy with the Palestinians. We must respect the idea (of a Palestinian state) because they're here, and they must recognize the idea that the Jewish nation has returned to its homeland. These are difficult challenges when there is no trust between nations.\"\n\nAlthough not Orthodox himself, Rivlin has been critical of non-Orthodox movements in Judaism. In 1989, Rivlin referred to Reform Jews as \"idol worshippers\", and refused to call Reform Jewish rabbis by their title. Prior to becoming President, he opposed granting equal status to Reform or Conservative Judaism. In 2014, Rivlin said that if non-Orthodox conversion standards were adopted, Jewish status would be based on \"a civic definition rather than a religious definition\", echoing a Knesset speech he gave in 2006 when he declared: \"I have no doubt, and my positions are known, that the status of Judaism according to halachah (Jewish law) is what has kept us going for 3,800 years.\"\n\nIn November 2014, however, Rivlin welcomed at his residence over 50 Reform leaders on the Board of Governors of Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion and told them, \"We are one family and the connection between all Jews, all over the world, is very important to the State of Israel.\" In 2015, he did not allow a Conservative rabbi to officiate at a bar mitzvah service at his residence for disabled children who attended a program run by the Conservative movement, but later hosted representatives of the Reform, Conservative, and Orthodox Jewish communities for a joint study session at the President's Residence.\n\nRivlin once campaigned for Israel to recognize the Armenian Genocide. In 2012, he said, \"It is our moral duty to remember and remind of the tragedy that befell the Armenian people, who lost more than a million of its sons during the First World War, and we must not make this a political issue. I am aware of the sensitivity of this issue. But let us be clear: This is not an accusation of Turkey today or of the current Turkish government.\" As president, he has been less vocal on this issue. Concerned about the negative reaction of Turkey if the president signed the petition, unnamed officials of the Foreign Ministry welcomed what they called Rivlin's \"statesmanship\".\n\nIn February 2018, the Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki stated that \"there were Jewish perpetrators\" of the Holocaust, \"not only German perpetrators.\" President Rivlin condemned his words: \"Saying that our people collaborate with the Nazis is a new low...today, more than ever, we must work to educate the world, even some of the leaders, about that dark time.\"\n\nPresident Rivlin took part in the March of the Living in Poland on April 12, 2018. In the meeting with Polish President Andrzej Duda, he said: \"There is no doubt that there were many Poles who fought the Nazi regime, but we cannot deny that Poland and Poles had a hand in the extermination.\"\n\nHe was married to Nechama Rivlin from 1971 until her death in 2019, and has four children. Rivlin has been a vegetarian since the late 1960s. Rivlin has been a supporter of the Beitar Jerusalem football club since the age of seven, when he attended his first game.\n\nAccording to the \"Jerusalem Post\" Rivlin gave a speech in 2017 that criticized Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahus government, saying he had witnessed a \"continued effort to weaken the gatekeepers of Israeli democracy\" and speaking also about the role of the judiciary in Israeli democracy:\n\nThere is an abyss between the responsible and courageous attempt to define, after years, the relations between the legislative and judicial branches, to draw borders for judicial criticism, ask questions about appointments, aim for a more varied and representative group of judges – and the attempt to terrorize the [Supreme] Court, weaken it as an institution and invite the public to undermine its authority and rulings.\n\nA few days after the speech graffiti in Bnei Brak appeared calling Rivlin a \"Nazi apostate from Judaism\". Police were called to investigate the incident.\n\n"}

His success tended to be directly proportional to his fastball velocity, because the fastball set up his best strikeout pitch – a baffling, darting forkball, which caused great difficulty for hitters because of his unorthodox arm slot. Speier also threw a two-seamer and a slider.\n\nAfter being chosen in the 55th round by the Chicago Cubs in the 1995 Major League Baseball draft, Speier made it to the big leagues in .\n\nHe appeared in one game for the Cubs before he was dealt with two other teammates to the Florida Marlins.

During his seven Major League seasons, he batted .261 and hit 82 home runs. Trammell appeared in the 2000 World Series as a member of the Mets.\n\nTrammell was born on November 6, 1971, in Knoxville, Tennessee. He grew up with his mother, Brenda Graves, father, Clarence L. “Buddy” Trammell, and older sister, Kimberely Diane Trammell. He was named after Bubba Wyche, a Tennessee football quarterback. His father said that Bubba walked around the house holding a bat since age 2. When his mom asked him what he wanted to be when he grew up, he always said that he wanted to play baseball. According to his father, “We put a batting cage in the backyard when [Bubba] was 14. He’d be out there swinging a bat eight hours a day. He’d come inside for a sandwich and go right back outside. He wore me out so I got an automatic ball feeder for it and headed back inside to the air conditioning.” \n\nTrammell attended Central High School in Knoxville, where he played baseball and golf. He went on to attend and play baseball at Cleveland State Community College and the University of Tennessee. During his two years at U.T. (1993–1994), he had a .368 batting average, and hit 22 home runs and 105 RBIs. He would later be named to the school's \"All-Century Team.\"\n\nAt the age of 21, Trammell was drafted by the Baltimore Orioles, but he did not sign. He was drafted again two years later for the Detroit Tigers in the 11th round of the 1994 MLB amateur draft, but this time, he did sign a contract. He played on Detroit’s Triple-A affiliate, the Toledo Mud Hens, for three years. By this time, he was 6’2”, weighed 220 pounds, hit right, and batted right.\n\nTrammell made his Major League Baseball debut when he was 25 years old. His first game was on April 1, 1997, with the Detroit Tigers. He played in the majority of the Tigers’ opening games. He mostly played as the designated hitter, but also played several games in left field and right field. In his 44 games, he batted .228. He was sent back to the Triple-As by May and finished the season there.\n\nAfter his stint with the Tigers, Trammell was drafted by the Tampa Bay Devil Rays. He pinch-hit in the team’s first game on March 31, 1998, against Detroit. Over the next two and a half years with the Devil Rays, Trammell had limited play; he played in 59 games in 1998, 82 games in 1999, and 66 games in 2000. He mostly played left field, but also made appearances as a right fielder and designated hitter. He batted .286 in 1998, .290 in 1999, and .275 in 2000.\n\nTrammell has been described as a fan favorite. One sports columnist wrote: “[H]e was the kind of guy you wanted to see achieve great things. He was a hustler and a gambler on the field, and carried a big bat into the box with him nightly”. Notably, there was a group of fans who sat in section 142 of the Devil Ray’s stadium— Tropicana Field— and called themselves the “142 Crew.” They were led by fan Ted Fleming, who would go on to work for \"The Examiner\" and host his own sports radio show. The “142 Crew” became known for their \"Bubba\" signs and enthusiastic cheering, which included a “Bu-bba!” chant. This section was so loud that the Devil Rays sometimes timed their stadium music around its chanting.\n\nTrammell played for the Devil Rays until July 2000, when he was traded to the New York Mets. He hit a home run in his first game on July 30, becoming the seventh player to hit a home run in his first Mets at-bat. He continued to play as a left fielder and right fielder for 36 games. He batted .232. The Mets won the 2000 National League pennant, then played and lost in the 2000 World Series against the New York Yankees. Of the five games in this series, Trammell played two games as a right fielder and two games as a designated hitter. He hit two home runs and batted .400.\n\nTrammell was traded to the San Diego Padres in 2001. He later reported that, “At the time I was ready to sign my contract [with the Padres], I told them, ‘Hey, I'll play for free if you give me 500 at-bats!’ I was kidding, but I would have”. Trammell finally became a regular, playing in 142 games and hitting .261 in 2001, and 133 games and hitting .243 in 2002. Trammell had one of his best seasons in 2001, hitting 25 homeruns and 92 RBIs. Furthermore, he won the “Favorite San Padres” award in 2001.\n\nTrammell was traded to the Yankees in 2003. He played in 22 games as a left fielder and designated hitter. His batting average was .200. He left the Yankees in the middle of the season. His last game was on June 23, 2003, which ended up being his last game played in the major leagues. His teammates suggested he left because he was angry at the Yankees manager, Joe Torre, for not giving him enough playing time. Bubba later reported that he was suffering from depression.\n\nIn the years following his departure from the Yankees, Trammell struggled with personal problems and sustained a meniscus injury. He played in the minor leagues hoping to make a comeback, but he never made it back into the major leagues. He officially retired on July 2, 2007, while on a rehab assignment with the Aberdeen IronBirds, where he was batting .143 after nine games.\n\nOverall, Trammell played 584 games in his seven-year MLB career. He was at bat 1,798 times, batted .261, made 469 hits, 96 doubles, 7 triples, 82 home runs, 285 runs batted in, and had a .339 on-base percentage. He played 297 games in right field and 194 games in left field, and had a fielding percentage of .986.\n\nTrammell and his former wife, Melissa, have three children: Madison Rebecca (born in 1995), Brandon Allen (born in 1998), and Bryson (born in 2002). Trammell reported that he battled depression starting in 2003. His great-grandfather and his great-uncle had been hospitalized, and he had marital problems. One notable incident occurred on September 6, 2003. According to an incident report, Melissa was living with a platonic friend named Steven Hume. Trammell allegedly confronted them after a baseball game and threatened to kill Hume. Trammell and his wife divorced in 2004. Melissa was given custody of their children and remarried. In addition, Trammell’s mother and sister were diagnosed with cancer in 2004. Teammates described Trammell as soft-spoken and friendly. Bubba Trammell is not related to former Detroit Tigers HOF shortstop, Alan Trammell\n\n"}

While they are common in muddy areas, their name \"arenaria\" means sandy and they prefer a combination of sandy and muddy areas. They are well known as a food item on the coast of New England in the Western Atlantic Ocean; however, the range extends much farther north to Canada and south to the Southern states. \nThey are also found in the Eastern Atlantic Ocean, for example in the UK, as well as in the North Sea's Wadden Sea (where they are the dominant large clam).\n\nThis species has become invasive on the Pacific Coast of North America, including Alaska, Canada and the continental United States. However \"M. arenaria\" originated in the Pacific Ocean during the Miocene. It extended its range in the early Pliocene to the Atlantic, including European waters. The Pacific and European populations became extinct some time in the early Pleistocene, leaving only the Northwest Atlantic population, which subsequently spread via humans to its current distribution. It also occurs in the Mediterranean Sea.\n\n\"Mya arenaria\" has a calcium carbonate shell, which is very thin and easily broken, hence the name \"soft-shells\" (as opposed to its beach-dwelling neighbors, the thick-shelled quahog).\n\nThis clam is found living approximately under the surface of the mud. It extends its paired siphons up to the surface, which draw in seawater, filter it for food, and expel it. The holes in the mud through which the water is drawn in and out can often be seen at low tide. Water may be visibly ejected from the siphon tips when pressure is applied to the surrounding mud. This makes the clams easier to locate when humans are clam digging.\n\nAs well as being eaten by humans, the soft-shelled clam is apparently relished by sea otters in the eastern Pacific Ocean, where the clam is an invasive species (see image below). In New England the soft-shell clam is preyed heavily upon by northern moon snails and invasive green crabs. They are also a favorite of sea gulls, which pull the clam from the sand, climb to about , and then drop the clam on a hard surface, breaking the shell. They then dive down quickly to eat the soft parts of the clam before others can get to it.\n\nSoft-shell clams are edible and can be used in a variety of dishes. Before cooking, it is generally recommended that clams be stored in saltwater for a few hours to facilitate the expulsion of sand from their digestive tracts. Some recommend that cornmeal be added to the water to give the clams something to filter from it.\n\nSoft-shell clams can be eaten steamed, fried, or in clam chowder. \"Steamers\" (steamed soft-shell clams) are an integral part of the New England clam bake, where they are served steamed whole in the shell, then pulled from the shell at the table, the neck skin is removed and then while holding the clam by the neck it is dipped, first in the clam broth in which they were cooked, to rinse away remaining sand, and then very briefly in melted butter.\n\n"}

The scientific body was also diminutive, though illustrious: in addition to the director, astronomer Lélio Gama, who also headed the National Observatory, the institute counted only the young mathematicians Leopoldo Nachbin and Maurício Peixoto.\n\nGama's performance at the helm of IMPA, with his experience and wisdom, played a crucial role in the creation and consolidation of the young institute. And Nachbin and Peixoto would later be the first Brazilians invited to lecture at the International Congress of Mathematicians, which is one of the greatest distinctions in a mathematician's career. The academic prestige of IMPA grew from 1957, with the organization of the first Brazilian Colloquium of Mathematics, with about 50 participants. The Colloquium has been taking place every two years since then, in an uninterrupted fashion. Much of Brazilian mathematics was built around it. Also in 1957, IMPA moved to Rua São Clemente, in Botafogo, also in the south of Rio.\nIn 1962, the master's and doctoral programs began in Mathematics, through an agreement signed with the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, which officially awarded the titles of master and doctor. In 1967, IMPA moved again to a historic building on Rua Luiz de Camões, in the center of Rio de Janeiro, which currently houses the Hélio Oiticica Cultural Center. The following year, with support from the National Bank for Economic Development (future BNDES) and later from the Financier of Studies and Projects (FINEP), in addition to CNPq itself, IMPA expanded its work with Brazilian mathematicians in foreign or in phase PhD in the best foreign institutions.

The reservoir behind the dam is Old Hickory Lake. The dam and lake are named after President Andrew Jackson (nicknamed \"Old Hickory\"), who lived in the vicinity at The Hermitage.\n\nOld Hickory Lock and Dam was authorized for construction by the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1946 as a unit of a comprehensive development plan for the Cumberland River Basin. The project was designed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and built by private contractors under the Corp's supervision. Construction started in January 1952, and dam closure was completed in June 1954. The project was completed for full beneficial use in December 1957 with the placement of the final hydroelectric power unit in operation.\n\nOld Hickory Reservoir is long lying between Nashville and Carthage. The reservoir is essentially a run-of-river type without regulating storage other than for incidental flood control through surcharge operation, and for pondage for power generation and lockages; hence, low water flow of the river will be increased only indirectly through the use and passage of discharges from upstream plants. Such releases, however, result in a more sufficient and higher quality of water for domestic and industrial consumption and use are effective in pollution abatement downstream. Due to the fairly constant level maintained under normal operating conditions, the reservoir is well suited for conservation and recreational purposes. Beginning in 2007, the multi-year altered flow and water temperatures resulting from the emergency maintenance on the Wolf Creek Dam affected Old Hickory like the other Cumberland River reservoirs and resulted in modifications about environmental management.\n\nThe lock, dam, powerhouse and lake are operated and supervised by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' personnel under the direction of the District Engineer at Nashville. The lock allows barges and recreational boats to navigate the Cumberland River.\n\nThe power plant is operated so as to use as much of the water flow as possible for power production. During periods of high stream flow, the spillway gates are opened to pass the water in excess of the capacity of the turbines, and as necessary for retention and regulation of floodwaters through surcharge operation. The upper portion of the reservoir, corresponding to a five-foot depth above the normal headwater level, is provided for surcharge storage. This storage space is utilized by raising all of the spillway gates in small equal increments, thus permitting passage of some water under them, but retaining or forcing into storage all inflow to the reservoir in excess of the spillway discharge and power releases.\n\nOld Hickory was a key element in flood control during flooding on the Cumberland River in 2010. The operation and timing of water releases, following the of rain over two days, subsequently became the subject of a US Senate hearing.\n\nCheatham Dam located below Nashville was so flooded that the Corps pulled out the spillway gates and evacuated the dam allowing the river free discharge over the dam which was considered in the design. Old Hickory was not designed for a dam over-topping so a priority for the Corps was to prevent the reservoir overflowing the dam. The river upstream finally stopped rising on Sunday night with the reservoir approximately one foot below the top of the dam.\n\nA few days before the flood Old Hickory Dam was releasing approximately of water. At the peak release on Sunday afternoon, the dam was releasing a record flow of over of water.\n"}
{"id": "2334724", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2334724", "title": "White band disease", "text": "White band disease\n\nWhite band disease is a coral disease that affects acroporid corals and is distinguishable by the blue band of dead coral tissue that it forms. The disease completely destroys the coral tissue of Caribbean acroporid corals, specifically elkhorn coral (\"Acropora palmata\") and staghorn coral (\"A. cervicornis\"). The disease exhibits a pronounced division between the remaining coral tissue and the exposed coral skeleton. These symptoms are similar to white plague, except that white band disease is only found on acroporid corals, and white plague has not been found on any acroporid corals. It is part of a class of similar disease known as \"white syndromes\", many of which may be linked to species of \"Vibrio\" bacteria. While the pathogen for this disease has not been identified, \"Vibrio carchariae\" may be one of its factors. The degradation of coral tissue usually begins at the base of the coral, working its way up to the branch tips, but it can begin in the middle of a branch.\n\nWhite band disease causes the affected coral tissue to spin off the skeleton in a white uniform band for which the disease was given its name. The band, which can range from a few millimeters to 10 centimeters wide, typically works its way from the base of the coral colony up to the coral branch tips. The band progresses up the coral branch at an approximate rate of 5 millimeters per day, causing tissue loss as it works its way to the branch tips. After the tissue is lost, the bare skeleton of the coral may later by colonized by filamentous algae.\n\nThere are two variants of white band disease, type I and type II. In Type I of white band disease, the tissue remaining on the coral branch shows no sign of coral bleaching, although the affected colony may appear lighter in color overall. However, a variant of white band disease, known simply as white band disease Type II, which was found on Staghorn colonies near the Bahamas, does produce a margin of bleached tissue before it is lost. Type II of white band disease can be mistaken for coral bleaching. By examining the remaining living coral tissue for bleaching, one can delineate which type of the disease affects a given coral.\n\nNo known pathogen has been isolated (it has only been attempted for type II) for white band disease, although there is a shift of bacterial composition in the surface layer where the band eats away as the coral tissue. The bacteria shifts from a dominant pseudomonad population to an increasingly dominant \"Vibrio carchariae\" population. Histopathological examinations of diseased tissue provide some insight into the specific pathogen or combination of pathogens that cause this disease. However, substantial samples of rickettsiales have been present in the surface layer, which causes scientists to suspect that this bacteria may be one of the factors of the disease.\n\nThe disease, however, typically begins from the base of the coral and works its way up the coral branches. As it progresses, the band leaves behind the white coral skeleton. Many of the details of how the breakdown of coral occurs due to the bacteria are unclear mainly in part to the difficulty in isolating marine bacteria. Studies have confirmed that white band disease is contagious and caused by a pathogenic bacteria. Experiments have shown that Ampicillin may be able to treat white band disease type I.\n\nSince white band disease was first reported in the 1970s, the disease has led to the devastation of approximately 95% of the elkhorn and staghorn corals in the Caribbean region. This resulted in both affected species being listed as threatened under the US Endangered Species Act and as critically endangered on the IUCN Red List. The decline in these corals has a lasting effect on both humans and the environment. Coral reefs protect coastlines from ocean currents, waves, and storms, and the death of these corals only increases the loss of coastlines in affected regions. Elkhorn and staghorn corals are two of the major reef-building corals, the foundation on which the rest of the coral reef is formed. Its loss means the loss of a habitat for many coral reef dwelling species such as lobsters, parrot-fish, snapper shrimps, and many other reef species, causing a sharp decline in the biodiversity of an affected region. Coral reefs are also home to more than twenty-five percent of all marine fish species, making them extremely biologically diverse. The loss of this coral would be particularly damaging to people living on the coast in terms of the food supply, coastal protection, economic security and more. Nearly 500 million people directly depend on coral reefs for food and income (through tourism or otherwise).\n\nElkhorn coral absorbs much carbon dioxide from the ocean every year, preventing ocean acidification and ocean temperature increases. Upon decomposing, Elkhorn coral releases its sequestered carbon dioxide back into the ocean, heating it and contributing to acidification. White band disease threatens more than just the coral with its lethal touch. In recent decades, the coral cover in coral reefs has been declining, providing for a transitional increase in the fleshy macroalgae cover in the Caribbean region as more and more filamentous algae colonize inside of the coral skeletons. The death of elkhorn and staghorn corals also substantially reduces coral cover and provides substratum space for further algal growth. Prospects are poor for the recovery of the elkhorn coral, given its asexual method of reproduction, which relies on coral fragments breaking off from the main body and growing in a new area. Staghorn coral also relies on asexual fragmentation as its primary method of reproduction, however, staghorn coral possesses a higher rate of sexual recruitment than Elkhorn coral.\n\nWhite band disease has been reported most notably in the Caribbean region. However, white band disease has also been sighted in the Red Sea, and the Indo-Pacific region, including the Philippines, the Great Barrier Reef, and Indonesia. Unlike white band disease in the Caribbean region, white band disease in the Indo-Pacific region has been found on approximately 34 species of massive, branching and plating corals instead of just simply Elkhorn and Staghorn corals.\n\nWhite band disease is highly contagious through direct contact between diseased and healthy coral tissue. It can also be transmitted by the corallivorous snail, which means that the species consumes coral, \"Coralliophila abbreviata\". \"C. abbreviata\", a species native to the region where Elkhorn and Staghorn corals are found, is able to act as a \"reservoir\" for white band disease, meaning that it is able to retain the disease pathogen for at least two weeks. However, not all corallivorous snails are able to transmit white band disease (i.e. \"Coralliophila caribaea\"). Waterborne transmission of the disease pathogen becomes possible when the coral tissue is lesioned (or otherwise injured). However, the potential for injury among the affected corals tends to be high given the many ways tissue injury may occur naturally including competition by other corals, mechanical damage, or corallivory by snails, damselfish, butterflyfish, fireworms, or other such aquatic organisms. Waterborne transmission helps to explain how the disease spread across the Caribbean so rapidly, given that direct contact between affected corals is limited to physical interaction between the diseased and healthy coral and that the corallivorous snail, \"C. abbreviata\" that carries the disease, does not travel across long distances.\n\nInsights into the nature of white band disease transmission provide understanding of how the disease might be managed and controlled to prevent major losses in coral. Waterborne transmission of white band disease may prove difficult to manage however, given the flowing nature of ocean currents. An alternative method would be to control \"C. abbreviata\" populations to reduce the incidence of white band disease by manually removing samples of the population, similar to efforts to remove \"Pterois\" from the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nWhite band disease prevalence in the Caribbean varies seasonally. It is more active in summer and less prominent in winter, suggesting that warmer water temperatures contribute to the waterborne spread of the disease to affected corals. The impacts of climate change and increasing carbon emissions only serve to heat the waters surrounding the coral reef ecosystems, which may allow for the spread of diseases such as white band disease and others. The severity of marine diseases such as white band disease increase for several reasons. Elevated water temperature can cause corals physiological stress. This possibly undermines their immune systems and makes them more susceptible to infection from white band disease or other coral diseases. Furthermore, elevated temperatures make bacterial and fungal pathogens much more virulent. However, the disease is not limited to elevated water temperatures as white band disease can still be prevalent even when water temperatures are cool.\n\nAnthropogenic climate change is possibly negatively impacting the world's corals and coral reef ecosystems. Over the next few decades as climate change continues, oceanic warming and acidification will accelerate and further damage the fragile reef ecosystems. Prediction of the impacts of future climate change on coral reefs can be difficult given the uncertainty in certain involved socioeconomic factors (i.e. political response, future technology, changes in human behavior, the earth's climate system, and the realtime effects on coral reefs). Despite these uncertainties, humans could see the extinction of the coral reef ecosystem by the end of the 21st century if actions are not taken to protect them. According to forecast models of increasing oceanic temperature, mass mortality events will likely occur as early as the summer of 2030 and continue to occur on an annual basis.\n\n\n"}

The ward has a population of 13,664.\n\nSwaythling is predominantly residential in character, and noted for its large student population due to its proximity to the University of Southampton main campus at Highfield. The university's Wessex Lane Halls and City Gateway housing facilities are located within the district.\n\nSwaythling during the First World War was the location of the Swaythling Remount Depot and prior to its closure in 2013, the Ford Motor Company Southampton Assembly Plant.\n\nRecorded as \"Swæthelinge\" in 909 AD, the origins of the name Swaythling (or prior to 1895, more commonly referred to as Swathling village) are uncertain. It is widely thought that the name originally referred to the stream that runs through the area, now known as Monks Brook; the Old English word \"swætheling\" is believed to mean \"misty stream\".\n\nSwaythling originally formed part of the parish of South Stoneham, which encompassed Eastleigh and almost all of the land between Swaythling and the Bargate, in Southampton City Centre. The parish church was St. Mary's; the present building is one of Southampton's two medieval churches. It is accessible from Wessex Lane, down a short track between Connaught Hall and South Stoneham House (both now halls of residence serving the University of Southampton).\n\nSouth Stoneham House was built in 1708 for the Surveyor of the Navy, Edmund Dummer, and is attributed to Nicholas Hawksmoor. The grounds were laid out after 1772 by Capability Brown.\n\nWoodmill is an ancient watermill site located in Swaythling at the highest tidal point of the River Itchen, where it is joined by the Itchen Navigation. The industrialist Walter Taylor moved there after 1770, but his mill burned down in 1820 to be replaced by the present structure which is now used as a water sports and outdoor activity centre.\n\nFollowing his exile to Britain in 1852, the deposed Argentine dictator, Juan Manuel de Rosas, rented Burgess Street Farm in Swaythling, where he spent the rest of his days until his death in 1877. The local people at that time are said to have developed a taste for the Argentine beverage, mate, as a result.\n\nDuring the First World War Swaythling was the location of the British Army's largest remount depot; a facility for the collection, training and care of horses and mules prior to dispatch to the Western Front. Originally designed in 1914 to accommodate three squadrons (1,500 horses), the depot, located on both sides of Bassett Green Road, was subsequently expanded to provide stabling for ten squadrons (5,000 horses).\n\nWith the construction of the \"Flower Roads\" council estate, St. Alban's church was erected in 1933. St Alban's remained a separate parish until 1992, when the parish of Swaythling came into being, incorporating the former parishes of St. Alban's, Southampton and South Stoneham, with both St. Alban's and St. Mary's church buildings being used for worship.\n\nIn 1931 Connaught Hall was built, to accompany South Stoneham House as a hall of residence for the University. The University acquired South Stoneham House in 1921 and subsequently in 1964 added a 17-storey residential tower block that now dominates the Wessex Lane area.\n\nMuch of the Swaythling landscape and its architecture was captured in the 1950s and 1960s by local artist Eric Meadus.\n\nThe University of Southampton's City Gateway hall of residence, opened in 2015, was included in the runners-up list of the Carbuncle Cup, a competition by Building Design magazine to identify the ugliest building in the United Kingdom completed in the previous 12 months. Designed by Fluid Design and Stride Treglown, the building provides accommodation for 375 students and features a 15-story elliptical tower and two adjoining six story rectangular accommodation blocks at the fork of two major roads. The building has acquired the unfortunate nickname \"The Cigarette Butt\" amongst locals, although the English vernacular is preferred over \"Cigarette\".\n\nSwaythling is a northern suburban district in the city of Southampton and borders (clockwise from South) Portswood, Highfield, Bassett, Eastleigh, Mansbridge and Townhill Park. Predominantly low-lying in terms of elevation, the ward boundary to the east is defined by Monks Brook and the Itchen River. The northern section of the Swaythling district is bisected in part by the M27 motorway.\n\nThe stream that gave the area its name is largely hidden from view as it runs through Swaythling, although it can still be seen next to the Fleming Arms pub (now owned by the Greene King Brewery, the Fleming Arms used to be a Beefeater restaurant until a fire led to the sale of the property). The Shell petrol station serving Thomas Lewis Way stands on the site of a cinema that fronted onto High Road.\n\nThe historical village of Swaythling is now extensively suburban in character with much of the area used for residential housing. High Road, which was the village's high street, has waned in popularity recently with several established businesses, such as Dunning's grocery store, having shut down. High Road today is dominated by take-away food outlets and a couple of newsagents. The Old Black Cat (The Hampton Park Hotel) pub was turned into a McDonald's restaurant in the late 1990s.\n\nThe ward has a population of 13,394, consisting of 6,835 males and 6,559 females. 63.4 per cent of the population of Swaythling are Christian, 22.7 per cent have no religion, 2.6 per cent are Muslim and 1.3 per cent Buddhist. 70.5 per cent of Swaythling's population are in good health, a figure which is above the averages for Southampton and England. A further 21.9 per cent are in fairly good health, while 7.56 per cent are classified as \"not good\".\n\nThere are 4,727 households in Swaythling, of which 17.9 per cent are owner occupied and owned outright, 25.1 per cent are owner occupied with a mortgage or similar loan, 1.6 per cent are shared ownership, 18.4 per cent are rented from the Council, 13.8 per cent are rented from a housing association, 20.1 are rented from a private landlord or letting agency, and 3.1 per cent rented from elsewhere.\n\nThe Ford Southampton plant was a motor vehicle assembly plant, located in Mansbridge. It was the western European home to the production of the Ford Transit van. The plant, purposefully located on a site near to Southampton Airport, was built as a shadow factory to assemble aircraft components for engineering firm Cunliffe-Owen Aircraft, opened by the Mayor of Southampton on 2 February 1939. At the outbreak of World War II, its whole supply chain was switched to produce parts for the Supermarine Spitfire. Recognised as an important part of the British war effort, it was bombed on a number of occasions by the Nazi Luftwaffe, the first in September 1940. In the latter years of the war, the site was used to assemble the Spitfire.\n\nAfter Cunliffe-Owen was placed in receivership in 1947, the factory was bought in 1949 by Briggs Motor Bodies, who supplied Ford of Britain with bodies for their vehicles. In 1953 Ford acquired Briggs, and hence gained control of the Southampton plant. From 1965, Ford had started to produce the Ford Transit in Great Britain, with bodies from Swaythling shipped up the M3 motorway to be mated with chassis at the Langley, Berkshire factory, near Slough. In 1972, Ford of Britain invested £5M in the Southampton plant, enabling it to make the complete Transit van. The first Transit rolled off of the production line in the same year, given to the mayor to be used as a gift for a local charity. From this point until the mid-1980s was the height of production, with the factory employing 4,500 workers.\n\nIn 1983 with construction of the M27 motorway starting, the site was permanently cut off from Southampton Airport. In 2002, Ford stopped producing passenger cars in the UK, leaving the Southampton made Transit as their only British-made vehicle. In 2009, with the new Kocaeli, Turkey, plant in full production, Ford reluctantly halved production at Southampton and reduced the workforce to just over 500.\n\nEmploying 500 workers, the factory produced up to 35,000 Transit chassis/cab variant vehicles annually, of which 50% were exported.\n\nThe Ford Southampton plant closed on 26 July 2013.\n\nThe very first branch of the DIY chain B&Q was opened in Swaythling in 1969. The shop was owned by Messrs Block and Quayle.\n\nSwaythling railway station is on the main line between London and Bournemouth, and was opened in 1883. Originally Swathling Station, the \"Y\" was added in 1895 at the request of the squire, Sir Samuel Montagu, who became the first Baron Swaythling in 1907.\n\nOn 24 August 1988 Swaythling was recorded in the Guinness Book of Records as the site of the largest street party in the world when the A335 (Thomas Lewis Way) was first opened. This route allows traffic to bypass Swaythling and the neighbouring suburb of Portswood when travelling from the M27 to Southampton's city centre. Around 3000 people were present at the event.\n\nSwaythling Athletic Football Club was established in 1946 in the Fleming Arms public house and played its early games on the field at Walnut Avenue. The club changed its name to Swaythling FC shortly afterwards, playing at Ten Acres in North Stoneham from 1957. In 1980 the club changed its name again to its current form, Eastleigh F.C..\n\nThe Swaythling Cup, an international table tennis competition, was set up in 1926 by Baroness Swaythling's two sons, Ivor and Ewen Montagu.\n\nJuan Manuel Rosas, Argentine dictator, lived in exile in Swaythling where he had a farm, dying in 1877.\n\nProfessor Martin Glennie, developer of promising cancer immunotherapeutic drug CHiLOB7/4 currently undergoing clinical trials lives in Swaythling\n\n\n"}

He is a co-founder, former chief executive officer, and former chief creative officer of Rooster Teeth. He is noted for his contributions in machinima, a form of film-making that uses video game technology in its production, and also works with animation and live action. Burns is also known for his work in the hosting and podcasting field.\n\nIn April 2003, Burns, along with several friends and co-workers, created the machinima series \"Red vs. Blue: The Blood Gulch Chronicles\". Filmed using the video game \",\" \"Red vs. Blue\" was acclaimed for its humor and originality, making Burns an Internet celebrity. His success allowed him to co-found the production company Rooster Teeth. After the immediate popularity of \"Red vs. Blue\", Burns attracted the attention of video game company Electronic Arts, who asked him to create a promotional series using their upcoming game, \"The Sims 2\". The result was \"The Strangerhood\". Burns also premiered \"P.A.N.I.C.S.\", a mini-series that utilizes the \"F.E.A.R.\" game engine. In 2016, Burns starred in the science fiction comedy film \"Lazer Team\" and its sequel the following year, both of which he co-wrote.\n\nAs one of the innovators in the field of machinima, he has made guest appearances at the Penny Arcade Expo, San Diego Comic-Con International, Sundance and The Sydney Film Festival. For his work on \"Immersion\" (2010), a live action series that tests video game tropes in the real world, and \"The Gauntlet\" (2013), Rooster Teeth's reality game show, he has been nominated for two IAWTV awards in the \"Best Host of a Web Series (Pre-Recorded)\" category. He was named one of the \"Top 25 Digital Stars\" by \"The Hollywood Reporter\" in 2015. Alongside longtime-business partner Matt Hullum, he was named one of Variety's top Digital Entertainment Execs to Watch in 2018.\n\nBurns was born in the Rochester, New York area and grew up in Houston, Texas. His father was a physics professor who worked on the Desertron Super Collider. He is of one quarter French-Canadian descent. The nickname \"Burnie\" was given to him by an Alief Elsik High School senior to separate him from the many Michaels in his class. Burns' determination to pursue a medical career led him to become a member of HOSA. Half of his senior year consisted of clinical rotations at Southwest Memorial Hospital.\n\nAfter high school, he was accepted at the University of Notre Dame but, unable to afford the tuition, he chose to attend The University of Texas at Austin, where he received a Bachelor of Arts in Computer Science. While there, Burns got his start in video production by volunteering at K29HW-D, Texas Student Television. During his time with TSTV, he founded \"Sneak Peek\", the longest-running student television program in the world, in which he reviewed films and conducted interviews with guests such as Adam Sandler.\n\nBurns went on to become the president of the tech support company teleNetwork Partners, and eventually broke out to form his independent company Rooster Teeth.\n\nIn his final year of university, Burns was intent on making a movie. Joel Heyman and Matt Hullum, who were roommates at the time, agreed to help, with the former agreeing to star and the latter helping write, produce and direct. They shot \"The Schedule\" (1997) over a three-month period on 16mm film for $9,000. It took 10 months to edit on a non-linear editor Burns himself built. That same system was used in his early videos, including their first viral hit.\n\nBurns became frustrated with the difficult distribution process and the film only screened in a few festivals. They turned down an offer of about $25,000 to buy because they \"wanted to hold onto the story.\" A few VHS copies of \"The Schedule\" exist in Burns' possession. Soon after, the trio parted ways. Heyman and Hullum went to Los Angeles, while Burns accepted a position at a local tech support company.\n\nThere, he met his co-workers and future \"Red vs. Blue\" collaborators Geoff Ramsey and Gus Sorola. In June 2002, Burns teamed up with his colleagues to create their first viral video, a Mac Gamer Switch parody.\n\nBurns attributes \"two vectors that came together, the movie guys and the tech guys,\" as being a catalyst for their success.\n\nBurns joined Geoff Ramsey and Gus Sorola in one of their many Internet ventures, \"drunkgamers\".com creating voiceover-enhanced gameplay videos for the website. The trio were giant enthusiasts of the 2001 first-person shooter video game \"\", leading them to discuss whether an automobile in the game known as a Warthog looks like a puma. Burns has said that this discussion was \"the spark for the whole series\". Seeing potential for a full story, Burns created a , which was released September 5, 2002 on the \"drunkgamers\" website, but it was largely ignored, and, for unrelated reasons, \"drunkgamers\" soon closed. Four months later, \"Computer Gaming World\" contacted Ramsey for permission to include a different \"drunkgamers\" video in a CD to be distributed with the magazine. Ramsey granted permission, but he and Burns felt that they needed a website to take advantage of the exposure from \"Computer Gaming World\". They therefore resurrected \"Red vs. Blue\" and re-released the trailer to coincide with the \"Computer Gaming World\" issue. Burns founded the production company Rooster Teeth to produce the show with Sorola, Ramsey, Matt Hullum and Joel Heyman. The was released on April 1, 2003. The series is primarily produced using the machinima technique of synchronizing video footage from a game to pre-recorded dialogue and other audio.\n\nBurns initially envisioned \"Red vs. Blue\" to be short, but the series grew beyond his expectations. Burns and Ramsey had preconceived a list of jokes for which they allocated six to eight episodes. By , however, they realized that the series had fleshed out more than expected; they had covered only about one third of their original list. At the same time, the show received the attention of major websites such as Slashdot, Penny Arcade, and Fark, leading to thousand of views. Later in , Burns estimated a series of 22 episodes; however, driven by the series' popularity, he realized that there was more potential story than could be covered in that length, and was able to conceive an extension of the season 1 plot. Burns and the whole production team eventually quit their jobs and began to work full-time on the series; to generate revenue they created an online store to sell T-shirts.\n\nAfter the first season of \"Red vs. Blue\", Burns, voicing the character of Church, became a celebrity in the machinima community. As the director, writer, and lead actor of the series, he was the driving force behind the series. His series earned three awards at the 2003 Machinima Film Festival – Best Picture, Best Writing, and Best Independent Machinima Film – and was nominated for three others.\n\nThe series completed its original five season 100-episode run on June 28, 2007, collectively known as the \"Blood Gulch Chronicles\". Subsequent seasons were re-tooled with \"The Recollection Trilogy\" for seasons 6–8 (\"Reconstruction\", \"Recreation\", and \"Revelation\"), and \"The Freelancer Saga\" for seasons 9 and 10. Since season eleven, which premiered on June 14, 2013, Burns handed directorial and head writing duties to Miles Luna to shift his focus onto other projects. He still provides voice work for characters such as Church, Lopez and Vic.\n\nIn 2004, 13 months after the first season of \"Red vs. Blue\" had finished airing, Burns and Matt Hullum created the comedy web series \"The Strangerhood\". The series uses the same machinima technique used to film \"Red vs. Blue\".\n\nThe idea for the series came from the E3 gaming convention where Burns and his Rooster Teeth partners were introduced to the life simulation game \"The Sims 2\" and realized that the game would be suitable for a series that parodied reality television. The game's publisher Electronic Arts allowed them to continue with the project. The series centers on eight strangers who awake one day unaware of where they are or how they arrived there. Its first season of 17 episodes completed on April 27, 2006. In 2005, the group collaborated with Paul Marino on \"Strangerhood Studios\", a spin-off commissioned by the Independent Film Channel. This spin-off was the first machinima series to be commissioned for broadcast and won an award for Best Editing at the 2005 Machinima Film Festival.\n\nThe following year Burns and Rooster Teeth created the comic science fiction machinima mini-series \"P.A.N.I.C.S.\" based on and filmed using the video game \"F.E.A.R.\" developed by Monolith Productions, who asked them to produce the series for the Director's Edition of the game. The series consists of five episodes.\n\nThe story centers on a newcomer to Bravo Team, a special military group formed to battle supernatural enemies. As the series begins, Bravo Team has been sent into a military facility at night to investigate the reports of paranormal activity from within. This is a parody of the main scenario used in \"F.E.A.R.\"\n\nBurns first returned to live-action with \"Captain Dynamic\" a mini-series to promote the online game \"City of Heroes\". It was based around a team of writers hired to use the new in-game content creation tools to promote the title character, Captain Dynamic, the 'worst superhero in the world'. Directed by Matt Hullum and written by Burns, the series starred Ed Robertson of the Barenaked Ladies, who is a long time friend.\n\nThe series was well received by fans, which led him and Rooster Teeth to begin producing a new live-action series, titled \"Rooster Teeth Shorts\" (also referred to as \"RT Shorts\"), a sketch comedy which parodies life at their offices. The series features the staff of Rooster Teeth, including Burns, who all play caricatures of themselves, as well as occasional appearances from voice actors from some of their machinima series. The first season ran for twenty episodes and five seasons have since followed, as well as six-second mini episodes released exclusively through the video sharing service Vine.\n\nOn December 29, 2008 Burns co-hosted the inaugural episode of the \"Drunk Tank\" audio podcast, alongside his Rooster Teeth co-workers Geoff Ramsey and Gus Sorola. The podcast consists largely of comedic commentary on the popular culture of the week, including video games, recent news, website features, sports and upcoming projects and is available for download through iTunes, Zune Marketplace and their website. It has since become one of the more popular features of the site, at one point becoming the #1 most downloaded podcast on iTunes, as well as a featured podcast in the iTunes Store. New episodes have been released regularly every Wednesday since April 10, 2009, with occasional special episodes or multiple releases in one week.\n\nIn September 2011, the podcast was renamed \"The Rooster Teeth Podcast\". The show has since become available in video form and Burns continues to make regular appearances. On January 7, the podcast won \"Best Gaming Podcast\" at the 8th Annual Podcast Awards. The Rooster Teeth Podcast has recently adapted a new style of doing podcasts in which they live stream to \"sponsors\" on their website, in video, the night before the release of the audio podcast on iTunes and their site. The sponsor live stream is then later available 1 day on the Rooster website and 2 days later on YouTube.\n\nBurns began co-hosting \"Immersion\" alongside Griffon Ramsey in 2010. The show tests the concepts of video games in real life, such as whether the heckling that sometimes occurs in multiplayer video games would negatively affect the performance of real soldiers. Burns joked in \"The Rooster Teeth Podcast\" that the series started as an \"elaborate way for [them] to do fun stuff and get paid for it\". Geoff Ramsey and Gus Sorola were the test subjects throughout the first season. Gavin Free and Michael Jones (of Achievement Hunter) served as the test subjects for the second season.\n\nOn Halloween 2012, a partnership between Rooster Teeth and Blip was announced, with the premiere of their new 10-episode, reality game competition series sponsored by GEICO. \"The Gauntlet\" follows gamers from around the United States competing in contests of skills, concentration, agility and stamina, inspired by reality competitions \"Wipeout\" and \"The Voice\". The first season was hosted by Ali Baker and Burns. Season two was hosted by Burns and Joel Heyman and began on September 7, 2013.\n\nThe pilot episode of \"Million Dollars, But...\" premiered on May 21, 2015, with the series continuing on July 9, 2015. The ongoing series is frequently co-hosted by Burns and Gavin Free, with another special guest taking part. Each person has to come up with a typically difficult scenario, for example one where the person has to date Adolf Hitler for a year — which the cast comically re-enact — for which they will be given a million dollars.\n\nHis producing work includes executive producing the 2012 documentary film \"\", about the Swedish video game developer Mojang, the creators of the popular video game \"Minecraft\". In 2013, he began executive producing the anime-influenced web series \"RWBY\", created by Rooster Teeth employee Monty Oum. A second season premiered in 2014. Oum died on February 1, 2015. A third season of the show premiered on October 24, 2015. In 2014, Burns served as executive producer on the show \"X-Ray and Vav\", a cartoon web series starring two Achievement Hunter employees (a video gaming division of Rooster Teeth) Gavin Free and Ray Narvaez, Jr. In 2016, Burns and Gavin Free hosted the documentary \"World's Greatest Head Massage: An ASMR Journey\".\n\nIn June 2014, Rooster Teeth launched a crowdfunding campaign for the film \"Lazer Team\" on Indiegogo. The fundraiser reached its $650,000 goal in under 10 hours and broke Indiegogo's record for the fastest film campaign to reach $700,000. Within three days, \"Lazer Team\" broke $1 million. , \"Lazer Team\" held the record for the highest funded film campaign on Indiegogo with over $2.4 million collected.\n\nBurns explained during the campaign that as it makes more money, the film's budget scales up. \"The initial budget for talent was based on making the movie on the bare minimum with us throwing in the remainder of the expected budget. For instance, that meant using talent almost exclusively from in-house. As the budget grows, so do our opportunities to approach all kinds of talent. The same applies to Visual FX, quality of props and costuming, lighting, crew, etc.\" Burns co-wrote, co-produces, and co-stars in the film as Hagan. It was released in January 2016, making it among the first titles that Rooster Teeth's parent company, Fullscreen, will be distributing in its newly launched feature film division.\n\nBurns appeared in the 2015 short film, \"Hit\", as Officer Harris and the sports comedy-drama \"The Outfield\". Burns appeared in the YouTube Red series \"12 Deadly Days\" from Blumhouse Television.\n\nBurns has participated in two episodes of the improvisational comedy game show \"@midnight\". In 2015, Burns took part in twenty-eighth season of \"The Amazing Race\" with his fiancée, Ashley Jenkins, coming in fourth place. In 2017, Burns made a brief cameo in \"It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia\" as a bar patron with no lines. In September 2017, alongside Jenkins, he co-hosted the inaugural Purpose Awards, an expansion from the Streamy Awards.\n\nHe married Jordan Burns in August 2000 and divorced in December 2011. He mainly resides in Austin, Texas, after briefly spending time in Los Angeles, California. He is a member of the International Academy of Web Television. Burns became engaged to The Know host Ashley Jenkins in early 2016. They married in June 2019. They have a son, born on August 25, 2019.\n\n"}

A more general definition includes all positive rational numbers with this property.\n\nThe sequence of (integer) congruent numbers starts with\n\nFor example, 5 is a congruent number because it is the area of a (20/3, 3/2, 41/6) triangle. Similarly, 6 is a congruent number because it is the area of a (3,4,5) triangle. 3 and 4 are not congruent numbers.\n\nIf is a congruent number then is also a congruent number for any natural number (just by multiplying each side of the triangle by ), and vice versa. This leads to the observation that whether a nonzero rational number is a congruent number depends only on its residue in the group\n\nEvery residue class in this group contains exactly one square-free integer, and it is common, therefore, only to consider square-free positive integers, when speaking about congruent numbers.\n\nThe question of determining whether a given rational number is a congruent number is called the congruent number problem. This problem has not (as of 2019) been brought to a successful resolution. Tunnell's theorem provides an easily testable criterion for determining whether a number is congruent; but his result relies on the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture, which is still unproven.\n\nFermat's right triangle theorem, named after Pierre de Fermat, states that no square number can be a congruent number. However, in the form that every congruum (the difference between consecutive elements in an arithmetic progression of three squares) is non-square, it was already known (without proof) to Fibonacci. Every congruum is a congruent number, and every congruent number is a product of a congruum and the square of a rational number. However, determining whether a number is a congruum is much easier than determining whether it is congruent, because there is a parameterized formula for congrua for which only finitely many parameter values need to be tested.\n\n\"n\" is a congruent number if and only if\n\nformula_2, formula_3\n\nhas solutions (if so, then this equation has infinitely many solutions, like Pell's equation).\n\nGiven the solutions {x, y, z, t}, one can obtain the {a, b, c} such that \n\nformula_4, and formula_5\n\nfrom\n\nformula_6, formula_7, formula_8\n\nThe question of whether a given number is congruent turns out to be equivalent to the condition that a certain elliptic curve has positive rank. An alternative approach to the idea is presented below (as can essentially also be found in the introduction to Tunnell's paper).\n\nSuppose , , are numbers (not necessarily positive or rational) which satisfy the following two equations:\n\nThen set and\nA calculation shows\nand is not 0 (if then , so , but is nonzero, a contradiction).\n\nConversely, if and are numbers which satisfy the above equation and is not 0, set\n, and . A calculation shows these three numbers\nsatisfy the two equations for , , and above.\n\nThese two correspondences between (,) and (,) are inverses of each other, so\nwe have a one-to-one correspondence between any solution of the two equations in\n, , and and any solution of the equation in and with nonzero. In particular,\nfrom the formulas in the two correspondences, for rational we see that , , and are\nrational if and only if the corresponding and are rational, and vice versa.\n(We also have that , , and are all positive if and only if and are all positive;\nfrom the equation \nwe see that if and are positive then must be positive, so the formula for\n\nThus a positive rational number is congruent if and only if the equation\nIt can be shown (as an application of Dirichlet's theorem on primes in arithmetic progression)\nthat the only torsion points on this elliptic curve are those with equal to 0, hence the\nexistence of a rational point with nonzero is equivalent to saying the elliptic curve has positive rank.\nAnother approach to solving is to start with integer value of n denoted as N and solve \n\nwhere \n\nThe following is a list of the rational solution to formula_4 and formula_5 with congruent number \"n\" and the smallest \"c\". (we let \"a\" < \"b\", note that \"a\" cannot be = \"b\", because if so, then formula_15, but formula_16 is not rational number, thus \"c\" and \"a\" cannot be both rational numbers).\n\nMuch work has been done classifying congruent numbers.\n\nFor example, it is known that for a prime number , the following holds:\n\nIt is also known that in each of the congruence classes , for any given there are infinitely many square-free congruent numbers with prime factors.\n\n\n"}

The APG II system (2003; unchanged from the APG system of 1998), assigns it to the order Caryophyllales in the clade core eudicots.\n\nA phylogenetic study by Levin has justified the combination of \"Selinocarpus\" and \"Ammocodon\" into the genus \"Acleisanthes\". The genus \"Izabalea\" is now considered a synonym of \"Agonandra\", a genus in Opiliaceae.

He was the author of the first law of Czechoslovakia and creator of the country's currency, the Czechoslovakian koruna. Rašín was a representant of conservative liberalism and was mortally wounded in assassination for being viewed as a head of the nation's capitalism.\n\nRašín was born as a ninth child (from which 7 were alive) into the cottage in the outskirts of a small town Nechanice near Hradec Králové. His father František Rašín was a farmer, baker and a vendor of flour and cereals. His mother worked in their household and on the field. The family later bought a house in the town and another field. Later in life, Rašín described poor social reality in the area that was focused on the sugar industry. He also criticized the so-called \"\"harfenictví\"\": traveling musician groups connected to prostitution that expanded after the cancellation of the corvee. \n\nFrom 1878 to 1881, Rašín attended a gymnasium in Nový Bydžov and he spent the fourth year of the gymnasium in a German gymnasium in Broumov. He finished the last years of high school in the gymnasium of Hradec Králové and graduated there in 1886. In these years he became interested in politics into which he was guided by his father who in 1887 became the mayor of Nechanice. He was fourth of his brothers who started to study at university. The other two brothers pursued a job in the trade sector. Firstly, he studied at the Faculty of Medicine of Charles University (back then called Charles-Ferdinand) but he was forced to leave due to lung disease. He switched for Faculty of Law because there was an optional attendance at lectures and moved to the house of his sister in Krkonoše for rehabilitation. After two years he recuperated.\n\nIn 1888, Rašín returned to Prague to properly continue his studies. There he was actively participating in the student movement and three years later he participated at the Conference of Slavonic students with Antonín Hajn and Václav Klofáč. The Czech youth's opinions defied against the Austrian monarchy, police and the conservative Old Czech Party. Their most powerful instrument was the Magazine of Czech Students (), where they propagated the adoption of universal voting rights and greater national rights for Czech people. Rašín was supporting the National Freedom Party which is another name for the Young Czech Party that got into the Bohemian Diet and in 1891 into the Imperial Council.\n\nIn October of 1891, he graduated from his law studies at Charles University and continued in his political activity. In the day of the Emperor's Franz Joseph I of Austria arrival to Prague, Rašín published an anti-state legal-political text Czech State Law () in which he outlined the program of restoring the independent Czech state in the spirit of the democracy with the guarantees for the rights of the minorities. He joined service in the military in Hungarian Pest (where he was complaining about their cuisine) and passed an officer’s exams with the best results. But because of his previous controversial article that was confiscated by the police, he was threatened by prolonging his service in the military to two years in total and loss of his ranks.\n\nRašín returned from his military service in the fall of 1892 and started to work as an advocate concipient. He was elected the mayor of \"Slavia\": literary and rhetorical association of progressors that supported strengthening radicalism. He also published critical articles in journals New Flows of Ideas () and Prospects () like Study on the death penalty, Judicial independence, Political crimes according to the outline of the new Criminal Code, Reflections on the draft Criminal Code.\n\nDespite having little and questionable evidence against radical movements in Prague, the Austrian government declared a state of emergency in September of 1893 and started to arrest critical voices. In October Alois Rašín was taken to custody together with redactors and editorial staff of oppositional newspapers Antonín Hajn, Josef Škába, Antonín Pravoslav Veselý, Karel Stanislav Sokol, Stanislav Kostka Neumann, and others. Journals were banned and 70 people were arrested. The defendants in the process remembered as Omladina Trial were accused of the highest treason for conspiring against the state. In fact, the group called Omladina never existed. In January 1894 the trial began and Rašín was sentenced to 2 years unconditionally to prison in Bory (cell number 248). He lost his academic titles and civil rights.\n\nIn prison, he never asked for pardon and in his free time, he pursued learning French, English, reading, translating (translated English social-political text The Eight Hour Day), and studying national economic policies. In November 1894, his father became a member of the Imperial Council which is the highest legislative body of the pre-Litau part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire based in Vienna. When he returns, he was planning to stand against weakness and humanism of the realistic wing of the Young Czech Party represented by Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk. Young Czech Party was also denounced by supporters of the Czech Modernism like Josef Svatopluk Machar.\n\nRašín left prison after the amnesty in November 1895 and regain his academic titles. He returned to writing his critical anti-monarchic articles to Radical Newspaper, newly with a critique of Masaryk’s views. The Czech Progressive Movement divided to radically progressive around the journal Independence () and Antonín Hajn and to nationally progressive and statutory around Radical Newspaper which Rašín turned into a journal. In 1899, he was partially involved in the creation of a Radical Statutory Party officially named Czech Statutory Party () but left it year after when his son was born. He founded independent weekly newspaper Word () and created his own Law Office. As an advocate, Alois Rašín represented Živnobanka bank. \n\nThe weekly paper ended 1905 and together with the banker of Živnobanka Jan Preiss, Rašín entered in 1907 into the Young Czech Party, the second biggest burgheral party after agrarian. He was propagating universal suffrage and was trying to reform the party. Rašín was the first in Czech lands who introduced member legitimations, regional branch offices, paid regional secretary and party cash register with regular contributions. He sided with Karel Kramář and František Fiedler and founded Party’s journal Day (). With Kramář he gained Czech newspapers National Newspaper in 1910. Rašín, new editor-in-chief, Preiss and Antonín Pimper were writing about economic policy. In elections 1911 to Bohemian Diet, they were second after social democrats and he also got into Imperial Council as a member for the district Bohemia 31 – Klatovy. He joined Council’s Czech Club. In 1914 he published text Political Crimes () dealing with jurisdiction, consequences of punishment and imprisonment of political prisoners.\n\nAfter the start of the Great War, Rašín sided with the anti-monarchy voices in the country but realized that parliament parties don’t matter anymore. Přemysl Šámal together with Edvard Beneš, Karel Kramář, Václav Klofáč, Alois Rašín and later Antonín Švehla created a resistance group Maffia, inspired by Sicilian Mafia. They created the so-called National Council () that financed foreign resistance led by Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk. The consequences got to them in July 1916 when Rašín was arrested, taken into custody in Vienna and charged for treason and espionage. The process with Alois Rašín, Karel Kramář, journalist and translator Vincenc Červinka, and accountant of the malt house Zdeněk Zamazal lasted from December 1915 to July 1916 with the result of the death penalty. Later in the same year, Emperor Franz Joseph I and after him, Charles I died, and punishments were changed to 10 years in Austrian Möllersdorf. Alois Rašín shared a cell with Karel Kramář. During the time in the prison, Rašín wrote text National Economy (), which was published later in 1921. His Imperial Council Member’s mandate was taken away from him in June of 1917. Next month, the amnesty was announced. \n\nAfter his return from prison, viewed as a national hero, he immediately started to be politically active. He regained his Doctor of Laws academic title (JUDr.). In 1918, the Young Czech Party merged with the Statutory Progressive Party, Moravian People's Progressive Party and some part of the Progressive Party (Realists) with the common name the Czech Statutory Democracy. The Old Czech Party joined in the next year. As a party chairman was elected Karel Kramář. Rašín was part of the party’s leadership that set its goals: support of social justice but rejection of the socialism as such, support of Czech nationalism and democracy, the need for strong control state, police, army and the large state apparatus. It promoted secularization, but with the preservation of freedom of religion and a strong influence of Christian morality, it also promoted solidarity and education. It was supposed to be oriented on the United States of America, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and Czarist Russia. The National Newspaper continued to be the party’s newspapers.\n\nIn July 1918, the National Committee of Czechoslovakia () was formed to overtake the power in the country and to create new laws. Karel Kramář was Chairman, Antonín Švehla Vice-Chairman, František Soukup Managing Director and Alois Rašín Member of the Board. In the night from 27th to 28th, Vlastimil Tusar called Rašín from Vienna and said that Czech politics needs to go to the front and support fighters in endurance and not leaving. He knew that this is a sign of surrender. Rašín said: \"“I was convinced that it will burst tomorrow.”\" In the morning, Rašín met Švehla and others from the National Assembly. After they received Andrássyho nóta (recognition of nations to self-determination), they decided to take the power before surrender. Today, Alois Rašín is remembered as one of the Men of the 28th October (with Antonín Švehla, Jiří Stříbrný, Vavro Šrobár, František Soukup), who together declared an independent Czechoslovakian state. Rašín was the first one who publicly announced the state in the place of National Assembly, he also was the author of the first law which established an independent state. \n\nIn November 1918, the Revolutionary National Assembly was formed. On the first meeting, the members elected Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk as the President of the Republic and appointed Karel Kramář Prime Minister. Alois Rašín was firstly supposed to be the Interior Minister but for his knowledge in economics, he was needed to take the Ministry of Finance because state finances were devastated by inflation. Journalist Ferdinand Peroutka pointed out that Rašín was not a pure economist but he has more political experience than for example Rašín’s opponent doctor Karel Engliš. January 1919, Alois Rašín wrote to Edvard Beneš: \"The population thinks that freedom means not paying taxes, no one is doing anything from executions, so I don't know how economics could be managed further,\" but at the same time state is relied on as on the solver of all problems. \n\nAs a Minister for Finance, Alois Rašín had efforts to back his proposed currency by gold. For that, he announced nationwide voluntary collection, where 64 kilograms of pure gold was obtained. At the beginning of 1919, Rašín closed borders and the isolated whole country from 26 February to 9 March and started to stamp all money from which he withholds some part as a government loan. For that 2 weeks, he was given rule over police and army. The goal was to disconnect currencies, lower volume of money in circulation and subordinate emission policy to a newly created state bank. After the left won the elections in 1919, Vladimír Tusar was appointed Prime Minister and Rašín became only Member of the Parliament.\n\nThe second Vladimír Tusar’s government was established in 1920 after the Constitution of Czechoslovakia was approved. Rašín still got a mandate for Czechoslovakian National Democracy that was also part of the Committee of Five (). In the same year, Alois Rašín published his book My Finance Plan () describing Czechoslovakian financial history from Austria-Hungary till present days. Two years later he followed up with publications Financial and Economic Policy until the End of 1921 (), and Inflation and Deflation (). He was appointed Ministry for Finance in the government of Antonín Švehla and introduced many measures against social benefits. He also criticized monetary compensations for legionary?. Amidst an economic crisis, Rašín stressed the politics of deflation (in 1922 prices dropped by 42%, salaries by 32%) and a strong currency. High unemployment caused great animosity towards him, especially from the left. A fierce anti-Rašín campaign developed. \n\nIn his last days of politics, Rašín got into conflict with his colleagues about deflationary measures. President Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk was planning to remove Alois Rašín from his office. In the morning of 5 January 1923, Alois Rašín came out of his apartment in Žitná street house number 8 and was shot to his back and side when trying to get in the ministry car. He died after a long period of suffering on 18 February 1923. The assassin was young anarcho-communist Josef Šoupal who confessed and told that he was planning to kill other representants of Czechoslovakian capitalism Jaroslav Preiss and Karel Kramář. Because he was younger than 21 years, he wasn’t sentenced to death but imprisoned for 18 years in Kartouz. The assassination was condemned by the president and many anti-socialist laws were introduced.\n\nRašín married Karla Jánská from Prague’s Smíchov in 1899. His wife’s brother Jan Jánský was the discoverer of the blood groups. Alois Rašín had three children with his wife Karla: Ladislav (1900), Miroslav (1901) and Ludmila (1904). His son Ladislav continued in his father’s footsteps as a politician. He was part of the resistance against the Nazis. Gestapo arrested him in 1938. He died in a prison in Nazi Germany a few days before the American troops came.\n\nAccording to Ferdinand Peroutka, Alois Rašín was a thrifty man and Minister of Finance that was very cautious every time someone demanded some portion of the governmental budget. He was workaholic and demand the same from his surroundings. He had also uncompromising and hot-headed nature. One time when Germans demanded bigger autonomy, he stuck out his tongue and call them monkeys. Rašín lived ascetic life avoiding any dance or sport.\n\n\n\n"}

It was opened in 1869 and closed in 1916.\n\nFor much of its existence, the station was also served by the Metropolitan Railway (MR; the precursor to today's Metropolitan line) and the Great Western Railway (GWR). Its site was adjacent to another station named Hammersmith, which today is served by the Circle and Hammersmith & City lines.\n\nLSWR trains serving Hammersmith (Grove Road) ran from Waterloo via Addison Road (now called Kensington (Olympia)) to Richmond. MR and GWR trains ran from Paddington via the Hammersmith & City Railway (HCR; now the Hammersmith & City line) and also on to Richmond.\n\nHammersmith (Grove Road), as it was officially named but often referred to as simply Hammersmith, was opened on 1 January 1869 by the LSWR on a new branch line from a junction with the West London Joint Railway (WLJR) north of Addison Road to Richmond via Turnham Green.\nTo the north of Hammersmith (Grove Road) the line ran parallel with the HCR before passing under the line and turning through a wide arc south of Shepherd's Bush before reaching the WLJR at a southward pointing junction. To the west of the station, the line became what is now the District line to Richmond, starting just to the east of Ravenscourt Park.\n\nIn 1870, Grove Junction was built north of the station connecting the HCR and LSWR tracks, enabling GWR trains on the HCR to access Hammersmith (Grove Road) and run on to Richmond. However, the GWR service ran for only a few months during 1870.\n\nIn June 1877, the District Railway (DR; now the District line) opened an extension from its own Hammersmith station to a junction (Studland Road Junction) to connect to the LSWR tracks east of Ravenscourt Park. From 1 October 1877, the MR began to run trains through Hammersmith (Grove Road) to Richmond. From 1 January 1894, the GWR also initiated services along this route.\n\nThe more direct route of the DR into central London had a competitive advantage over the other operators of the Richmond service and gradually the other railway companies ended their operations on the Richmond branch. MR services ended on 31 December 1906, shortly after the HCR tracks from Paddington were electrified. GWR services continued until 31 December 1910 and LSWR services continued until 3 June 1916 when the loop line between the Studland Road Junction and Addison Road was closed. The section west of the junction remains part of the District line.\n\nIn 1919 the Central London Railway (CLR; today's Central line) published plans to build a tunnelled link from west of its Shepherd's Bush station to the disused tracks north of the station so that it might run trains to Richmond via Hammersmith (Grove Road) and Turnham Green. Although authorisation was granted in 1920, the connection was never realised.\n\nHammersmith (Grove Road) was demolished and the loop line to the WLJR was removed, although remnants of the viaduct at the Studland Road Junction where the LSWR tracks turned north-east are still visible west of the current Hammersmith station on the District and Piccadilly lines. The station site is now occupied by an office block on Hammersmith Grove.\n"}
{"id": "2334793", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2334793", "title": "Protichnites", "text": "Protichnites\n\nProtichnites is an ichnogenus of trace fossil consisting of the imprints made by the walking activity of certain arthropods. It consists of two rows of tracks and a medial furrow between the two rows. This furrow, which may be broken, set at an angle, and of varying width and depth, is thought to be the result of the tail region contacting the substrate.\n\nSir Richard Owen, the noted British paleontologist and anatomist who coined the term “Dinosauria”, based \"Protichnites\" on trackways that were shipped to him from the Cambrian Potsdam Sandstone of Quebec. He was correct in recognizing that these were the oldest known footprints on land, having been produced in intertidal and supratidal environments during what would now be called Cambrian times.\n\nOwen first thought that these trackways were made by tortoises, but new material convinced him that “articulates” (a group that included the arthropods) were responsible. He further suggested a kinship with \"Limulus\", the modern horseshoe crab. Additional material was collected in Quebec, Ontario, New York, Wisconsin, and Missouri for the next 150 years without a single fossil of the maker of these traces. Finally, body fossils of potential makers were found in two of the same quarries that preserved \"Protichnites\" from the Elk Mound Group of Blackberry Hill, Wisconsin, and the Potsdam Group of Melocheville, Quebec. The animals, \"Mosineia macnaughtoni\" and \"Mictomerus melochevillensis\", were euthycarcinoids, extinct arthropods that may have given rise to the mandibulates. Fossils that clearly tie euthycarcinoids to \"Protichnites\" were then found at Blackberry Hill.\n\nIt is possible that other extinct arthropods, such as members of the Aglaspidida, may also have produced some of these trackways. Trilobites have been suggested as well; however, no trilobites have been found thus far in the strata that contain this ichnogenus. Similar trackways are present in post-Cambrian strata; however, those are seldom referred to as \"Protichnites\".\n\nIt has been suggested that one form of \"Protichnites\", \"P. eremita\" Form 1, may have been produced by an ambulating pair of individuals, as in amplexus. In this form, the medial furrow is discontinuous and each section is set at an angle, such that the series of medial imprints have a shingled appearance, as might result if the female were displacing her tail to minimize its interference with external fertilization. A second set of medial imprints observed in Form 1 is postulated to have been produced by the tail region of the male of the pair. \"Protichnites eremita\" was originally interpreted as early evidence of hermit crab-like behavior.\n\nDiffering only in the presence or absence of a medial furrow, \"Protichnites\" and \"Diplichnites\" trackways could both be produced by the same individual animal. In cases where the feet penetrate the sediment more deeply than does the tail, \"Diplichnites\" could be created on the underlying layer while \"Protichnites\" is being produced on the surface.\n\n\n"}

She made portraits of children and adults, including studies of nature as she found it. Instead of using a camera, more than 300 pen and ink sketchbooks catalog insights into her life, including her civil and human rights activism of the 1960s and 1970s. One of the many important captured events included the Washington D.C. event where Martin Luther King, Jr. first gave his \"I Have a Dream\" speech. Her painting \"Homage to Martin Luther King\" hangs in the (NAACP) National Association for the Advancement of Colored People's headquarters. She created illustrations for children's books and painted a mural in the Works Progress Administration (WPA) for the Johns Hopkins Hospital's Harriet Lane Home for Children. Her works have been exhibited in solo and group exhibitions since the 1930s. In 1999, she was posthumously awarded to the State of Maryland's Women's Hall of Fame, as the first woman artist they recognized.\n\nFlorence Riefle was born in Baltimore, Maryland to parents James Henry Riefle and Florence Riefle. She was the only artist in a musically talented family. Bahr grew up later in Homeland, but first in Forest Park, Maryland and graduated from Forest Park High School.\n\nShe met Leonard Marion Bahr, a portrait painter, who was her teacher at the Maryland Institute in 1930. She sometimes modeled for his portrait studies. In 1934, the couple married and subsequently, over the course of a decade, had three children: Beth, Leonard, Jr., and Mary\n\nThe newly married Bahr couple first lived in Baltimore City in a studio apartment on a third floor. In an article about her, Florence said that she was mostly interested in her husband and painting; that they both \"would rather paint than eat.\" She also mentioned a few shared recreational interests: horseback riding, hiking and swimming.\n\nBy 1940, Florence and Leonard were gaining recognition for their art, exhibitions and teaching abilities in Baltimore. During World War II, Leonard joined the Navy March 1, 1943, as a naval officer and was released on December 23, 1945. In 1947, the couple moved to an historic home on Old Lawyers Hill Road, an historic hilltop district in Elkridge, Howard County, Maryland and in the 1960s, Leonard had a newer house built on the same property, with each their own studios attached.\n\nFlorence Bahr died in a house fire, which resulting water damage destroyed a few, but not all, of her sketches. She suffered a tragic and needless local contractor-related death.\n\nConcerned about civil and human rights, Florence became involved in these human rights causes—like children's welfare - as in the Black Panther breakfast programs for inner-city children; women's rights; and anti-war and anti-nuclear issues, as well as stopping African apartheid. She championed various activists like the Berrigan brothers, Albert Schweitzer, Tom Dooley, and anyone who stood up for the poor. She campaigned for public officials' attention on the issues that concerned her via telephone calls and letter-writing campaigns; participated in political marches, civil rights demonstrations, and attended trials. She was arrested at a big May Day anti-war demonstration at The Pentagon.\n\nBahr also sketched important events that she witnessed, like the trials of former Governor Marvin Mandel and the Catonsville Nine. She also had important images of key national and state marches and demonstrations. From many of these and other events, she donated more than 300 sketchbooks to the Maryland State Archives.\n\nIn 1927 she attended Dickinson College. The next year she enrolled in the Maryland Institute College of Art (MICA) and took an aggressive course schedule to earn a Costume Design diploma in 1930. The following year she earned the James Young Memorial Prize Award and a diploma in Fine Arts.\n\nShe enrolled in 1959 at the Catonsville Community College to study German and Biology. In 1962 received her Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in painting at MICA and in 1967 she received a Master of Fine Arts in Education and Printmaking.\n\nBahr created sketches, oil and watercolor paintings, lithographs, sculptures, book illustrations, collages and constructions with found objects. Woodcuts, etchings, monoprints and linocuts were also methods she explored. She worked with pastels and inks. She exhibited extensively. Her creations were her daily life. Her painting of a sunflower was a free and spontaneous work, something reminiscent of Expressionism. She made many portraits of children, like her grandson, and numerous ones of her children as they grew up. Her portraits illustrated the essence of a person's character without \"striving for prettiness\". Working in multiple media, she often incorporated natural elements - like pebbles, a shell, a feather or other found objects.\n\nFrom about 1931 to 1936, Bahr wrote and created pen and ink or watercolor illustrations for her or other author's children's books. As noted before, in the WPA program she painted a mural for the Harriet Lane Home for Children at the Johns Hopkins Hospital. Her works were shown in 1935 at the Baltimore Museum of Art, two years later she received her first award from the museum. In 1936, both Florence and Leonard's works were exhibited at the Maryland Institute in a joint exhibition, which some interested viewers were Hollywood actress Mae West and actor Dick Powell, who commented in the exhibit guest book, that he thought the exhibited work \"very good.\" . Florence continued to exhibit her works there and receive additional awards. Her portrait of an African-American woman, \"Lily,\" was shown at the 1936 New York exhibition of the National Association of Women Painters and Sculptors. After having become a member, Bahr created oil paintings with greater frequency.\n\nOf the many sketches that Bahr recorded from 1957 to 1992 of her experiences, she captured the Martin Luther King, Jr.'s Washington, D.C. \"I Have a Dream\" speech, the Catonsville Nine courtroom trial, a march on The Pentagon, the trial of Governor Marvin Mandel, and Robert Kennedy's funeral.\n\nShe created the \"Homage to Martin Luther King\" to help manage her feelings of his death and the resulting riots. It was displayed in the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People's (NAACP) Baltimore headquarters. Prior to her death, Bahr had presented it to that organization which she worked with in the 1960s and 1970s.\n\nBahr's art is in private and public collections in Europe, Japan and throughout the United States, including Baltimore Museum of Art, who has a color woodcut \"Indian Girl\" made in 1969. The Peabody Galleria Piccola held a retrospective exhibit of her works when she was 87 years old.\n\nBahr collected antique dolls and made more than 200 watercolor portraits of the dolls. She opened a museum in Ellicott City called the \"Humpty Dumpty Museum of Dolls and Toys,\" as well as engaging as an antique dealer in the same city.\n\nShe participated in many solo and group exhibitions:\n\n\n\n\nIn her book \"Women of Achievement in Maryland History,\" author Carolyn Stegman wrote:\n\n\nIn addition, The Maryland State Archives (Florence R.

The game takes place during World War II. Player can choose single or instant mission, or choose to take a career path in United States Army Air Forces, United States Navy, United States Marines, Imperial Japanese Army or Imperial Japanese Navy. Its success caused Dynamix to create a very similar follow-up \"Aces Over Europe\" in 1993.\n\n\"Aces of the Pacific\" features various warplanes of the era, such as the F6F Hellcat and the Zero. The game includes historical missions, should the player choose to play them during the course of their career or as a single mission. Historical missions include the Japanese Navy's surprise Attack on Pearl Harbor, defense of Pearl Harbor by a handful of Army Air Corps P-40 Warhawks based at Wheeler Field, fighter/bomber combat during the Battle of Midway, the Battle of Leyte Gulf, the Battle of Coral Sea, and the mission to shoot down Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto after deciphering Japanese messages of his scheduled plans to visit island bases.\n\nNumerous World War II aces make an appearance in the game, and the player can fly either with them or against them through the course of his or her career. Dick Bong, Thomas McGuire, David McCampbell, Joe Foss, and Pappy Boyington are some of the American aces that appear in the game. Accomplished aces of the Imperial Japanese Navy such as Hiroyoshi Nishizawa, Tetsuzo Iwamoto, and Saburo Sakai also take to the skies of the Pacific.\n\nIf the \"1946 Expansion Pack\" is installed, at the end of the war, the player may choose to continue in an alternate history in which atomic bombs were never used on Japan. The game calls the campaign Operation Coronet, the planned invasion of Japan. This extra campaign contains numerous prototype aircraft that were developed before the war's end but never saw combat in World War II.\n\n\"Aces of the Pacific\" was a commercial hit, with sales of 350,000 units.\n\n\"Computer Gaming World\"s Doug Fick in September 1992 called \"Aces of the Pacific\" \"simultaneously awesome and disappointing.\" The reviewer praised the graphics, documentation, and gameplay, but found that even a fast computer could not run the software with sufficient performance, the AI enemies and sound were inferior to those of \"Red Baron\", and that aircraft performance was unrealistic. He concluded that \"\"Aces of the Pacific\" is 80% 'battle-ready'\" and hoped that the developer would \"provide that extra 20%.\" In December, Fick reported that Dynamix had significantly improved performance without sacrificing graphics, and also improved opponents' AI, sound, and aircraft realism. He concluded that \"as updated, \"Aces of the Pacific\" lives up to its tremendous advanced billing and is now superior to \"Red Baron\".\" In March 1993 Fick reported that he enjoyed the \"WWII: 1946\" expansion disk, but wished that it included a mission builder as with \"Red Baron\". He concluded that \"It serves as a nice addition ... but is not essential\". A 1993 wargame survey by the magazine gave the game four stars out of five, calling it \"\"the\" flight simulator of World War II\". The game received 5 out of 5 stars in \"Dragon\".\n\nIn 1994 \"PC Gamer US\" named \"Aces of the Pacific\" the 12th best computer game ever. The editors wrote, \"With its unsurpassed variety of aircraft and mission types, \"Aces of the Pacific\" may well be the most gratifying air-combat simulation ever made.\" In 1996 \"Computer Gaming World\" ranked it as the 47th best game of all time, for setting \"new standards for graphics and performance.\" In 2003 IGN ranked it as the 92nd top game, stating: \"Realism, aircraft, technology, multiplayer and many ways to kill many a folk made \"Aces of the Pacific\" an immediate hit. (...) Better flight sims have come and gone, but this was one of the first truly glorious ones and its brand is still burnt in our minds.\"\n"}

Notable among its founders was Peadar O'Donnell, former editor of \"An Phoblacht\" and a leading far-left figure in the IRA. Saor Éire described itself as \"an organization of workers and working farmers\". \n\nIt has been suggested that the support of the then IRA chief of staff, Moss (Maurice) Twomey, was instrumental in the organisation's establishment. However, Tim Pat Coogan claimed that Twomey was doubtful about the organisation, worrying about involvement in electoral politics and possible communist influence.\n\nDuring its short existence Saor Éire used the republican publication \"An Phoblacht\", under the editorship of Frank Ryan, to report on its progress and to promote its far-left republican views.\n\nOn the weekend of 26 to 27 of September 1931, Saor Éire held its first conference in Dublin at Iona Hall. One hundred and fifty delegates from both the Irish Free State and Northern Ireland attended the conference against a background of police raids on the houses and offices connected with Saor Éire and \"An Phoblacht\". Seán Hayes was chairman, while David Fitzgerald acted as secretary.\n\nThe conference elected an executive of Hayes, Fitzgerald, Sean McGuinness, May Laverty, Helena Molony, Sheila Dowling, Sheila Humphreys, D. McGinley, Mick Fitzpatrick, Seán MacBride, Michael Price, Peadar O'Donnell, Mick Hallissey, M. O'Donnell, Patrick McCormack, Tom Kenny, L. Brady, Nicholas Boran, John Mulgrew and Tom Maguire. George Gilmore and Frank Ryan were also involved.\n\nThe constitution elaborated upon the aims by describing a two-phase programme. The first phase was described as being one of organisation and propagandising in order to organise a solid front for mass resistance to the oppressors. This would build upon the day-to-day resistance and activity towards \"rents, annuities, evictions, seizures, bank sales, lock-outs, strikes and wage-cuts.\" This challenge, it was believed, would lead to power passing from the hands of the imperialists to the masses. The second phase was one of consolidation of power through the organisation of the economy and a workers' and working farmers' republic.\n\nIdeologically Saor Éire adhered to the Irish socialist republicanism developed by James Connolly and Peadar O'Donnell. As a consequence of the heavy influence of O'Donnell, Saor Éire strongly advocated the revival of Gaelic culture and the involvement of the poorer rural working communities in any rise against the Irish capitalist institutions and British imperialism.\n\nSean McBride described the organisation at its launch like this:\nThe organisation was attacked by the centre-right press and the Catholic Church as a dangerous communist group, and was quickly banned by the Free State government. The strength of reaction against it prevented it becoming an effective political organisation. O'Donnell and his supporters would attempt a similar initiative two years later with the establishment of the Republican Congress in 1933.\n\nThe constitution listed the organisation’s objectives as being:\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2334831", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2334831", "title": "Ryan Fitzpatrick", "text": "Ryan Fitzpatrick\n\nRyan Joseph Fitzpatrick (born November 24, 1982), nicknamed Fitzmagic, is an American football quarterback for the Miami Dolphins of the National Football League (NFL). He was drafted by the St. Louis Rams in the seventh round of the 2005 NFL Draft. He played college football at Harvard and was the first quarterback in school history to rush for over 1,000 yards in a career.\n\nA journeyman quarterback, Fitzpatrick is known for his tenure on eight teams during his career, starting at least one game for the Rams, Cincinnati Bengals, Buffalo Bills, Tennessee Titans, Houston Texans, New York Jets, Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and Miami Dolphins. He is the only player in NFL history to throw a touchdown pass with eight different teams. With the Buccaneers in 2018, Fitzpatrick became the first quarterback in NFL history to throw 400 yards or more in three straight games.\nWhile an economics student at Harvard, Fitzpatrick had five starts during the 2001 and 2002 seasons, working as the backup for Neil Rose. In 2001, he amassed deep passing yards and a pair of touchdowns. He followed that in 2002 by collecting 1,155 yards, eight touchdowns, and no interceptions. He also ran for five scores and 523 yards that year.\n\nFitzpatrick took over the starting job in 2003 following Rose's graduation. Fitzpatrick finished his junior campaign with 1,770 yards, 16 touchdowns and eight interceptions in seven games. Additionally, he ran for 430 yards and six rushing touchdowns, leading his team to a 7–3 record.\n\nIn 2004, Fitzpatrick was named the Ivy League Player of the Year, and winner of the George H. \"Bulger\" Lowe Award, as he accumulated 1,986 yards with 13 touchdowns and six interceptions. He also led Harvard to a 10–0 record, thus winning the Ivy League Championship. He ranked second on the team with 448 rushing yards and five scores.\n\nFor his career, Fitzpatrick connected on 384 of 641 passes (59.9 percent) for 5,234 yards, 39 touchdowns and 21 interceptions. He collected 1,487 yards with 16 scores on 365 carries (4.1 avg.) and totaled 6,721 yards, an average of 224.0 yards per game, while seeing action in 30 contests. He ranks second on Harvard's career list for pass completions, touchdowns, yards passing and pass completion percentage, topped only by Neil Rose (5,949 yards, 41 touchdowns, 455 completions, 62.4 percent, 1998–2002). His 641 pass attempts rank fourth in school history. His 1,006 total plays for 6,721 yards in total offense broke the old school career records of 1,005 plays by Mike Giardi (1991–93) and 6,519 yards by Rose.\n\nAs is the case for most incoming NFL rookies, Fitzpatrick took the Wonderlic test. Rumors have indicated that Fitzpatrick recorded a 50 on the test in nine minutes, signifying a perfect score. However, according to a \"The Wall Street Journal\" report that appeared in the September 30, 2005, edition, Fitzpatrick scored a 48 on the exam, not a 50—still considered an exceptionally high score, but the claim that he completed the test in nine minutes is accurate. While his actual score is unknown, he has acknowledged that he left at least one question blank. As the Wonderlic score is the number of correct answers to 50 questions, the best he could have scored would be a 49. To date, Fitzpatrick has the highest Wonderlic Test score ever achieved among NFL quarterbacks. The only player to earn a verified perfect score on the Wonderlic test was also a Harvard graduate: wide receiver/punter Pat McInally, who played his entire career with the Cincinnati Bengals.\n\nThe St. Louis Rams selected Fitzpatrick in the seventh round (250th overall) of the 2005 NFL Draft. Fitzpatrick was the last of 14 quarterbacks drafted in 2005. \n\nOn July 18, 2005, the St. Louis Rams signed Fitzpatrick to a three-year, $953,000 contract. Throughout training camp, Fitzpatrick competed for a roster spot against Jeff Smoker to be the Rams' third-string quarterback. Head coach Mike Martz named Fitzpatrick the third-string quarterback on the depth chart to begin his rookie season, behind Marc Bulger and Jamie Martin. Fitzpatrick was upgraded to the primary backup role in Week 6 after Marc Bulger sustained a shoulder injury and was subsequently placed on injured reserve for the remainder of the season.\n\nOn November 27, 2005, Fitzpatrick made his professional regular season debut after entering the game in the second quarter against the Houston Texans to replace injured veteran journeyman Jamie Martin. Fitzpatrick led the Rams from a 24–3 halftime deficit to a 33–27 overtime win, throwing for 310 yards and three touchdowns, completing 63.3% of his passes and 117.4 QB rating for the game. He earned NFC Offensive Player of the Week for his effort. This made Fitzpatrick one of only eight players who passed for more than 300 yards in their NFL debut. The win earned him the next three starts, making Fitzpatrick the first Harvard quarterback to start an NFL game. Fitzpatrick was unable to duplicate his debut performance in the games he started with the Rams coming two weeks later in a 13–27 loss to the Minnesota Vikings in which he threw for 235 yards, no touchdowns, and five interceptions for a QB rating of 32.4 for the game. He was replaced by Martin after halftime the following week, after struggling in a home game against the Philadelphia Eagles in which he completed just 41.7% of his passes for a total of 69 yards. He finished his rookie season with 76 pass completions of 135 pass attempts (56.3%) for 777 passing yards with four touchdowns and eight interceptions in four games with three starts.\n\nIn 2006, Fitzpatrick only appeared in one game, which was in the season finale against the Minnesota Vikings. He appeared late in the game in relief of Marc Bulger and ran out the clock of the 41–21 victory.\n\nOn September 1, 2007, Fitzpatrick was traded to the Bengals for a seventh-round pick in the 2008 NFL Draft. He recorded no meaningful statistics in his third professional season.\n\nA restricted free agent in the 2008 offseason, Fitzpatrick signed his one-year tender offer from the Bengals on April 17. Due to an elbow injury to starting quarterback Carson Palmer, Fitzpatrick made his first Bengals start on September 28, 2008, against the Cleveland Browns. Fitzpatrick was not only the leading passer but also the leading rusher in the Bengals' 20–12 loss. Palmer returned the next week to start against the Dallas Cowboys, but once again had to sit the following week to rest his sore elbow. On October 12, 2008, Fitzpatrick got the start against the New York Jets, and every other game for the remainder of that season.\n\nDuring the 2008 season, Fitzpatrick ranked third in rushing yards among quarterbacks with 304, finishing behind Tyler Thigpen and David Garrard.\n\nOn February 27, 2009, Fitzpatrick signed with the Buffalo Bills on a 3-year $7.405 million contract. He made his first appearance on October 18, 2009 against the New York Jets when starter Trent Edwards went down with an injury, leading the Bills to a 16–13 overtime win, while throwing for 116 yards with a touchdown and an interception. Fitzpatrick started the following two games, resulting in a win over the Carolina Panthers and loss to the Houston Texans.\n\nOn November 18, 2009, he was named the starting quarterback of the Buffalo Bills by interim head coach Perry Fewell who took over the coaching duties after former head coach Dick Jauron was fired. He went 3–3 as a starter under Fewell, throwing seven touchdowns, six interceptions and 1,060 yards. Overall, Fitzpatrick went 5–4 in games in which he had a majority of the playing time for a team that finished with a 6–10 record. In Week 11 of the 2009 season in a game against the Jacksonville Jaguars, Fitzpatrick threw a 98-yard touchdown pass to Terrell Owens, the longest touchdown reception and pass for both Owens and Fitzpatrick, also setting the team record for the longest touchdown pass. The Bills went on to lose to the Jaguars 18–15. Overall, in the 2009 season, Fitzpatrick finished with 1,422 passing yards, nine touchdowns, and ten interceptions.\n\nDespite the strong showing, new head coach Chan Gailey decided to go with Trent Edwards as the starter for the 2010 season, relegating Fitzpatrick to the backup role. On September 20, 2010, Fitzpatrick was named the new starting quarterback following the Bills 0–2 start.\n\nIn a 49–31 comeback win over the Cincinnati Bengals, Fitzpatrick threw for 316 yards and four touchdowns, including three to Stevie Johnson. This performance marked the first time in NFL history that a team had come back from 17 points down to win by 18 or more. Despite the Bills finishing at 4–12 (4–9 with him at quarterback), Fitzpatrick had a breakout season in 2010, recording at least one touchdown pass in 13 consecutive games and becoming the first Bills quarterback to pass for at least 3,000 yards in a season since J. P. Losman in 2006.\n\nDuring Week 2 in the 2011 season, Fitzpatrick led the Bills to touchdown drives on five straight possessions in the second half to rally past the Oakland Raiders. It was the first time in league history a team had scored offensive touchdowns on five straight possessions in the second half. In the 2011 season, Fitzpatrick was named the AFC Offensive Player of the Month for September. On October 28, 2011, Fitzpatrick signed a six-year, $59 million contract extension including a $10 million signing bonus with the Bills. He had three 300-yard performances in the 2011 season, with a season-high 369 yards against the New England Patriots. After the 2011 season, it was revealed that Fitzpatrick had broken his ribs in a game against the Washington Redskins, which was presumably a factor in his decline in play over the rest of the season. Fitzpatrick finished the 2011 season with 3,832 yards and 24 touchdowns, but threw a league-leading 23 interceptions.\n\nFitzpatrick returned as the Bills' starter during the 2012 season, throwing for 3,400 yards, 24 touchdowns, and 16 interceptions. Following Chan Gailey's firing after the season, the Bills opted not to hold on to Fitzpatrick, releasing him on March 12, 2013.\n\nOn March 18, 2013, Fitzpatrick signed a two-year contract with the Tennessee Titans. He replaced Jake Locker for the Titans in Week 4 due to an injury in the third quarter. Fitzpatrick completed 3 of his 8 passes for 108 yards, which included a 77-yard touchdown pass to Nate Washington, in a 38–13 win against the New York Jets.\n\nFitzpatrick played in 11 games and started 9 of them. He finished the season with a 3–6 record as the starting quarterback, beating division rivals the Jacksonville Jaguars and the Houston Texans in the final two games of the season. He completed the season throwing for 2,454 yards with 14 touchdowns and 12 interceptions.\n\nFitzpatrick was released on March 14, 2014, and replaced by Charlie Whitehurst.\n\nOn March 18, 2014, Fitzpatrick signed a two-year contract with the Houston Texans. He was named the Texans' starting quarterback by new Head Coach Bill O'Brien on June 17, but was demoted to second on the Texans' depth chart on November 5, 2014, being replaced by Ryan Mallett.\n\nOn November 23, 2014, Mallett tore his pectoral muscle and Fitzpatrick was renamed the starter. On November 30, in a 45–21 win against the Tennessee Titans in Week 13, Fitzpatrick threw for a franchise-record six touchdowns and 358 yards with no interceptions and a 147.5 passer rating. He earned AFC Offensive Player of the Week for his effort against the Titans.\n\nOn December 14, 2014, during the second quarter against the Indianapolis Colts, Fitzpatrick scrambled for a two-yard gain, was tripped up, and ended up with a fractured left tibia, ending his season. He was replaced by rookie Tom Savage, who also received a minor injury, and the Texans lost 10–17. Despite his season-ending injury, Fitzpatrick had a solid season, throwing for 2,483 yards with 17 touchdowns and 8 interceptions for a then career-high 95.3 passer rating. He finished the season with a 6–6 record as the starting quarterback for the Texans.\n\nOn March 11, 2015, Fitzpatrick was traded to the New York Jets for a late-round conditional draft pick in the 2015 NFL Draft. The move reunited Fitzpatrick with his former Head Coach Chan Gailey, who was hired during the off-season as the Jets offensive coordinator and play-caller. Following an incident in the locker room, in which starting quarterback Geno Smith suffered a broken jaw after being punched by linebacker IK Enemkpali, Fitzpatrick was tentatively named the Week 1 starter for the Jets.\n\nMaking his first start for the Jets on September 13, in Week 1 against the Cleveland Browns, Fitzpatrick threw for 179 yards with two touchdowns and an interception in the 31–10 victory. During \"Monday Night Football\" against the Indianapolis Colts in Week 2, Fitzpatrick threw for 244 yards with two touchdowns and an interception as the Jets won 20–7. During Week 3 against the Philadelphia Eagles, Fitzpatrick threw for 283 yards with two touchdowns and three interceptions as the Jets lost 17–24. In Week 4 against the Miami Dolphins at Wembley Stadium, Fitzpatrick had 218 passing yards with a touchdown and an interception as the Jets won 27–14. In Week 6 against the Washington Redskins, Fitzpatrick rushed for a touchdown on 31 rushing yards and passed for 253 yards with two touchdowns and an interception in the 34–20 victory. In Week 7 against the New England Patriots, Fitzpatrick threw for 295 yards with two touchdowns but the Jets lost 23–30. In Week 8 against the Oakland Raiders, Fitzpatrick suffered torn ligaments in his left thumb while scrambling and did not play for the remainder of the game. Geno Smith relieved him for the rest of the game as the Jets would go on to lose 20–34. Fitzpatrick underwent thumb surgery two days later and stated that he would still start. During Week 9 against the Jacksonville Jaguars, Fitzpatrick threw for 272 yards with 2 touchdowns as the Jets won 28–23. During \"Thursday Night Football\" against the Buffalo Bills in Week 10, Fitzpatrick threw for 193 yards with two touchdowns and two interceptions as the Jets lost 17–22. In Week 11 against the Houston Texans, Fitzpatrick threw for 216 yards with a touchdown and two interceptions as the Jets lost 17–24. \n\nDuring a Dolphins rematch in Week 12, Fitzpatrick made his 100th career start by throwing for 277 yards with 4 touchdowns in the 38–20 victory. In Week 13 against the interconference-rival New York Giants, Fitzpatrick threw for 390 yards with 2 touchdowns as the Jets won 23–20 in overtime. In Week 14 against the Tennessee Titans, Fitzpatrick threw for 263 yards with three touchdowns in a 30–8 victory to earn AFC Offensive Player of the Week. During Saturday Night Football against the Dallas Cowboys in Week 15, Fitzpatrick threw for 299 yards with a touchdown and an interception in the 19–16 victory. This was Fitzpatrick's ninth win of the season as a starter, securing his first winning season as a starting quarterback. During a Patriots rematch in Week 16, Fitzpatrick threw for 296 yards with three touchdowns, including an overtime drive that gave the Jets a game-winning touchdown for a 26–20 victory. For his effort against the Patriots, he earned another AFC Offensive Player of the Week. In the rematch against the Bills during the season finale in Week 17, Fitzpatrick threw for 181 yards and two touchdowns, but he also threw 3 costly interceptions, all of which were in the fourth quarter. The Jets not only lost 17–22, but were also eliminated from playoff contention after the Steelers' win over the Browns, despite finishing the year with a 10–6 record. \n\nHaving started in all 16 games of the 2015 season, Fitzpatrick finished with his best year as a pro with 3,905 passing yards and 31 passing touchdowns along with 15 interceptions, breaking Vinny Testaverde's 1998 franchise record for most touchdown passes in a season.\n\nFitzpatrick, a free agent after the conclusion of the 2015 season, signed a one-year fully guaranteed $12 million contract with the Jets on July 27, 2016.\n\nOpening the season against the Cincinnati Bengals in Week 1, Fitzpatrick had 189 passing yards, two touchdowns, and one interception as the Jets lost a close game 22–23. During \"Thursday Night Football\" against the Buffalo Bills in Week 2, Fitzpatrick improved gradually with 374 passing yards and a touchdown, leading the Jets to a 37–31 victory to earn AFC Offensive Player of the Week. During Week 3 against the Kansas City Chiefs, the Jets committed 8 turnovers, including Fitzpatrick throwing 6 interceptions. Fitzpatrick finished with 188 passing yards as the Jets lost 24–3. In a week 6 matchup against the Arizona Cardinals, Fitzpatrick was benched in favor of Geno Smith after going 16-for-31 for 174 yards with no touchdowns and an interception and the Jets trailing 28–3. \n\nSmith was then named the starter for the next game against the Baltimore Ravens. However, Smith suffered a season-ending injury during the game and was replaced by Fitzpatrick in the second quarter. Fitzpatrick then started the team's next two games against the Cleveland Browns and Miami Dolphins before sitting out against the Los Angeles Rams due to injury. Bryce Petty started in his place even though Fitzpatrick was still active for the game as the backup. Fitzpatrick then returned from his injury to start the next two games against the New England Patriots and Indianapolis Colts. However, during the Colts game, he was benched in favor of Petty to start the second half. \n\nPetty was then named the starter for the final four games of the season. Jets head coach Todd Bowles said, \"The plan was for us to start him the last four games anyway, so we just started a half early.\" Petty then started the next three games against the San Francisco 49ers, Miami Dolphins and New England Patriots. During the Dolphins game, Fitzpatrick relieved Petty due to injury early in the fourth quarter. Petty also suffered an injury in the Patriots game and was replaced by Fitzpatrick in the second quarter. Due to Petty's injury, Fitzpatrick started in the season finale on January 1, 2017, completing 20 of 30 passes for 210 yards and two touchdowns as the Jets beat the Bills by a score of 30–10. In 14 games (11 starts) of 2016, Fitzpatrick finished with 2,710 passing yards, 12 touchdowns, and 17 interceptions.\n\nOn February 15, 2017, Fitzpatrick's contract was voided, and he became a free agent.\n\nOn May 19, 2017, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers signed Fitzpatrick to a one-year, $3 million contract. During Week 6 against the Arizona Cardinals, Fitzpatrick entered the game after starter Jameis Winston suffered a shoulder injury in the second quarter. He completed 22 of 32 passes for 290 yards, 3 touchdowns, and 2 interceptions as the Buccaneers lost by a score of 38–33. During Week 9 against the New Orleans Saints, Fitzpatrick entered the game after Winston suffered a shoulder injury. He completed 8 of 15 passes for 68 yards and a touchdown as the Buccaneers lost by a score of 30–10. On November 6, head coach Dirk Koetter said that Winston would miss at least two weeks to rest his shoulder. Fitzpatrick started the Week 10 game against the New York Jets, throwing for 187 yards, a touchdown, and an interception as the Buccaneers won 15–10. In Week 11, he threw for 275 yards and two touchdowns as the Buccaneers beat the Miami Dolphins by a score of 30–20. He also started the team's Week 12 34–20 loss to the Atlanta Falcons before Winston returned in Week 13. Overall, in the 2017 season, Fitzpatrick had 1,103 passing yards, seven touchdowns, and three interceptions.\n\nOn March 9, 2018, Fitzpatrick signed a one-year contract extension with the Buccaneers. Starter Jameis Winston was handed a three-game suspension, making Fitzpatrick the Buccaneers' starting quarterback to begin the 2018 season. In Week 1 against the New Orleans Saints, Fitzpatrick completed 21 of 28 passes for a career-high 417 yards and four touchdowns, while also rushing for 36 yards and a touchdown, finishing with a 156.2 QB rating as the Buccaneers won 48–40. He was named NFC Offensive Player of the Week for his performance in Week 1. During Week 2 against the Philadelphia Eagles, Fitzpatrick completed 27 of 33 passes for 402 yards and four touchdowns, finishing with a 144.4 QB rating despite one interception as the Buccaneers won 27–21. His performance in Week 2 earned Fitzpatrick his second consecutive NFC Offensive Player of the Week. His unexpectedly incredible performance during the first two weeks of the season revived his old Bills nickname \"Fitzmagic\" with both Buccaneers and NFL fans. During \"Monday Night Football\" against the Pittsburgh Steelers in Week 3, Fitzpatrick finished with 411 passing yards, 3 touchdowns, and 3 interceptions as the Buccaneers lost 27–30. He became the first player in NFL history to have three consecutive games with at least 400 passing yards. Fitzpatrick started in Week 4 against the Chicago Bears, in which his performance regressed; he obtained only 126 passing yards and an interception. He was replaced by Winston, whose three-game suspension expired. The Buccaneers lost by a score of 10–48. \n\nIn Week 8 against the Cincinnati Bengals, Fitzpatrick relieved Winston at the end of the third quarter after Winston was benched for throwing four interceptions. Fitzpatrick completed 11 of 15 passes for 194 yards and two touchdowns to tie the game 34–34 with 1:05 left in the game after being down 34–16. The Bengals would then drive down the field and kick a game-winning field goal as time expired. The next day, the Buccaneers named Fitzpatrick their starting quarterback. In Week 10, against the Washington Redskins, he passed for his fourth 400-yard passing game of the season, throwing for 406 yards and two interceptions, which tied Dan Marino and Peyton Manning for the single-season record as the Buccaneers lost by a score of 16-3. In a 38-35 Week 11 loss against the New York Giants, Fitzpatrick was benched for Winston again in the second half after he threw for 167 yards and three interceptions in what would be his final appearance of the 2018 season. Overall, in eight games, Fitzpatrick finished with 2,366 passing yards, 17 touchdowns, 12 interceptions, and a career-high passer rating of 100.4. He also rushed for 152 yards and two touchdowns.\n\nOn March 18, 2019, the Miami Dolphins signed Fitzpatrick to a two-year contract for $11 million.\n\nFitzpatrick was named the Dolphins starting quarterback over Josh Rosen. In Week 1 against the Baltimore Ravens, Fitzpatrick threw for 185 yards, one touchdown, and one interception as the Dolphins lost 59–10. The following week against the New England Patriots, he threw for 89 yards and was intercepted three times, with two being pick-sixes, before being benched for Rosen in the 43–0 shutout loss. After the game, Dolphins' head coach Brian Flores said that Fitzpatrick would still be the starter in Week 3 against the Dallas Cowboys, but on September 19, prior to the game, Rosen was named the starter, sending Fitzpatrick to the bench. \n\nIn Week 6 against the Washington Redskins, Fitzpatrick relieved Rosen after the latter was benched for poor performance. In the game, Fitzpatrick threw for 132 yards and one touchdown. After leading Miami to a last-minute touchdown to cut Washington's lead to 17–16, he attempted a two-point conversion pass to Kenyan Drake, who dropped it, sealing the loss for Miami. Fitzpatrick started following week against the Buffalo Bills, his former team, leading the Dolphins to a 14–9 halftime lead. However, after he threw an interception to cornerback Tre'Davious White, the Bills rallied in the fourth quarter to win 31–21. Fitzpatrick finished the game with 282 passing yards, one passing touchdown, one interception, and one rushing touchdown. In Week 9 against another of his former teams, the New York Jets, Fitzpatrick threw for 288 yards and three touchdowns as the Dolphins won their first game of the season 26–18. In Week 13 against the Philadelphia Eagles, Fitzpatrick threw for 365 yards, three touchdowns, and one interception in the 37–31 win. During Week 16 against the Cincinnati Bengals, Fitzpatrick finished with 419 passing yards, four touchdowns, and an interception as the Dolphins won 38–35 in overtime. In week 17 against the New England Patriots, Fitzpatrick threw for 320 yards and a touchdown and rushed for 15 yards and a touchdown during the 27–24 win. Fitzpatrick ended the 2019 season with 3,529 passing yards, 20 passing touchdowns, and 13 interceptions to go along with 243 rushing yards and four rushing touchdowns. He ended up being the team's leading rusher for the 2019 season.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFitzpatrick is married to Liza Barber. They have seven children together.

Whitney was an American businessman and member of the influential Whitney family. An eight-story free-standing hospital was constructed, and was affiliated with Cornell University's medical school, now called Weill Cornell Medicine, and with New York Hospital, now New York–Presbyterian Hospital (NYP), before its opening.\n\nPayne Whitney was a large donor to the Hospital and Medical College, and it has been an issue of long speculation why he chose a psychiatric building to be his primary naming opportunity at New York-Cornell.\n\nThe Payne Whitney building itself was torn down in the early 1990s to make way for an expansion of the New York-Presbyterian Hospital over the FDR Drive. Since that time, all clinical and research services at the two primary Cornell psychiatric campuses—in Manhattan and in White Plains, New York—have been named after Payne Whitney. The clinic also has an outpatient and Continuing Day Treatment Program in an off-campus building at East 61st Street and York Avenue in the Upper East Side.\n\nPayne Whitney Clinic and NYP / Weill Cornell have been home to some of the most notable psychiatrists in the country. Current psychiatrists and psychologists include Jack Barchas, Robert Michels, Otto F. Kernberg, James Kocsis, George Makari, Michael Posner, William Breitbart, and Theodore Shapiro.\n\nNoted staff have included Arnold Cooper, Frederic Flach, Benjamin Spock, Gerald Klerman, Robert Millman, Louis Jolyon West, David Silbersweig, Harry Tiebout, Mary Jane Sherfey, Helen Singer Kaplan, Allen Frances, and Paul McHugh. Payne Whitney has also been the \"voluntary faculty\" home to Roy Schafer, Richard Isay, Michael Perelman, Gail Saltz, and Daniel Stern, and the recent home of such senior scholars as David A. Hamburg and Beatrix Hamburg.\n\nThe poet Robert Lowell wrote of his hospitalization at Payne Whitney, Marilyn Monroe was hospitalized there in early 1961, and Mary McCarthy based her book, \"The Group\", on her inpatient experience.

She ran for California Secretary of State in 1990 and for a U.S. Congress seat in 1992. She worked her way up from being a stenographer in the City Hall typing pool.\n\nJoan Milke was born May 9, 1936, in Sheboygan Falls, Wisconsin, into a family with German and French ancestry. Her father, a welder and machinist, or, as she described him, a jack of all trades, brought the family to Los Angeles when Joan was eight, and they settled in Highland Park, where Joan attended Luther Burbank Junior High School and Franklin High School. Joan had three sisters and a brother.\n\nMilke was married for ten years to Sam Flores, a director with the Police Protective League. They had one daughter, Valerie, and were later divorced.\n\nMilke worked part-time in high school and, after she graduated, she went to work in the City Hall in the stenographer's pool. She then became a clerk in the office of District 15 City Councilman John S. Gibson Jr. and worked her way up to become his chief deputy, a job she held for thirteen years. She retained her home in Highland Park until approximately 1979, when she moved into Gibson's district. Flores helped manage Gibson's final election campaign \"and ran the office during his final term, when Gibson's health was suffering.\"\n\n\"See also List of Los Angeles municipal election returns, 1981 and after\"\n\nCouncilman Gibson told Flores that he would not run for reelection in 1981 if she would be a candidate to succeed him, so she entered the race and won, 10,205 ballots against 9,943 for John Greenwood, her remaining opponent in the June final voting. It was said that Flores's support in Watts, coupled with endorsements from Gibson and from longtime County Supervisor Kenneth Hahn, was a deciding factor in the race. Though the balloting was nonpartisan, Flores was a Republican and Greenwood a Democrat.\n\nIn the 1985 race, Flores was reelected without opposition on the ballot, although she did face a write-in campaign by Joe E. Collins Jr., a 21-year-old computer operator, who said that Flores had \"not gone far enough to address tough toxic-waste issues and to aid troubled areas like Wilmington and Watts.\"\n\nIn 1989 she faced a tough race with six opponents, amid charges that she had neglected her district in favor of running for higher office (below).\n\nIn 1993, she was defeated in a close race for reelection to the council by Rudy Svorinich.\n\nLos Angeles City Council District 15 included San Pedro, Wilmington, Harbor City, Los Angeles, the shoestring strip of Harbor Gateway and parts of Watts and South Central Los Angeles.\n\nIn the first term of her City Council career, Flores was elected by her colleagues to be president pro tem, a post third in line of importance to the Los Angeles mayor. She was \"the first freshman in more than 50 years to be chosen for a council leadership position, and many supporters say the representative from District 15 is bound to go higher.\" She gained reputation \"as one of the powerful and steadying forces on the 15-member council.\"\n\nDuring her term on the Los Angeles City Council, she created the City's first Department of Environmental Affairs; introduced many water saving policies, including grey water recycling; and was a strong proponent of long-term conservation policies as well as pro-business policies. She was the long-time chair of the City's powerful Commerce and Natural Resources committee that oversaw the Departments of Airports, Harbor, and Water and Power.\n\nTwo \"prominent achievements\" were the creation in 1988 of a Wilmington branch library and $10 million worth of public improvements in the Wilmington Industrial Park. \"She also fought for recognition of Harbor City and Harbor Gateway as distinct communities, worked to save pine trees in the Harbor Pines area and helped establish a day-laborer hiring program at Ken Malloy-Harbor Regional Park.\" She used her influence to get almost a million dollars in restoration of the historic Watts Train Station, and she helped create the Watts Friendship Sports League.\n\nShe also disagreed with Gibson, her predecessor, over his opposition to zoning, and spent timein implementing zoning plans \"to counter the effects of his policies.\"\n\n\"Los Angeles Times\" reporter Janet Clayton wrote of Flores:\n\nOne of the few registered Republicans on the council, Flores ... straddles the Pat Russell power bloc and other members of the council who are generally more conservative. She carefully tempers her conservative postures (strong police department supporter, anti rent control) to more liberal positions for matters of importance in her district (such as her support of a city holiday for Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.)\n\nSome of Flores's other positions were:\n\n\nRepublican Flores ran for California Secretary of State in 1990, losing to March Fong Eu, a Democrat. Flores drew attention when, \"Trailing badly and eager to begin her television advertising campaign,\" she borrowed $275,000 from Ernest (Tom) Papadakis, a \"wealthy friend and longtime political supporter\" who owned a chain of liquor stores. Eu \"accused Flores of deliberately concealing the loan by filing her financial disclosure statement several days late.\" Flores denied the charge. She was defeated by Eu, 51.7% to 41.6%.\n\nFlores ran in 1992 as the Republican candidate for the U.S. Representative from California to represent the 36th district. However, she lost to Jane Harman. She influenced Nikki Hornsby, Grammy voter, professional songwriter singer musician recording artist, who wrote \"This IS America\" for Joan Milkie Flores. Nikki Hornsby played this song at her campaign event in Torrance CA & that same song written for Joan also played on CNN International TV covering the international FIFA World Cup Soccer held in Germany for the warm up USA verses Italy game 2006. Joan Milke Flores was inspirational and to this day a friend of Nikki Hornsby.\n\nFlores began a lobbying firm that did business at the Los Angeles City Hall and at the State Capitol in Sacramento. In 1995 she was appointed to the Californias Border Environmental Cooperation Committee, an alliance between California and Baja California \"to address common environmental issues in the border region.\" She currently resides in Penn Valley, California.\n\nAccess to some of the \"Los Angeles Times\" links may require the use of a library card.\n"}
{"id": "2334857", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2334857", "title": "Joint wills and mutual wills", "text": "Joint wills and mutual wills\n\nJoint wills and mutual wills are closely related terms used in the law of wills to describe two types of testamentary writing that may be executed by a married couple to ensure that their property is disposed of identically. Neither should be confused with mirror wills which means two separate, identical wills, which may or may not also be mutual wills.\n\nA joint will is a single document executed by more than one person (typically between spouses), making which has effect in relation to each signatory's property on his or her death (unless he or she revokes (cancels) the will during his or her lifetime). Although a single document, the joint will is a separate distribution of property by each executor (signatory) and will be treated as such on admission to probate. Mutual wills are any two (or more) wills which are mutually binding, such that following the first death the survivor is constrained in his or her ability to dispose of his or her property by the agreement he or she made with the deceased. Historically such wills had an important role in ensuring property passed to children of a marriage rather than a spouse of a widow or widower on a remarriage.\n\nThe recognition of these forms varies widely from one jurisdiction to the next. Some permit both, some will not recognize joint wills, and many have established a presumption that one or both of these forms creates a will contract.\n\nA joint will differs substantively from a mutual will in that the former is not intended to be irrevocable or to express a mutual intention; it is merely an administrative convenience. A will may be both joint (on one document) and mutual (see below).\n\nMutual wills have four basic requirements and a strict standard for enforceability:\n\n\nMutual wills are rare, and often another form of constructive trust is imposed (See \"Healey v Browne\" [2002] 2 WTLR 849). It is also noted (see Carnwath J \"in Re Goodchild\" \"ibid\") that a mutual will is a technical legal device requiring an intention to form a binding agreement and that this often differs from the \"loose moral obligation\" presupposed as binding by the layman.\n\nThe major common law authority in this area is \"Re Oldham\" [1925] Ch. 75. This discussed the 18th century case of \"Dufour v Pereira\" which first evinced the doctrine, in which Lord Camden remarked \"he, that dies first, does by his death carry the agreement on his part into execution\". Astbury J in \"Oldham\" distinguished mutual wills from mirror wills - that they are made in identical terms \"does not go nearly far enough\". There must be \"an arrangement proved to the satisfaction of the court\" and this must be a binding, irrevocable agreement.\n\nIn \"Re Cleaver\" [1981] 1 WLR Nourse J took a less strict approach in finding that identical wills went towards proving the existence of an agreement, however this approach was rejected in \"Re Goodchild\" [1996] 1 WLR where Carnwath J stated the importance of having specific evidence as to the testator's mutual intentions at the time of execution of the wills. Carnwath J approved the \"floating trust\" analogy, first proposed by Dixon J in \"Birmingham v Renfrew\" [1937] CLR, which holds that the law will give effect to the intention (to create a mutually binding will) by imposing a floating trust which becomes irrevocable after the death of the first testator and crystallises after the death of the survivor.\n\nIn the Court of Appeal decision in \"Goodchild\" Legatt LJ approved the dicta of Carnwath J and added that \"for the doctrine to apply there must be a contract\". This approach raises problems as will be seen below. However, the contractual requirement has been rejected in other decisions, or at least diluted. Dixon J in \"Birmingham\", commenting on \"Dufour v Pereira\", noted that it is the trust arising from the course of conduct which is enforced, not the contract itself. This approach has received further credence in the decision of Blanchard J in \"Lewis v Cotton\". \"A formal legal contract is not needed. A contract made without formality is enough...The crucial factor must be that the terms of the mutual engagement... are sufficiently certain that the Court can see its way to enforce them.\" The importance of this approach is, as Blanchard J notes, that the focus is on the obligation not to deal with property contrary to the agreement rather than on non-revocation. This therefore covers situations such as that in \"Healey v Browne\" where there has been an \"inter vivos\" transfer to avoid the will.\n\nIn \"Healey v Browne\" a husband transferred assets jointly to himself and his son after the death of his wife. Although there was found to be no mutual will (Donaldson QC adopted the contractual requirement), he considered that where there was a valid mutual will the second testator is free to use the assets for his own beneficial interest as long as it is not calculated to defeat the agreement: \"Where the fiduciary duty is breached by such a voluntary disposition inter vivos of the property in question, the \"crystallisation\" of the floating obligation must occur at the moment of that disposition.\" (Note that Donaldson QC imposed a secret trust in the circumstances which reduced the son's interest to 50%, that being the interest held by the husband)\n\nIn \"Olins v Walters \" [2009] 2 WLR 1 C.A. the Court of Appeal has held that although it is a necessary condition for mutual wills that there is clear and satisfactory evidence of a contract between the testators, it is a legally sufficient condition that the contract provide that, in return for one testator agreeing to make a will in a particular form and not to revoke it without notice to the other testator, the latter would also make a will in a particular form and agree not to revoke it without notice to the first testator. Once a contract of that kind is established, equity will impose on the surviving testator a constructive trust not to dispose of the property in any other way. There did not have to be more detailed terms of the contract because the remedy was not founded on specific performance of contractual obligations but upon implementation of the trust, and the intentions of the parties had only to be expressed sufficiently to lay the foundations for that equitable obligation. The case also held that, where established, the equitable obligation under the trust became immediately binding upon the surviving testator upon the death of the first and was not postponed to take effect only after the death of the second or last testator when the property, or what was left of it, came into the hands of his personal representatives.\n\nAnother issue as regards mutual wills is the question of revocability. In \"Re Hobley\" Charles Aldous QC held that there could be either unilateral or mutual revocation provided it occurred during the lifetime of both testators. However, the problem with this approach is that unilateral revocation is against the general principle of contract. Several explanations for this could be proffered. Firstly, there could be an implicit term that the agreement is revocable. Secondly, it could be conceptually viewed that the agreement takes on the revocable nature of the will to which it relates. Thirdly, as the doctrine is based on detrimental reliance, the agreement only concretized on the death of the other party. Fourthly, one could apply the unconscionability rationale that unjust enrichment could only be complete when one party takes a benefit under the will of the other party.\n\n\"Re Hobley\" adopts the unconscionability rationale such that the imposition of a constructive trust is only justified by unconscionability, therefore there must be detrimental reliance. This would appear to be analogous to the doctrine of estoppel. Another consequence of this approach is that the trust must come into existence before the death of the first testator as otherwise the subject matter of the trust would be uncertain and could possible be avoided by inter vivos dispositions.\n\nAnother point of controversy was whether or not the second testator had to benefit from the initial disposition. Commentators had argued that this was the case as if the second testator did not benefit the unjust enrichment argument would be untenable. However, \"Re Dale\" [1994] Ch held that no benefit was necessary. Morritt J reasoned that although the aim of the doctrine was to prevent fraud on the first testator this did not require a corresponding benefit for the second testator. Friel (1996 1 CPLJ) argued against this saying that the trust should not be imposed on the property but rather on the implementation of the contract between the parties. An excellent rebuke to this approach and support for the view in \"Re Dale\" is to be found in the judgment of Rowles JA in the Court of Appeal (British Columbia) decision in \"University of Manitoba v Sanderson\" [1998]. Rowles contended that the doctrine imposes a constructive trust on the survivor because the first to die is considered to have carried out the agreement by her death in reliance on the survivor's promise to act in accordance with the agreement. It is also important to note that these cases do not use the fraud rationale in the conventional sense of deceptive receipt of property. Instead an estoppel argument based on representation, reliance, detriment and irrevocability is utilised.\n\n\"Re Hagger\" [1930] 2 Ch held that the constructive trust comes into existence on the death of the first testator, however this approach was revised in \"Re Hobley\" which decided that it must come into existence before the death of the first testator to satisfy the requirement of certainty of subject matter.\n\nIn the case of \"Ottaway v Norman\" [1972] Ch., Brightman J held that a floating obligation attaches to secret trusts: \"A valid trust is created in favour of the secondary donee which is in suspense during the lifetime of the donee, but attaches to the estate of the primary donee at the moment of the latter's death.\" Edward Nugee QC sitting as deputy High Court judge in \"Re Basham\" [1986] 1 WLR applied a comparable test in relation to proprietary estoppel. He held that the belief, for detrimental reliance, need not relate to a clearly identified piece of property. Following \"Cleaver\" and \"Birmingham\", if it is established by cogent evidence that the intention was to leave the entire estate, proprietary estoppel will enforce that intention. (It is interesting to recall that Edward Nugee was counsel in \"Ottaway v Norman\" and that Brightman J adopted his floating obligation theory)\n\n"}
{"id": "2334889", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2334889", "title": "Radio-controlled helicopter", "text": "Radio-controlled helicopter\n\nA Radio-controlled helicopter (also \"RC helicopter\") is model aircraft which is distinct from a RC airplane because of the differences in construction, aerodynamics, and flight training. Several basic designs of RC helicopters exist, of which some (such as those with collective pitch control) are more maneuverable than others. The more maneuverable designs are often harder to fly, but benefit from greater aerobatic capabilities.\n\nFlight controls allow pilots to control the collective (or throttle, on fixed pitch helicopters), the cyclic controls (pitch and roll), and the tail rotor (yaw). Controlling these in unison enables the helicopter to perform the same maneuvers as full-sized helicopters, such as hovering and backwards flight, and many other maneuvers that full-sized helicopters cannot, such as inverted flight (where collective pitch control provides negative blade pitch to hold heli up inverted, and pitch/yaw controls must be reversed by pilot).\n\nThe various helicopter controls are effected by means of small servo motors, commonly known as servos. A solid-state gyroscope sensor is typically used on the tail rotor (yaw) control to counter wind- and torque-reaction-induced tail movement. Most newer helicopters have gyro-stabilization on the other 2 axes of rotation (pitch and roll) as well. Such 3-axis gyro is typically called a \"flybarless controller\", so-called because it eliminates the need for a mechanical flybar.\n\nThe engines typically used to be methanol-powered two-stroke motors, but electric brushless motors combined with a high-performance lithium polymer battery (LiPo) are now more common and provide improved efficiency, performance, and lifespan compared to brushed motors, while decreasing prices bring them within reach of hobbyists. Gasoline and jet turbine engines are also used.\n\nJust like full sized helicopters, model helicopter rotors turn at high speeds and can cause severe injuries. Several deaths have occurred as recently as 2013.\n\nCommon power sources of remote control helicopters are glow fuel (also called nitro fuel, nitromethane-methanol), electric batteries, gasoline (petrol) and turbine engines. For the first 40 years, glow fuel helicopters were the most common type produced. However, in the last 10 years, electric powered helicopters have matured to a point where power and flight times are better, but typically not as long as glow fuel helicopters.\n\nThere have been two main types of systems to control the main rotors, mechanical mixing and cyclic/collective pitch mixing (CCPM). Most earlier helicopters used mechanical mixing. Today, nearly all R/C helicopter use CCPM.\n\nPractical electric helicopters are a recent development but have rapidly developed and become more common, overtaking glow fuel helicopters in common use. Turbine helicopters are also increasing in popularity, although the high cost puts them out of reach of most people. \n\nThe first RC helicopters have been powered by combustion engines (Glow fuel, or nitro, as well as gas, or gasoline as the fuel source). Original helicopter \"classes\" were based on the engine size. For example, a helicopter with a engine was a \"30 class\" and a helicopter with a engine was referred to as a \"90 class\" helicopter. The bigger and more powerful the engine, the larger the main rotor blade that it can turn and hence the bigger the aircraft overall. Typical flight time for nitro helicopters is 7–15 minutes depending on the engine size and tuning.\n\nTwo small electric helicopters emerged in the mid-1990s. These were the Kalt Whisper and the Kyosho EP Concept, flying on 7–8 × 1.2 Ah NiCad batteries with brushed motors. However, the 540-sized brushed-motors were on the limit of current draw, often 20–25 amps on the more powerful motors, hence brush and commutator problems were common.\n\nRecent advancements in battery technology are making electric flying more feasible in terms of flying time. Lithium polymer (LiPo) batteries are able to provide the high current required for high performance aerobatics while still remaining very light. Typical flight times are 4–12 minutes depending on the flying style and battery capacity.\n\nIn the past electric helicopters were used mainly indoors due to the small size and lack of fumes. Larger electric helicopters suitable for outdoor flight and advanced aerobatics have become a reality over the last few years and have become very popular. Their quietness has made them very popular for flying sites close to residential areas and in places such as Germany where there are strict noise restrictions. Nitro helicopters have also been converted to electric power by commercial and homemade kits.\n\nThe smallest remote-controlled production model helicopter made (Guinness World Records 2014) is the Silverlit Nano Falcon XS sold at many toy stores (although this is infrared controlled, not radio), electronics stores and internet stores, costing about $30 (£28). The next smallest is the Nano Falcon, which previously held the record for the smallest rc helicopter.\n\nSeveral models are in contention for the title of the smallest non-production remote-controlled helicopter, including the Pixelito family of micro helicopters, the Proxflyer family, and the Micro flying robot.\n\nA recent innovation is that of coaxial electric helicopters. The system's simple direction control and freedom from torque induced yaw have, in recent years, made it a good candidate on small models for beginner and/or indoor use. Models of this type, as in the case of a full-scale helicopter, eliminate rotational torque and can have extremely quick control response, both of which are very pronounced in a CCPM model. Most cheaper models do not have a swashplate, but instead use a third rotor on the tail to provide pitch control. These helicopters have no roll control and have limited mobility.\n\nWhile a coaxial model is very stable and can be flown indoors even in tight quarters, such a helicopter has limited forward speed, especially outdoors. Most models are fixed-pitch, i.e. the collective pitch of the blades cannot be controlled, plus the cyclic control is only applied to the lower rotor. Compensating for even the slightest breeze causes the model to climb rather than to fly forward even with full application of cyclic. More advanced coaxial constructions with two swash plates and/or pitch control (common for full-scale coaxial helicopters like Kamovs) have been realized as models in individual projects but have not seen the mass market .\n\nMore recently, multirotor designs have become popular in both the RC hobby and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) research. These vehicles use an electronic control system and electronic sensors to stabilize the aircraft. Multirotors are generally more affordable, easier to construct, and simpler to operate than RC helicopters. This made multirotor aircraft an appealing platform for amateur model aircraft projects and aerial photography.\n\nNitro RC helicopters are categorised under the following classes:\n\nModern RC helicopters are generally classed by the length of the main blades (with few exceptions). Common classes are:\n\nRC helicopters generally require between 3 and 7 channels for control (although micro helicopters that utilize a 2-channel infrared control system also exist). Small fixed-pitch helicopters use a 4-channel radio (throttle, elevator, aileron, rudder); while collective-pitch models need a minimum of 5 channels (throttle, collective pitch, elevator, aileron, and rudder). 6th channel is often used for gyro gain. 7th channel commonly used for engine governor control for fuel powered models. Because of the normal interaction of the various control mechanisms, advanced radios include adjustable mixing functions, such as throttle/collective and throttle/rudder. Radio prices vary from $50–$3,000 USD.\n\nEarly radio controls systems used amplitude modulation (AM) to transmit their signals. In the late '70s, frequency modulation (FM) became more commonplace.\n\nStarting with the Spektrum DX6 park flyer transmitter system in 2006, RC flying began the departure from various lower frequencies which were subject to interference and were less reliable than the new spread spectrum protocols. Systems such as Spektrum and JR use the DSM2 and later, DSMX direct-sequence spread spectrum (DSSS) method, where they transmit on a pair of fixed channels chosen when the radio and receiver are turned on. Any subsequent systems would avoid using these channels and continue searching for another unused pair of channels.\n\nSystems such as frequency-hopping spread spectrum (FHSS) used by Futaba employ frequency hopping on the 2.4 GHz band instead of the various frequencies in the lower MHz ranges. The advantage is that radios are no longer using a fixed frequency during flight, mitigating the risk of interference on that fixed frequency.\nWith either method many radios can be transmitting at once without interfering with each other. The Futaba systems change frequency approximately every two milliseconds, so even if two transmitters are using the same channel they are not doing so for long. The pilot will not notice any abnormal behavior of the model in the 1/500th of a second that they are interfering. This gives one the advantage of turning on a transmitter without regard to channels currently in use by other pilots' radios.\n\nOne downside to 2.4 GHz is that precautions must be taken during installation since certain materials such as carbon fiber can mask the signal. In some cases, satellite receivers with secondary antennas need to be used to maintain better line-of-sight with the transmitter radio. Another drawback is that a 2.4 GHz standard has yet to evolve so that receivers and transmitters can be mixed regardless of their respective manufacturer.\n\nLearning to fly a collective pitch RC helicopter takes time and practice. Many modelers join a club so they can be instructed by experienced RC pilots, or follow on-line guides.\n\nRC Helicopters usually have at least four controls: roll - cyclic pitch, elevator (fore-aft cyclic pitch), rudder (yaw) and pitch/throttle (collective pitch/power). For simple flight, the radio is usually configured such that pitch is around −1 degree at 0% throttle stick, and somewhere around 10 degrees at 100% throttle stick. It is also necessary to modulate the throttle in conjunction with the pitch so that the model maintains a constant rotor speed. This is beneficial for consistent and smooth flight performance.\n\nIf aerobatic '3D' performance is desired, then automatic throttle, or \"idle up\", mode of flight is used. In this mode, the collective pitch ranges from its negative limit at 0% throttle stick input, up to its positive limit at 100% throttle stick. The throttle, on the other hand, is modulated automatically to maintain a constant rotor speed and is usually at its lowest value when the throttle stick is centered and the pitch is 0. This mode allows the rotor to produce a thrust upwards (by using negative pitch) which, when the model is inverted, allows sustained inverted flight. Usually a more advanced computer radio is used for this kind of flying, which allows customization of the throttle-collective mix.\n\nThe cyclic and yaw controls are not by definition different in these two modes, though 3D pilots may configure their models to be much more responsive.\n\nConstruction is typically of plastic, glass-reinforced plastic, aluminium or carbon fiber. Rotor blades are typically made of wood, fiberglass or carbon fiber. Models are typically purchased in kit form from one of about a dozen popular manufacturers and take 5 to 20 hours to completely assemble.\n\nThese model helicopters contain many moving parts analogous to those on full-size helicopters, from the swashplate to rotor and everything in between.\n\nThe construction of helicopters has to be more precise than for fixed-wing model aircraft, because helicopters are susceptible to even the smallest of vibrations, which can cause problems when the helicopter is in flight.\n\nAdditionally, the small size and low weight of R/C helicopters and their components means that control inputs, especially cyclic (pitch and roll) can have a very fast response, and cause a rotation rate much faster than the equivalent input might produce on a full-size aircraft. This quick response can make the model unnecessarily difficult to fly. For this reason, most model helicopters either have a flybar or electronic stabilizing equipment.\n\nTo reduce mechanical complexity and increase precision of the control of the swashplate some model helicopters use cyclic/collective pitch mixing.\n\nAerobatic helicopter flying has historically followed the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale rules, which for helicopters are labelled F3C. These include a predetermined routine of hovering and aerobatics.\n\nAn advanced form of RC helicopter flying is called 3D. During 3D flying, helicopters perform advanced aerobatics, sometimes in a freestyle form, or in a predetermined set of moves drawn up by the organisers of the competition. There are a number of 3D competitions around the world, two of the best-known being the 3D Masters in the UK and the eXtreme Flight Championship (XFC) in the United States.\n\nIn 2008, the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale introduced the class of F3N as a provisional class for international 3D competition and in 2010 at the CIAM Plenary meeting, F3N gained formal approval for competition effective 1 January 2011.\n\nF3N rules are designed to provide a consistent standard of judging throughout the World and give countries the chance to field a Team at a World championship hosted every two years. F3N is conducted in a similar manner as 3D Masters and 3DX with 3 round types made up of Set Manoeuvres, Freestyle Flight and Flight to Music.\n\nWhile some companies make use of RC multicopters for low altitude aerial photography, filming, policing, and remote observation or inspection, RC helicopters are not commonly used for commercial purposes. One notable exception is crop spraying with large RC helicopters such as the Yamaha R-MAX.\n\nUS Federal Aviation Administration regulations from 2006 grounding all commercial RC model and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) flights have been upgraded to require formal FAA certification before being permitted to fly at any altitude in the United States. All commercial owners must register with FAA, as well as pass a knowledge test. Non-commercial operators must register only if the models they fly weigh more than 0.55 pounds (250g).\n\n'Model' helicopters can be dangerous. Safety precautions, proper maintenance, and an understanding of the mechanics and flight characteristics of the models are necessary to prevent accidents. Modelers who fly at sanctioned sites are required to follow safety rules designated by national model aircraft organizations. In the United States, the Academy of Model Aeronautics (AMA) publishes and updates safety rules for all model aircraft operations, including fixed and rotary wing models. In 2014, several organizations with interest in unmanned aircraft systems in partnership with the Federal Aviation Administration launched a new educational campaign to promote safe and responsible flying and provide guidance for hobbyists and commercial users.\n\nIn July 2013, a 41-year-old Swiss man was found dead in Mauensee near his model helicopter. He had \"severe head and arm injuries\".\n\nA September 2013 incident in New York City highlighted the possible dangers of remote controlled model helicopters when a 19-year-old enthusiast, who was very experienced in flying remote controlled helicopters, died after one of his helicopters' blades struck his head.\n\nMiniature helicopters are remotely controlled helicopters with a weight ranging from just a few grams to one hundred grams. Most in production are toys aimed at hobbyists and enthusiasts. In addition, there are many companies making prototypes for military and security applications. Miniature helicopters are popular demonstrations for the latest technologies in miniaturization.\n\nExamples of these types of miniaturized models are the E-Flite Blade CX and CX2 and the Picoo Z, a popular consumer model. Along with the Proxflyer, a prototype and basis for many production models. One final example is a one-off prototype and technology demonstration item that was developed by Seiko Epson, and demonstrated at the International Robot Exhibition in Tokyo is the Seiko Epson Micro flying robot.\n\n"}

{"id": "2334935", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2334935", "title": "Saginaw Bay", "text": "Saginaw Bay\n\nSaginaw Bay is a bay within Lake Huron located on the eastern side of the U.S. state of Michigan. It forms the space between Michigan's Thumb region and the rest of the Lower Peninsula of Michigan. Saginaw Bay is in area. It is located in parts of five Michigan counties: Arenac, Bay, Huron, Iosco, and Tuscola.\n\nThe Saginaw Bay watershed is the largest drainage basin in Michigan, draining approximately 15% of the total land area. The watershed contains the largest contiguous freshwater coastal wetland system in the United States. The Saginaw Bay Watershed Initiative Network leads the effort to promote sustainable development in the Saginaw Bay Watershed by coordinating watershed programs and providing grants to innovative projects across the region. It is currently listed as an Area of Concern by the Environmental Protection Agency.\n\nPossible origins for the name \"Saginaw\" could be from the Ojibwa words \"O-Sag-e-non\" or \"Sag-in-a-we\", meaning \"to flow out\". It may refer to the Saginaw River, which flows out into Saginaw Bay and eventually into Lake Huron. The name \"Saginaw\" is not related to Saguenay, a region in Quebec whose name is of Algonquin origin.\n\nThis area was long settled by indigenous peoples, lastly by bands of the Ojibwe people prior to European exploration. They dominated the areas around the Great Lakes. In the early 17th century, French explorers were the first Europeans to visit the Great Lakes region. The first to visit the Saginaw Bay area was Father Jacques Marquette, a French Jesuit missionary priest, who went there in 1668 after establishing a mission in St. Ignace. In 1686, Father arrived in the valley to establish an Indian mission, but his efforts failed.\n\nFrance ceded its nominal control of the region to Great Britain under the terms of the Treaty of Paris of 1763 following Britain's victory in the Seven Years' War. Twenty years later, Britain ceded it to the newly independent United States of America. It became part of the Michigan Territory in 1805 and later was admitted to the Union as the State of Michigan.\n\nDuring development of natural resources in the 19th century, Saginaw Bay was busy with shipping of lumber and other commodities to eastern markets.\n\nAbout 1813, Louis Campau erected an Indian trading post along the Saginaw River, which led to the development of Saginaw City, Michigan in 1816 (which was combined with East Saginaw City in March 1890 to form Saginaw, Michigan). The history of other settlements of the Saginaw Bay area was connected to this.\nBay City, Michigan is a major port at the lower end of the bay. The two islands in the middle of the bay, Charity Island and Little Charity Island, are excellent fishing grounds.\n\nBecause Saginaw Bay is shallower and warmer than the main basin of Lake Huron, its fish community is also different. Both recreational and commercial fisheries operate in Saginaw Bay. Walleye and yellow perch are the primary sport species while the commercial fishery primarily targets lake whitefish and yellow perch. The commercial fishery is a state of Michigan licensed fishery as opposed to tribal based fisheries that operate in other parts of Lake Huron. The recreational fishery became more prominent in the last half of the 20th century. Prior to that, the bay's fisheries were almost entirely commercial. Like much of the Great Lakes, the fisheries collapsed or became severely degraded around the middle part of the 20th century. This was attributed mainly to habitat degradation (dam construction, sedimentation of off shore spawning areas), pollution, cultural eutrophication, and the effects of invasive species. The relatively intense exploitation of the commercial fisheries that operated at the time probably hastened the declines but was not believed to be the main cause since they had operated there since the late 17th century. \n\nResurgence of the fisheries began after passage of clean water legislation like the Clean Water Act and the Great Lakes Clean Water Pact. The walleye fishery began a resurgence in the early 1980s when the Michigan Department of Natural Resources initiated a fingerling stocking program. The sport fishery soon remerged, but the commercial fishery for walleye which was formally closed in 1970, remained closed. The recreational fishery harvest averaged 80,000 walleyes annually from 1986 to 2002 but was hatchery dependent with as much as 80% of the harvest being hatchery fish. A profound food web shift in Lake Huron took place in 2003 with the near disappearance of the invasive alewife. Alewives used Saginaw Bay's near-shore waters as spawning and nursery grounds and were a formidable predator and competitor on newly hatched percid (walleye and yellow perch) fry. In the absence of alewives, walleye and yellow perch reproductive success greatly increased. The Michigan Department of Natural Resources discontinued stocking in 2006, and walleye recovery targets were formally met in 2009. Recreational harvest since then has ranged from about 150,000 per year to as much as 350,000 per year. The Michigan Department of Natural Resources liberalized walleye recreational harvest (higher daily possession limit and lower minimum length limit) in 2015. Although yellow perch also benefitted from the absence of alewives with greater reproductive success, the numbers of adults has declined and remained depressed. This is because of a high mortality rate in their first year of life, believed to be predation from walleye and other predators.\n\nOther historically important species in Saginaw Bay include lake sturgeon and cisco (lake herring). Until the middle of the 20th century, Saginaw Bay supported an enormous cisco commercial fishery. They declined throughout much of the lake and have not recovered in Saginaw Bay. A cisco fingerling stocking program aimed at restoring a breeding population in the bay was initiated in 2017, a joint exercise by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the Michigan Department of Natural Resources and other partner agencies of the Great Lakes Fishery Commission. Lake sturgeon, which mainly spawn in rivers, are also the subject of a restocking effort led by the Michigan Department of Natural Resources, with plantings taking place in the Saginaw River system.\n\nSaginaw Bay Light No. 1, a navigational light 11 nautical miles northeast of the mouth of the Saginaw River, houses NOAA weather equipment providing weather conditions for the bay. \nGravelly Shoal Light, located near Charity Island, also houses a weather station.\n\n\n"}

It borders Bearsden to the east (in East Dunbartonshire) and Clydebank to the west (in West Dunbartonshire). The area is bordered by Knightswood and Yoker in Glasgow. The name derives from the Gaelic meaning 'the ridge of the horse'.\n\nAs part of the overspill policy of Glasgow Corporation, a huge housing estate was built here in the 1950s to house 34,000 people – it is this estate that is now most associated with Drumchapel, despite there being an area known as Old Drumchapel made up of affluent villas to the south of modern Drumchapel.\n\nThe area had well-known social problems, notably anti-social behaviour and degeneration of often poorly constructed post-war housing. However, it remains popular with many of its residents and more recently there has been substantial private investment in the area, leading to the construction of new housing developments in the north-west of the district. The area, along with Easterhouse, Castlemilk and Greater Pollok, are collectively known as 'Big Four' post-war social housing schemes. All are similar in terms of architecture and planning, and tend to suffer from a similar range of social problems.\n\nThe area is served by Drumchapel railway station.\n\nDrumchapel was part of the parish of New Kilpatrick, becoming devolved in the late 19th century and a church parish in its own right in 1923. The Old Church (originally serving both Drumchapel and Blairdardie) was built in 1901 for an increasing local population. The parish boundary was redrawn to create the new parish of St Margarets in Knightswood.\n\nCivil administration transferred from New Kilpatrick to Glasgow Corporation in 1938. As part of the overspill policy of Glasgow Corporation, a huge housing estate was built here in the 1950s.\n\nThe area suffered a tragedy in 1994 when a double-decker bus carrying a group of local Girl Guides crashed into one of the low rail bridges in the city's Tradeston area (the driver was unfamiliar with the route and was being led by a guide leader in a car); two 10-year-old girls, an 11-year-old girl and two adult supervisors were killed in the incident and 15 other children injured, six of them seriously.\n\nThe housing in the area is now 72% post-war tenement and 6% multi-storey flats, the remainder being other flats and houses. The current population was estimated in 2002 at 15,000, which was split across 6,000 households. The population of Drumchapel fell by 22% between 1996 and 2012 to 13,000. The proportion of people in the area from ethnic minority groups increased over the same time to 5%, which remains well below average for Glasgow (12%). Life expectancy in the area is about five years less than the average for Glasgow (male 69 years, female 74 years).\n\nSocio-economically, the area is not affluent. In 2011/12, 48% of children were classed as living in poverty, and 57% of the population were NRS social grade D or E. 56% of households were single-parent. 21% of young people were not in education, employment or training. Just 22% of the population own their own home, about half the average figure for Glasgow.\n\nThe major employers for Drumchapel from the 1950s to the 1980s were the Goodyear Tyre & Rubber Co (GB) Ltd, Beattie's Biscuit Factory, Singers Sewing Machines (Clydebank), The Reo Stakis Organisation – Hills Hotel and Rigg Public Bar, The Golden Garter Night Club and The Butty Public Bar, The Edrington Group Whisky Bond and the various shipyards on the Clyde. Beattie's Biscuit factory closed in 1978 and the Goodyear and Singers factories both closed in February 1979. Reo Stakis's Hills Hotel and Rigg Public Bar along with The Golden Garter Night Club closed in June 1988. \n\nThe Butty Public Bar was sold to Scottish & Newcastle Breweries and is still going strong with Billy Bryson, the manager for over 30 years, now holding the lease. The Edrington Group Whisky Bond has grown over the years and is still a major employer in the area, while the shipyards have all gone with the exception of the now BAE Systems yards at Scotstoun and Govan. Drumchapel is now going through its second regeneration, with promises of better schools, better homes and higher employment.\n\n\n"}

He attended Bristol County Academy, was graduated from Brown University in 1838, and from Harvard Law School in 1840. After one year in the Boston office of Judge Peleg Sprague, he was admitted to the Suffolk bar in 1841 and practised in Boston for seventeen years. His first appearance in a public position was as a member of the Massachusetts Constitutional Convention of 1853, in which he sat for Andover, his home from 1850. In 1858 he served in the state House of Representatives, where he was chairman of the committee on elections and rendered reports on important questions regarding election law, which the House came to follow.\n\nHis judicial service began with his appointment in 1858 to the superior court of Suffolk County and continued unbroken for over thirty-two years. During these years he was one of the original ten members of the state superior court, organized in 1859; Justice of the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts from April 15, 1869; and Chief Justice from January 16, 1882 to August 27, 1890, at which time he resigned because of ill health. He died of heart failure in Andover, leaving his widow, whom, as Abby B. Hoppin of Providence, Rhode Island, he had married on October 19, 1843, a son, and five daughters.\n\nMorton was by temperament an excellent judge, thorough, strong and reliable rather than brilliant, rapid in assimilating materials and in dispatching business, always accessible, of sufficient learning, courageous in deciding according to his convictions, and of unusual practical sagacity and native shrewdness. Possessed of a direct and vigorous sense of justice, he viewed cases comprehensively, aiming at substantial justice rather than \"the sharp quillets of the law\". His summaries to juries were characterized by their simplicity, intelligibility, accurate sense of proportion, and impartiality. His judgments, of which over twelve hundred are recorded in the \"Massachusetts Reports\", are compact, clear, and forcible, and, in the opinion of his associates, contain few dicta which will require overruling or qualifications. As a \"nisi prius\" judge he is said to have had few equals in the history of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. In private life he was plain and unassuming and, though of great personal charm and popularity, averse to public display.\n\n"}

At the show's start, after a year living in London they move to the village of Snowle, where her intimidating father (Frank Finlay) breeds turkeys. He and most of Lisa's family (which included Emma Chambers as her sister and Peter Serafinowicz as her thuggish brother) take a dislike to Ian, and much of the comedy comes from how Ian copes with life with her family and village life in general. The situation is also complicated by Lisa's ex-boyfriend Derek (Mark Heap), who still loves her.\n\nThe series' title is a reference to the trade Ian takes up within the village, buying the business of the local photographer despite having no formal training in photography (he had previously managed a comedy club in London). Photography plays an important part within the stories; the beginning of series one shows Ian and Lisa outside a country church having wedding photos taken; this is then shown to be a staged event arranged by Lisa's family due to their unhappiness at them eloping and marrying abroad prior to the series starting. Ian first realises the extent of the family's hatred for him when he witnesses Lisa's mother cutting him out of the wedding pictures at the end of the first episode. Further episodes also have photography playing a key role, including an episode where nude photos of Lisa get circulated around the village after her brother and his friends discover them. Another episode sees Lisa's sister approach Ian for a photo shoot, and her disappointment when he is unable to photograph her looking glamorous and beautiful. There is a running joke throughout the series of Ian wanting to make a book of photographs of country fire stations in Britain.\n\nSeries 2 ends with Ian and Lisa sitting in their car debating whether to leave the village; Ian cannot bear to live there any more due to the aggression shown by Lisa's family to him but Lisa does not want to live in London.\n\n\nThere were two series of \"How Do You Want Me?\", broadcast in 1998 and 1999, each with six episodes.\n\nThe first series was broadcast at 10pm on Tuesdays, from 24 February until 31 March 1998.\n\n\nThe second series was broadcast at 10pm on Wednesdays, from 10 November until 22 December 1999.\n\n\n\"\"How Do You Want Me?\": The Complete Collection\" was released on DVD in the UK on 3 July 2006.\n\nIn 2010, \"The Guardian\" ranked the serial at number 16 in their list of \"The Top 50 TV Dramas of All Time\".\n\n"}

Developed from the DB 601, the DB 605 was used from 1942 to 1945 in the Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighter, and the Bf 110 and Me 210C heavy fighters. The DB 610, a coupled \"power system\" powerplant comprising a pair of side-by-side configured examples of the DB 605, geared together in the front to turn a single output shaft — and which, like the similar DB 606 that it replaced, weighed 1,515 kg — was used in the A-3 and all A-5 variants of Germany's only operational heavy bomber, the Heinkel He 177A.\n\nLicense-built versions of the DB 605 were used in the Macchi C.205, Fiat G.55, Reggiane 2005 and some other Italian aircraft. It was also initially used in the pusher-design Swedish Saab J21. Approximately 42,400 DB 605s of all kinds were built.\n\nThe primary differences between the 605 and 601 were greater displacement, higher revolutions, higher compression ratio and a more powerful supercharger. Through careful study the engineers determined that the cylinders could be bored out to a larger diameter without seriously affecting the strength of the existing block. The difference was minimal, increasing from the 601's 150 mm cylinder bore to the 605's 154 mm, but this increased the overall displacement from 33.9 litres to 35.7. Altered valve timing increased the inlet period and improved the scavenging to give greater volumetric efficiency at higher speeds, which improved the maximum allowable RPM from 2,600 in the 601 to 2,800 in the 605. The combination of these changes raised power output from 1,350 PS (1,332 hp) to 1,475 PS (1455 hp). Engine weight increased from 700 to 756 kg.\nIn other ways the engine was essentially identical to the 601, being a 12-cylinder, inverted-V (with the crankshaft above the cylinders) design. Both used dual Bosch magnetos firing twin spark plugs for ignition. Fuel injection was powered by a pump supplying up to 90 bar and the oil system used three pumps with a separate 35-litre oil tank. The supercharger was fairly advanced for the era in that it used a barometrically controlled hydraulic clutch (fluid coupling) which allowed the system to automatically compensate for changes in altitude.\nOne major design difference was the switch from ball bearings to plain bearings which, when combined with increasingly poor grades of lubricants, led to serious problems in service, including engine fires; initially, for example, the use of emergency power was forbidden. Although Daimler-Benz redesigned the bearings and added oil slingers and their associated coolers, the RLM considered the DB 605 to be a \"sick engine\" and the problems had not been fully resolved by the end of the war.\n\nLike the 601, the 605 was designed to run on \"B4\" fuel with an octane rating of 87. In 1944 a series of newer engines was introduced, allowing the engine to run on the 100 octane \"C3\" fuel and optionally including fittings for various optional power-boosting agent dispensing systems, such as the MW50 methanol-water injection system, and GM-1 nitrous oxide injection system. The DB 605AM, running initially on C3 and MW-50, saw power improved to 1,800 PS (1775 hp) for takeoff. In mid-1944, the requirement for C3 was dropped and standard B4 fuel with MW-50 was used. The DB 605AS(M) improved the maximum rated altitude by using a larger supercharger taken from the DB 603 but was otherwise similar to the A(M). The DB 605ASB's takeoff power was also rated at 1,800 PS (1,775 hp), while maintaining the high-altitude performance of the ASM. The final version of the A-series was the DB 605ASC of 1945, which improved takeoff power to 2,000 PS (1,973 hp).\n\nAs early as 1942 Daimler had also been working on an upgraded D-series engine that could run on either C2 or C3 fuel. The first of these, which appeared in late 1944, were a small series of DB 605DM, followed by the main production series, the DB 605DB/DC. These engines were fitted with an adjustable screw stop which allowed the use of either B4 fuel with MW-50, or C-3 fuel without MW-50, in which case the engine was designated DB 605DB, or the use of C-3 fuel with MW-50, in which case the engine was given the -DC suffix instead. In its DB-suffix form the engine generated 1,800 PS (1,775 hp) for take-off at 1.8 ata, while the DC was capable of 2,000 PS (1,973 hp) at 1.98 ata. If MW-50 was not available for use with the B4 fuel the throttle was limited to 1.45 ata for the entire flight. Thus, this series was ideally suited to catering for the chaotic fuel supply situation prevalent during the last months of the Third Reich. These engines were mainly used in the Bf 109G-10 and K-4 series.\n\nOne unusual application of the DB 605 came in the form of a captured Supermarine Spitfire; in November 1942, Spitfire VB \"EN830\" \"NX-X\" of 131 Squadron was captured after making a forced landing in a turnip field in Jersey; the plane was repaired by German forces and re-engined with a DB 605A Vee 12, amongst other modifications. The aircraft was operated by the Luftwaffe until 14 August 1944, when it was destroyed during a USAAF bombing raid.\n\n\n\nNote: All power ratings in PS (metric horsepower). Unless otherwise noted takeoff/emergency power at sea level.\n\nA Hispano Aviación HA-1112 a license-built Messerschmitt Bf 109 G-2 has been rebuilt by EADS/Messerschmitt Foundation in Germany with a Daimler-Benz DB 605 engine.\n\nDB 605\nDB 610\n\nPreserved DB 605 engines are on display at the Royal Air Force Museum, London and the National Air and Space Museum, Washington D.C.\n\n\n"}

He was the primary reporter on breaking news stories, both in the U.S. and around the world, including dozens of assignments in some 10 countries. He covered the war on terrorism, embedded on multiple occasions in Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Iraq (where his convoy was hit by an IED). In the U.S., he covered shootings such as Virginia Tech, Fort Hood, and the Pennsylvania Amish school shootings, Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, the Sago Mine collapse, and the Minneapolis bridge collapse in August 2007. He anchored morning and evening coverage.\n\nHe has a website, \"Cuomo on the Case,\" where he takes questions, and which acts as a platform for his reporting and discussion on a number of issues. He had two weekly digital programs on ABC News, \"The Real Deal\" and \"Focus on Faith\", that discussed matters of spirituality. He also appeared with Father Edward Beck on \"ABC News Now\", the network's 24-hour digital outlet.\n\nIn February 2013, Cuomo moved to CNN to co-host its morning show. He made his debut on CNN as field anchor on the February 8, 2013, episode of \"Piers Morgan Tonight\", covering the February 2013 nor'easter. In March 2018, while serving as the co-anchor of CNN's morning show \"New Day,\" it was announced that Cuomo would move to primetime to host \"Cuomo Primetime\".\n\nIn October 2017, sister network HLN premiered a new documentary series hosted by the anchor, \"Inside with Chris Cuomo\", which focuses on \"stories affecting real people, in real towns and cities across America.\"\n\nIn September 2018, he began hosting a two-hour weekday radio show \"Let’s Get After It\" on the P.O.T.U.S. channel on SiriusXM.\n\nCuomo has received multiple Emmy Award nominations. His \"Good Morning America\" profile of the 12-year-old poet Mattie Stepanek was recognized with a News Emmy, making Cuomo one of the youngest correspondents to receive a News Emmy in network news history.\n\nHe has been awarded Polk and Peabody Awards for team coverage. His work has been recognized in the areas of breaking news, business news, and legal news, with the Edward R. Murrow Award for breaking news coverage, the 2005 Gerald Loeb Award for Television Deadline business reporting for \"Money for Nothing?\", and the American Bar Association Silver Gavel Award for investigating juvenile justice.\n\nIn 2001, Cuomo married \"Gotham\" magazine editor Cristina Greeven in a Roman Catholic ceremony in Southampton, New York. They reside in Manhattan with their three children. Cuomo also owns a home in Southampton.\n\nOn August 13, 2019, in Shelter Island, New York, Cuomo threatened to throw a heckler down a flight of stairs at a bar, and chastised him with profanity-laced insults after the man called him Fredo, in reference to the fictional character from \"The Godfather\" novel and films. Cuomo told the man that the use of the name \"Fredo\" was tantamount to \"the n-word\" for Italian-Americans, which caused debate on Twitter about the claimed equivalency. Cuomo addressed the incident publicly, tweeting his appreciation to his supporters but acknowledging that he \"should be better than what [he] oppose[s].\"\n\nAmid the COVID-19 pandemic, Cuomo announced on March 31 that he had been diagnosed with COVID-19. Since then, he has broadcast his usual weekday program from his home, where he is quarantined. Cuomo later claimed he had a hallucination of his dead father, former New York Governor Mario Cuomo, as a result of symptoms from the disease. On April 15, Cuomo announced on his program that his wife, Cristina, tested positive for COVID-19, and on April 22, his wife revealed that their 14-year-old son Mario also had tested positive for the disease.\n\n"}

He attended schools in Arkansas, Indiana, Colorado and California. He enlisted in the Navy in 1918, was honorably discharged in 1919 and was in the active reserve until 1921. He moved to Los Angeles around 1928 and married his wife, Velma, around 1929. Their home was at 11005 Morrison Street, North Hollywood.\n\nBurkhalter died at age 78 on May 24, 1975, in Duarte, California. Interment was in Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Hollywood Hills).

At that time, the district covered the San Fernando Valley, the Los Feliz section east of Griffith Park Drive and north of Franklin Avenue, the section between Vermont and Talmadge avenues south to Santa Monica Boulevard, and the Riverside Drive area west of Glendale Boulevard. But Burkhalter was elected in his second attempt, in 1953, replacing Leland S.

{"id": "2335106", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2335106", "title": "Green Lawn Cemetery (Columbus, Ohio)", "text": "Green Lawn Cemetery (Columbus, Ohio)\n\nGreen Lawn Cemetery is a historic private rural cemetery located in Columbus, Ohio in the United States. Organized in 1848 and opened in 1849, the cemetery was the city's premier burying ground in the 1800s. An American Civil War memorial was erected there in 1891, and chapel constructed in 1902 and expanded in 1963. With , it is Ohio's second-largest cemetery.\n\nFranklinton Cemetery was the first cemetery established in what later became Columbus. It was built on land donated by Lucas Sullivant on River Street near Souder Avenue in 1799. Many of the early settlers of Franklinton and Columbus were buried there. The North Graveyard followed in 1812, and the East Graveyard in 1841. A Roman Catholic cemetery opened in 1848 (although it had been in use as early as 1846).\n\nBy the mid-1840s, growing settlement in the area left the Franklinton, North, and East cemeteries too small to accommodate more burials. On February 24, 1848, the Ohio General Assembly enacted a law providing for the incorporation of cemetery associations by 10 or more people. On August 2, 1848, a group of Columbus area business and civic leaders that included A.C Brown, William G. Deshler, William A. Platt, Thomas Sparrow, Alfred P. Stone, Joseph Sullivant, William B. Thrall, and others formed the Green Lawn Cemetery Association. The group secured a charter from the Ohio General Assembly on March 23, 1849, incorporating the \"Green Lawn Cemetery of Columbus\". A public meeting was held on July 12, and a committee of 11 local leaders appointed to select a site and draft articles of incorporation. The committee presented the public with draft articles of incorporation on August 2. These were accepted, and the first board of directors organized on August 26.\n\nThe board sought a site of about of gently rolling land well-covered in trees and shrubs. The first purchase of of forested land was made in the early spring of 1849 at a cost of $3,750 ($ in dollars). This consisted of a tract obtained from Judge Gershom M. Peters and a tract from William Miner. A public picnic was held on the ground on May 23, during which a partial clearing of a small portion of the land occurred. Architect Howard Daniels was hired to lay out the roads, paths, and plots. Daniels had spent several months in Europe studying rural cemetery design there, and had recently designed his first cemetery, Cincinnati's widely praised Spring Grove Cemetery. A formal dedication of the cemetery occurred on July 9. A superintendent's cottage was erected near the main gate on Brown Road, and Richard Woolley appointed the first superintendent.\n\nAt the time, the cemetery was located west of the nascent village of Columbus. The first burial at Green Lawn Cemetery was that of a child, Leonora Perry, on July 7, 1849. The second, and first adult, was Dr. B. F. Gard on July 12. The first headstone or other monument in the cemetery was erected the second week of October 1849 by William G. Deshler. It was for his wife, Olive, who had died at the age of 19. The monument consisted of an upright stone slab depicting a rose branch. The bloom itself was carved on the plinth on which the slab stood, and was inscribed \"Olive, wife of William G. Deshler, age 19\". After Green Lawn opened, most of the families with graves at Franklinton Cemetery moved their ancestral remains to Green Lawn. Franklinton Cemetery quickly fell out of favor as a place to be buried. Those buried at North Graveyard also disinterred loved ones' remains and moved them to Green Lawn. By 1869, about half of those buried at North Graveyard had been reinterred at Green Lawn.\n\nGreen Lawn Cemetery lotholders voted to bar non-whites from being buried at Green Lawn in 1856. It was not until 1872 that this restriction was lifted, and a segregated section set aside for African Americans.\n\nBy 1858, two more purchases of land had been made, and the cemetery expanded to to accommodate the more than 1,000 burials which had occurred there. Daniels chose a rural cemetery design for Green Lawn. All the sections he laid out varied in size and shape. Lot sizes were anywhere from in size, and also came in a wide range of shapes.\n\nIn February 1864, the trustees of Green Lawn Cemetery offered to exchange burial lots with those individuals who still retained plots at North Graveyard. Green Lawn intended to build homes on the site of the abandoned North Graveyard and lease them in order to generate income. In addition, the Columbus, Chicago and Indiana Central Railway sought to condemn a portion of the burying ground for a railroad right of way. The two offers generated extensive litigation, as lotholders sought to prevent the disinterment of loved ones and those who had deeded land to the city tried to regain title to it. This litigation was not resolved until the late 1870s, and it was not until 1881 that most graves were removed from North Graveyard.\n\nOn April 1, 1872, the cemetery purchased a tract from Samuel Stimmel and a tract from John Stimmel, bringing the cemetery's total size to . In 1887, Green Lawn expanded to , and Green Lawn Avenue opened to create an eastern entrance to the cemetery. In 1898, an iron bridge was built over a ravine between sections 54 and 55. By 1919, all the roads in the cemetery were of macadam, and had gutters.\n\nThe Soldiers and Sailors' Memorial was erected at Green Lawn Cemetery in 1891. Cemetery officials first set aside a section (M) for military burials on June 10, 1862. The Ex-Soldiers and Sailors' Association of Franklin County, a group of Civil War veterans, purchased four lots in section 28 in November 1881 for the interment of veterans. Two years later, the association began a campaign to raise funds for the design and erection of a veterans memorial in that section. Another four lots in section 28 were purchased in January 1886, and in March 1886 the Ohio General Assembly authorized the commissioners of Franklin County to levy a tax to aid in the construction of the memorial. A memorial design was approved in October 1886, and the memorial erected by the New England Granite Works of Hartford, Connecticut. The $8,900 ($ in dollars) memorial was completed in November 1890.\n\nVandals struck Green Lawn Cemetery more than a dozen times beginning in the fall of 2015. The vandals initially knocked over gravestones, but over time the damage worsened. By early 2017, more than 600 monuments were damaged, most of them in historic sections bordering Brown Road (which has no streetlights). Cemetery officials estimated the cost of repairs at more than $1.25 million ($ in dollars). Cemetery officials increased the frequency of nighttime security patrols in the cemetery and installed numerous security cameras in an attempt to stop the vandalism.\n\nIn the wake of the vandalism, cemetery volunteers and instructors at Columbus State Community College created a geographic information system capstone course. Taught by Doreen Whitley Rogers, nonprofit executive and wife of a cemetery trustee, students in the course donated more than $10,000 ($ in dollars) in free consulting services to the cemetery. Damaged graves were identified and damage documented, potential vandal points of entry noted, repair cost analyses generated, and patterns of criminal activity in the cemetery identified.\n\nGreen Lawn officials had long desired to build a chapel at the cemetery ever since its formation in 1848. A site was selected, but cemetery expansion made it less than ideal. A second site was selected, but again expansion rendered the site inappropriate. After the 1887 expansion, the board of directors felt secure enough to select a permanent location for the new chapel. Design and construction were put off until enough funds had been raised to erect a substantial building of excellent materials and workmanship. The fundraising effort neared completion in 1899, at which time the board selected architect Frank Packard to design the chapel. Packard was a natural choice, as he had advised the board for several years on the landscape design and aesthetics of the cemetery.\n\nThis structure, originally called the Mortuary Chapel, was dedicated on November 11, 1902. The chapel is in the Renaissance Revival style, and features a rotunda capped in red vitrified tile. The dome bears a resemblance to the Ohio Statehouse (then still under construction). The structure rests on a bed of gravel below the surface. The foundations are of concrete and stone, and arches of brick and concrete support the building above. The exterior walls are of white marble, while the interior walls are clad in \"English vein\" Italian marble. The main entry doors are bronze and flanked by Ionic columns, while the interior floor is a geometric pattern of black and white tile. The dome, made of leaded art glass, supported by interior pilasters of bronze and marble.\n\nThe chapel contains two murals (depicting Truth and Wisdom), a number of mosaics, and windows of both leaded and stained glass. The art glass murals were designed by Frederick Wilson and executed by Tiffany & Co. The stained glass windows were designed by Tiffany & Co. The north window depicts Peggy Thompson, the first white woman known to die in the area, and the south window Isaac Dalton, a superintendent of the Soldier's Home in Columbus who took special care of wounded soldiers during the American Civil War. Peletiah Huntington, founder of what became Huntington Bancshares, donated the mosaics, murals, and stained glass windows. The rest of the chapel cost $24,000 ($ in dollars). The funeral space in the chapel was dedicated to Huntington in 1902 with the placement of a bronze tablet there.\n\nThe Mortuary Chapel was designed to be a place where funerals could be held. Over time, few funerals were held there. Instead, the public began using the chapel as a meditative space, and requesting to be buried inside it. The chapel was renovated, a west wing with service room and bathrooms added, and a carillon with bells constructed in 1963. The leaded glass rotunda was capped with a concrete dome to protect it. The addition and carillon were in the Neoclassical style. A north wing was completed in 1979. The Thompson stained glass window was removed, and a door cut through to the new wing. The historic window was relocated to the east wall of the new wing, while a new stained glass window and fountain were placed at the west wall of the wing. The north wing serves as an indoor mausoleum.\n\nThe chapel was rededicated in the early 2000s as Huntington Chapel.\n\nGreen Lawn Cemetery is privately owned by the nonprofit Green Lawn Cemetery Association. The cemetery is one of Ohio's most prominent rural (or \"garden\") cemeteries. Any member of the public may purchase a plot.\n\nIn the 21st century, Green Lawn Cemetery contained , making it Ohio's second-largest cemetery. About were undeveloped. This represented roughly three sections, which cemetery officials said should provide burial space for another 100 to 150 years. About of roads wind through the burying ground.\n\nThere are roughly 4,300 trees belonging to 150 species planted at the cemetery. This includes three \"state champion\" trees (the largest and tallest trees of their species anywhere in the state). In 2013, the Audubon Society recognized Green Lawn Cemetery as an \"Important Bird Area\".\n\nAccording to one media report in May 2017, more than 155,000 people were buried at Green Lawn Cemetery. This included 30,000 veterans (most of them buried in six specially set-aside sections), of which 15 were generals and five Medal of Honor recipients. There is also one British Commonwealth war grave, a Royal Air Force Ferry Command officer of World War II.\n\nSections at Green Lawn Cemetery were originally lettered in the order in which they were developed. The cemetery's rapid expansion forced the cemetery to begin numbering sections after running through the alphabet.\n\nThe Hayden family mausoleum is the cemetery's largest. Designed by local architect Frank Packard, it was completed for banker Charles H. Hayden in early 1905. Built at a cost of about $80,000 to $100,000 ($ to $ in dollars), the Neoclassical style tomb had a granite foundation, interior and exterior walls of white Vermont marble, and two Ionic columns on each side of the main entrance. The structure is wide, deep, and has a high dome. The interior is octagonal, and features two columns of marble with a hue like alabaster in each corner. The tomb originally contained eight marble sarcophagi, carved in Italy. The main doors were of bronze. Hayden wanted the construction of the mausoleum to be a surprise for his family, so Packard refused to tell the press or cemetery officials who commissioned the work until it was completed.\n\nA row of small, Egyptian Revival mausoleums in section 65 contains the Packard mausoleum. Architect Frank Packard designed the Packard family mausoleum himself.\n\nNotable individuals buried at the cemetery include:\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2335206", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2335206", "title": "Drachen Fire", "text": "Drachen Fire\n\nDrachen Fire was a steel roller coaster located at Busch Gardens Williamsburg in Williamsburg, Virginia. Manufactured by Arrow Dynamics based on initial designs from industry newcomer Bolliger & Mabillard, the ride opened to the public in 1992. Drachen Fire featured a lift hill, six inversions, and a zero-gravity camelback element. One of the inversions was removed following the 1993 season to improve ride comfort. The track was blue with silver supports, and it was located in the Oktoberfest portion of the park behind Big Bad Wolf and Das Festhaus. It was originally configured with three trains, each consisting of red cars with grey seats, and featured red trim lights that illuminated the trains at night. Drachen Fire was closed in the middle of the 1998 season following a history of low ridership and complaints of roughness. It remained standing until its demolition in 2002.\n\nIn 1991, the Anheuser-Busch Entertainment Corporation announced a myriad of upcoming rides for their various amusement parks. Keith M. Kasen, then General Manager for Busch Gardens Williamsburg, commented on the addition of Drachen Fire for the 1992 season stating, \"Anheuser-Busch has shown a commitment to reinvestment and making a real strong quality statement.\" Construction began in the fall of 1991, which was filmed for its upcoming marketing campaign. Footage of the design, construction, and testing process of Drachen Fire was later documented in a 1993 PBS special of their NOVA program, titled \"Roller Coaster\". Construction of Drachen Fire was completed in early 1992, placing it on schedule to open the same year on April 4.\n\nBusch Gardens heavily marketed the new ride in what was identified as the park's biggest promotional campaign in over a decade dating back to Loch Ness Monster in 1978. The tagline marketed for the ride was \"Feel the Heat\". The park hired comedian Dana Carvey to meet and greet visitors, as well as cut the ribbon at a special preview opening ceremony on April 3, 1992. After six or seven successful runs during the preview event, a train stalled on the lift hill forcing passengers to evacuate. During the downtime, Carvey offered an impromptu stand-up comedy routine to entertain the crowd and keep guests occupied. When the ride resumed operation, another train stalled on the lift hill again forcing the park to close the ride for the remainder of the evening. For its official opening to the public the following day, Drachen Fire remained closed all morning and eventually opened midday.\n\nThe ride drew large crowds and was initially well-received by many coaster enthusiasts. American Coaster Enthusiasts President Ray J. Ueberroth called the coaster \"an outstanding ride\", and the group's former president, Randy Geisler, stated, \"I can just say it's spectacular.\" However, less than a month after opening, the coaster gained a reputation for its roughness. Passengers were routinely advised by announcers to remove clip-on earrings before riding and keep their heads pressed against headrests during the ride. After increasing complaints, the park removed the diving corkscrew element between the block brakes and the cutback element for the 1995 season.\n\nDrachen Fire was featured on a 1996 edition of \"Theme Parks a Go-Go\" on the E! Network. The segment was hosted by actor Alex Winter who was shown riding the Drachen, at the time fastest coaster in the park, through some of its inversions. Upon completion of the ride, he stated that his vertebra was snapped like a twig. Although famous at that time for his comedic roles, this comment stands as a testimony to the Drachen Fire's reputation for being a rough experience.\n\nThe removal of the diving corkscrew element failed to resolve ongoing issues with ride safety and comfort. With decreasing ridership and at least one lawsuit filed, Busch Gardens closed Drachen Fire abruptly in July 1998. Initially, the park had plans to modify the coaster, but it was ultimately listed for sale. The park had several offers but failed to reach agreements with prospective buyers. It remained standing in an idle state until 2002, when the decision was made to dismantle the ride and recycle the steel. Director of public relations Cindy Sarko stated, \"There had been a steady erosion of ridership ... That, combined with the high operating expenses of the ride, helped park officials make the decision to shut it down.\"\n\nAfter leaving the station, the ride made a small dip and turned 180 degrees to the left, where it entered the lift hill. At the top of the 150 foot lift, the ride made a shallow dive of around 50 feet, then entered a wraparound corkscrew which had an apex of 120 feet, before descending the remainder of a curving drop, ending up facing the opposite direction of the lift hill, and achieving a speed of 60 miles per hour. The ride then entered a first of a kind camel back hump hill, which was designed to balance the riders between positive and negative g-forces, giving a feeling of weightlessness. The ride then entered the Batwing element (cobra roll), which featured two inversions in one element. The ride then turned up an ascending hill to the left, and entered a run of Block Brakes. Next, the ride dove down into a corkscrew, then a slight left turn over the park midway into a cutback. The ride then traversed back over the midway, under the first corkscrew and entered a second corkscrew. It then quickly entered a counter-clockwise helix. Exiting the helix, the ride made a right hand turn onto a final brake run, which would then lead straight into the ride station.\n\nThe majority of Drachen Fire’s track was located behind the present day Verbolten ride, in an area now called Festhaus Park. A large elevated curve in the ride did extend over the concrete walkway and into the area behind Das Festhaus, near the Black Forest Picnic Area, before looping riders back around again into a corkscrew.\n\nTo enter the ride area guests would pass through a metal framed gateway, whose arches held the Drachen Fire sign. Today that same passage leads to Festhaus Park, a multi-purpose area used sporadically as a concert venue and for various special events. While most attractions have a highly visible entrance that can be seen from quite a distance, this was not the case for Drachen Fire. Guests had to pass between the Der Autobahn ride, to the left, and the large Das Festhaus building, to the right. This may have made the ride more difficult to locate for some park guests and could offer an insight as to why no permanent major attraction exists in this location today, despite several rides being added to the park since the 2002 dismantling.\n\nAt least three of the major structures created for the ride still exist on the property today, all of which are located beyond the Festhaus Park gateway. A park map from 1997 shows the wooden building containing 5 metal roll up doors, which resides on the left side of the concrete walkway, was the Drachen Fire gift shop. The previous ride boarding station is the largest wooden building located inside the Festhaus Park area and a slightly smaller wooden building served as the maintenance facility. Some portions of all three buildings are visible during daylight hours, shortly after crossing the Rhine River, while looking right (towards the park) on the Busch Gardens Railway train ride. In June 2019, local network affiliate WAVY-TV reported that a plan was approved by local officials to construct a new ride in the former Drachen Fire location that would be approximately in height.\n\nIn 2006, Busch Gardens began to use the former \"Drachen Fire\" site as a concert venue.\n\nIn 2009, Busch started holding the Glory at the Gardens concert series in Festhaus Park due to overflowing The Royal Palace Theatre in Aquitane.\n\nIn 2016, Busch Gardens began selling Drachen Fire T-shirts at the park for the first time since the ride's closure.\n\nIn 1999, Arrow implemented the same B&M-style support structure used on Drachen Fire for the Tennessee Tornado at Dollywood.\n\n"}

Her City Council tenure ran 12 years, representing the city's Fifth District. Wyman was highly influential in bringing the Brooklyn Dodgers from New York to Chavez Ravine, Los Angeles. She helped lead the successful campaigns of Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) and as of 2019 charts as California's oldest DNC delegate. She has served on the UNESCO Commission and has sat as a member of boards ranging from the National Endowment for the Arts to the Los Angeles County Arts Commission to the American Friends of the Hebrew University Board; she has also acted as chairperson for a variety of entities, including the Community Relations Committee of the Los Angeles Jewish Community Council and the National Congressional Committee Dinner. She is known as a hefty proponent of multi-faith religious tolerance efforts.\n\nRosalind Wiener was born October 4, 1930 in Los Angeles to Oscar and Sarah (née Selten) Wiener. Her father was a Russian immigrant who came to the country as a stowaway; after arriving, he put himself through pharmacy school. Mrs. Wiener, originally from Chicago, only graduated from high school but became a pharmacist as well so she could co-run the drugstore the family had at 9th Street and Western Avenue (in today's Koreatown), which included a 22-seat lunch counter. Mrs. Wiener also worked as a volunteer at the juvenile hall in Los Angeles, where a room was named in her honor. She also served as a precinct captain for Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s first presidential campaign. Rosalind learned how to add by helping work her parents' cash register and doling out ice cream to patrons.\n\nRosalind consistently ran for office in grade school, earning a position while at officer at Los Angeles High School. One of her early political inspirations was Congresswoman Helen Gahagan Douglas, and while still in high school, she chose to do a report on her. Rosalind graduated in 1948, subsequently attending the University of Southern California. During this time, she was able to seek out Gahagan Douglas and volunteer on her Senate campaign. She graduated from USC in 1952 with a bachelor of science degree in public administration.\nAfter college, she gained employment as a recreation director and made plans to go to law school but before grad school could happen, she was elected to the City Council, 1953. She deferred enrollment to campaign for Adlai Stevenson.\n\nRosalind married attorney Eugene Wyman in 1954, and they had three children--Betty Lynn, Robert, and Brad. The family are Conservative Jews. Eugene Wyman, who was also influential in national Democratic politics, died of a heart attack in January 1973.\n\n\"See also List of Los Angeles municipal election returns, 1953 and after.\"\nIn the 1950s Los Angeles City Council District 5 was part of the Wilshire Boulevard area, extending to Westwood and West Los Angeles. In 1965 it covered an area from Fairfax Avenue to the San Diego Freeway and from Bel-Air and Beverly Hills south to Washington Boulevard.\n\nIn 1953, Rosalind Wiener campaigned in the 5th District to succeed Councilman George P. Cronk, with the aid of a swarm of University of Southern California students, and she \"pulled a surprise\" to finish first in the primary election, ahead of public accountant Elmer Marshrey. In the final, she won just 52% of the vote and took her seat for a four-year term as the youngest council member ever elected and only the second woman—the first having been Estelle Lawton Lindsey in 1915.\n\nShe was reelected in the primaries in 1957 and 1961. She was soundly beaten, though, by Edmund D. Edelman in the final election of 1965. One writer opined that it was Wyman's stand on the council to turn over Chavez Ravine to the baseball Dodgers, and the resulting expulsion of displaced residents, most of them Mexican-Americans, that was \"a major—if not decisive— reason\" for her loss. Another said it was \"a bitter battle with Mayor Sam Yorty\" that \"brought about her defeat.\"\n\nIn 1975, after she was widowed, she campaigned to win back her old seat, \"but the race turned ugly when Wyman was attacked [...] as an out-of-touch imperialist, more impressed with her national endorsements than with local issues.\" Wyman finished third, after Fran Savitch (Mayor Bradley's choice) and Zev Yaroslavsky, the eventual winner.\n\nColiseum. The first resolution she introduced in the council a week after she was seated in 1953 called on the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum Commission to permit the local American Legion to stage a baseball game in the Coliseum as a demonstration that the venue would be \"a proper place to stage major league baseball.\" In 1958 she was named the City Council's first representative on the Coliseum Commission as a result of a referendum vote by citizens that the council should be represented along with the city Recreation and Parks Department, the county Board of Supervisors and the state's 6th Agricultural District. At that time the Dodgers were preparing the stadium to use as a temporary field before Chavez Ravine was ready.\n\nHonor. Wyman was chosen \"Woman of the Year\" for 1958 by the \"Los Angeles Times.\"\n\nFeud. She was \"so critical of [Mayor] Sam Yorty that a columnist wrote, 'their vendetta has replaced the La Brea Tar Pits as one of our major tourist attractions.' \"\n\nLeader. By the end of her third term, Wyman had emerged as enough of a leader on the council that she was elected president pro tem.\n\nBaseball. She remained attached to the Dodgers and purchased eight season tickets directly through owner Walter O'Malley, paid for by her husband's law firm. After he died, she had to sue the firm to get them back.\n\nComic books. She worked to ban \"horror comic books\" from public sale in drugstores and \"other places frequented by children.\"\n\nCommissions. She urged the abolition of commissions with any authority over departments and installing \"appeal and advisory boards\" in their place.\n\nIn 1973, Wyman served as Chairperson of the National Congressional Committee Dinner. In 1974, she was named to head fundraising for the Democratic Congressional campaigns, and she served as chair and chief executive officer of the 1984 Democratic National Convention in San Francisco.

It is historically affiliated with the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) and the Christian churches and churches of Christ. In March 2020, it was announced that NCU will be changing its name to Bushnell University in May 2020.\n\nThe school was founded as a divinity school in 1895 by Disciple of Christ preacher and educator Eugene Claremont Sanderson as the Eugene Divinity School (EDS). In 1908 it became Eugene Bible University; in 1930 that name changed to Eugene Bible College. Finally, after a merger with Spokane University in 1934, it became known as Northwest Christian College and then Northwest Christian University in 2008.\n\nOn December 8, 2009, Dr. Joseph Womack was named as Northwest Christian University's 10th president, taking office on June 1, 2010. Womack is the son of NCU's eighth president, Dr. James Womack, who served from 1986 to 2004.\n\n\nNorthwest Christian University is organized into two schools: Liberal Arts & Bible, and Professional Studies. The School of Liberal Arts & Bible houses the academic majors of Biology, Communication, English, Exercise Science, History, Interdisciplinary Studies, Mathematics, Psychology, Bible and Theology, Christian Ministry, and Music. The School of Professional Studies includes both undergraduate majors in Accounting, Business Administration, Criminal Justice, and Teacher Education as well as graduate programs in Business Administration, Clinical Mental Health Counseling, School Counseling, and Teacher Education. Programs are offered in three different formats: traditional undergraduate daytime, adult degree evening and online, and graduate.\n\nNorthwest Christian University has been regionally accredited since 1962 by the Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities (NWCCU). It is a member of the Oregon Alliance of Independent Colleges and Universities (OAICU), the Council for Christian Colleges and Universities (CCCU), and the Council on Undergraduate Research (CUR). The education programs are approved by the Oregon Teacher Standards and Practices Commission (TSPC), the business programs are accredited by the International Assembly of Collegiate Business Education (IACBE), and the Clinical Mental Health Counseling programs is CACREP accredited (2017)(Council for Accreditation of Counseling and Related Educational Programs) .\n\nNorthwest Christian University is located in east Eugene, at the corner of Alder Street and E. 11th Avenue, separated from the larger University of Oregon by the width of a single lane street. Founder Eugene Sanderson envisioned a school at which students would study the Bible and principles of Christian ministry under Eugene Divinity School's faculty, but take other subjects on the neighboring campus, a model he also attempted to set up at Manhattan Christian College, located near Kansas State University. The Eugene Divinity School and its successive institutions maintained this arrangement with the University of Oregon until 1995, when the University of Oregon unilaterally discontinued it. Since that time NCU has grown to become a comprehensive liberal arts college. Today, NCU students occasionally take University of Oregon classes, have checkout privileges from Knight Library, and take advantage of lectures and other events on the neighboring campus.\n\nNorthwest Christian teams, nicknamed athletically as the Beacons, are part of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA), primarily competing in the Cascade Collegiate Conference (CCC). Men's sports include basketball, cross country, golf, soccer and track & field; while women's sports include basketball, cross country, golf, soccer, softball, track & field and volleyball. The \"Beacons\" name and team colors are not expected to be affected by the university's name change.\n\n2015 NAIA Cross Country National Championship\"\nDuring the fall of 2015 the woman's cross country team won 1st place in the NAIA Cross Country National Championship in Charlotte, North Carolina.

The order makes no claims of direct descent from the old Knights Templar and holds that, when made, such self-styled claims are both historically and canonically false.\n\nThe Militia was formed civilly and with the approval of the local ordinary on September 21, 1979. Its constitutions were approved on Sept. 8, 1988 by the Archbishop of Siena Mario Jsmaele Castellano. The next Archbishop, Gaetano Bonicelli approved the Rule of the Militia in 1990. The Cardinal Protectors of the Militia Templi were Silvio Oddi, Édouard Gagnon and Alfons Maria Stickler. The current Protector is the Right Reverend Phillip Lawrence,OSB, Abbot of the Benedictine Monastery of Christ in the Desert located in New Mexico, USA.\n\nAccording to its constitutions, the Militia has both married and celibate members. Professed Knights consecrate themselves perpetually to the Militia with the investiture and the promise to observe the three classic evangelical counsels as well as the public testimony of faith (fourth promise). The knights engage in different apostolates organized at the Preceptory and commandry level, each Knight is required to provide some type of service to the Church. They are obliged to live by their Rule and recite daily the Hours of the traditional Divine Office, do at least of quarter of an hour of mental prayer a day, go to confession monthly, make several annual retreats, have a spiritual director, engage in an apostolate, and perform the Ignatian exercises every 2 years. Their members include several hundred Knights, 10 national preceptories, many local priorates and scout groups.\n\nThe order's Magistral See, or headquarters, is situated in the Castello della Magione. It is a former Templar compound that lies in the village of Poggibonsi in the Tuscany region of Italy. Built in the 11th century, the castle was donated by its owners; Gottifredo di Arnolfo and Arnolfino di Cristofano to the monks of the Saint Michael Abbey in Poggio Marturi who later bestowed it to the Templars for use as one of their numerous \"Mansiones\" or \"Domus Templi\" along the Via Francigena. After 1312 the Castello della Magione passed through many hands, including the Hospitallers and the Princess Corsini, until, in 1979 it was purchased by Count Marcello Alberto Cristofani della Magione, the founder and current Grand Master of the Militia Templi. Attached to the castle is a church, also restored, with impressive Burgundian-Cistercian influence and is used daily by the order for the community recitation of Vespers and the celebration of the Tridentine Mass.\n\nThe symbol of the Militiae Templi is a red eight-pointed (\"octagonal\") cross, symbol of the Eight Beatitudes of the Gospel, while the symbol is a white flag with red octagonal cross. The cross is not to be confused with that of the medieval Knights Hospitaller, which is known as the Maltese Cross. The habit of the Professed Knights is white and consists of a tunic, a scapular with cowl and the octagonal red cross on the chest, and a mantle with the same cross on the left shoulder. Ladies wear a white mantle and a white veil with a donat's cross (without the top section). Chaplains are dressed with a white Mozzetta with red edge, red buttons and an octagonal red cross on the left front part. The Oblati (Knights and Ladies of Devotion) have a gray mantle with the red octagonal cross on the left shoulder.\n\nThe Militia Templi through Preceptories or Magistral Legations, is currently present in the following countries: Italy, Australia, Austria, Canada, Germany, Switzerland, United Kingdom, Ireland, Poland, Romania, Spain, United States of America, Puerto Rico(1 Knight, 2 Novices), and Hungary.\n\n\n\n"}

He was known by that name throughout NATO's intelligence services. The code-name was chosen as an English word so that the KGB would assume he worked for the CIA if it learned his codename.\n\nHis history inspired the book \"Bonjour Farewell: La Vérité sur la Taupe Française du KGB\" (1997) by Sergei Kostin. It was loosely adapted for the French film \"L'affaire Farewell\" (2009), starring Emir Kusturica, Guillaume Canet and Alexandra Maria Lara.\n\nAuthors Sergei Kostin and Eric Raynaud have published a more complete and updated account of the Farewell dossier under the title \"Adieu Farewell\" (Laffont, Paris, 2009). This title became available in English for the first time in 2011, some thirty years after the events.\n\nVladimir Vetrov was born in 1932 and grew up within the Soviet Union. After college, where he studied electronic engineering, he was enlisted in the KGB.\n\nHe lived in France for five years, beginning in 1965 when posted there as a Line X officer working for the KGB's 'Directorate T', which specialized in obtaining information about advanced science and technology from western countries. While there, he befriended Jacques Prévost, an engineer working with Thomson-CSF. Vetrov returned to Moscow at the end of his posting, with a subsequent posting to Montreal, though Vetrov was recalled prematurely for reasons that are unclear.\n\nThere, he rose through the ranks of Directorate T, eventually supervising the evaluation of the intelligence collected by Line X agents around the world, and passing key information to the relevant users inside the Soviet Union. Having become increasingly disillusioned with the Communist system, he decided to pass important state secrets to the west for purely ideological reasons, though he eventually and reluctantly accepted 25,500 rubles (roughly equivalent to 4 years of his salary). At the end of 1980, he contacted Prévost, by then working in Russia, who operated as a liaison to the French DST and offered his services to the West.\n\nBetween the spring of 1981 and early 1982, Vetrov gave the DST almost 4,000 secret documents, including the complete official list of 250 Line X officers stationed under legal cover in embassies around the world and a breakdown of the Soviet espionage effort to obtain scientific, industrial and technical information from the West. Members of the GRU, the Soviet Academy of Sciences, and several other bodies all took part in such efforts. Vetrov also provided summaries on the goals, achievements, and unfilled objectives of the program. He identified nearly 100 leads to sources in 16 countries.\n\nThis information received by DST allowed France to expel 47 KGB agents from France on April 5, 1983. Arrests were also made, including Pierre Bourdiol, which was considered a \"faux pas\" in the espionage community, as it was considered a violation of protocol to burn one's own recruit.\n\nIn February 1982, after heavy drinking caused by a cooling-off period imposed by the French, who were fearful of his discovery through too much contact, Vetrov stabbed his mistress during an argument in his car (she survived). When a man knocked on the car window, Vetrov thought his spying had been discovered, so he stabbed and killed the man. He happened to be an auxiliary policeman, likely looking for a bribe from what he thought were two people having sex in a highway median. Vetrov was arrested, tried, and sentenced to 12 years in jail in the fall of 1982.\n\nWhile in jail, Vetrov carelessly revealed in letters that he had been involved in \"something big\" before going to jail. Subsequent to that, portions of the list of Line X agents (in Vetrov's handwriting) were given to partner nations (resulting in further expulsions), one of whom had a mole which passed that portion back to the KGB, which was the \"smoking gun\" required to confirm their suspicions. The KGB eventually discovered that he was a double agent. As part of his confession, Vetrov wrote a blistering denunciation of the Soviet system, \"The Confession of a Traitor\". News of his subsequent execution reached France in March 1985.\n\nThe information which Vetrov provided enabled the western countries to expel nearly 150 Soviet technology spies around the world, including the 47 mentioned above, most of whom were from Line X. This caused the collapse of the Soviet's information program at a time when it was particularly crucial. The U.S. created a massive operation to provide the Soviets with faulty data and sabotaged parts for certain technologies, as a consequence of the Farewell Dossier. Vetrov was also responsible for exposing the spy Dieter Gerhardt, a senior officer in the South African Navy who had been spying for the Soviets for 20 years. Vetrov also provided information hinting at a Polish coup d'état (eventually found to be that by Wojciech Jaruzelski), and alleging a link between the Soviet Union and the assassination attempt on Pope John Paul II.\n\n\n\n"}

In February 2013, the T'sou-ke Nation had 251 registered members, with two reserves around the Sooke Basin on the Strait of Juan de Fuca at the southern end of Vancouver Island, with a total area of 67 hectares (165 acres). The T'Souk-e people are the namesake of the town of Sooke, British Columbia and its surrounding harbour and basin.\n\nThe name \"T'Sou-ke\" is derived from the Sook tribe of Straits Salishans. Their name was derived from the SENĆOŦEN language word T'Sou-ke, the name of the species of Stickleback fish that live in the estuary of the river. The T'Sou-ke came into contact with Europeans through the Hudson's Bay Company. The anglicized version of the SENĆOŦEN word was first Soke (pronounced \"soak\") and then Sooke. The name of T'Sou-ke Nation's neighbouring town, river and basin and the main road, are based on the anglicized name, Sooke.\n\nThe language of the T'Sou-ke Nation is the T'Sou-ke dialect of the SENĆOŦEN (which linguists call Northern Straits Salish) of the Coast Salish languages, a subgroup of the Salishan language family. Chief Planes states, \"At one time all our people spoke the language and it was not English. It was SENĆOŦEN, the language that we share with our neighbours at Scia'new and others around Victoria and Saanich.\" No one is currently fluent in the language, but language initiatives are encouraged using current technology, including online tools such as First Voices.\n\n\"The First Nations that speak this language do not have a single name for the language. Instead, there is a different name for the language in each dialect: SENĆOŦEN, Malchosen, Lekwungen, Semiahmoo, and T’Sou-ke...These five dialects are spoken by the W̱SÁNEĆ (Saanich) peoples and their closely related neighbours from the north coast of the Olympic Peninsula in Washington, the Gulf and San Juan Islands, southern Vancouver Island and the southern edge of the Lower Mainland in British Columbia.\" This locations are marked on the First Peoples' Language Map British Columbia.\n\nThe Sook tribe of Straits Salishans were nearly annihilated in a combined attack of the Cowichans, Clallums and Nitinahts launched about 1848. The people were exposed to Europeans relatively early by association with the Hudson's Bay Company. The nation is a signatory to the Douglas Treaties. When British Columbia joined Canada in 1871, the Province did not recognize Aboriginal title and no further treaties were made. However, \"the Province did accept the rights of Aboriginal people as written in the Canadian Constitution and recognized the federal government’s authority to make laws for Aboriginal people and their lands.\" Accordingly, the existing reserves were allotted by the Joint Reserve Commission in 1877.\n\nThe T'Sou-ke Nation is represented by the Te'mexw Treaty Association along with four other Coast Salish First Nations. They entered the B.C. treaty process in 1995.\n\nOn 26 February 2013 T'Sou-ke Nation and the Province of British Columbia signed an Incremental Treaty Agreement (ITA). An ITA is a legally-binding pre-treaty agreement negotiated between the Province of British Columbia and First Nations at a treaty negotiation table. ITAs are intended to build trust among the parties, create incentives to reach further milestones and provide increased certainty over land and resources. The province reports that \"negotiations are making steady progress and have successfully resolved a number of difficult issues that include governance, land, resources and fiscal matters.\" The negotiations are at stage 4, Agreement-in-Principle.\n\nThe Te'mexw Treaty Association reports that the ITA is a multi-year agreement that includes the transfer of two side-by-side 60-hectare parcels of Crown land located at Broom Hill within the nation's traditional territory in the Juan de Fuca Electoral Area. The land transfers are intended to provide the T'Sou-ke Nation with forestry and light industrial development opportunities that support employment and new sources of revenue. The lands will be held in fee simple by the T'Sou-ke Nation, under a First Nation-designated company, and will be subject to the same federal and provincial laws and municipal bylaws and regulations as with any other privately held property.\n\nThe T'Sou-ke Nation is governed by the chief and two councillors elected every two years under the Indian Act election system. In February 2014, Chief Gordon Planes was re-elected for his fourth term since 2008. Councillors are Rose Dumont and Allan G. Planes.\n\nAt the regional level, the T'Sou-ke Nation is represented by the Naut'sa mawt Tribal Council, where Chief Planes currently serves as secretary.\n\nIn 2008, \"guided by the ancestral custom of looking ahead seven generations, the community prepared a vision with four goals: self-sufficiency in energy and food, economic independence – or as Chief Planes has said, 'No more living off the dole' – and a return to traditional ways and values.\" Chief Planes stated: “We used to live sustainably, and only took what we needed from the land. We need to get back to that.\" \n\nThe T'Sou-ke Nation Health Centre, part of the Sooke Integrated Health Network, operates in cooperation with the Vancouver Island Health Authority and the Inter Tribal Health Authority. Medical professionals visit the community regularly. Special clinics are held regularly for matters such as mammograms and flu shots; and workshops on health and wellness are also held on issues such as nutrition, baby programs, and diabetes.\n\nChief Gordon Planes states: \"First Nations have lived for thousands of years on this continent without fossil fuels. It is appropriate that First Nations lead the way out of dependency and addiction to fossil fuels and to rely on the power of the elements, the sun, the wind and the sea once again.\" The T'Sou-ke Nation has become a leader in green initiatives, including mentoring other communities.\n\nIn 2009, the community built \"a 400-panel solar photovoltaic system that generates 50 per cent more electricity than the next largest in the province.\" \nPower bills at the three administrative offices dropped by 100 per cent. In 2009 and 2010, hot-water solar panels were installed on the roofs of 42 of the 86 buildings on the reserve. The energy savings are such that the T'Sou-ke Nation is able to sell its surplus to BC Hydro in the summer, and buy it back in the winter when needed, resulting in zero bills. \n\nIn 2013, the T'Sou-ke Nation was the third Canadian community to be awarded official Solar City Designation by the Canadian Solar Cities Project.\n\nEnergy-saving measures were also taken in the homes of community members, such as extra roof insulation, new appliances to replace obsolete ones, and energy-saving light bulbs. \n\nPlans are underway to \"develop, build and operate $750-million in large-scale wind power projects on Vancouver Island.\"\n\nIn 2014, the T'Sou-ke started a project that will harness wave power from the ocean to create energy.\n\nBy 2013, the T'Sou-ke community was developing community greenhouses to grow peppers, tomatoes, and eventually a cash crop of wasabi (Japanese horseradish) for export. The ultimate result hoped for is a \"zero-mile diet\".\n\nIn 2014, 15,000 wasabi seedlings had been planted in three greenhouses, which would be harvested in 15 months' time. Profits from the wasabi farm are planned to help expand an existing organic community garden and a 70-hectare oyster farm pilot project in the Sooke Basin. The main market for wasabi is in its medicinal qualities, which is consistent with First Nations traditions of using plants to heal. \n\nIn 2008, the Ladybug Garden and Greenhouse was started to harvest fresh produce and herbs for the community, as well as a means to preserve native plants and knowledge about how to find them.\n\n\n"}

It also denotes a perspective that views church and state as tied together instead of separate entities so that people within a geographical and political region are considered members of the dominant ecclesiastical institution.\n\nChristian sacralism is, according to Verduin, the hybrid product that resulted from the colossal change known as the Constantinian shift that began early in the fourth century AD, when Christianity was granted official tolerance in the Roman Empire by the Emperor Constantine, and was completed by the Emperor Theodosius's declaration in 392 outlawing paganism and making Christianity the official religion of the Empire. This resulted in the so-called age of Christian sacralism when Roman citizens who did not necessarily subscribe to the faith are coerced into it for fear of social discrimination and outright persecution. This lasted until the Reformation when Christians gradually moved away from sacralism.\n\nA Latin saying that has often been used to describe the principle of sacralism is cuius regio, eius religio, or \"who has region, decides religion.\" The idea was that the ruler of each individual area would decide the religion of those under his control based upon his own faith.\n\nA country where Islam is a dominant religion is also an example of sacralism. Here, there is a general tendency to confuse religious dimension with other spheres like politics and the law and such confusion is viewed by Muslims as a compact and positive unity of all aspects of life.\n\n\n"}

Wilkinson beat Cassidy in the new geography by a lopsided 14,485-to-4,167 vote. He was easily reelected in the 1971 primary, but in 1975 his victory was narrower—20,391 for Wilkinson in the final and 20,068 for challenger Barbara Klein. He did not run for reelection in 1979.\n\nWilkinson was known as a hard-line conservative who could be loud at times. Some of the highlights of his Council service:\n\nTrout. Trout-fishing trips that he organized for Valley politicians to Mammoth Lakes aroused controversy when it was found that the groups received free use of cabins owned by the city's independent Los Angeles Department of Water and Power. The fishermen then began paying for their lodgings.\n\nHutchinson. Wilkinson successfully opposed a 1968 attempt by Mayor Sam Yorty to appoint Roger S. Hutchinson to the Library Commission after the councilman cited a series of \"Los Angeles Times\" articles that linked Hutchinson to conflicts of interest that occurred when he sat on the city's Board of Zoning Adjustment. Hutchinson later withdrew his name.\n\nVietnam. In 1970, he submitted a resolution, approved unanimously by the council, condemning \"in the strongest terms the repressive, cruel and uncivilized treatment\" of American and allied prisoners by the North Vietnamese during the Vietnam War.\n\nCentury Plaza. As chairman of a Council committee investigating a 1968 protest against a speech by President Lyndon B. Johnson, which turned into the Century Plaza riot, Wilkinson said that \"some undue force\" was used by the officers but that \"If some of the good citizens were handled rather roughly in the ensuing melee, probably they should blame the parade leaders rather than the police.\" He said his committee would begin discussion of a new parade ordinance.\n\nVoting, He opposed a 1969 proposal to lower the voting age from 21 to 19 because he feared a leftist trend in younger voters and didn't \"buy the argument that if they are old enough to fight in Vietnam they are old enough to vote.\"\n\nPro tem. Wilkinson was elected president pro tem of the council in 1973.\n\nAfter his first stint on the council, he was the executive secretary of the city's Harbor Commission for nearly nine years until, he said, he was ousted by Mayor Sam Yorty. He sued four former Harbor commissioners, claiming they forced him out of the department in 1965 because he interfered with their \"Illegal and unethical practices for their personal profit.\" The defendants included former City Council member Karl L. Rundberg, who was facing jail after being convicted of bribery at the Harbor.\n\nWilkinson was later on the board of the 51st District Agricultural Association, sponsor of the San Fernando Valley Fair.\n\nHe was also a candidate for mayor in the 1969 election, challenging Mayor Yorty without risking his council seat. He finished fifth of fourteen in the April primary election with 2,682 of the 702,788 votes cast. \n\nWhen he left the council, he \"created a furor\" when he decided to keep for his personal use $44,932.48 in unspent campaign funds.\n\nWilkinson became a top-paid registered lobbyist, earning nearly half a million dollars from the Porter Ranch Company alone. He was officially a real estate broker and investment counselor. He said his links with City Hall were not important. \"I'm just a country boy, doing my thing,\" he said. \"I don't drive a Mercedes-Benz. Nor a Jaguar. I'm a station-wagon person.\"\n\nOne of his clients was pop star Michael Jackson, who sought zoning variances for his Encino district estate on Hayvenhurst Avenue that would have allowed him to add a giraffe to his backyard zoo. Jackson wanted to maintain a seventeen-foot-high fence instead of the legally allowed six feet. He withdrew his request after neighbors objected.\n\nAnother client was the Islamic Center of Northridge, which needed planning and zoning permission to build the Valley's first mosque, in Granada Hills.\n\n\nA senior center is named for him in Northridge.\n"}

Ronnie Hawkins was his cousin.\n\nHe began recording in 1956. In 1957, Hawkins was playing at Shreveport, Louisiana clubs, and although his music was influenced by the new rock and roll style of Elvis Presley and the guitar sounds of Scotty Moore, Hawkins blended that with the uniquely heavy blues sound of black Louisiana artists for his recording of his swamp-rock classic, \"Susie Q.\" Fellow Louisiana guitarist and future Rock and Roll Hall of Famer James Burton provided the signature riff and solo.\n\nThe song was chosen as one of The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll. An accompanying album, \"Oh! Suzy Q \" was released in 1958. Creedence Clearwater Revival's version of the song on their 1968 debut album helped launch their career and today it is probably the best-known version.\n\nIn 1958 Hawkins recorded a single of Willie Dixon's \"My Babe\" at the Chess Records studio in Chicago, featuring Telecaster guitarist Roy Buchanan. He went on to a long and successful career. He recorded more songs for Chess into the early 1960s. However, his career was not limited to recording or performing. He hosted a teen dance party, \"The Dale Hawkins Show,\" on WCAU-TV in Philadelphia. He then became a record producer, and found success with The Uniques' \"Not Too Long Ago,\" the Five Americans' \"Western Union,\" and Bruce Channel's \"Hey! Baby\". In 1998, Ace Records issued a compilation album, \"Dale Hawkins, Rock 'n' Roll Tornado\", which contained a collection of his early works and previously unreleased material. Other recordings included his 1969 country rock album, \"L.A., Memphis & Tyler, Texas\"; and a 1999 release, \"Wildcat Tamer\", of all-new recordings that garnered Hawkins a 4-star review in \"Rolling Stone\".\n\nHe was executive vice president of Abnak Records; Vice President, Southwest Division, Bell Records (here he produced Bruce Channel, Ronnie Self, James Bell, the Festivals, the Dolls, and the Gentrys); and A&R director, RCA West Coast Rock Division, working with Michael Nesmith and Harry Nilsson.

The mouthpiece is typically constructed by inserting a grooved plug into one end of the tube, and cutting an edged opening in the tube a short distance away from the plug.\n\nSimilar but not identical instruments were made by peasants in Poland, usually using a different method described in sources as \"\"kręcenie\"\" (that nowadays means literally \"rolling\", at that time possibly also \"drilling-gouging\"), \"\"ukręcanie\"\", \"\"ulinianie\"\" (nowadays literally meaning: \"making moulted\"). Such instruments are mentioned in folk poems or songs.\n\nThe willow flute is a type of overtone flute. It is played by varying the force of the air blown into the mouthpiece, with the end of the tube being covered by the finger or left open. The tones produced are based on the harmonic series. Playing the instrument with the end of the tube covered produces one fundamental and its overtones, playing it with the end of the tube left open produces another fundamental and series of overtones. Willow flutes cannot play an equal tempered scale.\n\nModern willow flutes are typically made of plastic (PVC tubing is often used), but the original willow flutes were made from sections of bark cut from green willow branches. Willow flutes could only be made this way during the spring, and became unplayable when the bark dried out.\n\nNoted modern willow flute artists include the group Hedningarna and Anders Norudde of Sweden. Other Scandinavian groups that use the Seljefløyte in traditional arrangements include Eivind Groven, Steinar Ofsdal, Lilllebjørn Nilsen , Groupa and Bask.\n\nThere is also a Karelian variant of the willow flute that is made in Finnish Karelia and the Russian Republic of Karelia. It is made the same way as the willow flute, but instead of willow bark, it is made out of birch bark. The Karelian Folk Music Ensemble, based out of Petrozavodsk in Russian Karelia, uses this instrument in their music.\n\n"}

He was one of the young men known as Red Sticks, who became a prophet for expulsion of the European Americans from Creek territory and a revival of traditional practices. The Red Sticks attracted a majority of the population in the Upper Towns in the early nineteenth century. From open conflict with the Lower Towns in the Creek War, the Red Sticks were drawn into conflict with the United States after being attacked by territorial militia.\n\nThe Red Sticks were defeated by Colonel Andrew Jackson with state militias, Creek and Cherokee warriors at Horseshoe Bend in 1814. McQueen survived to retreat into Florida, along with other Creek warriors. There he joined the recently formed Seminole and continued resistance to United States forces during the First Seminole War.\n\nPeter McQueen was the son of a high-status Creek woman and a Scots-Irish fur trader, as was typical of many mixed-race alliances between Native Americans and European Americans in the American Southeast in those years. He was born in the \"Talisi\" area (now Tallassee, Alabama). Both cultures considered such marriages or unions as strategic alliances, as the traders brought goods of both practical use and prestige, and offered entree to European society.\n\nAs the Creek culture was matrilineal, McQueen derived his social status from his mother's family and clan. He identified as Creek. Traditionally, for a Creek boy, his maternal uncles were more important than his biological father, as the eldest uncle would introduce him to men's ways and the men's societies of his clan and tribe.\n\nInfluenced by the thought of the Shawnee prophet Tenskwatawa and his brother, the chief Tecumseh, McQueen was one of several young Creek prophets who envisioned the expulsion of the European Americans from Native American lands. They were angered by the failure of Big Warrior and other assimilated Creek headmen to be more responsive to their people. The traditional lines of communication had been disrupted by Benjamin Hawkins, the US Superintendent of Indian Affairs in the Southeast, who lived among the Creek. McQueen became aligned with the Red Stick faction of the Upper Creek, who were trying to resist assimilation and to restore traditional culture and religion.\n\nConflicts rose between the Upper Creek towns and the Lower Creek, who had adopted more European-American ways, developing into violence in the spring of 1813. The Red Sticks began to attack plantations of their enemies, destroying crops and livestock.\n\nThat July, McQueen commanded a party of Red Sticks who went to Spanish Florida to procure arms. On their return to present-day Alabama, they were ambushed by territorial militia and scattered. The Red Sticks regrouped and defeated the militia who were looting their packs, at what became called the Battle of Burnt Corn. European-American settlers on the frontier became alarmed and started spending more time in fortified settlements.\n\nThe next month, in August 1813, McQueen took part in the attack on Fort Mims, in the Tensaw, Alabama area. It was a center of plantations owned by mixed-race Creek, believed by the Red Sticks to have left core Creek values. The assault on the fort became a massacre of most of the refugees within. The Red Sticks killed a total of nearly 500 Lower Creek and European-American settlers.\n\nTogether with numerous other Red Stick warriors, McQueen later faced Colonel Andrew Jackson, who commanded state militias from Tennessee, Georgia, and the Mississippi Territory, as well as allied Lower Creek and Cherokee warriors, at the Battle of Horseshoe Bend in 1814. Altogether in the Creek War nearly 3,000 Creek died, many of the Upper Towns were destroyed, and the Upper Creek lost much of their stores of food. The prophet's people had slaughtered livestock in the early days of the conflict; later one side and another had destroyed more livestock, as well as stored foods. As they had planted hardly any crops during 1813-1814, they suffered severely from shortages and want.\n\nDefeated by Jackson's forces, many surviving Red Stick warriors, including McQueen, retreated south into central Florida (see Angola, Florida).\n\n"}

After leaving school, she first worked as a bookseller in Potsdam, and then studied literature, psychology and American studies in Potsdam and New York. In New York she also worked as a lighting assistant in a theater. She has held residencies as a writer and been a guest professor at various institutions and universities in Germany, the United States, and Finland. She lives and works as a writer and translator in Potsdam, Germany.\n\nWith the publication of her first novel, \"Offene Blende\", Strubel added the name Rávik (previously Rávic) to her legal name to designate her writing identity. Since 2018, she spells this writing name Rávik.\n\nRávik Strubel is part of a generation of writers who were born in East Germany but started publishing after the fall of the Berlin Wall. Much of her fiction deals with identity and transformation in contemporary Europe. In 2001, she published her first two novels, \"Offene Blende\" and \"Unter Schnee\" (translated as \"Snowed Under\"). That year she also received the Ernst Willner Prize in Klagenfurt. Like many of her texts, both of her first novels have main characters born in East Germany, and both novels focus on these women as they travel abroad, explore identity through new jobs and relationships, and reinvent themselves in Europe or America after the fall of the Wall. These are also themes that we find in her later work.\n\nIn 2002, Rávik Strubel published her third novel, \"Fremd gehen\", and in 2003 she won the Roswitha Prize and the German Critics Prize. \n\nThe title of her 2004 novel \"Tupolew 134\" refers to a Tupolev plane and is based on historical event, the 1977 Aeroflot Tupolev Tu-134 hijacking. \"Tupolew 134\" met with enthusiastic reviews, and in 2005 won the new Marburger Literature Prize and the Bremen Literature Prize. This novel, like both the earlier \"Fremd gehen\" (2002) and the later \"Sturz der Tage in die Nacht\" (2011), examines memory and the repercussions of politics in East Germany prior to 1989. Her 2007 novel \"Kältere Schichten der Luft\" won the Hermann Hesse Prize and the Rheingau Literatur Preis in 2007. It was also shortlisted for the Leipzig Book Prize. In 2012 \"Sturz der Tage in die Nacht\" was nominated for the German Book Prize.\n\nNoting that \"Memory is always a story,\" Rávik Strubel uses literature to play with memory, identity, and ways of perceiving both oneself and others. In addition to tackling German history, Rávik Strubel's novels have been praised for their inclusion of gender and sexual diversity with butch and femme lesbians, homosexual, bisexual, genderqueer, and transgender characters. \"Snowed Under\" complicates gender identity by offering two main characters, a lesbian couple, who embody \"feminine masculinity,\" which, according to Claudia Breger, complicates notions of both gender and social belonging in conjunction with power positions linked to nationality in post-Wall Eastern Europe. \"Kältere Schichten der Luft\" features female-born main character named Anja, who develops a male alter ego named Schmoll, which some scholars have read as a transgender embodiment. \"In den Wäldern des menschlichen Herzens\", which was inspired in part by the theories of Jack Halberstam, introduces two transgender characters, one who has already transitioned when the story begins and the other who transitions over the course of the story.\n\nStrubel has translated fiction from English and Swedish into German. Her translations include books by American novelist Joan Didion and Australian novelist Favel Parrett, as well as short stories by the American writer Lucia Berlin. She has also translated the fiction of Swedish author Karolina Ramqvist. Strubel has also written numerous short stories and published articles, commentaries, and critical reviews in newspapers and literary journals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Pérez Alonso) in Las Palmas de Gran Canaria (Spain). After the split of previous bands like Luger and Vicious Soul, Stone recruited bassist Mariano Gracia and drummer Juan Manuel Cuadrado and recorded the first band demos \"Drunken Sailors' Ritual\" (1996) and \"The Chinese Sideburns\" (1997).\n\nIn 1998, guitarist Jorge Casañas and drummer José Llobet entered the band, and 1999 saw the release of the first album \"Acid Jokes\" on Ajo Records under the production of Jorge Casañas and Frogcircus. That year, the band appeared at a special feature show on United States-Television channel HBO to premiere the record, and also headlined the Campus Rock Festival together with Spanish rockers Dover, as well as appearances with Nada Surf, The Godfathers and Mick Taylor.\n\nRight after the incorporation of drummer Miguel Arencibia and bassist Miguel Ballesteros, the band moved to Berlin, where they signed with indie label Thorshammer and released the \"Zeitgeist EP\" (2002). The EP, produced by Thomas Neumann, brought the band to its first German tour together with singer-songwriter Bobo (who had previously worked with Rammstein on their hit single \"Engel\"). After the recording of the \"Zeitgeist EP\", the band again changed the Spanish musicians for local ones, and drummer Tyronne Silva and bassist Timo Günzel joined Stone, by now the only original founding member in the band.\n\nThe band worked as a trio on what would become their next album, recorded in Berlin and Gran Canaria, with Stone acting as producer this time under his real name. Shortly after, Tyronne Silva had to quit drumming for a longer period due to health reasons, and after some provisional drummers filling the spot, Tobi Fröhlich (previously in Limbic) joined the band in 2004.\n\nThe second LP \"Allergic\" was released on 1 March 2005 under Soja Music, together with the single \"Titanium\" and the video. The band wrote two new songs for the film \"Ludgers Fall\" by director Wolf Wolff and the theme song for Sebastian Pannek's \"The Assessment\". During August 2006, the band recorded what would be the third full album \"Not Completely Clean\", produced by Jürgen Block, released in July 2008 under BlackRock Records.\n\nThe fourth album, titled \"Ink\", was recorded between December 2009 and March 2010 in Berlin and will be released in December 2010 under BlackRock Records again. Production duties were taken by Antonio J. Pérez Alonso and Gonzalo Ramos.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2335435", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2335435", "title": "Locust Abortion Technician", "text": "Locust Abortion Technician\n\nLocust Abortion Technician is the third full-length studio album by American rock band Butthole Surfers, released in March 1987. All songs were written and produced by Butthole Surfers, except for \"Kuntz\", which was by Thai artists Phloen Phromdaen and Kong Katkamngae, who were originally uncredited for their work. The album was originally released as vinyl on Touch and Go, and was remastered to CD on Latino Buggerveil in 1999.\n\n\"Locust Abortion Technician\"'s front cover illustration of two clowns playing with a dog was painted by Arthur Sarnoff, entitled \"Fido and the Clowns\".\n\nKurt Cobain listed it in his top 50 albums of all time. It is also featured in Robert Dimery's \"1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die\". In 2018, Pitchfork included the album on their list of \"The 200 Best Albums of the 1980s\", writing: \"From the John Wayne Gacy-indebted cover art to the turbid sounds within, the group’s third LP took a chainsaw to hardcore, psychedelic rock, country blues, Black Sabbath, and, on closer “22 Going on 23,” the sound of mooing cows and the agonizing confession of a sexual assault victim. Butchering every notion of good taste in their path, the Butthole Surfers revelled in the most cartoonish and nightmarish aspects of reality without regret.\"\n\n\"Locust Abortion Technician\" is an experimental blend of punk rock, heavy metal, and psychedelic music. This fusion led the band to be associated with the emerging grunge and sludge metal sounds. It also employs elements of worldbeat rhythms, noise music, progressive guitar, and folk music, and has been described as art rock, noise rock and alternative metal. The song \"Sweat Loaf\" utilizes a warped riff parodying the verse riff from the Black Sabbath song \"Sweet Leaf\". Not all the tracks are guitar-oriented, though; the song \"Kuntz\" was created by processing an original Eastern recording by a Thai artist through Gibby Haynes' \"Gibbytronix\" system.\n\nThis album marked the debut of bass player Jeff Pinkus, as well as the return of co-drummer Teresa Nervosa, who had left the band in December 1985. It was also the first Surfers full-length album to feature lead singer Gibby Haynes' Gibbytronix vocal effects, which feature on the songs \"Sweat Loaf\" and \"Human Cannonball\" (though Gibbytronix were employed on \"Comb\" on the \"Cream Corn from the Socket of Davis\" EP a year earlier).\n\nThe Butthole Surfers regularly play songs from \"Locust Abortion Technician\" during their live concerts, including \"Sweat Loaf\", \"Graveyard\", \"Pittsburgh to Lebanon\", \"U.S.S.A.\", \"Kuntz\" and \"22 Going on 23\".\n\n\"Locust Abortion Technician\" was the first Butthole Surfers album primarily recorded at the band's home studio, which was originally assembled in a rental house they were sharing near Austin, Texas in 1986. A private studio did not mean an end to the sub-standard equipment that had plagued their previous recording sessions, though. In addition to having just one microphone, they also used an outdated 8-track tape recorder instead of the 16-track gear used on \"Rembrandt Pussyhorse\". However, guitarist Paul Leary believes that the inferior equipment forced the band to be more creative than they might otherwise have been.\n\nAdditionally, the new studio freed the band from having to worry about recording costs, allowing them to experiment even more than on previous releases. Jeff Pinkus has also said that the home studio gave them the luxury of taking extended breaks for drug use.\n\nMany of the album's tracks also underwent extensive in-studio development. Although doing this had become a Butthole Surfers tradition, \"Locust Abortion Technician\" was one of their last recordings done in such a manner; on subsequent releases the band would go into the studio with more fully formed songs. Pinkus has expressed the opinion that the earlier, more chaotic recording sessions resulted in much of the spontaneous creativity that had propelled the group's early albums.\n\nAll songs written and produced by Butthole Surfers, except where noted.\n\n\n\n"}

Corman and Edna V. Corman, both of Kansas. His father was a silica miner who died of lung disease brought on by his work. Young James was brought to California by his mother in 1933; he attended Belmont High School in Los Angeles and earned a Bachelor of Arts degree from UCLA and a law degree from the University of Southern California. A Methodist, he was married on June 22, 1946, to Virginia Little of Atlanta, Georgia. They had two children, Mary Ann and James C., Jr.\n\nHe was said to be \"extremely bright, intensely private and sometimes moody\" as well as \"a courtly man in a tumultuous time ... with old-fashioned graciousness.\" At age 68, he was described as a \"dapper in monogrammed shirts, leather suspenders and wing-tipped shoes.\"\n\nCorman died at age 80 on December 30, 2000, after suffering a stroke in a rehabilitation facility in Arlington, Virginia. He was survived by his fourth wife, Nancy Breetwor-Malone. They had two children, Adam and Brian. A funeral service was held in Arlington National Cemetery, and interment followed.\n\nCorman was a cadet officer at UCLA with the Reserve Officer Training Corps, and he was made a second lieutenant in the U.S. Marine Corps in June 1943.\n\nIn 1944, he told of the death of a Japanese soldier he witnessed in the Mariana Islands while his Marine unit was guarding a food supply. The Marines held their fire until the Japanese \"began pawing over the [food] in the darkness, and then opened fire.\" One Japanese \"fell wounded over a crate of salmon cans. His companions fled.\" Corman continued:\n\nSuddenly we heard the tap of a grenade. We ducked into our foxholes just before the explosion and were unhurt. In the morning we found the Jap had decapitated himself. In his wallet was a magazine clipping of a picture of Japanese-American soldiers fighting with United States forces in Italy.\n\n\"See also List of Los Angeles municipal election returns.\"\n\nIn 1957 Corman, supported by labor and Democratic votes, was elected to a four-year term represent Los Angeles City Council District 7, over Kay Bogendorfer, a Republican. In that year, this newly established San Fernando Valley district was bounded on the south by Riverside Drive on the east by Coldwater Canyon and Woodman avenues and on the west generally by Balboa Boulevard. It had been moved from Downtown Los Angeles after Councilman Don A. Allen was elected to the State Assembly. Corman did not finish his term, being elected to Congress in 1960.\n\n\"In with President Kennedy and out with President Carter,\" he would say after he left the United States Congress. He served in the House of Representatives from 1961 to 1981.\n\nCorman was ousted from Congress in 1980 in a very close election by Los Angeles School Board member Bobbi Fiedler.\n\nAfter his Congressional service, he opened a lobbying firm, Corman Law Offices, in Washington, D.C., with a partner, William Kirk. Their clients included MCA Inc., American Newspaper Publishers Association and National Structured Settlements Trade Association. The firm merged with Silverstein & Mullens in January 1990. Corman represented Texas Air Corporation president Frank Lorenzo in his contested takeover of Continental Airlines. He stopped representing the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare because of its \"high-pressure fund-raising methods and alarmist pronouncements.\"\n\nIn 1985 he was elected president of Americans United for Separation of Church and State.\n\nIn 2001, the Van Nuys Federal Building was named in his honor. He was portrayed by Stoney Westmoreland in the 2016 film All the Way. The James C. Corman papers are held at the Oviatt Library at California State University, Northridge.\n\n"}

To make melodies, one plays it high into the overtone series. One series of harmonics is achieved by overblowing with the end of the tube open and another is achieved with the end closed. This means that most overtone flutes produce only the notes present in the natural scale.\n\nOvertone flute tubes typically have a relatively long resonating chamber compared to their inner diameter or cross sectional area, which encourages the instrument to resonate in the higher harmonics. An overtone flute in the key of G, with an inner diameter of 1\", will require more effort to play higher harmonics than an overtone flute in the same key, with an inner diameter of 1/2\". For example, a ratio of 1 : 30 - Inner Diameter : Length allows for very high harmonics to be played with little effort.\n\n\n"}

He currently wrestles most notably for Evolve and the National Wrestling Alliance.\n\nHe is best known for his time in Impact Wrestling under the ring names Kingston and King. He is also well known for his work in Chikara, AAW Wrestling, Combat Zone Wrestling, Independent Wrestling Association Mid-South, Pro Wrestling Guerrilla, and Ring of Honor.\n\nMoore initially trained alongside BlackJack Marciano and Jigsaw under Kevin Knight at the Independent Wrestling Federation in Woodland Park, New Jersey (formerly West Paterson). After Moore was kicked out of the school, he became part of the second class of students to train at the Chikara Wrestle Factory, where he was taught by Mike Quackenbush and Chris Hero.\n\nMoore made his professional wrestling debut, under the ring name Eddie Kingston, on October 12, 2002, at Chikara's seventh event, where he and BlackJack Marciano, the team known collectively as the Wild Cards, defeated Melvin Snodgrass and Lester Crabtree in a tag team match. In 2003 Kingston and Marciano began feuding with Mister ZERO and UltraMantis, the team known collectively as Ultra/ZERO. The feud came to an end on July 5, when Ultra/ZERO defeated the Wild Cards in the semifinals of the 2003 Tag World Grand Prix, after which Kingston and Marciano moved on to feuding with Team F.I.S.T. (Icarus and Gran Akuma). The following year the Wildcards teamed up with Jigsaw to form the Toxic Trio, while Icarus and Akuma recruited the help of Mike Quackenbush. On May 22, 2004, the Toxic Trio faced Icarus, Akuma and Quackenbush in an Ultimate Jeopardy match, where Kingston's, Marciano's and Icarus' hair, Jigsaw's and Akuma's masks and Quackenbush's various championship belts were on the line. In the match Akuma forced Kingston to tap out and, as per stipulation of the match, both the Wild Cards were shaved bald, effectively ending the feud. On September 18, 2004, the Wild Cards won the IWA Mid-South Tag Team Championship and enjoyed reasonable success outside of Chikara, until a knee injury forced Marciano into retirement, thus disbanding the team.\n\nAfter taking a break from wrestling, Kingston returned to the ring in July 2005, turning \"tecnico\" and teaming with Sabian, Equinox and Quackenbush to take on The Kings of Wrestling (Chris Hero, Claudio Castagnoli, Gran Akuma and Arik Cannon). On August 13, Hero defeated Kingston in a singles match, that would lead the two into feuding with each other over at Combat Zone Wrestling, while in Chikara they were kept apart from each other following the match. For a majority of 2006, Kingston had a rivalry against Larry Sweeney. Kingston and Sweeney traded many verbal and physical exchanges for months, and the feud culminated with a No Disqualification Strap match between the two at Chikara's last show of the year. Kingston won this match and the overall feud.\n\nIn 2007, Kingston turned \"rudo\" (villainous) when he was pinned in an eight-man tag team match. Following the loss, Kingston attacked Hallowicked and attempted to remove his mask. The resulting feud lasted for over six months. During this time Kingston frequently forced his opponents to wear a replica of Hallowicked's mask. The feud ended when Kingston defeated Hallowicked in a Falls Count Anywhere match.\nKingston, along with fellow BLKOUT stable members Joker and Ruckus, went on to the finals of the 2008 King of Trios tournament, coming up short against the team of El Pantera, Incognito and Lince Dorado, when Kingston tapped out to Dorado's Chikara Special. After the tournament Kingston was not seen in Chikara for two months, but when he returned in May, he quickly targeted the man who had forced him to tap out at King of Trios, Lince Dorado. Kingston defeated Dorado in back-to-back singles matches on July 13 and August 10, but both times Dorado refused to stay down and begged for more. On September 7 Kingston and Dorado face each other in their third singles match, which ended when referee Bryce Remsburg disqualified Kingston due to \"excessive punishment\". However, once again Dorado refused to stay down and demanded the match to be restarted. After the restart, Kingston had himself disqualified by low blowing Dorado and then walked out, before declaring that he was done with Dorado, since he was making him mentally unstable with his actions.\n\nIn late 2008 Kingston would team up with Brodie Lee and Grizzly Redwood to form an alliance that would later be named \"The Roughnecks\". In early 2009 The Roughnecks defeated the Order of the Neo-Solar Temple (UltraMantis Black, Crossbones and Sami Callihan) to advance to the 2009 King of Trios, where they ended up being eliminated in the first round by Team Uppercut (Claudio Castagnoli, Bryan Danielson and Dave Taylor). Following the loss Kingston started a feud with Castagnoli, claiming that he had been embarrassed and disrepected. On May 24, 2009, at \"Aniversario Yang\" Kingston, who had claimed to being able to outwrestle Castagnoli, pinned him cleanly with an Oklahoma roll. After Castagnoli defeated Kingston via countout at the 2009 Young Lions Cup, the two of them were booked in a \"Respect Match\" at the season eight finale \"Three-Fisted Tales\", where the loser of the match had to show respect to the winner. Castagnoli won the match, but instead of showing respect, Kingston laid him out with a spinning back fist, after claiming that both him and his former tag team partner (Chris Hero) are shady and deserve respect from no one. At the end of the event Kingston's suspicions about Castagnoli were proven right as he turned \"rudo\" and formed the stable Bruderschaft des Kreuzes (BDK).\nOn January 31, 2010, at the season nine premiere Kingston, now a tecnico, replaced Lince Dorado, after he had turned on his \"tecnico\" teammates and joined BDK, and teamed up with Mike Quackenbush, Jigsaw and Equinox in an eight-man tag team match against Castagnoli, Ares, Tursas and Dorado. BDK won the match, when Castagnoli pinned Kingston after a low blow. After the match Kingston once again refused to show respect to Castagnoli and was therefore beaten down. On March 21 Kingston re-ignited his old feud with BDK's newest recruit Lince Dorado by facing him in a singles match. Dorado won by disqualification by taking his mask off behind the referees back and throwing it at Kingston, who was holding it when the ref turned around. This is an automatic disqualification as per lucha libre rules. After the match Kingston attacked Dorado, while also taking care of BDK members Pinkie Sanchez, Sara Del Rey and Tim Donst, who attempted to make the save, before he was stopped by Castagnoli, who once again demanded the respect he was owed from \"Three-Fisted Tales\". On May 23 Kingston was set to wrestle one of his idols, Tommy Dreamer, at Chikara's eighth anniversary show, but the match was ruined by an interference from Castagnoli and Ares. After Dreamer helped Kingston take care of BDK, the two made a challenge for a tag team match for Chikara's July 25 show in The Arena in Philadelphia. On July 25 at \"Chikarasaurus Rex: King of Show\" Kingston and Dreamer were defeated in a non-title tag team match by Ares and Castagnoli. On October 23 Kingston represented Chikara in the \"torneo cibernetico\" match, where the company's originals faced BDK. He eliminated Daizee Haze and Sara Del Rey from the match, before being stuck in a two-on-one disadvantage against BDK members Claudio Castagnoli and Tursas. Castagnoli was disqualified from the match, after low blowing Kingston, but Kingston managed to come back and pin Tursas to win the 2010 \"torneo cibernetico\". On March 13, 2011, in Brooklyn, New York, Castagnoli defeated Kingston, after hitting him with a chain, in a grudge match fifteen months in the making. The following September, Kingston made his first tour of Japan, with the Osaka Pro Wrestling promotion, which had a working relationship with Chikara. During the tour, Kingston teamed with the villainous Joker stable.\n\nFrom May to October 2011, Kingston took part in \"\", a tournament used to determine the first ever Chikara Grand Champion. Kingston ended up winning his block of the tournament with a record of four wins and one loss to set up a final match with the winner of the other block, Mike Quackenbush. On November 13 at Chikara's first internet pay-per-view, High Noon, Kingston defeated Quackenbush to become the first Chikara Grand Champion. On February 26, 2012, Kingston made his first defense of the Grand Championship, defeating Vin Gerard, with whom he had developed a rivalry during the \"12 Large: Summit\". On March 25, Kingston defeated Brodie Lee in his second title defense. Kingston made his third successful title defense on April 28, defeating Kevin Steen via disqualification in an interpromotional match between Chikara and Ring of Honor. Kingston followed up by making successful title defenses against Jigsaw on May 20 at Chikara's tenth anniversary event, Dasher Hatfield on June 24 and Sara Del Rey on July 28. On September 15, during the second night of the 2012 King of Trios, Kingston made his seventh successful title defense against Osaka Pro Wrestling representative Tadasuke. Afterwards, Kingston was attacked by Tim Donst. On November 18, Kingston led a team to take on Team Steen in the ninth annual \"torneo cibernetico\" match. After Kingston managed to eliminate Steen, he was himself pinned for the win by Tim Donst. On December 2, Kingston defeated Donst in the main event of Chikara's third internet pay-per-view, Under the Hood, to retain the Grand Championship for the eighth time. Kingston's ninth successful defense took place during Chikara's first weekend of 2013 on February 10, when he defeated Kevin Steen. Kingston was next scheduled to defend his title against Green Ant on March 9, but ended up no-showing the event. Kingston later revealed that he had gotten drunk the previous night, punched a mirror in his hotel room and injured a tendon in his hand. On April 6, Kingston defeated Hallowicked for his tenth successful defense of the Grand Championship. During the weekend of May 3 and 4, Kingston made two more successful title defenses against Green Ant and Mark Angelosetti. Kingston's thirteenth successful title defense took place on May 18 against Archibald Peck. Kingston's fourteenth defense on June 2 at ended in controversy, when, just as his challenger Icarus had locked him in a submission hold, the ring was attacked by a group named \"Condor Security\", ending the match in a no contest.\nAfter a one-year hiatus, Chikara returned on May 25, 2014, with You Only Live Twice, where Kingston lost the Grand Championship to Icarus, ending his two and a half year reign. Afterwards, Kingston turned \"rudo\" and joined the Flood stable in order to regain the Grand Championship. The alliance, however, was short-lived with Kingston turning on the Flood on September 21. This led to a rivalry between Kingston and Flood's second-in-command, Jimmy Jacobs, which culminated on December 6 at Tomorrow Never Dies, where Kingston defeated Jacobs in a grudge match.\n\nKingston joined Combat Zone Wrestling (CZW) and was almost immediately placed in the role of enforcer and mouthpiece in the BLKOUT faction. Kingston and fellow BLKOUT member Joker won the CZW World Tag Team Championship from the Kings of Wrestling (Chris Hero and Claudio Castagnoli) on February 11, 2006, at \"Seven Years Strong: Settling The Score.\" Seven months later on September 9, Kingston defeated Chris Hero to win the CZW World Heavyweight Championship after an extended feud. As a result of winning the CZW World Championship, BLKOUT vacated the tag team championship, and the Kings of Wrestling won them in a tournament, but were attacked by BLKOUT afterwards. After a successful world title defence against Justice Pain at \"Night of Infamy 5\", due to Hero interfering and accidentally hitting Pain, Kingston lost the title to Pain in a three-way elimination match, also involving Hero. Kingston was eliminated first, after suffering a legitimate broken ankle, after botching a backdrop.\n\nAt the following show, Hero challenged Kingston to a Loser Leaves Town match when he returned. In his return match at \"Redemption\" on March 10, 2007, Kingston defeated Hydra. On April 7, at \"Out With the Old, In With the New\", Kingston defeated Hero in a Loser Leaves Town match. Following the match, CZW owner John Zandig went to the ring and publicly fired Kingston for \"ongoing misconduct\". This was suspected by many to be an angle, but was later found out to have been legitimate. Kingston released a public interview on YouTube discussing the matter, but the footage was removed only hours later.\n\nKingston did not appear in CZW for nearly a year following this, but eventually made his return at \"New Years Resolutions\" on January 12, 2008, in the main event for the CZW World Heavyweight Championship. Kingston returned to Combat Zone Wrestling on February 14, 2009, at its \"10th Anniversary Show\", in a losing effort to CZW World Heavyweight Champion Drake Younger in a No Rope Barbed Wire Deathmatch. Kingston and Younger went on to defeat The Best Around (TJ Cannon and Bruce Maxwell) on April 10, 2010, to win the CZW World Tag Team Championship. After a successful title defense on June 12 against Cult Fiction (Brain Damage and Masada), Kingston threw his World Tag Team Championship belt down and once again quit CZW. Kingston's title reign officially ended on July 10, when CZW owner DJ Hyde stripped him and Younger of the title.\n\nOn November 11, 2007, Kingston debuted in Pro Wrestling Guerrilla (PWG) as Human Tornado's mystery tag team partner. It was revealed earlier on that Tornado's opponent, Chris Hero, had also picked Kingston as his partner, but Kingston had chosen to side with Tornado. Kingston and Tornado lost a Handicap match to Hero via a disqualification caused by Claudio Castagnoli. Post-match, the three men collectively attacked Hero and showed signs of the forming of a new stable.\nOn January 5, 2008, Tornado, Castagnoli and Kingston defeated the three-person unit of Hero, Necro Butcher and Hero's then-valet Candice LeRae in a No Disqualification match. The competing stables would have a variety of matches against each other throughout the year, with various members facing off one-on-one. As a team, Kingston and Castagnoli were also involved in a brief feud against The Dynasty (Joey Ryan and Scott Lost), which began when they interfered in a PWG World Tag Team Championship match between The Dynasty and challengers the Briscoe Brothers (Jay and Mark Briscoe) on May 7. A title match was booked between Castagnoli and Kingston and The Dynasty on two consecutive shows, both of which Kingston missed. Soon after missing the second event, Kingston's name was removed from the roster page.\n\nOn August 30, it was announced that Kingston would return for \"All Star Weekend VII\". On \"Night One\", he competed in a four-way match for the PWG World Championship; participants included Necro Butcher, former champion Low Ki, and defending champion Hero, who pinned Kingston to retain. Following the match, Kingston assaulted Hero, forcing PWG officials to pull them apart. On \"Night Two\", Kingston was defeated by Necro Butcher in a Necro Butcher Rules match.\n\nKingston has made on-and-off appearances for Independent Wrestling Association Mid-South since 2004. During that year, most of his activity involved tagging with Marciano as the Wild Cards. The duo won the IWA Mid-South Tag Team Championship once, and successfully defended them on numerous occasions. After Marciano's retirement, however, Kingston's Mid-South work mainly involved one-on-one matches, including a lengthy feud against Ian Rotten. He also rekindled his feud with Hero during the 2007 Ted Petty Invitational, and on the final night of the tournament, Kingston defeated Hero in a Last Man Standing match, which is considered the 2007 Match of the Year for the company.\n\nOn December 7, 2007, Kingston won a four-way elimination match against Hero, then-champion Quackenbush, and Chuck Taylor to win the IWA Mid-South Heavyweight Championship. On April 11, 2008, Kingston no-showed a scheduled event, resulting in IWA Mid-South owner Ian Rotten stripping him of the championship. Rotten told the crowd that Kingston was \"going through some personal problems\", but that he was welcome back to the promotion once he got his act together. Kingston participated in the 2008 Ted Petty Invitational tournament, defeating Necro Butcher in the first round on Night One, but losing to Sami Callihan in the quarter-finals.\n\nKingston made his first appearance in Ring of Honor at \"Death Before Dishonor IV\" on July 15, 2006, as the fifth member of Team CZW in the Cage of Death match, which Team CZW lost.\n\nKingston's next appearance was on March 14, 2008, when he showed up in the audience during a match between The Vulture Squad and Austin Aries and Bryan Danielson. During the match, Kingston harassed Ruckus, a member of The Vulture Squad in ROH and Kingston's stablemate in BLKOUT in other promotions, and claimed he'd be in Philadelphia on March 16, 2008 during ROH's Take No Prisoners pay-per-view. During the non-pay-per-view portion of the show, Kingston, Sabian and Robbie Morino of BLKOUT got into a brawl with Jigsaw and Julius Smokes of The Vulture Squad, while Ruckus tried to restrain both factions.\n\nIn June it was announced that BLKOUT was planning on disrupting ROH's pay-per-view taping, Respect is Earned II, on June 7. The Vulture Squad responded with Jigsaw challenging Kingston to face him in a match. Kingston appeared with BLKOUT, but failed to defeat Jigsaw, while Ruckus again tried to calm down both of his stables.\n\nKingston wrestled at the \"Ring of Honor Wrestling\" tapings on March 1, 2009, in Philadelphia, defeating Sami Callihan. Kingston then appeared on the March 18 ROH videowire, and soon after re-developed his feud with Chris Hero. On December 19, 2009, at Final Battle 2009, ROH's first live pay-per-view, Kingston defeated Hero in a \"Fight Without Honor\" match to win the feud.\n\nKingston returned to ROH on March 4, 2012, at the 10th Anniversary Show, where he represented Chikara as the Grand Champion and had a confrontation with Kevin Steen. This led to a Grand Championship match in Chikara, where Kingston defeated Steen via disqualification. Kingston returned to ROH at the June 29 tapings of \"Ring of Honor Wrestling\", saving Mike Mondo from Steen and Jimmy Jacobs. He then went on to unsuccessfully challenge Steen for the ROH World Championship on August 11 at Boiling Point.\n\nOn August 17, 2013, Kingston returned to ROH, forming a new tag team with Homicide. In their return match, the two defeated Marshall Law (Q.T. Marshall and R.D. Evans). Following the main event of the evening, Kingston and Homicide attacked new ROH World Tag Team Champions, reDRagon (Bobby Fish and Kyle O'Reilly), before announcing their intention of taking down \"corporate ROH\" and revealing their team name as \"Outlaw Inc.\". Kingston and Homicide, however, claimed that they had come to ROH to help Match Maker Nigel McGuinness and take out those they felt were bad for the promotion. As part of the gimmick, Kingston and Homicide wore suits and followed the Code of Honor. After defeating The American Wolves (Davey Richards and Eddie Edwards) on November 16, Outlaw Inc. were named the next challengers for the ROH World Tag Team Championship. Outlaw Inc. received their title shot on December 14 at Final Battle 2013, but were defeated by reDRagon. Post-match, Kingston and Homicide announced that they were no longer going to play by ROH's rules. Kingston's last few ROH appearances were in the spring of 2014. After Homicide and Eddie jumped Kevin Steen and Cliff Compton during their No DQ match a tag team match was announced. This tag match saw Outlaw inc. losing and they were never seen again.\n\nKingston is a regular in the New Jersey–based Jersey All Pro Wrestling (JAPW) organization. After winning a number one contenders match on February 24, Kingston defeated Bandido, Jr. on February 28 at JAPW's \"Jersey City Rumble\" to win the JAPW New Jersey State Championship. He would hold the title for little over two months before losing it to Archadia. On January 23, 2010, at JAPW's 12th Anniversary Show, Kingston had his biggest match to date in the promotion, unsuccessfully challenging Dan Maff for the JAPW Heavyweight Championship. Kingston returned to JAPW on April 14, 2012, when he and Homicide defeated Philly's Most Wanted (Blk Jeez and Joker) to win the vacant JAPW Tag Team Championship.\n\nKingston was revealed as a member of the masked gang Death Crew Council (DCC) on the November 10, 2016 episode of Impact. The DCC made their Impact Zone debut on the October 20 episode of \"Impact Wrestling\", when they attacked The Tribunal, following the latter's loss to TNA World Tag Team Champions, The Broken Hardys. The DCC continued their assault on TNA wrestlers, attacking Robbie E and Grado on the October 27 episode of \"Impact Wrestling\". On the November 3 episode of \"Impact Wrestling\", the DCC attacked the Tag Champions. As the faction was leaving, the Hardys challenged them to an immediate match and put their titles on the line; whether this was a handicap match or not and what its official result was have never been specified. The match devolved into a backstage fight during which Matt Hardy suffered amnesia after being knocked off a forklift by one of the DCC members. The DCC unmasked themselves on the following episode of \"Impact Wrestling\" after laying out TNA World Heavyweight Champion Eddie Edwards following his successful title defense against Eli Drake. On the November 17 episode of \"Impact Wrestling\", Kingston made his Impact in-ring debut teaming with Storm and Bram to defeat Edwards and Brother Nero in a No Disqualification 3-on-2 handicap match. On the December 1 episode of \"Impact Wrestling\", Kingston and Bram faced The Broken Hardys for the TNA Tag Team Championship, but were ultimately defeated. Bram and Kingston would face Decay in a losing effort, after James Storm attacked Abyss, resulting in a disqualification. At Genesis, the DCC were defeated by Decay and The Broken Hardys in a three-way tag team, thus not winning their TNA World Tag Team Championship. On the January 19 episode of Impact Wrestling, Bram and Kingston competed in the first ever Race for the Case, capturing the yellow briefcase when Kingston knocked it out of Jessie Godderz's hands and into Bram's, later learning they have the #2 call out spot for the February 2 Open Fight Night episode of Impact Wrestling. On the February 2 episode of Impact Wrestling, the DCC used their Race for the Case briefcase to call out and defeat Decay in a Fall Count Anywhere match. At the end of the show, they would attack Ethan Carter III after his match against Eli Drake, only to attack him and his bodyguard Tyrus after. On the February 9 episode of Impact Wrestling, the DCC defeated Eli Drake and Tyrus in a handicap match.\n\nOn the April 6 episode of Impact Wrestling, Kingston and Bram interrupted James Storm kicking him out of the DCC after Kingston spat in Storm’s face and Storm laid both guys out with superkicks. Kingston would return to Global Force Wrestling, which he was involved in a 20-man Gauntlet for the Gold match for the vacated Impact World Championship which he was unsuccessful. On October 4, 2017, Kingston announced his departure from Impact Wrestling.\n\nOn the May 24, 2018 episode of \"Impact\", Kingston, now renamed King, returned as a member of The Latin American Xchange (LAX). After the group leader Konnan was attacked, and Homicide and Diamante went missing in action, King assumed leadership of the faction and guided Ortiz and Santana back to being tag team champions. In June, Konnan and Diamante returned, both showing suspicion about King's involvement with the group. On the July 5 episode of \"Impact\" former LAX members Homicide and Hernandez returned and attacking LAX. The group later became known as \"The OGz\". At the Bound for Glory on October 14, The OGz lost to LAX in a Concrete Jungle Death match. After several weeks, King moved to alumni section.\n\nDuring 2011, Kingston worked for the newly founded Urban Wrestling Federation (UWF) promotion. On June 23, 2013, Kingston and Homicide were defeated by The Steiner Brothers (Rick and Scott) at House of Hardcore 2. At the following event on November 9, they were defeated by Devon and Matt Hardy.\n\nOn September 29, 2016, Kingston was part of a group of about 40 wrestlers invited to a WWE tryout at their Performance Center. Kingston lost to Bull Dempsey on January the 26, 2018 at House of Hardcore 37. On September 9, 2018 Kingston lost to Brody King at PCW Ultra's Vision Quest in Wilmington, CA.\n\nKingston debuted for the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) at their television tapings on September 30 for NWA Power. At the tapings he formed an alliance with Homicide, feuding with The Wild Cards and The Dawsons over the NWA World Tag Team Championship.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2335499", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2335499", "title": "Polesden Lacey", "text": "Polesden Lacey\n\nPolesden Lacey is an Edwardian house and estate, located on the North Downs at Great Bookham, near Dorking, Surrey, England. It is owned and run by the National Trust and is one of the Trust's most popular properties.\n\nThis Regency house was expanded from an earlier building, and extensively remodelled in 1906 by Margaret Greville, a well-known Edwardian hostess. Her collection of fine paintings, furniture, porcelain and silver is displayed in the reception rooms and galleries, as it was at the time of her celebrated house parties.\n\nThe estate includes a walled rose garden, lawns, ancient woodland and landscape walks.\n\nThe future George VI and Queen Elizabeth spent part of their honeymoon here in 1923.\n\nThe name 'Polesden' is thought to be Old English. The first house was built here by 1336. Anthony Rous bought the estate in 1630 and rebuilt the medieval house. Richard Brinsley Sheridan, the poet and playwright, bought the house in 1804.\n\nThe house at one time belonged to Sir Francis Geary, but his Polesden Lacey was demolished when Joseph Bonsor bought the estate and commissioned Thomas Cubitt to build an entirely new house in 1824, creating the core of the house seen today. Bonsor died in 1835, and the house passed to his son who, in 1853, sold the estate to Sir Walter Rockcliff Farquhar, who held it until his death in 1902. \n\nThe Polesden Lacey estate was purchased in 1902 by Sir Clinton Edward Dawkins, a career civil servant, who commissioned Ambrose Poynter, architect son of Sir Edward Poynter P.R.A., to significantly extend Cubitt's work to create the present house. Sir Clinton, however died shortly after its completion. The estate was then bought in 1906 by William McEwan for his daughter, the former Margaret Anderson, and her husband Captain the Honourable Ronald Greville.\nArchitects Charles Mewès and Arthur Davis, who were responsible for the Ritz Hotel in London, remodelled the house for the Grevilles. The couple filled the house with collections of fine furniture, porcelain, silver and art.\n\nRonald Greville died in 1908 only two years after they had moved to Polesden Lacey. He was aged 46. Margaret continued to entertain lavishly at the house. She also owned a home in London in which she held expensive parties. Over the next 30 years her reputation as an Edwardian society hostess became established.\n\nIn 1923 Margaret invited the Duke and Duchess of York to spend their honeymoon at Polesden Lacey and the royal couple subsequently spent two weeks there. Shortly before their arrival a London newspaper took photographs of the house and published a large feature article about the proposed honeymoon venue.\n\nPolesden Lacey was left to the National Trust by Mrs Greville in 1942 in memory of her father, the brewer William McEwan (she was his illegitimate daughter and sole heir). The bequest included approximately of land along with paintings and items of furniture, which she hoped would form the basis of a future art gallery. The house was first opened to the public by the Trust in August 1946.\n\nIn August 1960, a fire destroyed around half of the roof of the property. Several ground floor ceilings were damaged by water during attempts to extinguish the blaze, however the collection of art and furniture was rescued by estate workers. The cost of repairs, some £65,000, was covered by insurance and the house reopened to the public on 9 June 1962. \n\nIn 1995 the National Trust embarked on a programme of restoration and renovation. In 2008/9 the visitor facilities were fairly extensively re-furbished, with a new car park, cafe, shop and farm shop. It received 347,149 visitors in 2018, placing it in the Trust's top ten most-visited properties.\n\nSome areas of the house are not currently open to the public. This is because in 1942 it was thought that the bedrooms and servants' areas would not be of interest to visitors. The first floor of the mansion is used by the National Trust Regional Office for London and the South East. The old servants' areas (on the ground floor) are used by the Polesden Lacey staff as offices. In the future, it is hoped that more of the mansion will be open to the public. This began in March 2011 with the opening of Mrs Greville's private apartment which had been occupied by the House Manager. The house is open to the public all year round except for Christmas Eve and Christmas Day. On weekday mornings admission is via a short themed tour. By March 2016 the Regional staff were beginning to move out, allowing more rooms to be available for public viewing. \n\nThere are a number of walks around the Polesden Lacey estate, especially in the valley that the main house overlooks. The estate includes a Youth Hostel, Tanners Hatch.\n\nThe re-modelling of the facilities in 2008–2009 means that the cafe and shop (as well as the walks) can now be accessed without paying for admission.\n\nPolesden Lacey also has open-air performing facilities, which are used during the summer to host various musical and theatrical events. In 2009 there was the Polesden Lacey Festival.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2335512", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2335512", "title": "Southern California Rapid Transit District", "text": "Southern California Rapid Transit District\n\nThe Southern California Rapid Transit District (almost always referred to as \"RTD\" or rarely as \"SCRTD\") was a public transportation agency established in 1964 to serve the Los Angeles metropolitan area. It was the successor to the original Los Angeles Metropolitan Transit Authority (MTA). California State Senator Thomas M. Rees (D-Beverly Hills) sponsored the bill that created the RTD, which was meant to correct some deficiencies of the LAMTA, and took over all of the bus service operated by MTA on November 5, 1964. RTD was merged into the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority in 1993.\n\nRTD was created on August 18, 1964, to serve the urbanized Southern California region, including Los Angeles County, San Bernardino County, Orange County, and Riverside County. RTD replaced the major predecessor public agency, the Los Angeles Metropolitan Transit Authority, and took over eleven failing other bus companies and services in the Southern California region. RTD was placed in charge of creating a heavy rail public transportation system for Southern California, and for planning for bus improvements. In 1974, the El Monte Busway was opened, a bus-only lane (later converted to a high-occupancy vehicle lane). In 1973, RTD shed parts of its operations outside of Los Angeles County, (they were taken over by other agencies including what was then the new Orange County Transit District (now Orange County Transportation Authority) although it continued to operate inter-county service to Riverside and San Bernardino until the formation of LACMTA, and continues to operate a line (460 express) to Disneyland in Orange County and one route (161 local) that serves Thousand Oaks, California, in Ventura County.\n\nFrom 1967 until 1982, RTD operated a main downtown terminal in the basement of the Greyhound bus terminal at 6th and Los Angeles Streets. Greyhound used it until 1991, when they moved to their current terminal on 7th St. Because of the positioning of mirrors in the single entrance/exit ramp, buses entered the ramp and drove in on the left hand side of the ramp (standard American practice is to drive on the driver's right side of the road or on a ramp), where at the bottom, a display lamp would indicate which of the 15 berths the bus was to terminate at. The driver would then turn left and go around the bus berthing area, which was in the center of the terminal. This prevented buses from ever having a danger of collision as the buses would always travel through the terminal in a clockwise direction, whereas in standard American traffic, vehicles drive on the right and a traffic circle or \"roundabout\" has traffic moving counterclockwise.\n\nThe terminal also had a rule, indicated on all signs leading to the bus berths, that cash payments were not accepted on buses in the terminal; a person had to either have a monthly pass or purchase tickets on the ground floor (one floor above the bus area). Tickets were standard paper coupons with amounts of 10¢ to $1.00, and could be purchased at any time, not merely when one was taking a bus. Tickets were accepted on all RTD routes at all times, and could also be purchased at various locations around the region, although RTD buses accepted cash everywhere, except when departing from the downtown terminal.\n\nRTD eventually discontinued use of the Greyhound bus terminal in the late 1980s, and resumed having connections for buses on the various streets in the downtown area.\n\nA similar practice occurred in Long Beach for the small number of routes that left its downtown area. RTD operated a small office on Ocean Boulevard, required tickets to be purchased, either there or in advance, and prohibited acceptance of cash payment for buses leaving the stop in front of its Long Beach downtown terminal. When the City of Long Beach introduced the consolidated transit mall, RTD discontinued the use of its own terminal, and allowed persons to pay cash on buses leaving the downtown Long Beach Transit Mall.\n\nRTD was essentially the \"800 pound gorilla\" as far as public transportation in Southern California was concerned. In a 1983 video created by RTD, the District stated its operating service area was larger than that of the transit systems of Miami, Buffalo, Atlanta, Baltimore and Washington, D.C. combined.\n\nRTD operated all service in the city of Los Angeles, and operated some service to neighboring cities. Many of the local bus agencies operating in the county (all of them either owned by a municipality or operated on its behalf) either had a \"live and let live\" or an out-and-out hostile relationship with RTD. One of the more serious rivalries was between Long Beach Transit and RTD. RTD had wanted to take over all or part of the operation of Long Beach Transit. However, it was considered that RTD would probably stick to covering the major areas (\"cream skimming\") and might let service languish in the less profitable areas, as witness some of the problems that some of the poorer areas in Los Angeles (such as Watts) had had in getting reasonable bus service. As a result of the animosity, a kind of pettiness grew between the two agencies. One example of which is, of all the bus lines which operated in Los Angeles County: Long Beach, Norwalk, Cerritos, Torrance Transit, City of Santa Monica, Culver City Municipal Transit, Orange County Transit, and RTD, all of these agencies would allow any of the other's employees to deadhead free, if in uniform (or had identification issued by their agency), \"except\" that RTD and Long Beach would not allow each other's drivers to ride free on their buses.\n\nOne benefit that RTD offered, which no other bus line in the region offered, was the very generous practice that, in addition to RTD employees being allowed to ride free on RTD buses (and as noted above, every other bus transit operator \"except\" Long Beach), their spouse and all children under 18 were also given free passes.\n\nTwo features of transportation in Southern California were the local restriction and the Long Beach South of Willow prohibition.\n\nThe local restriction prohibited any private carrier such as Greyhound or Continental Trailways from selling one way or round-trip bus tickets between any two points within the same area that RTD operated. For example, Greyhound sold a ticket for transport between Long Beach and the Magic Mountain amusement park (now Six Flags Magic Mountain) in Valencia, and the customer could optionally purchase admission to the park on the same transport ticket. This required the customer to change buses in Downtown Los Angeles to the bus bound for Valencia, and vice versa on return, but Greyhound could not directly sell a ticket for travel between Long Beach and Los Angeles, \"unless\" the person was traveling outside RTD's service area.\n\nThe South of Willow prohibition occurred because of the dispute between RTD and Long Beach Transit, wherein only Long Beach Transit was permitted to pick up passengers within the City of Long Beach south of Willow Street for transport to any other place in the city that was also south of Willow. RTD (and all other transit agencies except Long Beach Transit) were prohibited from providing a pick up and drop off both south of Willow Street. Generally, any pickup anywhere in the city which was south of Willow either had to be for transportation north of Willow Street or outside of the city. Buses which traveled into the area south of Willow Street could only discharge passengers, and could not pick up any passengers until they resumed travel either north of Willow or outside of Long Beach, and such passengers could not exit the bus until north of Willow or outside the city. On Long Beach Boulevard, for example, RTD was not allowed to discharge any northbound passengers anywhere on Long Beach Boulevard south of Willow Street. Buses going southbound were to be \"discharge only\" south of Willow, and were to be \"embark only\" going northbound if south of Willow Street.\n\nOver the years, RTD made a number of strategic purchases and trades to extend service. The original bus line operating between Long Beach and Santa Monica was operated by Western Greyhound Lines from 1923 until it was acquired by RTD in 1974. RTD broke the line in half, kept the portion running from Long Beach to Los Angeles International Airport (LAX), then took the portion from Los Angeles International Airport to Santa Monica and sold or traded it to the City of Santa Monica Municipal Bus line in exchange for the right to run buses from Downtown Los Angeles into Santa Monica. As a result, persons traveling from Long Beach to Santa Monica would take an RTD bus from Long Beach to LAX, then transfer at the airport to a Santa Monica Municipal bus.\n\nAll of the transit agencies in the county issued local transfers (a transfer from one of their lines to another). Most issued the same transfer blank for every bus on their route, where they just issued a single transfer where the driver punched in the route number, possibly the direction of travel (to prevent people who were taking short trips from getting on a bus going back where they came from without paying for the return trip) and the month and day. Long Beach issued a specific transfer preprinted with the specific route number. But RTD issued a new transfer every day, so that the transfer would have \"Mon Nov. 27 1978\" preprinted on transfers issued on that day.\n\nAnother different practice involved the issuance of \"interagency transfers\" where a rider was switching between one bus line (bus company) and another, e.g. Torrance Transit to Orange County Transit. RTD issued one transfer, which was good locally on its own system for all of its bus routes and functioned as an interagency transfer for credit toward the fare on a different bus line. All other bus lines issued an \"interagency transfer\" different from their own local transfers. It was believed that the reason for this was that RTD actually printed the interagency transfers and sold them to all the other bus lines. In the early 1980s, Long Beach Transit would also break from this system, and would have ticket printers installed on every bus to issue both local (Long Beach Transit-based) and interagency transfers (drivers would, in case the printer failed, keep a book of Long Beach and standard interagency transfer for just such emergencies.)\n\nFor a six-month period during the middle 1970s, RTD, and possibly other transit agencies in the county, received a massive subsidy, cutting prices for bus trips from 60¢ to $1.25, depending on the route, to 25¢ on weekdays and Saturday, and 10¢ on Sunday, for all trips anywhere within Los Angeles County. Trips outside the county remained the regular price. During this period, all transit agencies in the county discontinued issuing transfers. When the subsidy ended, prices returned to the original amounts, and RTD resumed issuing transfers.\n\nBus routes in the county originally had various identifications. The route from Long Beach to Los Angeles, which operated most of the route as an express service along the freeway of former California State Route 7 (now Interstate 710), was known as the 36F (for \"Freeway Flyer\"). Other routes had various numbers that at times seemed somewhat random, as they were added to the system when RTD had absorbed earlier systems—for example, routes 107, 108, 109, and 110 were in the Pasadena area, as they had been originally part of Pasadena City Lines, while routes 106 and 111 were elsewhere in RTD's system. In the mid-1970s, RTD began to group their routes by region—for example, routes in the 400s (such as 423, 434, and 496) served primarily the San Gabriel Valley, while those in the 800s (801 or 829, for example) served the southern Los Angeles County area. In addition to renumbering, most of the routes were modified into a more logical grid system, following major thoroughfares and moving route termini to near other routes to allow for efficient transfers. In theory, most residences were no more than a quarter-mile away from any bus route.\n\nIn 1983, RTD would institute a new, massive renumbering system, while keeping the earlier grid pattern. The new numbering system is as follows:\n\n\nAs a result of the renumbering, the 36F became the 456. The local bus running from Long Beach to downtown Los Angeles became the 60. The bus from Long Beach to LAX changed from 66 to 232. The local route from Pasadena to Pomona, numbered in the 1970s as route 440, became route 187, while a parallel route (numbered 434) that went from City of Hope in Duarte west through Monrovia, Arcadia, Pasadena (to JPL), La Canada Flintridge, then to downtown Glendale, was renumbered 177.\n\nProbably due to the success RTD had in clarifying where its routes went by the renumbering, Long Beach Transit would also change its numbering system as well. Foothill Transit would also keep the line numbers that it inherited from RTD, and later from the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority.\n\nThe Los Angeles County Transportation Commission (LACTC) was formed in 1976 resulting from the requirement that all counties in the state form local transportation commissions. Its main objective was to be the guardian of all transportation funding, both transit and highway, for Los Angeles County. The creation of the LACTC required RTD to share some of its power. The governing structure of the LACTC was similar to that of the SCRTD, however, the city of Los Angeles had three of the eleven board members, compared to two on the SCRTD board). By law, the commission included the mayor of Los Angeles, a city council member appointed by the mayor, a private citizen appointed by the mayor, all five county supervisors, a member of the city council of Long Beach and two city council members from other municipalities, elected by the Los Angeles branch of the California League of Cities. Each of the members had an appointed alternate.\n\nIn 1980 voters passed Proposition A, a half-cent sales tax for a regional transit system. The measure succeeded after proposals in 1968 and 1974 had failed. The map that accompanied the initiative showed ten transit corridors with the Wilshire subway line the \"cornerstone\" of the system, according to former SCRTD planning director Gary Spivak. Los Angeles County Supervisor Kenneth Hahn was the author of the proposition, declaring, \"I'm going to put the trains back.\" The Los Angeles County Transportation Commission's first light rail line was on the old Long Beach Red Car route from Los Angeles to Long Beach, which passed through Hahn's district (this would become the Metro Blue Line).\n\nOn September 11, 1985, U.S. Representative Henry Waxman added an amendment to that year's Federal Transportation Budget removing all subway construction funds, citing safety concerns after an unrelated methane explosion in the Fairfax District. \nBy 1986, due in part to last minute lobbying by RTD president Nick Patsaouras, compromise was reached between Waxman and Representative Julian Dixon. The deal allowed funding to go through as long as it did not pass through the Wilshire corridor. With a Wilshire corridor alignment prohibited, the Metro Red Line was reprioritized and routed north up Vermont, the next highest projected ridership corridor, to Hollywood. Because of the change in alignment, a 1-mile (1.6 km) stub line on Wilshire between Vermont and Western persists until the Purple Line Extension is opened in 2023.\n\nOn October 27, 2005 an independent group of experts stated that there was no significant problem with methane explosion. Congressman Waxman then proposed legislation to lift the federal ban on subway construction in the Wilshire Corridor, which passed. By 2007, this lifting of the ban, along with several other factors such as traffic congestion, lessening racial prejudice, increasingly progressive and environmental attitudes, have rekindled interest in what has come to be known as the Metro Purple Line.\n\nHowever, a separate measure passed locally in Los Angeles has prohibited use of Metro's local sales tax revenue on \"new subway construction\". This has deterred Metro from building underground, although the Metro Gold Line Eastside Extension light rail has a 1.8-mile segment where it runs underground.\n\nIn the following years, several light-rail and subway lines were opened:\n\nRTD pioneered experimenting with alternate fuel buses in what the Transit Coalition derisively called \"the fuel of the month club.\" At the start of Metro's existence, there were buses running on ethanol, methanol, regular diesel, low-sulfur (clean) diesel, and CNG. Battery-operated buses and trolleybuses were proposed but never operated in regular service.\n\nThe successor agency to RTD is the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (\"LACMTA\"). LACMTA is the product of the merger of RTD and the Los Angeles County Transportation Commission (LACTC).\n\nRTD and LACTC officially merged on April 1, 1993. Initially, the agency retained the locations of the predecessor agencies in Downtown Los Angeles, but later moved to the 25-story Gateway Plaza Building adjacent to historic Union Station in 1995. In the wake of local media reports of expensive Italian marble used in its construction, the structure was derisively dubbed the Taj Mahal. Housed within the building is the Dorothy Gray Transportation Library, a comprehensive collection of transportation-related books, videos, and other materials, said to be one of the largest in the nation. The library is open to the public.\n"}

The island is 20 km off the coast of Kuwait City in the Persian Gulf. The name \"Failaka\" is thought to be derived from the ancient Greek \" - \" \"outpost\".\n\nIn 2000 B.C., Mesopotamians settled in Failaka at least a century before the Dilmun civilization. Traders from the Sumerian city of Ur occupied Failaka and ran a mercantile business. Failaka had many Mesopotamian-style buildings typical of those found in Iraq dating from around 2000 B.C.\n\nStarting in the 3rd millennium BC, Failaka belonged to the Dilmun civilization. During the Dilmun era (from ca. 3000 BC), Failaka was known as \"Agarum\", the land of Enzak, a great god in the Dilmun civilization according to Sumerian cuneiform texts found on the island. As part of Dilmun, Failaka became a hub for the civilization from the end of the 3rd to the middle of the 1st millennium BC. Failaka was settled following 2000 BC after a drop in sea level.\n\nAfter the Dilmun civilization, Failaka was inhabited by the Kassites of Mesopotamia, and was formally under the control of the Kassite dynasty of Babylon. Studies indicate traces of human settlement can be found on Failaka dating back to as early as the end of the 3rd millennium BC, and extending until the 20th century AD. Many of the artifacts found in Falaika are linked to Mesopotamian civilizations and seem to show that Failaka was gradually drawn toward the civilization based in Antioch.\n\nUnder Nebuchadnezzar II, Failaka was under Babylonian control. Cuneiform documents found in Failaka indicate the presence of Babylonians in the island's population. Babylonian Kings were present in Failaka during the Neo-Babylonian Empire period, Nabonidus had a governor in Failaka and Nebuchadnezzar II had a palace and temple in Falaika. Failaka also contained temples dedicated to the worship of Shamash, the Mesopotamian sun god in the Babylonian pantheon.\n\nAt some point following Alexander's initial advance through the region in 331 BC or in the period 324/3 BC when he returned to Mesopotamia, the ancient Greeks colonized the island, which they named Ikaros after the Greek island in the Aegean Sea and the mythical hero Icarus, apparently in the belief that the island had a similar shape of its Aegean counterpart. Some elements of Greek mythology were mixed with the local cults. \"Ikaros\" was also the name of a prominent city situated in Failaka. Remains of the settlement include a large Hellenistic fort and two Greek temples.\n\nIn 127 BC, the kingdom of Characene was established around the Bay of Kuwait near Failaka. Characene was centered in the region encompassing southern Mesopotamia, including Failaka island. A busy commercial station existed on Failaka island.\n\nA Christian Nestorian settlement flourished in Failaka from the 5th century until the 9th century. Excavations have revealed several farms, villages and two large churches dating from the 5th and 6th century. Archaeologists are currently excavating nearby sites to understand the extent of the settlements that flourished in the eighth and ninth centuries A.D. An old island tradition is that a community grew up around a Christian mystic and hermit. The small farms and villages were eventually abandoned. Remains of Byzantine era Nestorian churches were found at Al-Qusur in Failaka. Pottery at the site can be dated from as early as the first half of the 7th century through the 9th century.\nPrior to the Iraqi Invasion, the island had over two thousand residents and several schools. The village of Al-Zawr is situated near the middle of the northwest side of the island. It was the longest continuously inhabited location in Kuwait. During 1990 and 1991, the invading Iraqis depopulated the island, expelling all of its residents to the mainland. The Iraqi military mined the beaches and used the island's facilities and buildings for target practice. In 1991, the allied forces forced the Iraqi army forces occupying the island to surrender through bombing and psywar operations. The sewage system was destroyed and has yet to be fully repaired. Also, many old homes continue to sit empty and decaying; bullet holes can still be seen.\nAfter the war, Failaka was cleared of mines, but it remains under military use. Nevertheless, Failaka Island is becoming a popular holiday destination from Kuwait City. The ferry \"Ikarus\" takes passengers out to the island. Currently, the ferry terminal is located in Salmiya's Marina.\n\nFailaka Island is located in the northern part of the Persian Gulf. Springtime on Failaka Island is regarded as particularly special by Kuwaitis. Failaka has quite a different ecosystem to mainland Kuwait, and its budding flowers and changing temperatures are much appreciated. Although the island's infrastructure remains poor, Failaka is beginning to develop a local tourist industry; it provides fishing, boating, swimming, sailing and water sports.\n\nThe few remaining local residents are mostly those Failakawans who lived with their families on the island prior to the Iraqi Invasion of 1990. Most Failakawans have their own boats and some are involved in tourism, but many are reticent about letting tourism detract from the quiet island life. Some Failakawan families, although now living in mainland Kuwait, regularly go to the island on weekends.\n\nOn the mainland, in Kuwait City, there have been various schemes to build a bridge to the island and make it a vacation paradise, as has been done in Bahrain. A new hotel resort has encouraged many of the improvements.\nFailaka is the principal center of archaeology in Kuwait. Since the fieldwork conducted by the Danish team under the supervision of Geoffrey Bibby in the 1950s, archaeologists from France, the United States, Slovakia, Italy, Greece, and, more recently, from Poland and Georgia have worked there.\n\nHellenistic Failaka\n\n"}

Roybal\n\nEdward Ross Roybal (February 10, 1916 – October 24, 2005) was a member of the Los Angeles City Council for thirteen years and of the U.S. House of Representatives for thirty years.\n\nRoybal was born on February 10, 1916, into a Hispanic family that traced its roots in Albuquerque, New Mexico back hundreds of years, to the Roybals who settled the area before the founding of Santa Fe. In 1922, a railroad strike prevented his father from being able to work, and Roybal, age 6, was brought with his family to the East Los Angeles neighborhood of Boyle Heights, where he graduated from Roosevelt High School in 1934. After graduation, Roybal joined the Civilian Conservation Corps. After serving in the CCC, Roybal studied business at UCLA and law at Southwestern University.\n\nHe served a stint in the Army, where he worked as an accountant for an infantry unit.\n\nOn January 8, 2001, he was presented with the Presidential Citizens Medal by President Bill Clinton.\n\nRoybal died of respiratory failure complicated by pneumonia at the age of 89 on October 24, 2005, at Huntington Hospital in Pasadena. He was survived by his wife, Lucille, and children Lucille Roybal-Allard, Lillian Roybal-Rose and Edward Roybal Jr. A funeral service was held at the Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels, and burial was at Calvary Cemetery, East Los Angeles.\n\nIn 1942, Roybal began work as a public health educator with the California Tuberculosis Association. Upon returning home, he began work as director of health education for the Los Angeles County Tuberculosis and Health Association, a position he held until 1949. In 1949, Roybal teamed with local organizer Fred Ross and Anthony \"Tony\" P Rios from a group of people who had supported his earlier campaign to form the Community Service Organization (CSO), which tied together a variety of religious, political, and organized labor groups to fight local discrimination. The organization, which organized get-out-the-vote drives, did not explicitly endorse candidates, but Roybal's presence as president of the organization and the personal endorsements of many of its members helped form a groundswell of support that contributed to Roybal's victory. In 1960 Roybal helped organize the Mexican American Political Association (MAPA) and served as its first president from 1960 to 1962.\n\nAfter retiring from Congress, Roybal founded the Lucille and Edward R. Roybal Foundation, which awards scholarships to Latino students pursuing careers in the field of health. Edward R. Roybal lived the rest of his life in Pasadena, California as one of the deans of local and national politics, endorsing several candidates in elections throughout the region.\n\n\"See Los Angeles municipal election returns, 1947 and after.\n\nIn 1947 Roybal ran to fill the Los Angeles City Council District 9 seat held by Parley Parker Christensen. The district, which included Boyle Heights, Bunker Hill, Civic Center, Chinatown, Little Tokyo, and the Central Avenue corridor, was then 45% White, 34% Latino, 15% African American, and 6% \"other\" residents. Roybal placed third in a field of five. In 1949, though, he defeated Christensen in the runoff election, for a two-year term. He was reelected in every vote thereafter until leaving office in 1962 after 13 years, He was president pro tempore in his last term.\n\nRoybal was noted as \"often the spokesman for minority groups\" in the City Council and \"recognized leader of East Side minority groups.\" He was also seen as a \"consistent supporter\" of subsidized low-cost public housing.\n\nOther positions taken:\n\nCommunists, 1950. Roybal cast the sole negative vote against an ordinance that required \"Communists and other subversives\" to register with the police. He told the council he believed he was \"signing a political death warrant\" with his vote, adding that the law \"places every citizen and organization . . . at the mercy of any biased crackpot who may decide to report the matter to the Police Department as subversive.\"\n\nJuveniles, 1950. The council adopted a motion by Don A. Allen asking the Police Department what was being done to enforce curfew laws. Allen said it was his opinion that if policemen were \"equipped with a good old-fashioned hair brush, which could be applied to some of these kids,\" there might be a lessening of juvenile crime. But Roybal disagreed, noting that most of the \"hoodlums\" were over 21 and recommending closer cooperation by the police with agencies \"dealing with youth problems.\" \n\nRabies, 1953. He and his public health and welfare committee supported proposed legislation requiring all dogs to be vaccinated against rabies.\n\nDodgers, 1957. Roybal was opposed to the use of Chavez Ravine as a Major League Baseball stadium, claiming that \"Chavez Ravine is the worst place in the world for a baseball park.\" He favored Wrigley Field.\n\nEmployment, 1958. He voted in favor of establishing a Fair Employment Practices Commission for the city. The bid lost on a 7–7 tie vote.\n\nBunker Hill (reference to the battle that took place in the American revolution), 1959. Roybal threatened a filibuster when the council would not accede to a request he made for monthly reports on the fate of residents evicted from Bunker Hill to make room for a massive improvement project.\n\nApology, 1960. Before and during a City Council meeting, he demanded an apology from Police Chief William H. Parker for Parker's having condemned some Latino residents of East Los Angeles as \"not too far removed from the wild tribes of the inner mountains of Mexico. I don't think you can throw the genes out of the question when you discuss the behavior patterns of people.\" Parker made the statement at a hearing before the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights; he refused to apologize but said that the word \"wild\" was ill-advised.\n\nDuring his time in the City Council, Roybal, as a prominent young Democrat, received encouragement to run for higher office. In 1954, he ran for Lieutenant Governor, losing to Republican incumbent Harold J. Powers, who had been appointed to the position after Lieutenant Governor Goodwin Knight acceded to the governorship after Earl Warren was named Chief Justice of the United States, by 1,764,035 votes (44.66%) to 2,185,918 (55.34%).\n\nRunning in 1958 against Ernest E. Debs for a seat on the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors, Roybal lost a bitterly contested election in which he held a slim lead on election night, but lost after four recounts gave the election to Debs.\n\nDespite this, Roybal ran for Congress in 1962, winning election in the 25th District, an area that included his native Boyle Heights, the larger East Los Angeles area, Downtown, and parts of Hollywood. Beginning his term in 1963, he became the first Latino Congressperson from California since the 1879 election of Romualdo Pacheco.\n\nAs Congressman, Roybal was generally known for a low-key legislative style. In his first term, he served on the Interior and Insular Affairs Committee and the Post Office Committee. In his next term, he served on the Foreign Affairs Committee and on the Veteran's Affairs Committee.\n\nBeginning in 1971, he served on the House Appropriations Committee for more than two decades and authored a number of bills, many of which were not universally popular, which offered support for groups he saw as disenfranchised; many of his actions were on behalf of veterans, the elderly, and Mexican-Americans. In 1967 he wrote the first bill giving federal support to bilingual education, creating specialized language instruction for immigrant populations. As Chairman of the House Select Committee on Aging, he led a successful campaign to restore $15 million in funding the low-cost health programs for senior citizens and an expanded public housing program for seniors. In 1982 he worked to preserve the Meals on Wheels program and veterans' preferences in hiring. In the early 1980s, against the wishes of many of his own constituents, he argued for expanded funding for AIDS research.\n\nIn 1976 he became a founder of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus (CHC) and later co-founded the [(National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials)] (NALEO). In 1986, as chair of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, he led the unsuccessful opposition to the Simpson-Mazzoli Act.\n\nIn 1978, Roybal was involved in a vote-buying investigation known as the Koreagate scandal, in which he failed to properly report to the House Ethics Committee a gift of $1000 from a South Korean lobbyist, Tongsun Park. During the investigation by the Ethics Committee, Roybal mistakenly stated he had never met Park. Park later testified that he had met Roybal four years earlier, for less than two minutes, and that he hardly remembered the man. In addition, Roybal voted against every bill that would have benefitted Park, thus discrediting allegations of a vote buying scheme.\n\nRequests by Hispanic leaders, and testimony by Representatives Ronald Dellums and Phillip Burton as to the facts of the case, as well as many representatives who spoke against the Ethics Committee recommendation for censure, resulted in the potential censure being reduced to a reprimand (the same punishment given the other two Representatives involved). In a letter dated November 29, 1978, Thomas H. Henderson, Jr., Chief of the Public Integrity Section, stated that \"The House Committee found that this change of testimony and other facts testified to on April 25, 1978, concerning the incident was not intentionally untruthful as originally charged.\" Undeterred, Roybal ran for reelection the same year and won 70% of the vote.\n\nRoybal retired in 1993 after thirty years in office. That year, following redistricting, his daughter Lucille Roybal-Allard became the Representative for the 33rd District, which contained part of Roybal's district, while Xavier Becerra, with Roybal's endorsement, won election in 30th District, which included much of the remaining territory of Roybal's former 25th District.\n\nAt the time of his death, more buildings in Los Angeles were named after him than any other single person. Among the buildings named for Roybal are the Edward R. Roybal Federal Building, located in what had been his home district in California, and the main campus of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, Georgia. The University of Southern California is home to the Edward R. Roybal Institute on Aging.\n\nOn March 25, 2008, the Los Angeles Unified School District Board of Education voted to name Central Los Angeles High School #11 (formerly Belmont Learning Center) as Edward R. Roybal Learning Center. The school opened on September 3, 2008.\n\nEvery February, on or near Roybal's birthday, the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials (NALEO) hosts the Edward R. Roybal Legacy Gala in Washington, D.C., as a tribute to the contributions he made to the nation, to NALEO and to the NALEO Educational Fund, of which he was the Founder Emeritus.\n\nThe Metro Gold Line Edward R. Roybal Linea de Oro Eastside Extension opened in November 2009. It runs through East Los Angeles from Union Station to Atlantic.\n\nHe was awarded a posthumous Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Barack Obama on November 24, 2014.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2335545", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2335545", "title": "Friern Hospital", "text": "Friern Hospital\n\nFriern Hospital (formerly Colney Hatch Lunatic Asylum) was a psychiatric hospital in the parish of Friern Barnet close to a crossroads which had a hamlet known as Colney Hatch. In 1965, it became part of the London Borough of Barnet and in the early 21st century was converted to residential housing as Princess Park Manor and Friern Village. The hospital was built as the Second Middlesex County Asylum and was in operation from 1851 to 1993. After the County of London was created in 1889 it continued to serve much of Middlesex and of the newer county, London. During much of this time its smaller prototype Hanwell Asylum also operated.\n\nAt its height, Colney Hatch was home to 2,500 mental patients and had the longest corridor in Britain (It would take a visitor more than two hours to walk the wards). For much of the 20th century, its name was synonymous among Londoners with any mental institution.\n\nThe asylum with its surrounding fields, gardens and recreation grounds adjoined Friern Barnet Road and is shown on the Ordnance Survey map of 1868–1883, which labels the nascent settlement of New Southgate under a popular developers' name \"Colney Hatch Park\". Today that larger community is the core area of New Southgate in the London Borough of Enfield. The map shows the large asylum which resembled closely the new settlement in size. Friern Barnet is today used fairly interchangeably with New Southgate for the area west of the Great Northern Railway — a short path from the asylum led to the station built to serve it, New Southgate railway station which moved a short distance and remains. The station had five earlier names, the changes demonstrate a gradual erasure of the small place name \"Colney Hatch\" from the public psyche and in general public use. Colney Hatch was\nthe southern hamlet, centred on a crossroads, of the medieval parish of Friern Barnet which stretched north north-west and was half as wide as long. The very rural parish until the late 19th century had one other main population centre, equally a hamlet, Whetstone.\n\nThe building of Friern Hospital was commissioned by the Middlesex Court of Magistrates, as the Second Middlesex County Asylum. The site was the former Hollick Wood, Colney Hatch. The architect was Samuel Daukes, whose Italianate corridor-plan design was based on the advice of John Conolly, the superintendent of the First Middlesex County Asylum. The foundation stone was laid by the Prince Consort in 1849, and the building was completed in November 1850. The cost of building had been estimated at £150,000, but the final cost actually proved to be £300,000, making it the most expensive asylum ever built, at £240 per bed. The estate had its own water supply, a chapel, cemetery and a 75-acre farm estate. It also had a gasworks, brewery, and an aviary where canaries were bred.\nThe asylum was opened on 17 July 1851 by Prince Albert with William Charles Hood (1824–1870) being its first medical superintendent.\n\nIn 1857 extensions were built to bring the total number of inmates to 2,000. By this time, serious defects of construction had become apparent: in one ward the walls and rafters separated and the arched ceiling gave way while in another ward part of the ceiling collapsed. It was found that the roof was insufficient and that the foundations were insecure, necessitating reinforcement works in 1858.\n\nFurther extensions were added from 1875 to 1879, and by 1880 conditions for inmates had become very poor. In 1896, a temporary building of wood and corrugated iron was erected to house 320 chronic and infirm female patients in five dormitories, despite warnings from the Commissioners in Lunacy that this would pose a serious fire risk.\n\nIn 1889 control of the asylum was transferred to the newly formed London County Council.\n\nOn 27 January 1903, the temporary building erected in 1896 was destroyed by a fire which claimed 52 lives, all female. In its place, between 1908 and 1913 seven new permanent brick villas were built: four for the survivors of the fire, one for subnormal boys with epilepsy or disturbed behaviour and two for patients with tuberculosis or dysentery. In 1912 a disused carpenters' shop and stores by the railway siding were converted into additional accommodation for male patients and further extensions were made to staff accommodation in 1927, by which time staff included 9 full-time doctors, 494 nurses and 171 probationers.\n\nIn 1930, following the Mental Treatment Act, the asylum was renamed the Colney Hatch Mental Hospital. In 1937 a female nurses' home was built, the resulting transfer of staff allowing the accommodation of 89 female patients in the old nurses' block. In the same year the hospital was once again renamed, this time as Friern Mental Hospital.\n\nDuring the Second World War twelve wards were requisitioned for use by the Emergency Medical Service (EMS) to be run by St Bartholomew's Hospital. The wards were used to accommodate 900 civilian war casualties and the displaced mental patients were redistributed around other wards and to Bexley Hospital in Kent. In 1941 five villas were destroyed by bombs and thirty-six patients and four nurses were killed. By 1944 the hospital had 2,557 beds for mental patients and 746 EMS beds.\n\nIn 1948 the hospital became part of the newly formed National Health Service. In 1958 a new 145-bed admission unit, Halliwick Hospital, was built to the northwest of the main building. The 1959 Mental Health Act required that the word 'mental' be omitted from hospital names, and the hospital became known as Friern Hospital.\n\nIn 1963, a café was opened for patients and visitors. Patients were able to earn up to 16/- (80p) 'pocket money' per week to spend in the café and hospital shop by working on the wards, kitchen and laundry. Male patients could also be paid in tobacco for their work.\n\nBy 1965, Friern Hospital housed 899 male and 1,037 female patients and employed 116 male and 113 female nurses plus 43 male and 33 female student nurses. In July 1965 Lord Strabolgi, speaking in the House of Lords criticised the hospital for the number of patients who were there merely because they were old. A Committee of Enquiry held in 1966 found that the hospital accommodated 708 patients over the age of 60 years, of whom 253 (36%) were considered by clinicians not in need of psychiatric care. The report highlighted the lack of alternative accommodation for the elderly and the lack of social workers which in effect meant that there was nowhere else for elderly disturbed patients to be housed.\n\nIt was one of the hospitals investigated in 1967 as a result of the publication of Barbara Robb's book \"Sans Everything\". One of the allegations concerned lack of entertainment for middle-aged schizophrenic patients and of occupation for many of the elderly. The investigators concluded that \"They may appear to be bored and dejected: in fact they are often incapable of animation.\" The Committee rejected entirely the allegation that everything in Friern was arranged for the benefit of the staff, including the suggestion that \"the Physician Superintendent was seldom in the hospital for more than one or two hours a day\". The latter gave evidence, which was accepted, that he attended the hospital daily from 9 am to 5.30 pm except on Wednesday afternoons.\n\nThe hospital's internal broadcasting service started in 1971 after funds were raised by Minchenden Grammar School. Initially broadcasting to six wards from a studio in the patients' social club, the station expanded to cover most wards and departments within the hospital. Radio Friern moved to a new studio in premises originally occupied by the hospital dentist in 1975 increasing its broadcasting hours by the early 1980s to include programmes airing six days a week. The station continued to broadcast until the hospital's closure in 1993. Reference to the radio service in Barbara Taylor's book The Last Asylum is incorrect. Radio Friern was staffed by volunteers with day jobs away from the hospital, no patients were involved. Programmes would typically start at 5 pm weeknights as the first volunteers finished work. The weekend schedule started at 9 am. Staffed by no more than 25 people, Radio Friern was Friern Hospital's 'Big Little Station'.\n\nIn 1973 the number of patients had been reduced to 1,500, and by 1979 the hospital had only 1,023 beds.\nIn 1989 it was decided that the hospital should close and its patients reintegrated into the community where possible. Closure came in 1993, and the building and grounds were sold to Luke and Brian Comer's Comer Homes in 1995. The building was converted into luxury flats called Princess Park Manor. Residents of the development have included members of the boy band One Direction, pop stars and footballers.\n\nNotable residents included:\n\nThe asylum is alluded to in P.G. Wodehouse's novel \"The Code of the Woosters\". When Wodehouse's famous Jeeves and Wooster are discussing their latest predicament, Jeeves suggests that a character is eccentric, to which Wooster responds: \"Eccentric? She could step straight into Colney Hatch, and no questions asked.\"\n\nThe asylum is referenced (as a byword for madness) in chapter 8 of the children's novel The Magician's Nephew, part of the Chronicles of Narnia by C.S Lewis: when Jadis proclaims herself as an Empress and demands that residents of London bow to her, they jeeringly respond by saying in Cockney dialect, \"Three cheers for the Hempress of Colney 'atch!\".\n\nWill Self's 2012 novel \"Umbrella\" is largely set in the hospital. It also features in Margaret Drabble's \"The Pure Gold Baby\".\n\nLindsay Anderson's 1982 film \"Britannia Hospital\" used the hospital's buildings and entrance gates for exterior scenes.\n\n\n"}

It is loosely based on classified operations told to Bendis by an anonymous high-ranking officer in the United States Intelligence Community during Bendis' childhood.\n\nThe storyline involves a large-scale super-hero crossover featuring Marvel characters such as Spider-Man, Captain America, Wolverine, Daredevil, Luke Cage and Nick Fury fighting a wide array of super-villains who have received hi-tech armaments from a mysterious benefactor.\n\nThe first issue was published in April 2004, and though intended originally as a bimonthly publication, it faced long delays. It was completed with issue five's publication in December 2005.\n\nThe aftermath of the series was explored in stories in \"The Pulse\" and Bendis has gone on to use many of the same characters in his \"New Avengers\" titles. This event begins an eight-year-long series of cross-over events ending with \"Avengers vs. X-Men\".\n\nThe storyline in \"Secret War\" is unrelated to the original \"Secret Wars\" and \"Secret Wars II\" crossover limited series which Marvel published in the mid-1980s, although its title is clearly inspired by them. Those stories received their own spiritual successor in \"Beyond!\", published in 2006.\n\nBendis has noted that \"Secret War\" is connected to the \"Secret Invasion\" storyline, in which Skrulls have infiltrated several institutions of Earth.\n\nIn 2003, Nick Fury, Director of the international security force S.H.I.E.L.D., uncovers a secret plot by Latverian Prime Minister Lucia von Bardas to fund a group of B-List supervillains with advanced technology, presumably that of previous Latverian dictator Doctor Doom (who was trapped in Hell at the time), as a means of wreaking terror on American soil. Fury immediately takes his findings to the President of the United States but is denied the authorization requested to overthrow the post-Doom Latverian government due to its sponsorship by the U.S. Government. Fury is enraged at what he sees as the same pre-9/11 security complacency inviting disaster yet again.\nFury recruits Captain America, Spider-Man, Daredevil, Black Widow, Luke Cage, Wolverine, and superhuman S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Daisy Johnson in a private attempt to covertly overthrow Latveria.\n\nA year later, a mass reprisal is unleashed across New York City, leaving Luke Cage in a coma as Fury and a cadre of NYC heroes face off against a cyborg Von Bardas and her hi-tech army. The reprisal is revealed to be a trap for New York's superheroes when Von Bardas arms a high-tech bomb linked to the technology provided to her supervillain army.\n\nThe cyborg Von Bardas is destroyed by Daisy Johnson, the bomb is disarmed, and the supervillain army is defeated and arrested. Captain America immediately demands answers from Nick Fury about what happened. They are soon joined by the X-Men and Wolverine, who attacks Fury until Johnson informs him that the man before him is a Life Model Decoy, and that the real Fury already departed. Through the L.M.D., Fury reveals the invasion of Latveria and the fact that the heroes (with the exceptions of S.H.I.E.L.D. agents Black Widow and Daisy Johnson) were brainwashed afterward. Nick Fury then informs the heroes that this is the last time they will see him and that he hopes those involved in his plot will understand that what he did was necessary.\n\nHis replacement as Director of S.H.I.E.L.D., Maria Hill, discovers the particulars of the story through her interrogation of Agent Johnson in the present-day framing device of the story.\n\n\n\nIn addition to the main five-issue series, there were a few other comics that tied in with the storyline. \"Secret War: From the Files of Nick Fury\" was a handbook-style one-off publication that featured S.H.I.E.L.D. profiles of all the main characters, written by Mike Raicht. These profiles are presented with the five issues in the \"Secret War\" hardback and paperback collections, and include a list of heroes that Fury recommended be sent in if his stealth attack failed and a large-scale assault was required (Hawkeye, Spider-Woman, Punisher, Ms. Marvel, War Machine, the Hulk and the Sentry), and a list of heroes who Fury contemplated including in the original mission but rejected for various reasons (Cyclops relied on his team too much, Fury had doubts about Doc Samson's ability to come through in a crunch, the Falcon lacked the right kind of power, Iron Man would ask too many questions even without the issue of bringing in someone who relied that heavily on technology against the Tinkerer, the Thing was too visually distinctive, Kitty Pryde lacked the right mentality, and Fury couldn't trust Mystique or the Purple Man).\n\n\"The Pulse\" #6–9 featured an original storyline which runs parallel to and intersects with the main series (it was meant to last five issues but when the last two issues of the mini-series were delayed Bendis decided to remove some content from the tie-in in lieu of spoiling the main event). This storyline was collected separately in its own paperback (\"The Pulse Volume 2: Secret War\"). Bendis has also stated that part of the \"Secret Invasion\" storyline has its beginnings in the \"Secret War\" publications, as he had been planning that event for several years.\n\nThe video game \"\" begins its story with the events depicted in the \"Secret War\" story arc of the Marvel Universe. It starts from the attack on Castle Doom to Lucia Von Bardas defeat. From there the story follows the \"Civil War\" story arc. The Secret War costumes for Wolverine, Luke Cage and Daredevil appear as alternate costumes.\n\nSpider-Man's Secret War costume appears as an alternate costume in \"\" and \"Marvel's Spider-Man\"\n"}

All songs were written by Butthole Surfers, co-produced by Butthole Surfers and Ric Wallace, and mixed by Wallace. The album was recorded at January Sound Studio in Dallas.\n\nThe album was originally released on Touch and Go, and was reissued on Latino Buggerveil in 1999.\n\n\"Hairway to Steven\"'s title is a play on Led Zeppelin's popular song \"Stairway to Heaven\". Some of its tracks also make allusions to other famous musicians, such as Julio Iglesias.\n\nThe last full-length Butthole Surfers album of the 1980s marked a midway point in the band's career, straddling their psychedelic-noise roots and the more accessible recordings that would follow. Like Butthole Surfers' previous releases, \"Hairway to Steven\" uses nontraditional instrumentation, extensive tape editing, and sound modulation. Unlike its predecessors, which relied almost exclusively on a foundation of electric guitar, bass, and dual drummers, it makes equally heavy use of the acoustic guitar.\n\nThis was drummer Teresa Nervosa's final studio recording with Butthole Surfers.\n\nLive performances of all of the album's songs, with the exception of \"Julio Iglesias\", were included on 1989's \"Double Live\". \"Rocky\" and \"Fast\" continue to be regular features of their concerts.\n\nThis album used no actual song titles when originally released; each song was represented by an absurdist, often scatological cartoon printed on the vinyl record's label and in the CD's packaging. In the years since, fans have extrapolated the songs' actual names by cross-referencing this album with official and bootleg recordings of the Surfers' live performances, particularly 1989's \"Double Live\". Many online music services use these widely accepted titles (see \"Track listing\").\n\n\"Hairway to Steven\" was recorded at one studio in a relatively short period of time. According to bassist Jeff Pinkus, the band had been performing most of these songs for years before recording them for this album. Many of the band's previous releases had been piecemeal affairs, recorded over several months in numerous studios, and their songs underwent far more in-studio development.\n\nButthole Surfers opted to follow this album's blueprint on future recordings, entering the studio with more fully formed songs than they had in the past. Pinkus has expressed the opinion that these better-organized recording sessions stifled much of the spontaneous creativity that had propelled the group's previous albums.\n\nAll songs written and co-produced by Butthole Surfers. The following titles were extrapolated by matching the songs to those found on 1989's \"Double Live\", with the exception of \"Julio Iglesias,\" which is inferred from the song's oft-repeated mention of the singer's name.\n\n"}

The Eighth Doctor first met her in the novel \"The Eight Doctors\" by Terrance Dicks, and she went on to become one of his companions.\n\nSam is born on 15 April 1980, making her 16 years old when she first meets the Eighth Doctor in 1997. She attends Coal Hill School, the same school the First Doctor's granddaughter Susan attended in 1963. She is described as being thin and wiry, with blue eyes and close-cropped blonde hair. She is a clean-living person, not drinking or taking drugs, and a vegetarian. She is also a supporter of Greenpeace and gay rights. In \"The Eight Doctors\" the Doctor rescues her from drug dealers, after which she travels with him for many adventures. The novel \"Seeing I\" is deliberately ambiguous as to the possibility that Sam is bisexual.\n\n\"Alien Bodies\" by Lawrence Miles introduces the idea of \"Dark Sam\". It is revealed that Sam has two sets of biodata — the information that defines a person's personal history. One set, \"Blonde Sam\", is the one who travels with the Doctor. The other, \"Dark Sam\", never travelled with the Doctor and became a drug user.\n\nThe four novels \"Longest Day\" by Michael Collier, \"Legacy of the Daleks\" by John Peel, \"Dreamstone Moon\" by Paul Leonard and \"Seeing I\" by Jonathan Blum and Kate Orman form a story arc. Initially, Sam flees from the Doctor after she finds herself kissing him passionately when giving him CPR and the two became separated. Although the Doctor eventually tracks her down, he is arrested and imprisoned for espionage. After three years, Sam discovers the Doctor's imprisonment and helps him to escape, realising that her relationship with the Doctor will never be anything other than platonic.\n\nIn \"The Janus Conjunction\" by Trevor Baxendale, Sam dies when she becomes poisoned by radiation on the planet Janus Prime. The Doctor puts the TARDIS into a temporal orbit, devises a serum, then returns to a time before she dies and administers the serum. In \"The Taint\" by Michael Collier, Sam and the Doctor meet Fitz Kreiner. In the same story, Sam also survives having an alien leech implanted in her head by a robot called Azoth, who notes Sam's special DNA, due to the Blonde Sam/Dark Sam duality. The Dark Sam storyline reaches its conclusion in \"Unnatural History\" by Jonathan Blum and Kate Orman.\n\nWhen the Doctor, Sam and Fitz travel to San Francisco in the year 2002, they find a dimensional scar, a remnant of the events in the 1996 \"Doctor Who\" television movie\". When Sam is drawn into the rift, the Doctor seeks out Dark Sam, whom he finds living in a London bedsit. He brings her to San Francisco, but Dark Sam realises what the Doctor's plan is — if she were to fall into the rift, Blonde Sam can be restored.\n\nWhen the Doctor is trapped by an extradimensional entity, Griffin the Unnaturalist, Dark Sam saves him by sacrificing herself to the rift, restoring Blonde Sam. One of Griffin's specimens, a Faction Paradox agent, reveals that Blonde Sam was created when Dark Sam touched the Doctor's biodata in the rift, causing a paradox and thus playing into the Faction's hands. During this novel, Dark Sam also has sex with Fitz, even though Blonde Sam had shown no interest in him. Dark Sam also flirts with and kisses the Doctor, but without his interest.\n\nSam finally departs the TARDIS after the events of the two-novel story \"\" by Lawrence Miles, staying hidden in 1996 with the Doctor's former companion Sarah Jane Smith until her younger self first leaves with the Doctor. In a possible future glimpsed in \"Interference\", Sam lives to a ripe old age, although the Doctor is evasive about her destiny in the novel \"The Bodysnatchers\" by Mark Morris.\n\nEventually, Sam becomes a political activist is shot and killed in 2002 in the novel \"Sometime Never...\" by Justin Richards when a group called the Council of Eight eliminates the Doctor's previous companions from the timeline. Although the Council is defeated and several companions are restored to history, the Doctor finds what appears to be Sam's grave in a London churchyard in 2005 during the last Eighth Doctor Adventures novel, \"The Gallifrey Chronicles\" by Lance Parkin.\n\nHowever, the grave is bait for a trap for the Doctor, and the name on the grave is \"Samantha Lynn Jones\", a name used briefly by an alternative version of Dark Sam seen in \"Unnatural History\". Accordingly, the grave's authenticity, and Sam's ultimate fate, becomes open to question. Jonathan Blum theorised that perhaps the Council undid the event that turned Dark Sam into Blonde Sam and then arranged for Dark Sam to die instead. However, although referencing Blum's theory in another forum post , Parkin notes in his \"Doctor Who\" chronology book \"AHistory\" that, despite the reversing of several of the Council's actions, it is \"clear that Sam died in 2002 and 'stayed dead'.\"\n\nIn the Big Finish Productions audio play \"Minuet in Hell\" (2001), a litany of the Doctor's previous companions includes the name \"Sam\". At the time, fans believed that this was an intentional reference to Sam Jones and therefore placed the books and the audios in the same continuity. However, producer Gary Russell in the behind-the-scenes book \"Doctor Who - The New Audio Adventures\" later denied that \"Sam\" referred to Sam Jones.\n\nThe 2005 play \"Terror Firma\" introduces two previously unknown companions for the Eighth Doctor, a brother and sister pair named Samson and Gemma Griffin. This now provides the possibility that \"Sam\" was a reference to Samson, although the Doctor never calls Samson this to his face.\n\nThe description of an unnamed character that appears in the short story \"Repercussions\" by Gary Russell (in the Big Finish-published anthology \"\") resembles Sam. This character is a passenger on board an airship travelling through the time vortex that is carrying various people whom the Doctor had placed there to stop them from being a danger to the Web of Time. If that was Sam, it may indicate that, as far as the Big Finish continuity is concerned, she was written out of history.\n\n\n"}

Human β-glucuronidase is a type of glucuronidase (a member of glycosidase Family 2) that catalyzes hydrolysis of β-D-glucuronic acid residues from the non-reducing end of mucopolysaccharides (also referred to as glycosaminoglycans) such as heparan sulfate. Human β-glucuronidase is located in the lysosome. In the gut, brush border β-glucuronidase converts conjugated bilirubin to the unconjugated form for reabsorption. Beta-glucuronidase is also present in breast milk, which contributes to neonatal jaundice. The protein is encoded by the GUSB gene in humans and by the \"uidA\" gene in bacteria.\n\nHuman β-glucuronidase is synthesized as an 80 kDa monomer (653 amino acids) before proteolysis removes 18 amino acids from the C-terminal end to form a 78 kDa monomer.\nBeta-glucuronidase exists as a 332 kDa homotetramer. Beta-glucuronidase contains several notable structural formations, including a type of beta barrel known as a jelly roll barrel and a TIM barrel.\n\nHuman β-glucuronidase is homologous to the \"Escherichia coli\" enzyme β-galactosidase. This homologous relationship, along with the knowledge that glycosidases often perform hydrolysis catalyzed by two acidic residues, enabled the development of a mechanistic hypothesis. This hypothesis proposes that the two glutamic acid residues Glu540 and Glu451 are the nucleophilic and acidic residues, respectively, and that the tyrosine residue Tyr504 is also involved in catalysis. \nIn support of this hypothesis, experimental mutations in any of these three residues result in large decreases of enzymatic activity. Increased activity of an E451A mutant enzyme (where Glu451 is replaced with an alanine residue) after addition of azide is consistent with Glu451 as the acid/base residue. Using analysis of labeled β-glucuronidase peptides after hydrolysis of a substrate that enters a very stable intermediate stage, researchers have determined that Glu540 is the nucleophilic residue.\n\nThough the particular type of nucleophilic substitution employed by β-glucuronidase is unclear, evidence for the mechanisms of their homologues in the glycosidase family suggests that these reactions are qualitatively S2 reactions. The reactions proceed through a transition state with oxocarbenium ion characteristics. Initially, these mechanisms, because of this oxocarbenium characteristic of the transition state, were suggested to be S1 reactions proceeding through a discrete oxocarbenium ion intermediate. However, more recent evidence suggests that these oxocarbenium ion states have lifetimes of 10 femtoseconds - 0.1 nanoseconds (similar to that of a bond vibration period). These lifetimes are too short to assign to a reaction intermediate. From this evidence, it appears that these reactions, while having an S1 appearance due to the oxocarbenium ion characteristics of their transition states, must be qualitatively S2 reactions.\n\nThe specific activity of Tyr504 in the catalytic mechanism is unclear. Through comparison to the structural data of the homologous enzyme xylanase, it has been suggested that Tyr504 of β-glucuronidase might stabilize the leaving nucleophile (Glu540) or modulate its activity.\n\nIn addition to these residues, a conserved asparagine residue (Asn450) has been suggested to stabilize the substrate through the action of a hydrogen bond at the 2-hydroxyl group of the sugar substrate.\n\nDeficiencies in β-glucuronidase result in the autosomal recessive inherited metabolic disease known as Sly syndrome or Mucopolysaccharidosis VII. A deficiency in this enzyme results in the build-up of non-hydrolyzed mucopolysaccharides in the patient. This disease can be extremely debilitating for the patient or can result in hydrops fetalis prior to birth. In addition, mental retardation, short stature, coarse facial features, spinal abnormalities, and enlargement of liver and spleen are observed in surviving patients. This disease has been modeled in a strain of mice as well as a family of dogs. More recently researchers have discovered a feline family that exhibits deficiencies in β-glucuronidase activity. The source of this reduction of activity has been identified as an E351K mutation (Glu351 is mutated to a lysine residue). Glu351 is conserved in mammalian species, which suggests an important function for this residue. Examination of the human X-ray crystal structure suggests that this residue (Glu352 in the human enzyme), which is buried deep within the TIM barrel domain, may be important for stabilization of the tertiary structure of the enzyme. In the crystal structure, it appears that Arg216, a member of the jelly roll domain of the protein, forms a salt bridge with Glu352; therefore, Glu352 is likely involved in stabilizing the interaction between two different three-dimensional domains of the enzyme.\n\nIn molecular biology, β-glucuronidase is used as a reporter gene to monitor gene expression in mammalian and plant cells. Monitoring β-glucuronidase activity through the use of a GUS assay allows determination of the spatial and temporal expression of the gene in question.\n\n\n\n\n"}

He was a self-taught guitarist and banjo player who moved to Los Angeles when he was 19 to be a professional musician. He worked for Paramount and Universal Studios. He also owned an apartment building on San Marino Street in Los Angeles. Navarro was married to Rose Northy for 70 years, then married Seda Stevens.\n\nNavarro retired in 1977 and spent the last 28 years of his life overseeing his investments and enjoying \"dining at his favorite Westside steakhouses. . . . At 100-plus he was walking without a cane, driving his Cadillac and going to church every Sunday.\" He died in his sleep at the age of 101 on September 7, 2005, and was survived by his wife and a stepson, Armen Haig Stevens.\n\n\"See also Los Angeles municipal election returns, 1951 and after.\"\n\n1951<br>\nAt the beginning of 1951, four candidates had begun their campaigns for election to Los Angeles's 10th District seat on the City Council — the incumbent, G. Vernon Bennett, as well as Assemblyman Vernon Kilpatrick, 1332 Hope Street; Sam B. Whitworth, 2106 Wilmot Street; Charles Downs, 1607 Venice Blvd.; and Navarro, 2700 San Marino Street. Downs was a former City Council member who had lost his seat and went to prison in 1925 on a corruption charge. The district was \"in the south-central section of the city,\" bounded by Wilshire and Jefferson boulevards and La Brea Avenue and Main Street.\n\nThe \"Los Angeles Times,\" which favored Navarro's election, wrote of him:\n\nIn a district which has been a favorite haunt for left-wingers for some considerable time, Navarro comes right out and says he's downright against all kinds of bureaucracy, Socialism or any other kind of ism. . . . Although the Council job is supposedly nonpartisan, he's up against two old-line, left-wing Democrats, G. Vernon Bennett, the incumbent, and Assemblyman Vernon Kilpatrick, who's willing to ditch his State post for a city job if he can get it. Bennett, 16 years in the Council, is nearing 70 and during recent months was in trouble with the police. He appears to be on the way out.\n\nThe April primary was seen as a dirty one: \"Three of the candidates were accused of having police records, one of being an ex-convict. Another was linked with activities of the Communist Party.\" Navarro came in second, with 5,077 votes to 5,301 for Kilpatrick, 3,835 for Bennett, 2,250 for Hubbard and 1,423 for Downs. Bennett promptly sued for Navarro's disqualification on the grounds that he had not listed his birth name on the ballot. Navarro answered that he had dropped his last name, Guarino, \"because the first two were better suited to his work as a professional musician.\" A Superior Court judge dismissed Bennett's claim. Navarro won the May election, 9,001 votes to Kilpatrick's 7,321.\n\n1953<br>\nIn the 1953 election, Navarro had four opponents: \"John A. Somerville, Negro dentist and a member of the Municipal Police Commission; Courtland G. Mitchell, Negro real estate man; Charles Downs, contractor, and Ben F. Hayes, insurance investigator.\" Navarro won with 14,892 votes over Somerville, 8,316; Hayes, 2,781; Downs, 1,385, and Mitchell, 901.\n\n1955<br>\nThe 1955 election in the 10th District was the closest ever seen in Los Angeles, not being decided until a count of absentee ballots. The final returns were 11,336 for Navarro, the victor, 6,236 for African-American businessman George L. Thomas; 3,086 for African-American newspaper publisher Louis Lomax; 1,555 for automobile dealer Milton Mackaig; and 477 for pet shop proprietor Sam B. Whitworth.\n\nNavarro announced in December 1960 his determination to unseat 70-year-old Dan O. Hoye, who had been city controller for 24 years and who said that his ambition was to equal the 28-year record of his predecessor in office, John Myers. Navarro, chairman of the City Council's finance committee, was endorsed by the president of the Merchants and Manufacturers Association and the \"Los Angeles Times.\" Navarro won the election, 187,122 votes against 133,569 for Hoye, 67,318 for certified public accountant Harry C.

{"id": "2335596", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2335596", "title": "Front running", "text": "Front running\n\nFront running, also known as tailgating, is the prohibited practice of entering into an equity (stock) trade, option, futures contract, derivative, or security-based swap to capitalize on advance, nonpublic knowledge of a large (\"block\") pending transaction that will influence the price of the underlying security. In essence, it means the practice of engaging in a Personal Securities Transaction in advance of a transaction in the same security for a client's account. Front running is considered a form of market manipulation in many markets. Cases typically involve individual brokers or brokerage firms trading stock in and out of undisclosed, unmonitored accounts of relatives or confederates. Institutional and individual investors may also commit a front running violation when they are privy to inside information. A front running firm either buys for its own account before filling customer buy orders that drive up the price, or sells for its own account before filling customer sell orders that drive down the price. Front running is prohibited since the front-runner profits from nonpublic information, at the expense of its own customers, the block trade, or the public market.\n\nIn 2003, several hedge fund and mutual fund companies became embroiled in an illegal late trading scandal made public by a complaint against Bank of America brought by New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer. A resulting U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission investigation into allegations of front-running activity implicated Edward D. Jones & Co., Inc., Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Strong Mutual Funds, Putnam Investments, Invesco, and Prudential Securities.\n\nFollowing interviews in 2012 and 2013, the FBI said front running had resulted in profits of $50 million to $100 million for the bank.\nWall Street traders may have manipulated a key derivatives market by front running Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.\n\nThe terms originate from the era when stock market trades were executed via paper carried by hand between trading desks. The routine business of hand-carrying client orders between desks would normally proceed at a walking pace, but a broker could literally \"run in front\" of the walking traffic to reach the desk and execute his own personal account order immediately before a large client order. Likewise, a broker could \"tail behind\" the person carrying a large client order to be the first to execute immediately after. Such actions amount to a type of insider trading, since they involve non-public knowledge of upcoming trades, and the broker privately exploits this information by controlling the sequence of those trades to favor a personal position.\n\nFor example, suppose a broker receives a market order from a customer to buy a large block—say, 400,000 shares—of some stock, but before placing the order for the customer, the broker buys 20,000 shares of the same stock for his own account at $100 per share, then afterward places the customer's order for 400,000 shares, driving the price up to $102 per share and allowing the broker to immediately sell his shares for, say, $101.75, generating a significant profit of $35,000 in just a short time. This $35,000 is likely to be just a part of the additional cost to the customer's purchase caused by the broker's self-dealing.\n\nThis example uses unusually large numbers to get the point across. In practice, computer trading splits up large orders into many smaller ones, making front-running more difficult to detect. Moreover, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's 2001 change to pricing stock in pennies, rather than fractions of no less than 1/8 of a dollar, facilitated front running by reducing the extra amount that must be offered to step in front of other orders.\n\nBy front-running, the broker has put his or her own financial interest above the customer's interest and is thus committing fraud. In the United States, he or she might also be breaking laws on market manipulation or insider trading.\n\nFront-running may also occur in the context of insider trading, as when those close to the CEO of a firm act through short sales ahead of the announcement of a sale of stock by the CEO, which will in turn trigger a drop in the stock's price. Khan & Lu (2008: 1) define front running as \"trading by some parties in advance of large trades by other parties, in anticipation of profiting from the price movement that follows the large trade\". They find evidence consistent with front-running through short sales ahead of large stock sales by CEOs on the New York Stock Exchange.\n\nWhile front-running is illegal when a broker uses private information about a client's pending order, in principle it is not illegal if it is based on public information. In his book \"Trading & Exchanges\", Larry Harris outlines several other related types of trading. Though all these types of trading may not be strictly illegal, he terms them \"parasitic\".\n\nA third-party trader may find out the content of another broker's order and buy or sell in front of it in the same way that a self-dealing broker might. The third-party trader might find out about the trade directly from the broker or an employee of the brokerage firm in return for splitting the profits, in which case the front-running would be illegal. The trader might, however, only find out about the order by reading the broker's habits or tics, much in the same way that poker players can guess other players' cards. For very large market orders, simply exposing the order to the market, may cause traders to front-run as they seek to close out positions that may soon become unprofitable.\n\nLarge limit orders can be \"front-run\" by \"order matching\" or \"penny jumping\". For example, if a buy limit order for 100,000 shares for $1.00 is announced to the market, many traders may seek to buy for $1.01. If the market price increases after their purchases, they will get the full amount of the price increase. However, if the market price decreases, they will likely be able to sell to the limit order trader, for only a one cent loss. This type of trading is probably not illegal, and in any case, a law against it would be very difficult to enforce.\n\nOther types of traders who use generally similar strategies are labelled \"order anticipators.\" These include \"sentiment-oriented technical traders\", traders who buy during an asset bubble even though they know the asset is overpriced, and squeezers who drive up prices by threatening to corner the market. Squeezers would likely be guilty of market manipulation, but the other two types of order anticipators would not be violating any US law.\n\n\"Front running\" is sometimes used informally for a broker's tactics related to trading on proprietary information before its clients have been given the information.\n\nIn insurance sales, front running is a practice in which agents \"leak\" information (usually false) to consumers about a competitor insurance company that leads the consumer to believe that the company's products or services are inferior, or worthless. The agent subsequently obtains a sale at the consumer's expense, earns a commission, and the consumer may have given up a perfectly good product for an inferior one as the result of the subterfuge.\n\nFor example, analysts and brokers who buy shares in a company just before the brokerage firm is about to recommend the stock as a strong buy, are practising this type of \"front running\". Brokers have been convicted of securities laws violations in the United States for such behavior. In 1985, a writer for the Wall Street Journal, R. Foster Winans, tipped off brokers about the content of his column Heard on the Street, which based upon publicly available information would be written in such a way as to give either good or bad news about various stocks. The tipped off brokers traded on the information. Winans and the brokers were prosecuted by the prosecutor Rudolph Giuliani, tried and convicted of securities fraud. Their convictions were upheld by the United States Supreme Court in 1986.\n\n\n\n"}

It was opened to public in December 1999. The project of the Museum was initiated and executed by Zurab Tsereteli, president of the Russian Academy of Arts. In 2018, The merged into the Moscow Museum of Modern Arts.\n\nThe Moscow Museum of Modern Art is situated at 25 Petrovka St., near the Petrovsky Boulevard in central Moscow. It is housed in the former Gubin’s mansion, an imposing monument of the 18th century neoclassical movement, designed by the noted Russian architect Matvei Kazakov.\n\nIn December 2003, the Museum expanded its galleries to a second address — the exhibition hall at the Yermolayevsky Pereulok, Patriarshiye Ponds area, also a remarkable historic building of the Moscow city center. The spacious refurbished halls of the premises provide for vast exhibitions of multiple art projects. The exhibition hall has been inaugurated by the \"Artconstitution\" - a major show, in which nearly one hundred contemporary Russian artists took part. As a result of the ensued wave of public interest, numerous international exhibitions followed. One of them was a display sponsored by FotoFest (Houston, U.S.A.), featuring 260 photographic masterpieces by 24 artists from the United States as well as 12 other countries in Europe, Asia and Latin America.\n\nThe core of the Museum’s assemblage was constituted from the private collection of Zurab Tsereteli, its founder and director. Artworks of many renowned international artists are exhibited in the Museum's permanent collection halls like Marcus Jansen. The highlights include objects and sculpture by Armand, the “Sun Disk” by the famous Italian sculptor Arnaldo Pomodoro, the installation “CIS Ant Farm” by the Japanese conceptualist Yukinori Yanagi, as well as other works of contemporary art based on contemporary technologies. The masters of European and American art, such as Pablo Picasso, Fernand Léger, Salvador Dalí, Joan Miró and Rufino Tamayo, are represented by their lithographs.\n\nA special emphasis has been given to the collection of Russian avant-garde art. The museum spotlights works of world-famous artists of the turn of the 20th century: Kazimir Malevich, Alexandra Exter, Natalia Goncharova, Robert Falk, Ivan Pouni, Vladimir Baranov-Rossine and David Burlyuk (30 pieces). Visitors can also become acquainted with two compositions by Kandinsky’s friend Vladimir Izdebski, who is known for his “Salons de Paris” series after the revolution of 1917, and also a unique collection by the famous Georgian artist Niko Pirosmani.\n\nThe Museum displays the interesting exposition dedicated to the art of non-conformists of the 1950–70s, whose creative activity was in the opposition to the Soviet ideology. Among them are V. Nemukhin, E. Steinberg, V. Komar, A. Melamid, A. Ney, O. Rabin, A. Zverev, D. Krasnopevtsev, and more.\n\nContemporaries are represented by Boris Orlov, Dmitry Prigov, Francisco Infante, Oleg Kulik, A. Brodski, Aidan Salakhov, Lena Hades, Valery Koshlyakov, Igor Novikov and Serguei Shutov. They are mostly focused on forms of the so-called “actual” art.\n\nThe Moscow Museum of Modern Art contains works of art from the first decades of the 20th century; the exposition is based on contrasts and correlations of artistic trends and events in Russia and abroad, and is also aimed at showing the integrity of the development of world culture, while specifying the role of the Russian art in it.\n\nTo celebrate its 20th birthday, the institution invited 20 celebrities from all walks of life to curate its anniversary exhibition. The guest curators include Russian football star Fedor Smolov, designer Andrei Artemov, writer Vladimir Sorokin, TV showman and art collector Andrey Malakhov, theatre director Kirill Serebrennikov and even Marusya (Mail.ru’s voice-controlled personal assistant).\n\nToday the Museum is renowned not only for its collections and exhibits, but it is also known as a center of artistic education. The School of Modern Art (by the name of \"Free Studios\") works alongside the Museum, featuring a two-year program which is realized in concrete practice in creative studiowork. Included in the program are lectures on modern art, the study of contemporary visual art technologies, mastery of a broad spectrum of intellectual problems surrounding contemporary culture and familiarization with today's art market.\n\nThe research work of the Museum revolves around the Museum’s collection. There is a research library at the museum, with a vast collection of Russian and international art publications. The Museum’s laboratory is a nationally recognized center of conservation-related research.\n\nPublishing is one of the top priorities in MMOMA’s educational activities. Museum publications are richly illustrated art books and albums, catalogues of the museum collection and exhibition catalogues, with texts be prominent art historians, critics and curators, as well as artists. The Museum’s Dialogue of Arts magazine covers the history and theory of contemporary art, and contemporary art practice.\n\nNearest Metro: Gogolevskiy 10 Kropotkinskaya, Ermolaevskiy 17 Mayakovskaya, Petrovka 25, Tverskoy 9 Chekhovskaya, Pushkinskaya, Tverskaya\n\n"}

In 2006, Sloan served on the Executive Board of the United States Chess Federation. In 2006 Sloan was elected as an officer to the Manhattan Libertarian Party County Committee as Director of Media Relations.\nIn 1970, Sloan established a registered broker-dealer that traded over-the-counter stocks and bonds. Sloan had no formal legal training but orally argued a case before the Supreme Court after litigating against the Securities and Exchange Commission over policies regarding the trading of penny stocks. The Court ruled in his favor, 9–0. Sloan is the last non-lawyer to argue before the court.\nHe has run unsuccessfully or attempted to run for several other city, state and national government political offices, including for President of the United States.\n\nSloan was born in Richmond, Virginia in 1944 to attorney Leroy Bayfield Sloan, who was a Special agent in the Audit Division of the Internal Revenue Service and to child psychiatrist Dr. Marjorie Jacobson Sloan. His family later moved to Lynchburg, where he graduated from E.C. Glass High School. Sloan studied chess from an early age.\n\nSloan left Lynchburg in 1962 to study at University of California, Berkeley; he majored in mathematics and later switched to criminology, but he left Berkeley in 1967 and did not graduate. At Berkeley he became one of the leaders of the Anti-War movement and promoted a branch of the Sexual Freedom League. He held more than forty sexually liberal parties in Berkeley.\n\nAfter leaving Berkeley, Sloan worked two years for the Wall Street investment banking firm of Hayden, Stone & Co. in the over-the-counter trading department. In 1970, he established Samuel H. Sloan & Company, a registered broker-dealer primarily trading over-the-counter stocks and bonds. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) brought civil actions against Sloan & Co. during 1971–5 alleging he had failed to maintain adequate books and records. In 1975, the SEC revoked Sloan's broker-dealer registration. After years of litigation, Sloan prevailed in 1978 at the U.S. Supreme Court. Sloan argued the case \"SEC v. Samuel H. Sloan 436 U.S. 103\" (1978) \"pro se\". The opposing attorney was Harvey Pitt, who was later Chairman of the SEC from 2001 to 2003. Sloan won before the U.S. Supreme Court 9–0, concerning his claim that the \"tacking\" of 10-day summary suspension orders for an indefinite period was an abuse of the agency's authority and a deprivation of due process. Sloan is the last non-lawyer to argue before the court, which prohibited that practice in 2013.\n\nIn 1981, Sloan wrote a lexicon of Khowar, a language spoken in Chitral, Pakistan. Sloan had a minor role in a 1984 commercially produced film, \"Mahjong hōrōki\", that later became a video game, \"Mahjong Hōrōki Classic\". Since 1994, Sloan has operated Ishi Press.\n\nSloan is a chess journalist and author. He claims to have traveled to 78 countries, primarily attending chess tournaments. During a speech on April 29, 2006 at a Libertarian Party of New York's convention Sam Sloan has claimed to have \"won the World Championship of Chinese Chess in Beijing, China, in 1988\". He is rated an FM (Federation Master) by the World Xiangqi Association. Sloan has competed in tournaments in Makrook and shogi chess.\n\nIn July 2006, Sloan was elected to the Executive Board of the United States Chess Federation (USCF). He advocated a major expansion of scholastic chess, stating that the USCF should establish a program to certify school chess teachers. He criticized the USCF's recent move from New Windsor, New York to Crossville, Tennessee. As second-place finisher (out of five) in the special election, Sloan was elected to a one-year term on the board (the first-place finisher received a three-year term). Sloan's term of service began in August 2006. In 2007, Sloan ran for reelection to the USCF Executive Board, but was unsuccessful, finishing a distant ninth out of ten candidates. On October 2, 2007, Sloan filed suit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York seeking to overturn the results of the 2007 USCF election, and alleging that more than 2,000 obscene \"Fake Sam Sloan\" newsgroup postings prior to the election had been made by a rival candidate. On August 28, 2008, US District Judge Denny Chin dismissed the suit with prejudice pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1), 12(b)(2) and 12(b)(6). The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the dismissal but modified it, saying that it was \"without prejudice\" as the case had not gone to a hearing.\n\nOn April 3, 2008, posts appeared on USENET, apparently placed by Sloan, claiming that some of his websites had been closed down by law enforcement in Amherst County, Virginia, apparently because Sloan listed the home addresses of parties involved in his long-running but moot child custody dispute involving his daughter. The USENET posting mentions County investigator Christopher Smith. During that same time, Smith was conducting a broad campaign against Internet crime in the state.\n\nIn a 2011 book about Bobby Fischer, Frank Brady wrote \"Aided by an eidetic memory, [Sloan] was the last non-lawyer to argue a case before the United States Supreme Court – a case he won. Bobby trusted him.\"\n\nThree dialogues with Sloan are incorporated in the 2011 documentary \"Bobby Fischer Against the World\".\n\nSloan tied for the lead in the 3rd round of the 2011 World Championship of Chinese Chess (the total number of rounds or his final result was not stated).\n\nSloan won the 2011 Silver Medal in Senior Division (of two entries) at the World Memory Championship in Guangzhou, China.\n\nSloan competed in the World Championship of Chinese Chess in 2011 and 2013 and 2015 and 2017, held in Jakarta, and in Huizhou, China and in Munich, Germany and in Manila, Philippines respectively.\n\nIn an April 30, 2006, email to Michael Badnarik's 2004 presidential campaign mailing list, an individual claiming to be Sloan announced his intention to seek the Libertarian Party nomination for Governor of New York State. From 2002 to 2006, Sloan had been active in the Libertarian Party of New York attempting to influence its policy agenda and candidate nominations.\n\nLater in 2006, Sloan was elected as an officer to the Manhattan Libertarian Party County Committee as Director of Media Relations. He was not re-elected to that position in 2007. He was a delegate to the 2008 Libertarian National Convention and the 2010 Libertarian National Convention. On May 25, 2008 in Denver, Colorado, Sloan was nominated to the National Committee of the Libertarian Party and made a speech addressing the Libertarian National Convention.\n\nSloan made a bid for governor in the New York gubernatorial election, 2010, facing off against attorney Warren Redlich and former madam Kristin M. Davis. Sloan, by his own admission, was not popular within the Libertarian Party of New York and did not expect to win the nomination. He testified that a faction in the party who opposed Redlich's nomination needed another candidate. Sloan eventually lost the nomination to Redlich in a two-way battle, by a vote of 27 for Redlich and 17 for Sloan, after Davis refused to show up at the convention. Despite his failure to secure the nomination, Sloan was the first to submit petitions to the board of elections with the Libertarian Party line, which effectively gives him the nomination; the down-ballot selections on Sloan's petitions are identical to those confirmed by the party committee. However, because his petitions failed to contain the requisite 15,000 signatures, the nomination went to Redlich; it has been speculated that Sloan used the ploy to file a lawsuit against Redlich in his long-running dispute with the state Libertarian Party. Prior to the November elections, Roger Stone Davis's campaign manager, claims that Sloan fed him information that Stone passed on to a group entitled \"People for a Safer New York\", who created a flyer labeling Redlich a \"sexual predator\".\n\nIn January 2012, Sloan announced his candidacy for the Libertarian Party's 2012 presidential nomination. He lost the nomination to Gary Johnson.\n\nIn November 2013, Sloan was on the ballot for the New York City mayoral election, 2013, as an independent under the \"War Veterans\" line; he received 166 votes (0.02%, or 1/5,000 of the total vote).\n\nIn June 2014, Sloan ran for the Democratic nomination for New York's 15th congressional district, against incumbent José E. Serrano. He lost the primary election by 91% to 9%. Later that summer, Sloan attempted to submit petitions for the 2014 gubernatorial election, one for the Democratic primary (with Nenad Bach as the running mate) and another an \"ambush\" of the Libertarian Party line similar to the one he attempted in 2010 (with Tom Stevens as the running mate). Both petitions were ruled invalid.\n\nOn September 29, 2015, Sloan filed with the FEC to run for the Democratic Party presidential candidates, 2016. As a candidate for US President, Sloan attempted to run paid television ads on KCCI, the major TV station in Des Moines Iowa, and WMUR TV, the major TV station in Manchester, New Hampshire. Both of these TV stations are owned by Hearst Television. Sloan ran as an anti-war candidate opposing the US wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. Both TV stations refused to run the Sloan paid TV ads on the ground that Sloan had failed to meet his burden to substantiate bona fide candidacy for the Office of the President of the United States under the threshold established by the Communications Act of 1934 and regulations of the Federal Communications Commission. Sloan then sued in the United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire, in Concord, New Hampshire. Sloan also named as a defendant Debbie Wasserman Schultz for allowing only two Democratic Party (United States) Candidates, Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders into the Democratic Party TV Debates thus making it virtually impossible for any other Democratic Party candidate to run. Sloan alleged that Communications Act of 1934 and Title 47 of the Code of Federal Regulations 47 USC 315 requires federally licensed broadcasters to provide all candidates running for public office equal opportunity to utilize the broadcast station. Judge Paul J. Barbadoro, U.S. District Judge disagreed and found and the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit affirmed that there is no private right of action under this statute and therefore Sloan's case was dismissed. He was only on the New Hampshire ballot and received 15 votes. He lost to Hillary Clinton on July 26, 2016.\n\nIn 2016, Sloan ran in the Democratic primary for US Congress in the New York's 13th congressional district (upper Manhattan/lower Bronx area). The primary was held June 28, 2016 and he received 197 votes (0.46%), placing 8th in a field of 9 candidates and losing to Adriano Espaillat. Despite opening a campaign account for another run for governor in 2018 (which received no donations), Sloan did not submit any petitions for the 2018 gubernatorial election on any party line.\n\nSloan is running in the Democratic primary for the New York's 14th US congressional district, one of several challengers to incumbent first-term congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.\n\nIn the episode of Jeopardy that aired on March 12, 2020, under the category \"defending themselves\", the clue was \"The last non-lawyer to argue pro se at the Supreme Court was Samuel Sloan in 1978 \"Shame it's no longer allowed - Sam won by this count\". None of the contestants had the proper response, which was 9 to 0.\n\nSloan has been married three times and has nine children. Sloan's second wife, Honzagool, was a native of Chitral (Pakistan) and they had a daughter named Shamema. Sloan and Honzagool soon separated and Sloan left New York for Virginia with Shamema, leaving Shamema in the care of a Virginia couple, while Honzagool returned to Chitral. Sloan was subsequently locked into a child custody struggle, which lasted several years, with that Virginia couple over that same daughter. On September 5, 1991, during an attempt to regain custody of his daughter Shamema, Sloan was arrested. Sloan was convicted of attempted abduction of Shamema and spent 18 months in state prison.\n\nAs of February, 2020, Sloan's FIDE chess rankings were 1772 and 1880 for blitz.\n\n\n"}

Located at the intersection of 84th Drive, Main Street, Queens Boulevard, and the Van Wyck Expressway, in Briarwood, Queens, bordering Kew Gardens, it is served by the F train at all times, the E train at all times except rush hours and middays, and the <F> train during rush hours in the peak direction.\n\nThis station opened on April 24, 1937 as part of an extension of the Independent Subway System's Queens Boulevard Line. It has been renovated multiple times to accommodate the construction of and modifications to the Van Wyck Expressway.\n\nThe Queens Boulevard Line, one of the first subway lines built by the city-owned Independent Subway System (IND), opened on August 19, 1933. The line's eastern terminus had originally been at Roosevelt Avenue in Jackson Heights. A extension from Roosevelt Avenue to Kew Gardens opened on December 31, 1936. On April 24, 1937, the Queens Boulevard Line was further extended by four stops from its previous terminal at Kew Gardens to a new terminal station at 169th Street, with intermediate stops at Van Wyck, Sutphin, and Parsons Boulevards. \n\nBefore the IND Archer Avenue Line opened on December 11, 1988, all Queens Boulevard express trains (E and F trains) ran to 179th Street. The E ran express east of 71st Avenue during rush hours only, and the F ran local.\n\nThe station's exits were rebuilt as part of the $147 million Kew Gardens Interchange reconstruction project, which includes bridge replacement of the Queens Boulevard overpass over Van Wyck Expressway. The contract for reconstruction of the station's exit was bid on and won by Ecco and cost $9.9 million. In 2011, the north entrance was demolished as part of rebuilding the interchange, leaving the southern exit bordering Maple Grove Cemetery as the sole entrance and exit. A new entrance was built next to Archbishop Molloy High School on Main Street; another exit on the same site had been closed since 2010. Another new entrance currently exists on the south side of Queens Boulevard between the Van Wyck Expressway service and main roads.\n\nThe station renovation was started in 2010 and was to be completed by 2016, with a new elevator entrance and rebuilt, widened mezzanine corridors. However, delays abounded, including the fact that the new Main Street exit was delayed, having been pushed back from August 2012, to October 2013, and then again to March 2014; lead paint needed to be removed, costing $300,000; and plans were changed during construction, costing $1.7 million. The opening of the new Main Street exit was subsequently pushed forward to February 2014, then back again to May 2014 with elevator work to begin after the new entrance opened; the elevator was to be complete by late 2014 or early 2015. A new staircase entrance, on the northwest corner of Queens Boulevard and Main Street, was opened in December 2014. In May 2017, officials opened the new elevator entrance, which is next to the staircase entrance that opened in December 2014. The elevator runs only between the street and mezzanine with no additional elevators or ramps to the platforms, so it is not ADA-accessible.\n\nIn 2019, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority announced that this station would become ADA-accessible as part of the agency's 2020–2024 Capital Program.\n\nThis station has two side platforms and four tracks. The platforms have Slate Blue columns, a Jasmine Yellow tile trim with black borders, and name tablets containing \"VAN WYCK BLVD.\" in white lettering on a black border with matching yellow trimming. There are small tiles spelling out \"BRIARWOOD\" centered underneath each name plaque, with one letter to each tile, in the location where the directional exit plaques are placed in other IND stations.\n\nThe full-length mezzanine is directly above the platforms. It is separated into three sections with two black fences. Fare control is in the middle due to the requirement to have a pedestrian underpass under Queens Boulevard, so there is no free transfer between directions. The station is directly under the Van Wyck Expressway's southbound service road at this point, however.\n\nThe station mezzanine has hosted the NYPD Transit Bureau's District 20 station house since the mid-1990s.\n\nThe full-time exit is via a long passageway to Main Street and Queens Boulevard, where there is an escalator and elevator to the north side of Queens Boulevard. The elevator leads only from the mezzanine level. Another pair of exits exists at the southwestern corner of Queens Boulevard and the Van Wyck Expressway service road, one on the west side of the service road next to Maple Grove Cemetery, the other on the east side of the service road adjoining the Van Wyck Expressway.\n\nTo the west of this station are track connections from both pairs of express and local tracks, which lead to Jamaica Yard.\n\nJust to the compass south (railroad north) of this station, the IND Archer Avenue Line splits from the Queens Boulevard Line in a flying junction; trains to/from the Archer Avenue line can serve the station as local trains or bypass it as express trains. At the split, the Archer Avenue tracks split from both pairs of express and local Queens Boulevard tracks. The connection uses trackways that were constructed at the same time as the station, part of the section of the Queens Boulevard Line from Kew Gardens–Union Turnpike to 169th Street.\n\nThe provision (then known as the \"Van Wyck Stub\") was intended to be built as part of the IND Second System in the 1920s and 1930s. The original plans had a line diverging south of Briarwood, running down what is now the Van Wyck Expressway to Rockaway Boulevard near modern John F. Kennedy International Airport. The extension was never constructed due to lack of funding. The current Archer Avenue plans emerged in the 1960s under the city and Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA)'s Program for Action. It was conceived as an expansion of Queens Boulevard service to a \"Southeast Queens\" line along the right-of-way of the Long Island Rail Road Atlantic Branch towards Locust Manor; a two-track spur from the Queens Boulevard Line would use the original Van Wyck Boulevard bellmouths. However, the line was only completed to Jamaica Center–Parsons/Archer, and opened several years behind schedule in 1988. There are punch boxes on the Jamaica-bound track of this station to allow trains to go to either the Hillside Avenue or Archer Avenue lines.\n\nThe station's original name was Van Wyck Boulevard. Van Wyck Boulevard was the name of the wide thoroughfare that existed when the station opened. The Van Wyck Expressway was built over the boulevard in the early 1950s. The name was changed to Briarwood–Van Wyck Boulevard in 1998 to avoid confusion with Jamaica–Van Wyck on the IND Archer Avenue Line.\n\nSince 2008, community members had been pushing to rename the station again to simply \"Briarwood\" since it better reflected the neighborhood of Briarwood, served by the station, and since \"Van Wyck Boulevard\" does not characterize the area well (the now-expressway runs through several other neighborhoods in Queens). State Senator Tony Avella and local community groups pressed for the name change. The legislation, proposed in January 2013, passed the New York State Assembly on June 19, 2014. In August 2014, it was announced that the station would be renamed Briarwood. The station was formally renamed on April 17, 2015.\n\nIn the 1988 comedy film \"Coming to America\", Eddie Murphy's character, Akeem, tries to persuade his love interest to marry him and go to Zamunda, a fictional kingdom in Africa. He follows her onto the Briarwood station. When Akeem jumps the turnstile, \"Van Wyck Boulevard\" can be seen in the background above the token booth. They board the train which next stops at the Sutphin Boulevard station where she gets off. This scene, however, was actually shot at the unused platform and tracks of Hoyt–Schermerhorn Streets station in Brooklyn.\n\n"}

Vertical Tanks are fictional vehicles that range in height from 8m - 15m in height, with unknown tonnage. These vehicles are the platform of choice for future combat in the year 2084.\n\nThe campaign mode for \"Steel Battalion: Line of Contact\" was taken offline on September 30, 2005.\n\nGameplay is entirely online and consists of various game types (such as deathmatch, capture the flag, and others). Up to 10 players (five against five) can supposedly participate, and each player must have an Xbox, Xbox Live, and the special controller to play the game. However, at this time everywhere except Japan, most matches are limited to 3 vs. 3 with the some 4 vs. 4 and rare 5 vs. 5 combat. Players connecting with less than 100 kB/s up and 300 kB/s down are usually limited to 4 on 4 or 3 on 3 combat. There are a total of 10 new VT's introduced in this game, for a total of 31 different models, but it is worth mention that there is no single player mode available. After having their VT destroyed during an online match, the player must go through the entire start-up process again before re-spawning onto the battlefield.\n\nSteel Battalion: Line of Contact was for all intents and purposes an online-only expansion to the original Steel Battalion. Although the game also supports a System Link mode, the logistics of outfitting for LAN based play are quite daunting. Each player must have an Xbox, Steel Battalion controller, game disc and display. However, due to LAN support, the game can be played online through lan tunneling solutions such as XLink Kai.\n\nPrior to the closure of the Campaign servers, two modes of play existed for online combat; Campaign Mode and Free Mission mode.\n\nCampaign Mode was embodied in a persistent battlefield on which up to four factions would engage in mechanised combat to control landmass areas on the fictional south east Asian nation of Ocean City Island. The overall Campaign progress was divided into Rounds, each of which would last a total of eight weeks. Each week within a Round was termed a Turn, during which 3 Mission maps were available to select from as the battle arena. At the beginning of each Round, on Turn 1, players would be required to select a faction in which to participate. Initially there were only two factions to select from, the Hai Shi Dao and the Pacific Rim Forces. With the arrival of Turn 3, a 3rd independent faction would become available for pilots to transfer their allegiance to, the Right Brothers. Turn 5 would offer the option to transfer to the Jaralaccs Mercenary Forces. Turns would continue to progress over the eight-week period, after which the game would then return to Turn 1 and begin a new Round.\n\nEach Turn would dictate the Vertical Tanks available for purchase from the Supply Bin of each faction.\n\nHai Shi Dao (HSD) - in Steel Battalion: Line of Contact, the Hai Shi Dao are presented as a strongly patriotic nation who are actively resisting the occupying army of the Pacific Rim Forces.\nHSD 1st Gen VTs: Vitzh, Vortex, m-Vitzh, Scare Face, Scare Face A1\nHSD 2nd Gen VTs: Scare Face II, Maelstrom, Garpike, Behemoth\nHSD 3rd Gen VTs: Regal Dress N, Regal Dress A, Juggernaut\n\nPacific Rim Forces (PRF) - unlike in the original Steel Battalion, the sequel casts the Pacific Rim Forces in a much darker light, having them play the part of invading oppressors against the Hai Shi Dao nationalists.\nPRF 1st Gen VTs: Decider, Falchion, Decider Volcanic\nPRF 2nd Gen VTs: Prominence M1, Prominence M2, Prominence M3, Blade, Rapier\nPRF 3rd Gen VTs: Quasar\n\nRight Brothers (RB) - only available after Turn 3 of each Round, the Right Brothers are fierce individualist freedom fighters, adept at using guerilla tactics and specialised Vertical Tank equipment to defend the native lands of their ancestors.\nRB 1st Gen VTs: Colt, Colt Executive\nRB 2nd Gen VTs: Yellow Jacket, Sheepdog, Siegeszug\nRB 3rd Gen VTs: Earthshaker\n\nJaralaccs Mercenary Forces (JAR) - the only \"faction\" that does not fight for its own land, the Jaralaccs Mercenaries were able to participate on behalf of any faction within the context of an individual mission and individual pilots could switch their loyalties from mission-to-mission. They First enter the conflict in turn 5 of the round. The Vertical Tanks of the Jaralaccs were much more durable and suited to individualistic fighting tactics, but also more expensive.\nJAR 1st Gen VTs: Vitzh, m-Vitzh\nJAR 2nd Gen VTs: Jaralacss N, Jaralaccs C, Jaralaccs NS-R, Jaralaccs Macabre**\n\nVertical Tanks are classed across a number of different performance specifications, with the most generalised being Generation. 1st Generation VT's are generally slower and less unresponsive, have lower armour ratings, firepower or range. These units are generally very cheap in comparison to the later generations and are easily disposable in the battle field. 2nd Generation VT's have increased armour, speed and performance capabilities. 3rd Generation VTs are the epitome of VT design and performance, but also very expensive to field. The loss of 3rd generation machines within a battle would often result in defeat, however fielding a 3rd generation VT afforded a team an advantage.\n\nBeyond the Generation classification, VTs are further broken down by role type, which included Standard Combat, Support (artillery), Assault (frontline combat), Scout (reconnaissance) and Light (typically fast hit-and-run assault VTs).\n\nPlayers participate in missions, the result of which determines the number of Supply and Command points they are awarded. Supply points are used to purchase additional Vertical Tanks from the Supply Bin of a pilots respective faction. Command points are accrued and determine the rank of the pilot profile.\n\nThe Supply Bin for each faction could contain both \"mass-produced\" and \"limited-edition\" Vertical Tanks. The mass-produced variety were in continuous availability, whereas the limited types could only be purchased if units were available. Typically the more powerful and expensive VTs were classed as limited. Each VT had a serial number which marked it as unique, thus allowing players to \"own\" specific VTs within the game world. Unfortunately, due to a flawed resource management design in the programming of the Campaign server, there were no facilities for reallocating limited VTs back into the active pilot community. As a result of both normal player attrition and a rampant use of 2 month Xbox Live trial cards, innumerable limited class VTs were forever locked up against pilot profiles for Xbox Live players who no longer actively played the game. This resulted in a massive shortage of limited VTs as the gameworld progressed.\n\nPlayers would purchase VTs from the Supply Bin to use in missions. When these VTs were not actively being fielded they would be stored in a virtual hangar space for each player, which was retained on the Campaign server. Each VT would have both a Sortie Point and Supply Point value, the latter being the value required in order to purchase the VT from the Supply Bin. The Sortie Point value was a \"weight\" that the vehicle would debit from a team if destroyed in a battle. This value was also used to limit the number of VTs a single player could own, with a maximum of 600 Sortie Points in available hangar space being allocated to each player profile.\n\nIn the Campaign Mode players had to purchase multiple copies of the same type of VT to remain in the conflict.\n\nOn September 30, 2005 Capcom ended the Campaign portion of LoC. Free Mission mode was still supported and continued to be popular with LoC players up until April 15, 2010 when support for the original version of Xbox live was dropped, however the LAN portion of the game, which is similar to Free Mission mode, is still played online using XLink Kai.\n\nFree Mission mode relied only on the Xbox Live matchmaking services for players to host sessions, thus no external servers were required. Unlike Campaign Mode, Free Mission did not have a complex economy or persistent online conflict, instead players hosted individual battle sessions using both the original campaign \"Conquest\" mode of play, as well as \"Battle Royale\" and \"Capture the Container\". The LAN portion of the game works in a similar fashion to the Xbox Live Free Mission mode.\n\nConquest mode follows much the same formula as Campaign did, with players participating in a single battle on opposing factional sides which are chosen by the host of the session.\n\nCapture the Container is very similar to traditional Capture the Flag type play modes from other online multiplayer games, but instead of a flag, each team attempts to steal a container from their enemies base and return it to their own to score points. Bases may be captured, as in Conquest mode, and the flag may be returned to any base their team owns. VT combat is still in play, but does not directly affect the outcome of the mission other than to eventually remove opposing players from the battle by eliminating their remaining vehicles.\n\nBattle Royale is considered a training mode, in which all Vertical Tanks appear on the overall map radar view. Additionally the game mode is \"every player for themselves\" in a last player standing fashion.\n\nThe game received \"average\" reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. In Japan, \"Famitsu\" gave it a score of one eight, two sevens, and one eight for a total of 30 out of 40.\n\n"}

Meyer, USNR, in command.\n\n\"LST‑914\" first engaged in combat duty with the invasion of southern France 15 August 1944. She carried US Army troops and equipment from Naples, Italy, and unloaded them on the beach near Cape Lardier. Shortly afterward the LST joined Training Group Command, Atlantic Fleet, and operated along the east and gulf coasts until early in 1945. On 10 February 1945, she departed Gulfport, Mississippi, for the Canal Zone en route to duty with the Pacific Fleet. Steaming via Pearl Harbor and Eniwetok, she arrived Saipan 25 April.

While Thankmar was killed by his own henchmen in 938, Henry, in custody, chose to join the insurgents. In alliance with Duke Eberhard and Duke Gilbert of Lorraine he attempted a revolt against his elder brother King Otto in 938, believing he had a claim on the throne as firstborn son after King Henry's coronation in 919.\n\nIn 939 Henry's forces were defeated at Birten (near Xanten) and he himself was wounded. Both his allies Duke Eberhard and Duke Gilbert were killed at the Battle of Andernach on 2 October. Henry fled, first to his sister Gerberga, widow of Duke Gilbert of Lorraine, later to the court of King Louis IV of France. When Otto's troops invaded Lorraine (Lotharingia) and marched against France, Henry returned and submitted to his elder brother. He and Otto were reconciled in 940, and Henry was awarded the Lotharingian duchy. However, he could not assert his authority in Lorraine against the local nobility tending to France, and as a result he was stripped of his position when the king appointed Count Otto of Verdun duke. Embittered Henry again plotted to assassinate King Otto in Easter 941 at the Imperial palace of Quedlinburg, but was discovered and put in captivity in Ingelheim, being released after doing penance at Christmas of that year.\n\nOver the years, the relationship between the brothers improved. After the death of the Luitpolding duke Berthold of Bavaria, Otto, at the instigation of his mother Matilda, enfeoffed Henry with the Duchy of Bavaria in 948. Henry had ties to Bavaria through his marriage with Judith, a daughter of late Duke Arnulf. Though he met with resistance by local nobles, he first defended, and then enlarged his duchy in wars with the Hungarians. In 951 he accompanied King Otto on his Italian campaign against King Berengar II and acted as matchmaker for his brother, when he brought Queen Adelaide to Pavia. In turn he received the newly established March of Verona with Friuli, Aquileia, and Istria at the 952 Imperial Diet in Augsburg. In 953–954 Henry, temporarily deserted by his Bavarian subjects, brutally suppressed a revolt by Otto's son, Duke Liudolf of Swabia and Duke Conrad of Lorraine.\n\nWhile his brother gained a glorious victory over the Hungarians in the Battle of Lechfeld, Henry fell ill in 955 and died on 1 November in Pöhlde Abbey. His son and heir was Henry II, Duke of Bavaria. He was laid to rest in the abbey of Niedermünster in Regensburg, Bavaria, where his wife Judith is also buried.\n\nHenry married Judith, daughter of Arnulf, Duke of Bavaria. They had:\n\n"}

It is usually paid in cash or equivalent at the time of finalizing the transaction. A loan of some sort is then required to finance the remainder of the payment.\n\nThe main purposes of a down payment are to ensure that the lending institution has enough capital to create money for a loan in fractional reserve banking systems and to recover some of the balance due on the loan in the event that the borrower defaults. In real estate, the asset is used as collateral in order to secure the loan against default. If the borrower fails to repay the loan, the lender is legally entitled to sell the asset and retain enough of the proceeds to repay the remaining balance on the loan, including fees and interest added. A down payment, in this case, reduces the lender's risk to less than the value of the collateral, making it more likely that the lender will recover the full amount in the event of default.\n\nThe size of the down payment thus determines the extent to which the lender is protected against the various factors that might reduce the value of the collateral, as well as lost profits between the time of the last payment and the eventual sale of the collateral.\n\nFurthermore, making a down payment demonstrates that the borrower is able to raise a certain amount of money for long-term investment, which the lender may desire as evidence that the borrower's finances are sound, and that the borrower is not borrowing beyond his or her means.\n\nIf the borrower is unable to pay off the loan in its entirety, the down payment amount is forfeited.\n\nIn the United States, down payments for home purchases typically vary between 3.5% and 20% of the purchase price. The Federal Housing Administration has advocated lower down payments since its inception in 1934, and, currently, borrowers that qualify for an FHA loan pay only 3.5% for a down payment. With rising home prices in the years from 2000 to 2007, lenders were willing to accept smaller or no down payment (either through 100% financing, seller-assisted down payment assistance, government down payment providers or by providing a combination of an 80% first and 20% second mortgages) so that more individuals could purchase homes as their primary residences. Currently, in the United States, the Department of Veterans Affairs offers complete financing for qualifying veterans. The USDA Home Loan program also offers complete mortgage loans with no down payment. These loans are available as direct or guaranteed loans and are offered to qualifying borrowers purchasing a home in a more rural area. Most state finance housing agencies offer down payment assistance. Down Payment Assistance programs are all different with certain requirements for each. State or local housing authorities, a non-profit organization, or lender usually set the requirements and conditions for the DPA program. Some programs require you or your loan officer to take a short course on Down Payment Assistance for first time home buyers. Homebuyer assistance programs vary by state and can amount to up to three percent of the loan amount for down payment or closing costs. Some states have special programs supporting home purchases in selected geographic areas. \n\nThere is more risk for lenders when individuals purchase a home as an investment property. Therefore, the lender may charge a higher interest rate and expect a higher down payment.\n\n"}

He graduated from Lincoln High School, in Wheeling, then attended West Virginia State College for three years. His sister Ann played piano. Berry became interested in music at an early age, playing alto saxophone, at first with local bands. He was inspired to take up the tenor saxophone after hearing Coleman Hawkins on tour.\n\nMost of Berry's career was spent with swing bands: Sammy Stewart, 1929–1930, with whom he switched to tenor sax, Benny Carter, 1932–1933, Teddy Hill, 1933–1935, Fletcher Henderson, 1935–1937, Cab Calloway, his best-known affiliation, from 1937 to 1941.\n\nThroughout his brief career, Berry was in demand as a sideman for recording sessions under the names of various other jazz artists, including Spike Hughes (1933), Bessie Smith (1933), The Chocolate Dandies (1933), Mildred Bailey (1935–1938), Teddy Wilson (1935–1938), Billie Holiday (1938–1939), Wingy Manone (1938–1939) and Lionel Hampton (1939).\n\nDuring the period 1934–1939, while saxophone pioneer Hawkins was playing in Europe, Berry was one of several younger tenor saxophonists, such as Budd Johnson, Ben Webster and Lester Young who vied for supremacy on their instrument. Berry's mastery of advanced harmony and his smoothly-flowing solos on uptempo tunes influenced such young innovators as Dizzy Gillespie and Charlie Parker. The latter named his first son Leon in Chu's honor.\n\nBerry was one of the jazz musicians who took part in jam sessions at Minton's Playhouse in New York City, which led to the development of bebop.\n\n\"Christopher Columbus\", which Berry composed with lyrics by Andy Razaf, was the last important hit recording of the Fletcher Henderson orchestra, recorded in 1936. It is one of the most popular riff tunes from the swing era. It was incorporated into Jimmy Mundy's arrangement of Sing, Sing, Sing for Benny Goodman's band. This was used as the final showstopper in Goodman's first Carnegie Hall jazz concert of January 16, 1938.\n\nFour sessions were organized with Berry as leader, in 1937, 1938, and 1941.\n\nBerry died on October 27, 1941 in Conneaut, Ohio, from a car accident.\n\nChu Berry is the unofficial name of a series of saxophones produced by the C.G. Conn company during the 1920s, though it is more accurate to refer to them as the Conn New Wonder Series II.\n\nC.G. Conn never used the term \"Chu Berry\" to refer to any of their saxophones. Berry played a model of tenor sax generally known as the Conn Transitional and is not known to have ever played a New Wonder Series II.\n\nSome saxophone owners use the term \"Chu Berry\" in reference to any Conn saxophone made between 1910 and the mid-1930s, including soprano, alto, baritone and C melody saxophones, none of which Berry played.\n\n\n"}

The park is built around its namesake \"Big Spring\", the original water source that the city of Huntsville was built around. The Huntsville Museum of Art and Von Braun Center are located in the park. The park is also notable as the venue for the Panoply Arts Festival, held the last full weekend in April, Big Spring Jam, an annual music festival held on the fourth weekend in September from 1993 to 2011, and The Battle of the Buffalo, a buffalo wings competition held by the University of Alabama in Huntsville Alpha Tau Omega fraternity to support cancer research.\n\nThe Big Spring is a large, underground karst spring. Hearing of the abundant water source and plentiful big game, John Hunt, Huntsville's founder, sought out the spring and settled near it in 1805 on the bluff above, which later became the site of the First National Bank of Huntsville. Isaac and Joseph Criner had previously reached the Big Spring and considered settlement, but due to the presence of bears and mosquitoes left to settle New Market instead. During the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century, the spring was Huntsville's water source, due to its massive flow. The Big Spring is the largest limestone spring in North Alabama, with its usual flow between 7 and per day, depending on the time of the year.\n\nFrom 1827 to the early 1840s, what would later become the park grounds served as the site of the Fearn Canal, built from 1821 to 1824. The canal was built by the Indian Creek Navigation Company, led by local resident Dr. Thomas Fearn. It linked downtown Huntsville and the spring to the Tennessee River, allowing traders to bypass a costly wagon haul of about 11 miles South to the nearest river port, Ditto's Landing in the town of Whitesburg. The canal eventually became obsolete upon the construction of railroads.\n\nThe Big Spring also served as the source of the city's water supply from settlement to the late 1960s when the Tennessee Valley Authority built the water treatment plant on the Tennessee River. The first pumphouse was built in the 1830s. It was enclosed in the 1850s. A water turbine pushed water up the bluffs through cedar pipes to reach the city's residents. Until 1840, the city waterwork's system was privately owned by the family of settler LeRoy Pope. His son sold the land to the city cheaply on the condition his heirs received their water for free and that the space around the Big Spring Basin would be open to the public. The first pumphouse was torn down in 1860 prior to the American Civil War and replaced by the second pumphouse made out of stone. New pumps were put in but little changed during the war. In 1890, the second pumphouse was extended with a new wing and smokestack to meet the new water needs as the city expanded and the new Monte Sano Hotel opened. This pumphouse was torn down by Col. Hiram. W. Chittenden of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in 1899, and the waterworks system was moved further into the city. The third pumphouse would stand near California Street until the 1960s, when the water treatment plant would be built on the Tennessee River.\n\nBig Spring Park is named for a spring named \"the big spring\" by the indigenous Cherokee and Chickasaw. The original park site is situated in downtown Huntsville, starting from the west side of the courthouse square, and extending about two blocks southwest. This part of the park includes the spring itself and a canal extending to the rest of the park. The park's construction began September 21, 1898, under the direction of Colonel W. Hiram Chittenden of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, stationed at the park during the Spanish–American War. Col. Chittenden became interested in the park and the source of the Big Spring. While exploring the source of the Big Spring, he discovered that horse waste from the courthouse square above was seeping into the city's water supply that the Big Spring produced. Col. Chittenden and his men tore down the pumphouse located at the basin of the Big Spring, put in a fountain, and lined the canal from 1898 to 1901. The park expanded across Church Street to the space which now has the park's lagoon in 1968. In 2005, the park underwent additional expansion across Monroe Street to include a $284,000 fountain and a canal alongside the Von Braun Center.\nToday the park prominently features gifts given by other countries and foreign nationals to the city of Huntsville, including a 1903 light beacon (often referred to as \"the lighthouse\") and a 1929 fog bell given by Norway in 1973. Other smaller gifts include a bench from the United Kingdom and a sundial from Germany.\nThe most recognizable gifts, however, are the iconic red Japanese bridge and cherry trees, given by Japanese Major General Mikio Kimata. From 1964 to 1966, Kimata, then a Lieutenant Colonel, attended Redstone Arsenal's Ordnance Guided Missile School program. As thanks to the city for its hospitality when hosting him, Kimata donated the original 60 Yoshino Cherry trees. He followed up on this gift with the donation of a \"friendship bridge\" to celebrate the United States Bicentennial. The bridge was formally dedicated on May 3, 1977. In 1998, Kimata and the Japanese Society of Alabama partially financed a major $36,000 renovation of the bridge. The bridge was restyled, expanded, and given a gentler slope.\n\nA final gift, restored to its proper place in 1995, was the marble lion that sits near the Big Spring Fountain. The city was given the marble lion to commemorate the opening of the park. In the late 1960s, it had been pushed into the canal by vandals. It was salvaged and restored in 1995.\n\nThe park served as a major filming location in \"Constellation\", a 2005 feature film.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2335682", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2335682", "title": "Immediate family", "text": "Immediate family\n\nThe immediate family is a defined group of relations, used in rules or laws to determine which members of a person's family are affected by those rules. It normally includes a person's parents, siblings, spouses, children, or an individual related by blood whose close association is an equivalent of a family relationship. It can contain others connected by birth, adoption, marriage, civil partnership, or cohabitation, such as grandparents, great-grandparents, grandchildren, great-grandchildren, aunts, uncles, siblings-in-law, half-siblings, cousins, adopted children and step-parents/step-children, and cohabiting partners. The term close relatives is used similarly.\n\nThe concept of \"immediate family\" acknowledges that a person has or may feel particular responsibilities towards family members, which may make it difficult to act fairly towards non-family (hence the refusal of many companies to employ immediate family members of current employees), or which call for special allowance to recognise this responsibility (such as compensation on death, or permission to leave work to attend a funeral). It is used by travel insurance policies to determine a set of people on the basis of whose health someone might need to cancel a journey or return early. The concept is used by some countries' inheritance laws.\n\nThe exact meaning of \"immediate family\" varies, and will sometimes be defined in legislation or rules for a particular purpose. This can change over time: in 2005 the Scottish Government proposed to change the definition for purposes of compensation payments after deaths. The definition was to be expanded from \"a remaining spouse, sexual cohabitant, parent, step-parent or step-child, parent-in-law or child-in-law, or an individual related by blood whose close association is an equivalent of a family relationship who was accepted by the deceased as a child of his/her family\" to include \"any person who had accepted the deceased as a child of the family, the brother or sister of the deceased, any person brought up in the same household as a child and who was him/herself accepted as a child of the family, the same sex partner of the deceased, or any person who was the grandparent or grandchild of the deceased\".\nIn California, for purposes of subdivision of Labor Code Section 2066, \"immediate family member\" means spouse, domestic partner, cohabitant, child, stepchild, grandchild, parent, stepparent, mother-in-law, father-in-law, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, grandparent, great grandparent, brother, sister, half-brother, half-sister, stepsibling, brother-in-law, sister-in-law, aunt, uncle, niece, nephew, or first cousin (that is, a child of an aunt or uncle).\n\nThe Missouri Code of State Regulations,19 CSR 15-7.021 (18) (H) states that \"an immediate family member is defined as a parent; sibling; child by blood, adoption, or marriage; spouse; grandparent or grandchild.\"\n\nThe Australian Fair Work Act 2009, Section 12, defines immediate family as \"a spouse, de facto partner, child, parent, grandparent, grandchild or sibling of the employee; or a child, parent, grandparent or sibling of a spouse or de facto partner of the employee.\", and \"the definition of the term ‘de facto partner’ includes a former de facto partner.\"\n\nA travel insurance policy which covers curtailment due to the death or illness of a member of the policy-holder's \"immediate family\" uses a wide definition but adds residential requirements: \"Immediate Family is your Partner, and: parents, children, stepchildren, fostered or adopted children, brothers, sisters, aunts, uncles, cousins, nephews, nieces, grandchildren, or grandparents, of either you or your Partner, who live in your Home Country.\" and \"Partner is your spouse or someone of either sex with whom you have a permanent relationship, and who also lives with you at your Home.\"\n\nIn the United States, there are many rules and rights surrounding immediate family members in the wake of a family death. If the will names a non-immediate family member to be the executor of the will, he or she cannot have an \"official role in these matters\". Even if a person is not a joint owner, if they are an immediate family member a bank is likely to give them access to the deceased's safety deposit box. Some states that enforce no-contest provisions do not enforce them against immediate family members. In some states, the immediate family may receive a family allowance – a court-ordered amount paid to them from estate funds to provide help for living expenses. They may also entitled to homestead allowance – an amount of equity in the family home. In many states, household goods (sentimental but not expensive goods) can be passed onto immediate family members without probate.\n\nIn France, beneficiaries are almost always immediate family members.\n\nGenerally, the distribution to the immediate family leaves the spouse with the third or a half of the property and the issue with the balance. Usually, the pattern was to leave the entire estate to one's immediate family or other relatives, thereby \"preserving the family as a significant social unit\". The willing to other people or institutions is associated with either a wealth or an absence of an immediate family. If there is an absence of an immediate family, the testator is given the freedom to diverge from the usual distribution of property and wealth.\n\nIn some cases, a company will not employ an immediate family member of a current employee. Sometimes, \"authorized\" absence due to the death of one's immediate family member allows an employee to still be eligible for an attendance bonus. In these cases, the company the employee belongs to will acknowledge the significance of the absence and will, for example, be granted 3 working days off between the day of death and the day after the burial inclusive. Full-time workers can apply for bereavement leave, and part-time or temporary employees can apply for leave without pay.\n\nRules may specify that a person may not hold a particular office if they, \"or any member of their immediate family\" do not meet particular criteria. For example, a director of a NYSE company must be independent: neither they nor their family members may have been\nan executive officer of the company within the past 3 years, received more than $100,000 in direct compensation from the company in the past 3 years, or been employed as an executive officer of another firm within the past 3 years.\n\n"}

It was adapted from the story entitled \"Sheba\", which was written by Viña Delmar. The film was produced and distributed by First National Pictures, a subsidiary of Warner Bros.\n\nAlice White plays the part of a working class girl who dreams about living a life of luxury. Her father, Richard Carlyle, runs a cigar store while White works as a stenographer. William Bakewell, a soda jerker, is madly in love with White and has even asked her father for his consent to their marriage.

One day, White convinces Bakewell to take her to a fancy exclusive nightclub. Once they arrive and are seated, Bakewell is shocked at the prices and suggests that they go elsewhere. This leads to an argument with White. As the couple is about to leave, an announcement is made for a leg contest and White decides to enter. She wins first place and is awarded her prize by Chester Morris, a gangster. Dazzled by his fancy clothes and car, White accepts his attentions and give Bakewell the air.\n\nEventually Morris asks White to go away with him. White naively thinks that he intends to marry her. Before they make their trip, Morris, who is low on cash, robs a cigar store and in the process shoots the man behind the counter. Without knowing it, he has shot White's father.

The \"patacones\" were used to pay government bills, including state employees' salaries during a period when the economic crisis caused regular currency (Argentine pesos) to be scarce. \"Patacones\" then circulated in the economy in much the same way as pesos.\n\nFirst issued during the peso/U.S. dollar convertibility regime, just like other complementary currency Patacones could be attractive due to a revenue scheduled for payment in 2003 in pesos (practically equivalent to dollars). When the convertibility was abandoned amid fears of hyperinflation, the attractiveness of this revenue practically disappeared. The basis for the acceptability of complementary currency shifted to their use to pay taxes.\n\nHowever, the value of Patacones became eroded as the series \"B\" was issued because as a way to put pressure on the Government to cancel a large debt, the company that printed them eliminated many safety features deemed too expensive, thus making them easier to counterfeit. Also, the revenue of series \"B\" was scheduled for payment just in 2006. The economic importance of Buenos Aires province ensured the acceptability of Patacones because there were plenty of large companies that found use for them as payment of provincial charges. Patacones were accepted outside the Buenos Aires province and eventually circulated (albeit informally) in border areas of neighboring countries.\n\nThe name \"patacón\" is derived from a former Argentine national currency, and had been used in various places as a variant name for the Peso. It was colloquially or jokingly used as a synonym of \"money\".

{"id": "2335721", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2335721", "title": "Battle of Millesimo", "text": "Battle of Millesimo\n\nThe Battle of Millesimo, fought on 13 and 14 April 1796, was the name that Napoleon Bonaparte gave in his correspondence to one of a series of small battles that were fought in Liguria, Northern Italy between the armies of France and the allied armies of the Habsburg Monarchy and of the Kingdom of Sardinia-Piedmont.\n\nIn late March 1796, General Bonaparte took command of the French Army of Italy, which consisted of around 40,000 men under arms. After being attacked near Genoa on 10 April by the left wing of the Habsburg army, under Feldzeugmeister Johann Beaulieu, Bonaparte initiated the Montenotte Campaign. The French advanced through the Cadibona Pass to defeat the isolated right wing of the Habsburg army, commanded by Feldmarschal-Leutnant (FML) Eugène-Guillaume Argenteau, at the Battle of Montenotte on 12 April. The French then moved further inland, intending to capture Dego and increase the separation between the Habsburg army and that of its ally, Piedmont-Sardinia.\n\nAfter his victory at Montenotte, Bonaparte swung the main weight of his offensive to the west against FML Michelangelo Colli's 21,000-strong Sardinian army. To keep Beaulieu's Habsburg army from interfering, the French commander sent André Masséna's division to seize Dego to the north. On 13 April, General of Division Pierre Augereau attacked FML Giovanni di Provera's weak Austrian Auxiliary Corps east of Millesimo and defeated him.\n\nTo cover the withdrawal of his command, Provera retreated to Cosseria Castle with part of the Hasbsburg \"Gyulai\" Freikorps and two grenadier companies of the \"Strassoldo\" Infantry Regiment # 27. Colonel Filippo Del Carretto's newly arrived Sardinian 3rd Grenadier battalion soon joined Provera. Bonaparte ordered the partly ruined hilltop castle to be taken. Augereau and General of Division Meynier's divisions mounted repeated assaults, but the allied garrison resisted stoutly. After leading the last attack of the day, Colonel Barthélemy Joubert wrote, Nothing more terrible could be imagined than the assault, where I was wounded passing through a loophole; my carabiniers held me up in the air, with one hand I grasped the top of the wall. I parried the stones with my saber, and my whole body was the target for two entrenchments dominating the position ten paces off.\n\nThat evening, Augereau invested the castle while Bonaparte regrouped his forces. Early the next morning Augereau summoned the castle to surrender, whereupon Provera capitulated. By that time his men were out of food, ammunition, and water.\n\nThe report that Bonaparte wrote to the French government regarding the actions that took place around Millesimo, and which he called \"The Battle of Millesimo\" is confusing, and perhaps even deliberately misleading, as it is probable that Bonaparte did not want to reveal at the time how serious French casualties had been, and how close he had been to having his plans seriously compromised. There was, in fact, no real battle at Millesimo itself, but rather a confused action on 13 April, in which a number of small enemy units were driven back, followed by a short but very costly siege of the castle of Cosseria, which was defended by only about a thousand Austrians and Piedmontese under Provera and Del Carretto. It was only after the defenders had been forced to surrender the castle on 14 April, due to lack of ammunition, food and water, that the French advance inland could continue in safety. Bonaparte later admitted to the Piedmontese chief-of-staff, Colonel Joseph Costa that the siege of Cosseria had been a mistake and had been due to his impatience. It was probably because he wanted to cover up this mistake that Bonaparte's report of the \"Battle of Millesimo\" was so misleading.\n\nThe French lost 700 men in their fruitless attacks on 13 April. Provera's 988 men suffered only 96 killed and wounded, but the remainder became prisoners of war. The French Adjutant General Jean Quenin and Colonel Pierre Banel, and the Sardinian Del Carretto were killed. Louis Suchet received promotion when his colonel was killed in the attack. Losses in the brief action earlier in the day are not known. The surrender of the castle allowed the French offensive to continue. On 14 April, Masséna won the Second Battle of Dego. Soon after, Bonaparte launched his army in a relentless westward drive against Colli's Austro-Sardinian forces.\n\n\n"}

After her husband's death, she acted as regent of Bavaria during the minority of her son Henry the Wrangler.\nJudith was the eldest daughter of the Bavarian duke Arnulf the Bad and, traditionally, Judith of Friuli (although modern scholars point to Judith, daughter of Count Eberhard of Sülichgau). In the emerging Kingdom of Germany, her father tried to maintain the autonomy of his Bavarian stem duchy and entered into several conflicts with King Conrad I as well as with his Ottonian successor Henry the Fowler. According to the \"Annales iuvavenses\", he even proclaimed himself anti-king after Conrad's death in 918, nevertheless he reconciled with King Henry three years later.\n\nJudith's elder brother Eberhard succeeded his father as Bavarian duke in 937 and again picked a fierce quarrel with Henry's son King Otto I. In 938 the king campaigned the Bavarian lands, declared Eberhard deposed and enfeoffed his uncle Berthold as duke. Though Berthold remained a loyal supporter of the Ottonian dynasty, he failed to secure the Bavarian duchy for his minor son Henry the Younger. Instead, King Otto had evolved plans to create a dynastic relation with the Luitpoldings and to install his own brother, Henry I, as duke.\n\nShortly before her father's death in 937, Judith and Henry I were betrothed, thereby legitimising Henry's claims to the Bavarian throne. Through this matrimonial alliance between the Luitpolding and Ottonian dynasties, the Bavarian duchy entered the growing Kingdom of Germany, and Judith's descent would back the recognition of her husband's rule. Upon Berthold's death in 947, Henry I succeeded him as duke. Judith remained loyal to her husband, even when he was temporarily expelled by the Bavarian nobility during the revolt of his nephew, Duke Liudolf of Swabia, in 953.\n\nJudith's son Henry the Wrangler was born in 951; he was a minor when his father fell ill and died in 955, and she acted as regent for him. She turned out as a capable ruler over the vast Bavarian territories when she married her daughter Hadwig to Duke Burchard III of Swabia and also arranged the marriage of Henry the Wrangler with Princess Gisela of Burgundy, thereby forging a stable alliance between the South German duchies and the Burgundian kingdom. Judith also fostered good relations to the Ottonian dynasty and Empress Adelaide. According to the medieval chronicler Widukind of Corvey, she was \"a woman of exceptional wisdom\".\n\nShe made a pilgrimage to Jerusalem and, upon returning in 973, had to witness the rebellion of her son and his deposition by Emperor Otto II. She retired to the abbey of Niedermünster in Regensburg, where she is buried beside her husband. Judith was the progenitor of the Bavarian branch of the Ottonian dynasty; her grandson Henry II was elected king in 1002 and crowned Holy Roman Emperor in 1014. Some sources mention a younger, possibly illegitimate son of her husband named Brun, who married and had descendants, though an affiliation with the Brunswick Brunonids has not been conclusively established.\n"}

Produced in collaboration with the NFL and written by Fabian Nicieza and artist Jose Delbo, the series started publication in 1991 and ended after 12 issues.\n\nNicieza wrote a story centering on Phil Grayfield, once an aspiring football player. His career ended when he saved a child from falling and suffered a horrific knee injury. He became a sports reporter and interviewed an eccentric football superfan, who also happened to be a scientist. This scientist designed a new, almost indestructible football uniform, which has to be molded on an \"individual basis\" and costs five million dollars to construct — so it is \"worth a fortune\".\n\nSuddenly interrupting the interview, thieves raid the eccentric's house, overwhelm the two of them, steal a van load of NFL merchandise (but not the uniform), and torch the building. Grayfield, who is tied up, knocks over experimental chemicals, which — in combination with the fire and diverse ultra-rare football souvenirs going up in flames — do not incinerate him, but turn him into a near-invincible superhero.\n\nGrayfield puts on the eccentric's football uniform and brings the villains to justice, dedicating his life to fighting crime and dubbing himself \"SuperPro\".\n\nThe first issue starring NFL SuperPro was \"\"NFL SuperPro Special Edition # 1\"\", cover-dated March 1991. The series began with issue \"\"NFL SuperPro # 1\"\" (cover-date October 1991) and ended with \"\"NFL SuperPro # 12\"\" (cover-date September 1992). On two occasions, \"NFL SuperPro\" featured a crossover, a common practice in comic books to boost sales; Spider-Man (in issue # 1) and Captain America (in issue # 8).\n\nThe character NFL SuperPro has not been seen since the demise of the series. Writer Robert Kirkman reportedly wanted to use SuperPro in an issue of \"Marvel Team-Up\" but could not, due to copyright concerns. The closest he came was \"Marvel Team-Up\" #9, in which the character Stilt-Man says, \"I beat up a guy called SuperPro last week. Silliest looking guy...\".\n\n\"NFL SuperPro\" has been called one of the worst comics in recent Marvel Comics history, becoming a cult object. Often cited in this claim are issues with the plot and the characters. For example, in the first issue a group of thieves incinerate valuable NFL merchandise but it is never explained why they burn it instead of selling it off. Writer Fabian Nicieza has admitted he wrote the story to gain free NFL tickets. He stated that he still receives flak for the comic.\n\nNicieza left \"Superpro\" after four issues, and was replaced with Buzz Dixon; one of Dixon's issues, which featured Hopi villains who used kachina-themed costumes and weapons, drew substantial complaints from Hopi representatives, leading Marvel to officially recall the comic. Dixon left \"Superpro\" after three issues.\n\nIn 2005, the Chicago Sports Review called it \"perhaps the worst comic book ever created\".\n\n\n\n\n"}

Often intended for consumer use, these provide information concerning programming on various television channels available to the reader – either via terrestrial, free-to-air, cable, satellite or over-the-top MVPD – indicating at what time and on what channel they are due to be broadcast over a period usually encompassing about seven- to 14-days in advance.\n\nSince the early days of television, such listings have been printed in local newspapers, newspaper inserts, or magazines (including specialized listings magazines), but are now often viewed as electronic program guides available on set-top boxes and most digital TV sets.\n\nMost print listings publications originally displayed programming information a text-based format modeled after program logs maintained by local broadcasters, which organized programs first by their scheduled airtime and secondarily by channel, a format that allowed complete program titles and synopses of reasonable detail to be incorporated into the guide. With the formation of other broadcast and subscription channels in subsequent years, set space requirements resulted in detailed synopses being gradually restricted to series and specials – usually those airing in evening timeslots – as well as movies.\n\nSince the 1980s, grids – which organize listings primarily by channel in correspondence to airtime – have become the common format for displaying listings information, as it allows more space to display programming data for an expanded lineup of channels. Many national and local TV listings magazines (such as \"TV Guide\" in the United States) originally incorporated grids to show prime time listings, but would eventually begin expanding them to encompass the full broadcast day during the late 1980s and 1990s. For print publications, space requirements have largely limited the availability and detail of programming information that can be incorporated into a grid format; however, because web- and application-based APIs can fit more information into such a structure, the format does allow for detailed synopses to be included into a grid. However, most websites and mobile apps offering program listings usually incorporate synopses and other information concerning a specific television program in a clickable or swipeable dialog box.\n\nProgram listings data is compiled by various metadata providers throughout the world, which provide data to specific regions or countries. The most prominent provider of television program metadata is Gracenote, which assumed most responsibilities for program metadata dissemination from Tribune Media Services, following Tribune Media's acquisition of Gracenote (now owned by Nielsen), in 2014. Gracenote's On Entertainment service provides TV listings and synopses for approximately 85 countries – including the United States and Canada – and 35 languages, and maintains a database of program data for approximately six million television series and movies for guidance for various websites and electronic programming guides. Within the United Kingdom, Press Association, Red Bee Media Broadcasting Dataservices, REDNI and DigiGuide serve as the major providers of television listings metadata.\n\nThe first television program guide to be published was released by New York City television station WNBT (now NBC owned-and-operated station WNBC) in June 1941; the station mailed \"program cards\" containing programming information for the week of 30 June to 5 July, to local owners of television sets. The program cards were attached with an \"opinion card\" at the bottom of the guide, which NBC asked owners to fill out and mail to the network.\n\nThe first local \"television guide books\" first began publication during 1948: \"Television Forecast\" in Chicago, the \"Local Televiser\" in Philadelphia, and the \"TeleVision Guide\" in New York City. The former of the three was the first continuously published television listings magazine, when \"Television Forecast\" first became sold on newsstands on 9 May 1948. Founder Les Viahon and three other partners bankrolled the venture with an initial funding round of $250 each; they initially published \"Television Forecast\" in the basement classroom of Abbot Hall at Northwestern University, and bounded the inaugural issue with staplers borrowed from Northwestern professors. First sold on 14 June 1948, \"The TeleVision Guide\" was founded by MacFadden Publications and Cowles Media Company circulation director Lee Wagner. During the late 1940s and early 1950s, Wagner began publishing regional editions of \"The TeleVision Guide\" for New England and the Baltimore–Washington area. Brothers Irvin and Arthur Borowsky, co-founders of the North American Publishing Company, began publishing the \"Local Televiser\" (which was subsequently retitled \"Philadelphia TV Digest\" following its initial issues) on 7 November 1948, with the intent of using the publication to serve as a promotional tool to increase television sales by way of a commitment from local distributors of Philco television sets to pay 50% of the publishing costs and the provision of television set ownership lists. Many local newspapers throughout the United States also began publishing weekly listings guides for distribution as supplements in their Sunday editions, eventually extending to daily schedule inserts within the lifestyles/entertainment sections of their weekday editions.\n\nIn the winter of early 1953, Wagner sold \"The TeleVision Guide\" to Philadelphia-based newspaper and magazine publisher Walter Annenberg, who folded the magazine into his multimedia company Triangle Publications. (Wagner would serve as a consultant for its successor national magazine until 1963.) Triangle concurrently purchased numerous regional television listing publications including \"TV Forecast\", \"TV Digest\" and the \"Local Televiser\", intending to develop a national television magazine. Wagner's publication served as the prototype for \"TV Guide\" (originally adopted as the renaming of the New York-based \"TeleVision Guide\" on 18 March 1950), which Triangle first released as a national publication on 3 April of that year, with a cover story about Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz's newborn son Desi Arnaz, Jr., who was referred to under the headline: \"Lucy's $50,000,000 baby\". 1.56 million copies of the digest-sized first issue were sold across ten U.S. cities.\n\nWhile the initial issue was an almost instant success, \"TV Guide\"s circulation decreased with subsequent issues, even as the magazine's distribution expanded to five additional cities (Pittsburgh, Rochester, Detroit, Cleveland and San Francisco) throughout the summer of 1953. Sales of \"TV Guide\" began to reverse course with the 4–10 September 1953, \"Fall Preview\" issue, which had an average circulation of 1,746,327 copies; by the mid-1960s, \"TV Guide\" had become the most widely circulated magazine in the United States.\n\nAs cable television grew in distribution across the United States, methods to provide alternatives to print television listings began to be developed. In 1981, Tulsa, Oklahoma-based United Video Satellite Group (later Gemstar-TV Guide International) launched the first widely distributed electronic program guide service in North America, in the form of a cable channel known simply as the Electronic Program Guide (EPG). (Some cable providers had maintained their own in-house EPGs dating to the late 1970s.) The channel – which eventually evolved into the general entertainment network Pop – was developed with the creation of a software application sold to cable television providers in the United States and Canada to provide 24-hour-a-day program listings in a scrolling grid format to their subscribers on a dedicated cable channel. It had the ability to display programming information up to 90 minutes in advance, utilizing raw listings data supplied via satellite to a computer unit installed in the headend facilities of participating systems to present that data to subscribers in a format customized to the system's channel lineup. The initial grid covered the entire screen and was programmed to provide four hours of listings information suited to each system's entire channel lineup, uploaded and displayed one half-hour period at a time. The EPG software was originally designed only to generate video, resulting in cable operators uplinking a local FM radio station or a cable-originated audio service provider (such as Cable Radio Network) to serve as the channel's audio feed.\n\nAn \"optional\" software upgrade released for the Amiga 1000-based EPG Sr. in 1987, incorporated a modified listings grid that was confined to the lower half of the screen. The split-screen configuration allowed for static or animated graphical advertisements for local and national businesses and logos (primarily for promotions for cable channels carried by the local system) to be created locally by each cable system operator and uploaded to the software to fill the video feed's upper half. In 1988, United Video made further upgrades to the revised EPG Sr. software (then renamed the Prevue Guide, later known as TV Guide Channel and TV Guide Network), and integrated the system with the Amiga 2000 personal computing system; the upgrades also allowed support for video and accompanying audio in the top-half video feed, allowing for video-sourced commercials and program promotions to appear in either the left or right halves of the upper-half video feed, often coupled with title, channel and airtime data to appear in the opposing halves.\n\nIn 1986, Chris Schultheiss and engineer Peter Hallenbeck of STV/Onsat – a publishing company that had been known for distributing print listings guides – introduced SuperGuide, an interactive electronic programming guide for home satellite subscribers. The original system stored programming information (up to around one week in advance of the current date) through a locally sourced computer system, and was programmed to allow a remote control to interact with the unit. Users had to turn off the guide once they found a show they wanted to watch, and then change the channel on the satellite receiver to the appropriate service. Listings information was distributed by satellite to the SuperGuide software to the home owner's dish.\n\nAn upgraded version of SuperGuide was released in March 1990; integrated into the Uniden 4800 receiver, this version – the first commercially available unit for home use that had a locally stored guide integrated with the receiver for viewing and taping at the touch of a button – included hardware that allowed storage of up to two weeks of programming information and permitted users to access the channel carrying the show they wanted to watch or set it to record (controlling a VCR unit via an infrared output) by remote.\n\nIn June 1988, Eli Reiter, Michael H. Zemering and Frank Shannon were awarded a patent for an interactive program guide (IPG) that allowed users to search programming information by title or category. In 1996, Prevue Networks (the parent of what, by that point, had become the Prevue Channel) introduced Prevue Interactive (later known as TV Guide Interactive and then iGuide), the first IPG service distributed in the United States, which was initially designed for General Instrument's DCT 1000 series of set-top digital cable converter boxes.\n\nIn 1995, software company TV Host, Inc. launched the Electronic TV Host, a web-based, subscription IPG service that allowed users to download and search program listings, set reminders for programs users wanted to watch or record, and create personalized television listings pertaining to their viewing tastes. Electronic TV Host was developed as both a website and a free-to-download desktop application for Windows 95 (and later, Windows 98 and Windows 2000) that allowed users to download program listings for a monthly or annual subscription. \"TV Guide\" followed with its own web-based listings service in March 1996, with the launch of the iGuide. Originally developed by the News Corporation-MCI joint venture Delphi Internet Service Corp. as a web portal, it initially featured a mix of comprehensive television listings, news content, \"TV Guide\" editorial content and a search feature called CineBooks, which allowed users to access detailed information on about 30,000 film titles. In January 1997, iGuide was relaunched as the TV Guide Entertainment Network (TVGEN; later renamed TV Guide Online in 2002), refocusing on television, music, movies and sports listings and information, along with wire news and features from Reuters, \"Daily Variety\" and \"The New York Post\", free e-mail updates for registered users, and a chat room that was developed to accommodate 5,000 users simultaneously.\n\nOn 1 March 1991, the monopoly on listings magazines ended and the market was opened up. Before this, there were two magazines on the market: \"Radio Times\", began in 1923, for BBC listings and \"TV Times\", began in 1955, for ITV and, from 1982, Channel 4 listings. A number of magazines appeared on the market at that time: \"TV Quick\", \"What's on TV\" and the short-lived \"TV Plus\". By the mid-1990s \"What's on TV\" was Britain's best-selling weekly magazine but in 2008 a rival publication, \"TV Choice\" (began in 1999 by Bauer Media Group) achieved a higher circulation. \"TV Choice\" has a similar design and format but at a lower price.\n\nTraditionally these have been simple broadcast programming lists of what appears in chronological order on the various channels available, having been designed for an age in which there were only a few channels, and where the only medium was paper. Now there over 600 channels in the UK alone, the internet offers different formats and possibilities for TV listings (e.g. www.tvguide.co.uk), and television is starting to appear in both mobile and internet formats, so the whole approach to TV listings is changing. In addition, most UK newspapers publish a full week's listings guide in their Saturday and Sunday editions.\n"}

Nexen was acquired by Hong Kong-based CNOOC Limited in 2013, and was rebranded under the current name at the end of 2018.\n\nIt has three growth strategies : oil sands and shale gas in western Canada as well as conventional exploration and development primarily in the North Sea, offshore in West Africa, and deepwater exploration in the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nNexen started in 1971 as Canadian Occidental Petroleum (CanOxy), and was 80% owned by Occidental Petroleum, an oil company based in Los Angeles. In the first decade of its existence, CanOxy was fairly Canadian-oriented. During the 1980s and 1990s they increased their international holdings, first in the Gulf of Mexico, then into places like Yemen and the North Sea. Further Canadian assets were also acquired.\n\nIn the 1990s, CanOxy purchased the assets of what once was the first state-owned oil and gas company in North America; Wascana Energy Inc., formerly known as SaskOil. Founded by Saskatchewan New Democratic Party Premier Allan Blakeney in 1973, Saskoil was privatized in 1986 by Progressive Conservative Premier Grant Devine.\n\nIn 2000, the company partnered with the Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan to buy back Occidental Petroleum's shares. The newly-independent company changed its name to Nexen and moved into the former headquarters of NOVA Corporation, what is now known as the Nexen Building.\n\nIn July 2012, CNOOC Limited, a major subsidiary of CNOOC headquartered in Beijing, announced its intention to acquire Nexen for C$15.1 billion. The proposal was accepted by shareholders in September under interim chief executive Kevin Reinhart, but was a matter of significant public and political debate in Canada. Prime Minister Stephen Harper approved the deal in December 2012 but simultaneously announced more stringent guidelines for foreign acquisitions of Canadian oil sands companies.\n\nThe acquisition closed in February 2013, representing China's largest-ever foreign acquisition. Nexen's common stock shareholders received cash proceeds of US$27.50, without interest, whereas preferred stock shareholders of Nexen received cash proceeds of CAD$26, plus accrued and unpaid dividends without interest. In April 2014, Fang Zhi replaced Kevin Reinhart as the firm's chief executive. Two years after the deal, in 2015, about 14% of the company's workforce (300 in Calgary and 40 in the field) was fired in a move the drew concern in relation to Chinese ownership, but which at the time was consistent with layoffs at other companies in the industry in response to global oil price depression.\n\nThe Nexen name disappeared from both legal and practical perspectives on December 31, 2018, and it became known as CNOOC Petroleum North America ULC henceforth. Simultaneously and with the same date of effectiveness, related Nexen subsidiaries and affiliates changed both their legal and branding names. Its American depository receipts remained concurrently traded on the TSX and its ultimate parent company, CNOOC Limited, remained a foreign reporting issuer in Canada.\n\nNexen has interests in Canada (including the Athabasca oil sands through a 7.23% ownership of Syncrude and the Long Lake project), the UK North Sea, the United States, and offshore West Africa. Beginning in February 2013, Nexen took accountability for managing approximately $8 billion in CNOOC Limited assets located throughout North and Central America.\n\nThe Long Lake project in the Athabasca Oil Sands was initiated in 2001, as a 50/50 partnership between Nexen and OPTI Canada. It was started in order to develop the Long Lake site using steam-assisted gravity drainage and OPTI's OrCrude process for on-site upgrading. Production capacity at Long Lake was estimated of bitumen per day which could be upgraded to of synthetic crude. The proved reserves at the Long Lake site are 310,000,000 bbls. In 2017, the site produced approximately of bitumen.\n\nThe Long Lake site has had a troubled history, including OPTI's near-bankruptcy in 2011 (with Nexen growing its ownership stake to 65% and eventually 100%), a significant oil spill in 2015, and an explosion in 2016 that resulted in two deaths and the permanent shutdown of the upgrader.\n\nIn 2018, Nexen announced a $400 million expansion project, which is expected to begin production in late 2020.\n\nNexen also has an Energy Marketing division that trades and markets proprietary and third-party crude oil, natural gas, liquid natural gas, and electrical power.\n\n"}
{"id": "2335831", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2335831", "title": "McCormick Observatory", "text": "McCormick Observatory\n\nThe Leander McCormick Observatory is one of the astronomical observatories operated by the Department of Astronomy of the University of Virginia and is situated just outside Charlottesville, Virginia (US) in Albemarle County on the summit of Mount Jefferson (also known as Observatory Hill). It is named for Leander J. McCormick (1819–1900), who provided the funds for the telescope and observatory.\n\nLeander McCormick was the son of Robert McCormick (1780–1846), the inventor of a mechanical reaper, and brother of Cyrus H. McCormick, who patented it and undertook the large scale manufacture and marketing of the invention. The McCormick family's homestead of Walnut Grove was located near Raphine, Virginia, although they moved to Chicago in 1848 to manufacture the reaper on a large scale. In Chicago, Cyrus, Leander and their brother William founded what became the McCormick Harvesting Machine Company and eventually International Harvester.\n\nIn 1870 Leander decided to donate the largest telescope in the world to his home state of Virginia. However, the financial impact of the American Civil War on Virginia as well as the impact of the Great Chicago Fire on his own finances, delayed his effort. In addition to the University of Virginia, for years he was also considering Washington College (later Washington and Lee University) in Lexington, Virginia, since it was located much closer to the family homestead. In 1870, Robert E. Lee, who was then president of Washington College, sent a letter of introduction to Joseph Henry, secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, making known McCormick's wishes to establish an astronomical observatory in the state. It was largely through the efforts of Charles Scott Venable (aide-de-camp to Gen. Robert E. Lee from 1862 to 1865 and professor of mathematics at the University of Virginia from 1865 to 1896) that McCormick finally decided to make his gift to the University of Virginia in 1877. In 1878, the University of Virginia officially received McCormick's donation of the telescope. This was followed in 1881 by a donation of $18,000 for the observatory itself, contingent on the University's raising the funds to endow the professorship.\n\nThe 65 cm refracting telescope was made by Alvan Clark & Sons of Cambridgeport, Massachusetts, who were regarded as the finest telescope makers of the age. At the time it was the equal largest telescope in the United States, and the second largest refractor in the world when completed. It was nearly a twin of the earlier 26-inch refractor at the U.S. Naval Observatory in Washington. However, the Clarks made some adjustments to the lens to improve the image quality over that of the Naval Observatory refractor. In 1877 while the McCormick Refractor was still in Cambridgeport, Alvan Clark used it to verify the discovery of the moons of Mars the night after the discovery observations were made by Asaph Hall with the Naval Observatory refractor.\n\nThe telescope and building were completed in 1884, and dedicated on April 13, 1885, Thomas Jefferson's birthday. The dome, at 45 feet, was the largest in the world when completed; it was designed by Warner and Swasey with a unique three shutter design.\n\nThe first published observations to be carried out at the Observatory, before the telescope was even complete, was of the Transit of Venus on December 6, 1882. Observations were made at the site of the observatory as well as at the Rotunda of the University of Virginia.\n\nUnder the first director, Ormond Stone, a program to measure the positions of southern stars was carried out (an extension on the Durchmusterung star catalogue to -23 degrees). In addition, the orbits of southern double stars were measured and southern nebulae were observed.\n\nStarting in 1914 the second director, Samuel Alfred Mitchell, began a program to measure the distances to nearby stars (stellar parallax) using photography. This program continued under the next two directors, Harold Alden and Laurence Fredrick; over the course of more than 80 years, the distances to thousands of stars have been determined with the McCormick Refractor. Peter van de Kamp, Alexander N. Vyssotsky, Emma T. R. Williams and Dirk Reuyl also carried out research on the number and types of stars seen in different directions, and from this deduced information about the size and shape of the Milky Way.\n\nThe Observatory is now used primarily for teaching and public outreach, and contains a museum of the history of astronomy at the University of Virginia. The observational research of the Astronomy Department is carried out at Fan Mountain Observatory, and at other observatories.\n\nSince the 1880s, daily weather observations have been taken at McCormick Observatory, and it has been part of the National Weather Service's Cooperative Observer Program (COOP) since the programs inception in 1890.\n\nThe telescope is the largest Alvan Clark refractor still mounted on its original Alvan Clark mount.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2335845", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2335845", "title": "Magic: The Gathering – Battlegrounds", "text": "Magic: The Gathering – Battlegrounds\n\nMagic: The Gathering – Battlegrounds is a real time strategy video game based on \"\" collectible card game, with many fundamental differences. The game is based on the creation of heroes and mages that summon forth powerful monsters, spells, and abilities to defeat the enemy duelist. Duelists learn new magical spells by completing the campaign, with more and more spell books becoming available as the player progresses. Each spell is separated into one of 5 colors, each with their own strengths and weaknesses.\n\nThe overall design of Battlegrounds differs significantly from that of the original card game source material. Battlegrounds consists entirely of real time combat, where duelists bring pre-meditated spellbooks to the table to duke it out. Beyond mastering some basic skills, victory is determined almost entirely in the metagame.\nEach player is represented by a duelist; the nature of duelists, dueling, magic, etc. is not addressed. The objective is to reduce the enemy duelist's life to 0; each player starts with 20 life. In the Arcade Duel mode, there is a ten-minute time limit for each duel, at which point the current leader is crowned victor. (The only alternate win condition is provided by the white enchantment Test of Endurance.) Before dueling, players can edit the spellbook they will bring to battle in an editor mode where the spells are represented by icons that the player rearranges. At the top of the screen, the current life totals and mana of the duelists is visible. A duelist can unleash a physical attack once per second to attack a creature or player directly in front of him/herself. This attack is apparently more effective when running forward. They can also summon a shield when not preoccupied with some other action to reduce damage to the duelist by half. The shield can be summoned indefinitely but drains the user's mana at a significant rate. Rounding seems to vary based on the source of damage. A variety of arenas from the Magic: the Gathering multiverse are selectable, but vary only aesthetically. Each arena is separated into halves, one for each duelist, that are separated by a glowing line. While in enemy territory, a duelist can wreak some havoc, namely the physical attack and stealing mana crystals and shards, but the trespasser is unable to cast spells or shields. After spending more than a moment across the center line, a duelist suffers a loss of two life every few seconds.\nSeveral of the duelist avatars, as well as all of the spells, are loosely transferred from the Magic: The Gathering trading card game and story. There are some discrepancies; for example, the costs of several spells are changed, presumably to balance gameplay and the relationship between the five colors, and the characters present from the Magic storyline did not all coexist (or even anything remotely similar) at any point in the story.\n\nMana is magical energy used to cast spells. A duelist gains mana by collecting Mana crystals that appear over the battlefield at timed intervals. This is an attempt to represent drawing mana from increasing numbers of tapped and untapped lands in the card game. Crystals become permanent additions that appear under your health bar and slowly fill with Mana. The more mana you let the bar fill up, the faster it will regenerate. Players can collect mana shards that litter the ground to faster fill their mana bar. When a creature is destroyed, a number of mana shards equal to the number of full mana required to cast the creature falls to the ground, where either duelist can claim them simply by stepping on or near them. Each shard restores approximately half of one mana instantaneously. The only source of mana shards beyond creature destructions are those produced every five seconds by the green creatures Llanowar Elves and Priest of Titania.\nMaintaining a mana advantage is more significant in Battlegrounds than in the card game, because there are no actual cards, and a given spell can be cast an indefinite number of times.\n\nAlmost everything a duelist can do in Battlegrounds is some type of spell (hence, even creatures are affected by Spelljack and Counterspell because they are creature spells). Players access spells by way of a customizable spellbook. During a duel, this is represented by menus-within-a-menu. The spellbook is organized into pages of three spells apiece, which can be toggled with the black or white button. A spellbook may contain no more than ten spells of no more than two colors. Any spell can be cast at any time, and an indefinite number of times, provided sufficient mana is available and spent. More expensive spells take longer to cast. While casting a spell a duelist can move freely, but if you cross the center line between your territory and the enemy's, your spell is countered. There are three types of spells, namely sorcery, creature and enchantment.\n\nLike the original cardgame, \"Battlegrounds\" allows players to mix decks, or spellbooks to mix spell, creatures, and enchantments to - theoretically - make stronger spellbooks. However, also in keeping with the original cardgame, this makes attaining the mana to successfully implement this grand strategy much more difficult, as the caster must obtain mana crystals of two colours instead of just one.\n\n"}

The sudden appearance of this \"Trading Estate\", which was quickly widely reproduced throughout Britain, prompted the poem. Seeing the new appearance of the town, Betjeman was struck by the \"menace of things to come\". He later regretted the poem's harshness. The poem is not about Slough specifically, but about the desecration caused by industrialization and modernity in general, with the transformation of Slough being the epitome of these evils. Nevertheless, successive mayors of Slough have objected to the poem.\n\nThe poem was published two years before the outbreak of World War II, during which Britain (including Slough itself) experienced actual air raids. Much later, in a guide to English churches, Betjeman referred to some churches as \"beyond the tentacles of Slough\" and \"dangerously near Slough\". However, on the centenary of Betjeman's birth in 2006, his daughter apologised for the poem. Candida Lycett-Green said her father \"regretted having ever written it\". During her visit, Lycett-Green presented Mayor of Slough David MacIsaac with a book of her father's poems. In it was written: \"We love Slough\".\n\nIn 2005, Ian McMillan published a poem titled \"Slough Re-visited\" using the same metre and rhyme-scheme as Betjeman's original, but celebrating Slough and rejecting mockery of the town as unfair.\n\nPunk band Gallows, who originally formed in Slough, and whose singer Frank Carter has frequently expressed his dislike for the town in interviews, have several references to Betjeman's poem in their music: their album \"Orchestra of Wolves\" features a song entitled \"Come Friendly Bombs\", and an earlier song entitled \"Swarm Over Death\" (released on the band's 2005 demo) features the lyrics \"Come friendly bombs/ And fall here now/ It isn't fit for humans now/ Swarm over death\".\n\nMorrissey used a similar theme in relation to the decline of British coastal resorts in his song \"Everyday Is Like Sunday\".\n\nIn the television series \"The Office\", which is set in Slough, the character David Brent (portrayed by Ricky Gervais), reads extracts of the poem interjected with comments such as \"You don't solve town planning problems by dropping bombs all over the place.\" The poem is reproduced in full on the liner of the video and DVD releases of the series.\n\n"}

In 1978, she formed Holly and the Italians and moved to London, England, where the band was welcomed by the British press and gained a recording contract with Virgin Records on the strength of the single \"Tell That Girl to Shut Up\". Holly and the Italians' debut album \"The Right to Be Italian\" had a troubled and long production and was a commercial failure, which led to the band's dissolution at the end of 1980, after a US tour supporting The Clash and the Ramones.\n\nVincent recorded under her name the album \"Holly and the Italians\" in the UK and was then deported to the US by the British authorities. She went to live in New York City, where she was a member of The Waitresses for a short time and played in other local groups. In 1990, she moved to Los Angeles and two years later recorded the album \"America\" with a new band that she had formed called The Oblivious. The album \"Vowel Movement\" followed in 1994, as a collaboration with Concrete Blonde singer Johnette Napolitano.\n\nVincent continues to write and record and recently has released albums mainly in digital format, including two collections of tech house music.\n\nHolly Beth Vincent was born in Chicago, Illinois in 1956 to Bob and June Vincent. Her mother was of Swedish and French background and her father, Italian; both of them had been big band singers during the 1940s. In 1962, her family moved to Lake Tahoe, Nevada, where Bob Vincent was the entertainment director of Harrah's Lake Tahoe and where the young Holly came in contact for the first time with professional performing artists. She is the sister of drummer Nick Vincent. When ten years old, she received her first acoustic guitar and began composing songs. After three years in Nevada, the family relocated to Los Angeles and Vincent started playing drums in high school bands, performing covers of The Rolling Stones and The Move. She ran away from home in 1972, but later returned to Los Angeles and completed schooling at William Howard Taft Charter High School. At 18 she went to live for a year and half in London, England with Chris Wood and his wife Jeannette; there she auditioned as drummer and met many British musicians, including Mark Knopfler, with whom she started a romantic relationship. Back in California, she earned money with obscure jobs, toured with a series of midwestern bar bands, was the drummer of the rockabilly outfit Brothel Creepers and a member of the all-female punk rock band Backstage Pass, where she played guitar and sang. Her musical and political preferences placed her within the nascent LA punk scene, gravitating around The Masque club.\n\nIn 1978, Vincent formed in Los Angeles the band Holly and the Italians with drummer Steve Young (aka Steve Dalton), whom she knew from high school. The new band moved to London in early 1979 and Vincent went to live with Knopfler. He introduced Vincent to BBC disc jockey and music historian Charlie Gillett, who was also the owner of Oval Records. Gillett put the new band, which was playing the local club scene at the time, under contract. Their bassist Bruce Lipson did not move to the United Kingdom and was replaced by the Briton Mark Sidgwick (aka Mark Henry), formerly of the band The Boyfriends. Guitarist Colin White also joined the group for live performances.\n\nThrough Oval Records, Holly and the Italians released in December 1979 the single \"Tell That Girl to Shut Up\", which was a minor hit in the UK and stirred the interest of the British music press. The papers treated the band as a major attraction in the period of new wave explosion and Vincent appeared twice on the front page of \"Melody Maker\", even before the single was released. \"Tell That Girl to Shut Up\", written by Vincent, became a UK top 50 hit again in 1988 when it was covered by the British pop rock band Transvision Vamp as the second single from their debut album \"Pop Art\". The song was cited by the magazine \"Mojo\" as one of the Top 20 Killer New Wave Tracks from the US.\n\nHolly and the Italians went on tour in the UK with The Clash and opened with ska band The Selecter for the American new wave chart-topping act Blondie at the Hammersmith Odeon in London on 22 January 1980, where they were noticed by renowned photographer Lynn Goldsmith. Goldsmith talked about the band in the United States to Gary Kurfirst, manager of bands such as Blondie, Ramones, The B-52's and Talking Heads, who took Holly and the Italians in his roster. The band eventually signed a two-album deal with Virgin Records, which had already distributed their first single. \nAt the beginning of 1980, Holly and the Italians moved to the US and started recording their debut album, \"The Right to Be Italian\", at Electric Lady Studios in New York City with 60s' girl-group producer Shadow Morton. The producer was fired halfway through and replaced with Richard Gottehrer, who started from scratch and recorded at Record Plant Studios in New York City the ten songs of the album from September up to December 1980, with Thom Panunzio as engineer. Internal struggles exploded within the group during the recordings and drummer Steve Young quit the band, replaced by Mike Osborn. The album features many additional musicians, such as Paul Shaffer and Anton Fig (who would later be part of The World's Most Dangerous Band, the house band for the \"Late Show with David Letterman\"), Jerry Harrison, The Uptown Horns, an orchestra conducted by Torrie Zito and singer Ellie Greenwich on the cover of The Chiffons' song \"Just for Tonight\". Vincent was unsatisfied with the sound of the album, so \"The Right to Be Italian\" was given a final remix in the UK by producer John Brand and finally released in February 1981, more than a year after the project was set in motion. Such a long gestation was very expensive for the record company and detrimental for the band, which lost its initial momentum and was attacked by the music press, turned hostile after a mismatched tour with The Selecter and The Bodysnatchers. The four singles released in the UK did not chart and contemporary reviews were mostly negative, with the album peaking only at No. 177 in the US \"Billboard\" 200 chart. \"The Right to Be Italian\" was re-evaluated in modern times and considered a pop punk masterpiece. It appears at No. 40 in the article \"60 Great Albums You've Probably Never Heard\" by Jody Rosen from the November 18, 2013 issue of \"New York Magazine\".\n\nHolly and the Italians went on tour in the US and in August 1980 played the major Heatwave festival near Toronto. The band notably toured with The Selecter, opened for The Clash during their \"Sandinista!\" tour pre-Bonds shows in New York City and did several shows around the US with the Ramones. They toured in the UK in the spring of 1981 and appeared on \"The Old Grey Whistle Test\" TV show on May 12. After a few more dates in the US in summer 1981, Holly and the Italians were reduced to Vincent and Sidgwick and disbanded by the end of the year.\n\nMeanwhile, the love story between Vincent and Knopfler had come to a bitter end, with him recriminating about the use of his name to foster her career. Vincent broke up with him by phone while Dire Straits were on tour. Knopfler's lyrics for Dire Straits song \"Romeo and Juliet\" are about their failed romance.\n\nVincent returned to London and was back in a studio in December 1981 to record with Joey Ramone a duet/cover version of Sonny & Cher song \"I Got You Babe\", which was released as a single in early 1982. It was recorded by Wham! producer Steve Brown and featured Thomas Dolby on synthesizers. The B-side features the song \"One More Dance\", the last appearance to date of Holly of the Italians on vinyl.\n\nIn London, she also worked on a second release to fulfill the two-album deal contract with Virgin Records. The chaos surrounding the release of \"The Right to Be Italian\", its bad critical reception and her breakup with Knopfler were experiences that affected Vincent and her writing greatly. Her second album reflects this, featuring a moodier, more introspective and alternative sound. The album, simply entitled \"Holly and the Italians\", was produced and recorded by Mike Thorne at Olympic Studios with session musicians such as Bobby Valentino, Bobby Collins, Kevin Wilkinson and John Gatchell. While still in production, Vincent performed live some new songs at a few shows in the UK with the musicians who had worked on the album. When she went in the US for the album's mixing at Media Sound Studios in New York City a short time later, the British authorities labelled her as an undesirable alien for her reckless behavior during her stay in the country, making her return impossible.\n\n\"Holly and the Italians\" was finally released in late 1982. It was poorly reviewed and largely ignored upon its release and, although the video for the single \"For What It's Worth\" gained some airtime on MTV, it was not commercially successful. Her manager Gary Kurfirst called the content of the album \"suicide music\" and terminated his contract with Vincent. In recent times, the album was critically acclaimed instead. Virgin Records did not renew her contract and she remained to live in New York City, where she tried to set up a new version of the Italians. She continued to write new songs and record them at her expense, but could not gain a new record contract.\n\nIn 1984, she was invited by Chris Butler to front the post-punk band The Waitresses after the departure of lead singer Patty Donahue; she became a member for a few weeks before the return of Donahue. In that period, she sang in a combo called the Wild Things with Anthony Thistlethwaite (The Waterboys) and Mick Taylor (The Rolling Stones), which released the song \"Siberian Mines\". She was also in a band with her brother Nick called Bikey that played only one show.\n\nWhile in New York City, she featured in the indie film \"The Dwarf\" (1984) directed by Richard Monteverde starring Ann \"Anna\" Magnuson and studied acting briefly with teacher Catherine Gaffigan.\n\nIn 1990 Vincent relocated to Los Angeles, where she started writing songs for the movie industry. In 1992 Jane Scarpantoni, a cellist who had worked with Vincent in New York, put her in contact with Amy Ray of the Indigo Girls, who asked Vincent to record a new album for her label Daemon Records. Vincent formed a band called The Oblivious, which included the Italians' original drummer Steve Dalton, and recorded with them the album \"America\", which she wrote in its entirety and produced. The album was released in September 1993 on Daemon Records and received good reviews. It was also voted for \"album of the year\" from the \"San Francisco Weekly\". The Oblivious were chosen as support band for Concrete Blonde final tour, thanks to Vincent's acquaintance with Concrete Blonde vocalist Johnette Napolitano from the late 70s, when both worked as waitresses at the same Mongolian restaurant in Sherman Oaks, California.\n\nBefore Concrete Blonde disbandment, Vincent and Napolitano teamed up for an album entitled \"Vowel Movement\" in early 1994; Vincent performed as drummer, guitarist, and shared vocal duties with Napolitano, who played bass. The two women recorded the music in six days, and renounced to mixing it. \"Vowel Movement\" was picked up by Mammoth Records and released in 1995, receiving mixed reviews.\n\nWith the help of her brother Nick, Vincent produced a collection of demos and unreleased songs titled \"Demos Federico\" spanning from 1979 to 1998. The double CD was released in 2003 by Wounded Bird Records.\n\nIn 2007, Vincent self-produced the album \"Super Rocket Star\", where she composed all the songs and played all instruments. The music of the album shows many influences, ranging from 40s pop to electronica. \"Super Rocket Star\" was distributed online through Amazon.com and in digital form on Spotify. The albums \"Minnesota-California\" (2009) and \"Bad Day Beautiful\" (2012) were distributed in a similar way.\n\nStarting in 2010, Vincent created autonomously techno and tech house music under the pseudonym Yllohas. The tracks were loaded on a now closed SoundCloud space and later collected in the album \"LAPTOPpOP TECHNOhUM\" of 2013 and \"Paperdoll Technologies\" of 2014.\n\nFrom 2013 to 2016 Vincent managed her own Bandcamp website, selling her new albums and part of her back catalog in digital format.\n\nShe has been voice artist in national commercials for Nike, Nintendo, Pepsi and Squirt.\n\nVincent uses a Squier Stratocaster guitar with a hot rail or a humbucker pickup for extra power.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2335912", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2335912", "title": "Batheaston", "text": "Batheaston\n\nBatheaston is a village and civil parish east of the English city of Bath (which is believed to be the origin of the name) and on the north bank of the River Avon. The parish has a population of 2,735. The northern area of the parish on the road to St Catherine is an area known as Northend.\n\nBatheaston has been twinned with Oudon in France since 2005.\n\nBatheaston is named \"Estone\" in the \"Domesday Book\".\n\nBatheaston was part of the hundred of Bath Forum.\n\nIn the 16th century the Lord of the Manor was John Hussey, 1st Baron Hussey of Sleaford.\n\nIn the 18th century, Sir John Riggs Miller, 1st Baronet and Anna Miller held a much-mocked fortnightly literary salon along with competitions and prizes at their house in the village. The couple there held a fortnightly literary salon along with competitions and prizes. Distinguished contributions were received from the like of David Garrick, Christopher Anstey and the poet Anna Seward.\n\nThe parish council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council’s operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The parish council's role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, such as the village hall or community centre, playing fields and playgrounds, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also of interest to the council.\n\nThe parish falls within the unitary authority of Bath and North East Somerset which was created in 1996, as established by the Local Government Act 1992. It provides a single tier of local government with responsibility for almost all local government functions within its area including local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection, recycling, cemeteries, crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism. It is also responsible for education, social services, libraries, main roads, public transport, Trading Standards, waste disposal and strategic planning, although fire, police and ambulance services are provided jointly with other authorities through the Avon Fire and Rescue Service, Avon and Somerset Constabulary and the Great Western Ambulance Service.\n\nBath and North East Somerset's area covers part of the ceremonial county of Somerset but it is administered independently of the non-metropolitan county. Its administrative headquarters are in Bath. Between 1 April 1974 and 1 April 1996, it was the Wansdyke district and the City of Bath of the county of Avon. Before 1974 that the parish was part of the Bathavon Rural District.\n\nThe parish is represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom as part of North East Somerset. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election. It is also part of the South West England constituency of the European Parliament which elects seven MEPs using the d'Hondt method of party-list proportional representation.\n\nThe village is overlooked by Solsbury Hill which is within the Cotswolds Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty and was an Iron Age hill fort occupied between 300 BC and 100 BC. It is also linked to Bathampton on the south bank of the river via a toll bridge, and also borders Bathford.\n\nThe Bybrook River which springs up near Marshfield in Gloucestershire, flows through villages such as Castle Combe and Box in Wiltshire before finally merging with the River Avon in Batheaston.\n\nThe Roman road of the Fosseway descends into Batheaston via the Bannerdown hill, before joining the London Road (A4) also a former Roman road. The hill rises to above sea level, and on the top of the hill rest the Three Shire Stones (three vertical blocks of limestone with a large cap) which mark where the historical counties of Gloucestershire, Wiltshire and Somerset meet. The stones are formed in the style of a burial chamber, there are three small dressed stones (the original stones) inside, each dated 1736 and with the initial of one of the three counties. The previous Shire stones are shown on a John Speede map dated 1610. Sometime in 1859 a Cromlech was erected over the top of the original stones which possibly were part of a burial chamber. Local newspapers and national journals of the time report that three skeletons were found in the hole along with a James II coin whilst the work was being completed. Each stone is approximately 9–12 feet in height and weighs four to five tons, with the cap being of a similar size and weight. The work at the time in 1859 was costed as £34 5s 8d, dinner to the workmen was also included.\n\nThe Northern end of the Bannerdown ridge is home to Colerne Airfield, a Second World War RAF Fighter Command and Bomber Command airfield. The hill is littered with former quarries of Bath Stone.\n\nThe £45 million A46 dual-carriageway Batheaston/Swainswick bypass opened in summer 1996. It joins the main A4 road which used to follow the Fosse Way which runs through the village. Despite the expense, the road failed to achieve its original objectives to link to the A36 either side of Bathampton and so alleviate traffic through London Road and Cleveland Bridge. It is also on the route of the Limestone Link a long-distance footpath from the Mendip Hills in Somerset to Cold Aston in the Cotswolds in Gloucestershire.\n\nThe parish church of Batheaston is the Church of St John The Baptist and the parish is joined with St Catherine. It was built in the 12th century, and remodelled in the late 15th century. The west tower which has four stages with a pierced embattled parapet, setback buttresses, projecting octagonal stairs, and a turret at the south-east corner which terminates in spirelet, was rebuilt in 1834 by John Pinch, the Younger of Bath. It has pointed perpendicular two-light windows with cusped heads and the east side has a canopied niche containing a figure, probably St John.\n\nThe Riverside studios in Batheaston have been used by several musicians to record their albums including; Mighty ReArranger by Robert Plant.\n\nBatheaston House was built in 1712 for Henry Walters (1667–1753) a wealthy clothiers who succeeded to the property of Batheaston through his grandfather, Henry Blanchard.\n\nPine House dates from 1672 having been built for Richard and Mary Panton. It was extended to the north in early 18th century.\n\nEagle House was built in the late 17th/early 18th century and then remodelled in 1724 and again in 1729 by John Wood, the Elder as his own house. The house was home to Mary Blathwayt and her family and it became an important refuge for suffragettes who had been released from prison after hunger strikes, with trees being planted to commemorate each woman — at least 47 trees were planted between April 1909 and July 1911, including Emmeline Pankhurst, Christabel Pankhurst, Charlotte Despard, Millicent Fawcett and Lady Lytton. The trees that were planted at Eagle House were removed to make way for a housing estate. Other trees have been planted to mirror the lost memorials.\n\n\n"}

In 1993 he founded the Canadian power metal band, Eidolon, with his brother Glen. He uses Sabian cymbals and Yamaha drums, Pro-mark drum sticks, Toca Percussion, Evans Drumheads and Extreme Isolation headphones.\n\nAfter ten years in Megadeth, Drover announced his departure from the band on November 25, 2014, the same day that guitarist Chris Broderick also left the band. The pair formed the extreme metal supergroup Act of Defiance together in late 2014.\n\nWhile in rehearsal for \"Blackmail The Universe Tour\" in October 2004, six days before the first show, Shawn replaced newly returned drummer Nick Menza in thrash metal band Megadeth, who was unable to prepare for the physical demands of a full US tour.\n\nShawn also has been playing guitar since 1980, which he learned from watching his brother, Glen Drover play. Shawn wrote most of the music for all 6 Eidolon records as well as all of the lyrics for all Eidolon records except \"The Parallel Otherworld\". He was playing guitar during Megadeth's \"Blackmail The Universe Tour\" in Kawasaki, Japan (April 3, 2005). Shawn and his brother Glen Drover switched instruments playing \"Paranoid\" and the second half of \"Peace Sells\". Glen sat at the drums, and Shawn played the guitar, during Gigantour show in Toronto on September 3, 2005. Shawn co-wrote the Grammy Nominated song \"Head Crusher\" from 2009's \"Endgame\", as well as \"Built for War\" from 2013's \"Super Collider\".\n\nWhile on the Gigantour in 2005, Shawn became the third Megadeth guitarist on stage during \"Peace Sells\" while Mike Portnoy previously of Dream Theater played the drums. Shawn also did one solo of the song. The night after the statements were released that Shawn's brother Glen had quit Megadeth, Shawn and Glen recommended Chris Broderick as a possible replacement. Shawn then proceeded to show Dave a video of Chris playing both classical and electric guitar. Dave was immediately won over and soon managed to get in contact with Chris. Two weeks later, Broderick was officially declared the new guitarist for Megadeth.\n\nAs opposed to many drummers, who cross over their sticks to play the hi-hat with their right hand and snare with their left hand, Shawn instead keeps time with his left hand, keeps a ride cymbal on the left side of his set, and relegates his right hand for snare drum hits (similar to Gene Hoglan and Simon Phillips). Although the role of each hand is reversed. This is known as \"Open handed drumming\". Shawn Drover is himself left-handed.\n\nAs of 2015, Shawn Drover was Megadeth's longest-serving drummer, having been a member of the band for just over 10 years, and had the third-longest tenure in the band after only bass guitarist David Ellefson and guitarist and frontman Dave Mustaine. On November 25, 2014 Drover announced his departure from Megadeth, wanting to pursue his own musical interests. Following his departure from Megadeth, Drover teamed up with Chris Broderick, who left Megadeth the same day as him, to form Act of Defiance with vocalist Henry Derek and bassist Matt Bachand.\n\nHe currently resides near {Atlanta, Georgia}, has a wife, a daughter, a son, and grandson. On May 5, the same date as his birthday, 2010, his first grandson was born.\nShawn is a huge fan of the NFL,and College Football. His favorite team is the Pittsburgh Steelers. He is also a huge NHL fan citing favorite teams such as the Montreal Canadiens, Toronto Maple Leafs, Tampa Bay Lightning, Pittsburg Penguins, and the Calgary Flames. Shawn is an avid golfer as well, and participates in several charitable golf events each year.\n\nShawn Drover endorses Yamaha Drums, Sabian, Evans Drumheads, Toca percussion, Extreme Isolation headphones and Pro-Mark Drumsticks. The \"MegaKit\" used on tours from 2004 through 2010 was manufactured by Ferguson Fabrication out of Tempe, Arizona. The structure was revised and redesigned making the cage lighter and easier to assemble. Shawn formerly from October 2006 to February 2014 endorsed the DDRUM maple kit and electronic DDRUM triggers with Sabian cymbals.\n\n\n\n\n"}

They distribute cracks (software patches), keygens (key generators), and pre-cracked versions of entire programs. Over the years, distribution methods have changed, starting out with physically transported floppy disks and BBS distribution. Today most of their files reach the public over various peer-to-peer file networks.\nParadox was originally formed in late 1989 by members of the Danish group Trilogy (Bad Boy, Black Hawk, Tas, Pcsu, QRD) and the French group M.A.D (Olivier, Stinger, The Surge, Clash, Tagada). They began by cracking Amiga software. The original group shut down voluntarily in 1991 when the most active members joined Quartex, but was later reborn under the leadership of 'Maximilien' in 1993, with ex-Quartex members Black Hawk and Paragon as co-founders. Then it moved into the Sega Genesis and SNES console scenes. They started cracking PC software in 1994. At the end of 2000, they cracked PlayStation game \"\", notable for the stringent anti-piracy measures programmed by Insomniac Games. Due to the extensive measures, the game's protection was initially not fully defeated, resulting in certain deliberately-programmed \"glitches\" to appear; Paradox released a fixed, working version for both NTSC and PAL versions two months later. In 2001, they released their last cracked game for PlayStation, and it was the popular video game \"Final Fantasy IX\". In 2002, the team recruited computer black hat Evilgood, who is alleged to be one of the most qualified crackers of the time. His identity is still unknown. They have cracked games for other consoles and hand-held devices like the PlayStation, PlayStation 2, PlayStation Portable, Dreamcast, Nintendo 64, Nintendo GameCube, Wii, and Xbox.\n\nParadox has been noted to crack challenging dongle protections on many debugging and software development programs. The team also successfully found a method of bypassing activation in Windows Vista.

It replaces and expands upon an earlier rulebook entitled \"Sword and Fist\".\n\n\"Complete Warrior\" presents additional rules and advice for the creation and use of character classes which specialize in melee and ranged combat. It also provides a catchall for anything that doesn't fit into \"Complete Adventurer\", \"Complete Divine\", \"Complete Arcane\", or \"Complete Psionic\".\n\nThe Hexblade mixes martial prowess with a unique curse ability, the ability to cast arcane spells and good resistance against spells and spell effects. Similar in concept to the sorcerer, the Hexblade is an individual who possesses unnatural jinxes or an evil eye, and uses it towards combat. With a d10 for hit points, a 1/1 base attack bonus advancement, and a very slow spell advancement, the hexblade is more like an arcane ranger or paladin than a bard.\n\nThe Samurai is a brave and noble warrior, possessing martial prowess and unique abilities to intimidate and terrify his opponents. Like the other classes, the Samurai has a d10 for hit points and a 1/1 base attack bonus advancement. The main drawback to playing a Samurai is the restrictions placed on the class. A Samurai cannot multiclass, then resume being a Samurai, some of his class abilities require him to use specific weaponry, and he is bound by the code of Bushido, which operates in a similar manner to the Paladin's code.\n\nThe Swashbuckler is a fighter that emphasizes finesse, style and flair, combining martial prowess with amazing acrobatics to outmaneuver opponents. With a d10 for hit points and a 1/1 base attack bonus advancement, the swashbuckler is an effective frontline fighter, and while the inability to wear medium or heavy armours makes the character vulnerable to counterattacks, some of the class features compensate. The ability to deal strength (weakness critical class feature) and constitution damage (wounding critical class feature), as well as the ability to charge in difficult terrains (acrobatic charge class feature) makes the swashbuckler a formidable opponent in any battle.\n\n\"Complete Warrior\" was written by Andy Collins, David Noonan, and Ed Stark, and was published in November 2003.

That's often the fighter, of course, but there's something in \"Complete Warrior\" for the polymorphed wizard, the wild-shaped druid, and any number of archetypes who don't trundle around in heavy armor heaving a big battleaxe.\"\n\n"}

{"id": "2335981", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2335981", "title": "Rehearsal", "text": "Rehearsal\n\nA rehearsal is an activity in the performing arts that occurs as preparation for a performance in music, theatre, dance and related arts, such as opera, musical theatre and film production. It is undertaken as a form of practising, to ensure that all details of the subsequent performance are adequately prepared and coordinated. The term \"rehearsal\" typically refers to ensemble activities undertaken by a group of people. For example, when a musician is preparing a piano concerto in their music studio, this is called \"practicing\", but when they practice the concerto with an orchestra, this is called a \"rehearsal\". The music rehearsal takes place in a music rehearsal space.\n\nA rehearsal may involve as few as two people, as with a small play for two actors, an art song by a singer and pianist or a folk duo of a singer and guitarist. On the other end of the spectrum, a rehearsal can be held for a very large orchestra with over 100 performers and a choir. A rehearsal can involve only performers of one type, as in an a cappella choir show, in which a group of singers perform without instrumental accompaniment or a play involving only theatre actors; it can involve performers of different instruments, as with an orchestra, rock band or jazz \"big band\"; vocal and instrumental performers, as with opera and choral works accompanied by orchestra; or a mix of actors, vocalists, instrumentalists and dancers, as with musical theatre.\n\nRehearsals of small groups, such as small rock bands, jazz quartets or organ trios may be held without a leader; in these cases, the performers jointly determine how to run the rehearsal, which songs to practice, and so on. Some small groups may have their rehearsals led by a bandleader. Almost all mid- to large-group performances have a person who leads the rehearsals; this person may be a bandleader in a rock, country, or jazz setting; conductor in classical music (including opera); director in theatre or musical theatre; or film director for movies.\n\nWhile the term is most commonly used in the performing arts to refer to preparation for a public presentation, the term is also used to refer to the preparation for other anticipated activities, such as wedding guests and couples practicing a wedding ceremony, paramedics practicing responding to a simulated emergency, or troops practicing for an attack using a mock-up of the building.\n\nThe dress rehearsal is a full-scale rehearsal where the actors and/or musicians perform every detail of the performance. For a theatrical performance, cast members wear their costumes. The actors may use props and backdrops; they do not use scripts, although the stage manager and director might. \n\nFor a musical performance, the dress rehearsal does not require wearing formal concert outfits (e.g., tuxedos and gowns). In music, the dress rehearsal is the final rehearsal before the performance; while initial rehearsals will often involve working on challenging sections of the piece or pieces, during the dress rehearsal, the piece or pieces are typically played in their entirety.\n\nIn theatre, a performing arts ensemble rehearses a work in preparation for performance before an audience. Rehearsals that occur early in the production process are sometimes referred to as \"run-throughs\". Typically a run-through does not involve most of the technical aspects of a performance, such as costumes, lights, and sound, and is primarily used to assist performers in learning dialogue or music and to solidify aspects of blocking, choreography, and stage movement.\n\nA \"cue to cue\" or \"Q-2-Q\" is a type of technical rehearsal and is intended primarily for the lighting and audio technicians involved in a performance, although they are of great value to the entire ensemble. It is intended to allow the technicians and stage manager to rehearse the technical aspects of a performance—when lights have to be turned on, sound effects triggered, and items rolled on and off the stage—and identify and resolve any glitches that might arise. Performers do not typically rehearse entire scenes during Q-2-Q's, but instead only perform dialogue or actions that are used by the stage manager as a marker for when to initiate technical sequences or cues (hence the title). Abbreviated Q-2-Q's in which only the opening and closing sequences of each act or scene are performed is sometimes referred to as \"tops and tails\". It is rare for any but the most technically complex performances to have Q-2-Q rehearsals outside of technical week.\n\nCue to cues are often preceded by a \"dry tech\", in which the technicians rehearse their technical cues (e.g., turning on stage lights or triggering sound effects or recorded music) without the actual performers present at the rehearsal. A \"dress rehearsal\" is a rehearsal or series of rehearsals in which the ensemble dresses in costume, as they will dress at the performance for the audience. The entire performance will be run from beginning to end, exactly as the real performances will be, including pauses for intermissions. An \"open dress\" is a dress rehearsal to which specific individuals have been invited to attend as audience members. They may include patrons (who pay a reduced ticket price), family and friends of the ensemble, or reviewers from the media. The dress rehearsal is often the last set of rehearsals before the concert performance and falls at the end of technical week. A \"preview\", although technically a performance as there is a full audience, including individuals who have paid for admission, is arguably also a rehearsal in as far as it is not uncommon in complex performances for the production to stop, or even return to an earlier point in the performance if there are unavoidable or unresolvable problems. Audience members typically pay a lower price to attend a preview performance.\n\nIn traditional Japanese Noh theatre, performers primarily rehearse separately, only rehearsing together once, a few days before the show. This is to emphasize the transience of the show, in the philosophy of \"ichi-go ichi-e\", \"one chance, one meeting\".\n\nA professional orchestra, choir or chamber ensemble (e.g., string quartet or wind quintet) rehearses a piece (or song) in order to coordinate the rhythmic ensemble, ensure that the intonation of pitches of the different sections matches exactly, and coordinate the dynamics (changes in loudness and softness) and phrasing. A professional ensemble will typically only rehearse an orchestral work for two or three rehearsals which are held several days before the first performance. A professional ensemble is much less likely than an amateur orchestra to play the piece all the way through in the first rehearsals. Instead, a professional ensemble will typically review passages which pose challenges from the point of view of rhythmic or harmonic coordination. An example of a passage that might pose rhythmic coordination challenges would be a contemporary work which involves polyrhythms, in which one section of the orchestra plays a rhythm in 4/4 while another plays a melody in 5/4. An example of harmonic challenges would be a work in which the orchestra has to perform dissonant, complex harmonies, such as bitonality; an example would be the string section playing in C major while the brass section plays in F# major.\n\nThe conductor leads orchestral rehearsals. He calls out bar numbers or rehearsal letters to direct the orchestra to sections which he would like to perform. While classical conductors do not typically speak to direct the orchestra during concerts, during rehearsals, the conductor speaks to communicate his artistic vision for the piece and explain the \"articulation\" (note lengths), tone colors, and tempos he would like to use. During initial rehearsals, the conductor frequently stops the rehearsal to ask players or sections to change the way they are playing or provide guidance to the orchestra. For a choir, the choral conductor will lead rehearsals. In cases where a choir is preparing a piece which will be sung with an orchestra, the initial rehearsals may be led by the choir's conductor and the rehearsals closer to the concert by the orchestra's conductor.\n\nFor works that present a particular challenge for certain sections (e.g., a complex, exposed passage for the violas), orchestras may have sectional rehearsals or sectionals in which a section rehearses on their own under the direction of the principal player or, in some cases, also with the conductor (e.g., in the case of a very rhythmically challenging piece).\n\nPrior to rehearsing a concerto with an orchestra, a soloist will rehearse it with a pianist substituting for the parts played by the orchestra (thus, two pianists in the case of piano concerti or a violinist and pianist in preparation for a violin concerto). To help with tempo in orchestral, solo, or chamber rehearsals, a metronome may be used to sound out the tempo prior to the commencement of a piece. For musical performances, a dress rehearsal does not imply dressing in concert dress. It is a final rehearsal before performance where generally the ensemble will run through the program as if there were an audience. In some orchestras, there may be a limited audience during the dress rehearsal (typically university music students or other invited guests).\n\nAmateur orchestras or chamber ensembles, such as university or community groups rehearse music for a number of reasons. While an amateur ensemble does rehearsals for many of the same reasons as a professional ensemble—to coordinate the rhythmic ensemble and intonation—with an amateur group the conductor has to do much more teaching to the orchestra. However, amateur musicians are much more likely to make note mistakes, transposition errors or play with incorrect intonation or rhythms; the conductor must point these issues out to the performers and give them advice on how to correct them. In amateur groups, players may not have strong ensemble skills, so the conductor may have to coach players about how to learn to blend their sound well with other sections or how to coordinate rhythmic passages that are played by different sections, or how to mark their part after they make an error to prevent the error from being repeated.\n\nRehearsals are also used to teach ensemble members about music history and basic performance practice, so that they can learn the different playing styles and tones used in music from different eras. As well, orchestra conductors select pieces so that players can learn new skills, such as more complicated rhythms. For an amateur ensemble, the rehearsals are used to give the players an opportunity to have repeated chances to learn to perform difficult passages in an ensemble context. Amateur choirs use rehearsals to build choral singing skills, such as singing with a good ensemble and with solid intonation and vocal tone. Amateur groups are much more likely than professional groups to hold sectional rehearsals. Another difference between rehearsals in an amateur orchestra and a professional orchestra is the number of rehearsals. A community orchestra or university ensemble may have ten or even fifteen rehearsals over several months to prepare a major symphony; a professional orchestra might prepare that same symphony in two rehearsals over two days.\n\nIn an amateur performance consisting of miscellaneous items, such as songs, theatrical performances, skits, and musical pieces, it is common to have \"a walk through rehearsal\" on the concert day. This \"walk through\" requires the musicians, singers and actors to walk on and off stage without actually performing their full pieces. Each soloist or ensemble has had a number of previous rehearsals to work on their specific song or piece. The \"walk through\" helps performers to remember which performers need to go on stage together (e.g., a jazz singer needs to go onstage with her piano accompanist and bass player), what materials or items are required (e.g., a string quartet will require four chairs and four music stands, in addition to their instruments), and which lighting or sound reinforcement system elements are required. For example, a comedian may want a dark stage with just a spotlight, whereas a choir may wish to have the entire stage lit.\n\nPop, rock, country and blues bands rehearse before performances. Rehearsals assemble the elements of a musical event, offering an experimental space where sounds and rhythms are put together and taken apart, played with, argued over, and refined. In these styles of music, rehearsals may be less formal than in a Classical orchestra context. However, the purpose of rehearsals is the same: to ensure that all the band members can play and/or sing their parts with a good rhythmic ensemble, correct intonation, and the right \"feel\" and style. As with Classical rehearsals, the earlier rehearsals for a show often focus more on working out the most difficult sections of songs, such as transitions from one tempo to another tempo, modulations to a new key, or coordinating a duet between two solo instruments. The rehearsals closer to the performance are more likely to involve run-throughs of entire songs. Whereas Classical rehearsals are led by the conductor or choir leader, popular music band rehearsals are typically led by the bandleader, who is typically a member of the band. The bandleader sets the tempos for songs, chooses which instruments will have solos, and cues the start of new sections of a song.\n\nThe bandleader also typically chooses the members of the rhythm section: the instruments that provide the beat and the chord progression for songs. The rhythm section varies somewhat between genres, but in general it includes chordal instruments (e.g., piano, guitar, Hammond organ), a bass instrument (e.g., electric bass or double bass) and drum kit and/or percussion instruments.\n\nFor major touring bands that have a large stage show, with lights, pyrotechnics, massive moving props, and so on, there may be numerous rehearsals for the technical elements, in addition to the purely musical rehearsals held by the band.\n\nWhen a pop or rock group is accompanied in a concert by an orchestra, a conductor is often used to lead the orchestra. In some pop or rock concerts where a large ensemble is performing, such as a group involving multiple guitar players, multiple percussionists, and the regular rhythm section, a conductor may also be used to lead the ensemble. For these types of shows, the conductor and the bandleader coordinate the rehearsals together.\n\nThe use of rehearsals and dress rehearsals extends beyond the performing arts. When an organization has to learn how to implement a new process, it may rehearse the activity beforehand. Emergency-planning organizations often rehearse their preparations for responding to civil disasters; in some cases, there may even be actors playing the role of \"injured people\", so that emergency workers can learn how to provide assistance. Armies that are planning an attack on a certain target may create a mock-up of the target and rehearse the attack. The Israeli Defence Force used this approach in planning for the Raid on Entebbe, which freed air hijacking hostages. An accurate model of the airport building where the hostages were being held by gunmen was recreated so that the commandos could practice their attack maneuvers.\n\nThe introduction of major changes to complex industrial and technical fields, such as information systems is often rehearsed, particularly where this requires multiple activities to be coordinated and completed within time constraints. Many companies undertook major initiatives with their computer staff to rehearse the changes associated with the Year 2000 problem and the economic and monetary union of the European Union.\n\n"}

It also provides a catchall for anything that doesn't fit into \"Complete Arcane\", \"Complete Divine\", \"Complete Warrior\", or \"Complete Psionic\". It presents additional base classes, prestige classes, and feats.\n\n\"Complete Adventurer\" introduces three new character classes to \"D&D\" 3.5. These classes are strongly related to the rogue class, and are highly skill based. The classes added are Ninja, Scout and Spellthief.\n\nThe ninja class represents the standard image of a stealthy fighter. A ninja can come unseen, attack quickly but furiously, then leave unseen. The ninja excels at quick, powerful attacks but lacks the combat stamina of other classes such as monks and fighters.\n\nA scout is a bit like a rogue of the wilderness. The scout is an expert at tracking, scouting enemy positions, and finding their way through familiar and unfamiliar landscapes. A scout has a mix of rogue and ranger traits, as well as some unique to them.\n\nThe spellthief has the ability to make a rogue's sneak attack, but instead of inflicting damage, can steal a spell from their opponent. That is, the victim can no longer cast their memorized spell for that day, while the spellthief can cast it - just as it was memorized. At higher levels the spellthief can even steal spell-like abilities from monsters.\n\n\"Complete Adventurer\" introduces a number of prestige classes which are primarily suited for rogues, bards, and the new classes introduced in the book. In addition there are a few other prestige classes which don't seem to fit the theme, but appear here because they did not fit in any of the other books in the Complete series.\n\nThe prestige classes include the Animal Lord, Beastmaster, Exemplar, Ollam, Dungeon Delver, Daggerspell Mage, Daggerspell Shaper, Nightsong Enforcer, Nightsong Infiltraitor, Fochlucan lyrist, maester (a magic item crafter), tempest, wild plains outrider, bloodhound and vigilante.\n\nThe book details a number of new uses for skills, since its focus is on skill based characters. The book details new ways to use skills, as well as how to extend skills, use skills untrained that you normally couldn't, or make a skill roll harder for more reward.\n\n\"Complete Adventurer\" also details a large number of new feats. Many of these feats are appropriate for bards and rogues. There are also a number of feats which were created to support Spellthieves, Scouts, and Ninjas. Finally, there are a few miscellaneous feats, which round out the book.\n\n\"Complete Adventurer\" also adds a large number tools equipment. This focuses on special types of items which would be particularly interesting to the skill based character classes such as alchemical items which focus on increasing skills for a few rounds.\n\nThe final section of the book looks at organizations, a subject that has not appeared much in any 3rd or 3.5 book. Organizations are covered in much greater detail in \"Player's Handbook II\".\n\n\"Complete Adventurer\" was written by Jesse Decker and published in January 2005. Cover art is by Matt Cavotta, with interior art by Steve Belledin, Mitch Cotie, Ed Cox, Steve Ellis, Wayne England, David Hudnut, Jeremy Jarvis, Doug Kovacs, Chuck Lukacs, Jeff Miracola, Monte Moore, William O'Connor, Michael Phillippi, Ron Spencer, and Franz Vohwinkel.\n\nJesse Decker explained his approach to the book: \"I really like to start writing on Day One of a project, so I always do outlining before my official design time begins. I started writing an outline for \"Complete Adventurer\" about three weeks before I actually began writing. With \"Complete Adventurer\", I built the outline based on the structures of earlier \"Complete\" books and the assignment from the design manager that was something like: Create three base classes, a fair number of prestige classes, and 'do a lot with skills.'\"\n\n"}

The earliest mention of the term appears to have been in the March 8, 2002 issue of the newspaper \"Public Opinion\" (Chambersburg, PA), which said this was occurring \"in some communities\". The pharm party story has since spread to periodicals and television stations throughout the United States, including reputable, mainstream sources such as \"Time\" and the \"Washington Post\".\n\nPractices similar to the pharm party phenomenon have been described in media as far back as the 1960s. An event, called a \"fruit salad party,\" was first described in the March 30, 1966 edition of \"The Sun\" in Lowell, Massachusetts. The story provided that several teenagers each brought three pills to a party in Medford, Massachusetts and that, after mixing the pills together in a bowl and selecting three at random, most of the group had to be hospitalized and one remained in a coma. The article did not provide the names of any of the teenagers and said only that the incident occurred \"several months ago.\"\n\n\"Fruit salad parties\" were subsequently described in the \"Tucson Daily Citizen\" in 1969 and the \"American School Board Journal\". The source for both articles was a registered nurse who had no practical experience with these parties but had heard about them from drug lecturers, law enforcement officials and prosecutors \"throughout the United States.\" Reports on fruit salad parties continued into the early 1970s, appearing in the \"Charleston Daily Mail\", Ohio's \"Coshocton Tribune\", the \"Billings Gazette\" and Hayward, California's \"Daily Review\", before ultimately petering out. The \"Daily Mail\" took a more literal approach to the rumors, describing the pills as being hidden inside fruit which students mixed into actual fruit salads.\n\nIn the first decade of the 21st century, news outlets began picking up the story anew, this time referring to them as \"pharm parties\" or \"pharming parties.\" As with the earlier spate of reports, sources of information were indirect, statistics were absent or misleading and no specific incidents could be identified. Nonetheless, in 2005 and 2006, articles were written on the subject in South Florida's \"Sun-Sentinel\", the \"Toronto Star\", \"USA Today\" and the \"Washington Post\" and episodes of the television series \"\" and \"Boston Legal\" were centered around it. In 2007, the \"Baltimore Jewish Times\" even ran an article on \"fruit salad parties.\"\n\nIn June 2006, \"Slate\" editor Jack Shafer investigated reports of \"pharming parties\" and concluded that there was little evidence indicating that such a phenomenon is popular, growing, or even real. Shafer wrote, \"If pharm parties are a trend, they're the best-hidden and least-talked about one in the country.\" He noted that \"It goes without saying that pharm parties may be very real and very everywhere. It's a big country. But it looks to me like pharm party is just a new label the drug-abuse industrial complex has adopted to describe the decades-old tradition of pill parties.\"\n\nAlthough studies show that as many as one in five teenagers have abused prescription medications, it is not clear whether parties specifically organized to exchange drugs contribute to this abuse. In March 2008, Shafer wrote, \"I've failed to locate a single human source or article that documents a single such festivity, let alone proves that they're commonplace, as the media would have you believe.\" As of September 2010, Shafer has written eight columns\nfor \"Slate\" discussing and debunking pharm parties.\n\n\n"}

His mother was Alice J. Vincent and father was Charles A. Litton. As a boy he experimented with radio technology at his parents' house in Redwood City, California.\n\nLitton learned machining in the California School of Mechanical Arts of San Francisco, and then attended Stanford University, where he graduated with an A.B. in mechanical engineering in 1924 and electrical engineering in 1925.\nIn the 1920s, he experimented with new techniques and materials for building vacuum tubes. For example, he built the first practical glass blowing lathe. He worked for Bell Telephone Laboratories in 1925 through 1927, and moved back to California in 1927.\n\nThe Bay area was an early center of ham radio with about 10% of the operators in the US. William Eitel, Jack McCullough, and Litton, who together pioneered vacuum tube manufacturing in the Bay area, were hobbyists with training in technology who participated in development of shortwave radio by the ham radio hobby. High frequency, and especially, Very high frequency, VHF, transmission in the 10 meter band, required higher quality power tubes than were manufactured by the consortium of RCA, Western Electric, General Electric, Westinghouse, which controlled vacuum tube manufacturing. Litton pioneered manufacturing techniques which resulted in award of wartime contracts to manufacture transmitting tubes for Radar to Eitel-McCullough, a San Bruno firm, which manufactured power-grid tubes for radio amateurs and aircraft radio equipment.\n\nHe went to work for the Federal Telegraph Company, and headed tube engineering there. Cecil Howard Green (later the founder of Texas Instruments) worked for Litton during that time. During the Great Depression, Federal was acquired and moved its facilities to New Jersey. Litton stayed in California.\n\nIn 1932, he founded Litton Engineering Laboratories with his savings, and continued to experiment in the shop on his parents' Redwood City property. He held 65 patents on various high-tech innovations. Some of these patents resulted in notable litigation. At Frederick Terman's request, Litton helped Stanford build a tube research lab, and recruit David Packard.\nDuring World War II, Litton participated in the design and production of microwave tubes used in communications and radar equipment. In 1941 he formed a partnership called Industrial and Commercial Electronics with Philip Scofield and Ralph Shermund. He was awarded the Presidential Certificate of Merit for work he performed on behalf of the National Defense Resource Committee. Russell and Sigurd Varian used Litton klystron tube-making equipment in their family firm, Varian Associates. Another firm (later called Eimac) founded by fellow amateur radio operators William Eitel and Jack McCullough used Litton technology.\nAfter the war, Litton Industries was incorporated in 1947 to manufacture vacuum tubes and the machinery used to produce them. The company grew rapidly, soon rivaling established electronics firms in the east. On August 3, 1952, Litton split off the glass lathe products, which became the sole proprietorship Litton Engineering Laboratories on May 1, 1953. On November 4, 1953, he sold the vacuum tube manufacturing portion of the company to Electro Dynamics Corporation, which had been founded by Charles Bates \"Tex\" Thornton. In 1954, Electro Dynamics bought the rights to the name Litton Industries. It grew to a multi-national conglomerate. Also in 1954, Litton moved the machinery manufacturing division into a new facility in Grass Valley, California. Litton convinced friend Dr. Donald Hare to move to Grass Valley, and Hare's company became the Grass Valley Group.\n\nHe died in November 1972 in Carson City, Nevada. His papers are in the collection of The Bancroft Library. His sons Charles Jr. and Larry carried on the business of producing glassworking lathes under the \"Litton Engineering Laboratories\" name in Grass Valley. He also had five grand children.\n\n"}

Dahlgren, is located in Dahlgren, Virginia, with a geographically separated command, \"Naval Surface Warfare Center Dahlgren Division Dam Neck\" Activity (NSWCDDDNA), located in Virginia Beach, VA, in close proximity to the largest fleet concentration area in the Navy. NSWCDD is part of the Naval Surface Warfare Centers under the Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA). The NSWCDD was initially established 16 October 1918 as a remote extension of Maryland's Indian Head Proving Ground used for testing naval guns. The Dahlgren site was named the Lower Station, Dahlgren Naval Proving Ground when it first opened. The location on the Potomac River was specifically chosen for the development of a long ballistic test range on the Potomac River, required for the testing of modern, high-powered munitions.\n\nThe NSWCDD employs approximately 5,700 scientists & engineers at the Dalhgren organization and more than 350 at CDSADN. Prior to 2007, Panama City Coastal Systems Station located at the Naval Support Activity Panama City was part of Dahlgren Division, but in 2008, it became its own division within the NAVSEA Naval Surface Warfare Center structure.\n\nThe physical base where NSWCDD is located became officially known as the Naval Support Activity South Potomac (NSASP) in 2003 and the NSWCDD became a tenant. The name \"NSWCDD\" or \"NSWC\" is still commonly used to refer to the base. The base commander function, however, is no longer a secondary function of the Commander of the NSWCDD. There are a few other major tenant commands on the base such as the Joint Warfare Analysis Center and the Aegis Training and Readiness Center (ATRC) involved in the training and development for the Aegis Combat System, and training and development for other future shipboard combat systems.\n\nNSASP was previously home to Naval Space Surveillance System Command (NAVSPASUR) before that function was transferred to the Air Force in 2004.\n\nThe base is recognized by the Census Bureau as a census designated place (CDP), Dahlgren Center. Its population as of the 2010 Census was 599. It is entirely distinct from Dahlgren CDP, to the west.\n\nDahlgren was established in the spring of 1918 as a Naval Proving Ground. Its recorded first work, the firing of a /45 caliber tractor-mounted gun, occurred on 16 October 1918, which is recognized as the official founding date. The proving ground was named Dahlgren in honor of Rear Admiral John Adolphus Dahlgren, a Civil War Navy commander, who is the acknowledged \"father of modern naval ordnance.\"\n\nPrior to 1918, the Navy operated a proving ground at Indian Head, Maryland, but it became inadequate as advances in gun designs and ordnance made its range obsolete. During World War I, a range of was sought by the Navy to prove its new battleship guns. The range was required to be over water but inside the territorial waters of the United States. The area from Machodoc Creek to Point Lookout on the Potomac River was selected because of its relative straight lines and accessibility. The climate and relative calm of the river were also factors as the Navy sought an ice and rapids free testing area.\nAt the time of Dahlgren's establishment, the area was extremely remote and relatively unpopulated. Thus, to recruit and retain the highly specialized work force required, the Navy promised to supply housing, food and medical services, schools, recreation, and other socially needed infrastructure.\n\nIn the 1920s and 1930s, Dahlgren was involved in testing bombsights, including the Norden bombsight, for the Navy's fledgling air forces. But, until World War II, much of the principal work at Dahlgren surrounded the proofing and testing of every major gun in the Navy's arsenal. Most of the work was done at the Main Range Gun Line, which faces down the Potomac River.\n\nDuring the World War II years, Dahlgren became involved with new computational devices (computers) because of its ordnance requirements. Ground-breaking early computers were sent to Dahlgren to help with ballistic work and other directives, including the Aiken Relay Calculator and the Naval Ordnance Research Calculator (NORC). The computer and ordnance work going on attracted a number of brilliant young scientists and engineers to the area during the war, and some were tapped to help with the ongoing Manhattan Project and the development of the atomic bomb. Two such people include Dr. Norris E. Bradbury, who later became the Director of the Los Alamos National Laboratory, and Deak Parsons, the weaponeer on the Enola Gay, the aircraft which dropped the Little Boy atomic bomb on Hiroshima, Japan in 1945.\n\nIn the years immediately after the war, Dahlgren's work force was cut back. But the laboratory's strong computer and ordnance expertise kept the base open and Navy work flowing. Subsequently, the onset of the Cold War and Korea again placed demands for new offensive and defensive ship systems. In 1958, with the former Soviet Union's launching of Sputnik I, a space race began. Dahlgren opened its gates that year to its first tenant activity, the Naval Space Surveillance Center, which selected Dahlgren to be at the center of the laboratory's growing computer advances. It was around this time that Dahlgren became heavily involved with the development of Fleet Ballistic Missiles, later called Submarine-Launched Ballistic Missiles. \n\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, Dahlgren was on the leading edge of naval surface weapons work with programs such as the Tomahawk missile, which improved the Navy's capacity to perform attacks on land targets from a distance that decreased the risk to ships. Dahlgren also was critical in work to protect Navy ships from enemy missile and air attacks with programs such as the Standard missile and the Aegis Combat System]. That work continues in 2017, along with the electromagnetic railgun, DDG 1000, Littoral Combat Ship (LCS), and Chemical Biological and Radiological Defense.\n\nBecause of the laboratory's broad-based growth in research and development and with its new missions, Dahlgren's name officially changed to the Naval Weapons Laboratory in 1959. It was later changed to the Naval Surface Weapons Center in 1974 with the merger of the former Naval Ordnance Laboratory at White Oak, Maryland. In 1987, the name was changed again to the Naval Surface Warfare Center as new and expanded missions were added. And, in 1992, with the consolidations of naval laboratories into one headquarters center, it became the Dahlgren Division of the Naval Surface Warfare Center.\n\nNSWCDD conducts basic research in all systems-related areas and pursues scientific disciplines including biotechnology, chemistry, mathematics, laser and computer technology, chemical, mechanical, electrical and systems engineering, physics and computer science. Distinguished figures who have worked for the NSWCDD include physicists Albert Einstein, Edward Teller, Carl Norden, and computer pioneers Howard Aiken and Grace Hopper.\n\nEngineering projects of historical or military significance developed at NSWCDD include the triggering device on the Hiroshima atomic bomb, the Norden Bombsight used on most American bombers such as the B-17 Flying Fortress, B-24 Liberator and B-29 Superfortress during World War II, the Standard missile used on modern United States Navy warships, and the warhead for the AIM-54 Phoenix. Current projects include the majority of US research into directed-energy weapons, railgun technology and weapons integration for the Littoral combat ship.\n\nNSWCDD scientists and engineers share their technological expertise by participating in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) activities to inspire students to pursue technical careers. NSWCDD mentors support summer academies, such as the Virginia Demonstration Project, where they introduce robotics and basic engineering principles to area middle and high school students through hands-on activities. NSWCDD also has educational partnerships with several universities across the U.S.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2336006", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2336006", "title": "Richmond Public Schools", "text": "Richmond Public Schools\n\nRichmond Public Schools is a school district located in the independent city of Richmond, Virginia. It is occasionally described locally as Richmond City Public Schools to emphasize its connection to the independent city rather than the Richmond-Petersburg region at large or the rural Richmond County, Virginia which is located in the state's Northern Neck region considerably northeast of the city. The school district is currently governed by an elected school board, with one member from each of nine districts. The current superintendent is Jason Kamras.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRichmond did not have public schools during much of the 19th century, only private institutions funded by user fees or charities. From 1906 until 1962, the city of Richmond segregated its public schools by race, and schools serving African American Virginians received less funding and poorer facilities, which led in part to the U.S. Supreme Court's two decisions in \"Brown v. Board of Education\" in beginning in 1954. Defiance of those decisions by the Commonwealth of Virginia led to the Massive Resistance crisis in the state which lasted more than a decade. One of the people involved in eventual peaceful desegregation of Richmond's public schools was Elinor Parker Sheppard, who began her public involvement with the Parent-Teacher Association of her children's school in the Ginter Park neighborhood. In 1954, \"Mrs. Sheppard\" became the first woman elected to the Richmond City Council, and she became the city's first female mayor in 1962, and served in the Virginia General Assembly for a decade. The Richmond School Board acknowledged the crisis in part by naming an elementary school to honor her and one of the school district's first principals of African American descent, Overby-Sheppard Elementary School.\n\nThe Richmond School district partly resolved the Massive Resistance crisis in its jurisdiction by eliminating racial terminology from this school district's official reports in 1962. Another important person in resolving the crisis was Virginia native and Richmond lawyer Lewis F. Powell, Jr., who served as Chairman of the Richmond School Board from 1952 until 1961. Powell did not take any part in his law firm's representation of Prince Edward County, Virginia in \"Davis v. County School Board of Prince Edward County\", which became one of the five cases decided under the caption \"Brown v. Board of Education\" in 1954. The Richmond School Board also lacked authority at the time to force integration, since beginning in 1958, the state government assumed control over attendance policies. Powell later became president of the American Bar Association and an associate justice of the Supreme Court of the United States.\nIn October 2009, the Richmond \"Times Dispatch\" printed an editorial entitled \"Dropping In,\" briefly outlining a program meant to reduce the number of high school dropouts in Richmond's public school system. In this article it was revealed that Richmond's dropout rate was \"hovering around 15 percent\". It was also stated on the Richmond Public Schools' website that the four-year-cohort dropout rate was 14.8 percent for the 2005-2009 cohort, declined from its 16.2 percent rate for 2004-2008.\n\nWhile the percentage is declining, dropout and late graduation rates are still an issue. In October 2009 in a News Release about Richmond Public Schools, it is stated that \"the latest data for students in the 2005-2009 cohort indicate that nearly 69 percent (68.7) of Richmond's students graduated on time.\" This is an increase from the 2004-2008 cohort rate of 65.8 percent and it is well below the state average of 83.2 percent.\n\nWhile high dropout rates in the school system are a problem, positive action is being taken, as of 2009. On October 21, 2009, the superintendent of Richmond City Public Schools, Yvonne W. Brandon, unveiled a plan called \"Dropout Prevention Initiative\" (DPI). The objective of this program is to continue to decrease the school system's dropout rate.\n\nThere are a few objectives to the DPI. The first is to find high school dropouts and convince them to return to high school to graduate through mentoring programs, Individual Learning Plans (ILP), and partnerships with others in the community. These \"others\" include higher education institutions, elected officials, as well faith-based and community-based organizations. One of the most appealing aspects of the DPI is that it requires no additional funding and is solely a redistribution of resources.\n\nThere is a district-wide mentoring program as a part of DPI that encourages Richmond Public Schools employees and students to serve as mentors once the recovered students return to school. There are also mentors provided by the higher educational institutions and the faith- and community-based organizations with which the DPI has partnerships.\n\nA unique aspect of this program is that recovery specialists within the DPI literally walk door-to-door to the homes of students who have dropped out to talk with them about and encourage the possibility of returning to school. Once the student does return to school, he/she will be assisted by the DPI Intake Counselors, who work with recovered students to help the student re-adjust to being in school. Upon his/her return, the student will also receive an ILP. The ILP is, as stated by the Richmond Public Schools website, \"an online educational plan for students that helps pair students' career goals with academic and career and technical courses needed to accomplish their future interests\".\n\nThe program also recognizes at-risk students and works on preventing student dropouts, rather than only trying to reverse it. Richmond Public Schools have implemented \"Extensive Mandatory Professional Development\" for staff on how to effectively identify and help at-risk students. There is also a new \"Get In – Stay in\" media campaign on the radio and television to help encourage attendance among students.\n\n\n"}

Perhaps best known for his work in the plays of Brian Friel, he had a long and varied career in film, on television and in the theatre. His travels – he lived in Ireland, the UK and the US at various times – led to him describing himself as \"\" ... an itinerant Irish actor ...\"\".\n\nDonal Donnelly was born to Irish parents in Bradford, Yorkshire, England. His father James was a doctor from County Tyrone, and his mother Nora O'Connor was a teacher from County Kerry.\n\nHe was raised in Dublin where he attended school at Synge Street Christian Brothers School in Dublin where he acted in school plays with Milo O'Shea, Eamonn Andrews, Jack McGowran, Bernard Frawley (Seattle Repertory Co.) and Jimmy Fitzsimons (brother of Maureen O'Hara), under the direction of famous elocution teacher, Ena Burke.\n\nDonnelly toured with Anew McMaster's Irish repertory company before moving to England where he starred with Rita Tushingham in the film \"The Knack …and How to Get It\".\n\nHis breakthrough role came when he was cast as Gar Private in the world premiere of Brian Friel's \"Philadelphia, Here I Come!\" directed by Hilton Edwards for the Gate Theatre at the Dublin Theatre Festival in 1964. The production subsequently transferred to Broadway where it played for over 300 performances and established Donnelly and Patrick Bedford – who played his alter-ego Gar Public – as formidable new talents to be reckoned with. They were jointly nominated for the Tony Award for Best Performance by a Leading Actor in a Play in 1966.\n\nDonnelly returned to Broadway a number of times, replacing Albert Finney in \"A Day in the Death of Joe Egg\" in 1968, playing Milo Tindle in Anthony Shaffer's \"Sleuth\" and appearing as Frederick Treves opposite David Bowie as \"The Elephant Man\". He also renewed his relationship with Brian Friel, appearing in the world premieres of \"Volunteers\" at the Abbey Theatre in 1975 and \"Faith Healer\" with James Mason (Longacre Theatre, NYC) in 1979 as well as the Broadway premieres of \"Dancing at Lughnasa\" in 1991 and \"Translations\" in 1995.\n\nFor many years, he toured a one-man performance of the writings of George Bernard Shaw, adapted and directed by Michael Voysey and entitled \"My Astonishing Self\".\n\nHis film roles included Archbishop Gilday in \"The Godfather Part III\" and he gained particular acclaim for his performance as Freddy Malins in John Huston's final work \"The Dead\" based on the short story by James Joyce.\n\nOn television, he played the lead role of Matthew Browne in the 1970s ITV sitcom \"Yes Honestly\", opposite Liza Goddard. But from the late 1950s onwards, he often appeared in such British TV programs as \"The Avengers\", \"Z Cars\" and \"The Wednesday Play\".\n\nHe was an acclaimed audiobook reader whose catalogue includes Pinocchio, Peter Pan, Voltaire's Philosophical Dictionary, and several audio versions of the works of James Joyce.\n\nIn 1968, he recorded an album of Irish songs \"Take the Name of Donnelly\" (Decca DL 75029) which was arranged, produced and conducted by Tony Meehan formerly of the Shadows.\n\nHe died in Chicago, Illinois, on 4 January 2010 from cancer, aged 78, and is survived by his wife, Patricia 'Patsy' Porter – a former dancer he met working on Finian's Rainbow, and two sons, Jonathan and Damian. His daughter Maryanne predeceased him.\n\n"}

According to exit polls, the Socialists had a lead with around 31%, but without a majority, necessitating the creation of a coalition. The National Movement for Simeon II, in power before the election, was in second place, with around 21%. Following the election, Socialist Party leader Sergei Stanishev became Prime Minister.\n\nAt least 6,000 candidates (from 22 parties) ran for election to the 240 member parliament. The turnout of 56% was the lowest on record. 4% of the votes are needed to gain a seat.\n\nThe opposition led the election, but did not gain an outright majority. Sergei Stanishev, leader of the socialist party, stated he would attempt to form a governing coalition. \"We won the confidence of the people ... We are ready to form a government ... and we will negotiate with any democratic party,\" Stanishev said in a press conference.\n\nIn the last five free elections held since 1989, no government has been re-elected—each has had to implement stringent economic and social reforms, since the fall of communism, and has lost popular support as a result.\n\nFor a political analysis of the 2005 parliamentary elections see Europe and the Parliamentary Elections in Bulgaria, 25 June 2005 published by the European Parties Elections and Referendums Network.\n\nAs no one party received a majority in the Assembly the Socialists were faced with the task of putting together a coalition government. The Socialists faced many difficulties when trying to establish a coalition as all of the other political party's that had crossed the 4% threshold to ensure representation in the parliament were to the right of the Socialists meaning compromise would be needed to ensure a workable coalition agreement. The Socialists tried to form a coalition of the three largest parties: themselves, the NDSV, and the DPS. However, while they gained the support of the DPS, they failed to gain the support of the NDSV. While the Socialist's tried to enter into a two party minority government with DPS as there coalition partner, this was rejected by parliament when despite voting for Sergei Stanishev to be prime minister in a close 120-119 vote the parliament voted against his proposed cabinet. As per the constitution the mandate to try a form a government was passed to the next largest political party, NDSV. However, on August 11, NDSV announced that they had decided to reject the offer due to the \"complicated political situation,\" this then lead to the third largest party, DPS to receive the mandate to try and form a coalition government, finally after talks with the leaders of the two largest parties Ahmed Dogan, leader of the DPS was able to form a coalition agreement between the Socialists, NDSV and his own DPS. Sergei Stanishev leader of the socialist's was elected prime minister and the coalition held 169 seats in the 240 seat parliament.\n"}

It is the largest of the 26 research centres under this dual umbrella. It is also part of the research unit 3330 \"Savoirs et Mondes Indiens\" of the CNRS, along with the Centre de Sciences Humaines (CSH) in New Delhi.\n\nEstablished under the terms of the Treaty of Cession of French Territories in India, the French Institute of Pondicherry was inaugurated on 21 March 1955 under the name \"Institut Français d'Indologie\". It was engaged, under the leadership of its first director (Jean Filliozat), in the study of Indian civilization and culture, and more particularly in the history and the religions of South India.\n\nThis culture had to be replaced in its natural environment – at least that was what Nehru encouraged the IFP to implement. Hence a department of Ecology was created to collect information on the conditions and evolution of the environment in South India (vegetation, soils, climate changes, etc.) with its focus on the Western Ghats, one of the world’s 34 hotspots for biodiversity.\n\nWith the setting up of the department of Social Sciences in 1988, the institute extended its interest to the evolution and dynamics of the Indian society.\n\nThe Laboratory of Applied Informatics and Geomatics (LAIG) was set up in the 1990s. In 2017 it became the department GeoSMIT (GeoSpatial Monitoring and Information Technology).\n\nThe institute has a library with 70,000 books and more than 120 journals received currently. It is open to the public (catalogue on line).\n\n\n\nRESEARCH: field work and data collection, organization of scientific events, response to calls for projects, publication of books and academic articles...\nTRAINING: receiving students on internship, master, doctoral and post-doctoral students from France and other countries.\n\nEXPERTISE: manuscript analysis, pollen study for archaeology, Smart Cities project of the Government of Puducherry, collaboration with the Agence Française de Développement... This last mission is growing. More generally, IFP is open to any partnership with companies, foundations and other organizations: sponsorship, research collaborations or expertise - financing projects, PhDs, chairs, etc.\n\n• The library: Its collection (on line catalogue) comprises 70,000 books and 800 journals, of which 140 are regularly subscribed; library open to all.\n\n. 8500 palm-leaf manuscripts (the largest collection of texts on Saivasiddhanta in the world, registered as such in the \"Memory of the World\" register of the UNESCO). IFP is regarded as a \"Manuscript Resource Centre\" by the National Mission for Manuscripts of the Government of India); 1144 transcripts, many of them being published with critical edition (see below).\n\n. A collection of 140,000 photographs, of temples and edifices in South India notably. The international police is making use of it for tracking stolen statues. Another collection is being built, on the history of family photography in Tamil Nadu (programme STARS).\n\n. Pollen slide collection (Dr. Thanikaimoni pollen reference slide collection): 22,000 slides in 15,000 tropical plant species.\n\n. The Herbarium houses nearly 23,000 specimens.\n\n. Nearly 3,000 maps on India and South and Southeast Asia, around 1,200 topographic maps (1 inch : 1 mile) dating from the first half of the 20th century and an equal number of topographic maps at the metric scale (most of them 1:50,000 and nearly 200 sheets at 1:250,000) obtained from the Survey of India and covering most of the Indian subcontinent. Around 500 thematic maps of other South and Southeast Asian countries (vegetation, soil, geology, meteorology, etc.) at highly varying scales, mainly from the 1950s, are preserved.\n\nThe IFP's research results are circulated in publications:\n\n. In international peer-reviewed journals;\n\n. By the institute itself: book series (Indology, jointly with EFEO) and multimedia CD-ROMs….\n\n. The IFP is developing portals (Biodiversity India Portal) and apps for a large audience (Pondicherry Past and Present). They are often based on the principle of interactive \"citizen science\".\n\n. The institute publishes a news bulletin \"Pattrika\" in collaboration with the CSH in Delhi and the EFEO (two issues per year). Its \"Newsletter\" appears bimonthly.\n\n. The institute organizes events that are of international academic level but are also suitable for the general public (Pondicherry Heritage Festival).\n\nWith respect to its branch of research in Indology, the French Institute of Pondicherry has a collection of 8,600 Hindu religious manuscripts and similar records, forming part of India’s National Mission for Manuscripts. Comprising 8,187 ancient palm-leaf bundles, 360 paper codices and 1,144 recent paper transcripts, it is the largest collection of manuscripts primarily transmitting texts of the Saiva Siddhanta tradition of Hinduism.\n\nThe collection was started in 1955 by the institute's founder-director, Jean Filliozat, who desired to explain the Hindu temple and what happens in it. The manuscripts were gathered from collections of temples, priests and monasteries across South India and brought to the institute with the intention of preserving, transcribing and translating them. Four volumes of a catalogue describing in detail the contents of 4,000 texts transmitted in 475 of the palm-leaf bundles were published in 1986, 1987, 1990 and 2002. Cataloguing has continued using flatbed scanning and digital photography technology in conjunction with a computerized database.\n\n\nThe collection was registered in UNESCO's World Memories in July 2005 and has been declared a national treasure of India by the Indian government. The institute was declared a \"Manuscript Resource Centre\" in 2004.\n\nThe personnel of the IFP consists of about 70 staff: \n\nThe institute welcomes researchers and research assistants on project contract and financed by outside sources, as well as experienced researchers and students of all nationalities associated with the projects of the institute and carrying out resident study.\n\n• Partnerships with major French research institutions such as the CIRAD, EFEO, INALCO, IRD and EHESS, as well as French local authorities such as Centre-Val de Loire region, etc.\n\n. Several Memoranda of Agreement with academic institutions including the Universities of Toronto, Eastern University (Sri Lanka), Bordeaux, Vedic University (Tirupati), Manipal... Tripartite Memoranda of Understanding associating the IFP and Pondicherry University with the universities of Limoges or Bordeaux 3 facilitate student exchanges between India and France.\n\nHalf of the budget comes from grants from the IFP’s supervisory authorities. The rest comes from external sources: European and French public funds, international funds (British Library, National Gallery of Australia, etc.), but also Indian sources (Rashtriya Samskrit Sansthan, MoEF…). Private funding is also increasing (e.g. Jain and Chettiar foundations).\n\n• A majestic colonial building by the sea.\n\n.

At the time of his death, Smith was regarded as one of the most successful African-American designers in the fashion industry. His company, WilliWear Limited, launched in 1976 and by 1986 grossed over $25 million in sales. After Smith's death, his business partner, Laurie Mallet, continued the line with various designers creating collections. Without Smith, the company floundered. Due to financial problems and poor sales, WilliWear Limited ceased production in 1990. WilliWear was the first clothing company to create womenswear and menswear under the same label. The accessibility and affordability of Smith's clothing helped to democratize fashion.\n\nSmith was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to Willie Lee Smith, an ironworker, and June Eileen Smith, a homemaker, both of whom were extremely clothes-conscious. As a boy, Smith spent hours sketching on the floor of his home and at the Philadelphia Museum College of Art. When reflecting on his childhood, Smith once stated, \"I loved to draw and design clothes, and my mother told me I was born to be an artist or designer.\" After his parents divorced, his grandmother, Gladys Bush, nurtured and motivated Smith to pursue his dreams in design.\n\nSmith studied commercial art at Mastbaum Technical High School and attended Philadelphia Museum College of Art, taking a course in fashion illustration. He then moved to New York City to go to Parsons The New School for Design, the art and design college of The New School. He received two scholarships to fund his studies at Parsons. In 1965, Smith interned for couturier Arnold Scaasi, and began studying fashion design at Parsons in the fall while taking liberal arts classes at New York University.\n\nIn 1967, Smith left Parsons and pursued a career designing on his own. He first sought design inspiration from what people wore on the streets of New York. He befriended model Bethann Hardison in 1967 after striking up a conversation about her style on the street. Hardison became the fit model for Smith's designs and a close friend.\n\nFrom 1969 to 1973, Smith worked as lead designer for the junior sportswear label Digits. Smith met future business partner and lifelong friend Laurie Mallet in 1970 while Mallet was in New York for a holiday break and hired her as his design assistant at Digits in 1971. The following year, 1972, Smith was nominated for the Coty American Fashion Critics’ Award for his work as lead designer at Digits. In 1973, Smith was nominated for the Coty American Fashion Critics’ Winnie Award for the second time, and began designing patterns for the commercial pattern company Butterick. Smith resigned from Digits later that same year and Digits went bankrupt shortly after. In 1974, Smith partnered with his sister Toukie Smith and close friend Harrison Rivera-Terreaux to form his own label Willi Smith Designs, Inc. Unfamiliar at the time with the business aspect of running a label, the company struggled and closed a few months later.\n\nSmith continued to design and, in 1976, traveled to Bombay (Mumbai) India with Mallet to produce a small collection of women's separates in natural fibers. The collection was a success, and soon after, Smith and Mallet formed the label WilliWear Ltd., with Mallet as President of the company and Willi Smith as Vice President and lead designer.The first Williwear fashion show was held at the Holly Solomon Gallery in the Spring of 1978 and showcased a collection of garments “influenced by nautical uniforms and Southeast Asian dress.” Subsequent WilliWear fashion shows were held in unconventional locations such as Alvin Ailey Studio and the Puck Building.\n\nWilliWear was a massive success, providing chic, stylish clothing for the modern woman, and later men, at affordable prices and in natural fabrics. In 1982, Smith produced the first WilliWear men's collection with Stuart Lazar as Executive Vice President of menswear. Smith also hired Mark Bozek as head of communications for WilliWear that same year. After receiving his fifth Coty Award nomination, Willi Smith won the Coty American Fashion Critics’ Award in 1983.\n\nWilliWear produced several hallmark collections from 1982 to 1986, and in 1986 the company reached $25 million in sales. Smith and Mallet further enriched the reputation of the brand through artist collaborations. After Smith's death, on April 17, 1987, Mallet continued to run WilliWear. However, without its visionary namesake, the company faltered and ceased production in 1990. Andre Walker was one of the designers hired to lead the brand after Smith's death.\n\nWilli Smith was an avid patron of the arts and collaborated with an extensive group of artists from 1973 up until his death in 1987. He designed costumes for choreographer Dianne McIntyre’s productions \"The Lost Sun\" (1973), \"The Deep South Suite\" (1976), and \"Take-Off From a Forced Landing\" (1984). Smith also designed costumes for the Bill T. Jones/ Arnie Zane Dance Company’s performance \"Secret Pastures\" (1984), as well as for Ellen Stewart's La MaMa Experimental Theatre Club's production \"Cotton-Club Gala\" (1985).\n\nSmith and Mallet also collaborated with twenty-one contemporary artists in 1984 to design T-shirts with silk-screened artwork. These T-shirts displayed original work by artists including Keith Haring, Christo, SITE, Suzan Pitt, Les Levine, Edwin Schlossberg, Kim Steele, Jose Gracia Severo, Barbara Kruger, Lynn Hershman, Jenny Holzer, Tod Siler, Dan Friedman ,and Andrew \"Zephyr\" Witten. The shirts were a part of the WilliWear Productions’ collection and video presentation \"Made in New York\" (1984). \"Made in New York\", directed by Les Levine, was the first short film project that WilliWear commissioned to present Smith's clothes in motion on the street and to combine the disciplines of art, fashion, and film in one form. In 1985, Smith also worked with Max Vadukul to direct the short film \"Expedition\", which was shot in Senegal and showcased ensembles inspired by Senegalese street fashion. Expedition debuted in New York at the Ziegfeld theater.\n\nSmith showcased his designs through film in \"Made in New York\" (1984) and \"Expedition\" (1985), as well as for film in Spike Lee’s \"School Daze\" (1987), creating the homecoming court costumes. Elements of film were also included in the presentation of the Fall 1983 WilliWear collection \"Street Couture\", held at the Puck Building, and incorporated video art by Juan Downey, music by Jorge Socarras, and makeup by Linda Mason. The presentation of the Spring 1983 WilliWear collection \"City Island\", featured video art, which was created by artist Nam June Paik. Other significant WilliWear collections include the Fall 1984 collection \"SUB-Urban\", Spring 1985 collection \"Sightseeing\", the 1984 collection for WilliWear Productions’ \"Made in New York\", and the 1985 collection for \"Expedition\". From 1982 to 1987, WilliWear showrooms and boutiques in New York City and London were designed by the conceptual design and architecture studio SITE, led by partners Alison Sky and James Wines. For the WilliWear showroom on 209 W 38th Street in New York City, SITE partnered with Smith and Mallet to design a monochrome streetscape with a sidewalk doubling as a runway and chain-link fencing serving as display racks </ref>\n\nAdditionally, Smith designed the suits for Edwin Schlossberg and his groomsmen when he married Caroline Kennedy, in 1986, and designed the wedding dress worn by Mary Jane Watson when she married Peter Parker in the \"Amazing Spider-Man Annual\" #21, in 1987. Smith also designed the uniforms for the workers on Jeanne-Claude and Christo's 1983 installation \"Surrounded Islands\" as well as for \"Pont Neuf Wrapped\" (1985) in Paris, France.\n\nOn April 16, 1987, Smith was admitted to Mt. Sinai Medical Center in New York City\nafter contracting shigella and pneumonia while on a fabric buying trip to India in February 1987.\nHe died of pneumonia complicated by shigella the following day at the age of 39.\nAccording to Smith's lawyer Edward Hayes, Smith's death was AIDS related. Smith was apparently unaware that he had contracted the disease and had shown no symptoms. It was only after he was hospitalized that tests revealed he was HIV positive. Laurie Mallet, Smith's business partner, later said that while the designer was always \"fragile\" and often too sick to work, she did not feel that he was seriously ill. When asked if Smith had any idea that he had AIDS, Mallet said that Smith never confided this to her, but she felt \"maybe he had some idea, some feeling.\" Smith's funeral was held on April 20 at the Frank E. Campbell Funeral Chapel in Manhattan, after which his remains were cremated. On May 1, 1987, a memorial service was held for Smith at his alma mater, Parsons The New School for Design.\n\nSmith, who was openly gay, has a panel in the original \"NAMES Project AIDS Memorial Quilt\". Smith is also lamented in a poem \"Speak: A Poem for the Millennium March\", by Keith Boykin, read by its author for the Millennium March on Washington for Equality on April 29, 2000.\n\nWilli Smith was one of the first American designers to create clothing inspired by and for everyday people and what they wore on city streets – making his sportswear a bridge to commercial streetwear. Smith also sourced natural fabrics from India for WilliWear collections. The designer blurred the lines of gendered fashion in American sportswear with garments created for both his WilliWear Men's and Women's collections. Smith also played a key role in the democratization of fashion by keeping WilliWear at an affordable price-point, as well as by partnering with pattern companies Butterick and McCall's to produce home sewing patterns of his collections. He sought not to target an exclusive clientele with his work, but instead to ensure that his clothing could be worn by people from varied backgrounds. Smith's label WilliWear set the stage for later streetwear brands such as FUBU and WalkerWear. Smith's gender-neutral collections for WilliWear can be seen as precursors for contemporary gender-neutral brands such as One DNA and the Phluid Project. Smith's influence can also be seen in brands such as Supreme, Off-White, Telfar, Vaquera, Eckhaus Latta and Pyer Moss.\n\nAdditionally, many young designers and artists worked at WilliWear before launching their own successful careers and labels, including Antthony Mark Hankins, James Mischka, Jon Coffelt, John Bartlett, and Andre Walker, among many others. While WilliWear was very successful, the company had experienced creative, quality, and merchandising problems in the year before Smith's death. In an effort to remedy these problems, Smith's business partner Laurie Mallet hired a new staff and brought in additional designers in an effort to appeal to a more sophisticated demographic. After Smith's death, Mallet vowed to continue the line. In late 1987 and 1988, she opened WilliWear stores in Paris and New York City (a London location was opened before Smith's death which proved to be very successful). However, Mallet struggled to maintain the success the line had when Smith was alive. By 1989, sales had decreased. In November 1989, Mallet hired then up and coming designer Andre Young to design the line's Fall 1990 collection.\nUpon its debut in April, the line was panned by critics. To save money, Mallet closed the WilliWear stores and tried to generate revenue by convincing chain stores to carry the line. Mallet's efforts failed and, in 1990, the women's division of WilliWear ceased production. Shortly thereafter, the men's division also ceased production.\n\nIn 1981, Willi Smith participated in the Black Fashion Museum’s \"Bridal Gowns of Black Designers\" exhibition. He designed a two-piece wedding ensemble consisting of “a rajah style jacket in cotton satin and velveteen jodhpurs,” which was prominently displayed during the show. The following year, Smith participated in the Project Space One (MoMA PS1) exhibition Art As Damaged Goods. Smith and Mallet also collaborated with local art galleries, which hosted early WilliWear and WilliWear Productions fashion shows. The line of artist T-shirts for WilliWear Productions was first exhibited at the Ronald Feldman Gallery, then during the Artventure fundraiser hosted at AREA by the Public Art Fund in 1984.\n\nCooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum will host the first retrospective exhibition on Willi Smith from March 13, 2020, to October 25, 2020. The exhibition is curated by Alexandra Cunningham Cameron, Curator of Contemporary Design, and Hintz Secretarial Scholar at Cooper Hewitt with Curatorial Assistants Julie Pastor and Darnell Jamal Lisby. The collaborative and accessible nature of Willi Smith's work will be highlighted through the exhibition and will be incorporated to a greater extent through the Willi Smith Community Digital Archive, which the public can contribute to. The archive will serve as a resource for scholars and enthusiasts gain greater insight and understanding into the life, work, and legacy of the visionary American designer.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2336038", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2336038", "title": "Troparion", "text": "Troparion\n\nA troparion (Greek , plural: troparia, τροπάρια; Georgian: ტროპარი, \"tropari\" Church Slavonic: тропа́рь, \"tropar\") in Byzantine music and in the religious music of Eastern Orthodox Christianity is a short hymn of one stanza, or organised in more complex forms as series of stanzas. \n\nThe word probably derived from a diminutive of the Greek \"tropos\" (“something repeated”, “manner”, “fashion”), since the earliest function of the troparion was a refrain during the recitation of the cantica (biblical odes) and the psalms, as such the term was used as a synonym of hypakoe. The early meaning of troparion was related to the monastic hymn book Tropologion or Troparologion. Hence its forms were manifold, they could be simple stanzas like apolytikia, theotokia, but also more elaborated homiletic poems like stichera composed in psalmodic hexameters (probably from \"stichos\", “verse”), or in a more complex meter like the odes composed in cycles called canon. Since these Tropologia in their earliest form were organised according to the Octoechos, troparia were always chanted according to a melos of one of the eight tones used in the Eastern liturgical tradition (Gr. echos, Sl. glas). Today, since the redefinition of the Octoechos according to the hyphos of Constantinople, the monodic form of Orthodox chant distincts the troparic (apolytikia, theotokia, kontakia etc.), the heirmologic (related to the hymns of the Heirmologion), and the sticheraric melos (related to the hymns of the Sticherarion) according to its modal formulas and its tempo.\n\nIn casual, unqualified use, \"troparion\" usually refers to the \"apolytikion\" (Greek: ἀπολυτίκιον), or \"dismissal hymn\", a troparion chanted near the end of Vespers which establishes the overall theme for the liturgical day, for which it is called the \"troparion of the day\". It is chanted again at the beginning of Matins, read at each of the Little Hours, and chanted at the Divine Liturgy following the Little Entrance.\n\nA troparion in honor of the Trinity is called a \"Triadicon\" (Greek: Τριαδικόν, Slavonic: \"Troíchen\"). Often the penultimate in a series of troparia will be a triadicon, usually preceded by, \"Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit.\" There are also special Triadica (\"Hymns to the Trinity\") which are chanted after Alleluia at the beginning of Matins on weekdays of Great Lent, which differ according to the tone of the week and the day of the week.\n\nA troparion to the Mother of God (Theotokos) is called a \"Theotokion\" (Greek: Θεοτοκίον, Slavonic: \"Bogorόdichen\"); plural: \"Theotokia\" (Θεοτοκία). Theotokia will often occur at the end of a series of troparia, usually preceded by \"Both now and ever, and unto the ages of ages. Amen.\" If a Theotokion makes reference to the Crucifixion of Jesus, it is called a \"stavrotheotokion\" (Greek: σταυροθεοτοκίον, Slavonic: \"krestobogoródichen\").\n\nThe stanzas of a Canon are troparia, as are the verses interspersed between the Beatitudes at the Divine Liturgy.\n\nA famous example, whose existence is attested as early as the 4th century, is the Vespers hymn, \"Phos Hilaron\", \"Gladsome Light\"; another, \"O Monogenes Yios\", \"Only Begotten Son\", ascribed to Justinian I (527 - 565), occurs in the introductory portion of the Divine Liturgy. Perhaps the earliest set of troparia of known authorship are those of the monk Auxentios (first half of the 5th century), mentioned in his biography but not preserved in any later Byzantine order of service.\n\nAt the present time, Troparia occur at the following points in the Divine Services:\n\n\n\n\n\nPaschal troparion, Tone V:\n\nTroparion of the Holy Cross, Tone I:\nTroparion of Holy Saturday (The Noble Joseph), Tone II:\n\n\"Axion Estin\", a theotokion\n\nTroparion of Kassiani (Chanted during Holy Week on Great and Holy Wednesday)\n\nTroparion of the Nativity (in Church Slavonic language):\n\n"}
{"id": "2336041", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2336041", "title": "Halterneck", "text": "Halterneck\n\nHalterneck is a style of women's clothing strap that runs from the front of the garment around the back of the neck, and leaves most of the back uncovered. The name comes from livestock halters. The word \"halter\" derives from the Germanic words meaning \"that by which anything is held.\" Halter is in the German word Büstenhalter, a dated word for bra, with Büste meaning female chest and breasts. \n\nThe halter style is used with swimsuits, to maximize sun tan exposure on the back and minimize tan lines. It is also used with dresses or shirts, to create a backless dress or top. The neck strap can itself be covered by the wearer's hair, leaving the impression from behind that nothing is holding the dress or shirt up.\n\nIf a bra is worn with a halter top, it is generally either strapless or of halterneck construction itself, so as to avoid exposing the back straps of a typical bra.\n\nA halter top is a type of sleeveless shirt similar to a tank top (by the American English definition) but with the straps being tied behind the neck. In another style of the halter top, there is only a narrow strap behind the neck and a narrow strap behind the middle of the back, so that it is mostly backless. This design resembles many bikini tops, although it covers the chest more and may cover some or all of the abdomen at the front.\n\nIt has been suggested that the neckline's appeal stems from the fact that \"it eliminated the need for spoiling the back detail with straps, leaving an uninterrupted area of skin to expose to the sun by day and display by night.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "2336049", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2336049", "title": "Irmos", "text": "Irmos\n\nThe irmos (or heirmos from Greek εἱρμός) in the Byzantine liturgical tradition is the initial troparion of an ode of a canon. The meter and melody of an irmos is followed by the remaining troparia of the ode; when more than one canon is used (as is typical at matins), only the first canon's irmos is sung, but the irmoi of the subsequent canons must be known in order to determine an ode's melody and so, even in canons where it is known that the irmos is never sung, the irmos is nonetheless specified. Note that in the Russian tradition, often only the irmos is sung, the rest of the ode simply being read; in Greek parishes, often the remaining troparia are simply eliminated, but in non-Russian traditions, all troparia of a canon are sung\n\nThe term comes from the Greek verb \"to tie, link\" meaning that it poetically connects the Biblical ode to the subject of the canon.\n\nBecause the irmos presents a rhythmic and melodic pattern for the troparia which follow, \"irmos\" gives its name to the irmologic forms of Byzantine chant.\n\nAt the end of an ode, the irmos may be repeated, or another irmos may be prescribed to be sung to return to the original biblical theme this is called the katavasia.\n\n"}
{"id": "2336051", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2336051", "title": "Lidia Bastianich", "text": "Lidia Bastianich\n\nLidia Giuliana Matticchio Bastianich (; born in Pula, February 21, 1947) is an Italian-American celebrity chef, television host, author, and restaurateur. Specializing in Italian and Italian-American cuisine, Bastianich has been a regular contributor to public television cooking shows since 1998.\n\nIn 2014, she launched her fifth television series, \"Lidia's Kitchen\". She owns several Italian restaurants in the U.S. in partnership with her daughter Tanya Bastianich Manuali and her son, Joe Bastianich, including Felidia (founded with her ex-husband, Felice), Del Posto, and Becco in Manhattan; Lidia's Pittsburgh in Pittsburgh; and Lidia's Kansas City in Kansas City, Missouri.\n\nLidia Bastianich was born Lidia Giuliana Matticchio on February 21, 1947, in Pula, Istria, after the city was assigned to Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia in 1945, (which is now Croatia). She is the daughter of Erminia (née Pavichievaz, the daughter of Rosaria Smilovich) and Vittorio Matticchio (the son of Antonio Motika and Francesca Lovrecich). Her family lived nine years under Marshal Tito's Communist regime in Yugoslavia, during which time the government changed her family name Matticchio back to Motika. In 1956 Lidia's father Vittorio sent his wife and their two children to visit relatives in Trieste, Italy, while he remained in Istria to comply with the government's mandate that one member of a family remain in Yugoslavia to ensure that the rest would return. About two weeks later, Vittorio himself left Yugoslavia at night and crossed the border into Italy. Their departure was part of the larger Istrian exodus.\n\nThe Matticchio family reunited in Trieste, Italy, joining other families who had claimed political asylum from Communist Yugoslavia starting in 1947, many of whom remained in refugee camps throughout Italy for years. For the Matticchio family, the Risiera di San Sabba camp was one that had been an abandoned rice factory in Trieste that had been converted to a Nazi concentration camp during World War II and partially destroyed toward the end of the war. According to Bastianich in a Public Television documentary, although a wealthy Triestine family hired her mother as a cook–housekeeper and her father as a limousine driver, they remained residents of the refugee camp. Two years later, their displaced persons application was granted to emigrate to the U.S. In 1958, the Matticchio family reached New York City. The 12-year-old Lidia and her family moved to North Bergen, New Jersey, and later Queens, New York.\n\nBastianich gives credit for the family's new roots in America to their sponsor, Catholic Relief Services:\n\nBastianich started working part-time when she was 14 (the legal age for a work permit), during which time she briefly worked at the Astoria bakery owned by Christopher Walken's father. After graduating from high school, she began to work full-time at a pizzeria on the upper west side of Manhattan.\n\nIn 1971, the Bastianiches opened their first restaurant, the tiny \"Buonavia\", meaning \"good road\", in the Forest Hills section of Queens, with Bastianich as its hostess. They created their restaurant's menu by copying recipes from the most popular and successful Italian restaurants of the day, and they hired the best Italian-American chef that they could find.\n\nAfter a brief break to deliver her second child Tanya, in 1972 Bastianich began training as the assistant chef at \"Buonavia\", gradually learning enough to cook popular Italian dishes on her own, after which the couple began adding traditional Istrian dishes to their menu.\n\nThe success of \"Buonavia\" led to the opening of the second restaurant in Queens, \"Villa Secondo\". It was here that Bastianich gained the attention of local food critics and started to give live cooking demonstrations, a prelude to her future career as a television cooking show hostess.\n\nIn 1981, Bastianich's father died, and the family sold their two Queens restaurants and purchased a small Manhattan brownstone containing a pre-existing restaurant on the East Side of Manhattan near the 59th Street Bridge to Queens. They converted it into what would eventually become their flagship restaurant, \"Felidia\" (a contraction of \"Felice\" and \"Lidia\"). After liquidating nearly every asset they had to cover $750,000 worth of renovations, Felidia finally opened to near-universal acclaim from their loyal following of food critics, including \"The New York Times\", which gave Felidia three stars. One of Felidia's chefs was not Italian. He was Puerto-Rico-born David Torres, known at the restaurant as Davide'. He died of throat cancer in 1996.\n\nAlthough Lidia and Felice sent their two children to college without expectations that either would go into the restaurant business, Joseph, who had frequently done odd jobs for his parents at Felidia, gave up his newly launched career as a Wall Street bond trader and in 1993 convinced his parents to partner with him to open \"Becco\" (Italian for \"peck, nibble, savor\") in the Theater District in Manhattan. Like \"Felidia\", \"Becco\" was an immediate success and led to the opening of additional restaurants outside New York City, including \"Lidia's Kansas City\" in 1998, and \"Lidia's Pittsburgh\" in 2001.\n\nIn 1993, Julia Child invited Bastianich to tape an episode of her Public Television series \"Julia Child: Cooking With Master Chefs\", which featured acclaimed chefs from around the U.S., preparing dishes in their own home kitchens. The guest appearance gave Bastianich confidence and determination to expand the Bastianich family's own commercial interests.\n\nBy the late 1990s, Bastianich's restaurants had evolved into a truly family-owned and operated enterprise. Bastianich's mother, Erminia Motika, maintained the large garden behind the family home, from which Bastianich chose ingredients to use in recipe development. Joe was the chief sommelier of the restaurant group, in addition to branching out into his own restaurant line. Bastianich's daughter Tanya Bastianich Manuali used her Ph.D in Italian art history as the foundation for a travel agency partnership with her mother called \"Esperienze Italiane\", through which Tanya and friend Shelly Burgess Nicotra (Executive Producer of Bastianich's television series and head of PR at Lidia's Italy) offered tours throughout Italy. Tanya's husband, attorney Corrado Manuali, became the restaurant group's chief legal counsel.\n\nIn 2010, Bastianich and her son partnered with Oscar Farinetti to open Eataly, a food emporium in Manhattan that is devoted to the food and culinary traditions of Italy. Bastianich offers culinary and gastronomy classes to the public at Eataly's school, La Scuola. Eataly's motto is \"We sell what we cook, and we cook what we sell\". Eataly is now in Chicago and São Paulo, Brazil. They opened a second store in New York at the World Trade Center in Manhattan in 2016 and another one in Boston the same year. Recent openings include Eataly in Los Angeles in 2017, in Las Vegas in 2018, and in Toronto in 2019.\n\nThe fall of 2010 also marked the debut of Lidia's Kitchen, an exclusive line of commercial cookware, and serving ware for QVC. Along with her daughter Tanya, and son-in-law Corrado Manuali, Bastianich launched Nonna Foods as a platform to distribute an array of both existing and new LIDIA'S food products. Nonna Foods has 9 cuts of pasta and 9 varieties of sauces (including two USDA Certified Organic sauces) available nationwide. Together with her son Joseph, Bastianich produces award-winning wines at Bastianich Vineyard in Friuli Venezia Giulia and La Mozza Vineyard in Maremma, Italy.\n\nIn 1998, Public Television offered Bastianich her own television series which became \"Lidia's Italian Table\". It established her as a fixture in the network's line-up of cooking shows. Since then she has hosted additional public television series, including \"Lidia's Family Table\", \"Lidia's Italy\", \"Lidia's Italy in America\", and \"Lidia's Kitchen\".\n\nShe also hosted a series of hour-long Public Television specials called \"Lidia Celebrates America\", which premiered in 2011 with \"Lidia Celebrates America: Holiday Tables & Traditions\". In the series, Bastianich celebrates the diversity of cultures across the United States and explores the American immigrant experience. The following special, \"Lidia Celebrates America: Weddings – Something Borrowed, Something New\", aired in 2012; \"Lidia Celebrates America: Freedom & Independence\" in 2013; \"Lidia Celebrates America: Life's Milestones\" in 2013; \"Lidia Celebrates America: Holiday Tables and Traditions\" in 2015; \"Lidia Celebrates America: Holiday for Heroes\" in 2016; \"Lidia Celebrates America: Homegrown Heroes\" in 2017, and \"Lidia Celebrates America: A Heartland Holiday Feast\" in 2018, and \"Lidia Celebrates America: The Return of the Artisans\" in 2019. Bastianich ends each episode of her show with an invitation to join her and her family for a meal, \"Tutti a tavola a mangiare!\" (Italian for \"Everyone to the table to eat\").\n\nFor the 2010 holiday season, her new television production company, Tavola Productions, created an animated holiday children's special for Public Television \"Lidia's Christmas Kitchen: Nonna Tell Me a Story\" to go along with the book by the same title that was written by Bastianich.\n\nIn 2013, Bastianich returned to Public Television with Lidia's Kitchen, a 26-part series produced by Tavola Productions. The sixth season ran from October 2018 through March 2019. The seventh season premiered in October 2019.\n\nAmong Bastianich's television show appearances, she participated as a celebrity judge on MasterChef USA, an adaptation of the BBC MasterChef (UK TV series) in 2000. Her son, Joseph Bastianich, would later go on to star as a celebrity judge on the Gordon Ramsay version of MasterChef. Bastianich has also appeared on the Italian television show Junior MasterChef Italia in 2014 and 2015 for Season 1 and Season 2. In 2016 and 2017, she was a judge for the Italian television show, La Prova del Cuoco. In 2020, alongside son Joe Bastianich and Antonino Cannavacciuolo, she was a judge on the cooking competition show on Sky, Family Food Fight.\n\nBastianich has authored several cookbooks to accompany her television series:\n\n\n\nAt her sweet sixteen birthday party, she was introduced to her future husband, Felice \"Felix\" Bastianich, a fellow Istrian immigrant and restaurant worker from Labin (Albona), on the eastern coast of Istria, Croatia. The couple married in 1966 and Lidia gave birth to their son, Joseph, in 1968. Their second child, Tanya, was born in 1972.\n\nAfter many disagreements about the direction their entrepreneurial and personal lives had taken — most notably the pace of the expansion and character of their business — Lidia and Felice divorced in 1998. Bastianich continued expanding her business while Felice transferred his shares in the business to their two children. He died on December 12, 2010.\n\nBastianich lives in Douglaston, Queens, with her mother, Erminia Motika. Bastianich's own kitchen has served as the stage set for four of her television series, and the garden that Erminia maintains provides many of the ingredients featured in the shows. Erminia, who answers to \"grandma,\" frequently serves as a sous-chef in various episodes of the television series.\n\nJoe Bastianich occasionally appears in his mother's series to offer wine expertise. He, his wife Deanna, and their three children live in New York City.\n\nTanya Bastianich Manuali, with her husband Corrado Manuali and their two children, lives just a few blocks away from her mother. Tanya is integrally involved in the production of Lidia's public television series as an owner and Executive Producer of Tavola Productions and is active daily in the family restaurant business.\n\nIn an interview by American Public Television, Bastianich spoke of how important it is for her to pass on family traditions:\n\nIn 2011, Bastianich was accused of keeping an indentured servant. The subsequent lawsuit was tossed out in 2012 by a lower court that held that the plaintiff was not a slave because she received health insurance, room and board and other perks in lieu of getting paid. The claimant later recanted the principal accusations of the lawsuit.\n\nLidia Bastianich is an active member of society who participates in community service activities and special events on behalf of several foundations. She is a member of Les Dames d'Escoffier and a founding member of Women Chefs and Restaurateurs, two non-profit organizations of women leaders in the food and hospitality industries. She is also a champion for the United Nations Association of the United States of America's Adopt-A-Future program, in support of refugee education.\n\nBastianich is on the Board of the Arrupe College, a higher education program founded by the Loyola University of Chicago for underprivileged students, and regularly hosts Fundraisers for the program at Eataly in Chicago. BoysGrow, a local non-profit vocational training program, is another organization that she works with by hosting annual Benefit Dinners since 2013 at her restaurant Lidia's in Kansas City. In addition, she has helped raise funds for United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM)- now known as UN Women- as co-chair of charity events and Benefit Dinners throughout her career. She is also involved with Jesuit Refugee Service, The Child Center of NY and hosts at classes at August Martin High School in Queens, New York.\n\nBastianich is also actively involved with various non-profit organizations that are focused on promoting and celebrating Italian and Italian-American culture and heritage. She is part of the National Organization of Italian American Women's Distinguished Board, a national organization for women of Italian ancestry that focuses on preserving Italian heritage, language and culture. In 2010, the Bastianich family was honored by NOIAW for their outstanding contributions to Italian culture in America.\n\nShe supports the Columbus Citizens Foundation, a non-profit organization focused on promoting and celebrating Italian-American heritage.

{"id": "2336061", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2336061", "title": "The Marriage of Figaro (play)", "text": "The Marriage of Figaro (play)\n\nThe Marriage of Figaro ( (\"The Mad Day, or The Marriage of Figaro\")) is a comedy in five acts, written in 1778 by Pierre Beaumarchais. This play is the second in the Figaro trilogy, preceded by \"The Barber of Seville\" and followed by \"The Guilty Mother\".\n\nIn the first play, \"The Barber\", the story begins with a simple love triangle in which a Spanish count has fallen in love with a girl called Rosine. He disguises himself to ensure that she will love him back for his character, not his wealth. But this is all foiled when Rosine's guardian, Doctor Bartholo, who wants her hand in marriage, confines her to the house. The Count runs into an ex-servant of his (now a barber), Figaro, and pressures him into setting up a meeting between the Count and Rosine. He succeeds and the lovers are married to end the first part of the trilogy.\n\n\"The Marriage\" was written as a sequel to \"The Barber\". In his preface to the play, Beaumarchais says that Louis François, Prince of Conti had requested it. The play's denunciation of aristocratic privilege has been characterised as foreshadowing the French Revolution. The revolutionary leader Georges Danton said that the play \"killed off the nobility\"; in exile, Napoleon Bonaparte called it \"the Revolution already put into action.\"\n\nThanks to the great popularity of its predecessor, \"The Marriage of Figaro\" opened to enormous success; it was said to have grossed 100,000 francs in the first twenty showings, and the theatre was so packed that three people were reportedly crushed to death in the opening-night crowd.\n\nThe play formed the basis for an opera with a libretto by Lorenzo Da Ponte and music by Mozart, also called \"The Marriage of Figaro\" (1786). In 1799, another opera based on the same play, \"La pazza giornata, ovvero Il matrimonio di Figaro\", was produced in Venice with libretto by Gaetano Rossi and music by Marcos Portugal.\n\n\"The Marriage of Figaro\" picks up three years following the end of \"The Barber of Seville\" as Figaro is engaged to be married to Suzanne; both characters are among the Count's staff in his dwelling. In the three years since Figaro helped forge the marriage of the Count and Rosine, the Count has already grown bored with his marriage and is taking notice of Suzanne. The Count looks to re-engage the act of primae noctis, in which he would consummate the marriage with the bride-to-be prior to Figaro's honeymoon.\n\nThe scholar and translator John Wood writes that the play was probably completed in more or less its existing form by 1778. It was accepted for production by the management of the Comédie Française in 1781, after which three years elapsed before it was publicly staged. Initially the text was approved, with minor changes, by the official censor, but at a private reading before the French court the play so shocked King Louis XVI that he forbade its public presentation. Beaumarchais revised the text, moving the action from France to Spain, and after further scrutiny by the censor the piece was played to an audience including members of the Royal Family in September 1783. The censors still refused to license the play for public performance, but the king personally authorised its production.\n\nUnder the title of \"La Folle Journée, ou Le Mariage de Figaro\", the play opened at the Théâtre Français on 27 April 1784 and ran for 68 consecutive performances, earning higher box-office receipts than any other French play of the eighteenth century. The author gave his share of the profits to charity.\n\nThe play was translated into English by Thomas Holcroft, and under the title of \"The Follies of a Day – Or The Marriage of Figaro\" it was produced at the Theatre Royal, Covent Garden in London in late 1784 and early 1785. In France the play has held its place in the repertory, and leading companies have played it in the original language to audiences in Europe and America. In 1960 a Comédie Française production was filmed, under the direction of Jean Mayer, with Jean Piat as Figaro.\n\nIn the twentieth century the play continued to be staged in translation by foreign companies. In 1927 Constantin Stanislavski staged the work at the Moscow Art Theatre; in 1974 the British National Theatre company presented a version by John Wells, directed by Jonathan Miller.\n\nBeaumarchais' comedy was adapted into \"One Mad Day!\" a \"screwball comedy\" in Three Acts by William James Royce. The play premiered at the Norton Clapp Theatre on 24 October 2008. In 1984 BBC Radio 3 broadcast a production of Beaumarchais' play in John Wells's translation; in December 2010 the same station transmitted a new version, adapted and directed by David Timson.\n\nBeaumarchais wrote detailed notes on the characters, printed in the first published text of the play, issued in 1785. The author prescribed that Figaro must be played without any suggestion of caricature; the Count with great dignity yet with grace and affability; the Countess with restrained tenderness; Suzanne as intelligent and lively but without brazen gaiety; Chérubin as a charming young scamp, diffident only in the presence of the Countess. Chérubin is traditionally played as a trouser role by a woman. Beaumarchais said that in the original company, there were no boys available who were both the right age and who could understand all the subtleties of the role: most of the character's comic traits come from the view of an adult looking back on puberty with amusement.\n\nThe ridiculous character of Don Guzman was a jab at a judge, Louis Valentin Goëzman, whom Beaumarchais had—in vain—tried to bribe once, offering jewels to his wife and money to his secretary. Beaumarchais gained public acclaim for directly challenging the judge in a series of pamphlets collectively published as \"Mémoires dans l'affaire Goëzman\". Beaumarchais was hailed as a hero of the people with the public embarrassment he brought upon Goëzman.\n\nFanchette is around twelve years old. At the time, the age of consent throughout most of Europe was around that same age; hence, the revelation that she and the adult Count are sleeping together was not meant to be quite as shocking as it is often perceived these days.\n\nThe play is set at the castle of Aguas Frescas, three leagues from Seville.\n\nThe play begins in a room in the Count's castle—the bedroom to be shared by Figaro and Suzanne after their wedding, which is set to occur later that day. Suzanne reveals to Figaro her suspicion that the Count gave them this particular room because it is so close to his own, and that the Count has been pressing her to begin an affair with him. Figaro at once goes to work trying to find a solution to this problem. Then Dr. Bartholo and Marceline pass through, discussing a lawsuit they are to file against Figaro, who owes Marceline a good deal of money and has promised to marry her if he fails to repay the sum; his marriage to Suzanne will potentially void the contract. Bartholo relishes the news that Rosine is unhappy in her marriage, and they discuss the expectation that the Count will take Figaro's side in the lawsuit if Suzanne should submit to his advances. Marceline herself is in love with Figaro, and hopes to discourage Suzanne from this.\n\nAfter a brief confrontation between Marceline and Suzanne, a young pageboy named Chérubin comes to tell Suzanne that he has been dismissed for being caught hiding in the bedroom of the Countess, Fanchette. The conversation is interrupted by the entrance of the Count, and since Suzanne and Chérubin do not want to be caught alone in a bedroom together, Chérubin hides behind an armchair. When the Count enters, he propositions Suzanne (who continues to refuse to sleep with him). They are then interrupted by Bazile's entrance. Again, not wanting to be found in a bedroom with Suzanne, the Count hides behind the armchair. Chérubin is forced to throw himself on top of the armchair so the Count will not find him, and Suzanne covers him with a dress so Bazile cannot see him. Bazile stands in the doorway and begins to tell Suzanne all the latest gossip. When he mentions a rumour that there is a relationship between the Countess and Chérubin, the Count becomes outraged and stands up, revealing himself. The Count justifies his firing Chérubin to Bazile and the horrified Suzanne (now worried that Bazile will believe that she and the Count are having an affair). The Count re-enacts finding Chérubin behind the door in Fanchette's room by lifting the dress covering Chérubin, accidentally uncovering Chérubin's hiding spot for the second time. The Count is afraid that Chérubin will reveal the earlier conversation in which he was propositioning Suzanne, and so decides to send him away at once as a soldier. Figaro then enters with the Countess, who is still oblivious to her husband's plans. A troupe of wedding guests enters with him, intending to begin the wedding ceremony immediately. The Count is able to persuade them to hold it back a few more hours, giving himself more time to enact his plans.\n\nThe scene is the Countess's bedroom. Suzanne has just broken the news of the Count's action to the Countess, who is distraught. Figaro enters and tells them that he has set in motion a new plan to distract the Count from his intentions toward Suzanne by starting a false rumour that the Countess is having an affair and that her lover will appear at the wedding; this, he hopes, will motivate the Count to let the wedding go ahead. Suzanne and the Countess have doubts about the effectiveness of the plot; they decide to tell the Count that Suzanne has agreed to his proposal, and then to embarrass him by sending out Chérubin dressed in Suzanne's gown to meet him. They stop Chérubin from leaving and begin to dress him, but just when Suzanne steps out of the room, the Count comes in. Chérubin hides, half dressed, in the adjoining dressing room while the Count grows increasingly suspicious, especially after having just heard Figaro's rumour of the Countess's affair. He leaves to get tools to break open the dressing room door, giving Chérubin enough time to escape through the window and Suzanne time to take his place in the dressing room; when the Count opens the door, it appears that Suzanne was inside there all along. Just when it seems he calms down, the gardener Antonio runs in screaming that a half-dressed man just jumped from the Countess's window. The Count's fears are settled again once Figaro takes credit to being the jumper, claiming that he started the rumour of the Countess having an affair as a prank and that while he was waiting for Suzanne he became frightened of the Count's wrath, jumping out the window in terror. Just then Marceline, Bartholo and the judge Brid'oison come to inform Figaro that his trial is starting.\n\nFigaro and the Count exchange a few words, until Suzanne, at the insistence of the Countess, goes to the Count and tells him that she has decided that she will begin an affair with him, and asks he meet her after the wedding. The Countess has actually promised to appear at the assignation in Suzanne's place. The Count is glad to hear that Suzanne has seemingly decided to go along with his advances, but his mood sours again once he hears her talking to Figaro and saying it was only done so they might win the case.\n\nCourt is then held, and after a few minor cases, Figaro's trial occurs. Much is made of the fact that Figaro has no middle or last name, and he explains that it is because he was kidnapped as a baby and doesn't know his real name. The Count rules in Marceline's favour, effectively forcing Figaro to marry her, when Marceline suddenly recognizes a birthmark (or scar or tattoo; the text is unclear) in the shape of a \"spatule\" (lobster) on Figaro's arm—he is her son, and Dr. Bartholo is his father. Just then Suzanne runs in with enough money to repay Marceline, given to her by the Countess. At this, the Count storms off in outrage.\n\nFigaro is thrilled to have rediscovered his parents, but Suzanne's uncle, Antonio, insists that Suzanne cannot marry Figaro now, because he is illegitimate. Marceline and Bartholo are persuaded to marry in order to correct this problem.\n\nFigaro and Suzanne talk before the wedding, and Figaro tells Suzanne that if the Count still thinks she is going to meet him in the garden later, she should just let him stand there waiting all night. Suzanne promises, but the Countess grows upset when she hears this news, thinking that Suzanne is in the Count's pocket and is wishing she had kept their rendezvous a secret. As she leaves, Suzanne falls to her knees, and agrees to go through with the plan to trick the Count. Together they write a note to him entitled \"A New Song on the Breeze\" (a reference to the Countess's old habit of communicating with the Count through sheet music dropped from her window), which tells him that she will meet him under the chestnut trees. The Countess lends Suzanne a pin from her dress to seal the letter, but as she does so, the ribbon from Chérubin falls out of the top of her dress. At that moment, Fanchette enters with Chérubin disguised as a girl, a shepherdess, and girls from the town to give the Countess flowers. As thanks, the Countess kisses Chérubin on the forehead. Antonio and the Count enter—Antonio knows Chérubin is disguised because they dressed him at his daughter's (Fanchette's) house. The Countess admits to hiding Chérubin in her room earlier and the Count is about to punish him. Fanchette suddenly admits that she and the Count have been having an affair, and that, since he has promised he will give her anything she desires, he must not punish Chérubin but give him to her as a husband. Later, the wedding is interrupted by Bazile, who had wished to marry Marceline himself; but once he learns that Figaro is her son he is so horrified that he abandons his plans. Later, Figaro witnesses the Count opening the letter from Suzanne, but thinks nothing of it. After the ceremony, he notices Fanchette looking upset, and discovers that the cause is her having lost the pin that was used to seal the letter, which the Count had told her to give back to Suzanne. Figaro nearly faints at the news, believing Suzanne's secret communication means that she has been unfaithful and, restraining tears, he announces to Marceline that he is going to seek vengeance on both the Count and Suzanne.\n\nIn the castle gardens beneath a grove of chestnut trees, Figaro has called together a group of men and instructs them to call together everyone they can find: he intends to have them all walk in on the Count and Suzanne \"in flagrante delicto\", humiliating the pair and also ensuring ease of obtaining a divorce. After a tirade against the aristocracy and the unhappy state of his life, Figaro hides nearby. The Countess and Suzanne then enter, each dressed in the other's clothes. They are aware that Figaro is watching, and Suzanne is upset that her husband would doubt her so much as to think she would ever really be unfaithful to him. Soon afterward the Count comes, and the disguised Countess goes off with him. Figaro is outraged, and goes to the woman he thinks is the Countess to complain; he realises that he is talking to his own wife Suzanne, who scolds him for his lack of confidence in her. Figaro agrees that he was being stupid, and they are quickly reconciled. Just then the Count comes out and sees what he thinks is his own wife kissing Figaro, and races to stop the scene. At this point, all the people who had been instructed to come on Figaro's orders arrive, and the real Countess reveals herself. The Count falls to his knees and begs her for forgiveness, which she grants. After all other loose ends are tied up, the cast breaks into song before the curtain falls.\n\nOne of the defining moments of the play—and Louis XVI's particular objection to the piece—is Figaro's long monologue in the fifth act, directly challenging the Count:\n\n\n\n"}

A group of several-hundred kayakers would cross the Sound from Norwalk, Connecticut to the north shore of Long Island and return as they raise money for local and national charities.\n\nThe route for the crossing is 12.5 miles long and leaves from Calf Pasture Beach in East Norwalk, Connecticut and lands in Crab Meadow Park in Northport, New York. Depending on factors such as tides, current, and wind, the route can take an average paddler between two and four hours to complete.\n\nTo participate in the event, the organization required that paddlers be \"comfortable in very open waters\", and in reasonably good shape. All first-time participants were required to attend a kayak safety course a few weeks before the launch.\n\nEach year, the KFAC organization picked five charities in Connecticut and Long Island. In 2007, for instance, the charities were The Hole in the Wall Gang Camp, Outward Bound of Connecticut, Cancer Care of Connecticut, Courage to Speak Foundation, a drug prevention organization for children; and Save the Sound, an environmental organization. Paddlers could pick one to sponsor in the past, however, due to the growth of the event over time, it had become more logistically feasible for the board to elect on how to split donations among the selected charities.\n\nKayak for a Cause was started by Scott Carlin and Miles Spencer in Norwalk, Connecticut in August 2001. The pair were bet $50 to cross Long Island Sound in kayaks. They made it across (and back) and have yet to collect the $50 bet. Bragging about their accomplishment at a local bar, many of the patrons agreed that they would bet hundreds of dollars to see them do it again. They decided to decline the bets, but take the money and donate it to charity.\n\nFor the next two years they invited others on the annal trek and started raising funds for charities. In 2002 there were a total of eight participating paddlers and six news organizations covered the event, which also had a chase boat for safety.\n\nIn 2005, Nautica and \"GQ\" magazine approached Carlin and Spencer to suggest that the two companies become sponsors. Peter Hunsinger, vice president and publisher of GQ and a resident of nearby New Canaan, Connecticut, participated in the event as a kayaker. Land Rover and other companies also joined in. Corporate sponsorship, with its organization and publicity, helped the event to grow in one year from 45 in 2005 to 178 paddlers in 2006.\n\n, Kayak for a Cause raised more than half a million dollars for charity. The 2006 event had 303 participants which set a Guinness World Record for the most sea kayaks launched simultaneously. The last several years have included an after-party on Calf Pasture Beach in Norwalk, featuring a concert by big-name artists and a silent auction.\nThe 2007 event, had 313 participants and started at 7:30 a.m. on July 28, 2007, and was the first to use Veterans Park in East Norwalk rather than Calf Pasture Beach. The move came at the suggestion of Norwalk city officials and it allowed for expansion of the event, especially the late-afternoon and evening beach party. In 2007, the Neville Brothers and Ryan Shaw played at the charity carnival at the beach party. A total of 17 \"pasta parties\" were held in Fairfield County restaurants two nights before the event to bolster the participants.\nIn 2008 event returned to Calf Pasture Beach and featured the Wailers Band.\n\nIn 2009, the direction of the paddle was reversed and the group launched from Crab Meadow Beach in Huntington, Long Island and landed in Norwalk. Musical guests included Ryan Shaw and headliner Donavon Frankenreiter.\n\nIn 2010, the organization celebrated its tenth year, having escorted over 1,600 paddlers across the sound, recording over 20,000 donations and raising over $2,000,000 for local and national charities. The Beach Party featured Dickey Betts & Great Southern, with opening band Ten Feet Deep. Charities that received support since inception include Save the Sound, Hole in the Wall Gang, Cancer Care, Outward Bound, Canine Companions, Builders Beyond Borders, Make a Wish, Courage to Speak, and Cardinal Sheehan Youth Center.\n\nIn 2013, Kayak for a Cause elected to scuttle the fleet in a one-day kayak sale and donate the remaining proceeds to charities before changing its name and mission. The CAA Foundation intends to foster a unique community by providing networking, mentoring and resources for promising young entrepreneurs.\n\n"}

The case was one of the most sensational and widely reported of the first decade of the 20th century, involving three prominent leaders of the radical Western Federation of Miners as co-defendants in an alleged conspiracy to commit murder.\n\nAlbert Edward Horsley was born March 18, 1866, in Wooler, Ontario, Canada, the son of English and Irish parentage. One of eight children in a poor farm family, Albert was only able to attend formal school through the third grade, helping to support the family by working as soon as he was able. Albert worked as a farmhand for neighbors, either on a daily or monthly basis, with his parents receiving the income from his work until he was 20 years old.\nAt the age of 22, Horsley left home to work as a logger in Saginaw, Michigan. He returned to Canada and married around 1889. The Horsleys spent some time as cheesemakers, both independently and in the employ of others. His wife gave birth to a daughter, removing her from their cheese factory, while Albert later recalled that he \"lived away beyond my means, and was some in debt, and my credit was not so good.\"\n\nSeeking to run away with another woman, Horsley burned his cheese factory and collected the insurance money, thereby settling his debts. Horsley abandoned his family and, together with his girlfriend, headed west to Pilot Bay, about twenty miles from Nelson, British Columbia. The pair spent three months together there before they split up and went their separate ways, with Horsley landing in Spokane, Washington.\n\nIn April 1897 Horsley was employed driving a milk wagon to the mining communities around Wallace, Idaho. He worked steadily through 1897, saving his money so that he was able to invest $500 for a 1/16 share of the Hercules silver mine near the town of Burke towards the end of the year. Horsley then quit his milk route and moved to Burke, borrowing money to buy a wood and coal business there. In the spring of 1898 Horsley had to sell his share of the Hercules mine in order to pay the debts he had incurred, also taking a partner into his business to raise funds. His accumulated gambling debts forced him to sell out his share of his business in March 1899, and he had to take a job as a \"mucker\" (shoveler) in the Tiger-Poorman mine near Burke. It was in this way that Horsley joined the Western Federation of Miners.\n\nOver the next few years Horsley worked as a miner in various locales throughout the American West. He later recalled in his autobiography:During all this time I did not save any money, though I worked nearly all the time and always got the highest wages... I made many good resolutions and often saved up a few hundred dollars and thought I would get into some little business for myself. When I would get away from town, as I often did, in some out-of-the-way place, I would save my money and make good resolutions; but how soon I would forget them when I would strike town and see a faro game running, or a game of poker. My money would burn my pocket. There were many other attractions, and money always soon got away. I always bought plenty of good clothes and lived well.\"\n\nOrchard confessed to numerous crimes having nothing to do with labor conflicts. He admitted that he was a bigamist, having abandoned wives in Canada and Cripple Creek. He had burned businesses for the insurance money in Cripple Creek and Canada. Orchard had burglarized a railroad depot, rifled a cash register, stole sheep, and had made plans to kidnap children over a debt. He also sold fraudulent insurance policies.\n\nOrchard confessed to playing a violent, and ultimately, decisive, role in the Colorado Labor Wars. Orchard's confession to McParland claimed responsibility for seventeen or more murders.\n\nOrchard described in his confession that during the Cripple Creek miners' strike he told a railroad detective that the WFM was planning to derail a train along a certain section of track, for which the detective gave him $45 and a train ticket to Denver. According to Orchard, he informed out of jealousy that the WFM had not hired him to do the job; he said that he did not provide any further information. He reportedly told a companion, G.L. Brokaw, that he had been a Pinkerton employee for some time.\n\nOn December 30, 1905, Frank Steunenberg, former Governor of Idaho, was killed by a bomb rigged to the gate of his house in Caldwell. After midnight on the evening of Steunenberg's murder, Harry Orchard (as Tom Hogan) walked with Clinton Wood, the desk clerk at the hotel in Caldwell, to the site of the assassination at 1602 Dearborn Street (), now hours past. Although he didn't seem to know the way to the murder scene, Orchard expressed the belief that the governor had been given a \"big wad\" of money by Idaho mine owners after he had left office. Such a view was common among miners, as reflected in a 1908 union pamphlet on the 1899 Coeur d'Alene mine strike.\n\nWithin an hour of the explosion, the sheriff had deputized 100 townspeople, and stationed them at all roads and paths leading out of town. Orchard made no effort to escape, and slept in his hotel room that night in Caldwell. The next day, Sunday, December 31, he was suspected and placed under parole, and was arrested for the assassination on New Year's Day. He raised suspicion when a detective for the Mine Owners' Association recognized him as \"Orchard\"; he responded that his name was \"Hogan\"; and, it was discovered that he was registered at the Saratoga Hotel. When his room #19 was searched, evidence related to the murder was discovered. Aside from using aliases, Orchard made little attempt to conceal his activities. Historian Melvyn Dubofsky has theorized that Orchard may have suffered from a \"psychotic personality disorder\" that caused him not only to engage in a life of violence, but also, perhaps subconsciously, to set up the circumstances of his own arrest.\n\nOrchard testified that he had made numerous attempts on Steunenberg's life. In the week between Christmas and New Year's, Steunenberg had spent several days in Boise on business and returned to Caldwell on Friday the 29th, and had renewed an insurance policy on Saturday afternoon and stopped off at the Saratoga Hotel to talk with friends before returning home. Minutes before his death, Steunenberg had been sitting in the hotel, so Orchard retrieved the bomb from his room and rushed out to the residence to set it, about a dozen blocks away. On his way back to the hotel, Orchard met the governor two blocks from the house, and the explosion occurred shortly after as Orchard was running to the hotel. The fatal bomb was detonated by rigging the gate so that as it was opened, a bottle of sulfuric acid was spilled onto giant blasting caps. A blasting cap exploded in Orchard's pocket when he was back in his room. He stayed at the hotel until his Monday arrest. Errant first reports had surmised the device was wire-tripped by the assassin and used nitroglycerin.\n\nFacing the death penalty by hanging, Orchard made a confession to Pinkerton detective James McParland in the Frank Steunenberg assassination, confessing as well to the murders of at least sixteen other people. Orchard testified that the murder of Steunenberg was ordered by William Dudley Haywood, Charles Moyer and George Pettibone, all leaders of the Western Federation of Miners. The prosecution alleged that the union leaders had plotted to kill Steunenberg in retaliation for the ex-governor's severe measures against union miners, including a declaration of martial law, following violent incidents during a labor struggle in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho.\n\nProsecutors selected Haywood as the first of the three defendants to stand trial, thinking him the most vulnerable. His gnarled physical appearance, being blind in one eye, combined with his propensity to use politically radical language, made Haywood more likely to be associated with conspiracy and murder in the minds of the jurors, the prosecution believed. Under Idaho law, jurors were instructed to consider only those parts of Orchard's testimony that were corroborated by other evidence. This was especially difficult because a WFM official who had stayed with Orchard in Idaho had disappeared, and could not be found. The prosecution hoped to corroborate other parts of Orchard's testimony with the confession of Steve Adams, but Adams renounced his confession, claiming that it had been coerced.\n\nThe prosecution acted with significant support and direction from Agent McParland, and with assistance from Governor Gooding. Chief prosecuting attorneys were William Borah and James H. Hawley, who were paid in part by money secretly supplied by western mine operators and industrialists. Orchard's testimony was persuasive to reporters attending the trial.\n\nDuring the trial, \"McClure's\" magazine proposed to Governor Gooding that the magazine serialize Orchard's confession and autobiography. McParland wanted maximum publicity for Orchard's confession, but he was reluctant to allow \"McClure's\" requirement that they be allowed extensive access to Orchard to go over the document with him, in order to clarify and fill in parts of his story. McParland objected that giving access to \"McClure's\" would anger the rest of the press corps, who had been denied access. Governor Gooding interceded with McParland, and McClure's was given exclusive access to Orchard. The first installment of the \"Confession and Autobiography of Harry Orchard\" came out in the July 1907 \"McClure's\", while the trial was still ongoing, and continued through the November 1907 issue.\n\nThe defense argued that Orchard had his own, personal motive for murdering Steunenberg. Defense attorneys Clarence Darrow and Edmund F. Richardson argued that if Orchard hadn't been forced to sell his one-sixteenth share of the mine because of the martial law decree, he would have become wealthy. Orchard had denied the accusation. The Haywood defense team produced five witnesses from three states who testified that Orchard had told them about his anger at Steunenberg. Several of them stated that Orchard had vowed to seek revenge against the former Idaho governor. However, the prosecution presented evidence that Orchard had sold his share of the mine before the labor troubles began. Darrow later observed the date of the sale didn't seem to matter to Orchard; he \"tried to sell this interest (again) a year after he had disposed of it.\" \n\nThe defense presented evidence of extensive infiltration, spying, and sabotage of the WFM by the Pinkertons. One witness was Morris Friedman, James McParland's former stenographer. Haywood testified in his own defense, and he stood up well under five hours of cross-examination. Then the defense presented what they claimed was \"startling new evidence\" about insanity in Orchard's family, including a grandfather who needed to be \"chained up\" and an uncle who went insane. Orchard admitted that one of his uncles was \"demented\" over family problems and had hanged himself, but testified to knowing nothing about his maternal grandfather, who died before his birth.\n\nFremont Wood, the presiding judge in both the Haywood and Pettibone trials, was highly impressed by the way Orchard held up under prolonged and severe cross-examination in each trial, and believed Orchard's testimony to be true. In Wood's experience, no one could have fabricated such a convoluted story, covering many years, in many locations, and including so many different people, and withstand such thorough cross-examination without materially contradicting himself. Wood later wrote that the prosecution case did not convincingly corroborate Orchard's testimony, but that the witnesses put on by the defense actually did a better job corroborating Orchard than the prosecution had done.\n\nEven before Darrow's closing argument in the Haywood case, it was clear that the prosecution was in trouble. The prosecution relied on Orchard's testimony to make its case against the WFM leader, but the defense maintained that Orchard had confessed to crimes he could not have committed.\n\nThe state of Idaho had provided Orchard with \"a library of religious tracts\", which may have influenced his announced conversion to religious belief. Some analysts at the trial later opined \"the prosecution let Orchard get away from the facts and his testimony turned into a syrupy story of repentance, religion, and God's mercy to sinners, which had the effect of turning everyone's stomach.\"\n\nIdaho law required that the testimony of a confessed murderer must be independently corroborated by other evidence in order to convict others of murder. The Idaho jury found Haywood not guilty. One juror told a reporter, \"There was nothing against the accused but inference and suspicion.\" Pettibone was found not guilty in a separate trial, after the defense declined to argue the case. Charges against Moyer were dropped.\n\nSteve Adams was tried in three separate trials, resulting in two hung juries in Idaho, and an acquittal in Colorado.\n\nAfter the rest were acquitted and/or released, Orchard was tried alone. He changed his plea to guilty in March 1908 and received a death sentence in Idaho for the murder of Steunenberg. An appeal was made by the prosecution to Idaho Governor Gooding, urging the commutation of Orchard's death sentence for his previous cooperation in the trials of the union leaders. This request was granted and Orchard's sentence was commuted to life in prison, a decision that was widely lampooned in the press.\n\nSoon after receiving his sentence, Orchard converted to Seventh-day Adventism. His multiple pleas for a pardon over the years were all denied. He never recanted his confession, and in 1952, at 86 years of age and 45 years after the Haywood trial, Orchard wrote in his autobiography that all of his confession and his trial testimony were true.\n\nOrchard died in the state penitentiary in Boise on April 13, 1954, aged 88, over 48 years after his arrest. After his sentencing in March 1908, he served more than 46 years at the Old Idaho State Penitentiary, its longest-ever term, and is buried in Morris Hill Cemetery in Boise. As a trustee, he had lived outside the prison walls in a small house for most of his later years, tending the prison's poultry flocks, but was brought back after he had suffered a mild stroke a year earlier. Orchard was bedridden for his last three months and in a coma for his last days.\n\n\n\n"}

Sometimes referred to as the \"Dewey Decimal System\" of building construction, MasterFormat is a product of the Construction Specifications Institute (CSI) and Construction Specifications Canada (CSC). It provides a master list of Divisions, and Section numbers with associated titles within each Division, to organize information about a facility’s construction requirements and associated activities.\n\nMasterFormat is used throughout the construction industry to format specifications for construction contract documents. The purpose of this format is to assist the user in organizing information into distinct groups when creating contract documents, and to assist the user searching for specific information in consistent locations. The information contained in MasterFormat is organized in a standardized outline format within 50 Divisions (16 Divisions pre-2004). Each Division is subdivided into a number of Sections. \n\nAfter World War II, building construction specifications began to expand, as more advanced materials and choices were made available. The Construction Specifications Institute (CSI) was founded in 1948 and began to address the organization of specifications into a numbering system. In 1963, they published a format for construction specifications, with 16 major divisions of work. A 1975 CSI publication used the term MasterFormat. The last CSI MasterFormat publication to use the 16 divisions was in 1995, and this is no longer supported by CSI. In November 2004, MasterFormat expanded from 16 Divisions to 50 Divisions, reflecting innovations in the construction industry and expanding the coverage to a larger part of the construction industry. Revised editions were published in 2010, 2011, 2012, 2014, 2016, and 2018. \n\n\nStandardizing the presentation of such information improves communication among all parties involved in construction projects, which helps the project team deliver structures to owners according to their requirements, timelines, and budgets.

In contrast with Hilbert's other 22 problems, his 23rd is not so much a specific \"problem\" as an encouragement towards further development of the calculus of variations. His statement of the problem is a summary of the state-of-the-art (in 1900) of the theory of calculus of variations, with some introductory comments decrying the lack of work that had been done of the theory in the mid to late 19th century.\n\nThe problem statement begins with the following paragraph:\n\nSo far, I have generally mentioned problems as definite and special as possible... Nevertheless, I should like to close with a general problem, namely with the indication of a branch of mathematics repeatedly mentioned in this lecture-which, in spite of the considerable advancement lately given it by Weierstrass, does not receive the general appreciation which, in my opinion, it is due-I mean the calculus of variations.\n\nCalculus of variations is a field of mathematical analysis that deals with maximizing or minimizing functionals, which are mappings from a set of functions to the real numbers. Functionals are often expressed as definite integrals involving functions and their derivatives. The interest is in \"extremal\" functions that make the functional attain a maximum or minimum value – or \"stationary\" functions – those where the rate of change of the functional is zero.\n\nFollowing the problem statement, David Hilbert, Emmy Noether, Leonida Tonelli, Henri Lebesgue and Jacques Hadamard among others made significant contributions to the calculus of variations. Marston Morse applied calculus of variations in what is now called Morse theory. Lev Pontryagin, Ralph Rockafellar and F. H. Clarke developed new mathematical tools for the calculus of variations in optimal control theory. The dynamic programming of Richard Bellman is an alternative to the calculus of variations.\n"}
{"id": "2336109", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2336109", "title": "Frame fields in general relativity", "text": "Frame fields in general relativity\n\nIn general relativity, a frame field (also called a tetrad or vierbein) is a set of four orthonormal vector fields, one timelike and three spacelike, defined on a Lorentzian manifold that is physically interpreted as a model of spacetime. The timelike unit vector field is often denoted by formula_1 and the three spacelike unit vector fields by formula_2. All tensorial quantities defined on the manifold can be expressed using the frame field and its dual coframe field.\n\nFrames were introduced into general relativity by Hermann Weyl in 1929.\n\nThe index notation for tetrads is explained in tetrad (index notation).\n\nFrame fields always correspond to a family of ideal observers immersed in the given spacetime; the integral curves of the timelike unit vector field are the worldlines of these observers, and at each event along a given worldline, the three spacelike unit vector fields specify the spatial triad carried by the observer. The triad may be thought of as defining the spatial coordinate axes of a local \"laboratory frame\", which is valid very near the observer's worldline.\n\nIn general, the worldlines of these observers need not be timelike geodesics. If any of the worldlines bends away from a geodesic path in some region, we can think of the observers as test particles that accelerate by using ideal rocket engines with a thrust equal to the magnitude of their acceleration vector. Alternatively, if our observer is attached to a bit of matter in a ball of fluid in hydrostatic equilibrium, this bit of matter will in general be accelerated outward by the net effect of pressure holding up the fluid ball against the attraction of its own gravity. Other possibilities include an observer attached to a free charged test particle in an electrovacuum solution, which will of course be accelerated by the Lorentz force, or an observer attached to a \"spinning\" test particle, which may be accelerated by a spin–spin force.\n\nIt is important to recognize that frames are \"geometric objects\". That is, vector fields make sense (in a smooth manifold) independently of choice of a coordinate chart, and (in a Lorentzian manifold), so do the notions of orthogonality and length. Thus, just like vector fields and other geometric quantities, frame fields can be represented in various coordinate charts. Computations of the components of tensorial quantities, with respect to a given frame, will always yield the \"same\" result, whichever coordinate chart is used to represent the frame.\n\nThese fields are required to write the Dirac equation in curved spacetime.\n\nTo write down a frame, a coordinate chart on the Lorentzian manifold needs to be chosen. Then, every vector field on the manifold can be written down as a linear combination of the four coordinate basis vector fields:\nHere, the Einstein summation convention is used, and the vector fields are thought of as first order linear differential operators, and the components formula_4 are often called contravariant components. This follows the standard notational conventions for sections of a tangent bundle. Alternative notations for the coordinate basis vector fields in common use are formula_5\n\nIn particular, the vector fields in the frame can be expressed this way:\nIn \"designing\" a frame, one naturally needs to ensure, using the given metric, that the four vector fields are everywhere orthonormal.\n\nMore modern texts adopt the notation formula_7 for formula_8 and formula_9 or formula_10 for formula_11. This permits the visually clever trick of writing the spacetime metric as the inner product of the coordinate tangent vectors:\nand the flat-space Minkowski metric as the product of the gammas:\nThe choice of formula_9 for the notation is an intentional conflation with the notation used for the Dirac matrices; it allows the formula_9 to be taken not only as vectors, but as elements of an algebra, the spacetime algebra. Appropriately used, this can simplify some of the notation used in writing a spin connection.\n\nOnce a signature is adopted, by duality every \"vector\" of a basis has a dual \"covector\" in the cobasis and conversely. Thus, every \"frame field\" is associated with a unique \"coframe field\", and vice versa; a coframe fields is a set of four orthogonal sections of the cotangent bundle.\n\nAlternatively, the metric tensor can be specified by writing down a coframe in terms of a coordinate basis and stipulating that the metric tensor is given by\nwhere formula_17 denotes tensor product.\nThis is just a fancy way of saying that the coframe is \"orthonormal\". Whether this is used to obtain the metric tensor after writing down the frame (and passing to the dual coframe), or starting with the metric tensor and using it to verify that a frame has been obtained by other means, it must always hold true.\n\nThe vierbein field, formula_18, has two kinds of indices: formula_19 labels the general spacetime coordinate and formula_20 labels the local Lorentz spacetime or local laboratory coordinates.\n\nThe vierbein field or frame fields can be regarded as the “matrix square root” of the metric tensor, formula_21, since in a coordinate basis,\nwhere formula_23 is the Lorentz metric.\n\nLocal Lorentz indices are raised and lowered with the Lorentz metric in the same way as general spacetime coordinates are raised and lowered with the metric tensor. For example:\n\nThe vierbein field enables conversion between spacetime and local Lorentz indices. For example:\n\nThe vierbein field itself can be manipulated in the same fashion:\n\nAnd these can combine.\n\nA few more examples: Spacetime and local Lorentz coordinates can be mixed together:\n\nThe local Lorentz coordinates transform differently from the general spacetime coordinates. Under a general coordinate transformation we have:\n\nwhilst under a local Lorentz transformation we have:\n\nCoordinate basis vectors have the special property that their Lie brackets pairwise vanish. Except in locally flat regions, at least some Lie brackets of vector fields from a frame will \"not\" vanish. The resulting baggage needed to compute with them is acceptable, as components of tensorial objects with respect to a frame (but not with respect to a coordinate basis) have a direct interpretation in terms of measurements made by the family of ideal observers corresponding to the frame.\n\nCoordinate basis vectors can very well be null, which, by definition, cannot happen for frame vectors.\n\nSome frames are nicer than others. Particularly in vacuum or electrovacuum solutions, the physical experience of inertial observers (who feel no forces) may be of particular interest. The mathematical characterization of an inertial frame is very simple: the integral curves of the timelike unit vector field must define a geodesic congruence, or in other words, its acceleration vector must vanish:\n\nIt is also often desirable to ensure that the spatial triad carried by each observer does not rotate. In this case, the triad can be viewed as being gyrostabilized. The criterion for a nonspinning inertial (NSI) frame is again very simple:\nThis says that as we move along the worldline of each observer, their spatial triad is parallel-transported. Nonspinning inertial frames hold a special place in general relativity, because they are as close as we can get in a curved Lorentzian manifold to the Lorentz frames used in special relativity (these are special nonspinning inertial frames in the Minkowski vacuum).\n\nMore generally, if the acceleration of our observers is nonzero, formula_34, we can replace the covariant derivatives \nwith the (spatially projected) Fermi–Walker derivatives to define a nonspinning frame.\n\nGiven a Lorentzian manifold, we can find infinitely many frame fields, even if we require additional properties such as inertial motion. However, a given frame field might very well be defined on only part of the manifold.\n\nIt will be instructive to consider in some detail a few simple examples. Consider the famous Schwarzschild vacuum that models spacetime outside an isolated nonspinning spherically symmetric massive object, such as a star. In most textbooks one finds the metric tensor written in terms of a static polar spherical chart, as follows:\nMore formally, the metric tensor can be expanded with respect to the coordinate cobasis as\nA coframe can be read off from this expression:\nTo see that this coframe really does correspond to the Schwarzschild metric tensor, just plug this coframe into\n\nThe frame dual is the transposed coframe inverted as\n(The plus sign on formula_42 ensures that formula_1 is \"future pointing\".) This is the frame that models the experience of static observers who use rocket engines to \"\"hover\" over the massive object\".\nThe thrust they require to maintain their position is given by the magnitude of the acceleration vector\nThis is radially inward pointing, since the observers need to accelerate \"away\" from the object to avoid falling toward it. On the other hand, the spatially projected Fermi derivatives of the spatial basis vectors (with respect to formula_1) vanish, so this is a nonspinning frame.\n\nThe components of various tensorial quantities with respect to our frame and its dual coframe can now be computed.\n\nFor example, the tidal tensor for our static observers is defined using tensor notation (for a coordinate basis) as\nwhere we write formula_47 to avoid cluttering the notation. Its only non-zero components with respect to our coframe turn out to be\nThe corresponding coordinate basis components are\n\nCompare the tidal tensor formula_52 of Newtonian gravity, which is the traceless part of the Hessian of the gravitational potential formula_53. Using tensor notation for a tensor field defined on three-dimensional euclidean space, this can be written\nThe reader may wish to crank this through (notice that the trace term actually vanishes identically when U is harmonic) and compare results with the following elementary approach:\nwe can compare the gravitational forces on two nearby observers lying on the same radial line:\nBecause in discussing tensors we are dealing with multilinear algebra, we retain only first order terms, so formula_56. Similarly, we can compare the gravitational force on two nearby observers lying on the same sphere formula_57. Using some elementary trigonometry and the small angle approximation, we find that the force vectors differ by a vector tangent to the sphere which has magnitude\nBy using the small angle approximation, we have ignored all terms of order formula_59, so the tangential components are formula_60. Here, we are referring to the obvious frame obtained from the polar spherical chart for our three-dimensional euclidean space:\n\nPlainly, the coordinate components formula_62 computed above don't even scale the right way, so they clearly cannot correspond to what an observer will measure even approximately. (By coincidence, the Newtonian tidal tensor components agree exactly with the relativistic tidal tensor components we wrote out above.)\n\nTo find an inertial frame, we can boost our static frame in the formula_63 direction by an undetermined boost parameter (depending on the radial coordinate), compute the acceleration vector of the new undetermined frame, set this equal to zero, and solve for the unknown boost parameter. The result will be a frame which we can use to study the physical experience of observers who fall freely and radially toward the massive object. By appropriately choosing an integration constant, we obtain the frame of Lemaître observers, who fall in \"from rest at spatial infinity\". (This phrase doesn't make sense, but the reader will no doubt have no difficulty in understanding our meaning.) In the static polar spherical chart, this frame is obtained from Lemaître coordinates and can be written as\nNote that\nformula_68, and that formula_69 \"leans inwards\", as it should, since its integral curves are timelike geodesics representing the world lines of \"infalling\" observers. Indeed, since the covariant derivatives of all four basis vectors (taken with respect to formula_1) vanish identically, our new frame is a \"nonspinning inertial frame\".\n\nIf our massive object is in fact a (nonrotating) black hole, we probably wish to follow the experience of the Lemaître observers as they fall through the event horizon at formula_71. Since the static polar spherical coordinates have a coordinate singularity at the horizon, we'll need to switch to a more appropriate coordinate chart. The simplest possible choice is to define a new time coordinate by\nThis gives the Painlevé chart. The new line element is\nWith respect to the Painlevé chart, the Lemaître frame is\nNotice that their spatial triad looks exactly like the frame for three-dimensional euclidean space which we mentioned above (when we computed the Newtonian tidal tensor). Indeed, the spatial hyperslices formula_79 turn out to be locally isometric to flat three-dimensional euclidean space! (This is a remarkable and rather special property of the Schwarzschild vacuum; most spacetimes do not admit a slicing into flat spatial sections.)\n\nThe tidal tensor taken with respect to the Lemaître observers is\nwhere we write formula_81 to avoid cluttering the notation. This is a \"different tensor\" from the one we obtained above, because it is defined using a \"different family of observers\". Nonetheless, its nonvanishing components look familiar: formula_82. (This is again a rather special property of the Schwarzschild vacuum.)\n\nNotice that there is simply no way of defining static observers on or inside the event horizon. On the other hand, the Lemaître observers are not defined on the entire \"exterior region\" covered by the static polar spherical chart either, so in these examples, neither the Lemaître frame nor the static frame are defined on the entire manifold.\n\nIn the same way that we found the Lemaître observers, we can boost our static frame in the formula_83 direction by an undetermined parameter (depending on the radial coordinate), compute the acceleration vector, and require that this vanish \"in the equatorial plane\" formula_84. The new Hagihara frame describes the physical experience of observers in \"stable circular orbits\" around our massive object. It was apparently first discussed by the astronomer Yusuke Hagihara.\n\nIn the static polar spherical chart, the Hagihara frame is\nwhich in the equatorial plane becomes\nThe tidal tensor formula_93 where formula_94 turns out to be given (in the equatorial plane) by\nThus, compared to a static observer hovering at a given coordinate radius,\na Hagihara observer in a stable circular orbit with the same coordinate radius will measure \"radial\" tidal forces which are slightly \"larger\" in magnitude, and \"transverse\" tidal forces which are no longer isotropic (but slightly larger orthogonal to the direction of motion).\n\nNote that the Hagihara frame is only defined on the region formula_98. Indeed, stable circular orbits only exist on formula_99, so the frame should not be used inside this locus.\n\nComputing Fermi derivatives shows that the frame field just given is in fact \"spinning\" with respect to a gyrostabilized frame. The principal reason why is easy to spot: in this frame, each Hagihara observer keeps his spatial vectors \"radially aligned\", so formula_100 rotate about formula_101 as the observer orbits around the central massive object. However, after correcting for this observation, a small precession of the spin axis of a gyroscope carried by a Hagihara observer still remains; this is the \"de Sitter precession\" effect (also called the \"geodetic precession\" effect).\n\nThis article has focused on the application of frames to general relativity, and particularly on their physical interpretation. Here we very briefly outline the general concept. In an \"n\"-dimensional Riemannian manifold or pseudo-Riemannian manifold, a frame field is a set of orthonormal vector fields which forms a basis for the tangent space at each point in the manifold. This is possible globally in a continuous fashion if and only if the manifold is parallelizable. As before, frames can be specified in terms of a given coordinate basis, and in a non-flat region, some of their pairwise Lie brackets will fail to vanish.\n\nIn fact, given any inner-product space formula_102, we can define a new space consisting of all tuples of orthonormal bases for formula_102. Applying this construction to each tangent space yields the orthonormal frame bundle of a (pseudo-)Riemannian manifold and a frame field is a section of this bundle. More generally still, we can consider frame bundles associated to any vector bundle, or even arbitrary principal fiber bundles. The notation becomes a bit more involved because it is harder to avoid distinguishing between indices referring to the base, and indices referring to the fiber. Many authors speak of internal components when referring to components indexed by the fiber.\n\n\n"}

The generalization of this fundamental theorem to any analytic non-algebraic relations whatever between two variables has likewise been attempted with success by Poincaré, though by a way entirely different from that which served him in the special problem first mentioned. From Poincaré's proof of the possibility of reducing to uniformity an arbitrary analytic relation between two variables, however, it does not become apparent whether the resolving functions can be determined to meet certain additional conditions. Namely, it is not shown whether the two single valued functions of the one new variable can be so chosen that, while this variable traverses the regular domain of those functions, the totality of all regular points of the given analytic field are actually reached and represented. On the contrary it seems to be the case, from Poincaré's investigations, that there are beside the branch points certain others, in general infinitely many other discrete exceptional points of the analytic field, that can be reached only by making the new variable approach certain limiting points of the functions. In view of the fundamental importance of Poincaré's formulation of the question it seems to me that an elucidation and resolution of this difficulty is extremely desirable.\n\nIn conjunction with this problem comes up the problem of reducing to uniformity an algebraic or any other analytic relation among three or more complex variables—a problem which is known to be solvable in many particular cases. Toward the solution of this the recent investigations of Picard on algebraic functions of two variables are to be regarded as welcome and important preliminary studies.\n\nKoebe proved the general uniformization theorem that if a Riemann surface is homeomorphic to an open subset of the complex sphere (or equivalently if every Jordan curve separates it), then it is conformally equivalent to an open subset of the complex sphere.\n\nThis problem is currently open. Some progress has been made by Griffith and Bers.\n"}

{"id": "2336126", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2336126", "title": "Today We Choose Faces", "text": "Today We Choose Faces\n\nToday We Choose Faces is a 1973 science fiction novel by American writer Roger Zelazny. As originally constructed, Part 1 was an extensive flashback which followed Part 2, but the order of the sections was changed at the request of editor David Hartwell, who felt that the novel worked better in chronological order. Zelazny later wrote, “I was younger then & more in need of the money at the time & couldn’t afford to argue [with] him about it. I still prefer it the way I wrote it.” \n\nThe story is set, like many Zelazny pure science fiction novels, a few centuries in the future. The narrator, a Mafia assassin named Angelo di Negri, has been revived from suspended animation by the mostly legitimate successors of the criminal organization, and given a mission to assassinate a scientist on a fortified facility on an otherwise uninhabited planet.\n\nThe first part of the novel describes Negri's assault on the planet, in which he begins the attack in a heavily armed and armored space capsule, which is gradually reduced by the formidable defenses to a ground-attack vehicle, which in turn is slowly degraded until Negri abandons it to continue on foot with hand-held weapons, eventually left only with a stiletto.\n\nAfter he completes the job, the phone rings. This is a motif throughout the story. His victim has managed to survive even the death of his body, and tells Negri that while they were fighting, war has taken place and humanity is near extinction. Only the technology in another building can preserve the remnants. Negri locates the cache, and sets out on the next phase of his story.\n\nDespite also being in the first person, the next part of the novel appears to have nothing to do with Negri. The narrator is a member of some secret cabal scattered throughout the House, a series of artificial environments where people live, never seeing the outdoors. It seems this cabal is in charge of the House, and someone is killing the members one by one.\n\nEach death jolts the others, so they are evidently clones. (As described earlier in the novel, cloning can be accomplished, although clones have some unexplained psychic connection to each other). One of the cabal is the Nexus, the one who can interface with the computer that seems to run everything. Each time a Nexus is killed his consciousness transfers to another member. The narration passes from one Nexus to the next as the killer works his way through his list. Each one gets the memories of his predecessor at the moment of death.\n\nThe House has Wings, different sections, connected by Passages, which may really be wormholes in space. Some Wings are residential, some offices, some manufacturing, some maintenance etc. There are also levels within Wings. Wing Null is where the computer is, and also where a series of pins in a circuit board represent stages in the cabal's cleansing of evil instincts and bad memories from its collective personality. This mirrors the avowed purpose of the House - to rid humanity of all the traits which brought about its downfall, so it is fit to be let loose once more. This involves occasionally removing people with undesirable characteristics, in the effort to breed a better human.\n\nThe narrator has to deal with an internal demon, a voice that tries to get him to remove the most recent pin. Old memories are not entirely suppressed and manifest themselves in this way. As the menace from the killer - now known as Mr. Black, grows, the voice becomes more persistent until one by one the pins are removed, revealing more about the history of the cabal.\n\nThe narrator is further dogged by a woman, whose father was forced to commit suicide by the cabal to suppress an unwanted technology, and who seems to know Mr. Black. This section of the story features running battles through offices, factories and service tunnels, as the narrator hunts and is hunted by Mr. Black. In one scene the narrator is attempting to escape through offices, and as he passes each desk the phone rings in some mocking version of the pursuit.\n\nAs the pins are removed the narrator becomes a more capable hunter, and more ruthless. Finally the narrator kills Black, who dies with a smile on his face. It quickly becomes obvious why. Black is another clone, and his personality transfers to one of the cabal.\n\nThe narrator fights off the transfer, but realizes that in doing so he has allowed Black to take over one of the others, who are all in Wing Null. Arriving there with the woman in tow, he finds that all but one are dead, and Black has escaped to the Outside. He has also pulled all but the last pin. In a final fight across the same blasted landscape where Negri attacked in the beginning, Black kills the narrator, but then has to deal with the inevitable transfer.\n\nBlack becomes the new narrator. He was a stolen clone, but he did not remember his origins. He simply lived in the cracks in the House society, somehow being helped by an unknown party. He eventually became the cabal's nemesis, intent on opening the House and setting humanity free again. But now he is the cabal, with all their conflicting memories and motives. He has to fight his way back to Wing Null, dealing with all the old defenses again.\n\nIt becomes obvious that the clones are all related to Angelo Negri. With the pulling of the final pin, Negri's personality is restored. He realizes that the House is a failure. The only thing left to do is to break open the various Wings and shut down the computer. This he does. For the last time, the phone rings. The woman answers. It is the disembodied scientist, who has been manipulating events all along.\n\nNegri tells the woman to take a message.\n\nThe protagonist's name is Angelo di Negri, which means \"Angel of Blacks\" in Italian. All of his 12 clones have names which allude to Black, or Angel, or are anagrams Angel. For example, Engel (German for \"angel\"), Lange (anagram of \"angel\"), Winkel (German for \"angle\", an anagram of angel), Jordan (the angel in \"Here Comes Mister Jordan\"), etc. The complete list is shown in the biography within \"The Collected Stories of Roger Zelazny Volume 3: This Mortal Mountain\".\n"}

The CKO is responsible for managing intellectual capital and the custodian of Knowledge Management practices in an organization. CKO is not just a relabelling of the title \"chief information officer\" - the CKO role is much broader. CKOs can help an organization maximize the returns on investment in knowledge (people, processes and intellectual capital), exploit their intangible assets (know-how, patents, customer relationships), repeat successes, share best practices, improve innovation, and avoid knowledge loss after organizational restructuring.\n\nCKOs must have skills across a wide variety of areas. They must be good at developing/understanding the big picture, advocacy (articulation, promotion and justification of the knowledge agenda, sometimes against cynicism or even open hostility), project and people management (oversight of a variety of activities, attention to detail, ability to motivate), communications (communicating clearly the knowledge agenda, have good listening skills and be sensitive to organizational opportunities and obstacles), leadership, teamworking, influencing, and interpersonal skills. The CKO who successfully combines these skills is well equipped as an excellent agent of change for their organization.\n\nOther terms for CKO include knowledge manager, director of intellectual capital (e.g. Scandia), director of knowledge transfer (e.g. Buckman Laboratories), and knowledge asset manager (e.g. Dow Chemical).\n\nCKO responsibilities include such things as:\n\nSunassee and Sewry argued that top management needs to create and share a vision for the knowledge management initiative. The vision is the long-term strategy that will drive the knowledge management initiative and provide the scope within which the knowledge management effort and the organization will grow. The vision should also encompass the core beliefs and values of the organization.\n\nThe creation of the vision can be done in two ways. Top management can either appoint a Chief Knowledge Officer (CKO), who will create the vision, or they can create a vision and entrust the CKO to carry it out. It is extremely important at this point that the employees of the organization are allowed to share in the making of vision of the organization. This will create a sense of belonging for the employees, and allow them to participate in the change process. It will also make them accept the change process more readily than if they were not allowed to participate in it.\n\nThe views of the employees in the organisations should be considered and there should be a proper system created to share the views.\n\nSunassee and Sewry proposed a \"knowledge life-cycle\" to create and maintain individual and organizational learning in the organization:\n\n\nThe CKO should actively manage all stages of the \"knowledge life-cycle\", but most importantly encourage people to disseminate knowledge, and to use it. The last step of the cycle involves re-evaluating assumptions held by the organization and using these new assumptions with the knowledge created by the organization to create new knowledge. This process will generate innovative knowledge and allow the organization to produce innovative products and business processes.\n\n\n\n"}

Not initially an active supporter of the exiled Stuarts, Lord Kenmure became the leader of the Lowlands nobles, who opposed the Act of Union in 1701.\n\nAbsenting himself from parliament, early in Queen Anne's reign, the sixth Viscount Kenmure was deeply involved in plotting for a Jacobite rising and French invasion. Late in 1705, he was chosen by Lowlands Jacobites as a delegate to St Germain, although he did not travel there. Early in 1706 he claimed that disaffection was driving the Galloway Cameronians into Jacobitism. In 1707 he was one of the Jacobite peers for whose conduct David Murray, fifth Viscount Stormont, answered to Colonel Nathaniel Hooke, envoy from St Germain. In the same year, James Francis Edward Stuart granted him a marquessate. In 1711, he married Mary (d. 1776), daughter of Sir John Dalzell, 2nd Baronet (d. 1698), sister of Robert Dalzell, 5th Earl of Carnwath, and niece of Captain James Dalzell, his long-time Jacobite friend.

{"id": "2336151", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2336151", "title": "Geographical usage of television", "text": "Geographical usage of television\n\nThe geographical usage of television varies around the world with a number of different transmission standards in use and differing approaches by government in relation to ownership and programme content.\n\nDespite being the most economically advanced country on the continent, South Africa did not introduce TV until 1976, owing to opposition from the apartheid regime. Nigeria was one of the first countries in Africa to introduce television, in 1959, followed by Zimbabwe (then Rhodesia) in 1961, while Zanzibar was the first in Africa to introduce colour television, in 1973. (Tanzania itself did not introduce television until 1994).\nThe main satellite TV providers are the South African Multichoice DStv service, and the predominantly French language Canal Horizons, owned by France's Canal Plus.\n\nIn Asia, television has traditionally been state-controlled, although the number of private stations is increasing, as is competition from satellite and cable television. Japan's NHK is a non-commercial network similar to the BBC, funded by a television license fee, and has more editorial independence over news and current affairs than broadcasters like India's state-run Doordarshan or China's China Central Television (CCTV). In Malaysia, television was dominated by Radio Televisyen Malaysia (RTM), a government-owned agency, from 1963 until 1984. From 1984, however, private television stations started emerging, with TV3 being the only private broadcaster for ten years until the introduction of MetroVision, which was operated between 1995 and 1999. As of December 2013, there are 5 private stations and 3 government-owned ones in the country. Even though TV Alhijrah and WBC has begun broadcasting in recent years, RTM and Media Prima still controls most of the free-to-air television market. Free-to-air television in Singapore is currently monopolised by MediaCorp, with 8 channels broadcast there.\n\nFrom 2000 onwards, India also encouraged new private stations. Star TV, which is based in Hong Kong, has expanded to other areas in Asia recently. The number of private broadcasters are indeed increasing in some countries, as of 2013, for example: Indonesia has 10 private national stations compared to having just one channel before the introduction of RCTI.\n\nSatellite and cable television is relatively new in Asia, but is a growing industry.\n\nSimilarly in the Middle East, television has been heavily state-controlled, with considerable censorship of both news coverage and entertainment, particularly that imported from the West. This control of the medium has been eroded by the increasing availability of satellite TV, and the number of satellite channels in Arabic is second only to the number of satellite channels in English, the best known of which being the Qatar-based news service Al Jazeera.\n\nAustralian television began in 1956, just in time for the Melbourne Olympics. Australia has three nationwide metropolitan commercial networks (Seven, Nine and Ten) as well as the ABC (Australian Broadcasting Corporation), a government owned, commercial free network; and SBS (Special Broadcasting Service) a commercial-supported, multi-lingual, government-owned station. The Australian Broadcasting Authority has also issued licenses to community groups to establish community television stations in most capital cities on the UHF 31 frequency for analog television and LCN 44 for digital television. In regional and rural areas, numerous commercial stations are affiliated with one of the three metropolitan networks, and carry programming generally indistinguishable from their city cousins.\n\nThrough a Crown entity named Television New Zealand (TVNZ), the New Zealand government owns two television networks TVNZ 1 and TV2. Although both networks are required to screen advertisements to pay for their operation, the One network receives additional funding to provide local content under a government broadcasting charter. A purely commercial network, TV3 is owned by CanWest, a Canadian media company, and also operate a music channel, C4. Another network called Prime Television is a subsidiary of pay television company, SKY Network Television, and carries programming from a number of sources including Australia's Nine Network. SKY Network Television operates a UHF terrestrial and digital satellite TV service. The New Zealand government also funds the Māori Television Service with the aim of putting Māori language and culture on New Zealand television screens. This service is delivered via Sky's UHF and satellite services. Additionally there are a range of low-power UHF regional television channels operating independently throughout the country.\n\nIn much of Europe, television broadcasting has historically been state dominated, rather than commercially organised, although commercial stations have grown in number recently.\n\nIn most countries, the public broadcasters were the only television services available until the 1980s. These were usually funded by the state or a television license, but many countries have eventually adopted advertising in the public channels.\n\nThe United Kingdom was an early adopter of private television, launching the ITV network in 1955. Italy followed in the 1970s. Most countries got commercial broadcasters in the 1980s and 1990s, either by allowing private broadcasters to broadcast terrestrially or from broadcasters located in other countries. Some countries made room for private television by closing down or selling one of the state channels.\n\nMost countries had two to six national broadcasters in the days of analogue television. Digital television has however allowed the number of terrestrial channels to multiply. Cable and satellite are also contributing to the increased number of channels, with hundreds of channels available to those willing to pay for it.\n\nEvery country has a public broadcaster and about one-four dominating commercial broadcasters (excluding smaller countries where local commercial broadcasters haven't been profitable), which are listed in the table below.\nThe largest commercial European broadcaster is the Luxembourg-based RTL Group. Other media groups controlling European television broadcasters are ProSiebenSat.1 Media, News Corporation, Central European Media Enterprises and Modern Times Group.\n\nAs Europe is a linguistical and culturally varied continent, the dominating broadcasters are either national or are operating in countries that share a language. Pan-European broadcasters exist, but they tend to adapt their content for different markets by providing different audio streams or completely separate channels with the same name. Channels available to all of Europe include Euronews and Eurosport.\n\nTelevision has reached a great expansion in all the Latin American scope. Currently, there are more than 1,500 television stations in all Latin America, according to the number of apparatuses by homes (more than 60 million), of more than two hundred million people. Because of the financial and political troubles that occurred between the mid-1970s and the early 1990s, television networks in some countries of this region had a development more irregular than the North American and European networks. In countries like Mexico or Brazil, one or two networks claim almost all the audience. In other countries like Colombia or Chile, television broadcasting has historically been public-broadcast dominated until the 1990s. In countries like Nicaragua or Peru, television had a troubled history. The largest commercial television groups are Mexico-based Televisa, Brazil-based Globo and Canada-based Canwest Latin American Group.\n\nIn Canada, there are a number of national networks, including three main networks for English Canada. One, CBC Television, is owned by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, a government-funded Crown corporation. The other two, CTV, Global, and Citytv are privately run. The private networks usually use most of their primetime hours to rebroadcast U.S. shows, while the CBC airs more Canadian programming. Private systems — essentially mini-networks whose stations have a somewhat enhanced local focus and which do not reach all of Canada — include E! and CTV 2.\n\nIn French Canada, particularly Quebec, the main networks are the CBC-owned \"Ici Radio-Canada Télé\", and private networks TVA and V. These networks tend to air substantially more domestic programming in primetime than their English counterparts. There are also the Aboriginal Peoples Television Network, multiethnic broadcaster Omni Television, provincial educational networks, and a limited number of niche-interest or independent stations. Radio-Canada broadcasts across Canada, while TVA and TQS only broadcast terrestrial signals in Quebec and APTN only broadcasts terrestrially in the territories. TVA and APTN, however, are available on cable in all Canadian markets. TQS does not have national cable carriage rights, although it is available in some markets outside of Quebec with larger francophone communities.\n\nAdditional premium television or specialty channels are also available in both languages through cable and satellite television. Notable examples include CBC Newsworld, TSN, MuchMusic, Showcase, and The Movie Network.\n\nThe Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) requires all television services in Canada to broadcast a minimum percentage of Canadian content, both during the day and during primetime.\n\nIn the U.S., the three traditional commercial television networks (ABC, CBS, and NBC) provide prime-time programs for their affiliate stations to air from 8:00 p.m. to 11:00 p.m. Eastern/Pacific Monday-Saturday and 7:00 p.m to 11:00 p.m. Eastern/Pacific on Sunday (with schedules in the Central and Mountain time zones starting one hour earlier). Most stations procure other programming, often syndicated, outside of prime time hours. Fox and The CW do not provide programming for the last hour of prime time (with The CW airing their primetime programs from Sunday to Friday); as a result, many affiliates of both networks air a local news program at that time. Ion Television, and MyNetworkTV also do not provide the same amount of network programming as so-called traditional networks, and utilize schedules that are heavily composed of reruns. Sinclair Broadcast Group operates the largest network of local television stations, reaching about 24% of U.S. households. Trinity Broadcast Network, or TBN, runs the world's largest Christian television network, and owns twenty-three U.S. full-power television stations as well as 252 low-power stations serving smaller cities and rural areas. PBS is the U.S.'s public broadcaster.\n\nOver the past thirty years, cable and satellite television have come to provide most homes with dozens or even hundreds of television services. Cable television was originally created to allow residents of weak-signal areas to benefit from a large, well-located common antenna. In the 1970s, premium services such as HBO, Showtime, and The Movie Channel used satellites to deliver movies to cable head-ends, who would re-distribute it to customers for an added charge. During the same period, it has seen the emergence of numerous specialty cable networks, such as CBN (now Freeform), CNN, ESPN (sports), Lifetime (women's programming), The Learning Channel, MTV, Nickelodeon (children's shows), VH-1, The Weather Channel, and others. The advent of digital compression technology in the 1990s, along with the rapidly growing popularity of direct-to-home satellite television allowed for content providers to pack more channels into a single satellite slot, and a number of new networks, especially those fulfilling certain niches, aimed at digital cable and satellite systems were established.\n\n"}

He studied at the Royal Academy of Turku, and already had some reputation as a poet when he became a \"docent\" in aesthetics at the school in 1774.\n\nThree years later he moved to Stockholm, where in 1778 he began publishing the journal \"Stockholms-Posten\" with Assessor . Kellgren was sole editor from 1788 onwards. In 1779, he wrote a poem portraying the young and popular actress Ulrica Rosenblad's funeral, a verse quoted in the press. Kellgren was librarian to Gustavus III from 1780, and became his private secretary in 1785. At the establishment of the Swedish Academy in 1786 he was appointed one of its first members.\n\nHe died at Stockholm. Kellgren was never married, but was at one point the lover of the prima donna Fredrique Löwen.\n\nHis strong satiric tendency led him into numerous controversies, the chief that with the critic Thomas Thorild, against whom he directed his satire \"Nytt försök till orimmad vers\", where he also sneers at the \"raving of Shakespeare\" and \"the convulsions of Goethe.\" His lack of humour detracts from the interest of his polemical writings. His poetical works are partly lyrical, partly dramatic; his plays are based on plots by Gustavus III. The songs interspersed in the four operas which they produced together, viz., \"Gustaf Vasa, Gustaf Adolf och Ebba Brahe, Aeneas i Carthago\", and \"Drottning Kristina\", are wholly the work of Kellgren.\n\nFrom about 1788 a graver feeling pervades Kellgren's verses, owing partly to the influence of Lessing and Goethe, but probably more directly due to his controversy with Thorild. Of his minor poems written before that date the most important are the charming spring-song \"Vinterns valde lyktar\", and the satirical \"Mina Löjen\", an attack on the songwriter Carl Michael Bellman, and \"Man äger ej snille för det man är galen\". The best productions of what is called his later period are the satire \"Ljusets fiender\", the comic poem \"Dumboms lefverne\", the warmly patriotic \"Kantat d. 1. Jan. 1789\", the ode \"Till Kristina\", the fragment \"Sigwart och Hilma\", and the beautiful song \"Nya skapelsen\", both in thought and form the finest of his works.\n\nAmong his lyrics are the choicest fruits of the Gustavian age of Swedish letters. His earlier efforts, indeed, express the superficial doubt and pert frivolousness characteristic of his time; but in the works of his riper years he is no mere \"poet of pleasure,\" as Thorild contemptuously styled him, but a worthy exponent of earnest moral feeling and wise human sympathies in felicitous and melodious verse.\n\nHis \"Samlade skrifter\" (\"Collected works\", 3 vols., 1796; a later edition, 1884-1885) were revised by himself. His correspondence with Nils von Rosenstein and with Abraham Niclas Clewberg was edited by Henrik Schück (1886-1887 and 1894).\n\n\n"}

ExpressJet is a partially owned subsidiary of United Airlines. ExpressJet Airlines operates an all-jet fleet consisting of exclusively Embraer regional jet aircraft. \nExpressJet has flight crew bases located in Chicago, Illinois; Cleveland, Ohio; Denver, Colorado (Opening fall 2020); Houston, Texas; Newark, New Jersey and Knoxville, Tennessee.\nExpressJet has airport maintenance facilities in Baton Rouge, Louisiana; Chicago, Illinois; Cleveland, Ohio; Houston, Texas; Newark, New Jersey; Knoxville, Tennessee, Richmond, Virginia. ExpressJet operates Embraer 145 aircraft. ExpressJet has two training centers located in Houston, Texas.\n\nThe airline was established in 1986 and started operations in 1987. Its origins were in a group of small commuter airlines acquired by Texas Air Corporation / Continental Airlines. These included Bar Harbor Airlines in Maine, Provincetown-Boston Airlines in New England, Rocky Mountain Airways in Denver, Colorado, and Britt Airways in Terre Haute, Indiana. ExpressJet operates under the original Federal Aviation Administration Part 121 certificate issued to Britt, which began operations as Continental Express in April 1987 and was later acquired by Continental Airlines. ExpressJet Airlines, Inc. incorporated in 1996.\n\nExpressJet was spun off from Continental in 2002. Afterwards the company began plans to move into a corporate headquarters location. ExpressJet has over 8,000 employees. ExpressJet Holdings also owns American Composites LLC, Saltillo Jet Center, and InTech Aerospace Services. Together with other facilities throughout the U.S. they make up ExpressJet Services which provides third-party maintenance, repair and overhaul services for a variety of aircraft types. ExpressJet Holdings also has non-controlling interests in Wings Holdings LLC 49% and Flight Services and Systems Inc 44%.\n\nBefore ExpressJet became independent, it was headquartered in Continental Center I in Downtown Houston.\n\nFollowing a December 2005 decision by Continental to reduce ExpressJet's Continental Express flying by 69 aircraft, the airline elected to operate the aircraft independently. On December 31, 2006, the airline began its charter operation. It currently operates 6 aircraft for charter services under the Corporate Aviation Division. On February 5, 2007, the airline announced service to 24 cities in the west coast, southwest, and midwest regions of the United States beginning in April 2007.\n\nOn April 2, 2007, the airline began point-to-point services under its own name from locations throughout the U.S. The airline had a total of 42 aircraft in their branded operation. According to ExpressJet CEO James Ream, LA/Ontario International Airport in Ontario, California (alternate airport to nearby LAX) would become the airline's \"biggest center of operation\".\nIn March 2007, ExpressJet operated four of its Embraer 145 jets on JetBlue routes while JetBlue's Embraer 190 jets were being serviced.\n\nIn June 2007, the airline began service at LAX to western ski markets and Mexico on behalf of Delta Air Lines under the Delta Connection banner using 10 EMB 145XR aircraft. In July 2007, the agreement was increased to 18 aircraft. In July 2008, the agreement was terminated and ExpressJet ended all Delta Connection flying by September 1. A few days after announcing the end of its agreement with Delta, ExpressJet announced on July 8, 2008, that it would also end its independent ExpressJet-branded flying on September 2 due to the oil price increases since 2003. This resulted in the furlough of 347 pilots.\n\nIn September 2007, the airline agreed to provide feeder service for Frontier Airlines from Denver International Airport while federal certification for Frontier's Lynx Aviation turboprop subsidiary was underway. ExpressJet flew to 5 cities from Frontier's Denver hub using 50-seat ERJ 145 regional jets until Frontier's subsidiary, Lynx Aviation, received DOT approval in December 2007. As of December 7, ExpressJet discontinued providing feeder service for Frontier Airlines.\n\nOn August 21, 2009, an incident occurred where passengers were forced to stay on a parked plane at Rochester, Minnesota for six hours with no food and overflowing toilets. The airline crew tried over thirty times to call the contract carrier, Delta Connection, (which services the Rochester airport) to let the passengers off. The agents for the regional Mesaba Airlines refused. The Department of Transportation cited the main cause of the incident as the Mesaba Airlines station's refusal to park the aircraft. However, Continental Airlines and ExpressJet were also fined for the part they played in the incident.\n\nExpressJet began a temporary contract with United Airlines to fly as a United Express carrier beginning in June 2009. The contract was for approximately 10 aircraft that operated out of United's O'Hare and Washington (Dulles) hub. The aircraft were flown in ExpressJet livery. The contract ended on September 2, 2009.\n\nIn late 2010 ExpressJet signed a multiple year contract with United Airlines for 22 ERJ-145 aircraft. The aircraft were flown, for the first time, in full United Express colors. Additionally, 10 more ERJ-145s; in ExpressJet colors, operated for United during the peak Summer travel season in 2010. The first flights under this new contract started December 1, 2009 and all 22 aircraft were in United Express service by Spring 2010.\n\nIn May 2010, ExpressJet began operating Branson AirExpress, non-stop air service between Branson, Missouri and Houston, Texas; Austin, Texas; Nashville, Tennessee; Des Moines, Iowa; Shreveport, Louisiana and Terre Haute, Indiana; Chicago Midway and Indianapolis. ExpressJet last flight operating under Branson Air Express was on Oct 30 2010.\n\nExpressJet operated its own point-to-point service with its main hub at LA/Ontario International Airport in Ontario, California. This service ended on September 2, 2008.\n\nIn April 2008, SkyWest, Inc. proposed an acquisition of ExpressJet at a price of $23.50/share. ExpressJet Holdings Inc. said its special committee unanimously rejected the proposal. SkyWest rescinded the offer in early June after ExpressJet Holdings and Continental signed a new 7-year Capacity Purchase Agreement. This proposal was ultimately not successful.\n\nOn November 12, 2010, the financial transaction between Atlantic Southeast Airlines (a subsidiary of SkyWest, Inc.) and ExpressJet was closed. Thus as a legal entity the original (legacy) ExpressJet airlines effectively ceased to exist. Atlantic Southeast Airlines continued to operate ExpressJet during that time under the terms of their then current operating certificate with the FAA as \"ExpressJet Airlines\" while a new name for the recently merged companies was being considered.\n\nIn October 2011, the employees of ExpressJet and Atlantic Southeast Airlines voted to keep the name ExpressJet as the combined airlines new name, while Atlantic Southeast's \"Acey\" callsign would remain.\n\nIn October 2013, ExpressJet opened a new crew domicile in Kansas City, Missouri, at Kansas City International Airport. ExpressJet also opened a crew domicile in Denver, at Denver International Airport.\n\nIn August 2017, as United Airlines purchase talks gained momentum Delta Air Lines terminated its contract with ExpressJet, which took effect in late 2018. The fleet of CRJ-900 aircraft, which were owned by Delta and leased, were transferred to Endeavor Air.\n\nAmerican Airlines terminated their contract with ExpressJet in May 2018. As a result, ExpressJet ceased to operate American Eagle flights as of 2019.\n\nUnited Airlines and ExpressJet have partnered to offer ExpressJet pilots a direct path to a Flight Officer position at United Airlines through the United Pilot Career Path Program called \"AVIATE\".\n\nThe United AVIATE program now guarantees eligible ExpressJet pilots participation in United’s hiring process and, once accepted into the program, the expectation that they will become a mainline United Airlines pilot. Through the program, United has committed to hiring a sizable portion of its new-hire pilots directly from ExpressJet.\n\nExpressJet operates flights to over 100 destinations across the United States, Canada and Mexico on behalf of United Airlines.\n\n, the ExpressJet fleet consists of the following aircraft:\n\nExpressJet has its headquarters in College Park, Georgia, in Greater Atlanta.\n\nExpressJet previously had its headquarters in the North Belt Office Center IV, a building in the Greens Crossing office park, a mixed-use office park; the office park is in the Greenspoint area of Houston.\nExpressJet was one of three tenants that leased space in the two-building, North Belt Office Center complex, which includes buildings III and IV. FORT Properties manages both buildings. ExpressJet uses the location due to the proximity to George Bush Intercontinental Airport and to Continental Center I, the Continental Airlines headquarters in Downtown Houston. ExpressJet had relocated its headquarters to its final Houston location by 2006. FORT had acquired the buildings in 2007, which were built in 2003.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2336164", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2336164", "title": "Treaty of Fort Laramie (1851)", "text": "Treaty of Fort Laramie (1851)\n\nThe Fort Laramie Treaty of 1851 was signed on September 17, 1851, between United States treaty commissioners and representatives of the Cheyenne, Sioux, Arapaho, Crow, Assiniboine, Mandan, Hidatsa, and Arikara Nations. The treaty was an agreement between nine more or less independent parties. The treaty set forth traditional territorial claims of the tribes as among themselves. The United States acknowledged that all the land covered by the treaty was Indian territory and did not claim any part of it. The boundaries agreed to in the Fort Laramie treaty of 1851 would be used to settle a number of claims cases in the 20th century. The Native Americans guaranteed safe passage for settlers on the Oregon Trail and allowed roads and forts to be built in their territories in return for promises of an annuity in the amount of fifty thousand dollars for fifty years. The treaty should also \"make an effective and lasting peace\" among the eight tribes, each of them often at odds with a number of the others.\n\nAlthough many European and European-American migrants to western North America had previously passed through the Great Plains on the Oregon and Santa Fe Trails, the California gold rush beginning in 1848 greatly increased traffic. The next year, both Thomas Fitzpatrick (agent of Upper Platte and Arkansas) and David D. Mitchell (superintendent at Saint Louis) recommended a council with the Indians to prevent a conflict. The United States government undertook negotiations with the Native American Plains tribes living between the Arkansas and Missouri rivers to ensure protected right-of-way for the migrants. The Congress had appropriated one hundred thousand dollars to the assembly, endorsed by Luke Lea (the Commissioner of Indian Affairs).\n\nBecause the area around Fort Laramie lacked forage for the Indians' horses, the treaty was negotiated and signed 30 miles downriver from the fort at the mouth of Horse Creek. Many Indians have referred to the treaty as the Horse Creek Treaty. Representatives from the Lakota, Cheyenne, Assiniboine, Gros Ventre, Mandan, Arikara, Hidatsa, Shoshone, Crow, and Arapaho took part in the treaty discussions.\n\nThe Comanche, Kiowa, and Kiowa Apache refused to send representatives to Fort Laramie because the fort was in Sioux territory. The Comanche, Kiowa, and Kiowa Apache considered the Sioux an enemy.\n\nThe United States Senate ratified the treaty, adding Article 5, to adjust compensation from fifty to ten years, if the tribes accepted the changes. Acceptance from all tribes, with the exception of the Crow, was procured. Several tribes never received the commodities promised as payments.\n\nThe Lakota got some rather new territorial claims recognized. In 1823, a number of Lakotas had helped the United States army attack an Arikara village at Grand River (present South Dakota). The Lakotas had kept on pushing the village tribe north, so they got treaty on the former Arikara homeland along the Grand.\n\nThe Lakota received exclusive treaty rights to the Black Hills (present South Dakota), to the consternation of the Cheyenne and the Arapahoe. \"... the Sioux were given rights to the Black Hills and other country that the Northern Cheyennes claimed. Their home country was the Black Hills, declared a Cheyenne historian in 1967. Arapahoe chief Black Coal complained in 1875: \"I have never got anything yet for my land [the Black Hills]. It is part mine, and part the Sioux... In the first place, they came from the Missouri River and reached this place, and now they have got up this far, and they claim all this land.\"\n\nThe Cheyenne and Arapaho, the southernmost of the treaty tribes, held an area southward of the North Platte in common (mainly in present Wyoming and Colorado).\n\nThe Crow treaty territory (in present Montana and Wyoming) included the area westward from Powder River. Little Bighorn River ran through the center of the Crow domain.\n\nThe treaty was broken almost immediately after its inception, by the Lakota and Cheyenne attacking the Crow over the next two years. In 1858, the failure of the United States to prevent the mass immigration of miners and settlers into Colorado during the Pike's Peak Gold Rush, also did not help matters. They took over Indian lands in order to mine them, \"against the protests of the Indians,\" and founded towns, started farms, and improved roads. Before 1861, the Cheyenne and Arapahoe \"had been driven from the mountain regions down upon the waters of the Arkansas.\" Such emigrants competed with the tribes for game and water, straining limited resources and resulting in conflicts with the emigrants. The U.S. government did not enforce the treaty to keep out the emigrants. In 1864 came the Sand Creek massacre on a camp of mostly Cheyennes by Colonel John M. Chivingtons army of one hundred days volunteers. The consequence was years of war between the Cheyennes and the United States.\n\nThe situation escalated with the Grattan affair in 1854, when a detachment of U.S. soldiers illegally entered a Sioux encampment to arrest those accused of stealing a cow, and in the process sparked a battle in which Chief Conquering Bear was killed.\n\nDespite the peace treaty of 1851, Hunkpapa Lakota chief Running Antelope killed four Arikaras in 1853.\n\nAround the same year, a joint Cheyenne and Lakota war party found a big Crow camp in the valley of the Little Bighorn River. The Lakota One Bear killed a Crow woman taken captive by the Cheyennes.\n\nAround 1855, the Assiniboines and the Lakotas met on the battlefield more often than before. The Arikaras conquered horses from the Sioux at least in 1858, while war parties of Crows troubled Lakotas near the Upper Platte the same year.\n\nThough intertribal fighting had existed before the arrival of white settlers, some of the post-treaty intertribal fighting can be attributed to mass killings of bison by white settlers and government agents. The U.S. army did not enforce treaty regulations and allowed hunters onto Native land to slaughter buffalo, providing protection and sometimes ammunition. One hundred thousand buffalo were killed each year, until they were on the verge of extinction, which threatened the tribes' subsistence. These mass killings affected all tribes thus the tribes were forced onto each other's hunting grounds, where fighting broke out. \n\nThe Lakota continued harassment of the Mandan, Hidatsa and Arikara. By summer 1862, all three tribes had been forced out of their shared treaty territory. \"We, the Arikara, have been driven from our country on the other side of the Missouri River by the Sioux\", stated chief White Shield in 1864. The elimination of buffalo also meant that the Yanktonai Sioux moved into Assiniboine hunting grounds in North Dakota and Montana, where the Assiniboine made peace with them.\n\nBefore long, the Crows saw their western Powder River area flooded with trespassing Lakotas in search of bison, and \"... large scale battles with invading Sioux\" took place near present-day city of Wyola, Montana. The outnumbered Crows were displaced little by little. \"The country from the Powder River to the Yellowstone River was their country [the Crows'], until 1859, when they were driven from it by the Sioux\". In 1868, after a series of battles with the United States army in the contested area, the Lakotas finally succeeded in turning a part of the Crow Indian territory of 1851 into unceded Indian territory of their own.\n\nLater again, huge parts of the different Indian territories would in one way or another be added to the holdings of the United States. Smaller areas of the initial Indian territories became separate reservations, usually populated with Indians from the tribe, which held the treaty right in 1851.\n\nHowever, the Crow territory provided in the end acreage to \"two\" different reservations. The Crow Reservation was created in the center of the original territory in 1868. The reservation of the Northern Cheyennes became a reality in 1884. It is located entirely within the boundaries of the 1851 Crow territory, after the Indians in question had \"earned the right to stay in the north\" after the Fort Robinson outbreak.\n\nThe Arapahoe (Northern Arapaho) settled down on the reservation of their past enemies, the Shoshone, in present Wind River Reservation in Wyoming. The Southern Cheyenne and the Arapaho live in a common reservation in present Oklahoma, also far from their 1851 treaty land.\n\nThe Assiniboine in the United States has since 1888 lived in partly Fort Peck Reservation and partly Fort Belknap Reservation, both placed north of the Missouri in present Montana. The treaty territory of the Assiniboine south of the Missouri was just a small portion of the wide range used by these northern plains Indians.\n\n\n"}

She had an older sister Dolores who also became an actress and would go on to marry John Barrymore. Costello first appeared on screen, opposite her father, in the 1909 film adaptation of Victor Hugo's \"Les Misérables\". She would continue acting in films throughout the 1910s as a child actor and also worked in vaudeville and appeared in stage roles. In 1924, she appeared with her sister Dolores in \"George White's Scandals\". Shortly thereafter, both sisters signed contracts with Warner Bros. Costello reached her peak of public popularity in the mid-1920s and earned a reported $3,000 a week.\n\nAlthough she had been appearing on screen since her early childhood, Costello was selected as a WAMPAS Baby Star in 1927, a promotional campaign sponsored by the Western Association of Motion Picture Advertisers in the United States, which honored thirteen young women each year whom they believed to be on the threshold of movie stardom. In 1928, Costello co-starred in the first all-talking full-length feature film \"Lights of New York\". Later that same year, she was released from her contract with Warner Bros. after she refused to star as a leading lady opposite Rin Tin Tin. Costello's final substantial role was opposite her sister Dolores in the all-star Technicolor musical revue \"The Show of Shows\" (1929). Costello and her sister performed in the \"Meet My Sister\" musical number.\n\nAfter the advent of sound, Costello's career declined reportedly because her voice did not record well. She was also beset with personal problems including illnesses, an addiction to drugs and alcohol, three divorces, a public custody battle with her third ex-husband and financial difficulties. From 1930 to 1934, Costello did not appear in a film. In September 1935, she signed a contract with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and returned to the screen in a supporting role in \"Riffraff\" (1936). Her final role was a bit part in the 1942 film \"The Black Swan\". Later in 1942, Costello filed for bankruptcy.\n\nCostello was married four times, each marriage ending in divorce. Her first marriage was to football player John W. Regan in 1927. They divorced in June 1928. Costello's second marriage was to actor/director Lowell Sherman, whom she married on March 15, 1930, in Beverly Hills. They separated in November 1931 and were divorced in May 1932. Costello third marriage was to Dr. Arturo de Barrio, a lawyer who came from a prominent Cuban family. They were married in Havana on January 6, 1933. Their marriage was considered invalid because Costello's divorce from her second husband was not finalized. They married for a second time in June 1933 in Los Angeles. They were divorced in 1939.\n\nHer fourth and final marriage was to artist George Lee Le Blanc, whom Costello married in 1940. The couple had a daughter, Diedre, on February 18, 1941. Costello filed for divorce on August 6, 1947. Shortly after Costello filed for divorce, Le Blanc joined the Merchant Marine. Before leaving, Le Blanc left Diedre in the care of Costello's sister Dolores claiming that Costello was unfit to care for Diedre because of her alcoholism. Costello denied Le Blanc's claim and attempted to regain sole custody in September 1947. During one custody hearing, Costello's father and Lionel Barrymore (Dolores Costello's ex brother-in-law) testified that Costello did not have a drinking problem. In April 1948, Costello was forced to drop her suit due to financial troubles and Le Blanc was awarded temporary custody of Diedre. Costello and Le Blanc were divorced in June 1948.\n\nOn January 24, 1957, Costello was admitted to Patton State Hospital under the assumed name of Adrienne Costello for treatment for a drug and alcohol addiction. She died there two days later of pneumonia. Her sister, Dolores Costello Barrymore, was with her when she died. Her funeral was held on January 30, after which she was interred in an unmarked grave at Calvary Cemetery in East Los Angeles.\n\nFor her contribution to the motion film industry, Helene Costello has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 1500 Vine Street in Hollywood.\n\nComedian Lou Costello, born Louis Cristillo, changed his name in honor of Helene Costello. Coincidentally, both of them were born in 1906.\n\n"}
