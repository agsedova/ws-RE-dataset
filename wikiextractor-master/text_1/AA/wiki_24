He took to traveling, and on a return voyage from Italy in 1678 was at the age of twenty-two captured by an Algerian pirate, sold as a slave in Algiers and taken to Constantinople, where the French consul paid ransom for his release. He went on traveling, undaunted. His \"Voyage de Flandre et de Hollande, commencé le 26 avril 1681.\" reporting his trip through the Low Countries, Denmark and Sweden, where he dallied at the courts of Christian V and Charles XI and then north to Lapland, returning through Poland, Hungary and Germany to France, is mined by social historians. The section often published on its own, his \"Voyage de Laponie\", largely inspired by Johannes Schefferus, describes the way of life of the Sami of Lapland; it was not published until 1731, when its description of the backwardness and simplicity of the Sami people, their curious pagan customs, alcohol addiction and untidy lifestyle, introduced these strangers to cultured Europe.\n\nAfter his return to Paris he purchased a sinecure in the Treasury that required no attention, and wrote farces and skits for the Théâtre des italiens, 1688–96. After inheriting his mother's considerable fortune in 1693, he devoted the time divided between his \"hôtel\" in Paris and his country house, the château of Grillon, near Dourdan, to writing comedies in verse for the Comédie française, twenty-three in total, the best of them being \"Le Joueur\" (\"The Gamester\", 1696), \"Le Distrait\" (1697), \"Les Ménechmes\" (1705), and his masterwork, \"Le Légataire universel\" (\"The residuary legatee\" [1706]), following closely in the steps of Molière.

Woodbury was born in Lynn, Massachusetts, where his earliest work was part of the oeuvre of the group later known as the Lynn Beach Painters. While an undergraduate at MIT he became a regular exhibitor at, and at 19 the youngest member of, the Boston Art Club . After graduation from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (with degree in Mechanical Engineering), in 1886 Woodbury had great success painting up the New England coast and in the towns and beaches of Nova Scotia and exhibiting the results. From January to June 1891 he was a pupil of the Académie Julian in Paris, after which he went to Holland, where he studied the techniques of the modern Dutch painters. Upon his return to New England he settled in Boston for his winter studio and spent his summers in the small fishing village of Ogunquit, Maine; there he founded one of the most successful of the summer art colony schools that even survived his death. He was one of the most sought-after teachers of his generation, having begun teaching on a regular basis while a freshman at M.I.T. Ironically, he had little formal training himself other than a few months of classes at the Academy Julian in Paris. Like Winslow Homer, another New England painter with an affinity for summers in Maine, he preferred \"to work out his salvation with little help from others in his profession\". Nevertheless, Woodbury maintained a close friendship with John Singer Sargent and a pleasant acquaintance with many of his contemporaries including J. Alden Weir and Childe Hassam. He was president of the Boston Watercolor Society, and became associate of the National Academy of Design, New York in 1906 and a full member in 1907. His wife, Marcia Oakes Woodbury, born in 1865 at South Berwick, Maine, also became known as a painter. She died at the age of 49 in 1913.\nHe maintained a strong and consistent vision in his more than fifty years of professional life and became a master of compositions of the coast and sea. Woodbury’s many on-the-spot sketches and etchings produce a sense of motion through quick, sure-handed strokes. Seeing and understanding movement was fundamental to his art and teaching, and is reflected in his own maxim: “Paint in verbs, not nouns.” In the words of his son David, Woodbury \"...painted what he saw, satisfied that what he saw was really there, all in proper relationship, checked and rechecked by endless reference to the real world\".\n\nIn his later years he spent his winters in the Caribbean sailing from island to island painting watercolor studies of the beaches and town backed by dramatic mountains and clouds. Over a large part of his career he made some of the most expressive etchings of any American artist of his time, completing more than 500 plates and teaching many younger artists to express themselves in this medium. He died on January 21, 1940 in Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts.\nWoodbury engaged in over 100 solo exhibitions throughout his career, and was included in all of the major invitational and juried shows throughout the country. His work may be found currently in The Art Institute of Chicago, The Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, and New York’s Metropolitan Museum of Art among many others.\n\n1864 Born in Lynn, MA on July 14. \n1881 At 17, becomes the youngest honoree of the Boston Art Club.\n1882 Begins studies at MIT.\n1886 Graduates from MIT with a degree in mechanical engineering.\n1887 Takes a studio in Boston and teaches drawing.\n1888 First recorded visit to Ogunquit, ME.\n1890 Marries former student, Marcia Oakes.

He was one of the three main gods worshiped by the Old Prussians. Most of what is known about this god is derived from unreliable 16th-century sources.\n\nHe was first mentioned (as \"Natrimpe\") in a 1418 memorandum \"Collatio Espiscopi Varmiensis\" sent by the Bishop of Warmia to Pope Martin V. The document reminded the Pope that the Teutonic Knights successfully Christianized pagan Prussians, who previously worshipped \"demons\" Perkūnas, Potrimpo and Peckols (and Patollo). Simon Grunau claimed that Potrimpo was a god of grain and together with thunder god Perkūnas and death god Peckols formed a pagan trinity. He was depicted on the purported Flag of Widewuto as a young, merry man wearing a wreath of grain ears. Grunau further claimed that snakes, as creatures of Potrimpo, were worshipped and given milk (cf. žaltys). The \"Sudovian Book\" (1520–1530) listed Potrimpo (\"Potrimpus\") as god of running water and Autrimpo (\"Autrimpus\") as god of the seas. The \"Constitutiones Synodales\", a church ceremony book published in 1530, likened Potrimpo with Roman and Pollux and Autrimpo with Castor and Neptune.\n\nLater authors copied these descriptions, often merging Potrimpo and Autrimpo into one deity of earth and water. Jan Sandecki Malecki claimed that Prussians would pray to Potrimpo, pour hot wax into water, and predict the future based on the shapes of wax figures. Maciej Stryjkowski wrote that there was a copper idol (a twisted žaltys) to Potrimpo in the temple of Romuva. Simonas Daukantas described Potrimpo as the god of spring, happiness, abundance, cattle and grain.\n\nAccording to Kazimieras Būga, the name was derived from the root \"trimp-\", which is related to Lithuanian verb \"trempti\" (to trample, to stomp). Following this research, Vladimir Toporov believed that initially there was a fertility god Trimps, who was later split into two deities. Further researchers speculated that the name could be related to fertility ritual – stomping to scare away evil spirits and to wake the earth in spring.\n"}

He rose to prominence as the vocalist for the Cantopop duo Tat Ming Pair during the 1980s before embarking on a solo career. He also performed and collaborated with the theatre group Zuni Icosahedron. Wong is the director for music production company People Mountain People Sea. He also co-founded the LGBT rights organization Big Love Alliance and the non-profit charitable organization Renaissance Foundation.\n\nOn 3 January 2019, Wong and bandmate Tats Lau received the Golden Needle Award for Tat Ming Pair's outstanding musical contributions at the RTHK Top 10 Gold Songs Awards.\n\nAnthony Wong Yiu-ming was born on 16 June 1962 in Hong Kong. Wong is the youngest child of five siblings: he has two brothers and two sisters. Wong grew up in a housing estate in the Ngau Tau Kok area of East Kowloon. As a child, Wong developed a deep interest in music due in part to his eldest brother's record collection which ranged from Simon and Garfunkel to ABBA. He also became enamoured with local singers such as Paula Tsui. In addition, he developed an interest in films, often attending theater showings alone while still in elementary school.\n\nIn high school, he became a Christian and desired to become a priest. Wong eventually left the church shortly after due to the conflict of the church's general attitude towards homosexuality. Wong recalled in a 2013 interview: \"Religion gave me a lot of inspiration, but it also gave me a lot of repression. I already realized I was gay by the time I reached high school, so the attitude of the church’s teachings was a strange contradiction towards me. The church was supposed to be a place to find release but it just became a place of suppression. And so I left.\" Wong is now indifferent towards religion.\n\nAfter completing high school, he entered a television training course at TVB in 1980. During this period and after graduating from the program, Wong had a few minor roles in television productions. He worked as an assistant director for a TV program called \"Modern Women\" (婦女新姿) for two months in 1983. He also worked as a production assistant at an advertising company before quitting to attend a David Bowie concert at the Hong Kong Coliseum. He then began working as a DJ at Commercial Radio Hong Kong in 1984.\n\nIn 1984, Tats Lau advertised in a music magazine called Rock Biweekly (搖擺雙週刊) in order to find a vocalist for his band. Wong responded to the ad and realized Lau also shared a deep interest in electronic music. In 1985, the band signed a contract with PolyGram with the help of Winnie Yu; she also named the band Tat Ming Pair (達明一派) by combining both Lau and Wong's given names. The duo released a self-titled EP in March 1986 and were an immediate critical and commercial success due in part to their unique sound and distinctive imagery. Wong's long hair prominently displayed on the cover of their first EP was considered subversive for men at the time in Hong Kong. The majority of their album art was directed by designer William Chang. Tat Ming Pair were influenced by British musicians such as Pet Shop Boys and David Bowie and also by electronic music.\n\nIn 1986, Wong starred in the Calvin Poon Yuen-leung (潘源良) film \"Kiss Me Good-Bye\" (戀愛季節) alongside Loletta Lee. The film contained many songs from their first full-length album \"Tat Ming Pair II\" (達明一派II) which was released in September 1986. For his performance in the film, Wong was nominated for Best New Performer at the 6th Hong Kong Film Awards.\nIn 1987, Wong starred in the film \"Golden Swallow\" (金燕子) alongside Cherie Chung. Tat Ming Pair's second album \"The Story of the Stone\" (石頭記) coincided with the release and an instrumental version of the title track was used as the opening theme song. The film's soundtrack also included an alternate recording of the song \"Searching For Love (情探)\".\n\nThe duo released two more acclaimed albums in 1988: \"I Shall Wait For Your Return\" (我等着你回來) and \"Do You Still Love Me?\" (你還愛我嗎). The former is considered Hong Kong's first concept album and won the award for Best Record Design at the 1988 RTHK Top 10 Gold Songs Awards in which the band also won the award for Best Performance.\n\nOn 27 May 1989, Tat Ming Pair participated in the Concert for Democracy in China which was a benefit concert held at the Happy Valley Racecourse in support of the students involved in the Tiananmen Square protests. The event lasted for 12 hours and raised over US$1.5 million for the students in Beijing. Wong also participated in the 1990 North American Concert for Democracy in China Tour (民主歌聲獻中華美加巡迴演唱會) in Vancouver, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Washington, D.C., Toronto and New York City alongside other prominent figures including Lo Ta-yu, John Shum, Szeto Wah, Lowell Lo and Deanie Ip.\n\nTat Ming Pair's final release before their initial hiatus was 1990's \"Nerves\" (神經), another concept album which contained many songs relating to the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and unease towards the upcoming 1997 handover of Hong Kong Also in 1990, Wong completed work in the Taiwanese film \"Ming Ghost\" (阿嬰) alongside Joey Wong. The film was later re-edited into a Category III film and released in Hong Kong in 1993.\n\nIn 1991, Tat Ming Pair split amicably over a difference in musical opinion and a desire to pursue other work.\n\nWong released his first solo album \"Faith, Hope & Love\" (信望愛) in January 1992. This album began his long-time musical partnership with musician Jason Choi (蔡德才), along with lyrics by Yiu-fai Chow (周耀輝), Kam Kwok-leung (甘國亮), Jimmy Ngai (魏紹恩), and Zuni Icosahedron member Pia Ho (何秀萍).\n\nWong desired to develop an eclectic and electronic sound for his first solo record, incorporating influences from acoustic, traditional Chinese and Indian music. The album acted as a cathartic release of Wong's feelings towards religious symbolism and his previous beliefs. The first song composed for the album was \"How Great Thou Art (你真偉大)\". The title was inspired by the Christian hymn although the song is about resisting autocracy and patriarchy. The album also contains the notable track \"Dance, Dance, Dance (舞吧舞吧舞吧)\" named after the Haruki Murakami novel of the same name. The song was written in dedication to prisoners of conscience such as Liu Xiaobo and Wang Dan and was co-written by Wong Wai-kwong (黃偉光).\n\nWong also appeared in the 1992 Evans Chan film \"To Liv(e)\". The film's soundtrack also contained Tat Ming Pair's song \"Forbidden Colors (禁色)\".\n\nHis second album, \"Borrowing Your Love\" (借借你的愛) was released in 1993. The album started his collaboration with prolific lyricist Lin Xi. Notable songs include \"More, More, More...C'est L'Amour (每天你愛多一些)\", \"Four Seasons (四季歌)\" and \"Love is Colder Than Death (爱比死更冷)\" which was inspired by the Rainer Werner Fassbinder movie of the same name. Much of the album's instrumentation expands Wong's interest in electronic dance music, specifically house music, although the album was also influenced by folk songs.\n\nWong released his first Mandarin album \"I’m No Angel\" (明明不是天使) in 1994. The album contained some of his previous songs remixed with alternate Mandarin lyrics. In addition, the album contained a remixed version of the Tat Ming Pair song \"Forbidden Colors (禁色)\", retitled as \"I Am A Cloud (我是一片雲)\" with a new arrangement and lyrics. It was also the first album that Wong promoted in Taiwan. One performance in Taiwan was later edited out of the official television broadcast due to Wong's avant-garde makeup and styling, which the program had considered too androgynous.\n\nIn 1995, Wong released the album \"The Later the Night, The More Beautiful It Becomes\" (愈夜愈美麗). The album produced one of Wong's biggest hit singles \"Before Sunrise (春光乍洩)\". The original title of the song was taken from the Chinese translation of the Michelangelo Antonioni film \"Blowup\". The song won awards at the 1995 RTHK Top 10 Gold Songs Awards, Jade Solid Gold Best 10 Awards(十大勁歌金曲頒獎禮), the Metro Showbiz Hit Awards (新城勁爆頒獎禮), and Ultimate Song Chart Awards Presentation (叱咤樂壇流行榜頒獎典禮). One version of the music video for \"Before Sunrise (春光乍洩)\" featured Kelly Chen and was directed by Susie Au with cinematography by Christopher Doyle.\n\nAlso during 1995, Wong starred in a segment of the horror anthology \"01:00 A.M\" (夜半一點鐘) directed by Wilson Yip.\n\nThe duo reunited in 1996 to celebrate their 10-year anniversary and released a new single \"A Forbidden Fruit Once Per Day (每日一禁果)\" which won the top prize at the Ultimate Song Chart Awards (叱咤樂壇流行榜) and the best original song at RTHK Top 10 Gold Songs Awards. They released their album \"Viva! Viva! Viva!\" (萬歲！萬歲！萬萬歲!) in October 1996, staging large-scale concerts filmed at Queen Elizabeth Stadium the same month. They also released a live album from these concerts entitled \"Viva! Viva! Viva!: The Concert\" (萬歲！萬歲！萬萬歲！！演唱會) in 1997.\n\nIn June 1996, Wong released the remix album \"5 Loaves & 2 Fishes\" (5餅2魚) which also contained alternate Mandarin-language versions and three new songs, most notably the track \"The Little Prince (小王子)\", the title of which was taken from the novella by Antoine de Saint-Exupéry.\n\nFrom 28 February to 2 March 1997, Wong held three concerts called \"Wong Yiu Ming: People Mountain People Sea\" (黃耀明人山人海演唱會). There were also two larger-scaled concerts performed at the Hong Kong Coliseum. Because of the success of these concerts, Wong desired to set up his own record label. Wong then soon released the album \"People Mountain People Sea\" (人山人海) which was, with the exception of the title track and a hidden ending track, an album of cover songs by various artists such as Teresa Teng, Faye Wong, Winnie Hsin, Leon Lai, and Ekin Cheng. He also released the two compilation albums \"Love Unto Death\" (爱到死精选集) and \"A Mirror For the Romantic\" (風月寶鑑), the title of which was taken from a chapter title of the \"Dream of the Red Chamber\"\n\nIn 1997, Wong sang the Mandarin-language demo version of \"Seven Years in Tibet\" from which David Bowie studied for his own Mandarin version of the song. The Mandarin lyrics of the song were written by Lin Xi. Wong has also performed his own version of the song live several times.\n\nIn 1999, Wong co-founded the music production company People Mountain People Sea (人山人海). The company has produced and published albums not only for high-profiled pop singers like Leslie Cheung, Faye Wong, Sandy Lam, Eason Chan, Nicholas Tse and Miriam Yeung but has also published works for indie musicians such as Jason Choi (蔡德才), Gaybird Leung (梁基爵), at17 and PixelToy. To celebrate the end of the millennium in 1999, Wong released an expansive compilation album \"Let’s Play Again In The Next Century\" (下世紀再嬉戲) which contained songs from his solo career and songs from the catalogue of Tat Ming Pair. An alternate version of the album was also released, entitled \"Let’s Play Again and Again In The Next Century\" (下世紀再再嬉戲).\n\nIn July 2000, Wong released an album of brand-new material titled \"In Broad Daylight\" (光天化日). The album contained the musical and lyrical work of Wong's usual partners such as Jason Choi (蔡德才), Lin Xi, and Yiu-fai Chow (周耀輝) but the album also contained contributions from others such as Zhang Yadong, Yu Yat-yiu (于逸堯), Kubert Leung, Chan Fai-young and Sandee Chan. The album won two awards at the Ultimate Song Chart Awards Presentation (叱咤樂壇流行榜頒獎典禮). The same year, Wong also released a collaboration album with Tsai Chin entitled \"Walking With Wings\" (花天走地). Wong won Best Alternative Artist at the first annual Chinese Music Media Awards (华语音乐传媒大奖) in 2001.\n\n\"Crossover\" was released in July 2002, which was a collaboration album with Leslie Cheung. Wong and Cheung performed together on two songs, with Wong taking the lead vocals on \"So Far, So Close (這麼遠, 那麼近)\". Wong also sang a reworked version of \"If You Knew My Reasons (如果你知我苦衷)\", which Cheung originally wrote for Vivian Chow. Cheung in turn recorded a cover of Wong's 1995 hit song \"Before Sunrise (春光乍洩)\" which coincidentally shares a title with Cheung's 1997 film with Wong Kar-wai. Wong won Best Electronic Artist at the second annual Chinese Music Media Awards (华语音乐传媒大奖). In November 2002, Wong also released the live album \"Acoustic... And a Little More\" which contained a cover of Suede's Saturday Night.\n\nIn July 2003, Wong released an album of brand-new material entitled \"My 21st Century\" (我的廿一世紀). The album won three awards at the Chinese Music Media Awards (华语音乐传媒大奖), including the honor of Best Record. A re-release of the album also featured an additional track \"身外情 (Affairs Beyond A Human Being)\", written by Gaybird Leung (梁基爵) with lyrics by Lin Xi, which was the theme song to the film Running on Karma. The song was nominated at the 23rd Hong Kong Film Awards and the 41st Golden Horse Film Festival and Awards. Wong's song \"Missing (下落不明)\" was also one of ten songs which won Best Song awards at the Ultimate Song Chart Awards Presentation(叱咤樂壇流行榜頒獎典禮). The song was written by Arian (亞里安) with lyrics by Wyman Wong and was inspired by the Pet Shop Boys' Being Boring.\n\nWong released \"Tomorrow’s Song\" (明日之歌) in August 2004, which was a tribute album reimagining the work of composer Joseph Koo. The album won awards at the Chinese Music Media Awards (华语音乐传媒大奖). Wong also won the award for Best Male Cantonese Singer at the Top Chinese Music awards (音乐风云榜).\n\nIn 2004, the duo reunited to release a new single entitled \"Blessed are the Lonely Ones (寂寞的人有福了)\". In July 2005, they released the album \"The Party\" for the band's twentieth anniversary. They staged large-scale concerts filmed at the Hong Kong Coliseum, Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre and the Shanghai Indoor Stadium. Tat Ming Pair also released the live album \"At the Service Of The People\" (為人民服務演唱會).\n\nIn March 2006, Wong collaborated with the Hong Kong Philharmonic Orchestra to create the large-scale musical production \"HKPO vs. Anthony Wong Live: Bauhinian Rhapsody\" (港樂 vs. 黃耀明 電幻狂想曲) which took place over three days. The production was an electronic fusion of classical and pop music, including covers of movie theme songs and other popular songs. The concerts were filmed at the Hong Kong Coliseum. Wong spoke about the event at a press conference: \"I have always hoped to work with the Hong Kong Philharmonic, so this is like a dream come true. A lot of my works are quite glamorous and have an orchestral dimension to it, so I think this collaboration would be both spectacular and original.\"\n\nIn November 2006, Wong released his album \"Like Water\" (若水). The title of the album came from the Tao Te Ching quote \"the best virtue is to be like water.\" The album's concept was inspired by lyricist Lin Xi’s interest in Buddhist and Taoist philosophies. Musically, the album was influenced by Wong’s previous collaboration with the Hong Kong Philharmonic and thus contains a mixture of classical-style music and electronic music. The album won the Best Cantonese Album at the Top Chinese Music awards (音乐风云榜).\n\nIn October 2008, Wong released a folk-influenced album entitled \"King Of The Road\". The album took a step back from Wong’s electronic past and focused on a more grassroots style. The album also notably included the tune \"Dear Margaret (親愛的瑪嘉烈)\" composed by Ellen Joyce Loo with lyrics by Wyman Wong. The song was written in dedication to courageous youth like Loo and the title was inspired by the book \"Dear Andre\" (親愛的安德烈). The album also contained a cover of the song Teardrop by Massive Attack. The album itself was titled in tribute to the Wim Wenders film Kings of the Road. The album won the Best Annual Cantonese album and Best Cantonese Male Singer at the Chinese Music Media Awards (华语音乐传媒大奖)\n\nWong released the album \"Still Covered In Flowers\" (拂了一身還滿) in November 2011 and it was his first album since 1994's \"I’m No Angel\" (明明不是天使) that was primarily in Mandarin although the album also contained four Cantonese songs. The title of the album was a partial line from a poem by Li Yu. The album had another notable contribution from Ellen Joyce Loo in the song \"An Unrivaled Beauty (絕色)\".\n\nIn 2014, Wong released the live album and concert performance \"Below Tai Ping Shan\" (太平山下) which contained personal themes relating to Wong's life and love for Hong Kong. In 2016, Wong released the live album and DVD entitled \"Red Diffusion\" (美麗的呼聲聽證會).\n\nTat Ming Pair once again reunited in 2012 to release a single \"It's My Party\" to celebrate their 25th anniversary. In April 2012, they also held a series of concerts at the Hong Kong Coliseum and released a live album entitled \"兜兜轉轉演演唱唱會\". On Aug 30th, 2013, they performed again in Guangzhou. The duo celebrated their 30th anniversary in 2017 with a series of concerts once again at the Hong Kong Coliseum and they also released the maxi single \"1+4=14\". They released the live album \"達明卅一派對\" in November 2017.\n\nOn 3 January 2019, the duo received the Golden Needle Award due to their success and artistic influence on the Hong Kong music scene. In April 2019, all of the band's music was removed from Apple Music and other music streaming sites in mainland China as a result of censorship by the Chinese government due to the political and democratic nature of their songs.\n\nIn May 2019, Tat Ming Pair released the song \"Memory Is A Crime (回憶有罪)\" in honor of the 30th anniversary of the victims of the Tiananmen Square Massacre. It was composed by Lau with lyrics by Lin Xi. The song topped the iTunes chart in Hong Kong but was immediately banned in mainland China where discussion involving the protests and the violent military response is forbidden. On 4 June 2019, Wong performed the song live during the annual Tiananmen Square vigil in Victoria Park.\n\nAlthough Wong's songs have dealt with numerous themes and emotions, since the beginning of Wong's career, a number of prominent songs in his repertoire have been directly or indirectly inspired by the topic of sexual identity. Wong had been noted in the past as \"deliberately ambiguous – or better: opaque – about his sexual identity\". Tat Ming Pair's 1988 song \"Forbidden Colors (禁色)\" and 1989's \"Forget He or She (忘記他是她)\" were two of the first songs in the Hong Kong music industry to deal with homosexuality and have since become LGBT anthems.\n\nIn April 2012, Tat Ming Pair held a series of concerts at the Hong Kong Coliseum to celebrate their 25th anniversary. On the final night of the residency, Wong publicly came out as gay which received a standing ovation from the audience. Wong said:\n\n\"After the first night of the residency, so many people have asked me, ‘Anthony, are you a tongzhi? And you have probably read my answer in newspapers. I’m not a tongzhi if you mean a communist comrade. If you are talking about a secret communist, then I’m not a tongzhi! Actually, I think since the lyrics of ‘Forbidden Colors’ in 1988, and the lyrics of ‘Forget He or She’ in 1989, I have never tried to hide my identity. But since you people and press are always keen to ask me about it, and press will definitely be asking me yet again later, I would like to tell you, once and for all, that I am not a tongzhi, but I am a homosexual. I am a faggot. I hope other homosexual people and faggots would not need to be like the lyrics from ‘Forbidden Colors’: \"”Let me disappear into the windy and rainy night and be reborn in another dream age.”\" Because we are living in the 21st century now, we are living that dream now. We don't need someone else's permission about whom we can love. So people don't have to guess if I’m a tongzhi or not. I’m telling you, I am a homosexual, G-A-Y, faggot. I love men. Sorry about that, all you press workers. And because I’m going to sing for another 20 years or so, you don't need to ask me about this anymore. I would like to clarify it here tonight. I never talked about this before because I was worried that if I did you wouldn't have anything to talk about in the future. OK, so I have said it tonight and well, that's it. Thank you everyone.\"\n\nWong's sexuality had long been considered an open secret in the Hong Kong music industry, however Wong was only the second high-profile performer in Hong Kong’s history to publicly come out as LGBT, after Leslie Cheung in 1997. Wong co-founded the non-profit charity organization Big Love Alliance (大愛同盟) in 2013 to promote LGBT equality and liberation.\n\nWong founded his own record label People Mountain People Sea in 1999. He also founded the Renaissance Foundation, a non-profit charitable organization in 2012. The foundation \"is dedicated to nurturing upcoming generations of young creative talent. It sponsors independent creation and incubates new networks of cultural industries, establishing a professional platform to facilitate entry into international markets.\"\n\nWong actively supported the 2014 Hong Kong protests. Throughout the protests, he performed for and camped with the protesters. Wong, alongside Denise Ho and others, performed the song \"Raise the Umbrella\" in support of the protests. Wong was one of the few celebrities to publicly show support for the movement, an act which was greeted with praise from the protesters. As a result of Wong's support of the movement, he had two upcoming performances cancelled by the organizers which eventually became a total ban of performing in mainland China by the Chinese government. In 2017, all of Wong's music was removed from mainland Chinese streaming sites and his name cannot be entered as a term on any mainland Chinese search engines. In 2019, Tat Ming Pair's music was also removed. Wong continues to support democracy and freedom of expression in Hong Kong and participated in the 2019 Hong Kong anti-extradition bill protests.\n\n\n"}

Rodgers, granddaughter of Commodore John Rodgers; and commissioned 22 July 1919, Lieutenant Commander A. M. Steckel in command.\n\n\"Rodgers\" served with Division 28, Destroyers, Atlantic Fleet, until the spring of 1922 when she steamed to Philadelphia for inactivation. Decommissioned 20 July of that year, she remained in reserve until after the outbreak of World War II in Europe.\n\n\"Rodgers\", recommissioned 18 December 1939, again served briefly with the Atlantic Fleet, and in October 1940 moved to Halifax, Nova Scotia where she joined other destroyers being transferred to the United Kingdom in exchange for bases in the Western Hemisphere.\n\nShe decommissioned 23 October 1940 and was transferred and commissioned the same day for service in the 4th \"Town\" Flotilla as HMS \"Sherwood\" (I80).\n\n\"Sherwood\" sailed for the United Kingdom 1 November. Diverted en route, she participated in the search for survivors of ships lost from convoy HX 84 and in the subsequent hunt for the , when returning to Canada for repairs. On 18 November, she arrived at Belfast, continued on to Portsmouth, from where, after overhaul, she sailed to join the 12th Escort Group, Western Approaches Command at Londonderry Port. Transferred, with her group, to Iceland in April 1941, she joined in the hunt for the in May. On 28 May, the day after the German battleship had been sunk, the ship assisted in rescue operations for survivors from British destroyer .\n\nDuring the summer, \"Sherwood\" underwent repairs in the Clyde, and then returned to Londonderry Port, from where she operated, first with the 2nd Escort Group, then with the 22nd, into the new year, 1942. In February and March, she accompanied carriers during trials, and, after another yard period, April to August, served as a target ship for training aircraft from the Royal Naval Air Station at Fearn, Scotland. In the autumn, she again crossed the Atlantic and served with the Newfoundland Command until she returned to Londonderry Port in February 1943. During March and April she escorted a convoy to Tunisia and back, but by May she again needed major repairs. Worn out, she was taken out of active service at Chatham, stripped of usable parts and ordnance and towed to the Humber where she was beached in shallow water for use as an aircraft target. Her hulk was scrapped in 1945.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1820173", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1820173", "title": "Marine Corps Martial Arts Program", "text": "Marine Corps Martial Arts Program\n\nThe Marine Corps Martial Arts Program (MCMAP, ) is a combat system developed by the United States Marine Corps to combine existing and new hand-to-hand and close quarters combat techniques with morale and team-building functions and instruction in the Warrior Ethos. The program, which began in 2001, trains Marines (and U.S. Navy personnel attached to Marine units) in unarmed combat, edged weapons, weapons of opportunity, and rifle and bayonet techniques. It also stresses mental and character development, including the responsible use of force, leadership, and teamwork.\n\nThe MCMAP was officially created by Marine Corps Order 1500.54, published in 2002, as a \"revolutionary step in the development of martial arts skills for Marines and replaces all other close-combat related systems preceding its introduction.\" MCMAP comes from an evolution dating back to the creation of the Marine Corps, beginning with the martial abilities of Marine boarding parties, who often had to rely on bayonet and cutlass techniques.\n\nDuring World War I these bayonet techniques were supplemented with unarmed combat techniques, which often proved useful in trench warfare. Between the world wars, Colonel Anthony J. Biddle began the creation of standardized bayonet and close combat techniques based on boxing, wrestling, savate and fencing. Also during this period, Captains Wallace M. Greene and Samuel B. Griffith learned Kung Fu techniques from Chinese American Marines and brought this knowledge to other Marines throughout the Marine Corps.\n\nIn 1956, at Marine Corps Recruit Depot San Diego, Lieutenant Colonel Ralph Hayward (captain of the Judo team at MCRD) made Gunnery Sergeant Bill Miller the new Non-Commissioned Officer in Charge of Hand-To-Hand Combat. Miller was ordered to develop a new curriculum that a 110—or a 210—pound Marine could use to quickly kill the enemy. Miller created the program from various martial arts such as Okinawan karate, judo, taekwondo, boxing, and jujutsu. Every Marine recruit that went through MCRD was instructed in Miller's Combat Curriculum. This also included Special Operations Forces from all branches of the military and civilian entities. Later in 2001, retired Gunnery Sergeant Bill Miller was awarded the Black Belt Emeritus \"for pioneering Martial Arts in the United States Marine Corps.\"\n\nEventually these different techniques evolved into the LINE System in the early 1980s. Later, the system was found to be lacking in flexibility and techniques for use in situations that did not require lethal force, such as peacekeeping operations. The Marine Corps began searching for a more effective system. The result was the Marine Corps Close Combat training Program implemented in 1997–1999. MCMAP was implemented as part of a Commandant of the Marine Corps initiative in summer 2000. Commandant James L. Jones assigned Lieutenant Colonel George Bristol and Master Gunnery Sergeant Cardo Urso, with almost 70 years of martial arts experience between them, to establish the new MCMAP curriculum.\n\nIn July 2011, MCMAP performers from San Diego demonstrated for the KIF (Koyamada International Foundation)'s \"United States Martial Arts Festival\" at the Redondo Beach Performing Arts Center in Redondo Beach, California.\n\nThe program uses an advancement system of colored belts similar to that of most martial arts. The different levels of belts are:\n\nThere are an additional five degrees of black belt, with several of the same common prerequisites, including recommendation of reporting senior, appropriate level of PME completed, must be a current MAI or MAIT. Black belt 2nd degree to 6th degree signify that the holder is an authority in the Marine Corps Martial Arts Program. In addition to the above prerequisite, each belt also has its own rank requirements.\n\nBecause the belts are worn with the Marine Corps Combat Utility Uniform, the complete range of belt colors such as red, yellow, or purple are excluded as a practical consideration. Once Marines obtain their green belt, they can attend an additional training course (such as those at the two Schools of Infantry) to become a martial arts instructor (secondary Military Occupational Specialty (MOS) 0916, formerly 8551).\n\nMCMAP instructors can train and certify other Marines up to their current belt level (though until November 2010 they could only certify Marines at one level below their current belt level). The instructor status is signified by one vertical tan stripe on the MCMAP belt. A Marine must have attended at least the Martial Arts Instructor (MAI) course to advance beyond first degree black belt. The only one who can train a Marine to be an instructor are black belt Martial Arts Instructor-Trainers (MAIT). An MAIT's status is signified by a vertical red stripe on the MCMAP belt and a secondary MOS of 0917 (formerly 8552). To become an MAIT, a Marine must have already completed a local MAI course. The Marine then attends the MAIT course at the Martial Arts Center of Excellence at located at Raider Hall aboard Marine Corps Base Quantico.\n\nMCMAP techniques can be taught to other services and to foreign military members, and belts awarded to those who complete the course.\n\n\"MCMAP is a synergy of mental, character, and physical disciplines with application across the full spectrum of violence.\" The disciplines are the foundation of the MCMAP system, as it serves a dual purpose. MCMAP was implemented to increase the combat efficiency, as well as to increase the confidence and leadership abilities of Marines. As stated above, the three disciplines of MCMAP are mental, character, and physical. Marines are required to develop the mind, body and spirit simultaneously and equally. Safety is also of importance, so equipment such as mouthguards and pads are used in conjunction with techniques such as half-speed practice and break-falls to prevent injury.\n\nThe Commandant of the Marine Corps has recently determined that the disciplines studied in MCMAP are integral to the function of Marines, and had ordered that all Marines will attain a tan belt qualification by the end of 2007. Additionally, all infantry Marines are required to attain a green belt qualification, and other combat arms must qualify for a gray belt by the end of 2008.\n\nWarrior Studies focus on individuals that have shown exemplary service on the battlefield, as well as discussion and analysis of combat citations. Martial Culture Studies focus on societies that produce warriors either primarily or exclusively. Some of the martial cultures that are studied are the Marine Raiders, Spartans, Zulu and Apache. By studying these cultures, Marines learn fundamental tactics and methods of the past and reconnect themselves with the warrior ethos of the Marine Corps. Combative Behavior studies interpersonal violence, as well as Rules of engagement and the Force Continuum (which dictates when and how much force can be used in response to the mission, up to and including lethal force). For some belts, PME courses are prerequisites. The development of this discipline also stresses situational awareness, tactical and strategic decision-making, and Operational Risk Management (ORM).\n\nThe purpose of this discipline is to create \"Ethical Warriors.\" It involves discussion on Marine Corps core values, ethics, and good citizenship. An instructor can fail a Marine if he or she feels that the student does not adequately possess honor, courage, and commitment. Some belts also require the approval of the commanding officer before being awarded. The force continuum is discussed, allowing a Marine to responsibly use the minimum amount of force necessary, including lethal force. Leadership qualities are also stressed.\n\nIn MCMAP, only a third of the training involves techniques and physical development. The physical discipline includes the training of fighting techniques, strength, and endurance.\nThis discipline also includes sustainment of skills and techniques already taught, in order to improve skill as well as develop weak-side proficiency. Ground fighting, grappling, pugil bouts, bayonet dummies, and other techniques are used to familiarize Marines with the application of the techniques used. In addition, physical strength and endurance are tested and improved with various techniques that often require teamwork or competition, such as calisthenics, running with full gear, log carries, and boxing matches. Techniques can also be practiced in water or in low-light conditions to simulate combat stress.\n\nMCMAP draws influences from several disciplines including Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, Wrestling, Judo, Sambo, Bujinkan Budo Taijutsu, Boxing, Savate, Kickboxing, Isshin-ryū Karate, Muay Thai, Taekwondo, Kung Fu, Aikido, Hapkido, Eskrima, Sayoc Kali, Jujutsu, Krav Maga.\n\nThe techniques used by MCMAP vary in degrees of lethality, allowing the user to select the most appropriate (usually the least) amount of force. For example, a Marine facing a nonviolent but noncompliant subject can use an unarmed restraint to force compliance with minimal damage and pain. A more aggressive subject could be met with a choke, hold, or a strike. Lethal force can be used on a subject as a last resort. The majority of techniques can be defensive or offensive in use, with or without a weapon; allowing Marines flexibility in combat and operations other than war (such as civil control or humanitarian missions, as well as self-defense).\nAn instructor can augment the circumstances of training to better fit the unit's mission, such as military police practicing after being exposed to pepper spray.\n\nThe tan belt syllabus focuses on the development of the basics of armed and unarmed combat. Students start with the Basic Warrior Stance and break-falls are taught for safety, then move to:\nIn order to obtain a tan belt the student must score 80 %, students can fail no more than 10 techniques. If a student fails testing, he/she must wait a minimum of 24 hours before retesting. The tan belt syllabus is part of The Basic School and recruit training curriculum.\n\nThe gray belt syllabus expands on the basic techniques with:\nIn addition to the new techniques learned, the student must show knowledge of the previous belt by executing 5 techniques from tan belt.\nIf a student performs any of the 5 techniques incorrectly, the student fails the testing evaluation.\nIn order to obtain a gray belt the student must score 80 %, students can fail no more than 10 techniques. If a student fails testing, he/she must wait a minimum of 24 hours before retesting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It rises in the Guiana Highlands of Venezuela where it descends northward to El Dorado, and turns eastward to meander through the tropical rain forests of Guyana. It finally turns southeastward, flowing to its confluence with the Mazaruni River.

The five unaired episodes have since been aired in reruns in the United Kingdom, Israel, and Switzerland. The series was canceled by Fox in January 2006 due to low ratings.\n\n\"Stacked\" was hailed as the opposite of \"Cheers\", instead of a smart person in a \"dumb\" place, it is based on the concept of a dumb person in a \"smart\" place. A workplace ensemble comedy, \"Stacked\" revolves around Skyler Dayton (Pamela Anderson) who is tired of her non-stop partying lifestyle and bad choices in boyfriends. Wanting a major life change, she wanders into Stacked Books, a small, family-run bookstore owned by Gavin Miller (Elon Gold) and his brother, Stuart (Brian Scolaro).\n\nDivorced and unlucky in love himself, Gavin's inclined to regard Skyler as an embodiment of the vacuous, image-obsessed culture he has come to abhor. Stuart, however, is dazzled by Skyler's beauty and, much to Gavin's horror, offers her a job at their store, which she happily accepts as the first step in her quest for a steadier lifestyle. Unhappy that she's going to be minding the till next to such an intimidating bombshell is the store's sole other employee, Katrina (Marissa Jaret Winokur), who doles out doses of realism and cynicism. Rounding out the characters is the store's one steady customer, Harold March (Christopher Lloyd), a preeminent, but retired, rocket scientist.\n\nThe series has been sold to other television channels around the world including Paramount Comedy 1 in the United Kingdom, Channel 7 in Australia, vtm in Belgium, True Series in Thailand, Italia 1 in Italy, TV3 in Norway, CNBC-e in Turkey, Star World in Asia, Comedy Central in Germany, Comedy Central in Poland and F/X Brasil and Global Television Network in Canada.\n\n\nAll of the books seen in the show are provided by HarperCollins, which, like Fox, is owned by NewsCorp. Books that are prominently displayed are based on \"The New York Times\" Best Seller list. Some titles seen include \"State of Fear\", \"Don Quixote\", \"The Known World\", and \"Anansi Boys\".\n\nThe entire bookstore is one main set, though there are three central areas: the coffee shop, the cash register, and the back office, which has a door. There are stairs on the set next to the coffee shop, but it is unknown where they lead. There is also an elevator near the magazine racks, behind the coffee shop.\n\nSeasonal rankings (based on average total viewers per episode) of \"Stacked\" on the Fox Network.\n\nOn December 12, 2006, Fox Home Entertainment released \"Stacked: The Complete Series\" on DVD.

Bonus features include: \"Nipplegate: Getting Dressed With Pam\", \"Show Us Your Bloopers\", and \"Skyler Dayton's Guide To Dating\".\n\nAs of July 2015, 18 out of the 19 episodes are available to view on Hulu.com including four of the five unaired episodes.\n\n"}
{"id": "1820202", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1820202", "title": "Hydrodynastes gigas", "text": "Hydrodynastes gigas\n\nHydrodynastes gigas is a New World species of large, rear-fanged, colubrid snake endemic to South America. It is commonly and alternatively known as the false water cobra and the Brazilian smooth snake. The false water cobra is so named because when the snake is threatened it \"hoods\" as a true cobra (\"Naja\" species) does. However, unlike a true cobra, it does not rear up, but remains in a horizontal position. There are no subspecies which are currently recognized as being valid.\n\n\"Hydrodynastes gigas\" is commonly referred to as the false water cobra, false cobra, South American water cobra, and Brazilian smooth snake. It is often referred to within the reptile hobby more simply as either a \"falsy\" or \"falsie\" or a \"FWC\", which is an abbreviation of the common name false water cobra.\n\nIn South America, it is sometimes referred to as \"boipevassu\". Additional South American common names include \"mboi-peba, ñacaniná, surucucu-do-pantanal, vibora ladradora\" (barking snake), and \"yacanina\".\n\n\"H. gigas\" is a large colubrid that may exceed 3 m (9 to 10 ft) in total length (including tail) when adult. However most \"H. gigas\" reach approximately 2 m (6 to 7 ft) in total length. It is of medium body, and is therefore neither particularly heavy nor slender-bodied, but is one of the heaviest colubrid species when full adult size is attained. Males are much smaller than females in this species. The common name false water cobra is an allusion to its ability to flatten its neck, similar to a cobra as a defensive reaction to make it look larger and more intimidating. Unlike the true cobra, though, the false water cobra stays in a horizontal position when it hoods, rather than rearing into a vertical position. \"H. gigas\" can flatten not only its neck, but also lower down the body, which is not possible for a true cobra.\nAdditionally, the pattern and coloration of this \"Hydrodynastes\" species superficially resemble those of true water cobras (\"Boulengerina\").\n\nThe false water cobra has large eyes with circular pupils, allowing good daytime vision. The tongue is black, and of the typical snake fashion.\n\nThe background colour of a mature specimen is an olive green or brown, with dark spots and bands covering much of its body. The background coloring and banding generally become darker towards the end tail. This colouring gives the false water cobra effective camouflage in its natural rainforest environment. The ventral scales are yellow or brown, spotted with dark flecks that make three dotted lines which appear to merge towards the tail. Mehrtens, 1987, suggested females are brown ventrally, whilst males are yellow. Females are suggested to have lighter bands and markings on their bodies. This is not an effective way of judging the sex of \"H. gigas\", as coloring will differ slightly between all individuals. Hatchling and juveniles are much darker in coloration and do not have the typical dark eyes of the adults. They more resemble a garter or water snake than their mature counterparts. In captivity, hypomelanstic animals have been produced. These animals vary in coloration, from some having only slightly lighter colored saddles, to those that are almost patternless.\n\nIn South America \"H. gigas\" is found from eastern Bolivia to southern Brazil, and in Paraguay and Argentina.\n\n\"H. gigas\" generally lives in wet, humid areas, and marshlands, typically within the tropical rainforests that are common within its range. However, the false water cobra has also been observed in dryer areas, although this is not its preferred habitat. The preference of wet land as a habitat for \"H. gigas\" contributes to its common name of false \"water\" cobra.\n\n\"H. gigas\" is primarily a diurnal species. It is also a very active and inquistive snake, which will spend much of the day climbing, burrowing and even swimming. Their temperaments can vary considerably between specimens; some are very docile and reluctant to bite, whilst others are very defensive and even aggressive or intimidating. Captive-bred specimens can become quite tame and trusting and many exhibit a high level of intelligence.\n\nIn the wild, \"H. gigas\" primarily feeds on fish and amphibians, but will take small mammals, rodents, birds and even other reptiles. In captivity, they can be introduced to other types of food, as well.\n\nThe posterior maxillary teeth of \"H. gigas\" are enlarged, and the Duvernoy's gland produces a secretion with high proteolytic activity. Besides the ability of this large and powerful snake to inflict mechanical trauma, numerous cases of local envenomation and perhaps hypersensitivity have occurred, most of which have gone unreported. Prolonged, chewing bites may result in painful (sometimes extensive and persistent) swelling, as well as bruising. Nevertheless, the species is regularly kept as a pet, becoming increasingly popular in recent years.\n\nManning et al. (1999) described a case in which an 18-year-old male pet store employee was bitten on the wrist by a specimen that hung on for 1.5 minutes. Some mild swelling resulted, but after nine hours, the victim claimed to have experienced three bouts of muscle paralysis, during which he fell and was unable to move or speak. However, a medical examination did not produce any unusual results. The symptoms described possibly were the result of anxiety.\n\nThis species, \"H. gigas\", was once considered to constitute a single monotypic genus, \"Cyclagras\" \n\n"}

A wide variety of liquorice sweets are produced around the world. In North America, black licorice is distinguished from similar confectionery varieties that are not flavoured and coloured black with liquorice extract but commonly manufactured in the form of chewy ropes or tubes. So called \"black licorice\" together with anise extract is also a widespread flavour in other forms of confectionery such as jellybeans. In addition to these, various other liquorice-based sweets are sold in the United Kingdom, such as liquorice allsorts. Dutch and Nordic liquorice characteristically contains ammonium chloride instead of sodium chloride, prominently so in salty liquorice.\n\nThe essential ingredients of black liquorice confectionery are liquorice extract, sugar, and a binder. The base is typically starch/flour, gum arabic, gelatin or a combination thereof. Additional ingredients are extra flavouring, beeswax for a shiny surface, ammonium chloride and molasses. Ammonium chloride is mainly used in salty liquorice candy, with concentrations up to about 8%. However, even regular liquorice candy can contain up to 2% ammonium chloride, the taste of which is less prominent because of the higher sugar concentration. Some liquorice candy is flavoured with anise oil instead of or in combination with liquorice root extract.\n\nDuring manufacturing, the ingredients are dissolved in water and heated to . In order to obtain sweets of the desired shapes, the liquid is poured into molds that are created by impressing holes into a container filled with starch powder. The liquid is then dried and the resulting sweets are sprayed with beeswax to make their surface shiny.\n\nThe liquorice-root extract contains the natural sweetener glycyrrhizin, which is over 50 times sweeter than sucrose. This ingredient has various pharmaceutical properties. It acts as an expectorant (facilitating removal of mucus from the lungs by coughing) and it increases blood pressure. The latter effect can become significant with a daily consumption of 50 g or more of liquorice candy for as little as two weeks. Glycyrrhizin can cause potassium levels in the body to fall, triggering abnormal heart rhythms, as well as high blood pressure, edema (swelling), lethargy, and congestive heart failure in some people.\n\nLiquorice has several varied uses in herbal medicine, such as acting as a mild laxative by increasing prostaglandins.\n\nComparative studies of pregnant women suggest that excessive amounts of liquorice (100 g a week) may adversely affect both IQ and behaviour traits of offspring.\n\nSome people report that black liquorice confectionery causes their stools to become green, although this is probably due to the blue food colouring used by many manufacturers.\n\nAlexander the Great supplied his troops with rations of liquorice root whilst marching because of its thirst-quenching qualities.\n\nAn excessive amount of black liquorice consumption can cause a chloride-resistant metabolic alkalosis.\n\nIn many countries there is also a product sometimes known as red liquorice which is extruded in a way to resemble liquorice strings but made with main flavourings other than liquorice, such as strawberry, cherry, raspberry, or cinnamon. More recently similar products have been introduced in a wider variety of colours and flavours including apple, mango, blackcurrant, and watermelon, among others. While the common name for this confectionery has now become \"red liquorice\" or often simply \"liquorice\", it does not have the taste of liquorice. \"Black\" in \"black liquorice\"/\"licorice\" would formerly have been redundant and has become a retronym in North America.\n\n\n"}

Fagunwa\n\nChief Daniel Orowole Olorunfẹmi Fagunwa MBE (1903 – 7 December 1963), popularly known as D. O. Fagunwa, was a Nigerian Yoruba author who pioneered the Yoruba-language novel.\n\nHe was born in Oke-Igbo, Ondo State, to Joshua Akintunde Fagunwa and Rachel Oṣunyomi Fágúnwà in 1903.His parents were originally adherents of the traditional Yoruba religion until they converted to Christianity in the late 1910s to early 1920s. He was born with the name Oròwọlé, referring to a Yoruba god, Orò. When his family converted to Christianity, he changed his name to Ọlọ́runfẹ́mi (God loves me).\n\nAn Oloye of the Yoruba people, Fagunwa studied at St. Luke's School, Oke-Igbo, and St. Andrew's College, Oyo, before becoming a teacher himself.\n\nIn 1938, entering a literary contest of the Nigerian education ministry, Fagunwa wrote his \"Ògbójú Ọdẹ nínú Igbó Irúnmọlẹ̀\", widely considered the first novel written in the Yoruba language and one of the first to be written in any African language. Wole Soyinka translated the book into English in 1968 as \"The Forest of A Thousand Demons\", first published by Random House and again by City Lights in September 2013 (). Fagunwa's later works include \"Igbo Olodumare\" (\"The Forest of God\", 1949), \"Ireke Onibudo\" (1949), \"Irinkerindo ninu Igbo Elegbeje\" (\"Expedition to the Mount of Thought\", 1954), and \"Adiitu Olodumare\" (1961).\n\nFagunwa's novels draw heavily on folktale traditions and idioms, including many supernatural elements. His heroes are usually Yoruba hunters, who interact with kings, sages, and even gods in their quests. Thematically, his novels also explore the divide between the Christian beliefs of Africa's colonizers and the continent's traditional religions. Fagunwa remains the most widely read Yorùbá-language author, and a major influence on such contemporary writers as Amos Tutuola.. He also used Greek myths and Shakespearean stories as themes in his books, such as in his book Igbo Olodumare, where the character Baba-onirugbon-yeuke tells a story similar to Romeo and Juliet.\n\nD. O. Fagunwa was the first Nigerian writer to employ folk philosophy in telling his stories.\n\nFagunwa was awarded the Margaret Wrong Prize in 1955 and was made a Member of the Order of the British Empire in 1959. He died in a river in 1963; the ground by the bank of the river apparently gave way under his feet and he fell into the river. He tried to swim out of the water but sank because the canoe by the river also fell and collapsed on him.\n\nFagunwa Memorial High School and Fagunwa Grammar School in Oke-Igbo, Nigeria, are named for Fagunwa. His daughter, Yejide Ogundipe, serves as a council chairperson for Ile Oluji/Okeigbo. Fagunwa day (formerly known as Fagunwa night) is an annual event aimed at reading and promoting his five books. Fagunwa day was initiated in his honour by the Society of Young Nigerian Writers in conjunction with Fagunwa Literary Society and Egbe Odo Onkowe Ede Yoruba.\n"}

{"id": "1820214", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1820214", "title": "Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation", "text": "Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation\n\nVestiges of the Natural History of Creation is an 1844 work of speculative natural history and philosophy by Robert Chambers. Published anonymously in England, it brought together various ideas of stellar evolution with the progressive transmutation of species in an accessible narrative which tied together numerous scientific theories of the age.\n\n\"Vestiges\" was initially well received by polite Victorian society and became an international bestseller, but its unorthodox themes contradicted the natural theology fashionable at the time and were reviled by clergymen – and subsequently by scientists who readily found fault with its amateurish deficiencies. The ideas in the book were favoured by Radicals, but its presentation remained popular with a much wider public. Prince Albert read it aloud to Queen Victoria in 1845. \"Vestiges\" caused a shift in popular opinion which – Charles Darwin believed – prepared the public mind for the scientific theories of evolution by natural selection which followed from the publication of \"On the Origin of Species\" in 1859.\n\nFor decades there was speculation about its authorship. The 12th edition, published in 1884, revealed officially that the author was Robert Chambers, a Scottish journalist, who had written the book in St Andrews between 1841 and 1844 while recovering from a psychiatric disturbance. Initially, Chambers had proposed the title \"The Natural History of Creation\", but he was persuaded to revise the title in deference to the Scottish geologist James Hutton, who had remarked of the timeless aspect of geology: \"no \"vestige\" of a beginning, no \"prospect\" of an end\". Some of the inspiration for the work derived from the Edinburgh Phrenological Society whose materialist influence reached a climax between 1825 and 1840. George Combe, the leading proponent of phrenological thinking, had published his influential \"The Constitution of Man\" in 1828. Chambers was closely involved with Combe's associates William A.F. Browne and Hewett Cottrell Watson who did much to spell out the materialist theory of the mind. Chambers died in 1871 and is buried in the grounds of St Andrews Cathedral, within the ancient chapel of St Regulus.\n\nThe book was published in 1844 by John Spriggs Morss Churchill in London. Great pains were undertaken to secure the secret of the authorship from Churchill, and the public. After Chambers completed each section, his wife copied the manuscript, because Chambers was well known in the trade. Alexander Ireland of Manchester delivered the manuscript to the publisher. Proofs were delivered by the printer—a Mr. Savill—back to Ireland, who forwarded them to Chambers. Chambers gave the secret to only four people: his wife, his brother William, Ireland, and Robert Cox. All correspondence to and from Chambers went through Ireland as intermediary.\n\nThe work puts forward a cosmic theory of transmutation as the \"natural history of creation\" which we now call evolution. It suggests that everything currently in existence has developed from earlier forms: solar system, Earth, rocks, plants and corals, fish, land plants, reptiles and birds, mammals, and ultimately man.\n\nThe book begins by tackling the origins of the solar system, using the nebular hypothesis to explain its formations entirely in terms of natural law. It explains the origins of life by spontaneous generation, citing some questionable experiments that claimed to spontaneously generate insects through electricity. It then appeals to geology to demonstrate a progression in the fossil record from simple to more complex organisms, finally culminating in man—with the Caucasian European unabashedly identified as the pinnacle of this process, just above the other races and the rest of the animal kingdom. It even goes so far as to connect man’s mental reasoning power with the rest of the animals as an advanced evolutionary step that can be traced backwards through the rest of the lower animals. In this sense, the evolutionary ideas offered in \"Vestiges\" aim at being complete and all-encompassing.\n\nIt contains several comments worthy of repetition in light of more recent debates, such as regarding Intelligent Design. For example:\n\nNot one species of any creature which flourished before the tertiary (Ehrenberg's infusoria excepted) now exists; and of the mammalia which arose during that series, many forms are altogether gone, while of others we have now only kindred species. Thus to find not only frequent additions to the previous existing forms, but frequent withdrawals of forms which had apparently become inappropriate — a constant shifting as well as advance — is a fact calculated very forcibly to arrest attention. A candid consideration of all these circumstances can scarcely fail to introduce into our minds a somewhat different idea of organic creation from what has hitherto been generally entertained. (p.152)\n\nIn other words, the fact of extinction — which can be observed in the fossil layers —suggests that some designs were flawed. From this, the author concludes:\n\nSome other idea must then come to with regard to \"the mode\" in which the Divine Author proceeded in the organic creation. (p.153)\n\nBut the suggestion is not a mechanism, as Darwin would propose fifteen years later. The author merely notes that a continually active God is unnecessary:\n\n...how can we suppose that the august Being who brought all these countless worlds into form by the simple establishment of a natural principle flowing from his mind, was to interfere personally and specially on every occasion when a new shell-fish or reptile was to be ushered into existence on \"one\" of these worlds? Surely this idea is too ridiculous to be for a moment entertained. (p.154)\n\nHe furthermore suggests that this interpretation may be based upon corrupt theology:\n\nThus, the scriptural objection quickly vanishes, and the prevalent ideas about the organic creation appear only as a mistaken inference from the text, formed at a time when man's ignorance prevented him from drawing therefrom a just conclusion. (p.156)\n\nAnd praises God for his foresight in generating such wondrous variety from so elegant a method, while chastening those who would oversimplify His accomplishment:\n\nTo a reasonable mind the Divine attributes must appear, not diminished or reduced in some way, by supposing a creation by law, but infinitely exalted. It is the narrowest of all views of the Deity, and characteristic of a humble class of intellects, to suppose him acting constantly in particular ways for particular occasions. It, for one thing, greatly detracts from his foresight, the most undeniable of all the attributes of Omnipotence. It lowers him towards the level of our own humble intellects. Much more worthy of him it surely is, to suppose that all things have been commissioned by him from the first, though neither is he absent from a particle of the current of natural affairs in one sense, seeing that the whole system is continually supported by his providence. (pp.156–157)\n\nFollowing its publication, there was increasing support for ideas of the coexistence of God and Nature, with the deity setting Natural Laws rather than continually intervening with miracles. It is perhaps for this reason that \"Origin of Species\" was accepted so readily, upon its eventual publication. On the other hand, the knowledge of the scandal and experience of the reaction of his scientist friends confirmed Darwin's reluctance to publish his own ideas until he had well researched answers to all possible objections (though, in the end, Darwin had to publish earlier than he had wanted to anyway).\n\nThe book argued for an evolutionary view of life in the same spirit as the late Frenchman Jean-Baptiste Lamarck. Lamarck had long been discredited among intellectuals by the 1840s and evolutionary (or development) theories were exceedingly unpopular, except among the political radicals, materialists, and atheists. Charles Lyell had thoroughly criticized Lamarck's ideas in the second edition of his monumental work \"Principles of Geology\". Thus, it was naturally tempting for some critics to simply dismiss \"Vestiges\" as Lamarckian. Chambers, however, tried to explicitly distance his own theory from that of Lamarck's by denying Lamarck's evolutionary mechanism any plausibility.\nNow it is possible that wants and the exercise of faculties have entered in some manner into the production of the phenomena which we have been considering; but certainly not in the way suggested by Lamarck, whose whole notion is obviously so inadequate to account for the rise of the organic kingdoms, that we only can place it with pity among the follies of the wise. (p.231)\n\nIn an (anonymous) autobiographical preface written in the third person that only appeared in the 10th edition, Chambers remarked that \"He had heard of the hypothesis of Lamarck; but it seemed to him to proceed upon a vicious circle, and he dismissed it as wholly inadequate to account for the existence of animated species.\"\n\nThe book quickly became a best-seller, and a sensation which was eagerly read in royal circles. Every afternoon for a period early in 1845, Prince Albert read it aloud to Queen Victoria as a suitable popular science book explaining the latest ideas from the continent. Abraham Lincoln is reported to have read the book and been \"deeply impressed with the notion of the so-called 'universal law' – evolution.\" It was well received by middle class readers and unorthodox clergymen, particularly of Nonconformist church groups such as Unitarians. At first scientists ignored the book and it took time before hostile reviews were published, but the book was then publicly denounced by scientists, preachers, and statesmen. Notably, Sir David Brewster, wrote a very critical review of the work in the \"North British Review\", where he stated:\n\nDiscoveries in geology, or in physics imperfectly developed, and portions of Scripture imperfectly interpreted, might be expected to place themselves in temporary collision; but who could have anticipated any general speculations on the natural history of creation, which would startle the pious student, or for a moment disturb the serenity of the Christian world? Such an event, however, has occurred, and on the author of the work before us rests its responsibility. Prophetic of infidel times, and indicating the unsoundness of our general education, \"\"The Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation\",\" has started into public favour with a fair chance of poisoning the fountains of science, and sapping the foundations of religion. Popular in its subject, as well as in its expositions, this volume has obtained a wide circulation among the influential classes of society. It has been read and applauded by those who can neither weigh its facts, nor appreciate its argument, nor detect its tendencies; while those who can - the philosopher, the naturalist, and the divine - have concurred in branding it with their severest censure.\n\nSince around 1800, ideas of evolutionism had been denounced as examples of dangerous materialism, which undermined natural theology and the argument from design, threatening the current moral and social order. Such ideas were propagated by lower class Radicals seeking to overturn divine justification of the (aristocratic) social order. Chambers supported middle class political interests, and saw laws of progress in nature as implying inevitable political progress. He sought to sanitise the radical tradition by presenting progressive evolution as an unfolding of divinely planned laws of creation as development up to and including the appearance of human species. The political climate had eased as increasing prosperity reduced fears of revolution, and the book was widely considered to be merely scandalous and titillating. It was read not only by members of high society, but also — thanks to the rise of cheap publishing — the lower and middle classes, and continued to sell in large quantities for the rest of the 19th century.\n\nThe establishment might have tolerated a predesigned law of creation, but \"Vestiges\" presented a progressive law with humanity as its goal, and thus continuity which treated the human race as the last step in the ascent of animal life. It included arguments that mental and moral faculties were not unique to humans, but resulted from expansion of brain size during this ascent. This materialism was rejected by the religious and scientific establishment, and scientists were incensed that Chambers had bypassed their authority by appealing directly to the reading public and reaching a wide audience.\n\nThe publisher John Churchill had, as instructed, distributed free review copies to numerous daily and weekly newspapers, and many carried advertisements giving one line quotations or ran excerpts from the book, with even the Scottish evangelical \"Witness\" giving it publicity and credence in this way. Several carried substantial reviews, one of the first appearing in mid November 1844 in the weekly reform newspaper the \"Examiner\":\n\nAs a result of this publicity the first edition of 1,750 copies sold out in a few days. Among those fortunate enough to have ordered their copy promptly, Tennyson commented to his bookseller that the review suggested it \"seems to contain many speculations with which I have been familiar for years, and on which I have written more than one poem.\" Having read the book, he concluded \"There was nothing degrading in the theory.\" Benjamin Disraeli told his sister that the book was \"convulsing the world, anonymous\" and his wife told her that \"Dizzy says it does and will cause the greatest sensation and confusion.\"\n\nThe limited number of copies available at first were targeted at a select fashionable readership. The late Autumn literary season was just getting under way as the first reviews appeared, and by early January the book was the subject of conversations at elite literary gatherings. At venues such as Buckingham Palace and Lady Byron's parties, cosmic evolution became a topic of discussion for the first time in many years. Reforming medical journals including \"The Lancet\" for 23 November 1844 carried favourable reviews, while criticising specific points. In January the Unitarian quarterly \"Prospective\" gave powerful support, but the influential prestige quarterlies which could determine the long term success of books were still looking for reviewers.\n\nEarly in 1845 critical reviews appeared in the \"Athenaeum\", the \"Literary Gazette\" and \"The Gardeners' Chronicle\". The most authoritative scientific and literary weekly was the \"Athenaeum\", and its anonymous review of 4 January was by Edwin Lankester. Churchill had already been alarmed by \"The Lancet\"'s report of numerous mistakes, and had been surprised to find that, unlike the medical specialists he usually dealt with, the author of \"Vestiges\" lacked first hand knowledge of the subject or the ability to correct proofs. At the author's request he had quoted for a \"people's edition\", but was unwilling to proceed with this cheap reprint until errors had been corrected. Churchill engaged Lankester to make corrections to terminology to the second edition published in December 1844, and both Lankaster and George Fownes made further revisions for the third edition.\n\nWhile the season's fashionable use of \"Vestiges\" as a conversation piece in London society avoided theological implications, the book was read very differently in Liverpool, where it was first made public that men of science condemned the book, and it became the subject of sustained debate in newspapers. The book was attractive to reformers, including Uniformitarians and William Ballantyne Hodgson, the principal of the Mechanics' Institution who, like Chambers, had become a supporter of George Combe's ideas. In defence of public morals and Evangelical Tory dominance in the city, the Reverend Abraham Hume, an Anglican priest and lecturer, delivered a detailed attack on \"Vestiges\" at the Liverpool Literary and Philosophical Society on 13 January 1845, demonstrating that the book conflicted with standard specialist scientific texts on nebulae, fossils and embryos, and accusing it of manipulative novelistic techniques occupying \"the debatable ground between science and fiction\". At the next meeting two weeks later John Robberds, son of John Gooch Robberds the minister, defended the book as well-intentioned and based on \"deep reflection and extensive research\", while noting that he considered it inconsistent in distinguishing miracles from natural law, against his Unitarian views. As subsequent debates appeared inconclusive, Hume wrote to leading men of science for authoritative expert opinions, and made the responses public to resolve the dispute. This backfired when a writer in the \"Liverpool Journal\" pointed out inconsistencies and contradictions between the various expert opinions. They only agreed on the point that \"Vestiges\" was unscientific, and the publication of their letters was considered bad manners as well as tactically unwise. Few of the experts would have allowed any direct reference to the book to be published under their names, and their gentlemanly disagreements to be made public.\n\nAnglican clergymen were usually quick to publish pamphlets on any theological controversy, but tended to excuse themselves from responding to \"Vestiges\" as they lacked expertise: men of science were expected to lead the counterattack. The universities of Oxford and Cambridge were part of the Anglican establishment, intended to educate Christian gentlemen with half of the students becoming clergymen. Science subjects were optional lectures. The professors were scientific clergymen with strong reputations, and at Cambridge science had developed as natural theology, but there was no unified scientific establishment. The quarterly review magazines turned to them for commentary on the book, but demonstrating that it was superficial was difficult when its range of topics meant experts being drawn into superficial responses outside their own area of intensive expertise. William Whewell refused all requests for a review to avoid dignifying the \"bold, speculative and false\" work, but was the first to give a response, publishing \"Indications of a Creator\" in mid February 1845 as a slim and elegant volume of \"theological extracts\" from his writings. His aim was to inform superficial London society used to skimming books as conversation pieces and lacking properly prepared minds to deal with real philosophy and real science, and he avoided mentioning \"Vestiges\" by name. During the crucial early months of the debate this and Hume's lecture distributed as a pamphlet were the only responses to \"Vestiges\" published by the established clergy, and there were just two other short works opposing it: a published lecture by the Anabaptist preacher John Sheppard, and an unorthodox anti-science piece by Samuel Richard Bosanquet.\n\nThere was a wide range of readings of the book among the aristocracy interested in science, who assessed it independently without dismissing it out of hand. Sir John Cam Hobhouse wrote his thoughts down in his diary: \"In spite of the allusions to the creative will of God the cosmogony is atheistic—at least the introduction of an author of all things seems very like a formality for the sake of saving appearances—it is not a necessary part of the scheme\". While disquieted by its information on embryology implying human origins from animals, he thought its tone was good. He concluded that \"It does not meddle with revealed religion—but unless I am mistaken the leaders of revealed religion will meddle with it.\" Lord Morpeth thought it had \"much that is able, startling, striking\" and progressive development did not conflict with Genesis more than then current geology, but did \"not care much for the notion that we are engendered by monkeys\" and objected strongly to the idea that the Earth was \"a member of a democracy\" of similar planets.\n\n\"Vestiges\" was published in New York, and in response the April 1845 issue of the \"North American Review\" published a long review, the start of which was scathing about its reliance on speculative scientific theories: \"The writer has taken up almost every questionable fact and startling hypothesis, that have been promulgated by proficients and pretenders in science during the present century...The nebular hypothesis...spontaneous generation...the Macleay system, dogs playing dominoes, negroes born of white parents, materialism, phrenology, - he adopts them all, and makes them play an important part in his own magnificent theory, to the exclusion, to a great degree, of the well-accredited facts and established doctrines of science.\"\n\nThe Reverend Adam Sedgwick, the Woodwardian Professor of Geology at Cambridge, was popular and well regarded, having recently strongly defended the new geology against the Reverend Sir William Cockburn, a Scriptural geologist. He turned down several invitations to review \"Vestiges\", pleading lack of time, but in March read it closely and on 6 April discussed with other leading clergymen the \"rank materialism\" of the book \"against which work he & all other scientific men are indignant\". He thought the \"hasty jumping to conclusions\" indicated a female author. In a letter to Charles Lyell about \"the foul book\", he expressed his disgust: \"If the book be true, the labours of sober induction are in vain; religion is a lie; human law is a mass of folly, and a base injustice; morality is moonshine; our labours for the black people of Africa were works of madmen; and man and woman are only better beasts! ... I cannot but think the work is from a woman's pen, it is so well dressed and so graceful in its externals. I do not think the 'beast man' could have done this part so well.\" On 10 April he contacted Macvey Napier, editor of the \"Edinburgh Review\", who quickly accepted the offer. Sedgwick was rather disorganised and had not written a review before. To save time batches of his writing were typeset on arrival, so one part was being printed \"while the other part was still uncoiling from my brain in Cambridge.\" Napier did not insist on the usual concise review, but as it was still arriving in mid May stopped it at what became 85 pages, one of the longest reviews the quarterly ever published.\n\nThe British Association for the Advancement of Science annual meeting was held at Cambridge in June 1845, giving its president John Herschel a platform to counter \"Vestiges\". His presidential address contrasted the \"sound and thoughtful and sobering discipline\" of the scientific brotherhood with the \"over-hasty generalisation\" and \"pure speculation\" of the unnamed book. He had a cold and his words were badly delivered, but they appeared in newspapers across the country as its most prestigious man of science dismissing the book. For the rest of the week attacks on \"Vestiges\" continued. In the geology section, Roderick Murchison used his lecture to clear up the confusion between competing views, and say that \"every piece of geological evidence sustained the belief that that each species was perfect in its kind when first called into being by the Creator\". Sedgwick set aside his differences with Murchison to summarise his forthcoming \"Edinburgh\" review and agree in opposing the evolutionary ideas and the \"desolating pantheism\" of the book.\n\nSedgwick's long, rambling and scathing article was published in the July 1845 edition of the \"Edinburgh Review\". Articles were anonymous, but he ensured that his authorship was well known. He had disregarded William Whewell's caution about attempting a point by point refutation, and the body of his review followed the structure of \"Vestiges\", packed with current evidence to undermine the supposition of continuous transitions underlying the progressive development hypothesis which he scorned as mere speculation, and pointing out errors showing the inadequate expertise of the author. \"Vestiges\" crucially undermined the separation between man and beast, and endangered hopes for the afterlife. Sedgwick expressed concern for \"our glorious maidens and matrons ... listening to the seductions of this author; who comes before them with a bright, polished, and many-coloured surface, and the serpent coils of a false philosophy, and asks them again to stretch out their hands and pluck forbidden fruit\", who tells them \"that their Bible is a fable when it teaches them that they were made in the image of God—that they are the children of apes and breeders of monsters—that he has \"annulled all distinction between physical and moral\"\", which in Sedgwick's view would lead to \"a rank, unbending and degrading materialism\" lacking the proper reading of nature as analogy to draw moral lessons from physical truths. That needed the use of reason by great men who believed that \"moral truth is the ennobled form of material truth\" and that \"all nature, both material and moral, has been framed and supported by one creative mind\" so that one truth could never be in conflict with another. In presenting natural law as explaining the soul, \"Vestiges\" threatened the fine balance between faith and science.\n\nJournals that had already opposed the book welcomed Sedgwick's article, with the \"Literary Gazette\" calling it a \"scourging and irrefragable review\", as did sections of the church which were suspicious of science and geology. However, its crude vehemence was ill-suited to fashionable society, and Whewell wrote \"To me the material appears excellent, but the workmanship bad, and I doubt if it will do its work.\" Aristocrats found its \"lengthy inefficiency\" heavy going, and John Gibson Lockhart of the Tory \"Quarterly Review\" suspected that \"The \"savants\" are all sore at the vestige man because they are likely to be in the same boat as him.\" The extreme liberal press also thought \"a mere anonymous bookmaker might well be sacrificed to evidence the orthodoxy of a Cambridge divine\", in the hope of \"immunity to their own speculations, by a cheap display of eloquent zeal against all who dare to go beyond their measure.\"\n\nThere was renewed debate in correspondence in newspapers. The publisher Churchill advised the anonymous author against meeting attacks by going to the people with a cheap edition, and was told that the author was \"writing a defence of the book, with particular reference to the coarse attack of Mr. Sedgfield\", with the intention of publishing it as letters to \"The Times\" followed by a pamphlet. On Churchill's advice the response was broadened into a 206-page book bound to match the original work, which was published at the end of 1845 at a price of five shillings under the title of \"Explanations: A Sequel to the Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation\", a \"forcible and argumentative work\" aimed at \"convincing open-minded men\", published anonymously \"By the author of that work\". The revised fifth edition of \"Vestiges\" was ready in January 1846, and the two were commonly sold together, catching the publicity from reviews of \"Explanations\".\n\nThe \"North British Review\" reflected evangelical Presbyterian willingness to consider science in relation to \"Reason and not to Faith\" and to view natural law as directly guided by God, but warned that \"If it has been revealed to man that the Almighty made him out of the dust of the earth, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, it is in vain to tell a Christian that man was originally a speck of albumen, and passed through the stages of monads and monkeys, before he attained his present intellectual pre-eminence.\" Many women admired the book, and \"It would augur ill for the rising generation if the mothers of England were infected with the errors of Phrenology: it would augur worse were they tainted with materialism.\"\n\nChambers planned one more \"edition for the higher classes and for libraries\", extensively revised to deal with errors and incorporate the latest science, such as the detail of the Orion Nebula revealed by Lord Rosse's giant telescope. Use of generous spacing and the additional text extended the book by 20%, and the price had to be increased from 7s.6d. to nine shillings. The identical text was used for the long-awaited \"people's edition\", which was smaller with cheap bindings, smaller lettering and more closely spaced text. The cheap edition was printed first, but set aside until after the gentlemen's edition was published so that it would appear as a reprint of the expensive 6th edition, and not the other way around. The price was only 2s.6d. and five thousand copies were issued, almost as many as the first four editions combined. It sold well, though sales of the expensive edition were slow.\n\nSedgwick added a 400+ page preface to the 5th edition of his \"Discourse on the Studies of the University of Cambridge\" (1850), including a lengthy attack on \"Vestiges\" and theories of development in general.\n\nAmong religious criticisms, some maintained that Chambers' use of \"natural law\" to explain the creation of the planets and the successive creation of new species, including man, excluded the possibility of miracles and providential control. In other words, under this scheme, God did not personally interact with His creation after bringing forth these initial Laws. For these critics, this was akin to denying the central miracle of Christianity and, therefore, Christianity itself.\n\nAmong the early readers of \"Vestiges\", Charles Darwin had conceived his own theory of natural selection to explain evolution six years earlier, and in July 1844 had written down his ideas in an '\"Essay\". For a year he had been tentatively discussing his evolutionary ideas in correspondence with Joseph Dalton Hooker, who wrote to Darwin on 30 December 1844 that he had \"been delighted with \"Vestiges\", from the multiplicity of facts he brings together, though I do [not] agree with his conclusions at all, he must be a funny fellow: somehow the books looks more like a 9 days wonder than a lasting work: it certainly is “filling at the price”.— I mean the price its reading costs, for it is dear enough otherwise; he has lots of errors.\" Darwin had read the book in November, finding that it drew on some of the lines of evidence he had been putting together, and introduced questions that had to be dealt with. He responded that he had been \"somewhat less amused at it ... the writing & arrangement are certainly admirable, but his geology strikes me as bad, & his zoology far worse. Darwin had learnt geology from Adam Sedgwick, and was particularly interested in what his former mentor had to say about evolution. In October 1845 he wrote to his friend Charles Lyell that Sedgwick's review was a \"grand piece of argument against mutability of species\" which he had read with \"fear & trembling,\" but had been \"well pleased to find\" that he had anticipated Sedgwick's objections and \"had not overlooked any of the arguments\".\n\nHe read \"Explanations\" early in 1846 and thought \"the spirit of [it], though not the facts, ought to shame Sedgwick\", while noting speculation and evidence suggesting that Chambers had written the books. In April 1847, after meeting Chambers then subsequently receiving a presentation of \"Vestiges\", Darwin became convinced that Chambers must have been the author.\n\nIn his introduction to \"On the Origin of Species\", published in 1859, Darwin assumed that his readers were aware of \"Vestiges\", and wrote identifying what he felt was one of its gravest deficiencies with regards to its theory of biological evolution:\n\nThe author of the 'Vestiges of Creation' would, I presume, say that, after a certain unknown number of generations, some bird had given birth to a woodpecker, and some plant to the mistletoe, and that these had been produced perfect as we now see them; but this assumption seems to me to be no explanation, for it leaves the case of the coadaptations of organic beings to each other and to their physical conditions of life, untouched and unexplained.\n\nChambers took the publication of the \"Origin\" as an opportunity to release a new edition of \"Vestiges\" and respond to Darwin's comments, lamenting that Darwin had misunderstood the \"Vestiges\". \"It seems to the author,\" Chambers wrote, \"that Mr. Darwin has only been enabled by his infinitely superior knowledge to point out a principle in what may be called practical animal life, which appears capable of bringing about the modifications theoretically assumed in the earlier work. His book, in no essential respect, contradicts the present: on the contrary...it expresses substantially the same general ideas.\" In perhaps a gross simplification, Chambers concludes that \"The difference seems to be in words, not in facts or effects.\" At the very least, Chambers saw in Darwin a much needed ally – one that he simply could not afford to have against him.\n\nIt is probable that Darwin read Chambers's comments, because he removed the offending passage from the 3rd edition of the \"Origin\" (1861) and all subsequent editions. In a historical sketch, newly added to the 3rd edition, Darwin softened his language a bit:\n\nThe author apparently believes that organisation progresses by sudden leaps, but that the effects produced by the conditions of life are gradual. He argues with much force on general grounds that species are not immutable productions. But I cannot see how the two supposed \"impulses\" account in a scientific sense for the numerous and beautiful co-adaptations which we see throughout nature; I cannot see that we thus gain any insight how, for instance, a woodpecker has become adapted to its peculiar habits of life. The work, from its powerful and brilliant style, though displaying in the earlier editions little accurate knowledge and a great want of scientific caution, immediately had a very wide circulation.\n\nDarwin even suggested that Chambers' book helped pave the way for the publication of his theory of evolution by natural selection. \"In my opinion it has done excellent service in this country in calling attention to the subject, in removing prejudice, and in thus preparing the ground for the reception of analogous views.\"\n\nThe harsh reception that \"Vestiges\" received, and the mockery which was made of its evolutionary ideas, has been cited by some historians as a factor leading to Darwin's caution in publishing his own theory of evolution. In a letter to Thomas Henry Huxley in 1854 (five years before his own book on evolution was published but twelve years after its ideas had first been sketched out in an unpublished essay), Darwin expressed sympathy for the (still anonymous) author of \"Vestiges\" in the face of a savage review by Huxley: \"I must think that such a book, if it does no other good, spreads the taste for Natural Science. But I am perhaps no fair judge, for I am almost as unorthodox about species as the \"Vestiges\" itself, though I hope not quite so unphilosophical.\" However, later the same year, in a letter to Hooker, Darwin mentioned \"Vestiges\" in a more sober tone: \"I should have less scruple in troubling you if I had any confidence what my work would turn out. Sometimes I think it will be good, at other times I really feel as much ashamed of myself as the author of the \"Vestiges\" ought to be of himself.\"\n\nAccording to the historian James A. Secord, \"Vestiges\" outsold \"The Origin of Species\" up until the early 20th century.\n\nIt was reading \"Vestiges\" in 1845 that first inclined Alfred Russel Wallace to believe that the transmutation of species occurred. It was this belief that would lead him to plan his early field work with the idea of collecting data on the geographic distribution of closely allied species in hopes of finding evidence to support the idea. Wallace made the following comments on the concept of transmutation of species as described in \"Vestiges\" in a letter to Henry Bates a few months after first reading it:\n\nBecause the book was published anonymously, speculation on the authorship naturally began as soon as it was released. Many people were suspected, including, Charles Darwin (\"I ought to be much flattered & unflattered\"), the geologist Charles Lyell, the phrenologist George Combe, as well as many of the people whose work the book often cited. Early on, Sir Richard Vyvyan, the Tory leader of the parliamentary opposition to the Reform Bill, was a popular suspect. Vyvyan held interests in natural philosophy, phrenology, and Lamarckian evolution. Only three years earlier he had privately printed his own evolutionary cosmology, a copy of which he sent to the English anatomist Richard Owen. The latter likely explains the discrepancy between Owen's critical letter to William Whewell on the \"Vestiges\" and his flattering letter to the author, whom he probably thought to be Vyvyan. It was even suggested at one point that Prince Albert might have secretly written it. Adam Sedgwick, as well as others, initially thought that the work was likely written by a woman, either Harriet Martineau or the Countess Ada Lovelace. A feminine authorship was thought to explain all of the book's scientific failings.\n\nRobert Chambers became a prominent suspect as early as the spring of 1845. In 1854, following the publication of the 10th edition of \"Vestiges\" along with its anonymous biographical sketch, a former assistant named David Page accused Chambers directly. The accusation was printed in the \"Athenaeum\", but because Page was an embittered former employee of the Chambers's firm, his testimony was not taken very seriously. Vyvyan finally denied that he was the author outright and the British Museum listed the book under George Combe's name as late as 1877.\n\nAfter Robert's death in 1871 his brother, William, penned a biography for Robert but refused to reveal the secret. He only mentioned the \"Vestiges\" to note that Robert's suspected authorship was used as a means to discredit him when he ran for the office of Lord Provost of Edinburgh in 1848. The secret was finally revealed in 1884, when Alexander Ireland issued a new 12th edition with Robert's name and an introduction explaining the circumstances behind its publication.\n\nChambers made important revisions to the book, refining his arguments, addressing the many criticisms and reacting to new scientific publications. He added and deleted whole sections so that the content of the last edition differs substantially from that of the first.\nMany of the editions were reprinted in the United States. At least 14 versions are known; published by Wiley and Putnam, New York (two in 1845, 1846), Colyer, New York (1846), Harper, New York (1847, 1854, 1856, 1858, 1859, 1860, 1862, 1868) and James, Cincinnati (1852, 1858). After 1846, the American editions usually included \"Explanations\".\n\nThe book was translated to five languages. The first translation, into German, was by A. F. Seubert (Becher, Stuttgart, 1846) followed by the Dutch version prepared by J.H. van den Broek (Broese, Utrecht, 1849 and 1850). A second German translation was completed by Carl Vogt (F. Vieweg, Brauchweig, 1851 and 1858). J. Somody's translation into Hungarian was based on the tenth London edition (and was published by the Calvinist High School, Pápa, 1858, reprinted in Pest, 1861). F. Majocchi translated the book into Italian (Cairo, Codogno, 1860). The Russian edition (Cherenin & Ushakov, Moscow, 1863, 1868) was adapted by A. Palhovsky from Vogt's 1858 translation.\n\nThe first nine London editions and many translations of \"Vestiges\" included relatively few or no illustrations. The best-known image is the embryological-phylogenetic tree (see above) drawn after a diagram that appeared three years earlier in W. B. Carpenter's book, \"The Principles of General and Comparative Physiology\" (Churchill, London). Chambers acknowledged this fact only in the fifth edition of \"Vestiges\". The diagram persisted in the first nine editions and appeared with minor changes in all but the Hungarian translation. The first two editions also contained a tree-like triangular diagram by which Chambers wanted to illustrate the Quinarian classification system of animals. Three mistakes in the text and the graph made this figure hard to understand and it was therefore completely ignored by historians of science. Since the Quinarian system had lost its popularity even before the first edition of \"Vestiges\" came out, Chambers decided to remove the material from the 3rd edition onwards. \nA third conceptual scheme from \"Vestiges\" is that of animal genealogy that first appeared in the 6th edition. It demonstrates how Chambers’ views changed from the Quinarian system to a genealogical classification. Using fossil examples from the Silurian, the author suggested that different forms evolved independently along parallel routes. Chambers raised the possibility of drawing a Genealogical tree of Being, but never attempted to prepare one.\n\nThe book was often criticized for the lack of natural history illustrations which made the contents difficult to follow for a general reader. In fact, two translators had recognized the problem early on. Vogt included many figures of fossils in the German translation, whereas van den Broek added two atlases as supplements to the Dutch version to illustrate fossils and recent animals. Eventually, Chambers realized the importance of illustrative material and asked Carpenter to select plant and animal images, mostly from his own book. One hundred and seven figures were then included in the tenth edition (1853), for example, the mammoth figure shown above. Actually, the number of different figures was only 100, because seven of them appeared twice in the book. The only translation in which the full set of figures also appears is the Hungarian one.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1820218", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1820218", "title": "Shadow of the Colossus", "text": "Shadow of the Colossus\n\nShadow of the Colossus, released in Japan as \"Wander and the Colossus\", is an action-adventure game developed by SCE Japan Studio and Team Ico, and published by Sony Computer Entertainment for the PlayStation 2. The game was released in North America and Japan in October 2005 and PAL regions in February 2006. It was directed by Fumito Ueda and developed at SCEI's International Production Studio 1, also known as Team Ico; the same development team responsible for the cult hit \"Ico\", to which the game is considered a spiritual successor.\n\nThe game's storyline focuses on a young man named Wander who enters a forbidden land. Wander must travel across a vast expanse on horseback and defeat sixteen massive beings, known simply as colossi, in order to restore the life of a girl named Mono. The game is unusual within the action-adventure genre in that there are no towns or dungeons to explore, no characters with whom to interact, and no enemies to defeat other than the colossi. \"Shadow of the Colossus\" has been described as a puzzle game, as each colossus can only be killed by attacking certain weak points which require specific actions to access.\n\nCited as an influential title in the video game industry and one of the greatest video games of all time, \"Shadow of the Colossus\" is often regarded as an important example of video game as art due to its minimalist landscape designs, immersive gameplay, and emotional journey. It received wide critical acclaim by the media and was met with strong sales compared to \"Ico\", due in part to a larger marketing campaign. The soundtrack was also widely praised. The game won several awards for its audio, design, and overall quality. \"Shadow of the Colossus\" is also referenced numerous times in debates regarding the art quality and emotional perspectives of video games.\n\nA remastered version for the PlayStation 3 was developed by Bluepoint Games and released alongside \"Ico\" as \"The Ico & Shadow of the Colossus Collection\" in September 2011. It features high-definition (HD) graphics, content previously missing from the North American version, PlayStation Network Trophies, and 3D support. The HD version was released separately in Japan. A high-definition remake for the PlayStation 4 by Bluepoint Games was released in February 2018.\n\nProgression through \"Shadow of the Colossus\" occurs in cycles. Beginning at a central point in an expansive landscape, the player seeks out and defeats a colossus, and is then returned to the central point to repeat the process. To find each colossus, Wander may raise his sword while in a sunlit area to reflect beams of light, which will converge when the sword is pointed in the right direction of the next encounter. The journey to a colossus is seldom a straightforward matter: stretches of varied terrain often require that a detour be taken along the way. Most colossi are located in remote areas, such as atop cliffs or within ancient structures.\n\nOnce a colossus is found, the player must discover its weaknesses to defeat it. Each colossus dwells in a unique lair, and many colossi cannot be defeated without making use of the surrounding environment. Every colossus has at least one weak point, indicated by a glowing sigil that can be illuminated and identified by the sword's reflected light. Each colossus has areas covered with fur or protruding ledges, which Wander may use to grip and scale the colossus while it thrashes about in an attempt to dislodge him. While scaling a colossus, the player must act quickly, as Wander has a limited stamina gauge that decreases while he hangs onto the creature.\n\nWander and the colossi have life bars to indicate their remaining health. A colossus' health will decrease significantly when its weak points are attacked, while Wander can be harmed by a colossus' attacks or a fall from a great height. Throughout the game, Wander is equipped with only a sword and a bow with arrows, but may obtain other weapons from completing the Time Attack trials.\n\nWhile the colossi are the only enemies, there are natural animals in the environment. Only one species, however, has an effect on gameplay: eating the tail of a certain kind of lizard increases Wander's stamina gauge. Likewise, the player may find fruit that increases Wander's maximum health.\n\nWander's horse, Agro, plays a large role in the game. In addition to serving as a means of transportation, fighting from horseback is vital to defeating some of the colossi. There are, however, many environments that cannot be traversed by horse, and colossi often inhabit areas within deep water or beyond large obstacles that must be scaled. Agro cannot travel beyond these, and when separated from Wander by such obstacles, cannot participate in the following battle. Agro is referred to as a male in the English-language version of the game, though director Fumito Ueda said that he saw Wander's horse as female.\n\nThe environment must be used to the player's advantage more often as the game progresses. The first two battles take place on simple, large, flat areas of land, with the only goal being to discover how to scale the colossi and attack their weak points. However, the majority of the following fourteen battles require that some aspect of the battlefield be used.\n\nDuring \"Shadow of the Colossus\", the player receives little information concerning the backstories of the characters and their relationships with one another. The game takes place in a fantasy setting, with most of the game's events occurring within a vast and unpopulated peninsula, known as the Forbidden Land, separated from the outside world by a mountain range to its north and sea to the south and east. The presence of ruins and other ancient structures indicate the area was once a settlement.\n\nThe region is only accessible via a small cleft in the mountains to the north, leading to a massive stone bridge. This bridge spans half the distance of the landscape and terminates at a large temple called the \"Shrine of Worship\" located at its center. It is, however, forbidden to enter the land, which is characterized by diverse geographical features, such as lakes, plateaus, canyons, caves, and deserts in addition to human-made structures.\n\nThe protagonist of the game is , a young man whose goal is to resurrect a girl named . Little is known about Mono other than that she was a maiden who was somehow sacrificed because she was believed to have a cursed destiny. Wander and Mono were designed with long hair from the start of the design process, with Mono's long hair specifically as a contrast to Yorda of \"Ico\", who has short hair. Assisting Wander in his quest to revive her is his loyal horse, , who serves as his only ally in defeating the colossi. Wander also receives aid from an entity called . The story revolves around these characters but features a small supporting cast including Lord and his men.\n\nSpeaking with two voices at once (one male and one female), Dormin is a mysterious, disembodied entity. In legends of the game's world, it is said that Dormin has the power to revive the dead; it is for this reason that Wander enters the forbidden land, seeking its assistance in reviving Mono. Dormin offers to revive her in exchange for Wander destroying the sixteen colossi. \"Dormin\", which spells \"Nimrod\" backwards, has been speculated to be a reference to the body of the biblical King Nimrod which was cut up and scattered.\n\nLord Emon is a shaman who narrates a vision in the game's introduction, vaguely explaining the origin of the land Wander has come to, and emphasizing that entry to this place is forbidden. He is portrayed as having extensive knowledge regarding the nature and containment of Dormin, and the ability to use powerful magic. He has a small group of warriors at his command, and is pursuing Wander to prevent the use of \"the forbidden spell\", the ritual involving the destruction of the sixteen colossi and the restoration of Dormin's power.\n\nThe colossi are armored, most often enormous creatures with forms ranging from various humanoids to predatory animals, and live in all manner of surroundings and environments, including beneath water and flying through the air. Their bodies are a fusion of organic and inorganic parts such as rock, earth, fur, and architectural elements, some of which are weathered or fractured. Some colossi are peaceful and will only attack when provoked, while others are aggressive and will attack on sight. Inhabiting specific locations in the forbidden land, they do not venture outside their own territory. Once slain they will remain where fallen, as a mound of earth and rock vaguely resembling the original colossus. A pillar of light marks the location of each colossus after they are defeated. The Latin names of the colossi, though featured throughout fan related media, are not official and are never referred to within the game.\n\nThe story of \"Shadow of the Colossus\" begins as Wander enters the forbidden land, traveling across a long bridge on his horse, Agro. Unknown to the player, prior to entering, Wander had stolen an ancient sword, which is the only weapon capable of slaying the colossi. Led to the massive Shrine of Worship at the center of the region, Wander carries with him the body of a maiden named Mono. A moment later, several humanoid shadow creatures appear and approach Wander before he easily dismisses them with a wave of the ancient sword in his possession. After vanquishing the shadow creatures, the voice of the disembodied entity known as \"Dormin\" echoes from above, expressing surprise that Wander possesses the weapon. Wander requests that Dormin return Mono's soul to her body, which Dormin states may be possible on the condition that Wander can destroy the sixteen idols lining the temple's hall by using the ancient sword to kill each colossus the idols represent located throughout the land. Despite being warned by Dormin that he may have to pay a great price to revive Mono, Wander sets out to search the land for the colossi and destroy them.\n\nWhat Wander does not know is that the colossi contain portions of Dormin's own essence that were scattered long ago to render the entity powerless. As Wander kills each colossus, a released fragment of Dormin enters his body. Over time, the signs of Wander's deterioration from the gathered essence become clearer—his skin becoming paler, his hair darker, and dark streaks growing across his face. After the death of the twelfth colossus, it is revealed that Wander is being pursued by a group of warriors led by Emon. Urged to hurry with his task by Dormin, Wander soon heads off to defeat the sixteenth and final colossus. On the way to this confrontation, he travels on horseback across a long bridge which begins to collapse as he is halfway across. At the last second when it seems he will not make it, Wander is thrown to the other side by Agro before the horse falls into the distant river below.\n\nSoon after, Wander goes on to defeat the final colossus as Emon's company arrives in the Shrine of Worship to witness the last temple idol crumble. Wander appears back in the temple soon after, the signs of his corruption readily apparent: his skin is clammy, his eyes are milky, and a pair of tiny horns have sprouted from his head. Emon orders his warriors to kill the \"possessed\" man as he approaches Mono and finally falls once stabbed through the heart by one of Emon's men. However, a newly whole Dormin takes control of Wander's body and transforms into a shadowy giant. While his men flee, Lord Emon casts the ancient sword into a small pool at the back of the temple's hall to evoke a whirlwind of light that consumes Dormin and Wander, sealing Dormin within the temple once again. After fleeing with the bridge connecting to the temple collapsing behind them, forever isolating the forbidden land from the rest of the world, Emon expresses hope that Wander may be able to atone for his crimes one day should he have survived. Back in the temple, Mono awakens and finds Agro limping into the temple with an injured hind leg. Mono follows Agro to the pool into which Wander and Dormin were pulled by Emon's spell, finding a male infant with tiny horns on his head. She takes the child with her, following the horse to higher levels of the Shrine of Worship, and arrives at a secret garden within the shrine as the game ends.\n\n\"Shadow of the Colossus\" is considered both a spiritual successor and prequel to \"Ico\". For several months during and after the game's release, the game's director and lead designer, Fumito Ueda, maintained that the game's status as a prequel was simply his personal take on the game and not necessarily its canon nature, as he largely intended for players to decide the specifics of the story for themselves, but he confirmed the two do have a connection. Moreover, the shadowy figures which appear in the Shrine of Worship are connected to the shadows which the player must fight in \"Ico\". Both games feature \"horned\" characters for protagonists (Wander sprouts horns at the end of the game). The Queen's Sword from \"Ico\" is also available as a bonus unlockable item, and Agro has an alternate costume where the symbol from \"Ico\" is on her head. Both games also use unique fictional languages.\n\nWith a team of thirty-five people, \"Shadow of the Colossus\" began development in 2002 under the project name \"Nico\" (a portmanteau of \"ni\", 2 in Japanese, and \"Ico\") and was intended to be a sequel to \"Ico\". An early technology demo for the project shown at the DICE Summit in 2003 depicted a group of masked, horned boys riding horses while attacking and defeating a colossus. However, Fumito Ueda expressed that, at the time, it was simpler to reuse the character design of \"Ico\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s protagonist, and that he never explicitly desired a sequel to \"Ico\". Japanese pre-orders of \"Shadow of the Colossus\" later included a bonus DVD with the concept video, a trailer describing \"Nico\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s plot, and an introduction the development team states they wanted to use in \"Shadow of the Colossus\".\n\nUeda and producer Kenji Kaido held their team to a high standard throughout production. An admitted perfectionist, Ueda felt that only one or two out of 500 artists who applied to work on \"Shadow of the Colossus\" met his criteria, and often demanded thorough changes in design until it matched his vision. For his part, Kaido challenged the programmers to meet the concept of realistic physics in relation to the movement of the colossi and the subsequent effect this movement would have for Wander, both in terms of how he might be displaced and how he may be able to use this movement to his advantage. For instance, if a colossus were to shake, Kaido wanted Wander's position to shift realistically in response. Additionally, if a colossus' limb was currently horizontal, Kaido wanted the player to be able to run across the limb as though it were any other flat surface. He referred to these two concepts as \"player dynamics and reactions\" and \"organic collision deformation\". The realistic physics engine produced as a result required that faster colossi had to be smaller as well.\nUeda wished the game to have a unique presentation and change how both players and developers perceived the idea of what bosses should be in video games. To achieve this, he ensured that the game's only enemies would be the sixteen colossi, that they could only be approached one at a time, and that they would have various behavior patterns. Though limiting the presence of enemies to only bosses was partly intended to differentiate the game from others, Ueda also expressed that it was to ensure that the programmers' focus was entirely on the colossi so that their quality would be as high as possible. In accordance with this focus upon the colossi—and his preference for simple controls—he intended that one button on the game controller be used solely for targeting the colossi during battles. Ueda cited \"The Legend of Zelda\" as an influence on the boss design, referring to the bosses as \"inverted Zelda dungeons.\"\n\nA theme of companionship between the player and an AI-controlled partner was a concern for Ueda. In \"Ico\", this theme was presented through the protagonist and the character Yorda, whom the player was required to work with and protect while navigating the game's environments. Similarly, a key element in \"Shadow of the Colossus\" is the relationship between Wander and his horse, Agro. Intended to be a realistic representation of a horse, Agro will occasionally ignore commands. In Ueda's words, \"a real horse ... doesn't always obey. It's not like a car or a motorcycle, it won't always turn when you say 'turn!'\" However, he has admitted that the team had to seek a balance in how often Agro did not respond to commands so as to not sacrifice playability in the pursuit of realism.\n\nAll elements of the game—including audio, gameplay and visuals—were used to achieve an atmosphere of a \"lonely hero\", which Ueda considered important in the development of the game. Lighting, in particular, was used to establish a dark, fearsome setting for the forbidden land, while the protagonist's sword would provide a means of navigation that was \"direct and only expressible visually\". Like \"Ico\", \"Shadow of the Colossus\" uses a distinct style of lighting. The game's engine uses elements such as desaturated colors, motion blur and partial high dynamic range rendering, with a heavy emphasis on bloom lighting.\n\nA PlayStation 3 remastered version of \"Ico\" and \"Shadow of the Colossus\" was announced at Tokyo Game Show 2010 and released in September 2011. Developed by Bluepoint Games, both were improved graphically to take advantage of the PlayStation 3's hardware and HDTVs, with numerous other improvements implemented.\n\nIn the August 2019 interview Fumito Ueda mentioned that through the production of \"Shadow of the Colossus\", he started having doubts about simply “feeling good by beating monsters”. Instead, he started thinking if there were any other choices for different kinds of expression, then ended up with such settings and rules as a result. As a side note he mentioned that when he first showed his staff the sequence of sad-sounding music being played after defeating a colossus in \"Shadow of the Colossus\", they thought it was a bug and laughed because they were so used to games that would play a fanfare after defeating a monster.\n\nThe PAL version of the game was released in February 2006. Much like the PAL release for \"Ico\", the game came in cardboard packaging displaying various pieces of artwork from the game, and contained four art cards.\n\nThe game also came with a \"making of\" documentary, a trailer for \"Ico\" and a gallery of concept art, accessible from the game's main menu. Sony Computer Entertainment also re-released \"Ico\" in PAL territories at the time of \"Shadow of the Colossus\"s release, both to promote the game through \"Ico\"s reputation, and to allow players who did not buy \"Ico\" during its original limited release to \"complete their collections\".\n\nSome confusion has arisen in PAL regions concerning the official name of the protagonist primarily because of the manual's usage of \"Wanda\", while the North American manual and the game itself uses the name \"Wander\". In fact, the Japanese version of the game spells the name \"Wander\" as ワンダ (\"Wanda\"), which is also the common transliteration of the English name \"Wanda\", hence the mistake in the manual.\n\nWhile the game has an extensive orchestral soundtrack, the music is only heard during cut scenes and colossus encounters, while time spent at the Shrine of Worship and traversing the landscape is silent save for the sounds made by the protagonist, his horse and their surroundings. The open nature of the game world and lack of life, coupled with this limited use of music, aids in establishing an atmosphere of solitude, similar to that of \"Ico\".\n\nOn December 7, 2005, a soundtrack album containing music from the game was released only in Japan, titled . There are currently no announced plans to release the album in other territories, although it is readily available on video streaming sites such as YouTube. The game's score was composed by Kow Otani, whose previous video game work included the soundtracks to the PlayStation 2 flight simulator \"Sky Odyssey\" and the PlayStation shooter \"Philosoma\". He has also worked on several of the 1990s-era Gamera films, as well as a variety of anime. \"Roar of the Earth\" won the award for \"Soundtrack of the Year\" in the US-based video game magazine \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\".\n\nSony announced a remake of \"Shadow of the Colossus\" for the PlayStation 4 during their Electronic Entertainment Expo 2017 press conference. It was released on February 6, 2018. The remake is led by Bluepoint, who developed the earlier PlayStation 3 remaster. The developers remade all the game's assets from the ground up, but the game retains the same gameplay from the original title along with the introduction of a new control scheme. Ueda had since left Sony, but provided a list of recommended changes to Bluepoint for the remake; he stated that he does not believe many of them will be implemented, nor would they add any of the colossi that had been cut from the original game.\n\n\"Shadow of the Colossus\"s commercial reception was positive, with sales of 140,000 copies in its first week at retail in Japan, reaching number one in the charts. Almost 80% of the initial Japanese shipment was sold within two days. These figures compare favorably with \"Ico\", which was well received by critics but failed to sell a significant number of units. The game was placed on Sony's list of Greatest Hits titles on August 6, 2006.\n\nUnlike \"Ico\", \"Shadow of the Colossus\" received far more exposure, due in part to Sony putting its weight behind a massive advertising campaign. It was advertised in game magazines, on television and on the internet, including a viral marketing campaign launched in October 2005. The site posted links to several websites claiming that the remains of five giants resembling certain colossi had been discovered in various parts of the world. The website has since been taken down. Some speculate that \"Ico\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s sales figures could have been improved if similar advertising efforts were made before its release.\n\n\"Shadow of the Colossus\" received critical acclaim, with an average critic score of 91% at GameRankings, making it the 11th-highest rated game of 2005. These include the Japanese magazine \"Famitsu\", who rated the game 37/40, the UK-based \"Edge\", who awarded an 8/10, and \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\", who granted 8.8/10. GameSpot's review gave it an 8.7, commenting that \"the game's aesthetic presentation is unparalleled, by any standard\", while multimedia website IGN hailed the game as \"an amazing experience\" and \"an absolute must-have title\", rating it 9.7/10. GameSpy described it as \"possibly the most innovative and visually arresting game of the year for the PS2\". A retrospective \"Edge\" article described the game as \"a fiction of unquestionable thematic richness, of riveting emotional power, whose fundamental artistic qualities are completely fused with its interactivity.\" Dave Ciccoricco, a literature lecturer at the University of Otago, praised the game for its use of long cutscenes and stretches of riding to make the player engage in self-reflection and feel immersed in the game world.\n\nMany reviewers consider the game's soundtrack to be one of its greatest aspects. In addition to \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\"s award of \"Soundtrack of the Year\", GameSpot commented that the musical score conveyed, and often intensified, the mood of any given situation, while it was described as \"one of the finest game soundtracks ever\" by a reviewer from Eurogamer.\n\nHowever, the game has been criticised for its erratic frame rate, which is usually smooth while traversing the landscape, but often slows down in fast-paced situations, such as colossus battles. Concern was also expressed about the game's camera, which was described by GameSpy as being \"as much of an opponent as the Colossi\", \"manag[ing] to re-center itself at the worst and most inopportune times\". Reviewers are often mixed about Agro's AI and controls; while gaming website Thunderbolt insists the realism of Agro's movement and behaviour \"create[s] a videogame experience unlike any other\", \"Edge\" commented that the controls were \"clumsy, crude, and unpredictable\". Other critics like Game Revolution and GameSpot felt the game was too short (average playthrough time estimated 6 to 8 hours), with little replay value given the puzzle elements to each colossus battle.\n\n\"Shadow of the Colossus\" has received several awards, including recognition for \"Best Character Design\", \"Best Game Design\", \"Best Visual Arts\" and \"Game of the Year\", as well as one of three \"Innovation Awards\" at the 2006 Game Developers Choice Awards. At the 2006 DICE Summit, the game won the award for \"Outstanding Achievement in Art Direction\" at the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences, while it received one of two \"Special Rookie Awards\" at the Famitsu Awards 2005. It was nominated for \"Best Original Music\", \"Best Artistic Graphics\" and \"Best PS2 Game\", yet also \"Most Aggravating Frame Rate\" in GameSpot's awards for 2005, while it won \"Best Adventure Game\" and \"Best Artistic Design\" in IGN's Best of 2005 awards, who cited Agro as the best sidekick in the history of video games. Two years after its release IGN listed \"Shadow\" as the fourth greatest PlayStation 2 game of all time. Games Radar awarded it Best Game of the Year 2006 (being released in the UK in early 2006, later than the US), and appears in the site's \"The 100 best games ever\" list at number ten. The game's ending was selected as the fourth greatest moment in gaming by the editors of \"GamePro\" in July 2006. The readers of PlayStation Official Magazine voted it the 8th greatest PlayStation title ever released. Destructoid named the game #1 in their list of the top 50 video games of the decade. IGN named \"Shadow of the Colossus\" the best game of 2005, and the second best game of the decade, behind \"Half-Life 2\". In 2012, \"Complex\" magazine named \"Shadow of the Colossus\" the second-best PlayStation 2 game of all time, behind \"God of War II\". In 2015, the game placed 4th on USgamer's The 15 Best Games Since 2000 list.\n\n\"Shadow of the Colossus\" has been cited as an influence on various video games, including \"God of War II\" (2007), \"God of War III\" (2010), \"Titan Souls\" (2015), \"\" (2017), \"Death's Gambit\" (2018), and \"Praey for the Gods\". Film director Guillermo del Toro also cited both \"Ico\" and \"Shadow of the Colossus\" as \"masterpieces\" and part of his directorial influence.\n\nThe game plays a significant role in the 2007 Mike Binder film \"Reign Over Me\" as one of the ways Adam Sandler's character copes with his primary struggle – with aspects of the game mirroring the tragedy that befell Sandler's character; \"Shadow of the Colossus\" falling giants mirroring the crashing towers of the September 11 attacks in which his wife and children died, and the game's lead character trying to resurrect his deceased love are two of the main themes which strike a similarity. Sandler is said to have ad libbed a detailed description of the control scheme in a scene with Don Cheadle, who plays his old friend. Both actors are said to have become experts at the game during the filming.\n\nIn April 2009, it was reported that Sony Pictures would adapt \"Shadow of the Colossus\" into a film. Kevin Misher, producer of \"The Scorpion King\", \"The Interpreter\" and the recent attempted remake of \"Dune\", negotiated to produce. It was announced that Fumito Ueda, the game's creator, would be involved in the film's production. On May 23, 2012, it was reported that \"Chronicle\" director Josh Trank would be directing the film adaptation. Seth Lochhead was due to write the film. In September 2014, Variety reported that \"Mama\" director Andrés Muschietti would direct the film after Trank dropped out due to his commitment to one of the upcoming \"Star Wars\" spin-off movies.\n"}
{"id": "1820223", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1820223", "title": "Daniel Axtell", "text": "Daniel Axtell\n\nColonel Daniel Axtell (1622 – 19 October 1660) was captain of the Parliamentary Guard at the trial of King Charles I at Westminster Hall in 1649. Shortly after the Restoration he was hanged, drawn and quartered as a regicide. Apart from his participation in the regicide, he is best remembered for his participation in Pride's Purge of the Long Parliament.\n\nAxtell was a Baptist from Berkhamsted in Hertfordshire, who was apprenticed as a grocer. He joined the New Model Army, serving in John Pickering's regiment of Foote, and rose to the rank of colonel.\n\nAxtell played a big part in the English Civil War after being recruited by Parliament in 1643. He fought as an infantryman and was present at the sieges of Lindon (May 1644) and York (June 1644), along with the battle of Marston Moor and many other sieges and battles. Axtell was a keen puritan and in 1646 he and some other puritan soldiers started preaching in churches in Oxford. At that time it was illegal to preach unless one was a qualified clergyman, so he had to force the clergymen to give way.\n\nAxtell was a figure of some prominence in the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland. He played a role part in the storming of Drogheda and the massacre that ensued. After the town's walls and the internal earthworks had been successfully stormed by English Parliamentarians, Arthur Aston, the Royalist governor of Drogheda, and others retreated to a citadel on Windmill Mount, which was heavily fortified and could not easily be taken by assault.\n\nIt was on direct orders from Oliver Cromwell that the quarter that had been given to the defenders on Mill Mount by Axtell was overturned, and the unarmed prisoners were killed.\n\nGranny Grannagh castle beside the River Nore is an imposing ruin. \"In the civil wars\" writes Grosse \"it was strongly garrisoned for the King and commanded by Captain Butler, Colonel Axtell, the famous regicide who was governor of Kilkenny, dispatched a party to reduce it, but they returned without accomplishing their orders; upon which Axtell himself marched out with two cannon and summoned the castle to surrender on pain of military execution. Without any hope of relief it is no wonder the garrison submitted\".\n\nOn 25 October 1650 Axtell led the Parliamentarian army to victory at the battle of Meelick Island (a Crannog on the Shannon, on which the Connaught Irish army was camped) after launching a sudden attack on the Irish army under cover of darkness. After fierce hand-to-hand fighting the Parliamentarians were victorious, killing several hundred of the Irish soldiers and capturing their weapons and equipment. After the conflict, however, it was alleged that many of the Irish had been killed after the promise of quarter. Axtell was court-martialled for this by Henry Ireton and sent back to England. It is possible that Axtell was a scapegoat; Cromwell had committed similar atrocities a year earlier at Drogheda and at Wexford, in the sense that no quarter had been offered. It is possible that the leaders of the Parliamentarian forces in Ireland (if not the Parliamentarian leadership in Britain) felt that the 'shock' tactics initially adopted in Ireland were counter-productive. For example, Ireton's request for lenient surrender terms to be made known by Parliament were refused. Axtell's actions may have run counter to a less ruthless strategy putatively adopted by Ireton in the field.\n\nAfter the fall of the Protectorate in May 1659, Axtell returned briefly to Ireland as a colonel under the command of Edmund Ludlow but was sent back to England to support John Lambert against Booth's Uprising in August 1659. Axtell was among the veterans of the Good Old Cause who attempted to oppose the Restoration in April 1660. He escaped from the fight at Daventry during which Lambert was captured by Colonel Richard Ingoldsby, but was himself arrested shortly afterwards.\n\nHe was arraigned for treason for his actions during the King's trial. His defence at his trial as a regicide, that he was only obeying orders at the trial of the King, was refuted by several witnesses who testified that Axtell had behaved discourteously towards the King, encouraging his men to jeer at or shout down the King when he tried to speak in his own defence. The court held: \"[Axtell] justified all that he did was as a soldier, by the command of his superior officer, whom he must obey or die. It was... no excuse, for his superior was a traitor..., and where the command is traitorous, there the obedience to that command is also traitorous.\"\n\nOn 19 October 1660 Axtell was executed by being hanged, drawn and quartered at Tyburn and his head set up on Westminster Hall. His commanding officer Colonel Francis Hacker had also been condemned as a Regicide and had been executed. Axtell went to his execution unrepentant, declaring \"If I had a thousand lives, I could lay them all down for the [Good Old] Cause\".\n\nIn 1678 Daniel Axtell, the son of the regicide, fled to Carolina after his house in Stoke Newington was searched for seditious libels. He died in 1687.\n\n\n"}

Services on both lines are usually operated by Class 323 electric multiple units, although Class 350 electric multiple units are also commonly used on services to and from Walsall as well as occasional stopping service by Class 170 Diesel Multiple Units.\n\nDuddeston opened in 1837 as Vauxhall, the temporary Birmingham terminus of the Grand Junction Railway from Warrington. When the permanent terminus at Curzon Street opened in 1839, Vauxhall became a goods-only station until it was rebuilt and re-opened in 1869 under the LNWR. It was renamed Vauxhall and Duddeston in 1889. In 1941 it was hit by a bomb during a night raid and was destroyed. It was rebuilt in a temporary fashion, and in the mid-1950s it caught fire and was subsequently rebuilt.\n\nThe line through the station, to Walsall via Perry Barr, was as part of the London Midland Region's electrification programme. The actual energization of the line from Coventry to Walsall through Perry Barr took place on 15 August 1966.\n\nThe station was renamed Duddeston on 6 May 1974.\n\nThe entrance and ticket hall are over the tracks, on the Duddeston Mill Road bridge.

{"id": "1820227", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1820227", "title": "Proper Condom Use", "text": "Proper Condom Use\n\n\"Proper Condom Use\" is the seventh episode of the fifth season of the animated television series \"South Park\", and the 72nd episode of the series overall. \"Proper Condom Use\" originally aired in the United States on August 1, 2001 on Comedy Central.\n\nIn the episode, the teachers at South Park Elementary begin teaching kids sexual education classes. However, the teachers do it in an improper way, leading the boys to wage war against the girls.\n\nCartman and Kenny learn from the 5th graders that \"milking\" a dog is possible, when it is in fact just stimulating a dog to the point of ejaculation. They show the act to Stan and Kyle, who are impressed. Stan performs the technique on his own dog Sparky in front of his parents and their friends during a book club meeting, for which he is grounded for ten months. Stan cannot understand why he is being punished, as his parents are too embarrassed to explain sexual stimulation to him, and decide that the school should be responsible for teaching sex education.\n\nMr. Mackey tries to teach the fourth grade boys about a male anatomy and female anatomy and the mechanics of sexual intercourse. Not having had sex since he was 19, Mr. Mackey cannot teach the boys anything of use. Ms. Choksondik, intending to scare the girls into safe sex, spends her lesson teaching the girls about all the different types of STDs that they might catch if the boys are not wearing condoms, but does not mention that in order to catch these diseases, they would first need to have sex. The boys try talking to Chef, the only person who actually has had much sexual experience, but he (who was opposed to the sex ed class and wanted the children to keep their naivety) does not tell them anything. The girls become so terrified of the boys that upon being approached by them at lunch, they back away and scream in fright when they learn the boys aren't wearing condoms. Afraid they will spread a disease, the boys go to the pharmacy to purchase condoms.\n\nHearing from the pharmacist that condoms were purchased, the school believes this is due to the students being sexually active. As a result, Ms. Choksondik says they should start teaching kindergarten students about sex education, much to Chef's outrage. \n\nMs. Choksondik teaches the girls about pregnancy, which scares them even more than before when she shows them a detailed video of childbirth. The boys then buy the condoms and wear them at all times, not understanding how they work. Mr. Mackey tells them they are only worn during sexual intercourse. Angry that the girls misled them, and thinking that the girls are the ones carrying diseases, they come to believe that they must get rid of the girls. The girls build a massive fort to keep the boys out. The boys tell them to leave town in a siege reminiscent of \"Mad Max 2\", but the girls refuse and attack the boys (killing Kenny with a boomerang), which escalates into a battle.\n\nWhile preparing the lesson plan, Ms. Choksondik and Mr. Mackey become aroused by the sexual nature of their conversation, and admit to having sexual fantasies about each other. The two undress, and engage in unprotected sexual intercourse.\n\nMeanwhile, the battle draws the attention of the adults and the parents, who get angry at the children for the conflict. Ms. Choksondik apologizes to the girls for not telling them that an STD is transmitted through sexual intercourse. Chef, however, states that the parents are to blame since they were so quick to let the schools handle sex education rather than teach it to their kids themselves. The episode ends with Cartman stimulating another dog as everyone looks on without any objection.\n\nOver the closing credits, Garrison can be heard still teaching kindergarteners different sexual positions.\n\nIn Australia, this episode received an MA rating, due to its strong sexual content throughout, and graphic violence near the end of the episode. Because of its content, this episode also aired at 9:00 at night instead of the programme's usual 8:30 timeslot. The British satellite channel Sky One refused to air this episode for its strong sexual and violent content, even though it aired a TV trailer with scenes from the episode. The UK terrestrial channel Channel 4 and the UK cable channels Paramount Comedy 1 and MTV UK aired the episode with no edits made. Also, this episode is not aired on television syndication in the United States and has only been shown on Comedy Central.\n\nAccording to the DVD commentary, Comedy Central asked Parker and Stone to drastically shorten the part where Garrison demonstrates how to put on a condom by using his mouth with a condom around the lips and deep-throating the model penis used in the lesson. They retained the scene for when the show originally aired, but repeat episodes cut Garrison putting his lips on the dildo to the children staring in shock at what Garrison is doing off-screen. The DVD release uses the edited version.\n\nIn the episode Mr. Mackey states he has not had sex in \"about 21 years\" despite the fact that in the episode \"Ike's Wee Wee\" Mackey got briefly married and went on a honeymoon in India. Similarly, Mackey tells Choksondik that, while growing up, his head \"just sorta seemed to get bigger while the rest of [his] body stayed the same\", contradicting the explanation for Mackey's large head provided in \"Ike's Wee Wee\" in which Mackey's head shrunk back to a regular size when he removed his tie.\n\n\"Proper Condom Use\", along with the fourteen other episodes from \"South Park: the Complete Fifth Season\", was released on a three-disc DVD set in the United States on February 22, 2005. The sets included brief audio commentaries by Parker and Stone for each episode.\n\n\"Proper Condom Use\" was released on DVD in June 2002, along with the episodes \"Cripple Fight,\" \"Scott Tenorman Must Die\" and \"It Hits the Fan\", on a video titled \"Insults to Injuries\".\n\n"}

(April 2, 1844 – February 27, 1930) was an American publisher, soldier, and writer. He was the president of G. P. Putnam's Sons for its first 52 years, from 1872. \n\nThe eldest son of publisher George Palmer Putnam and Victorine Haven Putnam, he was born in London, UK where his father had been living since 1841 while establishing a branch office for his New York City publishing company, Wiley & Putnam. In 1848 the family returned to the United States, settling at Stapleton, New York, on Staten Island. Haven's early instruction was at home by his mother and nurse. He was prepared for college, first, by the Rev. Dr. Stephen H. Tyng, who had a class of boys at St. George's Church, of which Dr. Tyng was rector and his son, Stephen H. Tyng, Jr., instructor of a company of cadets. Haven next entered Starr's Military Academy, Yonkers, New York. In 1857 he attended Prof. John MacMullen's school in upper New York and the Columbia Grammar School conducted by Dr. Anthon after 1859.\n\nHe matriculated at Columbia College in 1861, but the condition of his eyes led his father to send him abroad to consult oculists in Paris and Berlin. In Berlin, Putnam placed himself under the care of Baron von Graefe, then the leading oculist of Europe. As his sight improved, he attended courses of lectures at the Sorbonne, Paris, devoted to French literature and the literature and history of Rome. At the advice of Baron von Graefe, he discontinued lectures after reaching Berlin and sought open-air environments as necessary to complete his treatment. He visited Bayard Taylor at Gotha and en route visited the galleries at Dresden, tramped through Saxony, Switzerland, studied Bohemian life at Prague, passed through the Black Forest region, saw the toymakers of Nuremberg, continued the tramp through the pleasant region of the Thüringerwald and finally reached Göttingen, where he took up his studies at the University of Göttingen. However, with the outbreak of the American Civil War he left the university without graduating to return home to serve in the Union Army.\n\nCaptured after the Battle of Cedar Creek near Middletown, Virginia, George H. Putnam was held for a short time at the notorious Libby Prison in Richmond, Virginia before being transferred to Danville where he was held until March 1865 when he was returned to the Union forces as part of a prisoner exchange. He attained the rank of major of volunteers. At the war's end, Major Putnam joined his father's publishing business, \"G. Putnam Broadway.\" He was also appointed deputy collector of internal revenue. Years later, following the 1911 marking of the 50th anniversary of the outbreak of the war, in 1912 George H. Putnam published an account of his experiences titled \"\"A Prisoner of War in Virginia - An Experience in Virginia Prisons During the Last Winter of the War\".\"\n\nOn his father's death in 1872, George H. Putnam took over the business with his brothers John Bishop and Irving, renaming it G. P. Putnam's Sons. He was made president of the firm, a position he held for the next fifty-two years. In 1884 he hired 26-year-old Theodore Roosevelt as a special partner; Roosevelt would write several works published by Putnam.\n\nLike his father, Putnam was active in numerous civic, social, and business causes. He served on the executive committees of the Civil-Service Reform Association, the Free-Trade League and the Reform Club, and was a founding member of the City Club of New York. He also aggressively continued with his father's work on copyright protection for authors. In 1887, he helped organize the American Publishers' Copyright League that led a successful campaign resulting in the 1891 passage of an international copyright protection law.\n\nHe retired in 1924, formally turning the presidency of G. P. Putnam's Sons over to Palmer C. Putnam. He died in 1930, aged 85.\n\nPutnam was first married to Rebecca Kettel Shepard who died of typhoid fever in 1895. They had five daughters: Dorothy Lesley, Ellen, Ethel Frothingham, Bertha Haven and Corinna Haven. Bertha went on to become a noted medieval historian, and Corinna became the wife of Joseph Lindon Smith, painter of Egyptian archaeological discoveries. \n\nPutnam married his second wife, the classical scholar Emily James Smith in 1899. A son of this marriage was wind power pioneer Palmer Cosslett Putnam.\n\nPutnam also wrote articles in scholarly and historical publications.\n\n\n\n"}

Moving to Vienna in 1790 he visited Wolfgang Mozart and may have taken lessons from him. His first opera, \"Der Höllenberg\", appeared there in 1795.\n\nWoelfl was very tall (over 6 feet), and with an enormous finger span (his hand could strike a thirteenth, according to his contemporary Václav Tomášek); to his wide grasp of the keyboard he owed a facility of execution which he turned to good account, especially in his \"extempore\" performances.\n\nAlthough he dedicated his 1798 sonatas op. 6 to Beethoven, the two were rivals. Beethoven however bested Woelfl in a piano 'duel' at the house of Count Wetzlar in 1799, after which Woelfl's local popularity waned. After spending the years 1801 -1805 in Paris, Woelfl moved to London, where his first concert performance was on 27 May 1805.\n\nIn England, he enjoyed commercial if not critical success. In 1808 he published his Sonata, Op. 41, which, on account of its technical difficulty, he entitled \"Non Plus Ultra\"; and, in reply to the challenge, a sonata by Dussek, originally called \"Le Retour à Paris\", was reprinted with the title \"Plus Ultra\", and an ironic dedication to \"Non Plus Ultra\". He also completed for publication an unfinished sonata of George Pinto.\n\nWoelfl died in Great Marylebone Street, London, on 21 May 1812. He is buried in St. Marylebone Churchyard.\n\nWoelfl's works have long disappeared from the concert repertory. However, in 2003 four selected piano sonatas of his (Op. 25 and Op. 33) were recorded by the pianist Jon Nakamatsu (Harmonia Mundi CD # 907324). (An Adda CD in 1988 contained his three opus 28 sonatas, played by Laure Colladant, who also recorded the sonatas opus 6 for Adès in 1993 and the three opus 33 sonatas for the label Mandala in 1995.) In 2006, German pianist Yorck Kronenberg recorded Woelfl's piano concertos 1, 5 and 6 in addition to a movement from the piano concerto 4. The piano concertos closely resemble the later piano concertos of Mozart, who had pioneered the genre; they can be distinguished from Mozart's works by the larger range of the piano, which had been extended shortly after Mozart's death.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is a member of the \"big four\" species, inflicting the most snakebites on humans in Bangladesh and India.\n\nThe average length is , but they can grow to . Males are longer, with proportionately longer tails. The head is flat and the neck hardly evident. The body is cylindrical, tapering towards the tail. The tail is short and rounded. The eyes are rather small, with rounded pupils, indistinguishable in life. The head shields are normal, with no loreals; four shields occur along the margin of the lower lip; the third and fourth supraoculars touch the eye. The scales are highly polished, in 15-17 rows; the vertebral row is distinctly enlarged and hexagonal. Ventrals number 185-225 and caudals 37-50, entire.\n\nColouration is generally black or bluish black, with about 40 thin, white crossbars which may be indistinct or absent anteriorly. The pattern, however, is complete and well defined in the young, which are marked with conspicuous crossbars even anteriorly; in old individuals, the narrow white lines may be found as a series of connected spots, with a prominent spot on the vertebral region. A white preocular spot may be present; the upper lips and the belly are white.\n\n\"Shiyar chiti\" (south 24 Parganas)\n\nThis species is found in main Peninsular India from Sindh (Pakistan), to the West Bengal plains and also in Dharmanagar, Tripura. It occurs throughout South India and Sri Lanka at elevations up to about 1600 m. It is also recorded from Afghanistan, Bangladesh, and Nepal.\n\nIts range comprises a wide variety of habitats. It is found in fields and low scrub jungle, as well as inhabited areas. It is known to take up residence in termite mounds, brick piles, rat holes, even inside houses. It is frequently found in water or in proximity to a water source.\n\nThe common krait feeds primarily on other snakes, including: \"blind worms\" (snakes of the genus \"Typhlops\"); and cannibalizes on other kraits, including the young. It also feeds on small mammals (such as rats, and mice), lizards and frogs. The young are known to eat arthropods.\nBehavioral differences during day and night time have been reported in \"B. caeruleus\". During the day, it is sluggish and generally docile. It often hides in rodent holes, loose soil, or beneath debris, so is rarely seen. It often rolls its body into a loose, coiled ball, keeping its head well concealed. When in this 'balled' condition, the snake allows considerable handling, but overhandling often instigates bites.\n\nHowever, at night, the snake is very active and escapes by hissing loudly, or keeping still, occasionally biting the source of the annoyance.\n\nWhen agitated, it will coil up with its head concealed and body flattened, and makes jerky movements. It may also lift its tail. It is reluctant to bite, but when it does, it typically holds on for a while, which enables it to inject considerable amounts of venom. It may become aggressive at night if threatened since this is its active time. Its responsible for 2nd most snake bites in India. In Bangladesh its responsible for 28% of total Krait bites.\n\nThe common krait's venom consists mostly of powerful neurotoxins, which induce muscle paralysis. Clinically, its venom contains presynaptic and postsynaptic neurotoxins, which generally affect the synaptic cleft (the points of information-transfer between neurons).\n\nIn mice, the values of its venom are 0.325 mg/kg SC, 0.169 mg/kg IV and 0.089 mg/kg IP. and the average venom yield is 10 mg (dry weight).\n\nKraits are nocturnal, so seldom encounter humans during daylight hours; incidents occur mainly at night. Frequently, little or no pain occurs from a krait bite, and this can provide false reassurance to the victim. Typically, victims complain of severe abdominal cramps, accompanied by progressive paralysis. If death occurs, it takes place about four to eight hours after the krait bite. Cause of death is general respiratory failure, i.e. suffocation.\n\nOften during the rainy season, the snakes come out of their hiding places and find refuge inside dry houses. If bitten by a krait while sleeping, a victim may not realize he has been bitten, as the bite feels like that of an ant or mosquito. The victim may die without waking up. Krait bites are significant for eliciting minimal amounts of local inflammation/swelling. This may help in species identification if the snake has not been seen.\n\nThe few symptoms of the bite include: tightening of the facial muscles in one to two hours of the bite; inability of the bite victim to see or talk, and, if left untreated, the patient may die from respiratory paralysis within four to five hours. A clinical toxicology study gives an untreated mortality rate of 70-80%. In Bangladesh, more than 50% of total snake bite deaths are caused by the common krait.\n"}

The Elephant Mountains represent the easternmost parts of the original extent of the wet evergreen forests that include Cambodia's south and the mountains east of Bangkok in Thailand.\n\nThe range is a southern offshoot of the Krâvanh or Cardamom Mountains, occupying a much smaller area. The highest elevation is Phnom Bokor at above sea level. Located close to the shores of the Gulf of Siam, the densely wooded hills receive some of the heaviest rainfall in Cambodia, averaging 150–200 inches (3,800–5,000 mm) annually on their western slopes (which are subject to southwest monsoons) but only 40–60 inches (1,020–1,520 mm) on their eastern slopes, because of the rain shadow.\n\nThe Dâmrei Mountains were, until 1975, the principal centre of Cambodia's pepper-growing industry. After the intervening years of civil war and upheavals pepper-growing has revived slowly beginning from the late 1990s.\n\nPhnom Bokor National Park occupies most of the highland plateaus and summits of the Dâmrei Mountains. The authorities are trying to curb illegal logging. The park has a great variety of plant species, including rare orchids, an endemic pitcher plant only first described in 2009, as well as some spectacular waterfalls during the rainy season.\n\nThere are several historic and cultural sites in the national park area. Bokor Hill Station (\"Station d'altitude de Bokor\") is an abandoned French settlement on top of Phnom Bokor, where elite French colonial officers spent holidays during the hot season. The place also has a church and a palace, all in a dilapidated condition. Nearby there is a Cambodian army outpost which doubles as a youth hostel. Both sites are now becoming tourist attractions, and the road to reach them, originally built in 1907 at the cost of many human lives, has recently been modernised. As of 2014, the 32 km road connecting National Route 3 to Phnom Bokor is completed. In 2012, the large luxury hotel of Thansur Bokor Highland Resort, located near the Bokor Hill Station, was completed.\n\n\n"}

It is also the seat of the Germersheim district. The neighboring towns and cities are Speyer, Landau, Philippsburg, Karlsruhe and Wörth.\n\nThe coat of arms features a golden crowned eagle on a blue background. The eagle derives from the fact that, at one time the town was ruled directly by the emperor of Germany.\n\nAfter his invasion of Gallia, Gaius Iulius Caesar made the Rhine river the border between the Roman Empire and Germania. Some small areas east of it were later invaded and added to the Roman province of Agri Decumates. As it was attacked more and more it was given up in the second half of the third century and a military camp was founded, named \"\"Vicus Iulii\"\" (\"\"Village of Julius\"/\"Julius' Village\"). It was supported up to the fourth century.\n\nThe first record of the name \"Germersheim\" is from 1090, when it was named in the \"Sinsheimer Chronik\" (\"Chronicle of Sinsheim\"). The German king Rudolph von Habsburg (\"Rudolf of Habsburg\") gave Germersheim city rights in 1276 (18 August). There is a legend which says that he, as a sick man, rode from Germersheim to Speyer to die there and not in Germersheim.\n\nIn 1325 the town was given to the Electorate of the Palatinate by King Ludwig IV. It got a higher status in the following centuries. A Catholic Order founded a monastery in 1298 which it used up to 1527.\nHaving been nearly destroyed in the times of the plague and the Thirty Years' War Germersheim was burned down by French troops in 1674. Only the crypt and the foundations of the Catholic Church survived.\n\nStill strategically important during the French Revolutionary Wars, in July 1793 Germersheim was the scene of a significant French defeat when an Austrian army under the veteran Field Marshal von Wurmser defeated a French army under Beauharnais.\n\nFrom the year 1797, Germersheim belonged to France, incorporated into the newly created Mont-Tonnerre department in 1798. It was conquered by Bavarian troops in 1814. After being retaken in 1814, Germersheim's Bavarian rulers started to build a fortress in 1831. It was completed in 1855, although excavations for underground passages continued until 1861. By this time, however, the fortress had become outdated, as artillery had improved greatly in the thirty years since work began. The fortress was destroyed in 1921/22 as a result of the Treaty of Versailles. Some parts still exist, such as the \"\"Fronte Beckers\"\", where the town's Music School is today.\n\nGermersheim was the scene of several conflicts between French troops and German veteran associations during the occupation of the Rhineland following the First World War.\n\nGeneral Hans Graf von Sponeck, who ordered the retreat of his troops from Kerch because they were going to be hopelessly cut off by the Russian landings at Theodosia on the Crimean peninsula, and against express instruction of his superior officer in the winter 1941, was interned here in the fortress after Hitler had commuted his death sentence to six years' detention. In the purge following the failed assassination attempt on Hitler Graf von Sponeck, although not involved, was shot. Today, a street in Germersheim is named \"Hans-Graf-von-Sponeck-Straße\" in his honour.\n\nThere are regular regional train connections to Karlsruhe and Mannheim.\n\n\n\n"}

The highest peak is Phu Khi Suk (), an inconspicuous 753 metres at the eastern end, in the Chong Bok (603 m) area, where the borders of Thailand, Laos, and Cambodia intersect. Other summits are Phu Khok Yai (693 m), Phu Chep Thong (692 m), Phu Tangok (689 m), Phalan Sun (670 m), Phanom Ai Nak (638 m), Phanom Thaban (582 m) and 374 m high Khao Banthat (เขาบรรทัด) at the western end.\n\nThe northern side of the Dângrêk Mountains is gently sloping, while the sides facing south are usually a steep escarpment that dominates the plain of northern Cambodia. The watershed along the escarpment in general terms marks the boundary between Thailand and Cambodia. There, however, are exceptions. The main road connecting the two countries in this area cuts through a pass in the Dângrêk Mountains at O Smach. A small administrative division of Thailand in Surin Province, Phanom Dong Rak District, bears the name of this mountain range.\n\nThe mountains are formed mainly of massive sandstone with slate and silt. A few characteristic basalt hills such as Dong Chan Yai (293 m) and Dong Chan Noi (290 m) are found on the northern side of the mountain chain in Ubon Ratchathani Province.\n\nThe Dângrêk Mountain range is mostly covered by dry evergreen forest, mixed dipterocarp forest, and deciduous dipterocarp forest. Tree species like \"Pterocarpus macrocarpus\", \"Shorea siamensis\" and \"Xylia xylocarpa var. kerrii\" dominate. There has been much illegal logging both on the Thai as well as on the Cambodian side, leaving large hill stretches denuded, vulnerable tree species such as \"Dalbergia cochinchinensis\" have also been affected. Forest fires are also common in the hills during the dry season.\n\nThere is not much wildlife left in the Dângrêk Mountains. Wild hog, deer, barking deer, rabbit, squirrel, gibbon and civet are some of the animals to be found in the areas where there has been no habitat loss due to human encroachment. Among the endangered species, the white-winged duck deserves mention.\n\nThe Phanom Dong Rak Wildlife Sanctuary is a protected area in the area of the range in Sisaket Province. Other protected areas are Phu Chong-Na Yoi National Park, Khao Phra Wihan National Park, Yot Dom Wildlife Sanctuary, Huai Sala Wildlife Sanctuary, Hua Tabtan Hadsamran Wildlife Sanctuary and Ta Phraya National Park on the Thai side, as well as Banteay Chhmar Protected Landscape, Preah Vihear Temple Protected Landscape and the Preah Vihear Protected Forest on the Cambodian side.\n\nThe Dângrêk Mountains were part of the ancient Khmer Empire, which spread northwards across them, culminating with the almost complete control of the Isan area in 1220 under Jayavarman VII. Among the archaeological remains in the mountain area there are stone carvings on the \"Pha Mo I-Daeng\" cliff, ancient stone-cutting quarries, as well as the \"Sa Trao\" reservoir. There are also remains of sanctuaries that were built as homes to spirits called \"phi ton nam\" ('watershed spirits') in different spots along the border area of the Dângrêk mountain chain. However, the largest and most important archaeological site in these mountains is the Prasat Preah Vihear compound, a Shaivite temple of the Khmer imperial times dated from the reign of Suryavarman I in a dramatic location on top of a high hill.\n\nIn 1975, following the fall of the Lon Nol regime on 17 April the Khmer Rouge entered the capital Phnom Penh. But the final area held by the ill-fated Khmer Republic in any form would be the Preah Vihear Temple in these mountains. Khmer National Armed Forces occupied the place in late-April that year. They held on for a few weeks until the hill where the temple stands was finally taken by the Khmer Rouge on 22 May.\n\nBetween 1975 and 1979 many Cambodians fled the violence in their country across these mountains. In one of the worst cases of enforced repatriation in UN history, the Thai military forcefully sent as many as 40,000 refugees back into Cambodia often through heavily mined areas despite their unwillingness to return. Many would die of lack of food and exposure in the mountains. To compound matters, there were also bandits hiding in the forests preying on the hapless refugees. At that time there were many corpses, lying rotting unburied, strewn about the Dângrêk Mountains.\n\nIn the 1984 movie \"The Killing Fields\", the Dângrêk Mountains are the final escarpment that Pran, portrayed by actor Haing S. Ngor, climbs in order to reach the safety of the refugee camp across the border in Thailand. The contrast between the steep-faced Cambodian side and the smooth northern slope of the cordillera is well displayed in this movie.\nEven though some areas have been cleared, vast numbers of landmines were laid by the People's Republic of Kampuchea government in the 1980s as part of a huge planned operation using thousands of conscripted workers along the Dângrêk mountain range and other parts of the Thai-Cambodian border. The alleged purpose was to hinder Pol Pot's regrouped Khmer Rouge from entering Cambodia from Thailand. This defensive line, part of the legacy of the violent conflicts that engulfed Cambodia in the latter part of the 20th century, is known as the K-5 Belt.\n\nAfter the end of the Vietnamese occupation of Cambodia in 1989 and the withdrawal of the Vietnam People's Army, the Khmer Rouge rebuilt their former bases in the Dângrêk mountain range area, along the border of Cambodia in order to fight against the Kampuchean People's Revolutionary Armed Forces, the armed forces of the State of Cambodia. Anlong Veng, a small town at the foot of these hills, became for a while the main \"capital\" of the Khmer Rouge. In the 1990s the Khmer Rouge still controlled Anlong Veng, where there was one of the first \"killing fields\" after the fall of \"Democratic Kampuchea\".\n\nThere is still an unexcavated site in a forest with landmines in the Dângrêk Mountains, about 6 km north of Anlong Veng where 3,000 people were allegedly killed by the Khmer Rouge for having become \"corrupted\" as late as between 1993 and 1997. These executions were carried out during Ta Mok's leadership in the area.\n\nIllegal logging of \"phayung\" ('Siamese rosewood') is rampant in the Dângrêk Mountains. Although officially a protected tree, the logs cut on the Cambodian side are usually smuggled into Thailand by the hundreds. In Thailand and China this wood is highly valued in the furniture industry.\n\nIn 1959, the Thai military seized the ancient Khmer Preah Vihear Temple from Cambodia. In 1962 Cambodia gained worldwide recognition for sovereignty from the International Court. Recently the issue of Cambodian sovereignty in the Cambodian–Thai border dispute has been used by certain nationalist factions in Thailand as a tool to help discredit the current Thai government as part of the continuing power struggle within Thailand.\n\nIn mid-2011 three districts of Surin Province in the Dângrêk Range were declared \"disaster zones\" following border clashes between the Thai and the Cambodian military. The area declared a disaster zone included a total of 142 villages. Following this official declaration about 6,000 civilians were evacuated from the villages of the area.\n\n\n"}

It is the second largest river in Central America and the longest river of Honduras, measuring almost long and draining .\n\nThe river originates in the central mountains at the confluence of the Guayape and Guayambre rivers. It flows northeasterly, meandering and twisting along its way to the lowlands of the Mosquito Coast before joining the Caribbean Sea at Patuca Point.\n\nThe Patuca is infamous within Honduras for a section of rapids known as \"El Portal del Infierno\" or \"The Gates of Hell\" which are known to have killed many reckless river-goers.\n\nAt floodstage the Patuca can reach several miles in width. Its main tributary, the Guayape is known to exceed in width nearly every year in areas that can be waded waist-deep in the dry season.\n\nThe Patuca is also well known for its lawless nether regions where small heavily armed groups of men dredge vast placer gold deposits in the areas up-river from the Mosquitia jungle.\n\nThe Patuca was proposed to be dammed to provide hydroelectric power. Two previous efforts were abandoned, the first in the late 1990s when Hurricane Mitch caused widespread damages and the second in 2007 when financial crisis forced Taiwan Power to withdraw. In 2011, The Honduran government approved the Chinese firm Sinohydro to build the first of the three dams.\n\nThe Patuca River was featured in the Douglas Preston book \"The Codex\".\n\n"}

The charitable branch of Daoyuan is known as the Red Swastika Society (世界红卍字会 \"Hóngwànzìhuì\").\n\nGuiyidao was founded in 1916 in the Pin County of Shandong as a \"fuji\" group. It was led by Liu Shoji (劉紹基). The following year the association moved to the provincial capital Jinan where it interacted with the Tongshanshe, another Xiantiandao sect. Adopting the organisation structure and meditation techniques of the Tongshanshe, the Guiyi Daoyuan was created in 1921.\n\nThe association formally established itself in Beijing with the support of premier Xiong Xiling (1870-1937, premier in 1913-14) and the American Christian missionary Gilbert Reid, and between 1922 and 1928 it expanded throughout China. The Daoyuan also set up a nationwide charity organisation, the Red Swastika Society (世界红卍字会 \"Hóngwànzìhuì\"), which was China's largest relief organisation during the Sino-Japanese War.\n\nThe Daoyuan had a separate organisational structure managed by and for women, which oversaw their religious activity, education and child care, both affirming traditional virtues and valorising women's public service. Western missionaries were fascinated by Daoyuan, which drew members among the Christians, given its inclusion and interpretation of Jesus' teaching.\n\nReports of Guiyidao-Red Swastika strength during the 1920s and 1930s seem to vary widely, with citations of 30,000 \"members\" in 1927 to 7–10 million \"followers\" in 1937.\n\nAfter an earthquake in Japan in 1923, a Guiyidao relief mission was sent there, leading to the creation of a Japanese branch of the sect and ties with Shinto sects given the strong resonance of their beliefs. The first president of Japanese Daoyuan was Deguchi Onisaburo (1871–1948), the cofounder of the Oomoto (大本 \"Great Source\") Shinto sect.\n\nOther members included Ueshiba Morihei (1883–1969), founder of the Aikido style of martial arts; Okada Mokichi (1882–1955), who in 1955 founded the Church of World Messianity; Nakano Yonosuke (1887–1974), founder in 1949 of the Ananai sect of Oomoto; and Goi Masahisa, founder of the White Light sect.\n\nSuppressed by the communist regime after 1949, Guiyidao has persisted as an underground religion in the People's Republic of China. Branches of the sect are present in Hong Kong, Taiwan, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, Canada, and the United States of America. Since 1950, the Hong Kong Daoyuan has served as the world headquarters of Guiyidao outside of mainland China.\n\nThe Red Swastika Society is the philanthropic branch of Guiyi Daoyuan founded in 1922 by Qian Nengxun (錢能訓), Du Bingyin (杜秉寅) and Li Jiabai (李佳白). The establishment of the federation was set up in Beijing together with the organization's president Li JianChiu (李建秋) drawing on Western examples such as the Red Cross to build charitable institutions grounded in Chinese religion. The swastika (卍 \"wàn\"; \"infinity\", \"all\") in Chinese and other cultures is a symbol of the manifestation of God or its creation. \n\nRed Swastika's mission was a broad based effort of philanthropy and moral education. It ran poorhouses and soup kitchens, as well as modern hospitals and other relief works. It had an explicit international focus, extending relief efforts to Tokyo after earthquakes and also in response to natural disasters in the Soviet Union. In addition, it had offices in Paris, London, and Tokyo and professors of Esperanto within its membership.\n\nPerhaps the best reported event of its history was its role in the Nanking Massacre. The rampage of the occupying Japanese forces through the city left thousands of bodies in the streets, and the Red Swastika stepped in to assist in burials. Records of these activities from the Red Swastika have provided important primary resources for research into the scale of the atrocity and the location of mass graves.\n\nAlthough it was suppressed during the Maoist rule in mainland China, the Red Swastika continues today as a religious organization focused on charity. It has branches in areas of the Chinese diaspora, with headquarters in Taiwan. Besides charity work, the Red Swastika runs two schools in Hong Kong (Tuen Mun and Tai Po) and one in Singapore (Red Swastika School).\n\n\n\n"}

Along with the Fugger family, the Welser family controlled large sectors of the European economy, and accumulated enormous wealth through trade and the German colonization of the Americas. The family received colonial rights of the Province of Venezuela from Charles V, who was also King of Spain, in 1528, becoming owners and rulers of the South American colony of Klein-Venedig (within modern Venezuela), but were deprived of their rule in 1546. Philippine Welser (1527–1580), famed for both her learning and her beauty, was married to Archduke Ferdinand, Emperor Ferdinand I's son.\n\nClaiming descent from the Byzantine general Belisarius, the family is known since the 13th century. By the early Age of Discovery, the Welser family had established trading posts in Antwerp, Lyon, Madrid, Nuremberg, Sevilla, Lisbon, Venice, Rome and Santo Domingo. The Welsers financed not only the Emperor, but also other European monarchs. After the Reformation, both Welser and Fugger families remained in the Roman Catholic Church.\n\nThe history of the family can be traced back to the 13th century, when its members held official positions in the city of Augsburg. Later, the family became widely known as prominent merchants. During the 15th century, when the brothers Bartholomew and Lucas Welser carried on an extensive trade with the Levant and elsewhere, they had branches in the principal trading centres of southern Germany and Italy, and also in Antwerp, London and Lisbon. In the 15th and 16th centuries, branches of the family settled at Nuremberg and in Austria.\n\nThe business was continued by Antony (died 1518), a son of Lucas Welser. He was one of the first Germans to use the sea route to the East, which had been discovered by Vasco da Gama.\n\nBartholomeus V. Welser lent the Emperor Charles V a great sum of money for which in 1528 he received as security the Province of Venezuela, developing it as Klein-Venedig (\"little Venice\") but in consequence of their rapacious acts the Welsers were deprived of their rule before the Emperor's reign was over. His son, Bartholomeus VI. Welser, explored Venezuela and was executed by local Spanish Governor Juan de Carvajal in 1546.\n\nBartholomäus's niece, Philippine (1527–80), daughter of Franz Welser, was renowned for her learning and beauty. She secretly married the Archduke Ferdinand, second son of the Emperor Ferdinand I. She was given the titles Baroness of Zinnenburg, Margravine of Burgau, Landgravine of Nellenburg and Countess of Oberhohenberg and Niederhohenberg. Their children were debarred from inheriting their father's rank as Archdukes of Austria; their son Margrave Andrew of Burgau became a cardinal and Charles, Margrave of Burgau became a noted general.\n\nAnother member of the Welser family, Markus Welser (1558–1614), was famed for his learning. He was a humanist, historian, publisher and from 1611 Bürgermeister of Augsburg.\n\nCarl Wilhelm Welser von Neunhof (1663–1711) was a mayor of Nuremberg.\n\nBartholomeus V. Welser was ennobled by the Emperor in 1532. The Augsburg main line became extinct in 1797, the Nuremberg branch in 1878. The Ulm branch, which became Imperial Barons in 1713, still exists. The Welsersche Familienstiftung, founded on 1 April 1539, still exists and has owned numerous castles in Germany. Following the extinction of the more senior lines of the family, the Ulm branch became administrators of the foundation.\n\nIn Augsburg, a museum of Welser and Fugger history is planned (Fugger und Welser Erlebnismuseum).\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1820317", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1820317", "title": "Tompouce", "text": "Tompouce\n\nA tompoes or tompouce is a pastry in the Netherlands and Belgium. It is the local variety of the mille-feuille or Napoleon, introduced by an Amsterdam pastry baker and named after Admiraal Tom Pouce, the stage name of the Frisian dwarf Jan Hannema.\n\nIn the Netherlands, the tompoes is iconic, and the market allows little variation in form, size and colour. It must be rectangular, with two layers of puff pastry. The icing is smooth and pink, or occasionally white. For many years however, the top layer has been orange on Koningsdag (King's Day), and a few days before. It may also be orange-coloured when the national football team plays in large international tournaments; this dates from about 1990. The filling is invariably sweet, yellow pastry cream. Tompouces are sometimes topped with whipped cream. Variations with different fillings or with jelly are comparatively rare and are not called tompoes. \n\nSeveral variations exist in Belgium. White glazing on top is the norm in Belgium, sometimes with a chocolate pattern similar to Mille-Feuille. The \"boekske\" (\"lit.\" 'booklet') may have a sugar finish and may be square. Belgians also prefer the spelling \"tompouce\". Due to the high and different standards Belgians set to food, the structure and flavor of Belgian pastry is recognizably different from that of its Dutch equivalents.\n\nThe cakes are usually served with tea or coffee, and in formal settings are eaten with pastry forks. But the hard biscuit-like layers, which squash the pastry cream when trying to cut a piece off, makes this difficult and messy, inspiring the humorous article \"Hoe eet je een tompoes?\" 'How do you eat a tompoes?'.\n\nAn easier, if slightly less dignified way of eating a tompouce is to take the frosted top layer off the pastry and hold it in one hand, with the bottom half in the other and then take sequential bites, one from the top and then one from the bottom. Even then, the pastry cream tends to ooze out onto the hand.\n\nThe tompouce can also be eaten by flipping it on its side, and then slicing it in the other direction into bite-size pieces.\n\n"}
{"id": "1820322", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1820322", "title": "Properzia de' Rossi", "text": "Properzia de' Rossi\n\nProperzia de' Rossi (c. 1490–1530), was an Italian Renaissance sculptor. She studied under the Bolognese artist and master engraver Marcantonio Raimondi, who is best known today for his engravings after paintings by Raphael.\n\nProperzia de' Rossi was born in Bologna daughter of a notary named Giovanni Martino Rossi da Modena. As a woman of the Renaissance, she studied painting, music, dance, poetry, and classical literature, and studied drawing under Marcantonio Raimondi. Undecided in her youth as to which outlet of self-expression she wanted to pursue, she found her direction when she tried her hand at sculpture, creating small but intricately detailed works of art on apricot, peach, and cherry stones. The subject of these small \"friezes\" was often religious, with one of the most famous being a Crucifixion in a peach pit. Although the exact date of her transition from painting to sculpture is unknown, it is evident that it happened by the 1520s when records document her entrance in the competition to decorate the high altar of the sanctuary of the Madonna del Baraccano in Bologna. Sculpting aside, de Rossi was noted for her beauty, intellect, and musical talents. Because she was not born into a family of artists, as were most of her female contemporaries, de Rossi had additional barriers to cross in order to pursue a sculpting career, especially in marble. Nonetheless, she received training at the University of Bologna, and with master engraver Marc Antonio Raimondi.\n\nAs she approached her thirties, de' Rossi began working in large scale. Her marble portrait busts from this period brought her to prominence. She won a competition to create sculpture for the west facade of San Petronio in Bologna. Records show that she was paid to create three sibyls, two angels, and a pair of bas-relief panels, including a panel depicting \"Joseph and Potiphar's Wife\" now in the Museum of San Petronio in Bologna. In the scene, Joseph attempts to escape from the wife of an Egyptian officer. The skillfully executed musculature in combination with classical dress reveal de Rossi's knowledge of antiquity. Additionally, the subject matter of Joseph fleeing from his temptress was a prominent subject matter in the early days of the Counter-Reformation, conveying the dangers of immorality associated with female nature.\nGiorgio Vasari wrote in his \"Life of Madonna Properzia de’ Rossi\" that de' Rossi was paid \"a most beggarly price for her work.\" He attributed this to the painter Amico Aspertini working to ruin her commissions and pay.\nThe quality of her later marble busts, including a bust of Count Alessandro de Pepoli, earned her the commission for the decorative program on the high altar of Santa Maria del Baraccano in Bologna in 1524. Although pitted against male competitors, de Rossi was the winner of a commission for the west façade of San Petronio, also in Bologna. Part of the commission included a marble panel depicting the Biblical story of Joseph and Potiphar's Wife, often referred to as her most celebrated piece. Here, she shows adeptness for arranging heroic figures in a broad and dynamic style characteristic of Italian Renaissance relief sculpture. Vasari praised this work but also assumed it depicted de Rossi's personal woes of unrequited love.\n\nDe' Rossi's life has been described as tumultuous, having been accused of vandalism of a private garden in 1520, and again with assault of another artist, Amico Aspertini in 1525. In addition, little is known of her life and artistic output after her San Petronio commission. There is, however, documentation of her debt owed to the hospital for victims of the plague in 1529, which not only explains her lack of artistic output but also the bankruptcy she experiences later in life.\n\nOriginally praised for her skill at carving fruit stones, she went on to sculpt portrait busts and, eventually, to beat her male rivals for church commissions. However, tormented by unrequited love for a nobleman, she apparently sickened and died penniless. While de' Rossi won important commissions in her life, she died before reaching forty, bankrupt and without close relatives or friends. The day of her death has been marked unmistakably in records due to the public spectacle that took place on the same day. She died on the same day as Charles V's coronation by Clement VII, 24 February 1530. Clement VII was told that de' Rossi was a \"noble and elevated genius\", and was informed of her death as he was on his way to meet her.\n\nDe' Rossi was one of about 40 woman artists, mostly painters, in Renaissance Italy. Female sculptors were rare, for sculpting was considered masculine due to the strength and stamina the medium required of the artists. She was one of four women included in Giorgio Vasari's \"Lives of the Artists\", collecting biographies of those he viewed as the most prominent artists of the recent centuries. However, his comments about de' Rossi make his view clear: sculpting is not an art form that women should attempt. For example, while he calls her fruit pit sculptures \"miraculous,\" he also asserts that de' Rossi's depiction of the Egyptian officer's wife was a self-portrait. He claimed that de' Rossi had an unrequited affection for Anton Galeazzo Malvasia, a young nobleman, and the bas-relief panel allowed her to illustrate Malvasia's denial of a romantic relationship. Vasari's assertion was probably founded on an apocryphal story; however, his inclusion of the incident in his biography of Properzia is probably due to a belief in the Renaissance that women were prone to be overcome and hindered by melancholia. Vasari used Properzia's \"San Petronio\" as an example of how all women, even those who are great artisans, cannot escape their \"female\" nature.\n\n"}

Other people featured on the back cover are Queen Elizabeth II, Linda and Terry Brown and Francis W. Davies.\n\nCompared to their previous album \"Hope\", it focuses more on pop songs than progressive rock. Many of these songs were hold-overs from early demos the band made pre-fame and were revived because band member John Woloschuk had spent a year writing and arranging the \"Hope\" album, leaving him artistically drained. The band's other main songwriter, Dee Long, picked up the ball with many new compositions and ultimately co-produced and engineered the record while the band's regular producer, Terry Brown, was busy working with Rush and Max Webster.\n\nThe album predominantly reflects 1960s pop music. However, it contains elements of other musical styles including disco (“Juicy Lucy”), heavy metal (“Mister Manson”), and space rock (“Silly Boys”). A reviewer for Julian Cope's Head Heritage wrote that the album seemed \"more of a Beatle-soundalike record\" than Klaatu's debut, as if the Beatles had continued in \"a parallel universe where Ringo dropped out in the early '70s and the remaining three continued to peaceably work together right through glam and metal and on up to disco (though in the Klaatu universe apparently punk never happened.)\"\n\nAll songs written by Dee Long, except where noted.\n\n"}

It first aired in the United States on the Fox network on April 7, 2002. In the episode, Homer Simpson is prescribed medicinal marijuana after getting pecked in the eyes by a murder of crows. While his family and friends worry about the drug altering his personality, Homer becomes Mr. Burns's vice president after cracking up at Burns's antiquated jokes.\n\nThe episode was directed by Michael Marcantel. The plot idea for the episode was pitched by George Meyer, who wanted to make an episode about Homer getting addicted to medicinal marijuana. Executive producer and current showrunner Al Jean found the idea \"very funny\" and gave former staff writer Jon Vitti the duty to write the episode's first draft. Fox was initially very uneasy to pass the episode for broadcast, since they were concerned that it might encourage younger viewers to smoke marijuana. Even though \"The Simpsons\"<nowiki>'</nowiki> staff slightly altered the episode by not actually showing Homer smoke his medicinal marijuana, the network was still worried that it might cause a controversy.\n\nThe use of medicinal marijuana is prominently featured throughout \"Weekend at Burnsie's\". Because the legislation of medicinal marijuana is a controversial issue, \"The Simpsons\"<nowiki>'</nowiki> staff has stated that they wanted to explore both sides of the argument, showing both the negative and positive effects of marijuana use. The episode does not come to an absolute conclusion about the issue. The episode also criticizes the use of genetically modified foods, and references \"Citizen Kane\", \"Dragnet\", \"The Birds\", and Judy Garland, among other things. It also features the American rock band Phish as themselves.\n\nDespite the network's initial concerns, \"Weekend at Burnsie's\" did not attract any controversy. In its original broadcast, the episode was seen by approximately 7.2 million viewers, finishing in 46th place in the ratings the week it aired. Following the thirteenth season's release on DVD and Blu-ray on August 24, 2010, the episode received mostly positive reviews from critics.\n\nThe episode is one of two from the series that has been restricted to post-watershed airing in the UK - a restriction that is still in place as of 2019 (the other episode being The Cartridge Family, although the restrictions on this episode have since been lifted). The episode was also rated M in Australia, making it the second time after Natural Born Kissers.\n\nAfter a bad experience with genetically modified food, Marge decides to plant her own garden. Crows arrive on the new garden, so Marge makes a scarecrow, which scares Homer. Homer destroys the scarecrow, and the crows see Homer as their leader, following him everywhere and doing his bidding. But when the crows try to carry Maggie, Homer turns on them and they attack his eyes. He is prescribed medicinal marijuana.\n\nHomer begins to enjoy smoking marijuana. However, a ban on medical marijuana is implemented (thanks to a petition circulated by Ned Flanders which Homer actually signs while in an altered state), but by this point, Homer is cured of his medical condition and promises he will not smoke marijuana again.\n\nMr. Burns asks Homer to help him with a speech for a crisis shareholders meeting. Homer gives Smithers his last joint, and while Smithers is smoking it, Burns apparently drowns in his bathtub. For the meeting, Smithers and Homer make Mr. Burns into a marionette, and the movement of the marionette inadvertently gets Mr. Burns' heart working again. The meeting is a success, and another financial crisis at the power plant is avoided.\n\n\"Weekend at Burnsie's\" was written by Jon Vitti and directed by Michael Marcantel. It was first broadcast on the Fox network in the United States on April 7, 2002. The idea for the episode was pitched by former staff writer George Meyer, who wanted to make an episode in which Homer becomes addicted to medicinal marijuana. Executive producer and current showrunner Al Jean thought that the premise sounded \"very funny\" and assigned Vitti to write the episode's first draft. Vitti wrote the script at his home and did not participate in any rewriting sessions with the other staff writers. \"[...] it's a funny bunch of people\", he said in the episode's DVD commentary. \"You definitely lose touch with what the movies you're supposed to see, what's good on TV...\" \"Weekend at Burnsie's\" is the second episode Vitti wrote in which a character forgets to vote at an election, and the second episode he wrote in which Homer takes a chemical that causes him to be promoted by Burns and run into conflict with Smithers. \"You can't do anything for the first time at this point\", Vitti quipped. Producer and former showrunner Mike Reiss has stated that he thoroughly enjoyed working on \"Weekend at Burnsie's\". \"I gotta say, this was the most fun I ever had working on an episode\", he said in the episode's DVD commentary. \"Everyone but me had stories to tell [about various things]. There would be about four hours of recollection before any rewriting happened.\"\n\nBecause the use of medicinal marijuana is prominently featured in the episode, Fox had \"incredible fears\" about it and were very hesitant to have it broadcast. They especially disapproved of a scene in which Homer smokes marijuana for the first time, since they did not want to instruct children how to smoke. The staff discussed the scene for a long time with the network until they came up with a compromise. Just before the joint touches Homer's lips, the scene cuts to a psychedelic sequence that transpires from the joint's tip. Despite their concerns, Jean opined that the network gave the staff a \"pretty good amount\" of creative freedom with the episode. \"[...] obviously, the network didn't want us glorifying casual marijuana use\", he said in an interview with the music magazine \"Relix\". \"[...] like we usually do, we look at everything from two sides and it's supposed to be a thoughtful look at a serious thing\". Despite the modification of the scene, the network and the series' staff members were still worried about how the episode would be received. \"Weeks before it aired, we were going 'This is really going to kill everything...'\", Jean said in the episode's DVD commentary.\n\nAfter being attacked by the crows, Homer is seen being treated by Dr. Hibbert at the Springfield General Hospital. While there are no visible scars on him, the character instead has a slightly curled hair. During a color screening of the scene, Homer's body looked \"a little too bloody\" and damaged, prompting the staff to change it. \"One thing I learned a long time ago is, you gotta be careful how you change [the characters'] basic model pack[s]\", Jean said in the episode's DVD commentary. He also said that he was happy that many viewers identify with the characters and don't want to see them get hurt or injured in any way. \"They don't mind if [Homer] falls down a cliff but [...] he should recover.\" While working on the episode, the series' staff debated what size to make Homer's pupils when he is under the influence of marijuana. Because a common effect of smoking marijuana is dilated pupils, the animators initially suggested widening Homer's, but settled for just dilating them slightly.\n\n\"Weekend at Burnsie's\" features the members of the American rock band Phish – Trey Anastasio, Page McConnell, Mike Gordon and Jon Fishman – as themselves. At the time of the episode's recording, Phish was in the middle of a two-year hiatus from touring and recording, but the members agreed to record dialogue together for the show. The idea to include the band in the episode was pitched during the episode's production. \"Phish plays at the rally. We thought they'd be the perfect group to use for the plot.\", Jean said. Meyer, who pitched the episode's premise, was a fan of the band, but Jean did not know much of them before they appeared in the episode; \"I've never seen one of their concerts, so I'm not the most familiar\", he said. He first became aware of the band after reading an article about them in \"Entertainment Weekly\". As they worked on the episode however, Jean became more acquainted with the band members. \"They were nice\", he said. \"Jon Fishman said to me that the band had talked from time to time about if they were to ever be on \"The Simpsons\", what it would be like. I said, 'Well, how close was it?' He said, 'Pretty close to what we expected.' (laughs) That was gratifying.\" The band performs their song \"Run Like an Antelope\" during their appearance in the episode. During their scene, Anastasio is shown playing a few bars of \"The Simpsons\" theme song on his guitar, which he often did during the band's concerts in the mid 1990s as part of a series of \"secret language\" signals they had taught their fans.\n\nAccording to Peter Shapiro of \"Relix\", some fans of Phish debated whether or not there had been any references to the band before this episode. While the band was mentioned by name in the season 12 episode \"Lisa the Tree Hugger\", there had not been any conscious attempts to reference the band before \"Weekend at Burnsie's.\" This includes a scene in the season 11 episode \"Saddlesore Galactica\", which shows Duncan the diving horse hanging from a hoist; some Phish fans argued that the scene was a \"blatant\" reference to the cover of the band's seventh studio album, \"Hoist\". \"That was a total coincidence\", Jean said. \"It reminds me of the whole \"Wizard of Oz\"/Pink Floyd (Dark Side of the Moon) hook-up. I haven't done it and I'm sure it works, but I just keep thinking that it must be a coincidence. Before there was the invention of video, I don't know how Pink Floyd would have done a whole album to a movie.\"\n\nOn May 17, 2002, Robert S. Stephens and Roger A. Roffman of \"The Seattle Times\" wrote an analysis of \"Weekend at Burnsie's\" in a guest column for the newspaper. The two argued that drugs are almost always shown as having only negative effects, even though 10 million people in the United States use marijuana for recreational purposes. \"We believe there are good reasons for a more honest dialogue about the positive and negative effects of marijuana use. A recent episode of the popular TV show \"The Simpsons\" highlighted the pros and cons of marijuana use, and Homer Simpson's experiences with marijuana provide an example of what we mean\", they wrote. For example, when under the influence of marijuana, Homer is relieved from the pain in his eye, and he also finds himself having a variety of sensory experiences and an enhanced appreciation of music and food. \"These are real effects reported by many marijuana users, and we would be hard pressed to call them anything other than benefits\", Stephens and Roffman wrote. However, Homer is also depicted spending more time with other drug users than with his family, and his friends find that his personality has changed. Eventually, Homer is shown having problems with memory and attention, losing track of the date on which a pro-marijuana rally takes place. Stephens and Roffman wrote that the side effects shown in the episode are \"Perhaps a bit exaggerated, but clearly there are costs of marijuana use similar to these that are experienced by real-life users.\"\n\nJean has stated that he \"does not know enough\" to say whether he approves of the legislation of medicinal marijuana, but none of \"The Simpsons\"<nowiki>'</nowiki> writers use the drug. \"It's one of the most sober writing staffs I've ever encountered\", staff writer Max Pross said in the episode's DVD commentary. When asked about what stance the episode holds regarding the legislation of medicinal marijuana, Jean said that series' staff wanted to explore both sides of the issue, rather than making an absolute statement. He added that the episode is rather a critique of legislations that are immediately criminalized after they are legitimized. \"The stance is that it seems ridiculous to legalize something and then criminalize it, which I have seen happen in various states\", Jean said. He continued, \"It's just weird to take away a right or to grant people a liberty and then abandon it. I would say that's the strongest statement [the episode] makes.\" The episode also criticizes the use of genetically modified foods. At the beginning of the episode, Marge announces that the family's dinner includes genetically modified vegetables, to which Lisa replies \"American corporations should stop playing god with nature.\" She then notices that her potato starts eating her carrot. Even though the episode portrays genetic modifications in a negative light, none of \"The Simpsons\"<nowiki>'</nowiki> writers were actually against the technique. After the scene was written, Reiss asked all the writers if they were against genetic modifications of food, and none of them were. \"Very often we take these stands on the show that we do not believe in at all\", Reiss explained in the DVD commentary for the episode. The scene was originally three times longer, and was conceived during a rewrite session with the staff writers.\nThe name of the episode is a reference to the 1989 comedy film \"Weekend at Bernie's\", in which two young insurance executives try to convince people that their deceased boss is alive. The last part of the episode, in which Homer and Smithers believe that they have killed Burns, is based on the film's plot. While under the influence of marijuana, Homer shaves his beard, causing blood to pour out from his face. To Homer, the blood looks like psychedelic rainbows, and the song that plays during the scene is \"Wear Your Love Like Heaven\" by Scottish singer-songwriter Donovan. When speaking at the Phish concert, Homer stands in front of a large picture of himself. The scene is a reference to the 1941 drama film \"Citizen Kane\", in which the main character Charles Foster Kane makes a political speech in front of a large picture of himself. In another scene, Homer and Smithers smoke marijuana in order to find Mr. Burns' jokes funny. While high, Smithers wears a suit similar to one worn by American actress and singer Judy Garland. While talking to Homer, Smithers forgets to take Mr. Burns out of his bathtub. Horrified, Smithers thinks that the unconscious Mr. Burns has drowned. The scene is a reference to \"The Big High\", an episode of the television crime drama \"Dragnet\" in which a married couple accidentally drown their baby while they are smoking marijuana.\n\nIn its original American broadcast on April 7, 2002, \"Weekend at Burnsie's\" received a 6.8 rating, according to Nielsen Media Research, translating to approximately 7.2 million viewers. The episode finished in 34th place in the ratings for the week of April 1-7, 2002, tying with a new episode of the comedy television series \"Malcolm in the Middle\".\n\nOn August 24, 2010, \"Weekend at Burnsie's\" was released as part of \"The Simpsons: The Complete Thirteenth Season\" DVD and Blu-ray set. Matt Groening, Al Jean, Matt Selman, Don Payne, Jon Vitti, Tom Gammill, Max Pross, Mike Reiss and David Silverman participated in the audio commentary of the episode.\n\nFollowing its home video release, \"Weekend at Burnsie's\" received mostly positive reviews from critics.\n\nJennifer Malkowski of DVD Verdict praised the episode's premise, writing that it \"brim[s] with potential\" even though it is \"fairly simple\". She also praised the episode's setpiece, which she described as \"particularly good\", even though she found it to be \"super-random\". She gave the episode an A- rating and added that it has \"lots of great gags\".\n\nWriting for WhatCulture!, Adam Rayner described \"Weekend at Burnsie's\" as \"utterly hilarious\" and \"superbly executed\". He wrote, \"Apart from being very funny, the episode also manages to make statements about Marijuana, but never becomes preachy.\" He continued that it can be compared to the series' best episodes, writing that it \"resemble[s] \"The Simpsons\" in its glory years\".\n\nCasey Broadwater of Blu-ray.com considers it to be one of the season's best episodes, and so did High-Def Digest's Aaron Peck, who described it as one of his personal favorites.\n\nJames Plath, a reviewer for DVD Town, wrote that the episode is a \"classic\".\n\nHowever, giving the episode a mixed review, Colin Jacobson of DVD Movie Guide wrote that \"Weekend at Burnsie's\" \"falls into the abyss as a distinctly ordinary episode.\" He continued, \"Like many other S13 shows, this one feels recycled, as it lacks much to make it stand out as creative or memorable.\" He summarized the episode as being \"decidedly mediocre\".\n\nNate Boss of Project-Blu disliked the episode, calling it \"terrible\", \"utterly preachy\" and \"too damn political for its own good.\" He criticized the \"Simpsons\" staff for making an episode about marijuana, as he believed that children might imitate Homer. \"Congrats, \"Simpsons\", you just pissed off those who choose to live sober, by pandering to stupid college kids and idiot high schoolers who may be your only remaining fans\", Boss wrote.\n\nSince its broadcast, \"Weekend at Burnsie's\" garnered little to no scrutiny from viewers. Vitti has never gotten any questions about the episode, except from his sister-in-law who wanted him to explain the episode for his nephews. \"[...] My sister-in-law called me up saying that I needed to talk to my nephews about how this was wrong that Homer did\", Vitti said. \"They watched it and had lots of questions for her. And she referred them all to me. So there are some people who are still bothered by it.\" The little amount of scrutiny that the episode attracted took \"The Simpsons\"<nowiki>'</nowiki> staff by surprise, as they anticipated that the episode would generate a lot of controversy. Instead, \"Blame It on Lisa\", an episode which aired the previous week, caused an uproar in Brazil because of its depiction of the country. It became one of the biggest controversies the series has ever faced. \"It just goes to show that you never know what's going to be a problem\", Jean said in the DVD commentary for \"Weekend at Burnsie's\".\n\n"}
{"id": "1820352", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1820352", "title": "South Philadelphia", "text": "South Philadelphia\n\nSouth Philadelphia, nicknamed South Philly, is the section of Philadelphia bounded by South Street to the north, the Delaware River to the east and south and the Schuylkill River to the west. A diverse working class community, South Philadelphia is known for its large Italian American population, but it also contains large Irish American and African American populations.\n\nSouth Philadelphia began as a satellite town of Philadelphia, with small townships such as Moyamensing and Southwark.\nTowards the end of the Industrial Revolution, the area saw rapid growth in population and urban development. This expansion was in part due to an influx of working class laborers and immigrants looking for factory jobs and dock work, as well as the first wave of mass immigration of refugees and impoverished immigrants from Ireland in the wake of the Great Irish Hunger. South Philadelphia's urbanized border eventually expanded to reach that of Philadelphia proper, or what is today known as Center City Philadelphia. Along with all other jurisdictions in Philadelphia County, South Philadelphia became part of the City of Philadelphia proper with passage by the Pennsylvania legislature of the city–county Act of Consolidation, 1854.\n\nThe area continued to grow, becoming a vital part of Philadelphia's large industrial base and attracting immigrants from Italy, Ireland, Poland and many Southern European and Eastern European countries during the late 19th and early to mid 20th centuries, as well as Black American migrants from the southern United States during the Great Migration of the early 20th century. The immigrants and migrants became the basis of South Philadelphia's unique and vibrant culture that developed over the next several decades. Struggling to maintain their Catholic identity in a mostly Protestant city, the Irish built a system of Irish Catholic churches and parochial schools for their children, including Catholic high schools. The later immigrant populations of Italians and Poles were also Catholic. Initially, these populations attended existing Catholic churches but built their own ethno-national churches when possible. However, the more established Irish-American ethnic community controlled the Catholic clergy and hierarchy for decades in Philadelphia and throughout the region, often excluding the more recent Italian (and, to a lesser extent, Polish) populations from participating in the church hierarchy. In addition to the influx of Catholic immigrants, many Polish Jews and other Jews from Central and Eastern Europe settled in South Philadelphia during the first half of the 20th century, especially in the diverse area now known as Queen Village where Jewish immigrants lived among Catholic Polish immigrants, Irish-Americans, and Italian immigrants. A smaller but significant Greek immigrant community also flourished around this time, leading to the establishment of Greek Orthodox parishes in South Philadelphia. Despite this dramatic growth in population, the low funding of education by the city resulted in the first public high school not being formed in South Philadelphia until 1934.\n\nAttracted to the industrial jobs, the new residents of South Philadelphia created communities that continued many of their Old World traditions. While many of the new arrivals were Catholic, neighborhood parishes reflected their ethnic and national traditions. Monsignor James F. Connelly, the pastor of the Stella Maris Catholic Church and an editor of the 1976 work \"The History of the Archdiocese of Philadelphia\", said in a 2005 \"Philadelphia Inquirer\" article that each parish church \"offer[s] the immigrants the faith they were familiar with.\" With the dramatic loss of industrial jobs during mid-20th century restructuring, there were population losses in South Philadelphia as well as other working-class parts of the city, and some neighborhood Catholic schools had to close.\n\nToday, many of South Philadelphia's communities are largely Italian Americans. Many of these communities contain both older and more recent Italian immigrants and Italian speakers and Italian saint festivals and cultural celebrations, including the South 9th Street Italian Market festival, are popular in the South Philadelphia Italian-American communities. In addition, South Philadelphia continues to be home to many ethnic Irish American communities and African American communities. Both Irish American and African American communities can be found in the neighborhoods of Grays Ferry and Southwest Center City, while the nearby neighborhood of Point Breeze is largely African American and is often considered the center of the South Philadelphia's African American communities. The neighborhood of Pennsport remains primarily a working class Irish-American neighborhood and the cultural center of Irish-American South Philadelphia. An increase in late 20th-century and early 21st-century immigration has given South Philadelphia significant populations from Asia, particularly Southeast Asia, including populations from Vietnam, Cambodia, Indonesia and Thailand. In addition, there has been an increase in recent years of immigrants from Russia, Mexico and Central American nations such as Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador. Today, many vendors that work alongside the Italian-Americans at the Italian Market are of Asian descent and Mexican or Central American descent, and Vietnamese, Thai, Mexican, and Central American restaurants are interspersed with historic Italian restaurants in the Market area. The recent revitalization of Center City Philadelphia and the subsequent gentrification of adjacent neighborhoods has also led to dramatic rises in prices of housing in the neighborhoods of historic Queen Village, Bella Vista, and some other northern parts of South Philadelphia, leading to an influx of young urban professionals in those more northern neighborhoods.\n\nMany of the community clubs that create the annual Mummers Parade every New Year's Day have traditionally been from South Philadelphia, especially those located on the largely Irish Americans S. 2nd Street (\"Two Street\") in the Pennsport neighborhood.\n\nPortions of South Philadelphia are within Philadelphia City Council Districts 1 and 2. As of 2014 Councilman Mark Squilla and Councilman Kenyatta Johnson represent the two districts.\n\nThe Philadelphia Fire Department operates nine fire stations serving South Philadelphia. Most of South Philadelphia resides in Fire Battalion 1, headquartered at 711 South Broad Street. Portions of South Philadelphia reside in Battalion 4, headquartered at North 4th Street and Arch Street, and Battalion 11, headquartered at 43rd Street and Market Street.\n\nThe Philadelphia Police Department patrols three districts located within South Philadelphia. The three patrol districts serving South Philadelphia are the 1st, 3rd and 17th districts.\n\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, South Philadelphia has an area of 9.7 sq. miles, of which none is water.\n\nIn 2010, the area's population was 168,782. Though mostly known for its large Italian population, South Philadelphia contains a diverse population of Italians, Irish, African Americans and Mexicans, as well as growing populations of Vietnamese, Chinese, Cambodian, Indonesian, Thai and Central Americans. In addition, the area contains smaller but historically significant Greek and Jewish communities.\n\nOn January 22, 2010 the \"Associated Press\" said \"South Philadelphia has been growing more diverse for decades, but the last 20 years have seen the greatest influx of Asian and Hispanic families.\" David Elesh, a Temple University urban sociologist, said that of the almost 60,000 Philadelphia residents who reported being born in China, many lived in South Philadelphia.\n\nAs of the 2010 Census, there are 168,782 people in 78,440 housing units. The population density is 16,771 people per square mile. 46.6% of the population is male, and 53.4% is female. The South Philadelphia area comprises the zip codes of 19145, 19146, 19147 and 19148. Data for the zip codes that make up South Philadelphia as of the Census 2000 Summary File:\n\n\nThe largest and oldest Italian immigrant settlements in Philadelphia are in South Philadelphia. Though rare and small in size, some early Italian immigrant settlements appeared in South Philadelphia prior to the 1890s; however, these small settlements generally consisted of a few skilled workers, merchants, and artists from Genoa and other wealthier areas of Northern Italy. In contrast, the vast majority of Italian immigrants that settled in Philadelphia came from impoverished regions of Southern Italy beginning in the 1890s, with most Italian immigration to Philadelphia occurring in the 20th century. Though Italians in Philadelphia emigrated from various Southern Italian regions, most Italians in Philadelphia emigrated from or have origins in three main areas: the previously combined regions of Abruzzo and Molise; the city of Messina in Sicily and the surrounding province; and Salerno and Avellino in Campania. To this day, dialects from those regions mixed with English are spoken in many South Philadelphia households and neighborhoods.\n\nItalians in South Philadelphia experienced widespread discrimination from the larger majority populations of Philadelphia. For example, Italian neighborhoods in South Philadelphia were heavily redlined for decades specifically due to their Italian-American demographics. However, Italian-Americans in South Philadelphia have contributed greatly to the culture of Philadelphia, establishing the Italian Market, creating both the cheesesteak and the hoagie, and introducing roast pork sandwiches, water ice, tomato pie and pizza to the cuisine of Philadelphia. Recently, some Italian-American South Philadelphians have moved to Southern New Jersey. However, the Italian-American population in Philadelphia remains the second largest in the country.\n\nIn 1852, the first Italian Catholic parish in the United States, St. Mary Magdalen de Pazzi, was founded by pre-mass immigration Italians. Donna J. Di Giacomo, author of \"Italians of Philadelphia\", wrote that this church \"was a hallmark of the neighborhood and touched many a South Philadelphia Italian's and Italian American's life in one way or another for generations.\"\n\nMuch of South Philadelphia's Irish population is located in the eastern part of the South Philadelphia, specifically Pennsport and Whitman. Pennsport, which is also locally referred to as \"Two Street\", is arguably the most well known Irish neighborhood in South Philadelphia. Pennsport is also home to many of the city's Mummers clubs, where some are known for their Irish American themes. Other Irish neighborhoods are located in the northwestern area of South Philadelphia, including Grays Ferry, Devil's Pocket and areas of Girard Estate, Southwest Center City and Schuylkill.\n\nPhiladelphia's large Irish community, however, is more prominent in other sections of the city, most notably Northeast Philadelphia.\n\nAs of 2000 the largest Mexican community in Philadelphia was in the area bounded by Front Street, 18th Street, Oregon Avenue and Washington Avenue in South Philadelphia. As of 2011 most Mexicans in South Philadelphia originate from the state of Puebla.\n\nAfrican Americans have lived in South Philadelphia since the early 19th century at the very least, though the city of Philadelphia proper was home to a significant population of freed and fugitive slaves since at least the 18th century. The majority of the current African American population in South Philadelphia, however, is descended from Southern migrants that moved into the city in high numbers during the first Great Migration in the early 20th century. South Street was originally considered the cultural and commercial center of this community, though the community became increasingly concentrated to western areas below South Street, including Point Breeze, Southwest Center City, Schuylkill and Grays Ferry. Point Breeze and South Street particularly served as Philadelphia's \"Harlem\" during the first half of the 20th century. The first police station and fire station staffed by African Americans were located on South Street. Famous South Philadelphians include opera contralto Marian Anderson and musicians Kenny Gamble and Chubby Checker. The Udunde Festival, arguably the largest street festival in Philadelphia, is an African-American celebration that is held annually in the South Street area. As of 2013, those that identified as \"Black alone\" or in combination with another ethnicity totaled 45,482 persons living in the zip codes 19145, 19146, 19147 and 19148. The African American population in South Philadelphia has historically constituted between 25% and 30% of South Philadelphia's population - 27% \"Black alone\" and in combination with another ethnicity as of a 2013 population estimate.\n\nI-95 runs north and south through South Philadelphia and, in this area, provides commuters with access to Philadelphia International Airport, I-76, the South Philadelphia Sports Complex and the Walt Whitman Bridge. The Girard Point Bridge section of I-95 crosses over the mouth of the Schuylkill River, where it merges with the Delaware River.\n\nI-76 becomes the Schuylkill Expressway at Passyunk Avenue in South Philadelphia and allows access between this section of the city and University City, Center City, 30th Street Station and the western suburbs.\n\nIn addition, PA Route 291 serves as a major artery between the area and Delaware County, crossing the Schuylkill River via the Platt Bridge (named for Medal of Honor recipient George C. Platt). Broad Street is part of PA Route 611.\n\nSEPTA's Broad Street Line subway services South Philadelphia and provides quick access to Center City and North Philadelphia. A number of SEPTA bus routes also serve South Philadelphia, ferrying commuters to and from Center City and its immediate suburbs, mostly those in Delaware County.\n\nSouth Philadelphia is served by bike lanes on many streets going in all directions. Snyder Avenue has bike lanes going East and West. Columbus Boulevard has North and South bike lanes. 22nd Street provides Northward lanes for cyclists. Some streets such as 11th Street have both Bike lanes and Sharrows or Shared lane marking.\n\nIn a 2007 \"Philadelphia Weekly\" article, the journalist Steve Volk stated that anti-drug activists said that South Philadelphia has secretive recreational drug dealing. More neighborhoods in the region are mixed-income than neighborhoods in some other regions; therefore, many drug dealers hide their activities. As in other parts of the city, drugs have contributed to crime.\n\nThe Italian-American Mafia family known as the Philadelphia crime family is active in the area, maintaining much of its operations in South Philadelphia. The African-American Black Mafia and its offshoot, the Black Mafia, have also had a presence in the Point Breeze section of South Philadelphia since the late 1960s.\n\nHistorical gangs include the Italian Philadelphia poison ring as well as the Lanzetta brothers, a gang of six Italian-American brothers who were drug traffickers and bootleggers. All six brothers were born in the Third Ward of South Philadelphia. South Philadelphia (along with Atlantic City) was a part of their territory, in which they fought with rival bootleggers William Michael \"Mickey Duffy\" Cusick and Joe Bruno during Prohibition.\n\nResidents are with the School District of Philadelphia's South District. Zoned public high schools in South Philadelphia include South Philadelphia High School, Audenried High School, and Furness High School.\n\nGirard Academic Music Program and The Philadelphia High School for the Creative and Performing Arts (CAPA), both magnet schools, are in South Philadelphia-at Broad and Carpenter Streets and 21st and Ritner Streets, respectively.\n\nThe Mastery Charter Schools system operates the Thomas School (grades 7-12) in South Philadelphia. It was formerly the district school Thomas Middle School, and shares a campus with a district elementary school, D. Newlin Fell School, at 9th Street and Oregon Avenue.\n\nSaints John Neumann and Maria Goretti Catholic High School is in South Philadelphia. It is a merger of the former Saint John Neumann High School and the Saint Maria Goretti High School. In addition, there are several Catholic elementary schools in South Philadelphia, usually tied to a local parish church. In 2010 South Philadelphia Catholic elementary schools had 2,572 students, a decline by 27% from the 2006 figure.\n\nPhiladelphia Free School, patterned on the Sudbury school model, is located at the intersection of 21st and Christian Streets.\n\nFree Library of Philadelphia operates six branches in South Philadelphia: Charles Santore, Fumo Family, Queen Memorial, South Philadelphia, Thomas F. Donatucci, Sr. and Whitman. Prior to its 1999 reopening in a new building, the Fumo Branch was known as the Ritner Children's Branch.\n\nSouth Street has long been considered the border between South Philadelphia proper and Center City. It originally ran east and west (although traffic is now routed east one-way). Many bars, nightspots, shops and restaurants are located along this neon-lit hotspot, with occasional live music venues (including the TLA) along the way.\n\nThe intersection of 9th Street and Passyunk Avenue is home to the regionally famous Geno's Steaks and Pat's King of Steaks cheesesteak shops, fierce competitors in the local deli market for decades. Also, nearby is the city's open-air Italian Market, specializing in fresh produce, meats and other foods. It is lined by specialty shops, such as butchers, bakeries and cheese/grocery stores, as well as one for kitchen goods, and new cafes and coffee houses. The area was featured in the film \"Rocky\" and its sequels. This is the heart of an annual street festival celebrating the neighborhood's food.\nAmong the largest landmarks in South Philadelphia is the South Philadelphia Sports Complex at the corner of Broad Street and Pattison Avenue. Here, the Philadelphia Phillies (professional baseball), Philadelphia Eagles (professional football), Philadelphia 76ers (professional basketball), Philadelphia Flyers (professional ice hockey), Philadelphia Soul (professional arena football), Temple Owls (college football) and the annual Wing Bowl (an event sponsored by the sports talk radio station, WIP-FM 94.1) make their home in the massive state-of-the-art sports arenas surrounding the well-known intersection: Citizens Bank Park, Lincoln Financial Field and the Wells Fargo Center.\n\nThe sports complex was once home to Veterans Stadium (The Vet) which stood from 1971 to 2004; John F. Kennedy Stadium, which stood from 1925 to 1992; and the Spectrum, which was in use from 1967 to 2009 and was demolished in 2011. The NovaCare Complex, located on Pattison Avenue just west of the stadium area, serves as the practice facility of the Philadelphia Eagles. They now play at Lincoln Financial Field.\n\nThe American Swedish Historical Museum is located in Franklin Delano Roosevelt Park. One of Philadelphia's last pre-World War I rowhouse synagogues, Congregation Shivtei Yeshuron-Ezras Israel, remains active in Pennsport.\n\nThe Philadelphia Naval Shipyard is located in this section of town along the Delaware River. For decades during the World Wars and after, the shipyard was a major employer, whose craftsmen built new ships and repaired and maintained existing ones. With the decline in the military uses, the area is being redeveloped by the Navy and city for a variety of business and industrial uses.\n\nThe Sunoco oil corporation bases its headquarters along South Philadelphia's Passyunk Avenue.\n\nA refurbished area of South Philadelphia alongside Columbus Boulevard/Delaware Avenue (near the Walt Whitman Bridge), Columbus Commons, provides big box shopping and chain restaurants.\n\nWashington Avenue, between 16th St. on the west and Front St. on the east, is home to many Asian businesses, including Vietnamese, Chinese and Korean. Among these are restaurants of all types, two large Asian supermarkets, jewelers and a wide variety of specialty shops.\n\nPassyunk Avenue, running on a diagonal from Broad Street to South Street, is a formerly thriving consumer district currently undergoing revitalization efforts. Within the past few years, several coffeeshops, restaurants and bars have opened which appeal to the younger population beginning to live in the area. In addition, a farmers' market is held on Wednesday nights at one of the squares.\n\n2300 Arena (better known as the ECW Arena) at the corner of Swanson Street and Ritner Street is a venue known for hosting boxing and professional wrestling events.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1820361", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1820361", "title": "Les Demoiselles d'Avignon", "text": "Les Demoiselles d'Avignon\n\nLes Demoiselles d'Avignon (The Young Ladies of Avignon, originally titled The Brothel of Avignon) is a large oil painting created in 1907 by the Spanish artist Pablo Picasso. The work, part of the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art, portrays five nude female prostitutes in a brothel on Carrer d'Avinyó (translated into Spanish: ), a street in Barcelona. Each figure is depicted in a disconcerting confrontational manner and none is conventionally feminine. The women appear slightly menacing and are rendered with angular and disjointed body shapes. The figure on the left exhibits facial features and dress of Egyptian or southern Asian style. The two adjacent figures are shown in the Iberian style of Picasso's native Spain, while the two on the right are shown with African mask-like features. The racial primitivism evoked in these masks, according to Picasso, moved him to \"liberate an utterly original artistic style of compelling, even savage force.\"\n\nIn this adaptation of primitivism and abandonment of perspective in favor of a flat, two-dimensional picture plane, Picasso makes a radical departure from traditional European painting. This proto-cubist work is widely considered to be seminal in the early development of both cubism and modern art.\n\n\"Les Demoiselles\" was revolutionary and controversial and led to widespread anger and disagreement, even amongst the painter's closest associates and friends. Matisse considered the work something of a bad joke yet indirectly reacted to it in his 1908 \"Bathers with a Turtle\". Georges Braque too initially disliked the painting yet perhaps more than anyone else, studied the work in great detail. And in fact, his subsequent friendship and collaboration with Picasso led to the cubist revolution. Its resemblance to Cézanne's \"The Bathers,\" Paul Gauguin's statue \"Oviri\" and El Greco's \"Opening of the Fifth Seal\" has been widely discussed by later critics.\n\nAt the time of its first exhibition in 1916, the painting was deemed immoral. The work, painted in Picasso's studio in the Bateau-Lavoir in Montmartre, Paris, was seen publicly for the first time at the Salon d'Antin in July 1916, at an exhibition organized by the poet André Salmon. It was at this exhibition that Salmon (who had previously titled the painting in 1912 \"Le bordel philosophique\") renamed the work its current, less scandalous title, \"Les Demoiselles d'Avignon\", instead of the title originally chosen by Picasso, \"Le Bordel d'Avignon\". Picasso, who always referred to it as \"mon bordel\" (\"my brothel\"), or \"Le Bordel d'Avignon\", never liked Salmon's title and would have instead preferred the bowdlerization \"Las chicas de Avignon\" (\"The Girls of Avignon\").\n\nPicasso came into his own as an important artist during the first decade of the 20th century. He arrived in Paris from Spain around the turn of the century as a young, ambitious painter out to make a name for himself. Although he eventually left most of his friends, relatives and contacts in Spain, he continued to live and paint in Spain while making regular trips back to France. For several years he alternated between living and working in Barcelona, Madrid and the Spanish countryside, and made frequent trips to Paris.\n\nBy 1904, he was fully settled in Paris and had established several studios, important relationships with both friends and colleagues. Between 1901 and 1904, Picasso began to achieve recognition for his Blue period paintings. In the main these were studies of poverty and desperation based on scenes he had seen in Spain and Paris at the turn of the century. Subjects included gaunt families, blind figures, and personal encounters; other paintings depicted his friends, but most reflected and expressed a sense of blueness and despair.\n\nHe followed his success by developing into his Rose period from 1904 to 1907, which introduced a strong element of sensuality and sexuality into his work. The Rose period depictions of acrobats, circus performers and theatrical characters are rendered in warmer, brighter colors and are far more hopeful and joyful in their depictions of the bohemian life in the Parisian avant-garde and its environs. The Rose period produced two important large masterpieces: \"Family of Saltimbanques\" (1905), which recalls the work of Gustave Courbet (1819–1877) and Édouard Manet (1832–1883); and \"Boy Leading a Horse\" (1905–06), which recalls Cézanne's \"Bather\" (1885–1887) and El Greco's \"Saint Martin and the Beggar\" (1597–1599). While he already had a considerable following by the middle of 1906, Picasso enjoyed further success with his paintings of massive oversized nude women, monumental sculptural figures that recalled the work of Paul Gauguin and showed his interest in primitive (African, Micronesian, Native American) art. He began exhibiting his work in the galleries of Berthe Weill (1865–1951) and Ambroise Vollard (1866–1939), quickly gaining a growing reputation and a following amongst the artistic communities of Montmartre and Montparnasse.\n\nPicasso became a favorite of the American art collectors Gertrude Stein and her brother Leo around 1905. The Steins' older brother Michael and his wife Sarah also became collectors of his work. Picasso painted portraits of both Gertrude Stein and her nephew Allan Stein.\n\nGertrude Stein began acquiring Picasso's drawings and paintings and exhibiting them in her informal \"Salon\" at her home in Paris. At one of her gatherings in 1905 he met Henri Matisse (1869–1954), who was to become in those days his chief rival, although in later years a close friend. The Steins introduced Picasso to Claribel Cone (1864–1929), and her sister Etta Cone (1870–1949), also American art collectors, who began to acquire Picasso and Matisse's paintings. Eventually Leo Stein moved to Italy, and Michael and Sarah Stein became important patrons of Matisse, while Gertrude Stein continued to collect Picasso.\n\nThe Salon d'Automne of 1905 brought notoriety and attention to the works of Henri Matisse and the Les Fauves group. The latter gained their name after critic Louis Vauxcelles described their work with the phrase \"Donatello chez les fauves\" (\"Donatello among the wild beasts\"), contrasting the paintings with a Renaissance-type sculpture that shared the room with them. Henri Rousseau (1844–1910), an artist that Picasso knew and admired and who was not a Fauve, had his large jungle scene \"The Hungry Lion Throws Itself on the Antelope\" also hanging near the works by Matisse and which may have had an influence on the particular sarcastic term used in the press. Vauxcelles' comment was printed on 17 October 1905 in the daily newspaper \"Gil Blas\", and passed into popular usage.\n\nAlthough the pictures were widely derided—\"A pot of paint has been flung in the face of the public\", declared the critic Camille Mauclair (1872–1945)—they also attracted some favorable attention. The painting that was singled out for the most attacks was Matisse's \"Woman with a Hat\"; the purchase of this work by Gertrude and Leo Stein had a very positive effect on Matisse, who was suffering demoralization from the bad reception of his work.\n\nMatisse's notoriety and preeminence as the leader of the new movement in modern painting continued to build throughout 1906 and 1907, and Matisse attracted a following of artists including Georges Braque (1880–1963), André Derain (1880–1954), Maurice de Vlaminck (1876–1958). Picasso's work had passed through his Blue period and his Rose period and while he had a considerable following his reputation was tame in comparison to his rival Matisse. The larger theme of Matisse's influential \"Le\" \"bonheur de vivre,\" an exploration of \"The Golden Age\", evokes the historic \"Ages of Man\" theme and the potentials of a provocative new age that the twentieth century era offered. An equally bold, similarly themed painting titled \"The Golden Age\", completed by Derain in 1905, shows the transfer of human ages in an even more direct way.\n\nTo make matters worse Matisse and Derain shocked the French public again at the March 1907 Société des Artistes Indépendants when Matisse exhibited his painting \"Blue Nude,\" completed in early 1907 and Derain contributed,\"The Bathers\", Both paintings completed in early 1907 and evoke ideas of human origins (world beginnings, evolution) an increasingly important theme in Paris at this time. The \"Blue Nude\" was one of the paintings that would later create an international sensation at the Armory Show of 1913 in New York City.\n\nBy October 1906 when Picasso began preparatory work for \"Les Demoiselles d'Avignon\", until its completion in March 1907, Picasso was vying with Matisse for the preeminent position of being the perceived new leader of Modern painting. Upon its completion the shock and the impact of the painting propelled Picasso into the center of controversy and all but knocked Matisse and Fauvism off the map, virtually ending the movement by the following year. In 1907 Picasso joined the art gallery that had recently been opened in Paris by Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler (1884–1979). Kahnweiler was a German art historian, art collector who became one of the premier French art dealers of the 20th century. He became prominent in Paris beginning in 1907 for being among the first champions of Pablo Picasso, and especially his painting \"Les Demoiselles d'Avignon\". Before 1910 Picasso was already being recognized as one of the important leaders of Modern art alongside Henri Matisse who had been the undisputed leader of Fauvism and who was more than ten years older than he was and his contemporaries the Fauvist André Derain and the former Fauvist and fellow Cubist, Georges Braque.\n\nIn his 1992 essay \"Reflections on Matisse\", the art critic Hilton Kramer wrote,\n\nAfter the impact of \"Les Demoiselles d'Avignon\", however, Matisse was never again mistaken for an avant-garde incendiary. With the bizarre painting that appalled and electrified the cognoscenti, which understood the \"Les Demoiselles\" was at once a response to Matisse's \"Le bonheur de vivre\" (1905–1906) and an assault upon the tradition from which it derived, Picasso effectively appropriated the role of avant-garde \"wild beast\"—a role that, as far as public opinion was concerned, he was never to relinquish.\n\nKramer goes on to say,\n\nWhereas Matisse had drawn upon a long tradition of European painting—from Giorgione, Poussin, and Watteau to Ingres, Cézanne, and Gauguin—to create a modern version of a pastoral paradise in \"Le bonheur de vivre\", Picasso had turned to an alien tradition of primitive art to create in \"Les Demoiselles\" a netherworld of strange gods and violent emotions. As between the mythological nymphs of \"Le bonheur de vivre\" and the grotesque effigies of \"Les Demoiselles,\" there was no question as to which was the more shocking or more intended to be shocking. Picasso had unleashed a vein of feeling that was to have immense consequences for the art and culture of the modern era while Matisse's ambition came to seem, as he said in his \"Notes of a Painter,\" more \"limited\"—limited that is, to the realm of aesthetic pleasure. There was thus opened up, in the very first decade of the century and in the work of its two greatest artists, the chasm that has continued to divide the art of the modern era down to our own time.\n\nIt has been argued that the painting was a reaction to Henri Matisse's \"Le bonheur de vivre\" and \"Blue Nude\".\n\nPicasso created hundreds of sketches and studies in preparation for the final work, painted in Paris in the summer of 1907. He long acknowledged the importance of Spanish art and Iberian sculpture as influences on the painting. The work is believed by critics to be influenced by African tribal masks and the art of Oceania, although Picasso denied the connection; many art historians remain skeptical about his denials. Picasso spent an October 1906 evening closely studying a Teke figure from Congo then owned by Matisse. It was later that night that Picasso's first studies for what would become \"Les Demoiselles d’Avignon\" were created. Several experts maintain that, at the very least, Picasso visited the Musée d'Ethnographie du Trocadéro (known later as the Musée de l'Homme) in the spring of 1907 where he saw and sought inspiration from African and other arts shortly before completing \"Les Demoiselles.\" Picasso had come to this museum originally to study plaster casts of medieval sculptures, then also considered examples of “primitive” art.\n\nIn 1907, when Picasso began to work on \"Les Demoiselles\", one of the old master painters he greatly admired was El Greco (1541–1614). At the time El Greco was largely obscure and under-appreciated. Picasso's friend Ignacio Zuloaga (1870–1945) acquired El Greco's masterpiece, the \"Opening of the Fifth Seal\", in 1897 for 1000 pesetas. While Picasso was working on \"Les Demoiselles\", he visited his friend Ignacio Zuloaga in his studio in Paris and studied El Greco's \"Opening of the Fifth Seal.\" The relation between \"Les Demoiselles d'Avignon\" and the \"Opening of the Fifth Seal\" was pinpointed in the early 1980s, when the stylistic similarities and the relationship between the motifs and visually identifying qualities of both works were analyzed.\n\nEl Greco's painting, which Picasso studied repeatedly in Zuloaga's house, inspired not only the size, format, and composition of \"Les Demoiselles d'Avignon\", but it inspired its apocalyptic power. Later, speaking of the work to Dor de la Souchère in Antibes, Picasso said: \"In any case, only the execution counts. From this point of view, it is correct to say that Cubism has a Spanish origin and that I invented Cubism. We must look for the Spanish influence in Cézanne. Things themselves necessitate it, the influence of El Greco, a Venetian painter, on him. But his structure is Cubist.\"\n\nThe relationship of the painting to other group portraits in the Western tradition, such as \"Diana and Callisto\" by Titian (1488–1576), and the same subject by Rubens (1577–1640), in the Prado, has also been discussed.\n\nBoth Paul Gauguin (1848–1903) and Paul Cézanne (1839–1906) were accorded major posthumous retrospective exhibitions at the Salon d'Automne in Paris between 1903 and 1907, and both were important influences on Picasso and instrumental to his creation of \"Les Demoiselles.\" According to the English art historian, collector and author of \"The Cubist Epoch\", Douglas Cooper, both of those artists were particularly influential to the formation of Cubism and especially important to the paintings of Picasso during 1906 and 1907. Cooper goes on to say however \"Les Demoiselles\" is often erroneously referred to as the first Cubist painting. He explains,\n\nThe \"Demoiselles\" is generally referred to as the first Cubist picture. This is an exaggeration, for although it was a major first step towards Cubism it is not yet Cubist. The disruptive, expressionist element in it is even contrary to the spirit of Cubism, which looked at the world in a detached, realistic spirit. Nevertheless, the \"Demoiselles\" is the logical picture to take as the starting point for Cubism, because it marks the birth of a new pictorial idiom, because in it Picasso violently overturned established conventions and because all that followed grew out of it.\n\nAlthough not well known to the general public prior to 1906, Cézanne's reputation was highly regarded in avant-garde circles, as evidenced by Ambroise Vollard's interest in showing and collecting his work, and by Leo Stein's interest. Picasso was familiar with much of Cézanne's work that he saw at Vollard's gallery and at the Stein's. After Cézanne died in 1906, his paintings were exhibited in Paris in a large scale museum-like retrospective in September 1907. The 1907 Cézanne retrospective at the Salon d'Automne greatly impacted the direction that the avant-garde in Paris took, lending credence to his position as one of the most influential artists of the 19th century and to the advent of Cubism. The 1907 Cézanne exhibition was enormously influential in establishing Cézanne as an important painter whose ideas were particularly resonant especially to young artists in Paris.\n\nBoth Picasso and Braque found the inspiration for their proto-Cubist works in Paul Cézanne, who said to observe and learn to see and treat nature as if it were composed of basic shapes like \"cubes, spheres, cylinders, and cones.\" Cézanne's explorations of geometric simplification and optical phenomena inspired Picasso, Braque, Metzinger, Gleizes, Robert Delaunay, Le Fauconnier, Gris and others to experiment with ever more complex multiple views of the same subject, and, eventually to the fracturing of form. Cézanne thus sparked one of the most revolutionary areas of artistic enquiry of the 20th century, one which was to affect profoundly the development of modern art.\n\nDuring the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the European cultural elite were discovering African, Oceanic and Native American art. Artists such as Paul Gauguin, Henri Matisse and Picasso were intrigued and inspired by the stark power and simplicity of styles of those cultures. Around 1906, Picasso, Matisse, Derain and other artists in Paris had acquired an interest in primitivism, Iberian sculpture, African art and tribal masks, in part because of the compelling works of Paul Gauguin that had suddenly achieved center stage in the avant-garde circles of Paris. Gauguin's powerful posthumous retrospective exhibitions at the Salon d'Automne in Paris in 1903 and an even larger one in 1906 had a stunning and powerful influence on Picasso's paintings.\n\nIn the autumn of 1906, Picasso followed his previous successes with paintings of oversized nude women, and monumental sculptural figures that recalled the work of Paul Gauguin and showed his interest in primitive art. Pablo Picasso's paintings of massive figures from 1906 were directly influenced by Gauguin's sculpture, painting and his writing as well. The savage power evoked by Gauguin's work lead directly to \"Les Demoiselles\" in 1907.\n\nAccording to Gauguin biographer David Sweetman, Pablo Picasso as early as 1902 became an aficionado of Gauguin's work when he met and befriended the expatriate Spanish sculptor and ceramist Paco Durrio, in Paris. Durrio had several of Gauguin's works on hand because he was a friend of Gauguin's and an unpaid agent of his work. Durrio tried to help his poverty-stricken friend in Tahiti by promoting his oeuvre in Paris. After they met Durrio introduced Picasso to Gauguin's stoneware, helped Picasso make some ceramic pieces and gave Picasso a first \"La Plume\" edition of \"Noa Noa: The Tahiti Journal of Paul Gauguin.\"\n\nConcerning Gauguin's impact on Picasso, art historian John Richardson wrote,\n\nThe 1906 exhibition of Gauguin's work left Picasso more than ever in this artist's thrall. Gauguin demonstrated the most disparate types of art—not to speak of elements from metaphysics, ethnology, symbolism, the Bible, classical myths, and much else besides—could be combined into a synthesis that was of its time yet timeless. An artist could also confound conventional notions of beauty, he demonstrated, by harnessing his demons to the dark gods (not necessarily Tahitian ones) and tapping a new source of divine energy. If in later years Picasso played down his debt to Gauguin, there is no doubt that between 1905 and 1907 he felt a very close kinship with this other Paul, who prided himself on Spanish genes inherited from his Peruvian grandmother. Had not Picasso signed himself 'Paul' in Gauguin's honor.\n\nBoth David Sweetman and John Richardson point to Gauguin's \"Oviri\" (literally meaning 'savage'), a gruesome phallic representation of the Tahitian goddess of life and death intended for Gauguin's grave. First exhibited in the 1906 retrospective, it was likely a direct influence on \"Les Demoiselles.\" Sweetman writes,\n\nGauguin's statue \"Oviri\", which was prominently displayed in 1906, was to stimulate Picasso's interest in both sculpture and ceramics, while the woodcuts would reinforce his interest in print-making, though it was the element of the primitive in all of them which most conditioned the direction that Picasso's art would take. This interest would culminate in the seminal \"Les Demoiselles d'Avignon\".\n\nAccording to Richardson,\n\nPicasso's interest in stoneware was further stimulated by the examples he saw at the 1906 Gauguin retrospective at the Salon d'Automne. The most disturbing of those ceramics (one that Picasso might have already seen at Vollard's) was the gruesome \"Oviri.\" Until 1987, when the Musée d'Orsay acquired this little-known work (exhibited only once since 1906) it had never been recognized as the masterpiece it is, let alone recognized for its relevance to the works leading up to the \"Demoiselles.\" Although just under 30 inches high, \"Oviri\" has an awesome presence, as befits a monument intended for Gauguin's grave. Picasso was very struck by \"Oviri.\" 50 years later he was delighted when [Douglas] Cooper and I told him that we had come upon this sculpture in a collection that also included the original plaster of his Cubist head. Has it been a revelation, like Iberian sculpture? Picasso's shrug was grudgingly affirmative. He was always loath to admit Gauguin's role in setting him on the road to primitivism.\nDuring the 19th and 20th centuries, Europe's colonization of Africa led to many economic, social, political, and even artistic encounters. From these encounters, Western visual artists became increasingly interested in the unique forms of African art, particularly masks from the Niger-Congo region. In an essay by Dennis Duerden, author of \"African Art\" (1968), \"The Invisible Present\" (1972), and a former director of the BBC World Service, the mask is defined as \"very often a complete head-dress and not just that part that conceals the face\". This form of visual art and image appealed to Western visual artists, leading to what Duerden calls the \"discovery\" of African art by Western practitioners, including Picasso.\n\nThe stylistic sources for the heads of the women and their degree of influence has been much discussed and debated, in particular the influence of African tribal masks, art of Oceania, and pre-Roman Iberian sculptures. The rounded contours of the features of the three women to the left can be related to Iberian sculpture, but not obviously the fragmented planes of the two on the right, which indeed seem influenced by African masks. Lawrence Weschler says that, in many ways, much of the moldering cultural and even scientific ferment that characterized the first decade and a half of the twentieth century and that laid the foundations for much of what we today consider modern can be traced back to ways in which Europe was already wrestling with its bad-faith, often strenuously repressed, knowledge of what it had been doing in Africa. The example of Picasso virtually launching cubism with his 1907 \"Desmoiselles d’Avignon\", in response to the sorts of African masks and other colonial booty he was encountering in Paris’s Musee de l’Homme, is obvious.\n\nPrivate collections and illustrated books featuring African art in this period were also important. While Picasso emphatically denied the influence of African masks on the painting: \"African art? Never heard of it!\" (\"L'art nègre? Connais pas!\"), this is belied by his deep interest in the African sculptures owned by Matisse and his close friend Guiliaume Apollinaire. Since none of the African masks once thought to have influenced Picasso in this painting were available in Paris at the time work was painted, he is thought now to have studied African mask forms in an illustrated volume by anthropologist Leo Frobenius. Primitivism continues in his work during, before and after the painting of \"Les Demoiselles d'Avignon,\" from spring 1906 through the spring of 1907. Influences from ancient Iberian sculpture are also important. Some Iberian reliefs from Osuna, then only recently excavated, were on display in the Louvre from 1904. Archaic Greek sculpture has also been claimed as an influence.\n\nThe influence of African sculpture became an issue in 1939, when Alfred Barr claimed that the primitivism of the \"Demoiselles\" derived from the art of Côte d'Ivoire and the French Congo. Picasso insisted that the editor of his \"catalogue raissonne\", Christian Zervos, publish a disclaimer: the \"Demoiselles\", he said, owed nothing to African art, everything to the reliefs from Osuna that he had seen in the Louvre a year or so before. Nonetheless, he is known to have seen African tribal masks while working on the painting, during a visit to the Ethnographic Museum of the Trocadero with Andre Malraux in March 1907, about which he later said \"When I went to the Trocadero, it was disgusting. The flea market, the smell. I was all alone. I wanted to get away, but I didn't leave. I stayed, I stayed. I understood that it was very important. Something was happening to me, right. The masks weren't like any other pieces of sculpture, not at all. They were magic things.\" Maurice de Vlaminck is often credited with introducing Picasso to African sculpture of Fang extraction in 1904.\n\nPicasso biographer John Richardson recounts in \"A Life of Picasso, The Cubist Rebel 1907–1916,\" art dealer Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler's recollection of his first visit to Picasso's studio in July 1907. Kahnweiler remembers seeing \"dusty stacks of canvases\" in Picasso's studio and \"African sculptures of majestic severity\". Richardson comments: \"so much for Picasso's story that he was not yet aware of Tribal art.'\" A photograph of Picasso in his studio surrounded by African sculptures c.1908, is found on page 27 of that same volume.\n\nSuzanne Preston Blier says that, like Gauguin and several other artists in this era, Picasso used illustrated books for many of his preliminary studies for this painting. In addition to the Frobenius book, his sources included a 1906 publication of a twelfth-century Medieval art manuscript on architectural sculpture by Villiard de Honnecourt and a book by Carl Heinrich Stratz of pseudo-pornography showing photos and drawings of women from around the world organized to evoke ideas of human origins and evolution. Blier suggests that this helps account for the diversity of styles Picasso employed in his image-filled sketchbooks for this painting. These books, and other sources such as cartoons, Blier writes, also offer hints as to the larger meaning of this painting.\n\nMaurice Princet, a French mathematician and actuary, played a role in the birth of Cubism as an associate of Pablo Picasso, Guillaume Apollinaire, Max Jacob, Jean Metzinger, Robert Delaunay, Juan Gris and later Marcel Duchamp. Princet became known as \"le mathématicien du cubisme\" (\"the mathematician of cubism\").\n\nPrincet is credited with introducing the work of Henri Poincaré and the concept of the \"fourth dimension\" to artists at the Bateau-Lavoir. Princet brought to the attention of Picasso, Metzinger and others, a book by Esprit Jouffret, \"Traité élémentaire de géométrie à quatre dimensions\" (\"Elementary Treatise on the Geometry of Four Dimensions\", 1903), a popularization of Poincaré's \"Science and Hypothesis\" in which Jouffret described hypercubes and other complex polyhedra in four dimensions and projected them onto the two-dimensional surface. Picasso's sketchbooks for \"Les Demoiselles d'Avignon\" illustrate Jouffret's influence on the artist's work.\n\nAlthough \"Les Demoiselles\" had an enormous and profound influence on modern art, its impact was not immediate, and the painting stayed in Picasso's studio for many years. At first, only Picasso's intimate circle of artists, dealers, collectors and friends were aware of the work. While many were shocked and some outraged, influential people such as Georges Braque and Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler were supportive. Soon after the late summer of 1907, Picasso and his long-time lover Fernande Olivier (1881–1966) had a parting of the ways. The re-painting of the two heads on the far right of \"Les Demoiselles\" fueled speculation that it was an indication of the split between Picasso and Olivier. Although they later reunited for a period, the relationship ended in 1912.\n\nA photograph of the \"Les Demoiselles\" was first published in an article by Gelett Burgess entitled \"The Wild Men of Paris, Matisse, Picasso and Les Fauves\", \"The Architectural Record\", May 1910.\n\n\"Les Demoiselles\" would not be exhibited until 1916, and not widely recognized as a revolutionary achievement until the early 1920s, when André Breton (1896–1966) published the work. The painting was reproduced again in \"Cahiers d'art\" (1927), within an article dedicated to African art.\n\nRichardson goes on to say that Henri Matisse was fighting mad upon seeing the \"Demoiselles\" at Picasso's studio. He let it be known that he regarded the painting as an attempt to ridicule the modern movement; he was outraged to find his sensational \"Blue Nude,\" not to speak of \"Bonheur de vivre,\" overtaken by Picasso's \"hideous\" whores. He vowed to get even and make Picasso beg for mercy. Just as the \"Bonheur de vivre\" had fueled Picasso's competitiveness, \"Les Demoiselles\" now fueled Matisse's.\n\nAmong Picasso's closed circle of friends and colleagues there was a mixture of opinions about \"Les Demoiselles\". Georges Braque and André Derain were both initially troubled by it although they were supportive of Picasso. According to William Rubin, two of Picasso's friends, the art critic André Salmon and the painter Ardengo Soffici (1879–1964), were enthusiastic about it while Guillaume Apollinaire (1880–1918) wasn't. Both the art dealer-collector Wilhelm Uhde (1874–1947), and art dealer Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler were more enthusiastic about the painting however.\n\nAccording to Kahnweiler \"Les Demoiselles\" was the beginning of Cubism. He writes:\n\nFrom 16 to 31 July 1916 \"Les Demoiselles\" was exhibited to the public for the first time at the Salon d'Antin, an exhibition organized by André Salmon titled \"L'Art moderne en France\". The exhibition space at 26 rue d'Antin was lent by the famous couturier and art collector Paul Poiret. The larger Salon d'Automne and Salon des Indépendants had been closed due to World War I, making this the only Cubists' exhibition in France since 1914. On 23 July 1916 a review was published in \"Le Cri de Paris\":\n\nThe Cubists are not waiting for the war to end to recommence hostilities against good sense. They are exhibiting at the Galerie Poiret naked women whose scattered parts are represented in all four corners of the canvas: here an eye, there an ear, over there a hand, a foot on top, a mouth below. M. Picasso, their leader, is possibly the least disheveled of the lot. He has painted, or rather daubed, five women who are, if the truth be told, all hacked up, and yet their limbs somehow manage to hold together. They have, moreover, piggish faces with eyes wandering negligently above their ears. An enthusiastic art-lover offered the artist 20,000 francs for this masterpiece. M. Picasso wanted more. The art-lover did not insist.\n\nPicasso referred to his only entry at the Salon d'Antin as his Brothel painting calling it \"Le Bordel d'Avignon\" but André Salmon who had originally labeled the work, \"Le Bordel Philosophique,\" retitled it \"Les Demoiselles d'Avignon\" so as to lessen its scandalous impact on the public. Picasso never liked the title, however, preferring \"las chicas de Avignon\", but Salmon's title stuck. Leo Steinberg labels his essays on the painting after its original title. According to Suzanne Preston Blier, the word \"bordel\" in the painting's title, rather than evoking a house of prostitution (\"un maison clos\") instead more accurately references in French a complex situation or mess, This painting, Blier says, explores not prostitution per se, but instead sex and motherhood more generally, along with the complexities of evolution in the colonial multi-racial world. The name Avignon, scholars argue, not only references the street where Picasso once bought his paint supplies (which had a few brothels), but also the home of Max Jacob's grandmother, whom Picasso jocularly identifies as one of the painting's diverse modern day. subjects.\n\nThe only other time the painting might have been exhibited to the public prior to a 1937 showing in New York was in 1918, in an exhibition dedicated to Picasso and Matisse at Galerie Paul Guillaume in Paris, though very little information exists about this exhibition or the presence (if at all) of \"Les Demoiselles\".\n\nAfterwards, the painting was rolled up and remained with Picasso until 1924 when, with urging and help from Breton and Louis Aragon (1897–1982), he sold it to designer Jacques Doucet (1853–1929), for 25,000 francs.\n\nPicasso drew each of the figures in \"Les Demoiselles\" differently. The woman pulling the curtain on the upper right is rendered with heavy paint. Composed of sharp geometric shapes, her head is the most strictly Cubist of all five. The curtain seems to blend partially into her body. The Cubist head of the crouching figure (lower right) underwent at least two revisions from an Iberian figure to its current state. She also seems to have been drawn from two different perspectives at once, creating a confusing, twisted figure. The woman above her is rather manly, with a dark face and square chest. The whole picture is in a two-dimensional style, with an abandoned perspective.\n\nMuch of the critical debate that has taken place over the years centers on attempting to account for this multiplicity of styles within the work. The dominant understanding for over five decades, espoused most notably by Alfred Barr, the first director of the Museum of Modern Art in New York City and organizer of major career retrospectives for the artist, has been that it can be interpreted as evidence of a transitional period in Picasso's art, an effort to connect his earlier work to Cubism, the style he would help invent and develop over the next five or six years. Suzanne Preston Blier says that the divergent styles of the painting were added intentionally to convey to each women art “style” attributes from the five geographic areas each woman represents.\n\nArt critic John Berger, in his controversial 1965 biography \"The Success and Failure of Picasso\", interprets \"Les Demoiselles d'Avignon\" as the provocation that led to Cubism:\n\nIn 1972, art critic Leo Steinberg in his essay \"The Philosophical Brothel\" posited a wholly different explanation for the wide range of stylistic attributes. Using the earlier sketches—which had been ignored by most critics—he argued that far from evidence of an artist undergoing a rapid stylistic metamorphosis, the variety of styles can be read as a deliberate attempt, a careful plan, to capture the gaze of the viewer. He notes that the five women all seem eerily disconnected, indeed wholly unaware of each other. Rather, they focus solely on the viewer, their divergent styles only furthering the intensity of their glare.\n\nThe earliest sketches feature two men inside the brothel; a sailor and a medical student (who was often depicted holding either a book or a skull, causing Barr and others to read the painting as a memento mori, a reminder of death). A trace of their presence at a table in the center remains: the jutting edge of a table near the bottom of the canvas. The viewer, Steinberg says, has come to replace the sitting men, forced to confront the gaze of prostitutes head on, invoking readings far more complex than a simple allegory or the autobiographical reading that attempts to understand the work in relation to Picasso's own history with women. A world of meanings then becomes possible, suggesting the work as a meditation on the danger of sex, the \"trauma of the gaze\" (to use a phrase of Rosalind Krauss's invention), and the threat of violence inherent in the scene and sexual relations at large.\n\nAccording to Steinberg, the reversed gaze, that is, the fact that the figures look directly at the viewer, as well as the idea of the self-possessed woman, no longer there solely for the pleasure of the male gaze, may be traced back to Manet's \"Olympia\" of 1863. William Rubin (1927–2006), the former Director of the Department of Painting and Sculpture at MoMA wrote that \"Steinberg was the first writer to come to grips with the sexual subject of the Demoiselles.\"\n\nA few years after writing \"The Philosophical Brothel\", Steinberg wrote further about the revolutionary nature of \"Les Demoiselles\":\n\nPicasso was resolved to undo the continuities of form and field which Western art had so long taken for granted. The famous stylistic rupture at right turned out to be merely a consummation. Overnight, the contrived coherences of representational art - the feigned unities of time and place, the stylistic consistencies - all were declared to be fictional. The \"Demoiselles\" confessed itself a picture conceived in duration and delivered in spasms. In this one work Picasso discovered that the demands of discontinuity could be met on multiple levels: by cleaving depicted flesh; by elision of limbs and abbreviation; by slashing the web of connecting space; by abrupt changes of vantage; and by a sudden stylistic shift at the climax. Finally, the insistent staccato of the presentation was found to intensify the picture's address and symbolic charge: the beholder, instead of observing a roomfuI of lazing whores, is targeted from all sides. So far from suppressing the subject, the mode of organization heightens its flagrant eroticism.\n\nAt the end of the first volume of his (so far) three volume Picasso biography: \"A Life Of Picasso. The Prodigy, 1881–1906,\" John Richardson comments on \"Les Demoiselles.\" Richardson says:\n\nIt is at this point, the beginning of 1907, that I propose to bring this first volume to an end. The 25-year-old Picasso is about to conjure up a quintet of Dionysiac \"Demoiselles\" on his huge new canvas. The execution of this painting would make a dramatic climax to these pages. However, it would imply that Picasso's great revolutionary work constitutes a conclusion to all that has gone before. It does not. For all that the \"Demoiselles\" is rooted in Picasso's past, not to speak of such precursors as the Iron Age Iberians, El Greco, Gauguin and Cézanne, it is essentially a beginning: the most innovative painting since Giotto. As we will see in the next volume, it established a new pictorial syntax; it enabled people to perceive things with new eyes, new minds, new awareness. \"Les Demoiselles d'Avignon\" is the first unequivocally 20th-century masterpiece, a principal detonator of the modern movement, the cornerstone of 20th-century art. For Picasso it would also be a rite of passage: what he called an exorcism.' It cleared the way for cubism. It likewise banished the artist's demons. Later, these demons would return and require further exorcism. For the next decade, however, Picasso would feel as free and creative and 'as overworked' as God.\n\nSuzanne Preston Blier addresses the history and meaning of \"Les Demoiselles d’Avignon\" in a 2019 book in a different way, one that draws on her African art expertise and an array of newly discovered sources she unearthed. Blier addresses the painting not as a simple bordello scene but as Picasso's interpretation of the diversity of women from around the world that Picasso encountered in part through photographs and sculptures seen in illustrated books. These representations, Blier argues, are central to understanding the painting's creation and help identify the demoiselles as global figures – mothers, grandmothers, lovers, and sisters, living the colonial world Picasso inhabited. She says that Picasso has reunited these diverse women together in this strange cave-like (and womb-resembling) setting as a kind of global \"time machine\" – each woman referencing a different era, place of origins, and concomitant artistic style, as part of the  broader ages of man them important to the new century, in which core themes of evolution took on an increasingly important role. The two men (a sailor and a doctor) depicted in some of the painting's earlier preparatory drawings, Blier suggests, likely represent the male authors of two of the illustrated books that Picasso employed – the anthropologist Leo Frobenius as sailor, one travels the world to. explore various ports of call and the Vienna medical doctor, Karl Heinrich Stratz who holds a human skull or book consistent with the detailed anatomical studies that he provides.\n\nBlier is able to date the painting to late March 1907 directly following the opening of the Salon des Independents where Matisse and Derain had exhibited their own bold, emotionally charged \"origins\"-themed tableaux. The large scale of the canvas, Blier says, complements the important scientific and historical theme. The reunion of the mothers of each \"race\" within this human evolutionary framework, Blier maintains, also constitutes the larger \"philosophy\" behind the painting's original \"le bordel philosophique\" title – evoking the potent \"mess\" and \"complex situation\" (\"le bordel\") that Picasso was exploring in this work. In contrast to Leo Steinberg and William Rubin who argued that Picasso had effaced the two right hand demoiselles to repaint their faces with African masks in response to a crisis stemming from larger fears of death or women, an early photograph of the painting in Picasso's studio, Blier shows, indicates that the artist had portrayed African masks on these women from the outset consistent with their identities as progenitors of these races. Blier argues that the painting was largely completed in a single night following a debate about philosophy with friends at a local Paris brasserie.\n\nJacques Doucet had seen the painting at the Salon d'Antin, yet remarkably seems to have purchased \"Les Demoiselles\" without asking Picasso to unroll it in his studio so that he could see it again. André Breton later described the transaction:\n\nI remember the day he bought the painting from Picasso, who strange as it may seem, appeared to be intimidated by Doucet and even offered no resistance when the price was set at 25,000 francs: \"Well then, it's agreed, M. Picasso.\" Doucet then said: \"You shall receive 2,000 francs per month, beginning next month, until the sum of 25,000 francs is reached.\n\nJohn Richardson quotes Breton in a letter to Doucet about \"Les Demoiselles\" writing:\n\nUltimately, it seems Doucet paid 30,000 francs rather than the agreed price. A few months after the purchase Doucet had the painting appraised at between 250,000 and 300,000 francs. Richardson speculates that Picasso, who by 1924 was on the top of the art world and didn't need to sell the painting to Doucet, did so and at that low price because Doucet promised \"Les Demoiselles\" would go to the Louvre in his will. However, after Doucet died in 1929 he did not leave the painting to the Louvre in his will, and it was sold like most of Doucet's collection through private dealers.\n\nIn November 1937 the Jacques Seligman & Co. art gallery in New York City held an exhibition titled \"20 Years in the Evolution of Picasso, 1903–1923\" that included \"Les Demoiselles.\" The Museum of Modern Art acquired the painting for $24,000. The museum raised $18,000 toward the purchase price by selling a Degas painting and the rest came from donations from the co-owners of the gallery Germain Seligman and Cesar de Hauke.\n\nThe Museum of Modern Art in New York City mounted an important Picasso exhibition on 15 November 1939 that remained on view until 7 January 1940. The exhibition entitled: \"Picasso:40 Years of His Art,\" was organized by Alfred H. Barr (1902–1981), in collaboration with the Art Institute of Chicago. The exhibition contained 344 works, including the major and then newly painted \"Guernica\" and its studies, as well as \"Les Demoiselles.\"\n\nIn July 2007, \"Newsweek\" published a two-page article about \"Les Demoiselles d'Avignon\" describing it as the \"most influential work of art of the last 100 years\". Art critic Holland Cotter argued that Picasso \"changed history with this work. He'd replaced the benign ideal of the Classical nude with a new race of sexually armed and dangerous beings.\"\n\nThe painting is prominently featured in the 2018 season of the television series \"Genius\" which focuses on Picasso's life and work.\n\nIn 2003, an examination of the painting by x-ray fluorescence spectroscopy performed by conservators at the Museum of Modern Art confirmed the presence of the following pigments: lead white, bone black, vermilion, cadmium yellow, cobalt blue, emerald green, and native earth pigments (such as brown ochre) that contain iron.\n\n\n"}

It connects Interstate 5 in Tacoma with Interstate 405 in Renton, and is long.\n\nSR 167 begins at a basketweave interchange with Interstate 5 in northeastern Tacoma, near the Tacoma Dome and Port of Tacoma. The highway runs east as a four-lane divided (only by a left-turn lane) highway along the Puyallup River's south bank into Puyallup. SR 167 crosses the Puyallup River. Just north of the river, SR 167 turns east onto a freeway at a partial interchange. SR 167 begins a brief concurrency with SR 161 at this interchange. The freeway continues east towards Sumner. SR 161 leaves SR 167 at an interchange with State Route 512, which goes south. SR 167 continues east and meets State Route 410 at an interchange. The highway then turns north, and has a large interchange with State Route 18 in Auburn near the Outlet Collection mall. North of Pacific, the freeway has high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes. These HOV lanes were converted to high-occupancy toll (HOT) lanes on May 3, 2008 as a pilot project.\n\nState Route 167 then continues north passing through the city of Kent before reaching Interstate 405 in Renton. An overloaded interchange with I-405 results in routine backups on I-405 as far as Tukwila to the west and the Kennydale Hill to the north. A flyover ramp completed in 2003 has improved the situation, but a more comprehensive solution is being planned as part of I-405 widening. SR 167 ends just north of Interstate 405, at State Route 900 in Renton.\n\nPortions of State Route 167 were added to Washington's state highway system as early as 1913 as part of the Pacific Highway, although most of this was then deleted in 1923. The only portion kept was that between Auburn and Renton, which became part of State Road 5. The rest of the route (between Auburn and Tacoma) was added back to the state highway system two years later in 1925, also as a part of State Road 5. This route was extended north along Rainier Avenue into Seattle in 1937.\n\nWhen Washington's current numbering system was developed with the 1964 renumbering, State Route 167 followed what is now State Route 164 from Enumclaw to Auburn before turning north towards Renton and Seattle. What is now SR 167 between Tacoma and Auburn was numbered U.S. Route 410 (later SR 410) between Tacoma and Sumner, and State Route 163 between Sumner and Auburn. These highways were renumbered to their current designations in 1973. The highway between Renton and Seattle was removed from the state highway system in 1991, although the law did not take effect until April 1, 1992.\n\nA direct connection between the freeway's HOT lanes and the I-405 HOV lanes was constructed from 2016 to 2019, costing $197 million.\n\nWSDOT plans to convert the entire route in Pierce County to a freeway. WSDOT is performing advance design and engineering work. The proposed highway would bypass the snarled traffic at Meridian Way in Puyallup and continue across Interstate 5 to SR 509 in the city of Fife. The project would construct a new six mile (10 km) freeway north of the Puyallup River and complete the partial interchange at Meridian Way (SR 161). The new freeway would be four lanes with adequate space for future HOV lanes. The interchange with I-5 would have direct access HOV ramps. The upgraded SR 167 would save time traveling from Tacoma to Puyallup, as the original highway is just a four-lane road with at-grade intersections and a speed limit of . It would also, in theory, complete the gap of a bypass to I-5 between Renton and Tacoma. SR 512 currently provides a freeway bypass of I-5 between Puyallup and Lakewood (south of Tacoma).\n"}

The statue depicts Hermann the Cheruscan, also known by the Latin name Arminius, but locals refer to the statue as Hermann The German. The only National Register of Historic Places property of its kind in Minnesota, the monument remains an impressive remembrance of Deutsch Germanic ancestry for many Minnesotans and other German Americans. Visitors to the statue can climb the spiral staircase to an observation platform at the base of the statue, which commands a view of the town and the Minnesota River Valley below.\n\nThis statue commemorates the German victory over the Romans at the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest, a symbol of German patriotism.\n\nWhile Arminius had been known about in Germany since the rediscovery of the writings of Tacitus in the 15th century, German Protestant intellectuals in the first half of the 18th century christened him \"Hermann Deutsch\" and promoted his status from that of a local tribal leader with family ties to Rome to that of a hero of Alemmani resistance to \"Roman\" (i.e. Papal) authority; the 19th century added another layer of meaning, namely Pan-German unity and resistance to Revolutionary France and her language. As depicted in this statue, Hermann's eastward gaze and upraised sword signify freedom from Rome. Perhaps not coincidentally, a statue of St. Paul atop the nearby Roman Catholic Cathedral of the Holy Trinity also gazes eastward, with his sword point-down, planted firmly in the ground.\n\nThe Hermann Monument has a total height of approximately . Constructed of sheet copper molded over iron, the statue stands on a iron column encircled by a spiral staircase to the dome, which is supported by 10 iron columns and a Kasota stone base.\n\nFollowing the completion of the similarly commemorative Hermannsdenkmal statue in Detmold, Germany, in 1875, the Germanic-American fraternal order of the Sons of Hermann, under the leadership of Julius Berndt, who headed the New Ulm chapter and was then national secretary of the order, paid for the erection of the American monument. Berndt designed the monument setting, for which the cornerstone was laid in 1888. The statue was created by Alfonz Pelzer of the W. H. Mullins Manufacturing Company in Salem, Ohio and shipped to New Ulm. It arrived in 1890 and was dedicated in 1897. Structural and cosmetic restoration projects were carried out in 1998 and again in 2004.\n\nThe Hermann Heights Monument was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. It is the third largest copper statue in the United States after the Statue of Liberty and the \"Portlandia\" in Portland, Oregon.\n\nThe 106th United States Congress (2000) designated the Hermann Monument in New Ulm to be an official symbol of all citizens of \"Germanic\" heritage.\n\nIn August 2009, a small fire at the base of the monument caused officials to question the structural integrity of the monument. As of this time, the monument remains open to the public.\n\n"}

She was the first woman to study medicine at the University of Paris, and had a long career practicing medicine, teaching, writing, and advocating for women's rights, especially in medical education. Disparaging anecdotal evidence and traditional approaches, she demanded rigorous scientific research on every question of the day. Her scientific rebuttal of the popular idea that menstruation made women unsuited to education was influential in the fight for women's educational opportunities.\n\nMary Corinna Putnam was born on August 31, 1842 in London, England. She was the daughter of American parents, George Palmer Putnam and Victorine Haven Putnam, originally from New York City. Mary was the oldest of eleven children. At the time of Mary's birth, the family was in London because her father George was establishing a branch office for his New York City publishing company, Wiley & Putnam.\n\nIn 1848, at the age of six, Mary's family moved from London back to New York, where she spent the rest of her childhood and adolescence. Mary was educated at home by her mother Victorine for most of her early years before she attended a private school in Yonkers. Later she attended a public school for girls on 12th Street in Manhattan where she graduated in 1859. After graduating, she studied Greek, science, and medicine privately with Elizabeth Blackwell and others.\n\nAs a teenager, Mary dabbled in writing, publishing short stories in \"The Atlantic Monthly\" from the age of fifteen, and later in the \"New York Evening Post\".\n\nAlthough Mary's father George Putnam believed a career in medicine was a \"repulsive pursuit,\" he reluctantly agreed to financially support Mary's decision to pursue medicine, an ambition she had held since childhood. In 1863, Jacobi graduated from the New York College of Pharmacy, which made her the first woman to graduate from a United States school of pharmacy. In 1864 she received her M.D. from the Female (later Women's) Medical College of Pennsylvania. For several months, she then practiced clinical medicine with Marie Zakrewska and Lucy Sewall at the New England Hospital for Women and Children. She also served in the Civil War as a medical aide.\n\nDuring a short internship in which she studied clinical medicine at the New England Hospital for Women and Children, Mary decided to further her study of medicine and apply to École de Médecine of the University of Paris. After much negotiation and thanks to the help of the psychiatrist Benjamin Ball, in 1868 she was admitted as the first woman student at École de Médecine, although as a woman she was required to enter lectures through a separate door and sit at the front near the professor. In July 1871 Jacobi graduated with honors and was the second woman to receive a degree from École de Médecine of the University of Paris. Jacobi also received a bronze medal for her thesis. Her studies in Paris coincided with the Franco-Prussian War. In \"Scribner's Monthly\" of August 1871, she published an account of the new French political leadership that came to power following the war.\n\nAfter five years of studying in Paris, Jacobi returned to the United States in the fall of 1871. Moving back to New York City, Jacobi established her own private medical practice. Jacobi also participated in research and became a professor in the new Women's Medical College of the New York Infirmary and Mount Sinai Hospital. Jacobi became the second woman member of the Medical Society of the County of New York, was admitted to the American Medical Association. In 1872 she helped to found the Women's Medical Association of New York City, and served as its president from 1874 to 1903. She campaigned consistently for leading medical schools, like Johns Hopkins, to admit women students. Her teaching at the Medical College tended to exceed what her students were prepared for and led her to resign in 1888. Dr. Jacobi was highly revered during her lifetime as the most accomplished woman physician.\n\nIn 1873, she married Abraham Jacobi, a New York physician and researcher, nowadays often referred to as the \"father of American pediatrics.\" They had three children, two daughters, and one son. Mary and Abraham's first daughter died at birth and their only son died at the age of seven. Abraham and Mary had only one child who survived to adulthood, their daughter Marjorie Jacobi McAneny. Jacobi educated her daughter herself according to her own educational theories.\n\nShe received Harvard University's Boylston Prize in 1876 for an original essay, \"The Question of Rest for Women during Menstruation\". Jacobi's paper was a response to Dr. Edward H. Clarke's earlier publication, \"Sex in Education; or, A Fair Chance for the Girls\" (1875), a book claiming that any physical or mental exertion during menstruation could lead to women becoming infertile. Jacobi did not believe this was the case, and to test the idea she collected extensive physiological data on women throughout their menstrual cycle, including muscle strength tests before and after menstruation. She concluded that \"there is nothing in the nature of mentruation to imply the necessity, or even desirability, of rest.\"\n\nJacobi wrote over 120 medical articles and nine books, although she stopped writing fiction in 1871. In 1891 she contributed a paper on the history of women physicians in the United States to the volume \"Women's Work in America\" that included a bibliography of writings by American female physicians mentioning over forty of her own works. In 1894, she wrote \"Common Sense Applied to Women's Suffrage\" which was later reprinted and used to support the women's suffrage movement in the United States. Also in 1894, after the defeat of the women's suffrage amendment to the New York State Constitution, Jacobi was one of six prominent suffragists who founded the League for Political Education.\n\nWhile Elizabeth Blackwell (1821–1910) viewed medicine as a means for social and moral reform, the younger Jacobi focused on curing disease. Blackwell believed that women would succeed in medicine because of their humane feminine values, but Jacobi thought women's contribution to all medical specialties should be considered equivalent to men's.\n\nWhen she was diagnosed with a brain tumor, she meticulously documented her own symptoms and published a paper on the subject titled \"Descriptions of the Early Symptoms of the Meningeal Tumor Compressing the Cerebellum. From Which the Writer Died. Written by Herself.\" She died in New York City on June 10, 1906. Jacobi is interred at Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn, New York.\n\nShe was inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame in 1993.\n\n\n\n"}

Glenn Murcutt works as a sole practitioner without staff, builds only within Australia and is known to be very selective with his projects. Being the only Australian winner of the prestigious Pritzker Prize, he is often referred to as Australia's most famous architect.\n\nMurcutt was born in London to Australian parents. He spent the first five years of his life in the Morobe Province of Papua New Guinea, where he first encountered a simple, vernacular architecture. After moving to Sydney with his parents in 1941, he was educated at Manly Boys' High School and studied architecture at the Sydney Technical College, from which he graduated in 1961. Murcutt's early work experience was with various architects, such as Neville Gruzman, Ken Woolley, Sydney Ancher and Bryce Mortlock, which exposed him to their style of organic architecture focussing on relationships to nature. By 1969, Murcutt established his own practice in the Sydney suburb of Mosman.\n\nMurcutt works as a sole practitioner, producing residential and institutional work all over Australia. Although he does not work outside the country or run a large firm, his work has a worldwide influence, especially since Murcutt teaches master classes for beginning and established architects.\n\nMurcutt's motto, 'touch the earth lightly', leads him to design his works to fit into the Australian landscape features. His works are highly economical and multi-functional. Murcutt also pays attention to aspects of the environment such as wind direction, water movement, temperature and light surrounding his sites before he designs the building itself. Materials such as glass, stone, timber, concrete and steel are often included in his works.\n\nTestament to his influence internationally was the award of the 2002 Pritzker Architecture Prize, one of the highest distinctions in architecture. In the words of the Pritzker jury: \"In an age obsessed with celebrity, the glitz of our 'starchitects', backed by large staffs and copious public relations support, dominates the headlines. As a total contrast, Murcutt works in a one-person office on the other side of the world ... yet has a waiting list of clients, so intent is he to give each project his personal best. He is an innovative architectural technician who is capable of turning his sensitivity to the environment and to locality into forthright, totally honest, non-showy works of art.\" In 2009 Murcutt won the American Institute of Architects Gold Medal.\n\nMurcutt currently lectures and teaches architectural studies as a professor at the UNSW Faculty of Built Environment.\n\nHis latest completed project is a new mosque in the Melbourne suburb of Newport. In 2016, Murcutt’s mosque project became the focus of a critically acclaimed documentary, “Glenn Murcutt: Spirit of Place”, by renowned filmmaker Catherine Hunter. The film documents the growing acceptance of Murcutt’s strikingly contemporary design, weaving into the narrative the stories of his famous domestic commissions, interviews with those involved, and an intimate biography of his life. Hunter has said about Murcutt: \"He gives everything, he can’t help himself. He’s unstoppable, he’s this force. Long before we started talking about things such as sustainability, Glenn was practicing those things.\"\n\nGlenn Murcutt is currently designing a new permanent sound installation space, the Cobar Sound Chapel in Cobar NSW, together with composer Georges Lentz. It is due to be built in 2019-2020.\n\nMurcutt's son Nicholas (1964-2011) was also a practicing architect.\n\n\nPrestigious awards include:\n\nHe is an Honorary Fellow of the American Institute of Architects (AIA), an International Fellow of the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA), an Honorary Fellow of the Royal Architectural Institute of Canada, an Honorary Fellow of the Finnish Association of Architects as well as Honorary Member of the Architects Institutes in Taiwan, Scotland and Singapore. In 2008 he was elected an Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters. In 2010, he was named a Senior Fellow of the Design Futures Council. He was founding President of the Australian Architecture Association and is Chair of the Architecture Foundation Australia (annual Murcutt International Master Class).\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1820388", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1820388", "title": "Gas duster", "text": "Gas duster\n\nGas duster, also known as canned air or compressed air, is a product used for cleaning or dusting electronic equipment and other sensitive devices that cannot be cleaned using water.\n\nThis type of product is most often packaged as a can that, when a trigger is pressed, blasts a stream of compressed gas through a nozzle at the top. Despite the names \"canned air\" or \"compressed air\", the cans do not actually contain air (i.e. do not contain O or N gases) but rather contain other gases that are compressable into liquids. True liquid air is not practical, as it cannot be stored in metal spray cans due to extreme pressure and temperature requirements. Common duster gases include 1,1-difluoroethane, 1,1,1-trifluoroethane, or 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane. Hydrocarbons, like butane, were often used in the past, but their flammable nature forced manufacturers to use fluorocarbons.\n\nWhen inhaled, gas duster fumes may produce psychoactive effects and may be harmful to health, sometimes even causing death.\n\nCanned air can be used for cleaning dust off surfaces such as keyboards, as well as sensitive electronics in which moisture is not desired. When using canned air, it is recommended to not hold the can upside down, as this can result in spraying liquid on to the surface. The liquid, when released from the can, boils at a very low temperature, rapidly cooling any surface it touches. This can cause mild to moderate frostbite on contact with skin, especially if the can is held upside down. Also, the can gets very cold during extended use; holding the can itself can result in cold burns.\n\nA dust spray can often be used as a freeze spray. Many gas dusters contain HFC-134a (tetrafluoroethane), which is widely used as a propellant and refrigerant. HFC-134a sold for those purposes is often sold at a higher price, which has led to the practice of using gas dusters as a less expensive source of HFCs for those purposes. Adapters have been built for such purposes, though in most cases, use of such adapters will void the warranty on the equipment they are used with. One example of this practice is the case of airsoft gas guns, which use HFC-134a as the compressed gas. Several vendors sell \"duster adapters\" for use with airsoft guns, though it is necessary to add a lubricant when using gas dusters to power airsoft guns.\n\nSince gas dusters are one of the many inhalants that can be easily abused, many manufacturers have added a bittering agent to deter people from inhaling the product. Because of the generic name \"canned air\", it is mistakenly believed that the can only contains normal air or contains a less harmful substance (such as nitrous oxide, for example). However, the gases actually used are denser than air, such as difluoroethane. When inhaled, the gas displaces the oxygen in the lungs and removes carbon dioxide from the blood causing the user to suffer from hypoxia which results in the euphoric feeling abusers desire. This type of inhalant abuse can cause a plethora of negative effects including brain and nerve damage, paralysis, serious injury, or death.\n\nSince gas dusters are often contained in pressure vessels, they are considered explosively volatile.\n\nGlobal warming: Difluoroethane (HFC-152a), trifluoroethane (HFC-143a), and completely non-flammable tetrafluoroethane (HFC-134a) are potent greenhouse gases. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the global warming potential (GWP) of HFC-152a, HFC-143a, and HFC-134a are 124, 4470, and 1430, respectively. GWP refers to global warming effect in comparison to CO for unit mass. 1 kg of HFC-152a is equivalent to 124 kg of CO\n\nOzone layer depletion: Gas dusters sold in many countries are ozone safe as they use \"zero ODP\" (zero ozone depletion potential) gases; tetrafluoroethane, for example, has insignificant ODP. This is a separate issue from the global warming concern.\n\nTrue \"air dusters\" using ordinary air are also available in the market. These typically have much shorter run times than a chemical duster, but are readily refillable. Both hand pump and electric compressor models have been marketed. The maximum pressure for an aerosol can is typically 10 bar (145 psi) at 20 C (68 F). Therefore, a fully compressed air duster will exhaust air about 10 times the can volume. Recently electronic versions which only use air have become viable alternatives that are preferred by many large corporations due to the fact that they contain no hazardous chemicals, are safe for the environment, do not freeze and cannot be abused. Another mechanical alternative is a camera air blower.\n\n"}

Telford United\n\nAssociation Football Club Telford United is a football club based in Telford, Shropshire, England. The club was formed in 2004 after the original Telford United, founded in 1872, folded due to financial problems. Currently members of the National League North, the sixth tier of English football, they play home matches at the New Bucks Head in Wellington, part of the new town of Telford. Their colours are white with navy blue and red trim.\n\nTelford United, then playing in the Football Conference, experienced severe financial difficulties towards the end of the 2003–04 season following the collapse of the Miras Contracts business of chairman and sole shareholder Andy Shaw. The club went into administration, and although supporters raised around £50,000 in two months, the club's debts totalled over £4 million, resulting in liquidation on 27 May 2004. On the same day, Telford United Supporters Limited announced that a new club would be formed, which was named A.F.C. Telford United; a new club motto, \"numquam obliviscere\" (\"never forget\") was also adopted. In June the new club were placed in Division One of the Northern Premier League by the Football Association. Bernard McNally was appointed as manager and a new squad assembled.\n\nThe new club's first season saw them finish third in Division One, qualifying for the promotion play-offs. After beating Eastwood Town 1–0 in the semi-final, they defeated Kendal Town 2–1 in the final to earn promotion to the Premier Division. The attendance of 4,215 for the final was a club record. The following season saw them finish tenth. During the season, McNally was replaced as manager by Rob Smith. In 2006–07 the club finished third, having missed the chance to win the league when they lost 2–1 at home to eventual champions Burscough on the final day; the attendance of 5,710 being a new club record. However, they qualified for the promotion play-offs, and a 2–0 win over Marine in the semi-final, they defeated Witton Albion 3–1 to earn promotion to the Conference North.\n\nTelford finished second in the Conference North in 2007–08, again qualifying for the playoffs, in which they lost 4–0 on aggregate to Barrow. The 2008–09 season resulted in a fourth-place finish and another play-off campaign. After beating Alfreton Town 5–4 on aggregate in the semi-finals (a 2–0 win at home and a 4–3 defeat away), they lost 1–0 to Gateshead. The season also saw them reach the first round of the FA Cup for the first time, where they were drawn at home to Football League club Southend United. Following a 2–2 draw, the club lost 2–0 in the replay. In the FA Trophy they reached the semi-finals, losing 4–2 on aggregate to York City. However, they were victorious in the Conference League Cup, beating Forest Green Rovers 3–0 on penalties after a 0–0 draw.\n\nIn 2009–10 Telford finished eleventh in the league, resulting in the sacking of Smith and his replacement with Andy Sinton. Sinton's first season saw them finish as runners-up again. In the play-offs they defeated Nuneaton Town 3–2 on aggregate in the semi-final, before beating Guiseley 3–2 in the final with an injury-time winner by Phil Trainer, earning promotion to the Conference National. They also reached the first round of the FA Cup again, losing 3–1 at home to Lincoln City.\n\nThe 2011–12 season saw Telford finish twentieth, one place above the relegation zone. Another appearance in the first round of the FA Cup resulted in a 4–0 defeat at Chelmsford City. Sinton left the club mid-way through the following season, and was replaced by Mark Cooper, who remained in charge for only six games, before resigning to take a coaching role at Swindon Town. He was replaced by Graham Hyde, who lasted just two games, resigning after a defeat to Macclesfield Town. John Psaras took over for the remainder of the season, which saw them finish bottom of the division and be relegated to the Conference North. Liam Watson was appointed as manager in May 2013.\n\nIn 2013–14 Telford won the Conference North, earning an immediate return to the Conference Premier. However, the following season Watson was sacked in December with the club bottom of the division and replaced by Steve Kittrick. They finished 23rd, resulting in relegation back to the North division. However, the season also saw them reach the second round of the FA Cup for the first time; after beating Basingstoke Town 2–1 in a first round replay, they lost 1–0 at Bristol City. In August 2015 Kittrick was sacked and Rob Smith returned for a second spell as manager. They reached the first round of the FA Cup again in 2017–18 but lost 1–0 at Hereford.\n\nAFC Telford United play their home games at the New Bucks Head. The ground was renamed following renovation in 2000, having previously been known as the Bucks Head. During the renovations Telford United played with only two terraces in operation, with a small temporary stand situated on what is now the East Terrace and portable cabins in the car park were used for changing rooms. It had previously been home to Wellington Town and Telford United.\n\nThe ground has a capacity of 6,380 of which 2,220 is seated and 4,800 covered. The club's record attendance at the ground is 5,710 against Burscough on 28 April 2007, the final day of the 2006–07 season.\n\nShropshire rivals Shrewsbury Town are traditionally seen as the club's main rival. Matches contested between the two are known as the \"Shropshire derby\". However, due to the league gap between the two clubs, most meetings between the two sides are in the Shropshire Senior Cup.\n\nDuring United's time in the National League North through the late 2010s, a rivalry developed with near neighbours Kidderminster Harriers, based in North Worcestershire. Despite the two sides meeting much more regularly than Telford and Shrewsbury, the rivalry is of less significance.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1820400", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1820400", "title": "Patriottentijd", "text": "Patriottentijd\n\nThe Patriottentijd (Dutch; ) was a period of political instability in the Dutch Republic between approximately 1780 and 1787. Its name derives from the Patriots (\"Patriotten\") faction who opposed the rule of the stadtholder, William V, Prince of Orange, and his supporters who were known as Orangists (\"Orangisten\")\n\nIn 1781 one of the leaders of the Patriots, Joan Derk van der Capellen tot den Pol anonymously published a pamphlet, entitled \"Aan het Volk van Nederland\" (\"To the People of the Netherlands\"), in which he advocated the formation of civic militias on the Swiss and American model to help restore the republican constitution. Such militias were subsequently organised in many localities and formed, together with Patriot political clubs, the core of the Patriot movement. From 1785 on, the Patriots managed to gain power in a number of Dutch cities, where they replaced the old system of co-option of \"regenten\" with a system of democratically elected representatives. This enabled them to replace the representatives of these cities in the States of several provinces, gaining Patriot majorities in the States of Holland, Groningen and Utrecht, and frequently also in the States General. This helped to emasculate the stadtholder's power as he was deprived of his command over a large part of the Dutch States Army. A low-key civil war ensued that resulted in a military stalemate, until in September–October 1787 the Patriots were defeated by a Prussian army and many were forced into exile.\n\nThe term \"Patriot\" (from Greek πατριώτης, \"fellow countryman\") had previously been used in the 17th century by anti-Orangists, but when French troops invaded the Republic in 1747, \"Patriots\" demanded the return of the Orange stadtholderate, which ended the Second Stadtholderless Period (1702–1747). From 1756 onward, however, Dutch States Party \"regenten\" once again began styling themselves \"Patriots\". The Orangist party did try to reappropriate the term, but it was forced on the defensive, which became apparent when it renamed one of its weekly magazines to \"De Ouderwetse Nederlandsche Patriot\" (\"The Old-Fashioned Dutch Patriot\"). Patriotism and anti-Orangism had become synonymous.\n\nThe Patriots can be divided into two separate groups: aristocrats and democrats. The \"aristocratic Patriots\" (also called \"oudpatriotten\" or \"Old Patriots\"), initially the strongest, can be viewed as oppositional \"regenten\", who either sought to enter the factions in power, or tried to realise the so-called \"Loevesteinian\" ideal of a republic without Orange; they came from the existing Dutch States Party. The \"democratic Patriots\" emerged later, and consisted mainly of non-regent members of the bourgeoisie, who strove to democratise the Republic.\n\nFinally, the term \"Patriottentijd\" for the historical era is a historiographical invention of 19th-century Dutch historians, comparable to the terms \"First Stadtholderless Period\", \"Second Stadtholderless Period\", and \"Fransche Tijd (French Era)\" (for the era of the Batavian Republic, the Kingdom of Holland and the French First Empire, 1795–1813). Herman Theodoor Colenbrander for instance, used the term as the title of one of his main works: \"De patriottentijd: hoofdzakelijk naar buitenlandsche bescheiden\" (The Hague, 1897). The term was often used in a pejorative fashion, but lately has acquired a more positive connotation.\n\nAfter the halcyon days of the Dutch Golden Age of the first two-thirds of the 17th century, the Dutch economy entered a period of stagnation and \"relative\" decline. The absolute size of Dutch GNP remained constant, but the economy was overtaken by that of other European countries in the course of the 18th century. Besides, in a number of economic sectors, such as the fisheries and most industries that had sprung up in the early 17th century, an \"absolute\" decline occurred. The country's deindustrialization resulted in de-urbanization as artisans that had worked in the disappearing industries had to move to areas where work was still to be found. The shrinking industrial base was also concentrating in particular areas, to the detriment of other areas where certain industries (shipbuilding, textiles) had formerly been prominent. Remarkably for an era of rapid population growth in other European countries, the size of the Dutch population remained constant during the 18th century at around 1.9 million people, which (in view of the constant absolute size of the economy) resulted in a constant \"per capita\" income. But this was somewhat misleading as economic inequality markedly increased during the 18th century: the economy became dominated by a small group of very rich \"rentiers\", and the economy shifted to what we would now call a service economy, in which the commercial sector (always strong in the Netherlands) and the banking sector dominated. These shifts had a devastating effect for the people who experienced downward social mobility and ended up in the lower strata of Dutch society. But even those that were not affected by such downward mobility, and remained in the upper and middle classes, were affected by this perceived economic decline.\n\nThe economic decline worked through in the political sphere as after the Peace of Utrecht of 1713 the government of the Dutch Republic felt constrained to enter upon a policy of austerity as a consequence of the dire state of the Dutch public finances. Both the mercenary Dutch States Army and the Dutch navy suffered a large shrinkage in the following period, and consequently the Republic had to give up the pretense of being a European great power, in the military sense, with the diplomatic consequences that entailed. It became clear that the Republic had become a pawn in European power politics, depending on the good will of other countries such as France, Prussia and Great Britain. This decline in international diplomatic standing also contributed to the malaise that resulted from the perceived decline.\n\nThe disaffection with the perceived state of the economy and diplomatic decline was paired with a growing disaffection with the political system of the Dutch Republic among middle-class Dutchmen. The Dutch \"constitution\" defined the Dutch Republic as a confederation of sovereign provinces with a republican character. Formally, power was supposed to flow upward, from the local governments (governments of select cities that possessed City Rights, and the aristocracy in rural areas) toward the provincial States, and eventually the States-General. Those local governments, however, though ostensibly representing \"The People\" according to the prevailing ideology, had in fact involved into oligarchies dominated by a few families that in the cities at least were not formally part of the nobility, but were considered \"patrician\" in the classical sense. The members of the \"regenten\" class co-opted each other in the city \"vroedschap\", which elected the city magistrates and sent delegates to the regional and national States. This situation had come about gradually, as in medieval times corporate institutions, like the guilds and \"schutterijen\" had sometimes had at least nominating powers to the \"vroedschappen\", bestowing a certain amount of political power on members of the middle class (though calling this \"democracy\" would be an exaggeration).\n\nThe concentration of power in a more and more closed oligarchy frustrated the middle class, that saw its opportunities for political and social advancement blocked, also because the political patronage in regard to all kinds of petty offices was concentrated in the hands of the oligarchs, who favored their own political allies. Though offices were often venal and for sale, this fact was ironically less resented than the fact that those offices were not available on the same footing to everyone. Opening up the political system to the middle class had therefore been an objective of political reformers like the so-called \"Doelisten\" who in 1747 helped elevate the Frisian stadtholder William IV to stadtholder in all seven provinces, on a hereditary basis, with greatly expanded powers, in the hope that he would use those powers to promote the political influence of the would-be \"democrats.\" That hope proved vain, also because of his untimely death in 1751, after which he was succeeded by his infant son William V, who was three years of age at the time. Power devolved upon regents, first the dowager Princess of Orange, and after her death in 1759, \"de facto\" Duke Louis Ernest of Brunswick-Lüneburg, who saw even less merit in \"democratic\" experiments. Duke Louis would retain a virtual guardianship in accordance with the so-called \"Acte van Consulentschap\" even after the young Prince had come of age. Meanwhile, the greatly expanded powers of the stadtholder consisted primarily in his right of appointment, or at least approval, of magistrates on the local and provincial level, which were enshrined in the so-called \"regeringsreglementen\" (Government Regulations) adopted by most provinces in 1747. These powers allowed him to overrule the elections by the local \"vroedschappen\" if the results did not comport with his wishes, and so bestowed great powers of political patronage on the local level on him (and the regents who ruled in place of the under-age William V before 1766). The end result was that the \"States party\" \"regenten\" that had ruled the country during the Second Stadtholderless Period were replaced by Orangist party men, who were ideologically opposed to popular influence, closing the door to \"democratic\" experiments. Though the \"democrats\" had been in the Orangist camp in 1747, they therefore soon came into an alliance of convenience with the disenfranchised \"States party\" \"regenten\".\n\nThe American Declaration of Independence did not elicit enthusiasm from everyone in the Dutch Republic once it became known there in August 1776. The stadtholder wrote to the \"griffier\" of the States-General, Hendrik Fagel, that it was only \"... the parody of the proclamation issued by our forefathers against king Philip II\". But others were less scornful. Dutch merchants, especially in the Amsterdam Chamber of the moribund WIC, had long chafed against the restrictions the British Navigation Acts imposed on direct trade with the American colonies in revolt. The American Revolution opened new perspectives to unfettered trade, though for the moment primarily on the smuggling route via the WIC colony of Sint Eustatius. That entrepôt soon became an important export port for the supply of the American rebels with Dutch arms. The Amsterdam \"regenten\" were particularly interested in opening formal trade negotiations with the Continental Congress; secret diplomacy was soon embarked upon by the pensionaries of a number of mercantile cities, like Engelbert François van Berckel (Amsterdam) and Cornelis de Gijselaar (Dordrecht), behind the back of the stadtholder and the States-General. The French ambassador to the Republic, Vauguyon, arranged contacts with the American ambassador to the French court, Benjamin Franklin, in 1778, which in time led to the sending out of John Adams as American emissary to the Republic. In 1778, there also were secret negotiations between the Amsterdam banker Jean de Neufville and the American agent in Aachen, William Lee. The two concluded a secret agreement on a treaty of amity and commerce between the two Republics, the draft of which was discovered by the British when they intercepted ambassador-to-the-Netherlands-to-be Henry Laurens at sea. They used this as a \"casus belli\" for declaring the Fourth Anglo-Dutch War in December 1780 (together with the actions from Dutch territory by the American privateer John Paul Jones, and the planned Dutch accession to the First League of Armed Neutrality).\n\nThe war went disastrously for the Dutch, despite the fact that the Dutch fleet had been enlarged appreciably in the preceding years. but it was scarcely used by the Dutch, with the stadtholder, as Admiral-General, in supreme command. At the start of the war, a number of Dutch warships were surprised by ships of the Royal Navy, who according to the Dutch, sneaked up under a false flag, and when they had approached the unsuspecting Dutchmen (who were not yet aware of the start of the war), ran up their true colors and opened fire. The Dutch ships then struck their colors after firing a single broadside in reply \"to satisfy honor.\" In this way individual ships, and even a complete squadron, were lost. The British blockaded the Dutch coast without much response from the Dutch fleet. There was one big battle between a Dutch squadron under rear-admiral Johan Zoutman and a British one under vice-admiral Sir Hyde Parker, which ended inconclusively, but on the whole the Dutch fleet remained in port, due to a state of \"unreadiness,\" according to the Dutch commanders. This lack of activity caused great dissatisfaction among Dutch shippers who wanted convoy protection against the British, and also among the population at large, who felt humiliated by what many saw as \"cowardice.\" The stadtholder was generally blamed. After a brief wave of euphoria due to Zoutman's heroics (which were duly exploited in the official propaganda), the navy again earned the disapproval of public opinion because of its inactivity. This only increased after the States-General in 1782 agreed with France on a naval alliance or \"concert\" that led to a planned joint action against Great Britain. To that end a Dutch fleet of ten ships of the line would in 1783 be sent to the French port of Brest to join the French fleet there. However, a direct order to set sail was disobeyed by the Dutch naval top with again the excuse of \"unreadiness,\" but some officers, like vice-admiral Lodewijk van Bylandt, the intended leader of the expedition, let it be known that they did not want to cooperate with the French. This caused a scandal, known as the Brest Affair in which Pieter Paulus, the \"fiscal\" (prosecutor) of the Admiralty of Rotterdam was to lead an inquest, but this never resulted in a conviction. But the damage to the reputation of the Dutch navy and the stadtholder as its commander-in-chief in Dutch public opinion was appreciable, and this undermined the regime.\n\nThe stadtholder was not the only one reminded by the American Declaration of Independence of its Dutch equivalent of 1581. Many others saw an analogy between the American Revolution and the Dutch Revolt, and this helped engender much sympathy for the American cause in Dutch public opinion. When John Adams arrived in the Netherlands from Paris in 1780, in search of Dutch loans for the financing of the American struggle, he came armed with a long list of Dutch contacts. At first, however, it was an uphill struggle to interest the Dutch elite. Adams set to work to influence public opinion with the help of a number of those Dutch contacts which he enumerates in a letter to United States Secretary of Foreign Affairs Robert Livingstone of 4 September 1782. He mentions the Amsterdam lawyer Hendrik Calkoen, who was very interested in the American cause, and who posed thirty questions on the matter that Adams answered in a number of letters, that were later bundled and published as an influential pamphlet. Calkoen was keen to again emphasize the analogy between the Dutch and American struggles for independence. He also mentions the Luzac family that published the \"Gazette de Leyde\", an influential newspaper, whose publisher Jean Luzac supported the American cause by publicising the American constitutional debate. The \"Gazette\" was the first European newspaper to carry a translation of the Constitution of Massachusetts, principally authored by Adams, on 3 October 1780. In that context Adams also mentions the journalist Antoine Marie Cerisier and his periodical \"le Politique hollandais\". Another propagandist for the American cause, who drew inferences for the Dutch political situation, was the Overijssel maverick nobleman Joan Derk van der Capellen tot den Pol, who had the Declaration of Independence, and other American constitutional documents, translated into Dutch.\n\nBy these propagandistic activities the American and Dutch causes became intertwined in the public's mind as a model of \"republican fraternity\". Adams himself harped on this theme in the \"Memorial\" he presented to the States-General to obtain acceptance of his credentials as ambassador on 19 April 1781: \nThe immediate audience of the \"Memorial\" may have been sceptical, but elsewhere the document made a great impression.\n\nIn the night of 25 on 26 September 1781, the anonymous pamphlet \"Aan het Volk van Nederland\" (\"To the People of the Netherlands\") was distributed in a number of Dutch cities. It was later discovered that it had been written by Adams' friend Van der Capellen, and that its successful distribution had been organised by François Adriaan van der Kemp. Though the pamphlet was immediately proscribed as seditious by the authorities, it enjoyed a wide circulation.\n\n\"Seditious\" it certainly was, as the pamphlet repeatedly exhorted the burghers of the Netherlands to arm themselves and take matters into their own hands. As was usual at the time, the pamphlet contained a romanticized overview of Dutch history, going back to the mythical ancestors of the Dutch people, the \"Bataven\", and taking the Middle Ages and the early history of the Republic in stride. But the perspective was decidedly anti-stadtholderian, and emphasized that the people are \"the true proprietors, the lords and masters of the country\", not the nobles and \"regenten\". The author likens the country to a great company, like the VOC, in which the administrators serve the shareholders. . The author then continues with a diatribe against the stadtholder: . Therefore:\n\nThese themes: the primacy of the people, whose servants the politicians are; the need to arm the people in units who elect their own officers; to elect commissioners who investigate government wrongdoing, as a parallel source of power next to the existing institutions; the need to protect the freedom of the press; would be repeated time after time in other Patriot pamphlets and the Patriot press in later years. But these ideas were rooted in a particular perspective on Dutch history, not in abstract philosophical ideas, taken from the French Enlightenment. It was a mixture of old and new ideas,\nand attitudes to the Dutch constitution. But this mixture would diverge into two distinctive strands in the course of the next few years, until it would lead to an ideological split between the \"aristocratic\" and \"democratic\" Patriots.\n\nOf course, \"Aan het Volk van Nederland\" was just one example of the many pamphlets, both Orangist and Patriot, that were published during the \"Patriottentijd\". But these one-off publications were soon joined by an innovation in the vernacular press. Before 1780 the \"opinion newspapers,\" like the \"Gazette de Leyde\" and the \"Politique Hollandais\" were written in French, and generally only read by the elite. But in 1781 the Patriot Pieter 't Hoen started a periodical in Dutch in Utrecht, entitled \"De Post van den Neder-Rhijn\" (The Post of the Lower Rhine) that would become a combination of opinion weekly, tabloid, and scandal sheet, with a Patriot bias that attacked the stadtholder and the \"aristocratic\" Patriots with equal abandon. It was soon joined by an Amsterdam magazine with the same character, the \"Politieke Kruijer\" (Political Porter), edited by J.C. Hespe, and later by Wybo Fijnje's \"Hollandsche Historische Courant\" (Dutch Historical Journal) in Delft. All these periodicals enjoyed great popularity in middle-class circles, probably because they mixed serious political analysis with scurrilous libels of the political elite. The journalists and publishers were often prosecuted by their enraged victims, but fines and jail-time were part of the job in these times. As they had a national readership they helped Patriot politics go beyond the local confines they would normally have encountered. And their ideological consistency helped to bring about unity in especially the \"democratic\" wing of the Patriot movement.\n\nSince the late Middle Ages cities in the Habsburg Netherlands had employed citizen militias for external defense (mostly against incursions from neighboring provinces), and to keep public order. These militias, called \"schutterijen\", played an important part in the early stages of the Dutch Revolt when they on their own successfully defended important cities against the Spanish troops of the Duke of Alba, which helped to give them an aura of heroism. In this early period the militia often formed a separate and independent center of power of the burghers who were its members, rivaling the \"vroedschap\" as the power center of the elite. This independence was symbolized by the fact that the \"schutterij\" usually elected its own officers. But starting in the early 17th century the militias lost their independence and became subservient to the regular city magistracy. They also became a part of the regular defense structure of the country, next to the States Army (though not part of that mercenary military formation). During the revolution of 1747 the \"Doelisten\" attempted to restore the independent role of the \"schutterijen\", but this attempt failed. By the early 1780s the militias were but a caricature of their proud predecessors, subservient to the city magistrates, who made officer commissions the preserve of the \"regenten\" class, and more like recreative societies than serious military formations. Many Patriots took this decline of the \"schutterijen\" as a synecdoche for the decline of the Republic, and the reform of the militias was seen as an important part of the necessary reform of the Republic. But as elsewhere the stadtholderian regime blocked such reform. \n\nFrom 1783 onwards, the Patriots therefore started to form their own militias, parallel to the official \"schutterijen\", which they called by innocuous names like \"exercitiegenootschappen\" or \"vrijcorpsen\" (Free Corps) in order not to provoke the city governments. In contrast with the \"schutterijen\" these competing militias were open to members of all religious denominations; they elected their own officers; and they trained regularly in military drill (\"exercitie\") and the use of arms. The Patriots proposed to use the militias to promote the representation of their officers in official councils, and to defend the rights of free assembly and speech of the citizenry.\nDepending on local political circumstances the Free corps sometimes remained a parallel military structure, and sometimes gradually took over the old \"schutterij\". An example of the latter was the city of Utrecht where under the direction of the \"exercitiegenootschap\" \"Pro Patria et Libertate\" (in which the student leader Quint Ondaatje played a prominent role) the \"schutterij\" was taken over by the Free Corps, while the old organisational structure with company names like \"the Pikes\" and \"the Black Boys\" was studiously retained (including the old flags and banners).\n\nAt first in some cities the \"vroedschap\" encouraged this usurpation of the role of the \"schutterij\", because it helped to undermine the stadtholder's right to appoint the leadership of the militia (as in Alkmaar, Leiden and Dordrecht), which the \"regenten\" resented themselves. But this in itself was a threat to the established order, as the claim to revive the \"schutterijen\" was commingled with the principle of electing officers freely from the citizenry and the claim to restore their \"proper\" place in the hierarchy of civic institutions. Where a \"regent\" remained in charge of the \"schutterij\" he was suddenly supposed to represent his men in the \"vroedschap\" thereby cunningly reverting the old hierarchy. The Patriots made no secret of the political implications of their reform of the \"schutterijen\". In cities like Leiden, Zutphen and Utrecht the Free corps drew up petitions demanding recognition of the newly-constituted militias by the city governments, which was subsequently granted. In this early phase there was a happy cooperation between the Patriots and the anti-Orangist \"regenten\", because of their common interest in diminishing the powers of the stadtholder. In Holland province his advantage of exercising command of the Hague garrison of the States Army was offset by the power of the Free Corps in most cities, and the latter had the additional advantage of providing a defense against the usual Orangist weapon of threatened mob violence, because the middle-class Patriots feared the city paupers as much as the \"regenten\" did, and formed a common front against the poor. And not without reason, because in several cities, there were Orangist-inspired riots by members of the working class, like the riots in Rotterdam in 1783 and the Hague in 1784, led by the fish-monger \"Kaat Mussel\". On 3 April 1784 such a riot was bloodily suppressed by a Free-Corps company in Rotterdam, when a panicky officer ordered his men to open fire on the mob, which resulted in several people killed. Initially, the officer was blamed, but (due to the fact that more and more riots occurred) the States of Holland later exonerated the Free Corps and blamed the Orangist rioters.\n\nThe Free Corps were a local phenomenon, limited to the areas where the Patriot movement was strong, partly because the Patriot ideology for a very long time respected the confederal structure of the Dutch Republic. They remained \"federal\" democrats. But from the end of 1784 they started to organize on a national level. In December the first congress of representatives of a federation of Free Corps assembled in Utrecht. This was soon followed by the second congress on 25 February 1785, which commissioned the Leiden Free Corps to draft a manifesto. This manifesto was adopted during the third congress, again in Utrecht on 14 June 1785. It took the form of a solemn \"Acte van Verbintenis ter verdediging der Republicainsche constitutie\" (Act of Association for the defense of the Republican constitution, or \"Act of Association\" for short) in which the members of the Free Corps pledged to support each other against attempts at suppression by the civil authorities and against attacks by Orangist mobs. Also the Act for the first time established \"Volksregering bij representatie\" (People's government by representation) as the ultimate goal of the Free Corps movement. But this was only the first such manifesto.\n\nThe \"Leids Ontwerp\" (Leiden Draft), another important Patriot manifesto, was drawn up after the Leiden \"exercitiegenootschap\" was prohibited from performing its drill maneuvers on 23 July 1785 by the city government. In response a congress of the representatives of the Holland \"exercitiegenootschappen\" commissioned a group of members, among whom Wybo Fijnje, Pieter Vreede, and Rutger Jan Schimmelpenninck to write the manifesto along the lines of the draft they discussed in a meeting on 4 October 1785. This resulted in the publication of the manifesto, entitled \"Ontwerp om de Republiek door eene heilzaame Vereeniging van Belangen van Regent en Burger van Binnen Gelukkig en van Buiten Gedugt te maaken\", Leiden, aangenomen bij besluit van de Provinciale Vergadering van de Gewapende Corpsen in Holland, op 4 oktober 1785 te Leiden\" (Design to make the Republic inwardly contented and outwardly feared by a salutary union of interests of Regent and Citizen, etc.) in which among other things the abolition of the right of approval of city-government appointments of the stadtholder was proposed, to be replaced by democratic elections.\n\nImplementing the Patriot manifestos brought a fundamental rift between the \"democratic\" and \"aristocratic\" wings of the Patriot movement to light. Initially both saw a common interest and a basis for cooperation (as the Leiden Draft explicitly proposes). This was exemplified by the Utrecht example where in July 1783 the \"vroedschap\" acceded to the demand of the local Free Corps to be recognized as the new manifestation of the \"schutterij\" under the direction of an elected Burgher Defense Council. Both factions were opposed to the 1674 Government Regulation that gave extensive powers to the stadtholder to appoint city magistrates. This was a standing invitation to abuse. Nicolaas de Pesters, \"schepen\" of Utrecht, was infamous for his abuse of political patronage. The matter came to a head when in January 1783 a member of the Utrecht \"vroedschap\" (i.e. a \"regent\") proposed to disavow the appointment rights of the stadtholder, and in August 1783 a petition of members of the newly reconstituted \"schutterij\" urged the \"vroedschap\" to no longer brook such interference. Attempts to come to an understanding with the stadtholder in the Fall of 1783 failed, because the latter insisted on his \"due rights.\" Then in January 1784 an occasion presented itself to test the stadtholder's resolve, when a vacancy in the \"vroedschap\" occurred. The \"regenten\" accepted the challenge and, studiously ignoring the stadtholder, appointed a moderate member of the \"schutterij\" to the vacant post.\n\nBut the honeymoon between the \"democrats\" and \"aristocrats\" did not last. On 23 April 1784 a draft of a new \"constitution\" for Utrecht province, to replace the 1674 Regulation, was published in the Utrecht Patriot newspaper \"Utrechtse Courant\", after the Utrecht States had imprudently invited all citizens to lodge their objections to the Regulations in early 1784. This draft of 117 articles proposed that henceforth the Utrecht city \"vroedschap\" was to be popularly elected under a form of census suffrage in indirect elections. This relatively moderate proposal directly attacked the co-option rights of the \"regenten\". Another objectionable proposal was the institution of an elected body of 16 burgher representatives to sit in permanent session to hear and address grievances of citizens against the city government. The \"regenten\" were not about to let go of their powers without a fight, but instead of getting into a direct confrontation with the democrats they at first tried to drown the proposal in red tape. The States drafted a far more conservative counter-proposal and tried to push this through by subterfuge. This elicited a strong response of the Utrecht \"schutterij\" in the form of a petition opposing that counter-draft. The \"schutterij\" also elected a group of 24 representatives (among whom Ondaatje), which called themselves the \"Constituted,\" to conduct direct negotiations with the \"vroedschap\". The Constituted soon set themselves up as a rival power center to the \"vroedschap\", and started acting like the proposed Burgher Council from the draft-constitution.\n\nThe negotiations fruitlessly dragged on and in January 1785 six companies of the \"schutterij\" approached the Constituted to urge them to take more drastic steps. The irate \"shooters\" elected a new group of representatives, called the \"Commissioned,\" to permanently ensure the zeal of the Constituted. The \"vroedschap\" grudgingly accepted the Constituted as permanent representatives of the \"schutterij\" on 21 February 1785, but made no further concessions. But then fate intervened, another member of the \"vroedschap\" died and the Constituted and Commissioned petitioned the \"vroedschap\" to fill the vacancy with someone sympathetic to their cause. The \"vroedschap\" then went out of its way to appoint someone the petitioners had already declared \"unacceptable\", one Jonathan Sichterman.\n\nThe train of events that then was set in motion could be considered a \"paradigm\" for revolutionary \"journées\" that would be followed in similar circumstances in Utrecht itself, and in other Dutch cities in the following two years. First the city government would commit some kind of \"provocation\" that would enrage the Free Corps members and other Patriots. The democrats would work themselves into a lather, whipped up by seditious pamphlets and speeches. Then they would march to the town hall and assemble, with their weapons, in the town square, which they would easily fill with their large numbers. The city fathers would be summoned to come to the town hall and would be more or less locked up in their meeting room. They would not be physically assaulted (even provided with food and drink), but the psychological pressure of the threatening crowd, and the threats that \"it would be impossible to constrain them, if the demands were not met\" would soon convince them to give in. But once everybody had returned home in triumph, the city fathers would regain their courage, and renege on their promises \"as these had been forced under duress.\" And a new cycle would soon commence.\n\nSomething like this happened on March 11–12, 1785 in Utrecht when agitators like Ondaatje whipped the crowd into a frenzy, the Utrecht city hall was surrounded by 2,000 angry Free Corps men, and the Utrecht \"vroedschap\" reluctantly agreed to withdraw Sicherman's appointment, after Ondaatje made clear that the Constituted would not be fobbed off. \"We are not '48-ers,\" he declared, \"but 85-ers, who understand our rights and liberties well enough, ... we are not \"canaille\"\" referring to a similar event during the revolution of 1748, when the \"Doelisten\" had indeed been fobbed off by the then-stadtholder. But the reaction was swift: 17 members of the \"vroedschap\" resigned in protest, and soon a petition of notable citizens was sent to the States with a request to intervene. The States excoriated Ondaatje and his mob and manage to intimidate Ondaatje sufficiently to elicit a humble apology. On 23 March the 19 \"vroedschap\" members reoccupied their seats, and opened criminal proceedings against Ondaatje and other instigators of the events of 11 March. Sicherman could have his appointment back, but he declined; the council therefore left the vacancy unfilled.\n\nBut the democrats were back in August and again in September with demonstrations following the established paradigm. Eventually, end December 1785, things came to a head when in a final demonstration of Free Corps strength the \"vroedschap\" was forced to capitulate. On 20 December they promised to adopt a democratic city constitution within three months. And indeed, on 20 March 1786, while the Free Corps again occupied the central square in silent menace, while a blizzard blew, the \"vroedschap\" allowed several of its members to formally abjure the old Government Regulation. On 2 August 1786 an elected Burgher College was installed as the new city council.\n\nIn the Spring of 1787 similar events took place in Amsterdam. The political situation in that city had long been very different than in Utrecht. The Amsterdam \"regenten\" belonged to the old States-Party faction and were as such opposed to the stadtholder long before the Patriot movement started to rear its head. Its pensionary, Engelbert François van Berckel, together with the pensionaries of Dordrecht (Cornelis de Gijselaar) and of Haarlem (Adriaan van Zeebergh) formed an anti-stadtholderian triumvirate in the States of Holland during the days of the war with Great Britain. But this was all based on the interests of Amsterdam as a mercantile city. The Amsterdam \"regenten\" were in no mood for \"democratic\" experiments that would undermine their privileges. The more the democrats gained influence in other cities, the more the Amsterdam \"regenten\" drew closer to their Orangist enemies, and the stadtholder's regime. Van Berckel lost the initiative to Orangist \"regenten\" like Joachim Rendorp, and Willem Gerrit Dedel Salomonsz, who formed an Orangist minority within the Amsterdam \"vroedschap\". Amsterdam had a large Free Corps, consisting of 55 companies, but the old \"schutterij\", under Orangist command, was still a rival armed force. Besides, the Patriots did not have a monopoly on mob violence, as the workers in the Amsterdam shipbuilding industry, the so-called \"Bijltjes\" (\"Ax-men\"), were a strongly pro-Orange political force in the city. Patriot political clubs were rivaled by Orangist political clubs. In sum, the political forces were more evenly balanced than in other cities. And this paralyzed the Amsterdam \"vroedschap\" in the Spring of 1787. Things came to a head in February 1787 when a group of Free-Corps officers, led by a Colonel Isaac van Goudoever forced entry to the council chamber in protest against an anti-Patriot move Dedel had engineered. Only the intervention of Hendrik Daniëlsz Hooft, a venerable burgemeester prevented a fracas. On 3 April Goudoever returned at the head of 102 officers to demand that henceforth Amsterdam would only be represented by its pensionaries Van Berckel and Visscher (who were both trusted by the Patriots) in the States of Holland. Dedel replied with an attempt to come to an arrangement with the stadtholder in which Amsterdam would align itself with the stadtholderian regime in exchange for concessions by the stadtholder on the point of his right of appointment (which the States-Party \"regenten\" had always opposed), and his help with mobilizing the \"Bijltjes\". This conspiracy failed due to the obduracy of the stadtholder, but on 20 April 1787 an incendiary pamphlet, entitled \"Het Verraad Ontdekt\" (\"The Treason Discovered\"), made it public, and this incensed the Patriots. That night the city was abuzz with fervid Patriot activity. The Burgher Defense Council, which commanded the Free Corps, organised a petition (the \"Act of Qualification\") which was signed by 16,000 people, and the next day the Dam Square before the city hall was thronged with thousands of guild members, Patriot citizens and armed militiamen. The Amsterdam council was once more locked in chambers, not expected to emerge without a positive decision, and on the initiative of Hooft the \"vroedschap\" was purged of the members whose dismissal had been demanded in the Act of Qualification. Amsterdam had belatedly joined the Patriot coalition. The rioting of the \"Bijltjes\" on 30 May 1787 did not change this.\n\nOther cities in Holland that had been holding out, like Rotterdam, where Pieter Paulus finally managed a purge of the \"vroedschap\", and several cities, like Delft, Dordrecht, Alkmaar, Hoorn, and Monnikendam were helped along by the \"Flying Legion\", a corps of 300 Free Corps members, and 200 horses, led by Adam Gerard Mappa, threatening violence. Delft's \"liberation\" gave the Patriots command of the largest arsenal in Holland province in the Summer of 1787.\n\nMany historians would deny that the political upheavals in the Dutch Republic during the years 1785, 1786 and 1787 amounted to a civil war. It is true that compared to the French revolution the Patriot revolution was singularly bloodless and that widespread military maneuvering remained the exception. But there actually were military actions by regular forces on both sides, aimed at deciding the issue by military means, and blood was spilled in battle. To understand how this came about, it is important first to understand the way the forces on both sides were distributed in the seven provinces and the Generality Lands. The States Army, commanded by the stadtholder, was a mercenary army, paid for by the several provinces according to a formula for apportionment, called the \"repartitie\". Holland paid for more than half of the troops, and it was known which regiments belonged to its \"repartitie\", though this had no consequences for the operational command, as the army was an institution of the Republic as a whole. The troops were in peacetime usually divided over a number of garrisons in different parts of the country. These garrisons played an important role in local politics, as the officers were Orangists to a man, and the troops in the whole felt a strong allegiance to the stadtholder. The garrison cities, like Nijmegen in Gelderland, The Hague in Holland, and 'sHertogenbosch in \"States Brabant\" were strongpoints of Orangist influence, even though the surrounding provinces might tend to favor the Patriots. So even without explicitly threatening military violence, the army played an important role in local politics.\n\nBefore 1784 the States army was the only official standing army in the Republic, but during the so-called Kettle War, a minor military conflict with the Austrian emperor and sovereign of the Austrian Netherlands, Joseph II, the States of Holland lost confidence in the States army under the wavering command of the stadtholder, and decided to raise a separate military formation of brigade strength, outside the States army, under the command of the Rhinegrave of Salm, an officer in the States army, for its own account. This so-called \"Legion of Salm\" was not subject to the stadtholder as Captain-General of the States army. After the crisis passed, the States of Holland decided to abolish it, as an austerity measure, but several Holland cities, Amsterdam among them, decided to take over the financing for their own account, so that from 1785 on the Legion continued in being as a military unit that was not part of the official military command structure, and also not part of the Free Corps federation, because the members of the Legion were mercenaries, just like the soldiers of the army. The Legion did not play a role, until the Rhinegrave in September 1786 became commander-in-chief of all forces of the province of Holland, including the States army troops under the Holland \"repartitie\", and later also the Free Corps in the provinces of Holland and Utrecht.\n\nThe events that gave rise to this development were the following. In September 1785, after a number of riots between Patriots and Orangists in The Hague during the Summer of that year, the States of Holland (by then with a slender majority of cities tending toward the Patriot side) decided to deprive the stadtholder of his command of the strong Hague garrison of the States army (though this was only formalized in July 1786). On 15 September 1785 he therefore decided to leave the city and to repair to the Het Loo Palace in Gelderland with his family. Around the same time things had come to a head in Utrecht city and part of the States of Utrecht decided to move to the city of Amersfoort, causing a schism in the States, as the representatives of the city of Utrecht and several other cities remained in Utrecht city. The Amersfoort States subsequently asked the stadtholder to put a garrison of States army troops in Amersfoort and Zeist, which was done in September 1785 with a cavalry division from the Nijmegen garrison.\n\nThis remained the status quo until in May 1786 the \"vroedschappen\" of the Gelderland cities of Hattem and Elburg refused to seat a number of Orangist candidates in defiance of the stadtholder's right of appointment, and with help of Patriot Free Corps of Kampen, Overijssel, Zwolle and Zutphen started to fortify the cities under the command of the young firebrand Patriot Herman Willem Daendels, a Hattem native. The pro-Orangist States of Gelderland then asked the stadtholder to lend a hand in suppressing this \"insurrection\" and on 4 September a task-force of the Nijmegen garrison duly marched to Hattem and entered that city over light opposition the next day. The troops were allowed to loot the two small cities and desecrate the local churches. Stadtholder William V is said to have exclaimed on the news of the success of the operation: \"Have they be hanged? Hell and Damnation. Why not hang the Satan's children?\".\n\nThe \"Hattem and Elburg events\" electrified the Patriot opposition. Pensionary de Gijselaar (calling the stadtholder \"a new Alva\") demanded in the States of Holland that the stadtholder would be deprived of his command as Captain-General of the States army (which only the States General could do), and in any case take the troops on the Holland \"repartitie\" out of the States army. When this was done this deprived the stadtholder of more than half of his troops, effectively denying him the military means to decide the political conflict. Holland also made a pact with the Utrecht States and the Overijssel cities (the Overijssel States were hopelessly divided) to form a so-called \"Cordon\" to defend these provinces against military depredations of the rump-States army. The overall command of this Cordon was given to a military commission, headquartered in Woerden, while the Holland troops were put under the command of the Rhinegrave of Salm. Another important political development was that the Amsterdam \"regenten\" (still not purged of the Orangist minority) formally adhered to the Act of Association that the Free Corps had promulgated in the Summer of 1785.\n\nIn Utrecht city the Patriots feared an attack from the Amersfoort and Zeist troops, and started to fortify the city against a siege. The defenders received reinforcements from Holland and other Patriot strongholds, so that by the Spring of 1787 they numbered 6,000. When the Utrecht Defense Council learned that the States army had sent a task-force to occupy the hamlet of Vreeswijk near a strategically important sluice (useful to defensively inundate the surrounding countryside) they decided to force a confrontation. On 9 May 1787 the Patriot force under the command of the Utrecht \"vroedschap\" member Jean Antoine d'Averhoult attacked the States-army force in the Battle of Jutphaas, and despite several people killed, routed the mercenaries. Though this was only a skirmish, the Patriot propaganda made hay of the victory and the officer killed received a state funeral.\n\nThe Patriot Revolt did not take place in a diplomatic vacuum. The Dutch Republic had from its inception been a battlefield of Great Power diplomacy in which the Holland \"regenten\" (lately in the guise of the States Party) had been sympathetic to France, and the Orangists usually favored England and later Great Britain. Since the days of the 1688 invasion of England followed by the 1689 naval treaty with England, the Dutch had been in nominal alliance with the British, and the diplomatic relations with France had been cool since the end of the War of the Spanish Succession and the latest French invasion in 1747, but they had markedly improved during the era of the American Revolutionary War, when the Dutch at first profited from their \"neutral-flag\" trade of contraband goods with the French and Americans, and later were the victims of British aggression in the Fourth Anglo-Dutch War, that had so recently ended. Franco-Dutch relations became even better when France offered its good offices, both to obtain the 1784 treaty of Paris with Great Britain that ended the war, and subsequently to obtain peace with emperor Joseph II, that ended the \"Kettle War\" with the Treaty of Fontainebleau. Shortly after that, special envoy Gerard Brantsen, a moderate Patriot, crowned this with the treaty of amity and commerce with France of October 1785.\n\nOne person who observed this thaw in Franco-Dutch diplomatic relations with great alarm was the new British ambassador to The Hague, accredited since 1784, Sir James Harris. Harris had a tendency to see French conspiracies everywhere, and in the Dutch case he may have been right. Because the French saw the discomfiture of the Dutch stadtholder with great pleasure, although their enthusiasm was limited to the advance of their old friends, the Amsterdam States Party \"regenten\"; they were far less enthusiastic about the democratic designs of the other wing of the Patriot party. With the support of the Cabinet of William Pitt the Younger Harris set about to reclaim the Republic for British influence, and he did not always limit himself to diplomatic means. One important task was to shore up the morale of the dispirited stadtholder after his departure from The Hague in September 1785. William at that time had two options: either to give in to the Patriot demands and accept some kind of compromise as to the Government Regulations, or to hold on to his \"due rights\" at any cost. The latter was his favorite option (he was wont to quote the maxim \"Aut Caesar, aut nihil\") and Harris, in concert with William's wife Wilhelmina of Prussia, encouraged him to take this option. But Harris did far more: he was supplied with ample funds from the British Secret Service fund and he used that money to buy influence left and right, beginning with a generous pension-with-strings-attached of £4,000 \"per annum\" for the stadtholder himself. Ably assisted by \"confidential agents\", of which baron Hendrik August van Kinckel is the best known, he used these funds to subsidize the establishment of Orangist Free Corps in provinces like Zeeland and Friesland where the Orangists were in the majority, which were used to intimidate the Patriot minorities in these provinces. He tried to lure the conservative \"regenten\" in Amsterdam away from their anti-Orangist stance with promises of trade concessions by Britain, and promises of concessions from the stadtholder that would safeguard their own privileges, but avoid any \"democratic\" experiments.\n\nBut Harris' most important ploy was an attempt to engineer an alliance with Prussia that would thwart the \"French designs\". This would kill two birds with one stone: it would keep the stadtholder in power, and it would renew the Anglo-Prussian alliance that had briefly existed during the Seven Years' War. To that end he visited the aging king Frederick the Great of Prussia, Wilhelmina's uncle, in August 1785 in Berlin. But Frederick was loath to endanger good relations with France, and refused to take the bait. \"The pear is not ripe,\" the old king remarked cryptically.\n\nInstead Prussia in concert with France attempted to mediate between the warring parties in the Republic. To that end both countries sent mediators, the ambassadors Vérac and Thulemeyer, who repeatedly attempted to bring the moderates to compromise. For instance, in 1785 they proposed that the stadtholder would cede his military powers to a council, with the Princess, the pensionaries, and the leaders of both the Orangist and \"aristocratic\" Patriot factions as members (only the democrats would be excluded). But William refused to budge on his \"due rights\" and without that the Patriots would not budge either.\n\nIn 1786 a Prussian minister, Johann von Goertz, came to The Hague with a proposal that might even be acceptable to the democrats, but Harris easily convinced William, already in great spirits after the events of Hattem and Elburg, that this would amount to a \"capitulation\" and the stadtholder appended conditions that were unacceptable to the Patriots. In other words, Harris was a constant obstacle to any attempts at a peaceful solution.\n\nIn any case, Frederick the Great died in August 1786, and was succeeded by his nephew (Wilhelmina's elder brother) Frederick William II of Prussia. Though the new king was not keen to go to war with France, he was less determined to avoid such a development than the old king, and from then on Harris' designs to let the Prussians do the fighting on behalf of Great Britain stood a better chance. And the French game of egging on the Patriots on the one hand, and keeping them in check on the other, became more risky. The French opposite number of von Goertz, the marquis de Rayneval, understood this, and also that a victory of the democrats in the Republic would be against French interests; France became less and less enthusiastic about favoring the Patriots.\n\nHarris meanwhile went on with his policy of confrontation, that stood a better chance of success as also the French foreign minister Vergennes died in February 1787. With both Frederick the Great and Vergennes out of the way it was far more likely that France would allow a Prussian military intervention without a major European conflagration. Between 13 and 18 May 1787 (so shortly after the Battle of Jutphaas) a conference of Orangist notables was held in Nijmegen to decide on a strategy of confrontation. Harris stood ready with a subsidy of £70,000, ostensibly as a loan to the Orangist States of Gelderland), but in reality as a slush fund to finance Orangist Free Corps, to be used in street rioting, and to buy the favors of the vacillating Overijssel cities to leave the Patriot camp. A kind of \"de facto\" \"declaration of war\" (the \"Declaratoir\") was reluctantly signed by the stadtholder on 26 May 1787.\n\nThen, completely unexpected, an event happened that played into Harris' hands. Harris had convinced Princess Wilhelmina that the Orangist forces in The Hague had become strong enough that it might be possible to wrest that city from the hands of the Patriots. Audacious where her husband was irresolute, she decided to make an appearance in The Hague to bring matters to a boil. To that end she planned a trip with a small entourage, but without an armed escort, from Nijmegen to The Hague by way of a route close to the Patriot stronghold of Gouda on 28 June 1787. Fresh horses had been ordered for her carriages at several stops underway, thereby advertising her planned route. To make certain that the Patriots would be aware of what was afoot, several Orangist agents \"let slip\" to everyone that would be interested, that the Princess was about to pass by. It was therefore no surprise that she was intercepted by a patrol of the Gouda Free Corps near the Goejanverwellesluis in the hamlet of Bonrepas. The Princess was not harmed and she was soon allowed to return to Nijmegen, but the fact that her captors had been impolite (one of them sat unbidden at her dinner table, which was a serious breach of etiquette; another stood with a drawn sabre in her presence) caused great consternation and outrage. Especially her brother the Prussian king now lost his patience with the Patriots, and the Dutch in general, and demanded in a first ultimatum to the States General the immediate reinstatement of the Princess in The Hague, and the exemplary punishment of the culprits of the \"Lèse-majesté\". The States of Holland were less than impressed and urged that the ultimatum would be huffily ignored.\n\nNow the French played a dangerous game. Vergennes' successor Montmorin gave the impression that France would support the Patriots in case of Prussian military intervention and that to this end a military camp was being prepared in Givet, on an invasion route through the independent Prince-Bishopric of Liège, obviating the necessity of entering the Austrian Netherlands. This turned out to be a bluff, and once this became clear to the Prussians and Harris, nothing prevented an invasion of the Republic. But the Patriots, informed of the French intervention plans by yet another French envoy Jean-François de Bourgoing believed in the Givet camp till it was too late, and it steeped them in their resistance to the Prussian demands. An invasion force of around 26,000 Prussian troops under the command of the duke of Brunswick (a nephew of William's old mentor) entered the Republic on 13 September 1787, after a final ultimatum was again left unanswered.\n\nDespite all the martiality of the Free Corps their resistance proved to be negligible. The armed camp of Utrecht, where the Rhinegrave of Salm had personally assumed command a few months earlier, was evacuated without a fight, after Salm on 14 September convinced the Military Commission in Woerden that it was a rat trap, about to be encircled by two Prussian pincers, and that it was strategically necessary to retreat to Amsterdam. This earned the Rhinegrave the enduring opprobrium of the Patriots and all Dutch historians, but he was probably right. The retreat proved, however, a death blow to Patriot morale. Though the Patriots indeed made a stand around Amsterdam (without Salm, however, who was replaced by a French officer, Jean Baptiste Ternant). The Prussians attacked on 1 October and the city capitulated on the 10th, after the French had intimated that no assistance would be forthcoming.\n\nThe stadtholder returned to The Hague on 20 September 1787 at the head of the States-army troops that had marched together with the triumphant Prussian army. A purge of the States of Holland and the States General, both institutions who had their seat in The Hague, started immediately. The immediate result was that Mappa, who was in charge of the fortress town of Naarden was ordered by the reconstituted States of Holland to surrender it to the Prussians, which he, in a remarkable show of obedience to legitimacy, did on 27 September.\n\nEven before the return of the stadtholder the Holland \"ridderschap\" had taken the initiative to have the States repeal all legislation of the preceding years with a \"Patriot\" imprint. The \"Orange Restoration\" proceeded apace. Everywhere the Patriot members of the local \"vroedschappen\" and city magistracies were purged. The Grand Pensionary of Holland Pieter van Bleiswijk (who had chosen the Patriot side in 1785) was replaced by his Zeeland colleague Laurens Pieter van de Spiegel in November 1787. On the instruction of Princess Wilhelmina and ambassador Harris he started criminal proceedings against a number of Patriot leaders on a list Wilhelmina thoughtfully provided, like Robert Jasper van der Capellen, two \"burgemeesters\", and two Elburg ministers, who were all sentenced to death \"in absentia\". Daendels and Ondaatje were sentenced to perpetual banishment, as were a number of other Patriot leaders. A limited Amnesty was declared in November 1787, but the \"extra-judicial\" persecution of Patriots was more effective anyway: in Gouda 200 houses were looted by the Orangist mob; in 'sHertogenbosch 829; in Utrecht the bill ran to 1 million guilders. \n\nMore than 40,000 Patriots (including women and children) fled abroad to Antwerp and Brussels in the Austrian Netherlands, and from there to towns in French Flanders (in those days still Flemish speaking), like Saint-Omer and Dunkirk, where they were hospitably received by the French government, at the request of Van der Capellen tot den Marsch, who wrote a memorandum to King Louis asking for financial support of the refugees. The king indeed provided funding for such financial relief, which was administered by the Frisian Patriots Court Lambertus van Beyma as Commissioner, and Johan Valckenaer, as his secretary. They represented the \"aristocrat\" and \"democrat\" wings of the Frisian Patriots, respectively, however, and soon fell out over the disbursements. This led to a schism in the Patriot community in France. The followers of Valckenaer eventually came out on top, as they won the support of the French comptroller-general Charles Claude Guillaume Lambert, who was enraged by Beyma's venality. The two factions, \"Valckenisten\" and \"Beymanisten\" went at it hammer and tongs, and formed competing clubs that became embroiled in internal French politics during the French Revolution. Valckenaer became involved in the Batavian Legion that fell afoul of the Jacobins, who distrusted foreigners. But eventually the Dutch Patriots got back in the good graces of the French government after the Thermidorian Reaction and Dutch volunteers formed part of the French army that invaded the Dutch Republic in late 1794. Daendels and Jan Willem de Winter even became \"générals de brigade\".\n\nOther Patriots eventually migrated to the United States, like Mappa, who established a type foundry in New York City, that soon went bankrupt, however. He later became the agent of the Holland Land Company, a vehicle for land speculation founded by a number of Amsterdam Patriot financiers in 1789, in Trenton, NJ, where he was joined by François Adriaan van der Kemp, the distributor of Van der Capellen's pamphlet.\n\nThe Patriot Revolt, its causes and its denouement in the Prussian intervention were of great interest to the Founding Fathers. This is illustrated by Federalist Paper No. 20, written by James Madison and published under the pseudonym \"Publius\" on 11 December 1787 in the context of the debate about the United States Constitution, more particularly about the defects of the Articles of Confederation and similar constitutions. After a perspicacious description and analysis of the constitution of the Dutch Republic the paper continues: \nIn other words, an example to avoid. The Paper explicitly refers to the Prussian intervention, but apparently the news of its success had not yet reached the U.S. by the time of the paper's publication, as the wording leaves the hope open that the Patriots will prevail: \n\nIn the Dutch Republic, meanwhile, Harris did his best to insure that such an outcome would not come about; that there would not be a repeat of the Patriot Revolt; and that the stadtholderian regime would remain on top in perpetuity. To that end he initiated a network of diplomatic treaties that would anchor the regime, beginning with a treaty between Great Britain and the Dutch Republic, signed on 15 April 1788 by Van de Spieghel in London. It guaranteed the stadtholderate to the House of Orange-Nassau in perpetuity and formed a defensive alliance between the two countries. On the same date, at the same hour, a similar treaty was signed between Prussia and the Republic in Berlin. To complete the triangle, Harris managed to bring about a treaty between Great Britain and Prussia during a visit of the Prussian king to his sister at \"Het Loo\" on 12/13 June 1788, again guaranteeing the stadtholderian constitution, and renewing the Anglo-Prussian military alliance. This led to the Triple Alliance that was signed on 13 August 1788 between all three countries. Meanwhile, on 10 July 1788 the States General had passed the Act of Guarantee that became a formal part of the Constitution of the Dutch Republic. In this case \"perpetuity\" only lasted seven years. One of the first actions of the \nProvisional Representatives of the People of Holland during the Batavian Revolution of 1795, that founded the Batavian Republic, was its repeal and ritual burning on 16 February 1795. The stadtholder had already fled to Great Britain with his family. He would never return.\n\n"}

After its failure, executives decided to let Duran Duran choose their own single releases. The band's first selection was \"Girls on Film\" and it duly became their first Top 5 hit in the UK.\n\nThe video was shot in Soho and directed by Perry Haines, who went on to form i-D Magazine.\n\nThere are two different cuts of this video. The second version, which was included in the \"Duran Duran\" video album released in 1983, features minor re-edits of certain scenes. The original version of the video was finally released on the \"Duran Duran\" (first album) 2010 2CD+DVD remaster.\n\nAn example of the differences between the two videos occur during the line, \"On the table, signs of love lie scattered.\" In the original version, Simon is sitting on the couch, ripping up a piece of paper. He then proceeds to take the tulips out of the vase, then throws them in the air. In the second version, it shows a shot of the band on stage, then cuts to Simon taking the tulips and throwing them.\n\nAnother example is during the line, \"I walked out into the sun, I try to find a new day.\" In the original, Simon is in the white room, opening the door, with him disappearing into a bright light. In the re-edit, it once again shows a shot of the band on stage, lipsynching.\n\nThe band resurrected the song to play live during their reunion shows in 2004 and 2005. The song was accompanied on video screens behind the stage by a unique anime-style video, featuring stylized versions of the band members fighting giant monsters, spaceships, and destroying a skyscraper labelled \"EMI\" for \"Endangered Music Industry\" (a dig at the band's old record company).\n\nThe song \"Khanada\" (pronounced \"keh-NAY-duh\") was included as the B-side to the single. It is reported to have been written for fashion designer Jane Kahn who owned, with partner Patti Bell, the Hurst Street shop Kahn & Bell where Duran Duran (and numerous other clubgoers of the day) shopped for clothes.\n\n\"Careless Memories\" is one of three original-era singles that didn't include a remix of the title track (although the fade-out on the 12\" is slightly longer), the other two being \"Save A Prayer\" and \"A View to a Kill\". To compensate for this, EMI issued a bonus B-side on the 12\", a faithful cover of David Bowie's \"Fame\". However, the \"Careless Memories\" 12\" version fades out at 3:44 seconds, the 7\" version three seconds earlier at 3:41. The 7\" version is included in the \"Singles Box Set 1981-1985\" but runs to 3:44 as it includes three seconds of silence after the fade out.\n\nIn Japan, the two b-sides were released on the \"Nite Romantics\" EP, along with night versions of \"Girls on Film\" and \"Planet Earth\".\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen the song \"Is There Something I Should Know?\" was issued as a single in the US, \"Careless Memories\" was placed on the flipside. The song was also a favourite live staple throughout the 1980s, as evidenced on the live album \"Arena\".\n\nA live version of \"Careless Memories\" recorded in December 1981 at the Hammersmith Odeon in London was released in 1982 as the b-side to \"Hungry Like The Wolf\".\n\nPerhaps due to its poor charting, \"Careless Memories\" was one of the few singles not included in either the \"\" or \"Greatest\" single compilations.\n\nApart from the single, \"Careless Memories\" has also appeared on:\n\nAlbums:\n\nSingles:\n\n\n\nThe song has a rock double-timed bass line in the key of E, with a keyboard intro played deliberately off-time.\n\n"}

It has elected one Member of Parliament (MP) since its 1832 creation.\n\nThe constituency is represented by Tony Lloyd of the Labour Party. He was first elected MP for this seat in 2017; previously, he had been the MP for Stretford and then Manchester Central from 1983 until his resignation from Parliament in 2012.\n\nAs there were no township boundaries in 1832, the original constituency was defined as a circular area in a radius of three-quarters of a mile from the old market place. In 1868 the boundary was extended to include Wardleworth, Spotland, Wuerdle, Belfield, Newbold, Buersill, and Marland. \n\n1918–1950: The County Borough of Rochdale\n\n1950–1983: As prior but with redrawn boundaries\n\n1983–1997: The Borough of Rochdale wards of Balderstone, Brimrod and Deeplish, Castleton, Central and Falinge, Healey, Newbold, Norden and Bamford, Smallbridge and Wardleworth, and Spotland\n\n1997–2010: The Borough of Rochdale wards of Balderstone, Brimrod and Deeplish, Central and Falinge, Healey, Littleborough, Newbold, Smallbridge and Wardleworth, Spotland, and Wardle\n\n2010–present: The Borough of Rochdale wards of Balderstone and Kirkholt, Central Rochdale, Healey, Kingsway, Littleborough Lakeside, Milkstone and Deeplish, Milnrow and Newhey, Smallbridge and Firgrove, Spotland and Falinge, and Wardle and West Littleborough\n\nThe constituency is one of two covering the Metropolitan Borough of Rochdale. It contains most of the town of Rochdale itself as well as Littleborough, Wardle and some of the surrounding rural area.\n\nFor the 2010 general election, the seat gained the villages of Milnrow and Newhey from Oldham East and Saddleworth and lost the areas of Sudden, Marland, and part of Norden to Heywood and Middleton, a 19.16% boundary change. Those changes made the seat a notional Labour victory in the Rallings and Thrasher figures which were used by the Press Association for determining gains, losses and swings. However, other predictions by political commentator Martin Baxter showed the seat maintaining a narrow Lib Dem majority.\n\nRochdale was one of the constituencies created by the Reform Act of 1832, and has been a Labour/Liberal Democrat marginal for many years, although it was held by the Conservatives for part of the 1950s, until a 1958 by-election.\n\nIt was held for two decades by Cyril Smith, first of the Liberal Party and then of the Liberal Democrats. He won a by-election in 1972, taking the seat from Labour, and held it until his retirement in 1992. A native Rochdalian and a former Labour Party member himself, he had a substantial personal vote which helped him retain his seat. It has since emerged that Smith was a serial child abuser.\n\nAfter his retirement, contests have been tighter. The Liberal Democrats held the seat at first, with Liz Lynne winning at the 1992 general election, only to lose to Labour's Lorna Fitzsimons at the 1997 election. However, they regained the seat at the 2005 election, with Paul Rowen defeating Fitzsimons. In 2010, the town was brought to national attention when then-Prime Minister Gordon Brown was caught on a tape recording describing a local woman, Gillian Duffy, as a \"bigot\" after having a conversation with her while campaigning (later described as \"Bigotgate\" by the UK media), but despite the unfavourable publicity, Labour still managed to narrowly win the seat from the Liberal Democrats, and in 2015 achieved their highest majority in the seat's history, with the Liberal Democrats falling to fourth place.\n\nA General Election was due to take place by the end of 1915. By the summer of 1914, the following candidates had been adopted to contest that election. Due to the outbreak of war, the election never took place.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1820430", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1820430", "title": "Campbeltown and Machrihanish Light Railway", "text": "Campbeltown and Machrihanish Light Railway\n\nThe Campbeltown and Machrihanish Light Railway was a narrow gauge railway in Kintyre, Scotland, between Campbeltown and the coalmining village of Machrihanish. Only three other passenger-carrying lines in the UK operated on the same gauge, all of them in Wales - the Corris Railway, the short-lived Plynlimon and Hafan Tramway and the Talyllyn Railway.\n\nCoal has been mined on the Kintyre peninsula since 1498 or before. Although not of the highest quality, the coal found there was abundant and relatively cheap to extract. In the middle of the eighteenth century the collieries of the area were kept busy supplying the many whisky distilleries in the Campbeltown area.\n\nIn 1773 James Watt surveyed a canal to connect the coal mines to Campbeltown to reduce the costs of transportation. The Campbeltown and Machrihanish Canal was opened in 1791.\n\nThis early transportation link fell into disuse and had been virtually abandoned by 1856. In 1875, the Argyll Coal and Canal Co. acquired the main colliery and found the canal in a state of disrepair. They decided a better transportation system was required and began to investigate the building of a railway to Campbeltown.\n\nAs rail transport developed in the 19th century, the colliery owners sought to build a tramway to replace the canal. In 1876 a lightly constructed industrial railway was built connecting Kilkivan Pit to Campbeltown, a distance of . For a short length the line ran on the formation of the canal before reaching Campbeltown, where it ended on a pier.\n\nThe colliery railway only ever carried coal traffic and used two locomotives, \"Princess\" and \"Chevalier\" to haul the trains of mine tubs.\n\nThe colliery railway's traffic was largely seasonal as most of the colliery output was consumed locally. Around the turn of the century the mine owners began to search for additional traffic for the summer season. At the same time, new steam ships began bringing tourists to the remote Kintyre peninsula. This led to the formation of the Association of Argyll Railway Co. Ltd. which applied for an order under the Light Railways Act to build a railway connecting Campbeltown with Machrihanish, on the west coast of the peninsula.\n\nConstruction of the Campbeltown and Machrihanish Light Railway began in November 1905. The majority of the route of the new railway followed the colliery tramway, but with several of the steeper gradients and sharper curves eased. The colliery line was also extended west to the new terminus at Machrihanish. The work was completed in 1906 and the railway opened on 18 August 1906. It was an immediate success, attracting 10,000 passengers in its first three weeks of operation and replacing the horse-drawn tourist charabanc traffic in Campbeltown.\n\nIn the years leading up to the First World War the railway thrived on a mixture of coal and passenger traffic. After the war, competition from new motor buses began to reduce the railway's profitable tourist trade. By 1931 the summer tourist trade had dwindled significantly. Although passenger trains did run in early 1932, the railway was failing and it abandoned passenger services in May 1932. By November 1933 the railway had been wound up and in May 1934 the last trains ran, assisting in the scrapping of the line.\n\nAccording to Davies both the railway and the colliery were acquired about 1929 by the Maisel Oil Company, which had a patent for a process to produce oil from coal. This concern was not successful and the line closed to passengers in September 1931 and to all traffic in November 1932.\n\nMacmillan gives a slightly different version:\n\"In June (1928) the Franco British Co. acquired the Argyll colliery and at a Campbeltown Town Council meeting on 13th August, Mr. Maisel, a director, said that gas could be got from a proposed coal distillation plant and bought by the town. A report to the shareholders stated that a testing plant of the Aicher low temperature carbonisation process had been in operation for a fortnight, under the supervision of Mr. Aicher. Tests gave yields of between 34½ and 74 gallons of crude oil per ton of coal [154–331 L/t or 37–79 US gal/short ton]. In addition 2350 cubic feet/ton [65.5 m/t or 2,100 cu ft/short ton] of gas and the residual coke were available from the process. In June 1929 the Franco British Company re-emerged as the Coal Carbonisation Trust and their prospectus mentioned carbonising 1,000 tons [1,016 t or 1120 short tons] of coal per day yielding 11 cwt of coke per ton [550 kg/t]. Almost immediately afterwards the pit at Kilkivan was abandoned and the whole project 'melted like snow aff a dyke'.\"\nIt seems that there was some concern about the company's conduct and a question was asked about the matter in Parliament on 14 February 1933.\n\nOn 9 August 1910 there was a fatal accident when a train being stabled in the Linecraigs engine sidings collided with an engine already in the sidings. A cleaner, G. Jamieson, engaged in cleaning the standing engine, was knocked down by his engine, run over, and killed. The cause of the accident was the irregular use of a key to unlock the electric token instruments. This practice was authorised by A. Black, the superintendent of the line. He stated at the Board of Trade Inquiry into the accident that the reason for this practice was a desire to save the expense connected with the wear of the batteries that supplied power to the tablet instruments. This was achieved by suspending tablet working until 9 o'clock in the morning, as, prior to that hour, there was only one engine in steam in use on the line, and the suspension of tablet working enabled the batteries to be overhauled and cleaned.\n\nR.Y. Pickering & Co. of Wishaw supplied four passenger bogie carriages for the line in 1906. Each carriage had a central saloon with wooden tramway style seating for 64 passengers and open end platforms. Two further carriages were supplied by Pickering in 1907, the second of which had a central luggage compartment.\n\nThe carriages survived the closure of the line and in 1934 were moved to Trench Point on the other side of Campbeltown Loch where they were used as holiday homes. During the Second World War they were used by the Admiralty. After the war they were left to deteriorate until the remaining underframes were finally scrapped in 1958.\n\nThere are six saloon coaches on the gauge Ravenglass & Eskdale Railway in Cumbria which are based on the exterior designs of the Campbeltown passenger stock, built in 1989 and 1990 for the Gateshead Garden Festival.\n\nThe colliery railway probably used mine tubs from the collieries' internal lines when it opened in 1876. By 1902, 18 four-wheeled flat wagons were in use, each of which carried four \"mine hutches\". The hutches were small mine tubs each of which carried of coal. The hutches were mounted transversely on short lengths of rail on the main railway wagons.\n\nWith the rebuilding of the colliery line in 1906 the opportunity was taken to replace the hutch carrying wagons with more conventional stock. A set of four-wheel open-sided coal wagons were purchased from Hurst Nelson & Co. Ltd. of Motherwell. Like the earlier colliery wagons, these had dumb buffers and centre couplings. Later batches of wagons were built to a design. In all the railway used approximately 150 coal wagons, all owned by the Campbeltown Coal Co. rather than the railway.\n\nIn addition to the coal wagons, the railway also had a small number of other freight stock, all owned by the railway company itself. A brake van was supplied by R.Y. Pickering. The same company supplied an open-sided milk wagon based on the design for the wagon but with open spars extending above the sides to provide extra support for carrying milk churns. Finally the railway had a detachable snow plough and a small platelayers' trolley for maintenance work.\n\nNone of the stations had platforms, however a small wooden shed with a corrugated iron roof was present at Machrihanish. The stations and halts were located at Campbeltown, Plantation Halt, Moss Road Halt, Lintmill Halt, Drumlemble Halt, Machrihanish Farm Halt, Trodigal Halt and Machrihanish.\n\n\n"}

As a member of the Patriots and inspired by the American Revolution, he wrote the noted pamphlet \"Aan het Volk van Nederland\" (\"To the People of the Netherlands\"), pleading for a more liberal society and the end of the Stadtholder regime, which had been marked by corruption and nepotism. He was also an ardent supporter of the legal recognition of the recently created United States of America.\n\nVan der Capellen became a member of the States of Overijssel in 1772. It was the beginning of his political career. He described himself as a \"born regent\", but that did not prevent him from being an ardent champion of the Enlightenment ideals and a critic of the Dutch Old Regime.\n\nFor that reason, his opponents compared Van der Capellen's public appearance with the style of the English politician John Wilkes. Wilkes criticized the policy of King George III and his ministers, but became very popular. This was partly due to his strategic use of the political press. The press also became a powerful weapon in the hands of Van der Capellen and his patriot friends.\n\nAs a member of the States Van der Capellen applied himself to the abolition of the so-called \"drostendiensten\", which compelled the farmers of Overijssel to labour for a pittance a few days every year for the local magistrate, the \"Drost\" (\"bailiff\"). This relic from medieval times was wrongfully applied in his opinion.\n\nIn an address to the States in 1778, he pointed out that these rights had been officially abolished in 1631. He ensured his statement was distributed widely and free of charge among the farmers in the Twenthe region. The reverend François Adriaan van der Kemp was his assistant or ghostwriter.\n\nIn the end he won his case but his fellow members in the States excluded him from participation in their deliberations until November 1782.\n\nPreviously, he had fallen foul of the Stadholder prince William V of Orange and the members of the States when he proclaimed himself against expansion of the army and the fleet. When in 1776 the British King George III asked the Dutch whether he could borrow the Scotch Brigade (a unit of Scots in Dutch service) to be deployed in the war with the American Republic, he voted against.\n\nHis overt support for the American revolutionaries was not appreciated either. Nevertheless, he continued to dedicate himself to the American War of Independence. He regarded the American struggle as an example for Dutch patriots.\n\nTo lend support to his views he translated \"Observations on Civil Liberty\" by the Welshman Richard Price into Dutch. The book was an important inspiration to the American revolutionaries. The Dutch translation was banned in 1789, together with other patriot writings.\n\nIn 1782 Van der Capellen arranged a loan for the American cause. A consortium was set up by Nicolaas van Staphorst and Wilhelm Willink. Eventually an amount of two hundred thousand guilders was raised. He contributed twenty thousand guilders himself.\n\nThe year 1781 was to be the most important in his political career. In that year a pamphlet appeared entitled \"\"Aan het Volk van Nederland\"\" (\"To the People of the Netherlands\").\n\nIn this anonymous pamphlet the disadvantages of the hereditary stadholderate were explained. It should be replaced by a democratic society, based on popular sovereignty. Within a month after publication the pamphlet was banned. Besides, a substantial reward was offered to whoever would report the author. In spite of these measures it was illegally reprinted and distributed three times, and even translated into French, English and German. It was to exert a lasting influence on the democratic movement in the Netherlands.\n\nVan der Capellen, the author of the pamphlet, was forced to enjoy its success in silence, as well as the fact that the authorities failed to identify him as the author. With unflagging zeal he continued to propagate the American cause. Partly thanks to his influence, John Adams and with him the young American Republic were recognized in 1782 by the States General.\n\nVan der Capellen died in 1784, though his influence and legacy continued to impact well beyond the grave. A few years later, Orangists blew up his monument in Goor.\n\nPolitician Pim Fortuyn (1948–2002) was deeply inspired by Van der Capellen. In 1992 Fortuyn wrote a \"\"To the people of the Netherlands\"\" too and declared himself as the successor of Van der Capellen who has to struggle against the political elite of his time.\nIn 2015, the so-called Burgerforum-EU published another \"\"To the people of the Netherlands\"\", a pamphlet against the European Union. Dutch intellectual Thierry Baudet wrote the preface of this booklet.\n\n"}

In 2015, however, the sitting MP Ian Swales did not seek re-election, and Labour regained the seat on another huge swing of 18.9% away from the Liberal Democrats, who polled just ahead of UKIP with the Conservatives in fourth. In 2019, the seat was one of a number of long standing Labour seats in the north of England which fell to the Conservatives.\n\nThe constituency had a slightly higher unemployment at the end of 2012 than the North-East average.

When he was consul-general in Vienna during World War II, he risked his life and career to save \"perhaps tens of thousands\" Jews by issuing them visas, disobeying the instruction of his superiors. It is known that Ho issued the 200th visa in June 1938, signed the 1906th visa on 27 October 1938, and was recalled to China in May 1940. Ho died in 1997 and his actions were recognized posthumously when the Israeli organization Yad Vashem in 2000 decided to award him the title \"Righteous Among the Nations\".\n\nHo Feng-Shan was born on 10 September 1901 in Yiyang, Hunan Province, China. His father died when Ho was 7 years old. A diligent and hard-working student, he managed to enter the Yali School in the provincial capital of Changsha and later Yale-in-China University. He attended the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich in 1929 and received his doctorate in political economics in 1932.\n\nIn 1935, Ho started his diplomatic career within the Foreign Ministry of the Republic of China. His first posting was in Turkey. He was appointed First Secretary at the Chinese legation in Vienna in 1937. When Austria was annexed by Nazi Germany in 1938, and the legation was turned into a consulate, Ho was assigned the post of Consul-General.\n\nAfter the \"Kristallnacht\" in 1938, the situation became rapidly more difficult for the almost 200,000 Austrian Jews. The only way for Jews to escape from Nazism was to leave Europe. In order to leave, they had to provide proof of emigration, usually a visa from a foreign nation, or a valid boat ticket. This was difficult, however, because at the 1938 Évian Conference 31 countries (out of a total of 32, which included Canada, Australia, and New Zealand) refused to accept Jewish immigrants. The only country willing to accept Jews was the Dominican Republic, which offered to accept up to 100,000 refugees. Acting against the orders of his superior Chen Jie (), the Chinese ambassador to Berlin, Ho started to issue visas, for humanitarian reasons, to Shanghai, part of which during this time was still under the control of the Republic of China. Twelve hundred visas were issued by Ho in only the first three months of holding office as Consul-General.\n\nAt the time it was not necessary to have a visa to enter Shanghai, but the visas allowed the Jews to leave Austria. Many Jewish families left for Shanghai, whence most of them would later leave for Hong Kong and Australia. Ho continued to issue these visas until he was ordered to return to China in May 1940. The exact number of visas given by Ho to Jewish refugees is unknown. It is known that Ho issued the 200th visa in June 1938, and signed the 1906th visa on 27 October 1938. How many Jews were saved through his actions is unknown, but given that Ho issued nearly 2,000 visas only during his first half year at his post, the number may be in the thousands.\n\nAfter the Communist victory in 1949, Ho followed the Nationalist government to Taiwan. He later served as the ambassador from Republic of China (Taiwan) to other countries, including to Egypt, Mexico, Bolivia, and Colombia. After his retirement in 1973, Ho settled in San Francisco, California, where he wrote his memoirs, \"My Forty Years as a Diplomat\" () published in 1990 (English translation 2010).\n\nAfter his retirement in 1973, the government of Taiwan denied Ho a pension on the grounds, common then, that he had been subpoenaed and refused to cooperate with Diplomatic Services, and had not properly accounted for a small sum in an embassy expense account. These charges are now widely believed to have been politically motivated. The ROC government has never exonerated him as there were many diplomats leaving their posts without authorization. He did not report to work and he was terminated without a pension. This was the policy when tens of embassies were closed. He returned to his native China and visited his alma mater in Changsha for the school's 80th anniversary in 1986. A shadow was cast over his later years by impeachment by Taipei's Committee on the Discipline of Public Functionaries for having allegedly misappropriated funds when ambassador to Colombia in 1970, charges which he claimed were concocted by a subordinate he had refused to recommend for promotion. However, on 10 September 2015, President Ma Ying-jeou in Taipei commended Dr. Ho for his service and presented his daughter a certificate of appreciation with Israeli government representatives.\n\nHo Feng-Shan died on 28 September 1997 in San Francisco, California, at the age of 96. He was survived by his son, Monto Ho (何曼德, 1927-2013), a Chinese-American professional in microbiology, virology, and infectious diseases; and by his daughter, Manli Ho ().\n\nHo's actions in Vienna went unnoticed during his lifetime, save for a black mark in his personnel file for disobeying orders. They were finally recognized, posthumously, when he was awarded the title Righteous Among the Nations by the Israeli organization Yad Vashem at a ceremony in 2001 and honored by Boys Town Jerusalem in 2004. In 2015, his daughter represented her father to receive a meritorious certificate for his diplomatic services presented by the ROC government, with participation of representatives from Israel.\n\n"}

Thornaby was enveloped into Teesside County Borough from 1974 and has not been part of the associated seats otherwise.\n\nThe seat was recreated on similar boundaries to those which existed immediately before 1918.\n\nThe 2015 result made the seat the 36-safest of Labour's 232 seats by percentage of majority.\n\nSince the constituency's re-creation in 1974, Middlesbrough has elected the Labour Party's candidate as its MP. In areas formerly part of Middlesbrough East, the MP has been Labour since 1950.\n\nMiddlesbrough West took in rural and semi-rural areas outside the borough to the west, and was a marginal seat passing three times between the two largest parties after the Second World War, but a Liberal stronghold from 1918 until 1945; former soldier and iron and steel merchant Trevelyan Thomson ran unopposed at the polls for re-election in 1924.\n\nThe 2012 by-election and 2015 general election saw UKIP finish second. The Liberal Democrats fielded second-placed candidates in 2005 and 2010. The Conservatives did in all elections between the seat's revival and 2001, and returned to second place in 2017.

It suffers high unemployment and its adult population has mostly a low income; however, with modern advanced engineering, design and tourism, the city forms with nearby Redcar a bellwether for the North East region's economy firmly in the British forefront of a determined return to increasing national output. In November 2012, male and female unemployment (based on the more up-to-date claimant statistics) placed Middlesbrough topmost of 29 constituencies in the region, well ahead for example the City of Durham at the bottom of the list, with just 3.4% claimants whereas this area had 9.4% claimants.\n\nIn terms of housing stock, the authority is one of few authorities to see the proportion of detached and semi-detached homes increase (to 13.6% and 39.9%), in this instance this was coupled with a similar rise in flats to 11.9%, all at a loss to the share of terraced properties, down 4.7%.\n\nThe film \"ToryBoy The Movie\" followed the election, directed by and starring John Walsh who documented how he became a candidate for the Conservative Party in Middlesbrough, challenging the sitting MP, Stuart Bell. The following year, the \"Daily Mail\" claimed that long-term sitting MP Bell had not held a constituency surgery since 1997. Later in 2011, Neil Macfarlane, in a report for local newspaper\"Teesside Gazette\", asked \"Are Teessiders getting enough from Sir Stuart Bell?\" when he failed to answer over one hundred telephone calls made to his constituency office over a three-month period. The \"Gazette\" story was picked up by national newspapers. \"The Independent\" asked \"is Sir Stuart Bell Britain's laziest MP?\" The \"Guardian\" fact-checked the \"laziest MP\" claims and found that was false. The Labour Party said it was looking into the allegations. Bell later said that he had stopped surgeries after being assaulted, and was willing to meet constituents \"by appointment\". He stated that he would discuss the matter with Labour Chief Whip Rosie Winterton, and would be writing to Labour Party leader Ed Miliband to explain his circumstances.\n\nGeneral Election 1914/15:\n\nA General Election was required to take place before the end of 1915.

{"id": "1820472", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1820472", "title": "City of Durham (UK Parliament constituency)", "text": "City of Durham (UK Parliament constituency)\n\nCity of Durham is a constituency represented in the House of Commons of the UK Parliament since 2019 by Mary Foy of the Labour Party.\n\nThe constituency contains a large minority of students, researchers and academics at the early 19th century founded University of Durham, that has a claim towards being the third oldest in England and has elected Labour MPs since 1935, although there have been strong SDP–Liberal Alliance and Liberal Democrat challenges to Labour since the 1980s.\n\nThe City of Durham was first given the right to return Members to Parliament by an Act of Parliament in 1678, the last new borough but one to be enfranchised before the Great Reform Act of 1832. It was the only borough in County Durham, the county also having been unrepresented until the same Act of Parliament, which created two MPs for the county and two for the city. Both constituencies were frequently referred to simply as Durham, which can make for some confusion.\n\nThe constituency as constituted in 1678 consisted only of the city of Durham itself, though this included its suburbs which were within the municipal boundary. The right to vote was held by the corporation and the freemen of the city, many of whom were not resident within the boundaries. Unlike the situation in many small rotten boroughs, the corporation had no jurisdiction over the creation of freemen: freemen were generally created by connection with companies of trade, either by apprenticeship or by birth (by being the son of an existing freeman), though the common council of the city had a power to create honorary freemen.\n\nThe creation of honorary freemen with the specific intention of swaying elections was a common abuse in a number of boroughs in the 18th century, and at the Durham election of 1762 became sufficiently controversial to force a change in the law. The election was disputed because 215 new freemen, most of them not resident in the city, had been made after the writ for the election was issued. The existing freemen petitioned against this dilution of their voting rights, the candidate who had been declared elected was unseated by the Commons committee which heard the case, and the following year an Act of Parliament was passed to prevent any honorary freeman from voting in a borough election within twelve months of their being accorded that status.\n\nThrough having a freeman franchise the electorate was comparatively numerous for the period, though comprising only a small fraction of the city's population; at the time of the Reform Act there were between 1,100 and 1,200 freemen in total, of whom 427 were resident and 558 lived within seven miles, while the total population of the borough was 9,269. The Lambton and Tempest families were influential, and were generally able to secure election, but fell far short of the sort of control common in pocket boroughs.\n\nThe city retained both its MPs under the 1832 Reform Act, with its boundaries adjusted only very slightly, although as elsewhere the franchise was reformed. The Reform Act 1867 extended the boundaries to include part of Framwellgate parish which had previously been excluded. Under the Redistribution of Seats Act 1885, the borough's representation was reduced from the 1885 general election to a single MP. In the boundary changes of 1918, the borough was abolished, but a division of County Durham was named after the City.\n\nFrom 1918, Durham City was included in a county constituency officially called The Durham Division of (County) Durham, consisting of the central part of the county. In the 1983 boundary changes, the constituency officially acquired the unambiguous City of Durham name for the first time and its boundaries were realigned to match the new City of Durham local government district.\n\n\nThe constituency corresponds to the former City of Durham local government district and as such includes a number of surrounding villages and suburbs as well as Durham itself, the largest of these are Brandon, Coxhoe, Bowburn, Framwellgate Moor, Sherburn and Ushaw Moor. The seat extends as far west as Waterhouses and as far east as Ludworth. The seat has traditionally been dominated by Labour, with support particularly strong in those villages historically connected to County Durham's mining industry. Durham is famous as an educational centre, for Durham University and the feepaying preparatory school, Chorister School where Tony Blair was educated. The city centre is more inclined to the Liberal Democrats. Like many other university cities such as Cambridge and Oxford, in the 2005 election it swung strongly towards the Liberal Democrats, one possible reason being these cities' sizeable student population who were viewed as being hostile to Labour's policies on areas such as top-up fees and the Iraq War. The Liberal Democrats were able to reduce Labour's majority by over 10,000 votes, although they were still unable to gain the seat from Labour, as was the case in the 2010 election.\n\nFollowing a review of parliamentary representation in County Durham, the Boundary Commission for England has made no changes to the City of Durham constituency, which will remain co-terminous with the boundaries of the former district. The City of Durham local council was abolished in the 2009 structural changes to local government in England.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

During the first creation, Liberals represented the area and the first member until 1914 was the son of a prominent Chartist, Ernest Jones, and helped to promote New Liberalism, encouraging the Liberal Party to take on instead the politics of \"mass working-class\" appeal.

The previous MP was Laura Pidcock, who was elected at the 2017 general election. Prior to that, the constituency was served by Pat Glass who announced her intention to step down at the 2017 general election in the wake of the Brexit referendum. Her successor, Laura Pidcock a close supporter of party leader Jeremy Corbyn lost the seat in 2019 general election to the current MP, Richard Holden, as part of the Conservative Party's strategy to target seats in the so-called red wall.\n\n<section begin=\"General Election 1992\"/>\n\n<section end=\"General Election 1992\"/>\n\n\n\n"}

The result was furniture that was sophisticated, yet mainstream and very successful.\n\nWormley's inclusion in the Good Design Exhibitions staged by the Museum of Modern Art and the Merchandise Mart between 1950 and 1955 elevated him to a respected place alongside more cutting edge designers like Bertoia, Nelson and Eames.

{"id": "1820506", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1820506", "title": "David Ray Griffin", "text": "David Ray Griffin\n\nDavid Ray Griffin (born August 8, 1939 in Wilbur, Washington) is a retired American professor of philosophy of religion and theology, and a political writer. Along with John B. Cobb, Jr., he founded the Center for Process Studies in 1973, a research center of Claremont School of Theology that seeks to promote the common good by means of the relational approach found in process thought. Griffin has published many books about the September 11 attacks suggesting the validity of the 9/11 conspiracy theory that elements of the United States government were involved.\n\nDavid Ray Griffin is a longtime resident of Santa Barbara, California, and was a full-time academic from 1973 until April 2004. He is currently a co-director of the Center for Process Studies and is a contemporary exponent of process theology, founded on the process philosophy of Alfred North Whitehead and Charles Hartshorne.\n\nGriffin was raised in a small town in Oregon, where he was an active participant in his Disciples of Christ church. After deciding to become a minister, Griffin entered Northwest Christian College but became disenchanted with the conservative-fundamentalist theology taught there. While pursuing his master's degree in counseling from the University of Oregon, Griffin attended a lecture series delivered by Paul Tillich at the Graduate Theological Union in Berkeley, California. At that time, Griffin decided to focus on philosophical theology. He eventually attended the Claremont Graduate University, from which Griffin received his PhD in 1970.\n\nAs a student in Claremont, Griffin was initially interested in Eastern religions, particularly Vedanta. However, he started to become a process theologian while attending John B. Cobb's seminar on Whitehead's philosophy. According to Griffin, process theology, as presented by Cobb, \"provided a way between the old supernaturalism, according to which God miraculously interrupted the normal causal processes now and then, and a view according to which God is something like a cosmic hydraulic jack, exerting the same pressure always and everywhere (which described rather aptly the position to which I had come)\" (\"Primordial Truth and Postmodern Theology\"). Griffin applied Whitehead's thought to the traditional theological subjects of christology and theodicy and argued that process theology also provided a sound basis for addressing contemporary social and ecological issues.\n\nAfter teaching theology and Eastern religions at the University of Dayton, Griffin came to appreciate the distinctively postmodern aspects of Whitehead's thought. In particular, Griffin found Whitehead's nonsensationist epistemology and panexperientialist ontology immensely helpful in addressing the major problems of modern philosophy, including the problems of mind-body interaction, the interaction between free and determined things, the emergence of experience from nonexperiencing matter, and the emergence of time in the evolutionary process. In 1973, Griffin returned to Claremont to establish, with Cobb, the Center for Process Studies at the Claremont School of Theology.\n\nWhile on research leave in 1980–81 at Cambridge University and Berkeley, the contrast between modernity and postmodernity became central to his work. Many of Griffin's writings are devoted to developing postmodern proposals for overcoming the conflicts between religion and modern science. Griffin came to believe that much of the tension between religion and science was not only the result of reactionary supernaturalism but also the mechanistic worldview associated with the rise of modern science in the seventeenth century. In 1983, Griffin started the Center for a Postmodern World in Santa Barbara and became editor of the SUNY Series in Constructive Postmodern Philosophy between 1987 and 2004.\n\nFollowing the September 11 attacks, David Ray Griffin moved his focus from questions of philosophy and religion to ones of politics and history, specifically American expansionism and imperialism. He intended to write a book on the subject, presenting 9/11 in terms of \"blowback\" for aggressive United States foreign policies of the 20th century:\n\nUntil the spring of 2003, I had not looked at any of the evidence. I was vaguely aware there were people, at least on the internet, who were offering evidence against the official account of 9/11... I knew the US government had 'fabricated' evidence to go to war several times before. Nevertheless... I did not take this possibility seriously... I was so confident that they must be wrong.\n\nAfter reading the work of Paul Thompson and Nafeez Mosaddeq Ahmed, he became convinced that there was a \"prima facie\" case for the contention that there must have been complicity from individuals within the United States government. He has called for an extensive investigation from the United States media, Congress and the 9/11 Commission. At this time, he set about writing his first book on the topic, which he entitled \"The New Pearl Harbor: Disturbing Questions About the Bush Administration and 9/11\" (2004).\n\nPart One of the book looks at the events of 9/11, discussing each flight in turn and also the behaviour of President George W. Bush and his Secret Service protection. Part Two examines 9/11 in a wider context, in the form of four \"disturbing questions.\" David Ray Griffin discussed this book and the claims within it in an interview with Nick Welsh, reported under the headline \"Thinking Unthinkable Thoughts: Theologian Charges White House Complicity in 9/11 Attack\".\n\nCritics of Griffin's thesis, such as the activist Chip Berlet, have said that many of the claims in the book are refutable. Griffin has rejected these criticisms and debated Berlet.\n\nGriffin's second book on the subject was a critique of the 9/11 Commission Report, called \"The 9/11 Commission Report: Omissions And Distortions\" (2005). Griffin's article \"The 9/11 Commission Report: A 571-page Lie\" summarizes this book, presenting 115 alleged instances of either omissions or distortions of evidence he says are in the report, stating that \"the entire Report is constructed in support of one big lie: that the official story about 9/11 is true.\"\n\nIn his next book, \"Christian Faith and the Truth Behind 9/11: A Call to Reflection and Action\" (2006), he summarizes some of what he believes is evidence for government complicity and reflects on its implications for Christians. The Presbyterian Publishing Corporation, publishers of the book, described Griffin as being a distinguished theologian and praised the book's religious content, but said, \"The board believes the conspiracy theory is spurious and based on questionable research.\"\n\nIn 2006, Griffin, along with Peter Dale Scott, edited \"9/11 and the American Empire: Intellectuals Speak Out\", a collection of essays including Steven Jones' paper \"Why Indeed Did The World Trade Center Towers Collapse?\". \"Debunking 9/11 Debunking\" (2007) looks at the way mainstream media such as \"Popular Mechanics\" have sought to debunk the alternative 9/11 theories and the tactics he claims they employ to persuade the reader that they have done so. In \"9/11 Contradictions: An Open Letter to Congress and the Press\" (2008), he presents chapters on 25 alleged contradictions involving elements of the \"accepted story\" of 9/11 and calls for Congress and the press to investigate and resolve them.\n\nDavid Ray Griffin has delivered several lectures and has been interviewed by Alex Jones on his radio show espousing 9/11 conspiracy theories. A lecture entitled \"9/11 and American Empire: How should religious people respond?\", delivered on April 18, 2005, at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, was aired by C-SPAN. At the end of one of his lectures entitled \"9/11: The Myth and the Reality\" Griffin was asked why a theologian would take such an interest in 9/11, to which he replied: \"If 9/11 is not a religious issue, then I don't know what is.\"\n\nIn a review published in \"The Nation\", former Central Intelligence Agency agent Robert Baer dismissed the gist of Griffin's writings as one in a long line of conspiracy theories about national tragedies but stated that the Bush administration had created a climate of secrecy and mistrust that helped generate such explanations. In the review, Baer said:\n\nAs more facts emerge about September 11, many of Griffin's questions should be answered, but his suspicions will never be put to rest as long as the Bush Administration refuses to explain why it dragged this country into the most senseless war in its history. Until then, otherwise reasonable Americans will believe the Bush Administration benefited from 9/11, and there will always be a question about what really happened on that day.\n\n\n\n\n"}

He joined the Manchester United ground staff as a 15-year-old and made his way up through the club's ranks before an arthritic condition in his knees forced him to retire from playing at the age of 26.\n\nBorn in Aberdeen, Fitzpatrick started his football career with a local youth club, Thistle Lads' Club, before being spotted by Manchester United scouts in September 1961. He was invited to Old Trafford for trials, but before the move to Manchester, he asked to play one last match for his old club; during the match, however, he broke his leg, which delayed him signing apprentice forms with Manchester United until July 1962. In the meantime, he worked as a member of the club's ground staff. He turned professional in September 1963.\n\nAfter being part of the team that won the FA Youth Cup in April 1964, which also included the likes of John Aston, David Sadler and George Best, Fitzpatrick made his professional debut at the age of 18 in February 1965, filling in for the injured Nobby Stiles at left-half in a 1–0 away defeat to Sunderland. On 16 October 1965, he became Manchester United's first ever substitute in a Football League match, coming on for Denis Law in a 5–1 away defeat against Tottenham Hotspur. He made only sporadic appearances over the next two seasons, exclusively as a wing-half, where his opportunities were limited by the consistently good performances of Stiles and Pat Crerand. The 1967–68 season saw him make more regular appearances in a variety of positions, including in the forward line, but it was not until February 1969 that he found his ultimate position as a right-sided full-back, filling in for the injured Shay Brennan; his season came to a slightly premature end, however, when he was sent off in the first leg of the European Cup semi-final against Milan, following which he had to have a police escort to the changing rooms. The incident resulted in Fitzpatrick receiving an eight-week suspension. Earlier in the season, he scored his first professional goals, hitting two in a 3–1 league win at home to Tottenham.\n\nFitzpatrick retained his place in the side at the start of the 1969–70 season, but an injury suffered against Tottenham on 22 November 1969 ruled him out for the next four months. He recovered to play in the last seven matches of the season, and following the departure of Brennan to become player-manager at Waterford United, he was almost ever-present in 1970–71, missing only seven league matches. However, he managed just one appearance in 1971–72, following a recurrence of the knee cartilage problem he had suffered two years earlier, which subsequently required four operations to correct. Although he was able to return for the start of the 1972–73 season, he lasted just six matches in the first team and another two in the reserves before doctors advised him to retire, bringing to an end a career that had seen him make almost 150 appearances, in which he had scored 10 goals. In recognition of his nine years of service to the club, Manchester United presented Fitzpatrick with a cheque for £20,000, as well as organising a cabaret dinner in his honour, which raised a further £1,000.\n\nAfter retiring, he returned to his home town of Aberdeen, where he went into business as a wine importer.\n\nBibliography\n\nFootnotes\n"}

It presents the authors' choices for the 50 worst sound films ever made. Each film's entry includes a story synopsis, the authors' opinions of its quality, and a selection of contemporary reviews of the film.\n\nIn compiling their list, the authors divided films under a few categories: \"Popular Triumphs\" like \"The Omen\", \"Valley of the Dolls\"; \"Overrated Art Films\" like \"Ivan the Terrible\", \"Last Year at Marienbad\"; \"Implausible Oddities\" like \"The Terror of Tiny Town\"; \"Big Budget Flops\" like \"Lost Horizon\", \"Zabriskie Point\"; \"Grade-Z Atrocities\" like \"Robot Monster\", \"Eegah\"; \"Tarnished Stars\" such as Yul Brynner in \"Solomon and Sheba\"; \"Oldies but Baddies\" like \"Jamaica Inn\". The authors also used egregious examples to represent less reputable film genres, such as blaxploitation films (\"Trouble Man\"), Japanese monster movies (\"Godzilla vs. Hedorah\"), Spaghetti Westerns (\"Return of Sabata\") and jungle movies (\"Daughter of the Jungle\"). Also included in the book are examples of anime (\"Alakazam the Great\"), disaster movies (\"Airport 1975\"), sexploitation films (\"Myra Breckinridge\"), Elvis Presley vehicles (\"Spinout\"), and mainstream films like \"At Long Last Love\", \"Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia\", \"Hurry Sundown\", \"King Richard and the Crusaders\", \"Say One for Me\".\n\nThe book intentionally excludes silent films because the authors consider them to be \"a separate and unique art form and that judging them alongside talkies would be like weighing apples together with oranges\". It limits the foreign films considered to only those distributed in the United States, judging it unfair to evaluate local obscurities denied an international release alongside mainstream Hollywood products, while realizing that it would not only be difficult for the authors to view the films, but unlikely that any readers would ever come across them.\n\nThe Medveds continued the theme of \"celebrating\" bad cinema with the publication \"The Golden Turkey Awards\", instituted in 1980 which again showcased bad and obscure films, and \"The Hollywood Hall of Shame\" which examined in some detail several major Hollywood financial disasters, focusing on both the artistic treatments coupled with the technical and organizational ineptitude in the mounting of these films.\n\nIt has been said that \"The Fifty Worst Films of All Time\" marked the beginning of an explosion of \"worst in cinema\" prizes nearly resulting in \"a state of redundancy almost approaching that of ordinary prizes.\"\n\n\n\n"}

In the first attack, however, three bystanders were killed. Neither sophisticated methods nor sophisticated materials were used in the incidents, and the Egyptian authorities have consistently described the attacks as \"primitive\". \n\nOn Thursday, 7 April 2005, a suicide bomber detonated an explosive device on Sharia al-Moski in Islamic Cairo, near the al-Hussein Mosque and Khan el-Khalili, a major souq popular with tourists and Egyptians alike. Three foreign tourists (two French and one American) were killed, and 11 Egyptians and seven other overseas visitors were injured.\n\nEgyptian police identified the bomber as Muhammad Sobhi Ali Jidan, originally from Qalyubia Governorate in northern Egypt, but then living in the north Cairo district of Shobra.\n\nThe first of a number of attacks on Saturday, 30 April took place at 15h15 Egypt summer time (12h15 UTC) in a city bus station located in a 300-metre-wide concourse between the Ramses Hilton Hotel and the Egyptian Museum near Cairo's main traffic intersection.\n\nEhab Yousri Yassin, an Egyptian man suspected of involvement in the 7 April attack, was being pursued along the Sixth of October Bridge, a flyover leading into centre of Cairo from the River Nile island of Gezira. He apparently leapt from the bridge down into the bus station below, with a \nnail bomb that he was carrying detonating as he fell. \nThe bomber was killed and seven passersby were injured: three Egyptians and four foreign tourists (an Israeli couple, an Italian woman, and a Swedish).\n\nApproximately two hours later the same day, two veiled females armed with guns opened fire on a tourist bus in the neighbourhood known as Islamic Cairo, not far from the Citadel. After firing on the coach, one of the women shot the other dead before turning her gun on herself. Three bystanders were reportedly injured. \n\nPolice sources later revealed that the women were Negat Yassin, Ehab Yousri Yassin's sister, and Iman Ibrahim Khamis, his wife (described as his fiancée in some early reports). This was the first attack in modern Egyptian history to be carried out by women; police believe it arose from a spur of the moment decision taken by the women upon learning of the Sixth of October Bridge incident.\n\nTwo groups claimed responsibility in the early evening hours, local time: \nthe Mujahedeen of Egypt and the Abdullah Azzam Brigades. \nIn its statement, the latter group said the attacks were in retaliation for the government's clampdown on dissidents in the wake of the Sinai Peninsula bombings of October 2004. \n\nIn the early hours of Sunday, 1 May, security forces arrested some 225 individuals for questioning, mostly from the dead three's home villages and from the area where they lived in Shubra. Particularly keenly sought was Muhammad Yassin, the teenage brother of Ehab Yousri Yassin, whom the police described as the only remaining suspect in the bazaar bomb attack and a material witness to the Saturday afternoon shooting. Muhammad was later extradited from Libya.\n\nOver the course of the weekend, it also emerged that all three of the attackers involved in the attacks were relatives of Ashraf Said, a suspect in the 7 April bombing who was taken in for questioning and died in police custody on Friday, 29 April.\n\nOn August 20, 2007, four suspects were sentenced to life in prison for their role in the attacks. Five others received shorter jail sentences.\nOn March 9, 2007, one of the American victims published a book (The Only Road North) of his party's exploits in Africa which culminates in the tragic events of April 7, 2005.\n\n\n"}

Such elements usually appear peripherally (at the beginning or end of the sentence) and are set off from the rest of the sentence by a comma (in writing) and a pause (in speech).\n\nHere are some examples (note: the disjuncts that follow are 'sentence adverbs'):\nG. (Meaning \"I'm honest when I say I didn't do it\" rather than \"I didn't do it in an honest way.\")\n\nSometimes, the same word or phrase can be interpreted either as a disjunct or as a simple adjunct:\n\nAn example of a sentence adverb modifying a sentence is: \"Unfortunately, when I got to the supermarket it had run out of the vegetable I like.\" An example of a sentence adverb modifying a clause within a sentence is: \"I liked the red car in the forecourt, but unfortunately, when I got to the dealer it was already sold.\"\n\n\"Unfortunately\" thus communicates the regret or disappointment the speaker experiences and so manifests as a sentence adverb the sentiments of the speaker.\n\n\"Unfortunately\", however, is only one of many sentence adverbs that can modify a speaker's attitude. Others include \"mercifully,\" \"gratefully,\" \"oddly,\" \"admittedly,\" etc.\n\n\"Hopefully\" is an example of a word whose use as a disjunct (\"it is hoped\") is sometimes controversial.\n\nThis commonly used sentence adverbial phrase has been decried by some grammarians. Examples of its use, from the OED, are: \n\nWriters have claimed that the preferable phrase should be \"more (or most) important\". For instance, Washington State University English professor Paul Brians writes:When speakers are trying to impress audiences with their rhetoric, they often seem to feel that the extra syllable in “importantly” lends weight to their remarks: “and more importantly, I have an abiding love for the American people.” However, these pompous speakers are wrong. It is rarely correct to use this form of the phrase because it is seldom adverbial in intention. Say “more important” instead. The same applies to “most importantly”; it should be “most important.”\nHowever, Merriam-Webster write:American commentators seem to object to the adverb and recommend the adjective. and, after discussion, conclude You can then use either the adjective or the adverb; both are defensible grammatically and both are in respectable use.\n"}

Born in Swinton, Lanarkshire, he played for Partick Thistle, Manchester United, Rangers, Motherwell, Hamilton Academical, Queen of the South and Blantyre Victoria.\n\nForsyth began his football career in 1967 as a member of the Arsenal ground staff. However, he was released at the end of the season and returned to Scotland, where he signed for Partick Thistle. In 1971, Forsyth was a member of the Thistle team that won both the Scottish First Division and the Scottish League Cup, beating Celtic 4–1 in the final on 23 October 1971. His performances during the 1971–72 season earned him a selection for the Scottish League XI for their game against The Football League XI on 15 March 1972, and also attracted the eye of Scotland manager Tommy Docherty, who gave Forsyth his first cap against Yugoslavia on 29 June 1972. He continued in the Scotland team for three more matches that year, ultimately earning a total of 10 caps. He also played once for the Scotland Under-23s against Wales Under-23s in February 1974.\n\nWhen Manchester United hired Docherty to replace Frank O'Farrell as their manager in December 1972, Forsyth was one of several Scottish players signed by Docherty, costing the club £100,000. He made his debut at left-back in a 3–1 defeat away to his former club, Arsenal, on 6 January 1973. He then played in a further eight consecutive matches – including a 1–0 away defeat to Wolverhampton Wanderers in the third round of the FA Cup – before losing his place to Steve James following a 3–1 loss to Birmingham City on 10 March.\n\nForsyth made only sporadic appearances in the first half of the 1973–74 season, but became a regular in the team from the middle of January 1974, mostly playing at right-back. He scored his first goal for the club in a 3–3 home draw with Burnley on 3 April 1974, but he was unable to prevent the team from finishing second from the bottom of the First Division and suffering relegation to the Second Division. He continued as a regular in the first team in 1974–75, missing only six matches all season as the team won the Second Division and regained their place in the top flight, as well as reaching the semi-finals of the League Cup. His only goal of the season came in a 3–0 away win over Blackpool on 19 October.\n\nThe emergence of Jimmy Nicholl at right-back in 1975–76 meant that Forsyth missed all of September, October and November 1975, but he regained his place in the team from December onwards, playing in every game until the end of the season, including Manchester United's run to the 1976 FA Cup Final. He scored three times during the 1975–76 season, the first two in consecutive 3–1 home wins at the end of January (in the FA Cup against Peterborough United and in the league against Birmingham City) and the other in a 4–0 home win over West Ham United at the end of February.\n\nDespite this consistent run in the team, Forsyth was dropped to the reserves in place of Nicholl for the start of the 1976–77 season, and he made just five appearances all season, including a three-game spell between 27 November and 18 December 1976. He then came on as a substitute in a 4–0 away defeat to Queens Park Rangers on 19 April 1977 before finishing his season by starting in a 1–0 away defeat to Liverpool on 3 May. He made only four appearances in 1977–78, and at the end of the season, he was allowed to join Rangers, initially on loan before the transfer was made permanent in August 1979.\n\nHe later played for Motherwell, Hamilton Academical and Queen of the South, before ending his career with Scottish Junior Football Association club Blantyre Victoria.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1820525", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1820525", "title": "Sunday, Cruddy Sunday", "text": "Sunday, Cruddy Sunday\n\n\"Sunday, Cruddy Sunday\" is the twelfth episode of \"The Simpsons\" tenth season. It first aired on the Fox network in the United States on January 31, 1999, just after Super Bowl XXXIII and the premiere of \"Family Guy\". In the episode, while buying new tires for his car, Homer meets a travel agent called Wally Kogen. After becoming friends, Kogen offers Homer a free bus ride to the Super Bowl, as long as he can find enough people to fill Kogen's bus. Several people, including Bart, tag along what soon becomes a problematic trip. Meanwhile, Marge and Lisa set out to find the missing parts of \"Vincent Price's Egg Magic\", a celebrity-endorsed craft kit.\n\n\"Sunday, Cruddy Sunday\" was directed by Steven Dean Moore and written by George Meyer, Brian Scully, Mike Scully and Tom Martin, the first credit Martin received for the series. Mike Scully jokingly said that the episode was \"thrown together[...] without thought or structure\" by the writers. For the subplot, the writers tried to come up with the \"most boring thing\" Lisa and Marge could do to pass time. The episode features several guest-stars, including comedian Fred Willard, country singer Dolly Parton, Fox CEO Rupert Murdoch, sports commentators Pat Summerall and John Madden, and former American football players Troy Aikman, Rosey Grier and Dan Marino. All guest-stars played themselves, except for Willard who portrayed Kogen. The episode pokes fun at folk singer Burl Ives, former United States president Bill Clinton as well as the series' fans, among other things.\n\nIn its original broadcast, the episode was seen by approximately 11.5 million viewers, making it the tenth most watched program of the week as well as the second most watched scripted program on the network the night it aired. The episode was released on home video for the first time in 2004, and in 2007, the episode was again released as part of the DVD set \"The Simpsons – The Complete Tenth Season\". Following its broadcast, the episode received mostly positive reviews from critics.\n\nAfter its original broadcast, however, a scene in the episode involving a fictitious, sexually suggestive Super Bowl commercial for the Catholic Church became a subject of controversy. The scene garnered scrutiny from the American Catholic anti-defamation and civil rights organization The Catholic League, whose members sent hundreds of angry letters to the Fox network, demanding any mention of Catholicism in the episode be excised. In September the same year, when the episode was supposed to repeat, the Catholic League asked Fox if they could censor the scene, which the network agreed to. The network's decision was criticized by journalists and staff members. The censored version of the episode is still in syndication. \n\nWhen Bart, Lisa and the students of Springfield Elementary go on a field trip to the post office, Bart gets a coupon book as a souvenir, which he gives to Homer as a birthday present. Homer uses one of his coupons for a free wheel balancing at a tire shop, but is conned into buying four new tires for his car. While waiting for the installation, Homer meets Wally Kogen, a travel agent. The two watch a special on the Super Bowl while drinking at Moe's, and Wally explains that his agency is sending a charter bus to the game. To get free seats for himself and Bart, Homer helps Wally fill the bus by persuading many prominent male citizens of Springfield to sign up.\n\nHomer, Bart, and the men arrive at Miami's Pro Player Stadium for pre-game festivities, only to discover that Wally has bought counterfeit tickets. They try to sneak in, but are caught and detained in a cell, where they vent their frustration on Homer. After Dolly Parton - a friend of Wally's and one of the halftime entertainers - breaks them out, they make their way into a skybox suite and spend more time gorging themselves on free food and drinks than they do watching the game. Confronted by the box's owner, Rupert Murdoch, the group flees toward the field but is promptly swept into the locker room by the victorious Denver Broncos. They share in the celebration, with Homer taking a congratulatory phone call from Bill Clinton, and several of the men wind up with Super Bowl rings as they board the bus to return to Springfield.\n\nMeanwhile, Marge and Lisa find a 1960s-era egg decorating kit endorsed by Vincent Price and decide to use it. When the kit proves to have no feet for the egg, Marge calls the company's help line and finds herself listening to Price on a voice mail greeting. As Homer's group leaves Miami, Pat Summerall and John Madden analyze the events of the episode, their initially favorable opinion quickly souring. They board a bus driven by Price, who has trouble shifting gears properly.\n\n\"Sunday, Cruddy Sunday\" was directed by Steven Dean Moore and co-written by former staff writers Tom Martin, George Meyer, Brian Scully, and executive producer and former showrunner Mike Scully. It was first broadcast on the Fox network in the United States on January 31, 1999, right after Super Bowl XXXIII and the premiere of \"Family Guy\". \"Sunday, Cruddy Sunday\" was the first episode that Martin received a writing credit for, and in the DVD audio commentary for the episode, he stated that he \"loved\" writing the episode. The writing process for the episode was \"kind of unusual\", since the writers \"threw it [the episode] together\" without, Scully quipped, thinking of \"things such as thought and structure\". A scene in the episode shows Homer buying new tires for his car. The scene was written by Brian Scully, who had been scammed by a Firestone Tire and Rubber Company dealer. The episode's subplot was the result of the \"Simpsons\" writers trying to find activities for Marge and Lisa to participate in while Bart and Homer were at the Super Bowl. According to Martin, the writers were trying to come up with \"the most boring thing\" Marge and Lisa could do to pass time. After hearing cast member Dan Castellaneta's impression of Vincent Price, the writers found the impression to be so funny that they based the subplot on the fictional crafts set \"Vincent Price's Egg Magic\".\n\nIn a scene in the episode, Homer and Kogen are in Moe's tavern, discussing their favorite football teams with Moe. When Moe mentions that his favorite team is the Atlanta Falcons, he holds a glass in front of his mouth, obscuring his lip movements. He then passes the same glass to Homer, who does the same for the Denver Broncos. Originally, the characters would be saying something else, however, because the staff wanted the episode to be \"current\", new dialogue was recorded for the scene. Because there was no time to animate the scene from scratch, the staff simply made the characters hold a glass in front of their mouths while saying their lines. This technique was also used in reference to the ongoing impeachment scandal, as when the characters mention that the President and First Lady will watching, they cover their mouths when calling them by name. The song that plays during the bus trip to the Super Bowl was performed by NRBQ. The episode also features British rock band Blur's \"Song 2\", which plays during the \"race\" to the stadium.\n\nThe episode features American comedian Fred Willard as Wally Kogen. Scully stated that, for many years, the \"Simpsons\" staff had wanted Willard to guest-star in an episode, and that they had been looking for a character for Willard to portray. Scully also stated that Willard was \"great fun\" to have on the show. Wally Kogen's name is taken from two former writers on \"The Simpsons\"; the character's first name, Wally, is taken from Wallace Wolodarsky, and the character's last name, Kogen, is taken from Jay Kogen. The episode also features former football players Rosey Grier, Troy Aikman and Dan Marino as themselves. Scully stated that, when athletes guest-star in television shows, their performances are \"not always the greatest\", however, he asserted, Aikman, Grier, and Marino were all \"really funny\" and \"did a great job\". Country singer Dolly Parton guest-starred as herself as well. Scully stated that he was \"shocked\" by how short Parton was; however, he added that she was \"very nice\" and \"thrilled\" to be in the episode. Also featured in the episode is Rupert Murdoch, creator of the Fox Broadcasting Company. Originally, the writers wanted Murdoch to be portrayed by Castellaneta, the voice of Homer among other characters in the series. However, after a while, the writers decided to ask if Murdoch would guest-star as himself. Scully comments that the writers were \"impressed\" that Murdoch would introduce himself as a \"billionaire tyrant\" in the episode.\nThe episode pokes fun at U.S. President Bill Clinton. In their list \"15 Simpsons Moments That Perfectly Captured Their Eras\", Genevieve Koski, Josh Modell, Noel Murray, Sean O'Neal, Kyle Ryan, and Scott Tobias of \"The A.V. Club\" wrote \"By the time this episode aired [...], the nation had endured more than a year of the Lewinsky scandal. The episode debuted a month after the House impeached Clinton, but less than two weeks before the Senate's impeach/acquit vote, so an air of uncertainty lingered over an otherwise lightweight episode about Homer organizing a Super Bowl trip.\" Wally covers his mouth with a glass when he mentions the names of Bill and Hillary, who he hears will be watching the Super Bowl. In a scene in the episode, Clinton calls to congratulate the Super Bowl victors from the Oval Office, but is distracted by Al Gore measuring a window. As Scully recalls, at the time, the \"Simpsons\" writers were confident Gore would win the 2000 presidential election, which eventually was marginally, and controversially, won by George W. Bush.\n\nThe episode also comments on the series' fanbase. Near the end of the episode, Madden and Summerall provide the following analysis:\n\nIn his book \"Leaving Springfield\", John Alberti writes about the exchange: \"This conversation begins with conventional football game patter used to comment on the episode, but then takes an abrupt turn when Madden realizes, in spite of the humor, that the episode did not live up to expectations (which he has not originally noticed).\"\n\nThe episode title is a reference to the film \"Sunday Bloody Sunday\" (1971), and perhaps the U2 song of the same name. The couch gag is a reference to James Cameron's 1997 film \"Titanic\". The beginning of the episode shows Bart's grade visiting a post office. Their tour guide is modeled after American actor and folk singer Burl Ives, whom director Moore is a fan of. \"Vincent Price's Egg Magic\" is a parody on celebrity-endorsed craft kits which were popular during the 1960s and which, according to Meyer, do not exist anymore. The decision to have Price endorse an egg crafts product is based on Price's role as Egghead in the 1960s series \"Batman\". The sequence featuring a man called Rudy being refused entry to the group's bus because he is \"too small to go to the Super Bowl\" is a reference to the 1993 film \"Rudy\" about football player Rudy Ruettiger. Dolly Parton says she will be joined by actor Rob Lowe and dance group Stomp for her performance during the Super Bowl halftime show, while the Super Bowl features a booth called \"Take a Leak with NFL Greats\"; the players shown participating are Ricky Watters and Jim Plunkett.\n\nIn its original American broadcast on January 31, 1999, \"Sunday, Cruddy Sunday\" received an 11.6 rating, meaning it was seen by approximately 11.5 million viewers. It finished in 10th place in the ratings for the week of January 25–31, 1999, making it the second most watched scripted program on Fox, after the premiere of \"Family Guy\". On September 14, 2004, \"Sunday, Cruddy Sunday\", along with the season 1 episode \"Homer's Night Out\", the season 11 episode \"The Mansion Family\" and the season 13 episode \"Homer the Moe\", were released on a DVD set called \"The Simpsons – Gone Wild\". On August 7, 2007, \"Sunday, Cruddy Sunday\" was again released as part of \"The Simpsons – The Complete Tenth Season\" DVD box set. Matt Groening, Mike Scully, George Meyer, Tom Martin, Matt Selman and Steven Dean Moore participated in the DVD's audio commentary of the episode.\n\nThe beginning of the episode's third act shows Marge and Lisa watching a Super Bowl commercial. In his book \"The Gospel According to\" The Simpsons, Mark I. Pinsky described the commercial:\n\nThe scene was inspired by real-life Super Bowl commercials in which, according to Scully, \"you don't know what the product is\" because there is \"so much going on\" in Super Bowl commercials. It was also based on the music video for the American rock band ZZ Top's 1983 song \"Legs\". Although they had come up with the commercial's premise, they were not sure of what its tagline would be. Eventually, Martin, one of the episode writers, suggested \"The Catholic Church... we've made a few changes.\" It got the biggest laugh from the other writers and was subsequently included in the episode.\n\nThe scene garnered scrutiny from members of The Catholic League, a self-appointed organization that is not, despite its name, affiliated with the Catholic Church. The league had criticized \"The Simpsons\"<nowiki>'</nowiki> depiction of Catholicism before, namely in the episode \"Lisa Gets an \"A\"\", which aired the year before. The scene included an exchange between Bart and Marge that the League felt was hurtful to Catholics. William A. Donohue, the president of the league, wrote Fox a letter asking them to explain why the dialogue was in the show. After failing to receive an answer several times, Donohue was at last given a reply written by Thomas Chavez, manager for broadcast standards and practices. The league were not satisfied with Chavez' answer. After \"Sunday, Cruddy Sunday\" aired, the Catholic League issued an article in their news magazine \"Catalyst\". In it, they mentioned the scene in \"Lisa Gets an \"A\"\", and wrote that \"The Simpsons\" had \"struck again, big time\" with the Super Bowl commercial in \"Sunday, Cruddy Sunday\". They wrote that they had sent a complaint to Chavez regarding the scene, and encouraged others to do the same; \"We wrote to Mr. Chavez again, but we also told him that he’d be hearing from you, too. So don’t disappoint us.\"\n\nFollowing the episode's broadcast, the Fox network received several angry letters and emails from concerned Catholics, who were uneasy with the commercial scene. According to Scully, the letters were worded the same, and all started with \"My family and I have always enjoyed \"The Simpsons\", until last night...\" Nevertheless, the letters provoked a reaction from \"The Simpsons\" staff, and in an interview, Scully said, \"We got a couple of hundred letters, and it was very obvious from reading a majority of them that [the Catholic letter writers] had not seen the show. Some of them were from third-graders, all saying the same thing: 'Please don't make fun of my religion.' Which we all know third-graders are very adamant about.\"\n\nSeveral months later, the Catholic League contacted Fox again, asking that the word \"Catholic\" be excised from the voice-over when the episode repeated in September 1999 on the network, as well as in its subsequent syndicated airings. The network agreed, and Roland MacFarland, Fox's vice president of broadcast standards, ordered Scully to cut the word from the episode or eliminate all reference to religion. Scully refused, and after a long argument, MacFarland offered to replace the protesting denomination with a Protestant substitute – Methodist, Presbyterians or Baptists. Scully then asked MacFarland \"What would be the difference changing it to another religion, and wouldn't that just be offending a different group of people?\", to which MacFarland replied that Fox had already had trouble with the Catholics earlier that season.\n\nFollowing the complaints, Fox removed any mention of Catholicism from the scene, resulting in the line \"The church...\" Scully was reportedly furious with Fox's actions. In an interview in \"Los Angeles Times\", Scully said, \"people can say hurtful things to each other about their weight, their race, their intelligence, their sexual preference, and that all seems up for grabs, but when you get into religion, some people get very nervous.\" Marisa Guthrie of \"Boston Herald\" also criticized the network, describing it as \"caving in\" to the Catholic League's protests. She wrote, \"Hollywood has always been gun shy of controversy, but recent displays of self-censorship on the part of entertainment industry executives make us cringe [...] Granted Catholics, as a group have endured an ample amount of bashing, but \"The Simpsons\" is an equal opportunity offender.\" Howard Rosenberg, a writer for \"Los Angeles Times\", criticized Fox's actions as well. He argued that the network had a biased opinion towards Catholicism and that, had the scene mentioned a different religion, it would have been accepted. He also wrote, \"Given its famous flaunting of sleaze and death-defying motorcycle leaps, the big news here is that Fox has standards. Its latest production is Censors Who Kill Jokes.\"\nIn an issue of \"Catalyst\", the Catholic League responded to Rosenberg's article. They argued that Rosenberg was biased against Catholics, in that he was content with the series lampooning Catholicism, but not other religions. They wrote, \"all along we have been told by Fox that none of our complaints were valid because none of the material was truly offensive. But now we have a Fox executive producer disingenuously giving away his hand by protesting why it should be okay to offend another group of people with the same material he initially said wasn't offensive to Catholics! And isn't it striking that Rosenberg is upset with the fact that the double standard—which now, for the first time works positively for Catholics—is a real problem. Never do we remember Rosenberg protesting the double standard that allows 'artists' to dump on Catholics while protecting most other segments of society from their assaults.\" The League also complimented the members' participation, writing, \"It only goes to prove what can be done when Catholics get actively involved.\"\n\nThe controversy surrounding the scene has since been referenced in later episodes of the series. While the censored version of \"Sunday, Cruddy Sunday\" is still in syndication in the USA, it was left uncensored on its release on \"The Simpsons – The Complete Tenth Season\" DVD box set.\n\nFollowing its broadcast, \"Sunday, Cruddy Sunday\" received mostly positive reviews from critics. In his review of \"The Simpsons – Gone Wild\" DVD set, David Packard of DVD Verdict wrote: \"This episode has always been one of my favorites, and while the following episode [\"The Mansion Family\"] is a nice inclusion as well, this episode is the best on the disc. The hilarious gags come at a slam-bang pace, and they're occasionally edgy.\" He especially liked the set-piece in the post office, as well as the Super Bowl commercial. Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood of \"I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide\" called the episode \"A thoroughly enjoyable romp through what happens when a bunch of lads go for a Sunday out at the ball game.\" They enjoyed the guest-stars, writing \"both Dolly Parton and, bizarrely, Rupert Murdoch – spice things up nicely\", however they were most fond of Fred Willard as Wally Kogen. \"A shame he doesn't join our regulars\", they wrote. James Plath of DVD Town wrote that the episode is \"funny,\" and Ian Jane of DVD Talk found the episode \"amusing\". The \"Orlando Sentinel\"s Gregory Hardy named it the third best episode of the show with a sports theme. Phillip Stephenson of \"Pittsburgh Post-Gazette\" called the episode \"classic\", and Susan Dunne of \"The Hartford Courant\" described it as \"debauched but hilarious\". \"The Cincinnati Post\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Greg Paeth noted that the episode is a critical favorite.\n\nOn the other hand, Colin Jacobson of DVD Movie Guide gave the episode a more mixed review. He wrote: \"Like most guest star-ridden episodes, this one gets a bit gimmicky to fit in all the cameos.\" He found the self-referential ending \"fails to become clever and instead just seems silly.\" However, he wrote that the episode \"includes a few goods bits, especially the phone call in which Homer convinces Lenny to go to the game.\" Jake McNeill of Digital Entertainment News wrote that the episode is \"so jam-packed with guest celebrity voices that they ran out of room for a plot. Or humor.\" Chris Barsanti of Filmcritic.com gave a negative review as well, and wrote that the episode is \"lost amid a flurry of celebrity walk-ons and lazy jokes.\"\n\n\n"}

With writer Steve Parkhouse, he created the pulp adventure character Night Raven. Lloyd names John Burns, Steve Ditko, Ronald Embleton, Jack Kirby, and Tony Weare as artistic influences. Lloyd drew a comics adaptation of the \"Time Bandits\" film in 1982.\n\nDez Skinn set up \"Warrior\" magazine in 1982 and asked Lloyd to create a new pulp character. Lloyd and writer Alan Moore, who had previously collaborated on several \"Doctor Who\" stories at Marvel UK, created \"V for Vendetta\", a dystopian adventure featuring a flamboyant anarchist terrorist fighting against a future fascist government. Lloyd, who illustrated in cinematic chiaroscuro, devised V's Guy Fawkes-inspired appearance and suggested that Moore avoid captions, sound effects and thought balloons. Lloyd stated in a 2005 interview that \"I don't know why I thought of Guy Fawkes, because it was during the summer. I thought that would be great if he looked like Guy Fawkes, kind of theatrical. I just suggested it to Alan, and he said, 'that sounds like a good idea.' It gave us everything, the costume and everything. During the summer, I couldn't get any of these masks. These masks that you could get in every shop had a smile built into them. So I created this Guy Fawkes mask with a kind of smile. It was an ideal costume for this future anarchist persona.\" After \"Warrior\" folded in 1984, the series was reprinted and continued in colour by DC Comics in 1988 and collected as a graphic novel in 1995. It was adapted into a film released in 2005. The stylized Guy Fawkes mask that Lloyd created for \"V for Vendetta\" has transcended the story and made its way into the real world, frequently being used by protesters (particularly Anonymous) demonstrating against the injustices of governments, cults, financial institutions and other powerful organizations.\n\nHe was one of the artists on the graphic horror anthology \"Wasteland\" for DC Comics with writers John Ostrander and Del Close. Lloyd has also worked on \"Espers\", with writer James D. Hudnall, for Eclipse Comics; \"Hellblazer\", with writers Grant Morrison and Jamie Delano, and \"War Story\", with Garth Ennis, for DC; and \"Global Frequency\", with Warren Ellis, for WildStorm. With Delano he drew \"The Territory\" for Dark Horse Comics, where he also worked on some of their licensed properties such as \"Aliens\" and \"James Bond\". In 2006 Lloyd created a graphic novel, \"Kickback\", for the French publisher .\n\nIn 2012 Lloyd established \"Aces Weekly\", an online comics anthology featuring creators such as Mark Wheatley, Val Mayerik, John McCrea, Phil Hester, Lew Stringer and David Leach.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1820528", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1820528", "title": "The Duke Spirit", "text": "The Duke Spirit\n\nThe Duke Spirit are an English rock band based in London. Their sound has been seen as a melding of influences ranging from alternative rock bands such as The Jesus and Mary Chain and Spiritualized, the tremulous rock'n'roll of bands such as The Gun Club and The Patti Smith Group, to distinctive rhythmic 'Atlantic soul' and Motown influences. Band members Liela Moss and Toby Butler also perform together in the electro-rock duo \"Roman Remains\".\n\nThe band was formed in London in 2003 by Luke Ford (guitar), Liela Moss (vocals), Toby Butler (bass) and Dan Higgins (guitar). \n\nFord and Moss met at art college in Cheltenham where he was studying photography and Moss was taking a Fine Arts course. After moving to London and a short period writing and performing as \"Solomon\" (in which they were later joined by Butler) they formed The Duke Spirit. Along with guitarist Dan Higgins they set about writing, recording and self-producing a group of songs that formed the basis of their first single and EP. Higgins also created the woodcuts that served as the band's early artwork.\n\nThe band released their second single \"Darling You're Mean/Bottom of the Sea\" in May on the City Rockers label, without having performed live. The line-up was completed by drummer Olly \"The Kid\" Betts, and the band played their first show at the Brixton Windmill later that year. They released the \"Roll, Spirit, Roll\" EP toward the end of 2003, which won the band critical acclaim from publications such as \"NME\". \n\nThe band's debut album was due to be released in September 2004 until their record label, City Rockers, ran out of financial steam. They moved over to Loog Records/Polydor and released the album in the UK on 16 May 2005. The album's producers were Simon Raymonde (formerly the bass player in The Cocteau Twins, and now Bella Union Label boss) and Flood, best known for his work with Nick Cave, NIN and U2. After headlining tours of the UK, the album was released in the U.S. and the band found themselves travelling through America for much of 2006, including a highly praised performance at the Coachella 2006 festival, California.\n\nThe only release of 2006 was a downloadable EP and limited 7\" single entitled \"Covered In Love\", released through the band's own Velo Recordings. This was a collection of songs, recorded to 8-track by the band, written by the recently deceased (Arthur Lee, Desmond Dekker and Jessie Mae Hemphill). In early 2007, the band signed to You Are Here a new independent Anglo-Canadian label. The track \"Mayday\", a collaboration between UNKLE and The Duke Spirit was released on the latest UNKLE album, \"War Stories\", in the UK on 9 July 2007. The track was recorded with Chris Goss at the Rancho De La Luna studio in Joshua Tree, California where they returned in April 2007 to record their own second album, also with Goss. \"Neptune\" was released in February 2008. Shortly afterward, Higgins left the band to concentrate on his family, which prompted a personnel shuffle: Toby Butler switched to guitar, with longtime friend Marc Sallis replacing him on bass.\n\nIn February 2009, the band released a 10-track compilation CD featuring three songs never released in the US (\"Masca\", \"Souvenir\", \"Do What You Love\") as well as a cover of Alex Chilton's \"Baby Doll\". The CD was sold alongside an Alexander McQueen collection, one of the shirts of which featured the face of singer Liela Moss.\n\nThe band's third album, \"Bruiser\" (produced by Andrew Scheps and UNKLE's Rich File), was released in September 2011 through Fiction in the UK, Shangrila music in the U.S. and Co-Operative Music throughout the rest of the world. The album was preceded by the \"Kusama\" EP in early 2011, named in tribute to the Japanese artist Yayoi Kusama whose work had become an inspiration to the band during the writing of the 3rd album. Yayoi Kusama was also the main inspiration and lyrical focus for the song \"Sweet Bitter Sweet\" on the \"Bruiser\" album. \"Bruiser\" brought several more U.S. and European tours and they released a live LP, 'Dresden Live' (recorded as the name would suggest in Dresden, Germany) for Record Store Day 2012 with a sleeve design by British artist 'French'. Following this the band went into a 2-year period of hibernation, Moss & Butler releasing new music under the moniker 'Roman Remains' and Betts producing and drumming with London Band 'Furs'. \n\nIn October 2014, the band re-grouped and working between London & Somerset they began to shape new sketches and demos into a set of songs for a fourth LP. They again called on producer Simon Raymonde and in January 2015 they threw themselves into recording the new album, to be titled \"Kin\", in Urchin Studios, Hackney, London, over a period of 3 weeks.\n\nSeptember 2015 brought with it the first Duke Spirit performance in three years at the End of the Road Festival with new bass player Rich Fownes (Bad for Lazarus, Unkle, The Eighties Matchbox B-Line Disaster) and also the first release from \"Kin\", the song \"Here Comes the Vapour\". The following single, \"Blue and Yellow Light\", was released in November with an accompanying music video.\n\nThe Duke Spirit have received acclaim and increasing success despite relatively little advertising based promotion on television and radio. Initially a 'word of mouth' band, their touring schedules have helped them to spread their music across the country and eventually into America and the rest of Europe, which culminated in a nomination for \"Best Live Band\" at the 2011 Artrocker Magazine Awards. They have played a number of high-profile support slots for Queens of the Stone Age, Yeah Yeah Yeahs, British Sea Power, R.E.M., Black Rebel Motorcycle Club, Supergrass, Eagles Of Death Metal and Jane's Addiction. Since 2008, the band have performed on American and British TV more than seven times - appearing on \"Later... with Jools Holland\", \"Late Night with Conan O'Brien\", \"The Tonight Show with Jay Leno\", \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\", \"Last Call with Carson Daly\", \"It's On with Alexa Chung\", \"The Henry Rollins Show\", \"Shameless\", and the \"Late Show with David Letterman\". Their song \"Send a Little Love Token\" was also included in the fifth title in the \"Guitar Hero\" video game series. Released in September 2009, it had sold nearly 1 million copies worldwide by the end of the year.\n\n\n\n"}

From the late 1950s into the 1980s Morgus was a \"horror host\" of late-night science fiction and horror movies and television shows that originated in the New Orleans, Louisiana market. Morgus is a quintessential mad scientist, assisted by executioner-styled sidekick, Chopsley (Tommy George). Morgus' well-intentioned experiments often served as book-end pieces to the late-night films being shown, and typically went awry at the last minute.\n\nA native of New Orleans, Sidney Noel Rideau (aka Sid Noel) attended broadcasting school and worked for radio station WWEZ-AM before joining WSMB-AM in 1956. While at WSMB, Rideau led a vocal group that recorded a novelty song called “Humpty Dump” with Atlantic Records. While Rideau was working as a disc jockey at WWL (AM) radio in 1958, he auditioned for a job hosting the new WWL-TV show, \"House of Shock\". Rideau was awarded the job, and agreed to do it \"only if he could make the show funny\". He created and performed as the host character \"Doctor Morgus\", however Rideau did not want to reveal his real-life identity. According to Rideau, \"being Morgus brought with it some challenges to say the least\". For approximately 50 years, Rideau tried to keep his identity private, and reportedly didn't even tell his children he was Morgus.\n\nMorgus first appeared on late night television on January 3, 1959, in the \"House of Shock\", hosting science fiction and horror movies \"in between experiments\". The set was styled to look like an upstairs garret supposedly located over the old city ice house, with a fire escape exit into Pirate's Alley in the old French Quarter.\n\nIn 1964, Rideau moved to Detroit, Michigan and produced and starred in \"Morgus Presents\" on WJBK-TV. In 1965, Rideau and \"Morgus Presents\" (aka ‘’Morgus The Magnificent’’) returned to New Orleans on WWL-TV and remained on the air for two years. \"Morgus Presents\" reappeared as an afternoon show in 1970 on WDSU-TV, but was discontinued in 1971. After another long hiatus, \"Morgus Presents\" returned in January 1987, on WGNO-TV. Long-time New Orleans television director and Morgus collaborator, Paul Yacich, directed all fifty-two episodes. By 2005, \"Morgus Presents\" had gone into syndication and aired on various stations, such as Cox Cable channel 10, and WVUE Fox 8 in New Orleans.\n\nWhen Hurricane Katrina hit New Orleans in 2005, fans feared Morgus may have been a victim of the storm, but within weeks, his survival was announced on his official website.\n\nMorgus was said to have descended from a long line of scientists dating back to Morgus the First, who was the architect of the first pyramid in Egypt. He mastered calculus at 5 years of age, and his mother and father (both scientists) sent him to the Vasco da Gama Medical school (the finest in the Caribbean) where he graduated with honors. He is reported to have an I.Q. \"in the 300s\". Morgus claims to have published several scientific books, including his blockbuster \"New Hope for the Dead\", and the earth-shaking \"Molecules I Have Known\". He has discovered the speed of dark, and truly invented the Internet. He rails against \"those idiots at the station\" and \"the idiots of the scientific community\". Morgus says he is Earth's main member of the \"Higher Order\", a super-scientific secret society dedicated to helping the development of intelligence throughout the universe. His Momus Alexander Morgus Institute (M.A.M.I., pronounced \"mammy\") is (unintentionally) a non-profit organization of science.\n\nMorgus' assistant Chopsley, played by actor Tommy George (after his death, played by James Guillot from 1987 on), was a former medical school classmate, and the subject of an early experiment in \"face transplant\" surgery. Unfortunately this left him without a face when he laughed before the procedure could heal. As a result, he wears a full head mask at all times (with a zippered mouth through which to eat).\n\nMorgus assistant Eric was a talking human skull in early episodes of the show. When the show returned in the 1980s, Eric had become part of the computer known as E.R.I.C. (The Eon Research Infinity Computer). Eric's skull connected to a molecular integrated circuit which holds all the knowledge of the universe in his memory banks (thanks to the oversight of the Higher Order), and whose sepulchral voice introduced the segments and frequently agreed with Morgus with a deep, resonant \"Yes, Master\". E.R.I.C. is also known for his sharp wit, and sometimes cutting remarks at Morgus. On the set, E.R.I.C. was portrayed by an Apple II with a skull as the speaker.\n\nMrs. Alma Fetish is Morgus' long-time (and long-suffering) landlady, who often forgets that scientific endeavors do not provide rent money on a regular basis. Veteran New Orleans stage actress Janet Shea portrayed Mrs. Fetish in the 1986-1989 \"Morgus Presents\" version of the show.\n\nMorgus' manager Wiley Faye tried to bring the good doctor increased exposure and better business opportunities, but they never seemed to work out in the end. Wiley was portrayed in the 1986-1989 version of the program by actor Matt Borel, a familiar face from New Orleans area theater and television commercials. Although he gave up acting in the late '90s, Borel went on to become a highly successful stage producer in New Orleans.\n\nIn 1959, Mississippi-based Vin Records released a 7-inch single entitled \"Morgus The Magnificent\" by Frankie Ford and Mac Rebennack performing as \"Morgus and The Ghouls\" (aka \"Morgus & The 3 Ghouls\"). The record made the local New Orleans radio top ten record chart. In 1964, the Detroit-based Fulton record label released another single, \"Werewolf\", featuring Morgus and The Daringers, with an instrumental track (\"The Morgus Creep\") on its B side.\n\nMorgus' first and only appearance in film was in \"The Wacky World of Dr. Morgus\" (1962), which introduced his \"Instant People Machine\" that could transform people into sand and back to their original form. In the film, Morgus was investigated by a stereotypical reporter known as \"Pencils\" and foreign agents from Microvania who sought to enter the United States by using the device. Instead of an invasion, its contents ended up as concrete, which was poured at a dedication ceremony for a new highway called \"People's Highway.\"\n\nMorgus and Chopsley appeared at Pontchartrain Beach amusement park and local events in the early 1960s, and hosted a weather report in later years. Dr. Morgus, Chopsley and E.R.I.C. attempted to branch out across the country in syndicated appearances in Detroit in 1964, New York in the 1980s, and several other cities.\n\nMorgus has appeared on Coast to Coast AM several times as a guest. According to host George Noory, Morgus was an influence on him as a boy and inspired his broadcasting career.\n\n"}
{"id": "1820540", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1820540", "title": "Serious (Duran Duran song)", "text": "Serious (Duran Duran song)\n\n\"Serious\" is the 22nd single by English rock band Duran Duran. It was released 1 October 1990 as the second single from the \"Liberty\" album, reaching number three in Italy and number 48 in the United Kingdom.\n\nBy the time the single was released, interest in the \"Liberty\" album had already waned. Poor promotion, including a decision not to tour in support of the album, led the single to stall at number 48 on the UK Singles Chart. This was the band's worst-charting single up until that point.\n\nThe black and white video, set at a circus, was directed by the duo Big TV! and features model Tess Daly. The video is a favourite among fans for the relaxed, natural attitude among the band members as they play their instruments, sometimes prompting each other into laughter. A multi-angle version of the video is available on the \"Greatest\" DVD in 2003, taking advantage of the multiple angle feature available on certain DVD players.\n\nNo remix of \"Serious\" was ever released; a minor edit of the album version was used on the single release. The single's primary b-side, \"Yo Bad Azizi\", is an experimental song built around a lyric from \"Is There Something I Should Know?\"; \"\"Yo bad azizi as a nuclear war\"\", a corruption of \"\"You're about as easy as a nuclear war\"\" due to the way vocalist Simon Le Bon sings the line. This was reportedly prompted by a fan's letter asking Le Bon what \"yo bad azizi\" meant.\n\nThe bonus b-side on the 12\" and CD versions is \"Water Babies\", a remix of \"Liberty\" album track \"All Along the Water\".

In 1983, he accepted the Order of the Sacred Treasure, an honor bestowed by the Emperor of Japan and the Japanese government.\n\nNakashima was born in 1905 in Spokane, Washington, to Katsuharu and Suzu Nakashima. He enrolled in the University of Washington program in architecture, graduating with a Bachelor of Architecture (B.Arch) in 1929. In 1931, after earning a master's degree in architecture from M.I.T., Nakashima sold his car and purchased a round-the-world tramp steamship ticket. He spent a year in France living the life of a bohemian, and then went on to North Africa and eventually to Japan. While in Japan, Nakashima went to work for Antonin Raymond, an American architect who had collaborated with Frank Lloyd Wright on the Imperial Hotel. While working for Raymond, Nakashima toured Japan extensively, studying the subtleties of Japanese architecture and design. During this period he met Marion Okajima, who would become his wife. While working for Raymond, Nakashima worked as the project architect for the Golconde Dormitory in Puducherry, India, supervising construction from 1937-39 and immersing himself in the spiritual teachings of the sect.\n\nIn 1937, Raymond's company was commissioned to build a dormitory at an ashram in Puducherry, India for which Nakashima was the primary construction consultant. It was here that Nakashima made his first furniture.\n\nIn 1940 Nakashima returned to America, and began to make furniture and teach woodworking in Seattle. Like others of Japanese ancestry, he was interned during the Second World War and sent to Camp Minidoka in Hunt, Idaho, in March 1942. At the camp he met Gentaro (sometimes spelled Gentauro) Hikogawa, a man trained in traditional Japanese carpentry. Under his tutelage, Nakashima learned to master traditional Japanese hand tools and joinery techniques. Perhaps more significant, he began to approach woodworking with discipline and patience, striving for perfection in every stage of construction.\n\nNakashima's signature woodworking design was his large-scale tables made of large wood slabs with smooth tops but unfinished natural edges, consisting of multiple slabs connected with butterfly joints.\n\nIn 1943, Antonin Raymond successfully sponsored Nakashima’s release from the camp and invited him to his farm in New Hope, Pennsylvania. In his studio and workshop at New Hope, Nakashima explored the organic expressiveness of wood and choosing boards with knots and burls and figured grain. He designed furniture lines for Knoll, including the Straight Back Chair (which is still in production), and Widdicomb-Mueller as he continued his private commissions. The studio grew incrementally until Nelson Rockefeller commissioned 200 pieces for his house in Pocantico Hills, New York, in 1973.\n\nDrawing on Japanese designs and shop practices, as well as on American and International Modern styles, Nakashima created a body of work that would make his name synonymous with the best of 20th century American Art furniture.\n\nNakashima's home, studio, and workshop near New Hope, Pennsylvania, was listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places in August 2008; six years later the property was also designated a National Historic Landmark. In June 2015, the site received a \"Keeping It Modern\" grant from the Getty Foundation to create a solid conservation plan as a model approach for the preservation of historic properties. One of Nakashima's workshops, located in Takamatsu City, Japan, currently houses a museum and gallery of his works. The Nakashima Foundation for Peace, currently housed in the Minguren Museum in New Hope, had its beginnings in 1984. In 1984, George Nakashima had the opportunity to purchase the largest and finest walnut log he had ever seen and sought to use the immense planks to their fullest potential. He dreamed then that if Altars for Peace were made for each continent of the world, as centers for meditation, prayer, and activities for peace, the world would be a better place. Over the past decade, his furniture has become ultra-collectible and his legacy of what became known as the \"free-edge\" aesthetic influential. Today the Nakashima business makes standard wooden furniture and continues to create more peace altars, soon to complete Nakashima's legacy. To do so the company has procured yet another extremely valuable walnut log that almost matches the size and magnificence of the original.\n\nNakashima's daughter, Mira Nakashima, took over the company from her father after he passed away in 1990. Mira, who has worked for the family business since 1970, currently produces his iconic designs as well as her own.\n\n\n\n"}

McIntosh for the Caledonian Railway and introduced in 1899. They had the same boiler type as the 721 “Dunalastair” Class 4-4-0s. They were nicknamed \"Jumbos\" and they could reach speeds of up to 55 miles per hour.\n\n96 locomotives were built, as follows:\n\nSeventeen were fitted with the Westinghouse air brakes for passenger train working, including the only surviving engine of the class, No. 828.\nAll 96 passed to the London, Midland and Scottish Railway at the 1923 grouping. Only three, 17567, 17598 and 17610, had been withdrawn by the time of nationalisation in 1948. The last locomotive in service was not withdrawn until 1963.\n\nLocomotive 828 (LMS 17566, BR 57566) is the sole survivor of the class and is an important example of Scottish industrial heritage. It is based at the Strathspey Railway. It was returned to regular service in 2010 and then again in March 2017 following heavy repairs.\n\nBelgian State Railways (SNCB-NMBS) derived three series of steam locomotives (891 units) from the class 812 between 1899 and 1914. They had a shallower firebox, able to burn semi-bituminous coal and briquettes, allowing a shorter wheelbase due to its positioning above the rear axle. There were three classes\nUntil 1909, they were the only new engines used with freight trains. They were also used on suburban and local passenger trains and some expresses on hilly sections.\nMost of them were retired between 1947 and 1959. Some of them were then used as stationary boilers and two of them (44.221 and 41.195) survive in museums. A third one (44.021), kept as a parts donor, was cut up for scrap in 2002.\n\nIn The Railway Series children's books by the Rev. W. Awdry, the characters Donald and Douglas (\"the Scottish twins\"), are based on the Caledonian 812 class. They carried fictional numbers (57646 and 57647) before coming to Sodor. This numbering places them as the youngest of the 652 class (see table above). \n\n\n"}

It is often a serious obstacle for mountaineers, who sometimes abbreviate \"bergschrund\" to \"schrund\".\n\nIn a corrie or cirque, the bergschrund is positioned at the rear, parallel to the back wall of the corrie. It is caused by the rotational movement of the glacier. In a longitudinal glacier, the bergschrund is at the top end of the glacier at a right angle to the flow of the glacier. It is caused by the downwards flow of the glacier.\n\nBergschrunds extend to the bedrock and can have a depth of well over .\n\nIn winter, a bergschrund is often filled by snow from avalanches from the mountain above it. In later summer, due to melting, it lies open and can present a very difficult obstacle to alpinists.\n\nThe bergschrund is distinct from the randkluft (also called \"rimaye\"), which is the crevasse of which one face is the rock, back wall of the corrie. The randkluft arises in part from the melting of the ice due to the presence of the warmer rock face. However, the randkluft is sometimes called a bergschrund. The French word \"rimaye\" covers both notions of randkluft and bergschrund.\n\nOn the South Col route to reach the summit of Mount Everest, a deep bergschrund lies at the bottom of the Lhotse face, separating Camp II from Camp III.\n\n"}
{"id": "1820576", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1820576", "title": "Legends of Tallinn", "text": "Legends of Tallinn\n\nLike any other medieval city, Tallinn (known as Reval from the 13th century until the 1920s) has inspired many legends.\n\nOne of the defensive towers in the town wall that surrounds old Tallinn is called \"Kiek in de Kök\" (Low German: \"peek into the kitchen\"). There is a sculpture on its wall which depicts a deerhunt in Toompea (), a district of old Reval. The deerhunt is said to have given the town its old name, \"Reval\".\n\nAccording to legend the Danish king Valdemar II was hunting for deer in Toompea when he spotted a beautiful stag. The king liked the animal much and so he ordered it to be caught alive. Unfortunately, the deer escaped, fell from a high limestone bank and broke its neck. In German, \"Reh-fall\" means \"fall of a deer\", and so that is where the name \"Reval\" was derived from.\n\nHowever, the \"deer-fall\" legend is not supported by any documentary evidence. More likely \"Reval\" is derived from the name of the adjacent ancient Estonian county of Revalia (Rävala), and in fact the first recorded occurrences of that name predate the Danish king's first visit to Estonia in 1219 by several years.\n\nIf you happen to be standing near the so-called Cat's Well on Rataskaevu Street, look up at house number 16 and you'll notice something odd. One of the windows on the top floor is bricked up from the inside, and has false curtains painted on the inside. This 15th century house happens to be the subject of Tallinn's most famous ghost legend, a story called \"The Devil’s Wedding\". The tale goes like this: Long ago, the landlord of this house, desperate for money and nearly suicidal, was approached by a mysterious, cloaked man who offered a huge sum of money to rent the upstairs flat for a party. The renter's only condition was complete privacy. The landlord readily agreed. During the evening in question, loud noises were heard, as if a hundred guests were tramping up the stairs, and an ungodly racket issued from the room. Precisely at 1 o’clock the sound abruptly stopped, as if the party had simply vanished. The next day the landlord's servant, who had been spying through the keyhole, was found mortally ill. Before dying, the servant claimed to have seen the Devil himself having a wedding party in the flat.\n\nIn the Lake Ülemiste, the largest lake surrounding Tallinn, there is boulder called Lindakivi (\"Linda's rock\"). In Estonian mythology, it is believed to be one of the boulders Linda was supposed to carry to Kalev's grave at Toompea, but which fell off her apron. She sat on the boulder and cried, thus creating the lake.\n\nThe semi-legendary-mythological \"Ülemiste Elder\" (Estonian: Ülemiste vanake) is believed to live in the lake. If anyone should meet him, then he is believed to ask: \"Is Tallinn ready yet?\". If then the other person answered \"yes\", then he would flood the city. Thus, the correct answer would be: \"No, there is much to be done yet\". This tale is sometimes viewed as an explanation why Tallinn is building/growing all the time.\n\nOn a rainy autumn day, a man was driving from Narva towards Tallinn, when he saw a young hitchhiker dressed in black. The man stopped and let the hitchhiker in. She was going to Tallinn. The man decided to take her, because he was also going there. The hitchhiker wanted to be dropped off at Ülemiste. The lady was very quiet, and she looked sad. When the man dropped her off at Ülemiste, she asked him if he could pick her up on Keevise Street in the afternoon. The man agreed, but when he went to pick her up, the hitchhiker was not there. The man waited for a long time and then decided to go look for her. He asked the people who worked in the factories, but none of them knew anything about her. The man was confused and decided to go back to Narva alone. A couple of years later, some bones were found in the basement of a building, under its electricity generator, crunched to pieces. Nobody knows the exact location of the building, but reports of the time mentioned a slaughter house and a weapon factory, a railway bridge and an airport. Occasionally drivers on the Narva- Tallinn route report seeing a figure fitting the description wondering aimlessly around Ülemiste.\n\nA long time ago Tallinn was growing pretty slowly. All the inhabitants wanted Tallinn to be a big seaport, but the merchant ships would not come to Tallinn. Then someone got a very interesting idea: to build a church with such a high tower, which nobody has never seen before. The ships would see the church from the open sea and would come to Tallinn with their goods. Everybody liked the idea. But where would they find such a craftsman to build such a church. Suddenly out of nowhere came a craftsman and applied for the job. Citizens gladly accepted him, but he asked a very high price for his job - ten barrels of gold with one strange condition: if someone would find out his name, then he would work for free. Of course the citizen agreed . The craftsman started working very fast and the people in Tallinn were getting dimmer and dimmer. Every evening they would come to him and say different names hoping that that would be his name. The church was almost finished. The citizens of Tallinn were getting more and more scared. Then they send a spy to his wife and he overheard how she was singing to her baby: Sleep my baby, tomorrow our Olev is coming back and will bring us ten barrels of gold! The spy rushed back into the city. The craftsman was on the roof of the church, placing the cross. When the people started calling him: Hey, Olev! Make sure the cross is straight! When Olev heard his name he understood that he wouldn't get gold! He let the cross go and fell to the ground. At the same moment his body turned into stone.\nThis legend is reenacted at Tallinn Legends, Tallinn's museum of history and folklore.\n"}

He was educated at the Boys Grammar School of Pärnu, Estonia. Later he studied at the Grossherzogliche Technische Hochschule in Darmstadt, Germany.\n\nIn 1912, he immigrated to Glasgow, where he gained an engineering diploma from the Royal Technical College. From 1914 to 1923 he worked in the drawing office of John Brown and Company, a Clydebank shipbuilders, while attending evening classes in sculpture at the Glasgow School of Art.\n\nSchotz became a full-time sculptor in 1923. An important early patron was the Dundee art collector William Boyd, thanks to whose influence both Dundee Dental School and Dundee Art Galleries & Museums hold pieces by him. From this point onwards his reputation grew and he became a full member of the Royal Scottish Academy, head of sculpture at the Glasgow School of Art (a post he held from 1938 until his retirement in 1961), and eventually was appointed the Sculptor in Ordinary for Scotland in 1963. His pupils included the artists Hannah Frank, Stewart Bowman Johnson, and Inge King (née Neufeld).\n\nHis homes at West Campbell Street and later Kirklee Road were a focus for meetings of artists, writers, actors, and politicians.

The school is run by the Toronto District School Board (TDSB); before 1998, it was run by the Toronto Board of Education (TBE).\n\nCentral Tech is located in the Harbord Village neighborhood of downtown Toronto. The campus address is 725 Bathurst Street. The school has three buildings. The main building is southernmost; it includes the school office and numerous classrooms.\n\nCentral Tech offers a wide range of programs, including all the core academic courses, as well as concentrations and specializations in visual arts and technical studies. The school also offers enriched levels and special education, including a resource room for students with learning disabilities. As well, the school offers support to students in the transition from high school to university, college, apprenticeship or employment.\n\nCentral Tech is also one of the TDSB's night-school locations. Two nights per week, the school offers various high-school courses, both to teenagers and to adults, at no charge.\n\nAround the start of the 20th century, the northern and western limits of the City of Toronto intersected near the corner of Bloor and Spadina. It was here that the horse-drawn trolleys of the Toronto Street Railway turned off Bloor Street and made their way south towards the lakefront.\n\nSuburbia began at Spadina; slightly to the west, where Central Tech now stands, was a large apple orchard owned by members of the Saywell family. As more people moved to the suburbs part of this orchard was purchased by the Board of Education and it became the site of Borden St. public school. The fact that the Board already owned this property was largely responsible for its choice as the site of the Toronto Technical School when construction of this school was finally approved.\n\nCurrently, the main building of the complex is the fourth home of Central Tech. As early as 1888, the Association of Stationary Engineers had requested the City Council to consider the establishment of a school for technical training to meet the need for skilled workers for Toronto's booming industries. There followed a certain amount of political buck passing in which the Council tried to shift the responsibility for founding such a school to the Board of Management of the Public Library. The Library Board investigated the whole picture of technical education on this continent and reported that the need for such a school was obvious, but that to be effective, it should be on a much larger scale than originally contemplated by Council. They recommended that a special committee be set up to blueprint the organization and management of the proposed institution. Finally, in 1891, Council passed a motion \"to establish The Toronto Technical School to be located in the St. Lawrence Hall and the anterooms connected therein.\" The school mainly catered to older students with the classes being held in the evenings so that employees could attend after work. Classes began on January 26, 1892, and were held from 8:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m. each public school day.\n\nProvision was made for a total of 150 students studying mathematics, chemistry, descriptive geometry, mechanics, physics, and drafting. Unfortunately, 307 students registered and it was soon apparent that the St. Lawrence Hall was totally inadequate, so the school moved the more spacious Old Wycliffe Hall on the north side of College St. at the head of McCaul St., the present site of the Mining Building of the University of Toronto.\n\nBy 1896, the enrollment had risen to 1,511. Courses in Domestic Science were introduced in that year and the school became coeducational. The overcrowding led to many complaints by interested organizations that demanded a suitable building be provided for the Toronto Technical School. A harassed city council finally appointed a committee to find a new site. Tech currently holds 2,500 students.\n\nAbout this time, the Toronto Athletic Club got into financial difficulties and its property was put up for sale. This was the building known as the Stewart Building on the south side of College St., which until recently housed the Ontario College of Art. The Technical School Board purchased it in 1900 for $80,000 plus back taxes, and agreed to raise a further $10,000 to convert it into a school. The first Art Department in the school was formed by putting a partition across the pool; sculpture was taught in the deep end of the tank and all the other art classes in the remaining area.\n\nDay classes began in 1901 with 151 students, while the attendance at night school continued to soar with 1,710 students registered. One of the main reasons for the popularity of the school was the highly professional staff under the capable leadership of Dr. William Pakenham, who was principal from 1901 until 1907.\n\nThe period from 1900 to 1910 was one of great industrial growth in Canada and it soon became obvious that if Canada were to hold an influential place in world markets, a skilled labour force, backed by trained technicians, was a prime necessity. With this goal in mind, the federal government requested Dr. John Seath to prepare a report on \"Education for Industrial Purposes\". This report finally appeared in 1911. However, this is one instance where the City of Toronto was ahead of its time. Since 1907, it had been considering a site for a fine new technical school to be constructed as a purely civic enterprise. Finally, after many changes of mind, the present location was selected in 1912 and an agreement drawn up to permit the closing of Herrick Street between Lippincott and Borden Streets.\n\nThe Board of Education appointed Dr. A.C. McKay as principal in 1911. Most of the solid foundation of technical education in Toronto can be justly ascribed to the work of this man; indeed, had subsequent Boards adhered to his original plans, the system would have been even better. A former professor of physics at U of T, a chancellor of McMaster, and an experienced teacher in both elementary and secondary schools, Dr. McKay was a man with a great vision of technical education.\nDr. McKay began his plans for Central Tech by first visiting the great polytechnical schools of Europe. He returned with very definite ideas about the kind of building he wanted and immediately announced a competition open to all architects. The competition was won by Ross and Macfarlane of Montreal. The cornerstone of the new building was laid on September 3, 1913, by Robert Borden, Prime Minister of Canada. \nThis Collegiate Gothic building, with several expansions, remains the school's home to this day. Features originally incorporated in the building include the crest over the main entrance of the school, the coat of arms of the City of Toronto. Central Tech is the only school that has the privilege of using this crest; it is due to the fact that the citizens of Toronto paid for the school without the aid of other levels of government.\n\nThe \"ribbon\" across the bottom of the crest carries the legend \"Industry, Intelligence, and Integrity\". The two capitals that top the columns supporting the main entrance arch presented a bit of a problem. The Scottish stonemasons who build the school wanted to make their own contribution to the building and they felt that the standard Gothic caps would lack interest. As their gift, they carved the two gnomes that surmount the columns. The one is dressed in academic cap and gown and is busy writing in a book, thus representing the academic side of the school. The second gnome is in the ancient garb of a journeyman working with hammer and chisel, representing the technical side of the school.\n\nThe Exhibition Room, 208, with its fine paneling and fireplace, was a gift from the builder at no cost to the citizens. The principal's office occupied the whole of Room 202. It was beautifully paneled in dark red mahogany with a beamed ceiling and plaster medallions that were masterpieces of the plasterer's art.\n\nThe third floor was known as \"C\" floor and was reserved for the females. No male was allowed on this floor at any time except to go to the \"lunch room\" which occupied the corner and that part of the north corridor now given over to electronics. Segregation by sex was the order of the day and certain doors and stairs were reserved for use by females only.\n\nThe auditorium has always been the focus of school activities. Central Tech was one of the last schools to give up the tradition of daily opening exercises for the whole school.\nThe auditorium was the scene of the official opening of the school on the evening of Tuesday, August 31, 1915. Some thirty-six years later, in 1951, it was converted into a gymnasium.\n\nThe school gradually became more focused on educating youth, with the adult education programs being moved to other schools in the late 1930s. In 1915 there were approximately 750 \"scholars\". With an expected increase in student population the school ultimately had to expand. In 1932 to accommodate the increasing number of aircraft students, the city bought a garage, \"the Annex\", at 844 Bathurst Street. It proved insufficient. In 1951, a major addition was built on the south side, replacing the girls' playing field. This new wing included aircraft and auto mechanic facilities, a new auditorium, and a cafeteria.\n\nTen years later a separate addition was built on the boys' playing field on the north side of the main building. It was to house the increasing number of art students who were overcrowded on the fifth floor of the main building (now the Mathematics Department). Much honour has been bestowed upon the architecture of the building and the high quality of work produced therein.\n\nAnother building was added in 1967 on the northwest corner of the campus. Called the Bathurst Building, it contains numerous shops, two gymnasiums, and an Olympic-sized pool.\n\nThe latest addition has been a large Uniroyal track. These additions replaced a tennis court, a small park, and a playing field on the entire west side block. Today, the high school campus, one of the largest in Canada, is a mixture of contrasting architecture: the Collegiate Gothic of the original building, and the ultramodern of the Art Centre and Bathurst buildings.\n\nMuch honour was bestowed on the school concerning Central Tech's group efforts. Among these were the Cadet Corps, the football team and later, in the 1930s and 40s, the track team. Another highlight was the installation of the memorial organ. Originally built as a memorial to the unfortunate students who lost their lives in the First World War, it soon became an integral part of the school.\n\nDuring the Second World War, Central Tech's facilities were put to use 24 hours a day. From 9:00 a.m. to 3:30 p.m, students attended regular classes. From 4:00 p.m. to 7:30 a.m., special classes were held under the supervision of the Army, Navy and Royal Canadian Air Force. These classes involved marching drills, wireless operating, aircraft mechanics, tank repair, and other subjects related to the war effort.\n\nSeveral films and television series have used the school as a location, including; \nSpider-man: Homecoming\n\n\n\n"}

The march was written and premiered in Tambov in the end of 1912. In summer of 1915 it was released as a gramophone single in Kiev. \"Slavyanka\" means \"Slavic woman\".\n\nThe melody gained popularity in Russia and adjoining countries during World War I, when the Russian soldiers left their homes accompanied by this music. This march was performed also during parade of 7 November 1941 on the Red Square, after which soldiers went straight to fight in Battle of Moscow. This march was also used as an unofficial anthem of Admiral Kolchak's White Army.\n\nIt was commonly believed that prior to its use in the award-winning 1957 film \"The Cranes Are Flying\", the song was banned in the Soviet Union due to lyrics about banned subjects. Due to its popularity and quality, the Communist authorities adopted the song; however, only after significant changes were made to its lyrics. The original text, which sings about Russian patriotism, religion, and culture was not acceptable under the Soviet Union regime. It was originally published by Zimmerman Production Association around 1912. This march was published in an official collection of music for Red Army orchestras, and it was recorded in the early 1940s by a military orchestra under Ivan Petrov (1906–1975), though different lyrics were used during that time. There are lyrics which are usually sung by the Red Army choir today.\n\nSubsequently, several Russian and Polish composers have written lyrics for this music. During World War II in German occupied Poland an adapted \"underground\" version of the song, \"Rozszumiały się wierzby płaczące\" (\"Weeping willows began to hum\") became popular, among anti Nazi partisans, based on lyrics by Roman Ślęzak.\n\nDuring the 1990s, the Yabloko party lobbied for the march to be adopted as the National Anthem of Russia, but without success.\n\n\"Farewell of Slavyanka\" was first used in movies in \"The Cranes Are Flying\". It has also featured in the film \"Charlie Wilson's War\" which is set around the Soviet–Afghan War and in the Russian movies \"72 Meters\" (72 метра) and Prisoner of the Mountains.\nAn instrumental version of the song was featured in the 1990 Ukrainian film, \"Raspad\" (Decay), during the Pripyat evacuation scene.\n\nA Hebrew version was written in 1945 by singer/songwriter Haim Hefer for the Palmach. In his version of the song, called (Between borders), Hefer coined the phrase (We are here a defensive wall) used by Israel Defense Forces when naming Operation Defensive Shield (literally \"Operation Defensive Wall\") in 2002.\n\nThe Farewell of Slavianka first received official lyrics under the Soviet leadership, which were appropriate for the political climate at the time. The part about Russian culture, religion, and patriotism was changed. It was made by A. Fedotov. The first version made under the Soviet Union (1941), didn't mention about the Battle of Berlin. The later version (1967), mentioned it.\n\nThis version of lyrics is written by Vladimir Lazarev in 1984 and it has gained the popularity since the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 because of the slower tempo and the added human fragility factor (\"Farewell, fatherland, remember us, ... ... not all of us will come back. ...\").\n\nA more patriotic version of the march, written by Andrei Mingalyov, was created after the fall of the Soviet Union.\n\nThe Farewell of Slavianka melody was used for the Tambov Oblast anthem. The lyrics for the anthem were made on 22 May 2002, by A. Mitrofanov.\nThe melody of the song is also used for the poem \"My Comrade in Death Throes\". A sample verse is:\nIt was written in December 44 by Ion Degen, World War II tank ace.\n\nAnother version of this song is Vapaa Venäjä. Vapaa Venäjä was composed by the Finnish Red Guards. Its purpose was to serve as a marching song for the Finnish Red Guards.\n\n"}

{"id": "1820619", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1820619", "title": "Garo people", "text": "Garo people\n\nThe Garos are an indigenous Tibeto-Burman ethnic group from the Indian subcontinent, notably found in the Indian states of Meghalaya, Assam, Tripura, Nagaland, and neighboring areas of Bangladesh, notably Mymensingh, Netrokona, Jamalpur, Sherpur and Sylhet, Rangamati who call themselves A·chik Mande (literally \"hill people,\" from \"a·chik\" \"bite soil\" + \"mande\" \"people\") or simply A·chik or Mande - the name \"Garo\" being given to them and used by non-Garos. Historically, Garo name was used for wide range of people in southern bank of Brahmaputra but today, Garo means Hill tribes who call themselves A'chik or Mande. They are the second-largest tribe in Meghalaya after the Khasi and comprise about a third of the local population. The Garos are one of the few remaining matrilineal societies in the world.\n\nA large part of the Garo community follow Christianity, with some rural pockets following traditional animist religion known as Songsarek and its practices. The book \"The Garo Tribal Religion: Beliefs And Practices\" tries to interpret and expound on the origin and migration of the Garos — consisting of tribal groups who settled in the Garo Hills and their ancient animistic religious beliefs and practices: deities who must be appeased with rituals, ceremonies and animal sacrifices to ensure welfare of the tribe.\n\nThe Garo tribal religion is popularly known as \"Songsarek\". Their tradition \"Dakbewal\" relates to their most prominent cultural activities. In 2003 the group called \"Rishi Jilma\" was founded to safeguard the ancient Garo Songsarek religion. Seeing the Songsarek population in decline, youth from the Dadenggiri subdivision of Garo Hills felt the need to preserve the Songsarek culture. The Rishi Jilma group is active in about 500 villages in and around Garo Hills.\n\nThe Garos are mainly distributed over the Garo Hills, Khasi Hills, Ri-Bhoi Districts in Meghalaya, Kamrup, Goalpara, Sivasagar, Karbi Anglong districts of Assam, Khasi Hills in Meghalaya and Dimapur (Nagaland State), substantial numbers (about 200,000) are found in greater Mymensingh (Tangail, Jamalpur, Sherpore, Netrakona, Mymensingh) and capital Dhaka, Gazipur, Sirajgonj, Rangpur, Sunamganj, Sylhet, and Moulovibazar districts of Bangladesh.\n\nIt is estimated that total Garo population in India and Bangladesh together is about 1 million.\n\nGaros are also found scattered in the Indian state of Tripura. The recorded Garo population was around 6,000 in 1971. In a recent survey conducted by the newly revived Tripura Garo Union revealed that the number has increased to about 15,000, spreading to all the four districts of Tripura.\n\nGaros form minorities in Cooch Behar, Jalpaiguri, Darjeeling and West Dinajpur of West Bengal, as well as in Nagaland. The present generation of Garos forming minorities in these states of India do not speak the ethnic language anymore.\n\nThe Garo language belongs to the Tibeto-Burman language family. The language was not traditionally written down; customs, traditions, and beliefs were handed down orally. It is believed that the written language was lost in its transit to the present Garo Hills. Garo language/script was written on animals skins and tree barks as they had no knowledge of pen and paper yet. While on their quest for hospitable ground, the ancestors experienced famine and were forced to resort to eating the very animal skins and tree barks that held their history, their alphabets or \"oikorrang\". The written language/script was thus lost.\n\nThe Garo language has dialects — A·beng or Am·beng, Matabeng, Atong, Me·gam, Matchi, Dual [Matchi-Dual], Ruga, Chibok, Chisak, Gara, Gan·ching [Gara-Gan·ching], A·we etc. In Bangladesh, A·beng is the usual dialect written in Bengali script, but A·chik is used more in India. A·we has become the standard dialect of the Garos written in Roman script. A·we is used in Garo literature and, hence, for the translation of the Bible. The Garo language has some similarities with Boro-Kachari, Dimasa, and Kok-Borok languages.\n\nThe modern official language in schools and government offices is English.\n\nAccording to one oral tradition, the Garos first immigrated to Garo Hills from Tibet (referred to as Tibotgre) around 400 BC under the leadership of Jappa Jalimpa, crossing the Brahmaputra River and tentatively settling in the river valley. The Garos finally settled down in Garo Hills (East-West Garo Hills), finding providence and security in this uncharted territory and claiming it their own. Records of the tribe by invading Mughal armies and by British observers in what is now Bangladesh wrote of the brutality of the people.\n\nThe earliest written records about the Garo dates from around 1800. They \"...were looked upon as bloodthirsty savages, who inhabited a tract of hills covered with almost impenetrable jungle, the climate of which was considered so deadly as to make it impossible for a white man to live there\" (Playfair 1909: 76-77). The Garo had the reputation of being fierce headhunters, the social status of a man being decided by the number of heads he owned.\n\nIn December 1872, the British sent battalions to Garo Hills to establish their control in the region. The attack was conducted from three sides – south, east, and west. The Garo warriors (\"matgriks\") confronted them at Rongrenggre with their spears, swords, and shields. The battle that ensued was heavily unmatched, as the Garos did not have guns or mortars like the British Army.\n\nLater, a Garo patriot and statesman Sonaram R Sangma fought against the British and tried to unify the contiguous Garo inhabited areas.\n\nThe Garos are one of the few remaining matrilineal societies in the world. The individuals take their clan titles from their mothers. Traditionally, the youngest daughter (\"nokmechik\") inherits the property from her mother. Sons leave the parents' house at puberty and are trained in the village bachelor dormitory (\"nokpante\"). After getting married, the man lives in his wife's house.\n\nIn Garo habitations, the house where unmarried male youth or bachelors live is called Nokpante. The women were forbidden from entering the Nokpante. Any woman who broke this rule was considered tainted or \"marang nangjok\". But this is a thing of the past and all children are given equal care, rights, and importance by the modern parents.\n\nGaros are a matrilineal society but are not to be mistaken to be matriarchal. While the property is owned by women, the men govern the society and domestic affairs and manage the property.\n\nThe Garo people have traditional names. However, the culture of modern Garo community has been greatly influenced by Christianity.\nOrnaments: Both men and women enjoy adorning themselves with ornaments:\n\nWeapons: Garos have their own weapons. One of the principal weapons is a two-edged sword called \"mil·am\" made of one piece of iron from hilt to point. There is a cross-bar between the hilt and the blade where a bunch of ox's tail-hair is attached. The other types of weapons are shield, spear, bow and arrow, axe, dagger, etc.\n\nFood and drink: The staple cereal food is rice. They also eat millet, maize, tapioca etc. Garos are very liberal in their food habits. They rear cows, goats, pigs, fowls, ducks etc. and relish their meat. They eat other wild animal like deer, bison, wild pigs etc. Fish, prawns, crabs, eels and dry fish are a part of their food. Their jhum fields and the forests provide them with vegetables and roots for their curry. Bamboo shoots are esteemed as a delicacy. They use a kind of potash in curries, which they obtain by burning dry pieces of plantain stems or young bamboo locally known as \"kalchi\" or \"katchi\". After they are burnt, the ashes are collected and dipped in water; they are strained in conical shapes in a bamboo strainer. These days most of the townspeople use cooking soda from the market in place of ash water. The Garos make their own liquor by fermenting a special type of rice and the finished product is called \"Minil Bichi\". Besides other drinks, country liquor plays an important role in the life of the Garos.\n\nGaro architecture: Generally one finds similar types of arts and architecture in Garo Hills. They normally use locally available building materials like timbers, bamboo, cane, and thatch. Garo architecture can be classified into the following categories:\n\nThe common and regular festivals are those connected with agricultural operations.\n\nMost Garo festivals are based on the agricultural cycle of crops. The harvesting festival \"Wangala\" is the biggest celebration of the tribe happening in the month of October or November every year. It is the thanksgiving after harvest in the honor of the god \"Saljong\", provider of nature's bounties.\n\nOther festivals include \"Gal·mak Goa\", \"Agalmaka\", etc.\n\nThere is a celebration of the 100-drum festival in Asanang near Tura in West Garo Hills, Meghalaya, India usually in October or November. Thousands of people, especially young people, gather at Asanang and celebrate Wangala with great joy. Beautiful Garo girls known as \"nomil\" and handsome boys \"pante\" take part in 'Wangala' festivals. The pantes beat a kind of long drum called \"dama\" in groups and play bamboo flute. The nomils with colorful costumes dance to the tune of \"dama\" and folk songs in a circle. Most of the folk songs depict ordinary Garo life, God's blessings, beauty of nature, day-to-day struggles, romance, and human aspirations.\n\nThere are 30,000 Garos living in Dhaka. They celebrate their Wangala festival every year with the new spirit as a thanksgiving to the creator. The Garos started the Dhaka Wangala festival in the capital city in 1994 by the leadership of Fr. Cammilus Rema, a professor of National Major Seminary. There were a Nokma Committee for the celebration. The first Kamal was Fr. Cammilus Rema. The committee included Albert Mankin, Topon Marak, Sanjeeb Drong, Nipun Sangma, Theophil Nokrek, Ranjit Ruga, Torun Marak, Premson Mrong and others. At least 10,000 Garos attended the first Dhaka Wangala. At present Garos celebrates three Wangala in Dhaka (Botomly, Gulshan and Banani). The Nokma of Wangala is elected every year. He is the head of the feast. In 2014 Dhaka Wangala was celebrated at Technical School field of Botomly. The chief guest was Adv. Promode Mankin MP, Minister for Social Welfare, People's Republic of Bangladesh. Special guests were Nirmal Rozario, Secretary of Bangladesh Christian Association; and Theophil Nokrek, Ph.D researcher and Director, Caritas Development Institute, Dhaka. More than 15,000 Garos attended. The celebration started with the Wangala mass presided over by Rt. Rev. Bishop Ponen Paul Kubi, csc, Bishop of Mymensingh. The mixed culture Wangala bring together all Garos to one place for worship and thanksgiving to God. The Garos of Bangladesh celebrates Wangala at Abima, Modhupur, Tangail, Durgapur, Netrokona, and Ranikhong as '100 Drums.\n\nThe ancient traditional culture of Garos is disappearing in some areas due to lack of practice and nurturing by society and Government. Some researchers are trying to promote this traditional culture to preserve it in Bangladesh and in India. Rev. Monindronath Marak, Subhash Jengcham, Theophil Nokrek, Sanjeeb Drong, Albert Mankin, Badhon Areng, Babul D' Nokrek, Bashor Dango are trying to research the Garo culture and tradition.\n\nThough Christmas is a religious celebration, December is a great season of celebration in Garo Hills. In the first week of December, the town of Tura and all other smaller towns are illuminated with lights. This celebration featured by worship, dance, merry-making, grand feasts, and social visits goes on till 10 January. People from all religions and sections take part in the Christmas celebration. In December 2003 the tallest Christmas tree of the world was erected at Dobasipara, Tura by the Baptist boys of Dobasipara. Its height was 119.3 feet, covered by BBC and widely broadcast on television. The tree was decorated with 16,319 colored light bulbs; it took about 14 days to complete the decoration.\n\nThe annual festival, conceptualised in 2008, is aimed to promote and brand this part of the region as a popular tourist destination by giving an opportunity for the local people to showcase their skills and expertise. The three-day fest features a gala event with carnival, cultural show, food festival, rock concert, wine festival, angling competition, ethnic wear competition, children's fancy dress, DJ Nite, exhibitions, housie housie, and other games. The entry forms for carnival and other events are available at the Tourist Office, Tura.\n\nSimsang Festival:\nIt was first started in 2006 in Williamnagar, Meghalaya. Simsang festival was known as Winter festival before and it promotes the talents od the local people. It also promotes the local bands and the exhibition on hand crafts made by local people. It also promotes the indigenous games of Garo tribe.\n\nGroup songs may include Ku·dare sala, Hoa ring·a, Injoka, Kore doka, Ajea, Doroa, Nanggorere goserong, Dim dim chong dading chong, Serejing, Boel sala etc.\n\nDance forms are Ajema Roa, Mi Su·a, Chambil Moa, Do·kru Sua, Chame mikkang nia, Kambe Toa, Gaewang Roa, Napsepgrika and many others.\n\nTraditional Garo musical instruments can broadly be classified into four groups.\n\nThe Garos rely on nature. Their profession is hunting and warrior known as Matgrik. They practice jhum cultivation which is the most common agricultural tradition. For more than 4,000 years, the Garos have been practicing jhum cultivation. It was their main profession for feeding themselves.\n\nBut in the last 50 years the most changing scenario of the Garo ethnic people is the changing of professions. They are now influenced and have adapted to the modern technology and professions. They are engaged in Government and non-government jobs. In India Government jobs are most common for the Garos. They might have jobs in schools, colleges, universities, and other educational institutions. In Bangladesh, their jobs are more diverse than in India. Almost 30,000 Garos are living in Dhaka metropolitan city and most of them are working in beauty parlours, EPZ industries, housekeeping, security personnel, driving, NGOs private service, real-estate, garment industries, etc. There is a good number in Bangladesh Civil Service Cedre service. In Dimapur, Nagaland State, the Garo people may work as day labourers.\n\n\nGaro literature mainly transferred from generation to generation and one place to another orally. Most of the oral tradition become the element of Garo literature. One of the oldest book written by Major A. Playfair, \"The Garos\", is a source of information which was published in 1909. Dr. Sinha T.C published a book in 1955 on the Garos: \"The Psyche of Garos\".\n\n"}

{"id": "1820622", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1820622", "title": "Schmidt sting pain index", "text": "Schmidt sting pain index\n\nThe Schmidt sting pain index is a pain scale rating the relative pain caused by different hymenopteran stings. It is mainly the work of Justin O. Schmidt (born 1947), an entomologist at the Carl Hayden Bee Research Center in Arizona. Schmidt has published a number of papers on the subject, and claims to have been stung by the majority of stinging Hymenoptera.\n\nHis original paper in 1983 was a way to systematize and compare the hemolytic properties of insect venoms. A table contained in the paper included a column that rated sting pain, starting from 0 for stings that are completely ineffective against humans, progressing through 2, a familiar pain such as a common bee or wasp sting and finishing at 4 for the most painful stings; in the original paper, only the bullet ant, \"Paraponera clavata\", was given a rating of 4. Later revised versions of the index added \"Synoeca septentrionalis\", along with tarantula hawks as the only species to share this ranking. In later versions, some descriptions of the most painful examples were given, e.g.: \"\"Paraponera clavata\" stings induced immediate, excruciating pain and numbness to pencil-point pressure, as well as trembling in the form of a totally uncontrollable urge to shake the affected part.\"\n\nSchmidt has repeatedly refined his scale, including a paper published in 1990, which classifies the stings of 78 species and 41 genera of Hymenoptera, and culminating in a book published in 2016.\n\nAn entry in \"The Straight Dope\" reported that \"implausibly exact numbers\" which do not appear in any of Schmidt’s published scientific papers were \"wheedled out of him\" by \"Outside\" magazine for an article it published in 1996.\n\nIn September 2015, Schmidt was co-awarded the Ig Nobel Physiology and Entomology prize with Michael Smith, for their Hymenoptera research.\n\nSchmidt's pain scale of Hymenopteran stings is organized into levels, ranging between 1 and 4, with 4 being the most painful. However, insect stings that feel very different can be put into the same level. Thus, later versions of the scale always include a brief description of his experience being stung by each type of insect. \n\nSome of the insect stings Schmidt considers to be at a pain level of 1 include the Southern fire ant, the elongate twig ant, the Western paper wasp, the digger bee, and most small bees. The duration of the pain of insect stings categorized into Pain Level 1 generally is five minutes or less.\n\nSince many small bees are categorized into a pain level of 1, most toxic polypeptides in bee venom are melittin, apamin, and MCD peptide. Melittin is the main toxin of bee venom, and it damages red blood cells and white blood cells. Apamin is a neurotoxin that augments polysynaptic reflexes. MCD peptide destroys mast cells.\n\nFeeling only slight pain, Schmidt has described the sting of a digger bee, categorized into Pain Level 1, as \"almost pleasant, a lover just bit your earlobe a little too hard.\" Also rated into Pain Level 1, Schmidt has described the sting of the sweat bee as \"light, ephemeral, almost fruity. A tiny spark has singed a single hair on your arm.\"\n\nSchmidt sets the sting of the Western honey bee at a pain level of 2 to be the anchoring value, basing his categorization of all other stings on it. He has categorized a variety of wasps, bees, and ants into Pain Level 2, including yellowjackets, the Asiatic honey bee, the trap-jaw ant, and the bald-faced hornet. The duration of the stings in this level is generally between five and ten minutes long. Schmidt categorized the majority of Hymenopteran stings as having a pain level of 2.\n\nThe sting of a termite-raiding ant, categorized as a pain level of 2, has a similar feeling as \"the debilitating pain of a migraine contained in the tip of your finger,\" according to Schmidt. On the contrary, a yellowjacket's sting was described as being \"hot and smoky, almost irreverent. Imagine W. C. Fields extinguishing a cigar on your tongue.\"\n\nMost insects that are characterized as having a pain level of 3 are wasps, including the red paper wasp, the metricus paper wasp, and the velvet ant (which is actually a wasp, not an ant). The duration of the sting pain can range anywhere from one minute (such as the sting of the red paper wasp) to half an hour (such as the sting of the velvet ant). Wasp venom uniquely contains wasp kinin that exhibit kinin-like activity. One of the kinins found in wasp kinin, \"polistes kinin 3\", is found to lead to similar effects on smooth musculature and circulation as bradykinin.\n\nSome ants are also rated at a Pain Level 3, including the giant bull ant and the Maricopa harvester ant. Schmidt considered the sting of the Maricopa harvester ant as having a pain level of 3, describing it as such: \"After eight unrelenting hours of drilling into that ingrown toenail, you find the drill wedged into the toe.\"\n\nPain Level 4 is the highest level in the Schmidt sting pain index. Schmidt's original index rated only one such example, the sting of the bullet ant, as a 4. Schmidt has described the sting as \"pure, intense, brilliant pain...like walking over flaming charcoal with a three-inch nail embedded in your heel.\" The bullet ant's venom primarily contains poneratoxin, a paralyzing neurotoxic peptide.\n\nSchmidt later gave the sting of the tarantula hawk a rating of a 4, which he described as \"blinding, fierce [and] shockingly electric.\" The composition of the tarantula hawk venom is unknown, though the duration of pain from the sting is short-lived, lasting only approximately 5 minutes. \n\nSchmidt also rates the sting of the warrior wasp as a 4, describing it as \"Torture. You are chained in the flow of an active volcano. Why did I start this list?\", saying the pain lasts up to two hours.\n\nThe Schmidt sting pain index arose from the pursuit of a larger hypothesis: that the evolution of sociality in Hymenoptera was dependent on the evolution of venom that was both painful and toxic. Pain is an advertisement of damage in the body, but molecules that produce pain and those that are toxic, and actively cause damage, are not the same. Although the painful signal acts as a deterrent, intelligent predators will learn the dishonesty of this signal with repeated exposure – that there is no real damage being done. For the early Hymenoptera that were primarily solitary, the pain alone would allow them the chance to escape. Furthermore, solitary insects do not provide a high energy reward for predators, and therefore predators do not expend significant effort to hunt them. However, with the evolution of sociality where many Hymenoptera cluster together in colonies, nests become a nutritionally rich and therefore worthwhile target. If there were no defenses, predators would devour the defenseless society, leaving few surviving individuals. Sociality would therefore not be beneficial. In order for sociality to evolve, Hymenoptera needed a defense beyond a painful sting to protect their whole colony. Their sting was an advertisement of damage, and toxicity evolved as its truth. With a toxic sting, and thus the ability to protect against predators, Hymenoptera were able to progress towards sociality and its associated evolutionary benefits of the shared raising of youth, individual task specialization, inter-colony communication, and food storage.\n\nTo approach studying this evolutionary connection between toxicity and sociality, Schmidt recognized there needed to be a quantitative measure with which to score the painfulness of stings. Assays for toxicity are already well characterized and can be quantified, but without the Schmidt sting pain index, there would be no way to relate the amount of sociality to the level of pain, and therefore this hypothesis could not have been studied.\n\nThe Schmidt sting pain index was used in 2015 as the basis for YouTube personality Coyote Peterson to conduct a series of self-induced insect stings on his Brave Wilderness channel. In this modern re-evaluation of the Schmidt index, he discovered findings similar to that of the Starr sting pain scale. Peterson has also been bitten by \"Scolopendra heros\", commonly known as the giant desert centipede, and declared the bite to be worse than anything he has ever experienced from an insect, and more painful than the sting of the bullet ant. He was forced to use a venom extractor and seek medical attention. In the fall of 2018, Peterson took what he said will be his final sting, from \"Polistes carnifex\". He said that the pain lasted for approximately 36 hours, with residual physical effects lasting almost a week; Peterson went on to claim the pain from \"P. carnifex\" was more intense than that of either \"Paraponera clavata\" or the Asian giant hornet. Additionally, the venom appeared to have necrotic properties, as Peterson said the venom destroyed a small area of tissue around the sting site in his left forearm and left Peterson with a permanent scar, something no other insect he has voluntarily taken a sting from has done.\n\nThe Schmidt index is cited in the 2015 film \"Ant-Man\" when the plan to break into Pym Technologies includes the use of bullet ants to distract personnel working there.\n\nSchmidt features in the documentaries \"72 Dangerous Animals Latin America\" (2017) and \"72 Dangerous Animals Asia\" (2018), where he talks about his pain index.\n\nThe History Channel's Kings of Pain features biologist, Adam Thorn, and animal handler, Rob \"Caveman\" Alleva testing not only animals from the Schmidt Pain Index, but wanting to evolve the pain index by using a 10 point scale in three categories (physical damage, pain duration, overall effects). Along with some of the insects listed in the Schmidt Pain Index, the duo also test creatures from other categories of the animal kingdom such as reptiles and marine animals.\n\n\n\n"}

It includes as its northernmost point the town of Berwick-upon-Tweed and stretches south to include the towns of Alnwick and Amble — the Northumberland coast forms its long eastern boundary.

She is also remembered as the person most responsible for the deaths of Nobuyasu and his mother, Ieyasu's wife, the Lady Tsukiyama.\n\nTokuhime was married to Tokugawa Ieyasu's five-year-old son Nobuyasu in 1563, when she herself was only five years old. Her marriage was politically motivated and was used to seal an alliance between Tokugawa Ieyasu and Oda Nobunaga.\n\nAs the years went by, Nobuyasu and Tokuhime became quite attached to each other, though Tokuhime's mother-in-law, the Lady Tsukiyama, made life quite difficult for her and interfered in matters between her and her husband. Lady Tsukiyama was known as a jealous and contrary woman, and even her husband Ieyasu found it difficult to share the same residence as her. Because Tokuhime only gave birth to two daughters, Lady Tsukiyama took a daughter of a Takeda's retainer for Nobuyasu's concubine, and this action was irritating Tokuhime.\n\nAs a young woman, Tokuhime decided to retaliate against Lady Tsukiyama. When Tokuhime was about twenty, she had had enough of her mother-in-law's interference and wrote a letter to her father, Oda Nobunaga, conveying her suspicion that Lady Tsukiyama had been in correspondence with Takeda Katsuyori, one of Nobunaga's worst enemies. Nobunaga relayed this suspicion of betrayal to his ally Ieyasu, who promptly had his wife imprisoned. As Ieyasu needed to maintain his alliance with Nobunaga, the accusations were taken quite seriously, and as Lady Tsukiyama and her son were quite close, Ieyasu therefore had Nobuyasu put into custody. No solid evidence of treachery was ever produced, but to assuage his ally, Ieyasu had his wife executed in 1579. Ieyasu did not believe his son would betray him, but to prevent him from seeking vengeance for the death of his mother, he ordered Nobuyasu to commit suicide by \"seppuku\" where he was held at Futamata Castle. Although Tokuhime wanted only to anonymously retaliate against Lady Tsukiyama, the situation snowballed, and by the end of 1579, her husband and her mother-in-law were dead and she was a widow.\n\n"}

New York lost its starting goaltender from the previous season because of the enlistment of regular goaltender Sugar Jim Henry. To replace him, Rangers' manager Lester Patrick hoped to obtain the services of minor-leaguer Omer Kelly, but he was fixed in a wartime manufacturing job in Baltimore. Buzinski was invited to try out for the team in training camp, and did well enough to be named the starter going into the regular season.\n\nBehind a notably weak Rangers lineup which had only Ott Heller from its previous lineup on defense, and which spent most of the season in last place, Buzinski fared poorly, allowing 55 goals in his nine games as the team's starting goaltender. He provoked several colorful anecdotes, among which was in making his first save in a game, to the glove side, and telling Heller \"Nothing like it, Ott, just like picking apples off a tree\" before going on to surrender ten goals in that match.\n\nWhile his worst record came in the season's first four games - in which he allowed 33 goals, including a 10-4 loss to the Montreal Canadiens on November 8, otherwise notable for surrendering Maurice Richard's first NHL goal, and a 12-5 loss to Detroit in which Red Wings star Carl Liscombe set the then-NHL record for points in a game with 7 - after an 8-6 loss to the Toronto Maple Leafs on November 28, Rangers' management had had enough. Replaced with Jimmy Franks, Buzinski was demoted to the Rangers' AHL New Haven Eagles farm team on December 3 to practice with the club, with coach Frank Boucher saying, \"If they think enough of him, he will get a chance to show what he can do in a regular game.\" Buzinski subsequently enlisted, never playing another professional game, and after the war returned to the Swift Current Indians senior team, where he played until retiring from organized hockey in 1953.\n\nBuzinzki finished his NHL career with a record of 2-6-1 and a 6.10 goals against average. His second and final win, a 5-3 victory over the Chicago Black Hawks on November 10, was noteworthy in that it was the last regular-season overtime game played for over 40 years. League president Frank Calder eliminated them 11 days later as part of wartime cutbacks. They were restored in 1983.\n\nIn civilian life, Buzinski worked for 41 years as a plant breeder for Agriculture Canada during and after his hockey career, as well as coaching hockey at the intermediate level. The nickname \"The Puck Goes Inski\" is associated with Buzinski, but there are no contemporaneous uses of the moniker, which appears to have been invented by hockey writer Stan Fischler sometime in the 1970s. Buzinski's own comment on the origin of the nickname was \"I have no idea at all. A lot of this is a figment of somebody's imagination.\"\n\n"}

It serves as a link between Cape Town in South Africa and Port Said in Egypt.\n\nImportant parts of its intended course to cross Africa are incomplete or inoperative due to wars, lack of financial capital, geographic and geological obstacles, and low political will.\n\nThis plan was initiated at the end of the 19th century, during the time of Western colonial rule, largely under the vision of Cecil Rhodes, in the attempt to connect adjacent African possessions of the British Empire through a continuous line from Cape Town, South Africa to Cairo, Egypt.\n\nThe original proposal for a Cape to Cairo railway was made in 1874 by Edwin Arnold, then the editor of the \"Daily Telegraph\", which was joint sponsor of the expedition by H.M. Stanley to Africa to discover the course of the Congo River. The proposed route involved a mixture of railway and river transport between Elizabethville, now Lubumbashi in the Belgian Congo and Sennar in the Sudan rather than a completely rail one.\n\nImperialist and entrepreneur Cecil Rhodes was instrumental in securing the southern states of the continent for the British Empire and envisioned a continuous \"red line\" of British dominions from north to south. A railway would be a critical element in this scheme to unify the possessions, facilitate governance, enable the military to move quickly to hot spots or conduct war, help settlement and enable intra- and extra-continental goods trade. The construction of this project presented a major technological challenge.\n\nFrance had a somewhat rival strategy in the late 1890s to link its western and eastern African colonies, namely Senegal to Djibouti. Southern Sudan and Ethiopia were in the way, but France sent expeditions in 1897 to establish a protectorate in southern Sudan and to find a route across Ethiopia. The scheme foundered when a British flotilla on the River Nile confronted the French expedition at the point of intersection between the French and British routes, leading to the Fashoda Incident and eventual French retreat.\n\nThe Portuguese considered an Angola to Mozambique railway to link west with east and produced the \"Pink Map\" representing their claims to sovereignty in Africa (to link Angola and Mozambique).\n\nOpposition to British rule in South Africa was settled after the First and Second Boer Wars (ended 1902 but only incorporating its two states into a union Republic in 1910).\n\nEgypt has a rail system that as early as 1854 connected Port Said, Alexandria and Cairo, and that currently goes as far south as Aswan. In Egypt the railway is . After a ferry link up on the Nile, the railway continues in Sudan from Wadi Halfa to Khartoum at the meter gauge; see Northern Africa Railroad Development. This part of the system was started by Lord Kitchener in 1897 when he subjugated the Mahdist uprising. Further railway links go south, the most southern point being Wau.\n\nSouth Sudan became independent in 2011. The border between Sudan and South Sudan is closed, and the railways in South Sudan are no longer operational.\n\nMost of Sudan's railway network is in disrepair due to political turmoil and US sanctions. A Khartoum–Atbara train began running in 2014 after China provided equipment and supplies. Other trains have been put into operation in the vicinity of Khartoum.\n\nBritish interests had to overcome obstacles of geography and climate, and the competing imperial schemes of the French and Portuguese mentioned above and of the Germans. In 1891, Germany secured the strategically critical territory of German East Africa, which along with the mountainous rainforest of the Belgian Congo precluded the building of a Cape-to-Cairo railway.\n\nIn 1916 during World War I British and British Indian soldiers won the Tanganyika Territory from the Germans and after the war the British continued to rule the territory, which was a League of Nations mandate from 1922. The continuous line of colonies was complete. The British Empire possessed the political power to complete the Cape to Cairo Railway, but economics, including the Great Depression of the 1930s, prevented its completion before World War II. After World War II, the decolonisation of Africa and the establishment of independent countries removed the colonial rationale for the project and increased the project's difficulty, effectively ending the project.\n\nCurrently operational length is out of total \nThe operational sections of the Cape to Cairo Railway are as follows:\n\nEast Africa has a network of narrow gauge railways that historically grew from ports on the Indian Ocean and went westward, built in parallel under British and German colonial rule. The furthest string north was the Uganda Railway. Eventually these networks were linked, so that today there is a continuous rail connection between Kampala, Uganda, on Lake Victoria to the coastal cities of Mombasa in Kenya and Dar es Salaam in Tanzania. Up to the break-up of the East African Community in 1977, these companies operated as East African Railways, but operate today as different national companies: the Uganda Railways Corporation Uganda railways corporation's assets were sold over 13 years ago when government failed to run the corporation, as the cost of running it was greater than the returns. Today, railway business in Uganda is run by Rift Valley Railways of Kenya, the Kenya Railways Corporation, and the Tanzania Railways Corporation.\n\nFrom Dar es Salaam, a 1,860 km link to Kapiri Mposhi in Zambia was completed after six years by workers and with main funding by China in 1976. This Tanzania-Zambia-Railway (TAZARA) was built to connect landlocked Zambia and its mineral wealth to a port on the Indian Ocean, independent from port connections in South Africa, a frequent rival economic competitor in the mining sectors or Mozambique, at that time Portuguese-controlled territory. Not intended in the grand picture of the Cape to Cairo Railway, the TAZARA fills a critical link.

He holds a University Professorship at the New York University School of Law and was formerly the Chichele Professor of Social and Political Theory at All Souls College, Oxford University. Waldron also holds an adjunct professorship at Victoria University of Wellington. Waldron is regarded as one of the world's leading legal and political philosophers.\n\nWaldron attended Southland Boys' High School, and then went on to study at the University of Otago, New Zealand, where he graduated with a B.A. in 1974 and an LL.B. in 1978. He later studied for a D.Phil. at Lincoln College, Oxford under legal philosopher Ronald Dworkin and political theorist Alan Ryan; Waldron graduated in 1986.\n\nHe also taught legal and political philosophy at Otago (1975–78), Lincoln College, Oxford (1980–82), the University of Edinburgh, Scotland (1983–87), the Jurisprudence and Social Policy Program at Boalt Hall School of Law at Berkeley (1986–96), Princeton University (1996–97), and Columbia Law School (1997–2006). He has also been a visiting professor at Cornell (1989–90), Otago (1991–92) and Columbia (1995) Universities. Currently at NYU he teaches Rule of Law, Jurisprudence, seminars on Property and Human Dignity and regularly hosts the Colloquium on Legal, Social and Political Philosophy, founded by Ronald Dworkin and Thomas Nagel in 1987, and currently convened by Liam Murphy, Samuel Scheffler, and Waldron.\n\nWaldron gave the second series of Seeley Lectures at Cambridge University in 1996, the 1999 Carlyle Lectures at Oxford, the spring 2000 University Lecture at Columbia Law School, the Wesson Lectures at Stanford University in 2004, the Storrs Lectures at Yale Law School in 2007, and the Gifford Lectures at the University of Edinburgh in 2015. He was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1998.\n\nIn 2005, Waldron received an honorary doctorate from the University of Otago, his alma mater.\n\nIn 2019 a Professorial Chair in Jurisprudence was created in his name at the University of Otago.\n\nWaldron is a liberal and a normative legal positivist. He has written extensively on the analysis and justification of private property and on the political and legal philosophy of John Locke. He is an outspoken opponent of judicial review and of torture, both of which he believes to be in tension with democratic principles. He believes that hate speech should not be protected by the First Amendment. His later work is devoted to providing a non-religious and non-Kantian concept of human dignity, based on a thought experiment of leveling up all human beings to the high rank of nobility or aristocracy, thus constituting a single rank or caste. He has been working on this topic since he gave the Tanner Lectures on the subject in 2009, published in 2012 as \"Dignity, Rank and Rights\".\n\nWaldron has also criticised analytic legal philosophy for its failure to engage with the questions addressed by political theory.\n\nSandrine Baume has identified Jeremy Waldron and Bruce Ackerman as leading critics of the \"compatibility of judicial review with the very principles of democracy\". Baume identified John Hart Ely alongside Dworkin as the foremost defenders of this principle in recent years, while the opposition to this principle of \"compatibility\" were identified as Bruce Ackerman and Jeremy Waldron. In contrast to Waldron and Ackerman, Dworkin was a long-time advocate of a moral reading of the United States Constitution, whose lines of support he sees as strongly associated with enhanced versions of judicial review in the federal government.\n\nA staunch defender of the principle of democratic legislation, in an article titled \"The Core of the Case against Judicial Review\", Waldron has argued for a limited role for judicial review in a robust democratic government. Waldron asserts that there is no inherent advantage to a judiciary's protection of rights than to a legislature's if (1) there is a broadly democratic political system with appropriate suffrage and process, (2) there is a system of courts somewhat insulated from popular pressure and engaged in judicial review, there is a general commitment to rights, and there is disagreement as to the content and extent of rights. Even so, Waldron does not argue against the existence of judicial review, which may be appropriate when there is institutional dysfunction. In this case, the defense of judicial review compatible with democracy is limited to remedies for that dysfunction and are neither unlimited nor universal. Thus Waldron places his view of judicial review in the tradition of Justice Harlan Fiske Stone.\n\nIn a review of a 2015 book by Cass Sunstein, Waldron has stated that between the polarity represented by judges who can be \"heroic\" in the interpretation of their judgments and those who abstain, that his preference would be sympathetic to a position which could be described as \"judicial minimalism\". Waldron states his examples of such judges as including Sandra O'Connor, Ruth Ginsburg, and Felix Frankfurter.\n\nBooks\nArticles\n\n"}
{"id": "1820705", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1820705", "title": "Michael Musmanno", "text": "Michael Musmanno\n\nMichael Angelo Musmanno (April 7, 1897 – October 12, 1968) was an American jurist, politician, and naval officer. Coming from an immigrant family, he started to work as a coal loader at the age of 14. After serving in the United States Army in World War I, he obtained a law degree from Georgetown University. For nearly two decades from the early 1930s, he served as a judge in courts of Allegheny County, Pennsylvania. Entering the United States Navy during World War II, he served in the military justice system. After the war in 1946 he served as military governor of an occupied district in Italy. Beginning in 1947, he served as a presiding judge for the Einsatzgruppen trial in US military court at Nuremberg.\n\nIn 1951 he was elected as a justice of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, where he served until his death in 1968. He set a record for the number of dissenting opinions filed. In addition to his long judicial career and postwar contributions in Europe, he wrote sixteen books and many articles related to his court cases and professional career. In his writing he expressed sympathy for working men and deep interest in the Italians in the United States.\n\nViewed as a \"maverick on the court\", Musmanno was known for defending Sacco and Vanzetti, as well as for being anti-Communist, and for supporting civil rights. At the time of his death he was regarded as \"one of Pennsylvania's most respected and colorful figures\".\n\nMusmanno was born into an ethnic Italian family in Stowe Township, in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, an industrial neighborhood a few miles west of Pittsburgh. He worked with his father in the coal mines, began law school at Georgetown University in 1915, leaving to serve as an infantryman in World War I before returning to earn an LL.B. degree in 1918 at Georgetown. Afterwards he earned B.A. and M.A. degrees at George Washington University, and two master of law degrees at the National University School of Law (later merged with George Washington University Law School). He became a labor lawyer and always kept a sympathy for the working man.\n\nAfter entering law practice in 1923 as a lawyer in his native Stowe Township, Musmanno got also involved in politics. In 1926, he ran for election to the Pennsylvania House of Representatives on the Republican ticket, but lost. As he was genuinely interested in the plight of the working man, and was sympathetic to the Italian Americans and other ethnic minorities who worked in great numbers in Pennsylvania industries, Musmanno volunteered to serve as an appellate attorney during the Sacco-Vanzetti case and moved to Boston. The men were convicted in 1921, in an atmosphere of anti-immigrant feeling. The appeals upheld the lower court decision, and Sacco and Vanzetti were sentenced to death in 1927. Haunted by the conduct of the trial, Musmanno wrote \"After Twelve Years\" (1939), a book about the case, as well as two articles in 1963, published in \"The New Republic\" and the \"Kansas Law Review\".\n\nAfter returning, Musmanno was elected in 1928 as a Republican state legislator for Pennsylvania serving in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives. He was reelected in 1930.\n\nWhen miner John Barkoski was beaten to death in Imperial, Pennsylvania in 1929 by the Coal and Iron Police during a strike, Musmanno was outraged and, as a state legislator, introduced a bill to banish this private police force. The bill was vetoed by a Republican Pennsylvania governor, which led to Musmanno's resignation. He published a short story about the case, entitled \"Jan Volkanik.\" This was adapted in part as the basis of the film \"Black Fury\" (1935), starring Paul Muni as a coal miner, and with a screenplay written by Abem Finkel and Carl Erickson. It was directed by Michael Curtiz.\n\nIn 1931, Musmanno became the youngest judge in the county court of Allegheny County; he was nominated by both Democrats and Republicans and endorsed by the labor organizations. He switched to the Democratic Party in 1932 while canvassing for Franklin D. Roosevelt as a president. In 1933 he served as a judge of the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County.\n\nIn 1943 he took a leave from his judicial duties to take part in World War II. After returning to Pittsburgh in 1948, he was appointed as a judge in the common pleas court, where he served until 1951.\n\nIn 1943, during World War II, Musmanno entered the United States Navy as a line officer assigned as a military attorney, since the navy had not yet formed its own Judge Advocate General's Corps (an action not taken until 1967). In this capacity, he eventually rose to the rank of rear admiral. He served as Allied Military Governor of the Sorrentine Peninsula in Italy.\n\nIn 1946, he was appointed head of the three-person Board of Soviet Repatriation of Displaced Persons in Austria. He opposed the forcible repatriation to the Soviet Union of Cossacks and refugees, many of whom did not want to be repatriated. He was successful in aiding some of these people. Later it was learned that Stalin's government persecuted many of these returnees, condemning many to internal exile or the harsh labor camps of the gulag in Siberia, where they died.\nBeginning in 1947, Musmanno was presiding judge at the Einsatzgruppen trial of the United States Nuremberg Military Tribunal, held in Nuremberg for men charged with killing more than a million people behind the front lines, including Jews, Poles, and minorities. He also served as a member of the court during the military trials of Milch and Pohl. In 1961 Musmanno testified as a prosecution witness in Jerusalem in the Israeli trial of Adolf Eichmann.\n\nIn 1948 Musmanno conducted interviews, with the help of a simultaneous interpreter named Elisabeth Billig, with several people who had worked closely with Adolf Hitler in the very last days of World War II. These served as the basis of his book, \"Ten Days to Die\" (1950). These interviews were filmed but were lost to history until early 2013 when a copy was discovered in the archives of Duquesne University.\n\nMusmanno tried to re-enter politics, running unsuccessfully for Lieutenant Governor in 1950. He resumed his judicial career.\n\nA strong anti-Communist in the postwar years, Musmanno was an unofficial spokesman for the local Americans Battling Communism. He was noted for testifying for the prosecution in the 1950 anti-Communist sedition case against Steve Nelson, who was leading a regional branch of the American Communist Party. The Communists had sold political tracts (available at any library) for $5.75 to Musmanno, who declared their store \"the equivalent of an advance post of the Red Army.\" Nelson initially was sentenced to 20-years in prison, $10,000 in fines and $13,000 in prosecution costs. The Supreme Court of the United States ultimately threw out the case and the Pennsylvania and other state anti-sedition laws, saying federal law superseded the state law under which Nelson was prosecuted.\n\nMusmanno gained name recognition from his part in the Nelson trial. He was elected in 1951 as justice to the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, serving from 1952 to his death in 1968. During his long career on the bench, he \"became known as an advocate for the underdog.\"\n\nHe also was noted for his dissenting opinions; during his first 5 years on the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, he wrote more dissenting opinions than all of the other justices on the court had collectively written in the previous 50 years. When asked if he read Musmanno's dissenting opinions, Pennsylvania Chief Justice Horace Stern said he was not \"interested in current fiction.\" Not long afterward, however, the court issued a ruling in which this Justice participated, and the wording was unquestionably similar to that in one of Musmanno's dissenting opinions. In \"Perpetua v. Philadelphia Transportation Company,\" Musmanno wrote the dissenting opinion, while in \"Koehler v. Schwartz,\" he wrote the prevailing opinion, in which Stern joined him. In a book about personal injury suits and these cases, the attorney Melvin Belli added that Chief Justice Stern \"lived to regret\" his insulting remark.\nIn one case, because Musmanno had failed to circulate a dissenting opinion among the other justices before he filed it, the piece was not published in the official Pennsylvania State Reports. He sought a writ of mandamus to require its publication. The trial court denied the writ. When the Pennsylvania Supreme Court heard the case, Musmanno represented himself as plaintiff; the Court affirmed the lower court's decision.\n\nWhile a controversial figure for such actions, Musmanno was noted as having wonderful \"pro-labor credentials.\" In addition, during the 1960s he supported civil rights marchers.\n\nMusmanno appeared as himself on the February 12, 1962 episode of To Tell the Truth. He received all four votes.\n\nMusmanno strongly dissented from a 1966 ruling that Henry Miller's book \"Tropic of Cancer\" was not obscene. He wrote:\n\n\"Cancer\" is not a book. It is a cesspool, an open sewer, a pit of putrefaction, a slimy gathering of all that is rotten in the debris of human depravity. And in the center of all this waste and stench, besmearing himself with its foulest defilement, splashes, leaps, cavorts and wallows a bifurcated specimen that responds to the name of Henry Miller. One wonders how the human species could have produced so lecherous, disgusting and amoral a human being as Henry Miller. One wonders why he is received in polite society. ...\n\nMusmanno was a gifted narrator and wrote a total of sixteen books, some reflecting his court cases. He described the sedition case in his book, \"Across the Street from the Courthouse\" (1954). Other works include a 30-page transcript of his 1932 debate with Clarence Darrow on immortality in Pittsburgh, \"The Story of Italians in America\" (1965), and \"Glory & The Dream: Abraham Lincoln, Before and After Gettysburg\" (1967). In 1966 he published a novel version of the 1935 film, \"Black Fury\", by the same name.\n\nHe was very proud of his Italian heritage. Among the books he wrote was one arguing that Christopher Columbus was the first European to discover the New World. This was in reaction to scholarly research showing that the Vikings had reached the northeast coast of North America before Columbus' time.\n\nThe judge was a lifelong Catholic and attended the Mount St. Peter Church in New Kensington. On 11 November 1951, he was the first lay orator to read from the pulpit of the newly dedicated building.\n\nMusmanno was intensely religious. The last of his many dissenting opinions was against overturning an assault/attempted rape conviction in a case in which the trial judge instructed the jury to seek God's guidance in reaching their decision. He wrote in his dissent:\n\nI was afraid it would come to this. It is becoming the fashion to make light of religious invocation. Books are being published asking whether God is dead. Well, God is not dead, and judges who criticize the invocation of Divine Assistance had better begin preparing a brief to use when they stand themselves at the Eternal Bar of Justice on Judgment Day.\n\nJustice Musmanno concluded:\n\"I am perfectly willing to take my chances with [the trial judge] at the gates of Saint Peter and answer on our 'voir dire' that we were always willing to invoke the name of the Lord in seeking counsel in rendering a grave decision on earth, which I believe the one in this case to be.\"\n– \"Miserere nobis Omnipotens Deus!\"\n\nJustice Musmanno died the following day, October 12, 1968, Columbus Day.\n\n\nCatalogue entries of his writings are available at Hathi Trust Digital Library.\n\n\n\n"}

He attended grammar school in Stuttgart and studied medicine at University of Tübingen. He graduated at the age of 23, and subsequently worked at the medical department of the University of Leipzig in 1869, and served as a medic in the German army during the Franco-Prussian War in 1870. He returned to the University of Leipzig in 1875.\n\nWhile at Leipzig, he treated a Japanese exchange student, which led to the offer by the Japanese government of a two-year contract with the Medical College of Tokyo Imperial University in 1876. Bälz’s contract was renewed several times, and he ended up spending 27 years in Japan, the longest of any of the \"Oyatoi gaikokujin\" advisors. In 1881, he married a Japanese woman, Toda Hanako, and had four children.\n\nIn the summer of 1899, Bälz visited the Korean capital Seoul and Busan and undertook ethnological investigations. From 22 April to 3 July 1903, he was again in Korea and, together with Richard Wunsch, undertook an expedition into the interior of the country.\n\nIn 1902, he was appointed personal physician-in-waiting to Emperor Meiji and the Imperial household of Japan.\n\nBälz taught more than 800 students in Western medicine during his tenure at the Tokyo Imperial University. During his stay in Japan, he treated some of the most influential men in the Meiji government, including Prime Ministers Itō Hirobumi and Yamagata Aritomo. On Bälz's initiative, the volcanic springs of Kusatsu (200 km away from Tokyo) were transformed into the most successful hot spring resort of Japan. He compared the area with the European spa resort of Karlsbad, and felt that mountainous air, as well as the clear waters, was very conducive to health.\n\nAnother medical contribution was the discovery and naming of \"Mongolian spot\". Finding an unrecorded feature of blue spots in Japanese babies, he thought these spots were characteristic of people of Mongolian origin.\n\nIn 1905, Bälz returned to Germany with his family. In Stuttgart, late in the summer of 1913, Bälz succumbed to heart disease.\n\nBälz was also an ardent art collector; the majority of the Japanese works collected by him are located at the Linden Museum in Stuttgart. A stone sculpture at University of Tübingen is a reminder of his contributions to Japanese medical science. In 1961, a sister city relationship between Kusatsu and Bietigheim-Bissingen was established.\n\nAfter his death, his diary \"Das Leben eines deutschen Arztes im erwachenden Japan\" (1931, tr. \"The Diary of a German Doctor in Awakening Japan\") was published, giving unique insights into Japan in the Meiji era.\n\nIn 1883, while staying at the Fujiya Hotel in Miyanoshita, Hakone, Bälz noticed that his maid's hands were chapped. He made a mixture of glycerin and water for her, which was later sold widely in Japan under the name of \"Bälz Water\". It is also listed in the Japan \"Pharmacopoeia\".\n\nDuring his time in Japan, Bälz became a fan of judo, and is credited with introducing the sport to Germany.\n\nIn the year 2000, a commemorative museum honoring Bälz was erected in Kusatsu.\n"}
{"id": "1820716", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1820716", "title": "Whiteboys", "text": "Whiteboys\n\nThe Whiteboys () were a secret Irish agrarian organisation in 18th-century Ireland which used violent tactics to defend tenant farmer land rights for subsistence farming. Their name derives from the white smocks the members wore in their nightly raids. As they levelled the fences at night, they were usually referred to at the time as \"Levellers\" by the authorities, and by themselves as \"Queen Sive Oultagh's children\" (\"Sive\" or \"Sieve Oultagh\" being anglicised from the Irish \"Sadhbh Amhaltach\", or Ghostly Sally), \"fairies\", or as followers of \"Johanna Meskill\" or \"Sheila Meskill\", all symbolic figures supposed to lead the movement. They sought to address rack-rents, tithe collection, excessive priests' dues, evictions and other oppressive acts. As a result they targeted landlords and tithe collectors. Over time, \"Whiteboyism\" became a general term for rural violence connected to secret societies. Because of this generalisation, the historical record for the Whiteboys as a specific organisation is unclear. There were three major outbreaks of Whiteboyism: 1761–64; 1770–76; and 1784–86.\n\nBetween 1735 and 1760 there was an increase in land used for grazing and beef cattle, in part because pasture land was exempt from tithes. The landlords, having let their lands far above their value, on condition of allowing the tenants the use of certain commons, now enclosed the commons, but did not lessen the rent. As more landlords and farmers switched to raising cattle, labourers and small tenant farmers were forced off the land. The Whiteboys developed as a secret oath-bound society among the peasantry. Whiteboy disturbances had occurred prior to 1761 but were largely restricted to isolated areas and local grievances, so that the response of local authorities had been limited, either through passive sympathy or, more likely, because of the exposed nature of their position in the largely Roman Catholic countryside.\n\nTheir operations were chiefly in the counties of Waterford, Cork, Limerick, and Tipperary. This combination was not political: it was not directed against the government, but against the local landlords. Members of different religious affiliations took part.\n\nThe first major outbreak occurred in County Limerick in November 1761 and quickly spread to counties Tipperary, Cork, and Waterford. A great deal of organisation and planning seems to have been put into the outbreak, including the holding of regular assemblies. Initial activities were limited to specific grievances and the tactics used non-violent, such as the levelling of ditches that closed off common grazing land, although cattle hamstringing was often practised as the demand for beef had prompted large landowners to initiate the process of enclosure. As their numbers increased, the scope of Whiteboy activities began to widen, and proclamations were clandestinely posted under such names as \"Captain Moonlight\", stipulating demands such as that rent not be paid, that land with expired leases not be rented until it had lain fallow for three years, and that no one pay or collect tithes demanded by the Anglican Church. Threatening letters were also sent to debt collectors, landlords, and occupants of land gained from eviction, demanding that they give up their farms.\n\nAs well as the digging up of ley lands and orchards, they also searched houses for guns, and demanded money in order to purchase guns and defray the expenses of Whiteboys standing trial.\n\nMarch 1762 saw a further escalation of Whiteboy activities, with marches in military array preceded by the music of bagpipes or the sounding of horns. At Cappoquin they fired guns and marched by the military barracks playing the Jacobite tune \"The lad with the white cockade\". These processions were often preceded by notices saying that Queen Sive and her children would make a procession through part of her domain and demanded that the townspeople illuminate their houses and provide their horses, ready saddled, for their use. More militant activities often followed such processions with unlit houses in Lismore attacked, prisoners released in an attack on Tallow jail and similar shows of strength in Youghal.\n\nThe events of March 1761, however, prompted a more determined response, and a considerable military force under the Charles, Marquess of Drogheda was sent to Munster to crush the Whiteboys.\n\nOn 2 April 1761 a force of 50 militia men and 40 soldiers set out for Tallow, \"\"where they took (mostly in their beds) eleven Levellers, against whom Information on Oath was given\".\" Other raids took 17 Whiteboys west of Bruff, in County Limerick and by mid April at least 150 suspected Whiteboys had been arrested. Clogheen in County Tipperary bore the initial brunt of this assault as the local parish priest, Fr. Nicholas Sheehy, had earlier spoken out against tithes and collected funds for the defence of parishioners charged with rioting. An unknown numbers of \"insurgents\" were reported killed in the \"pacification exercise\" and Fr. Sheehy was unsuccessfully indicted for sedition several times before eventually being found guilty of a charge of accessory to murder, and hanged in Clonmel in March 1766.\n\nIn the cities, suspected Whiteboy sympathisers were arrested and in Cork, citizens formed an association of about 2,000 strong which offered rewards of £300 for capture of the chief Whiteboy and £50 for the first five sub-chiefs arrested and often accompanied the military on their rampages. The leading Catholics in Cork also offered similar rewards of £200 and £40 respectively.\n\nHowever, Lord Halifax was soon expressing concern that the repression was going too far: \"\"so many People are directly or indirectly concerned in these illegal Practices and so many have been seized on Information or Suspicion, that in several Places, the Majority of the Inhabitants have been struck with the utmost Consternation, and have fled to the Mountains, insomuch that at this Season, from the almost general Flight of the labouring Hands, a Famine is, not without Reason, apprehended.\"\". Similarly, the \"Dublin Journal\" reported at the same time that the south east part of Tipperary \"is almost waste, and the Houses of many locked up, or inhabited by Women and old Men only; such has been the Terror the Approach of the Light Dragoons has thrown them into.\"\n\nIn the aftermath of the 1798 rebellion agrarian agitation swept Munster.\n\nIn 1822 a group of about fifty attacked the house of a Mr. Bolster near Athlacca, where they damaged the house, broke the windows, and took his musket.\n\nActs passed by the Parliament of Ireland (to 1800) and Parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland (from 1801) to empower the authorities to combat Whiteboyism were commonly called \"Whiteboy Acts\".\n\nIn Thomas Flanagan's novel The Year of the French, the \"Whiteboys of Killala\" are referenced many times. Many of the Whiteboys are central characters within the story. Led by Malachi Duggan, the Whiteboys attempt to reverse their oppressed state through guerrilla acts in County Mayo. Following the landing of a French force under Humbert in 1798, some local Whiteboys join the rebellion against the British and fought alongside United Irishmen and French soldiers.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1820718", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1820718", "title": "Lotus (video game series)", "text": "Lotus (video game series)\n\nThe Lotus series consists of three racing computer games based around the Lotus brand: Lotus Esprit Turbo Challenge, Lotus Turbo Challenge 2, and Lotus III: The Ultimate Challenge. Published between 1990 and 1992 by Gremlin Graphics, the games gained very favourable reviews upon release. Original Amiga versions of the games were created by Shaun Southern and Andrew Morris of Magnetic Fields, and then ported by other individuals to several other computers and game consoles.\n\nThe first game in the series was released in 1990 for most popular contemporary 8-bit and 16-bit computer systems, the Amiga and Atari ST versions being the most technically advanced. The game allowed the player to race a Lotus Esprit Turbo SE car through several (32 in the Amiga version) circuit race tracks of varying scenery. Two player simultaneous play (with split screen) was also provided, and a choice of audio tracks to accompany races.\n\nEach track is lap-based and consists of turns of varying degrees, as well as hills and hollows which slow down or speed up the car passing through them. Each turn is indicated by a chain of road-side signs, and the difficulty of the turn is reflected by the number and density of these signs - a feature common to all titles in the \"Lotus\" series.\n\nWhile racing, the players must manage their fuel supply, occasionally visiting the pit stop for refuelling. Also apart from overtaking the other cars, the racers must avoid various hazards and obstacles. These are dependent on the scenery the track is located in, and include slippery road on the winter courses, road blocks, slippery puddles and wooden logs.\n\nThe tracks are split into three race series, with different difficulty levels. In each race the player or players compete against 20 opponents. The goal is to finish each race on the highest possible position; if the player finishes a race within the first 10 places they qualify for the next race and receive points towards a final position on the high-score table. The names of the computer-controlled drivers are puns on the names of real-life racers of the time (\"Ayrton Sendup\", \"Nijel Mainsail\" and \"Alain Phosphate\" for example).\n\nUnusually, the player's starting position in each race is the exact opposite of the position reached at the end of the previous one. This gives weaker players a chance to improve by starting in a higher position.\n\nIn the Amiga version entering MONSTER and SEVENTEEN as names of players 1 and 2 respectively, reveals a hidden mini-game - a simple space-themed shooter, where the objective is to survive as long as possible while shooting rocks that fly around.\n\n\"Lotus Esprit Turbo Challenge\" was well received by the gaming press, which praised its feeling of speed, technical quality and two-player gameplay. The game in all its versions was rated around 80-90%. It was the only title in the series that was released for an 8-bit platform - the later ones were 16-bit only.\n\nThe ZX Spectrum version was voted number 17 in the \"Your Sinclair Readers' Top 100 Games of All Time\".\n\nThe second Lotus game shifted focus to arcade-oriented gameplay. Being the first of the series released for a game console (for Sega Genesis/Mega Drive under the title Lotus Turbo Challenge), the fuel limit and difficulty levels were dropped, and the lap-based levels were replaced with course-based time trials, (not unlike arcade games such as \"Out Run\"), with the player required to complete each course within a specified time to qualify for the next one.\n\nIn addition to the Esprit Turbo SE, \"Lotus Turbo Challenge 2\" also featured the Lotus Elan SE, hence 'Esprit' being dropped from the title. There was no choice of car however; the player runs with the Elan SE on odd levels, and with the Esprit on even levels.\n\nLotus 2's single-player mode uses all of the game screen instead of half, and opponent cars appear in a variety of colors (opponent cars in the original game were all white). However, music is absent from racing altogether; the player instead hears the car's engine sound.\n\n\"Lotus 2\" was developed for the Amiga and then converted for the other platforms.\n\nBarry Leitch's intro music for \"Lotus 2\" is often found on playlists of retro computer music webradio stations; it contains a subliminal message in the form of a sampled voice at around the 12-second mark (played through the left channel only) which says \"you will not copy this game\". The sample is played very quietly during the first few bars, and can be easily accessed in any MOD tracker program. The hi-hat and voice sample at the very beginning of the main theme is taken from Yello's \"Oh Yeah\", a song that became famous as the theme for another sports car (a Ferrari 250 GT California) in the movie \"Ferris Bueller's Day Off\".\n\n\"Lotus 2\" uses a password system to access different races - once the player qualifies for a particular race, the password is revealed. Additionally, a rendition of Shaun Southern's early creation \"Kwazy Kwaks\", originally published for the Commodore VIC-20 in 1984, is accessed by using the password DUX.\n\nThere is a touch of humour on level six (the motorway level) of the Amiga version: if the player manages to successfully drive under the trailer of one of the lorries that cross the road, the in-game announcer shouts \"Yeehaa!\" This sound was used as a taunt on the Genesis port.\n\nThe Amiga and Atari ST versions are able to use the serial port and connect to another computer (you can link 2 Amiga, 2 Atari ST or an Amiga and an Atari ST) running Lotus 2. Thus making it possible for three or four players to play at the same time, or two players to play in fullscreen mode. This feature does not exists in other versions, nor in the two other episodes.\n\nThe third game in the series combined the gameplay aspects of its predecessors, allowing players to choose between racing opponents of \"Lotus Turbo Challenge\" or the arcade-like time trials of \"Lotus 2\". The two-player option was retained and the music selection feature returns (Patrick Phelan's soundtrack to \"Lotus III\" spawned many modern remixes). \"Lotus III\" also added a third car - a concept Lotus M200 automobile - and allowed the player to choose which one to race with. The game recycled most of the graphics from \"Lotus 2\", but added a number of new sceneries.\n\nThe Genesis/Mega Drive version bears the name Lotus II: RECS (referring to the game's new course creation feature) or simply Lotus II depending on country of release, while the MS-DOS port released in 1993 was called Lotus: The Ultimate Challenge. The MS-DOS version features the Lotus Esprit S4 instead of the Esprit Turbo SE. Apart from the slightly different car's graphics, the difference in gameplay is minimal, if any. The MS-DOS version was released again in 1996, this time on a CD-ROM.\n\n\"Lotus III\" features a Racing Environment Construction Set (RECS) course creation system. The system allows users to create a race track by defining various basic parameters, such as number and difficulty of turns and hills, number of obstacles, type of scenery or difficulty of opponents. The created track can then be raced by one or both players. The course can also be written in form of a letter-and-digit code and later reused; these can be raced individually or in a series of up to nine user-created tracks.\n\nThe RECS system allows players to quickly create a unique track without having to use a course editor; however, it sacrificed the facility of precisely positioning turns or obstacles. The RECS system was later reused in another Magnetic Fields' game, \"International Rally Championship\".\n\nThe Amiga and Genesis versions of \"Lotus III\" again contain a hidden game, accessed by the password CU AMIGA in the Amiga version and POD PLEASE on the Genesis. The game is a graphically enhanced remake of Southern and Morris' Commodore 64 game POD.\n\n\"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" gave the Genesis version a 5.4 out of 10. They complimented the course creation system but said the game is otherwise \"more of the same of the first Lotus game.\" \"Computer Gaming World\" in August 1994 rated it 3.5 stars out of five and the best of four reviewed racing games. While recommending \"World Circuit\" for those wanting a racing simulation, the magazine approved of the \"surprisingly realistic \"and\" consistent\" car control, variety of courses, and the track designer.\n\nIn 1994, the three games were released for Amiga CD32 in one package, as \"The Classic Lotus Trilogy\". The Lotus Trilogy was also released for Atari 1040ST and Amiga that included all three games.\n\nItalian magazine \"Computer+Videogiochi\" scored the Amiga CD32 version 82.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1820723", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1820723", "title": "Skin Trade (song)", "text": "Skin Trade (song)\n\n\"Skin Trade\" is the second single from Duran Duran's \"Notorious\" album, and the band's 15th single in total. It was released in January 1987, reached #22 on the UK Singles Chart, and #39 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100.\n\nThe music for \"Skin Trade\" was written long before Simon LeBon finally finished the lyrics. The title for the song was derived from the Dylan Thomas book \"Adventures in the Skin Trade\" which John Taylor had on him during recording of the album. It was shortened to \"Skin Trade\" and LeBon eventually wrote the melody and lyrics for the track while spending an evening in Taylor's Upper West Side Manhattan apartment. The lyrics reflect on how everyone is selling themselves, and \"there's a little hooker in each of us\".\n\nThe single was quite a departure for the band. Simon LeBon sang in falsetto, Le Bon admits he was channeling The Rolling Stones lead singer Mick Jagger on their song Emotional Rescue. A horn section played a prominent role in the track, as played by The Borneo Horns. The band persevered with the single and many aspects of their future business took inspiration from \"Skin Trade\". They called their publishing company Skin Trade Music Ltd. and the \"Notorious\" tour was called the \"Strange Behaviour Tour\" (a reference to that line of the song). Likewise, a 1987 remix EP and a 1999 double CD collection of remixes were also called \"Strange Behaviour\".\n\nAndy Taylor was no longer an official member of Duran Duran by that time, but he was credited as a session guitarist on this song, although apparently he did not participate in the recordings. Meanwhile the new guest musicians, Steve Ferrone and Warren Cuccurullo, played the drums and lead guitars respectively. Nile Rodgers played some lines of the rhythm guitar.\nIn a retrospective review of the single, AllMusic journalist Donald A. Guarisco praised the song. He wrote: \"The music lends contrast to the angry tone of the lyrics by creating a sultry, mellow melody that juxtaposes verses with a soft, hypnotic ebb and flow with an ever-ascending chorus that revs up the song's inherent drama.\"\n\nThe \"Skin Trade\" video was the second filmed for the band by directors Peter Kagan and Paula Greif, after \"Notorious\". Film of band members performing was treated with a rotoscope-like effect, adding vivid colors to details like a person's eyes or jewelry. Like so many other Duran Duran videos, \"Skin Trade\" included a beautiful woman - in this case German supermodel Tatjana Patitz. Her image was rotoscoped for some scenes as well, and her dancing figure was superimposed on several different vividly colored abstract backgrounds.\n\nSession drummer Steve Ferrone and guitarist Warren Cuccurullo, who would later become a full member of the band, appeared in the video, although their faces are not often seen. Cuccurullo also contributed the power chords and harmony parts on the bridges of the album track, with session guitarist Nile Rodgers playing the others.\n\n\"Skin Trade\" was nominated for Best Special Effects in a Video and Best Cinematography in a Video at the 1987 MTV Video Music Awards, but lost to Peter Gabriel's \"Sledgehammer\" and Robbie Nevil's \"C'est La Vie\", respectively.\n\nThe b-side to \"Skin Trade\" was the only original b-side released during the \"Notorious\" era. Entitled \"We Need You\", it was written and recorded in 1986 while the band awaited the return of Andy Taylor for a recording session. It was the first recording to feature just the three remaining members of Duran Duran - Nick Rhodes, John Taylor and Simon Le Bon.\n\nTwo further mixes of \"Skin Trade\" (S.O.S. Dub & Parisian Mix) were completed, but not released commercially during the \"Skin Trade\" release cycle. They appeared on a US 12\" promo and on a UK 12\" promo, backed with remixes of the next single \"Meet El Presidente\". The \"\"Parisian Mix\"\" was also released on the promo-only \"Master Mixes\" EP.\n\nThe \"\"Parisian Mix\"\" was finally released commercially in the UK and in the U.S. on the \"All She Wants Is\" (1988) 3\" CD single.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Skin Trade\" was the first chart disappointment in the band's career. Not only did it fail to repeat the huge success of \"Notorious\" but it failed to get the top 20 on either side of the Atlantic, and that was a first for the band since their very earliest releases. \"Skin Trade\" later grew to become a fan favourite, but the change of style and direction were shocking at the time.\n\n\nApart from the single, \"Skin Trade\" has also appeared on:\n\nAlbums:\n\nSingles:\n\nDuran Duran are:\n\nWith:\n\nProduction:\n\n"}

It was later released on DVD with eleven extra songs not televised, and as a CD of the same name.\n\nAll of these forms document Springsteen and the E Street Band's highly successful 1999-2000 Reunion Tour, their first concert tour together in eleven years.\n\nRunning 90 minutes, the film was recorded at concerts on June 29 and July 1, 2000. These were the final two shows in the Band's ten-show tour-ending run at Madison Square Garden in New York City. HBO received six Emmy Award nominations (including \"Outstanding Variety, Music or Comedy Special\") and won two Awards for the film.\n\n\n\"Born to Run\" was a late addition to the special. As a result of this, there is a crossfade into and out of the song on the film and DVD and there is a complete fade-out before it on the CD. Also, its placement on the CD (at the end of the first disc, before \"Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out\") was a result of this late decision.

{"id": "1820735", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1820735", "title": "George Whyte-Melville", "text": "George Whyte-Melville\n\nGeorge John Whyte-Melville (19 June 1821 – 5 December 1878) was a Scottish novelist much concerned with field sports, and also a poet.\n\nMajor George John Whyte-Melville was born in 1821, at Mount Melville near St Andrews, Scotland, as a son of Major John Whyte-Melville and Lady Catherine Anne Sarah Osborne and a grandson on his mother's side of the 5th Duke of Leeds. His father was a well-known sportsman and Captain of The Royal and Ancient Golf Club. The son was Grand Master of the Freemasons of Scotland from 1834 to 1866.\n\nGeorge was tutored privately at home by the young Robert Lee, then educated at Eton. He entered the army in 1839, became a captain in the Coldstream Guards in 1846 and retired in 1849. He married the Hon. Charlotte Hanbury-Bateman in 1847, and they had one daughter, Florence Elizabeth, who went on to marry Clotworthy John Skeffington, 11th Viscount Massereene and 4th Viscount Ferrard.\n\nIn 1849 Whyte-Melville was the subject of a summons for maintenance by Elizabeth Gibbs, described as \"a smartly-dressed and interesting looking young woman\", who alleged that he was the father of her child. She stated that she had known Whyte-Melville since December 1846 and that she had given birth to his child in September 1847. The Judge found for the defendant as the written evidence could not be proved to be in Whyte-Melville's hand, but allowed the complainant to apply for a further summons in order to obtain proof.\n\nAfter translating some Horace in 1850, Whyte-Melville published his first novel, \"Digby Grand\", in 1852, which was a success. He went on to publish 21 other novels and became a popular writer about hunting. Most of his heroes and heroines – Digby Grand, Tilbury Nogo, the Honourable Crasher, Mr Sawyer, Kate Coventry, Mrs Lascelles – ride to hounds, or are would-be members of the hunt. Some characters reappear in different novels, such as the supercilious stud groom, the dark and wary steeple-chaser, or the fascinating sporting widow.\n\n\"Bones and I, or The Skeleton at Home\", is an anomaly in his work, as it is far from the realms of the hunting field or historical romance. It centres on an urban recluse living in a small, modern villa in a London cul de sac, looking out on \"the dead wall at the back of an hospital\". His most famous lyric is also unusual in its unexpected melancholy – the words to Paolo Tosti's song \"Good-bye!\" Several of his novels are historical, \"The Gladiators\" being the best known. Whyte-Melville also wrote \"Sarchedon\", a historical novel set in Ancient Babylon. He also published volumes of poetry, including \"Songs and Verses\" (1869) and \"Legend of the True Cross\" (1873). However, it is for his portrayal of contemporary sporting society that he is most regarded. Henry Hawley Smart is said to have taken Whyte-Melville as one of his models when he too set out to be a sporting novelist.\n\nThe catch phrase for which he is best remembered comes from a song about hunting: \"Drink, Puppy, Drink\". This recurs also in \"The Flashman Papers\" by George MacDonald Fraser, as a frequently mentioned favourite song of the anti-hero. In 1876, Whyte-Melville penned the rarely attributed, but widely recognized opening line to the short poem \"The Object of a Life\": \"To eat, drink, and be merry, because to-morrow we die.\"\n\nWhen the Crimean War broke out, Whyte-Melville went out as a volunteer major into the Turkish irregular cavalry, but this was the only break in his literary career.\n\nWhyte-Melville lost his life in 1878 whilst hunting, falling as he galloped over a ploughed field in the Vale of White Horse. He had moved to Tetbury, Gloucestershire, in about 1875, the better to follow the Beaufort and Vale of White Horse hunts.\n\nGeorge Whyte-Melville was buried in the churchyard of St Mary's, Tetbury, within a few feet of his property, Barton Abbotts.\n\nIt has been claimed that Whyte-Melville's death inspired the well-known hunting song \"John Peel\" – although John Peel was a real-life huntsman in the Lake District, the author of the lyrics, John Woodcock Graves, was a close friend of Whyte-Melville. After imbibing a quantity of alcohol at Whyte-Melville's funeral, Graves penned some verses in tribute to Whyte-Melville, set to the melody of a traditional folk song entitled, \"Bonnie Annie\".\n\nThe Scottish Border poet and Australian bush balladeer Will H. Ogilvie (1869–1963) was strongly influenced by Whyte-Melville, so much so that he addressed two poems to him. These lines are from the \"Scattered Scarlet\" anthology of 1923: \n\nAt the instigation of his mother, Lady Catherine Melville, a memorial fountain to him was erected by public subscription in Market Street, St Andrews, Fife, in 1880. The three-tier cascading fountain is about 14 foot (427 cm) high, composed of sandstone and Dalbeattie granite. It features four marble plaques dedicated to Whyte-Melville, which show his bust, the family coat of arms, the arms of the Coldstream Guards, and a memorial inscription. Due to corrosion of its internal pipes, it fell into disuse – possibly in the 1930s – and was treated as a flower bed for many decades. A local councillor and the St Andrews Merchants' Association led a campaign that ended in its resuming function as a fountain on Wednesday 8 July 2015.\n\n"}

{"id": "1820751", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1820751", "title": "Location model", "text": "Location model\n\nA location (spatial) model refers to any monopolistic competition model in economics that demonstrates consumer preference for particular brands of goods and their locations. Examples of location models include Hotelling’s Location Model, Salop’s Circle Model, and hybrid variations.\n\nIn traditional economic models, consumers display preference given the constraints of a product characteristic space. Consumers perceive certain brands with common characteristics to be close substitutes, and differentiate these products from their unique characteristics. For example, there are many brands of chocolate with nuts and others without them. Hence, the chocolate with nuts is a constraint of its product characteristic space.\n\nOn the other hand, consumers in location models display preference for both the utility gained from a particular brand’s characteristics as well as its geographic location; these two factors form an enhanced “product characteristic space”. Consumers are now willing to sacrifice pleasure from products for a closer geographic location, and vice versa. For example, consumers realize high costs for products that are located far from their spatial point (e.g. transportation costs, time, etc.) and also for products that deviate from their ideal features. Firms have greater market power when they satisfy the consumer’s demand for products at closer distance or preferred products.\n\nIn 1929, Hotelling developed a location model that demonstrates the relationship between location and pricing behavior of firms. He represented this notion through a line of fixed length. Assuming all consumers are identical (except for location) and consumers are evenly dispersed along the line, both the firms and consumer respond to changes in demand and the economic environment.\n\nIn Hotelling’s Location Model, firms do not exercise variations in product characteristics; firms compete and price their products in only one dimension, geographic location. Therefore, traditional usage of this model should be used for consumers who perceive products to be perfect substitutes or as a foundation for modern location models.\n\nAssume that the line in Hotelling’s location model is actually a street with fixed length.\n\nAll consumers are identical, except they are uniformly located at two equal quadrants formula_1 and formula_2, which is divided in the center by point formula_3. Consumers face a transportation/time cost for reaching a firm, denoted by formula_4; they have no preferences for the firms.\n\nThere are two firms in this scenario, Firm x and Firm y; each one is located at a different end of the street, is fixed in location and sells an identical product.\n\nGiven the assumptions of the Hotelling model, consumers will choose either firm as long as the combined price formula_5 and transportation cost formula_4 of the product is less than the competitive firm.\n\nFor example, if both firms sell the product at the same price formula_5, consumers in quadrants formula_1 and formula_2 will pick the firm closest to them. The price realized by the consumer is\n\nformula_10, where formula_11 is the price of the product including the cost of transportation.\n\nAs long as formula_4 for Firm x is greater than Firm y, consumers will travel to Firm y to purchase their product; this minimizes formula_11. Only the consumers who live at point formula_3, the halfway point between the two firms, will be indifferent between the two product locations.\n\nAssume that the line in Hotelling’s location model is actually a street with fixed length.\n\nAll consumers are identical, except they are uniformly located in four quadrants formula_1, formula_2, formula_4, and formula_18; the halfway point between the endpoints is point formula_3. Consumers face an equal transportation/time cost for reaching a firm, denoted by formula_4; they have no preferences for the firms.\n\nThere are two firms in this scenario, Firm x and Firm y; each one is located at a different end of the street, is able to relocate at no cost, and sells an identical product.\n\nIn this example, Firm x and Firm y will maximize their profit by increasing their consumer pool. Firm x will move slightly toward Firm y, in order to gain Firm y’s customers. In response, Firm y will move slightly toward Firm x to re-establish its loss, and increase the pool from its competitor. The cycle repeats until both firms are at point formula_3, the halfway point of the street where each firm has the same number of customers. This result is known as Hotelling's law.\n\nIf only Firm x can relocate without costs and Firm y is fixed, Firm x will move to the side of Firm y where the consumer pool is maximized. Consequently, the profits gained from Firm X significantly increase, while Firm Y incurs a significant loss.\n\nOne of the most famous variations of Hotelling’s location model is Salop’s circle model. Similar to the previous spatial representations, the circle model examines consumer preference with regards to geographic location. However, Salop introduces two significant factors: 1) firms are located around a circle with no end-points, and 2) it allows the consumer to choose a second, heterogeneous good.\n\nAssume that the consumers are equidistant from one another around the circle. The model will occur for one time period, in which only one product is purchased. The consumer will have a choice of purchasing variations of Product A (a differentiated product) or Product B (an outside good; undifferentiated product).\n\nThere are two firms also located equidistant around the circle. Each firm offers a variation of Product A, and an outside firm offers a good, Product B.\n\nIn this example, the consumer wants to purchase their ideal variation of Product A. They are willing to purchase the product, given that it is within the constraint of their utility, transportation/distance costs, and price.\n\nThe utility formula_22 for a particular product at distance formula_18 is represented in the following equation:\n\nformula_24\n\nWhere formula_22 is the utility from a superior brand, formula_26 denotes the rate at which an inferior brand lowers the utility from the superior brand, formula_18 is the location of the superior brand, and formula_28 is the location of the consumer. The distance between the brand and the consumer is thereby given in formula_29.\n\nThe consumer’s primary goal is to maximize consumer surplus, i.e. purchase the product that best satisfies any combination of price and quality. Although the consumer may receive more pleasure from their superior brand, the inferior brand may maximize the surplus formula_30 which is given by:\n\nformula_31, where the difference is between the utility of a product at location formula_18 and the price formula_5.\n\nNow suppose the consumer also has the option to purchase an outside, undifferentiated Product B. The consumer surplus gained from Product B is denoted by formula_34.\n\nTherefore, for a given amount of money, the consumer will purchase the superior variation of Product A over Product B as long as\n\nformula_35, where the consumer surplus from the superior variation of Product A is greater than the consumer surplus gained from Product B.\n\nAlternatively, the consumer only purchases the superior variation of product A as long as\n\nformula_36, where the difference between the surplus of the superior variation of Product A and the surplus gained from Product B is positive.\n\n\n"}

The structure of the TAM was suggested by Alexander Zaitsev, Chief Scientist at Russia's Institute of Radio-engineering and Electronics. The message's content and target stars were selected by a group of teens from four Russian cities, who collaborated in person and via the Internet. Each transmission comprised three sections: a sounding, a live theremin concert, and digital data including images and text. TAM was humanity's fourth Active SETI broadcast and the first musical interstellar radio message.\n\nZaitsev's proposal for a musical message – the \"First Theremin Concert for Extraterrestrials\" – was submitted to the Arecibo Observatory in July 2000. It was rejected amid concerns over the dangers posed by advertising the presence of humanity to unknown and possibly highly advanced civilizations. After another unsuccessful attempt to garner support, the project was backed by the Yevpatoria RT-70 radio telescope with funding from the Education Department of Moscow. Unlike the previous digital-only messages Arecibo-1974 and Cosmic Call 1, TAM had a three-part structure, each containing different forms of information. Such structure was suggested by Alexander Zaitsev, and was intended to make the message easier to detect and interpret. The three elements of each transmission were:\n\n\nAccording to Zaitsev, art must be central to any interstellar message. Physical laws and mathematics are almost certainly already known to extraterrestrial intelligences, but our artwork is unique to us. With this in mind, and in contrast to previous binary digital broadcasts, Zatsev proposed \"not a discrete two-tone radiosignal but a more native continuous one, in which smooth frequency variations directly transfer one-dimensional emotional information. I am talking about music, which is more universally comprehensible than language, and about theremin, which is an electronic noncontact musical instrument.\"\n\nThree theremin performers from the Moscow Theremin Center – Lydia Kavina, Yana Aksenova, and Anton Kerchenko – were invited to perform seven songs selected by students. The program included two Russian folk songs and works by Beethoven, Vivaldi, Saint-Saëns, Rakhmaninov, and Gershwin. Kavina submitted recordings of her performance, but Aksenova and Kerchenko performed live – the radar dish had been specially modified to accept input from theremins. Each performance lasted about fifteen minutes. The First Theremin Concert for Extraterrestrials was the world's first musical Active SETI broadcast, and was sent seven years before NASA's Across the Universe message.\n\nListen to six Theremin melodies as recorded for the Theremin concert\n\n\"Sonograms (frequency variations) of 40-second pieces of three musical compositions from The First Theremin Concert: (from left to right) the last movement of the 9th Symphony by Beethoven, “The Swan” by Saint-Saens, and “Summertime” by Gershwin.\"\n\nSingle-side band (SSB) modulation was used for up-conversion of the Theremin's analog audio signals to carrier frequency 5010 MHz (6 cm wavelength) for sending toward the target stars.\n\nThe target stars were:\n\nPhotoalbum dedicated to sending interstellar Teen Age Message in August and September 2001.\n\n\n\n"}

According to Agoston and Masters Germiyanoğulları were Turkomans who had immigrated to the west because of Mongol pressure in the second half of the 13th century. According to Mehmet Fuat Köprülü, the ruling clan belonged to Afshar branch of Oghuz Turks. Germiyanids likely came from Kerman or Fars Province, perhaps headed west with Khwarazmshahs. After the death of Jalal ad-Din Mingburnu, they remailed in Malatya area for a while, then moved to Kütahya, where they established the beylik.\n\nFor a brief period in the second half of the 14th century, Germiyan Dynasty was second only to Karamanid Dynasty in its rising power. But they were later taken over by the neighboring Osmanoğlu dynasty, who were to found the Ottoman Empire later.\n\nGermiyans played a crucial role in settling Turkish populations along the coastal regions of the Aegean Sea, the founders of the Beyliks of Aydin, Sarukhan, İnançoğlu and Menteşe having started out as Germiyan commanders.\n\nThey rebelled against the central power in 1283, upon the execution of the sultan Kaykhusraw III by the Mongols, and placing of Mesud II on the Seljuq throne. The struggle between combined Mongol-Seljuq forces based in Konya and the rebel forces of Germiyan continued until 1290. An agreement could only be reached in 1299, upon which the Germiyan Dynasty also entered into possession of Ankara. When the Ilkhanid governor Emir Çoban took over Anatolia in 1314, they declared allegiance and concentrated on raids towards the regions to their west.\n\nTheir western offshoots that were the Beyliks of Menteşe, Aydin, Ladik, Sarukhan and Karasi were all subject to the Germiyan in the early periods of their foundation, while the Beyliks of Sâhib Ata and Hamidids to the south had to rely on them for protection against attacks from the Karamanids. As for the northern regions of Anatolia, Byzantine sources record Umur Bey, a commander and son-in-law to the Germiyan family, to be the possessor of Paphlagonia, where Jandarid dynasty was to rule only after Germiyan power weakened.\n\nTheir strong political entity was eventually surrounded by newer states established by their own former commanders, leaving the Germiyan no outlet to the coastline or to Byzantine territory. Their powerful Karamanid neighbors exerting constant pressure from the east, Germiyan gradually fell under the rising influence of the Ottomans.\n\nThe actual Turkish province of Kütahya was called the sub-province (\"sanjak\") and later province (\"vilayet\") of Germiyan until the early years of the Republic of Turkey, when it was renamed after its central town.\n\nThe founding dynasty of the beylik produced illustrious descendants either under the Ottoman Empire or in present-day Turkey, a notable one among these being the 19th century grand vizier Abdurrahman Nureddin Pasha.\n\n\n"}

This church was known as First Presbyterian Congregation of York, Upper Canada, and James Harris (later to be Ketchum's son in law) became minister.\n\nIn 1830, the larger St. Andrew's Church was founded, and it quickly became the city's primary Presbyterian Church. St. Andrew's was aligned with the Church of Scotland; the Canadian Synod was formed in 1831.\n\nThis Richmond Street church was more evangelical, and had become independent of the \"United Synod of the Canadas\" in 1834, and remained apart from any other group (including the United Presbyterian Church of Scotland who started their Toronto congregation in 1838) until 1844.\n\nIn 1843, the Church of Scotland split, when many of the evangelicals led by Thomas Chalmers, withdrew to form the Free Church of Scotland, in a dispute called the Disruption of 1843. This dispute hit the Canadas the following year at the respective Synod Meetings in Kingston and Nova Scotia; a faction broke off from St. Andrew's, who remained in the \"Auld\" Kirk.\n\nThis group was approached by the York congregation, and the two groups decided to join and become a stronger and united Free Church congregation presence in Toronto that they named \"Knox's\" Church, after the Scottish Church reformer John Knox; they called an experienced minister from Paisley, Scotland, Rev. Dr. Robert Burns, to become their first minister. Burns was the former Secretary of the \"Glasgow Missionary Society\", a friend of Chalmers, and uncle of another well-known minister and missionary, William Chalmers Burns. Burns was initially a lecturer, then later full-time professor, in the nearby Knox Free Church Theological College. Mr. Harris retired from the York congregation, and remained connected with the congregation until his death in 1874.\n\nIn 1847, the old York Church was destroyed by a fire. The congregation built a new larger church on the same lot, this time facing Queen Street West between Yonge and Bay. Knox quickly became the leading Free Church congregation in Canada, helping to spread the movement throughout the colony. One of the most prominent members of this church was George Brown founder of the \"Toronto Globe\" and also the \"Banner\", and an eventual member of the Fathers of Confederation, upon formation of the Dominion of Canada in 1867. \n\nFrom the split (\"the disruption\") in the Church of Scotland and in the Canadas, Knox took an active role in the reunion of all the Presbyterian groups in Canada. In 1861, the Free Church of which Knox belonged to, and the Canada Synod of the United Presbyterian Church of Scotland joined; and in 1875, the Presbyterian Church in Canada, uniting the \"Auld Kirk\" and \"Free Kirk\".\n\nOver time, Knox's location had become more commercial with fewer residents in the area. At the time Toronto had strict Lord's Day laws that prevented public transit from running on Sundays, making it imperative that churches be located near to the population.\n\nIn 1895, the church was severely damaged by a fire that began at the Robert Simpson Building next door. This fire destroyed the steeple, which was never fully rebuilt. It was eventually decided to move the church in 1906, and in January 1909, the church officially moved into its present home at 630 Spadina Avenue just west of the University of Toronto, at Harbord Street; the memorial stones cited in the enclosed article (1886 Profile), were also moved into the new building.\n\nThe mixed Romanesque Revival and Gothic Revival building was designed by congregation member James Wilson Gray.\n\nIn June 1925, Knox was instrumental in maintaining the continuity of the Presbyterian Church in Canada, as it was from this building, that the midnight vigil was held, led by the 79 Ministers and Elders who voted against the consummation of the union (in nearby College Street Church) that formed the United Church of Canada, as they maintained continuity with their General Assembly. As a congregation, Knox had voted against Union earlier that year, by a vote of 20-788. There were gains to the congregation from some of those in the surrounding congregations that went into the Union.\n\nIn the 1950s, the congregation was challenged to leave the community, as post World War II suburban expansion greatly affected Toronto, and the Spadina Expressway (later abandoned) was proposed to run along Spadina Avenue. Under the leadership of Rev. Dr. William Fitch, who arrived in early 1955 from the Springburn area of Glasgow, Scotland, the congregation built an adjoining hall (Knox Fellowship Centre) in 1961, and expanded its ministries into the inner city (Evangel Hall at 573 Queen Street West had been run by Knox since 1913), the Universities (including Ryerson and York, and community colleges such as nearby George Brown College), and during the summer months, began the weekly Knox Summer Fellowship, Wednesday Evening Services that brought (or introduced) renowned speakers from around the world.\n\nThe congregation is reflective of a changing demographic in a multicultural community; ESL classes are offered, and has also developed a broad support group with many Christian missionaries under their support and care. There is a Knox Youth Dinner & Food Bank programme for street youth in the winter, and continues to be blessed with well-attended Sunday Morning and Evening worship services.\n\nThere is also a great support and tradition for missionaries, both on the home and International scenes. There is a current roster of 46 (19 couples), as well as 17 \"Phase 2\" Missionaries (4 couples) who are supported in their retirement years; along with others who have been linked through liaisons with other recognized organizations including the Presbyterian Church.\n\n\n+died in pastorate\n\nand other numerous students from neighbouring Knox College and elsewhere.\n\n"}

The company's history dates to foundation of an engineering workshop in 1840 in Kilmarnock, Scotland.\n\nAfter a long period of operation the company was acquired by the Hunslet group in 1972 and renamed Hunslet-Barclay; in 2007 the company changed hands after bankruptcy becoming Brush-Barclay as part of the FKI Group. In 2011 Brush Traction and Brush-Barclay were acquired from FKI by Wabtec - as of 2012 the company still operates in Kilmarnock providing rail engineering services as Wabtec Rail Scotland.\n\nBorn in 1814, Andrew Barclay was only 25 years of age when he set up a partnership with Thomas McCulloch to manufacture mill shafts in Kilmarnock, East Ayrshire, Scotland. It was only a couple of years later that he branched out on his own to manufacture his patented gas lamps. In 1847 he set up workshops specializing in the manufacture of winding engines for the local coal mining industry. However, the money from the gas lamp patent sale was never paid and sequestration of the company came the following year.\n\nBy 1859 Barclay had recovered from this setback and his newly formed company produced its first locomotive. Sometime around 1871 Andrew Barclay set up a second locomotive building business known as Barclays & Co. He had set up this company for his younger brother, John, and his four sons. This business remaining closely associated with Andrew Barclay. Again not all went well and the companies were declared bankrupt in 1874 and 1882 respectively. Four years after this latest collapse, Andrew Barclay’s business was relaunched as Andrew Barclay Sons & Co. Later Barclays & Co was also revived. Further difficulties arose. In 1892 the firm became a limited liability company as Andrew Barclay Sons & Co., Ltd. Just two years later Andrew was removed from control of the company which bore his name by its shareholders. Barclay sued the company for unpaid wages, a matter which was settled out of court 5 years later.\n\nIn 1930 the company bought the business of John Cochrane (Barrhead) Ltd, engine makers and in 1963 it acquired the goodwill of the North British Locomotive Company, Glasgow.\n\nIn 1972 the company was acquired by the Leeds-based Hunslet Group of companies and its name was changed in 1989 to Hunslet-Barclay Ltd. As such, it operated six ex-British Rail Class 20 diesels to provide motive power for weed-killing trains used on the national rail network. The locomotive interests of Hunslet-Barclay were bought by LH Group, Staffordshire on 31 December 2003, with Hunslet-Barclay at Kilmarnock continuing in the business of design, manufacture and refurbishment of multiple units, rolling stock, bogies and wheel-sets.\n\nSome Barclay locomotives were supplied through Lennox Lange, who acted as an agent for Barclay.\n\nAfter going into financial administration in 2007 the company was acquired by the locomotive builder Brush Traction of Loughborough through its parent, the FKI Group. It was renamed Brush-Barclay.\n\nOn 28 February 2011, Wabtec announced that it had acquired Brush Traction for US$31 million. The Kilmarnock works became Wabtec Rail Scotland.\n\nThe company was noted for constructing simple robust locomotives, chiefly for industrial use, and many of its products survive in use on heritage railways, over 100 in Britain. A typical product would be an 0-4-0 with squared-off saddle tank.\n\nBarclay was the largest builder of fireless locomotives in Britain, building 114 of them between 1913 and 1961. Few fireless locomotives are seen in action today. This is due to the low power of the locomotives, the long time needed to charge a locomotive from cold and the low steam pressures available for charging. Perhaps the only exception was \"Lord Ashfield\" (Andrew Barclay works no. 1989 of 1930) at the Museum of Science and Industry in Manchester that ran for a while in the 1990s sharing a steam supply with the stationary exhibits in their exhibition hall.\n\nThe company built diesel shunting locomotives for industry and for British Rail. Classes included British Rail Class D2/5, British Rail Class 01 and British Rail Class 06.\n\nOver 80 Andrew Barclay locomotives were supplied to railways in Ireland (Irish Turf Board/Bord na Móna), Australia, New Zealand, Fiji and Sri Lanka (Sri Lanka Port Authority).\n\nA large number of various ABS&Co locomotives have been preserved, proving popular on many Heritage Railways and Railway Centres, as listed below.\n\n\n\n'Steam Locomotives'\n\n'Narrow Gauge Diesel Locomotives'\n\n\n\n"}

The album's name refers to a neighborhood in Shepherd's hometown of Shreveport, Louisiana. It also featured lead singer Corey Sterling on vocals.\n\n\"Ledbetter Heights\" was an immediate hit, selling over 500,000 copies by early 1996. It was certified Gold by the RIAA in 1996 and certified Platinum by 2004, and achieved an unusual level of commercial success for a blues album, especially considering Shepherd's young age at release. \"Ledbetter Heights\" also spent 20 weeks topping \"Billboard\"'s blues chart. In their list of blues artists, \"Guitar World\" voted Shepherd #3 after B.B.King and Eric Clapton.\n\nThe Ledbetter Heights neighborhood, formerly known as \"St. Paul's Bottoms\" and traditionally referred to as \"The Bottoms\", is one of the earliest parts of Shreveport to be settled outside the original downtown district, dating back to the 19th century. For almost all of its history, it has been predominantly African-American. In the early 20th century, there was a red-light district with legal prostitution within this neighborhood, and musician Huddie \"Lead Belly\" Ledbetter, after whom the neighborhood is now named, lived and performed there. The renaming of the neighborhood to Ledbetter Heights in the 1990s was part of an effort to rehabilitate the area's image, as it had become known as an economically depressed and crime-ridden area.\n\nShepherd named his debut album after this neighborhood as an homage to the blues tradition of his hometown.\n\nKenny Wayne Shepherd wrote/co-wrote all but four songs found on the album. See below where noted.\n\nThe album track \"I'm Leaving You (Commit a Crime)\" is incorrectly credited on the album to Howlin' Wolf. Although Howlin' Wolf was the first to record the song on his album \"The London Howlin' Wolf Sessions\", it was written by James Oden, although writer Bill Janovitz says otherwise on AllMusic.com (https://www.allmusic.com/song/commit-a-crime-mt0001193848). The title is also incorrect, because \"I'm Leaving You\" is a completely different song by Howlin' Wolf. This song was originally titled \"What a Woman!\", but was released after Wolf's death as \"Commit a Crime\" on his 1984 album \"All Night Boogie\". Five years later, in 1986, musician Stevie Ray Vaughan included a version of the song on his own album, \"Live Alive\". It is likely the title used was an honest mistake, since the song begins with the lyrics, \"I'm leaving you, woman, before I commit a crime.\" When Shepherd recorded the song for his own 1995 album \"Ledbetter Heights\", he carried on the mistake and used Stevie Ray Vaughan's title for the song, also incorrectly crediting Wolf as the writer.\n\n\nAlbum - Billboard (North America)\nSingles - Billboard (North America)\n"}

He is personally responsible for several attacks against Corporation's infrastructure, which first attracted the Freedom movement to put the hacker to good use.\n\nEdward Raymonds (AKA \"The Bull\") - The Bull graduated from Mesa High and joined the armed forces before the Corporation takeover. He was discovered by a sports agent while playing for the army's football team, and was recruited to play professionally. The Bull enjoyed a legendary career until the Corporation bought the professional football league. When he refused to participate in Corporation-sponsored match fixing, he was framed for illegal drug-use, and served five years in prison. With his future bleak and reputation destroyed, The Bull was ready to go take out as many of the men responsible as he could. The Bull now uses his experience to train new recruits to Freedom and lead organized attacks against the Corporation.\n\nBy July 2006, the PlayStation 2 version of \"State of Emergency\" had sold 700,000 copies and earned $28 million in the United States. \"Next Generation\" ranked it as the 90th highest-selling game launched for the PlayStation 2, Xbox or GameCube between January 2000 and July 2006 in that country. Combined sales of the \"State of Emergency\" line reached 900,000 units in the United States by July 2006.\n\n\"State of Emergency\" received \"mixed or average\" reviews on all platforms according to video game review aggregator Metacritic. The game's strengths were considered to be the value for money as a budget title, the simplistic fun offered, the technical achievement of having hundreds of people running around on a modest system, and the satirical sense of humor. Weaknesses cited include gameplay that might be considered too simple, and a poor multiplayer mode on the PC.\n\n\"FHM\" gave the PS2 version a score of four stars out of five and called it \"Manic, frenzied and violent gaming at its gripping best.\" \"The Cincinnati Enquirer\" also gave the same version four stars out of five and stated that \"This new 'bad boy' of the video game industry is extremely fun to play — for those old enough and mature enough to purchase it — as a campy stress releaser at the end of a bad day.\" However, \"Maxim\" gave the same version a score of six out of ten and said, \"Such virtual destruction may once have seemed innocent, but these days the whole thing hits a little close to home.\" \"Entertainment Weekly\" gave said version a C, saying, \"Four levels are too few to stay interesting for all 175-plus missions, which are too bloody repetitive.\" \"The Village Voice\" gave the Xbox version a similar score of five out of ten and said, \"In 'Revolution' mode—a series of nearly identical, frustrating mini-missions—the jackbooted thugs, now armed with pistols, make life much tougher. (Deeply flawed camera views don't help.) What's the point if you can't steal your family some diapers?\"\n\nBefore its release, the game was denounced by Washington state politicians for its similarity to the real-life 1999 World Trade Organization riots and protests in Seattle which caused $3 million in damages. The game features the fictional \"American Trade Organization\" as the antagonistic establishment.\n\nA sequel, \"State of Emergency 2\", was released in 2006. This game was again developed by VIS Entertainment ltd although after they became insolvent and went into administration the game was completed by DC Studios and was released by SouthPeak Games.\n\n"}
{"id": "1820844", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1820844", "title": "RS-449", "text": "RS-449\n\nThe RS-449 specification, also known as EIA-449 or TIA-449, defines the functional and mechanical characteristics of the interface between data terminal equipment, typically a computer, and data communications equipment, typically a modem or terminal server. The full title of the standard is \"EIA-449 General Purpose 37-Position and 9-Position Interface for Data Terminal Equipment and Data Circuit-Terminating Equipment Employing Serial Binary Data Interchange\".\n\n449 was part of an effort to replace RS-232C, offering much higher performance and longer cable lengths while using the same DB-25 connectors. This was initially split into two closely related efforts, RS-422 and RS-423. As feature creep set in, the number of required pins began to grow beyond what a DB-25 could handle, and the RS-449 effort started to define a new connector.\n\n449 emerged as an unwieldy system using a large DC-37 connector along with a separate DE-9 connector if the 422 protocol was used. The resulting cable mess was already dismissed as hopeless before the standard was even finalized. The effort was eventually abandoned in favor of RS-530, which used a single DB-25 connector.\n\nDuring the late 1970s, the EIA began developing two new serial data standards to replace RS-232. RS-232 had a number of issues that limited its performance and practicality. Among these was the relatively large voltages used for signalling, +5 and -5V for mark and space. To supply these, a +12V power supply was typically required, which made it somewhat difficult to implement in a market that was rapidly being dominated by +5/0V transistor-transistor logic (TTL) circuitry and even lower-voltage CMOS implementations. These high voltages and unbalanced communications also resulted in relatively short cable lengths, nominally set to a maximum of , although in practice they could be somewhat longer if running at slower speeds.\n\nThe reason for the large voltages was due to ground voltages. RS-232 included both a protective ground and a signal ground in the standard, but did not define how these were to be implemented. It was often the case that the protective ground was left unconnected, and the signal ground was connected to ground at both ends. As a result, if there was a slight difference in ground potential at the two ends of the cable, the voltage in the signal ground pin might not be zero, and large signal voltages were needed to provide a positive signal in this case.\n\nTo address this problem, the new RS-422 and RS-423 standards used well-defined grounding that was always based on the sender's reference, and made the signal only 400 mV above or below this reference. In the case of RS-422, for instance, every signal had a second pin operating at the opposite voltage, thereby balancing the voltages and always providing a positive signal. When this process was starting, the decision was made to unbundle the mechanical aspects of the standard from the electrical, with the former becoming the RS-449 standards track.\n\nThe primary difference between RS-422 and RS-423 was that the former had a return line for every signal, while the later had a single shared signal ground. This meant that RS-422 had double the number of signal wires. Along with other changes, the number of connections began to grow, to the point where even RS-423, which was functionally similar to RS-232, no longer fit in a DB25 connector. This led to the use of the larger DC-37, but even that did not have enough pins to support RS-422, so this was \"solved\" by adding the additional ground wires to a separate DE-9 connector. This resulted in a \"horrendous number of wires\" and the conclusion in 1983 that its \"success... remains to be seen.\"\n\nThe standard was rarely used, although it could be found on some network communication equipment. EIA-449-1 was rescinded in January 1986 and superseded by EIA/TIA-530-A, the final version EIA-449-1 was withdrawn in September 2002. The most widespread use of RS-422/423, the early Apple Macintosh computers, used a simple 9-pin DIN connector and for inter-machine links used only three-wire connectors.\n\n\n"}

The term is often used interchangeably for the extended capital region of Sweden as Stockholm is located at the lake's eastern end, at its outlet in the Baltic Sea.\n\nThe Mälaren Valley, which never has been defined as an official region, has throughout Swedish history instead been shared by several provinces — Uppland, Södermanland, Västmanland, and Närke — and, in modern times, by several counties — Stockholm, Uppsala, Södermanland, Örebro, and Västmanland. In most cases, the Lake Hjälmaren region is included into the Mälaren Valley Region, if nothing else, for historical and cultural reasons.\n\nNotwithstanding this, most people in Sweden will have a clear notion of what characterises the Mälaren Valley, while few of them will be able to define what those characteristics are more precisely. Arguably, this is because the region is not only homogeneous and has been so for many centuries, but also have had a tremendous influence on shared Swedish history and therefore never had to define its symbols or accentuate its distinctive features. During the late 19th and early 20th centuries when modern Swedish nationalism evolved, traits conceived as typical Swedish were more often than not characteristics of the Mälaren Valley. For example, the Falu red cottage with white corners, often iterated as a traditional Swedish building style, is common in the Mälaren Valley, but would stand out on the Swedish west coast. Similarly, what is referred to as Standard Swedish is often difficult to distinguish from dialects spoken around Lake Mälaren. One of the distinctive features of the region is its many large mansions — one of the finest surviving examples, the World Heritage Site Engelsberg Ironworks in the north-west corner of the region, is thought of as representative for Sweden in general.\n\nLarger cities outside Greater Stockholm include Uppsala (population: 140,454), Västerås (110,877), Örebro (107,038), Södertälje (64,619) and Eskilstuna (64,679). more than 3.2 million people lived in this region, which may also be confined to a much smaller geographical area around Stockholm and Mälaren proper.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1820859", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1820859", "title": "Carlisle Cathedral", "text": "Carlisle Cathedral\n\nCarlisle Cathedral is the seat of the Anglican Bishop of Carlisle in Carlisle, Cumbria, England. It was founded as an Augustinian priory and became a cathedral in 1133.\n\nCarlisle is the second smallest of England's ancient cathedrals. Its notable features include figurative stone carving, a set of medieval choir stalls and the largest window in the Flowing Decorated Gothic style in England.\n\nCarlisle Cathedral was begun in 1122, during the reign of King Henry I, as a community of Canons Regular following the reform of the Abbey of Arrouaise in France, which followed a strict form of the canonical life, influenced by the ascetic practices of the Cistercians. Many large churches of Augustinian foundation were built in England during this period as the Archbishop of Canterbury, William de Corbeil, was a member of this order, but Carlisle is one of only four Augustinian churches in England to become a cathedral, most monastic cathedrals being Benedictine. The church was begun by Athelwold, an Englishman, who became the first prior. In 1133, the church was raised to the status of cathedral and Athelwold became the first Bishop of Carlisle (1133–55). In 1233, the cathedral priory community were joined by two friaries in the city. A Dominican friary and a Franciscan friary were founded close to the cathedral. The building was refurbished in the 13th and 14th centuries, receiving impetus from the presence of the court of Edward I in 1307.\nIn the 15th and early 16th centuries, the monastic buildings were renewed. With the Dissolution of the Monasteries from 1536, and the establishment by Henry VIII of the Church of England as the country's official church, the Dominican and Franciscan friaries were dissolved and Carlisle, along with the other monastic cathedrals, was run by a secular chapter like the cathedrals at Lincoln and York, which practice has continued to this day. During the time of the English Civil War, a portion of the nave of the cathedral was demolished by the Scottish Presbyterian Army in order to use the stone to reinforce Carlisle Castle. Between 1853 and 1870 Carlisle Cathedral was restored by Ewan Christian. In the early 19th century, the cathedral became the subject for a geometric analysis by Robert William Billings.\n\nCarlisle Cathedral was commenced in 1123 as a monastic church, possibly on the foundations of an earlier church, in the Norman architectural style with solid masonry, large round piers, round arches and smallish round headed windows. These features may still be seen in the south transept and the remaining two bays of the nave, which are now used as the Chapel of the Border Regiment. The stone is the local red sandstone, which has discoloured almost to black on parts of the exterior. The building has also suffered from subsidence which is evidenced by the piers, which lean at different angles.\n\nIn the 13th century, the choir of the cathedral was rebuilt in the Gothic style, wider than the original and on a different axis. However, the new work was severely damaged in a fire in 1292, and the work was recommenced. By 1322 the arcades and the easternmost bay were complete, with the elaborate tracery and glass of the east window being in place by about 1350. The upper stages of the walls were finished, probably by the architect John Lewen who died in about 1398. The Gothic arcade has richly moulded arches with dog-tooth decoration, and the twelve capitals are carved with vegetation along with small lively figures representing the labours of the months.\n\nThe choir is roofed by a fine wooden barrel vault dating from the 14th century. In 1856 this was restored and repainted to a new design by Owen Jones. It is thought the eastern bays of the cathedral never received a stone vault because at some point the central spire blew down, and funds were required to rebuild the damaged tower and north transept, completed in about 1420.\nThe most significant architectural feature of Carlisle Cathedral is its East Window. The tracery of this window is in the most complex of English Gothic styles, Flowing Decorated Gothic. It is the largest and most complex such window in England, being 51 feet high and 26 feet wide. It has nine lights, and tracery, which, it has been calculated, was drafted from 263 points. The tracery of the window still contains much of its original medieval glass.\n\nCarlisle Cathedral has a fine set of 46 carved wooden choir stalls with misericords, which were installed in the early 15th century. Misericords are hinged seats, \"constructed to keep the monks from falling asleep while at prayers,\" and carved with numerous figures and creatures. Despite their purpose, the \"pillars supporting the canopies bear traces of having been burnt, by weary monks who dropped off to sleep in the midst of their interminable devotions while holding a lighted candle in their hands.\" The misericords were made out of black oak, and their backs carved with scenes of the legends of St. Anthony the Hermit, St. Cuthbert, St. Augustine, and the twelve apostles, as well as mythical themes. The misericords of Carlisle include typical iconography of \"half-length angels, beasts deriving from the Bestiary, hybrid creatures, and narrative scenes, including the inverted world theme of the Woman beating a Man that no decent set of misericords could be without.\"\n\nThe delicate gilt canopy over the High Altar is a modern work designed by Sir Charles Nicholson.\n\nOther buildings of interest in the precinct are the Fratry dating from about 1500 and the Gatehouse of 1527.\n\nIn mediaeval times the Fratry building was the dining hall of the Cathedral Priory. The £3.4 million Fratry Project commenced in 2019 to add a new extension designed by architects Feilden Fowles. The Deanery incorporates a 15th-century pele tower, called The Prior's Tower, containing a fine contemporary painted ceiling.\n\nAs of 2 January 2020:\n\nThe earliest documented organ at Carlisle Cathedral is one mentioned in an inventory of 1571. The present organ was built by Henry Willis in 1856 and was innovative for its date. It was enlarged in 1875 to include the 32-foot pipes. In 1906 it was further extended by Harrison & Harrison. In 1930, the organ was moved to its present position by an unknown builder. In 1962, J. W. Walker & Sons Ltd rebuilt the organ to give it a more classical sound. In 1997, a rebuilding by David Wells sought to restore the organ to its original Victorian tone. At this time a number of new stops were added.\nThe organ has 4 manuals, 72 stops: Pedal 18 stops, Positive 14 stops, Great 13 stops, Swell 14 stops, Solo 13 stops.\n\nThe earliest recorded appointment of an organist at Carlisle Cathedral is of Thomas Southick in 1650. Notable organists have included the composer, astronomer and mathematician Thomas Greatorex and founder of the Royal School of Church Music, Sir Sydney Nicholson. The present organist is Mark Duthie.\n\nThe Carlisle Cathedral Choir dates from the foundation of the cathedral in 1133, when four laymen and six boy choristers assisted the canons with music.\n\nIn 1545, the Cathedral Statutes provided for four lay clerks and six choristers, who were to be \"boys of tender age with sonorous voices and apt at chanting\".\n\nThe present Cathedral Choir consists of 16 choristers and 6 lay clerks. The choristers were originally educated at the Cathedral's Choir School but this was closed in 1935, and the boys are instead drawn from local schools. There is now also a choir of 16 girl choristers, who alternate with the boys in singing three services a week, with Evensong sung daily except Saturday, and Choral Eucharist at 10.30am on Sundays. The boys and girls are aged from 8-13 years and are recruited from local schools. They are selected at voice trials held during the year and receive a thorough musical training. They are awarded an annual bursary and pocket money.\n\nThe Cathedral also has a choir for boys and girls aged 13–18 years who sing services in the Cathedral once a week during term time. They are conducted by Edward Taylor, the Assistant Organist. The choir last went on tour to Brittany in October 2010.\n\nThe Voluntary Choir, consisting of mixed voices, was formed to sing occasional services in the absence of the Cathedral and Youth Choirs.\n\nIn 1999 the Carlisle Cathedral Music Appeal was launched with a target of £750,000 to establish a choral foundation to enable annual bursaries and free instrumental lessons to be provided for the choristers, and scholarships and vocal tuition for the choral scholars.\n\n\nA memorial by Sir Robert Lorimer to the Border Regiment dates from 1916.\n\n\n"}

Both F-M and CLC ultimately left the locomotive business.\n\nThree different carbody variants were produced, and were differentiated as follows: Phase 1a units had their air intake louvers located in a continuous line along the top of the long hood, and a wide separating strip between the radiator fans; Phase 1b modifications were minor, consisting only of a \"dip\" in the long hood handrails that allowed them to better follow the profile of the side walkways; Phase 2 units boasted fewer air intake louvers, with large gaps separating them (the radiators themselves were divided by only a tiny metal strip).\n\nOnly one Train Master locomotive has survived intact — former Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) H-24-66 #8905 is now owned by the Canadian Railroad Historical Association, which operates the Canadian Railway Museum in Saint-Constant, Quebec.\n\nFormer Norfolk and Western Railway Train Master slugs survived well into Norfolk Southern service with one currently preserved at the Reading Railroad Heritage Museum in Hamburg, Pennsylvania.\n\n\n\n"}

They were accused of carrying out on 28 July 1959 the most famous bank robbery in a Communist state.\n\nAn armed group of six Jewish Romanian intellectuals and Communist Party cadres (Alexandru Ioanid, Paul Ioanid, Igor Sevianu, Monica Sevianu, Saşa Muşat and Haralambie Obedeanu) were alleged to have stolen 1,600,000 Romanian lei (about 250,000 US dollars in 1959) from an armoured car of the National Bank of Romania in 1959. The first five were alleged to have been in a getaway car, while Obedeanu was alleged to have been in a telephone cabin, keeping the bank's phone line busy.\n\nThe case was investigated by the Securitate, Communist Romania's secret police, and the supposed perpetrators were arrested within two months. They were rounded up in night-time raids, tried behind closed doors, and all but one sentenced to death. The executions, also kept under secrecy, including for family members, were carried out in 1960.\n\nMonica Sevianu, the only woman involved, had her sentence commuted to forced labor for life because she was a mother of two.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 1960, the government issued a propaganda film, \"Reconstituirea\" (\"The Reenactment\"), to be viewed only by Communist Party members, which reconstructed the way in which the heist had allegedly been planned and carried out. The jailed members of the Ioanid Gang acted out their own roles, either simply forced or possibly having been told that their death sentences would be commuted in return.\n\nThere were several unusual things about the story in its most common version. Beyond accusations based on various ideological guidelines, no reasons for the alleged robbery, or for the Ioanid group to have perpetrated it, were ever given. Although the persons on trial were accused of intending to donate the money to Zionist organisations that would send Romanian Jews to Israel, the stolen sum was in lei, which at the time could not be exchanged for hard currency anywhere in the world. Besides, none of the accused had been Zionists.\n\nGiven that Communist Romania was a police state, and unprecedented measures of strict control and surveillance were supposed to have been enforced in all areas of society (phone calls were routinely monitored, correspondence was intercepted, and secret police informants were common) a plan such as the one allegedly designed by the group would have been exceedingly difficult to carry out. It is also highly unlikely that the members of the \"Ioanid Gang\" could have been unaware of these facts. One of them, Alexandru Ioanid, was a colonel in the Securitate and, according to Victor Frunză, he had been related through marriage to the Securitate chief Alexandru Drăghici (he had been married to, and recently divorced from, the sister of Drăghici's wife Martha Cziko; following the divorce, Drăghici had vowed to destroy him). During many months preceding July 1959 (the date of the alleged heist), at least one of the members, Obedeanu, was aware of being followed and of being constantly watched through binoculars by the Securitate from a building across the street from his apartment. Moreover, also for months preceding July 1959 the phones of the \"Ioanid Gang\" members had been tapped. In the aftermath, several of the friends with whom they had talked lost their jobs or positions.\n\nAfter 28 July, the group was said to have engaged in reckless spending on luxuries, depicted in the original Reconstruction movie. It is, however, highly unlikely that a person living in Romania at the time, let alone such educated individuals, could have imagined being able to get away with such behaviour unnoticed by the surveillance apparatus. Moreover, in Obedeanu's case for example, the crew making the Reconstruction film resorted to bringing furnishing props, including carpets, furniture and curtains, to his apartment in order to show how he had spent the money. Obedeanu never really changed his spending habits, unlike apparently (according to Irene Lusztig) Sevianu, leading some to believe that, in trying to stage the event, authorities may have offered Sevianu money based on his more immediate needs (unlike the others, Sevianu was unemployed). Nora, Obedeanu's wife, was arrested at the same time as her husband but not accused; she was held for two months, which was the maximum allowed by law at the time. It has been indicated that Nora was interrogated only about the content of conversations among group members, and found out about bank robbery accusations only upon her release from prison. \n\nAll these aspects, together with the numerous cases of sentences based on false accusations, have led some, including relatives of the alleged robbers, to doubt that any robbery actually took place or that those charged with the crime really committed it, especially as there was no actual direct identification of the accused by the supposed witnesses. One conjecture is that the case was manufactured by the government in an attempt to justify a purge in the Securitate ranks – by accusing officers of incompetence in solving the case – as well as to remove most remaining Jews from leading positions inside the government and the Communist Party. Yet another contention with no evidence is that the executions were staged, so that the five men would have their records erased and become undercover agents abroad. Since most evidence has been filtered by the Securitate, the truth is extremely hard to discern, especially since Securitate files are unlikely to contain any self-incriminating notes of the staging of the heist, and restrict themselves to following the official story-line.\n\nAll those accused in the robbery were Jewish Communist intellectuals, all of whom had been party members during the years of underground activity (between 1924–1944 the Communist Party had been outlawed in Romania). A large party purge was put in motion in 1958, a year characterised by a move away from Soviet Russia – the Soviet troops stationed in Romania since 1944 were leaving the country – and critics of party chief Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej are ousted. The purge takes the shape of a \"Romanian ethnicisation\" of the party, ethnic Jews and Hungarians being the target. The chief ideologue put in charge of the purge was Leonte Răutu who, in spite of his Jewish roots, had become a stauch Romanian national communist. The \"gang\" members were even accused of planning to assassinate Răutu. Vladimir Tismăneanu sees the whole affair in the light of a typical Bolshevist show trial, with the Romanian national communists set out to remove Jewish intellectuals from the party. Some Jewish intellectuals, though being former underground fighters, are accused of lacking working class consciousness. Paul Ioanid's Soviet connections have become a burden, and the personal vendetta of Alexandru Drăghici and his wife Martha (née Cziko) against Alexandru Ioanid for having divorced the sister of Martha Drăghici, is given the ideological spin of him having gravely strayed from \"Socialist morals\".\n\nBased on what is known about the group members (journalists, a physicist, a history professor, and a Securitate colonel, all of them were fully cognizant of the Romanian situation) and about the political climate at the time, as well as on recollections of some family members, another scenario also seems likely. Following prolonged Securitate surveillance of the group, which resulted in the accumulation of evidence about conversations with dissident tones, members may have been blackmailed including threatened with harm against their families and themselves, and promised some reprieve or even permission to leave the country with their families, if they went along with the staging of the robbery to serve several government and personal purposes. \n\nIn this event, the government failed to uphold its end of the bargain. As a parallel, in what was a highly unusual move for those times when nobody was allowed to leave Romania, another Jewish Securitate officer, Ion Crișan, incidentally described as \"friend\" of the Ioanid group, was permitted to leave the country with his family and go to Brazil around 1961, shortly after the alleged incident; this has led some to believe that he may have been the agent through whom the government communicated its promises and made them credible.\n\nApart from the original Reconstruction movie produced by the Romanian state and widely screened before Communist Party members, there have been several other movies and documentaries, including \"Reconstruction\" (2001) by Irene Lusztig and \"The Great Communist Robbery\" (2004) by Alexandru Solomon. The film \"Closer to the Moon\" (2014) by Nae Caranfil, starring Harry Lloyd, Vera Farmiga, Mark Strong and Joe Armstrong, is fictional and very loosely connected to the real events.\n\n\n"}

He was reportedly steady, sensible, modest and usually moderate. The friendship and cooperation stopped in 1699.\n\nHans Willem was the son of Bernard, Baron Bentinck of Diepenheim and descended from an ancient and noble family of Guelders and Overijssel. He was appointed first page of honour and chamberlain. When, in 1675, Prince William was attacked by smallpox, Bentinck nursed him assiduously, and this devotion secured for him the special and enduring friendship of William. From that point on, Bentinck had the Prince's confidence, and in their correspondence William was very open.\n\nIn 1677 he was sent to England to solicit for Prince William the hand of Mary, daughter of James, Duke of York and future King of England. He was again in England on William's behalf in 1683 and in 1685. Later, in 1688, when William was preparing to assist in the overthrow of (now King) James including an invasion by Dutch troops, Bentinck went to some of the German princes to secure their support, or at least their neutrality. He had also been, since 1687, a medium of communication between his master and his English friends. Bentinck superintended the arrangements for the invasion, including raising money, hiring an enormous transport fleet, organising a propaganda offensive, and preparing the possible landing sites, and also sailed to England with Prince William.\n\nThe revolution accomplished, William (now King of England) made Bentinck Groom of the Stole, first gentleman of the bedchamber, and a Privy Counsellor. In April 1689 he was created Baron Cirencester, Viscount Woodstock and, in its second creation, Earl of Portland. (The first creation of the earldom had been made for Richard Weston in 1633, but it became extinct in 1688.) He commanded some cavalry at the Battle of the Boyne in 1690, and was present at the Battle of Landen, where he was wounded, and at the Siege of Namur in 1695.\n\nBentinck's main work was of a diplomatic nature. In 1690 he was sent to The Hague to help solve the problem between William and the burgomasters of Amsterdam. He was caught up in the corruption scandal concerning the East India Company in 1695; the board was losing its monopoly under pressure from a New Company and was engaging profusely in bribery in an attempt to renew its charter. He was however cleared in the matter. Having thwarted the Jacobite plot to murder the King in 1696, he helped to arrange the peace of Ryswick in 1697. In 1698 he was ambassador to Paris for six months. While there, he opened negotiations with Louis XIV for a partition of the Spanish monarchy, and as William's representative, signed the two partition treaties (Treaty of The Hague (1698)).\n\nWilliam Bentinck had, however, become very jealous of the rising influence of another Dutchman, Arnold van Keppel, and, in 1699, he resigned all his offices in the royal household. He did not forfeit the esteem of the King, who continued to trust and employ him. Portland had been loaded with gifts, and this, together with the jealousy felt for him as a foreigner, made him very unpopular in England. He received 135,000 acres (546 km²) of land in Ireland, and only the strong opposition of a united House of Commons prevented him obtaining a large gift of crown lands in North Wales. For his share in drawing up the partition treaties he was impeached in 1701, but the case against him did not proceed. He was occasionally employed on public business under Queen Anne until his death at his residence, Bulstrode Park in Buckinghamshire. Portland's eldest son Henry succeeded him as earl, and was granted the titles of Marquess of Titchfield and Duke of Portland in 1716.\n\nWhile living in Holland, Bentinck maintained a garden boasting many botanical rarities. Illustrations of these plants were collected under the name \"Codex Bentingiana\". This work has since disappeared from the botanical scene.\n\nLord Portland was married twice. On 1 February 1678, he married his first wife, Anne Villiers (died 30 November 1688), daughter of Sir Edward Villiers and his wife Lady Frances Howard, daughter of the 2nd Earl of Suffolk. \nThey had seven children:\n\nHe married on 12 May 1700, his second wife, Jane Martha Temple (167226 May 1751), daughter of Sir John Temple, and widow of John Berkeley, 3rd Baron Berkeley of Stratton. \nThey had the following children:\n\n\n\n"}

Her disappearance from Duluth, Georgia, sparked a nationwide search and intensive media coverage, including media speculation that Mason had killed her. On April 29, Wilbanks called Mason from Albuquerque, New Mexico, and falsely claimed that she had been kidnapped and sexually assaulted by a Hispanic man and a white woman.\n\nJennifer Wilbanks gained notoriety in the United States and internationally, and her story persisted as a major topic of national news coverage for some time after she was found unharmed. Many critics of the mass media attacked the coverage as a \"media circus\". Howard Kurtz, an influential media critic for \"The Washington Post\" and CNN-TV, and Fox News wrote that the runaway bride had become a \"runaway television embarrassment\", comparing the story to a TV soap opera.\n\nWilbanks repeated the false claims that fell apart under FBI interrogation resulting in a felony indictment of providing false information to law enforcement, a charge that could have resulted in up to five years of imprisonment. On June 2, 2005, Wilbanks pleaded no contest to this charge. As part of her plea bargain, she was sentenced to two years of probation and 120 hours of community service, and she was also ordered to pay $2,250 in restitution to the Gwinnett County Sheriff's Department. As part of the plea bargain, a misdemeanor charge of filing a false police report was dismissed. Wilbanks's criminal record was expunged after she successfully completed her period of probation.\n\nOn March 15, 2008, Wilbanks's ex-fiancé, John Mason, married another woman, Shelley Martin, in a quiet ceremony at his parents' home in Duluth, Georgia. Wilbanks and Mason's original wedding was to have had 600 guests and 28 bridesmaids.\n\n\nOn May 22, 2006, \"People\" magazine reported that Wilbanks and Mason had officially called off their engagement.\n\nAccording to the BBC, Jennifer Wilbanks sold the media rights to her story to a New York City company for $500,000. Wilbanks did not offer to repay the whole cost of the search for her, which totaled almost $43,000.\n\nIn September 2006, Wilbanks filed a lawsuit against her ex-fiancé, claiming that while she was hospitalized and under medication, she granted Mason power of attorney to negotiate the sale of the couple's story to a publisher in New York. According to her, Mason negotiated a deal for $500,000 and then used the money to buy a house, in his name only, from which he later evicted Wilbanks. She claimed $250,000 as her share of the house, and another $250,000 in punitive damages. Mason countersued, claiming emotional distress from being left at the altar. In December 2006, both of the parties dropped their respective lawsuits. In June 2010, Wilbanks announced via Facebook that she had been dating twice-divorced landscaper Greg Hutson since early in 2009.\n\nHerobuilders, a manufacturer of action figures, rushed to produce a doll representing Wilbanks, wearing a jogging suit bearing the slogan \"Vegas baby\". It came with a small towel, to put over the doll's head, to model how she appeared on TV when in the custody of Albuquerque Police.\n\nWilbanks has inspired a \"Runaway Bride\" action figure and a hot sauce called \"Jennifer's High Tailin' Hot Sauce\". An auction on eBay of a slice of toast carved with a likeness of Wilbanks closed with a winning bid of $15,400.\n\nNearly two years after Wilbanks ran away, the incident was used by the Albuquerque Police Department as a means of attracting new recruits to the police force. The police department used the image of a bride in a white wedding dress and veil being apprehended by Police Officer Trish Hoffman, posted on a billboard with the advertisement reading \"Running away from your current job? Call APD Recruiting\" followed by the police department's telephone number. Hoffman was the officer who was pictured in the media leading Wilbanks through Albuquerque International Sunport after being taken into custody. The Police Department's reasoning for using the image was the fact that many people would recognize the reference to the incident and that people still talked about the incident.\n\nA musical play based on the story of Jennifer Wilbanks opened on March 13, 2008, at the Red Clay Theater in Duluth, Georgia.\n\nA photo of Wilbanks appears in the trailer of the 2008 movie about professional poker, \"The Grand\", as one of the many women Woody Harrelson's character has been married to in the past.\n\nWilbanks' case is frequently used as an example, in both scholarly and popular articles and books. In 2012 \"Psychology Today\" wrote an article about cold feet that cited Wilbanks as an example. Diana M. Concannon textbook \"Kidnapping: An Investigator’s Guide\" began its chapter on staged kidnappings by using Wilbanks' case as an example.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1820902", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1820902", "title": "Pyroelectric fusion", "text": "Pyroelectric fusion\n\nPyroelectric fusion refers to the technique of using pyroelectric crystals to generate high strength electrostatic fields to accelerate deuterium ions (tritium might also be used someday) into a metal hydride target also containing deuterium (or tritium) with sufficient kinetic energy to cause these ions to undergo nuclear fusion. It was reported in April 2005 by a team at UCLA. The scientists used a pyroelectric crystal heated from −34 to 7 °C (−29 to 45 °F), combined with a tungsten needle to produce an electric field of about 25 gigavolts per meter to ionize and accelerate deuterium nuclei into an erbium deuteride target. Though the energy of the deuterium ions generated by the crystal has not been directly measured, the authors used 100 keV (a temperature of about 10 K) as an estimate in their modeling. At these energy levels, two deuterium nuclei can fuse together to produce a helium-3 nucleus, a 2.45 MeV neutron and bremsstrahlung. Although it makes a useful neutron generator, the apparatus is not intended for power generation since it requires far more energy than it produces.\n\nThe process of light ion acceleration using electrostatic fields and deuterium ions to produce fusion in solid deuterated targets was first demonstrated by Cockcroft and Walton in 1932 (see Cockcroft-Walton generator). Indeed, the process is used today in thousands of miniaturized versions of their original accelerator, in the form of small sealed tube neutron generators, in the petroleum exploration industry.\n\nThe process of pyroelectricity has been known from ancient times. The first use of a pyroelectric field to accelerate deuterons was in 1997 in an experiment conducted by Drs. V.D. Dougar Jabon, G.V. Fedorovich, and N.V. Samsonenko. This group was the first to utilize a lithium tantalate () pyroelectric crystal in fusion experiments.\n\nThe novel idea with the pyroelectric approach to fusion is in its application of the pyroelectric effect to generate the accelerating electric fields. This is done by heating the crystal from −30°F to +45°F over a period of a few minutes.\n\nIn April 2005, a UCLA team headed by chemistry professor James K. Gimzewski and physics professor Seth Putterman utilized a tungsten probe attached to a pyroelectric crystal in order to increase the electric field strength. Brian Naranjo, a graduate student working under Putterman, conducted the experiment demonstrating the use of a pyroelectric power source for producing fusion on a laboratory bench top device. The device used a lithium tantalate () pyroelectric crystal to ionize deuterium atoms and to accelerate the deuterons towards a stationary erbium dideuteride (D) target. Around 1000 fusion reactions per second took place, each resulting in the production of an 820 keV helium-3 nucleus and a 2.45 MeV neutron. The team anticipates applications of the device as a neutron generator or possibly in microthrusters for space propulsion.\n\nA team at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, led by Yaron Danon and his graduate student Jeffrey Geuther, improved upon the UCLA experiments using a device with two pyroelectric crystals and capable of operating at non-cryogenic temperatures.\n\nNuclear D-D fusion driven by pyroelectric crystals was proposed by Naranjo and Putterman in 2002. It was also discussed by Brownridge and Shafroth in 2004. The possibility of using pyroelectric crystals in a neutron production device (by D-D fusion) was proposed in a conference paper by Geuther and Danon in 2004 and later in a publication discussing electron and ion acceleration by pyroelectric crystals. None of these later authors had prior knowledge of the earlier 1997 experimental work conducted by Dougar Jabon, Fedorovich, and Samsonenko which mistakenly believed that fusion occurred within the crystals. The key ingredient of using a tungsten needle to produce sufficient ion beam current for use with a pyroelectric crystal power supply was first demonstrated in the 2005 \"Nature\" paper, although in a broader context tungsten emitter tips have been used as ion sources in other applications for many years. In 2010, it was found that tungsten emitter tips are not necessary to increase the acceleration potential of pyroelectric crystals; the acceleration potential can allow positive ions to reach kinetic energies between 300 and 310 keV.\n\nPyroelectric fusion has been hyped in the news media, which has overlooked the earlier experimental work of Dougar Jabon, Fedorovich and Samsonenko. Pyroelectric fusion is not related to the earlier claims of fusion reactions, having been observed during sonoluminescence (bubble fusion) experiments conducted under the direction of Rusi Taleyarkhan of Purdue University. In fact, Naranjo of the UCLA team has been one of the main critics of these earlier prospective fusion claims from Taleyarkhan.\n\nThe first successful results with pyroelectric fusion using a tritiated target was reported in 2010. The UCLA team of Putterman and Naranjo worked with T. Venhaus of Los Alamos National Laboratory to measure a 14.1 MeV neutron signal far above background. This was a natural extension of the earlier work with deuterated targets.\n\n\n"}

Oliver Cromwell wrote, in a letter to Sir William Spring in 1643, of the archetypal plain, russet-coated captain who embodies the ideal of republican soldiery. (Many of those who supported the Good Old Cause were also Independents who advocated local congregational control of religious and church matters.)\n\nThose who disagreed with expedient political compromises made during the period of the Protectorate, went back to the Army's own declarations during the wars: to republican pamphlets like those produced by John Lilburne, Marchamont Nedham and John Milton. With their discontent, they imagined that there had been a moment of revolutionary purity when all these writers had agreed on something intrinsically republican and good, this entity - shifting depending upon the writer - was often labelled the \"Good Old Cause\".\n\nAfter the death of Oliver Cromwell the phrase came into use gradually, passing to and fro in documents and speeches. By April 1659 and for months afterwards it was frequently heard in general discourse and every second or third pamphlet in the booksellers' shops had \"The Good Old Cause\" on its title-page or running through its text.\n\nThe phrase was open to interpretation, but in 1659 to its exponents it meant the pure Republican constitution which had been founded on the Regicide and which lasted until Cromwell's dissolution of the Rump Parliament on 20 April 1653. It proclaimed that Cromwell's interim dictatorship and Protectorate had been an interruption of the natural course of things, dexterously leaving it an open question whether that interruption had been necessary or justifiable, but calling on all men, now that Cromwell was dead and his effectiveness gone with him, to regard his rule as exceptional and extraordinary, and to revert to the old Commonwealth.\n\nIn April 1660 General John Lambert tried to raise an army against the restoration of The Crown in favour of the Commonwealth by issuing a proclamation calling on all supporters of the \"Good Old Cause\" to rally on the battlefield of Edgehill, but he was arrested before arriving at the old battlefield and gathering enough forces to threaten General George Monck, the power behind the restoration movement. In October the same year Daniel Axtell, the officer who had commanded the guard during the Trial of Charles I, went to his execution unrepentant declaring that \"If I had a thousand lives, I could lay them all down for the [Good Old] Cause\". Similarly, Algernon Sidney, before his execution for allegedly being involved in the Rye House Plot in 1683, thanked God for allowing him to die \"for that [Good] Old Cause in which I was from my youth engaged\".\n\nThe \"Good Old Cause\" became, in the hands of radicals in the 18th and 19th centuries, one of the main supports to agitation within England by linking their cause to the cause of the English Civil War radicals. This memory was sustained by the publication of various tracts about the civil war across the 18th Century — Edmund Ludlow's \"Memoirs\" in 1701 by John Toland for instance that sought to radicalise the memory of the English Civil War.\n\nWork on the republican imagination includes Jonathan Scott on Algernon Sydney and seventeenth-century republicanism, Nigel Smith on the radical John Streater, and Blair Worden on the memory of the Civil Wars.\n\n\n\nAttribution:\n\n"}

Following his professional football career, Miller has worked as a football analyst on radio and television.\n\nMiller attended Waterford Kettering High School in Waterford, Michigan, and graduated in 1989. He started as the Captain's varsity quarterback his sophomore year and held that position through his senior year. Miller also played baseball and basketball.\n\nMiller was a starting quarterback for the Michigan State Spartans for three years, beginning as a sophomore. As a senior, he led the 1993 Spartans to a 6–5 regular season record, and a berth in the Liberty Bowl, which they lost to Louisville, 18–7. He finished with a final record of 14–24, and passed for a total of 5037 yards. Miller then played in the 1994 Senior Bowl, passing for 75 yards (7-for-10) and one interception.\n\nMiller was drafted in the 6th round of the 1994 NFL Draft by the Pittsburgh Steelers, 178th overall. He broke a thumb in training camp, and missed most of the 1994 season. In the spring of 1995, while still under contract with the Steelers, Miller was assigned to the Frankfurt Galaxy of the World League of American Football in order to get playing time; he played briefly with the Galaxy before suffering a wrist injury. Miller later appeared in a total of five games with the Steelers, who released him prior to the 1997 regular season. During the 1997 season, Miller was briefly with the Jacksonville Jaguars, before joining the Atlanta Falcons — he did not appear in a game for either team. Miller next signed with the Detroit Lions in March 1998, but was released by the team in August, prior to the start of the regular season. He then nearly had a contract with the Dallas Cowboys, however the Cowboys changed their mind when Mike Quinn became available. In December 1998, Miller signed with the Chicago Bears, following a season-ending injury to Erik Kramer.\n\nIt was not until 1999, in his second year with the Bears, that Miller earned a starting job. That promising season was cut short for Miller when he became the first quarterback to be suspended by the NFL for violation of its substance abuse policy. Miller contended he did not read the label on an over-the-counter dietary supplement containing the steroid nandrolone, a banned substance under the NFL's drug policy. He was suspended for four games at the end of the 1999 season and lost about $100,000 in pay.\n\nUpon his return, Miller became established as the starter for the Bears' brief playoff run in 2001, their first berth since 1994. With the second-best record in the NFC and tied for the second-best record in the NFL along with the Pittsburgh Steelers at 13–3, the Chicago Bears were awarded a first-round bye. This was due in large part to the Bears top-ranked defense as well as the ball control offense Miller led. On January 19, 2002, the Chicago Bears met the Philadelphia Eagles in the NFC Divisional Playoffs with Miller as quarterback. The Eagles were ahead 6–0 early in the second quarter when Miller threw an interception; during the runback, Eagles' defensive end Hugh Douglas delivered a hit to Miller that resulted in a separated shoulder; Douglas was later fined $35,000 by the NFL. Miller had passed for only 23 yards (3-for-5, with 1 interception) in what was his lone playoff appearance, and Shane Matthews, who replaced Miller for the rest of the game, only passed for 66 yards (8-for-17, with 2 interceptions), as the Bears lost to the Eagles, 33–19.\n\nMiller lost his position as starting quarterback in 2002. Although he did not make a pass attempt thereafter, he received a Super Bowl ring as the backup quarterback for the 2004 New England Patriots. Before the 2005 season, Miller signed with the New York Giants, but was released after having hip surgery and receiving an injury settlement.\n\n\nSource:\n\nSource:\n\nMiller served as the color commentator for Michigan State football radio broadcasts and hosted the weekly post-game call-in show from 2006 until he took a communications position with the Bears in 2013; he was replaced by Jason Strayhorn. Miller currently serves as a studio analyst on \"Bears Postgame Live\" for NBC Sports Chicago, having replaced former Bears legend Richard Dent in 2007. Miller is the current co-host of \"Movin' the Chains\" along with Pat Kirwan on SiriusXM NFL Radio, Channel 88. Miller and Kirwan are featured as analysts in \"Longshot\", a story mode within \"Madden NFL 18\".\n\n"}

Hyde Park became part of a new Headingley and Hyde Park ward, shared with the Leeds North West constituency.\n\nThe business and retail centre of Leeds is at the heart. A relatively affluent hub having a large minority of its housing forming by luxury, well-served apartments or streets of grand middle-class Victorian houses, the seat has sporadic deprivation, typified by certain densely packed rows of terraced houses, home to many Labour-inclined and often low-income voters. Two large, well-ranked, universities in the city centre, the professional services sector and a 21st-century increase in technology businesses has brought prosperity to the younger generations of the city. The older generations of the city have lived through the closure of many mass consumer product manufacturing and materials processing businesses in Leeds throughout the mid-20th century. Leeds' two universities produce a significant student electorate. Middleton in the south of the seat has a golf course, a miniature railway and an upcoming urban mountain bike trail centre within the boundaries.\n\nThe constituency was created in 1885 by the Redistribution of Seats Act 1885, and was first used in the general election of that year *the large Leeds seat had previously been represented by two MPs (1832–1868) and three MPs (1868–1885)). From 1885 it was represented by five single-member constituencies: Leeds Central, Leeds East, Leeds North, Leeds South and Leeds West. The constituencies of Morley, Otley and Pudsey were also created in 1885. The constituency was abolished in 1955. After the 1955 general election Leeds was represented by Leeds East (created 1885, abolished 1918, recreated 1955), Leeds North East (created 1918), Leeds North West (created 1950), Leeds South (created 1885), and Leeds South East (created 1918). There were also constituencies of Batley and Morley (created 1918) and Pudsey (created 1885, replaced by Pudsey and Otley 1918–1950).\n\nThe constituency was re-created for the 1983 general election.\n\nThe seat has been won by the Labour Party's candidate since 1983. Benn, elected in 1999 on the demise of Fatchett, has achieved an absolute majority (plurality of votes) in three of five elections for Leeds Central. The 2015 result made the seat the 40-safest of Labour's 232 seats by percentage of majority.\n\nConservative runner-up, Wilson, in 2015 failed to reflect the positive national swing and fell to 17.3% of the votes cast. A candidature of UKIP, not present in 2010, saw a total share of the vote, hence positive swing, of 15.7% and thus third position.. Green Party running, not present in 2010, resulted in a 7.9% polling and fourth-place, its candidate retained his deposit. The fifth-placed Liberal Democrat forfeited her deposit..\n\nIn general elections turnout has ranged from 87.9% in 1910 to 41.7% in 2001.

Clayton played college football for Oklahoma from 2001 to 2004. He was drafted by the Baltimore Ravens in the first round of the 2005 NFL Draft and also played for the St. Louis Rams.\n\nMark Clayton obtained his communications degree in 2010 through the university's degree completion program.\n\nAfter redshirting in Oklahoma's 2000 national championship season, Clayton's college career began in 2001, when he started 8 of Oklahoma's 13 games, and made 46 catches for 524 yards and 3 touchdowns as the Sooners won the Cotton Bowl Classic. In 2002, he made only one start, but managed 26 receptions for 416 yards, including 5 touchdowns, which tied for the team lead among receivers. In that year, the Sooners won the Big 12 championship as well as the Rose Bowl, a first for any Big 12 team.\n\nHis profile exploded in 2003, as he garnered All-American and All-Big 12 honors after a junior season in which he took aim on the school record book. His 83 receptions, 1,425 yards, and 15 touchdowns all smashed previous marks (66, 1,034, and 7, respectively). The quarterback who threw the passes, Jason White, won the Heisman Trophy, and the Sooners advanced to the Sugar Bowl before losing to national champion LSU. Clayton was a Biletnikoff Award finalist. Several of Clayton's \"highlight reel\" catches during this season demonstrated his ability to gain large numbers of yards after the catch (YAC).\n\nClayton's 2004 senior year again netted All-America and All-Big 12 recognition, though his 66 receptions, 876 yards, and 8 touchdowns were not quite as eye-popping as the previous season. The Sooners again won the Big 12 championship and played for the national title against USC, though they lost in the Orange Bowl. Clayton set the record for career receiving yards with 3,241.\n\nClayton was the 22nd overall selection in the 2005 NFL Draft by the Baltimore Ravens. He started his rookie season slowly due to various injuries but picked up speed during the latter part of the season; a major part of his rehabilitation process was guided by his best friend Christopher Pannozzo. He finished the year with 44 receptions for 471 yards and 2 touchdowns. He also added 8 rushes for 33 yards and a touchdown.\n\nIn his second year, his stats improved significantly, with 67 receptions for 939 yards and 5 touchdowns.\n\nIn 2007, Clayton had 48 receptions for 531 yards, down from his impressive 2006 season. He dealt with various injuries throughout the 2007 season, but was active for most of it.\n\nIn 2008, Clayton had some bright spots during the year. He had 4 catches for 87 yards and a touchdown against the Cleveland Browns, 5 catches for 164 yards and a touchdown against the Cincinnati Bengals, and 4 catches for 128 yards against the Jacksonville Jaguars. The Ravens won each game. Clayton had receptions of 70, 48, and 53 yards.\nIn Week 13, at the division rival Cincinnati Bengals, Clayton had what was arguably the best game of his career. He had five receptions for 164 yards, which included a 70-yard receiving touchdown, the second longest touchdown of his career. He also had one pass attempt on a trick end-around play, which he completed for a 32-yard touchdown pass to fellow wide receiver Derrick Mason, the only touchdown pass of his career. Clayton helped the Ravens rout the Bengals 34-3. \nClayton finished the season with 695 yards on 41 receptions, 3 receiving TDs, 1 rushing TD, and 1 passing TD.\n\nMark Clayton had his least productive year as a full-time, healthy starter in 2009, as QB Joe Flacco targeted WR Mason, TE Todd Heap, and RB Ray Rice more than Clayton. In fact, Rice led the team in receptions for much of the year. Clayton finished the season with 34 receptions for 480 yards, and 2 scores.\n\nOn September 6, 2010, Mark Clayton was traded to the St. Louis Rams along with a 7th round pick in the 2011 NFL Draft in exchange for a 6th round selection in the 2011 NFL Draft. In his first game as a Ram and having only been with the club less than a week Clayton caught 10 passes for 119 yards (two touchdowns) to lead the team in both categories. In Week 5, Clayton was placed on injury reserve with a torn patellar tendon in his right knee, which ended his season. Before the injury, he had emerged as a valued veteran presence on the team, and rookie Sam Bradford's top receiving target. He was re-signed by the Rams on August 31, 2011.\n\nIn the 2011 season, Clayton played in two games, starting one, and caught three passes for 26 yards.\n\nIn May 2013, Clayton announced his retirement from football. He finished his career with 260 receptions for 3,448 yards and 14 touchdowns.\n\n<div style=\"overflow: auto\">\nMark Clayton is the founder of Livv Headphones.

{"id": "1820960", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1820960", "title": "Transpersonal", "text": "Transpersonal\n\nThe transpersonal is a term used by different schools of philosophy and psychology in order to describe experiences and worldviews that extend beyond the personal level of the psyche, and beyond mundane worldly events.\n\nThe transpersonal has been defined as experiences in which the sense of identity or self extends beyond (trans) the individual or personal to encompass wider aspects of humankind, life, psyche or cosmos. On the other hand, transpersonal practices are those structured activities that focus on inducing transpersonal experiences.\n\nIn the \"Textbook of Transpersonal Psychiatry and Psychology\", Scotton defined the term as \"development beyond conventional, personal or individual levels.\" It is associated with a developmental model of psychology that includes three successive stages: the prepersonal (before ego-formation), the personal (the functioning ego), and the transpersonal (ego remains available but is superseded by higher development).\n\nOne of the founders of the field of transpersonal psychology, Stanislav Grof, has defined transpersonal states of awareness as such: \"The common denominator of this otherwise rich and ramified group of phenomena is the feeling of the individual that his consciousness expanded beyond the usual ego boundaries and the limitations of time and space.\"\n\nThe term is related to the terminology of peak experience, altered states of consciousness, and spiritual experiences. The term is also associated with psychedelic work, and psychotechnologies, that includes research with psychedelic plants and chemicals such as LSD, ibogaine, ketamine, peyote, ayahuasca and the vast variety of substances available to all human cultures throughout history.\n\nThe term has an early precedent in the writing of philosopher William James, who used the term \"Trans-personal\" in one of his lectures from 1905. However, this early terminology, introduced by James, had a different meaning than the current one and its context was philosophy, not psychology, which is where the term is mostly used these days.\n\nThere has also been some speculation of an early precedent of the term in the writings of Carl Jung, as a result of the work of Jung's translators. It regards the Jungian term \"ueberpersonlich\", used by Jung in a paper from 1917, which in later English translations appeared as \"superpersonal\", and later, \"transpersonal\". In a later, revised, version of the \"Psychology of the Unconscious\" (1942) there was even a chapter heading called \"The Personal and the Collective (or Transpersonal) Unconscious\".\n\nHowever, the origin of the term transpersonal, as it is currently used in academic writing, is mostly associated with the human potential movement of the 1960s and the founders of the field of transpersonal psychology; Anthony Sutich, Abraham Maslow and Stanislav Grof. According to Vich all three had used the term as early as 1967, in order to describe new ideas in the field of Psychology. In 1968 the term was selected by the founding editors of the Journal of Transpersonal Psychology, Abraham Maslow and Anthony Sutich, in order to represent a new area of psychological inquiry. Porter locates the start of the so-called transpersonal psychology movement to the American west-coast in the late 1960s. In addition to Maslow, Vich and Grof the movement was associated with the names of Ken Wilber, Frances Vaughan, Roger Walsh and Seymoor Boorstein.\n\nAccording to Powers the term \"transpersonal\" starts to show up in academic journals from 1970 and onwards. The use of the term in academic literature is documented in \"Psychological Abstracts\" and Dissertations Abstracts. The use of the term grew during the 1970s and 1980s and stabilized in the 1990s.\n\nThe collective of people and organizations with an interest in the transpersonal is called the transpersonal movement. Walsh and Vaughan defines the transpersonal movement as the interdisciplinary movement that includes various individual transpersonal disciplines.\n\nThe philosophy of William James, the school of psychosynthesis (founded by Roberto Assagioli), and the analytical school of Carl Jung are often considered to be forerunners to the establishment of transpersonal theory. However, the start of the movement is associated with the emergence and growth of the related field of humanistic psychology. Several of the academic profiles of the early transpersonal movement, such as Abraham Maslow and Anthony Sutich, had their background in humanistic psychology.\n\nThe formative years of the transpersonal movement can be characterized by the founding of a few key organizations and institutions, such as: the Institute of Noetic Sciences in 1973, The International Transpersonal Psychology Association in 1973, Naropa Institute in 1974, and the California Institute of Transpersonal Psychology in 1975. The California Institute of Transpersonal Psychology later emerged as the Institute of Transpersonal Psychology and is today known as Sofia University.\n\nContemporary transpersonal disciplines include transpersonal psychology, transpersonal psychiatry, transpersonal anthropology, transpersonal sociology and transpersonal ecology. Other academic orientations, whose main focus lies elsewhere, but that are associated with a transpersonal perspective, include humanistic psychology and near-death studies. Contemporary institutions include: the Association for Transpersonal Psychology (ATP), the European Transpersonal Psychology Association (EPTA), the International Transpersonal Association (ITA), the Ibero-American Transpersonal Association (ATI) and the European Transpersonal Association (Eurotas). Leading publications within the movement include: the \"Journal of Transpersonal Psychology\", the \"International Journal of Transpersonal Studies\", and the \"Journal of Transpersonal Research\".\n\nSeveral commentators note how the transpersonal field, and its vision, moved beyond the perspective of psychology and into other transpersonal domains during the 1980s and 1990s. This expansion of the transpersonal concept resulted in an interdisciplinary situation, and a dialogue with such fields as social work, ecology, art, literature, acting, law, business, entrepreneurship, ecopsychology, feminism and education.\n\nIn this respect, commentators have suggested that there is a difference between the founding field of transpersonal psychology and a broader field of transpersonal inquiry, transpersonal studies. This differentiation of the transpersonal field has to do with the scope of the subjects under study, and the interest of researchers and theorists.\n\nIn their review of transpersonal definitions, published in 1993, Walsh and Vaughan noted that transpersonal studies had grown beyond the founding field of transpersonal psychology. Commenting on the criticisms of transpersonal psychology in the 1980s, Chinen noted how the criticism did not differentiate between transpersonal psychology, on the one hand, and a broad range of popularized transpersonal orientations, on the other. The same line of reasoning was picked up by Friedman, who differentiated between a broad domain of inquiry known as transpersonal studies, and a more narrow field of transpersonal psychology. Both authors argued that the confounding of the two domains resulted in confusion. In a summary of contemporary viewpoints on transpersonal psychology Jorge Ferrer placed transpersonal psychology within the wider \"umbrella\" known as transpersonal studies.\n\nAmong institutions of higher learning that promote transpersonal studies we find Sofia University and California Institute of Integral Studies. In 2012 Sofia University announced that they were expanding their graduate program in order to include transpersonal studies. The new program was named the Graduate School of Transpersonal Studies.\n\nThe International Journal of Transpersonal Studies was established in 1981. It is sponsored by the California Institute of Integral Studies and serves as the official publication of the International Transpersonal Association.\n\n"}

He had held the posts of Leader of the Opposition (1997–2001), Foreign Secretary (2010–2014) and Leader of the House of Commons (2014-2015).\n\nThe constituency consists of in the west the entire Richmondshire district and in the east the northern part of Hambleton District. A mostly rural seat, the population is almost wholly self-supportive and in national terms affluent.\n\nRichmond was one of the parliamentary boroughs in the Unreformed House of Commons that dates to the middle of its long existence, first being represented in 1585. In modern times it has been an ultra-safe seat for the Conservative Party.\n\nFrom 1983, the seat was represented by the cabinet minister Leon Brittan, after boundary changes saw his Cleveland and Whitby seat abolished; however, he resigned from the Commons in December 1988 in order to take up the position of Vice-President of the European Commission.\n\nThe ensuing by-election, held in February 1989, was won by William Hague: this was the last by-election won by a Conservative candidate during the Conservative Government of 1979-1997. Hague's win has been attributed in part to the decision by the remnants of the Social Democratic Party (those members that objected to the merger with the Liberal Party the previous year) to contest the election as well as the newly merged Social and Liberal Democrats (who subsequently renamed themselves the Liberal Democrats). The SDP candidate, local farmer Mike Potter, came second, and Hague's majority of 2,634 was considerably smaller than the number of votes (11,589) for the SLD candidate Barbara Pearce. Despite the Labour landslide of 1997, they did not come close to winning the seat, which stayed Conservative with a majority of 10,000. Hague retained the seat at every general election from then on, building the Conservative majority to 23,336, until his decision to step down at the 2015 election.\n\nIn 1992, the Labour candidate until a few weeks before the election, David Abrahams, was deselected after a series of rows within the local party over his personal life and business interests. It emerged in 2007 that he used the name \"David Martin\" when dealing with tenants in his various rental properties in the Newcastle area, and that he had claimed that he lived with his wife and son, though he had never been married. Divorcee Anthea Bailey later told a local newspaper she and her 11-year-old son had posed as Mr Abrahams' family as part of a business arrangement so that Abrahams could create \"the right impression\".\n\nAt the 2001 general election, Richmond became the Conservatives' safest seat in the UK, both in terms of the actual numerical majority and by percentage, the seat being held by then Conservative leader Hague. Although the numerical majority was surpassed by Buckingham at the 2005 election, Richmond has a smaller electorate and had a greater proportion of Conservative voters so retained the second largest percentage majority. Again in 2010, Richmond was the safest Conservative seat in the country, in terms of numerical and percentage majority.\n\n1918–1950: The Borough of Richmond, the Urban Districts of Kirklington-cum-Upsland, Masham, and Northallerton, and the Rural Districts of Aysgarth, Bedale, Croft, Leyburn, Northallerton, Reeth, Richmond, Startforth, and Stokesley.\n\n1950–1955: The Borough of Richmond, the Urban District of Northallerton, and the Rural Districts of Aysgarth, Croft, Leyburn, Masham, Northallerton, Reeth, Richmond, Startforth, and Stokesley.\n\n1955–1974: As prior but with redrawn boundaries.\n\n1974–1983: As prior but with redrawn boundaries.\n\n1983–1997: The District of Richmondshire, and the District of Hambleton wards of Appleton Wiske, Bedale, Brompton, Broughton and Greenhow, Carlton Miniott, Crakehall, Great Ayton, Hillside, Leeming, Leeming Bar, Morton-on-Swale, Northallerton North East, Northallerton South East, Northallerton West, Osmotherley, Romanby, Romanby Broomfield, Rudby, Sowerby, Stokesley, Swainby, Tanfield, The Cowtons, The Thorntons, Thirsk, Topcliffe, and Whitestonecliffe.\n\n1997–2010: The District of Richmondshire, and the District of Hambleton wards of Appleton Wiske, Brompton, Broughton and Greenhow, Great Ayton, Leeming Bar, Morton-on-Swale, Northallerton North East, Northallerton South East, Northallerton West, Osmotherley, Romanby, Romanby Broomfield, Rudby, Stokesley, Swainby, and The Cowtons.\n\n2010–present: The District of Richmondshire, and the District of Hambleton wards of Bedale, Brompton, Broughton and Greenhow, Cowtons, Crakehall, Great Ayton, Leeming, Leeming Bar, Morton-on-Swale, Northallerton Broomfield, Northallerton Central, Northallerton North, Osmotherley, Romanby, Rudby, Stokesley, Swainby, and Tanfield.\n\nThe Richmond constituency covers the Richmondshire district and the northern part of the Hambleton district.

Placed in reserve, the ship lay idle before being reactivated for World War II. She was transferred to the Royal Canadian Navy in 1940, where she served as HMCS \"St. Francis\" (I93) in the Battle of the Atlantic escorting convoys. The ship was declared surplus in April 1945, sold for scrap and sank on the way to the breakers after a collision in July.\n\nNamed for George Bancroft an American historian and diplomat, the destroyer was launched on 21 March 1919 by Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation's Fore River Shipyard in Quincy, Massachusetts, sponsored by Miss Mary W. Bancroft, great granddaughter of George Bancroft. The ship was commissioned on 30 June 1919, Lieutenant Commander H. S. Haislip in command.\n\n\"Bancroft\" joined the Atlantic Fleet and took part in fleet training activities until 26 November 1919 when the ship went into reserve commission. The destroyer was placed out of commission at Philadelphia on 11 July 1922. \"Bancroft\" was recommissioned 18 December 1939 and served with the Atlantic Squadron on the east coast until decommissioned at Halifax, Nova Scotia. She was then transferred to Great Britain in the destroyer-land bases exchange on 24 September 1940.\n\n\"Bancroft\" was allocated to the Royal Canadian Navy and was taken over by the Canadians on 24 September 1940. Following the Canadian practice of naming destroyers after Canadian rivers (but with deference to the U.S. origin), the destroyer was renamed HMCS \"St. Francis\" after the St. Francis River forming the border between northern Maine and Quebec and New Brunswick. \"St. Francis\" left Halifax 15 January 1941 and arrived in the River Clyde, Scotland, 26 January. She joined the 4th Escort Group and on 20 May she rescued all the survivors of the steamship \"Starcrose\" which had to be sunk after being torpedoed by a submarine. At the end of June she escorted a troop convoy to the Middle East and in July she joined the newly formed Newfoundland Escort Force. Between 1941 and 1943 \"St. Francis\" made several attacks on enemy submarines while escorting convoys ON-95, SC-85, ON-105, HX-197, and ON-116 with Mid-Ocean Escort Force group C-4. \"St. Francis\" subsequently escorted convoy ON-121 with Escort Group C-3, convoy SC-99 with Escort Group C-1, and convoy ON-147 with Escort Group C-4.\n\nAfter refitting at Halifax, \"St. Francis\" joined Escort Group C2 in the Western Approaches Command in June 1943 but in August was transferred to the 9th Escort Group (RCN), working from Londonderry Port, Northern Ireland. She was reassigned to the Western Local Escort Force at Halifax the following month. From early 1944 she was employed on training duties at Digby, Nova Scotia, where on 1 April 1945 she was declared surplus.\n\nOn her way to Baltimore to be broken up by the Boston Iron & Metal Co. in July 1945, the destroyer sank as a result of a collision off Cape Cod, Massachusetts.\n\n\n"}

In a contemporary review of the album for \"Rolling Stone\", critic Simon Frith found that \"Ferry's imagery is focused... and there's less synthesized clutter, fewer sound effects, more straight solo trading.\" In a glowing review, \"Melody Maker\" wrote: \"It's a superb album, striking the listener immediately with a force and invention reserved only for the most special musical experiences... There's a crispness and vitality in Chris Thomas' production which is reminiscent of the sense of adventure and cavalier spirit which marked their early recordings, an impetuosity which has lately been absent from their work.\" \"Siren\" placed at number 13 on \"The Village Voice\"s 1975 Pazz and Jop critics' poll. \"The Village Voice\"s Robert Christgau found it to be a \"Good album—a lot of fast ones and a great hook\", later placing it at number 11 on his Dean's List of the best albums of the year. Critic Dave Marsh rated it the year's fourth best album in his \"Book of Rock Lists\".\n\nThe 1983 edition of \"The Rolling Stone Album Guide\" states: \"\"Siren\"'s title is appropriate; it has that sort of effect on the listener. It is Roxy's masterpiece, calling the listener back by virtue of its finely honed instrumental attack and compelling lyrical attitude.\" Rob Sheffield, in 2004's \"The New Rolling Stone Album Guide\", refers to \"Siren\" as \"the first Roxy Music album without any failed moments\". In the \"Spin Alternative Record Guide\", the album is cited as \"Roxy Music's masterpiece\" and placed at number 46 on a list of the \"Top 100 Alternative Albums.\" In a retrospective review for AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine notes that the band had embraced \"dance and unabashed pop\" at the expense of tempering their distinctive \"artier inclinations\", but nonetheless found \"Siren\" \"captivating\", noting \"a thematic consistency that works in its favor, and helps elevate its best songs... as well as the album itself into the realm of classics.\" Ira Robbins for \"Trouser Press\", on the other hand, found the album \"disappointingly dull\" and added that despite featuring \"some great tracks... an overabundance of forgettable numbers substantially diminishes its value\". Critic Simon Reynolds felt that on \"Country Life\" and \"Siren\", \"the actual fabric of Roxy's sound gets steadily more conventional and tame.\"\n\n\"Rolling Stone\" ranked \"Siren\" at number 374 on its 2012 list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, describing it as a \"delicious LP of lounge-lizard ennui\". \"Vibe\" included it in its list of the 100 essential albums of the 20th century and wrote that Bryan Ferry \"blends the esoteric murk of early Roxy, with the aching, ardently romantic tone that defines their later work\". Critic Greil Marcus included it in his appendix of \"Stranded: Rock and Roll for a Desert Island\", with the accompanying write-up: \"Don Juan Faces Life: With the band hitting the limits of the music that grew from \"Rubber Soul\", Ferry dismantled his lounge lizard act bit by bit, until all that was left was what his entire career had meant to hide: 'an average man,' but one with enough emotion to record for Motown.\"\n\nThe cover features bandmember Bryan Ferry's then-girlfriend, model Jerry Hall, on rocks near South Stack, Anglesey. Graham Hughes, working during August 1975, took the cover photo directly below the central span of the bridge on a south-side slope.

{"id": "1820975", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1820975", "title": "Music of the Channel Islands", "text": "Music of the Channel Islands\n\nThe Channel Islands are located in the English Channel, by Normandy, France. The two bailiwicks, Guernsey and Jersey, are not a part of the United Kingdom, but since the 20th century are majority English-speaking and part of the British cultural sphere. They also share a historic cultural (and musical) identity with the people of Normandy.\n\nLittle is known of the history of music in the islands. The Reformation brought Calvinism to the islands and the later strong influence of Methodism suppressed dancing and secular music. A number of traditional songs and dances have been recorded, although some gentrified dances were collected in the 19th century in Guernsey. Some traditional folk songs such as \"Jean, Gros Jean\" and \"J'ai pèrdu ma femme\" (Jèrriais)/\"J'ai perdu ma faumme\" (Dgèrnésiais) have survived. Periodic fieldwork by collectors such as Peter Kennedy (1957; 1960), Claudie Marcel-Dubois (Sark, 1970) and Martin J. Locke (Sark, 1976) revealed a number of folk songs which were mostly in French, with parallels or variants also present in the folk traditions of France and French-speaking Canada. There were a smaller number of songs in Jèrriais, Dgèrnésiais, Sèrtchiais and English. Two songs are unique to the Channel Islands and have not been collected elsewhere: La Chanson de Peirson (collected in Jersey by Edouard Gavey) and Belle, Rendez-Moi Mes Gants (from the repertoire of Jack Le Feuvre, Sark). \n\nThe traditional musical instrument most associated with the islands was the \"chifournie\". According to Edith Carey (1903), it had disappeared from Guernsey by the mid-nineteenth century. It was to disappear from Jersey by the early twentieth century (see Frank Le Maistre: \"Dictionnaire jersiais-français\", 1976). Fiddle and accordion playing persisted for somewhat longer.\n\nDances included the \"ronde\", or round dance, the cotillion, and popular nineteenth-century dances such as the waltz, schottische and polka. \"La Danse des Chapieaux\" (the hat dance) was a popular game of forfeit, while \"La Bérouaisse\" (the broom dance) was a display of agility by a solo dancer. \"La Bébée\" (\"the Baby Polka\" or \"Klatschtanz\") is a 19th-century novelty dance which also remains popular with costumed folklore groups in various parts of Europe. \n\nAn identified principle of the Jèrriais song tradition is that it is \"inherently and simultaneously eclectic and original\", being often borrowed and transformed. Current practice in Jèrriais song is a tradition re-invented through imitation, but historical examples show that adaptations of popular song have been made for hundreds of years. Song in Jèrriais celebrates the language and its survival. Songs derived from French mark geographic identity and proximity to France, while songs derived from the UK and Ireland re-present Jersey's wider heritage.\n\nThe development of tourism in the 19th century brought a demand for dance music in tea-rooms and hotels. Some local composers supplied songs and sheet music aimed at a tourist market.\n\nClaude Debussy composed part of \"La Mer\" in Jersey. John Ireland settled for a time in Guernsey.\n\nThe Channel Islands Music Council was founded in 1974 to promote music in the islands. In 2004, the Jersey Live Music Festival was first held, now scheduled annually.\n\n"}

{"id": "1821004", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1821004", "title": "Great Grimsby (UK Parliament constituency)", "text": "Great Grimsby (UK Parliament constituency)\n\nGreat Grimsby is a constituency in North East Lincolnshire represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom since December 2019 by Lia Nici of the Conservative Party.\n\nThe present constituency follows the boundaries of the old Borough of Great Grimsby, which was abolished when the former county of Humberside was divided into four unitary authorities in 1996. From the 2010 general election new boundaries took effect, but the Boundary Commission's review led only to minimal changes, aligning the constituency boundaries with present ward boundaries so the seat still has electoral wards:\n\nThe constituency has been represented since the first House of Commons was assembled in the Model Parliament of 1295, and it elected two MPs until 1832. Great Grimsby was established as a parliamentary borough in 1295, sending two burgesses, and has been continuously represented ever since. The town of Grimsby in Lincolnshire, a market town, fishing port and seaport.\n\nFreemen of the town had the right to vote, provided they were resident and paying scot and lot; in 1831 this amounted to just under 400 voters. The town corporation bestowed this status, as today, rarely on those bringing acclaim to the place, but it was routinely acquired through apprenticeship in the guilds and by inheritance; in Great Grimsby, unusually, the husband of a freeman's daughter or widow acquired the freedom.\n\nIn 1831, when the Reform Bill was being discussed in Parliament, the wives and daughters of the Great Grimsby freemen petitioned the House of Lords to retain their rights to pass on the vote to their future husbands and children. However, their concern to retain these rights may not have been rooted in any their family desiring to help choose the borough's MPs as a vote in Great Grimsby was a valuable commodity in a more mercenary sense, and the contemporary polemicist Oldfield considered that \"\"This borough stands second to none in the history of corruption.\"\" At the start of the 18th century it was noted that Grimsby's \"\"freemen did enter into treaties with several gentlemen in London, for sale of the choice of burgess to such as would give the most money\".\" In 1701, the House of Commons overturned the election of one of Great Grimsby's MPs, William Cotesworth, for bribery and sent him to the Tower of London and temporarily suspended the borough's right to representation. Almost every election in Great Grimsby at this period was followed by a petition from defeated candidates alleging bribery, although that of 1701 seems to have been the only one which was acted upon.\n\nGreat Grimsby, like most boroughs except for the very largest, recognised a \"patron\" who could generally exercise influence over the choice of its MPs; at the time of the Great Reform Act of 1832, this was Lord Yarborough. However, the extent of the patron's power was limited in Great Grimsby, and the voters were quite prepared (at a price) to defy his advice. The patron could strengthen his position by providing employment to the freemen, as could his rivals. Jupp quotes two letters, one of 1818 and one of 1819, in which local agents advise the Tennyson family how best to do this in Grimsby so as to encroach on Lord Yarborough's influence:\nOn a less extravagant level, it is recorded that after Charles Tennyson was first elected in 1818 he presented a bottle of wine to each of the fathers of 92 local children about to be christened.\n\nThe General Election of 1831 in Grimsby was as notorious as in some of the rotten boroughs, the local Tories being accused of using a revenue cutter lying in the Humber to ply the Whig voters with drink and prevent them getting to the polls; the fact of the outcome standing led to a nationally well-known action by John Shelley for libel.\n\nIn 1831, the population of the borough was 4,008, and contained 784 houses. The Boundary Act in concert with the Reform Act enlarged the borough to include eight neighbouring parishes, brought the population up to 6,413 with 1,365 houses but the landed property aspect to the franchise was not reformed so this increased the electorate only to 656 so Great Grimsby lost one of its two seats. However, Grimsby's population and housing continued to grow and, unlike most of the boroughs that lost one seat in 1832 it has retained its existence, without taking up large swathes of the county.\n\nThe constituency underwent further significant boundary change in 1918 and 1950. In 1918, parishes that had joined, (Bradley, Great Coates, Little Coates, Laceby, Waltham, Weelsby and the adjoining neighbourhood/parish of Scartho) were detached to join Louth county constituency, and the seat consisted of the county borough of Grimsby and the urban district (later borough) of Cleethorpes. In 1950, Cleethorpes was moved into the Louth county division, leaving the borough once more Grimsby alone. More recent boundary changes have only been adjustments to conform to changes at local government level.\n\nLabour's Austin Mitchell retained the seat in 1977 by only 520 votes in a by-election following the death of the Foreign Secretary Tony Crosland. He held the seat until retiring in 2015. At the 2010 election, Mitchell's majority was again reduced to three figures after a swing of over 10% to the Conservatives.\n\nAt the 2015 election, Great Grimsby was considered a target for the United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP). UKIP had selected as their candidate the 2010 Conservative candidate, Victoria Ayling, who had switched parties since the previous election. Labour's candidate was Melanie Onn, while the Conservatives stood Marc Jones. In the event however, Onn was successful, increasing Mitchell's majority of 714 more than sixfold and enjoying a swing of 5.6% from the Conservatives, with UKIP finishing third, just 57 votes behind the Conservatives. The Conservative and UKIP votes combined outnumbered the Labour vote, which was an indication that the Labour position was potentially precarious.\n\nSimilarly to many other traditionally working class labour strongholds in the North, in 2019, Great Grimsby was won by the Conservatives for the first time since 1935.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1821015", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1821015", "title": "Raseborg Castle", "text": "Raseborg Castle\n\nThe Raseborg Castle (Finnish: \"Raaseporin linna\", Swedish: \"Raseborgs slott\"), is a medieval castle in Raseborg, Finland. \n\nIt has been suggested that the castle was founded by Hermann of Dorpat, the successor of Albert of Riga, and Livonian Brothers of the Sword after Livonian Crusade. They would have named the castle Ratzeburg after Bishopric of Ratzeburg.The castle is also suggested to be founded by Bo Jonsson Grip and it is thought that the castle's first phase was completed sometime between 1373 and 1378. \n\nThe first written data about the castle is from 1378. Its main purpose was to protect Sweden's interests in southern Finland against the Hanseatic city of Tallinn. The castle was originally built on a small island in the north end of a sea bay. The historians think that the castle was built in 3 different stages over time from the 14th to the 16th century.\n\nThe layout of the castle resembles a capital 'D', with a round, thick-walled donjon on one corner and the straight part of the D forming the keep, and an inner bailey in center. The castle has had outer walls forming two outer baileys. The outer wall has had one square tower and a barbican.\n\nThe ruins of the outer wall of the castle do still exist. According to the historians the outer wall was built to protect the foundations of the castle itself. When the use of the artillery got more common, it was vital to protect the basic walls of the castle. There was also one more protection outside the castle. That was a wooden barrier, which surrounded the castle and it prevented any foreign ships to approach the castle harbour. There still exists some small parts of that barrier. The barriers are today on the mainland, but in the 15th century they were located on a peninsula by the sea. The sea level became lower over time due to postglacial rebound, and it became increasingly difficult to approach the castle by boat. This is one of the main reasons why the castle lost its importance. \n\nBattles were fought between Swedish and Danish forces and even pirates over control of the castle in the Middle Ages. The castle was abandoned in 1553, three years after Helsinki was founded in 1550 and Helsinki became strategically more important. Restoration work began in the 1890s and in these days the castle ruins are open to the public. \n\nClose to the castle ruins is one of the largest open-air theatre stages in Finland, the Raseborg Summer Theatre. The theatre was founded in 1966, and gives numerous performances in Swedish every year in July, often with a connection to the castle history.\n\n"}

Her paternal grandfather was the founder of the Tokugawa shogunate, Tokugawa Ieyasu; her maternal grandfather was Azai Nagamasa; her grandmother was Oichi, whose brother was Oda Nobunaga. When she was six or seven, her grandfather married her off to Toyotomi Hideyori, who was the son of Toyotomi Hideyoshi.\n\nIn 1603, when Senhime was seven years old, she married the successor to the Toyotomi clan, Toyotomi Hideyori and lived with him in Osaka Castle along with his mother, Lady Yodo, who was a sister of Oeyo, Senhime's mother and accompanied by her wet-nurse, . Little is known about their life together, and her grandfather Ieyasu, besieged the castle in 1615, when she was nineteen. When Osaka castle fell, Hideyori was required to commit ritual suicide as was his mother and his child by Senhime, Toyotomi Kunimatsu—at that time 7 years old. Senhime was luckier and was rescued from the castle before it fell. Senhime also saved Hideyori's daughter with another woman, (1609–1645) who later became her adopted daughter.\n\nIn 1616, Ieyasu remarried Senhime to Honda Tadatoki, a grandson of Honda Tadakatsu, and in few years she moved to Himeji. Honda Tadatoki's mother, Kumahime, was the daughter of Matsudaira Nobuyasu and hence the granddaughter of Ieyasu.\n\nA famous legend tells that a certain Sakazaki Naomori planned to capture Senhime just before her remarriage, wishing to marry her himself. However his plan was revealed and Naomori was either killed or forced to commit suicide. It was long believed that Naomori was the one who saved Senhime out from the Osaka Castle, believing the words of Tokugawa Ieyasu that he would give Senhime to whoever rescued her, though recently this has been doubted. Stories tell that Senhime refused to marry Naomori, whose face was ill-favored because of the burn he got when he saved her, and rather preferred handsome Tadatoki.\n\nSenhime and Tadatoki had an amicable marriage and had two children together: a daughter, , and a son, . However tragedy struck when her son died at the age of three, and five years later in 1626, her husband died of tuberculosis. His mother, Oeyo (then known as Sūgen'in) died in the same year. As was the tradition for a widow at that time, Senhime cut her hair short and became a Buddhist nun, taking the name , moved back to Edo and spent the rest of her life there. After Ietsuna's adoptive mother, Oman no Kata (known as ) died, Tenjuin become Ietsuna's adoptive mother.\n\n\nThe dramatic life of Senhime produced many legends. Some legends talk about her tenderness, such as how she saved a daughter between her husband Hideyori and another wife of him at the Siege of Osaka. Some other tell her lecherousness during her later days at Edo. Today, Senhime figures prominently in \"jidaigeki\" and \"taiga dorama\" (period dramas) in Japan.\n\nSenhime is also a beloved figure in Himeji. Shortly after her marriage to Honda Tadatoki, they moved to Himeji Castle, a present-day world heritage site whose west wing was mostly constructed at that time. Most of the west wing is lost now, but a tower called \"keshō yagura\" (Dressing Tower) remains, where it is believed that she actually groomed herself.\n\nSenhime appeared in the concluding storyline of the semi-fictional video game \"Kessen\". In the final cutscene she laments to Ieyasu about the tragedy of war and the death of Hideyori, Ieyasu comforts her and replies that the people of Japan will once again live in peace and praises Hideyori for his duty as a samurai by committing seppuku.\n\nSenhime also appeared in a 1962 movie \"Senhime to Hideyori\", starring Hibari Misora as Senhime. The film begins from the siege and fall of Osaka castle and tells the fictionalized story of Senhime's later years after the death of Hideyori till her final confinement to the Buddhist temple. A more historical film about Senhime and the siege of Osaka Castle appeared in the mid-1950s entitled \"Princess Senhime\", with Machiko Kyō in the title role.\n\nSenhime appears in the 1955 historical novel \"Yodo-dono nikki\" by Yasushi Inoue.\n"}

It was first published in 2000 by the Aladdin division of Simon & Schuster, Inc. The novel switches between 2002 and 2085 by chapter.\n\nIn the year 2000, 100-year-old Amelia Hazelwood was living in a nursing home, sick and tired of life. Content to die, she signs a document given to her by doctors at the nursing home with very little awareness as to what it is. However, she gradually begins to change soon afterward, beginning with the realization that she no longer needs her hearing aid and is able to swing her legs over the side of her bed again.\n\nShe quickly learns that she and several other nursing home residents had signed an agreement with Dr. Jimson and Dr. Reed to participate in a study for an experimental drug (PT-1) that reverses the effect of aging by making telomeres grow. All the residents at the nursing home had been given the drug and are now growing younger each day. However, because the drug is experimental, it must be kept a secret. While a second chance at life seems wonderful, when Amelia's first birthday while moving back in time arrives, she finds she cannot remember anything from the last year of her life when she was growing older. The residents realize that as they grow younger, their previous memories are disappearing and being rewritten with new memories from growing younger, even though the brain has plenty of chromosomes left for memory. It's then found out that it's like recording while hitting the rewind button. One man, afraid of forgetting his beloved wife's funeral where so many people said such nice things, is the first to request the Cure, a secondary drug that will halt his age at that exact moment. While the Cure works successfully on lab mice, the man immediately shrivels up, dies, and turns into dust when it is administered to him.\n\nWhile the doctors continue to secretly find a way to make the Cure work on humans with little success, Amelia and a friend, Anny Beth, decide to leave the nursing home and live their lives together and experience the world as they grow younger and younger. They find themselves constantly on the move, as with each year, their un-aging bodies prevent them from keeping the drug a secret. By the time Amelia, now called Melly, is sixteen and Anny Beth is eighteen, they become increasingly anxious that they will soon be unable to live on their own and become infants. With the doctors now deceased and their descendants still trying to make the Cure work, Melly and Anny Beth must find someone they can trust with their story and will take care of them when the time comes. Even more distressing is when Melly and Anny Beth realize someone they do not know named A.J. Hazelwood is trying to locate them for information they don't want to disclose.\n\nAs Melly and Anny Beth try to stay one-step ahead of the mysterious A.J. Hazelwood, they are surprised to learn that she is a descendant of both of them and had been researching her family history. The two decide to take a chance and reveal the truth regarding their identities to A.J., who eventually believes them and agrees to accept responsibility for their well-being as they unage into childhood again.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1821048", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1821048", "title": "Do You Believe in Shame?", "text": "Do You Believe in Shame?\n\n\"Do You Believe In Shame?\" is a song by Duran Duran. Released on 10 April 1989, it was the third and final single from the \"Big Thing\" album.\n\nThe song was dedicated to three of the band's dead friends: record producer Alex Sadkin, artist Andy Warhol and Simon Le Bon's childhood friend David Miles. Le Bon has since said that \"Shame\" is the first part of a trilogy of songs written as a tribute to Miles, the other songs being \"Ordinary World\" and \"Out of My Mind\".\n\nThere was a successful legal challenge over the close resemblance of the melody of \"Do You Believe In Shame?\" to that of the Dale Hawkins classic \"Suzie Q\" (more famously covered by Creedence Clearwater Revival and The Rolling Stones). The writing credits were changed accordingly. The members of Duran Duran have always denied that they intentionally copied any other works, and that the similarity of the two songs was based on what they described as a \"basic blues progression\".\n\n\"Do You Believe In Shame?\" was released to coincide with the band's Electric Theatre Tour which began in Newcastle on 15 April 1989. As such, the 7\" triple pack issued by EMI in the UK included tour dates in the artwork.\n\nThe song's first week of release was complicated because the original CD single was discovered to have an overlong playing time that disqualified it from some of the sales charts. The CD single was recalled two days after its release, and reissued a few days later, but for several days during the song's initial promotion, the CD was unavailable in shops.\n\nThe lyrical video for \"Do You Believe In Shame?\" was filmed by the Chinese director Chen Kaige, who later directed acclaimed films such as \"Farewell My Concubine\". It was set in New York City, and shows the three original members of Duran Duran in separate storylines. Nick Rhodes appears to be mourning a friend at church by attending a funeral for him/her. In the next scene, he attends an auction and bids on a snow globe which he later throws in the bin along with other mementos as part of the music video's climax. This is most probably an allusion to Andy Warhol who managed to sell his possessions after they were auctioned off after his death. John Taylor appears to be searching for faith and connection where he attends a Catholic church like Nick Rhodes does in the first scene of the music video. In the next scene of the music video, he attends a birthday party for a little girl who has a severely injured leg. While singing, Simon LeBon seems to be watching the world around him, observing people on the streets, including a little girl who drops her crutches in order to hop up a flight of stairs and a blind man who confidently crosses the street in front of oncoming traffic which takes place in the rising action of the music video.\n\nThe Roosevelt Island Tramway appears halfway through the video when the camera pans away from Simon LeBon's worldly observations.\n\nAt the end of the music video, a long line of dominoes can be seen falling in succession by forming a question mark which is akin to the single's sleeve where all of the members of Duran Duran are seen in a little room located in an apartment building of the music video.\n\nIn lieu of a remix of the single track, EMI issued bonus material across a number of formats - triple 7\" pack, 3\" CD and limited edition numbered 10\" single.\n\n\"Official Bootleg: The LSD Edit\", a previously promo-only edit of \"Big Thing\" album tracks \"The Edge Of America\" and \"Lake Shore Driving\" finally had its commercial debut, \"LSD\" presumably an acronym for \"Lake Shore Driving\". The song was renamed \"The Krush Brothers LSD Edit\" for release on the \"Do You Believe In Shame?\" single.\n\nThe original Daniel Abraham mix of \"Drug (It's Just A State Of Mind)\" also appeared on this single. John Taylor believed in this mix of \"Drug\" so vehemently, he has since said he almost left the band over the mishandling of the track.\n\nOther items include an edit of \"Big Thing\" album track \"Palomino\" and a live version of \"Notorious\", recorded in Rotterdam, which was previously from the promo-only 12\" EP \"Duran Goes Dutch\".\n\nAlso included in the pack were two spoken word pieces by Le Bon, \"God (London)\" and \"This Is How A Road Gets Made\", recorded and produced by John Jones. They were used during the tour as intros to the band coming on stage. Le Bon swears in \"God (London)\" and hence it was released in two versions, censored and non-censored.\n\nEMI. / DDA 12 (Simon Le Bon picture sleeve)\n\nEMI. / DDB 12 (Nick Rhodes picture sleeve)\n\n\nEMI. / DDC 12 (John Taylor picture sleeve)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAllison Iraheta and her band Halo Circus recorded a cover version for the 2014 compilation album \"Making Patterns Rhyme: A Tribute to Duran Duran\".\n\nDespite the collectibility of this release, it reached no higher in the charts than #30 in the UK and #72 in the US. It also reached #14 in Italy.\n\nApart from the single, \"Do You Believe in Shame?\" has also appeared on:\n\nAlbums:\n\n\nwith:\n\nAlso credited:\n\n"}

{"id": "1821058", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1821058", "title": "Claudio Pari", "text": "Claudio Pari\n\nClaudio Pari (1574 – after 1619) was an Italian composer, of Burgundian birth, of the late Renaissance and early Baroque eras. He was a competent madrigalist, well regarded by his peers, as well as a late representative of the musical style/ethos known as \"musica reservata\".\n\nAs has been recently established, he was born in Salines (Salins-les-Bains), Burgundy. While little is known about his early life, he probably came to Italy or Sicily early in his life. He was at the monastery of S. Domingo in Palermo in 1598, where he fell afoul of the Inquisition; at an auto-da-fé there he was sentenced to row in the galleys for five years, on a charge of heresy. By 1611 at the latest he was back in Palermo, since he published a book of madrigals there.\n\nWhatever his history as a heretic may have been, he must have been forgiven, for he was appointed to be music director at a Jesuit institution at Salemi (in western Sicily) in 1615. His final publication—his fourth book of madrigals—was in 1619 and nothing further is known about his life.\n\nMuch of Pari's music is in the manneristic style which was characteristic of the transformation of Renaissance into Baroque, and in addition conforms closely to the idea of \"musica reservata\": music of intense expressiveness, careful text setting, and elaborate contrapuntal techniques, most likely intended for an audience of connoisseurs. In this regard it resembles that of some of his contemporaries, including the madrigalists Gesualdo, Sigismondo d'India, Pomponio Nenna, and Giovanni de Macque, although Pari avoids the extreme chromaticism used by Gesualdo and never attained his fame.\n\nPari's only surviving music are three books of madrigals, all published in Palermo between 1611 and 1619. Three other books of madrigals written prior to 1611 are lost. The collection published in 1611 includes a setting of Guarini's famous \"Il pastor fido\", and the 1619 collection is subtitled \"Lamento d'Arianna\"; it is clearly influenced by the famous composition by Monteverdi. In the \"Lamento d'Arianna\" collection, Pari derived most of the motivic material directly from Monteverdi, but worked it into a dense, archaic contrapuntal texture more akin to Gombert, who had died sixty years earlier, than to the currently popular style of monody.\n\nThe connection with Gombert may not have been coincidental. Gombert also spent time in the galleys, only being pardoned, according to one story, after the publication of a set of Magnificats dedicated to Emperor Charles V. It is possible that Pari not only knew Gombert's music but looked to his experience as inspiration to survive his own hard years of slavery; and the music akin to the dense contrapuntal style of Gombert was all composed after the end of Pari's sentence.\n\nAlthough Pari had a liking for the dense counterpoint of the middle of the 16th century, he experimented with piquant dissonances, and also with the concertato style, features which were quite contemporary; he also varied the texture widely within individual pieces as a way to highlight the dramatic contents of the text.\n\n\n"}

He won two NFL championships with the Lions (1953 and 1957), and, between 1954 and 1963, he played in ten consecutive Pro Bowl games and was selected each year as a first-team All-Pro player. He was also voted by his fellow NFL players as the NFL's most valuable defensive player in 1960 and 1963, named to the NFL 1950s All-Decade Team, and inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1973.\n\nFrom 1967 to 1972, Schmidt was the head coach of the Detroit Lions. In six years under Schmidt, the Lions compiled a 43–34–7 record and finished in second place each year from 1969 to 1972. After retiring from the Lions, Schmidt worked as a manufacturer's representative in the automobile industry in Detroit.\n\nA native of Pittsburgh, he played college football for the University of Pittsburgh Panthers team from 1950 to 1952. He was selected by the International News Service as a first-team All-American in 1952 and was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 2000.\n\nSchmidt was born in Pittsburgh in 1932 and grew up in the borough of Brentwood. Schmidt was the youngest of four brothers. Two of his brothers died while Schmidt was still a boy, one after falling from a tree and the other while serving in the military in June 1944. His father died in February 1945. Another brother played football at Carnegie Tech and recruited Joe to play semipro football at age 14. He later enrolled at Brentwood High School and played football.\n\nSchmidt attended the University of Pittsburgh, playing on the school's football team for three years, from 1950 to 1952. During his first two years as a Pittsburgh football player, the team compiled losing records of 1–8 in 1950 and 3–7 in 1951.\n\nAs a senior, Schmidt was the captain of the 1952 Pittsburgh team that compiled a 6–3 record, including victories over Ohio State, Notre Dame, and Army. Prior to the Notre Dame game, Schmidt gave a speech that was credited with motivating the team to defeat the heavily favored Notre Dame team. In the Notre Dame game, Schmidt sustained a concussion and hemorrhage that required him to be hospitalized for ten days.\n\nAt the end of the 1952 season, Schmidt was selected as a first-team All-American by the International News Service. He was also selected to play in the Senior Bowl.\n\nSchmidt was drafted by the Detroit Lions in the seventh round (85th overall pick) of the 1953 NFL Draft. He joined a team that had won the 1952 NFL Championship and led the NFL in scoring defense. The Lions and Schmidt both had doubts as to whether a seventh round pick would be able to make the lineup of the best defense in the NFL. However, Schmidt impressed in the pre-season and was included in the regular season roster. In the first game of the 1953 season, he helped the Lions to a 38–21 win over the Pittsburgh Steelers; the \"Detroit Free Press\" wrote that Schmidt was \"making tackles all over the field\" and was a key in holding the Steelers to 96 rushing yards. Schmidt appeared in all 12 regular season games, intercepted two passes, and helped the Lions to the 1953 NFL Championship with the league's second best scoring defense.\n\nSchmidt again appeared in all 12 regular season games for the 1954 Detroit Lions team that compiled a 9–2–1 record and won the NFC Western Division but lost to the Browns in the 1954 NFL Championship Game despite Schmidt's interception of an Otto Graham pass. At the end of the 1954 season, Schmidt was selected by the Associated Press (AP) as a first-team All-Pro player and by the United Press (UP) as a second-team All-Pro. He was also invited to play in the Pro Bowl, the first of ten consecutive Pro Bowls in Schmidt's career.\n\nIn 1955, following an injury to Bobby Layne and the retirement of Les Bingaman, the Lions dropped to 3–9, and the team fell to ninth of 12 NFL teams in scoring defense, but Schmidt continued to impress. He appeared in all 12 games for the Lions, tied an NFL record with eight fumble recoveries, and won the Lions' President's Trophy as the team's most valuable player. He was selected by both the AP and the Newspaper Enterprise Association (NEA) as a first-team All-Pro and by the UP as a second-team All-Pro.\n\nIn August 1956, Schmidt was elected as the team captain, a designation he would hold for the next nine years. When the NFL Players Association was formed in 1956, Schmidt was chosen by his teammates as their first player representative. He was also the signal caller for the defense and quickly developed a reputation as being \"without peer\" at the task. The 1956 Lions improved to 9–3, finishing in second place in the West Division with the third best scoring defense in the NFL. At the end of the 1956 season, Schmidt was selected as a first-team All-Pro by the AP, UP, NEA, and \"The Sporting News\" (TSN).\n\nSchmidt had perhaps his best season in 1957. As team captain, he appeared in every game and led the 1957 Lions to their third NFL championship in six years. Schmidt intercepted two passes in the post-season and led the Lions to a 59–14 victory over the Browns in the 1957 NFL Championship Game. For the second time in his career, Schmidt was selected as the Lions' most valuable player. He was involved in half of the Lions' tackles, including 80 initial tackles and 77 assists in 12 games, was selected as a first-team All-Pro by the AP, UPI, NEA and \"The Sporting News\", and was named the NFL Lineman of the Year in an AP poll of NFL writers.\n\nAfter serving six months in the United States Army after the 1957 season, Schmidt held out prior to the start of the 1958 season, seeking a 50% salary increase to $18,000. He ultimately signed a one-year contract in late July. After winning the NFL championship in 1957, the 1958 Lions fell to 4–7–1 with a scoring defense ranked seventh of 12 teams in the NFL. Despite the team's decline, Schmidt intercepted a career-high six passes in 1958. He was also selected as the Lions' most valuable player for the third time, played in the Pro Bowl, and was selected by the AP, UPI, NEA, and \"The Sporting News\" as a first-team All-Pro player.\n\nThe Lions struggles continued in 1959 with a 3–8–1 record and a scoring defense ranked eighth in the league. After the 1959 season, Schmidt once again played in the Pro Bowl and was selected by the AP, UPI, NEA, and \"The Sporting News\" as a first-team All-Pro player.\n\nDuring an exhibition game on September 11, 1960, Schmidt suffered a dislocated right shoulder that caused him to miss the first two games of the regular season. Prior to the injury, Schmidt had played in every game for the Lions for seven consecutive years from 1953 to 1959. He returned to the lineup wearing a restraining harness to protect his shoulder. On October 16, in his first game back from the injury, he intercepted a pass and returned it 17 yards for the first touchdown of his NFL career. The Lions lost the first two games of the season, but went 7–3 after Schmidt returned. After the 1960 season, he played in the Pro Bowl and was selected as a first-team All-Pro by the NEA and \"Sporting News\". He was also voted by the NFL players as the league's most valuable defensive player.\n\nDuring the 1961 and 1962 seasons, Schmidt appeared in all 28 regular season games for the Lions, as the team improved to 8–5–1 and 11–3, finishing in second place in the NFL Western Division both years. For the fourth time in his career, Schmidt was selected as the Lions' most valuable player in 1961. He played both years in the Pro Bowl and won first-team All-Pro honors in 1961 from the AP, UPI, NEA, and TSN, and in 1962 from the AP, UPI, and NEA.\n\nIn April 1963, Schmidt and five other Lions were implicated in a gambling investigation by NFL commissioner Pete Rozelle. Schmidt had placed a $50 bet on the Packers to defeat the Giants in the 1962 NFL Championship Game. Detroit teammate Alex Karras was given an indefinite suspension for his role in the betting; Schmidt and four other Lions were fined $2,000 each.\n\nIn 1963, Schmidt missed four games with another dislocated shoulder, but still appeared in 10 games and was selected as a first-team All-Pro by the NEA. After the season ended, he played in his tenth consecutive Pro Bowl and was selected for the tenth consecutive year as an All-Pro, receiving first-team honors from the NEA. The NFL players also selected Schmidt as the NFL's most valuable player on defense. Schmidt was paid $22,000 in 1963, making him the club's highest paid defensive player up to that time.\n\nIn 1964, Schmidt was limited to nine games. His season ended on November 9 when he sustained yet another dislocated shoulder in a loss to the Packers. After sustaining the injury, Schmidt announced that he intended to retire as a player. However, he quickly rescinded his resignation and stated his intent to attempt a comeback in 1965.\n\nIn 1965, Schmidt's last as a player, he appeared in all 14 games for the Lions and intercepted four passes, the second highest total of his career. In March 1966, Schmidt announced his retirement as a player. During his 13-year NFL career, Schmidt appeared in 155 games, intercepted 24 passes, and recovered 17 fumbles.\n\nSimultaneously with his retirement as a player, Schmidt was hired as an assistant coach for the 1966 Lions. During the 1966 season, he tutored linebackers Mike Lucci, who became the Lions' most valuable defensive player for three consecutive years, and Wally Hilgenberg, who later played 12 seasons for the Minnesota Vikings. The Lions compiled a 4–9–1 record in 1966.\n\nOn January 6, 1967, shortly after the end of the 1966 season, Lions fired head coach Harry Gilmer and signed Schmidt, at age 35, to a five-year, $40,000-a-year contract as Gilmer's replacement. In his first year as head coach, the Lions ended with a 5–7–2 record.\n\nIn May 1968, the Lions traded with the Los Angeles Rams for quarterback Bill Munson. During the 1968 season, the Lions compiled a 4–8–2 record. On October 21, 1968, Schmidt was booed by Detroit fans when, after the Lions recovered a fumble at their own 20-yard line with the score tied and 27 seconds left, Schmidt ran out the clock with four running plays instead of going for the win.\n\nDespite the Lions' poor record on the field during Schmidt's first two years as head coach, these rebuilding years. The \"Detroit Free Press\" wrote that Schmidt took over a team that was reportedly \"at the depths\" and was \"charged with rebuilding from the bottom.\" The Lions rebuilding efforts during the 1967 and 1968 seasons included remarkable success in the NFL Draft, including the selection of two Pro Football Hall of Fame inductees and three NFL Rookie of the Year Award winners. The Lions picks during the 1967 and 1968 seasons included the following:\n\n\nIn 1969, the Lions opened the season 3–3 but picked up momentum from there, compiling a 6–1–1 record in their final eight games and finishing in second place behind the Vikings. Lem Barney intercepted eight passes, and the defense ranked second in the NFL in scoring defense at 13.4 points per game. Barney received first-team 1969 All-Pro honors, and four Lions (Charlie Sanders, Ed Flanagan, Alex Karras, and Mike Lucci) received second-team honors. On December 14, 1969, just hours after the team upset the Rams, 28–0, Schmidt was arrested at 3 a.m. for driving while intoxicated after allegedly running a red light at 75 miles per hour on Telegraph Road in Southfield, Michigan. Schmidt pleaded guilty to driving while impaired and was fined $150.\n\nSchmidt's best season as the Lions coach was 1970 when the Lions finished 10–4 to make the playoffs for the first time in 13 years. Whereas the 1969 team had been strong defensively and weak on offense, the 1970 team ranked second in the NFL in both scoring defense (14.4 points per game) and scoring offense (24.8 points per game). The most heartbreaking loss came on November 8, when Tom Dempsey of the New Orleans Saints broke an NFL record with a 63-yard field goal to beat the Lions, 19–17, as time expired. On December 14, the Lions defeated the Rams, 28–23, on \"Monday Night Football\" in Los Angeles. Bill Munson and Greg Landry shared the quarterback duties for the 1970 Lions, Munson starting eight games and Landry six. The playoff run lasted only one game, however, as the Dallas Cowboys won a defensive battle, 5–0, on December 26. Charlie Sanders received first-team 1970 All-Pro honors, and five Lions (Mel Farr, Ed Flanagan, Paul Naumoff, Lem Barney, and Dick LeBeau) received second-team honors.\n\nIn July 1971, with one year still remaining on his five-year contract, Schmidt signed a new, three-year contract to serve as the Lions' head coach through the 1973 season at an increased salary estimated at $60,000 per year. The new contract was seen as an endorsement by owner William Clay Ford of Schmidt's rebuilding efforts, leading the team to a 19–8–1 record in the previous two seasons.\n\nThe 1971 Lions began the season with high expectations and won four of the first five games. The season took a dramatic downward turn in the sixth game of the season against the Chicago Bears on October 24, 1971. In the final two minutes of the game, Lions wide receiver Chuck Hughes caught a 32-yard pass as the Lions attempted to rally from a five-point deficit. On the next play, Hughes collapsed on the field clutching his chest as he fell. He was given chest compressions by the team doctor and taken to the hospital where he was pronounced dead within an hour. From that game forward, the Lions won only three of the remaining games, lost the final three games, and ended with a disappointing 7–6–1 record.\n\nIn 1972, the team improved to 8–5–1 and finished in second place. However, with one game left, team owner William Clay Ford publicly announced his dissatisfaction with the results he had received from the coaching staff and stated that there would be a shakeup of the coaching staff when the season ended. Following Ford's criticism, the Lions smashed the Rams, 34–17, in the final game of the season. After the game, Schmidt told the press: \"As far as our season is concerned, it was a very disappointing one. ... At least we improved from last year's 7–6–1 record. The abuse that has been heaped upon us in Detroit is part of the game.\"\n\nSchmidt resigned as the Lions' head coach on January 12, 1973. At a press conference announcing his decision, Schmidt said, \"I really don't enjoy coaching anymore. It got to be a burden more than a fun-loving game. I promised my family and myself when I started coaching that I would get out when it stopped being fun. Unfortunately, it's reached that point.\" In six years under Schmidt, the Lions compiled a 43–34–7 record and finished in second place each year from 1969 to 1972.\n\nSchmidt was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1973 and the College Football Hall of Fame in 2000. He was credited with revolutionizing the linebacker position with his speed, doing the job formerly performed by middle guards in stopping the run game while also taking the load off the defensive backs on pass defense. Some have credited him with \"virtually invent[ing] the middle linebacker position.\" His biography at the Hall of Fame credits him with a big role in changing defensive play in the NFL:\n\nWithout question, he was the first to play the [middle linebacker] position with such finesse that even the masses in the stands could see the growing value of the 'defensive quarterback.' He anticipated plays with uncanny accuracy. He was a deadly tackler. He was fast enough to evade a 250-pound guard, to follow a play along the line or to drop back to cover a pass. He was strong enough to power past a potential blocker to crumble a play. But his greatest talent may well have been his uncanny knack of knowing what the opposition was going to do.\n\nDetroit coach Buddy Parker called Schmidt \"one of the surest and hardest tacklers you'll ever see.\" Even Schmidt's adversaries acknowledged his exceptional talent. Rams' quarterback Norm Van Brocklin said of Schmidt, \"If I were to start a team from scratch and pick out just one player, I'd select Joe Schmidt to form the core of my team.\" Despite playing in the same era as Hall of Fame linebackers Ray Nitschke, Sam Huff, and Bill George, Green Bay's Paul Hornung called Schmidt \"the best linebacker in the league.\" Vince Lombardi said of Schmidt, \"He's a cat.\" John Henry Johnson of San Francisco's \"Million Dollar Backfield\" complained, \"He's always in the way.\"\n\nIn addition to the Pro and College Football Halls of Fame, Schmidt also received numerous other honors, including the following:\n\n\nSchmidt and his wife, Marilyn, had five children, including son Billy (born 1961) and daughter Kerry (born 1962). After retiring from the Lions, Schmidt formed Joe Schmidt Enterprises, a manufacturer's representative working with the automobile industry in Detroit.\n\n"}

Throughout the history of Hong Kong, it has been the only regular British army unit raised in the territory made up almost entirely of Locally Enlisted Personnel (LEP).\n\nThe history of Hong Kong ethnic Chinese soldiers serving in the British Army can be traced back to the 1880s when Hong Kong locals were employed by the Royal Engineers in the building of barracks and defence works.\n\nMany ethnic Chinese from Hong Kong fought alongside the British troops in the defence of Hong Kong in World War II. The British Battle Group consisted of 1st Battalion Middlesex Regiment, 2nd Battalion Royal Scots and the Hong Kong Chinese Regiment. Other Battle Groups were Royal Artillery, Canadian Battalions, Indian Forces and the Hong Kong Volunteer Defence Force. A large number of ethnic Hong Kong Chinese were killed or became prisoners of war.\n\nEthnic Hong Kong Chinese also saw active service outside Hong Kong in Burma in 1942 against the Japanese forces, where they fought alongside the 1st Battalion Gloucestershire Regiment.\n\nIn January 1948 the Hong Kong Chinese Training Unit (HKCTU) was formed by the Hong Kong ethnic Chinese who had served in the various artillery and coastal defence units during the Battle of Hong Kong in World War II, with the aim of recruiting and training Hong Kong ethnic Chinese soldiers to assist and support the British Garrison in Hong Kong. Hong Kong-born ethnic Chinese soldiers (British Dependent Territories Citizens) of the HKCTU pledged allegiance to the Monarch of the United Kingdom and were enlisted into the General Service Corps (GSC) of the British Regular Army and they wore the GSC capbadge. Members of the HKCTU were later frequently nicknamed, locally, in Cantonese Chinese, as \"sui lui pao bing\" () or \"sui ngau\" () in memory of their predecessors. Those enlisted before World War II were numbered HK1802xxx; those who joined after World War II, HK1826XXXX and HK1827xxxx.\n\nIn 1962 the HKCTU became the Hong Kong Military Service Corps (HKMSC) and consequently the GSC capbadge was replaced by a Dragon emblem. Initially the Dragon insignia, which was a Division Sign, had represented the Hong Kong Garrison and all British army soldiers serving in Hong Kong wore a Dragon cloth-badge on their uniform. The Dragon logo was officially adopted by the HKMSC as their Corps Badge and Corps Flag. The HKMSC became a part of the General Service Corps of the Ministry of Defence (MoD) of the United Kingdom.\n\nThe HKMSC offered locally recruited and trained Hong Kong Chinese soldiers the opportunity to pursue a full career in the British Regular Army up to and including Queen's Commissioned Officer rank in the General List (HKMSC). As all members of the HKMSC were British Regular Army soldiers, they received a Regular Army Service Record Book when they left the army. Many of them were also awarded the Long Service and Good Conduct Medal (LS&GC) after 15 years of good and loyal service. British gallantry awards, membership of orders of chivalry, decorations and medals were also presented /granted to some HKMSC soldiers; these include the Queen's Gallantry Medal (QGM), the British Empire Medal (BEM), Member of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (MBE) status and Officer of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (OBE) status.\n\nHKMSC soldiers paid United Kingdom income tax (at a 'Hong Kong' rate), via the MoD, like their British counterparts.\n\nThe unit's Headquarters and Training Depot were originally located in Lyemun Barracks in 1948, between Shau Kei Wan and Chai Wan. It then moved to the Stonecutters Island in 1985. The HQ and Depot was commanded by a British Lieutenant Colonel, as Commandant, with a British Depot Adjutant and a Hong Kong Chinese Corps Adjutant (both Majors), a British Depot Regimental Sergeant Major (RSM) and a Hong Kong Chinese Corps RSM (both WO1s) and a British Regimental Quartermaster Sergeant (RQMS) and Superintendent Clerk (ORQMS), (both WO2s). Recruitment, selection and training was carried out by Training Company, commanded by a British Army Major, adopting the British Regular Army Recruit Training Syllabus. The HKMSC recruit training instructors were all initially trained in Hong Kong by the KHMSC, then in the UK. Training Company were also responsible for training the Ammunition Sub-Depot guards, made up of Hong Kong Sikhs (recruited as their religion barred them from smoking). The Deputy Commander British Forces (a Brigadier), was the Brigadier HKMSC (a largely honorary title).\n\nThe Hong Kong Military Service Corps maintained its reputation for loyalty and military skills at the highest level, often outshining British and Gurkha troops based in Hong Kong. The HKMSC Shooting Team won the Team and Individual champion pistol shot a number of times at RASAAM (the Regular Army Skill at Arms Meeting) at Bisley, in the UK, and in 1992 a Training Company team representing the HQ and Depot HKMSC won the Dragon Cup for military skills (outperforming the Queen's Gurkha Signals in signalling and the British Military Hospital team in first aid); the competition was not held again.\n\nThe HKMSC reached a peak strength of 1,200 men, providing the British garrison in Hong Kong with support personnel. All HKMSC soldiers did their basic training in Hong Kong and afterwards from time to time attended upgrading and trade courses in the United Kingdom. HKMSC soldiers who were posted to and served with other non-HKMSC units wore the other units' cap badges. Unit personnel were enlisted as light-infantry, Regimental Police, interpreters and clerks in Dragon Company of the General Service Corps (GSC) headquartered in Osborn Barracks, Kowloon Tong; officers and drivers in 29 Squadron, Royal Corps of Transport (RCT) based in Gun Club Hill Barracks; crews for 415 Maritime Troop based on Stonecutters' Island; dog handlers in the Defence Animal Support Unit (DASU) of the Royal Army Veterinary Corps (RAVC) based in Sek Kong; officer instructors in the Royal Army Educational Corps (RAEC); officers and clerks in the Royal Army Pay Corps (RAPC); technicians in the Royal Signals (R Sigs) of the Queen's Gurkha Signals (QGS) and engineers and armourers in the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers (REME). HKMSC trained physical training instructors (PTI) also served in the Army Physical Training Corps (APTC), as medics in the Royal Army Medical Corps (RAMC) based in the British Military Hospital (BMH), military police in the Royal Military Police (RMP), helicopter support crews in 660 Squadron AAC, Army Air Corps (AAC) based at Sek Kong Airfield, cooks in the Army Catering Corps (ACC), Weapons and Supplies Storekeepers in the Royal Army Ordnance Corps (RAOC) and intelligence staff in the Intelligence Corps.\n\nDuring the Gulf War and in the early 1990s, the HKMSC provided officers and soldiers, primarily drivers and ambulance crews, to the United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP) on peacekeeping operations.\n\nIn 1996 the unit was disbanded prior to the transfer of Hong Kong's sovereignty to China in 1997. Just before the handover, the Hong Kong Ex-servicemen Association was formed by some of the local ex-servicemen; the association has branches in the UK and Canada.\n\nIn July 2006, Britain granted full British citizenship to all Gurkha soldiers and their dependants who had served in Hong Kong, however only 500 HKMSC soldiers and their families were granted British citizenship under the British Nationality Selection Scheme (BNSS) before the HKMSC was disbanded.\n\nSome ex-HKMSC soldiers who were resident in the United Kingdom re-enlisted in the British Army on a Military Local Service Engagement (MLSE), with the Military Provost Guard Service (MPGS), and others joined the British Territorial Army (TA).\n\n\n"}

He was best known for his intro \"From the desert to the sea, to all of Southern California, a good evening.\"\n\nAfter serving as a pilot in World War II, Dunphy began his broadcast television career in 1953. He was the news director/anchor at then-CBS owned-and-operated (O&O) WXIX (now CW affiliated WVTV) in Milwaukee. Dunphy also was a sports reporter at another CBS O&O, WBBM-TV, in Chicago. Dunphy also served as a color commentator for Green Bay Packers telecasts on CBS in 1956.\n\nIn 1960, Dunphy took over the anchor chair at the Los Angeles CBS O&O station KNXT (now KCBS-TV), where he anchored Los Angeles' most popular newscast, later titled \"The Big News\", a program that often attracted a quarter of Los Angeles television owners, ratings unheard of in the market. He was still popular when fired in 1975, yet KNXT sought to adopt a faster-paced, \"Eyewitness News\" type format. It was then that Dunphy joined KABC-TV, bringing it to the top of the ratings, making it Southern California's news leader. Since Dunphy's unceremonious firing, Channel 2 never recovered in the ratings, until the mid-2000s. Dunphy left KABC-TV in 1989 and joined the upstart KCAL-TV that July (when it was still KHJ-TV) as one of the pioneering anchors of the three-hour primetime news format, \"Prime 9 News\". He returned to KCBS-TV in 1995 and remained until 1997 as an anchorman, and rejoined KCAL-TV in 1997, where he remained until his death.\n\nDunphy was one of the first newscasters to interview President Richard Nixon after his resignation in 1974. He would later sit down with Ronald Reagan, Jimmy Carter, and Gerald Ford. Dunphy also performed regular cameos in L.A.-based films including \"Warning Shot\" (1967), \"Night of the Lepus\" (1972), \"Oh God!\" (1977), \"Short Cuts\" (1993), \"The Jerky Boys\" (1995) and \"Independence Day\" (1996), as well as in episode 6 of \"Batman\" (1966) Film Way,,Way Out (1966), and is considered to be the inspiration for two fictional television characters: Ted Baxter on \"The Mary Tyler Moore Show\" and Kent Brockman on \"The Simpsons\" (the director of \"Krusty Gets Busted\", Brad Bird, designed the character and modeled him after anchorman Ted Koppel).\n\nDunphy was also a songwriter. One of his songs was called, appropriately, \"From the Desert to the Sea\" and was recorded by country music star T.G. Sheppard.\n\nDunphy was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. He was attacked and shot by would-be robbers in 1983 but made a full recovery. Although he had suffered two previous heart attacks in 1978 and 1991, he had been in good health and had even anchored broadcasts the week before he succumbed to a heart attack on May 20, 2002. He suffered this heart attack on his way to work the week before.\n\nOn this night, former Los Angeles Lakers broadcaster Chick Hearn (who himself would pass away in August of that same year), while doing play-by-play for a Lakers playoff game on KCAL, announced that Dunphy had suffered a heart attack. After the game went off the air, KCAL co-anchor Pat Harvey, fighting back tears, announced Dunphy's death on the 9 PM newscast:\n\nWhen KCBS-TV/KCAL-TV moved into its new studios at CBS Studio Center in 2007, a newsroom was named in Dunphy's honor. KCAL news promos still occasionally incorporate Dunphy's \"from the desert to the sea to all of southern California\" phrase, with other anchors speaking the lines in reference to their program's wide range of coverage.\n\nHe had six children: Jerry Dunphy Jr., Karen Dunphy, Linda Curb, Tad Dunphy, Megan Dunphy and Erin Dunphy.\n\nHe is interred at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in the Hollywood Hills of Los Angeles.\n\nOn May 9, 1984, Dunphy received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for his work in the television industry, located at 6669 Hollywood Boulevard.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1821092", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1821092", "title": "Iberian federalism", "text": "Iberian federalism\n\nIberian federalism, pan-Iberism or simply Iberism (Spanish and , ) are the names for the pan-nationalist ideology supporting the federation of all the territories of the Iberian Peninsula.\n\nPortugal and Spain share a common history to some degree. Spanish and Portuguese are both Romance languages like Catalan, Galician and Asturian, all spoken in the Iberian peninsula.\n\nThe Portuguese language and Galician languages evolved from the medieval Galician-Portuguese when the County of Portugal separated from the Kingdom of León by becoming the Kingdom of Portugal. On the other hand, the Galician language has become increasingly influenced by the Castilian language since Galicia's incorporation into the Crown of Castile as a dependent Kingdom of León.\n\nThe identities of both modern Spain and Portugal developed during the experience of the Reconquista. In 1512, Ferdinand II of Aragon conquered the Kingdom of Navarre bringing the territories of what would become known as modern Spain under a common ruler. However Portugal remained an independent kingdom, competing with Spain (Castile) in colonial expansion. To avoid conflict, the Treaty of Tordesillas divided the world into Portuguese and Castilian hemispheres of influence.\nAs a result of the disappearance of Sebastian I of Portugal at the Battle of Alcácer Quibir, Philip II of Spain exerted his dynastic rights and used Castilian troops to overcome the rival pretender. The national poet of Portugal Luís de Camões opposed Philip, but had himself written some sonnets in Spanish (bilingualism was then common in both courts).\n\nIn 1581, Philip became Philip I of Portugal, joining both crowns into the most extended empire in history up to that time. The Spanish Habsburgs (Philip III of Spain and II of Portugal, Philip IV of Spain and III of Portugal) ruled what has later been called the Iberian Union, a personal union of different kingdoms, including Portugal (with its colonies), Castile (with its colonies), and Aragon. In 1640, the duke of Bragança gathered those restless in Portugal with the support of Cardinal Richelieu of France. His rebellion succeeded and he became the John IV of Portugal. The North African city of Ceuta decided to leave the crown of Portugal and remain under the Spanish king.\n\nIn 1801, the Portuguese city of Olivença was occupied by Spain and passed to Spanish sovereignty as Olivenza. Portugal has never made a formal claim to the territory after the Treaty of Vienna decided that Spain should terminate its occupation of the city, which Spain ignored nor has it acknowledged the Spanish sovereignty over Olivenza. There is no common definition of the border in the area.\n\nIt was José Marchena who, in the 18th century, gave this doctrine a progressive, federal and republican tone in \"l'Avis aux espagnols\". In the Liberal Triennium (1820–1823), the secret liberal organizations tried to spread Iberism in Portugal, to create seven confederated republics, five in Spain and Lusitania Ulterior and Lusitania Citerior in Portugal.\n\nIn the later Revolutionary Sexennium, the movement reached its apogee; General Prim was also in favour of uniting the two countries. After his murder, the First Spanish Republic (1873–1874) seemed the right moment for the union given its federalism.\n\nIn the point of view of the 19th century conservative restorations in Spain and Portugal, the \"iberisms\" played the role of agents of social change with republican and revolutionary stances, thus threatening the stability of the peninsular nations.\nIn the 20th century, Iberism melted into the ideologies of some leftist currents such as the anarchist \"Federación Anarquista Ibérica\" and the \"Federación Ibérica de Juventudes Libertarias\".\n\nThe nationalistic dictatorships of Portugal and Francoist Spain shared many political similarities and some degree of mutual support but both countries were said to live \"back to back\".\n\nCurrently no party represented in either country's parliament has the goal of Iberism but both countries joined the European Economic Community in 1986 and their borders and those of all other countries signing the Schengen accord have been opened since then. The Spanish party Izquierda Republicana has defended 'Iberian Federalism' as political structure for the state.\n\nLarge companies have opened shop in the neighbouring country, and the Portuguese state closed the birth center of the border municipality of Elvas, sending patients to the Extremadura health system. Some groups defend Iberism, including some Spanish and Portuguese officers. One 2006 survey by an Angolan weekly newspaper \"Sol\" showed only 28% of the Portuguese think that Portugal and Spain should be one country.\n42% of these would put the capital in Madrid and about the same, 41%, in Lisbon.\n\nA 2009 poll found 30.3% of Spanish respondents would support a federation but 39.9% of Portuguese respondents would support one. The figures rose to 31 and 45 percent, respectively, in 2010.\n\nA poll conducted by the Spanish University of Salamanca in 2011 found that 39.8% of Spanish respondents and 46.1% of Portuguese respondents supported the creation of the federation between the two countries. 1741 people took part in the poll.\n\n\nThe Iberian flag was created by the Catalan born Spanish diplomat and writer Sinibaldo de Mas i Sans in 1854. It is quartered with the colours of the defunct later day monarchist Portuguese (blue and white) and Spanish and Catalan flags (red and yellow), dating from 1830 and 1785 respectively. The Iberian flag is older than the second republican Spanish and Portuguese flags (1931 and 1911 respectively).\n\nIt is not a coincidence that the Iberian flag has the same colours (in a different order) as the flag of the Maritime Province of Barcelona. Barcelona was the birthplace of Mas i Sans.\n\nAccording to some Iberists, the Federation or Confederation should be formed by the peninsular parts of Portugal and Spain (without the Aran Valley, which should belong to Gascony), the Balearic Islands, Gibraltar, Andorra, and the Basque and Catalan regions of France. Four languages should be official: Castillian, Galician-Portuguese, Catalan and Basque.\n\nMas i Sans wanted the federal or confederate capital city of Iberia to be established at Santarém, Ribatejo, Portugal, but the capital city of the Diocesis Hispaniarum, created by the Roman Emperor Diocletianus in 287 was Emerita Augusta (modern Mérida), in Spanish Extremadura.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1821094", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1821094", "title": "Xana", "text": "Xana\n\nThe xana is a character found in Asturian mythology. Always female, she is a creature of extraordinary beauty believed to live in fountains, rivers, waterfalls or forested regions with pure water. She is usually described as small or slender with long blonde or light brown hair (most often curly), which she tends to with gold or silver combs woven from sun or moonbeams. The origin of the Asturian word \"xana\" is unclear, though some scholars see it as a derivation from the Latin name for the goddess Diana. References to where the mythological xanas lived are still common in Asturian toponyms. They also appear in Eastern Galician and Cantabrian mythology (Anjanas).\n\nThe xanas promise treasures and can be disenchanted. Some xanas also attack people and steal their food. They live in fountains and caves.\n\nA xana can be a beneficial spirit, offering \"love water\" to travelers and rewards of gold or silver to those found worthy through some undefined judgment. Their hypnotic voices can be heard during spring and summer nights. Those who have a pure soul and hear the song will be filled with a sense of peace and love. Those whose souls are not pure will feel they are being suffocated and may be driven insane.\n\nXanas are usually depicted in one of two ways. In one, they appear as young beautiful girls with long blonde hair. This image is usually associated with xanas who possess a treasure or those under a spell. In contrast, in tales in which the xanas steal children and enter homes to bite or steal, the xanas are small, thin and dark-colored.\n\nXanas have children called xaninos (singular: xanín), but because they cannot take care of them—xanas cannot produce milk to feed their babies—they usually take a human baby from his cradle and put their own fairy child in instead, similar to changelings in other cultures. The human mother realizes this change when the baby grows up in just a few months. In order to unmask the xanín, one must put some pots and egg shells near the fire, and, if the baby is a changeling, he will exclaim, \"I was born one hundred years ago, and since then I have not seen so many egg shells near the fire!\" \n\nThe stories about xanas can be divided into four broad categories. First, stories in which the xana has a child. In these stories, the xana switches her baby for that of another woman. Second, stories of xanas who suffer spells. In these stories, an act performed according to a secret norm can disenchant them. Third, xanas who possess treasures and riches. The xana may have acquired the riches accidentally, or through donation or theft; sometimes the human character of the tale obtains the treasure, but most of the times he does not. Finally, stories about xanas who are malicious. The most important tales of this category are those in which the xana enters a home through a keyhole; those in which the xana takes and enchants someone; those in which the xana transforms into animals; and those in which the xana provides a magic belt.\n\nCuban writer Daína Chaviano uses the xana motif in her novel \"The Island of Eternal Love\". When one of the characters encounters a xana while she is combing her hair, the dialogue between them marks a crucial twist in the plot.\n\nKelley Armstrong's \"Darkness Rising\" series has three characters who are believed to be xanas. Resurgent members of this supernatural race due to genetic modification: Hayley Morris, Nicole Tillson and the deceased Serena. Given their powers and association with water, Serena's death by drowning is a point of mystery in the story.\n"}

It is home to many types of music.\n\nThe county has a well-documented and still vibrant folk music heritage, as it was studied by one of the earliest British musicologists, Cecil Sharp, who cut his teeth on the rich vein of folk music tradition in Somerset. Sharp began his career of collecting folk songs in Somerset in 1903 with the editorial help of his friend Rev Charles Marson, vicar of Hambridge. Cycling around the county during holidays, Sharp ultimately collected more than 1,500 songs from Somerset. The folksinging tradition in Somerset centers on solo, a cappella singing and playing—at home, at work, and at gatherings, small or large. Sharp's five volume collection of Somerset folk songs formed the basis for his \"\", a seminal 1907 publication. Some of Sharp's collections formed the basis for \"Songs of the West\" (with Sabine Baring-Gould) and \"Somerset Rhapsody\" by Gustav Holst and the \"March from Somerset\" in Vaughan Williams' \"English Folk Song Suite\".\n\nSomerset also has a vibrant contemporary folk music scene. Many well known folk musicians and songwriters, including Ange Hardy and Reg Meuross, are from the county, as well as up-and-coming artists such as Kitty McFarlane, Mary Bateman, Hannah Cumming and Johnny Dyer, and The Leylines. The best known folk act to come out of Somerset is undoubtedly the Wurzels, who brought the region's association with cider and farming to the international stage. The region boasts several popular folk festivals, including the Priddy Folk Festival, the West Somerset Folk Festival, Bath Folk Festival, Stogumber Festival, and smaller events such as the Kingsbury May Festival.\n\nThe City of Bath Bach Choir (CBBC) was founded in October 1946 by Cuthbert Bates, who was also a founding father of the Bath Bach Festival in 1950. The choir gave its inaugural concert in June 1947 in Bath Abbey, a performance of J. S. Bach's great Mass in B Minor. Cuthbert Bates, as well as the founder, was also the choir's principal conductor.\n\nSomerset chamber choir was formed in 1984 by former members of Somerset Youth Choir, and typically gives two concerts annually. Initially, these were mainly around Taunton, but in July 1992 the choir gave it first Wells Cathedral concert.\n\nSituated in Great Elm, Frome, the Jackdaws Music Education Trust was established by Maureen Lehane with the aim of improving participation in and enjoyment of Classical music and music making through weekend courses, concerts, a young artists programme and education projects. Their current projects include Jack's Music Club — a music club for teenagers promoting social music making, supported by Somerset County Music — and OperaPLUS, which will be staging Donizetti's L'elisir d'amore (sung in English as 'The Love Potion') working with locals schools and Jackdaws Young Artists.\n\nThere are many music institutions that play a major part in the musical life of Somerset.

{"id": "1821105", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1821105", "title": "Malankara Metropolitan", "text": "Malankara Metropolitan\n\nMalankara Metropolitan was a legal title given to the head of the Malankara Church Puthenkoor Christians, by the Government of Travancore and Cochin in South India. This title was awarded by a proclamation from the King of Travancore and the King of Cochin. The Prime jurisdiction regarding the temporal, ecclesiastical and spiritual \nadministration of the Malankara Church is vested in the Malankara Metropolitan, who is believed according to tradition, to oversee its faithful from the Apostolic See of Saint Thomas. His Holiness Moran Mor Baselios Mar Thoma Paulose II Catholicos is the present Malankara Metrapolitan.\n\nHistorically the primate or the leader of St Thomas Christians were known as Jathikku Karthavyan (leader of Community), Malankara Moopen (Elder of the Community), Archdeacon or Arkadyokon (High Priest). In the 16th century to resist the Latinization attempts of the Jesuits, it became necessary to elevate the Archdeacon to a position of 'Metropolitan Bishop' named as Mar Thoma. In 1653 the Archdeacon position was elevated to Bishopric by laying hands of twelve priests in the absence of a valid Bishop. This was an emergency step. Then onwards the Metropolitan Bishop assumed the honorific ecclesiastical title Marthoma. This title was used from 1653 to 1815. Later a regular 'Bishopric' was established in Malankara with the help of Gregorios Abdal Jaleel. Until a few hundred years back, the leadership of St Thomas Christian Community was dynastically held by members of the Pakalomattom family.\n\nMarthoma I had survived a number of assassination attempts. He died on 25 April 1670 and was interred in Angamaly St Mary's Syrian Church.\n\nIn June 1770, he accepted re-consecration from Antiochian bishops in order to avoid a split in the Church and the title Dionysius was accepted. Marthoma VI did not approve the appointment of Kattumangattu Abraham Coorilos as a metropolitan by a bishop from Antioch. This was the beginning of Malabar Independent Syrian Church. He was forced to conduct a service according to Chaldean Catholic rites but escaped during a rebellion in Travancore under Velu Thampi. Rev.Dr. Claudius Buchanan visited and made arrangement for the translation of the Bible into Malayalam. Marthoma presented him the Peshitto Bible written in the old Syriac. This manuscript is kept in the public library of the University of Cambridge.\n\n\nIt was when John Munro was the British Resident of Travancore, that Pulikkottil Joseph Ittoop Ramban was ordained as a bishop by Geevarghese Philexenos (Kidangan) (1811–29) of Malabar Independent Syrian Church (Thozhyoor Church) on 22 March 1815. He was given the episcopal title Dionysius II, as he was the second bishop in the Malankara Church to get this title. After the death of Thoma VIII, he was made the head of the Malankara Church by a Royal proclamation issued by the King of Travancore and later by the King of Cochin. The proclamation insisted every non-Catholic Syrian Christian of Travancore-Cochin obey the Malankara Metropolitan. From then onwards the head of the Malankara Syrian Orthodox Church legally came to be known as Malankara Metropolitan. The position of the Malankara Metropolitan in the 19th century is an upgrowth from the position of the previous Thomas and Archdeacons. The power and authority of the Malankara Metropolitan got more recognition than the power and authority of the previous Archdeacons' and Marthomas' because the British Residents of Travancore were favorably disposed towards the Malankara Church.\n\nFrom 1816, Dionysius II, Dionysius III, Dionysius IV and Mathews Athanasius were successive Malankara Metropolitans. However inspired and encouraged by the Anglican missionaries who cooperated in the old seminary at Kottayam, Mathews Athanasius wanted to reform the traditional Syrian church. A parallel group under Dionysius V was working against his reformational schemes. During the latter half of the 19th century there occurred two factions in the community; the minority faction that favored reformation and the majority faction who were against it. Dionysius V of the (Syrian traditionalists) invited and brought Ignatius Peter IV of Antioch to Malankara in 1875. The Patriarch divided the Malankara church into seven dioceses; Dionysius V was declared as the Malankara Metropolitan and was given charge of Quilon Diocese in the Synod of Mulanthuruthy(27 to 30 June 1876). Neither the incumbent Metropolitan Mathews Athanasius nor the Churches favoring him participated in the synod.\n\nA series of court cases followed thereafter. The Travancore Royal court, by order on 14 July 1889 declared that Dionysius V due to his allegiance to the See of Antioch and acceptance by the majority of Malankara Syrians, is the rightful Malankara Metropolitan and Thomas Athanasius has no rights or claims to that office. Thus the reformed faction separated and organized themselves as the independent Mar Thoma Syrian Church. The majority faction that kept Syriac Orthodox faith came under the leadership of the new Malankara Metropolitan Dionysius V, subject to the Patriarch of Antioch.\n\nHowever, later after the establishment of Catholicate in Malankara in 1912, again a rift occurred among Malankara Syrian Church over the spiritual authority of Patriarch of Antioch. There were several years of litigation between the two factions, the Metran faction, and the Bava faction. The Supreme court of India declared that the Patriarch has no power in Malankara Church and his spiritual power had also come to vanishing point since the establishment of Catholicate. This caused the Malankara Church to split into,\n\n\nThereafter the Malankara Metropolitans didn't use the name \"Marthoma\" with their ecclesiastical title until 1975 (when Baselios Mar Thoma Mathews I became Malankara Metropolitan).\n\nPulikottil Joseph Dionysius (Malankara Metropolitan) – (1816) was consecrated by Philoxenos II, of the Malabar Independent Syrian Church (Thozhiyoor Sabha). Died on 25 November 1816 and laid to rest at Orthodox Old Seminary, Kottayam. (He didn't use the official title Marthoma even though people affectionately called him Marthoma X.)\n\nTravancore Royal Court Verdict on Seminary Suit 1889\n\nAfter the death of Malankara Metropolitan Geevarghese Dionysius VI of Vattasseril(1934); the Malankara Association held at M.D Seminary Kottayam elected Catholicos Baselios Geevarghese II as the Malankara Metropolitan and passed a Constitution for Malankara Church popularly known as 1934 CONSTITUTION or Malankara Church Constitution.\nSince 1934, the Catholicos of the East is holding the Office of Malankara Metropolitan.\n\n\nAccording to Supreme Court order, the Malankara Syrian Christian Association(Parliament of the Malankara church) was conducted under the observation of Supreme Court of India in order to set right the position of Malankara Metropolitan H.H Catholicos Baselios Mar Thoma Mathews II.\n\nThe Association Meeting held on 20 March 2002 at Parumala Seminary elected Baselios Mar Thoma Mathews II as the Malankara Metropolitan. The secret ballot voting was conducted at the Seminary and result was declared by the Supreme Court Observer Justice V.S. Mulimud. Total polling was 3483 votes. Out of this 3464 votes were cast in favour of Baselios Mathews II, 10 voted against and 9 were invalid. The total delegates registered for the Association was 3528., \"The supreme authority of the Malankara Syrian Christian Association has been unambiguously approved by the Supreme Court.The factions no longer exist and there is only one official Malankara Church.\" The election was held as per the Supreme Court's 1995 judgement on the dispute in the Malankara church.\n\n\n"}

As a member of the , Kajika is extremely strong and has special powers. As a child, Kajika was very evil. His greatest known evil was chasing after a defenseless fox and smashing it with a giant rock. Upon being killed, the spirit of the fox cursed Kajika and Kajika was turned into a fox-man. Kajika was then kicked out of his village because of his monstrous appearance, and the only way to break the curse was to save the lives of 1,000 life forms. The spirit of the dead fox, named Gigi, decided to accompany Kajika on his journey. Upon saving 1,000 life forms, Kajika will go back to being a boy and Gigi will once again get its body back.\n\nAfter five years of saving life forms, the team only has ten more lives to save. One day, Kajika runs across a girl and saves her from a gang of bad guys. After defeating the gang, Kajika then uses a special power to remove all of their evil, turning them good. Kajika learns that the girl he saved is named Haya, and is told that the guys were after her because of the Dragon Egg she possesses. The Dragon egg is extremely rare and was stolen by the gang leader Gibachi from . Haya then went to Sumakia and stole it from Gibachi. She then went on a quest to return the egg. Gibachi tries to kill Haya and recover the egg. Haya then asks Kajika to help her on her quest.\n\nAs the three go to Ronron island we are told why Gibachi wants the egg so badly. There is an old saying that says if you drink the blood of a young Dragon, then you will gain incredible powers. No one is sure if this is true, but the baby dragon does have Dragomin in its blood which allows it to mature extremely fast. As the three set off, though, Haya makes up an excuse as to why she can not continue, but it is really because she fears Gibachi. So, now it is up to Kajika and Giri to return the egg, but it will not be so easy now that they are being hunted down by the world-famous assassin known as Isaza, who is also a member of the powerful Kawa tribe. Kajika is an extremely strong boy, but it is also revealed that being turned into a fox-man is holding down his true powers.\n\n\nWritten and illustrated by Akira Toriyama, \"Kajika\" was serialized in \"Weekly Shōnen Jump\" magazine from issue #32 to #44 of 1998.

As well as running railways and harbours in the three territories it ran inland shipping services on Lake Victoria, Lake Kyoga, Lake Albert, the Victoria Nile and the Albert Nile.\n\nThe Malayan Railway sold EAR&H eight metre gauge USATC S118 Class steam locomotives in 1948, and another eight in 1949. EAR&H converted them to oil fuel and numbered them 2701–2716, making them the 27 class. EAR&H allocated them to its Tabora Depot on its Tanganyika section. They entered service in 1949 and 1950, working the lines to Mwanza, Kigoma and Mpanda where their light axle loading was an advantage and their high firebox enabled them to run through seasonal flooding on the Kigoma and Mpanda branches.

In 2010 it was gained by Simon Reevell, a Conservative.\n\nOne of the five other parties' candidates standing in 2015 kept their deposit, by winning more than 5% of the vote in 2015, UKIP's Thackray, who emulated the national swing of +9.5% by an entry candidature, polling 12.4% of the vote.\n\nTurnout since 1918 has ranged between 87.9% of the vote in 1950, to 58.8% in 2001.\n\n1868–1885: The townships of Dewsbury, Batley, and Soothill.\n\n1918–1950: The County Borough of Dewsbury.\n\n1950–1955: The County Borough of Dewsbury, the Municipal Borough of Ossett, and the Urban Districts of Heckmondwike and Mirfield.\n\n1955–1983: The County Borough of Dewsbury, the Municipal Borough of Ossett, and the Urban District of Mirfield.\n\n1983–1997: The Borough of Kirklees wards of Denby Dale, Dewsbury East, Dewsbury West, Kirkburton, Mirfield, and Thornhill.\n\n1997–2010: The Borough of Kirklees wards of Dewsbury East, Dewsbury West, Heckmondwike, Mirfield, and Thornhill.\n\n2010–present: The Borough of Kirklees wards of Denby Dale, Dewsbury East, Dewsbury South, Dewsbury West, Kirkburton, and Mirfield.\n\nThe constituency covers the towns of Dewsbury and Mirfield, and the surrounding areas.\n\nIn the 2010 redistribution, the constituency lost the Labour-leaning ward of Heckmondwike, but gained the Conservative-leaning wards of Denby Dale and Kirkburton.\n\nThe seat has a substantial Muslim population and few rural parts, with Dewsbury itself strongly Labour, and the remaining wards mostly Conservative. The seat has close to national average income and several developments have desirable views as the upland town cuts into the Pennines. Relatively few people rely upon social housing. In the light of increasing concern over Muslim extremism, the Labour Party candidate Shahid Malik enjoyed a fairly large public media profile after his victory in 2005, with various TV appearances and interviews, strongly denouncing believers in and adherents of such views; however, this has also been a strong area for the British National Party, who obtained their highest vote in Britain (13.1%) in the 2005 general election, much of it taken at the Labour Party's expense. They have also had a substantial vote at local level, when in 2006 for the first time in the UK the BNP polled more votes than any other party standing. However, at the 2010 general election, the BNP's popularity in Dewsbury fell (despite a substantial nationwide rise in support for the party compared to five years previously) and they gained a mere 6% of the vote.\n\nGeneral Election 1939/40:\n\nAnother General Election was due to take place before the end of 1940.

Since the 1964 general election, the only occasion when the winning candidate's majority exceeded 10% of the votes cast was in 1992, and three different parties have held the seat during this period. Since 1987 it has been won by either Conservative or Labour candidates.\n\nColne Valley was one of 17 seats won (held or gained) by a Labour candidate in 2017 from a total of 22 covering its county, with Thelma Walker's 2017 win being one of 30 net gains of the Labour Party. However, former MP Jason McCartney took the seat back for the Conservatives in 2019.\n\nThe seat is named after the Colne; one of three rivers so-named in the UK and one of three main rivers in the seat; its three main towns sit on hillsides and the local dwellings are mainly stone-built. A sizeable proportion of retirees live in the area, celebrated in the decades-long television comedy \"Last of the Summer Wine\", centred on Holmfirth in the seat.\n\nIn the three decades post-World War II, the area had the distinction of being one of the few Labour/Liberal marginals, changing hands between the parties on several occasions. Since 1983, it has been a three-way marginal seat. It was a bellwether constituency from the 1987 general election to the 2017 general election, which saw Labour's Thelma Walker narrowly gain the seat from the Conservatives while the latter remained the largest party in Parliament.

The constituency comprises rural countryside broken up by the towns of Holmfirth and Meltham and the villages of Marsden, Slaithwaite, Honley, Brockholes, Linthwaite, New Mill and Golcar. The seat was once held by the Independent Labour MP Victor Grayson, who later disappeared in mysterious circumstances in 1920.\n\nThe area of Saddleworth, which actually lies on the Western side of the Pennines compared to the rest of the constituency and is separate from the main Colne Valley itself, became part of the new metropolitan county of Greater Manchester in 1974, and from 1983 became part of a new constituency along with Littleborough.\n\nIn 1981, the Boundary Commission's proposals combined much of the seat with a large portion of the Huddersfield West seat.

The Commission recommended that the division consist of the whole of the Crossgates, Roundhay, Seacroft, and Shadwell wards, together with the larger parts of two other wards which were to be divided between divisions: North-East ward save for a small part west of Accommodation Road in Burmantofts which was placed in the South-East division and that part of North ward east of Gledhow Park and Moor Allerton. This created a division with a population of 74,054 (according to the 1911 Census); 38,307 lived in the part of North ward, 28,349 in the part of North-East ward, and 7,398 in Roundhay, Seacroft, Shadwell and Cross Gates. Parliament enacted the new boundaries without alteration in the Representation of the People Act 1918.\n\nThe initial report of the Boundary Commission in 1947 recommended that the North East division consist of the Burmantofts, Harehills, Potternewton and Roundhay wards. This meant a slightly smaller electorate (in respect of the register in force on 15 October 1946) from 78,498 to a still hefty 66,671; the main change was the removal of Seacroft to the South East division. The Government brought in a Representation of the People Bill based on the recommendations, but after pressure from some affected local authorities, decided give extra seats to some towns and cities where the electorate had resulted in the area narrowly missing out on an additional Member: on 18 March 1948 the Government put down amendments to the Bill which included increasing the number of seats in the County Borough of Leeds from six to seven. The Boundary Commission produced revised recommendations contained the wards of Burmantofts, Harehills and Roundhay, and having an electorate of 51,181. The Boundary Commission consulted on their proposals and received objections to the arrangements in the west of the city which led them to revise the recommendations in May 1948. The alterations had knock-on effects on the North East division, which was now recommended to comprise the North, Roundhay and Woodhouse wards for 56,283 electors.\n\nWhen the Home Secretary James Chuter Ede proposed altering the Bill in line with the altered recommendations, the sitting MP for Leeds North-East Alice Bacon (supported by George Porter, MP for Leeds Central) moved an amendment to alter the name of a division the Boundary Commission had called 'East Central' to 'North East', and altering the division the Boundary Commission had called 'North East' to 'North'. The Government accepted the amendment, as effected in the Representation of the People Act 1948. The Leeds North East division from then consisted of the Burmantofts, Harehills, Potternewton and Richmond Hill wards and had a 1946 electorate of 49,882. The division was considerably smaller in area after changes in 1950.\n\nAlterations in ward boundaries in Leeds on 28 July 1950 led the Boundary Commission to make an interim report on alterations of constituency boundaries in 1951; although the definition of the constituency was the same, the ward changes had a minor impact on the divisional boundaries. In 1954 the Boundary Commission looked again at boundaries, and recommended that the North East division of Leeds consist of the wards of Allerton, Potternewton, Roundhay and Woodhouse. Three out of the four wards (Allerton, Roundhay and Woodhouse wards) came from the abolished Leeds North, while Burmantofts and Harehills wards were removed to Leeds East, and Richmond Hill ward went to Leeds South East.\n\nBy the time of the Second Periodical Report of the Boundary Commission in the late 1960s, the wards of the County Borough of Leeds had again been altered. The commission recommended that the Borough Constituency of Leeds North East consist of the wards of Chapel Allerton, Harehills, Roundhay, Scott Hall and Talbot. The change decreased the electorate (on the October 1968 register) slightly from 53,719 to 53,461. These boundary changes took effect from the February 1974 general election. The Third Periodical Review in 1983 initially proposed a Leeds North East County Constituency comprising 33,200 electors out of 60,120 in the existing borough together with half of the previous Leeds North West seat and Harewood and Wetherby from the Barkston Ash seat. At a public inquiry the plans were challenged and the assistant Commissioner recommended that the Leeds North East constituency remain urban and based on the previous seat, comprising Chapel Allerton, Moortown, North and Roundhay wards; this alteration was accepted by the Boundary Commission. The changes still removed 10,000 electors, mostly to Leeds East but some to Leeds Central and Elmet, and brought in 16,000 electors, mostly from Leeds North West and Barkston Ash and a small number from Leeds South East. No changes were made in the Fourth Periodical Review in 1995.\nBoundary changes implemented the Fifth Periodic Review of Westminster constituencies — their final recommendations almost matched initial proposals and so the seat comprises Alwoodley, Chapel Allerton, Moortown and Roundhay — which took effect at the 2010 general election. By these changes, 2,100 electors out of 64,106 in the existing seat were removed to Elmet and Rothwell, while 3,875 were added from Leeds North West, 700 from Leeds Central, and 349 from Leeds East.\n\nThis is a diverse constituency covering the northern half of the City of Leeds. It was once a Conservative stronghold, represented for thirty-one years by the senior Tory politician and former cabinet minister Keith Joseph that has since 1997 seen relatively strong Labour support as many large Victorian houses have gradually been converted into flats and multiple-occupancy homes, helping them gain the seat in 1997 for the first time since the 1950s, and have held on since. A year after Hamilton increased his majority in 2001, psephologists Simon Henig and Lewis Baston wrote that it was now possible to think of Labour winning Leeds North East in a general election which it lost. \n\"The Guardian\" described the seat in 2010 as:\nThe seat stretches from the countryside around the Eccup reservoir to the north, through affluent residential suburbs such as Alwoodley, Roundhay, and Moortown, with their large Jewish populations, up-and-coming neighbourhoods popular with young professionals such as Chapel Allerton, down to deprived inner-city areas such as Chapeltown, the centre of Leeds' Afro-Caribbean community.\n\nAt the first election in 1918, it was decided that a Conservative candidate would receive the Coalition 'coupon' in Leeds North East, as four Liberals had received coupons in other Leeds divisions and Labour was allowed an unopposed return in Leeds South-East. Major John Birchall, the Coalition Conservative candidate, was opposed by Labour Party candidate John Bromley, leader of the Locomotive Engineman's Society. \"The Times\" described Bromley as \"prone to verbal violence\" and with \"an unnecessary railway strike in his war service record\". A third candidate, Captain W.P. Brigstock, announced himself for the National Party, but was felt to have negligible prospects and did not stand. Birchall won comfortably, and went on to represent the seat until he retired in February 1940. His majority never fell below 4,000.\n\nBirchall's resignation resulted in a by-election in March 1940, Professor J.J. Craik Henderson was nominated as a Conservative. Under the war-time electoral truce no Labour or Liberal candidate stood, but he was opposed by Sydney Allen of the British Union of Fascists who campaigned on an anti-war policy. Henderson won the by-election with 97.1% of the vote. Despite the division's history, Labour went into the 1945 general election with a degree of optimism. As it turned out Professor Craik Henderson could not defend his seat, and Alice Bacon won for Labour on a 22.6% swing.\n\nThe constituency with new boundaries at the 1950 election was reckoned to be helpful to Alice Bacon, and therefore likely to be held by Labour. She indeed held the seat at both the 1950 and 1951 general elections.\n\nThe complex changes to Leeds' Parliamentary boundaries in 1955, which reduced the city from seven seats to six, particularly affected Leeds North East which was reckoned to be the seat which was abolished. In the event Alice Bacon was selected in Leeds South East, while that seat's sitting MP Denis Healey was selected for the new Leeds East constituency. George Porter, sitting MP for Leeds Central, failed to be selected for any new seat when his constituency was abolished and retired. The new North East division was effectively based on the old North division, and that seat's sitting Conservative MP Osbert Peake came forward as candidate. He was thought to have a slightly less safe seat in the new Leeds North East. Peake won easily, and after he received a peerage, his successor Sir Keith Joseph held on in a 1956 by-election.\n\nJoseph had a relatively safe seat at first but his majority fell in the elections of the 1960s. At the 1970 general election, it was noted that the seat had the highest immigrant population among the constituencies in Leeds, and had also produced the smallest swing to the Conservatives at that election. The 1979 general election saw the constituency swing to Labour, against the national trend; in 1987 it was noted that while the Conservatives had held the seat, they had done poorly in terms of votes.\n\nIn the run-up to the 1997 general election, the seat was a target for the Labour Party. The Leeds North East Constituency Labour Party selected Liz Davies, an Islington councillor on the party's left wing, but the Labour Party National Executive Committee refused to endorse her candidacy over connections to the Labour Briefing magazine; her appeal to the Labour Party conference was unsuccessful. The winner of the second selection, Fabian Hamilton, was identified as a Blairite and comfortably gained the seat when the election was called. The result of the 2010 general election saw Hamilton retain the seat, with a further pro-Labour swing in 2015 and a majority of nearly 17,000 in 2017, the largest since Labour gained the seat two decades ago. Although Hamilton's share of the vote fell in 2019, the Conservative share fell further and his majority increased to over 17,000.\n\n The Conservative Party suspended Amjad Bashir on 20 November 2019. He still appeared on ballot papers under the Conservative label, as nominations had closed by the time of the suspension.\n\n\n\n"}

The Leeds North West boundary was revised prior to the 1983 general election, bringing in Otley and the nearby villages of Bramhope, Pool-in-Wharfedale and Arthington from the abolition of the Ripon constituency.\n\nThe constituency was held for the Conservative Party by Donald Kaberry from its creation in 1950 until his retirement in 1983, and then by Keith Hampson (1983–1997), who had previously been MP for Ripon. It was taken for Labour in the 1997 general election by Harold Best, who was re-elected in the 2001 general election. Best retired at the 2005 general election. The seat was contested for Labour by Judith Blake (at that time Deputy Leader of the Labour Group on Leeds City Council, and later also Labour's candidate in the 2010 general election), but it was taken for the Liberal Democrats by Greg Mulholland. Mulholland was re-elected in 2010 and 2015. Alex Sobel regained the seat for Labour in the 2017 general election.\n\nThis constituency has one of the biggest student populations in the country at over a quarter of the electorate; it comprises outer Leeds suburbs that are professional, middle-to-high income and residential.\n\nIt is within the Yorkshire and the Humber European Parliament constituency, which is represented by three Brexit Party, one Labour, one Liberal Democrat and one Green Party MEPs.\n\n\n"}

The area has a tradition of being working-class, but it has now become almost entirely gentrified as nearby Leeds has expanded as a financial centre.\n\nOssett is now actually the largest town in the area, due to its high growth in recent years. The Tory vote is very low in Normanton itself and in Ossett, but councillors have been elected for Horbury and for Wrenthorpe. Until recently the LibDems had all three councillors for the Ossett ward, but have never performed well in general elections, in this area. Stanley and Outwood East is a fairly safe Labour ward.\n\nThe constituency is nicknamed the banana constituency on account of its unusual shape.\n\nThe village of Altofts, located just to the north of Normanton, was included in the constituency, despite being part of a Castleford ward, and due to move into a proposed \"Pontefract and Castleford\" seat.\n\nFollowing their review of parliamentary representation in West Yorkshire, the Boundary Commission for England had created a Normanton and Pontefract constituency. In late May 2006, the Commission published a revised recommendation changing the name of this constituency to Normanton, Pontefract and Castleford.\n\nLocal newspapers and the Labour Party opposed the initial change, but following a public consultation the Commission decided to create the seat conceding only a name change – from Pontefract and Castleford, to Normanton and Pontefract. This was extended to cover all three names. The wards of Wrenthorpe and Outwood West and Stanley and Outwood East – the most affluent parts of the constituency – were joined to the Conservative-leaning commuter town of Morley, which is in the Leeds district, as Morley and Outwood. At the time local groups and newspapers protested that this represented a takeover of the Wakefield district by the Leeds district. An early concern of the Labour Party was that Morley and Outwood would be won by the Conservatives, which ultimately did happen at the 2015 general election. Ossett and Horbury were moved to the Wakefield constituency.\n\nThe constituency elected only Labour MPs since 1905, the longest run (with Gower and Makerfield) of any UK constituency.

The U.S. Post Office at Minturn (ZIP Code 81645) now serves Gilman postal addresses.\n\nFounded in 1886 during the Colorado Silver Boom, the town later became a center of lead and zinc mining in Colorado, centered on the now-flooded Eagle Mine. It was abandoned in 1984 by order of the Environmental Protection Agency because of toxic pollutants, including contamination of the ground water, as well as unprofitability of the mines. It is currently a ghost town on private property and is strictly off limits to the public. At the time of the abandonment, the mining operations were owned by Viacom International.\n\nIn of 2007, The Ginn Company had plans to build a private ski resort with private home sites across Battle Mountain --- including development at the Gilman townsite. On February 27, 2008 the Minturn Town Council unanimously approved annexation and development plans for of Ginn Resorts’ 1,700-unit\nBattle Mountain residential ski and golf resort; Ginn's Battle Mountain development includes much of the old Gilman townsite. On May 20, 2008 the town of Minturn approved the annexation in a public referendum with 87% of the vote. As of September 9, 2009 the Ginn Company has backed out of development plans for the Battle Mountain Property. Crave Real Estate Ventures, who was the original finance to Ginn, took over day to day operations of the property.\n\nThe town sits at an elevation of 8950 ft (2,700 m) on a dramatic 600-foot (180 m) cliff above the Eagle River on the flank of Battle Mountain. It is located southeast of Minturn and north of Tennessee Pass along U.S. Highway 24. The remnants of the townsite are visible in many places along the curves of the highway. More recent housing situated on the steep flank of the mountain itself near the former mines.\nThe mining district became the richest and most successful in Eagle County. The ore occurs in sulfide replacement deposits of three types: 1) thin-bedded deposits in the Sawatch Quartzite, (2) highly elongated ore bodies in the Leadville Limestone (here completely dolomitized), and (3) vertical pipes or chimneys cutting across the various formations. The ore minerals in order of decreasing abundance are sphalerite, chalcopyrite, and galena. The non-ore minerals pyrite and siderite are also abundant in the ore bodies.\n\nSeveral mining operations had sprouted along Battle Mountain by 1879, the first year of the Colorado Silver Boom. The town of Gilman and nearby mining operations were developed in the 1880s by John Clinton, a prospector, judge, and speculator from nearby Red Cliff. In 1887, gold and silver were discovered in two vertical chimneys at the Ground Hog Mine, which continued to produce gold and silver ore until the 1920s.\n\nIn the 1880s, Clinton acquired a number of mining operations in the vicinity, including the profitable Iron Mask, noted for its numerous caverns with crystal formations. Clinton developed the area as a town and improved the mining operations with higher capitalization. The town, which Clinton developed in order to keep miners at the site, was initially named for him. He donated the land for its initial schoolhouse and built its first boarding house. The Denver and Rio Grande Railroad reached the mining camp of Belden at the base of the cliff in 1882. By 1899, it had a population of approximately 300, as well as a newspaper, called the \"Gilman Enterprise\".\n\nAs they reached the deeper primary sulfide ores, the miners found that the ore contained so much zinc that the smelters refused to buy it. A roaster and magnetic separator were installed in 1905 to separate out the zinc minerals, turning the problem into an asset. The mining operations transitioned increasingly to zinc, although the Eagle Mine was still the leading producer of silver in the state in 1930.\n\nThe New Jersey Zinc Company entered Gilman in 1912, and over a period of years bought all the principal mines and the entire townsite. Zinc was the economic mainstay until 1931, when low zinc prices forced the company to switch to mining copper-silver ores. Zinc production resumed in 1941, and remained the principal product of the mines until they were closed in the 1980s.\n\nThe town population was a few hundred in the 1960s. At one time, the town had an infirmary, grocery store, and bowling alley. The town experienced labor strife several times in the 1950s, partly inflamed by the out-of-state corporate ownership. By 1970, total production at the mines was 10 million tons of ore; 393,000 troy ounces (12,200 kg) of gold; 66,000,000 troy ounces (2,100,000 kg) of silver; 105,000 tons of copper; 148,000 tons of lead; and 858,000 tons of zinc.\n\nAfter the closure of the mine and the abandonment of the town, a area, which included 8 million tons of mine waste, were designated a Superfund site by the EPA and placed on the National Priorities List in 1986.\n\nThe townsite is a victim of vandalization, and the town's main street is heavily tagged. There are only a few intact windows left in town, as twenty years of vandalism have left almost every glass object in the town destroyed.\n\nHowever, many parts of the town are almost as they were when the mine shut down. The main shaft elevators still sit ready for ore cars, permanently locked at the top level. Several cars and trucks still sit in their garages, left behind by their owners.\n\nBecause of its size, modernity and level of preservation, the town is also the subject of interest for many historians, explorers, and photographers.\n\n"}

Parliament legislated for, from an unusual disfranchisement in 1826 of a Cornish rotten borough, two additional MPs. From April 1784 until September 1812, one of the two members elected was William Wilberforce, internationally recognised as a leading figure in abolitionism (the anti-slavery movement). The large county was given far greater representation by the Reform Act 1832: Belle Vue's electors until 1885, alongside other Forty Shilling Freeholders non-resident in the Parliamentary Borough of Wakefield itself but owning such property in any part of the county division could elect the two members for that division: this became the West Riding of Yorkshire from 1832 until 1865 (which had its polling place in this city), after which, the relevant county subdivision became the Southern West Riding until 1885.\n\nWakefield became a county division under the Redistribution of Seats Act 1885, drawing in, as an extension, the Belle Vue area of the parish of Sandal Magna.\n\nWakefield has returned Labour MPs since 1932. The size of majority has fluctuated between absolute and marginal. The 2015 result gave the seat the 27th-smallest majority of Labour's 232 seats by percentage of majority. In 2019, Wakefield lost the Labour majority and returned the first Conservative MP in 87 years.\n\nIn general elections since 1923 the runner-up candidate has been a Conservative. Six non-Labour candidates stood in 2015 of whom two, those which were Conservative and from UKIP won more than 5% of the vote, keeping their deposits.\n\nRt Hon Arthur Greenwood was succeeded by Clement Attlee as leader of the Opposition in 1945, a few months before the party's landslide election victory. He had been from 1929–1931 the Minister of State (present equivalent: Secretary of State) for Health under the Second MacDonald ministry. In this role he successfully steered the Housing Act 1930 through both Houses of Parliament under the minority government, which expended more significant subsidies for slum clearance, allowing more affordable, spacious housing to be built for residents of slums. When the wartime coalition government was formed, Winston Churchill appointed him to the British War Cabinet as Minister without Portfolio in 1940. He was generally seen in such a role as of little wartime legislative effect, but in May 1940 he emerged as Churchill's strongest and most vocal supporter in the lengthy War Cabinet debates on whether to accept or reject a peace offer from Germany. Without the vote in favour of fighting on by Greenwood and Clement Attlee, Churchill would not have had the slim majority he needed to do so.\n\nRt Hon Arthur Creech Jones was Secretary of State for the Colonies from October 1946 until February 1950, appropriately given that in June 1936 he pressed the Government, who were encouraging Colonies to set up memorials to King George V, to follow the example of Uganda and set up a technical educational institution. The Labour Party nominated him to the Colonial Office's Educational Advisory Committee in 1936, on which he served for nine years. In 1937, he was a founding member of the Trades Union Congress Colonial Affairs Committee, and in 1940 he founded the Fabian Colonial Bureau.\n\nMary Creagh, since October 2010 has been the Shadow Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, succeeding Rt Hon Hilary Benn.\n\nTurnout in general elections since 1918 has ranged between 54.5% in 2001 and 87.3% in 1950.\n\nThe constituency has a rolling landscape with villages surrounding the city of Wakefield which is well connected to West Yorkshire in particular Leeds, Bradford and Huddersfield, however also via two junctions of the M1 to the west, to South Yorkshire such as Barnsley, Rotherham and Sheffield. The small city itself has a large central trading and industrial estate, a central park, Clarence Park which includes a national athletics training squad, a Rugby League major team, Wakefield Trinity and its own Cathedral.
