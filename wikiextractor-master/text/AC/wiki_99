Sued for monetary damages by a slaveholder whose escaped slaves he aided, he was a party to \"Jones v. Van Zandt\" (1847), a case by which abolitionists intended to challenge the constitutionality of slavery. The case was decided by the United States Supreme Court against Van Zandt; it upheld the right of Congress and the obligation of the government to protect slavery, as it was established under the Constitution. Van Zandt was ruined financially by the decision and died later that year.\n\nWhile living in Evendale, Ohio, Van Zandt often illegally harbored slaves in the basement of his house and helped them escape to the North. In the 1840s, he was caught. He was excommunicated from the Sharon Methodist Episcopal Church, which had already joined the Southern portion of the national congregations, although he was a trustee and had helped found it. They judged his anti-slavery activities to be \"immoral and un-Christian conduct.\" Despite this, he continued to harbor slaves, but was caught again.\n\nVan Zandt was charged for monetary damages by Wharton Jones, a slaveholder who lost his property, in what became known as \"Jones v. Van Zandt\" (1847), which was settled by the US Supreme Court. Abolitionists pressed the case to challenge the constitutionality of slavery. Despite being defended by Salmon P. Chase, future Secretary of Treasury for Abraham Lincoln and Chief Justice of the United States from 1864-1873, Van Zandt was ruled against by the court. In a decision by Chase's predecessor, Chief Justice Roger B. Taney, the court determined that slavery was protected by the Constitution, and the federal government had the right and obligation to support it; thus the 1793 Fugitive Slave Law was constitutional. States could determine whether slavery would be legal within their borders. Through years of challenging his legal case, Van Zandt lost all his land and property. He had to place his eleven children with relatives across the country. He died later that year.\n\nHoping to settle the issue of slavery, Chief Justice Taney increased sectional tensions in the nation. In 1850 Southerners pushed through a new Fugitive Slave Act that required states to support enforcement and increased the penalties for those aiding escaped slaves. It also added to the tensions across the country.\n\nOn June 19, 2005, the Sharonville United Methodist Church (the pro-slavery Southern faction rejoined the mainline Methodist Church in the 20th century) attracted national press attention when it posthumously restored Van Zandt's membership. About a dozen Van Zandt descendants traveled to the city to accept a formal letter of apology by the church for the expulsion of their ancestor for his anti-slavery activities.\n\nVan Zandt was believed to have been the basis for the character of Van Trompe in Harriet Beecher Stowe's bestselling \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\" (1852), which helped rouse anti-slavery activists.\n"}

He is by far the best known son of Ramesses II, and his contributions to Egyptian society were remembered for centuries after his death. Khaemweset has been described as \"the first Egyptologist\" due to his efforts in identifying and restoring historic buildings, tombs and temples.\n\nAccording to historian Miriam Lichtheim:\n\nKhaemweset was the second son of Ramesses II and Queen Isetnofret. He was born during the reign of his grandfather Pharaoh Seti I and the fourth son overall. In about the 13th year of the reign of Seti I, crown-prince Ramesses put down a minor revolt in Nubia. Ramesses took his small sons Amunherwenemef and Khaemweset with him on this military campaign. Khaemweset may have been only 4 years old at this time. Khaemweset and his older brother are shown making a charge on the battle field in a chariot. The events were recorded in scenes in the temple at Beit el Wali.\n\nKhaemweset grew up with his brothers during a time of foreign conflict and he is present in scenes from the Battle of Kadesh, the siege of Qode (Naharin), and the siege of Dapur in Syria. In the battle of Kadesh scenes from year 5 of Ramesses II, Khaemweset is shown leading sons of the chiefs of Hatti before the gods. These princes were prisoners of war. In scenes depicting the battle of Qode, Khaemweset is shown both leading prisoners before his father and serving as an attendant of his father. In year 10 of Ramesses II Khaemweset is present during the battle of Dapur.\n\nAfter this initial period where Khaemweset may have had some military training, or at least was present at the battlefield, he became a Sem-Priest of Ptah in Memphis. This appointment occurred in c. Year 16 of Ramesses II's reign. He would have initially been a deputy to the High Priest of Ptah in Memphis named Huy. During his time as Sem-Priest Khaemweset was quite active in rituals, including the burial of several Apis bulls at the Serapeum. In year 16 of Ramesses, the Apis bull died and was buried in the Serapeum. Funerary gifts were presented by the High Priest of Ptah, Huy, Khaemweset himself, his brother Prince Ramesses, and Vizier Paser. The next burial took place in year 30 and at that time the gifts came from the chief of the treasury Suty and the Mayor of Memphis named Huy. After this second burial Khaemweset redesigned the Serapeum. He created an underground gallery where a series of burial chambers allowed for the burial of several Apis bulls.\n\nAround the 25th regnal year of his father, his older brother Ramesses became crown prince, and in the 30th year, Khaemweset's name started to appear in the announcements of the Sed festivals. These were traditionally held in Memphis, but some of the announcements were made in Upper Egypt at El Kab and Gebel el-Silsila. While he was a Sem priest, Khaemweset may have constructed and built additions to the temple of Ptah in Memphis. There are several inscriptions which attest to Khaemweset's activities in Memphis.\n\nKhaemweset restored the monuments of earlier kings and nobles. Restoration texts were found associated with the pyramid of Unas at Saqqara, the tomb of Shepseskaf called the Mastabat al-Fir’aun, the sun-Temple of Nyuserre Ini, the Pyramid of Sahure, the Pyramid of Djoser, and the Pyramid of Userkaf.\nInscriptions at the pyramid temple of Userkaf show Khaemweset with offering bearers, and at the pyramid temple of Sahure Khamwaset offers a statue of the goddess Bast.\n\nKhaemweset restored a statue of Prince Kawab, a son of King Khufu. The inscription on the throne reads:\n\nSome of these restorations took place during his later tenure as Sem priest. The work on the pyramid of Djoser is dated to year 36 of Ramesses II. Some of the inscriptions mention Khaemweset's title as \"Chief of the Artificers\" or \"Chief of Crafts\". Hence, some of these restorations were undertaken after his promotion as the High Priest of Ptah in Memphis about the 45th year of the reign of Ramesses II.\n\nKhaemweset held the position of Crown Prince to the throne between Year 50 and Year 55 of his father's reign when he died. He was succeeded in this position by his full brother Merneptah. He also served as Governor of Memphis.\n\nKhaemweset was the son of Ramesses II and Queen Isetnofret. He had at least two brothers: Prince Ramesses was his elder brother and Merneptah was his younger brother. Bintanath was his sister. These three siblings are depicted on the Aswan Rock stela with the Pharaoh and Queen shown with Khaemweset in another register. It is possible that Princess Isetnofret was a full sister of Khaemwaset as well, although it is equally possible she was only a half-sister.\n\nKhaemweset is known to have had two sons and a daughter. His eldest son, Ramesses, is mentioned on a block statue from Memphis. Ramesses holds the title \"King's Son\" on the statue, which here should be interpreted as King's grandson. On the Dorsal Pillar the text reads: \"[It is] his dear [son] who perpetuates his name - The King's Son, excellent in wisdom, upright in mind in every deed, great in his enlightenment at all times to maintain the offerings for his father, – the King's Son Ramesses, justified and venerated one.\"\n\nHis second son, Hori, became High Priest of Ptah at Memphis during the later part of the 19th Dynasty.\n\nKhaemweset is also known to have had a daughter named Isetnofret (also written as \"Isitnofret\"). Other women at court with that name include her grandmother Queen Isetnofret and her father’s sister. Khaemweset's daughter Isetnofret may have married her uncle, the pharaoh Merneptah. If so, she would be identical to Queen Isetnofret II. Isetnofret's tomb may have recently been found in Saqqara during excavations by Waseda University.\nNot much is known about Khaemweset's wife, though in the demotic story, Setna II, his wife bears the name Meheweskhe.\n\nOne grandson of his is known. His son Hori had a son who was also named Hori. This grandson of Khaemweset would later serve as Vizier of Egypt during the tumultuous period at the end of the Nineteenth Dynasty. He was still performing these duties under Ramesses III.\n\nWhilst first exploring the Serapeum of Saqqara between 1851 and 1853, French Egyptologist Auguste Mariette was confronted by a huge rock, which could only be moved by the use of explosives. Once the shattered remnants of the rock were removed, an intact coffin was discovered which contained the mummy of a man, accompanied by numerous funerary treasures. A gold mask covered his face, and amulets gave his name as Prince Khaemweset, son of Ramesses II and builder of the Serapeum. These remains have now been lost but Egyptologists believe that this was not the grave of Khaemweset and that the remains were those of an Apis Bull made into a human form to resemble the Prince.\n\nThe Egyptologist Aidan Dodson is quoted writing in his book \"Canopic Equipment from the Serapeum of Memphis\":\n\nDuring earlier excavations the Waseda University expedition found the remains of a monument which may have been Khaemweset's \"ka-house\". \nIn later periods of Egyptian history, Khaemweset was remembered as a wise man, and portrayed as the hero in a cycle of stories dating to the Hellenistic period. In these stories his name is Setne, a distortion of the real Khaemwaset's title as \"setem\"-priest of Ptah; modern scholars call this character \"Setne Khamwas\".\n\nThe first tale, dubbed \"Setne I\" or \"Setne Khamwas and Naneferkaptah\", describes how Khaemwaset seeks and finds a book of powerful magical spells, the \"Book of Thoth\", in the tomb of Prince Naneferkaptah. Against the wishes of Naneferkaptah's spirit, Khaemwaset takes the book and becomes cursed. Setne then meets a beautiful woman who seduces him into killing his children and humiliating himself in front of the pharaoh. He discovers that this episode was an illusion created by Neferkaptah, and in fear of further retribution, Setne returns the book to Neferkaptah's tomb. At Neferkaptah's request, Setne also finds the bodies of Neferkaptah's wife and son and buries them in Neferkaptah's tomb, which is then sealed.\n\nThe second tale is known as \"Setne II\" or the \"Tale of Setne Khamwas and Si-Osire\". Khaemwaset and his wife have a son named Si-Osire who turns out to be a highly skilled magician. In the first part of the story, Si-Osire brings his father to visit the Duat, the land of the dead, where they see the pleasant fate of the deceased spirits who lived justly and the torments inflicted on spirits who sinned during their lives. In the second part, it is revealed that Si-Osire is actually a famous magician from the time of Thutmose III who returned to save Egypt from a Nubian magician. After the confrontation, Si-Osire disappears, and Khaemwaset and his wife have a real son who is also named Si-Osire in honor of the magician.\n\n\n\n"}

He is currently Gore Hunger Professor of Environmental Science at the University of Tennessee and Editor-in-chief of the journal Biological Invasions.\n\nSimberloff was born in 1942 in Wilson Borough, Pennsylvania, a small town near the Delaware River. As a young child, he collected insects, especially beetles, pinning and preserving them in cigar boxes as early as four years old. In addition to his collection of insects, Simberloff also caught and kept salamanders and musk turtles in a basin in his home. He cites being influenced by his uncle, who was a chemist. Consequently, he received science books and was taken to science lectures throughout his youth. He moved to New York City at age 11. Simberloff recalls really enjoying all school subjects, math in particular, despite the substandard teaching of the large underfunded city schools. He excelled in everything academic.\n\nSimberloff received his A.B. from Harvard College in 1964, and later received his Ph.D. in Biology from Harvard University in 1969. He wanted to go to grad school for mathematics, but changed his mind after taking a major biology course from future Nobel Prize winner, George Wald, as an undergrad. This led to his introduction to E. O. Wilson. Simberloff became Wilson’s grad student, which began his career in ecology.\n\nWhen Dan Simberloff came to ecology, it was in the throes of a revolution that sped its transition from what was mainly a point of view to the rigorous science it has become. (A more complete discussion of this transition may be found under heading, \"20th century transition to modern ecology,\" in the page on the history of ecology and other publications.). Simberloff's doctoral dissertation tested the theory of island biogeography proposed by MacArthur and Wilson, resulting in a paper that won the Mercer Award in 1971. and was included as one of forty classic papers that represented the foundations of ecology. As he read the literature in ecology, he began to be concerned that most mathematical models \"more or less fit some data but had no reason to be the preferred explanation. He showed that a random draw could explain some patterns having to do with island biota. Meanwhile, a number of biologists, Jared Diamond the most eloquent of them, began calling for island biogeography theory to be applied in conservation. This became a controversy in ecology known as SLOSS. In his 1976 \"Science\" paper, Simberloff contradicted his own theory, claiming that most of the insect turnover in the assemblages studied was ephemeral and did not, therefore, confirm island biogeography theory in general. In fact, two smaller areas could mathematically support more species than a single area of the same size, and he had experimental data from his some mangrove studies to support it. A leading exponent of the theory now writes that “the species-area curve is a blunt tool in many contexts” and “now seems simplistic to the point of being cartoonish” when it comes to management of nature preserves. There are more urgent concerns facing conservation biology than SLOSS.\n\nImmediately on the heals of and related to the controversy of island biogeography theory, Simberloff took on the MacArthurian paradigm of competitively structured communities, championing the use of null models in community ecology. Debate on the subject in the ecological literature became so heated that it inspired the name of \"Tallassee mafia\" for Simberloff and his associates at Florida State University. Its high points were a set of papers in a philosophical journal, an entire issue of \"The American Naturalist\", and a published symposium at Wakulla Springs, Florida, that changed the face of the field. Simberloff caused ecologists to question, “what would happen if one mechanism were removed?” He preached, “rely on the data to tell you how nature operates; don’t simply find the patterns that you’re supposed to find.” The Ecological Society of America in conferring him its 2006 Eminent Ecologist Award for his \"outstanding body of ecological work\" and \"contributions of extraordinary merit,\" citing him in particular for having been \"the quintessential ecological iconoclast.\"\n\nSimberloff was instrumental in making the presidential Executive order 13112 on invasive species, and he also serves on the IUCN Invasive Species Specialist Group and the IUCN Species Survival Commission. He has served on the Board of Governors of the Nature Conservancy, the federal Invasive Species Advisory Committee, and the editorial boards of Biodiversity and Conservation, Oecologia, Biological Invasions, BioScience and Ecology. Simberloff was a faculty member at Florida State University from 1968-1997 before relocating to the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. He is currently a distinguished professor there in the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology. He directs the University of Tennessee’s Institute for Biological Invasions. His more recent work focuses on the presence of invasive species, and raises the “specter of ‘invasional meltdown’”. At present, Simberloff has a long-term project in Patagonia on the invasion of conifer trees, involving introduced deer, boar, and fungi. Simberloff has a total of over 350 publications, and he is currently working on several papers on invasive biology.\n\nThe series of projects on insect communities on small mangrove islands, which started with his doctoral dissertation, was Simberloff's earliest major contribution to the field of ecology.\nSimberloff is also recognized for a long series of papers on different statistical analyses of patterns and what they can tell us about underlying ecological mechanisms, especially which species are where, and the different sizes of coexisting species. This includes the work with Tamar Dayan on character displacement and on assembly rules and species combinations with Ed Connor and Michael Collins. This research caused a major shift in how researchers analyze pattern data.\nSimberloff is currently engaged in a set of ongoing research projects in Patagonia on conifer invasions.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2181668", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2181668", "title": "Bactris", "text": "Bactris\n\nBactris is a genus of spiny palms which is native to the Mexico, South and Central America and the Caribbean. Most species are small trees about tall, but some are large trees while others are shrubs with subterranean stems. They have simple or pinnately compound leaves and yellow, orange, red or purple-black fruit. The genus is most closely related to several other spiny palms—\"Acrocomia\", \"Aiphanes\", \"Astrocaryum\" and \"Desmoncus\". The fruit of several species is edible, most notably \"B. gasipaes\", while others are used medicinally or for construction.\n\nThe ancestors of the genus are believed to have entered South America during the late Cretaceous. William Baker and Thomas Couvreur found \"Bactris\" to be one of six palm genera that showed the highest rates of speciation.\n\nBoth stems and leaves of \"Bactris\" species are generally covered with spines. Stems generally bear spines on the internodes; in \"B. glaucescens\" and \"B. setulosa\" spines are also present on the nodes. A few species lack spines on their stems. All species have spiny leaves; the spines are often clustered on the petiole or rachis. In some species the spines are only found on the tips of the leaflets. Most species grow in multi-stemmed clumps with stems about tall and in diameter, but they span a range of sizes from tall trees to shrubs with subterranean stems and are sometimes single-stemmed. Stems can be as narrow as in \"B.aubletiana\" or as broad as in \"B. gasipaes\".\n\nThe leaves can be either pinnately compound or simple; in some species like \"B. hirta\" both types of leaves exist. Petioles range from to over in length, while the rachis (which bears the leaflets) can be to over long. Inflorescences are borne singly emerging from the leaf axil. Flowers grow in triplets along the inflorescence; each female flower is flanked by two male flowers; elsewhere along the inflorescence male flowers grow singly or in pairs. Ripe fruit can be yellow, orange, red or purple-black (other colours are present in a few species) and range from long.\n\n\"Bactris\" is placed in the subfamily Arecoideae, the tribe Cocoseae and the subtribe Bactridinae, together with the genera \"Acrocomia\", \"Aiphanes\", \"Astrocaryum\" and \"Desmoncus\". Phylogenetic studies support the monophyly of both the subtribe Bactridinae and the genus \"Bactris\", but differ in terms of how the genera within the subtribe are related to one-another.\n\nThe first species were attributed to the genus by Nikolaus Joseph von Jacquin in 1763, but a formal description of the genus was only published in 1777 by Giovanni Antonio Scopoli. Later workers split \"Bactris\" into several genera (\"Guilielma\", \"Augustinea\", \"Pyrenoglyphis\", \"Amylocarpus\" and \"Yuyba\") and described several hundred species. Although earlier authors recognised between 239 and 257 species of \"Bactris\", Andrew Henderson accepted 73 species and a single genus in his 2000 monograph, while as of 2013 The Plant List included 79 accepted species.\n\nHenderson recognised six informal groups within the genus, but used them only for convenience and did not consider them monophyletic groups. These groups were (1) the \"Amylocarpus\" group, (2) the \"Guilielma\" group, (3) the Orange-fruited group, (4) the \"Piranga\" group, (5) the Purple-fruited group, and (6) the \"Pyrenoglyphis\" group. In their study of the Bactridinae, Wolf Eiserhardt and colleagues sampled 13 species of \"Bactris\" distributed among these six groups; five of these groups were represented by more than one species in their sample. Of these five, only the \"Guilielma\" group was potentially monophyletic (although support for this conclusion was weak). The other four were found to be either polyphyletic or paraphyletic (although here again, support was only strong for two of the four). The sixth group, the Orange-fruited group, was only represented by a single species in their data set.\n\n\nThe subfamily Arecoideae is believed to have evolved in North America about 78 million years ago, and colonised South America during the late Cretaceous before going extinct in North America. The subtribe Bactridinae evolved between 54 and 35 million years ago, The ancestors of \"Bactris\" diverged from those of \"Astroacryum\" between 26 and 36 million years ago. In their analysis of speciation within the palm family, William Baker and Thomas Couvreur found \"Bactris\" to be one of six palm genera that showed the highest rates of speciation.\n\nThe genus ranges from Mexico, through Central America and the Caribbean and across much of tropical South America. Diversity is highest in the Amazonian region. Most of the species in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest are endemic to the region. Three species (\"B. cubensis\", \"B. jamaicana\" and \"B. plumeriana\") are restricted to the Caribbean and form a closely related clade.\n\n\"Bactris gasipaes\", the peyibaye or peach palm, was domesticated in pre-Columbian times and is cultivated for its starchy fruit and palm heart throughout the Neotropics, especially in Brazil, Colombia, Peru and Costa Rica. Other species used for food include \"B. brongniartii\", \"B. campestris\", \"B. concinna\" and \"B. major\". \"Bactris acanthophora\" and \"B. campestris\" are used medicinally, while \"B. barronis\", \"B. pilosa\" and \"B. setulosa\" are used in construction.\n"}

His own son Bernhard von Bülow was also a German statesman and chancellor. He studied law at the universities of Berlin, Göttingen and Kiel, and began his political career in the service of Denmark, in the chancery of Schleswig-Holstein-Lauenburg at Copenhagen, and afterwards in the foreign office. In 1842 he became councillor of legation, and in 1847 Danish \"charge d'affaires\" in the Hanse towns, where his intercourse with the merchant princes led to his marriage in 1848 with a wealthy heiress, Louise Victorine Rücker. Their children included Bernhard, Adolf, Alfred and Waldemar (died age 2).\n\nWhen the insurrection broke out in the Elbe duchies (1848) he left the Danish service, and offered his services to the provisional government of Kiel, an offer that was not accepted. In 1849, accordingly, he re-entered the service of Denmark, was appointed a royal chamberlain and in 1850 sent to represent the duchies of Schleswig and Holstein at the restored federal diet of Frankfurt. Here he came into intimate touch with Bismarck, who admired his statesmanlike handling of the growing complications of the Schleswig-Holstein Question. With the radical Eider-Dane party he was utterly out of sympathy; and when, in 1862, this party gained the upper hand, he was recalled from Frankfurt. He now entered the service of the Grand-duke of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, and remained at the head of the grand-ducal government until 1867, when he became plenipotentiary for the two Mecklenburg duchies in the council of the German Confederation (Bundesrat), where he distinguished himself by his successful defence of the medieval constitution of the duchies against Liberal attacks.\n\nIn 1873 Bismarck, who was in thorough sympathy with his views, persuaded him to enter the service of Prussia as secretary of state for foreign affairs, and from this time until his death he was the chancellor's most faithful henchman. In 1875, he was appointed Prussian plenipotentiary in the Bundesrat; in 1877 he became Bismarck's lieutenant in the secretaryship for foreign affairs of the Empire; and in 1878 he was, with Bismarck and Hohenlohe, Prussian plenipotentiary at the congress of Berlin. He died at Frankfurt on 20 October 1879, his end being hastened by his exertions in connection with the political crisis of that year. Of his six sons the eldest, Bernhard Heinrich Karl, became chancellor of the Empire.\n\n"}

The school bus, driven by a substitute driver, was stopped at a traffic light with the rearmost portion extending onto a portion of the railroad tracks when it was struck by a Metra Union Pacific / Northwest Line train en route to Chicago.\n\nThe crash involved a signalled rail crossing located very near a highway intersection which was regulated by traffic signals. The devices were connected and operations were supposed to be carefully timed and coordinated. Such locations are known as \"interconnected crossings\" within the industries. Highway and railroad officials had each received numerous complaints from the public about the insufficient timing of the warnings provided by the signals in the year prior to the crash, and citizens later told of situations with vehicles unable to clear the tracks in a timely manner.\n\nThe National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigation found that, while the bus driver was not aware that a portion of the bus was on the tracks as she should have been, the timing of signals was so insufficient that, even if she had identified the hazard as the train approached, she would have had to proceed against a red traffic signal into the highway intersection to have moved out of the train's path.\n\nLegislation and re-engineering of interconnected crossings across the state of Illinois combined with greater awareness elsewhere resulted in efforts to help to prevent similar crashes from recurring. Informational decals were also added to Illinois school buses advising drivers of the length of each bus, since the substitute school bus driver was apparently unaware of the exact length of the bus she was driving. Other states have also embraced that and related aspects and incorporated them into their school bus driver training curriculum.\n\nThe Fox River Grove crash stands as the worst crash involving a Metra train in its history, and one of the worst grade crossing crashes in U.S. history. At the crash site, the improved signaling system installed after the crash now protects the passing trains and motor vehicle traffic. Nearby is a small memorial to the seven high school students killed in the crash.\n\nOn October 25, 1995, at 7:10 am CDT, Metra train number 624, traveling approximately 60 mph (96 km/h) at the time of impact, collided with the back of a school bus carrying students to Cary-Grove High School at the intersection of Algonquin Road, Northwest Highway (U.S. Route 14), and a double-tracked mainline belonging to the Union Pacific Railroad. The impact separated the body from the chassis of the bus and catapulted the wreckage into the intersection. Five students were instantly killed and two later died from their injuries. Another 21 were injured, some critically. Most victims suffered blunt trauma and head injuries. The most seriously injured suffered skull fractures, lacerations and internal injuries.\n\nMetra 624 was in push mode, which meant the engineer was in a specially designed cab car, equipped with a control panel at its end, for the engineer to drive the train from this car, while the power was coming from the locomotive, set in reverse, at the other end, pushing the train. The reason for this mode of operation is that most commuter rail lines lack \"balloon tracks\" for trains to turn around 180 degrees, named for their shape of a balloon when viewed from the air. Because of this, trains cannot turn around to put the locomotive at the front in both directions. The cab car at the head end of 624 at the time of the collision was Metra car no. 8751. The train consisted of 6 standard bi-level passenger cars and the cab car, totaling 7 cars, with the locomotive at the back. The locomotive believed to have been pushing the train at the time was Metra EMD F40PH-3 number 148, named \"Village of Fox Lake\", although the locomotive number was not identified in accident/incident reports from the bus collision. Train 624 was scheduled to depart Crystal Lake Station at 7:00 am, which it departed on time, bound for Chicago. 624, in particular, was affectionately known as the \"Flyer\", because it skipped most stations along the way, with an authorized speed limit of . Metra 624 struck the bus at 7:10 am, roughly 10 minutes after departure.\n\nAll times are approximate, given in the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) report as the best approximation of when the events occurred as a result of their investigation. All times are given in Central Daylight Time.\n\nThe initial cause of the crash was the failure of the bus driver, Patricia Catencamp, to properly judge the distance between the railroad tracks when the vehicle stopped at a traffic signal across the tracks. The failure of judgment meant that around of the back end of the bus protruded over the nearest rail. The body of the Metra train protruded past the rail. All of the injuries were sustained during this initial impact.\n\nThe crossing was of inherently dangerous design, in that a long vehicle could be partially trapped on the crossing while held by a red light at the intersection. If the driver had realized the danger, she would still have been forced to pull through a red light to clear the track when the warning bells sounded.\n\nChildren began joking that Catencamp was oblivious to the fact that a crossing gate lowered on the bus, then began screaming for her to move forward. She did not understand their message and diverted her attention away from the traffic signal. NTSB concluded the traffic signal did turn green 6 seconds before impact, but Catencamp was distracted trying to attend to what she presumed was some crisis within the bus.\n\nAs with most transportation crashes, there were other conditions present that created an environment in which this type of collision could occur. These causes take root in the history of the road, the railroad, and the crossing.\n\nPrior to the early 1990s, the Northwest Highway ran as a two-lane road (one lane in each direction) parallel to the former Chicago & North Western rail line (Union Pacific Railroad after April 1995). The distance between the road and the railroad is relatively constant in the state—roughly 60 feet (18.2 meters), assuming a two-lane road and impediment-free alignment. This distance was more than enough to hold a 40-foot (12.2 meter) bus.\n\nWhen the Illinois Department of Transportation (IDOT) reconstructed the highway to encourage development in the area and limit congestion, three lanes were added to the road to create a four-lane highway with turn lanes at the intersection. To limit the impact of the road expansion to businesses on the northern side of the highway, IDOT reduced the distance between the road and the railroad from 60 feet to around 30 feet (9.1 meters). They also erected a modernized traffic signal to ensure traffic cleared the crossing in front of an approaching train. These actions increased the chances of a train impacting a school bus, but were not leading causes.\n\nThe type of crossing where the crash occurred is known as an \"interconnected\" crossing because of the need to link the railroad signals to the road signals to ensure safe passage. On this particular route, bus drivers on Algonquin Road had been known to cross the tracks to stop at the line at Northwest Highway, leaving them vulnerable to passing trains if they happened to still be stopped when the gates lowered. In addition, vehicle sensors were only present on the north side of the railroad tracks. Buses, trucks and other large vehicles were forced to pull through the railroad crossing in order to activate the signals at the intersection.\n\nAccording to tests conducted by the National Transportation Safety Board, the warning lights on the railroad crossing activated 20 seconds before the arrival of the Metra train. However, the traffic light clearing the rail intersection only allowed cars to clear 18 seconds after the railway signals activated, giving vehicles only 2 to 6 seconds to clear the tracks. Roadway signal timing was under the jurisdiction of IDOT, while railway timing was under the jurisdiction of Union Pacific. No communication took place between both parties with regards to interconnected signal timing.\n\nIt was reported that the road signals had originally given a safe margin, but had been modified some months previously to allow a pedestrian crossing cycle, overlooking the possible consequences at the railroad crossing. The traffic signal would rest in the \"WALK\" indication for pedestrians during the morning commute period. When a train is detected, the pedestrian interval must be ended. This process used up 12 seconds of warning time as the train approached. Pedestrian volumes at this crosswalk were extremely light, according to a survey conducted by the Village of Fox River Grove in May 1996. IDOT traffic engineers responsible for establishing signal timings should have recognized that in this particular case, resting in \"WALK\" carries substantial risk and virtually no benefit, and should not have allowed the traffic signal to rest in the pedestrian \"WALK\" interval. If the traffic signals had not been serving the non-existent pedestrian, the bus would have had a green light 12 seconds earlier than it did, and the collision would almost certainly have been avoided.\n\nIn addition, the thumbwheel setting on the crossing processor was reduced to 25 seconds from 30 seconds two weeks before the crash. Union Pacific officials stated that the new value was still above the minimum constant warning time of 20 seconds.\n\nThe National Transportation Safety Board issued 29 distinct recommendations to 17 distinct parties in the aftermath of the crash. These recommendations are summarized as follows:\n\nTo the U.S. Secretary of Transportation: Develop a safety inspection program for railroad crossings that involve other public entities (schools and other state departments). Notify, in cooperation with AASHTO, other agencies about the importance of exchanging information about railroad/highway crossings. Develop a common glossary of railroad/highway crossing terms and distribute to railroad and public entities. Develop a training program specifically regarding interconnected crossings. Require recording devices on all interconnected crossings in the future, and require their usage when both railroad and joint maintenance is done on the crossing. Upgrade existing recording devices to fulfill the previous condition.\n\nTo the Federal Highway Administration: Develop a way to visually show on pavement where a train and/or its cargo may be to assist drivers in determining their safe distance from the crossing. Develop, with the cooperation of National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and Operation Lifesaver, educational materials to inform motorists of how a train and/or its cargo can occupy a crossing. Review the national Highway-Rail Crossing inventory with the Federal Railroad Administration to ensure that it meets the needs of highway users as well.\n\nTo the Federal Railroad Administration: Update the national Highway-Rail Crossing inventory. Include, at a minimum, grade crossings having pre-emptive or interconnected signals.\n\nTo the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration: Determine what effect sound attenuation materials in buses have on the ability of the bus driver to discern both internal and external audible warnings.\n\nTo the Illinois Department of Transportation: Review all interconnected crossings in Illinois, and ensure that vehicles at all of these crossings have enough space or time to clear the crossing when a train approaches. Train subcontractors to ensure they have proper knowledge of all working interconnected systems.\n\nTo the Transportation Joint School District 47/155: Develop a program to identify possible hazards on all bus routes. Review the information with both regular and substitute bus drivers regularly.\n\nTo the National Association of State Directors of Pupil Transportation Services: Advise their members of the accident and its circumstances. Develop programs for the identification of hazards on bus routes. Develop guidelines for the appropriate placement of radios on school buses. When establishing bus routes, consider unusual operating characteristics or grade crossing accident histories. Advise members to disable radio speakers located next to drivers' heads.\n\nIn addition, the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials, National Association of County Engineers, American Public Works Association, Institute of Transportation Engineers, Association of American Railroads, American Short Line Railroad Association and American Public Transit Association were all advised to notify their members of the circumstances of the crash, and distribute information on the importance of exchanging information about railroad/highway grade crossings.\n\nIn the state of Illinois alone, 188 other interconnected crossings were inspected for hazardous conditions. Of these, 24 had similar problems, and were repaired.\n\nNew route designs brought the number of routes crossing railroad tracks in the District 47 and District 155 school systems down from 70% in 1996 to 10% in 1997.\n\nLawsuits were filed the month after the crash, and the last of these was resolved in January 2004. A total of $27.3 million was paid to the victims; of this amount, the school district paid $16.26 million, as school districts are held responsible for the actions of their drivers. The Union Pacific Railroad and Metra paid $7 million. Engineering contractors and the Illinois Department of Transportation settled for $3.2 million and $750,000, respectively.\n\nA large granite memorial and two plaques were placed in memory of the seven students killed in the crash near the site, honoring the deceased: Jeffrey J. Clark (17 years old), Michael B. Hoffman (14), Joseph A. Kalte (16), Shawn P. Robinson (14), Tiffany Schneider (15), Stephanie Fulham (15) and Susanna Guzman (18).\n\nThe Fox River Grove Public Library was renamed the Fox River Grove Memorial Library which includes an outdoor memorial seating area with the names of the seven students.\n\nA memorial outside the high school the bus was headed to was added.\n\n\n"}

While she was best known internationally as a jazz singer, Babs also competed as Sweden's first annual competition entrant in the Eurovision Song Contest 1958. In 1972 she was named Sweden's Royal Court Singer, the first non-opera singer as such.\n\nAfter making her breakthrough in the film \"Swing it magistern\" ('Swing It, Teacher!', 1940), she appeared in more than a dozen Swedish-language films. Despite being cast as the well-behaved, good-hearted, cheerful girl, the youth culture forming with Babs as its icon caused outrage among members of the older generation. A vicar called the Babs cult the \"foot and mouth disease of cultural life\".\n\nA long and productive period of collaboration with Duke Ellington began in 1963. Among other works, Babs participated in performances of Ellington's second and third Sacred Concerts which he had written originally for her.

{"id": "2181707", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2181707", "title": "Connecticut State Capitol", "text": "Connecticut State Capitol\n\nThe Connecticut State Capitol is located north of Capitol Avenue and south of Bushnell Park in Hartford, the capital of Connecticut. The building houses the Connecticut General Assembly; the upper house, the State Senate, and lower house, the House of Representatives, as well as the office of the Governor of the State of Connecticut. The Connecticut Supreme Court (built 1908–1910) occupies a building across Capitol Avenue.\n\nThe current building is the third capitol building for the State of Connecticut since the American Revolution.\n\nThe General Assembly of Connecticut (state legislature) met alternately in Hartford and New Haven since before the American Revolution. When in Hartford, the General Assembly met in the Old State House, designed in 1792 by Charles Bulfinch, and when sitting in New Haven, in a State House designed in 1827 by Ithiel Town. After the Civil War, the complications of this plan began to be evident, and both Hartford and New Haven competed to be sole state capital. Hartford won, and the new sole capital needed one central capitol building. The General Assembly authorized a million dollar project, and two competitors, James G. Batterson and Richard M. Upjohn, vied to be awarded the project. Upjohn won, but Batterson, a stone importer and merchant and not an architect, was named the building contractor. Batterson then continually revised the Upjohn plan to more and more closely resemble his own plan. The central tower, for example, is Batterson's, not Upjohn's. Batterson's extensive elaboration of Upjohn's plan ended up more than doubling the cost to over $2,500,000. \n\nRichard M. Upjohn's design is in the Eastlake style, with French and Gothic Revival styled elements. Construction of the building began in 1871. The building was completed in 1878, and it opened for the session of the General Assembly of Connecticut in January 1879. \"The New York Times\" described the newly constructed building: \"a vast mass of white marble (is) this imposing structure, and in the dazzling sunshine of a New-England Summer noon sparkles like a fairy palace of frost work.\"\n\nThe site of the Capitol was chosen since it is adjacent to Bushnell Park and had access to more surrounding open space than the older building in the immediate downtown. The site was originally the location of the old Trinity College and was then known as \"Trinity Hill\", and the city street to the immediate east is still named Trinity Street. (Trinity College relocated to a new campus south of the downtown.)\n\nSome galleries on the building's main floor hold historical artifacts, principally battle standards of Civil War units. The flags were deposited with the state by 10,000 of the state's veterans, who formed a procession to the Capitol, and deposited 30 regimental flags on September 17, 1879. This action was taken to make the building a memorial to the Civil War.\n\nThe building suffered some crowding of offices, and the introduction of partition walls and other temporary expedients which detracted from the plan of the building up to 1979 and 1989 when efforts began at restoration.\n\nThe State Capitol was designated as a National Historic Landmark in 1971.\n\nThe building is one of the largest Eastlake style buildings. The exterior is of marble from East Canaan, Connecticut and granite from Westerly, Rhode Island. The building is roughly rectangular, the interior spaces organized around two open interior courts that run vertically to large skylights. In the center is a third circular open rotunda beneath the dome. The larger hall of the House of Representatives forms an extension on the south side.\n\nThe building's ornately decorated facades display statuary and include several statues, medallions and carved tympana over the doors (except the west, which only has statues). The statues are of politicians and other people important to the state's history, such as: the Reverend Thomas Hooker (1586–1647), Major John Mason (1600–1672), Governor John Winthrop, Jr. (1605/1606–1676), Roger Sherman (1721–1793), Revolutionary War Governor Jonathan Trumbull (1710–1785), Noah Webster (1758–1843), General Joseph Hawley (1826–1905), Civil War Secretary of the Navy Gideon Welles (1802–1878), and United States Senator Orville Hitchcock Platt (1827–1905). There are 24 niches for sculpture, eight of which are still empty. The last one added was that of Ella T. Grasso (b. 1919), the first female governor of the state, who died in 1981 of cancer shortly after resigning her office.\n\nThere are high relief scenes from the state's history in the 16 tympana above the doors, except for the carving above the main north door, which is of the state seal. The typanum of the main east door holds \"The Charter Oak\" by Charles Salewski, the first piece of sculpture created for the Capitol. The interior floors used white marble and red slate from Connecticut, and some of the colored marble is from Italy.\n\nThe statues, medallions, and tympana are grouped by period. The north facade has six statues, five tympana, and two medallions, and the carvings are of pre-Revolutionary War figures. The east and west facades contain people from the Revolutionary War or government service, and the south facade's figures are from the Civil War and onwards.\n\nThe central domed tower is distinctive. The dome itself is tall; on top of that is a cupola in height, and the drum below is , making the drum taller than the height of the main walls. The overall height of the tower is .\n\nThe building's dome originally had a large statue on top, named \"The Genius of Connecticut\", which was taken down in 1938 after being damaged in the great hurricane of that year. The statue was cast in bronze from a plaster original, and was tall, and weighed . It was executed in Rome and was cast in Munich, Germany. During World War II, the piece was donated to the federal government and melted down as part of the war effort to make ammunition and machine parts. The original plaster statue is now at the capitol, and has been coated in bronze. In 2002, Proposed Bill No. 5273 before the General Assembly sought authorization to make a new casting of the statue to restore the design for the capitol dome. The project finally passed in 2009, and a new bronze cast has been made. It has not yet been mounted on the summit of the dome, awaiting an additional $200,000 in funding.\n\nAt the exterior base of the dome are 12 statues in six pairs representing Agriculture, Commerce, Education/Law, Force/War, Science/Justice, and Music.\n\nThe interior has two matching ornate open stairwells and all of the building interior is painted in a multi-colored scheme continuing the 1870s Eastlake design aesthetic throughout.\n\nThe Capitol Building is open to the public, with self-guided and guided tours available on weekdays. Guided tours begin inside the West Entrance of the Legislative Office Building.\n\n\n\n\n"}

He was drafted by the Indiana Pacers in 2005 after a two-year college stint at New Mexico. In 2009, Granger averaged 26 points per game on 45 percent shooting and was named an All-Star and the league's Most Improved Player. An injury to his left knee limited Granger to just five games during the 2012–13 season, and in February 2014, he was traded to the Philadelphia 76ers. He went on to play for the Los Angeles Clippers and Miami Heat before having short stints with the Phoenix Suns and Detroit Pistons in 2015.\n\nGranger attended Grace King High School in Metairie, Louisiana. A four-year letterman at Grace King, he averaged 24.3 points, 12 rebounds and 5.5 blocks per game as a senior. He was a McDonald's All-American nominee before his senior year. He scored a 30 on his ACT and was accepted to Yale University.\n\nGranger made the Missouri Valley Conference All-Freshman team for Bradley in 2001–02, averaging 11.1 points and 7.1 rebounds a game. He was a highly publicized transfer to New Mexico after the first semester of his sophomore season, having averaged 19.2 points and 7.9 rebounds for the Braves. He wasn't eligible to start playing for the Lobos until January 2004. He said the reason for the transfer was because of Braves head coach Jim Les's intimidating tactics, including being 'verbally abusive'.\n\nGranger averaged a career-best 19.5 points per game and also led the Lobos in rebounding (9.0 rpg), steals (1.32 spg) and blocks (1.41 bpg) as a junior in 2003–04. He became the first Lobos player to lead the team in all those categories in the same season and was awarded the Bob King Team MVP Award. He also became just the second Lobo in 33 years, and the fifth all-time, to average more than 19 points and nine rebounds for an entire season, joining Luc Longley, Willie Long, Mel Daniels and Ira Harge. A First Team All-Mountain West Conference selection, Granger was twice named the league's Player of the Week for the weeks ending December 22 and January 25.\n\nAs a senior in 2004–05, Granger was the only player in the NCAA to average at least 18.8 points and 8.9 rebounds per game, while also averaging at least 2.0 blocks (2.1), 2.0 steals (2.0) and 2.0 assists (2.0). He led the team in scoring, rebounding, steals and blocked shots for the second year in a row. He became the first player in school history to record 60+ assists, blocks and steals in a season. In 52 games, he registered 91 career blocked shots, ranking sixth all-time in New Mexico history. He fell just six points short of 1,000 in his New Mexico career, and for the second year in a row, he was given the Bob King Team MVP Award. He was named the MWC Tournament MVP and earned First Team All-Mountain West honors for the second straight year.

Bonanza then merged with Pacific Air Lines and West Coast Airlines to form Air West which in 1968 was continuing to serve Page with daily direct F-27 flights to Phoenix via stops at the Grand Canyon airport and Prescott as well as direct to Salt Lake City via Cedar City. Air West then changed its name to Hughes Airwest which in 1972 was operating daily direct F-27 service to Las Vegas via Grand Canyon airport and also direct to Salt Lake City via Cedar City on a daily basis. By 1975, Hughes Airwest had introduced direct F-27 service on the weekdays to Los Angeles International Airport via stops at Grand Canyon, Las Vegas and Palm Springs as well as continuing to operate direct service to Salt Lake City via Cedar City. In 1977, Hughes Airwest was flying non-stop F-27 service to Phoenix on a weekday basis in addition to the direct flight to Salt Lake City via Cedar City and had turned over the Las Vegas service to SkyWest Airlines which was operating Piper Navajo twin prop aircraft on the route with non-stop flights. Hughes Airwest then discontinued all service into the airport and was no longer serving Page by 1980.\n\nFollowing the cessation of service by Hughes Airwest, SkyWest Airlines, operating as an independent commuter air carrier, was providing non-stop service with Piper Navajo prop aircraft to Las Vegas and Phoenix. Scenic Airlines also flew nonstop service to Las Vegas on a seasonal basis during the late 1970s.

Following the acquisition of Western by Delta Air Lines on April 1, 1987, SkyWest began serving Page as a Delta Connection air carrier via a code sharing agreement with Delta with Fairchild Swearingen Metroliner propjets flying the same routes previously operated as Western Express. By 1995, SkyWest operating as the Delta Connection was operating three roundtrip non-stop flights a day with Metroliner aircraft between Page and Phoenix. In 1996 Great Lakes Airlines began serving the Page-Phoenix route with 19-seat Beechcraft 1900 commuter turboprops.

{"id": "2181732", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2181732", "title": "Balinese Room", "text": "Balinese Room\n\nThe Balinese Room was a famous nightclub in Galveston, Texas, United States built on a pier stretching 600 feet (183 m) from the Galveston Seawall over the waters of the Gulf of Mexico. For decades a dance hall and illegal casino, the Balinese Room was remodeled and reopened in 2001 without the gambling.\n\nOperated by Sicilian immigrant barbers-turned-bootleggers Sam and Rosario Maceo, the Balinese Room was an elite spot in the 1940s and 1950s (Galveston's \"open era\"), featuring entertainment by Frank Sinatra, Bob Hope, George Burns, The Marx Brothers and other top acts of the day.\nPatrons of the private club included Howard Hughes, Sophie Tucker and wealthy oil barons from nearby Houston.\n\nIn 1997, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. During the early morning hours of September 13, 2008, the structure was completely destroyed by Hurricane Ike.\n\nThe Balinese is featured in pop culture; Rock group ZZ Top wrote and performed a song about the club called, \"Balinese.\"\n\nThe Maceos took over \"Chop Suey,\" a small restaurant at the intersection of 21st Street and Seawall Boulevard, and in 1929 they opened \"Maceo's Grotto\" at that location. It was one of many entertainment venues that popped up along the Galveston Seawall around that time (along with bathhouses and dance clubs, some of which were illegal casinos). In 1932, the \"Grotto\" was remodeled into a Chinese restaurant called \"Sui Jen\" (pronounced Swee Rin), and a 200-foot pier stretching out over the Gulf was added to the building. The pier location, across 21st Street from the Galvez, made the restaurant/club an easy walk for those Galveston visitors who preferred to stay in one of the city's most exclusive hotels.\n\nThe Oriental-sounding name was changed to the more exotic sounding Balinese Room in 1942, after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, and the decor was modified accordingly. The pier was also expanded to 600 feet. The Balinese Room's private back room was equipped with the most modern gaming (gambling) equipment, and the Maceos' advertisements invited high rollers to \"Come Down and Play on Galveston Island.\"\n\nDuring this period it also became Balinese Room lore that head bartender Santos Cruz “invented” the Margarita for singer Peggy Lee in 1948. He supposedly named it after the Spanish version of her name, Margarita, and it's been a hit ever since. However, there is an account from 1936 of Iowa newspaper editor James Graham finding such a cocktail in Tijuana, years before any of the other margarita \"creation myths\".\n\nThe club's illegal gambling made it a hub of mob activity. It was well known that the casino, at the far end of the pier, was operating in violation of the law. But the Maceos had many allies in the local government and on the police force, so charges were never filed. The sheriff of Galveston County at the time, when called before the Texas Legislature to testify about why the club remained open, replied that he wasn't a member of the private club so he couldn't get in.\n\nIn 1956, Will Wilson was elected as Texas Attorney General after campaigning to \"close down Galveston\" and its illegal casinos using the Texas Rangers. The Rangers set up shop in a hotel near the club, and raided the casino often. But their efforts were thwarted by the length of the pier, known as the \"Rangers Run\". By the time they ran down to the tail end of the long, narrow club, tables, cards and chips had disappeared into secret wall and floor pockets. The band often would strike up the song \"The Eyes of Texas\" upon their arrival.\n\nAt first the Rangers attempted to disrupt the business without heavy-handed tactics – they simply sat in the casino all day, every day. Customers, intimidated by the Rangers' presence, were less frequent and business suffered. The club nevertheless stayed open. The Rangers finally launched an undercover operation. Ranger Clint Peoples managed to pose as a customer and was admitted to the club and witnessed the gambling. His work coordinated with a raid enabled the gambling equipment in the club to be seized. The club finally closed its doors on May 30, 1957.\n\nIn 1961, Hurricane Carla damaged the structure. Many of the piers that supported the structure had been washed away, and over following years, the building continued to decay.\n\nIn the 1970s the Balinese Room was purchased and reopened by oil tycoon Johnny Mitchell, who turned the casino into a dinner club and disco. Many celebrities appeared at the Club during these years. After Mitchell passed in 1996, the Balinese Room and its pier eventually became the property of the State of Texas. A local attorney, Scott Arnold, took out a 60-year lease on the pier, and in 2001, reopened the Balinese Room for business. In addition to the Balinese Room itself, which was used for live music, parties, and weekend public dining, the pier had a salon, retail shops and a massage therapy room with a glass floor.\nMuch of the original Balinese structure and decor had been either modified or destroyed over the years, but the South Seas interior decor of the large ballroom survived and was restored to match its 1940s appearance. The hallway of the long pier was lined with autographed photos of past performers and other memorabilia.\n\nAs Hurricane Ike approached Galveston on Friday, September 12, 2008, the storm surge raised the water level to a point where waves were occasionally topping the Galveston Seawall, sending water and debris onto Seawall Boulevard.\n\nLater that night and early Saturday morning, Hurricane Ike barreled ashore, with the eye of the storm tracking into Galveston Bay. Although the pier was higher than the seawall, Ike's storm surge, waves, and wind were more than the seventy-nine-year-old structure could handle. After having survived hurricanes Carla, Alicia, and numerous smaller storms, the famous old club was completely destroyed. Only plywood, rubble, metal and the famed red door were left after the hurricane passed through.\n\nThe Balinese Room is celebrated in a 1975 song by the band ZZ Top.\n\nThe 1989 film \"Night Game\" featured the Balinese Room as a filming location.\n\nThe 1993 film \"Dazed and Confused\" played an excerpt of the aforementioned ZZ Top song \"Balinese\".\n\n\n"}

He is currently the Chancellor's Professor at the UC Irvine School of Humanities’ Department of Comparative Literature.\n\nBorn in the state of Uttar Pradesh in India, Aijaz Ahmad and his parents migrated to Pakistan following partition. After his education he worked in various universities in US and Canada. Before joining UC Irvine in 2017, he was professorial fellow at the Centre of Contemporary Studies, Nehru Memorial Museum and Library, New Delhi and was visiting professor of political science at York University, Toronto. He also works as an editorial consultant with the Indian newsmagazine \"Frontline\" and as a senior news analyst for the Indian website Newsclick.\n\nIn his book \"In Theory: Classes, Nations, Literatures\", Ahmad primarily discusses the role of theory and theorists in the movement against colonialism and imperialism. Ahmad's argument against those who uphold poststructuralism and postmodernist conceptions of material history revolves around the fact that very little has been accomplished since the advent of this brand of postcolonial inquiry. The book contains an especially polemical critique of Frederic Jameson's argument in \"Third World Literature in the Era of Multinational Capitalism\" where Ahmad attacks Jameson on the grounds that Jameson's argument is insufficiently theorized in its use of terms like \"Third World\" which appears to be defined purely in terms of its experience of colonialism. This in turn leads Jameson to make hasty and untenable generalizations about how all \"third world literature\" would necessarily function as a national allegory that according to Jameson works as resistance to a system of global postmodernism.\n\nAhmad in his book expresses his chagrin at how his critique of Jameson has been appropriated by Postcolonial scholars as an attack on Marxism, while Ahmad contends that he takes issue with Jameson simply because his use of Marxism in the essay on Third World Literature is not rigorous enough. \nThe book also contains a lengthy critique of Edward Said's \"Orientalism\" which Ahmad argues reproduces the very liberal humanist tradition that it seeks to undermine in its selection of Western canonized texts that are critiqued for their Orientalism, as this upholds the idea that Western culture is represented in its entirety through those very texts. Furthermore, Ahmad asserts that by tracing Orientalist thought all the way back to Ancient Greece it becomes unclear in Said's work whether Orientalism is a product of Colonialism, or whether Colonialism is, in fact, a product of Orientalism.\n\n\nEdited\n\n"}

Following her mother's remarriage to Edward Bethel, she was known as Dawn Shirley Bethel.\n\nShe began dancing in USO shows during World War II at age ten. In 1948 she married Fred Bessire. She bore her first child at age 17 in 1949, and continued dancing in clubs under the stage name Shirley Mae Bessire. \n\nNorth made her film début as an uncredited extra in \"Excuse My Dust\" (1951). She was then spotted by a choreographer performing at the Macayo Club in Santa Monica, and was cast as a chorus girl in the film \"Here Come the Girls\" (1953), starring Bob Hope. Around that time, she adopted the stage name Sheree North. She made her Broadway début in the musical \"Hazel Flagg\", for which she won a Theatre World Award. She reprised her role in the film version, \"Living It Up\" (1954), starring Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis. In early 1954, at age 22, she appeared in a live TV version of Cole Porter's \"Anything Goes\" on \"The Colgate Comedy Hour\", with Ethel Merman, Frank Sinatra and Bert Lahr.\n\nIn 1954, North signed a four-year contract with 20th Century-Fox. The studio had big plans for her, hoping to groom her as a replacement for the studio's leading—and increasingly uncontrollable—female star Marilyn Monroe. Fox tested North for leading roles in two of their upcoming productions, \"The Girl in Pink Tights\" and \"There's No Business Like Show Business\"—two films that had been offered to Monroe—while North was wearing Monroe's own studio wardrobe. However, after her screen tests, North was not cast in either film. In March 1954, North had a brush with scandal when it was revealed that she had once danced in a bikini in an 8 mm erotic film. Fox capitalized on the publicity, as the studio previously had with Monroe's nude calendar posing in 1952.\n\nIn 1955 she was assigned the lead role opposite Betty Grable in \"How to Be Very, Very Popular\" (1955), a role that Marilyn Monroe had refused to accept. Media attention surrounding Monroe's suspension and North's hiring resulted in North appearing on the cover of \"Life\" magazine with the cover line \"Sheree North Takes Over from Marilyn Monroe.\" \"How to Be Very, Very Popular\" would eventually not live up to the hype Fox had generated, even though North had appeared on \"What's My Line?\" to publicize the film and had been asked point-blank by one of the panelists if she has been associated with Monroe. The movie received mixed reviews from critics and was a moderate box office success. Despite this, film historians, then and now, cite North's electrically-charged dancing to \"Shake, Rattle and Roll\" as the film's most memorable scene.\nIn an attempt to promote North, Fox studio executives lobbied to cast her in films surrounded with popular stars. The studio had campaigned to cast her in a film with comedian Tom Ewell, hoping to repeat the success he'd had with Monroe in \"The Seven Year Itch\" (1955). Soon thereafter, the studio assigned North and Ewell to appear together in the romantic comedy \"The Lieutenant Wore Skirts\", plotting the story of an army lieutenant whose husband tries to get her discharged. To promote the film, North posed for several publicity shots showing her legs. When the majority of the shots were released, only her legs appeared, with the tagline \"Believe it or not, these legs belong to an army lieutenant.\" The film premiered with much fanfare in January 1956, and became a box-office success, grossing over $4 million in the United States. \n\nNorth's follow-up was \"The Best Things in Life Are Free\" (1956), a lavish musical in which her singing voice was dubbed by Eileen Wilson. She received fourth billing under Gordon MacRae, Dan Dailey, and Ernest Borgnine. It was an attempt by the studio to broaden North's audience appeal, and while it earned favorable reviews from critics, it did not become the success Fox had hoped for. In 1956 Fox signed another blonde bombshell in the person of Broadway actress Jayne Mansfield to a contract, and began promoting her instead of North. Although Fox gradually lost interest in North, the studio continued to offer her a string of films. She was offered the lead role in a film called \"The Girl Upstairs\", in which she would have parodied Monroe's on-screen persona.\n\nWhen North's agent suggested she decline the film, Fox put her on suspension for two months. When her suspension was lifted one month later, North agreed to appear in \"The Way to the Gold\", but only on the assurance that Elvis Presley would be her co-star. When Presley withdrew due to salary disagreements, he was replaced with Jeffrey Hunter, with whom North often quarreled. In the film, North attempted to progress from her blonde bombshell image, playing a sarcastic waitress, and while the film drew mixed reviews, it was a box office success. \n\nShe next starred in \"No Down Payment\" (1957), a melodrama about the lives of multiple families living in a California subdivision. Tony Randall played her alcoholic husband in the film. Although critically acclaimed, it was not a box office success. The following year, she appeared in her final two films for Fox. \"In Love and War\" (1958) was a war drama film pairing her again with Jeffrey Hunter, and also with Robert Wagner, Dana Wynter, and Hope Lange. It was not a critical or financial success. Although the musical film genre had declined in profitability, she next co-starred in \"Mardi Gras\" (1958) with Pat Boone and Tommy Sands. It was her final film under her contract.\n\nAfter North's contract with Fox ended in 1958, her career stalled, although she continued to act in films, television, and on the stage throughout the rest of her life. She guest-starred on episodes of \"The Untouchables\" and \"Gunsmoke\" (both 1963). North joined the cast of \"I Can Get It for You Wholesale\" in 1962, which featured Elliott Gould and introduced Barbra Streisand. She later guest-starred on a series of popular television series, including \"Ben Casey\", \"Burke's Law\" (1963–65), \"The Virginian\" (1964–66), \"The Big Valley\", \"The Iron Horse\" (both 1966), and \"The Fugitive\" (1965–67).\n\nAfter an eight-year absence from film acting, North accepted a lead role in the B-movie science fiction film \"Destination Inner Space\" (1966). The film opened to only a minor release in 1966 and has rarely been seen since. North co-starred with Elvis Presley in one of his final films, \"The Trouble with Girls\" (1969). While not working in film, she worked in musical theater and many theatrical productions during her 40-year career. In 1965 she took over for Shirley Knight in a Los Angeles production of \"Dutchman,\" which coincided with the 1965 Watts riots. The production was controversial and was blamed by conservatives for inciting unrest. It was picketed, ads were blocked from the newspapers, and North's car was set on fire. Despite that, the production ran for a year. She had appeared on Broadway doing a lively routine in the musical Hazel Flagg (1953), consequently winning a Theatre World Award. This led directly to her being cast for the film, Living It Up (1954). In 1962, North appeared on Broadway as \"Martha Mills\" in I Can Get It for You Wholesale, with Jack Kruschen, Elliot Gould, and a young Barbara Streisand in her Broadway debut. North also appeared in productions of Irma La Douce, Bye Bye Birdie, and Can Can. \n\nFrom the 1960s onward, North focused mainly on becoming a solid and versatile character actress, appearing on almost every television western, cop show, and medical drama produced from the 1960s through the 1990s. She displayed a fine talent for comic timing on many of the situation comedies of the era. She was a favorite in several made-for-television movies. She also earned Emmy nominations for appearances on \"Marcus Welby, M.D.\" (1969) and \"Archie Bunker's Place\" (1979). \n\nA favorite of film producer/director Don Siegel, she appeared in four of his films: \"Madigan\" (1968) opposite [Richard Widmark; in \"Charley Varrick\" (1973) with Walter Matthau, as John Wayne's long-lost love in the actor's final film; in \"The Shootist\" (1976); and in \"Telefon\" (1977). She had supporting roles in two Charles Bronson movies, \"Breakout\" (1975) with Robert Duvall, and the aforementioned \"Telefon\". Other notable Sheree North performances are 1969's \"The Gypsy Moths\" with Burt Lancaster and Gene Hackman; as Burt Lancaster's ex-lover in director Michael Winner's 1971 western, \"Lawman\" with Robert Ryan, Lee J. Cobb, Robert Duvall, and Albert Salmi. She appeared in the 1971 crime drama \"The Organization\" with Sidney Poitier, and appeared in 1973's \"The Outfit\" with Duvall, Joe Don Baker, and Karen Black. \n\nThroughout the 1970s and 1980s, North appeared in guest spots on \"Hawaii Five-O\", \"The Streets of San Francisco\", \"McMillan & Wife\", \"Matlock\", \"Family\", and \"Magnum, P.I.\". She played Lou Grant's girlfriend on several episodes of \"The Mary Tyler Moore Show\". She co-starred with Sheldon Leonard in the short-lived CBS sitcom \"Big Eddie\" in 1975. During the 1980–81 season, North starred in \"I'm a Big Girl Now\" with Diana Canova, Danny Thomas, and Martin Short. The series aired 19 episodes. In 1980, she played Marilyn Monroe's mother in the made-for-television film \"\". In 1983, she appeared in the ensemble cast of the Steven Bochco series \"Bay City Blues\". The hour-long drama series aired eight episodes. North later appeared in two episodes of \"The Golden Girls\" as Blanche Devereaux's sister Virginia. In the 1990s, she appeared as Cosmo Kramer's mother Babs Kramer in two episodes of the sitcom \"Seinfeld\". North's last onscreen role came in John Landis' black comedy \"Susan's Plan\" (1998).\n\nNorth was married four times and had two children. In 1948, at age 16, she married Fred Bessire, a draftsman, with whom she had a daughter, Dawn (born 1949). The marriage ended in 1953. In 1955, she married television writer Bud Freeman, and the marriage ended a year later. Her third marriage was to psychologist Gerhardt Sommer, with whom she had another daughter, Erica Eve. The marriage ended in divorce in 1963. At the time of her death, North was married to her fourth husband, Emmy Award-winning Title Designer, Phillip \"Phill\" Norman.\n\nOn November 4, 2005, North died during cancer surgery at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. She was 73 years old.\n\n\nTheatre World Award\n\nEmmy Award\n\n"}

Their musical output includes pieces from traditional Irish music, Scottish music, and original tunes in both the Celtic and Celtic rock genres. The band had its first big break in 1997, appearing in the blockbuster film, \"Titanic\" and recording songs on the . Their most recent album, \"Go Climb A Tree\", was released on July 28, 2017.\n\nGaelic Storm's origins can be traced back to 1996, when Patrick Murphy and Steve Wehmeyer joined with Steve Twigger, drummer Shep Lonsdale, and Uillean piper Brian Walsh to perform at O'Brien's Irish Pub and Restaurant in Santa Monica, California, of which Murphy was the manager. Samantha Hunt joined them on fiddle. This led to a number of pub performances for the next year.\n\nIn 1997, Gaelic Storm appeared in the film \"Titanic\" as the steerage band, performing \"Blarney Pilgrim\" (Jig), \"John Ryan's Polka\", \"Kesh Jig\" and \"Drowsy Maggie\" (Reel). The first two were published on the second soundtrack album as \"An Irish Party in Third Class\". This appearance catapulted them into the touring scene; their performances were met with critical praise and popularity. On their second album \"Herding Cats\", the tunes \"Blarney Pilgrim\" and \"Drowsy Maggie\" are featured as \"Titanic Set (Medley)\". They have toured throughout the United States and Canada, in the United Kingdom, France and Japan.\n\nGaelic Storm continues to tour aggressively, playing over 125 days a year. The group has released 13 albums since its inception, including the compilation album \"Special Reserve\". The band is known for their energetic renditions of traditional Irish music and Scottish traditional music, and for their albums which consistently top the Billboard world music charts.\n\nGaelic Storm's fifth album, \"How Are We Getting Home?\", was released in August 2004 and debuted at #3 on the Billboard World Music Charts, #10 on the Billboard Heatseekers Chart, and re-entered the September 2005 World Albums Chart at #3.

Four buildings were used for this purpose, none of which exist today, making Ontario one of four provinces not to have an official vice-regal residence.\n\nThe colony's first Lieutenant Governor, John Graves Simcoe, occupied a couple of residences during his tenure. Upon his arrival in Upper Canada in 1792, he used one of the buildings at Navy Hall in Niagara-on-the-Lake as a residence, sharing the space with Upper Canada’s legislature. When Simcoe moved the colonial capital to York (present-day Toronto) in 1793, he built a summer residence, Castle Frank, north of the settlement in 1794. Simcoe's successor and the colony's second Lieutenant Governor, Peter Hunter, initially continued to reside in his own home, Russell Abbey, located at the south-west corner of Princess and Front streets.\n\nThe first official government house was a one-storey, U-shaped frame house built at Fort York in 1800, designed by Captain Robert Pilkington and first occupied by Hunter. The structure was destroyed when a nearby powder magazine exploded in 1813 during the War of 1812.\n\nAfter the destruction of the Fort York house, York did not have another Government House until after the War of 1812. In 1815, the government purchased Elmsley House, a more commodious Georgian residence, for its Lieutenant Governor. The new Government House was located in a wooded area to the west of the settled portion of the (then) Town of York, roughly midway on the block now occupied by Roy Thomson Hall and Metro Hall in downtown Toronto.\n\nBuilt in 1798, the residence had been the home of the Chief Justice and Speaker of the Legislative Assembly, John Elmsley, and it served as the colony's Government House from 1815 to 1841 (and intermittently from 1841 to 1858, during some of the times when Toronto served as the capital of the Province of Canada).\n\nFor many years after its purchase by the government, the residence was still known by the name of its former owner, with the correspondence of the Lieutenant Governor typically dated from \"Elmsley House\". In 1846, the grounds were used for the first annual Provincial Agricultural Fair.\n\nBeginning in 1849, Lord Elgin, the Governor General of the then united Province of Canada, resided for two years at the similarly-named Elmsley Villa, located near what is today the intersection of Bay and Grosvenor Streets (northwest corner), rather than at Elmsley House. Elmsley Villa was a two-storey Georgian structure that stood until at least the 1860s.\n\nElmsley House was destroyed by fire in 1862.\n\nFour years after the fire at Elmsley House, the firm of Gundry and Langley of Toronto was commissioned to design a new Government House on the same site.\n\nIn 1868, construction began on a new Government House, designed in the Second Empire style by architect Henry Langley. A three-storey red brick home, trimmed with Ohio cut stone, the building featured a tower, steeply sloped mansard roofs and dormer windows, with the main entrance and carriage porch facing Simcoe Street. The drawing room on the first floor and the state bedroom on the second floor faced Lake Ontario over a large landscaped garden. Completed in 1870, the house cost , and its first resident was John Beverley Robinson.\n\nBy the 20th century, the development of railways and industrial uses nearby prompted the provincial government to seek a more appropriate location for its vice-regal residence, as it had done more than a century before. The third Government House was sold to the Canadian Pacific Railway in 1912 and demolished in 1915.\n\nDuring the transition from the third to the fourth Government House, the Lieutenant Governor temporarily lived at Pendarves (later known as Cumberland House) from 1912 to 1915. Originally designed as an Italianate villa by Frederick William Cumberland for his family's use and completed in 1860, the house is located at 33 St. George Street. It has been owned since 1923 by the University of Toronto and now functions as the international students' centre.\n\nThe government sought to construct a new Government House on Bloor Street East, and twelve architects submitted proposals in 1909. However, as that area was becoming too commercial, the Province moved the site to a 0.06 km² (14 acre) parcel of secluded and undeveloped land in Toronto's Rosedale neighbourhood. The proceeds from the sale of the Bloor Street site were used to acquire the land in Rosedale.\n\nChorley Park, the fourth Government House, was constructed between 1911 and 1915. It was named for Chorley, Lancashire, the birthplace of Toronto alderman and first chair of Toronto Public Library John Hallam (1833-1900). The house was designed by architect Francis R. Heakes and built of Credit Valley stone in a French Renaissance style, reminiscent of French châteaux in the Loire Valley. It was one of the most expensive residences ever constructed in Canada at the time, and outshone even Rideau Hall in size and grandeur. Sir John Strathearn Hendrie and his wife were the first vice-regal couple to live at Chorley Park. The Prince of Wales, (later King Edward VIII) stayed here for three days in late August, 1919 on his cross Canada tour.\nDuring the Great Depression, Mitchell Hepburn made it a key component of his party's election platform to close Chorley Park, promising that an opulent palace would not be maintained by the taxpayers of Ontario; Chorley Park used 965 tons of coal to operate, whereas the average Toronto home used only six to seven. After Hepburn was appointed Premier, following the Liberal Party's victory in the 1937 provincial election, he ensured that Albert Edward Matthews would be the last Ontario Lieutenant Governor to live in an official residence; in 1937, after only 22 years and seven viceroys, Chorley Park was closed. The contents of the house were auctioned off in 1938, bringing in a profit of $18,000, and Ontario became the first province in Canada not to have a Government House. (Alberta also closed its government house in 1938.) The estate was bought by the federal government and served various functions including as a military hospital during World War II, the headquarters of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police in Toronto, and residence for refugees of the 1956 Hungarian uprising, including several of Imre Nagy's staff members.\n\nUnder mayor Nathan Phillips in 1960, the City of Toronto bought the house for $100,000 in order to destroy it and create municipal parkland. At the time, Chorley Park was considered dilapidated and outmoded, and municipal funds were being spent demolishing heritage structures throughout Toronto to make room for modern buildings. The building was demolished in 1961, and the grounds of the estate were added to the civic parks system.\nThe only trace of Government House left is the bridge to the forecourt, and some depressions in the earth that outline the rough footprint of its foundations. The once formal gardens have long gone fallow and today Chorley Park is a 'naturalized' park.\n\nOntario's Lieutenant Governor uses an office and suite of rooms for entertainment in the Ontario Legislative Building, and lives in his or her private Toronto home or is provided a rented residence by the provincial government. Since the closure of the last Government House, whenever the Sovereign is visiting Toronto they reside in the Royal Suite at the Fairmont Royal York Hotel.\n\n\n"}

Most notably a musician, her work is known among electronica, nu jazz and trip hop circles for her trademark spoken word and aspirated singing style as well as its erotic and literary subtexts. Daou's songs are represented by Downtown Music Publishing.\n\nDaou was born and spent her early childhood in St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands, relocating in 1984 to attend boarding school in Massachusetts. As a young adult, she attended Vassar College for two years and spent several years in New York City's Hell's Kitchen area before earning a scholarship to study dance at Columbia University. There, she would train with choreographer Eric Hawkins and explore visual art with Barry Moser and poetry with Kenneth Koch, whom she cites as having sparked her interest in spoken word. Daou ultimately graduated cum laude with a visual arts and art history degree from Barnard College/Columbia and frequently appeared in her senior year at Postcrypt Coffeehouse, the university's on-campus poetry lounge.\n\nWhile still a student, Daou began her career recording for NuGroove Records, one of New York's underground electronica labels. Demos that Daou had recorded caught the attention of two NuGroove DJs, and they invited her to provide guest vocals on a developing track. The experiment led to the label's top-selling single \"It Could Not Happen,\" which later was released on Network Records in the United Kingdom. Daou also performed as \"Vandal\" at Los Angeles' Stranger Than Fiction rave at the Shrine Auditorium in 1990.\n\nDaou's underground success brought her to the attention of Columbia Records, which signed her to a seven-album record deal. Daou, along with a five-piece band released \"Head Music\" as The Daou in 1992. An airy fusion of rock, jazz and funk, \"Head Music\" enjoyed moderate success and received praiseworthy reviews in the New York Times Sunday Arts & Leisure section and CREAM and \"Billboard\" magazines. The album's first single \"Surrender Yourself\" was remixed by Danny Tenaglia and reached No. 1 on Billboard's Dance Chart. Creative disagreements with Columbia would see Daou negotiate out of her contract and subsequently release \"Head Music's\" next two singles for the independent Tribal Records.\n\nIn 1994 Daou, now billed as a solo act, recorded \"Zipless\", a sexually charged collection of pieces inspired by the work of the poet/novelist Erica Jong. A slight stylistic evolution from \"Head Music,\" \"Zipless\" employed a somewhat more synthesized sound and introduced Daou's foray into recorded spoken word. Daou released \"Zipless\" on her own label, Lotus Records. The album quickly established a cult following and attracted the attention of Bob Krasnow, the music A&R executive whose artist signings include Anita Baker, Björk, Natalie Merchant and Metallica. Krasnow signed Daou to his fledgling MCA Records subsidiary Krasnow Entertainment and re-released \"Zipless\" in 1995.\n\n\"Zipless\" garnered favorable international press, with features and reviews in \"Time\", \"Billboard\" Spotlight Review, \"Bikini\", \"Vibe\", \"Wire\", \"Mix Mag\", \"URB\", the \"Toronto Star\" and \"Le Monde\", among other publications. The first single, \"Near the Black Forest,\" was featured in heavy rotation on VH1 and, along with follow-up single \"Sunday Afternoons,\" enjoyed moderate radio rotation. Daou toured nationally with New York rapper Guru and his hip hop-jazz fusion project Jazzmatazz, playing at venues such as L.A.'s House of Blues and Bimbo's 365 Club in San Francisco.\n\nIn 1995 MCA underwent significant management changes, at which time the company faltered on the momentum that had been building for several months around \"Zipless.\" Daou recorded a sophomore solo album, Slow to Burn, and released it in the Fall of that year. With each song a vignette inspired by the biographies of such celebrated female artisans as Billie Holiday, Gertrude Stein and Frida Kahlo, Slow To Burn enjoyed moderate to heavy smooth jazz format radio play with its first single \"Two to Tango.\" It was featured in reviews in VIBE, URB, Billboard, Curve, and Cover magazines. Two to Tango was remixed by Danny Tenaglia and reached the top of Billboard's Dance Chart, remaining at No. 1 for three weeks. It was featured in the Matthew Perry film \"Fools Rush In.\" Two other songs from the album,\"If I Could (What I Would Do For You)\" and \"How Do You Feel?,\" were featured in the films \"An American Werewolf in Paris\" and \"Idle Hands,\" respectively.\n\nIn the winter of 1996 Seagram took over MCA and Doug Morris, a reputed adversary of Bob Krasnow, became president of the record label. Krasnow soon retired and folded his namesake label. Daou chose to leave as well, and negotiated out of her contract with MCA.\n\nOver the next couple years Daou again chose to release her records independently. With some support from Benny Medina/Handprint Entertainment, she released 1997's dancy, cosmic exploration-themed \"Plutonium Glow,\" on her own DaouMusic label. The project was one of the earliest albums by a former major-label artist to be marketed and sold on the internet. The online release was followed by a 1998 UK re-release by independent international distributor Oxygen Music Works. This latter version featured an alternate song sequencing and a new track, \"Alive,\" in place of \"Visions of You.\"\n\nArtwork from the \"Plutonium Glow\" era was showcased in an exhibit called \"Plutonium Show\" at Untitled (SPACE) Gallery in New Haven, Connecticut. A piece from the show entitled \"Music Box\" subsequently went on for display at a National Arts Club student exhibition, securing the Jeffrey Seyfert Memorial Prize.\n\nIn 1999, Daou released \"Dear John Coltrane\" on the Oxygen imprint. Somewhat more heady and nostalgic in the vein of \"Slow to Burn\" than danceable like \"Plutonium Glow,\" the homage to the legendary jazz saxophonist met with warm reception by fans, but sparse marketing, press, club and radio support.\n\nDaou's next album \"Make You Love\", inspired by the travails of a girlfriend living in Paris, was co-released in 2000 on Daou's own label imprint and EMI in France. Generally positive reviews for Make You Love were featured in Le Monde, Elle, Magic, and Billboard Spotlight Review, and many critics received the album as Daou's most pop-oriented. The album's song \"Julliette\" was used in a scene for U.S. television series Dawson's Creek; the single \"A Little Bit of Pain\" was used in Lifetime TV movie \"Sex, Lies and Obsession;\" and in the fall of 2000 Daou promoted the project as guest on a seven-week concert tour of France by pop vocalist Etienne Daho. The song \"Make Believe\" from \"Plutonium Glow\" was re-recorded as a duet with Daho for his \"Corps et armes\" album.\n\nOn the heels of \"Make You Love,\" Daou would take a seven-year hiatus from releasing new material. Her catalog was tapped for various music compilations and for the soundtrack to 2005 French film \"Lila Says,\" but Daou would devote this time largely to visual arts, writing and academic pursuits.\n\nIn 2007, Daou announced on her official website that various pieces created since \"Make You Love\" were being compiled for an upcoming multimedia release, introduced under the working title \"Then, at Midnight.\" The project, ostensibly a new music album with related graphical content, ultimately would undergo a name change to \"Joe Sent Me,\" a passphrase used to navigate freely among the clandestine U.S. Prohibition-era speakeasy subculture.\n\nSeveral pivotal moments during Daou's hiatus would shape her new output—the September 11, 2001, terrorist attack on New York, where she then resided; and inspiring travel experiences among them.\n\nOn May 19, 2008, audio clips, lyrics and interactive graphic content heralding \"Joe Sent Me\" premiered on the website for the Barcelona Poetry Symposium. The material thereafter became available on Daou's own site, and the album itself was released in November 2008 via Daou's online marketplace. In May 2009, a program of original dances based on the music of \"Joe Sent Me\" debuted at Mercer County Community College's Kelsey Theatre, performed by the school's Mercer Dance Ensemble.\n\nOn January 31, 2010, a collection of four tone poems from Daou, collectively titled \"Love Among the Shadowed Things\", debuted on the seasonal \"Weird Tales for Winter\" segment of Jonny Mugwump & The Exotic Pylon, an experimental radio series broadcasting on London's community radio/Radio Art-format Resonance 104.4 FM.\n\nComposed around the themes \"Dream,\" \"Snow,\" \"Shadow\" and \"Night,\" the poems that comprise \"Love Among the Shadowed Things\" are stream-of-consciousness collages of spoken word, sparse free jazz accompaniment and thickly layered sound effects. Daou describes this aural meditation on a particular December night as a juxtapositioning of things \"secular and temporal ... familiar ... mystifying ... universal and eternal.\"\n\nIn summer 2012, Daou's official website announced the online streaming debut of song \"Revolution.\" The track would be included as a feature remix on \"Noozik – Volume 1,\" a collaborative music release between New York fashion house Nooka and digital indie music label Synth Records. Daou's website also announced that the original version of \"Revolution\" would appear on an upcoming 2013 album: \"Light Sweet Crude\".\n\nEmploying an array of producers, \"Light Sweet Crude (Act I: Hybrid)\" on its release would bear arguably a broader and more pronounced influence of discrete musical styles—e.g. house music, reggae, hip hop, and symphonic—than prior projects. Lyrically, too, \"Light Sweet Crude\" would see Daou expand into new territory: Where earlier work all but exclusively explored the tumult of personal angst and interpersonal liaisons, those matters in \"Light Sweet Crude\" become corollary to such geopolitical phenomena as revolution and war.\n\n\"I would say it has something to do with my own growing awareness and perception that politics is no longer something that exists outside of ourselves,\" Daou has said. \"There is no longer much, if any, separation between what happens outside in the world and what happens inside ourselves.\"\n\n\n\n\n"}

In the 1980s, he switched to the bass guitar.\n\nIn 2003, Cameron played bass guitar for a LA, local band called The Thornbirds (formerly called The Ducks). Cameron co-wrote the songs \"Girl from Oklahoma\" and \"Supersonic Sex Machine\" for the band Steel Panther, two of the members later joined The Thornbirds. When that group released \"All The Same\" in 2004, both of the songs were on that album. Cameron is also in a karaoke band that parodies actor/musicians, Corey Haim, Corey Feldman and Corey Hart called Coreyoke. Cameron says on his website that \"may be the most fun i’ve ever had in my long life.\" The story line behind Coreyoke is that they are musicians from the 1980s who are trying to revive their careers and play backup for Michael Jackson.\n\nCameron is married to Jessie Marion, granddaughter of actress Elena Verdugo, and lives in Los Angeles. Their son, Duncan, was born in August 2009. Cameron rarely uses capital letters. Cameron grew up without religion, and was a teen before he realized that \"there was a thing called atheism\". He credits his father with teaching him and his siblings to think critically.\n\nListed as a hard-core Libertarian on Cameron's IMDB profile, he tells interviewer Samm Levine that he prefers the term \"Freedom Fighter\". Cameron is also the inventor of the \"Bill of Rights: Security Edition Cards\" which have the Bill of Rights stamped on metal the size of a normal playing card. The idea is that they can be carried comfortably in the pocket of a flyer, and when a metal detector beeps after detecting the metal, the carrier will have to hand the TSA federal inspectors the card and \"give up his Bill of Rights... before boarding a plane.\" The website also sells Bill of Rights luggage tags and socks with the rights printed on them.\n\n"}

Originally from Harlem, New York, Hodge played college basketball at NC State and was selected 20th overall in the 2005 NBA draft by the Denver Nuggets. The ACC Player of the Year during the 2003–04 season, Hodge finished his college career by leading State to the Sweet 16.\n\nJulius Hodge was born in the Manhattan neighborhood of Harlem and raised across the Harlem River from Yankee Stadium. His mother, Mary Hodge, worked two jobs, including as a teacher's aide, to support Julius and his two siblings.\n\nHodge became smitten with basketball when he was five years old after his father took him to a New York Knicks game against the Los Angeles Lakers at Madison Square Garden where Magic Johnson smiled at him in the crowd. Hodge's father was deported to Antigua and Barbuda when Hodge was nine years old and Hodge has not seen him since. Hodge's older brother, Steven, was his strongest male role model and played basketball in the NJCAA at Sullivan County Community College and later in NCAA Division II at Long Island University - Southampton. Steven made the decision to name his younger brother after all-time basketball great Julius Erving.\n\nAs a senior at St. Raymond High School for Boys, operated by the De La Salle Christian Brothers, in the Bronx, New York, Hodge was part of the 2001 McDonald's All-American Team and the First-team \"Parade\" All-American, New York State Mr. Basketball, \"New York Daily News\" Player of the Year, New York All-Metro Squad, and \"Sports Illustrated\"'s Old Spice Athlete of the Month. He scored a total of 684 points his senior season, setting the school record at St. Raymond High School, and left rated as the best shooting guard by ESPN and fifth-best nationally. He averaged 24.5 points, 5 assists and 4 steals per game. Hodge surprised basketball fans by choosing to attend NC State over Syracuse University.\n\nAs a freshman with the NC State Wolfpack, he was the leading freshman scorer in the ACC, averaging 10.7 points per game. He was named to second-team All-ACC Tournament team, after averaging 12.3 points. He earned the Lorenzo Charles Offensive Rebounding Award for 2002, Dick Vitale's \"Diaper Dandy\" and ranked 20th in the ACC in rebounding. He scored a double-double in his first collegiate game and his first ACC game. He was the only Pack player with multiple double-doubles for the 2001–2002 season.\n\nFor the 2002–03 campaign, Hodge was selected as a First Team All-ACC player. He recorded four career-highs during the three-day run to the finals of the ACC Tournament. He recorded his seventh double-double during the final game of the tournament and ranked seventh in free throw percentage for the season. During this season he recorded the first-ever triple-double in Wolfpack history, and was named ACC Player of the Week after leading the Pack to back-to-back victories against Duke and North Carolina. He was one of 17 finalists to make the U.S. squad for the 2003 Pan American Games and Dick Vitale named Hodge to his \"All-Rolls Royce Team.\" He was one of the 50 preseason candidates for the Wooden Award.\n\nDuring the 2005 NCAA Tournament, Hodge hit a game winning shot against UConn after Charlie Villanueva had tied the score.\n\nAfter concluding his senior season and entering the NBA Draft, Hodge remained at NC State to finish his degree in communications.\n\nHodge was chosen in the first round (20th overall) of the 2005 NBA Draft by the Denver Nuggets. He appeared in 14 games for the Nuggets in the 2005–06 season while averaging only 0.9 points in 2.4 minutes.\n\nOn January 5, 2007, Hodge started in his first career NBA game, against the Los Angeles Lakers. Six days later he was traded to the Milwaukee Bucks along with Earl Boykins for Steve Blake. On February 7 of that year, Hodge was waived by the Bucks. Later that year, he played for the 2007 Seattle SuperSonics summer league team.\n\nOn August 10, 2007, Hodge signed with Italian Serie A team Cimberio Varese. Midway through the season, he transferred to fellow Serie A team Legea Scafati. In Italy, Hodge had trouble getting his clubs to fulfill his salary obligations.\n\nOn December 21, 2007, Hodge signed with the Adelaide 36ers in the Australian NBL as their second import to replace the outgoing Mike Chappell. He finished his contract with Italian Serie A team Legea Scafati and arrived in Adelaide on December 23 after making trips to his hometown New York. He made his debut for the 36ers against the South Dragons helping them to a victory.\nOn January 29, Hodge was rewarded with the league's player of the week for round 19 after averaging 27 points, 4 rebounds and 4.5 assists in the two games the 36ers played, which included a dominant performance of 39 points, 10 rebounds and 5 assists against the Cairns Taipans.\nOn February 2, Hodge became the first 36er since Robert Rose in 1994 to record a triple double (24 points, 12 rebounds, 13 assists). A few days after, on February 5, Hodge won his second and back-to-back player of the week for Round 20 after averaging 31 points, 10.5 rebounds and 9.5 assists, which also included a performance of 37 points, 9 rebounds, and 6 assists in the 36ers lost to the Gold Coast Blaze. On February 12, Hodge won his third consecutive player of the week for round 21 by having another dominant performance of 31 points, 14 rebounds and 9 assists in the 36ers win against the Cairns Taipans. Hodge became just the second player to win the award three times (Chris Anstey is the other player to do so), and the first player to win it three times consecutively during the season. Despite only playing half of the season in the league, Hodge was rewarded with the All NBL Third Team for his efforts with the 36ers. Hodge then bid for his return to the NBA by trying out with the New Jersey Nets, but could not make the regular season roster despite signing a 2-year non-guaranteed contract.\n\nOn November 15, 2008, Hodge re-signed with the Adelaide 36ers replacing outgoing import Mark Tyndale. In the first week of his return to the NBL, Hodge won another NBL Player of the Week award for round 10, averaging 26.5 points per game, 10.5 rebounds, 6 assists, and 1 steal, despite the 36ers losing the two games he played in. This included a dominant performance of 27 points, 8 rebounds, and 8 assists against the South Dragons, and the praise of opposition coach Brian Goorjian, who coached the Australian Boomers in the 2008 Beijing Olympics, saying that he was \"possibly the best player in the league.\" On December 30, 2008, Hodge won his second NBL Player of the Week award of the season for round 15, after having scored 31 points (while shooting 13 of 19 from the field at a 68% clip) and pulling 8 rebounds to lead the 36ers in a crucial road victory over the Melbourne Tigers.\n\nIn 2011, it was revealed Hodge's recruitment had been paid for out of the $27 million Christopher Wayne Fuss had embezzled from Flinders University. On July 8, 2011 Fuss received nine years jail for the theft.\n\nIn the summer of 2009, Hodge attended a Chicago Bulls mini-camp but did not make the team's roster. In November 2009, Hodge signed with the Melbourne Tigers to help bolster an injury-plagued roster missing Chris Anstey. In his November 14, 2009 debut, Hodge scored 22 points and tallied 9 rebounds and 7 assists, but it wasn't enough as the Townsville Crocodiles won 98–91.\n\nHodge returned to Adelaide as a member of the Melbourne Tigers in December 2009. He was booed every time he touched the ball and after the win Hodge stamped on Brett Maher's signature on center court. He had to receive a police escort off the court and out of the building.\n\nHodge returned to the Americas in 2010 after signing a contract with Trotamundos de Carabobo of Venezuela's Liga Profesional de Baloncesto.\n\nAfter a brief stint in Venezuela, Hodge was signed in the summer of 2010 by Guangzhou Free Man of China's National Basketball League. He scored 16 points in his debut against Shenyang.\n\nLater in 2010, Hodge received a substantial offer from Petrochimi Bandar Imam BC of the Iranian Basketball Super League. Although impressed by the quality of basketball in Iran, Hodge was not comfortable with the environment. On March 3, 2011, Hodge and the club agreed to terminate his contract because they were unable to pay him the full amount.\n\nHodge's first new team of 2011 was BC Tsmoki-Minsk, a Belarusian Premier League team in Minsk. Due to a struggling economy, the club was slow to make payments and Hodge ultimately exercised an option to exit his contract early.\n\nHodge returned to China in 2011, this time playing for the Jiangsu Tongxi. In seven games with Jiangsu, he averaged 25.6 points per game and was named the All-Chinese NBL Import Player of the Year.\n\nIn December 2011, Hodge signed with Vietnam's Saigon Heat of the ASEAN Basketball League.\nOn February 20, 2012, the Heat released him. Hodge described playing in Vietnam as an \"adventure\" where he had the unique experience of playing alongside teammates who worked 9-5 jobs.\n\nIn November 2012, Hodge was added to the roster of Paris-Levallois Basket in France's LNB Pro A. In Paris, he was teammates with Sean May and Jawad Williams, both of whom were Hodge's conference rivals in college and his teenage friends from the youth basketball circuit.\n\nThe Saint John Mill Rats of the National Basketball League of Canada announced the signing of Hodge on February 4, 2013. Hodge became just the ninth former NBA player to ever play in the league. The club bought out his contract with Paris-Levallois Basket later that month on February 25.\n\nOn May 18, 2015, Buffalo Bulls head coach Nate Oats announced that Hodge would serve as the Director of Player Development for the State University of New York at Buffalo.\n\nOn March 29, 2016, Hodge joined his former college coach Herb Sendek as an assistant coach at Santa Clara University.\n\nOn April 26, 2018, Hodge joined the staff of Jean Prioleau at San Jose State as an assistant coach.\n\nAfter visiting a nightclub on April 8, 2006, Hodge was on Interstate 76 in North Denver around 2:00 a.m. when another vehicle pulled alongside his and fired several shots. Hodge was told he came within 5 minutes of bleeding to death. The case has yet to be solved.\n\nIn 2011, Hodge played for the Antigua and Barbuda national basketball team in the Caribbean Basketball Confederation Championship.\n\nDuring each offseason of his overseas playing career, Hodge returned to live in Raleigh, North Carolina where he played during his college career. As of 2013, Hodge is married with two children. He describes himself as a \"movie buff.\"\n\nHis quote \"When we hungry, we eat\" after upsetting top ranked Duke, was the inspiration for the American Aquarium song \"Wolves\", and was the title track for the album.\n\n"}
{"id": "2181790", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2181790", "title": "X-ray microtomography", "text": "X-ray microtomography\n\nX-ray microtomography, like tomography and X-ray computed tomography, uses X-rays to create cross-sections of a physical object that can be used to recreate a virtual model (3D model) without destroying the original object. The prefix \"micro-\" (symbol: µ) is used to indicate that the pixel sizes of the cross-sections are in the micrometre range. These pixel sizes have also resulted in the terms high-resolution X-ray tomography, micro–computed tomography (micro-CT or µCT), and similar terms. Sometimes the terms high-resolution CT (HRCT) and micro-CT are differentiated, but in other cases the term high-resolution micro-CT is used. Virtually all tomography today is computed tomography.\n\nMicro-CT has applications both in medical imaging and in industrial computed tomography. In general, there are two types of scanner setups. In one setup, the X-ray source and detector are typically stationary during the scan while the sample/animal rotates. The second setup, much more like a clinical CT scanner, is gantry based where the animal/specimen is stationary in space while the X-ray tube and detector rotate around. These scanners are typically used for small animals (\"in vivo\" scanners), biomedical samples, foods, microfossils, and other studies for which minute detail is desired.\n\nThe first X-ray microtomography system was conceived and built by Jim Elliott in the early 1980s. The first published X-ray microtomographic images were reconstructed slices of a small tropical snail, with pixel size about 50 micrometers.\n\nThe fan-beam system is based on a one-dimensional (1D) X-ray detector and an electronic X-ray source, creating 2D cross-sections of the object. Typically used in human computed tomography systems.\n\nThe cone-beam system is based on a 2D X-ray detector (camera) and an electronic X-ray source, creating projection images that later will be used to reconstruct the image cross-sections.\n\nIn an open system, X-rays may escape or leak out, thus the operator must stay behind a shield, have special protective clothing, or operate the scanner from a distance or a different room. Typical examples of these scanners are the human versions, or designed for big objects.\n\nIn a closed system, X-ray shielding is put around the scanner so the operator can put the scanner on a desk or special table. Although the scanner is shielded, care must be taken and the operator usually carries a dosimeter, since X-rays have a tendency to be absorbed by metal and then re-emitted like an antenna. Although a typical scanner will produce a relatively harmless volume of X-rays, repeated scannings in a short timeframe could pose a danger. Digital detectors with small pixel pitches and micro-focus x-ray tubes are usually employed to yield in high resolution images. \nClosed systems tend to become very heavy because lead is used to shield the X-rays. Therefore, the smaller scanners only have a small space for samples.\n\nBecause microtomography scanners offer isotropic, or near isotropic, resolution, display of images does not need to be restricted to the conventional axial images. Instead, it is possible for a software program to build a volume by 'stacking' the individual slices one on top of the other. The program may then display the volume in an alternative manner.\n\nFor X-ray microtomography, powerful open source software is available, such as the ASTRA toolbox. The ASTRA Toolbox is a MATLAB toolbox of high-performance GPU primitives for 2D and 3D tomography, from 2009–2014 developed by iMinds-Vision Lab, University of Antwerp and since 2014 jointly developed by iMinds-VisionLab, UAntwerpen and CWI, Amsterdam.\nThe toolbox supports parallel, fan, and cone beam, with highly flexible source/detector positioning. A large number of reconstruction algorithms are available, including FBP, ART, SIRT, SART, CGLS.\n\nVolume rendering is a technique used to display a 2D projection of a 3D discretely sampled data set, as produced by a microtomography scanner. Usually these are acquired in a regular pattern (e.g., one slice every millimeter) and usually have a regular number of image pixels in a regular pattern. This is an example of a regular volumetric grid, with each volume element, or voxel represented by a single value that is obtained by sampling the immediate area surrounding the voxel.\n\nWhere different structures have similar threshold density, it can become impossible to separate them simply by adjusting volume rendering parameters. The solution is called segmentation, a manual or automatic procedure that can remove the unwanted structures from the image.\n\n\n\nDevelopmental biology\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn geology it is used to analyze micro pores in the reservoir rocks, it can used in microfacies analysis for sequence stratigraphy. In petroleum exploration it is used to model the petroleum flow under micro pores and nano particles.\n\nIt can give a resolution up to 1 nm.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2181792", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2181792", "title": "Bicameralism (psychology)", "text": "Bicameralism (psychology)\n\nBicameralism (the condition of being divided into \"two-chambers\") is a hypothesis in psychology that argues that the human mind once operated in a state in which cognitive functions were divided between one part of the brain which appears to be \"speaking\", and a second part which listens and obeys—a \"bicameral mind\". The term was coined by Julian Jaynes, who presented the idea in his 1976 book \"The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind\", wherein he made the case that a bicameral mentality was the normal and ubiquitous state of the human mind as recently as 3,000 years ago, near the end of the Mediterranean bronze age.\n\nJaynes uses governmental bicameralism as a metaphor to describe a mental state in which the experiences and memories of the right hemisphere of the brain are transmitted to the left hemisphere via auditory hallucinations. The metaphor is based on the idea of lateralization of brain function although each half of a normal human brain is constantly communicating with the other through the \"corpus callosum\". The metaphor is not meant to imply that the two halves of the bicameral brain were \"cut off\" from each other but that the bicameral mind was experienced as a different, non-conscious mental schema wherein volition in the face of novel stimuli was mediated through a linguistic control mechanism and experienced as auditory verbal hallucination.\n\nBicameral mentality would be non-conscious in its inability to reason and articulate about mental contents through meta-reflection, reacting without explicitly realizing and without the meta-reflective ability to give an account of \"why\" one did so. The bicameral mind would thus lack metaconsciousness, autobiographical memory, and the capacity for executive \"ego functions\" such as deliberate mind-wandering and conscious introspection of mental content. When bicamerality as a method of social control was no longer adaptive in complex civilizations, this mental model was replaced by the conscious mode of thought which, Jaynes argued, is grounded in the acquisition of metaphorical language learned by exposure to narrative practice.\nAccording to Jaynes, ancient people in the bicameral state of mind would have experienced the world in a manner that has some similarities to that of a person with schizophrenia. Rather than making conscious evaluations in novel or unexpected situations, the person would hallucinate a voice or \"god\" giving admonitory advice or commands and obey without question: One would not be at all conscious of one's own thought processes \"per se\". Jaynes's hypothesis is offered as a possible explanation of \"\"command hallucinations\"\" that often direct the behavior of those afflicted by first rank symptoms of schizophrenia, as well as other voice hearers.\n\nJaynes built a case for this hypothesis that human brains existed in a bicameral state until as recently as 3,000 years ago by citing evidence from many diverse sources including historical literature. He took an interdisciplinary approach, drawing data from many different fields. Jaynes asserted that, until roughly the times written about in Homer's \"Iliad\", humans did not generally have the self-awareness characteristic of consciousness as most people experience it today. Rather, the bicameral individual was guided by mental commands believed to be issued by external \"gods\"—commands which were recorded in ancient myths, legends and historical accounts. This is exemplified not only in the commands given to characters in ancient epics but also the very muses of Greek mythology which \"sang\" the poems. According to Jaynes, the ancients literally heard muses as the direct source of their music and poetry.\n\nJaynes asserts that in the \"Iliad\" and sections of the Old Testament no mention is made of any kind of cognitive processes such as introspection, and there is no apparent indication that the writers were self-aware. Jaynes suggests, the older portions of the Old Testament (such as the Book of Amos) have few or none of the features of some later books of the Old Testament (such as Ecclesiastes) as well as later works such as Homer's \"Odyssey\", which show indications of a profoundly different kind of mentality—an early form of consciousness.\n\nIn ancient times, Jaynes noted, gods were generally much more numerous and much more anthropomorphic than in modern times, and speculates that this was because each bicameral person had their own \"god\" who reflected their own desires and experiences.\n\nHe also noted that in ancient societies the corpses of the dead were often treated as though still alive (being seated, dressed, and even fed) as a form of ancestor worship, and Jaynes argued that the dead bodies were presumed to be still living and the source of auditory hallucinations. This adaptation to the village communities of 100 individuals or more formed the core of religion. Unlike today's hallucinations, the voices of ancient times were structured by cultural norms to produce a seamlessly functioning society.\n\nJaynes inferred that these \"voices\" came from the right brain counterparts of the left brain language centres; specifically, the counterparts to Wernicke's area and Broca's area. These regions are somewhat dormant in the right brains of most modern humans, but Jaynes noted that some studies show that auditory hallucinations correspond to increased activity in these areas of the brain.\n\nJaynes notes that even at the time of publication there is no consensus as to the cause or origins of schizophrenia. Jaynes argues that schizophrenia is a vestige of humanity's earlier bicameral state. Recent evidence shows that many schizophrenics do not just hear random voices but experience \"command hallucinations\" instructing their behavior or urging them to commit certain acts.\n\nAs support for Jaynes's argument, these command hallucinations are little different from the commands from gods which feature prominently in ancient stories. Indirect evidence supporting Jaynes's theory that hallucinations once played an important role in human mentality can be found in the recent book \"Muses, Madmen, and Prophets: Rethinking the History, Science, and Meaning of Auditory Hallucination\" by Daniel Smith.\n\nJaynes theorized that a shift from bicameralism marked the beginning of introspection and consciousness as we know it today. According to Jaynes, this bicameral mentality began malfunctioning or \"breaking down\" during the 2nd millennium BCE. He speculates that primitive ancient societies tended to collapse periodically: for example, Egypt's Intermediate Periods, as well as the periodically vanishing cities of the Mayas, as changes in the environment strained the socio-cultural equilibria sustained by this bicameral mindset.\n\nThe Bronze age collapse of the 2nd millennium BCE led to mass migrations and created a rash of unexpected situations and stresses which required ancient minds to become more flexible and creative. Self-awareness, or consciousness, was the culturally evolved solution to this problem. This necessity of communicating commonly observed phenomena among individuals who shared no common language or cultural upbringing encouraged those communities to become self-aware to survive in a new environment. Thus consciousness, like bicamerality, emerged as a neurological adaptation to social complexity in a changing world.\n\nJaynes further argues that divination, prayer, and oracles arose during this breakdown period, in an attempt to summon instructions from the \"gods\" whose voices could no longer be heard. The consultation of special bicamerally operative individuals, or of divination by casting lots and so forth, was a response to this loss, a transitional era depicted, for example, in the book of 1 Samuel. It was also evidenced in children who could communicate with the gods, but as their neurology was set by language and society they gradually lost that ability. Those who continued prophesying, being bicameral according to Jaynes, could be killed. Leftovers of the bicameral mind today, according to Jaynes, include mental illnesses such as schizophrenia and the hallucinations present in patients with split brain syndrome.\n\nAn early (1977) reviewer considered Jaynes's hypothesis worthy and offered conditional support, arguing the notion deserves further study.\n\n\"The Origin of Consciousness\" was financially successful, and has been reprinted several times.\n\nOriginally published in 1976, it was nominated for the National Book Award in 1978. It has been translated into Italian, Spanish, German, French, and Persian. A new edition, with an afterword that addressed some criticisms and restated the main themes, was published in the United States in 1990 and in the United Kingdom (by Penguin Books) in 1993, re-issued in 2000.\n\nPhilip K. Dick, Terrence McKenna, and David Bowie all cited the book as an influence.\n\nJaynes's hypothesis remains controversial. The primary scientific criticism has been that the conclusions drawn by Jaynes had no basis in neuropsychiatric fact.\n\nAccording to Jaynes, language is a necessary, but not a sufficient condition for consciousness: Language existed thousands of years earlier, but consciousness could not have emerged without language. The idea that language is a necessary component of subjective consciousness and more abstract forms of thinking has gained the support of proponents including Andy Clark, Daniel Dennett, William H. Calvin, Merlin Donald, John Limber, Howard Margolis, Peter Carruthers, and José Luis Bermúdez.\n\nWilliams (2010) defended Jaynes against the criticism of Block (1981).\n\nAsaad & Shapiro (1987) questioned why Jaynes's theory was left out of a discussion on auditory hallucinations. The author's (1987) published response was: \"... Jaynes' hypothesis makes for interesting reading and stimulates much thought in the receptive reader. It does not, however, adequately explain one of the central mysteries of madness: hallucination.\" (Moffic, 1987) However Moffic's claim that there is no evidence for involvement of the right temporal lobe in auditory hallucination was incorrect, even at the time that he wrote it. More recently, a number of studies have provided more evidence of involvement of the right hemisphere in auditory hallucinations. The new evidence for Jaynes's model of auditory hallucinations arising in the right temporal-parietal lobe and being transmitted to the left temporal-parietal lobe that these neuroimaging studies provide was specifically pointed out by Olin (1999) and by Sher (2000). For further discussion, see Marcel Kuijsten (2007).\n\nBrian J. McVeigh, a graduate student of Jaynes, maintains that many of the most frequent criticisms of Jaynes's theory are either incorrect or reflect serious misunderstandings of Jaynes's theory, especially Jaynes's more precise definition of consciousness. Jaynes defines consciousness—in the tradition of Locke and Descartes—as \"\"that which is introspectable\"\". Jaynes draws a sharp distinction between consciousness (\"\"introspectable mind-space\"\") and other mental processes such as cognition, learning, sensation, and perception. McVeigh argues that this distinction is frequently not recognized by those offering critiques of Jaynes's theory.\n\nRichard Dawkins in \"The God Delusion\" (2006) wrote of \"The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind\":It is one of those books that is either complete rubbish or a work of consummate genius; Nothing in between! Probably the former, but I'm hedging my bets.\n\nThe philosopher Daniel Dennett suggested that Jaynes may have been wrong about some of his supporting arguments – especially the importance he attached to hallucinations – but that these things are not essential to his main thesis:\nIf we are going to use this top-down approach, we are going to have to be bold. We are going to have to be speculative, but there is good and bad speculation, and this is not an unparalleled activity in science. ... Those scientists who have no taste for this sort of speculative enterprise will just have to stay in the trenches and do without it, while the rest of us risk embarrassing mistakes and have a lot of fun. — Daniel Dennett\n\nGregory Cochran, a physicist and adjunct professor of anthropology at the University of Utah, wrote:Genes affecting personality, reproductive strategies, cognition, are all able to change significantly over few-millennia time scales if the environment favors such change—and this includes the new environments we have made for ourselves, things like new ways of making a living and new social structures. ... There is evidence that such change has occurred. ... On first reading, \"Breakdown\" seemed one of the craziest books ever written, but Jaynes may have been on to something.\n\nAuthor and historian of science Morris Berman writes: \"\"[Jaynes's] description of this new consciousness is one of the best I have come across.\"\"\n\nDanish science writer Tor Nørretranders discusses Jaynes's theory favorably in his 1991 book.\n\nIain McGilchrist, who published a similar idea, accepts Jaynes's intention, but proposes that Jaynes's hypothesis was the opposite of what happened:I believe he [Jaynes] got one important aspect of the story back to front. His contention that the phenomena he describes came about because of a \"breakdown\" of the 'bicameral mind' – so that the two hemispheres, previously separate, now merged – is the precise inverse of what happened.\n\nAs an argument against Jaynes's proposed date of the transition from bicameralism to consciousness, some critics have referred to the Epic of Gilgamesh. Early copies of the epic are many centuries older than even the oldest passages of the Old Testament, and yet it describes introspection and other mental processes that, according to Jaynes, were impossible for the bicameral mind.\n\nJaynes noted that the most complete version of the Gilgamesh epic dates to post-bicameral times (7th century BCE), dismisses these instances of introspection as the result of rewriting and expansion by later conscious scribes, and points to differences between the more recent version of \"Gilgamesh\" and surviving fragments of earlier versions: \"\"The most interesting comparison is in Tablet X.\"\" His answer, however, does not deal with the generally accepted dating of the \"Standard Version\" of the Gilgamesh epic to the later 2nd millennium BCE, nor does it account for the introspection characteristic of the \"Standard Version\" being thoroughly rooted in the Old Babylonian and Sumerian versions, especially as our understanding of the Old Babylonian poem improves.\n\nJaynes's proposal does not explain how bicameralism could have been lost at the same time across the entire human species. The indigenous Australian culture was completely separated from the rest of the world from 4000 BCE to 1600 CE, yet appears today to be both historically unchanged and self-conscious.\n\nDivination is also considerably older than that date and the early writings he claims show bicamerality: The oldest recorded Chinese Writing was on oracle bones, meaning that divination arose at the same time or even earlier than writing in Chinese society.\n\nWhile he said ancient societies engaged in ancestor worship before this date, non-ancient societies also engaged in it after that date; very advanced societies like the Aztecs and Egyptians mummified and deified rulers (see Pyramids and the philosopher Nezahualcoyotl). The Aztecs and Incans did so all the way up to their conquest by the Spanish.\n\nIt is now known that the sense of agency is closely connected with lateralization: The left parietal lobe is active when visualizing actions by the self, while the right parietal lobe is active for actions by others. Additionally, Wernicke's area processes the literal meaning of language, while the homologous region in the right hemisphere processes the intent of a speaker.\n\nIt has been found that people with damage to the right inferior parietal cortex experience alien hand syndrome, as do people who have had a corpus callosotomy. This reverses the relationship between the right and left hemispheres posited by Jaynes's proposed bicameralism: It is the left hemisphere that is responsible for speech and the right hemisphere that is responsible for self-awareness.\n\nV. S. Ramachandran, in his 2003 book \"The Emerging Mind\", proposes a similar concept, referring to the left cortical hemisphere as an \"\"apologist\"\", and the right cortical hemisphere as a \"\"revolutionary\"\".\n\nIn his book \"Neuroreality: A Scientific Religion to Restore Meaning, or How 7 Brain Elements Create 7 Minds and 7 Realities\", Bruce E. Morton, formerly of the University of Hawaii, similarly proposed such a concept.\n\nPsychiatrist Iain McGilchrist reviews scientific research into the role of the brain's hemispheres, and cultural evidence, in his book \"The Master and His Emissary\". Similar to Jaynes, McGilchrist proposes that since the time of Plato the left hemisphere of the brain (the \"emissary\" in the title) has increasingly taken over from the right hemisphere (the \"master\"), to our \"detriment\". McGilchrist, while accepting Jayne's intention, felt that Jaynes's hypothesis was \"\"the precise inverse of what happened\"\" and that rather than a shift \"from\" bicameralism there evolved a separation of the hemispheres \"to\" bicameralism. (See McGilchrist quotation, above.)\n\nMichael Gazzaniga pioneered the split-brain experiments which led him to propose a similar theory called the left brain interpreter.\n\nNeuroscientist Michael Persinger, who co-invented the \"God helmet\" in the 1980s, believes that his invention may induce mystical experiences by having the separate right hemisphere consciousness intrude into the awareness of the normally-dominant left hemisphere. Scientific reproductions have shown that the same results could be obtained even if the device was turned off, indicating the participants were likely experiencing placebo.\n\n\n\nThe Julian Jaynes Society was founded by supporters of bicameralism in 1997, shortly after Jaynes's death. The society published a collection of essays on bicameralism in 2007, with contributors including psychological anthropologist Brian J. McVeigh, psychologists John Limber and Scott Greer, clinical psychologist John Hamilton, philosophers Jan Sleutels and David Stove, and sinologist Michael Carr (see \"shi\" \"personator\"). The book also contains an extensive biography of Julian Jaynes by historian of psychology William Woodward and June Tower, and a foreword by neuroscientist Michael Persinger.\n\n"}

Stricklin was the last member of the Alabama Gang.\n\nIn 1987, Stricklin won NASCAR's Dash Series championship and made his debut in the Winston Cup Series.\n\nTwo years later, he finished second to Dick Trickle in the NASCAR Rookie of the Year competition with car owner Rod Osterlund. In his sophomore season, he competed in only three events before taking over the driving chores of Bobby Allison's No. 12 Raybestos Brakes-sponsored Buick. 1991 turned out to be one of his best seasons, as he finished 16th in points as well as a career high second-place finish at Michigan International Speedway. With eight races left in the 1992 season, Stricklin was fired by Allison. Stricklin ended the season driving for Junie Donlavey. For 1993, Stricklin signed with Junior Johnson, driving the No. 27 McDonald's-sponsored Ford. In 1994, Stricklin paired with owner Travis Carter to form a new team, the No. 23 Camel Cigarettes-sponsored Ford. It was a disappointing year for Stricklin, finishing 26th in points.\n\nAfter Stricklin failed to find a ride for 1995, he served as a consultant for Kenny Bernstein's rookie driver Steve Kinser, a World of Outlaws Sprint Car champion who was struggling to transition from dirt to pavement. During the season, Kinser resigned, and Stricklin took over, posting five Top 10 finishes. However the team closed at the end of the year.\nStricklin joined the Stavola Brothers Racing No. 8 Circuit City-sponsored Ford in 1996. He had a second-place finish at Darlington Raceway, and ended up 22nd in the points standings that year.\n\nIn 1998, Stricklin started the season with the Stavola Brothers, but was released after failing to make the Coca-Cola 600. Stricklin ended the season as a substitute for David Green and Robert Pressley.\n\n1999 presented Stricklin with a new challenge. He was now the crew chief for Gary Bradberry's No. 78 Ford for Triad Motorsports. When that team was sold, Stricklin took over the No. 58 Ford for SBIII Motorsports. He posted some of the best finishes of the year for that team, including a top-ten finish at Michigan. Despite posting three consecutive DNQs, Stricklin appeared to have found solid footing, as Barbour announced that he would be his driver through 2003, and would have Motorsports Safety Technologies as his sponsor. However, sponsorship again plagued Stricklin, as shortly after signing the deal, MST produced a bounced check, causing Barbour's team to close its doors for good.\n\nIn 2000, Stricklin drove for Donlavey at the Brickyard 400 and finished 14th. In 2001, Strickin had a sixth-place finish at Michigan. However, Sara Lee, parent company of sponsor Hills Brothers demanded Donlavey pull their decals after he released Stricklin from the team. In 2002, Stricklin moved to Bill Davis Racing, bringing Hills Bros. with him.However, Stricklin was replaced with Kenny Wallace prior to the Southern 500.\n\n"}

He was born and died in Antwerp. He was trained in drawing by his father Ferdinand de Braekeleer, a well-known genre painter, and his uncle Jan August Hendrik Leys. Braekeleer entered the Royal Academy of Fine Arts (Antwerp) in 1854. Although he remained a student there until 1861, he publicly exhibited his paintings for the first time in 1858, when \"Reaper\" and \"Washerwoman\" (locations unknown) were shown at the Antwerp Salon. In 1863, he went to Germany and, in 1864, to the Netherlands, studying works by 16th- and 17th-century painters in both countries. The influence of Johannes Vermeer was especially important, seen in one of de Braekeleer's most characteristic subjects: a single person absorbed in a quiet activity, shown in an interior lit by a window.\n\nIn 1869, de Braekeleer signed a contract with the Belgian art dealer, Gustave Coûteaux, a relationship that continued until 1876. In the same year, his uncle Baron Leys died. The two events combined to create the most productive period in de Braekeleer's career, when he made the works for which he is best known and received public recognition for them. In 1872, he received a gold medal at the Salon in Brussels for \"The Geographer\" and \"The Lesson\" and, in 1873, a gold medal at the International Exhibition in Vienna for \"The Painter's Studio\" and \"Grandmother's Birthday Celebration\" (all in the Royal Museum of Fine Arts, Brussels). However, apparently because of depression, he seems to have stopped painting between 1879 and 1881. When he started to work again, he used a shorter and more visible brushstroke, perhaps as a result of the influence of the Impressionists. Vincent van Gogh mentioned de Braekeleer in letters to his brother Theo several times, referring to him as an artist he liked as well as one afflicted by mental illness.\n\n\n\n"}

She was the sister of the crown prince Nerikkaili of Hatti and the sister of the later Hittite king Tudhaliya IV.\n\nMaathorneferure was married to the Egyptian Pharaoh Ramesses II in the 34th year of his reign, becoming the King's Great Wife. Her original name is unknown, but her Egyptian name translates as \"One who sees Horus, the invisible splendor of Ra\".\n\nEgypt and the Hittite empire had been increasingly at odds since the demise of the kingdom of the Mitanni, and Maathorneferure's marriage to the Egyptian king was the conclusion of the peace process which had begun with the signing of a peace treaty thirteen years earlier.\n\nOn the Marriage Stela it is claimed that \"The daughter of the great chief of Kheta marched in [front] of the army [...]\" \n\nThe Hittite princess left Hattusa, the Hittite capital, in late 1246 BCE, accompanied by her mother and a huge contingent laden with gold, silver, bronze, cattle and sheep, and slaves. At the Egyptian frontier, a message was despatched to the Pharaoh: 'They have traversed sheer mountains and treacherous passes to reach Your Majesty's border.' Ramesses sent a welcoming party to escort the princess through Canaan and into Egypt. She arrived in February 1245 BCE at Pi-Ramesse.\n\nFor Ramesses, the marriage was valuable more for the large dowry he acquired rather than his new bride, who was despatched to his harem palace at Mer-wer (today's Gurob). According to another account, however, Maathorneferure is said to have given Ramesses a baby (a girl called Neferure, according to the Abydos procession) and died shortly thereafter.\n\nMaathorneferure is mentioned on a papyrus found at Gurob. The partial text on the papyrus states: \"[...] small bag, the king's wife Maathorneferure (may she live) (the daughter of) the great ruler of Khatti, [...] Dayt garment of 28 cubits, 4 palms, breadth 4 cubits, [bag?] of 14 cubits, 2 palms, breath 4 cubits - 2 items [...] palms, breath 4 cubits\".\n\nAt Tanis, there is a broken statue of Ramesses that shows her (mostly destroyed) figure touching his leg, together with her cartouche.\n\nDuring the latter half of the first millennium BCE Maathorneferure's marriage to the pharaoh gave rise to the tale inscribed on the Bentresh stela in which the sister of a foreign queen is healed by a divine statue sent from Egypt.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2181812", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2181812", "title": "Ragù", "text": "Ragù\n\nIn Italian cuisine, ragù () is a meat-based sauce that is commonly served with pasta. An Italian gastronomic society, Accademia Italiana della Cucina, documented several ragù recipes. The recipes' common characteristics are the presence of meat and the fact that all are sauces for pasta. The most typical are \"ragù alla bolognese\" (Bolognese sauce). Other types are \"ragù alla napoletana\" (Neapolitan ragù), and \"ragù alla Barese\" (sometimes made with horse meat).\n\nIn northern Italian regions, ragù typically uses minced, chopped or ground meat, cooked with sauteed vegetables in a liquid. The meats may include one or more of beef, chicken, pork, duck, goose, lamb, mutton, veal, or game, including their offal. The liquids can be broth, stock, water, wine, milk, cream or tomato, often in combination. If tomatoes are included, they are typically limited relative to the meat, making it a meat stew rather than a tomato sauce with added meat.\n\nIn southern Italian regions, ragù is often prepared from substantial quantities of large, whole cuts of beef and pork, and sometimes regional sausages, cooked with vegetables and tomatoes. After a long braise (or simmer), the meats are removed and may be served as a separate course without pasta. Examples of these dishes are \"ragù alla Napoletana\" (Neapolitan ragù) and \"carne al ragù\".\n\nEtymologically speaking, the term comes from the French \"ragoût\" and reached the region of Emilia-Romagna in the late 18th century, perhaps following Napoleon's 1796 invasion and occupation of those northern regions. Prior to that time, peninsula cuisine had a long history of meat stews going back to the Renaissance period. However, they were neither known as ragù nor is there any record of pairing them with pasta. Starting in the 16th century, it was not uncommon for pasta to be cooked in and served with a meat broth, often like a simple soup, from which the meat was removed and served separately, if eaten at all.\n\nThe first documented recipe for a meat sauce, in which the cooked meat was an integral part of the sauce served with pasta, dates from the end of the 18th century. The first ragù as a sauce, \"ragù per i maccheroni\", was prepared and recorded by Alberto Alvisi, the cook to the Cardinal of Imola (at the time \"maccheroni\" was a general term for pasta, both dried and fresh). The recipe was replicated and published as \"Il Ragù del Cardinale\" (The Cardinal's Ragù).\n\nAfter the early 1830s, recipes for ragù appear frequently in cookbooks from the Emilia-Romagna region. By the late 19th century, the use of heavy meat sauces on pasta was common on feast days and Sundays only with the wealthier classes of the newly unified Italy, given the expense of meat.\n\nIndependent research by Kasper and De Vita indicates that, while ragù with pasta gained popularity through the 19th century, it was largely eaten by the wealthy. However, technological advances that came with the industrial revolution at the end of the 19th century made pasta flour more affordable for the less affluent. The adoption of pasta by the common classes further expanded in the period of economic prosperity that followed World War II. According to De Vita, before World War II, 80% of the Italian rural population ate a diet based on plants; pasta was reserved for special feast days and was then often served in a legume soup.\n\n\n"}

Bush on July 9, 2005. The law amends the Communications Act of 1934, significantly altering some aspects of prior amendments made by the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991 and the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003 as they relate to the issue of junk fax.\n\nCongress first addressed the issue of junk faxes in the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991 (TCPA). Although this legislation dealt broadly with larger issues of nuisance telemarketing tactics, it included provisions making it illegal for any person to send an unsolicited advertisement to a fax machine. The law further authorized the recipient of a fax sent in violation of the statute (or a regulation promulgated under the statute) to sue the sender in state court to enjoin further violation, recover for actual monetary losses from such a violation, $500 in statutory damages for each violation (whichever is greater), or both. The law also allows the court, in its discretion, to treble these damages if it finds the defendant violated the statute \"willfully\" or \"knowingly.\"\n\nAfter the bill was enacted, many companies that continued to send junk faxes were sued, often for substantial sums. The most well-known sender of junk faxes, fax.com, was repeatedly sued by government agencies and private individuals. Most notably, the company found itself faced with a $2.2 trillion suit filed by anti-junk fax crusader Steve Kirsch. The company was eventually forced out of business, though the fax.com website has since been purchased by an unrelated company. As a result, many companies moved across the border into Canada or Mexico, or set up operations overseas to continue broadcasting into the United States.\n\nTo counter this, Congress made a small but significant amendment to the statute in the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003 (Public Law No. 108-187). This amendment made it illegal for sending junk faxes from within the United States, but also if they were sent into the United States from outside the country.\n\nThe U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) also promulgated regulations under the TCPA. Most of these regulations were designed to reduce the liability of senders of junk faxes. For instance, the FCC created an exemption for fax broadcasters similar to the \"common carrier\" exceptions created for telephone companies and an exemption for advertisements sent to recipients with whom the sender had an existing business relationship (\"EBR\") if the sender included a proper opt out clause. While many defendants in junk fax suits attempted to rely on these regulations, they were almost uniformly unsuccessful because courts repeatedly ruled that the FCC had been without statutory authority to create such exceptions.\n\nThe Junk Fax Prevention Act of 2005 made small but significant changes to the TCPA. Most notably, it amended the statute to legislate the EBR exemption previously promulgated by the FCC. However, the bill was not amended to authorize the FCC's so-called \"common carrier\" exemption.\n\nUnder the Junk Fax Prevention Act of 2005, the sender of an unsolicited advertisement sent to a person's fax machine is still liable for a minimum of $500 per page, and damages may also be trebled at the court's discretion upon a finding that the violation was willful or knowing. A \"willful\" violation is simply one that is \"volitional\", while a \"knowing\" violation is one that occurs when the senders actually knew \"or should have known\" that he was potentially breaking a law, even without specific knowledge of the law.\n\nThe statute is one of strict liability; even if one sends an unsolicited advertisement by fax by accident, minimum liability of $500 per page attaches. The only real defense for the sender is that the transmission was protected by the EBR exception created by the Junk Fax Prevention Act of 2005. To qualify the sender: \n\nFailure to comply with all of these requirements leaves the sender liable for a violation of the statute, and unable to claim protection under this exception. See Par. 8(C)(iii).\n\nAdvertisers and fax broadcasters welcomed the JFPA as providing a means of advertising to existing customers. They point out that before the JFPA, companies could not legally send regular customers advertisements and notices of special discounts via fax. Under the amended statute, the EBR exception allows them to do this.\n\nOn the other hand, advocates for consumers and small businesses have also been harshly critical of the JFPA. Critics point out that the bill \"for the first time in history... legalized the taking of your property from you without your consent by another person or private entity.\" They note that, even when companies send notices that could potentially save the recipients money, the senders are still doing so with the expectation that they will make sales and they are advertising for these sales by stealing the paper, supplies, and time of the recipients. Some have gone so far as to rename the JFPA the \"Junk Fax Protection Act of 2005\".\n\nDefendants in civil suits brought pursuant to this statute often argue they have the affirmative defense of the \"established business relationship.\" Yet, as is often proven in Court, the defense fails if the Defendant did not comply with 21 FCC Rcd 3787, i.e. that a valid \"Opt-out\" clause was part of the offending fax. If there is no valid opt-out clause, the defendant cannot take advantage of the affirmative defense of an \"established business relationship.\" \n\n\n"}

All but one of the stories (\"Come Live With Me\") had previously been published elsewhere, in Science fiction magazines or anthologies. It is copyrighted to “the Estate of Alice B. Sheldon” and was first published in 1988 by Tom Doherty Associates. \"Crown of Stars\" is 340 pages in length. Here we have ten short stories that generally represent Sheldon’s last contributions to literature, said to include her final burst of creativity.\n\nThe first two stories in \"Crown of Stars\": “Second Going” and “Our Resident Djinn” are about God, gods, and the death of God. “Second Going” is the collection’s centerpiece, a true science fiction classic. Narrated as a documentary from NASA’s chief archivist, we learn of humanity’s First Contact. Interstellar-wandering, telepathic aliens contact Earth after we launch our first manned mission to Mars, stating that they will meet with the astronauts once they arrive. The Angli (large, blue cephalopods) turn out to be benevolent, if technologically simple, space tourists. They are interested in spending several months exploring Earth, then moving on. They are puzzled, though, by the lack of living gods on Earth; which exist on every other planet they have visited.\n\n\"Our Resident Djinn,\" on the other hand, opens cold with the death of God. Satan has just gotten the news of his rival's death from an angelic messenger and decides the best thing would be for him to fly up to the heavenly kingdom to pay his last respects to his old adversary. St. Peter gives Satan a tour of the empty capitol, which is to be sold off piecemeal in a sort of divine Chapter 7 Bankruptcy.\n\nBasically, this is the tale of a 16-year-old black girl living in a right-wing, dystopian future California. After being raped, she has no choice but to become a single mother, since abortions are illegal. She is forced to give her baby up for adoption, since she cannot afford to feed two.\n\n“All This and Heaven Too,” on the other hand, is a pleasant tale about young lovers, fairy-tale geopolitics, and ridiculous court intrigue. Set in a happy, utopian kingdom and an adjacent polluted, industrial kingdom, the principalities’ heirs fall in love.\n\nThe US is fighting a full-fledged war in Latin-America and the Congressional Armed Services Committee is on a tour of the front and will soon stop at a field hospital to visit the wounded. Soldiers are encouraged to take government-issued drugs (mainly amphetamines) to become remorseless killing machines. A soldier is recovering from a landmine explosion in this field hospital and it quickly becomes clear that drug withdrawal is a far more serious concern than his wounds.\n\nThe sixth story, \"Come Live With Me,\" is one of the last stories written by Tiptree. It is the only story in this collection regarding the far future and deep space. It's a quick, simple tale of a deep-space exploration crew's encounter with a mind-controlling lily, mainly from the plant's perspective. The plant has never encountered a being more intelligent than a space beaver, so meeting humans and their egos is a big change.\n\nBoth are about humans who are transformed into Death’s servants.\n\nThe tale of a riches-to-rags debutante, Diane, who temporarily changes places with her future self. A few months after this was written, Alice Sheldon shot her husband, then herself, in their bed, which was somewhat prefigured by the story.\n\n\"The Earth Doth Like a Snake Renew,\" is a reversal of the earlier Tiptree story, \"The Last Flight of Doctor Ain,\" her first widely acclaimed piece. In this story, the Earth is male and the main character is a young woman named \"P.\" P is in love with the Earth and obsessively desires to find a way to physically consummate that love. She is also a submissive masochist. The relationship between the two is portrayed as abusive, with the Earth harming and manipulating the protagonist, while simultaneously providing for her. Ultimately, the Earth is shown to not truly love her, but, rather, to love another planetoid. This planetoid crashes into the Earth, knocking it off its orbit and killing all life, including P. Just as the love was one directional, so was the power.\n\n\"Crown of Stars\" received a nomination for the 1989 Locus Award for Best Collection. The story \"Come Live with Me,\" the only original story in the collection, was the winner of the Hayakawa Award for foreign short story in 1997.\n"}

The product is (substituted) \"cis\"-1,2-dihydroxycyclohexadiene, which is subsequently converted to (substituted) benzene glycol by a \"cis\"-diol dehydrogenase.\n\nA large family of multicomponent mononuclear (non-heme) iron oxygenases has been identified. Components of bacterial aromatic-ring dioxygenases constitute two different functional classes: hydroxylase components and electron transfer components. Hydroxylase components are either (αβ) or (α) oligomers. Two prosthetic groups, a Rieske-type [FeS] center and a mononuclear iron, are associated with the α-subunit in the (αβ)-type enzymes. Electron transfer components are composed of flavoprotein (NADH:ferredoxin oxidoreductase) and Rieske-type [FeS] ferredoxin. In benzoate and toluate 1,2-dioxygenase systems, a single protein containing reductase and Rieske-type ferredoxin domains transfers the electrons from NADH to the hydroxylase component. In the phthalate 4,5-dioxygenase system, phthalate dioxygenase reductase (PDR) has the same function. PDR is a single protein comprising FMN-binding reductase and plant-type ferredoxin domains. Thus, the electron transfer in ARHD systems can be summarised as:\n\n benzene 1,2-dioxygenase\n\nThe crystal structure of the hydroxylase component of naphthalene 1,2-dioxygenase from \"Pseudomonas\" has been determined. The protein is an (αβ) hexamer. The β-subunit belongs to the\nα+β class. It has no prosthetic groups and its role in catalysis is unknown. The α-subunit can be divided into two domains: a Rieske domain that contains the [FeS] center and the catalytic domain that contains the active site mononuclear iron. The Rieske domain (residues 38-158) consists of four β-sheets. The overall fold is very similar to that of the soluble fragment of the Rieske protein from bovine heart mitochondrial cytochrome \"bc\" complex. In the [FeS] center, Fe1 is coordinated by two cysteine residues (Cys-81 and Cys-101) while Fe2 is coordinated by N atoms of two histidine residues (His-83 and His-104). The catalytic domain belongs to the α+β class and is dominated by a nine-stranded antiparallel β-sheet. The iron of the active site is located at the bottom of a narrow channel, approximately 15 Å from the protein surface. The mononuclear iron is coordinated by His-208, His-213, Asp-362 (bidentate) and a water molecule. The geometry can be described as a distorted octahedral with one ligand missing. The structure of the hexamer suggests cooperativity between adjacent α-subunits, where electrons from the [FeS] center in one α-subunit (A) are transferred to the mononuclear iron in the adjacent α-subunit (B) through Asp-205, which is hydrogen-bonded to His-104 of the Rieske center and His-208 of the active site.\n\n\n"}

Only eighth notes (quavers) or shorter can be beamed. The number of beams is equal to the number of flags that would be present on an unbeamed note. Beaming refers to the conventions and use of beams. A primary beam connects a note group unbroken, while a secondary beam is interrupted or partially broken.\n\nThe span of beams indicates the rhythmic grouping, usually determined by the time signature. Therefore, beams do not usually cross bar lines or major subdivisions of bars. If notes extend across these divisions, this is indicated with a tie. It is basically a line that joins notes together. A single eighth note, or any faster note, is always stemmed with flags, while two or more are usually beamed in groups.\n\nIn modern practice, beams may span across rests in order to make rhythmic groups clearer.\n\nIn vocal music, beams were traditionally used only to connect notes sung to the same syllable. In modern practice it is more common to use standard beaming rules, while indicating multi-note syllables with slurs.\n\nNotes joined by a beam usually have all the stems pointing in the same direction (up or down). The average pitch of the notes is used to determine the direction – if the average pitch is below the middle staff-line, the stems and beams usually go above the notehead, otherwise they go below.\n\nThe direction of beams usually follows the general direction of the notes it groups, slanting down if the notes go down, slanting up if the notes go up, and level if the first and last notes are the same.\n\nFeathered beaming shows a gradual change in the speed of notes. It is shown with a primary straight beam and other diagonal secondary beams (that together resemble a feather, hence the name). These secondary beams suggest a gradual acceleration or deceleration from the first note value within the feathered beam to the last. The longest value possible to show being the eighth note (quaver). When the number of notes played is not of interest, but rather the effect of acceleration or deceleration, an approximate number of headless stems are used. To ensure clarity, sometimes the number of notes within the beam, or the duration of the total beamed notes, is shown above the music, as is done with tuplets.\n\nBeams are also used as a notational abbreviation to indicate tremolos and reiterations. If used for those purposes, a note, or pair of notes, of any value can be beamed.\n"}

Ross Lederman, scripted by Karl Brown and David Silverstein from a story by Richard English and released as a low-budget programmer by Columbia Pictures on August 6, 1940. It is one of numerous military-school or patriotic-adventure-themed, quickly-produced second features for a primarily juvenile audience, which every studio rushed before the cameras following the September 1939 outbreak of war in Europe and, subsequently, the Selective Training and Service Act of 1940, passed by Congress on September 14 and signed by President Franklin Roosevelt on September 16.\n\nStarting in November 1939 with Warners' \"On Dress Parade\", which became better known as \"The Dead End Kids on Dress Parade\", virtually all male adolescents working in Hollywood were put through their on-screen paces. Tommy Kelly and Jackie Moran who had starred as Tom and Huck in 1938's \"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer\" appeared in \"Military Academy\" and 1939's \"The Spirit of Culver\", respectively. \"Culver\", another version of the military-school classic, \"Tom Brown of Culver\", starred former child stars Jackie Cooper and Freddie Bartholomew, who were also being cast in other similar productions. Bartholomew's next titles, in fact, were \"Naval Academy\", \"Cadets on Parade\" and \"Junior Army\".\n\n\"Military Academy\" presents top-billed Tommy Kelly as a fifteen-year-old sent to the title institution under an assumed surname, because his father, a well-known crime figure, although now reformed, has made the family name so notorious that his relatives find it difficult to relate to society at large once the truth becomes known. At the school he makes friends with two other misfits — second-billed Bobby Jordan, primarily known as a key member of the Dead End Kids acting ensemble, but here revising his usual character to portray a cocky champion athlete whose self-aggrandizing behavior alienates him from most fellow cadets, and third-billed David Holt who played the pampered sissy and prissy cousin Sid Sawyer to Tommy Kelly's Tom in the 1938 film, and was again cast as a similar type, an overprotected son of a wealthy family who cannot adjust himself to the strict regimen. Fourth-billed Jackie Searl, at nineteen, playing a senior cadet, had the longest career among the junior cast members, with credits going back to the beginning of sound in 1929, almost always portraying sneaky, nasty, pampered, disagreeable kids, including an earlier prototype of cousin Sid to Jackie Coogan's Tom in the 1930 \"Tom Sawyer\" and its 1931 sequel, \"Huckleberry Finn\". True to form, his upperclassman character immediately becomes the nemesis of the three younger boys. At midpoint, Tommy Kelly's family name is exposed and he faces ostracism from fellow cadets, except for his two friends who continue to support him. Ultimately, however, all the boys prove themselves to be fine, upstanding, patriotic young Americans on the eve of World War II.\nThe remaining cast members are Don Beddoe as Tommy Kelly's former-gangster father, Jimmy Butler as Cadet Dewey, Walter Tetley as Cadet Blackburn and Earle Foxe, Eddie Dew and Warren Ashe as the officers in charge, Major Dover, Captain Kendall and Captain Banning, respectively. Last-billed, and introduced to Tommy Kelly in the final scene as David Holt's appealing sister, Marjorie, is fifteen-year-old Joan Brodel who, rechristened Joan Leslie, would be launched by Warner Bros. as an ingenue and, subsequently, leading lady of the 1940s in a film released five months after \"Military Academy\", \"High Sierra\".\n\n\n"}

The Capitol is at the intersection of Apalachee Parkway and South Monroe Street in downtown Tallahassee, Florida.\n\nSometimes called \"The Old Capitol,\" the Historic Capitol, built in 1845, was threatened with demolition in the late 1970s when the new capitol building was built. Having been restored to its 1902-version in 1982, the Historic Capitol is directly behind the new Capitol building. Its restored space includes the Governor's Suite, Supreme Court, House of Representatives and Senate chambers, rotunda, and halls. Its adapted space contains a museum exhibiting the state's political history, the Florida Historic Capitol Museum, which is managed by the Florida Legislature. On April 18, 2012, the AIA's Florida Chapter placed the Historic Capitol Building (Restoration) on its list of \"Florida Architecture: 100 Years. 100 Places\".\n\nThe New Tower houses executive and legislative offices and the chambers of the Florida Legislature (consisting of the Florida Senate and Florida House of Representatives).\n\nThe Florida Department of Management Services maintains the Capitol Complex, which is open to the public Monday through Friday, 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. (excluding state holidays).\n\nThe buildings are universally, though informally, known as the Old Capitol and the New Capitol; the former is sometimes called the Historic Capitol, or also, confusingly, the Florida State Capitol. The latter was its official name prior to the construction of the New Capitol in 1977, and was so called by the National Park Service even after the New Capitol was operating. Its legal name today, however, is the Florida Historic Capitol Museum. The New Capitol, as a whole, does not have a legal name. When it was planned, the Capitol Complex (which is a legal name) was going to consist of the House and Senate chambers, and the twenty-two-story office building.\n\nTallahassee was named Florida's capital in 1824, midway between the then-largest cities in the state, St. Augustine and Pensacola. The first territorial government met in a log building. A capitol building was constructed in 1826 but never completely finished. It was torn down in 1839 to make room for the erection of the present structure, which was completed in 1845, just prior to Florida's entry into the United States as the 27th state. Several additions to the historic capitol have been made throughout the years. Frank Millburn made the first expansion in 1902 by adding the classical style dome. In 1923, Henry Klutho additions included two new wings and a marble interior. Finally, large wings for the House and Senate chambers were added to the north and south ends of the building in 1936 and 1947, respectively.\n\nThe 1902 Capitol building was the last statehouse in which all of Florida's political business was housed under one roof. A decade later, the Florida Supreme Court moved into its own building. Florida's current Supreme Court building is just west of the Capitol Complex, across S. Duval Street.\n\nThe 1960s were a time of political renewal in Florida that led to the Constitution of 1968 and the end of the Pork Chop Gang. The thrust of the renewal was to force conservative, north Florida politicians to cede power to the greatly expanded (in population and economic power) central and south Florida, until then seriously underrepresented in the legislature. As part of this discussion, the possible relocation of Florida's capital (convenient only to the north Floridians) closer to the state's center of population was considered.\n\nA ballot question asked Florida voters to decide on the location of Florida's capital. Other major contenders were Ocala, Orlando, and Jacksonville. Through the ballot process, the voters decided the capital would remain in Tallahassee. The moment was \"ripe\" for spending money on state facilities in Tallahassee. A dividing line had been crossed. Florida was different, renewed, and a new capitol was psychologically appropriate.\n\nThe architects who designed the New Capitol were given the starting assumption the Old Capitol — which had to remain in use until the New Capitol was completed — would be removed. Therefore, the design of the New Capitol in no way reflected the style of the old one. The site design, also, was prepared under the assumption the space occupied by the Old Capitol would be vacant. Since the preservation movement did not begin until after the New Capitol had been competed, and the demolition was being prepared for, it was too late to make any changes to either the New Capitol or the site.\n\nThe Historic Capitol was saved through citizens' action led by Secretary of State Bruce Smathers and then wife Nancy McDowell. The efforts were successful and the building was restored to its 1902 appearance, the final House and Senate chambers having been demolished (though there are no surviving drawings or photographs to inform restoration of the interior). Architectural highlights include the elaborate art glass dome, red and white striped awnings, and a representation of the Florida State Seal over the entry columns.\n\nIn 2011, the Florida Department of Management Services, in conjunction with MLD Architects, began restoration of the Historic Capitol's cupola, which included new copper roofing, and Tallahassee's most photographed landmark unveiled its new dome in April 2012.\n\nThe Capitol Complex design was a joint venture of the architectural firms of Edward Durell Stone of New York City and Reynolds, Smith & Hills of Jacksonville. It was built according to Stone's signature style of \"Neoclassicism,\" with an ornate grill surrounding a white-columned box. The design symbolized the growth and development of Florida.\n\nThe Capitol is usually referred to as a twenty-two-story building with a height of 345 feet. However, including the 3 underground floors, it is a 25-story building (the 6th floor is only accessible through the freight elevator). The Governor and the Cabinet members have their offices on the Plaza Level of the Capitol. Floors two through four of the base structure of the Capitol are used for the chambers of the Senate and House of Representatives; the offices of the Senate President, Secretary and Sergeant at Arms; the House Speaker, Clerk, and Sergeant at Arms; some legislative committee offices and meeting rooms; and Member offices.\n\nThe Legislative Chambers are on the fourth floor with their respective public viewing galleries on the fifth floor. The floors between the observation deck and the first five floors are executive and legislative offices. There is a cafeteria on the lower level, a snack bar on the tenth floor, and the Florida Welcome Center just inside the west Plaza Level entrance. Florida Welcome Center staff conducts guided tours for groups of 15 or more and self-guided tours are available during business hours. The Senate office building and the House office building are each four stories high and on either end of Capitol Complex. The bridges on the 2nd and 3rd floors allow people to walk between the Capitol and office buildings. These buildings contain primarily committee meeting rooms and legislative offices. The Knott Building was attached to the Capitol by a skywalk in 1999. The west front is known formally as Waller Park, for Curtis L. Waller, Judge of the United States Circuit Court of Appeals. In 2003, the dolphin statue \"Stormsong\" by Tallahassee artist Hugh Nicholson was added within Waller Park's Florida Heritage Fountain.\n\nOn the northeast corner of the Capitol Complex is the Florida Sri Chinmoy Peace State Marker. East of the House Office Building is a replica of the Liberty Bell. The replica was a gift to the citizens of Florida as symbol of the 1950 United States Savings Bonds Independence Drive. Within the Capitol Courtyard is a memorial in remembrance of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., dedicated in 1984. South of the King Memorial is The Florida Fraternal Order of Police Law Enforcement Memorial (dedicated in 2000). The memorial has the names of law enforcement officers killed in the line of duty. Outside of the Senate Office Building is a monument dedicated to Floridians who have received the Purple Heart medal.\n\nOn the lawn of the Old Capitol sit two marble obelisks. The northern one is the Leon County Civil War Memorial; former Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum called for its removal. The other is a monument to Capt. John Parkhill. Capt. Parkhill was killed at Palm Hammock, Florida leading the Leon Volunteers in chase of members of the Seminole Nation. Slightly northwest of the Civil War obelisk is Old Capitol Historical Marker. A plaque designating the legislative act naming this area after Judge Curtis L. Waller is on the south wall of the west park entrance. The Florida Heritage Fountain (and Stormsong dolphin statue by Tallahassee artist Hugh Nicholson) sits in the center of Waller Park.\n\nThe Capitol Complex grounds are maintained by the Florida Department of Management Services.\n\nThe Plaza Level holds several items of note besides the offices of the Governor and the Cabinet. In the Rotunda, a copy of the State Seal cast in bronze is mounted on terra verde marble sits. This is not the current seal, but one in use when building was completed. It is surrounded by five smaller seals representing the nations and kingdoms that exerted sovereignty over all or parts of Florida (France, Spain, Great Britain, the Confederate States of America, and the United States). North of the Rotunda is the Florida Women's Hall of Fame and the Fallen Firefighters Wall of Honor. To the south are the Florida Artists Hall of Fame and a memorial for Florida's Medal of Honor recipients. Southwest of the Rotunda is the Heritage Chapel, an area designed to serve as a meditative space. Opposite to the Chapel is a plaque that states: \"This plaque is dedicated to Senator Lee Weissenborn whose valiant effort to move the Capitol to Orlando was the prime motivation for the construction of this building.\" The west Plaza Level is the Florida Welcome Center and the \"Images of the Sunshine State\" murals by Florida artist James Rosenquist. The Florida Welcome Center offers maps, brochures, including a self-guided tour pamphlet, and related information.\n\nThe public viewing galleries for the Florida House of Representatives and the Florida Senate are on the fifth floor. A series of murals of Florida's history by Christopher Still encircle the House chamber floor. Outside of the Senate galleries is the Five Flags Mural by Renee Faure depicting people from Florida history.\n\nThe Observation Deck is the top or twenty-second floor of the Capitol building. The deck is above the Plaza Level and above sea level. In the east wing is an art gallery featuring a rotating display of artwork by Florida resident artists and a series of bronze plaques on the inductees of the Florida Artists Hall of Fame. The southern side is the Freedom Shrine.\n\nThe capitol is home to the Florida Legislative Research Center & Museum, which features exhibits about Florida's legislative history. The archives include art, historic photographs, documents and oral histories. The Gallery at the Historic Capitol features changing exhibits of photographs from the museum.\n\n\n"}

Obolonskyi District encompasses territories far beyond of its historical neighborhood sharing the same name. It was formed on 3 March 1975 and initially called as Minskyi District. In 2001 it was renamed to its historical name. Its current population is 290,000 inhabitants.\n\nDuring Soviet rule of Ukraine, Kiev had 14 administrative districts. In the early 21st century, a new law was passed and the city's administrative division was reorganized into 10 districts with different borders and new names.\n\nThe Obolonskyi District encompasses the territories of the former Minskyi District and is still sometimes referred to by that name. It also includes the former town of Pushcha-Vodytsia that used to be part of the Podilskyi District. The name \"Obolon\" comes from the Old-Ukrainian word \"оболонь\" → \"болонь\" → \"болоньє\" (\"obolon' \" → \"bolon' \" → \"bolon'ye\"), which roughly translates as \"flood plain\" or an area that is being engulfed by water. The district was built up in the 1970s as a microdistrict in Kiev on the Obolon sands to satisfy the growth of the city. Due to the composition of the soil at the time, the majority of the buildings were at most nine stories tall, and few trees were planted when compared to other parts of the city. That and few other reasons originally made the district not very prestigious.\n\nWith the second construction period (2000–2005), the district has seen new, comfortable apartment buildings constructed closer to the Dnieper river and has become an attractive residential area. The new apartments are also much more expensive, although still cheaper than in the central parts of Kiev. The district was connected by metro in the 1980s, with a station \"Obolon\" opened on 5 November 1980.\n\nA yachting club for both kids and adults was opened in around 1990, and recently many of the Obolon lakes were cleaned up in order to make the area more attractive. The area closer to the Dnieper river is a popular relaxation place for Kiev residents. The area is also well known for the beer factory \"Obolon CJSC\".\n\nPark Natalka is among recreational spaces favored by Kiev residents. It is located along the Dnieper river.\n\n\n\n"}

Besides retail banking, insurance and asset management activities (in collaboration with daughter companies KBC Insurance NV and KBC Asset Management NV), KBC is active in, among other things, European debt capital markets, domestic cash equity markets and in the field of corporate banking, private banking, leasing, factoring, reinsurance, private equity and project and trade finance in Belgium, Central and Eastern Europe and elsewhere (mainly in Europe). KBC is an acronym for Kredietbank ABB Insurance CERA Bank (CEntrale RAiffeisenkas).\n\nThe parent company, KBC Group N.V., is one of the major companies and the second largest bancassurer in Belgium. It is the 18th largest bank in Europe by market capitalisation and a major financial player in Central and Eastern Europe, employing some 42,000 staff worldwide (of which more than half in Central and Eastern Europe) and serves 11 million customers worldwide (some 7 to 8 million in Central and Eastern Europe).\n\nThe group is controlled by a syndicate of core shareholders, and has a free float of approximately 60%. In the core shareholders, KBC Ancora controls 19%, MRBB (part of the Flemish farmers' association) controls around 11%, CERA (the largest cooperative in Wallonia) 3% and a group of industrialist families controls another 7%. The free float was chiefly held by a large variety of international institutional investors as of mid 2018. Its shares are traded on the Euronext exchange in Brussels.\n\nThe group's overall ambition is to be the reference in bank-insurance in all its core markets.\n\nThe private art collection of KBC bank is situated in the Rockox House in Antwerp.\n\nThe Catholic \"Volksbank van Leuven\", founded in 1889, was one of the earliest predecessors of the KBC Bank. Another predecessor was the \"Bremer Vorschussverein\", founded in 1889 and changed later into \"Bankverein Bremen AG\". In 1935, the banks \"Algemeene Bankvereeniging\" and \"Volksbank van Leuven\" merged with the \"Bank voor Handel en Nijverheid\" to create the Kredietbank. The Kredietbank would be the only Belgian financial institution under Flemish control which would survive the financial crisis of the great depression of the 1930s. Fernand Collin, who became president in 1938, conceived the business strategy which would lead to the growth of the bank. He defined the Kredietbank as an independent bank with a decidedly Flemish character which would be an instrument to further Flemish economic growth.\n\nDuring World War II, the bank would be able to expand its activities and grow its deposits from the Flemish middle class. After the war, because of the economic recovery, the Kredietbank, now the third largest bank in Belgium, was able to increase the number of operating branches in Flanders. The postwar growth strategy of the bank emphasised foreign expansion and the development of portfolio-management services for investors. The bank expanded into Luxembourg in 1949 with the \"Kredietbank S.A. Luxembourgeoise\" and into Wallonia with the establishment of the \"Crédit Général de Belgique\" in 1961.\n\nThe Kredietbank also expanded into Belgian Congo. It established a branch in Léopoldville in 1952. Then in 1954 it acquired Banque Congolaise pour l’Industrie, le Commerce, et l’Agriculture and renamed it Kredietbank-Congo, Ultimately it had four branches, one each in Léopoldville, Bukavu, Elizabethville and Stanleyville. Due the situation emerging after the independence of Belgian Congo in 1960, the bank discontinued its Congolese operations in 1966.\n\nIn the sixties, driven by increasing competition, the bank worked on the expansion of its branch network and improvement of consumer services. In 1966, the bank began building a foreign-correspondent network and the establishment of foreign branches in a number of countries. In 1970, together with six other European institutions, Kredietbank established the Inter-Alpha Group of Banks. The \"Kredietbank N.V.\" Bruxelles acquired the main part of the shares from the \"Bankverein Bremen AG\" since 1982. The branch in Bremen was renamed to \"Kredietbank-Bankverein AG\" in 1990.\n\nIn 1998, the Kredietbank merged with two financial institutions originating from the \"\" (E: Belgian Catholic Farmers Association), ABB-insurance (Assurances du Boerenbond Belge) and CERA (Centrale Raiffeisenkas) Bank, to form the 'KBC Bank and Insurance Holding Company'. Since then, the group has significantly expanded its activities, chiefly in Central and Eastern Europe. In 2005, KBC set another milestone by merging with its parent company, Almanij, and changing its name to .\n\nOver the past 2 decades, KBC built up a strong presence in many of the countries that joined the EU on 1 May 2004. More recently (2007), KBC made acquisitions in Bulgaria (DZI Insurance, DZI Invest and EIBANK), Romania (KBC Securities Romania, Romstal Leasing and INK Insurance Broker), Russia (Absolut Bank), Serbia (KBC Banka and Senzal, which became KBC Securities AD Beograd, Hipobroker, which became KBC Broker, and Bastion, which became KBC Securities Corporate Finance) and Slovakia (Istrobanka). In 2017, KBC acquired UBB and Interlease in Bulgaria.\n\nAfter receiving government support during the financial crisis, the bank embarked on a divestment programme to satisfy the requirements of the European Commission. As such, it sold several subsidiaries, including Centea, Fidea, Kredyt Bank, ADB, KBC Deutschland, Absolut Bank and KBL \"epb\" (Krediet Bank Luxembourgeoise), its network of European private banking subsidiaries. The divestment programme was completed in 2014 and the state aid entirely paid back by 2015, five years ahead of the agreed schedule.\n\nThe group now focusses on its six core countries: Belgium, The Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Bulgaria and Ireland.\n\nIn December 2016, KBC announced that it would acquire United Bulgarian Bank, making KBC the largest bank-insurance group in the country.\nIn February 2017, Ireland was defined as a new core market of KBC Group.\n\nKBC has been criticised for its investment policies regarding fossil fuels. According to a 2015 report by Belgian NGO Fairfin KBC invested US$2.4 billion between 2004 and 2014 through loans and emitting shares and obligations. In contrast the money allocated to renewable energy was only US$929 million.\n\nWhen KBC reviewed its sustainability policy in 2016, the Global Network of Non-governmental organisation cooperating in the field of private banks and sustainability, Banktrack published an analysis acknowledging progress made on fossil fuels, while criticising the exception for the Czech Republic where the bank continues to finance coal, saying “the new general restriction on coal is welcome and positive, however the exception applied to Czech coal companies is concerning.\"\n\nIn 2017 the Belgian Climate Coalition published a report charting the investments in fossil fuel of the four major banks in Belgium (KBC, ING, BNP Paribas and Belfius). In this report they attacked the exception for the Czech Republic as well,saying “the exceptions for coal activities in the Czech Republic don’t comply with the strict deadlines imposed by climate science.”\n\nKBC Group NV is the direct parent company of:\n\nAll other KBC Group companies are direct or indirect subsidiaries of these. The main ones are shown in the table:\nBEL = Belgium Business Unit, CZR = Czech Republic Business Unit, IMA = International Markets Business Unit, GRP = Group Centre.\n\nKBC Bank is the main subsidiary. Its first home market is Belgium, where it is one of the top three banks, with a 20-25% market share and over three million customers (counting the customers of the subsidiaries in Belgium).\nIts second home market is Central Europe, served via subsidiaries and investments in the Czech Republic (ČSOB), Slovakia (ČSOB and Istrobanka), Hungary (K&H Bank) and Bulgaria (CIBank and UBB Bank). In all of these countries, KBC Bank is a leading player by market share.\nIt also has a substantial presence in Ireland through its subsidiary KBC Bank Ireland (formerly IIB Bank), which is a major player in both the corporate and residential mortgage markets there. In all, KBC Bank has established a presence in some thirty countries around the globe.\n\nKBC Project Finance is a subsidiary of KBC Bank, and has been an active player in the non-recourse financing of projects since the early 1990s. Headquartered in Dublin, it also has professionals based in London, Brussels, New York, Hong Kong, and Sydney. Its main business lines are Energy and Infrastructure. This includes financing projects in sectors such as the oil & gas industry, power, renewable energy, and Public-Private Partnership. It has a portfolio in excess of US$5bn, financing approximately 250 projects worldwide.\n\nKBC Bank also has investment banking operations in Europe, US and Asia. A specialist arm called KBC Financial Products operates primarily in global convertible bonds; its branch in Japan is called KBC Securities Japan, which specialises in secondary equity broking, convertible bonds, warrants, and equity derivatives.\n\nKBL European Private Bankers is no longer a subsidiary of KBC since a sale was agreed to Precision Capital for a reported €1.05 billion.\n\nIn 2019, Harvard Business Review ranked KBC's CEO Johan Thijs as the 8th best performing CEO in the world.\n\n\n"}

The club were relegated again at the end of the 1978–79 season, but returned to Division One after finishing second in Division Two in 1980–81.\n\nIn 1985–87 Holker Old Boys were Division One runners-up, and the following season they won the league for the first time. The club were runners-up again in 1987–88, and after finishing fourth in 1990–91, they moved up to Division Two of the North West Counties League. A third-place finish in 1993–94 saw the club promoted to Division One. They were relegated back to Division Two after finishing bottom of Division One in 1998–99. Division Two was subsequently renamed Division One in 2008. In 2014–15 the club finished fifth in the division, qualifying for the promotion play-offs; they went on to lose 3–1 to Hanley Town in the semi-finals.\n\nThe club initially played on playing fields before moving to Rakesmoor Lane. The site had previously been used for an isolation hospital before becoming allotments. Floodlights were installed within two seasons of joining the North West Counties League in 1991. In 2003 a home match against F.C. United of Manchester was moved to Craven Park, the home ground of Barrow Raiders rugby league club, due to the anticipated size of the crowd; the attendance of 2,303 was a club record.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2181909", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2181909", "title": "Opus III (band)", "text": "Opus III (band)\n\nOpus III was an English electronic music group who had success on the UK Singles Chart and on the U.S. Dance charts. The group consisted of vocalist Kirsty Hawkshaw and producers/musicians Kevin Dodds, Ian Munro and Nigel Walton. The group members promoted a strong environmental and feminist message through their lyrics, album liner notes and photo and video imagery. Their biggest hit was \"It's a Fine Day\", which reached number five in the United Kingdom in February 1992.\n\nPrior to the forming of Opus III, Dodds, Munro, and Walton, who were members of the Spiral Tribe, signed with Capitol Records UK under the name A.S.K. The act released their first single “Kiss and Tell,” in 1988. Afterwards, the trio signed with MCA Records UK, where they released their next single, \"Dream,\" in 1990, peaking at number 85 on the UK singles chart. The group later released a third single, “Freedom We Cry,” in 1991.\n\nIt was during the fall of 1990 that they noticed a rave dancer that they would add to the act as their visual dancer and afterwards become their lead singer, Kirsty Hawkshaw. The group would eventually become Opus III in 1992. During their tenure as a group, Hawkshaw was the only member that was visible in the music videos and television performances due to the other three members still being under contract to MCA. Once they were released from the label, the other members remained in the background, with the exception of live concert shows.\n\nTheir debut album, \"Mind Fruit\", produced the track \"It's a Fine Day\", a cover of a 1983 single by Jane, which topped the U.S. Hot Dance Club Play chart in 1992 and reached number five on the UK Singles Chart.\n\nThe song, now considered a house music classic, is the basis of Orbital's 1992 track \"Halcyon\" and its album version \"Halcyon + On + On\" included in their second eponymous album; the \"la la la\" section of the \"It's A Fine Day\" chorus was backmasked and sampled throughout the song. Hawkshaw appeared in the video for \"Halcyon\" playing a housewife who was 'under the influence'.\n\nThe other single release from \"Mind Fruit\" was \"I Talk To The Wind\", a cover of the 1969 song by King Crimson. This was not a big chart success in the UK, only reaching number 52.\n\nOpus III's second album \"Guru Mother\" surfaced in 1994 and produced another U.S. number-one dance song \"When You Made The Mountain\". A third dance chart entry, \"Hand in Hand (Looking for Sweet Inspiration)\" hit number 14.\n\nThe group disbanded after their second album. Hawkshaw was worried the project was becoming too commercial, which is one of the reasons for the band's separation (she has ruled out a reunion as well). Hawkshaw went on to pursue a solo career, lending her vocals to a number of electronic and dance music artists and tracks into the opening years of the 21st century, including Delerium, Silent Poets, BT, DJ Tiësto and again with Orbital.\n\n\n\n"}

Grayson translation of the Nabonidus Chronicle based on that of T.G. Pinches, considers both the names \"Ugbaru\" and \"Gubaru\" found in the latter to be references to this Gobryas. However the names are distinct in the text and refer to two different individuals, the one called \"Gubaru\" being the ruler placed over Babylon thus corresponding to Cyaxares of the Cyropedia (and the Darius the Mede of the Bible) not Gobryas. \"Ugbaru\" remains a candidate for Gobryas being described as the ruler of the region of Gutium dying soon after the conquest of Babylon similarly to Xenophon's portrayal of Gobryas as an elderly \"Assyrian\" ruler.\nAccording to William H. Shea Ugbaru and Gubaru is the same person, being the ruler placed over Babylon, dying soon after the conquest of Babylon.\n\nThis Gobryas was one of the six helpers of Darius in killing Gaumāta in September 522 mentioned by Herodotus. He was appointed as Darius' lance carrier (arštibara). He is represented on the Behistun inscription and on Darius' tomb in Naqsh-e Rustam, as:\nGaubaruva \\ Pâtišuvariš \\ Dâra\nyavahauš \\ xšâyathiyahyâ \\ arštbara\n\"Gobryas from Pâtišuvariš, the lance carrier of king Darius.\"\n\nPâtišuvariš may be the mountainous region north of Alborz in northern Iran, probably Mazandaran. In 521, he was sent to Elam to defeat the rebel king Atamaita; after this, he served as satrap of Elam.\n\nGobryas' family was closely entwined with the family of Darius the Great. Gobryas married the sister of Darius, known variously as Artazostre or Radušdukda. Their son Mardonius, was the Commander-in-Chief of the armies of Xerxes I in the Second Persian invasion of Greece, married Darius' daughter Artazostre. A daughter of Gobryas, from an earlier marriage, was married to Darius.\n\n\n"}

The Poqueira and the Trevélez join shortly before the confluence with the Cádiar near the town of Órgiva. The river flows through the region of La Alpujarra for much of its course and enters the sea near Motril after passing through a spectacular gorge between the Lújar and Chaparal mountains. Although it is often dried up by this point, its waters are often used for agricultural purposes. The Rules dam was recently built across the river near Vélez de Benaudalla at the head of the gorge, resulting in the creation of a large reservoir and the flooding of a section of the river valley.\n\n"}
{"id": "2181913", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2181913", "title": "Wind River Indian Reservation", "text": "Wind River Indian Reservation\n\nThe Wind River Indian Reservation is located in the central-western portion of the U.S. state of Wyoming, where Eastern Shoshone and Northern Arapaho Native American tribes currently live. Stretching roughly 60 miles east to west and 50 miles north to south, the Indian reservation is located in the Wind River Basin and includes portions of the Wind River Mountain Range, Owl Creek Mountains, and the Absaroka Mountains.\n\nThe total land area is ~2.2 million acres (3,473.272 square miles or 8,995.733 km²), and the land and water area is 3,532.010 sq mi (9,147.864 km²). The Wind River Indian Reservation is the seventh-largest Indian reservation in the United States by area, and the fifth-largest American Indian reservation by population. The reservation constitutes just over one-third of Fremont County and over one-fifth of Hot Springs County.\n\nThe 2000 census reported the population of Fremont County as 40,237 inhabitants. According to the 2010 census, only 26,490 people now live on the Reservation, with about 15,000 of the residents being non-Indians on ceded lands and the town of Riverton. Tribal headquarters are located at Fort Washakie. The Shoshone Rose Casino (Eastern Shoshone) and the Wind River Hotel and Casino, Little Wind Casino, and 789 Smoke Shop & Casino (all Northern Arapaho) are the only casinos in Wyoming.\n\nThe Shoshone have the longest prehistory in the area. Archaeologists have found evidence that unique aspects of the Tukudika Mountain Shoshone or Sheepeater material culture such as soapstone bowls were in use in this region from the early 1800s going back 1,000 to 3,000 years or more. People descended from the Mountain Shoshone band continue to live on the Wind River Indian Reservation.\n\nThe Dinwoody petroglyph style is indigenous to central Wyoming including the Wind River Basin and Bighorn Basin. Scholars believe that the Dinwoody petroglyphs most likely represent the work of ancestral Tukudika or Mountain Shoshone Sheepeaters. This is because some of the figures at Torrey Lake Petroglyph District and Legend Rock correspond to characters in Shoshone folklore, such as Pa waip, a water spirit woman.\n\nToday's Wind River Indian Reservation is located at the historical boundary region between the Great Basin culture of the Shoshone and the Great Plains tribal cultures. In recent centuries, the area was used by many tribes for hunting grounds and for raiding.\n\nAfter 1800, the historical record notes the presence of the Shoshone, as well as the Crow, Cheyenne, and Arapaho, Blackfeet and Lakota in the Wind River Basin. These latter tribes came to the area due to geopolitical forces, as well as for food resources: Trapper records after 1800 describe huge herds of tens of thousands of stampeding bison in the Wind River Basin, raising massive clouds of dust on the horizon.\n\nThe Shoshone largely controlled much of what is now western Wyoming in 1700s. This is because they were the first of the northern tribes to secure the horse from the Spanish and traders in the southwest. (The Arapaho played a similar role of introducing the horse to the Great Plains, through trade between the Spanish settlements along the Rio Grande and the agricultural tribes along the Missouri River.) The Shoshones dominance in what is now western Wyoming declined as other tribes like the Blackfeet acquired the horse and staged counter-raids. In the 1820s, the Shoshone started to regain power by trading for firearms in the Rocky Mountain Rendezvous Fur Trade in the Green River Basin, just over the Wind River Range from today's Wind River Indian Reservation.\n\nWith the onset of the fur trade, Shoshones could once again project their power east from the Snake River and Green River Valley to hunt buffalo on the plains. Increasingly they needed to hunt farther east, because the fur trade started to wipe out bison in the Green River Basin. In the 1830s and 1840s they are recorded as raiding in the Platte River, Powder River Basin, and the Laramie Plains. The Shoshone regularly used the Wind River Basin as winter range or as a route to hunting grounds in the Sweetwater, Bighorn Basin, Bighorn Mountains, or Powder River Basin.\n\nComing from the other direction, the post-1600s westward migration of Siouan and Algonquian-speaking brought new people onto the plains and traditional Shoshone territory of middle Rocky Mountains. The earliest of these midwestern, Missouri River, and Great Lakes tribes to migrate to the Great Plains include the Crow, Cheyenne, and Arapaho, though some sources say the Arapaho potentially occupied the Great Plains for 1,000 years. Most of these tribes were initially located on the Great Plains farther north and east of the Wind River area. The powerful and numerous Lakota were the last to push west in response to American expansion, bumping up against the earlier-migrating tribes, and then moving farther west into the Rocky Mountains. By the mid-1800s, all of these tribes would make incursions into the now-contested Wind River valley.\n\nShoshone place names include dozens of names in the Bighorn Basin, demonstrating a detailed knowledge of lands further east than the Wind River Basin as part of traditional Shoshone territory. Likewise, the Arapaho were familiar with the Wind River Basin, referring to Wind River/Bighorn River as Hotee Niicie, meaning \"mountain sheep river\", in reference to the numerous herds of the species in the area.\n\nBy the middle 1800s the Crow were largely dominant in the Wind River Valley and Absaroka Range, using the area as winter range, and fighting with Shoshones who came into the area. Crow Chief Arapooish mentioned the Wind River Valley as a preferred wintering ground with salt bush and cottonwood bark for horse forage in a speech recorded in the 1830s and published in Washington Irving's \"Adventures of Captain Bonneville\". Meanwhile, Washakie and his people avoided the Crow treaty lands in the Wind River Valley in the 1850s, preferring to hunt away from the emigrant trails and the Crow in places like Henry's Fork and Yellowstone.\n\nThe Crow dominance in the Wind River Valley, though secured as official Crow Territory under the Fort Laramie Treaty of 1851, effectively ended when Chief Washakie defeated a Crow chief in one-on-one fight at Crowheart Butte, sometime in the late 1850s or early 1860s. Washakie likely opted to challenge the Crow because the emigrant trails and increasing white settlement in Utah, Idaho, and Montana made it harder to hunt in those areas. This left the Crow-occupied Wind River Valley as the only place Washakie could use force to secure hunting grounds from a rival tribe without significantly opposing American interests.\n\nThe Crow legacy in the Wind River persists in the name of the Middle Fork Popo Agie River, pronounced poepoe-zhuh, which comes from the Crow word Poppootcháashe, an onomatopoeia meaning \"plopping river.\" The Crow word for the Green River, farther west, is Chiichkase Aashe of Seedskadee Aashe, meaning \"sage hen river.\"\n\nThe 1868 treaty at Fort Bridger Treaty Council of 1868 effectively designated the Wind River Valley as exclusive territory of the Shoshone, superseding the Crow's 1851 Fort Laramie treaty claims.\n\nIn 1872 the Shoshone agreed to sell part of the reservation to the U.S., establishing the North Fork of the Popo Agie River as a southern border. \n\nOriginally known as the Shoshone Indian Reservation, today's Wind River Indian Reservation was established by agreement of the United States with the Eastern Shoshone Nation at the Fort Bridger Treaty Council of 1868, restricting the tribe from the formerly vast Shoshone territory of more than 44 million acres. A later settlement and land transaction after United States v. Shoshone Tribe of Indians gave the Arapaho legal claim to the reservation, which was renamed as the Wind River Indian Reservation.\nThe Shoshone leader Washakie had a preference for the area, and had previously defeated the Crow in battle to hold the territory. As early as 1862, Indian Agent Luther Mann Jr. recommended creating a permanent reservation for the Shoshone. After prospectors discovered gold at South Pass in 1867, the United States Indian Agent sought to limit numerous tribes from raiding mining camps by placing the Shoshone reservation in the Wind River Valley as a buffer. The United States hoped that tribes like the Crow, Blackfeet, Cheyenne, Lakota, and Arapaho would attack their traditional Shoshone enemies instead of the miners. However, the area was too dangerous for the Shoshone to occupy year-round, so Chief Washakie kept his people closer to Fort Bridger for several years after 1868. Washakie's son was killed in a raid by enemy tribes, and the Oglalla Lakota leader Hump, a mentor of Crazy Horse, was killed fighting the Shoshone in the Wind River Basin.\n\nIntertribal conflicts occurred several times in the 1860s and 1870s in the Wind River region. The Arapaho briefly stayed in Wind River valley in 1870, but left after miners and Shoshones attacked and killed tribal members and Black Bear, one of their leaders, as they moved lodges. At another event, a combined force of Lakotas, Cheyennes, and Arapahos surrounded and attacked Washakie's camp at Trout Creek on the reservation. The Shoshones survived the attack by digging rifle pits inside their tepees, and then mounting a counterattack. The last significant conflict occurred in June 1874, when 167 Shoshones and U.S. cavalry attacked the Arapaho at the Bates Battlefield on head of Nowood Creek in the Bridger Mountains east of the Shoshone Indian Reservation.\n\nCamp Augur, a military post with troops named for General Christopher C. Augur, was established at the present site of Lander on June 28, 1869. (Augur was the General present at the signing of the Fort Bridger Treaty in 1868.) In 1870 the name of Camp Augur was changed to Camp Brown, and in 1871, the post was moved to the current site of Fort Washakie. The name was changed to honor United States ally and Shoshone Chief Washakie in 1878. The fort continued to serve as a military post until the US abandoned it in 1909. By that time, a community had developed around the fort.\n\nSacagawea, a woman guide with the Lewis and Clark Expedition of 1804-1806, was later interred here. Her son Jean Baptiste Charbonneau, who was a child on the expedition, has a memorial stone in Fort Washakie but was interred in Danner, Oregon.\n\nA government school and hospital operated for many years east of Fort Washakie; Arapaho children were sent here to board during the school year. St. Michael's at Ethete was constructed in 1917–1920. The village of Arapahoe was originally established as a US sub-agency to distribute rations to the Arapaho. At one time it also operated a large trading post. Irrigation was constructed to support farming and ranching in the arid region. The Arapaho constructed a flour mill near Fort Washakie. Separately, under the Dawes Act, communal tribal land was allotted to individual households, which could later be sold to non-tribal members, further diminishing the tribal land base.\n\nIn 1904 the Eastern Shoshone and Northern Arapaho ceded a portion of the reservation north of Wind river to the United States and opened to white settlement. The Riverton Reclamation Project and the city of Riverton developed on some of this land. Instead of a lump-sum payment or upfront purchase, the cession required the United States to pay the tribes for each area of land settled upon. Seeing that large parts of the ceded area were never taken up by settlers, the ceded portion of the reservation was later restored to the Eastern Shoshone and Northern Arapaho Tribes.\n\nIn the winter of 1878-1879, the United States Army escorted the Northern Arapaho to the Sweetwater Valley near Independence Rock and then temporarily placed them at the Shoshone's Fort Washakie Agency to receive rations. This decision to place the Arapaho in close proximity with their historic enemies the Shoshone has had significant historical and political consequences.\n\nThe former Arapaho and Cheyenne reservation under the Fort Laramie Treaty of 1851 encompassing much of eastern Colorado and southeast Wyoming had been overrun by whites after the Colorado gold rush of 1859. The Northern Arapaho then signed the Fort Laramie Treaty of 1868, giving them claim to locate in The Great Sioux Reservation, encompassing the western half of present-day South Dakota west of the Missouri River, and rights to hunt north of the Platte River in Wyoming so long as game remained.\n\nIn practice the Arapaho did not wish to locate permanently at an agency shared by the Sioux. They were belittled by leaders of the more powerful Sioux including Red Cloud, and wanted to avoid being culturally subsumed within the Lakota Nation. Instead, the Arapaho hoped for a reservation of their own. In 1868-1869, the Arapaho briefly sought to locate with the linguistically-related Gros Ventres at the agency on Milk River in Montana, but left after smallpox epidemic. Further, Arapaho priest and leader Weasel Bear had a vision that the Arapaho would find a permanent home closer to the Rocky Mountains, and not on the Great Plains. The Arapaho life way had historically included significant use of mountain hunting grounds, especially in the Colorado Rockies around Estes Park, but also including the Snowy Range, the Bighorns, the Black Hills, and the Laramie Range.\n\nTo seek favor of the Army, leaders Chief Black Coal (Northern Arapaho), Sharp Nose and their followers allied with Gen. Crook as scouts against their former allies the Cheyenne, participating in the November 1876 Dull Knife Fight on the side of the United States, along with Shoshone, Cheyenne, Sioux, and Pawnee scouts. Officers of the United States Army supported the idea of an Arapaho reservation in eastern Wyoming Territory — General Crook may have promised an agency on Tongue River. Yet federal policy prevented this from coming to fruition, partly because as the United States had essentially stopped negotiating reservation treaties with tribes after 1868, preferring instead to use executive orders in such agreements.\n\nIn 1878 the U.S. Army saw the onset of winter with roughly 1,000 hungry and impoverished Arapaho still averse to living near the Red Cloud Agency, at an agreed-upon agency of Fort Randall, or in Indian Territory with the Southern Arapaho. Chief Black Coal had previously visited the Southern Arapaho reservation on the Canadian River in Oklahoma, finding the location unacceptable. So, Army officers looked to Fort Washakie as the closest alternate agency for distributing rations, despite the fact that the Shoshone held treaty rights to decide what other tribes they were willing to admit to the reservation under the Fort Bridger Treaty Council of 1868.\n\nThe supposedly temporary placement of the Arapaho at Fort Washakie Agency became permanent because the United States government never took further action to relocate the tribe. The Arapaho held out hope for a reservation of their own until 1890, when Gen. Crook died. In late-1800s dealings including land cessions, the government repeatedly acted as if the Arapaho were a party of their reservation and its resources by including them in cession discussions like the sale of the Thermopolis Hot Springs. This was despite Shoshone protests (which were later held up in court) that the Arapaho had no legal claim to the reservation. According to historian Loretta Fowler, Arapaho leaders at the time were aware they had no real legal status to reservation land in the Wind River Valley. They participated in land cessions and allotment of reservation land in part to solidify their title and claims to the land.\n\nIt wasn't until the conclusion of the 1938 U.S. Supreme Court Case United States v. Shoshone Tribe of Indians that the government recognized it had wrongly given Shoshone land and resources to the Arapaho. A subsequent land deal then officially solidified Arapaho claim as half-owners of tribal lands and resources on Shoshone Indian Reservation, which was officially renamed the Wind River Indian Reservation.\n\nThis complicated history of the Arapaho arrival on the reservation continues to affect intertribal relations and politics on the reservation today. Over time, intermarriage between members of the two tribes has occurred, building connections between members of the historically-enemy tribes and encouraging political cooperation. Yet, efforts to maintain and exert independent sovereignty of each tribe remain a major dynamic on the reservation.\n\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, oil and gas operators on the Wind River Indian Reservation were found to be stealing oil from the Eastern Shoshone and Northern Arapaho. In a coordinated scheme, companies extracted oil and paid some production royalties to tribes, while also secretly collecting and selling a separate supply of oil for which they paid no royalties. The exposé led to reforms.\n\nOf the population in 2011, 3,737 were Shoshone and 8,177 were Arapaho. 1,880,000 acres of Tribal Land with 180,387 acres of Wilderness area, compared to the population in 2000, 6,728 (28.9%) were Native Americans (full or part) and of them 54% were Arapaho and 30% Shoshone. Of the Native American population, 22% spoke a language other than English at home.\n\nThe Wind River Indian Reservation established a 180,000-acre roadless area in the Wind River Range in the 1930s, several decades before the passage of the national Wilderness Act of 1964.\n\nThe tribes have re-established populations of big game, such as moose, elk, mule deer, whitetail deer, bighorn sheep and pronghorn antelope, and have passed hunting regulations to conserve these species. In November 2016 the Shoshone introduced ten bison to the reservation, the beginning of what is planned as a 1000-head herd. They were the first bison to be seen on the Wind River Reservation since 1885. Area suited as buffalo habitat is estimated at 700,000 acres on the west side and another 500,000 acres on the north of the reservation.\n\nThe Northern Arapaho established a bison herd in 2019. \n\nFacilities for tourism include hotels located at the Wind River Casino and the Shoshone Rose Casino. There are numerous cultural centers and interpretive displays at the Eastern Shoshone Cultural Center and library at Fort Washakie School, as well as the Northern Arapaho Experience Room at the Wind River Hotel and Casino. The Museum of the Rockies in Lander hosts weekly powwow dancing demonstrations during the summer.\n\nThe Wind River Indian Reservation allows access for fishing and hiking for non-tribal members who purchase a tribal fishing license available from local retailers. The license allows access to fishing lands on the southern half of the reservation, including in the tribal roadless area that encompasses part of the dramatic Wind River Range. Hikers and mountaineers seeking the closest approach to Gannet Peak can hire a guide to drive into a trailhead. The reservation licenses contractors in Thermopolis to offer whitewater rafting and fishing outfitting in the spectacular Wind River Canyon.\n\nThe Wind River Country, the wide expansion of land on which the Wind River Reservation resides, also provides opportunities for visitors to see and participate in important cultural experiences.\n\nScheduled powwows are available to attend by the public. There are three larger celebrations throughout the year in the Wind River County, including the Eastern Shoshone Powwow in June, the Ethete Celebration in July, and the Northern Arapaho Powwow in September. Beginning on Friday nights, these ceremonies are an important aspect of Native American culture, that involve feasting, singing and dancing. Saturday and Sundays also have Powwow festivities.\n\nAn important aspect of the powwow is showcasing the regalia of the dancers. Each piece is personally significant to the dancer, uniquely handmade, utilizing feathers, shells, bones, beadwork and sometimes family heirlooms. The dances performed are traditional dances, unique to the tribe they belong to, as is the music. The spectacle is described on the Wind River Country's tourism website, telling prospective visitors “If you close your eyes for a second the music will sweep you away, Drumming and singing accompanies all dancing and the drumbeat is considered sacred, representing the heartbeat of the tribe. Each thumping note carries songs to the Great Spirit, along with the prayers of the people.” The website also advertises the Powwows as being free admission.\n\n\nCurrent social and economic conditions on the Wind River Indian Reservation have complicated historical roots. The reservation has many examples of cultural survival, adaptation, and patriotism. Yet, the reservation community also suffers from the legacy of settler colonialism, dispossession from land, forced assimilation and cultural destruction, family disruption, environmental extraction and degradation, disenfranchisement, and inter-generational poverty. Though media portrayals produced by outsiders frequently note these disparities, tribal members have publicly objected to such narratives, noting that they are not the whole story of life in reservation communities.\n\nHigh Country News tribal desk editor Tristan Ahtone (Kiowa) used Wind River media coverage by the New York Times, CNN, and Business Insider as examples of simplistic negative narratives that future journalists can work to disrupt through accurate portrayals of Native American realities, both good and bad.\n\nA decades-old study conducted titled, Delinquency Among Wind River Indian Reservation Youth, showed that large amounts of the Reservation's youth were charged with a variety of crimes. This study shows that from the years 1967-1971, 1,047 juvenile cases were examined by the Court of Indian Offenses on the Reservation. 693 of the 1,047 cases dealt with delinquency, with 470 of these cases involving a young male defendant. The distribution of juvenile charges showed that 251 of 917 total charges involved alcohol-related crimes (public intoxication, minor in possession, and driving under the influence).\n\nIn 2009, three young Native American girls (13, 14, and 15 years of age) were murdered on the Reservation. They were found in the bedroom of a small home in Beaver Creek, which is a low-income tribal housing community. They had overdosed on methadone, a painkiller which is used to wean heroin addicts off of heroin. However, no one knows how they received the painkillers, which is why the coroner ruled their deaths homicides. The Reservation has a very thin police force, which led to the FBI being the lead investigators on the homicide. The Reservation has six officers who are responsible for patrolling an area about the size of Rhode Island. Two teenage boys were arrested in connection with the girls' deaths. One boy had given them his grandmother's methadone, saying that the girls were already high and he wanted to help them, because they didn't want to go home and have their parents see them.\n\nIn the early 21st century, the media reported problems of reservation poverty and unemployment, resulting in associated crime and a high rate of drug abuse.[9] In 2012, the New York Times released an article titled, \"Brutal Crimes Grip an Indian Reservation\". According to this article, written by Timothy Williams, an Iraq war strategy, \"the surge\", was used to attempt to fight crime taking hundreds of officers from the National Park Service and other federal agencies. This had major success at other reservations, but on the Wind River Indian Reservation, violent crime increased by seven percent. In 2013, Business Insider produced a photo scrapbook and indicated locals refer to different streets by infamously violent American locations such as Compton near Los Angeles.\n\nThe reservation was experiencing a methamphetamine crisis that has since been significantly reduced, even while addiction continues to be a problem. Other residents say the Wind River Indian Reservation is a more hopeful place than is often portrayed in press reports.\n\nThere are two outpatient clinics located on the reservation. There is one located in Arapahoe and the second one is located in Ft. Washakie. The clinics offer a variety of services such as Behavioral Health, Social Services, Business Office, Community Health Nursing, Purchased/Referred Care (PRC), Dental, Diabetes Program, Laboratory/Radiology, Medical Records, Medical Services, Nursing, Optometry, Office of Environmental Health, Utilization Review and Compliance. The average life expectancy for someone living on the reservation is 49 years old.\n\nAccording to \"A Suicide Epidemic in an American Indian Community\", a study done regarding suicide on the Reservation in 1985, the months of August and September produced very high suicide numbers. There were 12 reported deaths, and 88 additional verified instances of suicide threats or suicidal attempts. This epidemic among Native American tribes can be attributed to high unemployment and abuse of alcohol. 40 of the attempts were between the ages of 13-19, and 24 attempts were between the ages of 20-29. Of the 88 attempts, alcohol was involved in 47 cases, with 46 male and 42 females attempting suicide. Many events were created to attempt to stop this suicide epidemic that hit the Reservation. Parents, and elder community members, closed Bingo nights for children and hosted recreational activities instead. The schools extended hours for learning centers and gymnasiums. An alcohol treatment program began holding weekly alcohol-free teen dances, which were very popular and had a high attendance. These initiatives were designed to provide a safe, and alcohol-free, environment for the children and young adults. This ultimately helped the epidemic, and prevent suicide attempts across such young age groups.\n\nAn article published in 2001, \"The Social Construction of American Indian Drinking: Perceptions of American Indian and White Officials\", discovered, by qualitatively interviewing a small sample size of 12 Native Americans residing on the Reservation and 12 Whites who also reside on the Reservation, that alcoholism is present on the Reservation. 10 of 12 Natives have said that alcohol is a problem shared by both minors and adults, while all 12 Whites have said this. 10 of 12 American Indians said that alcohol is strongly linked to crime, while 11 of 12 Whites have agreed. The biggest outlier was that only 8 of 12 American Indians have said that alcohol is a very serious problem on the Reservation, while 11 of 12 Whites have said the same. In an article in Casper Star-Tribune, of the 79 deaths from 2004, a quarter of the deaths were attributed to alcoholic cirrhosis and half of the deaths were related to alcoholic deaths due to car crashes and homicide connected to drugs. According to Cathy Keene, local director for Indian Health Services, the reservation's situation has gotten to the point where the Public Health Service can only fund things that require emergency care. The lack of funding has resulted in less surgeries and medical procedures. The Ft. Washakie Health Center is only working with slightly more than half of its needed funding according to Richard Brannan, chief executive officer of the Indian Health Service.\n\nA study found that approximately 71% of the population is obese and 12% have diabetes, compared to the National average 36.5% and 9.4%. In 2009, the reservation received a five-year grant in funding from the Merck Foundation Alliance's for Reducing Diabetes Disparities (ARDD) to improve patient care, community clinical system of care, and clinicians. The ultimate goal of the funding is to find an ideal model or solution that can be repeated at other reservations to decrease the rate of diabetes. After receiving funding, the project team gathered other members who shared an interest in preventing and managing diabetes on the reservation. They recruited members of the Wind Reservation Coalition for Diabetes Management and Prevention, Wind River Indian Health Service, Fremont County Public Health, The University of Wyoming's Centsible Nutrition Program, Sundance Research Institute, and the State of Wyoming Department of Health's Diabetes Prevention program. These members help create focus groups consisting of residents from the reservation to understand the barriers and the issues with the health services. The group created a disease management program based on the Chronic Care Model which focused on looking at members with or at risk of diabetes views on diabetes. They created specific exercises and nutrition programs that took in account of the lifestyle and culture of the residents. For individuals that were already diagnosed, the program created a self-management education program. After the 5-year program, the results showed improved clinical outcomes. 47% of the participants saw a decrease in their HbA1c levels, improved diabetes management with a mean decrease of 1.12 points. Due to the success of the program, a two-year grant from the AstraZeneca Foundation proposed to help 350 reservation residents who are at risk for cardiovascular disease.\n\nOnly 60% of Native Americans complete high school, compared to 80 percent of the White students who graduate high school. The Wind River reservation dropout rate is 40 percent, more than twice the state average of Wyoming. Teenagers are twice as likely to commit suicide compared to other young adults within Wyoming. There are other issues that commonly occur on the reservation such as child abuse, teenage pregnancy, sexual assault, and domestic violence, and alcoholism. There was the death of an eighth grader at Wyoming Indian Middle School who was killed by voluntary manslaughter in April 2010. Wind River's crime rate is 5-7 times the national average, and has a history of gang violence. The Wind River Indian Reservation have struggled with an alarming percent of unemployment. According to a 2005 Bureau of Indian Affairs report, the Northern Arapaho Tribe's unemployment rate was 73 percent and Eastern Shoshone's was 84 percent. Other reservations have similar or higher rates of unemployment. There does seem to be a consensus on what some of the contributing factors are. One example is lack of adequate physical infrastructure—good roads and bridges, public water supply and sanitation facilities, and adequate education. The Wyoming Department of Education decided to collaborate with the North Central Comprehensive Center in order to improve the reservation's education system. They conducted multiple listening sessions within classes of different schools within the reservations. After the session, both parents and students came to the consensus that the Wind River reservation schools needed more teachers that are Native American. Also they advocated for more security in order to lessen bullying and gangs, and more Native American-relevant courses, such as their Native American Language. Lastly, students and parents wanted a standard for academic expectations that should be held within all schools within the reservation. One of the parents remarked \"My grandson goes to the school in Lander. We won't transfer him back here to the reservation because they're two years behind where my grandson is.\" Megan Degenfelder, Wyoming Department of Education Policy Advisor, said the inputs from the listening sessions has the department headed in the right track \"to improve education for Native American students and to best be able to allocate our resources and time.\"\n\nAccording to Folo Akintan's preliminary data, a medical doctor and epidemiologist from Rocky Mountain Tribal Epidemiology Center in Billings, Mont., 4 out of 10 Wind River Reservation residents reported that they have had a relative die from cancer. Many of the residents believe it's due to a uranium mill and contamination plume near St. Stephens. In 1958 Susquehanna-Western began processing uranium and vanadium ore on the reservation with sulfuric acid. Although the mill closed in 1963, there were tailings left behind. In 1988 the Department of Energy (DOE) found that soils, surface water and shallow groundwater were all contaminated. The DOE believes the land will naturally flush itself and be contamination free 100 years from now. In 2010, the DOE recorded levels of contamination 100 times higher than what is allowed by the USEPA Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL) for drinking water. Tribal officials were worried about their water sources being contaminated by these deadly toxins. The DOE placed plastic PVC for the water pipeline. They reassured the residents that it was secure and wouldn't break however Wind River Environmental Quality Commission officials state that the pipe has broken multiple times within the past year. The residents have become fed up with the DOE due to lack of cleaning up the land, poor pipeline equipment, and lack of spreading data about the high levels of contamination from flooding. Although it's hard to suggest that a uranium tailing site is causing an increased cancer rate, Dr. Akintan suggests, \"It is a risk indicator\". The cancer rates on the reservation are higher than the national and state average. Although Dr. Akintan's reports show an increased cancer rate, the research had many limitations. The first limitation was lack of responses returned. There was a total of 3,000 surveys and only 286 were completed. Also, the data collected was only self-reported data which is unreliable due to response bias from the participants. Also, the results were leading but not statistically significant.\n\nIn 1993, the Northern Arapaho Tribe on the Wind River Reservation began a relationship with a high school in Centennial, Colorado, to “[promote] awareness to the co-existence of two very diverse cultures”. Despite previous controversy, Arapahoe High School and the Arapaho Nation established an agreement, in which the tribe endorsed the school mascot, the “Arapahoe Warrior”. The image of the mascot used by the school was drawn by Northern Arapaho artist, Wilbur Antelope. The agreement also promised a long-standing relationship between the school and the tribe. Signed September 17, 1993, this proclamation allowed for the “Arapahoe Warrior” to become a reminder of Elder Anthony Sitting Eagle's words “Always take care of one another”, a phrase repeated often by students and faculty at Arapahoe High School.\n\nAs part of the agreement, Arapahoe High school and the Arapaho Nation alternate visiting each other every year. When the Arapaho tribe comes to visit the school, the daily activities are put on pause for an assembly. Arapahoe High School students accompany those visiting from the Wind River Reservation file into the large gymnasium, renamed in December 1994 after Arapaho Elder Anthony Sitting Eagle. Two cultures unite for a celebration, the Arapaho tribe performing traditional dances and the tribal leaders speaking to the students. When the students visit Wind River Reservation, they take a tour of the school and learn more about the Arapaho Nation's culture. This tradition continues today, and the students benefit greatly from it.\n\n\n\n"}

Very popular in his own country, Krüger is also known for his appearances in international films like \"Hatari!\", \"The Wild Geese\", \"Sundays and Cybele\", \"The Flight of the Phoenix\", \"A Bridge Too Far\", \"The Battle of Neretva\", \"The Secret of Santa Vittoria\", \"The Red Tent\" and \"Barry Lyndon\".\n\nHardy Krüger was born in Wedding, Berlin in 1928. His parents were ardent Nazis. \"I was raised to love Hitler\", he stated in a 2016 interview. From 1941, he went to an elite Adolf Hitler School at the Ordensburg Sonthofen. At age 15, Hardy made his film début in a German picture, \"The Young Eagles\", but his acting career was interrupted when he was conscripted into the German Wehrmacht in 1944 at age 16.\n\nIn March 1945, Krüger was conscripted into the 38th SS Division Nibelungen where he was drawn into heavy fighting. The 16-year-old Krüger was ordered to eliminate a group of American soldiers. When he refused, he was sentenced to death for cowardice, but another SS officer stopped the order. Krüger described this experience as his break with Nazism. He later served as a messenger for the SS, but he escaped and hid out in Tyrol until the end of the war. He is today a member of the Amadeu Antonio Foundation and frequently speaks out against extremism and for democracy, also citing his own experiences.\n\nKrüger continued his acting career after the Second World War with small stage roles because he could not afford an acting school. He established himself as a German film star during the 1950s. He appeared in the German version of \"The Moon Is Blue\" (1953), directed by Otto Preminger. Krüger looked for international roles, because he found the German Heimatfilm cinema of the 1950s rather shallow. He first came to the attention of English language audiences in the 1957 British war film \"The One That Got Away\", the story of Franz von Werra, the only German prisoner of war to successfully escape from Allied custody and return to Germany.\n\nIn 1960, Krüger bought Ngorongoro farm in the then Tanganyika Territory, which he owned for 13 years. Ngorongoro and the area around it served as the setting for the 1962 film \"Hatari!\", a Howard Hawks film, in which Krüger appeared with John Wayne.\n\nFluent in German, English and French, he has worked in numerous European and American films, including the Oscar-winning \"Sundays and Cybele\" (1962), and the original 1965 version of \"The Flight of the Phoenix\" (1965). Other films include the comedy-drama \"The Secret of Santa Vittoria\" (1969), where he played a German officer during the Second World War trying to find hidden wine in a small Italian town; Stanley Kubrick's \"Barry Lyndon\" with Ryan O'Neal (1975); Richard Attenborough's \"A Bridge Too Far\" (sharing a scene with Laurence Olivier, 1977); and \"The Wild Geese\" with Richard Burton (1978). Because of his stereotypical Teutonic look (blond hair and blue eyes), Krüger often performed in roles portraying German soldiers.\n\nKrüger mostly retired from acting in the late 1980s and is today a writer, he published 16 books since 1970. He also directed a number of European television documentaries, showing him travelling around the world.\n\nKrüger had his first child Christiane Krüger (born 1945) with his later wife Renate Densow (1918-2006) when he was only 17 years old. Krüger and Densow were married between 1950 and 1964. His second marriage was with the Italian painter Francesca Marazzi between 1964 and 1977. From this marriage, he has the children Malaika Krüger (born 1967) and Hardy Krüger Jr. (born 1968). Krüger married his third wife Anita Park in 1978. They live in California and Hamburg today. In the 1960s and 1970s, Krüger lived at the ranch \"Hatari Lodge\" (where the movie \"Hatari!\" was filmed) at the foot of Mount Kilimanjaro.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2181944", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2181944", "title": "St Albans School, Hertfordshire", "text": "St Albans School, Hertfordshire\n\nSt Albans School is an independent school in the city of St Albans in Hertfordshire, in the South East of England. Entry before sixth form is for boys only, but the sixth form has been co-educational since 1991. Founded in 948 by Wulsin, St Albans School is not only the oldest school in Hertfordshire but also one of the oldest in the world. The school has been called \"Britain's oldest public school\" by the \"Daily Mail\". Nicholas Carlisle, in 1818, described the school as \"of very ancient origin, and of great celebrity\" and the \"Good Schools Guide\" describes St Albans as a \"traditional public school, with a rich history\".\n\nThe current headmaster is Jonathan Gillespie, appointed in 2014.\n\nThe school coat of arms is composed of the cross of Saint Alban together with the School motto.\n\nThe cross of Saint Alban is a gold saltire (a cross, signifying that Alban was martyred, but diagonal, as he was beheaded, not crucified) on a blue field (or, in heraldic terms, \"Azure, a saltire Or\").\n\nThe current school motto is \"Non nobis nati\" (\"Born not for ourselves\"). This dates back to the family of the 12th century Geoffrey de Gorham (Master and subsequently Abbot of St Albans), deriving from Cicero's (\"Non nobis solum nati sumus\"; \"We are not born for ourselves alone\"), and was used until the Reformation. It was re-introduced in 1994, thereby stressing the link between the School before and after the dissolution of the monastery in 1539.\n\n\"Non nobis nati\" replaced the previous motto \"Mediocria firma\" (\"The middle road is best\"), used between the 16th and 20th centuries. This was the motto of the Bacon family at Gorhambury (including Sir Nicholas and Sir Francis Bacon). This formed part of the Bacon coat of arms, which for instance can still be seen outside the Verulam Arms public house in nearby Welclose Street and inside St Mary's Church, Redbourn.\n\nThe school was founded within St Albans Abbey by Abbot Wulsin in 948 and was the first school in the world to accept students not intending to join a religious order, being the first school open to the wider public. By the 12th century, the School had built for itself such a reputation that the famous Norman scholars Geoffrey de Gorham and Alexander Neckam applied for the post of Master. Geoffrey de Gorham was later to become Abbot of St Albans in 1119, and the School then remained under the control of the Abbot until the dissolution of the Abbey in 1539.\n\nBy the 12th century, the school was one of the largest in the British Isles. On 16 September 1309, the school was given new statutes, including scholarships for poor students. The school and Abbey were sacked in 1381 during the Peasants' Revolt. (The revolt's leader John Ball, was also a former pupil of the school.) By the 15th century, the school was located in buildings in Romeland and inside the Abbey Gateway, which from 1479 housed schoolmaster's press. The St Albans Press continues today, in a semi-dormant form, as \"John Insomuch Schoolmaster Printer 1479 Ltd\", making the school the oldest extant presses in the world.\n\nAfter the dissolution of the Abbey in 1539, Richard Boreman, the last Abbot, became Headmaster and the school moved to a chapel near St Peter's church in St Albans after its buildings in Romeland were demolished by Sir Richard Lee for building materials to rebuild Sopwell Priory into a country house. In 1549, to put the school on a firmer foundation, the last Abbot was granted the right to maintain a Grammar School by a private Act of Parliament. Around 1545, the school outgrew its St Peter's church premises and moved again to the Lady Chapel at the east end of the Abbey, bought for the huge sum of £100, and it was separated from the rest of the abbey with a wall made of smashed stones from the ancient shrine of St Alban. In 1553 the Crown sold the rest of the Abbey Church to the town for £400 (the value of the lead on its roof) and became a Church of England parish church for the new Borough of St Albans.\n\nIn 1570 Sir Nicholas Bacon, Lord Keeper of the Great Seal and father of Sir Francis Bacon, then living at nearby Gorhambury, gave the school new statutes and re-endowed the School by successful petitioning Queen Elizabeth I for a Wine Charter (extended by King James I in 1606). The only other educational institutions with the same privileges to tax the alcohol trade in their localities were the University of Oxford and the University of Cambridge. The income from wine and beer sales in the St Albans continued to fund the school until 1922, when they were surrendered to the Treasury in return for £1200 in The Oxford and St Albans Wine Privileges (Abolition) Bill. Other benefactors from this period include Sir Richard Platt, Citizen of London, sometime Master of the Worshipful Company of Brewers and later founder of Aldenham School, who 'conveyed to the Mayor and Burgesses, and their Successors for ever' former-Abbey land on George Street in St Albans for the benefit of the school, and Charles Hale, whose relative Richard Hale later founded a grammar school in the town of Hertford.\n\nQueen Elizabeth I and Sir Nicholas Bacon also founded the school's library in 1570, which moved from Sumpter Yard in the 19th century to the Abbey Gateway, and then in the 1980s to an impressive converted 19th century neo-Gothic hall, opened by Professor Colin Renfrew OA, then Master of Jesus College, Cambridge. The library collection now holds over 16,000 volumes and Elizabeth I is still regarded as the 'Benefactor Royal' of the St Albans School Library.\n\nOther significant benefactions to the school include a gift of clay pits near St Albans made in 1582 and a significant amount of land by Charles Woollam, an Old Albanian, in the 19th century, including playing fields at Belmont Hill and St Alban's \"Holy Well\", which was a site for medieval pilgrimage.\n\nIn 1626, King Charles I visited the school in a royal inspection. His visit to St Albans was recorded by a royal crest being built into one of the fireplace surrounds in the Abbey Gateway and this room is still called the \"King Charles Room\" in honour of his visit.\n\nAfter over three centuries in the Lady Chapel, in 1871, due to the restoration of the Abbey and the re-instatement of the Lady Chapel, the school moved into the Abbey Gateway (which had been built in 1365 and, following the dissolution, had been used as a prison for 300 years; now a scheduled ancient monument).\n\nBetween 1907 and 1976, it was a Direct Grant grammar school, keeping the name St Albans School for most part not least because of the existence of 2 separate Boys' and Girls' Grammar Schools in St Albans and was generally referred to simply as a Direct Grant School. In the 1960s and 1970s many of the pupils at the school enjoyed a free education, paid for by public funds. From 1980 to 2005, it also offered free places to poor but academically talented pupils under the Assisted Places Scheme. Since the 1970s, the school has also offered a large number of scholarships and bursaries up to 100% of the school's fees, funded from its endowments.\n\nSince the 19th century, there have been many additions to the school site, which now comprises a very interesting architectural mixture of buildings dating from the Roman-era cellar, where the archives are kept under the Abbey Gateway, to modern extensions built in the 1990s. The school also includes the oldest room in the world regularly used as a classroom, the 12th century West Gate Room, which was incorporated from a previous gateway into the current Abbey Gateway in the 1360s. Ptolemy Dean is the current school architect.\n\nThe Woollam Playing Fields, a couple of miles away to the north of the city, provides an extensive, modern, outdoor sports facility for the School and the Old Albanian Sports Club. At over 100 acres, it was the largest sporting development in Western Europe until the construction of the Olympic Park in East London for the 2012 games. The site was officially opened in October 2002 by Prince Richard, The Duke of Gloucester. Woollam's was built on part of a 400-acre farm owned by the school, which also contains a field studies centre used by the school's biology department. In 2003, the school opened a new Drama Department building and theatre in Romeland, on the site of the medieval school's building, called the \"New Place\".\n\nOn 7 January 2010, the \"Herts Advertiser\" ran an article reporting that a loan of £1000 at the rate of 6% p.a. was given by the school to the city of St Albans in 1722. The St Albans City and District Council, though it acknowledges the loan, has not made any repayments on it. As of 2012, the debt stands at £21,800,000,000 (21 billion 800 million pounds).\n\nThe summer of 2012 saw the completion of a new Sports Centre on site, with sports hall, swimming pool, climbing wall, fitness suite and dance studio. Another recent development was the acquisition of Aquis Court, an office building adjacent to the school, which provides facilities for the Sixth Form, with a new Common Room, cafeteria and classrooms, while the Art Department also has new facilities.\n\nThe school still maintains links with St Albans Cathedral, which doubles as the school's chapel. Services are held there every Monday and Friday morning during term time, and special events held there include the annual Founders' Day and two carol services, led by the school choir, who still wear black and blue gowns in the same style as worn by undergraduates at Trinity College, Cambridge and similar to those worn by monks at the Abbey in medieval times. In addition, the school's music staff are usually linked with the Abbey's musical staff. Andrew Parnell, organist and harpsichordist, was assistant master of music at the Abbey as well as being master of music and choirmaster at the school from 1976 to 2001. Simon Lindley also held these posts a few years earlier; John Rutter's 1974 carol \"Jesus Child\" bears a dedication \"for Simon Lindley and the choir of St Albans School\".\n\nThe school also has a long scientific tradition, stretching back to the Norman era, when Alexander Neckam became master of the school. Since the advent of modern science, the school has produced many famous scientists and mathematicians including Professor Colin Cherry, Professor Ian Grant, Professor Stephen Hawking (inspired by Dikran Tahta, a teacher at the school who later worked at the Open University), and Professor Christopher Budd. In the light of its long scientific heritage, the school was awarded a large sum of money in 2007 by the Wolfson Foundation to rebuild its physics laboratories to university standards.\n\nSt Albans School has also produced some notable historians and historiographers. In medieval times, the school and one of its alumni, Matthew Paris, were closely associated with the St Albans school of medieval historiography, and developed one of the first consistent methods of historical writing. More recently; two teachers in the award-winning Ancient History department published a book on Roman sources in 2010. Some notable historians who are alumni of the school include Colin Renfrew, an archaeological historian and former Disney Professor of Archaeology at the University of Cambridge, Ernest Gellner, an anthropological historian, Professor Malcolm Schofield of St John's College, Cambridge, and more recently Justin Pollard, a TV historian, and Peter Sarris, a specialist on the Byzantine Empire and a fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge.\n\nSt Albans School is predominantly a single-sex school for boys, but has accepted girls into the Sixth Form since 1991. It is a member of the Headmasters' Conference of leading public schools. In its earlier days it was known as the Free School of St Albans, City of St Alban Grammar School or St Albans Grammar School. It is often (erroneously) referred to as \"The Boys' School\", \"St Albans Boys\" and \"The Abbey School\" (thereby causing confusion with The Abbey C of E Primary School nearby which is almost always referred to as \"The Abbey School\", and the adjacent but now defunct \"Abbey National Boys' School\", a name which is still borne by a building in nearby Spicer Street). The school now has 814 pupils.\n\nThe school operates a house system. The current system, which came into use in September 1996, assigns all members of the school to one of four houses. These are named after notable former pupils and staff: Hawking, Renfrew, Hampson and Marsh. Previously the house names were Abbey, Breakespeare, Debenham, Pemberton, Shirley, Woollams and School House. School House, the last remaining boarding house, closed at the end of the Summer Term 1961 and those boys in School House were integrated into other houses.\n\nIn 1967 the School acquired what was then a derelict hill farm in the Brecon Beacons. The property, Pen Arthur, was fully restored and is now a well-equipped Field Studies Centre. Academic departments use Pen Arthur for field trips and study weekends throughout the year, and it plays a key part as a base for outdoor activities organised by the CCF and Duke of Edinburgh's Award Scheme. During their first year at the school, all pupils go to Pen Arthur for a week, during which time they participate in many \"outward-bound\" activities such as caving, hiking and even visiting a Roman gold mine.\n\nFormer pupils of the school can use the title OA or \"Old Albanian\" after their name and are members of the Old Albanian Club. The Old Albanian Club has its own sports facilities at Woollam's, clubs, societies and also its own social networking website at www.oaconnect.co.uk.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It was written by Allen and Ken Hughes, directed by Hughes, and co-produced by Irving Allen, Albert R. Broccoli and Harold Huth. The screenplay was by Ken Hughes and Montgomery Hyde, based on the play \"The Stringed Lute\" by John Furnell. The film was made by Warwick Films and released by United Artists.\n\nIt stars Peter Finch as Wilde, Lionel Jeffries as Queensberry, and John Fraser as Bosie (Lord Alfred Douglas) with James Mason, Nigel Patrick, Yvonne Mitchell, Maxine Audley, Paul Rogers and James Booth.\n\n\nThe production was filmed in Technirama. It was one of two films about Wilde released in 1960, the other being \"Oscar Wilde\". According to production designer Ken Adam, producer Irving Allen set up four editing rooms for the production, working in parallel during principal photography; the setup permitted the film on the screen in the West End seven weeks after they had started filming.\n\nThe film came out at the same time as \"Oscar Wilde\". The producers of both films originally refused to change the movie titles. Then Warwick announced they would release \"The Trials of Oscar Wilde\" to \"The Green Carnation\".\nIn his review of the film, Bosley Crowther wrote: \"Mr. Wilde himself could not have expected his rare personality or his unfortunate encounters with British justice on a morals charge to have been more sympathetically or affectingly dramatized. In comparison to that other British picture about the same subject that opened [in New York City] last week, this one is more impressive in every respect, save one.\" Crowther concludes the review saying \"The only thing is you wonder if this is a fairly true account, if Mr. Wilde was as noble and heroic as he is made to appear. And if he was, what was he doing with those cheap and shady young men? It looks to us as if they are trying to whitewash a most unpleasant case, which is one of the more notorious and less ennobling in literary history.\"\n\n\"Variety\" magazine, commenting on the performances, said \"Peter Finch gives a moving and subtle performance as the ill-starred playwright. Before his downfall he gives the man the charm that he undoubtedly had...John Fraser as handsome young Lord Alfred Douglas is suitably vain, selfish, vindictive and petulant and the relationship between the two is more understandable. Where \"Trials\" suffers in comparison with the B&W film is in the remarkable impact of the libel case court sequence. James Mason never provides the strength and bitter logic necessary for the dramatic cut-and-thrust when Wilde is in the witness box.\"\n\nThe film won the Golden Globe Award for Best English-Language Foreign Film. Peter Finch won the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role and the film also received four other BAFTA nominations including Best British Film, Best Film from any source and for John Fraser as Best British Actor. Peter Finch (tied with Bambang Hermanto) also received the Best Actor Award at the 2nd Moscow International Film Festival.\n\nThe film was the inspiration for a promotional film made for the Rolling Stones song \"We Love You\"; the 1967 film, directed by Peter Whitehead, featured Mick Jagger as Wilde, Keith Richards as the Marquis, and Marianne Faithfull as Bosie.\n"}

Stone Nation, or BPSN, is an American street gang founded in Chicago, estimated to have more than 100,000 members. The gang was originally formed in the late 1950s as the Blackstone Rangers. The organization was co-founded by Eugene Hairston and Jeff Fort. In later years, under Fort's leadership, an Islamic faction of the gang emerged, naming themselves the \"El Rukn tribe of the Moorish Science Temple of America\" (or simply El Rukn, Arabic for \"the pillar\" or \"the foundation\").\nThey eventually started describing themselves as Orthodox Sunni Muslims. Jeff Fort changed their fort name from El Rukn Moorish Science Mosque, to El Rukn Sunni Masjid al-Malik.\n\nConsidered by law enforcement authorities to be Chicago's most powerful and sophisticated street gang, the BPSN finances itself through a wide array of criminal activities and is part of the large Chicago gang alliance known as the People Nation. Under Fort's command, the BPSN assumed an increasingly revolutionary outlook as it became associated with the black nationalism movement, eventually attracting the attention of the Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan, who introduced them to Libyan leader Muammar al-Gaddafi and Nicaragua's Sandinistas. In 1986 four of its members were indicted for conspiring to commit terrorist acts in the United States for the Libyan Government. The verdict marked the first time American citizens had been found guilty of planning terrorist acts for a foreign government in return for money. \nThe BPSN originated, and is based, on the South Side of Chicago in the Woodlawn neighborhood. It has expanded into other areas.\n\nThere is a set in the West-Side Black P Stones in the Los Angeles area called the Jungles and another area called City in Crenshaw & Adams.\n\nThe Blackstone Rangers were founded at the St. Charles Institution for Troubled Youth by Jeff Fort and Eugene Hairston as a community organization for black youth in the Woodlawn area of South Chicago. Between 1961 and 1963, they evolved into one of the most dangerous and powerful gangs in Chicago. Fort seized upon the gang's changed mission, renaming it the Black P.(Peace) Stone Nation. He transformed the BPSN into a black nationalistic group, and continued to involve the gang in street crime and drug trafficking. BPSN co-founder Eugene Hairston was incarcerated on drug charges in June 1966 and was eventually murdered in 1988. Fort was arrested for mismanagement of government grants totaling $927,000 from the U.S. Office of Economic Opportunity in March 1972. Fort was released in 1976, but was later re-incarcerated on drug charges in the early 1980s. At the same time he was released from prison, Fort converted to Islam and imbued the BPSN with Islamic overtones, and adopted the name Abdul Malik Ka'bah.\n\nAccording to former gang member Lance Williams, Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan was responsible for introducing Fort to Libyan leader Muammar al-Gaddafi. Following meetings during 1986 with Libyan operatives from Colonel Gaddafi's government, Fort was arrested. In 1987, Fort was tried and convicted for conspiring with Libya to perform acts of domestic terrorism. He was sentenced to 80 years imprisonment and transferred to the United States Penitentiary, Marion, the federal supermax prison in Marion, Illinois.\n\nIn 1988, Fort was also convicted of ordering the 1981 murder of a rival gang leader and was sentenced to 75 years in prison to be served after the completion of his terror conspiracy sentence. While Fort continues to exercise considerable influence over the BPS from prison, the various Black Stones splinter groups suffer from rampant infighting without a clear leader. There are two major groups that have split with the BPSN: The Mickey Cobras were supporters of Mickey Cogwell, a co-founder of BPSN killed by Jeff Fort. The Titanic Stones were supporters of Eugene Hairston who had a falling-out with Fort.\n\nMembers of the Blackstone Rangers marched with Martin Luther King Jr. in Chicago, in 1966, and did not retaliate with violence despite broken noses and \"blood flowing from their wounds.\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2181958", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2181958", "title": "Great Smoky Mountains Parkway", "text": "Great Smoky Mountains Parkway\n\nThe Great Smoky Mountains Parkway travels between Great Smoky Mountains National Park and Sevierville, along U.S. Route 441 and State Route 448, in east Tennessee. It serves both, as the main thoroughfare for Gatlinburg and Pigeon Forge, and a spur of the Foothills Parkway.\n\nMost of the Great Smoky Mountains Parkway is a divided highway, except for the segment south of Gatlinburg, which carries little traffic. Most of the parkway has been widened to six lanes, and is one of the most congested arterial routes in the state. The road is simply called \"Parkway\" in Pigeon Forge and Gatlinburg, where most of the commercial land development has occurred in those two cities.\nBoth have numbered each traffic light sequentially to make it easier for non-locals to find their hotels and other tourist attractions. Sevierville has its traffic lights numbered in miles and tenths, according to the mileage from the national park boundary.\n\nThe Great Smoky Mountains Parkway begins as a segment of US 441 at the Tennessee-North Carolina state line in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park a few miles south of Gatlinburg. Entering Gatlinburg, the route widens to four lanes as an undivided arterial route. In downtown Gatlinburg, the route turns north at an intersection with US 321, beginning a concurrency with that route. \n\nLeaving Gatlinburg, the parkway becomes part of the Foothills Parkway as its spur route, although that roadway has yet to be built in the area (the right of way for it already includes land for a small interchange adjacent to the southern end of the Pigeon Forge city limit). This segment, on a narrow strip of National Park Service (NPS) land, is a four-lane divided highway which runs along both banks of the northward-flowing Little Pigeon River. Where the river briefly diverts to the west and back east again, the southbound roadway on the west bank also curves around, while the northbound lanes go through a tunnel. The Gatlinburg visitor center is located just before entering the town from the north. The Gatlinburg Bypass, part of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, connects with the parkway to provide a direct access to the National Park. All of these parkways are operated as part of Great Smoky Mountains National Park (unlike other separate national parkways), with support for design and road construction (including repaving) from the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) through the Public Lands Transportation Program (PLTP) as in other national parks.\n\nEntering Pigeon Forge, the NPS corridor ends and the route widens to six lanes. A short distance later is an intersection with SR 448, which serves as an alternative route to the parkway between Pigeon Forge and Sevierville. A short distance beyond this point, US 321 splits off to the east, heading towards Maryville.\n\nUpon entering Sevierville, the Parkway splits into an east and west branch, which together encircle the business district of Sevierville, as well as a spur in both directions along U.S. 411. Northbound traffic is directed along the east branch, which contains three northbound lanes and one southbound lane, and southbound traffic along the west branch, which contains three southbound lanes and one northbound lane. In this split section, both north and southbound lanes intersect with US 411, where US 441 splits of into a concurrency with US 411 to the east. At this intersection, the parkway becomes part of SR 66, and is known as Winfield Dunn parkway. \n\nThe parkway continues north for several more miles through a less-developed area, before reaching an intersection with SR 139. A few miles later, the parkway reaches its northern terminus at the Exit 407 diverging diamond interchange with Interstate 40.\n\nWithin the towns, the road is decorated with Christmas lights all winter. As a six-lane divided highway through Pigeon Forge, very tall multi-fixture street lights in the median are decorated with white LED snowflakes that \"fall\" down the poles. In Gatlinburg, white LED deciduous trees sprout from the lampposts, in addition to other displays, such as the large one that stretches across the road at the town's northern entrance. In Sevierville, the traditional and much brighter snowflake light sculptures are still in use.\n\nThe northernmost segment of the parkway between Sevierville and I-40 was widened from four to six lanes in three phases with funding from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. Phase 1, between Nichols Street and SR 338, began on July 15, 2009 and was completed on November 18, 2011 at a cost of $38.6 million. Phase 2, between SR 139 and I-40, began in September 2010 and was completed in November 2012 at a cost of $23.3 million. Phase 3, between SR 338 and SR 139 began in March 2012, and was expected to be completed by October 31, 2014. This project was delayed to Dexember 2015 and cost $32.5 million. The interchange with I-40 was reconstructed into a diverging diamond interchange between March 12, 2014 and June 30, 2015.\n\n\n"}

He is considered one of the Confederacy's best tactical cavalry commanders.\n\nWharton was born near Nashville, Tennessee, as the only child of Sarah Groce Wharton and William H. Wharton, later a leading politician during the Texas Revolution. He was named after his uncle, John Austin Wharton. When he was still an infant, the family moved to what became Brazoria County, Texas. In 1846, Wharton enrolled at South Carolina College where he was a member of the Euphradian Society. Two years later, he married Eliza Penelope Johnson, the daughter of David Johnson, the Governor of South Carolina.\n\nAfter graduating in 1850, Wharton returned to Texas and studied law, establishing his practice in Brazoria. He became a wealthy plantation owner and slave holder. In 1860, he supported John C. Breckinridge's candidacy for the Presidency and served as an elector.\n\nAn ardent secessionist, Wharton enlisted in the Confederate Army as captain of Company B, 8th Texas Cavalry, also known as \"Terry's Texas Rangers.\" Commissioned as colonel of the regiment, Wharton fought with distinction at the Battle of Shiloh, where he was wounded. Wharton served under Gen. Braxton Bragg during the 1862 invasion of eastern Kentucky. He was promoted to brigadier general on November 18, 1862, and was again wounded, this time at Murfreesboro, Tennessee.\n\nWharton again distinguished himself at Chickamauga and was promoted to the rank of major general. He was assigned to the Trans-Mississippi Department in Louisiana in February 1864, leading the cavalry under Lt. Gen. Richard Taylor during the Red River Campaign.\nShortly before the end of the war in 1865, a fellow Confederate cavalry officer, Col. George Wythe Baylor (1832–1916) (brother of Confederate Arizona Governor Colonel John Baylor) killed Wharton in Houston, over a simmering dispute on military matters. The incident began with an argument on the street outside of the Fannin Hotel, the headquarters of Maj. Gen. John B. Magruder. The two officers had quarreled in the past, but this time Wharton came into Magruder's quarters and, as Baylor later claimed, called Baylor a liar. Baylor shot the unarmed Wharton and killed him instantly.\n\nWharton is interred at Texas State Cemetery in Austin, Texas.\n\n\n\n"}

It is part of the Florida College System and one of the institutions in the system designated a \"state college,\" as it offers a greater number of four-year bachelor's degrees than traditional two-year community colleges focused on associate degrees. It is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools and enrolled about 29,000 students in the fall of 2018.\n\nThe school was founded in 1927 as a private junior college, the first in Florida. It later became a public institution and grew to include campuses throughout Pinellas County. Today it has eleven campuses and centers: four in St. Petersburg, Florida and seven in Seminole, Pinellas Park, Largo, Clearwater, and Tarpon Springs.\n\nSt. Petersburg College was founded in 1927 as St. Petersburg Junior College by Captain George M. Lynch, Pinellas County's city superintendent of schools for the city of St. Petersburg, as a private, non-profit institution. It was created in part because of the economic downturn preceding the Great Depression as a way for local students to receive a postsecondary education without having to relocate or pay high tuition. On opening day, the college consisted of 102 students and 14 faculty members, operating from an unused wing of St. Petersburg High School. After one semester, SPJC moved its operations to a former high school facility overlooking Mirror Lake, where it remained until January 1942. At this point, the facility was moved into a single building on the corner of 5th Ave. N. and 66th St. N.—a building still in active use today as the James E. Hendry Administration Building, part of the St. Petersburg/Gibbs Campus.\n\nSPJC became a public college in 1948.\n\nAfter a 1959 study clearly illustrated the demand for a higher-education facility in northern Pinellas county, SPJC began planning the development of a second campus located in Clearwater, Florida. In 1962, the college acquired of land in the vicinity of Drew Street and County Road 32 (Old Coachman Road), land which previously contained an orange grove and a waste disposal site. Construction began on February 25, 1964. That same year, the new campus, consisting of only five buildings, was officially dedicated on November 21.\n\nLike almost all other Florida colleges, SPJC was all-white until the mid-1960s. A companion junior college for black students, Gibbs Junior College, opened its doors in 1957. Gibbs was placed under the supervision of SPJC in 1965, and became the Gibbs campus of SPJC. In 1966-67 the name was changed to the Skyway Campus of SPJC. It ceased operations in 1967. The only association of today's (2016) Gibbs Campus of SPC with the former Gibbs Junior College is nominal; it is not located where the college was.\nSt. Petersburg College has no resident students. This is mostly because no single campus is large enough to warrant a need for student on-campus housing. Many of the SPC campuses do not offer a large curriculum of available courses, but instead specialize in one or two specific fields. For example, the Caruth Health Education Center in Pinellas Park specializes in courses centering on health care, while the Seminole campus is a highly technology-oriented campus. The Seminole campus also serves to house SPC's University Partnership Center, a campus that offers select degree programs from 16 fully accredited institutions, including Barry University, Case Western Reserve University's Francis Payne Bolton School of Nursing, Cleveland State University, Eckerd College, Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, Florida Gulf Coast University, Florida Institute of Technology, Florida International University, Florida State University, Indiana University, Saint Leo University, University of Central Florida, University of West Florida, University of Florida, and University of South Florida.

It is a concept album and it was released on March 21, 2000, through Spitfire Records.\n\n\"Magica\" marks the return of guitarist Craig Goldy, who also has performed on Dio's album \"Dream Evil\" and in the later release \"Master of the Moon\". \"Magica\" also features Jimmy Bain on bass and Simon Wright on drums. Band leader Ronnie James Dio produced this concept album. The album was originally planned to be the first part of a trilogy of concept albums, and shortly before beginning his tour with Heaven & Hell, Dio announced his intention to start the \"Magica II & III\" album after the tour's end, but he died shortly after of stomach cancer on May 16, 2010. The only song released from \"Magica II & III\" was titled \"Electra\".\n\nSaid Dio: \"Magica is the saga of Blessing, a netherworld invaded by dark forces that vaporise people into pure, evil energy. The planet’s saviours are master, apprentice heroes Eriel and Challis, who must recite a spell from the sacred book of Magica to defeat their foe, Shadowcast. The album is written from the villain’s viewpoint. (...) I took on the evil perspective because I’ve always written from the anti-perspective. Most people don’t think in those terms so you are freer to create. I left the ending ambivalent because evil always exists, good doesn’t always triumph and that’s the universal balance.\" \n\nA 2007 re-release puts \"Magica\" together with \"Killing the Dragon\".\nDio guitarist Craig Goldy stated in an interview \"We were working on tracks for a new DIO album just before Ronnie died in May. And we did almost finish one song. Wendy [Dio, Ronnie's widow/manager] has been talking about reissuing [DIO's] 'Magica' album (originally released in 2000) with bonus tracks, including this one.\" Goldy goes on to say of the lyrics, that they were written by Dio when he was fighting cancer, and are \"very emotional\" and \"hard to listen to without a lump at the back of your throat\".\nOn April 15, 2013, Niji announced that a deluxe 2-disc version of \"Magica\" would be released on June 25, 2013. The first disc is identical to the original North American release (though it is remastered by Wyn Davis), but the narration track \"The Magica Story\", is moved to the second disc. The instrumental \"Annica\" (originally a Japanese-only bonus track) is also on the second disc, as well as \"Electra,\" and six \"Official Live Bootleg\" (live recordings of Magica tracks). The ‘Official Live Bootleg’ songs were recorded between 2000-2002, at various dates on the Magica and Killing the Dragon tours. \"Turn to Stone\" was announced on the official press release for the Deluxe Edition, issued by Niji Entertainment Group, but was eventually omitted from the album, for unknown reasons.\n\n\n\n"}

He has been characterized as “Bismarck's Boswell.”\n\nBusch was born at Dresden. He entered the University of Leipzig in 1841 as a student of philosophy and theology, and graduated as doctor philosophiae. From 1847, he devoted himself entirely to journalism and literature. He began literary life as a translator of Dickens, Thackeray, and other English authors.\n\nIn 1851 he went to America, but soon returned disillusioned to Germany, and published an account of his travels. During the next years he travelled extensively in the East and wrote books on Egypt, Greece and Palestine. From 1856 he was employed at Leipzig on the \"Grenzboten\", one of the most influential German periodicals, which, under the editorship of Gustav Freytag, had become the organ of the National Liberal Party. In this role, Busch strongly supported Bismarck's policies.\n\nIn 1864 he became closely connected with the Augustenburg party in Schleswig-Holstein, but after 1866 he transferred his services to the Prussian government, and was employed in a semi-official capacity in the newly conquered province of Hanover. His work on the \"Grenzboten\" had attracted Bismarck's attention, and in 1870 he received an appointment to the German Foreign Office, where he functioned as one of Bismarck's press agents. From that time and for many years, he was the inseparable companion and confidant of the chancellor, taking daily notes of his sayings and doings, and earning for himself the title of “Bismarck's Boswell.” He was at the chancellor's side during the whole of the campaign of 1870–71.\n\nBusch died at Leipzig on 16 November 1899.\n\nAfter his trip to the United States, he published:\n\n\nIn 1878 he published the first of his works on Bismarck, a book entitled \"Bismarck und seine Leute, während des Krieges mit Frankreich\" (Bismarck and his People during the War with France\"), in which, under the form of extracts from his diary, he gave an account of the chancellor's life during the war. The vividness of the descriptions and the cleverness with which the conversations were reported ensured a success, and the work was translated into several languages. This was followed in 1884 by another book, \"Unser Reichskanzler\" (translated into English as \"Our Chancellor\"), chiefly dealing with the work in the foreign office in Berlin.\n\nImmediately after Bismarck's death, Busch published the chancellor's famous petition to the emperor Wilhelm II of Germany dated 18 March 1890, requesting to be relieved of office. This was followed by a pamphlet \"Bismarck und sein Werk\"; and in 1898 in London and in English, by the famous memoirs entitled \"Bismarck: some Secret Pages of his History\" (German by Grunow, under title \"Tagebuchblätter\"), in which were reprinted the whole of the earlier works, but which contains in addition a considerable amount of new material, passages from the earlier works which had been omitted because of the attacks they contained on people in high position, records of later conversations, and some important letters and documents which had been entrusted to him by Bismarck. Many passages were of such a nature that it could not be safely published in Germany; but in 1899 a far better and more complete German edition was published at Leipzig in three volumes and consisting of three sections.\n"}

The result is a water-soluble material that releases free iodine when in solution. Iodophors are prepared by mixing iodine with the solubilizing agent; heat can be used to speed up the reaction.\n\nDiluted iodophor is often used by brewers and winemakers to sanitize equipment and bottles. Its major advantage over other sanitizers is that when used in proper proportions, it does not require rinsing. However, it can leave unattractive orange-brown stains on plastic parts and equipment if left in contact with them.\n\nIt is often supplied in different concentrations and is further diluted with water before use. The label will advise the appropriate dilution ratio, commonly 1:1000 or 1:100. Equipment to be sanitized should be thoroughly clean and left in contact with the solution for at least 2 minutes.\n\nDiluted iodophor is used extensively in the dairy industry.\n\nIodophors are most effective in an acidic medium (pH 2 to pH 5) but are effective up to pH 7.\n\nIt is inactivated by proteins if the pH rises above 4 and is inactivated if the temperature rises above 50°C, as the iodine is driven off as a gas.\n\nThe optimum concentration is >200 mg/l free iodine with a contact time of 2 minutes and 100 mg/l free iodine for cleaned and dried equipment. In a nonfood-contact application the concentration may rise to 500 – 800 mg/l.\n\n\"Based on a review of the available toxicology data, the [US EPA] has concluded that iodine and iodophor complexes are of very low toxicity by the oral, dermal, and inhalation routes of exposure.\"\n\n"}

{"id": "2182007", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2182007", "title": "Military Auxiliary Radio System", "text": "Military Auxiliary Radio System\n\nThe Military Auxiliary Radio System (MARS) is a United States Department of Defense sponsored program, established as a separately managed and operated program by the United States Army, and the United States Air Force. The United States Navy-Marine Corps program closed in 2015. The program is a civilian auxiliary consisting primarily of licensed amateur radio operators who are interested in assisting the military with communications on a regional and national level when access to traditional forms of communication may no longer be available. The MARS programs also include active duty, reserve, and National Guard units; and Navy, Marine Corps units.\n\nMARS has a long history of providing worldwide auxiliary emergency communications during times of need. The combined two-service MARS programs (Army, and Air Force), volunteer force of over 3,000 dedicated and skilled amateur radio operators provide the backbone of the MARS program. The main benefit of MARS membership is enjoying the amateur radio hobby through an ever-expanding horizon of MARS service to the nation. MARS members work by the slogans \"Proudly Serving Those Who Serve\" and \"Proud, Professional, and Ready.\"\n\nThe organization that led to the Military Auxiliary Radio System was called the Auxiliary Amateur Radio System (AARS). AARS was created in November 1925 by a few dedicated pioneers in the United States Army Signal Corps led by Captain Thomas C. Rives. The United States recognized radio as a critical mode of communication during World War I.\nThe integration of radio to support Army operations generated a significant manpower and skill requirement that was not easily met. The Army Amateur Radio System was formed in 1925 to provide a pool of trained radio operators to augment the Signal Corps during mobilization in time of war and provide an extension of the Signal Corps' radio network to support civil authority with natural disaster relief efforts. While supporting military goals, the organization was composed of volunteer civilians who were accomplished radio amateurs. These civilians applied their specialty skills in radio communication while supporting the Signal Corps across the continental United States, the Philippines, Panama, and Hawaii.\n\nThe organization ultimately experienced both success and failure. The Army Amateur Radio System succeeded in developing the proficiency of its radio operators as demonstrated by the support provided to local, state, and federal authorities during natural disaster relief efforts. However, on the eve of the United States' entry into World War II, the Army Amateur Radio System's membership was significantly underdeveloped in numbers to provide significant manpower to augment the Signal Corps' mobilization for war. The AARS organization continued to operate until the United States entry into World War II on 7 December 1941, at which time radio amateurs were denied the use of the airwaves, and the amateur service and the Army Amateur Radio System were deactivated. Following WWII, the US Army recognized the importance of reactivating the AARS to train vitally needed communications personnel at a relatively low direct cost to the government, and in 1946 the AARS was reactivated.\n\nThe AARS functioned as such until the creation of the Military Affiliate Radio System in November 1948 with the establishment of separate Army and Air Force MARS programs, reflecting the creation of the Air Force as a separate service. In 1948 Captain Robert L. Gabardy (K4TJ, SK) selected the use of the acronym MARS, the Roman god of war, as a fitting name for the post-World War II rebirth of the AARS as the Military Amateur Radio System. The program's name was changed to the Military Affiliate Radio System on 2 September 1952, in recognition of the organization's changing nature with the growing number of civilian volunteer members. Eventually, the Navy-Marine Corps MARS program was established officially on 17 August 1962, and began operations on 1 January 1963. This followed the Cuban Missile Crisis and President Kennedy's concern for viable and extended communications capabilities.\n\nDuring the Korean War, Vietnam War, Cold War and Gulf War, MARS was most known for its handling of \"Marsgram\" written messages and providing \"phone patches\" to allow overseas servicemen to contact their families at home.\n\nThe program's name was changed again to the current Military Auxiliary Radio System on 23 December 2009.\n\nA dispatch issued in May 2009 announced the shutdown of the Navy and Marine Corps MARS program by September 30, 2009. However, Navy-Marine Corps MARS continued to function until September 30, 2015.\n\nDepartment of Defense Instruction 4650.02, dated 23 December 2009 changed the status of MARS from an affiliate to an auxiliary (equal in status to the Coast Guard Auxiliary and Civil Air Patrol). This change in status saved the Navy-Marine Corps MARS program from being shut down and put it back in line with the Emergency Communications mission of its sister services (Army and Air Force MARS).\n\nMilitary Auxiliary Radio System provides Department of Defense sponsored emergency communications on a local, national, and international basis. MARS also provides auxiliary communications for military entities only. One major mission that MARS has had for many years is to handle morale, welfare, and official record and voice communications traffic for Armed Forces and authorized U.S. Government civilian personnel stationed throughout the world. MARS establishes programs to create civilian interest, recruit qualified volunteers, and furnish training in military communications, techniques, and procedures.\n\nEvery year, MARS conducts an appropriate military and amateur radio cross-band exercise as an integral part of the annual Armed Forces Day. They provide a reserve of personnel trained in military radio communications, techniques, and procedures as well as to initiate efforts to improve radio-operating techniques. MARS members test state-of-the-art technology through experimentation and testing.\n\nMARS celebrates Armed Forces Day annually with a traditional military to amateur crossband communications test and a message-receiving test. These tests give amateur radio operators and shortwave listeners an opportunity to demonstrate their individual technical skills and receive recognition from the Secretary of Defense or the appropriate military radio station for their proven expertise. A QSL card is provided to those making contact with one of the military stations. Special commemorative certificates are awarded to anyone who receives and accurately copies the digital Armed Forces Day message from the Secretary of Defense.\n\nParticipating military stations transmit on selected military MARS frequencies and listen for amateur radio stations in the amateur bands. The military station operator will announce the specific amateur-band frequency being monitored. Usually, the military MARS stations are at places such as The Pentagon, Fort Huachuca, Andrews Air Force Base, Nellis Air Force Base, and various Navy and Coast Guard locations.\n\nThe Military Auxiliary Radio System continues to be active today. Its primary mission is to provide contingency communications to the Department of Defense and Military Services. When tasked, MARS may provide communications for Defense Support to Civil Authorities (DSCA) such as FEMA and the Department of Homeland Security. \n\nOn a day-to-day basis MARS members are available to handle messages to and from service men and women: active duty, reserve, guard, or retired and certain employees of the federal government who are stationed outside the US.\n\nMorale and welfare messages are no longer the largest activity in MARS due to the increased use of the Internet and e-mail by deployed military personnel. MARS had an increased role in providing interoperability communications between Army National Guard and Air National Guard forces and civilian state agencies. However, this service providing interoperability communications was terminated as of May 2015 based on a decision by USAF and ARMY MARS. MARS also provides testing of Military Standard communication modes for use by MARS members.\nMARS participates in exercises such as Grecian Firebolt to help support military communications. MARS members from all around the world played a role in Grecian Firebolt 2005 by sending exercise Essential Elements of Information (EEI) reports through the MARS radio network. The EEI's consisted of scenario disaster information. When the EEI's were received, they were sorted and sent to Army Military Intelligence centers. MARS played a large part in reporting up-to-date information on disasters and requesting military assistance using a dispersed and redundant radio network.\n\nMARS also supports government agencies such as the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and participates in programs such as the Department of Homeland Security Office of Emergency Communications SHAred RESources (SHARES).\n\nThe traditional land or sea-based MARS Radio Phone Patch is largely a thing of the past because land and sea-based MARS stations have been dismantled in favor of Satellite Phones. However, modern military aircraft are still equipped with HF radios, and many military aircrews still use MARS Phone Patches as a backup or substitute to Satellite Communications. The USAF MARS Phone Patch Net provides 24/7 HF Radio Phone Patch service to all branches of United States military aircraft worldwide.\n\n\nEffective 30 September 2015, Navy MARS will no longer operate. The US Navy, after completing a study, found that NAVY MARS provided no useful purpose to their missions. \n\n\n\n"}

He was appointed to the rank of Colonel two days before the battle of Elchingen, and was made a Brigadier General in May 1807.\n\nAt the start of the Peninsular War in 1808, Exelmans accompanied Marshal Murat to Spain. In June, he was sent to join Marshal Bon-Adrien Jeannot de Moncey's army which was marching to attack Valencia. At this time, the Spanish countryside was rife with rebellion and he was captured by partisans and taken to Valencia. He was handed over to the British and taken to England as a prisoner. Escaping in 1811, he travelled to Naples, where Murat, who was reigning as King, appointed him as his Equerry.\n\nExelmans rejoined the Grande Armée on the eve of Napoleon's invasion of Russia and was appointed Major in the Grenadiers à Cheval de la Garde Impériale. In the aftermath of the Battle of Borodino, he was promoted to \"Général de Division\" and took command of the light cavalry division. Wounded in the Battle of Vilnius, he returned to Paris on convalescent leave.\n\nUpon recovering from his wound in 1813, he rejoined the Imperial army in Dresden. He was present at the disastrous defeat at Leipzig, and following the campaign in Germany was made a \"Grand Officer in the Legion of Honour\". With France's enemies closing in, Exelmans fought courageously until the allies occupied Paris and Napoleon abdicated, ending the War of the Sixth Coalition.\n\nWhen the Bourbons were restored, Exelmans was made Inspector General and a knight of St Louis. In January 1815, he was tried on accusations of having treasonable relations with Murat, but was acquitted.\n\nUpon Napoleon's return from Elba in the Hundred Days, Exelmans was temporarily made a Peer of France, and was placed in command of the II Cavalry Corps, consisting of Major General Strolz's 9th Cavalry Division and Major General Chastel's 10th Cavalry Division. During the Waterloo Campaign, the corps fought in the battles of Ligny and Wavre. In the final operations around Paris, he won distinction on 1 July at the Battle of Rocquencourt, where units under his command isolated and destroyed an advanced Prussian hussar brigade under the command of Colonel von Sohr.\n\nAfter Napoleon was finally defeated and the Bourbons were once again restored, the royal decree of 24 July 1815 declared that Exelmans and 56 other generals who had sworn allegiance to the king and then joined Napoleon upon his return were to be tried for a variety of charges, including treason. Exelmans fled to the Netherlands, where he lived in exile until 1819, when he was granted amnesty and returned to France. In 1828, he was appointed inspector-general of cavalry.\n\nIn the Revolution of 1848, Exelmans was one of the supporters of Louis Napoléon. In recognition of his loyalty to the Bonapartes, he was awarded the Grand Cross of the Legion of Honour and was made Grand Chancellor of the order in 1849. In 1851, he was elevated to the rank of Marshal of France. His death in 1852 was the result of a fall from his horse.\n\n\n"}

The National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2013–2017 categorized it as a \"general aviation\" facility (the \"commercial service\" category requires at least 2,500 enplanements per year).\n\nThe Kingman Airport was built as a World War II United States Army Air Forces training field. Between 1942 and 1945 the U.S. Army Air Forces acquired about 4,145 acres in Mohave County outside of Kingman, Arizona and established the Kingman Army Airfield and Kingman Aerial Gunnery School training facilities in 1942.\n\nKingman Army Airfield was established as a training base for Army Air Force aerial gunners. In addition to the main base, the Kingman Ground to Ground Gunnery Range and Kingman Air to Air Gunnery Range was located about six miles north of the present city limits of the City of Kingman. From this point, the former practice gunnery ranges extended northward approximately 31 miles, generally following the Hualapai Valley. To support the training at the main facility, Yucca Army Airfield operated several emergency landing strips.\n\nIt was built in 1942 by the Del E. Webb Construction Company with Kemper Goodwin serving as architect.\n\nThe Gunnery Ranges were used to train gunners in air-to-air firing. Five target flight lines and two auxiliary landing fields were established within this range. Initially, gunnery trainees fired at targets towed along these target flight lines. This technique did not provide good training and other techniques were tried. One of the first was to place a gun camera on the machine gun and instead of firing bullets the camera would record the gunners sight picture whenever the trigger was pulled. In this situation, instead of aiming at a towed target sleeve, P-39 and P-63 aircraft were used as targets. Another technique tried involved the use of frangible bullets which were fired at specially armored versions of the P-39 and P-63s. This was called Operation PINBALL.\n\nOn May 7, 1943, the facility was officially named the Kingman Army Air Field. The base continued to grow and change with many new squadrons being added to the base and some of the existing ones combined. The host unit at Kingman Field was the 460th AAF Base Unit. Training units were as follows:\n\nThe 1120th and the 329th merged with the 328th to become the 328th Flexible Gunnery Training Group. The 1122nd, 537th, and 538th were consolidated to form the 1123rd Flexible Gunnery Training Group. The 1121st became the 329th. The 536th and the 760th Flexible Gunnery Training Groups were added to the list. Also assigned to the B17 fighting groups was the 31st Altitude Squadron, training for operations at high altitude.\n\nKingman Army Air Field was set up to handle two classes of about 200 students at any one time. During 1943, the policy was to have a class fire 1,200 rounds per student for one week on the Kingman Air to Air Gunnery Range (week five of the training cycle) and then move to Yucca AAF and have them fire 1,000 rounds during the second week.\n\nInitially, the ammunition used was .30 caliber. As the .50 caliber machine gun became available, the use of the .30 caliber was phased out. The P-39 and P-63 aircraft, used as targets, were normally equipped with a 37mm cannon. When the aircraft was in use as a target, this cannon was supposed to be removed and a light replaced it which would signal the gunners when hits were scored on the aircraft. During the latter part of the period this range was operational, the policy was that the gun camera missions were flown on this range and the live fire missions were flown on the Yucca Air to Air Range.\n\nOn April 22, 1944, the Kingman Army Air Field was consolidated and the host unit was redesignated as the 3018th Army Air Force Base Unit. Each of the units on the base became subdivisions of 3018th. During 1944 the 3018th was one of the top training schools in the United States.\n\nAfter 1945 there was no need for a gunnery school - or for the airplanes that carried the guns. That year saw the base wind down to a stop. On November 15, 1945, the property was declared surplus, and between 1946 and 1950 the various parcels were returned and leases cancelled.\n\nAfter the war the Reconstruction Finance Corporation established five large storage, sales and scrapping centers for Army Air Forces aircraft. These were located at: Albuquerque AAF, New Mexico, Altus AAF, Oklahoma, Kingman, Arizona, Ontario AAF, California and Walnut Ridge AAF, Arkansas. A sixth facility for storing, selling and scrapping Navy and Marine aircraft was located at Clinton, Oklahoma.\n\nEstimates of the number of excess surplus airplanes ran as high as 150,000. Consideration was given to storing a substantial number of these. By the summer of 1945, at least 30 sales-storage depots and 23 sales centers were in operation. In November 1945, it was estimated a total of 117,210 aircraft would be transferred as surplus.\n\nBetween 1945 and June 1947, the RFC, War Assets Corporation and the War Assets Administration (disposal function of the RFC was transferred to WAC on January 15, 1946, and to the WAA in March 1946) processed approximately 61,600 World War II aircraft, of which 34,700 were sold for flyable purposes and 26,900, primarily combat types, were sold for scrapping.\n\nWar Assets Administration came to Kingman AAF to set up Sales & Storage Depot No. 41. Depot 41 was to sell off the base buildings and equipment. Not only that, it would store aircraft from the Army Air Force. Some reports estimated that approximately 10,000 warbirds were flown to Kingman in 1945 and 1946 for storage and sale, but official records indicate that number ended up being closer to 5,500. Thirty eight of the 118 B-32 Dominator Very Heavy (VH) bombers, built by Convair at Fort Worth, TX, were flown there, including several straight from the assembly line. Five of Kingman's B-32s had participated in the 312th Bombardment Group's overseas activities in the closing days of World War II.\n\nMost of the transports and trainers could be used in the civil fleet, and trainers were sold for $875 to $2,400. The fighters and bombers were of little peacetime use, although several P-38 Lightnings were sold to individuals for use in air racing. Typical prices for surplus aircraft were:\n\nMany aircraft from the various War Assets locations were transferred to schools, and to communities for memorial use for a minimal fee. A Boy Scout troop bought a B-17 for $350. The only B-17 known to have made it out of Kingman was B-17D #40-3097 named \"The Swoose\", which is currently (as of 2015) under restoration at the U.S. Air Force Museum's Dayton Ohio facility.\n\nGeneral sales were conducted from these centers across the U.S.; however, the idea for long-term storage, considering the approximate cost of $20 per month per aircraft, was soon discarded, and in June 1946, the remaining aircraft, except those at Altus, were put up for scrap bid.\n\nAfter the Sales-Storage No. Depot 41 completed its job in late 1948, the airfield was turned over to Mohave County to be used as an airport for the county.\n\nWith the disposal of the military aircraft completed, Kingman AAF was returned to civilian use in 1949.\n\nAll but a few of the original Kingman Army Airfield buildings have been removed. The property was formerly used as a support facility for aircraft training and has been redeveloped into a civil airport and industrial park. Today, large numbers of civilian airliners are stored there and remarketed or recycled into spare parts and into their base metals.\n\nThe Kingman Army Airfield Historical Society was also established, creating a museum to preserve the field's history with artifacts, photos, and displays. It also includes recognition of all conflicts in which Americans have served.\n\nThe airport has a significant aircraft bone-yard. Of the aircraft stored there, several belonged to DHL and Delta Air Lines.\n\nSoldiers trained by shooting clay pigeons made with coal tar pitch, which contained polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAHs). Debris from these targets and lead from the projectiles remained in the area until 2014. A 2010 site inspection of the former gun training range of about 75 acres showed \"soil samples [...] contained PAHs concentrations 1,000 times higher than permitted under 2007 Arizona residential risk-based screening levels and 10,000 times higher than the updated 2012 U.S. Environmental Protection Agency residential risk-based screening levels\". Lead from the projectiles could travel nearly 900 feet. From 2013 until July 2014, the top two feet of soil and landscaping on 55 residential lots were removed and replaced. Starting October 2014 through October 2016, 284 residential properties will be soil tested.\n\nKingman Airport covers an area of 4,200 acres (1,700 ha) at an elevation of 3,449 feet (1,051 m) above mean sea level. It has two runways with asphalt surfaces: 3/21 is 6,827 by 150 feet (2,081 x 46 m); 17/35 is 6,725 by 75 feet (2,050 x 23 m).\n\nFor the 12-month period ending April 30, 2011, the airport had 44,137 aircraft operations, an average of 120 per day: 95% general aviation, 4% scheduled commercial, 1% air taxi, and <1% military. At that time there were 185 aircraft based at this airport: 51% single-engine, 23% multi-engine, 23% jet, 1% helicopter, 1% ultralight, and 1% glider.\n\nNo airlines serve the airport as of late 2018.\n\n\n"}

In 1860, Zöllner sent his discovery in a letter to physicist and scholar Johann Christian Poggendorff, editor of \"Annalen der Physik und Chemie\", who subsequently discovered the related Poggendorff illusion in Zöllner's original drawing.\n\nOne depiction of the illusion consists of a series of parallel, black diagonal lines which are crossed with short, repeating lines, the direction of the crossing lines alternating between horizontal and vertical. This creates the illusion that the black lines are not parallel. The shorter lines are on an angle to the longer lines, and this angle helps to create the impression that one end of the longer lines is nearer to the viewer than the other end. This is similar to the way the Wundt illusion appears. It may be that the Zöllner illusion is caused by this impression of depth.\n\nThis illusion is similar to the Hering illusion, the Poggendorff illusion and the Müller-Lyer illusion. All these illusions demonstrate how lines can seem to be distorted by their background.\n"}

It was housed in the Read Block building, on the site of the home of colonial poet Anne Bradstreet. The Tasty closed in 1997, after 81 years in business. Its location was later used by the chain stores Abercrombie & Fitch, then Citizens Bank and, the current occupant, a CVS Pharmacy.\n\nThe Tasty was a tiny one-room diner and lunch counter, its customer area no more than seven feet wide and thirty feet deep, with a narrow counter made of yellow linoleum. A Harvard Business School student once deemed it \"the most profitable restaurant in New England per sq ft\", at . The Tasty had 14 stools. On busy nights it would be crammed with 60-80 people (from actual head counts) at a time. On these nights between 300–400 burgers were served between the hours of midnight and 4:00 AM.\n\nA large map, studded with pins, covered the back wall of the diner and claimed to pinpoint the origins of postcards from customers over the years. In keeping with the informal atmosphere of the diner — where the cooks, including Tom Sweet, who managed The Tasty on the graveyard shift until the summer of 1976, and chef Charlie Coney — were sometimes compared to bartenders and frequently chatted with customers.\n\nBy the end of its existence, The Tasty had attracted both long-time residents and, by virtue both of its proximity to Harvard Yard and its late opening hours, numerous students from Harvard University, and had become one of the few places where students and residents, and residents from different social and economic classes, mixed informally. According to one historian, \"you could sit next to a professor on your left, and a homeless person on your right\".\n\nThe Tasty was often referred to in the press as a \"local landmark\" or \"institution\", and was immortalized in film during a scene in \"Good Will Hunting\". It was also used in a scene during \"Love Story\", Erich Segal's story of a privileged Harvard Law School student (Ryan O’Neal) and his working-class girlfriend (Ali MacGraw). It is also the subject of Federico Muchnik's 2005 documentary, \"Touching History\".\n\nDespite a struggle by its owner Peter Haddad, the Tasty’s tenancy ended in November 1997. A sign in its window during the move-out stated its lifespan: \"81 years. 29,565 days. 5,913,000 people. 422,357 per stool.\" Its landlord, the Cambridge Savings Bank, took advantage of the increasing attractiveness of the Harvard Square neighborhood to chain store franchises, which enabled the bank to charge significantly higher rents to tenants who provided greater security. Opposition to the end of the Tasty's tenancy was voiced by a number of groups, including the Harvard Square Defense Fund and brothers Tom and Ray Magliozzi, 'Click and Clack, the Tappet Brothers' on their radio talk show, \"Car Talk\". The Tasty became a \"cause célèbre\" and a symbol of the transitions the neighborhood was undergoing.\n\nDespite having brought considerable evidence attesting to the historical value of the diner and the important social role it played in Harvard Square, the supporters of the Tasty did not prevail; however, the Cambridge City Council required that the distinctive entrance to the Tasty be preserved, giving it landmark status, and it remains unmodified today. The attention paid to the closing of the Tasty by the Cambridge City Council in the Winter of 1997 occasioned a rebuke from the Harvard Square Business Association, who criticized the council for becoming involved in a private, contractual matter.\n\nFor a time, an Abercrombie & Fitch store operated in the building on the site formerly occupied by the Tasty. This store was later succeeded by a branch office of Citizens Bank, and the actual space in which the Tasty once operated became occupied by a row of Citizens Bank ATMs. As Muchnik remarks, \"if you look at the bank in the Read Block today, you have one door too many\" — the extraneous door, a second entrance to the small ATM lobby, being that of the former diner. Following a relocation of Citizens Bank to Brattle Square, a CVS Pharmacy since opened in its place.\n\nThe end of the Tasty's tenure in the Square is considered a side effect of gentrification; the small, confined space of the Tasty, its prices (far lower than any other restaurant in the Square at the time of its closing) and friendly neighborhood atmosphere attracted patrons from all socio-economic strata and contrasted, in many ways, with the more upscale stores and restaurants emerging — and transforming — the Harvard Square community.\n\nThe local hamburger chain \"Tasty Burger\" opened a location not far from the Tasty in 2012. Its design is \"meant to invoke\" the Tasty, and using similar lettering for its logo.\n\n"}

He has played with such orchestras as I Solisti Veneti, Moscow Virtuosi Chamber Orchestra, Tchaikovsky Symphony Orchestra of Russia, Istanbul State Symphony Orchestra, Orquesta di Valencia, the State Academic Symphony Orchestra of Russia, the State Symphony Orchestra \"New Russia\", the Moscow Symphony Orchestra, the Irkutsk Philharmonic Symphony Orchestra (Russia), the Moscow Chamber \"The Seasons\" Orchestra (Russia), the National Chamber Orchestra of Moldova and the Wuppertal Plucked Orchestra (Germany). In addition to numerous appearances in Russia, he has performed in Ukraine, Belarus, Moldova, Estonia, Poland, Italy, Germany, USA, Canada and Japan. He has played in the Great Hall of the Moscow Conservatory, the Tchaikovsky Concert Hall, the Osaka Symphony Hall, and the Hall of Columns of the National Philharmonic Society (Kiev, Ukraine). He appeared at the Festival of Russian Culture (Los Angeles, California, USA, 2004), at the opening ceremony of the 49th International Book Fair (Warsaw, Poland, 2004), and at the guitar in Nürtingen, in 2002.\n\nIllarionov's repertoire is broad and versatile. It ranges across various periods and styles: music of the Renaissance and Baroque (Luis Milan, Alonso Mudarra, John Dowland, J. S. Bach), original music for guitar from the 19th and early 20th centuries (Fernando Sor, Mauro Giuliani, Francisco Tárrega), and music of the 20th and 21st centuries (Frank Martin, Alexandre Tansman, Manuel Ponce, Joaquín Rodrigo, Joaquín Turina, Agustín Barrios, Mario Castelnuovo-Tedesco, William Walton, Sérgio Assad, Roland Dyens, Dusan Bogdanovic, Angelo Gilardino, the unique cycle \"24 Preludes and Fugues for Solo Guitar\" by Igor Rekhin), as well as compositions for guitar with orchestra and chamber music.\n\nDimitri Illarionov has recorded the CD \"Premieres\" with the Moscow Chamber \"The Seasons\" Orchestra (conductor – Vladislav Bulakhov) for Les Éditions Doberman-Yppan; two solo CDs: by Naxos Records (Laureate Series) and the CD \"East Side Story\" (Daminus Records) with music written by modern Eastern European composers. Illarionov's \"Classical Duo\" CD (Delos Records) with Russian cellist Boris Andrianov entered the long-list of the 2004 Grammy Awards.\n\n“... with such temperament, musicianship, richness of colour, radiance, sense of timing and feeling the acoustic qualities of his soft-toned instrument that the combination of all these abilities, coupled with an evident gift for entertainment, is the best expressed in one single word: wow!” - \"Tages-Anzeiger\" (Zurich, Switzerland)\n\n“Truly, this guitarist is a phenomenon.” – \"El Norte\" (Monterrey, México)\n\n“Dimitri Illarionov’s concert was one of the \"top five classical concerts\" of 2003 in Edmonton (...) According to this standard, elegant and dramatic Angela Hewitt was a shoo-in (and a red-hot number at that). Classical guitarist Dimitri Illarionov had the same kind of charisma. The chemistry between the audience and this young Russian guitarist was exceptional.” - \"Vue Weekly\" (Edmonton, Alberta, Canada)\n\n“An outstanding virtuoso” – Oliver Hochkeppel, \"Sueddeutsche Zeitung\" (Germany)\n\n“...he displayed a firework of virtuosity – the filigree of sounds rivaled the incredibly swift technique of fingers and ardent warmth of bursts of emotions. Only an encore performance could satisfy the storms of applause from the audience.” – \"Westdeutsche Zeitung\" (Germany)\n\n“I felt like I was struck by lightning the moment he touched the guitar. It sent chills down my spine. I have never experienced anything like it. Incredible! Simply incredible!” – \"Irma Wassall\" (1908-2012) – Poet Laureate and founder of the Wichita Society of the Classical Guitar (USA)\n\n“It was one of the most inspiring guitar performances I have ever heard.”- \"Dusan Bogdanovic\" – guitarist and composer.

The Oakland Athletics defeated the Baltimore Orioles, three games to two. Games 1 and 2 were played in Memorial Stadium in Baltimore; Games 3–5 were played at the Oakland Coliseum. It was the second match-up between the two teams in the ALCS.\n\nIn Game 1, Jim Palmer spent 16 minutes retiring the side in the top of the first inning. He walked the first two batters and struck out the next three. The Orioles went to work against lefty Vida Blue and his successor, Horacio Piña in the bottom half. Merv Rettenmund singled and Paul Blair walked before Tommy Davis's RBI double put the Orioles up 1–0. Don Baylor then walked and one out later, Earl Williams's two-run single knocked Pina out of the game. Andy Etchebarren was hit by a pitch to load the bases and Mark Belanger's RBI single made it 4–0 Orioles. They added to their lead on Etchebarren's RBI single in the seventh and Baylor's RBI single in the eighth, both with two on off of Blue Moon Odom. It was more than they needed as Palmer pitched a five-hit shutout, striking out 12 A's along the way.\n\nThe Orioles' ALCS winning streak was snapped at 10 in Game 2. Bert Campaneris led off the game with a home run off of Dave McNally, but the Orioles tied the game in the bottom of the first when Al Bumbry drew to leadoff walk, moved to third on a single and scored on Tommy Davis's groundout. Back-to-back home runs leading off the sixth by Joe Rudi and Sal Bando off of McNally put the A's up 3–1. In the bottom half, the Orioles got back-to-back leadoff singles before Earl Williams's one-out RBI double cut Oakland's lead to 3–2. Bando's second home run of the game in the eighth off of McNally padded Oakland's lead to 5–2. The Orioles hit two singles in the bottom half off of Catfish Hunter, who was relieved by Rollie Fingers and Brooks Robinson's RBI single made it 5–3 Oakland, but they got that run back in the ninth when Angel Mangual hit a leadoff single off of Bob Reynolds, moved to third on a sacrifice bunt and passed ball, and scored on Campaneris's single. Hunter, who served up so many during the season that he threatened an A.L. record, allowed none as the A's evened the series as the two teams headed to Oakland for Game 3.\n\nThe third game, postponed a day by the lack of a dome—the postponement trigged a rhubarb between A.L. President Joe Cronin and A's President Charlie Finley—was played at Oakland and produced a brilliant pitching battle between a pair of southpaws, Mike Cuellar of Baltimore and Ken Holtzman. Up to that point, Cuellar had allowed only three hits. he had a one-hit shutout for the first seven innings as he carefully nursed a 1–0 lead given him by Earl Williams' homer in the second inning. But in the eighth, pinch-hitter Jesús Alou singled and pinch-runner Allan Lewis was sacrificed to second by Mike Andrews. The play was controversial in that Cuellar appeared to have a force out at second base, but he ignored catcher Etchebarren's yells and took the safe out at first. This proved costly as, one out later, Joe Rudi singled home Lewis to tie the score. Bert Campaneris, first man up in the 11th, snapped a 1–1 tie by hitting Cuellar's second pitch over the left-field fence for a home run.\n\nIn Game 4, The A's knocked out Jim Palmer with a three-run outburst in the second inning. After a leadoff double and subsequent single, Ray Fosse's double scored two and Dick Green's double scored another. The A's made it 4–0 in the sixth on Fosse's bases-loaded sacrifice fly off of Bob Reynolds. Vida Blue pitched six shutout innings before falling apart in the seventh. Earl Williams drew a base on balls with one out and Don Baylor followed with a single. Brooks Robinson came through with a run-producing single and Andy Etchebarren hit the next pitch for a home run, making the score 4–4. The next inning, Bobby Grich hit a home run off Rollie Fingers and that, coupled with Grant Jackson's stout relief pitching, gave the game to the Orioles.\n\nA surprisingly small crowd of 24,265 showed up for the final game and they saw Catfish Hunter pitch a five-hit shutout, winning 3–0. The A's first run in the game come in the third inning when Ray Fosse reached first on an error by third baseman Brooks Robinson, moved to second on a sacrifice bunt, and scored on a single by Joe Rudi. Right-hander Doyle Alexander lasted only until the fourth inning. In that frame he was the victim of a single by Gene Tenace, who scored on a triple by Vic Davalillo before Jesus Alou added an RBI single. He was relieved by Palmer, who shut out Oakland the rest of the way, but the Orioles were helpless against Hunter's powerful pitching as the A's advanced to the World Series.\n\nPitching dominated the 5-game set, the victorious A's batting only .200 while the O's hit just .211.\n\n1973 ALCS (3–2): Oakland A's over Baltimore Orioles\n"}

Love Field is north of Prescott, in Yavapai County, Arizona. Love Field is used for general aviation and facilitates scheduled passenger airline service to Denver and Los Angeles.\n\nMost traffic at PRC is training flights from Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University but includes training flights from operations including Guidance Aviation and North-Aire.\n\nThe National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems categorized it as a \"primary commercial service\" airport. Federal Aviation Administration records say the airport had 10,337 passenger boardings (enplanements) in calendar year 2018.\n\nThe City of Prescott announced that passenger totals for 2009 were 11,690. Reaching over 10,000 boardings will allow the airport to get a million-dollar grant each year for the next five years for improvement projects. This also prompted Great Lakes Airlines to add a second daily weekday flight to Denver.\n\nThe first airline flights at Prescott were TWA DC-3s in late 1947.\n\nThe airport is named for Ernest A. Love (1895–1918), First Lieutenant, United States Army Air Service. Love was born in New Mexico and raised in Prescott. He was a graduate of Prescott High School, and studied mechanical engineering at Stanford. He served in World War I and was shot down near Verdun, France on 16 September 1918, and died of his wounds as a prisoner of war a few days later. Lieutenant Love is buried at Arlington National Cemetery. The hamlet of Love, Arizona is also named for him.\n\nErnest A. Love Field covers at an elevation of . It has three asphalt runways: \n\nPlans to extend Runway 3R/21L and Runway 3L/21R were mentioned in the latest master plan update in 2009. The extension onto Runway 3R/21L would be more than 3,300 feet and the extension onto Runway 3L/21R would be more than 1,300 feet.\n\nIn the year ending March 31, 2011 the airport had 244,080 aircraft operations, average 668 per day: 98.2% general aviation, 1.6% air taxi, <1% military, and <1% airline. 232 aircraft were then based at this airport: 89% single-engine, 8% multi-engine, 1% helicopter, 1% jet, and <1% glider.\n\nIn 2019, the City of Prescott received a $10 million Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) grant for construction of a new terminal building. The building will also be funded with $1 million from the state of Arizona and $3.5 million of local funds. The new building will have more space for passengers, security, and airline operations. The existing building is considered \"antiquated and undersized\". Construction is expected to begin before the end of 2019.\n\nGreat Lakes Airlines served the airport since 2008, when Mesa Airlines terminated their agreement. Although Great Lakes Airlines over the last few years ran into staffing issues due to the nationwide pilot shortage, Prescott has always been one of their top destinations. In 2016, the company turned itself around and was able to pull out of its staffing problems by signing a contract with Frontier Airlines to agree to employ their pilots after they have completed a required employment period with Great Lakes first. The company currently flies to Los Angeles and Phoenix. The company cut back on the destinations it served so it could dramatically increase reliability and staffing abilities towards its profitable airports. Prescott in November received the first of several planned upgrades by the company. Great Lakes increased its total round trip daily flights to/from Los Angeles from 2 flights a day to 4. On December 17, 2016 part 2 of the upgrade plan took place, which included bringing in a larger aircraft, an Embraer EMB-120 which includes 30 seats, restroom facilities and flight attendant service. The company has also leased a corporate maintenance hangar on the airfield and plans to employ a full-time aircraft mechanic to turn Prescott into a west coast maintenance hub. Finally, the airline resumed flying to Denver, CO twice per week with one-stop in Farmington, NM. In 2017 Great Lakes reverted to 2 flights per day to Los Angeles and 2 flights per week to Denver using Beech 1900D aircraft. On March 26, 2018, Great Lakes Airlines ceased operations, terminating all scheduled flights from Ernest A. Love Field.\n\nOn July 17, 2018, United Airlines announced service from Ernest A. Love Field to Denver and Los Angeles with each running a daily flight, which began on August 29, 2018. United Airlines service is operated by SkyWest Airlines dba United Express operating 50 seat Bombardier CRJ-200 jet aircraft.\n\nThe following is a list of all known air carriers that have served Prescott. Most of these airlines provided flights to Phoenix and Las Vegas.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2182087", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2182087", "title": "Baird T. Spalding", "text": "Baird T. Spalding\n\nBaird Thomas Spalding (1872–1953) was an American spiritual writer, author of the spiritual book series: \"Life and Teaching of the Masters of the Far East\".\n\nAlthough Spalding's books claimed he was born in England in 1857, Spalding was also reported born in North Cohocton, New York in 1872. He spent much of his life as a mining engineer in the American West. Research on his life and the purported eleven person research expeditions to the Far East beginning in 1894 to study the \"Masters\" has turned up evidence and pictures that are included in later volumes of his book. Spalding visited the Far East first in the late 1800s and then again in the 1920s and then again in the 1935 trip to India at the bequest of his publisher, Devorss & Company. Anecdotal biographical detail was widely promulgated even during his lifetime. At his death in 1953 in Arizona, obituaries conflictingly cited his age as 95 or 107. \nHis date of birth is given as \"1872-1873\" in the 1880 US census. However, that could mean that was the time he first came to the US as at that time it was common for foreigners to be given a new birth date and name when they first arrive in the US.\nThe same date is given in a 1911 California marriage certificate. In other records his place of birth is given as England with him emigrating to the US later.\n\nSpalding did briefly visit India in 1935 as there is a US passport application dated 1935, and a Seattle immigration record on his return from India, dated 1936.\nA biography of Spalding, \"Baird T Spalding As I Knew Him\" was published by fellow mystic and DeVorss author David Bruton in 1954. About Spalding's claims regarding his birthplace, Bruton wrote:\n\nIn 1924, Spalding published the first volume of \"Life and Teaching of the Masters of the Far East\". It describes the travels to India and Tibet of a research party of eleven scientists in 1894. During their trip they claim to have made contact with \"the Great Masters of the Himalayas\", immortal beings with whom they lived and studied, gaining insight into their lives and spiritual message. This close contact enabled them to witness many of the spiritual principles evinced by these Great Masters translated into their everyday lives, which Spalding describes as acts that can be accomplished by anyone who comes to know his \"TRUE\" self. Such examples are walking on water, or manifesting bread to feed the hungry party - similar to some acts performed by eastern masters in more recent times. \nHowever, despite most of the action taking place in India, the Great Masters make it clear that the greatest embodiment of the Enlightened state is that of the Christ - the discovery of man's source of power within himself - that light of God - the Christ consciousness is that \"Christ\" state:\nThe Masters accept that Buddha represents the Way to Enlightenment, but they clearly set forth that the Christ Consciousness \"is\" Enlightenment, or a state of consciousness for which we are all seeking – the Christ light of every individual; therefore, the light of every child born into the world.\n\nSpalding published three additional volumes before his death in 1953. Volumes 5 and 6 were published by DeVorss & Co posthumously from various articles that Spalding had written.\n\nSpalding's books have remained in print since his death and his stories have helped to popularize the concept of Ascended Masters which became a common meme in New Age and alternative religious movements during the later twentieth century.\n\nDuring the 1920s, Spalding was a personal acquaintance of Guy Ballard, also a mining engineer and founder of the I AM activity. Similar themes to Spalding can be seen in Ascended Master groups such as the Church Universal and Triumphant and the writings of Elizabeth Clare Prophet. Spalding is named as an influence in the writings of New Age figures such as JZ Knight, Paul Baumann of the Methernitha sect and Father Divine.\n\nThe growth of the New Age movement during the 1970s resulted in a renewal of interest in Spalding, and several New Age figures have claimed tenuous connections to him after his death. American mystic Thane of Hawaii, founder of the Prosperos group, claimed in 1974 to have ghost-written several of Spalding's later books and accompanied him on his 1935 India tour.\n\nThere is a Vietnamese book, apparently first published in 1975, called \"Hành Trình Về Phương Đông\" by one Nguyên Phong. It purports to be the translation of a book written by Spalding in India in 1924. The book has gained some popularity in Vietnam, and an English translation was published in 2009, as \"Journey to the East\".\nIn the story, Spalding is joined in India by a group of prestigious mystics and academics, including Paul Brunton and Walter Evans-Wentz.\n\n"}

He first gained brief national attention at the age of 18 when remarks he made in a speech to the high school graduating class of Rock Island, Illinois, sharply critical of oppressive attitudes towards youth by older generations of Americans, were widely reported in the American press. He defended his remarks in subsequent radio and television appearances by pointing to the historical contribution of youth to social idealism and cultural innovation.\n\nHe won the Best First Book Award from the American Academy of Religion in 2001 for his book \"The Manichaean Body in Discipline and Ritual\", notable for its analysis of religions as goal-oriented systems of practice rationalized within particular models of reality. His evident interest in the role religions play in forming and organizing the individual self can be seen in his multi-volume study of Augustine of Hippo.\n\nHis 2003 book, \"Truth in Translation: Accuracy and Bias in English Translations of the New Testament\", generated considerable controversy for highlighting cases of theological bias in the translation process, by which, he argues, contemporary Christian views are anachronistically introduced into the Bible versions upon which most modern English-speaking Christians rely.\n\nIn 2013 he published \"The First New Testament\", which offers a (partial) reconstructed translation into English of the first Christian canon of scripture in Greek, created in the 2nd century C.E. by the Christian leader Marcion.\n\nHe was named a Guggenheim Fellow in 2004.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2182107", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2182107", "title": "Land Walker", "text": "Land Walker\n\nThe Land Walker is the first , two-legged exoskeleton robot with a cockpit and two cannons mounted on the arms that for now shoots out rubber balls. It does not actually walk, however, instead shuffling on wheels hidden under its \"feet\" at approximately . This means it is not technically a walker; it merely has the appearance of one. It was invented by Masaaki Nagumo and created by researchers who hope to someday create similar robots to be used in the military and in defense against crimes. But for now it is used as a way to promote the idea of robotic defense.\n\nThe Land Walker stands at about tall, weighing about . It \"walks\", or shuffles, at a speed of around . It has a cockpit, similar to a small airplane, big enough to seat one human. Two cannons are mounted on the arms of the robot which shoots out rubber or plastic balls. It is the world's first genuine bipedal robot because unlike previous robots that are unipedal, the Land Walker moves its feet one at a time by shuffling each foot with wheels.\n\nThe Sakakibara Kikai Company researchers in Japan built the Land Walker to initially be used in exhibits and demonstrations, as it is not yet the perfect robot. For now it shoots soft rubber balls from its two cannons, but someday it could shoot out more severe weapons, like bullets and bombs. With more research development and funding, a bigger motor, and more speed, the Land Walker could become a powerful defense, as well as a great psychological weapon because it would intimidate and cause fear in opponents.\n\nThe concept of giant, human-like robots have been around for years. These ideas appear in TV shows such as \"The Six Million Dollar Man\", films such as \"Alien\" and \"Star Wars\", and science fiction comics and books. People like the idea of these giant robots because it keeps the dreams of people alive, meaning that they stay hopeful that one day these robots will exist. Although the Land Walker was created in 2006 as the first bipedal robot, there are many more similar robots throughout history from different countries and cultures.\n\nThe idea of two-legged giant robots has been around for years. Mecha, \"meka\" in Japanese, refers to all things mechanical, including cars, computers, and even human-like robots. Mechas are popular in the science fiction genre of video games, films, comics, and TV series; typically, they work in construction, politics, or fighting wars. Additionally, \"mecha\" is used to refer to large and bulky suits that protect the human. In contemporary Western culture, \"mecha\" is often used to refer to building sized robots.\n\nThe Land Walker is very similar to the biped robot Enryu, which was also created by the Sakakibara Kikai Co. in Tmsuk, Japan. The Enryu stands at a height of . It shuffles faster than the Land Walker because it uses caterpillar-like tracks instead of legs. It was built to help in emergency situations, like rushing into a burning building, lifting heavy objects, and rescuing people. Its arms act like human arms, which is different from the Land Walker's arms.\n\nWeighing around and standing at about tall, the Kid's Walker Cyclops is a battery-operated mecha made for the purpose of kids playing around. It has a cockpit that children sit in to control the arms of the mecha, which has a grappling hook and a power drill. It moves by shuffling its feet, which is similar to the Land Walker's movement.\n\nToyota Motor Corp. created a biped robot called the i-Foot in 2004 that can carry a human up a flight of stairs. This is a significant invention because it helps the disabled get around easier.\n\nMachines like the Land Walker demonstrate how technology can be used to enhance human abilities. Also, the technology and use of these mecha indicate their feasibility for military use. The robots can be made to climb over terrain and obstacles that military tanks cannot cope with. Moreover, these giant robots have heights greater than humans and can see over humans and look down upon opponents, further aiding the military. However, a disadvantage is that the legs of these robots are very expensive and intricate, so it limits the number of robots that can be created.\n\n\n"}

Known for her distinctive and powerful voice, Wash first achieved fame as half of the Two Tons O' Fun, who sang backing for American disco singer Sylvester. After gaining their own record deal, they released three consecutive commercially successful songs which all peaked at number 2 in the dance charts. The duo was renamed The Weather Girls in 1982 after they released the top-selling single \"It's Raining Men\", which brought them to mainstream pop attention. The Weather Girls released five albums and were heavily featured on Sylvester's albums.\n\nAfter disbanding in 1988, Wash transitioned to house music as a featured artist on several successful songs. Her success on \"Billboard\"'s Dance chart has earned her the honorific title The Queen of Clubland, with a total of twelve number-one songs on the chart to date.\n\nWash is also noted for sparking legislation in the early 1990s that made vocal credits mandatory on CDs and music videos after she had been denied credit and royalties for many of the songs she recorded, including the platinum-selling song \"Gonna Make You Sweat (Everybody Dance Now)\" after she had been labeled \"unmarketable\" due to her weight. In December 2016, \"Billboard magazine\" ranked her as the 58th most successful dance artist of all-time.\n\nAt a young age, Wash enrolled in McKinley Elementary. She also attended and graduated from San Francisco Polytechnic High School, where she sang in the school choir. During her time in high school, the school choir traveled and performed throughout Europe for two weeks. Wash also appeared on four albums in the school choir. Shortly after graduating high school, Wash joined a gospel group NOW (News of the World), which also consisted of Izora Rhodes. Wash also worked as a secretary for UC Hospital.\n\nIn February 1976, Wash auditioned as a backup singer before American singer-songwriter Sylvester and his manager Brent Thomson. Impressed with her vocal performance, Sylvester inquired if she had another large black friend who could sing, after which she introduced him to Izora Rhodes. Although he referred to them simply as \"the girls\", Wash and Rhodes formed a musical duo called Two Tons O' Fun (sometimes referred to as \"The Two Tons\"). Two Tons O' Fun debuted as Sylvester's backing vocalists on his self-titled third album \"Sylvester\", released in 1977. The duo sang backup vocals on the album's singles \"Down, Down, Down\" and \"Over and Over\", which charted at number eighteen on the \"Billboard\" Dance chart. In an interview with Daily Xtra!, Wash stated that working alongside Sylvester helped her hone her own vocal stylings. In 1978, Sylvester released his fourth album \"Step II\", which also featured The Two Tons' background vocals throughout the album. \"Dance (Disco Heat)\", the album's lead single which featured The Tons, peaked at number one on \"Billboard\" Dance chart and became their first number-one single on that chart. In 1979, Two Tons O' Fun sang background on Sylvester's live album \"Living Proof\". Later that year, the duo secured their own record deal with Fantasy Records.\n\nOn January 24, 1980, the duo released their debut self-titled album \"Two Tons of Fun\". The album spawned two top-five dance singles: \"Earth Can Be Just Like Heaven\" and \"I Got the Feeling\". Their second album \"Backatcha\" was released later that year. The album spawned a single \"I Depend On You\" that peaked at number seventy-two on the Dance chart.\n\nIn September 1982, the duo released their single \"It's Raining Men\". The song became their biggest hit, peaking at number one on the Dance chart and number forty-six on \"Billboard\"'s Hot 100 chart. Following the success of the song, Two Tons o Fun changed their group name to The Weather Girls. On January 22, 1983, they released their third album \"Success\". The album's titled-track \"Success\" was released as the second single and peaked at number eighty-nine on the R&B chart. In 1985, The Weather Girls released their fourth album \"Big Girls Don't Cry\". In 1986, she released a song \"Breakin' The Ice\" on the soundtrack for the Paramount feature film \"Gung Ho\". In 1988, The Weather Girls released their self-titled fourth album \"The Weather Girls\", Wash's final album with the duo. Shortly after the album, The Weather Girls disbanded and Wash took up a solo career and also began working as a session vocalist. She contributed background vocals on Aretha Franklin's single \"Freeway of Love\" for her album \"Who's Zoomin' Who?\" (1988).\n\nIn 1989, Wash recorded a song \"(You're My One and Only) True Love\" as a demo, produced by David Cole who would later form the C+C Music Factory. Cole later gave the song to then-upcoming female group Seduction. The song appeared on Seduction's debut album \"Nothing Matters Without Love\", released in September 1989, retaining the use of Wash's lead vocals and added Seduction's background vocals to the song. In addition, she was only credited for her background vocals and Cole remixed and altered Wash's lead vocals of the song to make her voice less recognizable on the song. \"(You're My One and Only) True Love\" was released as Seduction's second single in July 1989. The single became an unexpected success when it peaked at number twenty-three on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart and number three on the Dance chart. Wash would eventually file a lawsuit against the producers and A&M Records for unauthorized use of her voice. The case reached an out-of-court settlement in December 1990.\n\nIn the summer of 1989, Italian house music group Black Box recruited Wash initially as a session singer to demo their upcoming songs. Wash demoed a total of six songs for the group. Despite being recruited strictly for demoing the songs, Black Box retained the use of Wash vocals on the songs and released them on their debut album \"Dreamland\". In December 1989, Black Box released their second single \"I Don't Know Anybody Else\". The song, which featured Wash's vocals, became an international hit and peaked in the top-ten positions of many countries. The group followed up with release of another single \"Everybody Everybody\", also featuring Wash, which became another international success. Despite Wash's contributions to the songs, Black Box never credited Wash for her vocals and instead used French fashion model Katrin Quinol to lip-sync Wash's vocals during music videos, televised performances, and concert performances. Wash initially became aware of the scandal and sued RCA Records and Black Box for commercial appropriation in September 1990. RCA settled the case out-of-court in December 1990, agreeing to pay Wash a \"substantial\" financial fee. The company also signed her to an eight-album recording contract and financed her national tour. In addition, many of Black Box's releases that contained Wash's vocals were re-issued with her sleeve credits. Black Box continued releasing singles in 1991 which saw the release of the top-ten international hit \"Strike It Up\", \"Fantasy\" and \"Open Your Eyes\".\n\nIn November 1990, the C+C Music Factory released their debut single \"Gonna Make You Sweat (Everybody Dance Now)\", which featured Wash's uncredited vocals on the chorus. The song became an international hit, peaking at number one on \"Billboard\"'s Hot 100, and selling over a million copies in the United States. After discovering that the group was using model-turned-singer Zelma Davis in the music video, Wash attempted to negotiate with the producers of the C+C Music Factory for sleeve credits and royalties which ultimately proved unsuccessful. Additionally, the song used an edited compilation of vocal parts that Wash recorded in June 1990 for an unrelated demonstration tape. On December 11, 1991, Wash filed a lawsuit in the Los Angeles Superior Court against C+C Music Factory's Robert Clivilles and David Cole, charging the producers and their record company, Sony Music Entertainment, with fraud, deceptive packaging and commercial appropriation. The case was eventually settled in 1994 and as a result of the settlement, Sony made an unprecedented request to MTV to add a disclaimer that credited Wash for vocals and Zelma Davis (who lip-synched Wash's vocals in the official music video) for \"visualization\" to the \"Gonna Make You Sweat\" music video.\n\nHer self-titled first solo album \"Martha Wash\" was released on February 23, 1993. The album peaked at number 169 on the Billboard 200, number 42 on the R&B Albums chart, and number 8 on the Heatseekers Albums chart. The album's lead single, \"Carry On\", released on October 30, 1992, became Wash's fifth number-one dance single as a solo artist in the US. The second single \"Give It to You\" also reached number one on the dance chart. The album's third single \"Runaround\" reached the top-ten on the Dance chart, but the follow-up single \"So Whatcha Gonna Do\" failed to the chart. \"Now That You're Gone\" was also released as a promotional single.\n\nIn 1994, the C+C Music Factory, who had just reached an agreement with Wash and her lawsuit, asked Wash to join the group and record on their album. On August 9, 1994, the group released their second album \"Anything Goes!\". The album's lead single \"Do You Wanna Get Funky\" featured a collaboration of Wash, C+C Music Factory, Zelma Davis, and Trilogy. \"Do You Wanna Get Funky\" peaked at number forty on the Hot 100 and number one on the Dance chart. Wash also featured another song \"Takin' Over\" from the album. In the same year, Wash also recorded and released a cover of Jean Knight's \"Mr. Big Stuff\" for the soundtrack of American sports comedy-drama film \"\". In 1995, Wash embarked on an international tour with the C+C Music Factory.\n\nIn 1997, American DJ and record producer Todd Terry released his sixth album \"Ready for a New Day\". The album's lead single \"Keep on Jumpin'\", featuring a collaboration of Terry, Wash, and Jocelyn Brown, was released on June 24, 1996. The song peaked on at number one on the Dance charts and reached the top-ten on the UK Singles chart. On June 9, 1997, they released a follow-up single \"Something Goin' On (In Your Soul)\". The song topped the Dance charts and peaked at number five on the UK Singles chart. Additionally, the song was also certified Silver-status in the United Kingdom.\n\nIn January 1998, Wash released a compilation album \"The Collection\", on Logic Records. The lead single \"It's Raining Men...The Sequel\", which featured RuPaul, peaked at number twenty-two on the Dance chart. The album's second single \"Catch the Light\" became Wash's tenth number-one song on the Dance chart. The album's final single \"Come\" peaked at number four on the Dance chart. Wash was also featured on Todd Terry's single \"Ready for a New Day\", which peaked at number twenty on the Dance chart.\n\nIn 2000, Wash released two singles \"Listen to the People\" and re-recorded version of \"It's Raining Men\". In 2004, she released a gospel single \"You Lift Me Up\". Wash performed at the opening ceremony of the OutGames in Montreal in July 2006. She also performed at numerous Human Rights Campaign events in the U.S. In 2006, Wash appeared as a guest on GSN's \"I've Got a Secret\", and performed \"It's Raining Men\" for the all-gay panel.\n\nDJ Tony Moran's compilation CD \"The Event\" featured a single featuring Martha entitled \"Keep Your Body Working\". It reached No. 1 on \"Billboard\"'s Hot Dance Club Play chart for the week ending December 22, 2007. In 2007, Gay Pimpin' with Jonny McGovern, gay-themed podcast, dedicated an episode to Wash and she obliged them with an extended telephone interview.\n\nIn March 2008, she performed at the annual Big Gay Day in Brisbane, Australia. She also performed at Chicago Pride Parade in June 2008. In August 2009, she performed at the opening ceremony of the NAGAAA Gay Softball World Series.\n\nOn October 1, 2012, she appeared on the Late Show with David Letterman, celebrating the 30th anniversary of the release of \"It's Raining Men\". Wash's second solo album \"Something Good\" was released on January 10, 2013, worldwide. The album's lead single \"I've Got You\", released on April 1, 2011, received positive feedback from critics. In March 2013, she was a special guest for the New York City Gay Men's Chorus during their spring production \"Big Gay Sing 6: Club Night Out\". The second single \"It's My Time\" was released on September 22, 2013. In the same year, Wash also made an appearance in the documentary film \"20 Feet from Stardom\". In February 2014, Wash featured on the song \"Can I Get An Amen?\" for RuPaul's album \"Born Naked\". In March 2014, Wash released a remix of the third single \"I'm Not Coming Down\", which peaked at number two on the Dance chart.\n\nIn February 2015, Wash and Tony Moran released \"Free People,\" which also reached number one on the Dance Club Songs chart. In 2015, Wash formed a group with disco vocalists Evelyn \"Champagne\" King and Linda Clifford called First Ladies of Disco. The group released their debut single \"Show Some Love\" in March 2015, which peaked at number six on the Dance charts. In December 2015, Wash released a single \"N2U\", produced by Showtek and Eva Shaw on Spinnin' Records. In November 2017, Wash collaborated with Turkish singer Serhat, releasing a single with multi-versions of his Eurovision 2016 entry \"I Didn't Know\".\n\nIn March 2018, Wash began her YouTube web series called \"10 Minutes with Martha Wash\". In April 2018, Wash released a single \"Come into the Light\". The song was featured on the musical film \"Wholly Broken\" for which Wash plays the role of a woman named \"Rose\". In September 2018, Wash joined the cast of WaistWatchers: The Musical.\n\nIn March 2019, First Ladies of Disco (now composed of Wash, Clifford, and Norma Jean Wright) released their second single \"Don't Stop Me Now\". On August 10, 2019, Wash released a single \"Like Fire\". The song served as the lead single from her third album \"Love & Conflict\". \"Love & Conflict\" was released on January 6, 2020.\n\nAs of 2014, Wash's voice has collectively accumulated a total of fifteen number-one dance singles, placing her among the top singers with the most number-one hits on the U.S. Dance Club Songs chart. Her success as one of the leading singers in the genre of house music would garner her honorific title The Queen of Clubland. She has also been referred to as The Voice. In \"Rolling Stone\", music critic Jason Newman described Martha Wash as \"The Most Famous Unknown Singer of the '90s\".\n\nMartha Wash's work has influenced numerous artists although most notably Drag performer and singer RuPaul. RuPaul stated that \"She merged a gospel voice into pop and dance music seamlessly. Her voice speaks to both the church and a pop ear and was built to cut through the bass of a dance club. The timbre of her voice is so distinctive and beautiful. A lot of gospel-based singers have come and gone in dance music, but she is the one.\" RuPaul has also acknowledged that Wash's song \"Carry On\" comforted him during his mother's passing. Her single with the C+C Music Factory, \"Gonna Make You Sweat (Everybody Dance Now)\" was included in the top-ten VH1's \"100 Greatest Dance Songs\", while \"It's Raining Men\" ranked at number thirty-five.\n\nOn September 14, 2014, Mighty Real: A Fabulous Sylvester Musical, a Broadway musical about Sylvester, debuted in New York City, New York. Wash's likeness was featured in the production and she was portrayed by actress Jacqueline B. Arnold.\n\nThe City of Washington D.C. declared Martha Wash Day in the city in 2016. The City of San Francisco, California declared Martha Wash Day in their city. In the City of Miami, Florida, Wash was presented with the key to the city.\n\nIn 2004, Wash launched her own independent recording label called Purple Rose Records. James Washington, also Wash's manager, is the label's head of A&R. Intended to be a platform for emerging talent and for artists who may be overlooked by major record labels, Purple Rose Records was established in New York City. The first release on the label was the single \"You Lift Me Up\" in September 2004, a song by Wash, which peaked in the top five of \"Billboard\"'s Dance Club Songs chart. \"Something Good\", Wash's second album, was the label's first album released in January 2013. The label has continued to distribute all of Wash's official releases to date.\n\nPurple Rose also began managing other musical acts. First Ladies of Disco, a female group originally composed of Martha Wash, Linda Clifford, and Evelyn \"Champagne\" King, released their debut single \"Show Some Love\" on the label in 2015. The song peaked in the top-ten on \"Billboard\"'s Dance chart. The group has since toured throughout the United States of America on the First Ladies of Disco Tour.

The lawsuit was filed under the truth-in-advertising laws. In the same year, bills were introduced in the New Jersey and New York legislatures to require concert promoters to disclose whether pre-recorded material would be used on stage. Wash's activism and legal wranglings on behalf of recording artists also resulted in eventual federal legislation making vocal credit mandatory for all albums and music videos.\n\nWash, who is viewed as a gay icon, has been involved in LGBT rights and she remains an outspoken advocate for the gay community. In open letter addressed to the LGBT community, Wash acknowledged the support she has received back from community. Wash also stated \"It means the world to me when fans tell me they've followed me through the Sylvester years, or they came out to my music, or someone decided not to take their life. These are the people I sing for. So to all you beautiful people out there I say: stand strong, don't give in and carry on.\" Wash has also been an activist for the fight against HIV/AIDS for more than thirty years after watching close-friend and music mentor Sylvester succumb to the disease. On World AIDS Day in December 2012, she was awarded a Lifetime Achievement Award in San Francisco from the AIDS Emergency Fund for her advocacy and fundraising to provide financial assistance to victims of the disease.\n\nWash is a spokesperson for Quality Services for the Autism Community (QSAC Inc.).

{"id": "2182150", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2182150", "title": "Barbara Cassani", "text": "Barbara Cassani\n\nBarbara Ann Cassani, CBE, (born July 22, 1960) is an American businesswoman. She was the founder under British Airways of budget airline Go Fly and was the first leader of London's bid for the 2012 Summer Olympics.\n\nBarbara Cassani was born in Boston to James and Noreen Cassani. She studied at Mount Holyoke College, graduating \"magna cum laude\" with a BA (Hons) international relations in 1982; and is also a former trustee of Mount Holyoke. Cassani earned a master's degree, again in international relations, from Princeton University's Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs. She was awarded an honorary degree from Cranfield University in 2004.\n\nBarbara Cassani married British investment banker Guy Davis in 1985. The couple have two children, Lauren and James. She is a keen horse rider, and competes in eventing, showjumping, and dressage events. Since stepping down from the Olympic bid, Cassani has been working on plans for a new startup company, and appears as a business and management speaker on the public speaking circuit.\n\nUpon graduation in 1984, she worked as a management consultant for Coopers & Lybrand before moving to work in the US operation of British Airways. There, she worked in sales, marketing, and on the team that integrated Dan-Air into BA's business.\n\nIn 1997, facing increasing competition from low cost airlines Ryanair and EasyJet, British Airways decided to found its own budget offering, to be known as 'Go'. Chief Executive Bob Ayling selected Cassani for the task, giving her only £25 million in seed capital. The company began operations in 1998 and reached profitability two years later. In 2001, Cassani led a management buyout of the company (with most of the funding coming from venture capital firm 3i), and became its first Chief Executive. \n\nIn 2002, Cassani won the \"Veuve Clicquot Businesswoman of the Year award.\" Later that year, the airline was bought by rival EasyJet (a move bitterly opposed by Cassani) and she was not offered a position in the merged company. She next released a book detailing her experiences at Go; \"Go - An Airline Adventure\" () won a number of business publishing awards the following year.\n\nIn October 2003, Cassani became a non-executive director of retailer Marks & Spencer, a position she relinquished when she accepted the Olympic position. After her Olympic tenure, she was one of the executives mooted as taking over as the struggling company's Chief Executive.\n\nIn June 2003, she was appointed to chair London's bid to host the 2012 Summer Olympics. The organizing committee felt that her business background would give the bid a badly needed professionalism; the organizational reputation of British sport had already been tarnished when it won the right to host the 2005 World Athletics Championships but was forced to withdraw when the promised stadium could not be built.\n\nCassani's selection surprised many commentators, as she was unknown in the highly political world of Olympic sport. Although she was married to a Briton and had lived in the country for more than a decade, her American nationality also raised some eyebrows. She led the bid through the first phase of the two-stage bidding process. During her tenure, the newly formed bid corporation grew to a staff of 80, with many large institutional backers, and gained increasing buy-in from a skeptical British public and political class. Her team created the bid's master plan, which detailed where events would be held, what infrastructure would be built, and provided an overall budget projection for the games. This was submitted to the International Olympic Committee in the spring of 2004, and on the strength of it London was selected as one of the five candidate cities.\n\nIn March 2004, the \"Daily Telegraph\" diary column printed claims that Cassani had been highly critical of Tony Blair, saying \"To be frank he wasn't very bright ... the subject he got most animated about was beach volleyball\". Cassani sued for libel saying that the story was not only completely without foundation but also highly damaging to the bid; on April 21, the \"Telegraph\" admitted that she had made none of the remarks attributed to her, and agreed to apologise in print, pay her costs, and make a donation to the Olympic bid committee.\n\nIn May 2004, Cassani announced she was stepping down as chairman in favour of Olympic gold medallist and politician Lord Coe, saying that she felt the bid had reached a stage where his track record in the Olympic movement would be more useful to the bid than her technical and managerial experience. Some commentators felt, however, that her departure had been precipitated by internal politics in the British sports establishment. Pierre-Yves Gerbeau, whom she had appointed as the bid's ambassador, quit the effort shortly after she stepped down, saying the way Cassani had been treated was \"shocking.\"\n\nCassani stayed on with the bid, serving under Coe as Vice Chairman responsible for technical aspects of the bid. She continued to serve on the board (working unpaid one day per week); the IOC awarded the XXXth Olympiad to London on July 6, 2005.\n\nOn September 24, 2007, Cassani became the new chairman of the board at Vueling Airlines, replacing Jose Miguel Abab Silvestre, who resigned abruptly citing \"managerial differences.\" Vueling is a three-year-old airline based in Barcelona, Spain, whose share value in the stock market had dropped by 30% earlier in 2007. Board members Jose Creuheras Margenat and Ferran Conti Penina also resigned.\n\nBarbara Cassani was appointed Executive Chairperson of Jurys Inn hotels in 2008.\n\n"}

Dr. E. Glenn Wagner, Chancellor of Oxford Graduate School, has referred to it as a \"flagship congregation of the Baptist General Conference\", and C. Douglas Weaver, Director of Undergraduate Studies and Associate Professor of Religion at Baylor University, has called \"the best-known congregation in the Baptist General Conference at the turn of the 21st century\".\n\nIt is also affiliated with the Minnesota Baptist Conference. The church has three campuses: the main campus in downtown Minneapolis and satellite campuses in Mounds View and Lakeville. From 1980 until January 2013, its senior pastor was John Piper. Jason Meyer succeeded him on January 1, 2013.\n\nIn the early 1870s, J. L. Johnson became the first Swede baptized by immersion in Minneapolis—in 30-below weather. He and a growing number of Swedes joined First Baptist Church (Minneapolis), and eventually formed a Swedish Bible class.\n\nOn June 22, 1871, they branched off, with First Baptist's blessing, and founded Bethlehem—originally as the First Swedish Baptist Church of Minneapolis. This was 7 years after the American Civil War ended, and 13 years after Minnesota became a State, in a hall at 2nd Street and Nicollet Avenue in Minneapolis, with 22 charter members. Pastor John Ring laid the foundation for the church, which was the first Swedish Baptist church in the Twin Cities area. In March 1872, the church bought a lot at 6th Street and 12th Avenue for $1,000 ($ today); they broke ground in March of the following year on a new $4,000 wood frame church building.\n\nThe church had four pastors in its first ten years. The fifth pastor, Dr. Frank Peterson, arrived in June 1881 to a church of 127 members. On March 16, 1885, during Peterson's pastorate, the church burned and was irreparable. In February 1888, 55 members of the church organized the Elim Swedish Baptist Church. The congregation learned that the Second Congregational Church at 8th Street and 13th Avenue South—only 3 blocks from the burned site—was available for $13,500 ($ today). The church bought the building and property in May 1885. Peterson was of the view that Scandinavian immigrants made the best Baptists, because, as he put it in 1886, they were Protestants, religious, weren't communists or socialists, and very few of them were \"peddlars, organ grinders, or beggars.\" There were 445 members by January 1, 1891, when Peterson departed.\n\nUnder Peterson's ministry, 12 young people became missionaries. One was Ola Hanson who became a missionary to the Kachin people of Burma for 40 years. Hanson put the Kachin language into writing, produced an 11,000-word Kachin-English dictionary, trained 40 local pastors, and translated the Bible into Kachin. The British government awarded him the Kaisar-i-Hind Medal. His story is told in a biography titled ‘Light in the Jungle’, by Gustaf Sword.\n\nThe church's first services in English started in 1893, on a bi-weekly basis. The 6th pastor, Olof Bodien, came in 1893 and pastored until 1912. During that time the church suffered a fire (December 3, 1893) and a tornado (August 1904). \"History; First Baptist Church 1871–1921\"; p. 34. By this time a number of notable Swedish Baptists were members of the church. The church had two pastors from 1912–18, when the 8th pastor, Eric Carlson, arrived. Membership rose to 834, and language tension grew during that time between old (Swedish) and young (English). The 9th pastor, Anton Sjolund, came in 1928, and membership reached 1,204. Services in Swedish continued until the mid-1930, but on January 1, 1936, the church voted to move all services to English, except for one Swedish Sunday School class. Nine years later, on April 13, 1945, First Swedish Baptist voted to change its name to Bethlehem Baptist Church (the same year that the Swedish Baptist General Conference in America dropped \"Swedish\" from its name).\n\nThe 10th pastor, Eric Lindholm, came in 1949. He oversaw the building of the $500,000 ($ today) Sunday School Building, dedicated at year's end 1957 and still in use. The 11th pastor, John Wilcox, came in 1959 as the church's first non-Swedish pastor (he was originally a Southern Baptist), and pastored Bethlehem for 7 years. The 12th pastor was Robert Featherstone, and the 13th, Bruce Fleming, pastored through the 1970s. By 1980, Bethlehem was a somewhat typical downtown Minneapolis church. Most congregants lived in suburbs and commuted, including the pastor. The average age of the now 300-person congregation was 75 years old when the pulpit became open.\n\nThe church decided to take a chance and bring in John Piper, who had never pastored. He had been teaching Bible at the denominational college, Bethel College. In 1983, Pastor Steller had a missionary epiphany, recognizing how the church's theology connected to world missions reaching unreached people, and a missions movement was born. The average age soon dropped from the 70s and 60s to the 20s.\n\nIn 1991, the church had to do something no other downtown Minneapolis church had done in 60 years: find more room. Bethlehem enlarged her worship space; the building purchased in 1885 was demolished for a larger, 1,400 seat sanctuary. One of the stained glass windows from the original building is on display in the foyer. Another building addition came in 2003. In 2002, the church expanded its downtown ministry into the northern Minneapolis by creating a second campus. Instead of building a larger worship center downtown, nearly half the congregation began worshiping in Maranatha Hall at Northwestern College in Roseville. In June 2005, the church moved into its current North Campus facility in Mounds View. In September 2006, Bethlehem launched its third campus at Burnsville High School. In September 2018, the church moved into its current South Campus facility in Lakeville. Congregants of the three Bethlehem Baptist Churches all hear the same sermon, which is delivered in person in one location and on video screens at the other two.\n\nOn May 20, 2012 Jason Meyer was voted in (784 Yes to 8 No) to be the next Pastor for Preaching & Vision, replacing John Piper.\n\nBethlehem has planted, or partnered to plant, several churches in the Twin Cities in its history, including:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2182156", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2182156", "title": "Chef (South Park)", "text": "Chef (South Park)\n\nChef Jerome McElroy is a fictional character on the Comedy Central series \"South Park\" who was voiced by Isaac Hayes. A cafeteria worker at the local elementary school in the town of South Park, Colorado, Chef is generally portrayed as more level-headed than the other adult residents of the town, and sympathetic to the children. His guidance is often sought by the show's core group of child protagonists —Stan Marsh, Kyle Broflovski, Eric Cartman, and Kenny McCormick — as he is usually the only adult whom they consistently trust. To an inadvertent fault, he frequently gives inappropriate advice, usually in the non sequitur form of a lascivious soul song.\n\nChef was inspired by Hayes and other popular soul singers of the 1970s, as well as an actual dining hall worker encountered by series co-creator Trey Parker while he attended the University of Colorado. Chef played a less prominent role as the series progressed beyond its earlier seasons, and the character was retired at the beginning of the tenth season in \"The Return of Chef\" following the controversial departure of Hayes.\n\nIn tradition with the show's animation style, Chef is composed of simple geometrical shapes, and is animated with use of a computer, though he is given the impression of being a construction paper cutout composition animated through the use of stop motion, which was the technique used to animate the \"Spirit of Christmas\" shorts and the show's first episode. Chef is an overweight African American with a beard who usually wore blue pants and a red shirt. He frequently dons a traditional chef's hat and white apron on which the word \"CHEF\" is printed in black, even when he is not at work.\n\nUntil Token Black and his family were given a more notable role starting in the show's fourth season, Chef was portrayed as the only black resident in all of South Park. Parker and co-creator Matt Stone initially planned to have one of themselves voice the character, fearing that their ideal candidates of Hayes (Lou Rawls and Barry White) would never agree to voice the character because the duo had admittedly and purposefully created him as a \"stereotype\" to reflect what they felt was the perception most inhabitants of less-diverse mountainous Colorado towns had of black people. However, Hayes agreed to voice the character due in part to the audacity of some of the show's early scripts. Chef (usually kindheartedly, though not always) referred to most people in town with the pejorative \"crackers\", including the children.\n\nChef, after abandoning his musical aspirations, moved to South Park with plans to open his own restaurant. Before this, he had befriended several famous recording artists in the music industry, including Elton John and Meat Loaf, helping them to launch their successful careers. Despite failing at yet another dream, Chef made his way onto the South Park City Council, representing Public Safety. In addition to dispensing advice to the children and a few of the adult townsfolk, Chef speaks out against what he feels are outrageous ideas. For example, he opposes the rampant prescription of Ritalin in the episode \"Timmy 2000\", and he objects to the town's acceptance of Mr. Garrison committing purposefully flamboyant sadomasochistic acts in front of schoolchildren in \"The Death Camp of Tolerance\". In \"Chef Goes Nanners\", he briefly converts to Islam and adopted the name \"Abdul Mohammed Jabar Rauf Kareem Ali\" when he demanded that South Park change its official flag because it depicted the town's racist past. On several other occasions, Chef helped save South Park (and in a few other instances, the entire world) from potential disasters.\n\nChef is also known for frequently engaging in casual sex, a habit he often expresses through song. He drives a 1980s woodie station wagon with a vanity plate that reads \"LUV CHEF\". He is often seen accompanied by numerous young women when at home or on vacation, and is even revealed to have had a one-night stand with Kathie Lee Gifford. He once resorted to male prostitution in an effort to raise money to pay legal fees, and had sex with nearly every woman in South Park before having to stop due to exhaustion. In \"The Succubus\", Chef briefly becomes an office worker and took up monogamy after meeting a woman named Veronica. The two were engaged to be married until it was revealed that Veronica was actually a succubus. In the \"South Park\" video game, the children can seek Chef's advice at one of the many buildings labelled \"Chef's Shack O' Love\", which is implied to be a brothel, complete with a naked woman in Chef's bed.\n\nChef's parents, Nellie and Thomas McElroy, live in Scotland. The couple have made two major appearances in the episodes \"The Succubus\" and \"The Biggest Douche in the Universe\", and made a brief cameo in a town Christmas celebration in \"Red Sleigh Down\". They were not seen at Chef's funeral in \"The Return of Chef\".\n\nChef is known to have run a quiz show called \"Chef's Luv Shack\", as is apparent in the video game of the same name.\n\nChef endearingly calls the boys \"the children\" or just \"children\" (even when addressing one individually), and, unless he is preoccupied with a female companion, is usually willing to assist them with whatever help they need. He is consistently the only adult in town who the boys held in high regard, and they view him as their friend. They are also visibly saddened if his presence in their lives is threatened. In addition to being fans of his food (especially his trademark Salisbury steak), the boys often heartily anticipate encountering Chef when waiting in the school lunch line, so that they can explain whatever dilemma is affecting them, usually after their traditional greeting:\nChef: Hello there, children!<br>\nThe boys [in unison]: Hey Chef!<br>\nChef: How's it goin'?<br>\nThe boys [one or in unison]: Bad.<br>\nChef: Why \"bad\"?<br>\nThe boys sometimes take it upon themselves to travel to Chef's house individually to seek his advice on all manners of their problems, specifically relationships. He usually gives advice in the form of a soul song, which usually winds up being about sex, whether or not sex was relevant to the topic at hand. Hearing the songs would often leave the boys even more confused and with no further understanding of what they initially inquire about. In earlier seasons, Chef is often approached by the children when they are unfamiliar with a term that pertains to adult matters, such as \"lesbian\" or \"prostitute\". This happens so often that it eventually aggravates Chef, who pleads with them to stop asking questions he feels are not appropriate for him to answer. Despite this, the children continue asking these questions, much to his chagrin. An absent-minded Chef sometimes answers anyway, not realizing his lapse until the damage had been done. Chef acknowledges that doing this had repeatedly gotten him in trouble with his boss, Principal Victoria.\n\nIn addition to singing in an effort to explain something to the children, Chef also sings about things relevant to what has transpired in the plot. These songs were original compositions written by Parker, and performed by Hayes in the same sexually suggestive R&B style he had utilized during his own music career. Within the show, Chef is the original composer of these songs, including \"Stinky Britches\", which was depicted as having been covered by Alanis Morissette without proper credit to Chef. When Chef is left with legal debt after losing a court case to have himself credited as the song's original writer, several bands and artists (guest starring as themselves) hold a concert dubbed \"Chef Aid\", a parody of Live Aid, to raise the funds. The episode inspired a real-life album, \"\", which featured guest stars from the episode such as Elton John and Ozzy Osbourne. The album includes many of the full-length versions of the songs Chef had performed in the show's first two seasons; \"Chocolate Salty Balls\" was released as a single, and reached #1 in both the record charts of Ireland and the United Kingdom. As the series progressed and Chef's role became more intermittent, his spontaneous outbursts into song became less of a show standard.\n\nParker and Stone originally planned to have Chef sing a song in every single episode but abandoned the idea after finding it too challenging and fearing writing too many songs would make them less funny, similar to their rationale for dispensing with Kenny's episodic deaths.\n\nOn January 4, 2006, Hayes defended \"South Park's\" style of controversial humor to \"The A.V. Club\" and XM's \"Opie and Anthony\" show, going so far as to note that although he was not pleased with the show's depiction of the Church of Scientology, of which he was a member, he \"understood what Matt and Trey are doing.\" However, on March 13, 2006, nearly two months after suffering a stroke, Hayes was reported to have quit \"South Park\" over objections to the show's attitudes toward and depiction of various religions, claiming that the show had crossed the line from satire into intolerance.\n\nDespite the content of the official press release, there remains considerable speculation about the motivations behind his departure. Parker and Stone assert that he quit due to the controversial episode \"Trapped in the Closet\", and its treatment of Scientology. Stone commented in a manner that suggested that Hayes practiced a double standard regarding the treatment of religion on \"South Park\": \"[We] never heard a peep out of Isaac in any way until we [lampooned] Scientology. He wants a different standard for religions other than his own, and to me, that is where intolerance and bigotry begin.\" Fox News reporter Roger Friedman suggested that, because he was still suffering from the effects of his stroke, Hayes was hospitalized and not in a position to make a rational decision to leave the show. Friedman also reported that Hayes left the show because of the external pressure forced by his fellow Scientologists, the decision was not voluntary, and the original press release announcing his departure was put out by someone who was not authorized to represent him. In a 2016 oral history of \"South Park\" in \"The Hollywood Reporter\", Hayes' son Isaac Hayes III confirmed that the decision to leave the show was made by Hayes' entourage while Hayes was unable to make such decisions on his own.\n\nNine days after Hayes's departure from production, the controversy was satirized in the show's Season 10 premiere \"The Return of Chef\". For the episode, voice clips of Chef were taken from previous episodes and linked together to form new dialogue to support the plot, which involves Chef's leaving South Park to join the \"Super Adventure Club\", which eventually brainwashes Chef until he had the mindset of a child molester. The organization combines outdoor activities with child molestation, an act they perceive as justified because of their beliefs.\n\nAfter the boys are unable to convince Chef to come back to South Park, a rope bridge Chef is walking across is struck by lightning. He falls to a violent death, culminating with his mutilation at the hands of a grizzly bear and a mountain lion and finally discharged fecal matter (a reference to the episode \"Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes\", in which Cartman claims that the relaxation of the bowel muscles confirms that a person is really dead).\n\nSouth Park holds a memorial service for him (Canadian comedians Terrance and Phillip even attend, despite having never met the man themselves), in which Kyle gives a eulogy stating, \"We shouldn't be mad at Chef for leaving us, we should be mad at that fruity little club for scrambling his brains\", a deliberate parallel with Hayes' departure from the show in favor of Scientology.\n\nMimicking a scene from the finale of \"\", Chef's body is secretly collected by the Super Adventure Club, who managed to revive him as a cyborg — identified on the show's official website as \"Darth Chef\" (a parody of\" Star Wars' \"Darth Vader). He is fitted with a suit and mask like those of Vader, except with the helmet taking on the appearance of Chef's trademark hat, and wields a red, glowing spatula, parodying Vader's red lightsaber. Darth Chef's voice was provided by British comedian and filmmaker Peter Serafinowicz, who voiced Darth Maul in \"\". Darth Chef has not made an appearance in subsequent episodes, but has appeared with other characters in the background of the \"South Park\" opening sequence, and is mentioned in the episode \"Stunning and Brave\", when PC Principal says the kids drove him to kill himself, which is not true.\n\nChef is alluded to after his death in the season 10 episode \"Hell on Earth 2006\" where, during Satan's party, there are multiple scenes in which a Caucasian male dressed as Chef can be seen in the background. He is also referenced in the season 14 episode \"Crème Fraiche\" when Randy becomes the new chef at school and greets the kids with Chef's trademark lines. Chef's death is also indirectly mentioned in the season 19 episode \"Stunning and Brave\" when PC Principal talks about all the things he finds offensive (incorrectly assuming that Chef's death was a suicide, before giving Butters detention for correcting him). Isaac Hayes himself died on August 10, 2008, two years after his departure from \"South Park\".\n\nChef makes an appearance in the 2014 video game \"\" as the reanimated Nazi Zombie penultimate boss later in the game. Once again, voice clips of Isaac Hayes as Chef are recycled from past episodes with the exception of recorded speech clips from Adolf Hitler. During his battle with the player and the other boys, Chef will express remorse by saying things like \"I'm sorry, boys\" and \"what have I done?\" While there were vague references to the Super Adventure Club and his death, there were no references to the Darth Chef suit. After being defeated, Chef regains control over his mind and tries to tell the boys, but he is then killed by Clyde and the New Kid.\n\n"}

Dennis\n\nRoy Lee \"Rocky\" Dennis (December 4, 1961 – October 4, 1978) was an American boy who had craniodiaphyseal dysplasia, an extremely rare sclerotic bone disorder. The condition usually results in neurological disorders and death during childhood or teenage years. His life was the basis for the 1985 drama film \"Mask\".\n\nRocky Dennis was born in Glendora, California, to Florence \"Rusty\" Tullis and Roy Dennis, his legal but not biological father. At the age of two he was diagnosed with craniodiaphyseal dysplasia, also known as CDD or lionitis, an extremely rare disease occurring in approximately one in every 220 million births, with fewer than 20 recorded cases. CDD is a bone disorder that causes calcium to build up in the skull.\nBased on the small number of recorded cases, doctors predicted that the pressure from the calcium deposits would distort his face, destroy his eyesight and hearing, and eventually affect his brain, with death before his seventh birthday.\n\nDespite his eyesight limitations, hearing problems, and the painful headaches he endured, Dennis was eventually able to do a number of things his doctors predicted he would be unable to do. Dennis learned to read even though his poor eyesight kept him from reading books. He entered school at age six, although school authorities recommended against it; and after a slow start (he spent two years in the first grade) he was able to make academic progress before his death at 16. Dennis' body was donated to UCLA Medical Center. Dennis declined to have plastic surgery to correct his facial malformation.\n\nDennis resided in Azusa, California, as well as Covina. There, along with his half-brother, Joshua, he lived with his parents and attended Ben Lomond Elementary School. Following his mother leaving the family, Dennis was raised for a time by his legal father and grandmother as well as his stepmother.\n\nDennis's older half-brother, Joshua \"John\" Mason, died in 1987 at age 32 from complications of AIDS. His mother, Rusty Tullis, died on November 11, 2006, at age 70 as a result of an infection following a motorcycle accident.\n\nPeter Bogdanovich directed the 1985 film \"Mask\", adapted from Anna Hamilton Phelan's screenplay based on Dennis' life with Eric Stoltz portraying Dennis. In one scene in the film, Stoltz' Dennis reads a poem to his mother, Rusty (played by Cher), that was written by Dennis. The movie is based loosely on Dennis' life, with most of the scenes and dialogue altered for dramatic purposes.\n\nPhelan adapted her screenplay into a stage musical of the same name, with music by Barry Mann and Cynthia Weil. The musical premiered at the Pasadena Playhouse in California on March 12, 2008.\n\nSwedish pop musician Jens Lekman self-published a song titled \"Rocky Dennis' Farewell Song to the Blind Girl\", causing DJs to mistakenly call the musician by Rocky Dennis' name. Lekman clarified that the song was not about himself with the release of \"Rocky Dennis in Heaven\", an EP containing four songs about Dennis and his film portrayal.\n"}

{"id": "2182182", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2182182", "title": "Book of Common Order", "text": "Book of Common Order\n\nThe Book of Common Order is the name of several directories for public worship, the first originated by John Knox for use on the continent of Europe and in use by the Church of Scotland since the 16th century. The Church published revised editions in 1940, 1979, and 1994, the latest of these called simply \"Common Order\". Gaelic versions have long been available, and in 1996 the Church of Scotland produced \"Leabhar Sheirbheisean\", a Gaelic supplement to the \"Book of Common Order\".\n\nThe Genevan Book of Order, sometimes called The Order of Geneva or Knox's Liturgy, is a directory for public worship in the Reformed Church of Scotland. In 1557 the Scottish Protestant lords in council enjoined the use of the \"English Common Prayer\", i.e. the \"Second Book of Edward VI\" of 1552. Meanwhile, at Frankfurt, among the English Protestant exiles, there was a controversy between the upholders of the English liturgy and the French Reformed Order of Worship. By way of compromise, John Knox and other ministers drew up a new liturgy based upon earlier Continental Reformed Services, which was not deemed satisfactory, but which on his removal to Geneva he published in 1556 for the use of the English congregations in that city.\n\nThe Geneva book made its way to Scotland and was used by some Reformed congregations there. Knox's return in 1559 strengthened its position, and in 1562 the General Assembly enjoined the uniform use of it as the \"Book of Our Common Order in the administration of the Sacraments and Solemnization of Marriages and Burials of the Dead\". In 1564 a new and enlarged edition was printed in Edinburgh, and the Assembly ordered that every Minister, exhorter and reader should have a copy and use the \"Order\" contained therein not only for marriage and the sacraments but also in prayer, thus ousting the hitherto permissible use of the \"Second Book of Edward VI\" at ordinary service.\n\nThe rubrics as retained from the Book of Geneva made provision for an extempore prayer before the sermons and allowed the minister some latitude in the other two prayers. The forms for the special services were more strictly imposed, but liberty was also given to vary some of the prayers in them. The rubrics of the Scottish portion of the book are somewhat stricter, and, indeed, one or two of the Geneva rubrics were made more absolute in the Scottish emendations; but no doubt the \"Book of Common Order\" is best described as a discretionary liturgy.\n\nIt will be convenient here to give the contents of the edition printed by Andrew Hart at Edinburgh in 1611 and described (as was usually the case) as \"The Psalmes of David in Meeter, with the Prose, whereunto is added Prayers commonly used in the Kirke, and private houses; with a perpetuall Kalendar and all the Changes of the Moone that shall happen for the space of Six Veeres to come\". They are as follows:\n\nThe \"Psalms\" and \"Catechism\" together occupy more than half the book. The chapter on burial is significant. In place of the long office of the Catholic Church we have simply this statement:\n\n\"The corpse is reverently brought to the grave, accompanied with the Congregation, without any further ceremonies: which being buried, the Minister [if he be present and required] goeth to the Church, if it be not far off, and maketh some comfortable exhortation to the people, touching death and resurrection.\" This (with the exception of the bracketed words) was taken over from the \"Book of Geneva\". The \"Westminster Directory\" which superseded the \"Book of Common Order\" also enjoins interment without any ceremony, such being stigmatized as no way beneficial to the dead and many ways hurtful to the living. Civil honors may, however, be rendered.\nGeorge Washington Sprott and Thomas Leishman, in the introduction to their edition of the \"Book of Common Order\", and of the \"Westminster Directory\" published in 1868, collected a valuable series of notices as to the actual usage of the former book for the period (1564–1645) during which it was enjoined by ecclesiastical law. Where ministers were not available suitable persons (often old priests, sometimes schoolmasters) were selected as readers. Good contemporary accounts of Scottish worship are those of William Cowper of Galloway (1568–1619), bishop of Galloway, in his \"Seven Days Conference between a Catholic, Christian and a Catholic Roman\" (c. 1615), and Alexander Henderson in \"The Government and Order, of the Church of Scotland\" (1641). There was doubtless a good deal of variety at different times and in different localities. Early in the 17th century under the twofold influence of the Dutch Church, with which the Scottish clergy were in close connection, and of James VI's endeavours to justle out a liturgy which gave the liberty of conceiving prayers, ministers began in prayer to read less and extemporize more.\n\nTurning again to the legislative history, in 1567 the prayers were translated into Gaelic; in 1579 Parliament ordered all gentlemen and yeomen holding property of a certain value to possess copies. The assembly of 1601 declined to alter any of the existing prayers but expressed a willingness to admit new ones. Between 1606 and 1618 various attempts were made under English and Episcopal influence, by assemblies afterwards declared unlawful, to set aside the \"Book of Common Order\". The efforts of James VI, Charles I and Archbishop Laud proved fruitless; in 1637 the reading of Laud's draft of a new form of service based on the English prayer book led to riots in Edinburgh and to general discontent in the country.\n\nThe General Assembly of Glasgow in 1638 abjured Laud's book and took its stand again by the \"Book of Common Order\", an act repeated by the assembly of 1639, which also demurred against innovations proposed by the English separatists, who objected altogether to liturgical forms, and in particular to the \"Lord's Prayer\", the \"Gloria Patri\" and the minister kneeling for private devotion in the pulpit. An Aberdeen printer named Raban was publicly censured for having on his own authority shortened one of the prayers. The following years witnessed a counter attempt to introduce the Scottish liturgy into England, especially for those who in the southern kingdom were inclined to Presbyterianism. This effort culminated in the Westminster Assembly of divines which met in 1643, at which six commissioners from the Church of Scotland were present, and joined in the task of drawing up a Common Confession, Catechism and Directory for the three kingdoms.\n\nThe commissioners reported to the General Assembly of 1644 that this Common Directory is so begun . . . \"that we could not think upon any particular Directory for our own Kirk.\" The General Assembly of 1645, after careful study, approved the new order. An act of Assembly on the 3rd of February and an act of parliament on the 6th of February ordered its use in every church, and henceforth, though there was no act setting aside the \"Book of Common Order\", the Westminster Directory was of primary authority. The \"Directory\" was meant simply to make known the general heads, the sense and scope of the \"Prayers\" and other parts of Public Worship, and if need be, to give a help and furniture. The act of parliament recognizing the \"Directory\" was annulled at the Restoration and the book has never since been acknowledged by a civil authority in Scotland. But General Assemblies have frequently recommended its use, and worship in Presbyterian churches is largely conducted on the lines of the Westminster Assembly's \"Directory\".\n\nThe subsequent \"Book of Common Order\" or \"Euchologion\" was a compilation drawn from various sources and issued by the Church Service Society, an organisation which endeavoured to promote liturgical usages within the Church of Scotland.\n\nThe Church of Scotland published revised editions of the Book of Common Order in 1940, 1979 and 1994. There are considerable differences between these three editions. The 1994 edition (now known simply as \"Common Order\") attempts to use inclusive language and has deliberately moved away from the use of archaic language; there is even a prayer for space research. In 1996 the Church of Scotland published \"Leabhar Sheirbheisean\", a Gaelic supplement to the Book of Common Order.\n\n\n"}

He participated in the Russian Geographical Society's (IRGO) Map Commission established in 1910. In that year he participated in an expedition to the Ob River basin in Western Siberia, where he studied the Khanty people.\n\nIn 1917 he was a founder participant in the Commission for the Study of the Tribal Composition of the Population of the Borderlands of Russia (KIPS), along with several colleagues of the IRGO Map Commission.\n\nRudenko delivered lectures in the Leningrad University from 1921 to 1954. In 1947-1950 and 1954 he was sent by the Soviet Archaeology Institute to explore the kurgans in the Altay Mountains. During the excavation of Pazyryk tombs, he discovered the world's most spectacular tattooed mummy. In deference to the work of Rudenko and his anthropological usage, what was found is now said to belong to the Pazyryk Culture which flourished between the 7th and 3rd centuries BC.\n\nHerodotus and other ancient writers referred to the Altay as \"the golden mountain\". It was there that the impregnable citadel of the Scythians (or Sacae) lay hidden for centuries. Rudenko, however, was cautious enough not to assign his findings to the Scythians. He attributed the kurgan finds to the formidable Iron Age horsemen and warriors, whom he dubbed the \"Pazyryks\". Although they left no written records, Pazyryk artifacts are distinguished by a sophisticated level of artistry and craftsmanship.\n\nThe Pazyryk tombs discovered by Rudenko were in an almost perfect state of preservation. They contained skeletons and intact bodies of horses and embalmed humans, together with a wealth of artifacts including saddles, riding gear, a chariot, rugs, clothing, jewelry, musical instruments, amulets, tools, and an \"apparatus for inhaling hemp smoke\". Also found in the tombs were fabrics from Persia and China, which the Pazyryks must have obtained on journeys covering thousands of miles.\n\n"}
{"id": "2182212", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2182212", "title": "HM Prison Lindholme", "text": "HM Prison Lindholme\n\nHM Prison Lindholme is a Category C/D men's prison located near Hatfield Woodhouse in the Metropolitan Borough of Doncaster, South Yorkshire, England. Lindholme is operated by Her Majesty's Prison Service, and is situated in close proximity to Hatfield and Moorland prisons\n\nThe site was originally constructed as RAF Lindholme during the Second World War to house and operate bombers. During the RAF station's lifetime it was home to the RAF Bomber Command Bombing School (BCBS) and also the RAF Navigation School. BCBS moved out in 1972, and RAF Lindholme became a radar installation with its hangars converted for storage, eventually being downgraded to a relief glider landing field and closing altogether shortly thereafter. The site, which occupies , re-opened as a prison in 1985. Many of the original buildings and hangars from the RAF station are still in use as prison accommodation, offices and workshops, although these have been augmented by new buildings. In 2000, the old RAF Officers' Mess building, which had been used as a Category D prison wing, was converted into an Immigration Removal Centre.\n\nThe annual budget for running Lindholme was £18.3 million in 2011-12, and the cost per prisoner for 2010 was £32,757. This budget does not include the costs of providing educational facilities or healthcare, which are separately funded.\n\nOn 14 July 2011, it was announced that the operation of HMP Lindholme would be put out to tender, accepting bids from private companies and HM Prison Service for the management of the establishment. Serco were about to be awarded the contract, but the decision was postponed in July 2013, to allow allegations that they had been overcharging and mismanaging other contracts within the public sector to be investigated. In November 2013 it was announced that HMP Lindholme along with the two other contested sites in South Yorkshire, HMP Hatfield and HMP Moorland, would remain in the public sector, ending two years of uncertainty.\n\nIn April 2012, the Immigration Removal Centre was closed and converted back to a Category D prison wing. In June 2013 an inspection report from Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Prisons was strongly critical of the Category D wing, and it was subsequently closed. The report also stated that there were religious tensions at the prison, illegal drugs and alcohol were widely available, and that the needs of disabled inmates were neglected. However the report concluded that much of the training for prisoners was of good quality, and that vocational courses in construction and baking were \"outstanding\".\n\nLindholme holds Category C male prisoners only. This category is for people who are unlikely to make a serious attempt to escape from prison, but who could not be trusted in an open prison. The prison holds Category C convicted males over the age of 21, who are serving a minimum sentence of four years, and used to hold a small number of Category D males, who were awaiting allocation to an open prison. However, the D wing was closed in 2013 because of poor care and medical issues. \n\nThe prison has an Operational Capacity of 1,010 inmates, and this number is also the Certified National Accommodation rating for the prison, which is the uncrowded capacity that provides a decent standard of accommodation for all prisoners. The prison is run by the public sector prison service, but educational services are provided by the City of Manchester College for Learning and Skills, and healthcare is provided by Nottingham NHS Trust.\n\nThe Category C site consists of eleven wings, six of which were dormitories when the site was owned by the RAF, but which also provide some single rooms and some multi-occupancy rooms. Three wings are relatively new additions to the prison and are single cell occupancy. A further new wing opened in November 2007 with double cells, which is used to hold prisoners who are at risk from bullying and intimidation. The Induction Unit has double cells, and a purpose built Care and Separation Unit was built in 2008. Every year from 2009 to 2012, the state of the kitchens had been criticised in the Independent Monitoring Board annual report. Construction of a new kitchen costing £7 million was completed in April 2013, but the power supply to it was inadequate, and it was closed until 23 November, while this was rectified, at extra cost. This oversight led the Independent Monitoring Board to question how such contracts are awarded, and whether the prison service gets value for money. The 2014 report also commended the dedication of the catering staff, for their production of good quality food and their accommodation of dietary needs during religious festivals.\n\nThe prison education department offers inmates opportunities to study for qualifications such as NVQs, GCSEs and A Levels in subjects including English, mathematics, English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL), information technology, business administration, graphic design, reprographics and printing, visual art, catering, baking, hospitality, hairdressing and barbering, industrial cleaning, construction industry training in trowel trades, plastering, painting and decorating, carpentry, plumbing, civil engineering, fork lift training, light engineering, railway engineering, horticulture, waste management, textiles, and a range of PE courses.\n\n\n"}

It was originally more of a delicacy with myriad variations on spiciness and texture.\n\nNihari is a traditional dish of Muslims of Delhi, Bhopal and Lucknow. After the creation of Pakistan in 1947, many Urdu speaking Muslims from northern India migrated to Karachi and Dhaka, and established restaurants. In Karachi, Nihari became a roaring success and soon all over Pakistan. Now Nihari is available in Pakistani restaurants around the world.\n\nIn some restaurants, a few kilos from each day's leftover Nihari is added to the next day's pot.

Ferrellgas has corporate operations in the Kansas City suburbs of Liberty, Missouri and Overland Park, Kansas.\n\nThe company was founded in 1939 by Alfred Carl (A.C.) Ferrell in Atchison, Kansas. Established as A.C. Ferrell Butane Gas Company, the business prospered during World War II and the immediate post-war years. The company sold gas heaters and floor furnaces from its storefront on Commercial Street in downtown Atchison. In 1947, A.C. Ferrell erected a bulk plant on a rail siding in East Atchison to help supply bottled gas to local customers. A.C.'s wife, Mabel, was active in the family business, serving as office manager and bookkeeper. The business began a slow, steady decline when Mabel died in 1952. The business continued on, with A.C. electing to diversify by selling furniture and televisions. A massive flood in Atchison in 1958 destroyed much of the company's merchandise, prompting A.C. to move the business from Commercial Street to rented space across the river in Missouri.\n\nA.C. and Mabel's oldest son and middle child, current company Chairman James Ferrell, enrolled in the University of Kansas in 1958. That same year he married a 19-year-old freshman from nearby Benedictine College named Elizabeth (Zibbie). James Ferrell graduated from college in 1963 with a business degree. As an undergraduate, he participated in R.O.T.C.. After graduation, he went to Fort Benning, Georgia, to attend infantry school. After being stationed for a year in Korea, James and Zibbie Ferrell moved to Fort Lewis, Washington. It was there in 1965 that James received a letter from A.C. Ferrell asking him to return home to Kansas to help the struggling family business. The company had reverted to selling strictly propane and had dwindled to only four employees.\n\nJames Ferrell renamed the company Ferrellgas. The company expanded across the Missouri River to acquire a Rushville, Missouri dealer in 1968. In the next 10 years, the company acquired other Midwestern dealers and established a wholesale operation, and profited amid the energy crises of 1973 and 1979. During that time, the Ferrellgas headquarters shifted, moving first to Platte City, Missouri before moving further east to Kearney. Its expansion continued, opening Ferrell North America, a propane and feedstock distribution arm, in 1977. To accommodate a growing staff, new offices were constructed in Liberty, Missouri, in 1981 and 1983. Those offices, which remain in use by corporate support employees today, would serve as Ferrellgas' headquarters until 2004, with the company moved its executive offices to their current location in nearby Overland Park, Kansas.\n\nFerrellgas wasn't the only propane company in the nation's heartland that was expanding rapidly in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Another such propane retailer was Buckeye Gas Products Company. Buckeye traced its roots to 1886, when Standard Oil Company formed the Buckeye Pipeline Co. to move petroleum products to refineries in northwestern Ohio. By the 1940s, the company was supplying refineries from Chicago to Buffalo, and following World War II, it expanded its pipeline network into New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania. In 1964, the Pennsylvania Railroad acquired Buckeye, since most of its pipelines paralleled the railroad’s right-of-way across the Mid-Atlantic states. The Pennsylvania Railroad merged with the New York Central Railroad in 1968 when the nation’s freight and passenger railroad network was struggling to survive. Three years later, in 1971, the merged Penn Central Railroad filed for the then-largest corporate bankruptcy in American history.\n\nBuckeye, meanwhile, remained one of the bankrupt railroad’s more profitable subsidiaries. In the 1970s, the company made a sizable investment in infrastructure, and in 1977, Buckeye expanded into New England with the acquisition of the pipeline company Jet Lines, Inc. In 1986, Penn Central created a master limited partnership to spin off Buckeye and hired Goldman Sachs & Co. to act as lead underwriter. The planned offering did not go well, and Goldman advised management that the placement would go better if Buckeye was split into its pipeline and propane components and sold separately.\n\nA Wall Street banker who James Ferrell met in the early 1980s, who would later become a member of the Ferrellgas Board of Directors, Andy Levison, contacted James Ferrell in 1984 to let him know that Buckeye’s propane subsidiary was for sale at an estimated $200 million and asked if he wanted to bid on it. The purchase would elevate Ferrellgas from a regional company to the country's third largest retail propane marketer.\n\nWith the acquisition of Buckeye safely under its belt, Ferrellgas spent the late 1980s and early 1990s consolidating its operations and expanding into new geographical territory. The November 30, 1989 acquisition of DuPane Gas Service operations in Rhode Island was especially exciting. DuPane Gas served 2,600 Rhode Island customers with 1.7 million gallons of propane a year. It gave Ferrellgas its first entry into the competitive and potentially lucrative Northeast market. Ferrellgas continued its acquisition efforts in 1990 and 1991. In the latter year, the company closed 14 acquisitions ranging from the 3.9 million gallons sold by United Cities Propane Gas in Georgia to the 86,000 gallons retailed by Fessler Mill & Hardware in Wisconsin. The company continued its penetration into the Northeast with major acquisitions in New Jersey and Rhode Island.\n\nThe need to access capital for acquisitions and internal growth gave James Ferrell the idea to form a Master Limited Partnership (MLP). In June 1994, Ferrellgas issued partnership units of Ferrellgas Partners, L.P. on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the ticker symbol FGP.\n\nIn 1998, investment bank Goldman Sachs brought James Ferrell an idea that would help him transition into retirement. The idea was for Ferrell to sell his interest in Ferrellgas to the company's employees in a leveraged Employee Stock Ownership Plan, or ESOP. The plans helped provide tax incentives for the transfer of ownership to a broad base of employees. On July 18, 1998, thousands of Ferrellgas employees gathered in 35 meetings across the United States to learn they had become owners of the company through the establishment of the ESOP. Ferrell appeared in a videotaped presentation to introduce the concept.\n\nGrowth through acquisitions continued in the new millennium. On December 1, 2002 Ferrellgas purchased the propane operations of ProAm, Inc., then the nation's 17th largest propane retailer, for $25.6 million and a $10 million deferred seller note. The regional company had 70,000 customers and 57 retail outlets in seven states, the largest concentration of these being in Georgia and Texas. Late 2003 and early 2004 were highlighted by the acquisitions of Aeropres Propane of Bossier City, Louisiana, and Suburban Propane Partners's operations in Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, and Missouri. Aeropres operated 13 locations and sold 10 million gallons of propane throughout Louisiana and Arkansas. The acquisition of the Suburban locations added 13 million gallons and allowed Ferrellgas to enter Norman, Oklahoma, and Austin, Texas, for the first time.\n\nOn February 9, 2004, Ferrellgas announced its blockbuster merger with Blue Rhino Corporation, the nation's largest provider of propane by portable tank exchange founded by James Liautaud. Under the terms of the agreement, Ferrellgas purchased shares of Blue Rhino (the company was traded on the Nasdaq under the symbol RINO) in a transaction worth approximately $340 million. On the day of the merger agreement, James Ferrell called tank exchange the fastest growing portion of the retail propane industry. In 2004 the company had a nationwide exchange network of 29,000 selling locations. That number has since grown to more than 45,000 selling locations. Blue Rhino was founded in 1994, around the same time of Ferrellgas Partners, L.P.'s initial public offering, and remains headquartered in Winston-Salem, North Carolina.\n\nKnown mostly for its exchange of 20-pound barbeque grill tanks, Blue Rhino boasts other product lines. Global Sourcing, a company acquired by Blue Rhino in 2000, is the world's largest supplier of barbeque grills. Its products are sold across North America, South America, Europe, and Asia. Global Sourcing products include Uniflame-branded barbeque grills, as well as patio heaters, outdoor fireplaces, mosquito eliminators, charcoal and electric grills, and indoor fireplaces sold under SkeeterVac, Endless Summer, and other private labels.\nIn September 2009, James E. Ferrell stepped down as CEO and appointed Steve Wambold, a ten-year company veteran who had served as the company's president and COO since 2005. Ferrell was appointed Interim President and Chief Executive Officer in September 2016 when Wambold stepped down from his roles as President and Chief Executive Officer and as a member of the Board.\n\nAt the Blue Rhino propane plant (LP gas), owned by Ferrellgas, located in Tavares, Florida in Lake County, a fire broke out at around 10:30 p.m EDT on July 29, 2013. This fire lead to multiple explosions within an hour and into the early morning of the next day. The plant contained about 53,000 20-pound propane cylinders and multiple large storage tanks. A total of eight workers were injured, some critically.\n\nOn May 1, 2014, Ferrellgas established a midstream division with the purchase of Sable Environmental, LLC and a related entity for $124.7 million. Sable is a privately held fluid logistics provider in the Eagle Ford Shale region of south Texas. Ferrellgas expanded its midstream operations on September 2, 2014, with the purchase of two salt water disposal wells in the Eagle Ford Shale region from C&E Production, LLC and its affiliates, based in Bryan, Texas. The acquisition increased Ferrellgas' salt water disposal wells in the region to eight.\n\nIn June 2015, Ferrellgas agreed to acquire Bridger Logistics LLC for a fee of around $837.5 million as part of its plans to expand its midstream services business.\n\nAlthough publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange since 1994, the Ferrell family maintains a presence with the company. James E. Ferrell continues to serve as the company's chairman, and has twice been elected president of the World LP Gas Association. As of October 31, 2017, James E. Ferrell directly or beneficially owned 4,763,475 common units of Ferrellgas Partners, L.P. Ferrellgas employees indirectly own 22,529,361 common units of Ferrellgas Partners, L.P. through an employee stock ownership plan. Approximately 69 million common units are held by public unitholders.\n\nOn December 30, 2019, the company de-listed its FGP symbol from the NYSE and listed its public shares on the OTCQB Pink Sheet exchange with the symbol FGPR. This change was necessitated because the average closing price of the company’s common stock over a consecutive 30-day trading period had remained less than $1.00, which is an NYSE listing requirement.\n\nAccording to the 10-K filed by the company on September 28, 2017, Ferrellgas has 789 retail locations in all 50 states and the District of Columbia in addition to Blue Rhino locations in Puerto Rico.\n\n"}

It operated scheduled commuter services as well as Boeing 727 jet flights under the \"Pan Am Clipper Connection\" banner. Its main base was Pease International Airport. Boston-Maine Airways ceased\nall Pan Am flights on February 29, 2008.\n\nBoston-Maine Airways was established in March 1999 and started operations in May 2000. It was founded as a feeder for Pan American Airways and also flew leased BAe Jetstream 31 aircraft for Caesar's of Atlantic City, New Jersey. It is wholly owned by Pan Am Systems (formerly known as Guilford Transportation Industries), which owns the Pan Am brand.\n\nUnder the name Pan Am Clipper Connection, Boston-Maine Airways operated six round-trips daily between Trenton–Mercer Airport in Ewing, New Jersey, and Hanscom Field in Bedford, Massachusetts. Boston-Maine Airways also operated one round-trip daily between Trenton–Mercer Airport and Pease International Airport in Portsmouth, New Hampshire.\n\nGuilford ceased operating Pan American Airways on November 1, 2004, but operations were transferred to Boston-Maine Airways, which resumed Boeing 727-200 jet service under the Pan Am Clipper Connection brand on February 17, 2005.\n\nIn August 2005, a federal investigation into fraudulent financial data submitted by Boston-Maine Airways halted plans to expand its fleet and route system. At the same time, the airline pilots union claimed that the airline was unfit to operate and urged the Department of Transportation to deny the airline's certification for expansion. The airline later announced that it was suspending service from September 6 to November 16, citing rising fuel costs and decreased levels of booking. In the middle of October 2005, the airline suspended Boeing 727 flights indefinitely from several airports that it served, including its home base in Portsmouth, New Hampshire.\n\nHowever, by March 21, 2006, Pan Am Clipper Connection became the first announced non-charter service to connect to the growing Tunica Municipal Airport in Tunica, Mississippi. The addition not only connected the carrier to a burgeoning casino destination, but also aided efforts to bolster Tunica Municipal as a secondary airport to Memphis International Airport in nearby Memphis, Tennessee. Boston-Maine Airways' Pan Am Clipper Connection flew from Tunica Municipal Airport to Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport three times per week; the service to Tunica had ended by October the same year.\n\nOn August 1, 2006, Boston-Maine Airways announced that it would begin Pan Am Clipper Connection service to Elmira-Corning Regional Airport in Elmira, New York. Company executives believed that Elmira was a perfect fit for the company, with its close proximity to Rochester, Ithaca, Binghamton, and Williamsport. The airline flew twice-daily routes to Bedford, Massachusetts, Trenton, New Jersey, and Baltimore-Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport. Proposed future plans included possible flights to Orlando and Tampa, Florida, using Boeing 727 aircraft. However, by fall of 2007, service to Elmira ceased.\n\nPan Am Clipper Connection began non-stop service to Baltimore-Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport, Bedford, Massachusetts, and Portsmouth, New Hampshire from New Haven, Connecticut, on March 8, 2007, using 19 seat Jetstream 31 aircraft. Service was later discontinued in August 2007.\n\nOn February 1, 2008, the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) issued a Show Cause Order (Order 2008-2-3, DOT Docket Number DOT-OST-2000-7668), concluding that Boston-Maine's air carrier certificate should be revoked for three reasons: 1) lack of financial fitness, 2) lack of proper management oversight, and 3) lack of \"compliance disposition,\" or willingness to follow federal laws, rules and regulations.\n\nThe motion to revoke Boston-Maine's DOT air carrier certificate was brought by the Air Line Pilots Association. DOT specifically cited the numerous instances where the airline's officials had failed to follow federal laws and regulations and had filed false financial data with the Department in its application for authority to fly large aircraft. The DOT concluded that it would have never granted the large aircraft authority had it known of the false information filed by Boston-Maine.\n\nThe DOT also rejected the carrier's arguments that it was not responsible for the Company's former General Counsel and Vice President's filing of such false information (Boston-Maine had asserted that this individual had acted alone, without the Company's knowledge or involvement).\n\nOn February 28, 2008, Boston-Maine Airways ended its Jetstream-based scheduled passenger service. March 29, 2008 was the last 727 flight.\n\nBeginning in July 2008, the company moved 8 of its planes to Concord Municipal Airport in New Hampshire, with the intent to keep them there until buyers took the planes. Parked on the ramp were six Jetstream 31s to be sold, but one Jetstream and a Citation 500 (the ninth ever made) were placed in the corporate hangar operated by Concord Aviation Services. As of August 30, 2008, six planes remain on the ramp, with the aforementioned two in the hangar.\n\nBoston-Maine Airways and the Pan Am Clipper Connection served the following destinations at various times during its existence:\n\n(Ithaca Tompkins International Airport)\n\nThe Boston-Maine Airways fleet consisted of the following aircraft (as of June 2007):\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2182247", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2182247", "title": "Let Him Have It", "text": "Let Him Have It\n\nLet Him Have It is a 1991 British drama film directed by Peter Medak and starring Christopher Eccleston, Paul Reynolds, Tom Courtenay and Tom Bell. The film is based on the true story of Derek Bentley.\n\nThe true story of the case ended with Bentley hanged for murder under controversial circumstances on 28 January 1953. While Bentley did not directly play a role in the murder of PC Sidney Miles, he received a greater punishment than the gunman (who was 16).\n\nDerek Bentley (Eccleston) is an illiterate, epileptic young adult with developmental disabilities who falls into a gang led by a younger teenager named Christopher Craig (Reynolds). During the course of the robbery of a warehouse in Croydon, in which Bentley is encouraged to participate by Craig, the two become trapped by the police. Officers order Craig to put down his gun. Bentley, who by this time has already been arrested, shouts \"Let him have it, Chris\" – whether he means the phrase literally (\"Let him have the gun\") or figuratively (\"Open fire!\") is unclear. Craig fires, killing one officer and wounding another. Because he is a minor, Craig is given a prison sentence for the crime. Meanwhile, Bentley is sentenced to death under the English common law principle of joint enterprise, on the basis that his statement to Craig was an instigation to shoot. Bentley's family makes an effort for clemency which reaches Parliament. However, the Home Secretary (who has the power to commute the death sentence) declines to intervene. Despite his family's efforts and some public support, Bentley is executed in 1953 within a month of being convicted, before Parliament takes any official action.\n\nPaul Bergman and Michael Asimow call attention to the cross examination scene, where \"the camera closes in on [Bentley's] bruised face as the prosecutor and judge bombard him with questions he can barely comprehend.\"\nThe film's end titles state that Bentley's sister, Iris, was still fighting for his pardon. Seven years after the film was made and after numerous unsuccessful campaigns to get Derek Bentley a full pardon, his conviction was eventually overturned by the Court of Appeal on 30 July 1998, one year after Iris's death.\n\nThe film gained positive reviews from critics. It holds an 84% approval rating from the review aggregation site Rotten Tomatoes based on 37 reviews, with an average rating of 7.7/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Led by a gripping performance from Christopher Eccleston, \"Let Him Have It\" sounds a compelling call for justice on behalf of its real-life protagonist.\"\n\nTom Wiener said that the film displayed the writers Neal Purvis and Robert Wade's \"outrage toward a system hell-bent on vengeance\" and John Ivan Simon called the script \"first rate, no nonsense\".\n\n"}
{"id": "2182249", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2182249", "title": "WTTV", "text": "WTTV\n\nWTTV, virtual channel 4 (UHF digital channel 27), is a CBS-affiliated television station serving Indianapolis, Indiana, United States that is licensed to Bloomington. The station is owned by Nexstar Media Group, as part of a duopoly with Indianapolis-licensed Fox affiliate WXIN (channel 59). The two stations share studios on Network Place (near 71st Street and I-465) in the Intech Park office development in northwestern Indianapolis; WTTV's transmitter is located on State Road 252 in Trafalgar.\n\nWTTK (virtual channel 29, UHF digital channel 15) in Kokomo operates as a full-time satellite of WTTV; this station shares transmitter facilities with WXIN on West 73rd Street/Westlane Road on the northern outskirts of Indianapolis (west of Meridian Hills). WTTK was originally used to bring WTTV's programming to areas of central Indiana that had marginal to non-existent reception of the main WTTV signal (including Kokomo, Muncie and Lafayette). However, post-digital transition with the transmitter's relocation into Marion County, it nearly duplicates the signal contours of ABC affiliate WRTV (channel 6), CW affiliate WISH-TV (channel 8) and WXIN; there is significant overlap between the coverage areas of both WTTV and WTTK's signals otherwise. WTTK is a straight simulcast of WTTV; on-air references to WTTK are limited to Federal Communications Commission (FCC)-mandated hourly station identifications during newscasts and other programming, along with tuning recommendations for over-the-air viewers to the north of Indianapolis. Despite Kokomo being WTTK's city of license, there has never been any physical office or employees located in that area.\n\nOn cable, WTTV is available on Comcast Xfinity, Charter Spectrum and AT&T U-verse channel 4.\n\nThe station first signed on the air on November 11, 1949, originally broadcasting on VHF channel 10. It was the second television station to sign on in the state of Indiana, debuting almost 6½ months after WFBM-TV (now WRTV) signed on in May 1949. It has made the claim to being Indiana's oldest \"continuously operating\" television station because WFBM-TV had experienced a transmitter failure which took it off the air for an extended period of time shortly after WTTV signed on. Owned by Sarkes Tarzian, a Bloomington-based radio manufacturer and broadcaster, the station originally operated as a primary NBC affiliate with secondary affiliations with ABC and the DuMont Television Network. It also aired programming from CBS on occasion.\n\nWTTV originally transmitted its signal from its studio just south of downtown Bloomington, shared with sister station WTTS (1370 AM, now WGCL), which went on the air in March 1949. Sarkes Tarzian built a new studio and transmitter on the north end of the Tarzian factory property on Bloomington's south side in 1952. Also that same year the release of the FCC's \"Sixth Report and Order\", which ended a four-year suspension of television station permit and license awards, also saw a reallocation of VHF channel assignments across the United States—including in Bloomington, where WTTV was forced to move from channel 10 to the newly-assigned channel 4. The switch took effect on February 21, 1954 and as a result, WTTV's transmitter was moved to a tower near Cloverdale, and the power was increased to 100,000 watts. The station's former channel 10 allocation was moved to Terre Haute and awarded to WTHI-TV, which signed on in July 1954.\n\nIn its early years, instead of buying most of the expensive items needed to run a television station, Tarzian had his own engineers and technicians design and build the items needed. For example, an overhead microphone boom cost approximately $300. Tarzian employees built one for less than $30. When Tarzian decided to start broadcasting network programs, establishing a coaxial cable link from Cincinnati would prove impractical, so Tarzian built his own microwave relay system from Cincinnati to Bloomington.\n\nThe station lost the ABC affiliation after WISH-TV signed on in July 1954. In 1956, the station lost the NBC affiliation to WFBM-TV; WTTV rejoined ABC after WISH-TV took a primary affiliation with CBS. That same year, it relocated its studio facilities to a site at Bluff Road on the south side of Indianapolis, although the station retained its studios on the Tarzian property in Bloomington as an auxiliary site for many years afterward. In the late 1950s, the station began producing some of its local programs in color; WTTV would convert to full color broadcasts in the fall of 1965, after it purchased color-capable camera equipment.\n\nThe station activated its current tower in Trafalgar, the tallest structure in Indiana at above ground level, in 1957; WTTV was joined on the tower by a new radio station, Bloomington-licensed WTTV-FM (92.3 FM, now WTTS) in 1960. The transmitter facility is located farther south than Indianapolis' other major television stations due to FCC regulations that require a station's transmitter site be located no more than from its city of license—in this case, Bloomington, which is south of Indianapolis. WTTV only provided a grade B (\"rimshot\") signal to the city's northern suburbs and could not be seen at all in the far northern portions of the market. As a result, most of these areas only got a clear signal from channel 4 when cable television arrived in central Indiana in the late 1960s. Because of this rule, when WTTV regained the ABC affiliation, WLBC-TV in Muncie (channel 49, allocation now occupied by PBS member station WIPB) served as the \"de facto\" ABC affiliate for the northern part of the market.\n\nOn October 30, 1957, WTTV became an independent station after losing the ABC affiliation to upstart WLWI (channel 13, now WTHR). In its early years as an independent, WTTV began running a test pattern at 2 p.m. until regular programming began at 4 p.m. The station initially ran older movies and low-budget syndicated programs as well as some of its own locally produced programming. By the 1970s, WTTV began signing on by 6 a.m. and stayed on the air until at least 2 a.m. In addition to local programming, WTTV aired plenty of movies during the early afternoon hours and in prime time. It also aired cartoons, which were mixed in with locally produced children's programs in the afternoons from 3 to 5 p.m. as well as off-network sitcoms in the evenings.\n\nAs cable expanded in the Midwest during the 1970s, WTTV became a regional superstation. At its height, it was available on nearly every cable system in Indiana (except the northwest). It was also carried in large portions of Ohio and Kentucky, including Cincinnati, Columbus, Dayton, Louisville and Lexington. Due to the syndication exclusivity rule, it disappeared from most cable systems outside Indiana (except for the Kentucky side of the Evansville market) in the late 1980s.\n\nSarkes Tarzian sold WTTV to Teleco for $26.5 million in September 1978 (while retaining the radio stations, which are still owned by Tarzian as of 2020); the station was then sold to the Tel-Am Corporation in March 1984. By the mid-1980s, WTTV began airing more cartoons and first-run syndicated talk shows during the daytime hours, as well as an increased number of recent off-network sitcoms during the evening. The station also began broadcasting 24 hours a day of programming by that time. Although it was one of the strongest independent stations in the country, WTTV opted against affiliating with the upstart Fox network in 1986—one of the few long-established independents to do so. This was mainly because most of the markets in its large cable footprint had enough stations to provide Fox affiliates of their own, making the prospect of being a multi-state Fox affiliate unattractive to channel 4. The Fox affiliation in the Indianapolis market instead went to eventual sister station WXIN (channel 59), which became a charter affiliate of the network when it launched on October 6 of that year.\n\nIn 1987, Tel-Am purchased the construction permit for WWKI-TV (channel 29) in Kokomo, north of Indianapolis, from B.G.S. Broadcasting. B.G.S., who also owned WWKI radio (100.5 FM) until 1986, had concluded that there were not nearly enough viewers in north-central Indiana for WWKI-TV to be viable as a standalone station, and its merger with WTTV allowed channel 29 to come on the air. On May 1, 1988, Tel-Am signed channel 29 on as WTTK, a full-time satellite of WTTV, to improve its over-the-air coverage in northern portions of the market that could not receive the WTTV signal. Tel-Am filed for bankruptcy in 1987; Raleigh, North Carolina-based Capitol Broadcasting Company purchased WTTV and WTTK in July 1988, after an attempt to sell the station to locally based Emmis Communications fell through. The stations were then sold to River City Broadcasting in 1991. In September 1993, the station began carrying programming from the Prime Time Entertainment Network syndication service.\n\nWTTV became a charter affiliate of the United Paramount Network (UPN) when the network launched on January 16, 1995. In April 1996, River City Broadcasting merged with the Sinclair Broadcast Group in a $1.2 billion deal. However, due to FCC regulations at that time which prohibited the common ownership of two full-power commercial television stations in the same market, Sinclair had to obtain a cross-ownership waiver to retain ownership of WTTV/WTTK and the company's existing Indianapolis station, inTV affiliate WIIB (channel 63, now Ion Television owned-and-operated station WIPX-TV), which the company eventually sold to DP Media two years later.\n\nIn 1997, Sinclair signed a deal with The WB to affiliate with several UPN-affiliated and independent stations that the company either managed or owned outright. While WTTV was not included in the original deal, Sinclair subsequently notified UPN that it was not interested in renewing the station's affiliation, leading network sister company Paramount Stations Group to strike a deal to buy WB charter affiliate WNDY-TV (channel 23), though Paramount pledged at the time to keep WNDY a WB affiliate through the expiration of its contract in January 1999. WTTV temporarily returned to being an independent station when its contract with UPN expired on January 16, 1998, filling its prime time schedule with movies; on January 22, WNDY began to carry UPN programming in addition to The WB. WTTV then replaced WNDY as the market's WB affiliate on April 6, 1998 and changed its on-air branding to \"WB 4 Indiana\"; channel 23 then became a full-time UPN affiliate.\n\nAs The WB pushed for market exclusivity for its local affiliates as the network increased its national distribution beyond the Tribune Company's television stations and the superstation feed of its Chicago affiliate (and Tribune flagship station) WGN-TV, Sinclair decided to wind down carriage agreements that the station had with cable providers located outside of the Indianapolis market. The station remains available on cable systems on the Indiana side of the Terre Haute market, which until 2017 did not have an over-the-air CW affiliate, though this is expected to end with WTTV's CBS affiliation. CW network programming is now only available in Terre Haute via the third digital subchannel of WTHI-TV.\n\nOn April 19, 2002, Sinclair Broadcast Group sold WTTV and WTTK to Tribune Broadcasting for $125 million, creating the market's first television duopoly under current FCC regulations with Fox affiliate WXIN; the purchase was finalized on July 24 of that year (Tribune held an ownership interest in The WB at the time; however, WTTV could not technically be considered an owned-and-operated station since Time Warner held a 78% majority interest in the network).\n\nAlthough WTTV was the longer-established of the two stations, Tribune chose to keep the Fox affiliation on WXIN due in part to WTTV's then-weaker analog signal in the northern part of the market. Additionally, the NFL on Fox, until the 2014 implementation of Fox/CBS cross-flex scheduling, could only carry two Indianapolis Colts home games with National Football Conference (NFC) opponents each year as the team is part of the National Football League's American Football Conference (AFC), so the need for Fox to have an analog-era VHF affiliate in the market was less important than if it was an NFC market. WTTV merged its operations with those of WXIN in 2004, when the latter moved its operations into new facilities at 6910 Network Place at the Intech Park office development on the city's northwest side.\n\nOn January 24, 2006, Time Warner and CBS Corporation (which split from Viacom in December 2005) and announced that they would dissolve The WB and UPN (which CBS had acquired one month earlier in December 2005 following its split from the original Viacom), and combine the respective programming of both networks to create a new \"fifth\" network, The CW. The network signed a ten-year agreement with Tribune to affiliate with 16 of the 19 WB-affiliated stations that the company had owned at the time, including WTTV/WTTK; WTTV/WTTK became the market's CW affiliate when the network launched on September 18, 2006; its on-air branding was also changed to \"CW 4\". In August 2008, the station rebranded as \"Indiana's 4\" as part of a corporate effort by Tribune to strengthen the local branding of its stations and reduce the dependence on the use of references to The CW in its stations' branding in part due to the network's weak national ratings.\n\nOn August 11, 2014, CBS and Tribune Broadcasting announced that WTTV would become Indianapolis' CBS affiliate beginning on January 1, 2015. The deal, which was part of an agreement that also renewed the CBS affiliations on Tribune-owned stations in four other markets, including WTKR, which is owned by Dreamcatcher Broadcasting and operated by Tribune through a shared services agreement (SSA), was driven by CBS' desire for reverse retransmission consent compensation from its affiliates; WISH-TV had been in negotiations to renew its agreement with the network, but station management reportedly balked at CBS' demands. This led to CBS reaching a deal with WTTV, which Tribune was eager to land since the network holds the broadcast television rights to the AFC, which includes rights to most of the Indianapolis Colts' regular season games. This marked the second time that WTTV has taken a network affiliation away from WISH, the first being when it took the ABC affiliation in 1956.\n\nAfter initially announcing plans to move The CW to its second digital subchannel, Tribune announced on December 22, that it would instead sell the CW affiliation in the market to WISH-TV's owner, Media General (which finalized its merger with that station's longtime owner, LIN Media, three days earlier); as a result, WISH effectively swapped affiliations with WTTV and became a CW affiliate. The first CBS program to air on WTTV was a repeat of Indianapolis native David Letterman's talk show, the \"Late Show\", which aired at 12:15 a.m. on January 1; Letterman concluded his run on the show in May.\n\nWTTV became the third television station in Indianapolis to affiliate with CBS. The network had originally been aligned with WFBM-TV (now WRTV) beginning in 1949, before moving to WISH in 1956. WTTV became one of the few stations in the United States, and the second in Indianapolis (after WRTV) to have served as a primary affiliate of all three heritage broadcast networks. It is also the only American television station to have carried affiliations with each of the \"Big Three\" networks (excluding the \"Big Four\" era's Fox), three of the four \"netlets\" (excluding MyNetworkTV and not counting the PTEN programming service) and have independent status on its primary channel all at different periods through its history.\n\nIn preparation for the move to CBS, WTTV unveiled a separate website in November 2014, after three years of being relegated to a section of WXIN's website. At the same time, the station announced that it would change its branding from \"Indiana's 4\" to \"CBS 4\" (with branding similar mostly to CBS owned-and-operated stations in Denver, Miami, Boston and Minneapolis and unveiled a logo (seen above) that is also similar to KCNC-TV's KCBS-style logo) upon affiliating with the network.\n\nAfter a failed attempt by Sinclair Broadcast Group to acquire Tribune Media, Nexstar Media Group—which had subsumed Media General's WISH and WNDY in 2017—announced in December 2018 that it would acquire the company. Due to FCC ownership rules and scrutiny, Nexstar was required to divest two of the stations: the company ultimately elected to sell WISH and WNDY to the owner of Bayou City Broadcasting, in favor of retaining WTTV and WXIN. The sale was completed on September 19, 2019.\n\nThe stations' digital signals are multiplexed:\n\nWTTV-DT2 is an independent television station, which operates as a second digital subchannel of WTTV and WTTK. Over-the-air, it broadcasts in standard definition on UHF digital channel 48.2 (or virtual channel 4.2) over WTTV and UHF digital channel 29.2 over WTTK. Branded as Indiana's 4.2, the subchannel is available on Comcast Xfinity digital channel 252; although it maintains an independently programmed general entertainment format, the subchannel is not currently available on Charter Spectrum or AT&T U-verse within the Indianapolis market, resulting in some of WTTV-DT2's programming not being available to those that do not subscribe to Comcast or use an antenna to receive WTTV/WTTK over-the-air.\n\nThe station's digital subchannel on 4.2/29.2 first launched as an affiliate of The Tube Music Network in the fall of 2006, as part of the network's group affiliation deal with Tribune Broadcasting; after The Tube shut down on October 1, 2007, the subchannel switched to a standard definition simulcast of WTTV/WTTK's main channel to provide a quality signal for cable providers before they began instead to downscale the HD feed into standard definition. In November 2009, the 4.2/29.2 subchannel became an affiliate of This TV (which Tribune later acquired a 50% ownership interest in November 2013).\n\nAfter Tribune agreed to affiliate WTTV with CBS, the station originally announced plans to shift its existing CW affiliation to WTTV/WTTK's second digital subchannel upon the switch. This would have made Indianapolis the largest market where The CW is carried as a subchannel-only affiliation, a title held from the network's 2006 launch by Cincinnati, where CBS affiliate WKRC-TV (which, ironically, is now owned by former WTTV/WTTK parent Sinclair Broadcast Group) carries the network on its second subchannel, until May 2017, when San Diego CBS affiliate KFMB-TV began carrying The CW over its DT2 feed. On December 7, 2014, This TV moved from WTTV's 4.2 subchannel to a newly created 59.3 subchannel on WXIN, with 4.2 simulcasting the station's primary feed pending the planned move of CW programming to the subchannel.\n\nAfter Tribune chose to sell the CW affiliation rights for the Indianapolis market to Media General and swap affiliations with WISH-TV, WTTV then announced that it would instead program the 4.2 subchannel as an independent station. This saved Tribune the burden of acquiring prime cable carriage for the subchannel, losing any available viewership for The CW's programming, or having to enter into carriage negotiations with AT&T U-verse, Dish Network and DirecTV to add the subchannel in the first place, as digital subchannels are traditionally not carried on IPTV or satellite providers unless affiliated with a major broadcast network. As a result, to fulfill programming contracts, most of WTTV's existing syndicated programming inventory (including talk shows, drama series and sitcoms) that could no longer air on the station's main schedule due to the heavy schedule of network programming it committed to air via its new CBS affiliation, programming that was considered \"downmarket\", and its new slate of local news programming was moved to digital channel 4.2/29.2 when the subchannel was converted into a general entertainment format on January 1, 2015, along with other syndicated shows not carried by WTTV prior to the switch. The \"Indiana's 4\" branding and logo used by WTTV as a CW affiliate from 2008 to 2014 was also adopted for use by the subchannel.\n\nOn October 20, 2015, Tribune Broadcasting reached an agreement with former WTTV owner Sinclair Broadcast Group to carry the latter group's science fiction-focused multicast network Comet on its stations in Indianapolis, Hartford and Denver. When the network launched on October 31, 2015, WTTV debuted a digital subchannel on virtual channel 4.3/29.3 to serve as an affiliate of Comet. On March 2, 2020, 29.3 became a Cozi TV affiliate while 4.3 continued as a Comet affiliate, separating the two channels' programming.\n\nOn June 12, 2009, the official date in which full-power television stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate, the following changes occurred on WTTV and WTTK. \n\nAfter WXIN shut down its analog signal on June 12, WTTK began broadcasting its signal from a newly installed common antenna atop WXIN's transmitter tower on Westlane Road in northwestern Indianapolis. Prior to the digital transition, WTTK operated its analog transmitter on State Road 213, just south of Windfall; the site remains owned by Tribune, although the FCC does not have an application on file for use of the transmitter as a backup Digital Auxiliary Service.\n\nWTTV clears the entire CBS schedule; this differs from WISH-TV, which preempted select programs from the network and passed them to sister station WNDY from 2005 to 2014. , syndicated programs broadcast on WTTV include \"TMZ on TV\", \"The People's Court\", \"Elementary\" and \"The Big Bang Theory\" (this show had previously aired first-run episodes on WTTV as a CBS affiliate until the series ended). Syndicated programming on WTTV-DT2, which is programmed as an independent station, includes \"Friends\", \"America's Court with Judge Ross\", \"Mike & Molly\", \"Seinfeld\" and \"Two and a Half Men\" (these programs had previously aired on WTTV as a CW affiliate).\n\nFor over half a century, WTTV was central Indiana's home for college basketball games from the Big Ten Conference, with a focus on games involving Indiana University and Purdue University. Until the late 1990s, it produced telecasts of Hoosiers and Boilermakers games, earning it the nickname of \"Indiana's Sports Station.\" In fact, many cable providers in Indiana began carrying WTTV simply so viewers across the state could watch the Hoosiers and Boilermakers. Due to cost-cutting measures in the 1990s, channel 4 shuttered its in-house productions and opted instead for syndication deals with Raycom Sports and ESPN Plus. WTTV also presented other Big Ten football and men's basketball telecasts on Saturdays, until the station lost the rights to those games when the conference launched the Big Ten Network in August 2007. From 2007 to 2013, WTTV aired basketball games from the \"old\" Big East Conference, presumably due to the Notre Dame Fighting Irish's large following in the area. WTTV regained some rights to Big Ten basketball upon its switch to CBS.\n\nWTTV also previously served as the flagship station for Indianapolis Colts NFL preseason games in the past until 2011, when WISH/WNDY took over the rights. WTTV traditionally produced statewide boys' and girls' high school basketball tournament finals and high school football championship games; however, after the Indiana High School Athletic Association converted its basketball tournament from a single-class to a multi-class format in 1997, WTTV chose not to renew those rights citing a decline in ratings (the broadcasts subsequently moved to WNDY-TV (channel 23) and then to WHMB-TV (channel 40)); a new agreement with the IHSAA returned these events to WTTV in the fall of 2010. The IHSAA moved the tournaments to Fox Sports Indiana in the 2013–14 season.\n\nWTTV also served as the television flagship for the Indiana Pacers from the team's days in the original American Basketball Association (except in 1984–85, when those rights were held by present-day sister station WXIN due to Pacers owner Melvin Simon's part-ownership of the station) to 2006. WTTV lost the rights to the Pacers telecasts after the 2005-06 season, when the NBA team moved their local game telecasts to Fox Sports Indiana.\n\nIn August 2008, WTTV debuted \"Hoosier High School Sports Overtime\", a weekly half-hour program devoted to Indiana high school athletics that airs Sunday mornings at 11:30 a.m.; it is hosted by WXIN sports anchor Jeremiah Johnson. In November of that year, the station also began running \"Hoosier High School Sports Classics\", a two-hour program that features rebroadcasts of past Indiana high school football and basketball state championship games, interspersed with present-day interviews of coaches and athletes that were involved; it aired on Sundays from 9:30 to 11:30 a.m.\n\nWith the switch to CBS, WTTV became the \"de facto\" home station of the Colts, due to CBS' contract to carry a schedule mainly made up of American Football Conference games and \"Thursday Night Football\", and a deal between Tribune Broadcasting and the team making the station and WXIN exclusive broadcast partners. This means both stations air Colts preseason games, team programming and coach's shows; advertising within Lucas Oil Stadium is also included in the deal. Additionally, both stations will carry the Super Bowl for the next three years, with WTTV carrying CBS' coverage of Super Bowl LIII in 2019, WXIN airing Fox's coverage of Super Bowl LIV in 2020, and WTTV airing Super Bowl LV in 2021 (CBS and NBC switched Super Bowl coverage in 2021 and 2022; this was so that NBC would not have to worry about airing coverage of the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing (which start the Friday before Super Bowl LVI) against CBS' coverage of the Super Bowl. Between CBS' AFC rights and Fox's NFC rights, the only time the Colts would not play on a Tribune station would be if they were scheduled for an \"NBC Sunday Night Football\" telecast, which would air on WTHR, or ESPN's \"Monday Night Football\", which has traditionally aired on WRTV. The first Colts game to air on WTTV as a CBS affiliate was the team's first-round playoff victory over the Cincinnati Bengals on January 4, and it carried two more games in the 2014 NFL season before the Colts lost to the Patriots in the AFC Championship on January 18, 2015. Beginning in 2018, the \"Thursday Night Football\" games are aired on WXIN, due to Fox carrying the package as part of a contract lasting through 2022.\n\nWTTV, through CBS, also owns the local rights to the NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament every other year (years Turner Sports does not carry the tournament's semifinals and final), which has traditionally ranked among the highest-rated programs in the market during tournament season due to Indiana's traditional status as a college basketball hotbed and as the home base for the NCAA. Lucas Oil Stadium holds a regular slot in the Final Four rotation (including the 2015 tourney). WTTV, as previously stated, also carries Big Ten games picked up by CBS, including the conference tournament, which is held every other year at Bankers Life Fieldhouse.\n\nBy coincidence, in addition to trading the CW to WISH-TV, Tribune Media has also taken a large role in programming that station since the switch of CBS to WTTV, along with sister station WNDY, via rights deals for the two stations to carry professional Chicago sports over those two stations which are broadcast by WGN-TV in Chicago, including baseball's Cubs and White Sox and Blackhawks hockey to replace WGN America's former carriage of those sports in the area, as Indianapolis is claimed as Chicago team territory by Major League Baseball and the National Hockey League.\n\nSince 2018, WTTV serves as the main headquarters for Australia's 10 Sport during Indianapolis 500 coverage. All reports for the Australian broadcast network regarding the event are based from WTTV since the integration of 10 Sport into CBS in late 2017.\n\nWTTV presently broadcasts 25½ hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with 4½ hours each weekday, one hour on Saturdays and 1½ hours on Sundays which includes \"IN Focus\" airing at 8:30 a.m.); in addition, WTTV airs \"Colts 365\" on Saturdays at 11:30 p.m. Unlike most CBS affiliates and most Nexstar-owned stations that maintain news operations, WTTV does not air any local newscasts on weekend mornings.\n\nIn 1950, WTTV began operating an in-house news department; after losing its ABC affiliation in 1957, it became one of the few independent stations outside of the ten largest television markets that had a functioning news department. In 1979, the station began airing the first prime time newscast in the Indianapolis market, when it moved its nightly evening news program to 10:00 p.m. (predating WXIN's first and shorter-lived prime time news effort by five years). Capitol Broadcasting abruptly shut down WTTV's news department on November 1, 1990 due to financial problems, with the last 10:00 newscast airing the night before on October 31; 34 staffers were laid off as a result.\n\nThe station replaced the newscast in the 10:00 p.m. slot with syndicated programming for the next few months, before it entered into a news share agreement with ABC affiliate WRTV in April 1991 to produce a half-hour 10:00 p.m. newscast – titled \"WRTV 6 News at Ten\" and later \"6 News at Ten\" – which debuted that fall. After Tribune bought the station, WTTV terminated the news share agreement with WRTV, so as to not compete with new sister station WXIN's longer-established 10:00 p.m. newscast; the WRTV-produced newscast was discontinued on December 31, 2002, with channel 4 filling the 10:00 p.m. slot with syndicated programming thereafter.\n\nUpon becoming a sister station to WXIN, WTTV began carrying that station's prime time newscast during instances where Fox's MLB playoff game telecasts run into the 10:00 p.m. timeslot (not using a \"News at Ten\" logo on-air in place of the \"Fox 59 News\" branding, unlike what Hartford sister station WCCT-TV does during broadcasts of sister station WTIC-TV's newscasts). On January 2, 2008, the station began simulcasting the 6:00 to 9:00 a.m. block of WXIN's weekday morning newscast; the 5:00 a.m. hour of the program began to be simulcast on WTTV on March 31, 2008. The simulcast was briefly discontinued on September 18, 2009, before returning the following month on October 12; the simulcast – by then, running only from 4:30 to 6:00 a.m. – was moved to WTTV/WTTK's This TV-affiliated second digital subchannel on September 13, 2010, later expanding to include the full six-hour broadcast from 4:00 to 10:00 a.m. along with the three-hour weekend morning newscast; the simulcast was discontinued again in September 2013. The only locally produced programming on WTTV/WTTK that was close to a news product after the simulcast moved from the stations' main channel was the business showcase \"Indy's MarketPlace\" (or \"Indiana's Market\"), which aired weekdays at 8:00 and 11:30 a.m.; the program ended on September 10, 2010.\n\nOther than simulcasts and default carriage of WXIN's newscasts due to Fox Sports programming delays, WTTV did not carry traditional local newscasts produced specifically for itself from the 2002 cancellation of the WRTV-produced newscast to its switch to CBS; it was one of only five Tribune-owned stations that did not carry daily newscasts (alongside WNOL-TV in New Orleans, WCCT-TV in Hartford/New Haven, WDCW in Washington, D.C. and WSFL-TV in Miami) of any kind.\n\nHowever, with the announcement of the CBS affiliation's move to WTTV, the station announced plans to launch newscasts separate from those on WXIN with its own on-air staff (similar to, though also differing in structure from the shared news operation of St. Louis sister duopoly KTVI/KPLR-TV, the latter of which maintains separate anchors from KTVI for certain newscasts), which is housed out of the two stations' shared facility on Network Place. This makes WXIN/WTTV the first known duopoly (legal or virtual) involving a Big Three affiliate and a Fox station, in which the two stations maintain separate news departments and newscasts in competing timeslots (the presence of two separate, but jointly based news departments controlled by one company structured in this manner is more common with duopolies involving stations affiliated with two of the Big Three networks). There is a considerable amount of sharing between WTTV and WXIN in regards to news coverage, video footage and the use of reporters; though both outlets maintain their own primary on-air personalities (such as news anchors and meteorologists) that only appear on their respective station.\n\nIn December 2014, WTTV announced the hirings of its weekday morning, noon and evening anchor teams, which include weeknight anchors Debby Knox (who had previously retired from WISH in 2013) and Bob Donaldson (who also continued to serve in his longtime role as anchor of WXIN's 10:00 p.m. newscast, before relegating his anchor duties exclusively to WTTV until January 2016), morning anchors Marianne Lyles (formerly of WISN-TV in Milwaukee) and Tim Doty (formerly of Grand Rapids sister station WXMI), and meteorologists Chris Wright (formerly of WISH, WTHR and WXIN) and Lindsay Riley (formerly of KXAS-TV in Dallas-Fort Worth). The newscasts launched with WTTV's CBS affiliation on January 1, 2015; while it does hinder both stations, WTTV and WXIN each produce newscasts that run concurrently in most traditional timeslots, except on weekend mornings (as WTTV carries the CBS Dream Team lineup), weekdays at noon and weekends at 6:00 p.m. (as WXIN airs syndicated programming in both periods, with sports programming periodically airing in the latter slot on either station). Since relaunching its news department, WTTV has waged a spirited battle for second place (behind long-dominant WTHR) in the local news ratings against WRTV, WISH-TV and sister station WXIN.\n\n\n\nFrom the 1960s to the early 1980s, WTTV was known in Central Indiana for its local programming, including children's shows \"Janie\" (previously titled \"Popeye and Janie\") and \"Cowboy Bob's Corral\" (previously titled \"Chuckwagon Theatre\", both starring Bob Glaze in the role of Cowboy Bob). Late night horror movies during this timeframe were presented by Sammy Terry, a ghoulish vampire character portrayed by Bob Carter. The station frequently ran local advertising including from Dave Mason Buick, featuring the catchphrase \"Old Dave needs the money\"; Mason was often shown in the stands during coverage of the Marion County fair. In the late 1980s, the station produced a film noir-styled mystery show titled \"Hide & Sneak\", which was related to a scratch-off game distributed at local supermarkets. Solving the mystery presented in one of the skits led to prizes. Each episode aired only once, however, because of its time-sensitive nature.\n\nIn 1989, WTTV obtained the local rights to the Hoosier Lottery's daily drawings and its companion game show, \"Hoosier Millionaire\"; the station lost the lottery rights to WNDY-TV in September 1995; WTTV regained the rights to the lottery in 1999, partnering with WRTV in the production of the Hoosier Lottery's daily drawings to fulfill requirements of channel 4's contract with the lottery commission, which required the evening drawings to air during local newscasts.\n\nIn August 2008, Clear Channel-owned radio station WFBQ (94.7 FM) formed a partnership with the Tribune Company to produce a television broadcast of the nationally syndicated radio program \"The Bob & Tom Show\" (hosted by Bob Kevoian and Tom Griswold); the pre-recorded hour-long program – featuring highlights taken from that day's radio broadcast – aired on WTTV and co-owned Chicago-based cable superstation WGN America, in an effort by Tribune to bring back programming distributed by the company on its stations. The program debuted on November 3, 2008; WGN America dropped the program on September 10, 2010.\n\n\n\nSpecific to WTTV\n\nSpecific to WTTK\n"}

First run in 1978 and held annually since 1980, it features a flat, fast course which saw nearly 20 percent of finishers qualify for the Boston Marathon in 2010. The event has sold-out in mid-August the past eight years. There are 7,000 runners in the full marathon and 11,000 in the half marathon, making it one of the largest running events in the United States. Proceeds go to Nationwide Children's Hospital. 2018 marks the seventh year of this partnership; so far $7 million has been raised for the Hospital. This includes more than $800,000 contributed since 2012 by the Columbus Marathon Board of Directors.\n\nThe concept of the Columbus Marathon was the brainchild of former Mayors Tom Moody and Greg Lashutka as a way to put Columbus on the map and showcase the city at the same time. The inaugural race was held on June 4, 1978. The 1980 race, on November 16, hosted 2,500 runners. Tommy Persson of Sweden set a course record of 2:11:02 that remains unbroken (as of 2017).\n\nThe cloverleaf design of the course also makes it easy for spectators to see their athletes at several different points – all within a block walking distance. The course begins in downtown Columbus and takes athletes east through Bexley, Ohio, past the Governor's Mansion and Capital University; back through the festive neighborhood of Old Town East; south through German Village; up High Street through downtown Columbus and the Short North Arts District; a jaunt through The Ohio State University, including past The Oval and through Ohio Stadium, home of the football Buckeyes, and through Upper Arlington, through the tree-lined streets of Victorian Village and back to a huge crowd awaiting finishers outside Nationwide Arena in the Arena District.\n\n\nColumbus remains one of the top marathons to qualify runners for the Boston Marathon. The Columbus Marathon has affected Columbus and Central Ohio. More than 250,000 runners have come from 37 countries and all 50 states to participate in the Columbus Marathon. The Columbus Marathon is also one of the last qualifying marathons before registration opens for the Boston Marathon.\n\nMore than 50 Olympians have run in Columbus, including the 1980 men's Silver Medalist, Gerard , 1984 Women's Gold Medalist, Joan Benoit, 1984 Men's Fourth Place Finisher, Joseph Nzau and 1984 Women's 6th Place Finisher, Priscilla Welch. \nIn 1983, seven women qualified for the Women's U.S. Olympic Trials event, six of them were from the state of Ohio. The top 10 males also qualified for their Olympic Trials events. Seven of them men ran in the 1984 Olympics for their respective countries. The following year, eight Olympians competed in the Columbus Marathon.\nIn 1992, 109 of the country's top runners came to Columbus. Only 3 would qualify for the team and their quest for a medal at the Summer Olympics: Steve Spence, Ed Eyestone, and Bob Kempainen.\n\nSince then, more and more athletes have come to Columbus to qualify for the Olympic Marathon Trials.\n\nThe Columbus Marathon has been designated by Runner's World as one of the Top 20 marathons in the nation and by \"USA Today\" as one of the top 10 Fall marathons.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2182256", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2182256", "title": "Anglican Church of Mexico", "text": "Anglican Church of Mexico\n\nThe Anglican Church of Mexico (), originally known as Church of Jesus, is the Anglican province in Mexico, and includes five dioceses. The primate is Francisco Moreno, Bishop of Northern Mexico. The shield of the denomination uses the colors representing Mexico as well as those of the Episcopal Church (US) recognizing its historical connection with the US church.\n\nThe Anglican Church of Mexico can trace its roots to the Mexican War for independence in 1810, and to the attempt in 1854 by several liberal minded priests who later supported the liberal Constitution of 1857 (for this reason they became known as “Constitutionalist Fathers”) to reform the local Roman Catholic Church, but it was the Reform War that led to the foundation of the Church. Religious reforms in 1857 secured freedom of religion, separating the Roman Catholic Church from government and politics. In 1860, the newly formed Church of Jesus contacted the Protestant Episcopal Church in the United States of America, seeking Apostolic Succession. In 1879, the first bishop, H. Chauncey Riley, was consecrated. In 1958, the fourth missionary bishop of Mexico José G. Saucedo was the first of the Church's bishops to be consecrated on Mexican soil, being the de facto leader of the Mexican Church for the second half of the twentieth century leading the process for it to become an autonomous Province of the Anglican Communion on 1 January 1995, and being elected its first Primate Archbishop.\n\nToday, there are 52 Anglican parishes in Mexico, 36 missions, and 12 other affiliated institutions.\n\nThe polity of the Anglican Church of Mexico is episcopal, as is true of all other Anglican churches. The church maintains a system of geographical parishes organized into dioceses. There are 5 of these, each headed by a bishop. Each diocese is divided into archdeaconries, each headed by a senior priest. The archdeaconries are further subdivided into parishes, headed by a parish priest. Several of the dioceses are named in Spanish merely for a compass direction — del Occindente, del Norte, del Sureste — which translate directly as \"of the West\" &c. However, the Episcopal Church and other English-language Anglican Communion sources instead render these names with \"Mexico\" — e.g. \"of Western Mexico\" — so these are the forms used on the English-language Wikipedia.\nIn 1879, diocesan bishop Henry C. Riley was ordained and consecrated by the Episcopal Church in the United States of America as \"Bishop of the Valley of Mexico\", to exercise oversight over the Mexican \"Church of Jesus\". Riley resigned in 1884 and the care of the independent church lapsed to the Presiding Bishop of the Episcopal Church. Henry Forrester, the church's local administrator, was elected Bishop of the Valley of Mexico, but died before consecration.\n\nIn 1904, the Episcopal Church formed all of the Mexican Republic into one Missionary District of Mexico, for North American Anglicans/Episcopalians in Mexico; and which the native Church of Jesus joined in 1906. That year, Henry D. Aves was consecrated first Missionary Bishop of Mexico and resigned in 1923. In 1926, Frank W. Creighton succeeded him as second missionary bishop. In 1972, the Episcopal Church divided the missionary district in three, creating those of Northern and of Western Mexico, and renaming the remaining portion as Central & Southern Mexico; on 1 January 1980, all three were erected into dioceses. In 1988/9 the Central and Southern diocese was again split in three, creating the Cuernavaca and Southeastern dioceses, the remainder being named, again, the Diocese of Mexico (City). The diocese today is based in Mexico City, where its cathedral is St Joseph of Grace.\n\nCarved out in 1972 from the missionary district of Mexico; erected a diocese in 1980. Based in Monterrey, Nuevo León; where is the Cathedral of the Holy Family.\n\nCarved out in 1972 from the missionary district of Mexico; erected a diocese in 1980. Based in Zapopan, Jalisco; cathedral of St Paul in that city.\n\nCarved out in 1989 from the Central & Southern diocese in 1988/9; Cathedral of St Michael & All Saints, Cuernavaca, Morelos.\n\nCarved out in 1989 from the Central & Southern diocese in 1988/9; based in Xalapa, Veracruz.\n\n\n\nThe Anglican Church of Mexico embraces three orders of ministry: deacon, priest, and bishop. A local variant of the Book of Common Prayer is used.\n\nThe Anglican Church of Mexico allows women to be ordained as deacons and priests.\n\nThe Anglican Church of Mexico only recognizes heterosexual marriage as the standard for marriage in the church. Upon the approval of gay civil marriage in Mexico, Primate Francisco Moreno expressed that the official stance of the Anglican Church of Mexico will continue in spite of secular legislation.\n\nOne parish in the country, English speaking St. Mark's Anglican Church in Guadalajara, Jalisco, has publicly expressed support for LGBTQ unions.\n\nOnly one of the currently active bishops has openly spoken in support of same-gender marriage, Canadian-educated Julio C. Martín, bishop of Southeast Mexico. The Diocese of Mexico, under bishop Carlos Touche-Porter, allows the ordination of clergy in same-sex relationships.\n\nIn 2016, the General Synod of the church published a pronouncement declaring itself to be against all forms of violence and discrimination against migrants, victims of violence, or the LGBTI community.\n\nThe center of the Anglican Church of Mexico's teaching is the life and resurrection of Jesus Christ. The basic teachings of the church, or catechism, includes:\n\nThe threefold sources of authority in Anglicanism are scripture, tradition, and reason. These three sources uphold and critique each other in a dynamic way. This balance of scripture, tradition and reason is traced to the work of Richard Hooker, a sixteenth-century apologist.

In all cases it refers to a land in the East. Originally, it referred to the land south of the Caspian Sea, but it gradually expanded to cover all Islamic lands, including in Africa (and possibly even Muslim Sicily).\n\nNotably one of the Ingvar runestones, the Sö 179, raised circa 1040 at Gripsholm Castle, commemorates a Varangian loss during an ill-fated raid in Serkland. The other remaining runestones that talk of Serkland are Sö 131, Sö 279, Sö 281, the Tillinge Runestone and probably the lost runestone U 439.

{"id": "2182292", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2182292", "title": "Ch (digraph)", "text": "Ch (digraph)\n\nCh is a digraph in the Latin script. It is treated as a letter of its own in Chamorro, Old Spanish, Czech, Slovak, Igbo, Kazakh, Uzbek, Quechua, Guarani, Welsh, Cornish, Breton, and Belarusian Łacinka alphabets. In Vietnamese and Modern Spanish, it also used to be considered a letter for collation purposes but this is no longer common.\n\nThe digraph was first used in Latin since the 2nd century B.C. to transliterate the sound of the Greek letter chi in words borrowed from that language. In classical times, Greeks pronounced this as an aspirated voiceless velar plosive . In post-classical Greek (Koine and Modern) this sound developed into a fricative . Since neither sound was found in native Latin words (with some exceptions like \"pulcher\" 'beautiful', where the original sound was influenced by or ), in Late Latin the pronunciation occurred.\n\nIn Old French, a language that had no or and represented by \"c\", \"k\", or \"qu\", \"ch\" began to be used to represent the voiceless palatal plosive , which came from in some positions and later became and then . Now the digraph \"ch\" is used for all the aforementioned sounds, as shown below. The Old French usage of \"ch\" was also a model of several other digraphs for palatals or postalveolars: lh (digraph), nh (digraph), sh (digraph).\n\nIn the Goidelic languages, several Germanic, and Slavic languages that use the Latin alphabet instead of the Cyrillic alphabet, and others, \"ch\" represents the voiceless velar fricative . Additionally, \"ch\" is frequently used in transliterating into many European languages from Greek, Hebrew, Yiddish, and various others.\n\nBreton has evolved a modified form of this digraph, \"c'h\" for representing , as opposed to \"ch\", which stands for . In Manx, \"ch\" stands for , while is represented by \"çh\".\n\nIn Rheinische Dokumenta, \"ch\" represents , as opposed to \"ch\", which stands for .\n\nIn Welsh, it represents the voiceless uvular fricative . \n\nIn English, \"ch\" is most commonly pronounced as , as in \"chalk\", \"cheese\", \"cherry\", \"church\", \"much\", etc.\n\n\"Ch\" can also be pronounced as , as in \"ache\", \"choir\", \"school\" and \"stomach\". Most words with this pronunciation of \"ch\" find their origin in Greek words with the letter chi, like \"mechanics\", \"chemistry\" and \"character\". Others, like \"chiaroscuro\", \"scherzo\" and \"zucchini\", come from Italian.\n\nIn English words of French origin, \"ch\" represents , as in \"charade\", \"machine\", and \"nonchalant\". Due to hypercorrection, this pronunciation also occurs in a few loanwords from other sources, like machete (from Spanish) and pistachio (from Italian).\n\nIn certain dialects of British English \"ch\" is often pronounced in two words: \"sandwich\" and \"spinach\", and also in place names, such as Greenwich and Norwich.\n\nIn words of Scots origin it may be pronounced as (or ), as in \"loch\" and \"clachan\". In words of Hebrew or Yiddish origin it may be pronounced as (or ), as in \"challah\".\n\nThe digraph can also be silent, as in \"Crichton\", \"currach\", \"drachm\", \"yacht\" and traditionally in \"schism\".\n\nIn English Braille, the \"ch\" digraph, when pronounced as , is represented by a single cell:\n\nIn Breton \"ch\" represents the .\n\nThis digraph should not be confused with \"c'h\" .\n\nIn Catalan \"ch\" represents final sound. In the past it was widely used, but nowadays it is only used in some surnames. In medieval Catalan it was occasionally used to represent sound.\n\n\"Ch\" is the fifth letter of the Chamorro language and its sound is .\nThe Chamorro Language has three different dialects - the Guamanian dialect, the Northern Mariana Islands dialect, and the Rotanese dialect. With the minor difference in dialect, the Guamanians have a different orthography from the other two dialects. In Guamanian orthography, both letters tend to get capitalized (eg.: \"CHamoru\"). The Northern Mariana Islands' & Rotanese orthography enforces the standard capitalization rule (eg.: \"Chamorro\").\n\nIn Mandarin Chinese \"ch\" is used in Pinyin to represent an aspirated voiceless retroflex affricate .\n\nThe letter \"ch\" is a digraph consisting of the sequence of Latin alphabet graphemes C and H, however it is a single phoneme (pronounced as a voiceless velar fricative ) and represents a single entity in Czech collation order, inserted between \"H\" and \"I\". In capitalized form, \"Ch\" is used at the beginning of a sentence (\"Chechtal se.\" \"He giggled.\"), while \"CH\" or \"Ch\" can be used for standalone letter in lists etc. and only fully capitalized \"CH\" is used when the letter is a part of an abbreviation (e.g. \"CHKO Beskydy\") and in all-uppercase texts.\n\nIn Czech alphabet, the digraph \"Ch\" is handled as a letter equal to other letters. In Czech dictionaries, indexes, and other alphabetical lists, it has its own section, following that of words (including names) beginning with \"H\" and preceding that of words that begin with \"I\". Thus, the word \"chemie\" will not be found in the \"C\" section of a Czech dictionary, nor the name \"Chalupa\" in the \"C\" section of the phonebook. The alphabetical order \"h\" \"ch\" is observed also when the combination \"ch\" occurs in median or final position: \"Praha\" precedes \"Prachatice\", \"hod\" precedes \"hoch\".\n\nIn the 15th century, the Czech language used to contain many digraphs like modern Polish does but most of them were replaced by single letters with diacritic marks by the reform of Jan Hus. Besides \"ch\", there is only one digraph used in the Czech language - \"dž\", representing voiced postalveolar affricate. However, \"ch\" is the only Czech digraph which is treated as a single letter while \"dž\" is used in translating a foreign word into Czech (to approximate a foreign phonetic sound that has no Czech counterpart e.g. jam in Czech is \"dž\"em).\n\nDutch \"ch\" was originally voiceless, while \"g\" was voiced. In the northern Netherlands, both \"ch\" and \"g\" are voiceless, while in the southern Netherlands and Flanders the voiceless/voiced distinction is upheld. The voiceless fricative is pronounced [x] or [χ] in the north and [ç] in the south, while the voiced fricative is pronounced [ɣ] in the north (i.e. the northern parts of the area that still has this distinction) and [ʝ] in the south. This difference of pronunciation is called 'hard and soft g'.\n\nIn native French words, \"ch\" represents as in \"chanson\" (song).\n\nIn most words of Greek origin, it represents as in \"archéologie\", \"chœur\", \"chirographier\"; but \"chimie\", \"chirurgie\", and \"chimère\" have , as does \"anarchiste\".\n\nIn German, \"ch\" normally represents two allophones: the voiceless velar fricative (or ) following \"a\", \"o\" or \"u\" (called \"Ach-Laut\"), and the voiceless palatal fricative following any other vowel or a consonant (called \"Ich-Laut\"). A similar allophonic variation is thought to have existed in Old English.\n\nThe sequence \"chs\" is normally pronounced , as in \"sechs\" (six) and \"Fuchs\" (fox).\n\nAn initial \"ch\" (which only appears in loaned and dialectical words) may be pronounced (common in southern varieties), (common in western varieties) or (common in northern and western varieties). It is always pronounced when followed by \"l\" or \"r\", as in \"Christus\" (Christ) or \"Chlor\" (chlorine).\n\nThe Rheinische Dokumenta writing system uses \"ch\", for the voiceless palatal fricative , while \"ch\" represents .\n\nThe digraph \"ch\" is not properly speaking part of the Hungarian alphabet, but it has historically been used for [tʃ], as in English and Spanish (as with Szechenyi family name), and is found in a few words of Greek or other foreign origin, such as \"technik\", where it is pronounced the same as \"h\", somewhat as in Polish.\n\nIn Interlingua, \"ch\" is pronounced /ʃ/ in words of French origin (e.g. 'chef' = /ʃef/ meaning \"chief\" or \"chef\"), /k/ in words of Greek and Italian origin (e.g. \"choro\" = /koro/ meaning \"chorus\"), and more rarely /t͡ʃ/ in words of English or Spanish origin (e.g. \"cochi\" /kot͡ʃi/ meaning \"car\" or \"coach\"). Ch may be pronounced either /t͡ʃ/ or /ʃ/ depending on the speaker in many cases (e.g. \"chocolate\" may be pronounced either /t͡ʃokolate/ or /ʃokolate/).\n\nIn Irish, \"ch\" stands for when broad and (or between vowels) when slender. Examples: broad in \"chara\" \"friend\" (lenited), \"loch\" \"lake, lough\", \"boichte\" \"poorer\"; slender in \"Chéadaoin\" \"Wednesday\" (lenited), \"deich\" \"ten\".\n\nIn Italian, \"ch\" represents the voiceless velar plosive before -e and -i.\n\n\"Ch\" was selected to represent in the Kazakh Latin alphabet. It was considered a separate letter, and was the 32nd and last letter of the alphabet in the 2018 amendment.\n\nAs part of the switch of Kazakh from Cyrillic to Latin, the initial proposed Latin alphabet in 2017 (implemented by Presidential Decree 569 of 26 October 2017) tried to avoid the use of accent marks and digraphs in representing certain phonemes. Initially, /t͡ɕ/ would have been represented by ⟨C'⟩. This was revised by Presidential Decree 637 of 19 February 2018, replacing the apostrophe with the diagraph ⟨Ch⟩.\n\nHowever, in the later 2019, under president Tokayev's amendment suggestions, the Ch has replaced by Ç in order to keep compatibility with other Turkic languages.\n\nThe Romans used \"ch\" to transliterate the sound of the Greek letter chi in words borrowed from that language. In classical times, Greeks pronounced this as an aspirated voiceless velar plosive . In post-classical Greek (Koine and Modern) this sound developed into a fricative.\n\n\"Ch\" is used in the Lithuanian language to represent the \"soft h\" , in word choras [ˈxɔrɐs̪] \"choir\". This digraph is not considered a single letter in the Lithuanian alphabet. This digraph is used only in loanwords.\n\n\"Ch\" was used in the Massachusett orthography developed by John Eliot to represent a sound similar to and in the modern orthography in use by some Wampanoag tribes for the same sound. In both systems, the digraph \"ch\" is considered a single letter.\n\nIn Xhosa and Zulu, \"ch\" represents the voiceless aspirated velar dental click .\n\nIn Occitan, \"ch\" represents , but in some dialects it is .\n\nIn the Ossetic Latin alphabet, \"ch\" was used to write the sound [].\n\nIn Palauan, \"ch\" represents a glottal stop .\n\n\"Ch\" has been used in the Polish language to represent the \"soft h\" as it is pronounced in the Polish word chleb \"bread\", and the \"h\" to represent \"hard h\", where it is distinct, as it is pronounced in the Polish word hak \"hook\". Between World War I and World War II, the Polish intelligentsia used to exaggerate the \"hardness\" of the hard Polish h to aid themselves in proper spelling. In most present-day Polish dialects, however, \"ch\" and \"h\" are uniformly collapsed as .\n\nIn Portuguese, \"ch\" represents .\n\n\"ch\" is pronounced as a voiceless postalveolar affricate in both Castillian and Hispanic American, or a voiceless postalveolar fricative in Andalusian.\n\n\"Ch\" is traditionally considered a distinct letter of the Spanish alphabet, called \"che\". In the 2010 Orthography of the Spanish Language, \"Ch\" is no longer considered a letter of its own but rather a diagraph consisting of two letters.\n\nUntil 1994 \"ch\" was treated as a single letter in Spanish collation order, inserted between C and D; in this way, \"mancha\" was after \"manco\" and before \"manda\". However, an April 1994 vote in the 10th Congress of the Association of Spanish Language Academies adopted the standard international collation rules, so \"ch\" is now considered a sequence of two distinct characters, and dictionaries now place words starting with \"ch-\" between those starting with \"cg-\" and \"ci-\". Similarly, \"mancha\" now precedes \"manco\" in alphabetical order.\n\nIn Slovak, \"ch\" represents , and more specifically in voiced position. At the beginning of a sentence it is used in two different variants: \"CH\" or \"Ch\". It can be followed by a consonant (\"chladný\" \"cold\"), a vowel (\"chémia\" \"chemistry\") or diphthong (\"chiazmus\" \"chiasmus\").\n\nOnly few Slovak words treat \"CH\" as two separate letters, e.g., \"viachlasný\" (e.g. \"multivocal\" performance), from \"viac\" (\"multi\") and \"hlas\" (\"voice\").\n\nIn the Slovak alphabet, it comes between \"H\" and \"I\".\n\nIn Swedish, \"ch\" represents /ɧ/ and /ɕ/ in loanwords such as \"choklad\" and \"check\". These sounds come from former [ʃ] and [tʃ], respectively. In the conjunction \"och\" (and), \"ch\" is pronounced [k] or silent.\n\n\"Ch\" represents in Upper Sorbian.\n\n\"Ch\" represents [] in Uyghur Latin script.\n\n\"Ch\" represents in the Uzbek alphabet. It is considered a separate letter, and is the 28th letter of the alphabet.\n\nIn Vietnamese, \"ch\" represents the voiceless palatal plosive in the initial position. In the final position, the pronunciation is identical to the final \"-k\": .\n\nIn Welsh \"ch\" represents the voiceless uvular fricative . The digraph counts as a separate letter in the Welsh alphabet, positioned after \"c\" and before \"d\"; so, for example, \"chwilen\" 'beetle' comes after \"cymryd\" 'take' in Welsh dictionaries; similarly, \"Tachwedd\" 'November' comes after \"taclus\" 'tidy'.\n\nInternational Morse code provides a unitary code for \"Ch\" used in several non-English languages, namely \"— — — —\".\n\nIn the Czech extension to Braille the letter \"Ch\" is represented as the dot pattern ⠻. English literary braille also has a single cell dedicated to (dots 1–6), which stands for \"child\" in isolation, but this is considered a single-cell contraction rather than a separate letter.\n\nIn computing, \"Ch\" is represented as a sequence of \"C\" and \"H\", not as a single character; only the historical KOI-8 ČS2 encoding contained \"Ch\" as a single character.\n"}

The first written record, however, dates from 1107.\n\nInitially, it was a small wooden fortress above the Sula River. The fortress quickly grew, and in the 15th or 16th century, it was owned by the powerful Wisniowiecki family. The town was ruled by Magdeburg rights and had a coat of arms.\n\nIn 1596, Lubny was the site of the last battle of Severyn Nalyvaiko against the Poles. In the 17th century the city was one of the largest in the area. In 1638 it had 2,646 inhabitants.\n\nAfter Khmelnytsky Uprising, between 1648 and 1781, the town was the headquarters of the Lubny Cossack Regiment.\n\nIn 1782 Lubny became an uyezd center of Kiev Viceroyalty, in 1793 the town was included into Malorossiya Governorate, since 1802 - into Poltava Governorate\n\nAfter a railroad line was constructed through Lubny in 1901, industry grew rapidly and expanded in the city.\n\nA local newspaper has been circulating in the city since July 1917.\n\nDuring the German occupation in the Second World War, Lubny was the centre of major partisan (resistance) movement. Two Nazi concentration camps were there. On October 16, 1941 over a thousand of the city's Jews, including women and children, were massacred by German Einsatzgruppen on the outskirts of the city. The action, all the way until the execution, was thoroughly documented by photographer Johannes Hähle.\n\nToday, Lubny is a large industrial and cultural centre. Many automotive and farm equipment factories were established during the growth of industry between 1901 and the 1930s. As well, Lubny is a major producer of meat and milk products, furniture and bread. Over 40 types of ice cream are made in the , and the Lubny bread is known across Ukraine.\n\nLubny also has its own soccer team, Lubny Nyva (). Several museums and art galleries are located there, and the Lubny institute district is known for the bookstores that carry a wide variety of technical and non-technical books.\n\nA second local newspaper, \"Visnyk\" () is published in the city since 1994.\n\nThe main landmark of the Lubny District is the Mharsky Monastery, with a large six-pillared Ukrainian Baroque cathedral, built in 1684–92 and renovated after a conflagration in 1754, and a neoclassical bell tower, started in 1784 but not completed until 1844.\n\nLubny is divided into eight microdistricts, each raion is governed by a specially-appointed secretary, and has its own branch of the police force.

The album's fourth single, \"Where'd You Go\", propelled Fort Minor to stardom, reaching No. 4 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100.\n\nMike Shinoda joined Fort Minor as a vocalist. Shinoda uses the name Fort Minor for his collaborations with Ryan Patrick Maginn (Ryu) and Takbir Bashir (Tak), who themselves hail from the underground hip hop group Styles of Beyond.\n\nShinoda began recording songs for this side project following the release of Collision Course in November 2004. \"\" was a mixtape by Shinoda and DJ Green Lantern to promote his upcoming studio album. \"The Rising Tied\", the debut album of Fort Minor, was released in November 2005. Robert Hales directed its first video \"Petrified\", which was released the previous month. Jay-Z, who had previously collaborated with Linkin Park on the 2004 album \"Collision Course\", was the executive producer for \"The Rising Tied\". Shinoda told Corey Moss of MTV News that he imposed on himself a requirement to play all the instruments and write all the lyrics to the album except for the strings, percussion, or choir parts. \"Where'd You Go\", its fourth single, peaked at No. 4 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart, while second single, \"Remember the Name\", reached at No. 66. Another track, \"Kenji\" describes the experiences of a Japanese-American family during the Japanese American internment of World War II.\n\nDue to the success of \"Where'd You Go\" during the week of April 26, 2006, sales of \"The Rising Tied\" increased by 45 percent, and the album chart position went up 89 positions to No. 104 on the \"Billboard\" 200.\" Where'd You Go\" was awarded Ringtone of the Year at the 2006 MTV Video Music Awards.

He perceived the cause of the failure as low quality teachers, and saw that problem in turn as being caused by low salaries, lack of prestige, and lack of support and good training making the job unattractive to qualified candidates, many of whom could get jobs in lucrative fields like quantitative finance. He created the program to provide math and science teachers with higher salaries and better training and funded it with $25M of his own money, adding an additional $25M in 2006. In the initial program, people who were accepted into the program who had degrees in math but were not teachers received a stipend of about $18,000 per year for five years from MfA in addition to their salaries and received free tuition to a high quality one year Master's program in teaching, as well as mentoring and professional development support after the first year. The five-year period was selected because that is the period during which most new teachers drop out; the starting salary of a NYC math teacher with a graduate degree was around $50,000 at that time. The program also offered stipends to qualified existing teachers, to promote their retention in the field. People who were accepted into the program also had to agree that they would pay back some of the support they had received, if they dropped out of the program.\n\nBy 2011 MfA had expanded to science fields as well as math, and organizations had been established and funded in San Diego, Los Angeles, Berkeley, Calif., Utah, Boston, and the District of Columbia. Each site was autonomous, with its own board, fund-raising, and programs tailored to address local needs, but all coordinated with the founding organization and received funding from the Simons Foundation. It had also added two programs to support existing teachers in its New York City location: a Master Teacher Fellowship for experienced secondary school math teachers and the Early Career Fellowship for newer teachers.\n\nBy 2012 the program was working with 330 teachers in the New York City schools, and due to hiring freezes in the school system, reduced the size of its new teacher program and expanded its program to provide stipends to existing teachers; it also announced that in 2013 it would expand to include science teachers and middle school teachers. That year it also started a program offering $5,000 stipends to school administrators who attended seven MfA meetings per year. Its budget before 2012 had been $20M per year and it planned to increase the budget to $30M per year to support the expansion for experienced teachers.\n\nIn 2013 New York State launched a state-funded \"Master Teacher\" program to provide stipends to qualified existing teachers modeled on MfA's program.\n\nOngoing financial support for MfA programs comes from private donors and government grants.\n\n"}

He attended the Dragon School, gaining a scholarship to Rugby School and then a demyship to Magdalen College, Oxford. He won the \"Gibbs Prize\" in 1949 and completed a DPhil in chemistry at Oxford University in 1953 before starting his professional career as a chemist. Bowen was also a proficient amateur actor in his early years, appearing with a young Ronnie Barker at Oxford.\n\nHis first post was with the Atomic Energy Research Establishment (AERE), working at the Wantage Research Laboratory, then in Berkshire. His early work started an interest in radioisotopes and trace elements that he maintained throughout his working life. While at AERE, he spent several months in 1956 attending the British nuclear tests at Maralinga in Australia to study the environmental effects of radiation.\nBowen realised that the calibration of different instruments intended to measure trace elements was an important issue that needed addressing. His solution was to produce a good supply of a material which later become known as \"Bowen's Kale\". With Peter Cawse, he grew a large amount of the plant kale, then dried and crushed it into a homogeneous and stable substance that he then freely distributed to researchers around the world for years to come. This was probably the first successful example of such a standard.\n\nIn 1964, he was appointed as a lecturer in the chemistry department at the University of Reading. Later he was promoted to Reader in analytical chemistry in 1974. At Reading, Bowen undertook consultancy for Dunlop, investigating potential uses for their products. When the \"Torrey Canyon\" oil disaster occurred in 1967, he realised that it might be possible to use foam booms to block the oil from spreading in the English Channel. His original experiments were conducted in a small bucket in his laboratory. Although not entirely successful in reality at the time due to the rough seas, this lateral thinking combined his interest in chemistry with his love of nature and has since been effectively deployed to protect ports and harbours against encroaching oil slicks. Bowen wrote a number of professional books in the field of chemistry, including two editions of \"Trace elements in Biochemistry\" (1966 and 1976).\n\nFrom 1951 onwards, Bowen was a long-serving member of the Botanical Society of the British Isles (BSBI). He was meetings secretary for a period and the official recorder of plants for the counties of Berkshire and Dorset, producing Floras for both counties. He retired to Winterborne Kingston in Dorset at the end of his life. He was also one of the leading contributors of botanical data for the \"Flora of Oxfordshire\". He acted as an expert botanical guide on tours around Europe, especially Greece.\n\nHumphry Bowen donated a large collection of lichens from Berkshire and Oxfordshire to the Museum of Reading in the 1970s. He established the Bowen Cup at the University of Reading in 1988, an annual prize for the student in the Department of Chemistry at the University who achieves the top marks in Part II Analytical Chemistry.\n\n\n"}

He was an early settler at Nashville, Tennessee and in Louisiana. He was a member of the Province of North Carolina House of Burgesses and a delegate for North Carolina in the Continental Congress and a non-voting member of the U.S. House for the Southwest Territory. In historical writings, he is usually referred to as \"Dr. James White\" to distinguish him from General James White, the founder of Knoxville, Tennessee.\n\nWhite was born into a prosperous mercantile family in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. His early education was at the College of St. Omer, a Jesuit school in modern-day France (then part of the Austrian Netherlands). When he returned he entered the University of Pennsylvania and studied medicine and law. After graduating he moved to the Province of North Carolina.\n\nIn 1785, White was elected to the North Carolina House of Representatives. In 1786, North Carolina sent him as a delegate to the Continental Congress where he served until 1788. Late in 1786, Congress named him Superintendent of Indian Affairs for the southern department. After that he was frequently absent from Congress, traveling the Carolina and Georgia frontiers negotiating with the Indian tribes. After his congressional service he moved to the frontier, buying land and settling in what became Nashville, Tennessee.\n\nWhen the Southwest Territory's legislature was formed in 1794, White was selected as its delegate to the United States House of Representatives, serving from 1794 to 1796. After Tennessee gained statehood in 1796, he returned home to Davidson County.\n\nJames White was a brilliant man, fluent in French and Spanish, but he had a tendency to become involved in complicated plots. In the 1780s he had become involved with John Sevier's plan to place the State of Franklin under Spanish rule. He used his position and travels as Indian superintendent to serve as agent conducting negotiations between Sevier and the governor of Spanish Louisiana. In the 1790s he was involved in William Blount's plan to work with the Indians and Britain in staging an invasion of Spanish Florida. As his role in these schemes became known, he moved to the Spanish territory of New Orleans in 1799, settling in what later became St. Martin Parish, Louisiana.\n\nWhile his earlier actions caused problems in Tennessee, they weren't popularly known. When the United States expansion reached him again President Jefferson named him as a territorial judge in 1804, initially for the District of Louisiana, and then for the Territory of Orleans. His family prospered in Louisiana. His son, (Edward Douglass White Sr.), was Governor of Louisiana. His grandson, Edward Douglass White, served as Chief Justice of the United States.\n\nJames White died at home in 1809 in St. James Parish, Louisiana.\n"}

S.Y.S.T.E.M. was an American R&B and dance music group, assembled by Robert Clivillés and David Cole of C&C Music Factory, that was active in 1992. The group featured lead vocals by Michelle Visage, who was formerly a member of another Clivilles & Cole group, Seduction (whose debut CD, \"Nothing Matters Without Love\", had been produced by Clivilles & Cole in 1989). Rounding out the quartet were Octavia Lambertis (often credited simply as Octavia or Octahvia, who had a moderately successful solo career in the 1980s), Gary Michael Wade, and Jamal Alicea. The S.O.U.L. S.Y.S.T.E.M. produced one hit single, \"It's Gonna Be a Lovely Day!\", a pop/house song that sampled the 1978 Bill Withers song \"Lovely Day\". The song appeared on the 1992 film soundtrack, \"\". It reached number 1 on the \"Billboard\" Hot Dance Club Play chart, and peaked at number 34 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, number 16 in the UK Singles Chart in 1993, and number 90 in Australia on the ARIA Chart in 1993. The song \"It's Gonna Be a Lovely Day!\" was the only song on the soundtrack performed by an artist other than Whitney Houston released as a single in the US.\n\nVisage was the recording artist by contract on this song (thus the single cover reading, \"Introducing Michelle Visage\") and the group was born out of a production deal for her as contracted by Clive Davis himself. Her contract included recording three albums but the entire first album was lost after completion and the contract then broken. Visage also shares a writing credit on \"It's Gonna Be A Lovely Day!\". The S.O.U.L. S.Y.S.T.E.M.'s debut album, \"Anything Goes!\", was supposed to be released during 1993's first quarter. Per Michelle Visage, Clivillés + Cole failed to deliver the album's original master tapes (which was completed on early 1993) to Arista Records (for reasons that are unknown to this day). Because the master tapes of the album were never delivered to the label, Arista never issued the album and the act was soon dropped thereafter.\n\nVisage went on to become a TV and radio talk show host, along with RuPaul in NYC and on the cable channel VH1 and can be seen as a current judge on the reality competition show \"RuPaul's Drag Race\".

{"id": "2182339", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2182339", "title": "Café racer", "text": "Café racer\n\nA café racer is a lightweight, powerful motorcycle optimized for speed and handling rather than comfort – and for quick rides over short distances. With bodywork and control layout recalling early-1960s Grand Prix road racing motorcycles, café racers are noted for their visual minimalism, featuring low-mounted handlebars, prominent seat cowling and elongated fuel tank – and frequently knee-grips indented in the fuel tank.\n\nThe term originated among British motorcycle enthusiasts of the early 1960s in London, specifically within the Rocker or \"Ton-Up Boys\" youth subculture, where the bikes were used for short, quick rides between popular cafés, in Watford at the Busy Bee café, and the Ace Café in Stonebridge, London. In post-war Britain, car ownership was still uncommon, but by the late 1950s the average Briton could afford a car, so by the early 1960s the café racer's significance was that a bike had come to represent speed, status and rebellion, rather than mere inability to afford a car.\n\nIn 2014, journalist Ben Stewart described the café racer as a \"look made popular when European kids stripped down their small-displacement bikes to zip from one café hangout to another.\" Writing in 1973, Wallace Wyss maintained that the term \"café racer\" was originally used in Europe to describe a \"motorcyclist who played at being an Isle of Man road racer\" but was actually \"someone who owned a racy machine but merely parked it near his table at the local outdoor cafe.\"\n\nIn addition to light weight, a tuned engine and minimalist bodywork, the café racer typically features distinctive ergonomics. Dropped bars that are low, narrow handlebars (called \"clip-ons\") – enabled the rider to \"tuck in\", reducing wind resistance and improving control. Along with the rearward located seat, the posture often required \"rearsets\", or rear-set footrests and foot controls, again typical of racing motorcycles of the era. Distinctive half or full race-style fairings were sometimes mounted to the forks or frame.\n\nJohn Glimmerveen declared in 2017 that the typical specification of an early café racer would be: swept-back pipes, low-mounted clip-on handlebars or 'Ace' bars, reverse cone megaphone mufflers, TT100 Dunlop tires, rear sets, and larger carburetors (often with inlet trumpet rather than air filters).\n\nThe bikes featured minimalist styling, engines tuned for speed and responsive handling. A typical example was the \"Triton\", a homemade combination of a Triumph Bonneville engine in a Norton Featherbed frame. A less common hybrid was the \"Tribsa\" which had a Triumph engine in a BSA duplex frame. Other hybrids café racers included the \"NorVin\" (a Vincent V-Twin engine in a Featherbed frame), and bikes with racing frames by Rickman or Seeley.\n\nCafé racer styling evolved throughout the time of their popularity. By the mid-1970s, Japanese bikes had overtaken British bikes in the marketplace, and the look of real Grand Prix racing bikes had changed. The hand-made, frequently unpainted aluminium racing fuel tanks of the 1960s had evolved into square, narrow, fibreglass tanks. Increasingly, three-cylinder Kawasaki two-strokes, four-cylinder four-stroke Kawasaki Z1, and four-cylinder Honda engines were the basis for café racer conversions. By 1977, a number of manufacturers had taken notice of the café racer boom and were producing factory café racers, such as the well-received Moto Guzzi Le Mans and the Harley-Davidson XLCR. A special version of the Honda XBR thumper with wire-spoked wheels, the Honda GB500 TT, sought to emulate BSA and Norton café racers of the 1960s.\n\nIn the mid-1970s, riders continued to modify standard production motorcycles into so-called \"café racers\" by simply equipping them with clubman bars and a small fairing around the headlight. A number of European manufacturers, including Benelli, BMW, Bultaco and Derbi produced factory \"café\" variants of their standard motorcycles in this manner, without any modifications made to make them faster or more powerful, a trend that continues today.\n\nManufacturers have noticed that there is a lot of recent consumer interest in café racers. While this approach was not new to the industry, manufacturers have realised the market appeal of this type of ready-to-ride café racer. During the past decade, over 50% of the larger motorcycle manufacturers have adopted the trend. In 2004, Triumph produced a turn-key retro motorcycle with their Thruxton. Another modern cafe racer is the Ducati SportClassic, made from 2006 till 2009.\n\nCurrent stock café racers from motorcycle factories include:\n\n\nRockers were a young and rebellious rock and roll subculture who wanted a fast, personalised and distinctive bike to travel between transport cafés along the newly built arterial motorways in and around British towns and cities. Biker lore has it that the goal of many was to be able to reach – called simply \"the ton – along such a route where the rider would leave from a café, race to a predetermined point and back to the café before a single song could play on the jukebox, called record-racing. However, author Mike Seate contends that record-racing is a myth, the story having originated in an episode of the BBC \"Dixon of Dock Green\" television show. Café racers are remembered as being especially fond of rockabilly music and their image is now embedded in today's rockabilly culture.\n\nThe Café Racer sub-culture has created a separate look and identity with modern café racers taking style elements from American Greasers, British Rockers, 70s bikers, and modern motorcycle riders to create a global style of their own.\n\n\n\n"}

Foster and Frances Nicholson, Thomas Foster was born July 24, 1852, in Lambton Mills, Ontario. His family soon moved to Leaskdale, Ontario after his mother's death.\n\nHe started his working life as a butcher's boy in Toronto, until he saved enough money to purchase his own butcher shop for $50. The earnings from that business allowed him to purchase property which became the source of his eventual wealth.\n\nHe was first elected as an alderman for St. David Ward in 1891, then reelected in 1892 and 1894. In 1895 he lost the election, and did not return to council until 1900 as an alderman for Ward 2, a position which he held until 1909. He was elected to the Toronto Board of Control in 1910; however, he lost the 1911 election. In 1912 he was again elected Controller and kept his seat until 1917.\n\nFoster served as a Member of House of Commons of Canada from 1917 to 1921. He was elected as a Union Government candidate in the 1917 federal election for East York. He lost in his party's nominations for candidates so he ran as an independent but lost his seat in the 1921 election.\n\nFoster returned to City Council for the next three years, then was elected as mayor in 1925. He was a great supporter of Hydro expenditures and loved flowers. As an alderman he fought for the rebuilding of the pavilion at Allan Gardens after it had been destroyed by fire. In his 25 years of civic service he earned the informal title of \"Honest Tom\". As mayor of Toronto he was reported to have saved the city two million dollars by rigid economics. \n\nFoster was known to collect the rents on his properties in person, even when he was mayor. If a tenant complained about a problem, or wanted a bit of work done, Foster would go out to his car, get his tools and fix the issue on the spot. His penny pinching eventually led to his defeat due to his refusal to raise police salaries.\n\nHe was a great traveler and on one of his trips he was inspired by the Taj Mahal. In 1935 and 1936 he had a memorial temple constructed on a hill between Leaskdale and Uxbridge, Ontario, for his family at a cost of $200,000. The temple was designed by Foster with architects H.H. Madill and James H. Craig and inspired by Mughal architecture and Byzantine architecture.\n\nHe died at the age of 93 and is buried in the massive mausoleum on a hill north of town on Durham Regional Road 1 which includes the remains of Foster, his wife and daughter. Foster left $80,000 in funds to maintain the property in perpetuity but the trustees spent the principal and the funds had dried up by the 1990s, leaving the Town of Uxbridge to take over responsibility for the monument. In 2013, it was estimated that $1 million was needed to repair and restore the building, a controversial task given that the entire budget for the municipality was only $14 million.\n\nAmong other things, Foster left $500,000 for cancer research, $100,000 for an annual picnic to be held at Exhibition Park for school children, and funds to feed wild birds in Toronto. Inspired by the Great Stork Derby, Mayor Foster also sponsored a contest to reward mothers for their skills at procreation. The prizes were $1,250 for first, $800 for second, and $450 for third. Four ten-years periods began and ended on his death date, and ran from 1945–55, 1948–58, 1951–61, and 1954-64.\n\nA bronze portrait medallion of Thomas Foster by Christian Corbet was publicly unveiled in 2009 and is permanently housed in the memorial.\n\nHe was also a member of the Orange Order in Canada.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2182355", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2182355", "title": "Magic: The Gathering deck types", "text": "Magic: The Gathering deck types\n\nGameplay of the collectible card game \"\" is fueled by each player's deck of cards, which constitute the resources that player can call upon to battle their opponents in any given game. With more than ten thousand unique cards in the game, a considerable number of different decks can be constructed. Each card is designed to have certain strengths (and sometimes weaknesses) and therefore a significant part of the game is determined by which cards a player chooses to include in their deck. Broadly speaking, decks can be loosely classified based on their play style and mode of victory. The game's designers often explicitly create cards which are intended to fuel one or more of these given archetypes, in order to create competitive balance and diversity.\n\nWhile the deck types listed below are specific to \"Magic: The Gathering\", these concepts also extend to other collectible card games.\n\nMost classifications of decks begin from one of four major strategies: aggro, control, combo and midrange..\n\nAggro (short for \"aggressive\") decks attempt to reduce their opponents from 20 life to 0 life as quickly as possible, rather than emphasize a long-term game plan. Aggro decks focus on converting their cards into damage; they prefer to engage in a race for tempo rather than a card advantage-based attrition war. Aggro generally relies upon creatures as its accumulative source of damage. Aggro decks can quickly overwhelm unprepared opponents and proceed to eke out the last bit of damage they need to end the game. Aggro decks also generally have access to disruptive elements, which can inhibit the opponent's attempts to respond.\n\n\nControl decks avoid racing and attempt to slow the game down by executing an attrition plan. As the game progresses, control decks are able to take advantage of their slower, more powerful, cards. The primary strength of control decks is their ability to devalue the opponent’s cards. They do this in four ways:\n\n\n\nCombo decks use the interaction of two or more cards (a \"combination\") to create a powerful effect that either wins the game immediately or creates a situation that subsequently leads to a win. Combo decks value consistency, speed, and resilience: the deck should be reliable enough to produce the combo on a regular basis, the deck should be able to use the combo fast enough to win before the opponent, and the deck should be able to withstand disruption and still win.\n\nMany decks have smaller, combo-like interactions between their cards, which is better described as synergy.\n\n\nA typical midrange deck has an early game plan of mana ramp and control, but begins to play threats once it reaches four to six mana. A midrange deck will often seek to play a reactive, attrition-based game against aggro decks and a more proactive, tempo-based game against control decks. Colloquially, this is referred to as \"going bigger\" than aggro and \"getting in under\" control.\n\nAggro-control is a hybrid archetype that contains both aggressive creatures and control elements. These decks attempt to deploy quick threats while protecting them with light permission and disruption long enough to win. These are frequently referred to as \"tempo\" strategies, as they are built with a sense of timing. Tempo players look to control the game early and take advantage of a strong board state. Where purely control decks look to out class players with more quality in the later stages of the game, tempo looks to keep opponents off balance from the very start.\n\n\nControl-Combo is a control deck with a combo finisher that it can spring quickly if need be. A notable subtype of Control-Combo is \"prison,\" which institutes control through resource denial (usually via a combo).\n\n\nAggro-combo decks employ aggressive creature strategies along with some combination of cards that can win in \"combo\" fashion with one big turn. For instance, Ravager Affinity decks that include Disciple of the Vault can win by attacking with creatures and also with a combo finish of sacrificing multiple artifacts to Arcbound Ravager and killing the opponent with Disciple triggers.\n\n\nAggro-control-combo decks combine efficient, creature-based damage, heavy disruption elements, and an ability to unleash an extremely powerful synergy that can end the game in \"combo\" fashion.\n\n\nOther than the traditional outlook grouping the decks into general buckets (aggro, control, midrange, combo), there are 2 modern outlooks breaking deck archetypes that are meant to more accurately describe how decks actually exploit different aspects of the game into winning conditions.\n\nAspect analysis assigns very specific traits to 3 of the buckets and lists everything else as a combination of those. The 3 main buckets being aggro, control, and combo. Combinations and the inverse combinations may actually vary in the implemented strategies and aspects and therefore are generally not grouped in the same category. A great example of this is control-aggro (aka midrange) vs aggro-control (tempo). From these buckets, different strategies are drawn depending on the type of actual implementation of the deck in question. However, the vast majority of MTG decks use one or a combination of the following aspects to win.\n\n\nThe graphic listed in this section explains how the traditional archetypes use these different aspects of MTG.\n\nThe strategic axes analysis groups the different types of decks (aggro, control, combo, aggro-control, control-aggro aka midrange, prison, gimmick, meta) into combinations of the axes listed below. Some of these may overlap with Aspect Analysis.\n\nThe traditional archetypes fit into the axes in the following manner:\n\n\nTraditionally, Aggro was seen as advantaged over Control, Control advantaged over Combo, and Combo advantaged over Aggro. Wizards of the Coast has sought to make high casting-cost spells more powerful than in the early days of \"Magic\", and have also wanted to play up creature combat more - an aggressive deck should have to worry about blocking and opposing creatures even from Control and Combo decks. To that end, R&D member Zac Hill described an ideal metagame structured such that:\n\n\nEach of these 4 categories would ideally occupy around 25% of a given metagame. In Hill's definition, Aggro refers most specifically to the fastest creature decks built to punish slow starts, ponderous Control decks, and aggressive decks who've substituted out damage for disruption. Midrange decks in this definition are slower creature-based decks who trump the speed of fast aggro with better quality from their somewhat more expensive spells. (Both of these would likely be considered \"Aggro\" in the traditional definition.) \"Ramp\" and \"Combo\" are conceptually similar as noted above; while the combo deck might seek to set up a combination of 2 or 3 cards for a powerful, game-changing effect, the ramp deck instead focuses on building mana as fast as possible and then casting game-changing yet expensive spells, or taking advantage of certain interactions that require a large manabase. A midrange deck often doesn't have the sheer speed to stop ramp or combo from either casting a huge spell or \"going off\" with the combo. Control decks can counter or otherwise answer the single big threat ramp decks and combo decks provide while winning the long game. Similarly, \"disruptive aggro\" (equivalent to Aggro-Control in the classic archetypes above) can also stop the single threat Combo and Ramp offer while focusing on winning faster. These rules can change however as blocks cycle and meta shifts.\n"}

The station is owned by the Sinclair Broadcast Group, as part of a duopoly with Sanger-licensed CW affiliate KFRE-TV (channel 59). The two stations share studios on McKinley Avenue in eastern Fresno ( southwest of Fresno Yosemite International Airport); KMPH's transmitter is located on Big Baldy Mountain in northwestern Tulare County.\n\nThe station's signal is relayed to the northern part of the market on low-powered Class A translator KMPH-CD, virtual channel 17 (UHF digital channel 19), licensed to Merced and Mariposa, with transmitter on Mount Bullion. Unlike its parent station, the translator does not broadcast in high definition.\n\nKMPH-TV's focus is on the San Joaquin Valley and Central California. KMPH-TV's signal is receivable as far way as the Bakersfield area; however, local Fox affiliate and sister station KBFX-CD (itself once a KMPH repeater) is the only Fox station carried by cable providers in the Bakersfield market. Through its translator, KMPH's signal extends northward to Merced, Mariposa and the southern Sierra Nevada, and sometimes can be received in Monterey County for those who live just north of King City. KMPH has been received over the air sometimes in eastern Kern County (Ridgecrest) and San Luis Obispo.\n\nThe station first signed on the air on October 11, 1971; originally operating as an independent station (though it ran ABC, NBC, and CBS shows that the local affiliates passed on at times as well), it was the first television station founded by the Pappas brothers, Mike, Pete and Harry, through their company, Pappas Television. The brothers already owned radio stations KGEN (1370 AM) and KBOS (94.9 FM) in Tulare, KMPH's original city of license. The station's original studios were located on Mooney Boulevard in Visalia. The funding for KMPH came from general manager Harry Pappas' plan of having hundreds of investors each investing a small amount of money that was needed to construct the station, rather than having one investor providing all the capital; as a result, the Pappas brothers had a combined ownership stake of only 30.5%, with the other 69.5% controlled by other investors.\n\nKMPH carried Operation Prime Time programming at least in 1978. That year, Harry Pappas formed a new company, Pappas Telecasting, to buy full control of the station for $3.1 million. In 1979, KMPH changed its city of license from Tulare to Visalia.\n\nSoon after signing on, KMPH had passed KAIL (then on channel 53, now on channel 7) as the leading independent in the Central Valley. KAIL went dark in 1973 but returned to the air in 1976 as a very low budget operation initially running mostly religion but would gradually build into a major player. Throughout the early to mid-1980s, KMPH was one of the top independent stations in the country. The station could be received up to from Visalia.\n\nPappas signed an affiliation deal with Fox for KMPH to become an affiliate of the network upon its startup on October 9, 1986; the agreement also covered sister stations WHNS in Greenville, South Carolina and KPTM in Omaha, Nebraska. At the time, Fresno and Omaha were the only two top-100 markets without a Fox affiliate. KMPH remains a Fox affiliate to this day; both it and NBC affiliate KSEE (channel 24) were the only two stations in Fresno that were unaffected by the 1985 network swap involving ABC and CBS between KFSN-TV (channel 30) and KJEO (channel 47, now KGPE) and the later launches of The CW and MyNetworkTV in September 2006. The station relocated its operations from its original studio in Visalia to its current facility on McKinley Avenue in Fresno in the early 1990s.\n\nOn May 10, 2008, thirteen Pappas stations, including KMPH, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. As a result of the bankruptcy, Pappas Telecasting Companies was given until February 15, 2009 to sell these stations to other owners. On January 16, 2009, Pappas announced that most of the stations, including KMPH, would be purchased by New World TV Group (no relation to the similarly named New World Communications, which switched most of its stations to Fox between September 1994 and July 1995), after the sale received United States bankruptcy court approval. On April 2, 2009, Pappas laid off 22 employees involved with the KMPH/KFRE duopoly. New World TV Group formed a new holding company known as the Titan TV Broadcast Group (unrelated to the similarly named smaller-market radio station owner Titan Broadcasting), which completed its purchase of most of the Pappas stations involved in the bankruptcy on October 15, 2009.\n\nTitan announced the sale of KMPH-TV, KFRE-TV and most of the company's other stations to the Sinclair Broadcast Group on June 3, 2013. The FCC approved the sale on September 19, and the sale was officially finalized on October 3, 2013. With the completion of the sale, KMPH was reunited with Bakersfield Fox affiliate, KBFX-CD, which formerly operated as a repeater of KMPH, but was sold by Pappas in 2005 and had been acquired by Sinclair as part of its merger with Fisher Communications earlier in 2013.\n\nThe station's digital signal is multiplexed:\n\nOn October 2009, KMPH began carrying the movie-oriented digital multicast network This TV on digital subchannel 26.2. On October 31, 2015, Comet began airing on 26.3.\n\nOn October 1, 2019, KMPH-DT2 became an affiliate of CBS Corporation's Dabl network, replacing This TV.\n\nKMPH-TV shut down its analog signal, over UHF channel 26, on June 12, 2009, the official date in which full-power television in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station's digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 28. Through the use of PSIP, digital television receivers display the station's virtual channel as its former UHF analog channel 26.\n\nSyndicated programs broadcast by KMPH-TV include \"The Wendy Williams Show\", \"The People's Court\", \"Modern Family\", \"The Big Bang Theory\", and \"Family Feud\".\n\nIn 2003, KMPH stopped carrying Fox's children's program block 4Kids TV; the block, which normally aired on Saturdays, was moved to sister station KFRE-TV and aired on that station on a tape delay on Sunday mornings (this resulted in KFRE carrying children's blocks from two major networks, as it already carried The WB's Kids' WB block). KMPH was one of the few Fox charter affiliates to have dropped the network's children's programming; beginning in the mid-1990s, Fox gave its affiliates (after several stations that switched to the network between 1994 and 1995 that were owned by New World Communications opted not to carry the lineup) the option to pre-empt Fox Kids programming and arrange for another local station to carry the block, a practice continued until the end of the 4Kids TV's run. KFRE continued to carry 4Kids TV until the block was discontinued by Fox in December 28, 2008 due to a dispute with the block's lessee 4Kids Entertainment; KMPH has also declined to carry Fox's Saturday morning infomercial block \"Weekend Marketplace\", which instead airs on KFRE in 4Kids TV's former Sunday morning timeslot on the station.\n\nKMPH-TV presently broadcasts 34½ hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with 6½ hours each weekday and one hour each on Saturdays and Sundays); in addition, the station produces the lifestyle program \"Around the Valley\", which airs weekdays at 11:00 a.m. prior to its midday newscast.\n\nIn 1978, KMPH launched its news department and began producing a nightly primetime newscast Monday through Friday; \"The 10 O'Clock News\". Originally the station sourced its national news from the ITN Satellite News Service and API Wire Services to augment its own local news coverage, primarily split between the cities of Visalia and Fresno and the surrounding communities. In late 1979, KMPH launched a short-lived midday newscast, \"The Midday Edition\", which was cancelled after nine months. Later, in the early 1980s, the station's newscast was expanded to Saturdays. In early 1982, KMPH, launched a weekly newsmagazine show, \"The Sunday Edition\", which occupied the 10 p.m. timeslot on Sunday nights; it was cancelled a year later. \"The 10 O'Clock News\" went on to become the longest-running primetime newscast in the Fresno market. On October 6, 2003, KMPH debuted a three-hour weekday morning newscast, titled \"Great Day\"; that same date, the station also launched a half-hour midday newscast at 11:30 a.m. In the spring of 2007, \"Great Day\" was expanded to five hours, running from 5-10 a.m.\n\nIn January 2006, KMPH began to produce a half-hour 11:00 p.m. newscast for sister station KFRE-TV; the newscast was unable to compete against the established late evening newscasts on KFSN-TV, KSEE and KGPE and was canceled the following year in February 2007, due to low ratings. On September 30, 2009, KMPH-TV became the second television station in the Fresno market (after KFSN, which made the upgrade in April 2007) to begin broadcasting its local newscasts in high definition. It was the first television station in the market to provide news video from the field in true high definition, as KMPH upgraded its ENG vehicles, satellite truck, studio and field cameras and other equipment in order to broadcast news footage from the field in high definition, in addition to segments broadcast from the main studio.\n\nKMPH has produced newscasts for KPTM in Omaha, Nebraska since the early 2010s, interspersing live reporters from the Omaha market with studio anchors in Fresno.\n\nIn July 2014, \"Politifact\" reported that KMPH, in a news story, claimed that the implementation of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act had increased the average emergency room wait time in California to five hours. Its reporting was deemed inaccurate, as it was based on statistics released by the California HealthCare Foundation in 2012, and not from after the implementation of the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\n\n"}

The city, founded in AD849 on the ruins of Roman Taparura, is the capital of the Sfax Governorate (about 955,421 inhabitants in 2014), and a Mediterranean port. Sfax has a population of 330,440 (census 2014). The main economic activities of Sfax are industries (phosphate processing), agriculture (olive and olive oil, nuts), fishing (largest fishing port in Tunisia) and trade (import-export). The city is often described as Tunisia's \"second city\", being the second-most populous city after the capital Tunis.\n\nPresent-day Sfax was founded in AD849 on the site of the ancient Roman town (\"\") of Taparura. The modern city has also grown to cover some other ancient settlements, most notably Thenae in its southern suburb of Thyna.\n\nBy the end of the 10th century, Sfax, had become an independent city-state. The city was conquered by Roger II of Sicily in 1148 and occupied until it was liberated in 1156 by the Almohads, and was briefly occupied by European forces again; this time by the Spanish, in the 16th century, before falling into Ottoman hands this time. Sfax became an integral base of the Barbary piracy, prompting an unsuccessful invasion by Venice in 1785.\n\nWhen the Bey of Tunis signed the Bardo Treaty, in 1881, making Tunisia a protectorate, an insurrection broke out in Sfax. Six ironclads were dispatched from Toulon (\"Colbert\", \"Friedland\", \"Marengo\", \"Trident\", \"Revanche\", \"Surveillante\") to join the French Navy ships in Tunisian waters. In Sfax, three ironclads from the Division of the Levant were already present (\"Alma\", \"Reine Blanche\", \"La Galissonnière\"), together with four cannon boats. Sfax was bombarded, and on 16 July the city was taken by the French after hard fighting, with 7 dead and 32 wounded for the French.\n\nDuring World War II, the Axis powers used the city as a major base until British forces took it on 10 April 1943. After World War II, Tunisia was returned to France, but gained independence in 1956.\n\nThe A1 motorway connects Sfax with Tunis. A narrow gauge railway system of SNCFT offers passenger services to Tunis and delivers phosphates and iron ore for export. Sfax is served by Sfax–Thyna International Airport and Syphax Airlines has regularly scheduled flights to Paris-Charles de Gaulle Airport, Montréal–Pierre Elliott Trudeau International Airport, Sabiha Gökçen International Airport, Tripoli International Airport, and charter flights to Jeddah Airport for the pilgrimage to Mecca.\n\nFounded in 1961, Radio Sfax broadcasts twenty hours a day on MW 720 kHz/105.21 MHz.\n\nSfax has a hot semi-arid climate (Köppen \"BSh\"). Owing to its sheltered location relative to Mediterranean Sea winter storms, Sfax receives half the rainfall of Tunis and less even than the major cities of Libya (Tripoli and Benghazi). Summers, like all of North Africa, are hot and almost rainless, whilst winters are very pleasant with only light rain usual.\n\nThe University of Sfax includes: \n\n\n\nSfax is twinned with:\n\n\n\n"}

Born in Rowan County, North Carolina, White served as a captain in the county's militia during the American Revolutionary War. In 1783, he led an expedition into the upper Tennessee Valley, where he discovered the future site of Knoxville. \nWhite served in various official capacities with the failed State of Franklin (1784–1788) before building White's Fort in 1786. The fort was chosen as the capital of the Southwest Territory in 1790, and White donated the land for a permanent city, Knoxville, in 1791. He represented Knox County at Tennessee's constitutional convention in 1796. During the Creek War (1813), White served as a brigadier general in the Tennessee militia.\n\nWhite had a reputation for patience and tactfulness that was often lacking in his fellow Euro-American settlers on the Appalachian frontier. As lieutenant colonel commandant of the Knox County militia, White managed to defuse a number of potentially hostile situations between the settlers and the local Native Americans. He donated the land for many of Knoxville's early public buildings, and helped establish Blount College (now the University of Tennessee). White's descendants continued to play prominent roles in the political and economic affairs of Knoxville into the twentieth century.\n\nBrigadier General James White was born in Salisbury, Rowan County, North Carolina. He was born to Moses White and Mary McConnell White, who were of Scots-Irish descent. In 1770, White married Mary Lawson. White served as a captain in either the Rowan County Regiment or the Mecklenburg County Regiment of the North Carolina militia during the American Revolution, which would subsequently entitle him to a tract of land as payment for his service.\n\nAs a result of North Carolina's Land Grab Act, which opened up lands in what is now East Tennessee to settlement, White and several others explored the Tennessee Valley as far west as what is now Lenoir City in 1783. White eventually obtained a grant for a tract of land at what is now Knoxville, and in 1784 he was elected to the senate of the new State of Franklin, a position which kept him preoccupied for the next two years. White relocated to what is now Knox County in 1785, initially building a simple cabin at what is now the Riverdale community east of modern Knoxville. Within a year, however, he had moved to his tract along the confluence of First Creek and the Tennessee River, and built what became known as White's Fort.\n\nIn 1786, White and fellow explorer James Connor erected White's Fort on a hill overlooking the confluence of First Creek and the Tennessee River. William Blount, governor the Southwest Territory (created in 1790), chose the fort as the Territory's capital, and appointed White justice of the peace and a major in the Hawkins County militia. The following year, White set aside a portion of his land for the creation a territorial capital, named \"Knoxville\" after Secretary of War Henry Knox. The new city was platted by White's son-in-law, Charles McClung, and lots were sold in October 1791.\n\nUpon creation of Knox County in 1792, White became lieutenant colonel commandant of the new county's militia. This appointment came during the latter years of the Cherokee–American wars, a period of heightened hostilities between the Chickamauga Cherokee and the white settlers. In 1793, White defused a potentially violent situation when he dispersed a mob of angry settlers that had amassed at Gamble's Station for a march against the Overhill towns. The Cherokee considered White a man of honor, and the Creeks praised his \"goodness.\" In 1798, White helped negotiate the First Treaty of Tellico.\n\nIn 1796, White represented Knox County at Tennessee's constitutional convention (which took place near his fort). After the admission of the state to the Union, White was elected brigadier general of the new state's Hamilton District (which included what is now Knox, Jefferson, Blount, and Sevier counties), and was elected to the state senate. Upon William Blount's return from the U.S. Senate in 1797, White resigned to allow Blount to run for the seat.\n\nFollowing the Fort Mims massacre of August 1813, Andrew Jackson and John Coffee led the Tennessee militia into northern Alabama in October of that year to engage a contingent of hostile \"Red Stick\" Creeks. The militiamen scored victories at the Battle of Tallushatchee (November 3) and at the Battle of Talladega (November 9). In the aftermath of the latter, one of the hostile groups, the Hillabee, made peace arrangements with Jackson. However, the Tennessee militia's East Tennessee contingent, led by John Cocke, had arrived around the same time, and was unaware of the peace negotiations.\n\nOn November 11, Cocke ordered James White, leader of the Hamilton District militia, to destroy the Hillabee towns. Over the next several days, White attacked the villages of Little Oakfusky and Genalga, burning 123 houses and capturing several Hillabees. On November 18, White dispatched a force of allied Cherokee under Gideon Morgan to surround the main Hillabee town. The Hillabee, believing they had made peace, were unprepared for an attack, and were unable to resist Morgan's assault. The town was destroyed, 64 Hillabees were killed, and several hundred were captured.\n\nThe destruction of the Hillabee towns, sometimes called the \"Hillabee Massacre,\" greatly agitated Jackson, who believed the withdrawal of the Hillabee would demoralize the remaining Red Sticks. To further complicate matters, the East Tennesseans' terms of service were about to expire. In December, Jackson ordered Cocke and the East Tennessee militiamen to return home. The enraged Hillabee quickly rejoined the Red Stick Confederacy, and fought until the end of the war.\n\nIn 1800, White moved to his country estate east of Knoxville, perhaps having grown weary of the city, which had developed into a rowdy frontier capital. He was again elected to the state senate in 1801 and 1803. White served as an elder in the Lebanon-in-the-Forks Presbyterian Church, and later served as an elder in the First Presbyterian Church in Knoxville, which stood on land White had set aside for a church in the 1790s. White died in 1821 at his country estate, and was buried next to his wife in the First Presbyterian Church Cemetery.\n\nWhite's descendants played prominent political and economic roles in Knoxville's development for more than a century after his death. His eldest son, Hugh Lawson White, was a United States Senator, and ran for president on the Whig ticket in 1836. Along with Charles McClung, White's sons-in-law included Judge John Overton (married to Mary White), a cofounder of Memphis, Tennessee, and Senator John Williams (married to Melinda White). His other descendants include Congressman Joseph Lanier Williams, railroad magnate Charles McClung McGhee, Admiral Richmond P. Hobson, and playwright Tennessee Williams.\n\nIn 1970, White's Fort was reconstructed as a museum in downtown Knoxville. White's cabin, which provides the fort's southwest corner, is the only surviving authentic part of the fort, although it had been dismantled and moved several times over the years before being reassembled at its present location. White's other namesakes in Knoxville include the General James White Memorial Civic Coliseum, the James White Parkway, and the James White Greenway.\n\nIn the early 1990s, Pamela Dishongh, who was conducting a survey of the Riverdale Historic District in eastern Knox County for its inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places, discovered what was believed to have been White's first cabin (1785) in Knox County on the front lawn of the McNutt-Campbell-Kennedy House. A subsequent archaeological survey of the site led by University of Tennessee archaeologist Charles Faulkner confirmed the cabin was probably built by White. Faulkner suggests the cabin was a very simple log structure meant to provide temporary shelter.\n\n"}

The school operates largely as an undergraduate polytechnic university but also serves as a vocational school offering apprenticeships for the skilled trades as well as diplomas in vocational education for skilled technicians and workers in support roles in professions such as engineering, accountancy, business administration, nursing, medicine, architecture, and criminology.\n\nKwantlen Polytechnic University was founded as Kwantlen College in 1981 as a response to the growing need for expanded vocational training across the Fraser Valley. In 1995, it became a university college. In 2008, the provincial government announced its intention to amend the \"University Act\" to appoint Kwantlen University College a polytechnic university. The legislation renaming the university college to university received royal assent on May 29, 2008 and KPU began operation as \"Kwantlen Polytechnic University\" on September 1, 2008.\n\nKPU became a member of the Association of Universities and Colleges of Canada (AUCC) on October 24, 2008. Also in affiliation with KPU include: the International Association of Universities (IAU), the Colleges and Institutes Canada (CICan), the Association of Commonwealth Universities (ACU), the Canadian Bureau for International Education (CBIE), and the Canadian University Press (CUP).\n\n\"The Globe and Mail Canadian University Report\" ranked KPU among the top post-secondary institution relative to enrolment across Canada, earning numerous grades in the \"A to B Range\" in categories such as quality of teaching and learning, career preparation, student satisfaction and information technology. Published in \"Maclean's\" magazine, the \"National Survey of Student Engagement\" also listed KPU among the top Canadian institutions relative to student participation, educational practices, and quality of education.\n\nKwantlen College was formed in 1981 by separation from Douglas College. There were more than 200 suggestions in a contest to name the new South Fraser region college. The winning entry \"Kwantlen\" was submitted by Stan McKinnon. \"Kwantlen\" comes from the name of the Kwantlen First Nation in whose traditional territory the university is located. Chief Joe Gabriel of the Kwantlen First Nation gave permission for the college to use the Kwantlen name.\n\nFollowing a provincial government initiative designed to increase access to degree programs in British Columbia that begun in 1988, five community colleges were granted authority to offer baccalaureate degrees. These five institutions— Cariboo, Fraser Valley, Kwantlen, Malaspina, and Okanagan—were renamed university colleges. Initially, they offered degrees under the aegis of one or more of the three provincial universities. In 1995, they were awarded the authority to offer degrees in their own right.\n\nIn 2005, Kwantlen University College began a campaign to convince elected officials at the municipal and provincial levels, and various key community leaders, to support its efforts to become a university. Removing \"college\" from its official name would require approval from the government of British Columbia. In its case for the university status, Kwantlen's administrators claimed the change to Kwantlen University would:\n\n\nIn 2007, Murray Coell, Minister of Advanced Education and Minister responsible for Research and Technology was joined by special advisor Geoff Plant, to release the Campus 2020 report that recommends Kwantlen University College become Kwantlen University.\n\nOn April 22, 2008, British Columbia Premier Gordon Campbell announced that Kwantlen would become Kwantlen Polytechnic University. \nOn April 22, 2008, the provincial government announced its intention to amend the \"University Act\" to make Kwantlen a polytechnic university, in recognition of its \"versatility in providing academic, trades and horticultural training.\" The legislation renaming the University College to University received royal assent on May 29, 2008.\n\nOn October 24, 2008, KPU became a member of the Association of Universities and Colleges of Canada (AUCC).\n\nAlthough the AUCC is not an official government accreditation body, its standardized membership benchmarks and requirements for members serves to ease a student's ability to transfer from undergraduate to graduate programs across Canada and the world.\n\nKPU campuses are all in British Columbia's Lower Mainland. They are located in:\n\nNote: Wikipedia Commons has a gallery of KPU's campuses - .\n\nKPU Tech, formerly known as KPU Cloverdale is the second newest of the five KPU campuses, opening in April 2007. The new Cloverdale campus replaced the aging Newton campus facilities which had served as the home for trades training since Kwantlen's inception. The new Cloverdale building is certified as an LEED Gold building and houses KPU's Trades & Technology programs, which include appliance servicing, automotive servicing, carpentry, farriery, masonry, parts and warehousing, welding, plumbing, public safety communications and CADD technologies.\n\nThe Langley campus is home to the university’s School of Horticulture - which includes a field lab, greenhouses, and gardens. The Langley campus is also home to KPU's music programs and includes performance spaces and an auditorium. KPU Langley also offers science programs, and has biology, brewing, chemistry, physics, and geology labs with industry-standard equipment.\n\nKPU Richmond was KPU’s first official campus, established in 1981 when the institution split from Douglas College. In 2018, the campus underwent major renovations with the addition of the Chip & Shannon Wilson School of Design. The campus is currently home to KPU's Fashion and Design programs, as well as many art and business courses, among others. In January 2018, the new Wilson School of Design facility officially opened its doors beside the KPU Richmond campus. This includes teaching studios and labs, gallery space and 3D printers.\n\nKPU Surrey, often called the main campus, is the largest of the five campuses and offers a range of courses across multiple faculties. It is the primary location for the university’s School of Business and Office of the President. All KPU Sport + Recreation operate out of Surrey, where the university’s gymnasium and fitness centre, along with many recreational facilities, are located.\n\nKPU Civic Plaza, the newest and smallest campus at KPU, opened in Spring 2019 in 3 Civic Plaza, a new skyscraper in the city centre. The campus occupies 5 of the lower floors of the building. It was designed to focus towards post-baccalaureate education for mature students as well as business education. The campus was expected to open in early 2016, but was consistently delayed due to construction issues with the skyscraper.\n\nKPU has over 120 different programs across seven distinct faculties — Academic and Career Advancement, Arts, Business, Design, Health, Science and Horticulture, and Trades and Technology — where students can pursue a degree, diploma, certificate, citation, or work towards completing an apprenticeship.\n\nKPU operates two farms that offer \"Farm School\" training as a non-credit continuing education program. \nThese schools, located in Richmond and Tsawwassen, teach students applied sustainable farming practices and include a farm incubator program for alumni.\n\nKPU has a library on all of its campuses, with the exception of Civic Centre. The largest library is on the Surrey campus with smaller program focused collections available in Richmond, Langley, and Cloverdale. KPU students and faculty have access to millions of items through the library, including online journal and newspaper articles, print and ebooks, streaming media and more. Items from other parts of Canada and around the globe can also be accessed through the library's free interlibrary loans service.\n\nKPU has an enrolment of more than 20,000 students annually and over 12,000 FTE (full-time equivalency) students annually. KPU's region (Richmond, Delta, Surrey, White Rock and Langley) has a population of over 800,000.\n\nAs of Fall 2016, Faculty and staff employees number over 1,400. While some faculty are also involved in research, their primary role is undergraduate education. KPU was named a BC Top 50 employer for the tenth consecutive year in 2017.\n\nKPU offers cooperative education in several degree programs including Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Business Administration, Bachelor of Technology as well as diploma programs. Such programs include dedicated work-placement semesters that match their field of study, in addition to regular studies.\n\nKPU offers many transferable courses to other educational institutions, which often lead to direct transfers into second-year or third-year studies at other post secondary institutions. To aid in this, KPU is a part of the BC Transfer Guide Website, an online resource for planning and understanding transfer in the BC post-secondary education system.\n\nAdditional major and minor programs and specialized courses are currently under development. KPU will be the first public, post-secondary institution in British Columbia to offer studies in Traditional Chinese Medicine. KPU's Faculty of Arts has also launched two new program offerings; a minor in language and culture, and a major in applied geography. In 2016, KPU launched an introductory bhangra course. Continuing and Professional Studies launched an online cannabis career training course.\n\nAs of 2017, KPU launched a minor in Medicinal Chemistry and a minor in Aboriginal Community Justice. School of Business launched three post-baccalaureate programs in Technical Management and Services, Operations Supply Chain Management, and Accounting.\n\nStarting in September 2018, KPU will open a new Mechatronics and Advanced Manufacturing Technology Diploma program.\n\nKPU was previously a member of the Pacific Western Athletic Association (or PacWest) which is affiliated with the Canadian Collegiate Athletic Association. The University had six varsity teams competing in four sports (Men's & Women's Soccer, Men's & Women's Basketball, Badminton, and Golf).\n\nThe Athletic teams, known as the Kwantlen Eagles, were supported by \"Kwinten\" - the University's mascot.\n\nKPU Athletics has had notable results in the following sports:<br>\nWomen's Soccer - 2009 & 2010 PacWest Provincial Champions, 2009 CCAA National Bronze medalists<br>\nBadminton - 2010 National Women's Doubles Bronze, 2011 National Mixed Doubles Gold, 2012 National Men's Doubles Bronze, 2013 National Men's Doubles Silver.\n\nThe Eagles athletics program ceased operations after the 2015-6 academic year.\n\nKPU Sport + Rec proudly offers fitness centres and studios on all KPU campuses. Free membership to fitness centre is available to all current students, employees, and alumni.\n\nTournaments, sports leagues, intramurals along with various Lunch & Lawn activities are available through KPU Sport + Rec.\n\nThe Kwantlen Student Association (KSA) is an elected student body that contributes to community life, and allocates student funds to social, cultural and entertainment programs for students. The KSA was founded as the Kwantlen College Student Society under the Society Act of British Columbia in August 1981.\n\nSince the early 1980s the KSA has also been affiliated with the Canadian Federation of Students as one of its founding members. For a brief period of time in the late 1990s, the KSA was the only Student Association in Canada to have held membership within both the Canadian Federation of Students and the Canadian Alliance of Student Associations at the same time. In March 2008, the Kwantlen Student Association (KSA) organized a referendum to disaffiliate from the CFS. One of the reasons given for disaffiliation was media coverage in 2007, alleging corruption within the Douglas Students' Union of the CFS. The KSA also criticized the financial transparency of CFS-BC and argued that the CFS was ineffective at lobbying for students. As of January 2013, the KSA has been attempting to de-federate from the CFS and has joined the \"Alliance of BC Students\" as an alternative lobbying body.\n\nAt a Special General Meeting held on November 30, 2011 Kwantlen students voted 352 to 0 to remove thirteen directors of the KSA and place them into \"bad standing\" where they would be unable to run for future office. The vote was held over allegations of conflicts of interest in settling litigation, association with the embezzlement of two million dollars of student funds, and a 40% pay raise to the elected officials on their first day of office among other things.\n\nThe highest authority within the Kwantlen Student Association lies with the membership (who are the students of Kwantlen Polytechnic University). Membership is mandatory. The membership delegates its authority over the day-to-day operations of the society to an elected Board of Directors (Council), which is bound to operate under a Constitution and a set of Bylaws.\n\nEach year in February KPU students may run for and elect a Council to a one-year term of office that spans April 1 to March 31. The Council is responsible for, and exercises full control over the affairs of the Society while the executive members assist with the management of the day-to-day operations of the society. The Council holds regularly scheduled meetings at least twice each month, excluding the months of July, August and December.\n\nThe KSA operates a cafe, a fitness centre and a social justice centre on campus. It employs an ombudsperson, distributes day planners, and provides advocacy services as well as funding for campus clubs, events, conferences, and political special interest groups. Through the KSA, students and other members of the Kwantlen community are also eligible for special discounts including bus and train passes, discount movie tickets, and other seasonal offers. Finally, full-time students who do not have comparable coverage elsewhere, are automatically eligible to receive benefits from a health and dental plan.\n\nThe organization's main office is located at the Surrey Campus of Kwantlen Polytechnic University. The society also has offices and provides services at KPU's three other campuses in Cloverdale, Langley and Richmond. The KSA does not own a student union building.\n\nThe Runner is the institution's independent student newspaper. It is a member of the Canadian University Press. Since early 2009, The Runner has added to Kwantlen student life by providing the community with \"\"a freely distributed, year-round, multi-campus, student-owned, student-run news and campus culture publication\"\".\n\nIt receives some of its funds from the Kwantlen Student Association under a levy; however, it is run as separate, autonomous incorporated B.C. non-profit society, Polytechnic Ink Publishing Society (PIPS), with its own Kwantlen student board of directors.\n\n\n"}

S.Y.S.T.E.M.. She co-hosted \"The RuPaul Show\" from 1996 to 1998, alongside frequent collaborator RuPaul. After working as a radio DJ across the country from 1996 to 2011, she returned to television in 2011 on the American reality competition series \"RuPaul's Drag Race\", where she has served as a permanent judge since the show's third season. She has also served as a judge on each season of its spin-off series, \"RuPaul's Drag Race All Stars\" and \"RuPaul's Drag Race UK\".\n\nShe served as a judge on the first two seasons of \"Ireland's Got Talent\" from 2018 to 2019, as a contestant on the fifteenth series of \"Celebrity Big Brother\", and participated in series 17 of \"Strictly Come Dancing\" in the UK on the BBC.\n\nOn stage, Visage made her West End debut in \"Everybody's Talking About Jamie\" in 2018. Her first book, \"The Diva Rules\", was published in 2015.\n\nIn 2019, she received her first Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Competition Program, after becoming an executive producer of \"Drag Race\" starting from its eleventh season.\n\nVisage grew up in New Jersey, was adopted and was aware of this from an early age. She attended an arts high school in South Plainfield, New Jersey, graduating in 1986. She then moved to New York and attended the American Musical and Dramatic Academy in Manhattan for two years. When Visage was 16 she won a Madonna look-alike competition. Growing up, Visage looked up to Madonna, Belinda Carlisle, Pat Benatar, Stevie Nicks, Cyndi Lauper and Dale Bozzio. Visage's mother died when she was 30. Shortly after finishing her studies she stayed in New York City to pursue a career as an actress. \n\nIn New York she was active in the club scene and her mother, Arlene, even gave her a fake ID so she could make connections to help further her career. Visage became prominent in the New York ball scene and learned voguing from various people including Willi Ninja. She also became involved with Cesar Valentino and the pair appeared voguing together on the television show \"The Latin Connection\" in 1988, which they said was the first time voguing had appeared on national TV.\n\nMichelle adopted her surname, Visage, after gaining the nickname \"\"cara\"\" ('face' in Spanish) from the people she spent time with in the New York ball scene. However, because people pronounced it incorrectly she decided to change it to \"\"visage\"\" ('face' in French), a name she has stuck with. Visage also met her future friend and co-star RuPaul for the first time in the late 1980s, when she attended club nights and parties hosted by Susanne Bartsch. In 1989, Visage performed at \"The Love Ball\", which was organised by Bartsch as a benefit for the Design Industries Foundation For AIDS. It is said that The Love Ball is where Madonna first witnessed voguing, the inspiration for her song \"Vogue\". However, participating in New York night life was not Visage's sole occupation and during the day she worked as a receptionist at the shop Casablanca and Fundamental Things in the New York garment district.\n\nVisage auditioned and won a place for Seduction, an R&B and dance vocal trio assembled by Robert Clivilles and David Cole that signed with A&M Records in 1990. The group had several hits, the most famous being \"Two to Make It Right\". After the group's breakup, Visage collaborated with the freestyle dance act TKA as a guest vocalist on the song \"Crash (Have Some Fun)\". Visage provided lead vocals and was the recording artist of another dance act assembled by Clivilles and Cole, The S.O.U.L. S.Y.S.T.E.M. The song \"It's Gonna Be a Lovely Day\", which was a cover version of the Bill Withers song \"Lovely Day\", was included on the soundtrack to \"The Bodyguard\". \"It's Gonna Be a Lovely Day\" became a No. 1 dance single and peaked at No. 34 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 in January 1993.\n\nVisage has also been featured on several of RuPaul's music albums, and appears in the music videos for \"New York City Beat\" and \"From Your Heart\", which originally premiered on \"RuPaul's Green Screen Christmas Special\" (2015), and were later uploaded to World of Wonder's YouTube channel. Visage has also made guest appearances in the videos for RuPaul's songs \"Glamazon\", \"Responsitrannity\", \"The Beginning\" and \"Nothing for Christmas\".\n\nVisage was the co-host of \"The Jamz Session\" on Hot 92 Jamz (KHHT) in Los Angeles between 2002 and 2005.\n\nIn 2005, Visage returned to New York City, where she served as co-host of \"The Morning Mix\" on WNEW-FM until December 2006. She also hosted on Sirius Satellite Radio's The Beat 66 from 2003 to 2006 On March 12, 2007, she became a co-host of the morning show on SUNNY 104.3 in West Palm Beach, Florida. On January 10, 2011, she joined 93.9 MIA in Miami as the host of the new \"MIA Morning Show\". She left Miami and MIA in December 2011, moving back to Los Angeles.\n\nVisage started co-hosting the weekly podcast \"\" on April 9, 2014. The pair interview celebrities and discuss many topics ranging from their personal lives to \"RuPaul's Drag Race\". The podcast won a 2018 Webby Award.\n\nVisage has worked with RuPaul on a variety of television shows throughout her career. In 1996, she became the co-host of RuPaul's VH1 talk show \"The RuPaul Show\". She also co-hosted WKTU's morning show with RuPaul from 1996 to 2002. And when Ru began casting judges for season one of \"RuPaul's Drag Race\" he invited Visage to become a permanent member of the show. At the time she was on a five-year contract with a CBS radio station in West Palm Beach and after asking her boss if she could join the show he said no, which Visage put down to the show's links with the LGBT community. \n\nTwo years later Visage was contacted by RuPaul again and invited to appear on season three of the show. After her boss once again said she was not able to appear, she was persuaded by her friend Leah Remini to contact CBS officials who allowed her to join the show as a judge. So on January 24, 2011, Visage debuted as a permanent judge, along with Santino Rice and Billy B, on season three of \"RuPaul's Drag Race\", replacing Merle Ginsberg. She has also appeared on all four seasons of the spin-off show, \"RuPaul's Drag Race: All-Stars\", and \"RuPaul's Drag Race UK\", which began airing on BBC Three in 2019.\n\nOn January 7, 2015, Visage became one of the contestants on the fifteenth series of the British reality series, \"Celebrity Big Brother\" on Channel 5.

On May 13, 2017, she and Ross Mathews were the commentators for Logo TV's coverage of the Live Grand Final of the Eurovision Song Contest. And most recently she has appeared as a judge on the first two seasons of \"Ireland's Got Talent\", the first of which began airing on TV3 in February 2018.\n\nOn August 5, 2019, it was announced that Visage would be taking part in the seventeenth series of \"Strictly Come Dancing\" in the UK on the BBC. On September 7, it was confirmed that she was partnered with Giovanni Pernice.\n\nVisage performed in her West End debut as \"Miss Hedge\" in \"Everybody's Talking About Jamie\" between October 18, 2018 and January 26, 2019.\n\nIn her early years, Visage suffered from an eating disorder which she says began when she was around 13 years old and continued into her adult life. On Episode 214 of \"What's the Tee?\", her podcast with Ru Paul, Visage says that as an adult, she has had sex with both men and women. \"I've been with women; I've had sex with women,\" she says. \"All of it. All of it. Hands, items...not food, no. I don't do the food thing. ... But I realized I never wanted to have a relationship...it was just sexual for me, 'cause women know what women want—so I understand it—but...or there'd be a man involved, but it was never...I never had a relationship, um, never been offered one, to be honest … so I've never been tempted to be solely \"that\", but I think women are very sexy and sensual and beautiful, so I can still look at a woman and say, 'She's hot.'\"\n\nShe now lives in California with her husband, David Case, and her two daughters, Lillie and Lola. On November 10, 2015, she published her first book, \"The Diva Rules\". In late 2019, the book was released in Swedish through the rainbow company Tallbergs Förlag.\n\nIn April 2019, Visage revealed she had Hashimoto's disease, which led to getting her trademark breast implants removed. \n\n"}

It is considered to be one of the earliest Mughal tombs still in existence, and is considered to be one of the most significant buildings of the early Mughal period. The building is currently used as the Punjab Archives, and public access is limited.\n\nConstruction of the tomb dates to either 1599 C.E., or 1615 C.E.\n\nThe tomb was said to be built by the Mughal Emperor Jehangir for his love Anarkali, as per legend, was caught by Emperor Akbar for exchanging glances with Jehangir, at the time known as Prince Saleem. Anarkali was reportedly a concubine of Emperor Akbar, and this action reportedly enraged the Emperor Akbar so much, that he had Anarkali interred alive in a wall. When Prince Saleem ascended the throne and took the name \"Jehangir,\" he is reported to have ordered the construction of a tomb over the site of the wall in which Anarkali was reportedly buried.\n\nEighteenth-century historian Abdullah Chagatai reported that the tomb was not the resting place for Anarkali, but instead for Jehangir's beloved wife Sahib-i-Jamal Begum. Many modern historians accept the credulity of this account. The building is currently used as the Punjab Archives, so access to the public is limited.\n\nDuring the time of the Sikh Empire, the tomb was occupied by Kharak Singh, and later was further desecrated by its conversion into the residence for the wife of General Jean-Baptiste Ventura, who was employed in the army of Ranjit Singh. The tomb was then converted during the British Raj into clerical offices in 1847 before repurposing the tomb into the Anglican St. James Church in 1851, and later regarded as Lahore's \"Protestant Cathedral.\" In 1891, the church congregation was relocated, and the tomb was repurposed as the Punjab Record Office.\n\nThe occupant's cenotaph was removed when the tomb was repurposed into a church. When the building no longer served as a church, the cenotaph was placed at the site of the former altar, and not at the original site of the cenotaph.\n\nThe structure's foundation are in the basic shape of an octagon, with alternating measurements of 44 feet and 30 feet for each side with semi-octagonal towers at each corner. The structure is also topped by a double-dome, and is one of the earlier examples of such a dome from the Mughal era. The dome rests upon 8 arches, each measuring 12 feet 3 inches.\n\nThe large arches in the sides of the building were once open in typical Mughal fashion, but were blocked off by the British.\n\nThe building is today covered in whitewashing. It was reportedly once surrounded by a garden. The building is currently used as the Punjab Archives, so access to the public is limited.\n\nThe white marble cenotaph features carvings with the 99 names of Allah, and was described by 19th-century historians as \"one of the finest pieces of carving in the world.\"\n\nIn addition to the 99 names of Allah, the cenotaph is inscribed with a Persian couplet written by the Emperor Jehangir which reads: \"Ah! could I behold the face of my beloved once more, I would give thanks unto my God until the day of resurrection.\"\n\nThe tomb is listed on the Protected Heritage Monuments of the Archaeology Department of Punjab.\n"}

It gets its name from the 120-foot hill that occupies its landscape, the name of which dates back to the 18th century. Winter Hill is located roughly north of Medford Street, west of McGrath Highway, and east of Magoun Square.\n\n An early map of the area (dated 1637) from the papers of the family of John Winthrop includes some of this neighborhood and the adjacent Ten Hills section. A Map of the Battle of Bunker Hill from 1775 displays Winter Hill to the northwest, with woody and marshy regions beyond. A map by Henry Pelham published in 1777 includes the Winter Hill Fort as part of the \"Military Works\" in the area. The Winter Hill Fort was described as \"extensive\" among other American Revolutionary War installations, but little evidence of the structural features remains. A \"Plan of the Rebels Works\" in the Library of Congress collection offers a glimpse of the layout. This stronghold is also diagrammed in a map credited to John Montrésor indicating that this was a part of Charlestown at the time.\n\nThe \"Midnight Ride\" of Paul Revere crossed over Winter Hill, and is re-enacted each year as part of the Patriots' Day festivities in the Boston area. \n\nNumerous buildings included in the National Register of Historic Places are found in this neighborhood, including the Adams-Magoun House, the Charles Adams-Woodbury Locke House, the Broadway Winter Hill Congregational Church and the Elisha Hopkins House among others.\n\nAn apartment in the Langmaid Terrace building on Winter Hill at 365 Broadway Avenue was the home of Barack Obama between 1988 and 1991 while he was a student at Harvard Law School.\n\nBy the 21st century Winter Hill featured a mix of restored homes and aging triple deckers, replete with china gnomes and bathtub Virgin Marys. Once known as the home base of Irish gangsters Whitey Bulger, James \"Buddy\" McLean, Howie Winter and the notorious Winter Hill Gang, Winter Hill is now, like much of the rest of Somerville, experiencing gentrification and a resulting rise in property values and rents. Despite these changes, the area continues to hang onto its neighborhood flavor and is home to a large community of Irish and Italian people.\n\nWinter Hill is home to a variety of eateries, Mama Lisa's and Leone's pizza establishments, Sarma, Tipping Cow, the Winter Hill Bakery, and the Winter Hill Brewing Company. A number of new restaurants, cafes, and shops are in the late planning stages. Neighborhood Produce, a small community based grocery store, serves the neighborhood from a location on Medford St., next to the Winter Hill Community School. The Theater Coop, one of the Boston area's few new repertory live theaters, is located between Foss Park and the local supermarket. Near Winter Hill in East Somerville is a community pottery studio, called Mudflat, and a collective of stained glass artists called Daniel Maher Stained Glass. \n\nFoss Park abuts Interstate 93 at the base of Winter Hill. The park has a large, colorful mural painted behind the public swimming pool, and is home to a wide variety of sporting matches, especially soccer. At one time a portion of the Middlesex Canal was located on land that became this park.\n\nAn extension of the Green Line to the Winter Hill area is currently in planning phases, specifically with stations at Medford Street (Gilman Square) and Lowell Street, though estimated completion has been pushed back to 2020. The route of the Green Line Extension has been broadly defined but not finalized.\n\n\n"}

The primary mission of the units on the base is to rebuild and repair ground combat and combat support equipment and to support installations on the East Coast of the United States. Today one of MCLB Albany’s most important facilities is the Marine Corps Logistics Command's Maintenance Center. The only other facility of this kind is located at MCLB Albany’s sister installation, Marine Corps Logistics Base Barstow, California. The base comprises more than and in 2002 employed more than 2,400 civilians along with a complement of 600 Marines. One of the Corps' major commands, Marine Corps Logistics Command, is based at MCLB Albany. The command also encompasses activities at bases in Barstow, California, and Jacksonville, Florida.\n\nThe base was commissioned on March 1, 1952, as the Marine Corps Depot of Supplies. At that time, Marine Brigadier General Raymond P. Coffman assumed command and a small contingent of Marines established headquarters in temporary buildings.\n\nAlbany was chosen as the site for the logistics base after a two-year search in the early 1950s for a level area convenient to the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean and serviced by road and rail. Albany was also attractive for its inland location, well away from the possibility of saltwater corrosion of the stored equipment, and its adequate workforce.\n\nConstruction continued rapidly, and by early 1954, the station was sufficiently complete with warehouses and administration buildings to assume supply support for Marines east of the Rocky Mountains and in the Atlantic area. On July 29, 1954, the command was renamed the Marine Corps Supply Center Albany. The MCSC managed and controlled supplies at storage and issue locations in the eastern half of the United States, the Caribbean Sea and the Mediterranean Sea areas. Depot level rebuild operations began to function at the base in October 1954.\n\nThe base opened in 1954, as the Marine Corps Depot of Supplies. In 1959, renamed the Marine Corps Supply Center, it was assigned the mission of rebuilding nonaviation equipment.\n\nThe MCSC Albany was redesignated Marine Corps Logistics Support Base Atlantic on April 1, 1976, because the Marine Corps Supply Activity at Philadelphia and its inventory control, financial management, procurement and technical support functions were relocated to the Albany installation.\n\nOn November 1, 1978, the installation was renamed once again – Marine Corps Logistics Base Albany. The full spectrum of logistics support functions required to support the Marine Corps ground weapon systems and equipment was now performed at this base.\n\nOn January 17, 1990, the Commandant of the Marine Corps designated the commanding general at MCLB Albany to also take on the responsibilities of commander, Marine Corps Logistics Bases. The reorganization placed control of MCLB Albany, MCLB Barstow, and the Blount Island Command in Jacksonville, Florida, under this single commander.\n\nPreserving the environment and the wildlife in and around the base has been a priority since the early planning phases of the facility. Colonel A.E. Dubber, the officer who chose the Albany site, insisted early on that he wanted no wildlife disturbed unnecessarily and that as many trees as possible should be saved. Because of his policies the base is lined with pecan orchards and rows of oaks. The so-called Dubber Oak, upon which the base was aligned during construction, still stands near the main gate.\n\nIn 1973 more than 200 Indian artifacts were discovered on the base. Arrowheads, flint knives, scrapers, and other ancient tools estimated to be more than 8,000 years old were unearthed by archaeologists. Their presence suggests that the area may have been a trading or supply post for Native Americans.\n\nThe EPA has conducted tests (and continues to monitor) the contamination by hazardous substances on the base of the ground and the drinking water supply. \n\nFrom the beginning of the historic buildup of U.S., Arab and other allied air, ground and naval forces against Iraq during 1990 and 1991 until Operation Desert Storm ended, MCLB Albany and its personnel were deeply involved in the greatest surge of activity in the history of the base. Between August 10, 1990, and March 31, 1991, MCLB Albany provided support to the Marine Air-Ground Task Forces sent to the Persian Gulf area.\n\nDuring the Persian Gulf War (1990–91) the base's workforce shipped more than 9 million pounds of equipment to air and seaports for rapid transport to troops abroad. Personnel also installed twenty-six \"tractor protective kits\" on bulldozers used to break through Iraqi barriers and minefields. The armored bulldozers helped open the way for coalition troops to overrun enemy defenses.\n\nDuring the first phase of activation of Prepositioned War Reserves, MCLB Albany’s Materiel Division (today, MCLB Fleet Support Division and DLA Defense Distribution Depot Albany) shipped more than nine million pounds of goods and equipment on more than 300 semi-trailer trucks to airports and seaports of embarkation to Saudi Arabia. The division’s support continued throughout the crises as its personnel established around the clock operations and worked nearly 50,000 overtime hours packing goods that included 4,800 supplemental items packs and other high priority requisitions for U.S. military personnel.\n\nMCLB Albany also provided medical support throughout the crises. Two doctors, eight medical corpsmen and one independent duty technician from the Naval Branch Medical Clinic at the base deployed to the Persian Gulf. Additionally, the Air Force Medical Logistics team at the base had four air transportable hospitals (ATHs) that were assembled at the base prepositioned in the Persian Gulf area. Two additional ATHs, along with 895,000 pounds of additional medical materials and equipment that were assembled at the base were also sent to the Gulf War area.\n\nThe Publications Branch at the base sent 29,000 publications and technical manuals to reconstitute the Maritime Prepositioned Force in Saudi Arabia. This work continued for nearly a year after the war ended.\n\nThe Maintenance Center performed a myriad of projects and support activities during the war, many of which were innovative and were accomplished in record time. Notable among the Maintenance Center’s support were personnel who developed and installed 26 Tractor Protective Kits on II Marine Expeditionary Force’s bulldozers in the Persian Gulf area. These armor-plated bulldozers broke the paths through Saddam Hussein’s so-called \"Wall of Death\" minefields and other fortified barriers, opening the roads along which the Marine divisions pursued and defeated the Iraqi army.\n\nMore than 100 MCLB Albany Marines, Navy personnel and civilian employees served in Saudi Arabia and the Persian Gulf during Operation Desert Shield and Operation Desert Storm.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2182440", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2182440", "title": "Assumption Cathedral, Bangkok", "text": "Assumption Cathedral, Bangkok\n\nThe Assumption Cathedral () is the principal Roman Catholic church of Thailand, located within the grounds of Assumption College (Thailand) at 23 Oriental Avenue, New Road, in the Bang Rak district of Bangkok. It is the main church of the Archdiocese of Bangkok. It was visited by Pope John Paul II and Pope Francis during their trips to Thailand in 1984 and 2019.\n\nAssumption Cathedral is located within 100 meters of the Oriental Hotel and the French Embassy, and the original building was the result of the request from a French missionary, Father Pascal in 1809 and the work of a French architect which saw the cathedral completed in 1821 during the reign of King Rama II. The cathedral was named Assumption after the Virgin Mary and she is commemorated at the church during The Feast of the Assumption, on St. Mary's Day on 15 August.\n\nThroughout the latter half of the 19th century, the church and surrounding area played an important role for Christian missionaries arriving in Bangkok, particularly after 1860. The cathedral is part of a series of buildings which consist of Assumption Convent School (Thailand), Catholic Mission of Bangkok, Assumption Printing Press and rectory which were inhabited by the missionaries during their time in the city.\n\nHowever around 1909 or 1910 the church underwent significant reconstruction and was rebuilt in the romanesque style between 1910 and 1918. The church has a relatively tall rectangular structure with a red brick exterior which stands out against its surrounding white buildings. The tall square towers flank the main entrance. Inside is a high ceiling adorned with many ornate decorations. Construction costs were largely covered by a local catholic businessman, Mr Low Khiok Chiang (also known as Jacobe) who owned the nearby Kiam Hoa Heng & Company, a Chinese Teochew family business.\n\nIn 1942, during World War II, nearby buildings were destroyed by bombing which resulted in serious damage to the church. It underwent extensive restoration shortly afterwards, and was partly refurbished in the 1980s and 1990s. Stained glass windows are now used in the cathedral today.\n\nAssumption Cathedral had been visited by two supreme pontiffs. First, in May 1984 the cathedral welcomed Pope John Paul II and on the 22nd of November 2019, Pope Francis visited the cathedral during his apostolic visit to Thailand where he conduct the holy mass with catholic youth from around the country, given that the church is the center of the Roman Catholic diocese there. \n\nThe church is open seven days a week. Services for mass on Sundays are held at 6am, 7:30am, 8:30am, 10am and 5pm.\n\nThe significant part of the Cathedral is in the crypt underneath the Sanctuary which kept the remains of the bishops and the missionaries including that of Fr Nicholas Boonkerd Kitbamrung who was proclaimed a martyr by Pope John Paul II on 5 March 2000 in Vatican. His relics were transferred to the shrine built in the compound of St. Peter’s church in Sampran, Nakornprathom Province. There still remains a special altar devoted to him on the left side of the Cathedral.\n\nBesides being a place of worship and for performing sacred ceremonies, the role of the Assumption Cathedral is the church of the head of the local diocese which was led by Cardinal Michael Meechai Kitboonchu. The Cathedral is used to celebrate functions such as ordination of deacons, priests and bishops, and is said to be the centre of Catholics in Thailand.\n\nVisitors include, on 4 May 1946, King Ananda Mahidol with his younger brother, then-Prince Bhumibol Adulyadej. Pope John Paul II visited on 10 May 1984. On 22 July 1995, Princesses Soamsawali and Bajirakitiyabha visited the Cathedral during a religious ceremony for the soul of the late King’s mother. In 2002 the Crown Prince Vajiralongkorn and his consort Srirasmi visited the Catholic community at the Assumption Cathedral.\n\nThree schools are situated in the compound of the Cathedral: The Assumption College, the Assumption Convent and the Assumption Suksa. There used to be a seminary and a printing house. Many offices of the Catholic organizations used to be nearby the Cathedral.\n\nA ceremony held in the cathedral was that of the proclamation of Blessed Father Nicholas Boonkerd as Priest and Martyr. \n\n\n"}

The reservoir which flooded a part of the valley of the River Rheidol and its headwaters derives its name from a stream, the Nant-y-moch (in English = \"the pigs stream,\"), which formerly flowed into the River Rheidol at this spot. The dam is about three miles north of the village of Ponterwyd. The reservoir forms part of the Cwm Rheidol hydroelectric power scheme and the headwaters of the reservoir include the source of the River Rheidol. The Nant-y-moch component of the hydroelectric scheme has an installed capacity of 13 MW generated as the water from Nant-y-moch enters Dinas Reservoir\n\nNant-y-moch Reservoir was created in 1964. The construction of the dam flooded the valley north of it, which included the hamlet of Nant-y-moch. The contents of the graveyard which was to be submerged were relocated to the chapel at Ponterwyd, and a number of cairns were painstakingly moved, some of which dated back as far as the Iron Age.\n\n"}
{"id": "2182450", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2182450", "title": "Clovis III", "text": "Clovis III\n\nClovis III was the Frankish king of Austrasia in 675 and possibly into 676. A member of the Merovingian dynasty, he was a child and his reign so brief and contested that he may be considered only a pretender. He is sometimes even left unnumbered and Clovis IV is instead called Clovis III. The only source for his reign is the contemporary \"Suffering of Leudegar\".\n\nFollowing the assassination of Childeric II in 675, the kingdoms of Austrasia and Neustria accepted different claimants. In Neustria, under the influence of Leudegar, bishop of Autun, Childeric's younger brother Theuderic III was installed as king. In Austrasia, Ebroin, the former mayor of the palace, installed Clovis III with support of a faction of the magnates opposed to the mayoralty of Wulfoald.\n\nEbroin and his allies claimed that Clovis was a son of Chlothar III, Childeric's older brother. The \"Suffering of Leudegar\" claims that this was a lie, although there is nothing implausible in it, since Chlothar was about twenty-three years old when he died. Nor is the naming of Clovis unusual, since firstborn sons in the Merovingian dynasty were often named after their grandfathers, and Chlothar's father was Clovis II. When Theuderic III had a son in 677, however, he named him Clovis (the future Clovis IV) and this may be taken as evidence that the \"Suffering\" is correct and his brother never had a son of that name.\n\nEbroin needed a legitimate Merovingian in order to raise an army and to issue legally binding orders (\"praecepta\"). (A generation later, the same requirement forced Charles Martel to find a Merovingian pretender, Chlothar IV, in 717.) Once raised, Ebroin marched the army into the northwest of the kingdom and seized the royal treasury in the fall of 675. Once he had secured control of the treasury, he no longer needed Clovis and he abandoned him, declaring himself for Theuderic III. Those Austrasians opposed to Ebroin and to union with Neustria, however, did not recognise Theuderic, and instead enthroned Dagobert II sometime between 2 April and 30 June 676.\n\nThere are some coins that have been attributed to the short reign of Clovis III. This attribution, first suggested by Jean Lafaurie in 1956, has been accepted by Egon Felder and Philip Grierson. A gold tremissis bearing the name and the name of the moneyer, Eborino, probably belongs to him. Although it was possibly minted under Clovis IV, there is no evidence for the continuation of gold coinage in the Frankish kingdoms past the 670s. Likewise, late gold tremisses of Marseille bearing the name of Clovis probably belong to Clovis III. Stylistically, these have much in common with the coinage of Dagobert II, bearing the cross-on-steps motif on the reverse in imitation of Byzantine coinage.\n\nOf the ultimate fate of Clovis III nothing is known.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2182477", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2182477", "title": "UEFA Euro 2012", "text": "UEFA Euro 2012\n\nThe 2012 UEFA European Football Championship, commonly referred to as UEFA Euro 2012 or simply Euro 2012, was the 14th European Championship for men's national football teams organised by UEFA. The final tournament, held between 8 June and 1 July 2012, was co-hosted for the first time by Poland and Ukraine, and was won by Spain, who beat Italy 4–0 in the final at the Olympic Stadium, Kiev, Ukraine.\n\nPoland and Ukraine's bid was chosen by UEFA's Executive Committee on 18 April 2007. The two host teams qualified automatically while the remaining 14 finalists were decided through a qualifying competition, featuring 51 teams, from August 2010 to November 2011. This was the last European Championship to employ the 16-team finals format in use since 1996; from Euro 2016 onward, it was expanded to 24 finalists.\n\nEuro 2012 was played at eight venues, four in each host country. Five new stadiums were built for the tournament, and the hosts invested heavily in improving infrastructure such as railways and roads at UEFA's request. Euro 2012 set attendance records for the 16-team format, for the highest aggregate attendance (1,440,896) and average per game (46,481).\n\nSpain became the first team to win two consecutive European Championships, and also three straight major tournaments (Euro 2008, 2010 World Cup and Euro 2012). Spain had already gained entry to the 2013 Confederations Cup by winning the World Cup, so runners-up Italy qualified instead. As at Euro 2008 in Austria and Switzerland, both 2012 host nations were eliminated in the group stage.\n\nThe hosting of the event was initially contested by five bids representing seven countries: Croatia–Hungary, Greece, Italy, Poland–Ukraine, and Turkey. In November 2005, after an initial consideration of the bid data by UEFA, both the Greek and Turkish bids were eliminated from the process, to leave three candidates.\n\nIn May 2006, this was followed by a second round of the selection process, which included visits by UEFA to all candidates. The final decision was due to be announced on 8 December 2006 in Nyon, but this was postponed to \"give bidding associations more time for the fine-tuning of their bids\". On 18 April 2007, the Poland–Ukraine bid was chosen by a vote of the UEFA Executive Committee, at a meeting in Cardiff.\n\nPoland–Ukraine became the third successful joint bid for the European Championship, after those of Belgium–Netherlands (2000) and Austria–Switzerland (2008). Their bid received an absolute majority of votes, and was therefore announced the winner, without requiring a second round. Italy, which received the remaining votes, had been considered favourites to win the hosting, but incidents of fan violence and a match-fixing scandal were widely cited as factors behind their failure.\n\nThere were some later alterations from the initial bid plan, regarding the venues, before UEFA confirmed the eight host cities in 2009. During the preparation process in Poland and Ukraine, UEFA repeatedly expressed concern about their preparation to host the event, with different candidates reported as being alternative hosts if they did not improve; however, in the end, UEFA affirmed their selection.\n\nThe draw for the UEFA Euro 2012 qualifying competition took place in Warsaw on 7 February 2010. Fifty-one teams entered to compete for the fourteen remaining places in the finals, alongside co-hosts Poland and Ukraine. The teams were divided into nine groups, with the draw using the new UEFA national team coefficient for the first time in order to determine the seedings. As defending champions, Spain was automatically top seeded. The qualifying process began in August 2010 and concluded in November 2011. At the conclusion of the qualifying group stage in October 2011, the nine group winners qualified automatically, along with the highest ranked second placed team. The remaining eight-second placed teams contested two-legged play-offs, and the four winners qualified for the finals.\n\nTwelve of the sixteen finalists participated at the previous tournament in 2008. England and Denmark made their return to the Euro, having last participated in 2004, while Republic of Ireland returned after a twenty-four-year absence to make their second appearance at a European Championship. One of the co-hosts, Ukraine, made their debut as an independent nation (before 1992 Ukraine participated as part of the Soviet Union). With the exception of Serbia – according to UEFA's ranking at the end of the qualifying stage – Europe's sixteen highest-ranked teams all qualified for the tournament.\n\nThe following sixteen teams qualified for the finals:\n\nThe draw for the final tournament took place on 2 December 2011 at the Ukraine Palace of Arts in Kiev, Ukraine. The hour-long ceremony was hosted by Olha Freimut and Piotr Sobczyński, television presenters from the two host countries.\n\nAs was the case for the 2004 and 2008 finals, the sixteen finalists were divided into four seeding pots, using the UEFA national team coefficient ranking. The pot allocations were based on the UEFA national team coefficient rankings of the sixteen finalists at the end of the qualifying competition in November 2011. Each nation's coefficient was generated by calculating:\n\nAside from the coefficient, three teams were automatically placed in Pot 1. Ukraine and Poland were both assigned to Pot 1 as the two host nations, despite the fact that their rankings were the two lowest in the tournament; this also occurred in 2008 when the co-hosts Switzerland and Austria were also ranked below all other qualified teams. As defending champions, Spain were also automatically assigned to Pot 1, though their UEFA ranking at the time of the draw was coincidentally also the best.\n\nIn the draw procedure, one team from each pot was drawn into each of the four groups. The draw also determined which place in the group teams in pots 2–4 would take (e.g. A2, A3 or A4) to create the match schedule. With Poland automatically assigned in advance to A1, and Ukraine to D1, Pot 1 only had two teams as Spain and the Netherlands were to be drawn into position one in either group B or C. The balls were drawn by four former players who had each been part of European Championship winning teams: Horst Hrubesch, Marco van Basten, Peter Schmeichel and Zinedine Zidane.\n\nTeams were drawn consecutively into Group A to D. First, the Pot 1 teams were assigned to the first positions of their groups, while next the positions of all other teams were drawn separately from Pot 4 to 2 (for the purposes of determining the match schedules in each group).\n\nThe draw resulted in the following groups:\n\nEight cities were selected by UEFA as host venues. In a return to the format used at Euro 1992, Euro 1996 and Euro 2008, each of the four groups' matches were played in two stadiums. Host cities Warsaw, Gdańsk, Wrocław, Poznań, Kiev, and Lviv are all popular tourist destinations, unlike Donetsk and Kharkiv, the latter of which replaced Dnipropetrovsk as a host city in 2009.\n\nIn order to meet UEFA's requirement for football infrastructure improvements, five new stadiums were built and opened in advance of the tournament. The remaining three stadiums (in Kiev, Poznań and Kharkiv) underwent major renovations in order to meet UEFA's infrastructure standards. Three of the stadiums are categorised as UEFA's highest category stadiums. The transport infrastructure in Poland and Ukraine was also extensively modified on the request of UEFA to cope with the large influx of football fans.\n\nUEFA organised fan zones in the eight host cities. They were located in the centre of each city, with all 31 matches shown live on a total of 24 giant screens. The zones enabled supporters to come together in a secure and controlled environment. The Warsaw Fan Zone occupied 120,000 square meters and accommodated 100,000 visitors. In all, the fans zones had a 20% increase in capacity compared to Euro 2008.\n\nA total of 31 matches were played during Euro 2012, with Ukraine hosting 16 of them and Poland 15.\n\nTickets for the venues were sold directly by UEFA via its website, or distributed by the football associations of the 16 finalists. Applications had to be made during March 2011 for the 1.4 million tickets available for the 31 tournament matches. Over 20,000 were forecast to cross the Poland–Ukraine border each day during the tournament. Over 12 million applications were received, which represented a 17% increase on the 2008 finals, and an all-time record for the UEFA European Championship. Owing to this over-subscription for the matches, lotteries were carried out to allocate tickets. Prices varied from €30 (£25) (for a seat behind the goals at a group match) to €600 (£513) (for a seat in the main stand at the final). In addition to individual match tickets, fans could buy packages to see either all matches played by one team, or all matches at one specific venue.\n\nEach team had a \"team base camp\" for its stay between the matches. From an initial list of thirty-eight potential locations (twenty-one in Poland, seventeen in Ukraine), the national associations chose their locations in 2011. The teams trained and resided in these locations throughout the tournament, travelling to games staged away from their bases. Thirteen teams stayed in Poland and three in Ukraine.\n\nThe Adidas Tango 12 was the official match ball of UEFA Euro 2012. The ball is named after the original Adidas Tango family of footballs; however, the Tango 12 and its variations have a completely new design. Variations of the ball have been used in other contemporary competitions including the Africa Cup of Nations and the Summer Olympics. It is designed to be easier to dribble and control than the reportedly unpredictable Adidas Jabulani used at the 2010 FIFA World Cup.\n\nEach national team had to submit a squad of 23 players, three of whom must be goalkeepers, at least ten days before the opening match of the tournament. If a player became injured or ill severely enough to prevent his participation in the tournament before his team's first match, he would be replaced by another player.\n\nOn 20 December 2011, UEFA named twelve referees and four fourth officials for Euro 2012. On 27 March 2012, UEFA issued the full list of 80 referees to be used in Euro 2012, including the assistant referees, the additional assistant referees, and the four reserve assistant referees. Each refereeing team consisted of five match officials from the same country: one main referee, two assistant referees, and two additional assistant referees. All of the main referees, additional assistant referees, and fourth officials were FIFA referees, and the assistant referees (including the four reserve assistant referees) were FIFA assistant referees. For each refereeing team, a third assistant referee from each country was named to remain on standby until the start of the tournament to take the place of a colleague if required. In two cases, for the French and Slovenian refereeing teams, the standby assistant referees took the place of one of the assistant referees before the start of the tournament. Continuing the experiments carried out in the UEFA Champions League and UEFA Europa League, the two additional assistant referees were used on the goal line for the first time in European Championship history with approval from the International Football Association Board.\n\nFour match officials, who served only as fourth officials, and four reserve assistant referees were also named:\n\nUEFA announced the schedule for the 31 matches of the final tournament in October 2010, with the final confirmation of kick-offs times being affirmed following the tournament draw in December 2011.\n\nThe teams finishing in the top two positions in each of the four groups progressed to the quarter-finals, while the bottom two teams were eliminated from the tournament.\n\nIf two or more teams were equal on points on completion of the group matches, the following tie-breaking criteria were applied:\n\nIn the knockout phase, extra time and a penalty shoot-out were used to decide the winner if necessary.\n\nAs with every tournament since UEFA Euro 1984, there was no third place play-off.\n\nThe UEFA Technical Team was charged with naming a squad composed of the 23 best players over the course of the tournament. The group of eleven analysts watched every game at the tournament before making their decision after the final. Ten players from the winning Spanish team were selected in the team of the tournament, while Zlatan Ibrahimović was the only player to be included whose team was knocked out in the group stage.\n\nFernando Torres tied with five other players on goals and with Mario Gómez on goals and assists; however, he played 92 fewer minutes than Gómez did, thus earning the title. Torres also became the first player to score in two finals.\n\n\nA total of €196 million was given to the 16 teams competing in this tournament, an increase from the €184 million in the previous tournament. Each team received an initial €8 million and then received additional money, based on their performances. Spain, the winners of Euro 2012, were awarded a total prize of €23 million for their performance. The maximum prize achievable (for winning all group matches and winning the final) was €23.5 million. Complete list:\nExtra payment based on teams performances:\n\nBesides money, commemorative plaques were given to all participants together with special plaques for semi-final losers and finalists.\nGold and silver medals were awarded to the winners and runners-up, respectively, whereas both semi-final losers were awarded bronze medals. The trophy given to the winners remains in the ownership of UEFA; however, the winning nation, Spain, received a full-size replica.\n\nIn the final tournament, a player was suspended for the subsequent match in the competition for either getting red card or accumulating two yellow cards in two different matches. UEFA's Control and Disciplinary body has the ability to increase the automatic one match ban for a red card (e.g. for violent conduct). Single yellow card cautions were erased at the conclusion of the quarter-finals, and were not carried over to the semi-finals (so that a player could only be suspended for the final by getting a red card in the semi-final). Single yellow cards and suspensions for yellow card accumulations do not carry over to the 2014 FIFA World Cup qualification tournament matches. The following players were suspended during the final tournament – for one or more games – as a result of red cards or yellow card accumulations:\n\nApart from discipline measures for yellow and red cards, UEFA fined the football associations of Croatia, England, Germany, Portugal, Russia, and Spain a total of €417,000 for spectators incidents. Furthermore, the Portuguese association was fined €5,000 for delaying the start of the second half of the game against Germany. In addition to these, Danish striker Nicklas Bendtner was fined €100,000 and given a one match ban (to be applied in the 2014 FIFA World Cup qualification tournament) for revealing his sponsored underpants, violating UEFA regulations, during the celebration of his second goal in the match against Portugal. His fine was later paid by his sponsor.\n\nThe Henri Delaunay Trophy began a journey through the host cities seven weeks before the start of the tournament. A hundred days before the first match a hot air balloon in the shape of the trophy was flown in Nyon, Switzerland and visited 14 cities throughout the host countries, reminding spectators of the impending tournament. On 20 April 2012, the trophy tour started and visited the Polish cities of Warsaw, Wrocław, Gdańsk, Poznań, Kraków, Katowice and Łódź. After the Polish cities, the trophy visited seven Ukrainian cities: Kiev, Ivano-Frankivsk, Kharkiv, Donetsk, Dnipropetrovsk, Lviv, and Odesa.\n\nThe competition slogan, Creating History Together (, literally, \"Together we are creating the future\", , \"Tvorymo istoriyu razom\"), was announced along with the logo. The official logo for the tournament was unveiled at a special event at Mykhailivska Square, Kiev, on 14 December 2009 and was designed by Portuguese group Brandia Central. It took its visual identity from Wycinanki or Vytynanky, a traditional form of paper cutting practised in rural areas of Poland and Ukraine. The art form symbolises the nature of the rural areas of both countries. As part of the event, landmark buildings in the eight host cities were illuminated with the tournament logo.\n\nThe official Euro 2012 song was \"Endless Summer\" by the German singer Oceana. In addition, UEFA retained the melody that was composed by Rollo Armstrong of Faithless on its behalf for the 2008 tournament. The Republic of Ireland also produced an official song: \"The Rocky Road to Poland\", recorded by a collaboration of Irish performers, quickly reached number 1 in Ireland and stayed there for three weeks. In Spain, the broadcasting company Mediaset España commissioned the song \"No hay 2 sin 3\", performed by David Bisbal and Cali & El Dandee and produced by RedOne.\n\nThe tournament was also associated with the song \"Heart of Courage\" by Two Steps From Hell, which was played in the stadiums during the entrance of the players (before the national anthems); and also \"Seven Nation Army\" by The White Stripes, in this case after every goal.\n\nUEFA signed a worldwide licensing agreement with Warner Brothers Consumer Products to help promote the tournament. The agreement involved licensing to third parties for a variety of other merchandising items.\n\nAlso designed by Warner Bros. were the official tournament mascots, \"Slavek and Slavko\", twins that wore the national colours of the two host nations. The mascots were unveiled in December 2010, and named following an online poll.\n\nThe \"UEFA Euro 2012 video game\" was released by EA Sports as a downloadable expansion pack for \"FIFA 12\".\n\nUEFA announced ten global sponsors and, for both Poland and Ukraine, three national sponsors as shown below. These sponsorships together with the broadcasting revenues were estimated to earn UEFA at least US$1.6 billion.\n\nAccording to UEFA requirements, TP ensured approximately 2х70 Gbit/s data communication speed from Polish stadiums and 2х140 Gbit/s between Poland and Ukraine. This was required due to the fact that the matches were broadcast in HD quality. The multilateral production utilised 31 cameras to cover the action on and around the pitch at every match, with additional cameras following activities around the game, such as team arrivals at the stadiums, interviews, and media conferences. The official Euro 2012 broadcasting centre was located at the Expo XXI International Centre in Warsaw. The tournament was broadcast live by around 100 TV channels covering the whole world. 150,000,000 people were expected to watch the matches each day.\n\nAfter Poland and Ukraine were chosen by a vote of the UEFA Executive Committee as host countries for Euro 2012, several issues arose, which jeopardised the Polish/Ukrainian host status.\n\nIn Ukraine there were financial difficulties related to stadium and infrastructure renovation related to the economic crisis. In Poland, issues arose related to corruption within the Polish Football Association. In April 2009 however, the president of UEFA, Michel Platini announced that all was on track and that he saw no major problems. After a UEFA delegation visited Ukraine in September 2011, he stated the country was \"virtually ready for Euro 2012\".\n\nIn the UK, there were allegations of racism in football in both host countries. The main cause of discussion was the BBC current affairs programme \"Panorama\", entitled \"Euro 2012: Stadiums of Hate\", which included recent footage of supporters chanting various antisemitic slogans and displays of white power symbols and banners in Poland, plus Nazi salutes and the beating of South Asians in Ukraine. The documentary was first echoed in much of the British press, but was then attacked for being one-sided and unethical: critics included other British media outlets; anti-racism campaigners, black and Jewish community leaders in Poland; Polish and Ukrainian politicians and journalists; England fans visiting the host nations and Gary Lineker, a British football star.\n\nIn response to Yulia Tymoshenko's hunger strike and her mistreatment in a Ukrainian prison some European politicians and governments announced that they would boycott the matches in Ukraine.\n\nUkraine came under criticism from animal welfare organisations for killing stray cats and dogs in order to prepare for Euro 2012. Ukrainian Ministry of Ecology and Natural Resources and Minister of the Environment promised to take action to prevent killing animals but it still remains unclear how these measures were enforced. The ministry's comments also suggested this would only be a temporary measure, drawing further criticism.\n\nBomb explosions took place in Dnipropetrovsk, Ukraine, on 27 April 2012 and were described as a terrorist attack that may jeopardise the organisation of the tournament in Ukraine.\n\nOther important issues were associated with FEMEN's group protests against prostitution and sex tourism in Ukraine, and enormous increases in hotel prices by many hoteliers in the country.\n\nIn total, four nations were fined by UEFA for racist activities by their fans (none of them were hosts): Germany, Spain, Croatia and Russia.\n\n"}

Tottle asserts that fraudulent \"famine-genocide\" propaganda has been spread by former Nazis, anti-communists and Ukrainian nationalists, sometimes posing as academics in Canadian universities. Tottle's critics regard him as a \"Soviet apologist\", or a \"denunciator\" of the famine. Tottle has been defended by the Stalin Society, author Jeff Coplon, and the Swedish Communist Party, who insist that his book is valid historical research that exposed the \"myth of the famine-genocide ... once and for all\".\n\nTottle was born in Quebec, but later lived mainly in Western Canada. He had various jobs throughout his working life, including photo-lab technician, fine artist, miner, and steelworker. As a trade union activist, he edited \"The Challenger\", a journal of the United Steelworkers, from 1975 to 1985. Tottle also researched labour history and worked as a union organiser, for example among Chicano farm workers in California, and Native Indian farm workers in Manitoba. Tottle has written for various Canadian and US publications.\n\nDouglas Tottle is mostly known for his controversial book \"Fraud, Famine, and Fascism: the Ukrainian Genocide Myth from Hitler to Harvard\", in which he argues that claims that Holodomor was an intentional genocide are \"fraudulent\", and \"a creation of Nazi propagandists\". Tottle argues that the major cause of the famine was the weather conditions, drought especially and suggests that greater blame can actually be placed on kulaks sabotage and hoarding of grain. In addition, Tottle puts significant emphasis into claiming the invalidity of existing photographic evidence.\n\nTottle writes that he is more interested in the \"Nazi and fascist connections\" and the \"coverups of wartime collaboration\" (p. 3). Critics argued that both of these topics, even if objectively treated, are not relevant to the study of the famine and can neither prove nor disprove the existence of the famine or define the nature of the tragedy. Critics also argued that Tottle's attacks on various segments of the Ukrainian diaspora constitute hate literature.\n\nIn his book, \"Searching for place: Ukrainian Displaced Persons, Canada, and the Migration of Memory\", Lubomyr Luciuk comments: \"For a particularly base example of famine-denial literature, see Tottle, \"Fraud, famine, and fascism...\"\".\n\nIn 1988 the International Commission of Inquiry Into the 1932–33 Famine in Ukraine was set up to establish whether the famine existed and its cause. Tottle was invited by the commission to attend the hearings, but did not respond. Tottle's book was examined during the Brussels sitting of the commission, held between May 23–27, 1988, with testimony from various expert witnesses. The commission president Professor Jacob Sundberg subsequently concluded that Tottle was not alone in his enterprise to deny the notion of the \"famine-genocide\" on the basis that material included in his book could not have been available to a private person without official Soviet assistance.\n\nRecent research has shown that Soviet government institutes contributed to its writing and reviewed manuscripts; Soviet diplomats also promoted the book. This may have been a political response specifically to The Harvest of Sorrow, which was published in the preceding year.\n"}

Japanese crucian carp and \"wakasagi\" were introduced to the lake in the Meiji period, and sports fishing is also popular. Lake Kawaguchi is the most popular of the Fuji Five Lakes in terms of tourists, and has the most developed tourist infrastructure. The area also serves as a major hub for those wishing to climb Mount Fuji during the climbing season (July and August), and is also popular with photographers due to the panoramic views of the mountain from the shore.\n\nIn 2013 the lake was added to the World Heritage List as part of the Fujisan Cultural Site.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2182497", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2182497", "title": "Shane Hmiel", "text": "Shane Hmiel\n\nShane Hmiel (born May 15, 1980) is an American former racecar driver, who competed in all three of NASCAR's national series. Hmiel's controversial stock car career, marred by accidents from his aggressive driving style, ended in 2006 after he failed a third substance abuse test and was banned from competing in NASCAR for life. After rebuilding his career in open wheel racing, primarily in United States Auto Club sanctioned dirt track racing, Hmiel was paralyzed in a near fatal racing accident on October 9, 2010 in Terre Haute, Indiana. Prior to the accident, Hmiel had become the first driver to win the Hoosier Hundred, Rich Vogler Classic, and Pat O'Connor Memorial, the three premier USAC midget-car races, in the same season.\n\nShane is the son of Lisa Hmiel and Steve Hmiel, former NASCAR crew chief and later a Competition Director who worked for several teams including Dale Earnhardt, Inc. and Swan Racing. He also has a younger brother, Tyler Hmiel.\n\nAt age 5, Hmiel was misdiagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. He began smoking cannabis at age 12, and on a daily basis through his teens and 20s. Hmiel also admitted to using cocaine \"about 100 times,\" and used drugs in part to medicate himself. After entering drug rehab in 2007, Hmiel's condition was properly diagnosed as Bipolar II disorder.\n\nHmiel began racing in go-karts, winning 164 races from the age of 12 to 15. After quitting racing for three years, he began running late model stock cars.\n\nIn 2001, Hmiel competed in the NASCAR Goody's Dash Series, earning the Rookie of the Year award with two wins and 13 top-10 finishes, finishing fifth in points. Hmiel also ran a single ARCA Re/Max Series race at Atlanta Motor Speedway, finishing second. Hmiel also qualified the No. 48 Chevrolet for Innovative Motorsports in Busch Series, the second-tier national series of NASCAR, at Memphis Motorsports Park, filling in for Kenny Wallace who raced the car.\n\nFor 2002, Hmiel moved to the Busch Series in the No. 47 Chevrolet for Innovative as a teammate to Wallace. Initially planned to run a part-time schedule, sponsorship from Thomas Pacconi Classics, Goulds Pumps, and Mike's Hard Lemonade Co. expanded his schedule to the full season. Hmiel opened his rookie season with a fifth-place finish at Daytona. He earned two poles (at Nashville and Loudon), two top 5s, and eight top 10s to finish 16th in points and third in Rookie of the Year standings behind Scott Riggs and Johnny Sauter.\n\nIn 2003, Hmiel moved into Innovative's No. 48 car. After the first 26 races of the season, he already improved on his rookie season statistics, earning four top 5s and 10 top 10s, and sat 8th in points. Hmiel's best NASCAR effort came at Indianapolis Raceway Park in August 2003, where he won the pole, led the most laps and staged a very competitive battle with eventual series champion Brian Vickers. Vickers took his first career victory, while Hmiel finished fourth. In December 2009, the race was selected by media members as the greatest Nationwide Series race of the decade. Hmiel also attempted to qualify for the Pepsi 400 at Daytona in July in the Winston Cup Series for Petty Enterprises' famed 43 car, with normal driver Christian Fittipaldi driving Petty's 44 car. He did not, however make the race.\n\nAt the Funai 250 at Richmond International Raceway, Hmiel was involved in several on track incidents, beginning on lap 103 when he spun the lapped car of Randy MacDonald. Late in the race with 5 laps to go, Hmiel was involved in an accident with Jason Keller. Hmiel was moved out of line down the backstretch, then slipped up into Keller in turn three, sending Keller's 57 car into the wall driver's side first. Hmiel was fined $5,000 and placed on probation for an altercation in the garage area after the race with Keller. Fellow competitor David Green would later identify this race as a sign of bad times to come for Hmiel.\n\nA week later on September 18, Hmiel was suspended indefinitely for failing a drug test, testing positive for marijuana. According to NASCAR's substance abuse policy, the sanctioning body is allowed to administer drug tests, based only on \"reasonable suspicion\", at their sole discretion. At the time, he was the highest-profile driver to fail such a test. Hmiel was released from Innovative Motorsports, replaced with former Busch Series champion Jeff Green at Dover, then several other veteran drivers for the remainder of the season. He was set to drive the 91 car for Evernham Motorsports that weekend at Dover coming up but the team withdrew after the suspension.\n\nHmiel was reinstated in 2004 after completing NASCAR's Road to Recovery program, and was picked up for the full Craftsman Truck Series season by Billy Ballew Motorsports, with crew chief Ritchie Wauters. Hmiel scored his first and only NASCAR victory at the Las Vegas 350 in September, racing hard with Todd Bodine through lapped traffic, eventually bumping Bodine out of the way coming to the white flag.\n\nHmiel returned to Busch Series competition at the 9th race of the season at Fontana for GIC-Mixon Motorsports, starting and finishing 32nd. After running three more races with GIC, he drove two races for Akins Motorsports' No. 38 Dodge, scoring a fourth-place finish at Milwaukee. In late October, Hmiel was signed to Braun Racing, replacing David Stremme in the TrimSpa X32 Dodge for the remainder of the season beginning at Atlanta Motor Speedway. He had a best finish of 22nd in four starts for Braun. Hmiel also made his Nextel Cup Series debut in September at Fontana in the 23 car for Bill Davis Racing. He ran 5 races for BDR, with a best finish of 24th at Kansas and Atlanta.\n\nFor 2005, Braun formed an alliance with Dale Earnhardt, Inc. and switched to Chevrolet. The team was also joined by new sponsor WinFuel Multivitamins, produced by TripSpa's parent company. Hmiel was in a series of commercials with Dale Earnhardt, Jr. to promote his sponsor's product. In addition to the full Busch Series schedule and a partial truck series schedule with Ballew, Braun and WinFuel fielded a 08 Chevrolet in a partial schedule in the Cup Series for Hmiel, debuting at Atlanta.\n\nDuring the Sharpie 250 at Bristol in April, Hmiel was involved a very heated incident with Cup Series veteran Dale Jarrett after Hmiel spun him out on the front stretch with three laps to go. The two were racing for 12th and 13th place, and Hmiel had bumped and ran the last three drivers he had passed before getting to Jarrett's 90 car. When an angry Jarrett leaned into Hmiel's window to question why Hmiel had spun him out, Hmiel appeared to have no remorse for his driving, then flipped the middle finger toward Jarrett as the latter was walking away. The incident was captured live on Fox Sports' national television broadcast (especially the finger gesture pointed at Jarrett) through Hmiel's in-car camera. Hmiel was fined $10,000 and docked 25 points in the standings for the incident.\n\nAt Charlotte in May 2005, Hmiel was administered another substance test following Busch Series qualifying, after NASCAR officials observed Hmiel making \"erratic moves\" on the racetrack. In June at Dover, it was revealed that he had failed the test, and he was escorted from the garage by NASCAR officials. Hmiel had tested positive for marijuana and cocaine, and was suspended \"indefinitely\" starting in May 2005. Hmiel was offered a chance at reinstatement after his second infraction, under condition that he submit to medical and psychological reviews, and frequent drug testing before reinstatement. In February, 2006, however, Hmiel failed a third and final drug test, and was banned for life from NASCAR. He stated on \"WindTunnel with Dave Despain\" on April 4, 2010, and on several other occasions that his ban was \"the best thing that's happened\" to him. The ban would be partially lifted in 2012 (see below).\n\nDuring his four-year NASCAR career, Hmiel appeared in seven Nextel Cup races, 83 Busch races, and 29 Truck Series races. He had one win: in the Truck Series' Las Vegas 350 in 2004.\n\nHmiel was not paid his 2005 salary for races prior to the suspension, as Braun Racing alleged that Hmiel signed the contract in bad faith due to health concerns, leading Hmiel to sue the team for over $135,000 in earnings and another $135,000 for \"bad faith dealings\" by the team. Under oath, Hmiel admitted that he violated NASCAR's substance abuse policy with a positive test for marijuana in 2003 and a positive test for marijuana and cocaine in 2005. Hmiel denied he was using drugs on a regular basis (at least once a week) in 2005. Hmiel denied that he had tested positive for heroin at any time from 2003 to 2005, and testified that he was not under the influence of any drug at any time while he was racing. The disposition of the lawsuit is unknown.\n\nDuring his stock car career, Hmiel's talent was often eclipsed by his fiery temperament, over-aggressive and impatient driving, and unsportsmanlike conduct, leading to several on-and-off track altercations with other competitors. In a 2011 interview with Fox Sports's Steve Byrnes, Hmiel admitted \"I'll run you over to win the race. I'd run you over to run 7th.\" In addition to aforementioned incidents, Hmiel was involved in an incident at Rockingham Speedway in 2003 where spun out Mike Wallace entering turns 1 and 2, with analyst Darrell Waltrip proclaiming on a replay that \"Looking at that you'd say, Shane Hmiel just run over him.\" The two had a physical confrontation after leaving their cars, requiring NASCAR officials to separate the drivers. Wallace was later fined $3,000 for yelling an expletive on national television.\n\nA turning point in Hmiel's life came in July 2007, when he was involved in a bar fight that led to an infection in his hand due to teeth being lodged in it. After spending 10 days in the hospital, Hmiel proceeded to check into drug rehab on July 23, 2007 at the Talbot Recover Center in Atlanta, GA. Deemed \"extremely addicted\", Hmiel spent 103 days at Talbot before checking out in October. During his stay, Hmiel confronted his emotional issues both on and off the track, leading to the correct diagnosis of bipolar disorder, as well as depression and anxiety.\n\nAfter rehabilitation from drug addiction and three-years-sober, Hmiel returned to racing in open-wheeled cars, with the goal of becoming \"the next American IndyCar driver.\" He competed in all three national touring divisions of the United States Auto Club in the USAC Silver Crown Series, the USAC National Sprint Car Series, and the USAC National Midget Series.\n\nIn 2009, Hmiel earned his first USAC-sanctioned win in the Sprint Car division at Iowa Speedway and scored a then-career-best dirt track finish of second in the Four Crown Nationals at Eldora Speedway. Hmiel earned post-season honors as USAC's \"Most Improved Driver.\" He was also named the Rookie of the Year in the 2009 Chili Bowl Midget Nationals in Tulsa, Oklahoma.\n\nIn 2010, he earned his first career Midget Series victory at Hickory Motor Speedway less than an hour from Mooresville, North Carolina, where he currently resides. The momentum from that victory carried on to other divisions. In the Sprint Car division, he broke the world speed record for a non-winged Sprint Car at Iowa Speedway, winning the pole with an average speed of 146.444 miles per hour. In addition to the speed record, he earned three victories, all on pavement, at O'Reilly Raceway Park at Indianapolis (twice) and Salem Speedway. In the Silver Crown division, he earned his first career series win and first dirt track win in the Hoosier Hundred race at the Indiana State Fairgrounds. During the season Hmiel became the first driver to win the Hoosier Hundred, Rich Vogler Classic, and Pat O'Connor Memorial, the three premier USAC midget-car races, in the same season.\n\nHmiel was slated to make his debut in the Firestone Indy Lights series (the top feeder circuit to the IndyCar Series) at Chicagoland Speedway for the Chicagoland 100 on August 28, 2010, but a back injury kept him from competing in the race.\n\nWhile qualifying for a USAC Silver Crown race, Hmiel's car crashed at the Terre Haute Action Track on October 9, 2010. The roll cage collapsed after hitting the retaining wall. He was airlifted to Methodist Hospital with head, back, and neck injuries. Shortly after arriving, he was in critical but stable condition after having been put into a medically induced coma to minimize brain swelling. Hmiel was paralyzed as a result of his injuries; Hmiel has since regained limited use of his limbs, but continues to require the use of a wheelchair.\n\nWhile in recovery from the aforementioned 2010 crash, Hmiel started a new USAC midget car team, partnering with former series champion Levi Jones. One year after the accident, Jones would score a victory in a car owned by Hmiel. Nearly two years after the accident, Hmiel was allowed back into a NASCAR garage for the first time since the 2006 ban, as a guest of Billy Ballew Motorsports and the crew chief, Nick Harrison (who had worked with Hmiel in the past) at Atlanta Motor Speedway, watching as Kurt Busch raced the team's No. 51 entry (in the truck Hmiel had won with in 2004) to a top-10 finish.\n\nIn January 2013, Hmiel returned to racing in a driving experience event at Rockingham Speedway, a track Hmiel had raced on during his career. The event, hosted by Accessible Racing, allowed Hmiel as well as two disabled military veterans to run laps on the track at over 100 mph in a modified Gen-4 Ford Fusion stock car.\n\nIn January 2016, Hmiel fielded a car at the Chili Bowl for Eric Saunders, a former motocross rider who had also been paralyzed in an accident.\n\n"}

For nine months in 2012, he also co-hosted an Australian television show, \"Breakfast\", which ceased production on 30 November 2012, due to low ratings.\n\nPaul Henry Hopes was born in Auckland, New Zealand, to Brian and Olive Hopes, on 4 August 1960. He attended Cockle Bay Primary in Howick, Auckland. His parents separated when he was 11, and in 1971 he moved with his English-born mother to Bristol, United Kingdom, where he finished his education and won a drama school scholarship. Paul and his mother Olive lived in a council flat. Olive worked triple shifts in a plastic bag factory to make ends meet. Henry says that when he was 25 he discovered that his grandmother was a \"Gypsy\".\n\nHenry has been a radio and television presenter in New Zealand, where he was born and has spent the majority of his career. Henry has been a backup host for current affairs show \"Close Up\". After numerous controversies on morning talk show \"Breakfast\" which he hosted between 2004 and 2010, Henry was involved in a high-profile scandal in October 2010 involving his pronunciation and ridicule of the name of Indian politician Sheila Dikshit. The scandal culminated in Henry's resignation from TVNZ.\n\nPaul Henry started his broadcasting career working for the BBC, as a studio assistant and in the mail room. He worked as a projectionist in the natural history unit, where, according to the \"Sunday Star Times\", \"David Attenborough would come in and Henry would play the rushes\". Henry returned to New Zealand when he was 19 and worked as a producer on National Radio.\nOn radio, Henry worked as a breakfast host on 2ZD Radio Wairarapa from 1986 to 1990.\n\nHenry left 2ZD to set up his own radio station, 'Today FM 89.3' in 1991, and worked as the breakfast host along with local identity Rick Long, and former 2ZD station manager John (Johnnie) Shearer. Notable employees of TODAY FM included Hilary Pankurst (now Barry), current co-host of Seven Sharp, and Georgina Beyer, who later became the world's first openly transsexual mayor and MP. The radio station had a unique local format including morning talkback with Rick Long. Henry hosted the breakfast show with his former manager, John Shearer. The breakfast show gave Henry free licence to shamelessly promote his radio station. His co-host Shearer was often at the receiving end of Henry's jokes. Henry would famously say he doesn't want to hurt his feelings and every morning when Shearer signed off, Henry would warn listeners to \"take care on the roads now John Shearer's on the roads\". At one time the station even flew a helicopter through the breakfast show with Shearer reporting from the air.\n\nHenry hosted six breakfast shows per week and often worked late at night and right across the weekend at the station, with outside live broadcasts. In 1992, Henry sold the station to the owner of Port FM, which rebranded the station as HITZ 89FM. Today the station exists as More FM 89.5, 105.5 Wairarapa. For a time there were three radio stations in Wairarapa, Today FM, Radio Wairarapa and Radio Pacific where Henry had hosted or co-hosted a breakfast show on each of the stations.\n\nHenry went on to be a foreign correspondent for Radio Pacific and weekend talkback host.\nPaul Henry presented Radio Pacific's Breakfast - \"The Morning Grill\" with Arch Tambakis, then Pam Corkery in the mid 1990s. Later he was the drive host on Radio Pacific, then later Radio Live when the station launched in 2005 and again in 2007.\n\nMoving into television, Henry co-hosted TVNZ's \"Breakfast\" between 2004 and 2010. In 2009, ratings for the show had improved to around 150,000 viewers from a base of around 100,000.\nHe was also the 2007-2008 host of the New Zealand version of \"This Is Your Life\" and was also supposed to host the 2010 series, but did not, after numerous controversies involving the Breakfast programme. He was later replaced by Paul Holmes. \nHenry won the People's Choice Award, Best Presenter at the 2010 Qantas NZ Film and Television Awards.\nHis outrageous acceptance speech has attracted more than 300,000 views on YouTube.\n\nOn 10 October 2010, following Henry's controversial comments about the New Zealand Governor General, Sir Anand Satyanand, and the Delhi chief minister, Sheila Dikshit, TVNZ announced that Henry had resigned. Paul Henry was forced to apologise.\nIn an interview the following month, Henry claimed that TVNZ, in particular chief executive Rick Ellis, had \"capitalised\" on him by encouraging him to be controversial on-air, adding that he believed it was wrong for the New Zealand Government to apologise to India for his remarks.\n\nOn 1 April 2011, it was announced Paul Henry was returning to radio broadcasting with TVNZ's rival Mediaworks. From July that year, Henry replaced Maggie Barry as the host of Radio Live's drivetime show, a position he had held four years previously. His tenure in the role would this time last just over half a year; Henry moved to Australia the following year to host Network Ten's new morning show. Until this move, Henry was also reported to be working across several high-profile projects on TV3, including a weekly Sunday evening show with the working title \"The Paul Henry Show\", later changed to be a New Zealand edition of the British comedy show \"Would I Lie to you?\" which aired in 2012 alongside the production of Henry's Australian show.\n\nIn February 2012, Henry moved to Sydney, Australia to join Network Ten's morning show \"Breakfast\" as co-host. The show debuted on 23 February 2012 to low ratings. As in New Zealand, Henry's on-air comments caused controversy: in May 2012 he suggested asylum seekers could stay in people's linen cupboards, and implied they were \"dirty\".\n\nWhile in Australia, Henry maintained work in New Zealand media as an Australian correspondent for Radio Live and as the host of \"Would I Lie to you?\" on TV3 He made guest appearances on Network Ten programs \"The Project\" and \"The Circle\", and was briefly considered as the host of the second series panel show \"Can of Worms\", replacing Ian Dickson. However, the role went eventually to Chrissie Swan\n\nDue to low ratings, Henry's \"Breakfast\" was cancelled on 30 November 2012 after less than one year on air. During the show's broadcast period, one of Henry's co-hosts and the show's executive producer quit, prompting speculation about whether the departures were due to tension with Henry. A newspaper reported other staff at the network resented Henry, claiming many wouldn't look at him when he walked in the room, and were planning to boycott the Christmas party. Both Henry and the low ratings of the show were continually lampooned by the comedy show \"The Hamster Wheel\".\n\n\"Breakfast\"'s axing fueled speculation Henry would relocate to New Zealand and TVNZ to host a revamped edition of \"Close Up\" Henry was offered the central anchor position on TVNZ's new primetime 7pm current affair programme, later titled \"Seven Sharp\", but Henry chose instead to honour his existing contract with Mediaworks.\n\nIn 2011 Henry published an autobiography, \"What Was I Thinking\". The book was a bestseller upon release. In 2013 he released another book, called \"Outraged\" also a bestseller.\n\nHenry returned to New Zealand after \"Breakfast\" ended; in late 2013 it was revealed that from 2014 Paul Henry would be hosting a late night current affairs show called \"The Paul Henry Show\", which would replace the long-running \"Nightline\". \"The Paul Henry Show\" lasted one year; in early October 2014 Henry was announced as the presenter for Mediaworks' new breakfast show to air simultaneously on TV3 and Radio Live. This new venture, entitled \"Paul Henry\", replaces both TV3's \"Firstline\" and Marcus Lush's morning segment on Radio Live. In 2016, Henry departed Mediaworks and announced he would be entering a period of \"semi-retirement\", splitting his time between New Zealand and the United States, and producing wine.\n\nFollowing the effects of the coronavirus pandemic in New Zealand, MediaWorks New Zealand announced a new showing hosted by Henry called \"Rebuilding Paradise\" starting in April 2020. The show will run four nights per week for four weeks and feature live interviews in regards to the country's response to COVID-19. This is the first project Henry has taken part in since the announcement of this period of \"semi-retirement\". \n\nHenry is currently married to entrepreneur Diane Forman. He was previously married to Rachael Hopes (née Orsman), with whom he had three children, Lucy, Sophie and Bella. They have since divorced. Henry was also married to radio producer Linzi Dryburgh, however the couple have also since divorced.\n\nIn 2014 it was reported in an interview that Henry was a nudist, which Henry has also stated on his show.\n\nHenry ran as the National Party candidate for the Wairarapa electorate in the 1999 general election. He lost to former radio colleague and New Zealand Labour Party candidate Georgina Beyer by 3,033 votes.\n\nIn March 2009, Henry caused offence by pointing out the facial hair of female guest anti-nuclear campaigner and Greenpeace worker Stephanie Mills. TVNZ stated that it had received a \"handful\" of complaints. Henry stated to the \"Sunday Star Times\": \"I certainly have no intention of apologising to people who have written in and complained. The key thing to me is what a fortunate life they must have that they can afford time and energy to complain about such an insignificant thing.\"\n\nIn August 2009, Henry referred to homosexuals as \"unnatural\", prompting a complaint to the Broadcasting Standards Authority, which regulates broadcast radio and television content within New Zealand. In February 2010, the Broadcasting Standards Authority declined to uphold the complaint.\n\nIn November 2009, Henry sparked controversy when he called singer Susan Boyle 'retarded'. His comments led to almost 200 complaints to the Broadcasting Standards Authority and an apology from Television New Zealand.\n\nIn October 2010, Henry was again the subject of complaints after a live broadcast in which he asked Prime Minister John Key whether the Governor-General, Sir Anand Satyanand, was \"even a New Zealander\". Henry went on to ask \"Are you going to choose a New Zealander who looks and sounds like a New Zealander this time\"...\"are we going to go for someone who is more like a New Zealander this time?\" Anand is of Indian descent but was born and raised in Auckland. Henry was criticised by Key, Labour leader Phil Goff and race relations commissioner Joris de Bres. Henry later apologised for his comments. After initially expressing its support for Henry, TVNZ announced the following day that it had suspended the presenter for two weeks without pay.\n\nFollowing the decision to suspend Henry, TVNZ continued to air a clip in which Henry referred to Delhi's chief minister Sheila Dikshit during the 2010 Commonwealth Games as \"the dipshit woman\" and even pronouncing her surname as \"Dick Shit\" instead of \"Dixit\", going on to state that \"it's so appropriate, because she's Indian, so she'd be dick-in-shit wouldn't she, do you know what I mean? Walking along the street... it's just so funny.\" New Zealand Indian Central Association president Paul Singh Bains said the fact that TVNZ was still \"promoting\" the clip on its website showed it had \"totally lost the plot\" and was insensitive to the offence Henry had caused.\nFollowing at least four complaints against the video, TVNZ removed it from the \"Video extras\" section of their website. Henry's resignation polarised the New Zealand public, with supporters claiming he was a victim of political correctness, and critics accusing him of pandering to the lowest common denominator.\n\nIndia summoned New Zealand's high commissioner Rupert Holborow to protest against Henry's \"racist and bigoted\" comments, and Holborow expressed his regret for the \"deep hurt\" they had caused.\n\nOn 16 May 2012, Henry was criticised for comments made on \"Breakfast\" regarding asylum seekers. When commenting on a newspaper article, about the Australian Government offering families money to house asylum seekers, Henry suggested that the idea could be \"broadened out\" saying: \"I mean if this is all about saving money you could broaden it out. Why not criminals? Not murderers, but low level criminals. You could - the jails could be smaller and you could put them in homestay situations. The mentally ill\". He later suggested the asylum seekers could be housed in linen cupboards. His remarks were featured on \"Media Watch\".\n\nHenry caused further controversy on 27 August 2012 by suggesting on the programme that Asylum Seekers should \"starve to death\" following reports that they would be conducting a hunger strike over plans to shift them to Nauru. He issued an apology the following morning following public backlash on Twitter.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2182512", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2182512", "title": "Clint Bowyer", "text": "Clint Bowyer\n\nClinton Edward Bowyer (born May 30, 1979) is an American professional stock car racing driver. He currently competes full-time in the NASCAR Cup Series, driving the No. 14 Ford Mustang for Stewart-Haas Racing. Prior to driving for Stewart-Haas Racing, he drove for HScott Motorsports for one year, Michael Waltrip Racing for four years, and Richard Childress Racing for eight years. Bowyer won the 2008 Nationwide Series championship driving for RCR.\n\nBowyer began racing at the age of five in motocross. He went on to capture over 200 wins and numerous championships over the next eight years. In 1996, he began racing street stocks at Thunderhill Speedway in Mayetta, Kansas, and won the Modified championship there in 2000. Bowyer racked up 18 wins and 32 top-five finishes on his way to capturing the 2001 Modified championships at Lakeside Speedway in Kansas City, Kansas and Heartland Park Topeka. In 2002, he began racing in the NASCAR Weekly Racing Series, posting 9 poles, 12 wins and 32 top-five finishes en route to a second-place finish in the NASCAR Weekly Racing Series national point standings. He was also crowned the 2002 NASCAR Weekly Racing Series Midwest Champion after another Modified championship at Lakeside Speedway and a Late Model championship at the famed I-70 Speedway in Odessa, MO, his first attempt at racing on asphalt.\n\nIn 2003, Bowyer raced a full season in the NASCAR AutoZone Elite Division Midwest Series, scoring one top-ten finish in 11 starts. He also would make his first ARCA starts in 2003, and caught the eye of legendary car owner Richard Childress after leading 47 laps and finishing second in his debut at Nashville Superspeedway driving for Scott Traylor out of Kansas City.\n\nAfter the second-place finish, Childress called Bowyer by phone and offered him a job. Bowyer thought he was joking and hung up on him. Childress called back soon afterward and with a not-too-happy tone he still offered the job to Bowyer.\n\nIn 2004, Bowyer began by finishing eighth in the ARCA Re/Max Series race at Daytona in the No. 7 Chevrolet for Scott Traylor. In 2004, Bowyer began running in the Busch Series for Childress, sharing seat time in the No. 21 Reese's -sponsored Chevrolet with Kevin Harvick. He drove in half of the 34 Busch Series races that year, winning one pole at Talladega and seven Top 10s, attaining a season-high third-place finish in the Federated Auto Parts 300 at Nashville Superspeedway in June. He also ran three races for Kevin Harvick Incorporated with help from Andy Petree Racing driving the No. 33 Chevrolet sponsored by Monaco Coaches and Snap-on. Bowyer made two starts for Bill McAnally Racing in the Camping World West Series in the No. 20 Chevrolet. In his two starts at Phoenix and Auto Club Speedway, he won one pole and had a best finish of second.\n\nBowyer's first full Busch season was in 2005, replacing Ron Hornaday in the No. 2 ACDelco-sponsored Chevrolet. He won two poles and two races en route to a second-place finish to repeat-champion Martin Truex Jr., losing by only 68 points. He also made his Nextel Cup debut in the No. 33 Sylvania-sponsored Chevy on April 23, 2005, during the Subway Fresh 500 at Phoenix International Raceway. He finished 22nd as the first car one lap down. Richard Childress Racing announced on October 15, 2005, that Bowyer would race the No. 07 Jack Daniel's-sponsored Chevrolet full-time in the Nextel Cup series, replacing Dave Blaney for the 2006 season.\n\nBowyer began his rookie Cup season with three Top 5 finishes and had a total of eleven Top 10s that season, with his best finish being a third at California Speedway. He finished 68 points behind Denny Hamlin for NASCAR Rookie of the Year honors. Bowyer also continued to drive the No. 2 in the Busch Series full-time, winning once and finishing third in points. Bowyer won his first Craftsman Truck Series race in the No. 46 Chevrolet Silverado fielded by Morgan-Dollar Motorsports at Texas Motor Speedway on November 3, 2006, in his third career Truck start, making his first CTS start that year at Martinsville for Green Light Racing.\n\nAfter starting the 2007 season with a last-lap crash at Daytona (crossing the finish line upside down and on fire as teammate Kevin Harvick won), Bowyer won the Budweiser Pole position for the Dodge Avenger 500 at Darlington Raceway. He finished the regular season ninth in points, but was seeded 12th for the playoff since race wins determine playoff seeding. Bowyer won his second pole at the Sylvania 300 at Loudon, and two days later went on to win his first Nextel Cup race in his 64th start. The win made Bowyer the fifteenth driver to win at least one race in all three of NASCAR's top series.\n\nFor the 2007 Busch season, Bowyer ran a partial Busch Series schedule in the RCR No. 2 car. On April 20, 2007, he won the Busch Series Bashas' Supermarkets 200 at Phoenix International Raceway. He followed that up with another Busch Series win on May 4 in the Circuit City 250 at Richmond International Raceway. Bowyer also ran select races in the NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series for Kevin Harvick.\n\nIn 2008, Bowyer continued to drive in the Cup and Nationwide Series full-time. Bowyer dominated the late stages of the Daytona 500 but was spun out by Juan Pablo Montoya with 17 laps remaining. On May 3, 2008, Bowyer earned his second Sprint Cup victory, winning the Crown Royal Presents the Dan Lowry 400 at Richmond International Speedway. Bowyer led only two laps, going to the front after Dale Earnhardt Jr. and Kyle Busch got together with less than four laps remaining in the race.\n\nOn August 23, 2008, Bowyer was announced as the driver of the No. 33 Chevrolet Impala SS for RCR. Casey Mears from Hendrick Motorsports replaced Bowyer in the Jack Daniel's-sponsored car. This move was necessitated by a sponsor's request, as General Mills did not want Mears, who had been driving in the 2008 season for rival cereal maker Kellogg's, representing them, so Childress sponsors General Mills and Brown-Forman Corporation (parent company to Jack Daniel's) agreed to the swap so Bowyer, who drove for Brown-Forman, would drive for General Mills, and Mears could drive for Brown-Forman, as they had no problems with Mears representing the company.\n\nOn November 15, 2008, Bowyer won the NASCAR Nationwide Series Championship at Homestead-Miami Speedway with a narrow margin of victory over Carl Edwards of 21 points. Edwards won the race with Bowyer finishing 5th.\n\nBowyer concentrated primarily on the Sprint Cup Series in 2009 and drove the No. 33 Chevrolet Impala to 15th place in the season standings. Bowyer trimmed his participation in the Nationwide series to 12 races but performed well, winning at Daytona (July 3) and Dover (September 26), finishing in the Top 5 in sixth of the 12 races and notching eighth Top 10s.\n\nBowyer started the Cup season in strong fashion, finishing fourth in the Daytona 500 and second at Las Vegas in the third race of the year. With a sixth in Atlanta and a fifth in Martinsville, Bowyer was second in the overall standings after six races.\n\nA tough stretch in races 7 through 12 dropped Bowyer down to 17th overall, 109 points behind Mark Martin in 12th place. After a much more consistent run in races 13- 23 (3rd at Pocono in the No. 33 Hartford Racing paint out, 8th at Sonoma, 8th at Michigan), Bowyer had climbed up to 14th overall, within 58 points of 12th place. Finishing in the Top 15 in 8 of 11 races helped him make up 51 points on the 12th-place position.\n\nA 21st finish the following week (race 24) at Bristol really hurt Bowyer's chance at the Chase, dropping him 112 points behind Matt Kenseth in 12th with just two races prior to the Chase. It was the 25th race (Pep Boys 500 at Atlanta) that sealed Bowyer's fate, as a spin on lap 309 cost him two laps and the chance to compete in the Chase.\n\nWhile his chances at the Chase were over, Bowyer finished the season as he started it, with five Top 10s and nine Top 15s in the last 11 races. His top finish was the sixth-place run at Charlotte in the Scary Fast Count Chocula paint out. Overall, Bowyer finished the 2009 Sprint Cup Series in 15th place.\n\nTrue to form, Bowyer, performed well early in 2010, finishing fourth in Daytona, seventh at Martinsville, and ninth at Phoenix to stand sixth after seven races. However, at Texas in the Samsung Mobile 500 (race 8), Bowyer got caught in a major crash on lap 317 that wiped out eighth other drivers and caused a 19-minute red flag race stoppage. The resulting 36th-place finish dropped Bowyer to 14th position overall, only one point behind 12th place Joey Logano. Seventh- and 12th-place finishes at Talladega and Richmond put Bowyer back into 12th place after 10 races.\n\nThe 11th race run at Darlington promised to be special. Bowyer ran the new \"The Hartford Racing\" paint out as part of The Hartford's 200th anniversary celebration. As part of Fox's coverage, Bowyer was one of four cars with an in-car camera for the race. However, 101 laps into the race, Bowyer went to the pits and ultimately the garage, with brake issues. After a second long stop to correct, Bowyer finished in 32nd position, 36 laps down.\n\nBowyer ran well again in races 12 through 14, like 17th, seventh, and nineth-place finishes allowed him to move back up into 12th-place overall. In race 13 (Coca-Cola 600 at Charlotte), Bowyer led lap 217 following a caution for debris. Kurt Busch passed Bowyer on the following lap and went on to win the race.\n\nIn races 15-17, Bowyer finished 22nd at Michigan, 31st at Sonoma, and seventh at Loudon, NH. Despite the poor finish, Bowyer was very competitive at Sonoma. He led lap 80 (of 110) and was in seventh place with 11 laps to go. But on lap 100, Elliott Sadler got bumped by Jeff Gordon and spun Bowyer, dropping him all the way back to 34th place.\n\nBowyer had one of his strongest runs of the year in the Coke Zero 400 at Daytona, leading 17 of the final 21 laps. Unfortunately on the final Green-White restart, Bowyer got split by Jeff Gordon, lost the lead, fell back in the pack and ultimately spun. In finishing 17th, Bowyer fell 49 points behind 12th place Carl Edwards.\n\nIn race 19 at Chicagoland, Bowyer ran well all night, finishing 4th and moving up into 12th place in the overall standings. He started 15th but moved up quickly, running in the Top 10 for the first half and then in the Top 5 for most of the latter half of the race, battling Jeff Gordon for the lead with less than 40 laps to go.\n\nIn the Sylvania 300 at New Hampshire Motor Speedway, Bowyer started second and led the most laps before fading back into the Top 5. Taking the white flag in the second position, he suddenly witnessed then-leader Tony Stewart run out of fuel, giving Bowyer the third win of his Sprint Cup career and vaulting him to second in the Chase standings behind Denny Hamlin. However, this was negated during post-race inspection at NASCAR's R&D center. Reports surfaced that Bowyer's car used at Richmond had come close to failing inspection. NASCAR announced on September 22 that they had issued fines and penalties to the No. 33 team after failing a secondary inspection. Most critically, crew chief Shane Wilson was suspended for the next 6 races and both Bowyer and car owner Richard Childress face $150,000 in fines and the loss of 150 championship points. The penalty dropped Bowyer back to 12th in points, 185 points behind Denny Hamlin. Childress appealed the decision, which reduced the suspensions to four races and $100,000, but the 150-point deduction was upheld.\n\nDuring the Pepsi Max 400 weekend at Fontana, Bowyer and fellow Childress driver Austin Dillon taped an episode of \"The Price Is Right\" that was scheduled to feature NASCAR-themed Showcases (a practice that occurs during a Fontana race; host Drew Carey was the Grand Marshal of the August 2008 race) and aired on November 15. Bowyer finished 2nd to Tony Stewart in the race.\n\nBowyer barely edged teammate Kevin Harvick for the victory in the fall Talladega race, the AMP Energy Juice 500. The race ended with the leaders in Turn 1 when a caution was displayed for a large wreck on the front straightaway on the final lap.\n\nBowyer finished 10th in the final Chase standings, earning him a spot on stage at the season-ending Awards Banquet.\n\nBowyer started off the 2011 season strong in the Budweiser shootout practice sessions, and he and his teammates regularly sat on top of the pylon. In the race, he and Jeff Burton led many laps but faded to 10th at the end (9th due to Denny Hamlin being penalized for going below the yellow line).\n\nBowyer qualified 5th for the Daytona 500 and finished 2nd to teammate Jeff Burton in the second Gatorade duel by 0.005 seconds. They together dominated that race. In the Daytona 500, Bowyer teamed up with many drivers throughout the day including Jeff Burton; Paul Menard (his new RCR teammate); Dale Earnhardt Jr.; and Kyle Busch. After Burton's engine let go, Bowyer found himself getting a push from Kyle Busch. With four laps to go, Kurt Busch got into the back of Regan Smith which turned him up in front of Bowyer. Ryan Newman was also involved. Bowyer was able to salvage a 17th-place finish out of it, mainly because of the big pileups earlier in the race. He had led 31 laps.\n\nThe next race at Phoenix, Bowyer was taken out early in a multi-car crash on the backstretch. The Helping Hands (his pit crew) were able to repair the car fairly quickly and he was able to finish 27th.\n\nIn the 2011 Aaron's 499 at Talladega, Bowyer led the most laps with 38 and was being pushed by Kevin Harvick on the last lap, dueling with Hendrick drivers Jeff Gordon and Mark Martin. Approaching the tri-oval, Jimmie Johnson and Dale Earnhardt Jr. squeezed to the far inside, and Johnson beat Bowyer to the line by 0.002 seconds (less than a foot) in a four-wide finish, tied with the finish of Ricky Craven over Kurt Busch in the 2003 Carolina Dodge Dealers 400 for closest finish in Sprint Cup history.\n\nAt Dover, in the Nationwide series, Bowyer was involved in a major crash on the last lap, with Bowyer going on his side. He, and no one else were injured.\n\nAt New Hampshire, Bowyer led 49 of the last 51 laps and seemed to be on the road to victory; but with two laps to go, in a bizarre twist of fate, Tony Stewart passed him to win in a role reversal from the 2010 race.\n\nOn October 7, Bowyer signed a 3-year contract to race the No. 15 Toyota for Michael Waltrip Racing, starting in 2012.\n\nBowyer did not make the Chase, but he won the Chase race at Talladega for the 2nd consecutive year, pulling a slingshot on Burton out of turn 4 on the final lap of the race. The margin of victory was 0.018 seconds. It was his last win with Richard Childress Racing.\n\nThe 2012 season marked a new beginning for Bowyer as he moved from Richard Childress Racing to Michael Waltrip Racing, signing a 3-year deal. Improvements at Michael Waltrip Racing with the addition of former RCR director of competition Scott Miller and veteran driver Mark Martin as a teammate translated into Bowyer's best season statistically in the Sprint Cup Series.\n\nBowyer's 2012 season began sour, as his Daytona 500 qualifying time was disallowed, and he also ran out of fuel under green when he missed pit road during the 500. In March, he ended up starting a year-long rivalry with Jeff Gordon at the Martinsville race. Gordon's team, Hendrick Motorsports, was going for their 200th victory at the team's statistically best track. On a late green-white-checkered restart with 2 laps to go, Gordon was running first with Hendrick teammate Jimmie Johnson in second and Bowyer third. Bowyer dove to the low side and made it three wide going into turn one, sending all three spinning around and giving the win to Ryan Newman. Bowyer apologized for the contact but later incidents at other 2012 races led to a heated rivalry.\n\nIn June, at the Toyota/Save Mart 350at Sonoma, California, Bowyer dominated the race, scoring his first road course victory as well as his first MWR win by holding off Tony Stewart and Kurt Busch. At the AdvoCare 500 at Atlanta, Bowyer suffered battery issues but still managed to clinch a Chase berth with a 27th-place finish. He rebounded the following week at the Federated Auto Parts 400 at Richmond, winning the race using fuel strategy despite being spun by Juan Pablo Montoya mid-race.\n\nBowyer's two wins positioned him sixth at the start of the Chase for the Sprint Cup. In the Chase, he won at Charlotte after Brad Keselowski made a late-race pit stop.\n\nComing to the white flag at the AdvoCare 500 (Phoenix) on November 11, 2012, Bowyer's rivalry with [[Jeff Gordon] came to a head. Earlier in the race, Bowyer accidentally put Gordon into the wall. Gordon was then black-flagged for a failed attempt to cut Bowyer's tire. On the next-to-last lap, Gordon decided enough was enough and responded by intentionally wrecking Bowyer in turn three, collecting Joey Logano and Aric Almirola. After Gordon's car was parked behind his team's hauler, a member of Bowyer's team shoved Gordon from behind and both teams scuffled. After Bowyer entered the pit area with his damaged car and noticed his team was not in his pit stall, he sprinted towards Gordon's hauler attempting to enter it before being restrained by a single NASCAR official. The incident knocked Boyer down to fourth place in the points standings and mathematically ended Bowyer's chance of winning the Championship. Bowyer was not penalized for his involvement in the fight, but his crew chief Brian Pattie was fined $35,000 after he expressed his displeasure with Gordon by using profanity on national television, forcing ESPN to apologize to viewers.\n\nThe following week, Bowyer rebounded, and finished second at Homestead (ironically behind Gordon) and completed the season with a career best second-place finish in the final points, passing [[Jimmie Johnson]] by one point, who was eliminated with a drive train malfunction. In victory lane at the race, Jeff Gordon apologized for his behavior at Phoenix and moved on from the incident.\n\nBowyer started out 2013 by participating in the Rolex [[24 Hours of Daytona]], driving a [[Ferrari 458]] with [[AF Corse]]/[[Michael Waltrip Racing]]. The team finished 16th overall and 7th in class.\n\nAt [[Richmond International Raceway]] on September 7, Bowyer became the subject of controversy as, late in the race, his No. 15 Toyota spun; accusations were made that the spin was intentional, as part of an effort by MWR to ensure that [[Martin Truex Jr.]] qualified for the [[Chase for the Sprint Cup]]. NASCAR president [[Mike Helton]] stated the following morning that scoring officials on the scene did not believe the spin was intentional, but that NASCAR was reviewing the incident. The following Monday evening, NASCAR docked all three MWR teams, including Bowyer, 50 driver/owner points. MWR was also fined $300,000. Despite the large penalty, Bowyer retained enough points to remain in the Chase. He had already clinched a spot in the Chase at the [[2013 Irwin Tools Night Race|Irwin Tools Night Race]].\n\n[[File:RSR Photo 3-7-14 622.JPG|thumb|Bowyer at [[Las Vegas Motor Speedway]] in 2014]]\nBowyer did not participate in the [[2014 Sprint Unlimited|Sprint Unlimited]] as he did not win a pole during the 2013 season. His season started on a wild note when Bowyer was involved in a last lap crash of race 2 in the [[2014 Budweiser Duels|Budweiser Duels]], with Bowyer's car being sent airborne and performing a [[barrel roll]] before landing on its wheels.\n\nAt Darlington, Bowyer was the center of controversy when he got some contact with Kurt Busch. While racing Busch for a top-ten spot, Bowyer drove into the back of Kurt Busch who spun out and wrecked. Busch replied by waving his hands in frustration at Bowyer under yellow. In a post-race interview, Bowyer apologized, stating \"You never want to wreck anybody. It was quite clear I got into the back of him and wrecked him.\"\n\nTwo weeks later at Richmond, Bowyer tried to move to the lead on lap 1 but tapped pole-sitter [[Kyle Larson]] which forced Larson to drive from 43rd for a recovery. Later his car caught fire on pit road during a pit-stop.\n\nAfter an Atlanta engine blowup, Bowyer's hopes to make the Chase by consistency were dashed and the next week Bowyer missed the Chase by a slim 3 points. He would finish 19th in points\n\nIn the Texas Nationwide race, Bowyer replaced [[Elliott Sadler]] on lap seven due to a stomach illness, Bowyer qualified for Sadler for the race.\n\n[[File:5 Hour Energy Clint Bowyer pit stop (19885591022).jpg|thumb|right|Bowyer on pit road at New Hampshire Motor Speedway in 2015]]\nBowyer started off the season with a top 10 at Daytona. Despite having a few top tens throughout the year, on August 19 it was announced that Bowyer & MWR will part ways after the season ends, with MWR not fielding full-time teams in 2016. On September 30, 2015, it was announced that [[Tony Stewart]] ([[Stewart-Haas Racing]]) would retire from the NASCAR Sprint Cup series after the 2016 season and negotiated a contract which will allow Bowyer to drive the No. 14 car in the 2017 season. On October 2, 2015, it was announced that Bowyer will move to [[HScott Motorsports]] for the 2016 season replacing [[Justin Allgaier]] before making his transition to [[Stewart-Haas Racing]] the following season. On December 15, 2015, a leaked photo on [[Twitter]] showed that Bowyer will bring over his No. 15 & 5-Hour-Energy sponsorship from Michael Waltrip Racing to HScott Motorsports for his lone season with them. Bowyer made the Chase due to having enough points to qualify, but his Chase was hit heavily by a 25 driver and owner points penalty, a $75,000 fine and the suspension of crew chief Billy Scott for 3 races. Bowyer appealed the penalties but they were upheld by the appeals panel. With the penalty, Bowyer didn't advance to the second round of the Chase.\n\nIn his last season with MWR, Bowyer was winless, and scored just 12 top 10s and finished 16th in the championship.\n\n[[File:Clint Bowyer 15 HScott Motorsports Chevrolet.jpg|thumb|left|Bowyer's 2016 car at [[Daytona International Speedway]]]]\nBowyer started the season on a low note finishing 33rd after a loose wheel at Daytona. Bowyer struggled at Atlanta with his car down a cylinder finishing 35th. Bowyer had some poor finishes, and including a 38th-place finish at Texas where he left the garage after the car was repairable. Bowyer later a first top ten finish this season coming at Bristol with an 8th-place finish. Two weeks later, Bowyer finished a season best 7th-place finish after avoiding massive crashes at Talladega. Coming back to Daytona, Bowyer would avoid crashes to finish 9th. Bowyer ended the season winless and no top 5s with only 3 top tens and finishing 27th in the point standings.\n\nBowyer returned to the Nationwide Series, now known as the Xfinity Series, at Chicagoland, driving the No. 88 for [[JR Motorsports]]. He ended up starting the race in 7th and finishing the race in 6th.\n\n[[File:Clint Bowyer Sonoma 2017.jpg|thumb| Bowyer during qualifying for the [[2017 Toyota/Save Mart 350]]]]\nWith Tony Stewart's retirement, Bowyer moved from the No. 15 HSM Chevy to the No. 14 Stewart-Haas Racing Ford Fusion. Bowyer started the season with a 2nd-place finish on the 2nd Can-Am Duel. Bowyer got his first top ten at Las Vegas with a 10th-place finish. Bowyer had a significantly better race at Auto Club, finishing third and a 2nd-place at Bristol several races later. After no top fives 7 races later he finished second at Sonoma behind teammate [[Kevin Harvick]] giving [[Stewart-Haas Racing]] its 2nd ever 1-2 finish for the first time since 2011. Bowyer finished second again at the [[2017 Coke Zero 400|Coke Zero 400]] at Daytona the following week. Deja vu happened as a mechanical issue in the [[Southern 500]] at Darlington put Bowyer in a must-win situation at Richmond (just like in 2014) to make the Playoffs. He finished 24th after contact with [[Matt Kenseth]] as Kenseth avoided an ambulance at the entry of pit road while under caution and 18th in the final points standings.\n\nBowyer got off to a strong start in 2018, posting Top 15 finishes in four of the first five events, including a third-place finish at the Atlanta race. On March 26, he broke a 190-race winless streak with a victory at the [[2018 STP 500|spring Martinsville race]], which gave him his first Playoff run since 2015. Bowyer then scored his second win of the season at the rain-shortened [[2018 FireKeepers Casino 400|June Michigan race]]. Despite bad finishes at [[2018 South Point 400|Las Vegas]] and [[2018 Gander Outdoors 400 (Dover)|Dover]], he has stayed consistent in the Playoffs, advancing to the Round of 8 before a crash at [[2018 Can-Am 500|Phoenix]] eliminated him from the Playoffs. Bowyer finished the season 12th in points.\n\nAt the conclusion of the [[2019 Monster Energy NASCAR All-Star Race]], Bowyer chopped [[Ryan Newman (racing driver)|Ryan Newman]]'s nose which sent Bowyer into the wall during the cool-down lap. Following the race, Bowyer attacked Newman on pit road. Both drivers were called to the NASCAR hauler, but neither was penalized for the incident. During an autograph session at a [[Bass Pro Shops]] store on May 23, a fan brought a pair of boxing gloves for both drivers to sign. Despite a string of inconsistent finishes and no wins during the season, Bowyer managed to make the 2019 playoffs after finishing fifth at [[2019 Brickyard 400|Indianapolis]]. On September 14, Bowyer won the pole at Las Vegas, his first pole since 2007. He finished fourth at the [[2019 Bank of America Roval 400|Charlotte Roval]] to advance to the Round of 12. Bowyer was eliminated in the Round of 12 after the [[2019 Hollywood Casino 400|Kansas race]]. He finished 9th in the final points standings despite not reaching victory lane as he did the season prior, his first top ten points finish since 2013. On December 4, 2019, Stewart-Haas Racing announced that Johnny Klausmeier would replace [[Mike Bugarewicz]] as the crew chief of the No. 14 team in 2020.\n\nIn March at the [[Auto Club Speedway]], Bowyer edged out [[Jimmie Johnson]] to win the pole for the [[2020 Auto Club 400|Auto Club 400]], the fourth of his career. Bowyer would finish the race in 23rd place, one lap down.\n\nBowyer started his own Dirt Late Model team, Clint Bowyer Racing in 2008. Well-established veteran Shannon Babb of Mowequa, IL was behind the wheel of Clint's Rocket Chassis, and had a very solid season. Babb left to form his own team at the end of 2008, due to wanting to run more of an \"outlaw\" type schedule, and wanting to race closer to home to be with his family. For the 2009 season, the 2005 World 100 Champion Dale McDowell (who ironically inherited the win via Babb being light at the scales) took over the seat, and the number was changed to Dale's signature No. 17M, Jared Landers also drives for the team in the No. 5 late model.\n\nThe team elected to run the Lucas Oil Late Model Dirt Series full-time in 2009, choosing to run Warrior Racecars, with help from Warrior's owner, Sanford Goddard. Winning two races and finishing fourth in the points standings, it was a decent season. Since then, the 17M has become a staple of the Lucas Oil Series, continuing on the 2010 tour. Clint Bowyer Racing also has fielded cars in [[Tony Stewart]]'s [[Prelude to the Dream]] in 2008 (Bowyer, 2nd and [[Jimmie Johnson]], 10th) and 2010 (Johnson won, Bowyer 2nd). Both years these were also Warrior Racecars.\n\nClint Bowyer Racing fielded a car for Clint in 2011 for the UNOH DIRTcar Nationals. A victory in a feature night race helped Clint secure the overall modified championship in the event. In 2014 Clint Bowyer Racing won its first Lucas Oil Dirt Late Model Championship with Don O'Neal driving the No. 5 Peak Performance car.\n\nIn 2016, after Clint Bowyer's lowest-ranking season with [[HScott Motorsports]], Clint Bowyer and Clint Bowyer Racing filed a lawsuit against Harry Scott, Jr. charging him with breach-of-contract and fraud. The team charged that Bowyer brought some former MWR sponsors to the team and that HScott missed monthly payments for Bowyer's driving services in October and November of 2016. Bowyer also alleged that the team was using money owed to him, to pay off their creditors. Upon filing the suit, Bowyer received a temporary court order against HScott Motorsports, ordering them to hold onto at least 2.2 million pending the lawsuit. The lawsuit was quickly settled out of court less than a week later, in a \"mutual, amicable, confidential settlement.\"\n\nIn April 2014, Bowyer married Lorra. Weeks after their marriage they announced that they were expecting their first child together, a boy. On October 1, 2014, their son Cash Aaron Bowyer was born. On June 15, 2016, it was announced that Bowyer and his wife are expecting their 2nd child. On December 9, 2016, his wife Lorra gave birth to a healthy baby girl named Presley Elizabeth.\n\nHe is an avid fan of the [[Kansas City Royals]] of the [[MLB]], the [[Kansas City Chiefs]] of the [[NFL]], and the [[University of Kansas Jayhawks]] of the [[NCAA]]\n\nOn May 6, 2008, Clint Bowyer attended and hosted the first annual Clint Bowyer Charity Golf Event in his hometown of Emporia, Kansas. It raised $160,000 for the Emporia Community foundation to \"make Emporia a better place.\n\nWhile Bowyer was in Emporia for one of his golf tournaments for charity, he had the idea to raise money for and build a community center. Bowyer dedicated the building on March 12, 2012. Bowyer says he envisions the building can be used for anything for business meetings to weddings to concerts and was constructed with flexibility in mind. The new Bowyer Community Building is located at the Lyon County fairgrounds, which is on Highway 50 in Emporia.\n\nBowyer made a guest appearance on an episode of [[A&E (TV channel)|A&E]]'s \"[[Duck Dynasty]]\" in 2012 on an episode titled \"Drag Me To Glory\". Bowyer was featured in the episode using his customized camouflage limousine in a race with the shows star, [[Willie Robertson]], who was using a similar limousine. In 2015, he co-hosted an episode of \"[[Diners, Drive-ins and Dives]]\" with [[Guy Fieri]] where they went around [[Charlotte, North Carolina|Charlotte]] to find the best food spots.\n\nIn June 2019, Bowyer was a color commentator for the \"[[Fox NASCAR]]\" broadcast of the Xfinity race at Pocono. Part of a Cup drivers-only coverage, he worked alongside [[Kevin Harvick]] and [[Joey Logano]] in the broadcast booth.\n\n Season still in progress<br>\n\n\n[[Category:1979 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:People from Emporia, Kansas]]\n[[Category:Racing drivers from Kansas]]\n[[Category:NASCAR drivers]]\n[[Category:NASCAR Xfinity Series champions]]\n[[Category:ARCA Menards Series drivers]]\n[[Category:24 Hours of Daytona drivers]]\n[[Category:Rolex Sports Car Series drivers]]\n[[Category:20th-century American racing drivers]]\n[[Category:21st-century American racing drivers]]\n[[Category:Motorsport team owners]]\n[[Category:Emporia High School alumni]]"}
{"id": "2182514", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2182514", "title": "Dialogical self", "text": "Dialogical self\n\nThe dialogical self is a psychological concept which describes the mind's ability to imagine the different positions of participants in an internal dialogue, in close connection with external dialogue. The \"dialogical self\" is the central concept in the dialogical self theory (DST), as created and developed by the Dutch psychologist Hubert Hermans since the 1990s.\n\nDialogical Self Theory (DST) weaves two concepts, self and dialogue, together in such a way that a more profound understanding of the interconnection of self and society is achieved. Usually, the concept of self refers to something \"internal,\" something that takes place within the mind of the individual person, while dialogue is typically associated with something \"external,\" that is, processes that take place between people involved in communication.\n\nThe composite concept \"dialogical self\" goes beyond the self-other dichotomy by infusing the external to the internal and, in reverse, to introduce the internal into the external. As functioning as a \"society of mind\", the self is populated by a multiplicity of \"self-positions\" that have the possibility to entertain dialogical relationships with each other.\n\nIn Dialogical Self Theory (DST) the self is considered as \"extended,\" that is, individuals and groups in the society at large are incorporated as positions in the mini-society of the self. As a result of this extension, the self does not only include internal positions (e.g., I as the son of my mother, I as a teacher, I as a lover of jazz), but also external positions (e.g., my father, my pupils, the groups to which I belong).\n\nGiven the basic assumption of the extended self, the other is not simply outside the self but rather an intrinsic part of it. There is not only the actual other outside the self, but also the imagined other who is entrenched as the other-in-the-self. An important theoretical implication is that basic processes, like self-conflicts, self-criticism, self-agreements, and self-consultancy, are taking place in different domains in the self: within the internal domain (e.g., \"As an enjoyer of life I disagree with myself as an ambitious worker\"); between the internal and external (extended) domain (e.g., \"I want to do this but the voice of my mother in myself criticizes me\") and within the external domain (e.g., \"The way my colleagues interact with each other has led me to decide for another job\").\n\nAs these examples show, there is not always a sharp separation between the inside of the self and the outside world, but rather a gradual transition. DST assumes that the self as a society of mind is populated by internal and external self-positions. When some positions in the self silence or suppress other positions, monological relationships prevail. When, in contrast, positions are recognized and accepted in their differences and alterity (both within and between the internal and external domains of the self), dialogical relationships emerge with the possibility to further develop and renew the self and the other as central parts of the society at large.\n\nDST is inspired by two thinkers in particular, William James and Mikhail Bakhtin, who worked in different countries (USA and Russia, respectively), in different disciplines (psychology and literary sciences), and in different theoretical traditions (pragmatism and dialogism). As the composite term dialogical self suggests, the present theory finds itself not exclusively in one of these traditions but explicitly at their intersection. As a theory about the self it is inspired by William James, as a theory about dialogue it elaborates on some insights of Mikhail Bakhtin. The purpose of the present theory is to profit from the insights of founding fathers like William James, George Herbert Mead and Mikhail Bakhtin and, at the same time, to go beyond them.\nWilliam James (1890) proposed a distinction between the \"I\" and the \"Me\", which, according to Morris Rosenberg, is a classic distinction in the psychology of the self. According to James the I is equated with the self-as-knower and has three features: continuity, distinctness, and volition. The continuity of the self-as-knower is expressed in a sense of personal identity, that is, a sense of sameness through time. A feeling of distinctness from others, or individuality, is also characteristic of the self-as-knower. Finally, a sense of personal volition is reflected in the continuous appropriation and rejection of thoughts by which the self-as-knower manifests itself as an active processor of experience.\n\nOf particular relevance to DST is James's view that the \"Me\", equated with the self-as-known, is composed of the empirical elements considered as belonging to oneself. James was aware that there is a gradual transition between \"Me\" and \"mine\" and concluded that the empirical self is composed of all that the person can call his or her own, \"not only his body and his psychic powers, but his clothes and his house, his wife and children, his ancestors and friends, his reputation and works, his lands and horses, and yacht and bank-account\". According to this view, people and things in the environment belong to the self, as far as they are felt as \"mine\". This means that not only \"my mother\" belongs to the self but even \"my enemy\". In this way, James proposed a view in which the self is 'extended' to the environment. This proposal contrasts with a Cartesian view of the self which is based on a dualistic conception, not only between self and body but also between self and other. With his conception of the extended self, that defined as going beyond the skin, James has paved the way for later theoretical developments in which other people and groups, defined as \"mine\" are part of a dynamic multi-voiced self.\nIn the above quotation from William James, we see a constellation of characters (or self-positions) which he sees as belonging to the \"Me/mine\": my wife and children, my ancestors and friends. Such characters are more explicitly elaborated in Mikhail Bakhtin's metaphor of the polyphonic novel, which became a source of inspiration for later dialogical approaches to the self. In proposing this metaphor, he draws on the idea that in Dostoevsky's works there is not a single author at work—Dostoevsky himself—but several authors or thinkers, portrayed as characters such as Ivan Karamazov, Myshkin, Raskolnikov, Stavrogin, and the Grand Inquisitor.\n\nThese characters are not presented as obedient slaves in the service of one author-thinker, Dostoevsky, but treated as independent thinkers, each with their own view of the world. Each hero is put forward as the author of his own ideology, and not as the object of Dostoevsky's finalizing artistic vision. Rather than a multiplicity of characters within a unified world, there is a plurality of consciousnesses located in different worlds. As in a polyphonic musical composition, multiple voices accompany and oppose one another in dialogical ways. In bringing together different characters in a polyphonic construction, Dostoevsky creates a multiplicity of perspectives, portraying characters conversing with the Devil (Ivan and the Devil), with their alter egos (Ivan and Smerdyakov), and even with caricatures of themselves (Raskolnikov and Svidrigailov).\n\nInspired by the original ideas of William James and Mikhail Bakhtin, Hubert Hermans, Harry Kempen and Rens van Loon wrote the first psychological publication on the \"dialogical self\" in which they conceptualized the self in terms of a dynamic multiplicity of relatively autonomous \"I\"-positions in the (extended) landscape of the mind. In this conception, the \"I\" has the possibility to move from one spatial position to another in accordance with changes in situation and time. The \"I\" fluctuates among different and even opposed positions, and has the capacity to imaginatively endow each position with a voice so that dialogical relations between positions can be established. The voices function like interacting characters in a story, involved in processes of question and answer, agreement and disagreement. Each of them have a story to tell about their own experiences from their own stance. As different voices, these characters exchange information about their respective Me's and mines, resulting in a complex, narratively structured self.\n\nThe theory has led to the construction of different assessment and research procedures for investigating central aspects of the dialogical self. Hubert Hermans has constructed the \"Personal Position Repertoire\" (PPR) method, an idiographic procedure for assessing the internal and external domains of the self in terms of an organized position repertoire.\n\nThis is done by offering the participant a list of internal and external self-positions. The participants mark those positions that they feel as relevant in their lives. They are allowed to add extra internal and external positions to the list and phrase them in their own terms. The relationship between internal and external positions is then established by inviting the participants to fill out a matrix with the rows representing the internal positions and the columns the external positions. In the entries of the matrix, the participant fills in, on a scale from 0 to 5 the extent to which an internal position is prominent in the relation to an external position. The scores in the matrix allow for the calculation of a number of indices, such as sum scores representing the overall prominence of particular internal or external positions and correlations showing the extent to which internal (or external) positions have similar profiles. On the basis of the results of the quantitative analysis, some positions can be selected, by the client or assessor, for closer examination.\n\nFrom the selected positions the client can tell a story that reflects the specific experiences associated with that position and, moreover, assessor and client can explore which positions can be considered as a dialogical response to one or more other positions. In this way, the method combines both qualitative and quantitative analyses.\n\nThe psychometric aspects of the PPR method was refined a procedure proposed by A. Kluger, Nir, & Y. Kluger. The authors analyze clients' Personal Position Repertoires by creating a bi-plot of the factors underlying their internal and external positions. A bi-plot provides a clear and comprehensible visual map of the relations between all the meaningful internal and external positions within the self in such a way that both types of positions are simultaneously visible. Through this procedure clusters of internal and external positions and dominant patterns can be easily observed and analyzed.\n\nThe method allows researchers or practitioners to study the general deep structures of the self. There are multiple bi-plots technologies available today. The simplest approach, however, is to perform a standard principal component analysis (PCA). To obtain a bi-plot, a PCA is once performed on the external positions and once on the internal positions, with the number of components in both PCA's restricted to two. Next, a scatter of the two PCAs is plotted on the same plane, where results of the first components are projected to the X-axis and of the second components to Y-axis. In this way, an overview of the organization of the internal and external positions together is realized.\n\nAnother assessment method, the \"Personality Web\", is devised by Raggatt. This semi-structured method starts from the assumption that the self is populated by a number of opposing narrative voices, with each voice having its own life story. Each voice competes with other voices for dominance in thought and action and each is constituted by a different set of affectively-charged attachments, to people, events, objects and one's own body.\n\nThe assessment comprises two phases— \n\nThis method represents a combination of qualitative and quantitative procedures that provide insight in the content and organization of a multi-voiced self.\n\nDialogical relationships are also studied with an adapted version of the \"Self-Confrontation Method\" (SCM).\n\nTake the following example. A client, Mary, reported that she sometimes experienced herself as a witch, eager to murder her husband, particularly when he was drunk. She did a self-investigation in two parts, one from her ordinary position as Mary and another from the position of the witch. Then, she told from each of the positions a story about her past, present, and future. These stories were summarized in the form of a number of sentences. It appeared that Mary formulated sentences that were much more acceptable from a societal point of view than those from the witch. Mary formulated sentences like \"I want to try to see what my mother gives me: there's only one of me\" or \"For the first time in my life, I'm engaged in making a home (\"home\" is also coming at home, entering into myself)\", whereas the witch produced statements like \"With my bland, pussycat qualities I have vulnerable things in hand, from which I derive power at a later moment (somebody tells me things that I can use so that I get what I want)\" or \"I enjoy when I have broken him [husband]: from a power position entering the battlefield.\"\n\nIt was found that the sentences of the two positions were very different in content, style, and affective meaning. Moreover, the relationship between Mary and the witch seemed to be more monological than dialogical, that is, either the one or the other was in control of the self and the situation and there was not no exchange between them. After the investigation, Mary received a therapeutic supervision during which she started to keep a diary in which she learned to make fine discriminations between her own experiences as Mary and those of the witch. She became not only aware of the needs of the witch but learned also to give an adequate response as soon as she noticed that the energy of the witch was upcoming. In a second investigation, one year later, the intensely conflicting relationship between Mary and the witch was significantly reduced and, as a result, there was less tension and stress in the self. She reported that in some situations, she even could make good use of the energy of the witch (e.g., when applying for a job). Whereas in some situations she was in control of the witch, in other situations she could even cooperate with her. The changes that took place between investigation 1 and investigation 2 suggested that the initial monological relationship between the two positions changed clearly into a more dialogical direction.\n\nUnder the supervision of the Polish psychologist Piotr Oleś, a group of researchers constructed a questionnaire method, called the \"Initial Questionnaire\", for the measurement of three types of \"internal activity\" (a) change of perspective, (b) internal monologue and (c) internal dialogue. The purpose of this questionnaire is to induce the subject's self-reflection and determine which \"I\"-positions are reflected by the participant's interlocutors and which of them give new and different points of view to the person.\n\nThe method includes a list of potential positions. The participants are invited to choose some of them and can add their own to the list. The selected positions, both internal and external ones, are then assessed as belonging to the dialogue, monologue of perspective categories. Such a questionnaire is well-suited for the investigation of correlations with other questionnaires.\n\nFor example, correlating the Initial Questionnaire with the Revised NEO Personality Inventory (NEO PI-R), the researchers found that persons having inner dialogues scored significantly lower on Assertiveness and higher on Self-Consciousness, Fantasy, Aesthetics, Feelings and Openness than people having internal monologues. They concluded that \"people entering into imaginary dialogues in comparison with ones having mainly monologues are characterized by a more vivid and creative imagination (Fantasy), a deep appreciation of art and beauty (Aesthetics) and receptivity to inner feelings and emotions (Feelings). They are curious about both inner and outer worlds and their lives are experientially richer. They are willing to entertain novel ideas and unconventional values and they experience positive as well as negative emotions more keenly (Openness). At the same time these persons are more disturbed by awkward social situations, uncomfortable around others, sensitive to ridicule, and prone to feelings of inferiority (Self-Consciousness), they prefer to stay in the background and let others do the talking (Assertiveness)\".\n\nOther methods are developed in fields related to DST. Based on Stiles' assimilation model, \"Osatuke et al.\", describes a method that enables the researcher to compare what is said by a client (verbal content) and how it is said (speech sounds). With this method the authors are able to assess to what extent the vocal manifestations (how it is said) of different internal voices of the same client parallel, contradict or complement their written manifestations (what is said). This method can be used to study the non-verbal characteristics of different voices in the self in connection with verbal content.\n\nOn the basis of Mikhail Bakhtin's theory of utterances, Leiman devised a \"dialogical sequence analysis.\" This method starts from the assumption that every utterance has an addressee. The central question is: To whom is the person speaking?\n\nUsually, we think of one listener as the immediately observable addressee. However, the addressee is rather a multiplicity of others, a complex web of invisible others, whose presence can be traced in the content, flow and expressive elements of the utterance (e.g., I'm directly addressing you but while speaking I'm protesting to a third person who is invisibly present in the conversation). When there are more than one addressees present in the conversation, the utterance positions the author/speaker into more (metaphorical) locations. Usually, these locations form sequences, that can be examined and made explicit when one listens carefully not only to the content but also the expressive elements in the conversation. Leiman's method, which analyzes a conversation in terms of \"chains of dialogical patterns\", is theory-guided, qualitative and sensitive to the verbal and the non-verbal aspects of utterances.\n\nIt is not the main purpose of the presented theory to formulate testable hypotheses, but to generate new ideas. It is certainly possible to perform theory-guided research on the basis of the theory, as exemplified by a special issue on dialogical self research in the \"Journal of Constructivist Psychology\" (2008) and in other publications (further on in the present section). Yet, the primary purpose is the generation of new ideas that lead to continued theory, research, and practice on the basis of links between the central concepts of the theory.\n\nTheoretical advances, empirical research, and practical applications are discussed in the \"International Journal for Dialogical Science\" and at the biennial \"International Conferences on the Dialogical Self\" as they are held in different countries and continents: Nijmegen, Netherlands (2000), Ghent, Belgium (2002), Warsaw, Poland (2004), Braga, Portugal (2006), Cambridge, United Kingdom (2008), Athens, Greece (2010), Athens, Georgia, United States (2012), and The Hague, Netherlands (2014).The aim of the journal and the conferences is to transcend the boundaries of (sub)disciplines, countries, and continents and create fertile interfaces where theorists, researchers and practitioners meet in order to engage in innovative dialogue.\n\nAfter initial publication on DST, the theory has been applied in a variety of fields: cultural psychology psychotherapy; personality psychology;psychopathology; developmental psychology; experimental social psychology; autobiography; social work; educational psychology; brain science; Jungian psychoanalysis; history; cultural anthropology; constructivism; social constructionism; philosophy; the psychology of globalization cyberpsychology; media psychology, vocational psychology, and literary sciences.\n\nFields of applications are also reflected by several special issues that appeared in psychological journals. In \"Culture & Psychology\" (2001), DST, as a theory of personal and cultural positioning, was exposed and commented on by researchers from different cultures. In \"Theory & Psychology\" (2002), the potential contribution of the theory for a variety of fields was discussed: developmental psychology, personality psychology, psychotherapy, psychopathology, brain sciences, cultural psychology, Jungian psychoanalysis, and semiotic dialogism. A second issue of this journal published in 2010 was also devoted to DST. In the \"Journal of Constructivist Psychology\" (2003) researchers and practitioners focused on the implications of the dialogical self for personal construct psychology, on the philosophy of Martin Buber, on the rewriting of narratives in psychotherapy, and on a psycho-dramatic approach in psychotherapy. The topic of mediated dialogue in a global and digital age was at the heart of a special issue in \"Identity: An International Journal of Theory and Research\" (2004). In \"Counselling Psychology Quarterly\" (2006), the dialogical self was applied to a variety of topics, such as, the relationship between adult attachment and working models of emotion, paranoid personality disorder, narrative impoverishment in schizophrenia, and the significance of social power in psychotherapy. In the \"Journal of Constructivist Psychology\" (2008) and in \"Studia Psychologica\" (2008), groups of researchers addressed the question of how empirical research can be performed on the basis of DST. The relevance of the dialogical self to developmental psychology was discussed in a special issue of \"New Directions for Child and Adolescent Development\" (2012). The application of the dialogical self in educational settings was presented in a special issue of the \"Journal of Constructivist Psychology\" (2013).\n\nSince its first inception in 1992, DST is discussed and evaluated, particularly at the biennial \"International Conferences on the Dialogical Self\" and in the \"International Journal for Dialogical Science\". Some of the main positive evaluations and main criticisms are summarized here. On the positive side, many researchers appreciate the breadth and the integrative character of the theory. As the above review of applications demonstrates, there is a broad range of fields in psychology and other disciplines in which the theory has received interests from thinkers, researchers and practitioners. The breadth of interest is also reflected by the range of scientific journals that have devoted special issues to the theory and its implications.\n\nThe theory has the potential to bring together scientists and practitioners from a variety of countries, continents and cultures. The \"Fifth International Conference on the Dialogical Self\" in Cambridge, United Kingdom attracted 300 participants from 43 countries. The conference focused primarily on DST, and dialogism as a related field. However, by focusing on dialogue, dialogical self goes beyond the post-modernism idea of the decentralization of the self and the notion of fragmentation. Recent work by John Rowan has resulted in the publication of a book by him entitled - 'Personification: Using the Dialogical Self in Psychotherapy and Counselling' published by Routledge. The book shows how to apply the concepts by those working in the therapeutic field.\n\nThe theory and its applications have also received several criticism. Many researchers have noted a discrepancy between theory and research. Certainly, more than most post-modernist approaches, the theory has instigated a variety of empirical studies and some of its main tenets are confirmed in experimental social-psychological research. Yet, the gap between theory and research still exists.\n\nClosely related to this gap, there is the lack of connection between dialogical self research and mainstream psychology. Although the theory and its applications have been published in mainstream journals like \"Psychological Bulletin\" and the \"American Psychologist\", it has not yet led to the adoption of the theory as a significant development in mainstream (American) psychology. Apart from the theory-research gap, one of the additional reasons for the lacking connection with mainstream research may be the fact that interest in the notion of dialogue, central in the history of philosophy since Plato, is largely neglected in psychology and other social sciences. Another disadvantage of the theory is that it lacks a research procedure that is sufficiently common to allow for the exchange of research data among investigators. Although different research tools have been developed (see the above review of assessment and research methods), none of them are used by a majority of researchers in the field.\n\nInvestigators often use different research tools which lead to a considerable richness of information but, at the same time, create a stumbling block for the comparison of research data. It seems that the breadth of the theory and the richness of its applications have a shadowy side in the relative isolation of research in the DST subfields. Other researchers find the scientific work done thus far to be of a too verbal nature. While the theory explicitly acknowledges the importance of pre-linguistic, non-linguistic forms of dialogue, the actual research is typically taking place on the verbal level with the simultaneous neglect of the non-verbal level (for a notable exception cultural-anthropological research on shape-shifting). Finally, some researchers would like to see more emphasis on the bodily aspects of dialogue. Up till now the theory has focused almost exclusively on the transcendence of the self-other dualism, as typical of the modern model of the self. More work should be done on the embodied nature of the dialogical self (for the role of the body in connection with emotions).\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2182516", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2182516", "title": "1984 (opera)", "text": "1984 (opera)\n\n1984 is an opera by the American conductor and composer Lorin Maazel, with a libretto by J. D. McClatchy and Thomas Meehan. The opera is based on George Orwell's 1949 dystopian novel, \"Nineteen Eighty-Four.\" It premiered on 3 May 2005 at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden in a production directed by Robert Lepage.\n\n\"1984\" was the first opera composed by Maazel, following a conducting career that spanned more than 50 years; he was 75 years old when his work had its premiere. The opera was originally commissioned by August Everding, the director of the Bavarian State Opera, and Maazel later admitted surprise at the offer. \"I'd never thought of writing an opera, and it took years to convince me,\" he stated in an interview prior to the premiere.\n\nAfter Everding died, it appeared the work might not proceed, but Maazel got it picked up by Covent Garden and the Tokyo Opera. This was to be a joint endeavour, but Tokyo ultimately backed out, leaving it in limbo again. Maazel then stepped in and paid about £400,000 to finance the project through a company he formed for the purpose, Big Brother Productions. By picking up nearly half the costs, he allowed the Royal Opera House to spend what it would for a typical revival from the standard repertoire, rather than a more expensive new production. This saved the opera from oblivion, but also led to charges that the Royal Opera House was spending taxpayer money to support a vanity project.\n\n\nIn contrast with the conventions of most operas, \"1984\" casts the hero, Winston, as a baritone (sung by Simon Keenlyside at the premiere), while the lead tenor takes the role of the villain, O'Brien (sung by Richard Margison at the premiere). The part of Julia was sung by soprano Nancy Gustafson in the original production. Other individual parts in the opera include Syme, Parsons, and Charrington, a gym instructor/drunken woman, a prole woman, and a café singer. Maazel incorporates an important role for the chorus, which sings a \"hate chorus\" for the rallies Orwell called Two Minutes Hate, as well as a rousing \"National Anthem of Oceania.\" The telescreen voice was spoken by Jeremy Irons. The children's chorus was provided by the New London Children's Choir.\n\n\nThe British press reviews for the London premiere were negative. Andrew Clements' review in \"The Guardian\" berated the effort, declaring that it was \"both shocking and outrageous that the Royal Opera, a company of supposed international standards and standing, should be putting on a new opera of such wretchedness and lack of musical worth.\" Andrew Clark of the \"Financial Times\" stated that the \"only reason we find this slick perversion of Orwell on the Covent Garden stage is because super-rich Maazel bought his way there by stumping up the production costs,\" while Rupert Christiansen in the \"Daily Telegraph\" dismissed it as \"operatic fast food.\"\n\nMore sympathetic reviews appeared outside of the British media. \"Newsweek\", which noted that, while the \"score may occasionally sound more like an overblown film soundtrack than the meaty orchestration of an opera,\" the production \"effectively conjures up the dispiriting emptiness of Orwell's awful vision. The unusual and inspired choice of a baritone, Simon Keenlyside, for the lead role of Winston, lends the work a darker edge.\" The Spanish newspaper \"La Vanguardia\" praised Maazel by stating \"the maestro knows a lot of music and he shows it, just as he shows his prowess in orchestral and vocal work.\"\n\nThe opera's Royal Opera House engagement was sold out, as was a later engagement at La Scala in Milan, Italy. \n\nThe production was recorded for DVD release. Since February 2009, the DVD is also available for sale in USA.\n"}
{"id": "2182522", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2182522", "title": "The Virgin Soldiers", "text": "The Virgin Soldiers\n\nThe Virgin Soldiers is a 1966 comic novel by Leslie Thomas, inspired by his own experiences of National Service in the British Army. It was Thomas' debut novel; he had previously published an autobiography. \"The Virgin Soldiers\" sold millions of copies during the author´s lifetime.\n\nThe core of the plot is the romantic triangle formed by the protagonist, a conscript soldier named Private Brigg; a worldly professional soldier named Sergeant Driscoll and Phillipa Raskin, the daughter of the Regimental Sergeant Major. The location is a British army base in Singapore during the Malayan Emergency.\n\nBrigg and Phillipa are virgins in every sense of the word; they're both barely out of adolescence. Brigg is fearful of Phillipa's father and hardly dares go near her. He is equally afraid of the Malay and Chinese prostitutes in the nearby city. His only outlet is with his mates in the barracks, who fantasize endlessly about what they might do without actually knowing how to go ahead and do it.\n\nPhillipa is getting more and more rebellious, eventually setting herself up with Sgt. Driscoll as a lover, while she leads Brigg on in the romance department. Brigg finally summons up the courage and the cash to approach a prostitute, called Juicy Lucy by the troops. The encounter starts disastrously but after Lucy realizes Brigg is a virgin, she takes pity on him and begins his education in her own way. This develops into a long-term relationship, at least for Brigg, who she calls affectionately \"Bligg\". Brigg tries not to think about what Lucy does when he is not with her.\n\nDriscoll is seething with his own inner demons. He keeps taunting a Sgt. Wellbeloved with the phrase \"Rusty nails!\". Wellbeloved boasts constantly of keeping the Japanese busy during WW2, as a one-man guerilla army. Towards the end of the tale, the secret is revealed: Wellbeloved was a coward, and Rusty Nails was the nickname of the soldier he betrayed to the Japanese. Driscoll beats Wellbeloved to a pulp on behalf of the victim.\n\nThe novel crystallizes around violent incidents involving rioting in the city and an attack by Communist guerillas on a train. Several of Brigg's friends are killed. Brigg tries to find Lucy for solace, only to be told she was beaten to death by soldiers. (In the film, the locomotive destroyed was one of the last four used to haul mainline BR steam - the famous Fifteen Guinea Special.) Days before he is to be sent home, he confronts Phillipa with his frustrations, with unexpectedly pleasant results. For Phillipa, however, he is a passing fancy. Her sergeant awaits ...\n\nEventually Brigg and his remaining friends are about to embark for home. The final scene has them shouting the name of a laundryman, whom Brigg has mistakenly shot in the hand in an earlier episode, a certain Fuk Yew. It symbolizes their relation to Malaya and Malaya to them, when the tailor responds with the appropriate hand signal, using his damaged hand.\n\nThe novel was turned into a film in 1969, directed by John Dexter, with a screenplay by the British screenwriter John Hopkins. It starred Hywel Bennett, John Scott, Nigel Patrick and Lynn Redgrave. David Bowie cut his hair short to audition for a role but can only be seen in a brief shot in the finished movie, being pushed out from behind a bar. A sequel, \"Stand Up, Virgin Soldiers\", followed in 1977 with Nigel Davenport repeating his role as Sgt Driscoll.\n"}
{"id": "2182523", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2182523", "title": "David Stremme", "text": "David Stremme\n\nDavid Andrew Stremme (born June 19, 1977) is an American professional stock car racing driver.\n\nStremme was born in South Bend, Indiana. His racing roots can be traced back to Midwestern short track racing, where he followed in the footsteps originally cast by his Great Uncle in the 1950s. Stremme’s first stock car victory came in the early 1990s at New Paris Speedway, while behind the wheel of his mother’s street stock ride. Once track officials realized that he was only 15 years old however, he was forced to temporarily give up driving.\nOnce he reached legal driving age, Stremme moved to the Midwestern short tracks scene. David is an avid race car builder and has a great understanding of the cars he races. Being part of a racing family (father, mother, and brother) racing is his life. During his career, he earned 24 feature wins, two Rookie of the Year titles and two track championships in just four years. From the local tracks, Stremme became a winner in the Kendall Late Model Series and soon joined American Speed Association (ASA), where he was named the 2002 ASA Rookie of the Year.\n\nDuring 1998, 1999, and 2000, Stremme raced for the ISES Performance Group, Inc. The team was made up of Stremme's racing friends and sponsored by Industrial Safety and Environmental Services, Inc. New cars were purchased and Stremme initiated alliances with top suppliers of engines, chassis, and shock manufacturers.\n\nIn only his first start in a Kendall Late Model Series car completely assembled by Stremme at Winchester Speedway, he set a new track record and finished 4th in the race. Subsequent to this event an even larger strategy was set forth. Under the direction of Tris Gour, President, Industrial Safety and Environmental Services, Inc. a new car was purchased to compete in the NASCAR November Phoenix International Raceway race. The new car was completely built by David with help from friends. It was the first time the team had ventured significantly far away from home.\n\nAs a budget did not allow for crew chiefs or fabricators, Gour and Stremme formed an alliance with Robert Hamke. Hamke is a well renowned chassis builder, racer, and crew chief. Although the car built was not a Hamke Chassis, Hamke accepted the opportunity to work with Stremme and the crew, and accepted the challenge based upon reference from Performance Technologies (engine builders) and the owner of LeftHander Chassis. Hamke had a great respect for the owner of LeftHander. In addition, Performance Technologies had built several engines for both chassis builders (Hamke and Lefthander) clients.\n\nWhile at Phoenix, the team qualified fourth and led several laps during the race. Stremme led the majority of the race and was passed on the last lap coming out of turn three by Scott Hansen. Subsequent to the race, it was found that Hansen was disqualified as his car was equipped with an illegal carburetor spacer plate giving him an unfair horsepower advantage.\n\nThe local news media reported on this issue but only a financial penalty was given to Hansen. Although upset by the loss, the ISES Performance Group, Inc. and Stremme had gained the respect of the Hansen Group. Hansen later called upon Stremme to race his car at Winchester due to a conflict with his racing schedule.\n\nAfter signing a driver development contract with Chip Ganassi Racing, Stremme started 15th in his Busch Series debut at Nashville Superspeedway in April 2003, driving the No. 1 Dodge for Phoenix Racing, and finished 7th in the race. He finished 14th in both of his next two starts, before coming to 6th at Nazareth Speedway. He led 32 laps in that race, which were the first in his career.\n\nHe finished 4th after starting 3rd at Nashville in June, and duplicated the result at the Milwaukee Mile. He had a 10th at Kentucky and a 9th at Memphis. Stremme's worst finish that year was a 31st at Dover. Due to a contract obligation, Finch had Jamie McMurray back in the car for the final two races, and Stremme moved to Braun Racing for the remaining two races. Stremme led 48 laps at Rockingham, finishing 5th, and additionally drove the No. 30 Sport Clips Dodge home in 14th. His strong finishes in his part-time schedule was enough to secure him the 2003 Busch Series Rookie of the Year award, despite competing in only 18 of the 34 races.\n\nStremme raced in the No. 32 TrimSpa Dodge Intrepid in 2004. Stremme started 4th and finished 6th in the season opener at Daytona International Speedway. Despite winning his first career pole at Milwaukee, and finishing that up with a second, Stremme's team began to run mid-pack with a handful of top-10s mixed in. \nBraun Racing then made the announcement that they were going to replace Stremme with Shane Hmiel, who was just coming off a suspension. Ganassi then made a deal with FitzBradshaw Racing to secure Stremme a ride. For the remainder of the 2004 season, Stremme was to replace Casey Atwood in FitzBradshaw's U.S. Navy-sponsored No. 14 Chevrolet. For the next season, FitzBradshaw's team would begin running Dodges and Stremme would be retained to drive the No. 14 full-time. In 2005, Stremme posted five top-five finishes and finishing 13th in points, when it was announced he would run full-time in the Nextel Cup Series.\n\nIn June 2005, Stremme made his Cup debut in 2005 driving Ganassi's R&D No. 39 Navy Dodge at Chicagoland Speedway. He started 31st and would finish 16th in his debut. He also had finishes of 42nd at Richmond and Miami, and a 36th at Charlotte. Ganassi announced Stremme would go to the Cup series, driving the No. 40 Coors Light Dodge in 2006.\n\nIn 2006, Stremme had a best finish of 11th at New Hampshire International Speedway and Homestead-Miami Speedway. He finished 33rd in points after missing both road course races that season. In addition, he made his Craftsman Truck Series debut at Martinsville Speedway, finishing 32nd in the No. 04 Dodge for Bobby Hamilton Racing. In addition, he won his first career ARCA RE/MAX Series race at Michigan International Speedway, driving the No. 61 Hantz Group Dodge for Rusty Wallace. Despite solid equipment with Ganassi, Stremme failed to notch a single top 10 in 34 races.\n\nStremme followed up his disastrous rookie season with another poor season in 2007. He started 2007 starting 6th in the 49th annual Daytona 500 and went on to finish 11th. Three weeks later he would get his best career start, 2nd in the UAW-DaimlerChrysler 400 at Las Vegas Motor Speedway. In the Samsung 500 at Texas Motor Speedway he would get his first career Top 10 finish. Two weeks later he would follow that up with a career best finish, 8th in the Aaron's 499 at Talladega Superspeedway. During that season, Stremme shared driving duties of the No. 41 Wrigley Dodge Charger in the Busch Series with Ganassi teammate Reed Sorenson. It ran numerous paint schemes including Wrigley's Spearmint, Doublemint, Juicy Fruit, and Winterfresh. He was able to get his second career Busch pole at Nashville but ended up 11th in the race. In addition, he drove a part-time schedule in the No. 22 Supercuts Dodge for Fitz Motorsports.\n\nHe was replaced in the No. 40 Dodge by Dario Franchitti 2008 after the 2007 Indy 500 Champion was signed to drive in Sprint Cup. Stremme returned to the Nationwide Series driving for Rusty Wallace Racing, in the No. 64 Atreus Homes & Communities Chevrolet. He was originally scheduled to run a handful of races, with Chase Austin and Max Papis driving the rest of the year, but after starting the season in the top-15 in points, the schedule was modified to allow him to run every race except the road course events. He had five top-fives and sixteen top-tens, on his way to an eleventh-place points finish. In the latter portion of the year, Atreus left the team, and AVIS, Loan Star Title Loans, and the Penske Corporation became the team's new primary sponsors. He drove the No. 15 Hyprene Ergon Toyota Tundra in two Truck races that season as well, in addition to returning to the No. 40 Sprint Cup team, filling for the injured Franchitti at Talladega.\n\nIn 2009, Stremme signed to drive the No. 12 car for Penske Racing full-time in the Sprint Cup Series, replacing Ryan Newman who moved to the No. 39 car for Stewart Haas Racing. The team lost its sponsor when Verizon Wireless bought Alltel, thus negating the grandfather clause. The car was blanked similar to the Penske used in the IRL, censoring their Phillip Morris USA sponsorship with \"Team Penske\". Stremme nearly won the 2009 AMP Energy 500 running near the front for the lead, but a green-white checkered ruined his day, causing him to run out of gas. Throughout Stremme's season, he did not score a single top 10 and missed the Texas race and failed to qualify for the Homestead race driving for James Finch in the No. 09 car. Stremme was released from the contract on November 3, because their new driver for 2010, Brad Keselowski, was finished with his prior contract agreements with Hendrick Motorsports. His 2009 was incredibly poor; the No. 12 Penske team went from contending for wins with former driver Newman to rarely cracking the top 20 with Stremme.\n\nStremme attempted sixteen races with Latitude 43 Motorsports in 2010, failing to make five. Stremme attempted a select number of races with newly formed Inception Motorsports in the No. 30 Chevrolet in 2011, along with a limited Nationwide Series schedule with ML Motorsports. He ran in the Sprint Cup Series for 2012 with Inception Motorsports, switching to Toyotas.\n\nFor 2013, Stremme returned to the No. 30, now Swan Racing Company, with the exception of the Daytona 500 where Michael Waltrip drove the car, renumbered for the event with No. 26. Unlike Inception Motorsports, where Stremme was a start and park driver, Swan Racing has full sponsorship.\n\nIn the Camping World Truck Series inaugural running of the Mudsummer Classic at Eldora Speedway, Stremme served as the spotter for Ken Schrader.\n\nAfter only recording four top-20 finishes in the first 26 races in 2013, Stremme was released by Swan Racing following the September race at Richmond International Raceway, being replaced by Cole Whitt.\n\nStremme was signed by Circle Sport to run the No. 33 beginning at the STP 500 at Martinsville. He attempted 12 races before being released, and has not raced in NASCAR since then.\n\nIn 2014, Stremme founded Lethal Chassis, a dirt modified builder.\n\nStremme is married to Ashley Stremme, a model whose career in that included being Mrs. North Carolina and then Mrs. United States in 2016. She has also competed in the Better Half Dash (a charity race featuring NASCAR drivers' wives driving go-karts on the infield mini-oval at Charlotte), winning the 2013 race. She also hosts two racing radio shows, Slingin' Dirt (on Motor Racing Network) and Winged Nation.\n\n Season still in progress <br>\n\n"}

Raylessness in \"Pentaphragma\" can be described in terms of secondary woodiness or paedomorphosis.

Lewis earned a degree in mechanical engineering from Old Dominion University in Norfolk, Virginia. After his racing career, he earned his MBA from the Fuqua School of Business at Duke University. As of March 2013, he is Chief Operating Officer for First Team Automotive Group in Chesapeake Virginia.\n\nLewis was a driver who was especially good on road courses. He started out in the Barber Saab Pro Series for the 1992 Season. After success in that series and was offered a scholarship to race in the British Formula Ford championship.\n\nLewis made his Busch debut in 1993, long before he became known to most Busch fans. Driving the No. 36 Parkway Pontiac at Watkins Glen, Lewis started the race in 29th place. The team had mechanical issues partway through the race, but Lewis got back on track and finished the race in 27th place.\n\nLewis returned once again to the series in 1994. This time, Lewis drove the No. 80 Commerce Bank Chevy at Milwaukee Mile. Lewis was able to top his debut with a 24th-place effort, despite a 38th place start.\n\nLewis again made a one-off start in 1995. He had his best weekend at that point in his career, this time back at Watkins Glen. He started the race solidly in the 22nd position and stayed on the lead lap with a 13th-place finishing result.\n\nLewis raced in eight races in 1996 and earned a 3rd-place finish at Watkins Glen. He led three laps during the race, the first laps led of his Busch Series career.\n\nLewis did not compete in 1999, but came back in 2000, with a new family owned No. 46 Chevy. He completed an 11-race schedule with a best finish of 17th at Michigan. \n\nWith a decent first year under their belt, Lewis Motorsports ran all but one race in 2001, leading to a 20th place standing in points. Lewis earned three top-10s in 2001: A pair of fifths at Kentucky and Charlotte and a ninth at Memphis, an impressive feat without a full-time sponsor. Lewis earned his best start of 2001 at Las Vegas, with a 5th place starting position. However, Lewis struggled to finish races and had nine DNFs.\n\nYet, the team was optimistic. The team would run 2002 with new sponsor Civil Air Patrol. Lewis only had one top-5, but it was a solid one. Lewis started 24th at his home track of Richmond International Raceway but certainly ran well, moving to a 2nd-place finish. In addition, Lewis earned a triplet of 8th and another triplet of 9th. Lewis was also qualifying well, with 5 top-10 starts, the best being a 3rd at IRP. The only reason that Lewis finished a lowly 17th was simple: a series-high 12 DNFs.\n\nLewis set out to better his season in 2003 and did it well. Cutting down his DNFs to five led to a 12th-place finish in points. The highlight of his season came at Gateway. He won the pole and led forty-four laps and was running fifth when Randy Lajoie crashed in front of him and led to a 33rd-place finish. However, Ashton did have better overall finishes. He had two top-5s with a 3rd at Nashville and a 5th at Homestead-Miami. Lewis also tacked on eight other top-10 finishes, to have ten top-10 finishes in 2003.\n\nThe team lost CAP after 2003, however, and the team could not attract a sponsor for 2004. The team would end up running the whole season, but Lewis' family team had to shut down following the season. Yet, Lewis made one great swan song at the end of the season. A late-season surge put Lewis in position to win races. That was apparent at Darlington, where Lewis ran a specially painted tribute car to a second-place finish, barely losing to Jamie McMurray. Even though there was some sadness in the team's hearts, Lewis finished 8th place in points, his first career top-10 \n\nLewis would drive the No. 25 Marines Ford in 2005 and 2006 for Ed Rensi. Lewis finished the 2005 campaign 14th in points. The 2006 season yielded a disappointing 15th place finish in points. Lewis ended his NASCAR career after the 2006 season having competed in 226 Busch Series races over 11 different seasons.\n"}

He entered his first auto race in 1981 at the \"24 Hours of Mexico\" and at the age of 15 he made the permanent move to cars in 1982. From 1982 to 1984 Fernández competed in the Formula Vee Championship taking the title in '83 and '84. He also raced in the Formula K Series in 1984, competing in that series through 1986. He finished in the top four in the standings all three years in Formula K.\n\nIn 1987, he ran one race in the Benelux Formula Ford 1600 Championship, one British RAC Formula Ford 1600 Championship race and competed in the Formula Ford Festival at Brands Hatch. From 1988-89 he ran the British RAC and Esso Formula Ford 1600 Championship series before moving to the Mexican F3 Championship for 1990 and 1991, winning the title in '91.\n\nIn 1992, Fernández came to the United States to compete in the Firestone Indy Lights Championship (now the PPG-Dayton Indy Lights Championship). He finished third in the points winning four races, a rookie record, and took the \"Indy Lights Rookie of the Year\" honors and made more than two million dollars in prize earnings.\n\nHis talent apparent, Fernández made the jump to the CART IndyCar World Series in 1993, competing in five races for Galles Racing International. He ran his first full CART season in 1994 with Galles finishing 13th and capturing the \"Marco Magaña\" and \"Luchador Olmeca\" awards and the \"JAC\" trophy for \"Best Driver\" outside Mexico. Competing again with Galles in 1995, Fernández finished 12th in the standings placing in the top ten nine times.\n\nFernández moved to Tasman Motorsports in 1996. He had six top ten finishes, including his first career CART victory at Toronto. Unfortunately his delight at taking his first win was dampened by the fatal accident suffered by Jeff Krosnoff late in the race. The win in Toronto made him the first Mexican to win a CART event since Héctor Rebaque in 1982, and Fernández went on to finish 12th in the season points tally. However, 1997 was a disappointing season for Fernández. The Tasman team ran a Lola chassis which failed to perform to expectations. Through force of will, determination and talent, Fernández battled to three top ten finishes and 18th place in the PPG Cup standings.\n\nFernández joined Patrick Racing for the 1998 season and proved his ability to challenge for the championship. He enjoyed 14 top ten finishes with eight top five placements and two victories, Japan and Mid-Ohio, en route to a fourth place showing in the PPG Cup race during the 1998 FedEx Championship. He captured his first career pole at Michigan and led the championship race for the first time in his career. Unfortunately once again Fernández was touched by tragedy — a crash at Michigan resulted in an errant wheel from his car flying into the stands and killing three spectators. However, it was his victory during the Miller Lite 200 that gave Patrick Racing one of its most memorable moments when Fernández stood atop the podium next to his teammate Scott Pruett. Fernández was also named the \"Athlete of the Year\" in Mexico.\n\nIn 1999, enjoying his most successful season so far in the CART series, Adrián Fernández behind the wheel of the #40 Tecate/Quaker State Reynard Ford-Cosworth completed the year sixth in the championship battle. He led the points series early in the season for the first time in his CART career, however an accident at Detroit resulted in a fracture in one of his hands, forcing him to sit out for several races. However he won at Motegi, Japan at the Firestone Firehawk 500 and at the Marlboro 500 at Fontana, California — a race marred by the death of good friend Greg Moore. In addition, he was selected to participate in the IROC series during 1999 where he competed against other top-named drivers including NASCAR drivers Jeff Gordon, Terry Labonte and Dale Earnhardt. Fernández solid racing career which began in 1993, now has 80 total starts in the series. Of those starts he has finished in the top ten 41 times throughout his seven-year career.\nIn 2000 Fernández had his best season in the CART series, coming close to winning the championship despite not starting on the front row all season. He scored points in 17 of the 20 races including 2 wins at Rio de Janeiro, Brazil and Australia, and 3 further podium results. He finished second to Gil de Ferran in the championship.\n\nIn 2001 he founded Fernandez Racing, with former Ganassi manager Tom Anderson as his partner, and ex-F1 driver Shinji Nakano as his teammate. He finished 3rd twice and took 2 poles that year, but his team's first victory came at Portland in 2003, the first win for an owner-driver since Bobby Rahal achieved the feat in 1992. That year he also ran an IRL entry for Asian-American Roger Yasukawa, in partnership with Aguri Suzuki, and for 2004 he moved the whole team to the series. Despite taking 3 wins and 4th overall in the 2004 IRL, he was unable to secure funding to race in 2005 - Delphi was driver Scott Sharp's personal sponsor while engine suppliers Honda insisted on Japanese driver Kosuke Matsuura in the second car.\n\nIn 2005 he drove the No. 5 Lowe's / Hitachi Chevrolet in Mexico for Hendrick Motorsports in the first NASCAR Busch Series race held outside the United States. In this race, (called the Telcel-Motorola 200) Fernández raced in a one time ride to help promote NASCAR racing to the local fans. He led several laps in the race before giving up the lead to eventual race winner Martin Truex Jr.. It was announced that he would run 4 more races in the Busch Series for Hendrick Motorsports, but he did not run up front at any of those races. In 2006 he competed in 2 Busch races for Hendrick and competed full-time in the Grand-Am series for his own team with Lowe's sponsorship.\n\nIn 2007, Fernández moved the team to the American Le Mans Series LMP2 class as an Acura factory team. His teammate was fellow Mexican and Grand-Am veteran Luis Díaz.\n\nOn October 10, 2009, Fernández and his co-driver Luis Díaz won at the Mazda Raceway Laguna Seca in Monterey, California. With this victory the Lowe's Fernandez Racing Acura ARX-01B concludes the season with the drivers' championship and teams' championship of the American Le Mans Series in the LMP2 category.\n\nIn the 2007 Fernández debuts with a second place in the LMP2 category in the famous race with the Barazi-Epsilon team Zytek aboard a 07S/2 a 3.4-liter V8 prototype. His teammates were Haruki Kurosawa and Robbie Kerr. This was the first podium of a Mexican at the Circuit de la Sarthe in many years to remember those achieved by Ricardo and Pedro Rodríguez in 1962 and 1968 respectively. The English-French team took pole position on its category.\nAfter three years of absence Fernández back in the 2010 now competing in LMP1 class with Aston Martin Racing finished fifth in his category (sixth absolute) with a Lola-Aston Martin B09/60, his co-drivers were Harold Primat and Stefan Mücke.\n\nThe luck did not favor Adrian in 2011, when his team the Aston Martin Racing in LMP1 class can barely afford 2 laps with their Aston Martin AMR-One and leave the test due to problems with the engine running at the 56th site.\n\nIn the 80th., edition of the 2012, Fernández and the Aston Martin Racing Team got the third place in the GTE-Pro class along with his co-drivers the Stefan Mücke and Darren Turner, their Aston Martin Vantage 4.5 L-V8 covered a total of 332 laps (2,811.65 miles), in the Circuit de la Sarthe without failure or serious mechanical problems. Also the team achieved the fastest lap of the category with 3 minutes and 54,928 seconds. Adrián had the honor to drive the last stage of the competition.\n\nOn September 12, 2012 Fernández announced that his participation in the FIA World Endurance Championship concludes at the end of the season, as well his relationship with the Aston Martin Racing team that started in 2010. The Mexican driver will focus on competitions in the United States.\n\nOn September 28, 2012 Formula One driver Sergio Pérez announced that Férnandez will be his manager.\n\nOn September 20, 2016 Fernández's achievements have been recognised by the naming of Turn 12 of the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez in his honour.\n\nFernández retired from motorsports in 2012.

He is the father of racers Casey and Corey LaJoie.\n\nLaJoie started racing go-karts when he was 11.5 years old. In 1980 he began racing in full-bodied racecars. He was the 1981 track champion in the sportsman division at the Danbury Fair Racearena. When Danbury closed that off-season, he moved to the Waterford Speedbowl where he won modified rookie of the year honors in 1982.\n\nIn 1983 he moved to the NASCAR North Tour, and he was the series' rookie of the year. That season, he made his first attempt at making the Daytona 500, but did not qualify. One year later, he suffered a horrific crash in the Gatorade Twin 125's race and failed to qualify once again, he won the consolation race the following year. In 1985 he scored five victories in the North Tour on his way to the series championship; LaJoie was not awarded the championship until 1988, as a lawsuit regarding a disqualification at Catamount Speedway was not resolved until then.\n\nLaJoie made his NASCAR Winston Cup debut in 1985 at Atlanta Motor Speedway. Driving the No. 07 Snellman Construction-sponsored Chevrolet owned by Bob Johnson, he started 16th and finished 14th. He ran his next race the following season at Pocono Raceway, where he finished 29th after suffering engine failure. He also made his Busch Series debut that season, running four races in his own No. 03 Pontiac, posting a tenth-place finish at Charlotte Motor Speedway. He ran another race in 1987 at Dover International Speedway and finished 10th. After a third-place finish the following season, he joined Frank Cicci Racing mid-way through 1989 and had a career-best second-place run at Hickory Motor Speedway. He ended the season 26th in points.\n\nHe did not return to Cicci in 1990, and ran a handful of Busch Races in his own No. 71, his best finish was 23rd at Richmond. He did not run another NASCAR-sanctioned race until 1993, when he got selected to run the No. 20 Fina car owned by Dick Moroso at Talladega. This would turn out to be a shrewd career move for LaJoie as he ran up front with the leaders all afternoon and finished a surprising second. This got LaJoie five more races for Moroso and one for BACE Motorsports in the Busch Series. His best finish was second, twice. In 1994, he was a thought by some to be a dark horse for the championship. He drove for Moroso full-time in the No. 20 Fina Lube-sponsored Chevy that season posting seven Top 10’s. LaJoie led the point standings early in the season before a string of poor results, also a lack of performance dropped him to 16th in the final point standings. He also ran three Cup races, finishing in the Top 20 in all three of them that season.\n\nIn 1995, LaJoie was called up to the Cup series again, driving the No. 22 MBNA-sponsored Pontiac Grand Prix for Bill Davis Racing. LaJoie ran 13 races for Davis in his rookie season before he was released midway through the year. Following his departure, he returned to Busch to drive the No. 64 for Dennis Shoemaker. He had three top-tens and a pole at Richmond in nine starts. The following season, he was hired by BACE Motorsports to drive its No. 74 entry. LaJoie won five races over the course of the season and clinched his first Busch Series championship. He followed that up with another five wins and his second straight championship in 1997. After falling back to fourth in the standings in 1998, as well as dealing with a feud with team owner Bill Baumgardner, LaJoie left BACE at the end of the season. He returned to the Cup series that season driving nine races for Hendrick Motorsports.\n\nHe signed to drive the No. 1 Chevrolet Monte Carlo for James Finch in 1999, despite the fact that the team lacked major sponsorship. After a season-opening victory at the NAPA Auto Parts 300, Bob Evans Restaurants came on board as the team's sponsor. Despite the added funding, LaJoie dropped to tenth in points. He moved up to seventh in the standings the next season with one win, but chose to depart the team at the end of the season for NEMCO Motorsports. Driving the No. 7 with a sponsorship from Kleenex, LaJoie won two more races but again fell to 12th in points. He had 14 Top 10 finishes in 2002 and moved up one spot in the points.\n\nLaJoie returned to the No. 7 team in 2003, and won two poles, but was dismissed from the ride midway through the season. He filled out the year with one race apiece for Innovative Motorsports and FitzBradshaw Racing, as well as a Craftsman Truck race for Kevin Harvick Incorporated. He began the 2004 season in FitzBradshaw's No. 82 car and ran five races with a best finish of 13th, before moving on, running one race each for Marsh Racing and Tommy Baldwin Racing. He also teamed with HT Motorsports in the Craftsman Truck Series for six races, finishing eighth at Gateway. In the Cup series, he had a 43rd-place finish for Hover Motorsports at Richmond, and also ran two races in the No. 98 Ford Taurus for Mach 1 Racing, his best finish being 36th.\n\nMach 1 switched to the No. 34 Chevy in 2005, and he began the season with them before he was released. He reunited with Cicci in the Busch Series with Dollar General sponsorship and posted three top-10 finishes, finishing 19th in points. Dollar General left the team at season's end, leaving LaJoie without a full-time ride. He had signed to drive for Mach 1, which was under new management again in 2005, but was replaced early in the season by teammate Chad Chaffin. He drove one race apiece in the Busch Series for Davis Motorsports, Jay Robinson Racing, and Vision Racing. He also was a test driver for Richard Childress Racing, filling in for Kevin Harvick in the No. 21 United States Coast Guard Chevy during practice and qualifying sessions.\n\nLaJoie has not run a NASCAR-sanctioned race since 2006, focusing on team ownership for his son Corey, who finished second in the 2012 K&N Pro Series East championship to Kyle Larson despite five wins in the series.\n\nIn 2016, LaJoie was inducted into the New England Auto Racers Hall of Fame.\n\nIn addition to his racing seat business, LaJoie was also a part-time co-host of \"The Driver's Seat\" with John Kernan on Sirius Satellite Radio's NASCAR channel 128. He also did television commentary for the ORP and Montreal Busch Series races.\n\nOn June 22, 2010, LaJoie was suspended indefinitely from NASCAR for violating their substance abuse policy while working as a crewman on the No. 18 Nationwide Series car. He had smoked marijuana with some race fans following the Coca-Cola 600 in Charlotte and took responsibility for his actions. On August 25, 2010, LaJoie was reinstated by NASCAR after a two-month suspension.\n\n"}

The mandibular nerve is a branch of the trigeminal nerve, and the mandibular nerve exits the skull through the foramen ovale. These roots encircle the middle meningeal artery (a branch of the mandibular part of the maxillary artery, which is in turn a terminal branch of the external carotid artery). The roots encompass the middle meningeal artery then converge to form a single nerve.\n\nThe auriculotemporal nerve passes between the neck of the mandible and the sphenomandibular ligament, gives off parotid branches and then turns superiorly, posterior to its head and moving anteriorly, gives off anterior branches to the auricle. It then crosses over the root of the zygomatic process of the temporal bone, deep to the superficial temporal artery.\n\nThe \"somatosensory root (superior)\" originates from branches of the mandibular nerve (cranial nerve V), which pass through the otic ganglion without synapsing. Then they form the somatosensory (superior) root of the auriculotemporal nerve. The two roots re-unite, and shortly after the branching of secretomotor fibers to the parotid gland (parotid branches), the auriculotemporal nerve comprises exclusively somatosensory fibers, which ascend to the superficial temporal region. There, it supplies the auricle, external acoustic meatus, outer side of the tympanic membrane and the skin in the temporal region (superficial temporal branches). It also carries a few articular branches that go on to supply the temporomandibular joint.\n\nThe \"parasympathetic root (inferior)\" carries postganglionic fibers to the parotid gland. These parasympathetic, preganglionic secretomotor fibers originate from the glossopharyngeal nerve (CN IX) as one of its branches, the tympanic nerve, which enters the tympanic cavity through the inferior tympanic canaliculus. The tympanic nerve and postganglionic sympathetic fibers, which come with the arteries-related head, make the tympanic plexus on the promontorium. This plexus gives off the lesser petrosal nerve. This nerve synapses in the otic ganglion and its postganglionic fibers form the inferior, parasympathetic root of the auriculotemporal nerve. The two roots re-unite and shortly after the \"united\" auriculotemporal branch gives off parotid branches, which serve as secretomotor fibers for the parotid gland.\n\nThis nerve as it courses posteriorly to the condylar head, is frequently injured in temporomandibular joint (TMJ) surgery, causing an ipsilateral paresthesia of the auricle and skin surrounding the ear. It is the main nerve that supplies the TMJ, along with branches of the masseteric nerve and the deep temporal.\n\nAfter a parotidectomy, the nerves from the Auriculotemporal Nerve that previously innervated the parotid gland can reattach to the sweat glands in the same region. The result is sweating along the cheek with the consumption of foods (Frey's syndrome). Treatment involves the application of an antiperspirant or glycopyrrolate to the cheek, Jacobsen's neurectomy along the middle ear promontory, and lifting of the skin flap with the placement of a tissue barrier (harvested or cadaveric) to interrupt the misguided innervation of the sweat glands.\n\nPain from parotitis, a condition that can be caused by mumps, will be carried by the auriculotemporal nerve and great auricular nerve to the brain.\n\n\n"}

Green (born January 28, 1958) is an American former stock car racing driver, who currently works as a NASCAR official. While driving, he won the 1994 NASCAR Busch Series championship. His two younger brothers, Jeff and Mark have also competed in the NASCAR circuit.\n\nGreen, born in Owensboro, Kentucky, made his debut in 1989 at Hickory Motor Speedway for Day Enterprise Racing, starting 15th but finishing 30th after suffering an engine failure. He ran two more races the next year, suffering transmission failure in both races. In 1991, Green signed up with FILMAR Racing to drive the No. 8, and made an immediate impact, winning the pole position at the season-opening Goody's 300. Despite failing to qualify for two of the first seven races, Green won in just his 12th start at Lanier Raceway. He would finish runner-up to Jeff Gordon for Rookie of the Year. Surprisingly, Green was fired from the ride, and spent the 1992 season working as a member of Bobby Labonte's pit crew. When Labonte moved to Winston Cup in 1993, Green took over the team's No. 44 ride. Although he did not win, he finished in the top ten 16 times and finished third in the points. The next year, he won the Goody's 250, nine poles, as well as the Busch Series championship. Green stayed with Labonte Racing and won four more poles in 1995, but dropped to twelfth in points.\n\nAfter the 1995 season, Green was offered a contract from Buzz McCall, owner of the new American Equipment Racing team. Running the No. 95, Green returned to his former dominance, winning twice and finishing runner-up to Randy LaJoie in the championship chase. At the end of the season, McCall and Green elevated their operation to Winston Cup, this time as the No. 96 driver. Unfortunately, they were not able to duplicate their success, as Green failed to qualify for six races, and could only manage a best finish of 16th at the Coca-Cola 600. Despite this, he still finished runner-up to Mike Skinner for Rookie of the Year. Meanwhile, Green also served as a fill-in driver for Dale Earnhardt at Watkins Glen International in the event Earnhardt could not continue running after suffering injuries in a crash at Talladega Superspeedway. However, Earnhardt ran the full distance, and Green did not need to step in. After he could not manage a higher finish than 17th at Talladega Superspeedway in 1998, Green was fired from the 96 ride. Green returned to the Busch Series to drive the No. 36 Pontiac Grand Prix for Team 34. He drove for the rest of the year, and finished in the top-five in his first six races for the team. Late in the season, he received a call from Larry Hedrick Motorsports, who had been struggling following the release of Steve Grissom from their No. 41 Chevy. Green would run four races for Hedrick for the rest of the year, and signed to drive for them in 1999. In addition, he would run the No. 41 car in the Busch Series for Hedrick on a limited schedule. Still, Green continued to struggle, but had the lowest DNQ count (2) in his career.\n\nAs the season began to close, Green signed on for the rest of the season with Tyler Jet Motorsports, and enjoyed the best performance of his career, finishing a career-best 12th at Phoenix International Raceway, then won the pole the next race at the inaugural Pennzoil 400. Green did well in the Busch Series, running seventeen races and having seven top-tens and a pole position. He ran the Bud Shootout in 2000 in a car owned by Jackie Joyner-Kersee, and hoped to run the Daytona 500, but sponsorship problems forced that deal to fall through. Green would fill in for an injured Bill Elliott for two races later on that season, with a best finish of twenty-fifth.\n\nIn 2000, Green returned to Team 34. That year, he had eleven top-ten finishes, and then six more the following year. At the end of that season, Green was left without a permanent ride. After a few part-time rides, Green finished out the season with Hendrick Motorsports, replacing Ricky Hendrick in the No. 5. That performance gave Green a brief return to Cup, running two races in Hendrick's R&D car. During the season, he also worked in Winston Cup as a spotter for Dale Jarrett.\n\nIn 2003, Green signed with Brewco Motorsports, and returned to his winning form, as he visited victory lane three times, and finishing second in points. He would not win in 2004, but he did run another Cup race at Richmond for Brewco, finishing 31st. In 2005, Green won at Pikes Peak and had an eighth-place finish in points. After failing to finish in the top-five during the 2006, Green was released from Brewco in the closing part of the season. He drove for Riley D'Hondt Motorsports in a part-time schedule in 2007, making three starts with a best finish of eleventh. He also drove seven races in the 2007 season for Red Horse Racing in the Craftsman Truck Series, finishing fifth at Kentucky Speedway. He spent 2008 as a test driver for JR Motorsports, and ran the final race of the season in the No. 0 JD Motorsports Chevy. He signed up to drive the new No. 07 SK Motorsports team in 2009 full-time, but was released after several races. Green made one start in 2010 driving the No. 49 Chevy at Phoenix. In 2011, Green became the spotter for Bobby Labonte. He is also the spotter for Johanna Long in the Nationwide Series. Green now works for NASCAR as an official.\n"}

After a gap year in Bremen, in north-western Germany, he studied History for three years at Balliol College at the University of Oxford, followed by the École Normale Supérieure in Paris. This was followed by another three years at Balliol, at which he pursued doctoral studies in the history of socio-biology and eugenic thinking on the political left, though he did not finish his degree.\n\nRogers successfully applied for a place on the civil service's 'fast track', and chose the Department of Health and Social Security. In 1992, he was seconded to the Treasury and did not return to his former department. He served in the Treasury, including as Private Secretary, to Kenneth Clarke, Chancellor of the Exchequer. He then was seconded to the European Commission as Chief of Staff to Sir Leon Brittan, returning to be Director, European Strategy and Policy and later Director of Budget and Public Finances under Gordon Brown.\n\nIn 2003, Rogers was chosen to succeed Jeremy (later Sir Jeremy) Heywood as the Principal Private Secretary to the Prime Minister, Tony Blair. After three years in this role, Rogers left the civil service in 2006 to become Head of the UK Public Sector Group at Citigroup. In 2010 Rogers transferred to be Head of the Public Sector Industry Group, UK and Ireland, at Barclays Capital from 2010 to 2011.\n\nIn 2012, Rogers returned to the civil service as the Prime Minister's Adviser for Europe and Global Issues and the Head of the European and Global Issues Secretariat, based in the Prime Minister's Office at Number 10, replacing Jon Cunliffe who had become the senior British diplomat at the EU. On Cunliffe's move to the Bank of England the next year, Rogers succeeded him again, moving to Brussels in 2013.\n\nAs of 2015, Rogers was paid a salary of between £170,000 and £174,999 by the Foreign Office, making him one of the 328 most highly paid people in the British public sector at that time.\n\nFollowing the Brexit referendum in June 2016, Rogers became a key civil servant in the negotiations to leave.\n\nIn December 2016, an internal memo Rogers had written suggesting difficulties for agreement was leaked. According to this leaked memo, Sir Ivan privately held the view that a settlement between the UK and the European Union might not be reached for 10 years, if at all, which did not reflect the Government's view. Questions were raised in the press whether Downing Street could any longer have confidence in his advice. He resigned on 3 January 2017, nine months ahead of the nominal end of his posting in October 2017.\n\nOn 11 October 2018, in Cambridge, Rogers delivered a lecture on \"Brexit as Revolution\", in which he said that he continued to think that the risks of an accidental \"no deal\" Brexit caused by persistent British misreading of others' incentives and views, and by the EU's frequent inability to comprehend UK politics, were higher than was in the price.\n\nIn a lecture that Rogers delivered on 13 December 2018 at the University of Liverpool he said that the EU was always adroit at reframing things that have already been agreed, such as the \"backstop\", in ways that \"make the medicine slip down\".\n\nRogers was very critical of the strategy pursued by the British team in their negotiations with the EU following the triggering of Article 50. On 4 March 2019, while speaking to the Institute for Government, he pointed out the similarities in the tactics adopted by Theresa May's government and the tactics used by David Cameron's government in their renegotiations with the EU prior to the 2016 referendum. He said that May and her advisers' approach was to attempt to deal directly with the leaders of the major governments within the EU but the \"reflex in the British system (is) always to think that we can deal direct with the organ grinders and not the monkeys: it never works like that. It didn't work like that in the Cameron renegotiation either. That stuff is not done in the way British politics works, leader to leader. It's done via the bureaucrats, and the sherpas, and the people at the top of the institutions.\"\n\n\nRogers was appointed Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (KCMG) in the 2016 New Year Honours.\n\n\n"}

He is also the current spotter of the No. 42 car driven by Matt Kenseth.\n\nIn 1988, Raines competed in five ASA races, and then returned for his rookie year in 1989. In 1990, Raines moved to NASCAR's All Pro Series, where he won Rookie of the Year and finished fourth in the final standings.\n\nHe returned to ASA in 1991 for a four-year stint as driver of a new team formed by Ernie Roselli. In 1995, he joined veteran crew chief Howie Lettow and Baker Motorsports. That in turn led to the 1996 championship and Raines' first major NASCAR ride.\n\nRaines entered the 1997 season with a full-time ride, running for Rookie of the Year honors in the No. 19 Pennzoil-sponsored Ford F-150 for Kurt Roehrig. After failing to qualify for the first race of the season, Raines came back to win the seventh race of the season at I-70 Speedway. He finished 15th in points and ended the season with two Top 5’s and seven Top 10’s, as well as two outside-pole positions. In 1998, he won three races (I-70, Louisville and Texas) and earned sixth additional Top 5’s with 15 Top 10’s, ending the season fifth in the standings.\n\nIn 1999, Roehrig lost the Pennzoil sponsorship, causing Raines to look elsewhere. This resulted in his move up to the Busch Series, signing with the No. 74 BACE Motorsports team. Raines raced 31 times during the season, with the exception of the Coca-Cola 300, in which Steve Grissom drove. Without a primary sponsorship, Raines had a best finish of fourth and finished 12th in points, capturing the Rookie of the Year honors. In 1999, he made one start in the Truck Series at The Milwaukee Mile for Gerry Gunderman in the No. 68 truck in 1999 when Raines started 22nd and finished 19th. The following season, Raines moved to BACE's No. 33 Bayer-sponsored Chevrolet Monte Carlo full-time. He had a career-best second-place finish at South Boston Speedway, but with no other Top 10’s, he fell to 15th in the final points standings. He would return in 2001 with Bayer and Alka-Seltzer sharing sponsorship duties, winning his first career pole at Nazareth Speedway and had a career-high 13 Top 10 finishes, finishing sixth in points. He followed that up with five top-fives in 2002, but fell six spots in points.\n\nBACE and Raines moved to the Winston Cup full-time in 2003, completing the whole season for NASCAR Rookie of the Year honors. Despite running without major sponsorship, Raines had a sixth-place finish at North Carolina Speedway and finished 33rd in the championship standings, and third in the Rookie of the Year race. During the last six races of the season, Raines was in the top 20 in points gained for those six races. In the Busch series, Raines had another second-place finish and three consecutive eighth-place runs, allowing him to finish 39th in points despite an abbreviated schedule.\n\nDue to the lack of a sponsorship in 2004, BACE closed its Cup team and focused back on the Busch Series. BACE hired Damon Lusk to drive its No. 74 Outdoor Channel-sponsored Chevrolet Monte Carlo; after four races, Raines returned to the team in favor of Lusk, and finished sixth in his first race at Bristol. He ran 15 races for BACE that season, and drove additional races for Phoenix Racing, Haas CNC Racing, and Kevin Harvick Incorporated. He returned to the Truck series for one race at Atlanta, finishing seventeenth in the No. 08 1-800-4-A-Phone-sponsored Chevrolet Silverado for Green Light Racing. Raines ran one-race deals in Cup for Phoenix Racing and for Bill Davis Racing in 2004, before running four races for Competitive Edge Motorsports. His best cup finish in 2004 was 28th.\n\nHe made a total of six Nextel Cup races in 2005, his first being a 35th-place finish for Front Row Motorsports at Richmond. Late in the season, he drove the No. 37 Dodge Charger for R&J Racing for six races. At Michigan, Raines inherited the lead late in the race, however with a handful of laps left ran out of fuel. The best finish for the pairing was a 22nd-place finish at Talladega Speedway. In addition to his Cup rides in 2005, Raines drove part-time for Kevin Harvick Incorporated in the No. 33 Yard Man/Outdoor Channel Chevrolet Monte Carlo in the Busch Series. In 2005, he had nine top-tens in 23 starts, with a 4th-place finish at the Federated Auto Parts 300.\n\nTowards the end of the 2005 Nextel Cup Series, he was announced as a co-driver of a new team: the No. 96 Texas Instruments/DLP HDTV-sponsored Chevrolet for Hall of Fame Racing. He would share the ride in 2006 with Terry Labonte. Raines and the team had their best race of the season during the Bank of America 500 at Lowe's Motor Speedway, where he led 28 laps and finished seventh. In the 29 races he competed in, Raines had one Top 10 finish and finished 35th in the points standings.\n\nRaines was expected to complete the full 2007 schedule with Hall of Fame Racing, but was replaced on road course events by Ron Fellows. His best finish in 2007 was ninth at Talladega and the team finished in the Top 25 in Owners Points. At the end of the 2007 season, Raines was replaced by J. J. Yeley in the No. 96 car for the 2008 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series. Raines also had returned to the Busch Series with KHI for a part-time schedule, and in 2007 he had three Top 10 finishes in nine starts. \nAfter sitting out the first few races of 2008, Raines attempted his first races of the season for E&M Motorsports driving the No. 08 Dodge sponsored by Rhino Energy Drink. He successfully qualified for his first Cup race of the season at Dover in the Front Row Motorsports No. 34 car, however had failed to make any other races for the team, partly because of a high number of qualifying rainouts. He began driving the No. 70 Haas CNC Racing Chevrolet at Pocono, resulting in an 18th-place finish, that team's second best finish of the season up to that point, and he bested that finish two races later with a 17th-place finish at Bristol. Later, he returned to Front Row Motorsports at Richmond and New Hampshire, only for qualifying to be canceled due to rain at both races, resulting in DNQ's for the team. He got back behind the wheel of the No. 70 Haas CNC Chevrolet at the Camping World 400 at Dover International Speedway, qualifying 13th for the race, the best of any team outside the top-35 in points, and finished 28th. In the fall race at Talladega, Raines was running near the Top-10 when a lead car lost a tire, causing the first major wreck of the race; the No. 70 was involved in the wreck and finished 34th. He ran the remainder of the season for Haas CNC, with the exception of the race at Phoenix where Johnny Sauter drove.\n\nIn 2009, Raines returned to the Nationwide Series for a full-time schedule driving the No. 34 Long John Silver's Chevrolet for Front Row Motorsports, replacing Eric McClure who departed at the end of 2008. Raines had a fourth-place finish in the Aaron's 312 at Talladaga Superspeedway, marking Front Row Motorsports first top-five finish in any series, and has had numerous top-20 finishes throughout the year while remaining in the top 15 in drivers points. At Dover in the spring, FRM perennial sponsor Continental Fire and Safety joined the No. 34 Chevy, and at Daytona in July Gander Mountain jumped on board the No. 34 Impala. Raines was able to muscle his way to a sixth-place finish in the rain at the road race at Montreal. The No. 34 team was able to put together a very competitive car at Lowes Motor Speedway and finished in the 10th position after starting in the back of the field and being in the top ten for much of the night. Raines and the No. 34 earned 12th place in drivers points for the season, and 20th place in owners points.\n\nIn addition to his return to a full-time schedule in the Nationwide Series for Front Row Motorsports, he attempted to qualify Front Row's No. 37 Dodge Charger in the 2009 Daytona 500, however was unsuccessful. Raines qualified for the Sprint Cup race in Phoenix in Barry Haefele's No. 73 car. The No. 37 and Raines qualified for their first race at Richmond, however was a late entry and gained no points for the attempt. Raines was announced as the replacement for John Andretti in the No. 34 entry for three weeks while Andretti temporarily left the team to compete in the Indy 500. In his first race for the team, Raines was able to get FRM's best ever finish to that point without EGR's assistance, a 25th at Darlington. Returning to the No. 37, Raines managed to make numerous other races for the team, gaining sponsorship from Gander Mountain during the 2009 Coke Zero 400, finishing 30th. The No. 37 was run primarily as a \"start and park\" car in 2009, attempting to aid the No. 34 in remaining in the top-35 in points, and raising money for the underfunded organization.\n\nFor the 2010 season, Raines and the No. 34 Long John Silvers crew return to the track in the Nationwide Series. However, with Front Row Motorsports becoming Ford supported team in the Sprint Cup Series, and the No. 34 Nationwide team running Chevrolets, the team has been absorbed by the returning organization of Tri-Star Motorsports, owned by Mark Smith of Pro Motors. Raines and the No. 34 started the season strong, with a 14th-place finish at the DRIVE4COPD 300 at Daytona after leading 3 laps. The No. 34 team picked up sponsorship from the Planet Hollywood Resort and Casino at Las Vegas, and had a strong run at Talladega, finishing 7th. BeAStockCarDriver.com jumped onto Raines' car for the remaining 4 races of the season after sponsoring teammate Jason Keller at Charlotte. He finished 17th in final drivers standings.\n\nRaines ran a Sprint Cup Series race for Larry Gunselman's No. 64 at Richmond in May, and ran Tommy Baldwin Racing's No. 36 in the Sprint Showdown. At the Carfax 400 at Michigan during August, Raines replaced the released Kevin Conway at Front Row Motorsports, finishing 31st in his debut with the team. Raines and fellow driver Dave Blaney shared this ride for the remainder of the season. He ran in the top-20 at Martinsville before a cut tire ended his day. Raines' best finish in the 2010 sprint cup season came at Bristol, finishing 28th.\n\nIn 2011, Raines began the season without a full-time ride in any series. He spotted for Robert Richardson, Jr., driving the No. 37 Ford for Front Row Motorsports in the Daytona 500. Raines' first start came at Phoenix, where he finished 25th in Max Q Motorsports' unsponsored No. 37 Ford, fielded in association with Front Row Motorsports. He continued to race the car, getting a 25th at Martinsville and getting the team back into the top-35 in owners points following the 7th race of the season. Black Cat Fireworks and Firehouse Subs joined the team for 5 races leading up to the Coca-Cola 400 Daytona on the 4th of July weekend. Following the 9th race of the season at Richmond, the car turned into a start and park entry. Raines would go on to be the full-time driver of the car until the 19th race of the season at Loudon, after which he drove sparingly for the team.\n\nIn 2012, Raines drove the No. 26 Ford for Front Row Motorsports in the Daytona 500. Securing sponsorship from the Rick Santorum For President campaign, he finished 19th in the race, after running in the top 10 on the final lap and being blocked. Raines was scheduled to drive in the No. 40 for Joe Falk and Mike Hillman at Bristol for what would become Hillman-Circle Sport LLC, but the team withdrew. However he did make a start for Hillman-Circle Sport at Texas Motor Speedway in the debut of their new No. 33 car, finishing 34th. Raines again drove the No. 33 for Hillman-Circle Sport at Talladega, where he finished 38th after an engine problem. Raines also drove at Pocono for Tommy Baldwin Racing, finishing 32nd after a crash. He also drove for Robinson-Blakeney Racing in the Nationwide Series, mostly running the No. 70 when ML Motorsports was not scheduled to do so.\n\nRaines continued driving the JRR No. 70 in 2013 at the Nationwide Series level. He also returned to the No. 33 and No. 40 cars for Hillman-Circle Sport in the Sprint Cup Series as a teammate to Landon Cassill, mostly starting and parking his appearances to fund Cassill's full race runs. However, Raines did run the full race at Bristol, Richmond and Kansas, with a best finish of 29th at Kansas in October. Raines was also scheduled to run the full race at Talladega, however his engine expired on the second lap of the race.\n\nRaines did not make any national series appearances in 2014.\n\nRaines served as the spotter for Sam Hornish Jr. and the No. 9 of Richard Petty Motorsports in 2015, but returned to Front Row Motorsports as a spotter mid-year.\n\nIn 2017, Raines began spotting for Stewart Haas Racing #41 driver Kurt Busch in 2017.\n\n Season still in progress<br>\n\n"}

{"id": "2182600", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2182600", "title": "Party hat", "text": "Party hat\n\nA party hat is generally a playful conical hat made with a rolled up piece of thin cardboard, usually with designs printed on the outside and a long string of elastic acting like a chinstrap, going from one side of the cone's bottom to another to secure the cone to the person's head. Its name originates with its use: Party hats are worn most often at birthday parties, especially by the guest of honor, with a significant minority being worn for New Year celebrations. In Britain the hat is made of paper and is the shape of a crown, and is most typically worn during a Christmas dinner. The party hat has its origins in the dunce cap worn by misbehaving or poorly performing schoolchildren from the mid-19th century to the early 20th century, with its festive decoration and society's positive attitude toward the wearer indicating a relaxation, abrogation, or even reversal of certain social norms: During the occasion in question, the wearer is permitted or encouraged to engage, rather than discouraged from engaging, in frivolous and foolish behavior for which the required wearing of the dunce cap would in other situations constitute a punishment.\nParty hats have originated in England \n\nNon-conical hats worn to signify an occasion's informal and festive status include decorated top hats, hats made from balloons, the beer hat or \"beer helmet\" (invented in 1983 by Buffalo Bills fan Jeremy Gumbo), and Mickey Mouse ears. In more extreme cases, partygoers may wear other objects such as lampshades or beer boxes, although the wearing of such objects often meets with social disapproval.\n\n\n"}

He was a child prodigy who had already acquired a broad understanding of Dharma philosophy and meditation by the age of ten. His teacher, Pomdrakpa, had received the full Kagyu transmission from Drogon Rechen, the first Karmapa's spiritual heir. Pomdrakpa realized, through certain very clear visions, that the child in his charge was the reincarnation of Dusum Khyenpa, as indicated in the letter given to Drogon Rechen.\n\nThe young Karma Pakshi is said to have assimilated the deepest teachings effortlessly and required only one reading of a text to be familiar with it as he was already enlightened. Nevertheless, Pomdrakpa made a point of formally passing on all the teachings through the traditional empowerments, so that the stream of the empowerment lineage would be unbroken. This has been the case ever since: despite their innate clarity, young Karmapas receive all the transmissions formally.\n\nThe second Karmapa spent much of the first half of his life in meditation retreat. He also visited and restored the monasteries established by the first Karmapa and is famous for having introduced to the Tibetan people communal chanting of the Om mani padme hung mantra of compassion.\n\nAt the age of forty-seven he set out on a three-year journey to China, in response to an invitation from Kublai, grandson of Genghis Khan. While there, he is said to have performed many spectacular miracles and played an important role as a peacemaker. Although requested to reside there permanently, he declined, not wishing to be the cause of sectarian conflicts with the Sakyapas, whose influence was strong in China at that time. (There is an independent western reference to his presence in the court of Kublai Khan in \"The Travels of Marco Polo\"). Over the next ten years the Karmapa travelled widely in China, Mongolia, and Tibet and became famous as a teacher. He was particularly honoured by Möngke Khan, Kublai's brother, who ruled at that time and whom the Karmapa recognised as a former disciple. After Munga's death, Kublai became the Khan. He established the city of Cambalu, the site of present-day Beijing, from which he ruled a vast empire stretching as far as Burma, Korea, and Tibet. However, he bore a grudge against the Karmapa, who had refused his invitation to remain in China some years before and had been so close to his brother. He ordered his arrest.\n\nThe legend tells that each attempt to capture, or even kill, the Karmapa was thwarted by the latter's miracles. At one point the Karmapa 'froze' a battalion of 37,000 soldiers on the spot, by using the power of \"mudra,\" yet all the time showing compassion. He eventually let himself be captured and put in exile, knowing that his miracles and compassion would eventually lead to Kublai Khan having a change of heart which did in fact happen. Returning to Tibet towards the end of his life, he had an enormous (sixteen-meter) statue of the Buddha built at Tsurphu Monastery, to fulfill a dream he had had long before. The finished work was slightly tilted; it is said that Karma Pakshi straightened it by sitting first in the same tilted posture as the statue and then righting himself. The statue moved as he moved. Before dying, he told his main disciple, Urgyenpa, details concerning the next Karmapa's birth.\n\n\n"}

A gifted skier, he won championships of Poland 24 times in various skiing disciplines, including Alpine skiing, Nordic skiing and ski jumping. A member of the Polish national team at three consecutive Winter Olympics, he was also one of the pioneers of mountain rescue in the Tatra Mountains and a glider instructor. He perished in the Auschwitz concentration camp.\n\nCzech was born July 25, 1908 in Zakopane, then in Austro-Hungarian Galicia. His parents were Józef Czech and Stanisława née Namysłowska. There he attended local public school and a private gymnasium, but in the end he finished only three classes of a local wood industry school (in 1927). The same year he joined the \"SN PTT-1907 Klub Sportowy Kemping Zakopane\". In late 1920s he moved to Warsaw, where he graduated from the Central Institute of Physical Education. This gave him the diploma of a professional gymnastics teacher and a skiing instructor.\n\nHe was 24 times Polish champion in different ski competitions and took part in the Winter Olympics of 1928, 1932 and 1936. He finished 10th in the Nordic combined and 37th in the ski jumping at the 1928 Winter Olympics in St. Moritz. Four years later, at the 1932 Winter Olympics held in Lake Placid, New York, Czech was 7th in the Nordic combined, 12th in ski jumping and 18th in the 18 km cross-country event.

Previously, he was a mainstay in NASCAR's second-tier series, competing in 519 Nationwide Series races between 1991 and 2010. On May 15, 2010, Keller made his 500th career start, the first driver in series history to do so.\n\nKeller was born in Greenville, South Carolina, and began his racing career on kart tracks, moving up to Late-Model Sportsman dirt-track racing at the age of 16. He drove the #57 Chevy owned by Jack Finley of Easley, South Carolina.\n\nKeller made his Busch series debut in the 1991 May race at Lanier Speedway. He piloted the #54 Air Products Buick home in 29th after starting 8th.\n\nAir Products would sponsor his family-owned team from 1991 to 1994, during that time using the numbers 54 and 45, before finally settling on the #57, a number Jason would use until the end of the 2003 season. Keller grabbed his first top-10 finish in his 7th start at the North Carolina Speedway in February 1993.\n\nHis first top-5 would come one year later in the fall race of 1994 at Dover Downs. 1994 would be his first full season, and he finished 17th that year in the points. He did miss a race that season, but up to December 1, 2005, Keller has not missed one since. He won three poles in 1994, his first career coming at Rougemont.\n\nIn 1995, Keller received backing from Budget Gourmet, and rewarded them by finishing 4th place in the standings. His first career win occurred in August, as he outpaced the field at Indianapolis Raceway Park. In addition, Keller had 6 top-5s and 12 top-10s that season.\n\nSlim Jim came on board for the 1996 season. Keller secured another top-10 finish in points (6th) with a 10 top-10s season.\n\nKeller struggled through 1997 and 1998, finishing 13th and 16th in the points respective years. He only had 4 top 5s and 17 top 10s in those two years. In 1998, Keller's family owned team had no decals on the car, and that forced the team to sell to the newly formed ppc Racing team.\n\nIn 1999, with sponsorship from IGA, Keller won 3 poles (Spring Bristol, IRP, Richmond spring) and 2 wins at Bristol Motor Speedway (spring) and IRP. With 5 top 5s and 12 top 10s, Keller came home 8th in the standings.\n\nIn 2000, Keller's ppc team received funding from Excedrin. This began to this date, Keller's best streak in his career. In four years (2000–2003), Keller wrapped up 7 wins (one at Dover, two at Nazareth, one at Rockingham, one at Richmond, one at Milwaukee, and one at Talladega.) He won 4 BUSCH poles, and finished 2nd twice in the standings (2000 and 2002), 3rd (2001), and 5th (2003).\n\nKeller has run 2 races in the Cup Series. In 2003, he drove the No. 01 U.S. Army for MB2/MBV Motorsports Pontiac home 32nd in the spring Richmond race, subbing for the just injured Jerry Nadeau, and 26th in the fall Talladega race in the No. 1 for DEI.\n\nThe No. 57 team lost Albertsons sponsorship at the end of 2003, and Miller High Life came on board, changing the team's number to 22. Keller had 6 top-5s and 12 top-10s in the year, finishing 6th in 2004.\n\nIn 2005, again without sponsorship, Keller left ppc Racing, and headed towards Team Rensi Motorsports's second operation sponsored by McDonald's. They struggled all year. Despite a 9th-place finish in points, Keller was never competitive. He only had 1 top-5 all year (Talladega) and 6 top-10s. Keller signed with Phoenix Racing for 2006, but was released after just eight races.\n\nKeller was consistent in the first eight races. He ran the No. 1 Miccosukee Dodge to a best finish of 11th at Daytona, but he was running 12th in points after the eighth race of the year. However, on April 18, 2006, Keller was released from the team in what many viewed as a \"cheap shot\" from Finch. He was replaced by Mike Wallace. Keller would then try to race the No. 34 Frank Cicci Racing Chevy at Richmond, but he did not qualify and declined further rides with the team. Instead, Brewco Motorsports hired Keller to qualify and practice Greg Biffle's No. 66 Ford for select races when Biffle was working on his Nextel Cup Series team. Keller did a good job, and Brewco rewarded Keller with a race at ORP. Keller ran in the top-five for the first half of his 400th career start, but a mid race spin dropped Keller to 15th in the rundown. Keller will drive part-time for Brewco Motorsports, sharing their No. 27 with NEXTEL Cup driver Ward Burton, as well as a part-time schedule for CJM Racing. On October 12, 2007, Keller broke Tommy Houston's record for most career starts in the Busch Series with his 418th appearance. He also holds the record for most Busch Series earnings with over $11M (USD).\n\nIn 2008 Keller drove for CJM Racing in their No. 11 Chevrolet in the Nationwide Series full-time with sponsorship from America's Incredible Pizza Company. Keller tested the No. 98 for then-Evernham Motorsports at Daytona Preseason Thunder Testing. Keller was released from CJM Racing in September during the off week after the fall Richmond race and replaced by Scott Lagasse Jr., with AIPC citing that they wanted to take the company in a new direction. He then signed with Baker Curb Racing to drive the No. 27 Ford Fusion through the rest of 2008 and 2009. For 2010, Keller drove for TriStar Motorsports in the No. 35, though the team had to get by with little to no sponsorship. Although he did not qualify for several races early in the season, by mid-year he had raced his way into the top-30 in owner's points, locking him into the remainder of the races. His best finish in 2010 was 4th at Talladega. Keller did not return to the team in 2011, and Mike Bliss took this place in the renumbered No. 19. His 2010 teammate Tony Raines was also replaced by Eric McClure, who brought sponsorship to the team. Keller has not raced in NASCAR since. On November 2011, Kenny Wallace surpassed Keller in the record books when he made his 520th Nationwide Series start, most all-time.\n"}

It represents a listener's agreement with the point being made by a speaker.\n\nIt was originally an imperative for directing attention to speakers, and has since been used, according to the \"Oxford English Dictionary\", as \"the regular form of cheering in the House of Commons\", with many purposes, depending on the intonation of its user. Its use in Parliament is linked to the fact that applause is normally (though not always) forbidden in the chambers of the House of Commons and House of Lords. \n\nThe phrase \"hear him, hear him!\" was used in Parliament from late in the 17th century, and was reduced to \"hear!\" or \"hear, hear!\" by the late 18th century.

Presumably he has some sort of psionic ability that enables him to do this. He has a deep hatred of the Thing, who is romantically interested in his stepdaughter, Alicia Masters. He once tried to take over the world but was thwarted in this effort by the Fantastic Four.\n\nThe Puppet Master's first appearance was in \"Fantastic Four\" #8 (November 1962), and he was created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby. His origin is told in \"Marvel Team-Up\" #6 (January 1973).\n\nPhillip Masters, the man who becomes the Puppet Master, was born in Dragorin, a town in the small fictional Balkan nation of Transia. He moved to the United States at the age of eight. Growing up he was socially maladjusted and had no friends. (According to \"Spider-Man Family\" #4, his mother died when he was young and he was often picked on, which caused him to turn to his puppets for \"friendship\".)\n\nAfter he finished college he went into business with Jacob Reiss. Philip was jealous of Reiss' wealth and of his family and decided to sabotage his workplace, but Reiss caught him in the act. The two of them break into a fight which results in an explosion that kills Reiss and blinds his daughter Alicia, who was also caught in the blast.\n\nPhillip plays the explosion off as an accident, and then starts a relationship Reiss' wife, Marcia. He marries Marcia and adopts Alicia. Later, Marcia dies and it is more than he can bear and he loses his sanity. He begins experimenting with the radioactive clay puppets that he uses to control specific individuals' bodies. When the Human Torch interferes with one of his experiments, he sets about bringing down the Fantastic Four. He captures the Invisible Girl and the Thing, and masterminds a mass jailbreak using the warden's trustee. He then falls through a window to his death after tripping over Alicia's hand.\n\nThough his fatal fall is alluded to in his subsequent appearance, it is never explained how he is still alive. He has himself committed to a sanitorium for several months in the belief that this will allow the world to forget him. Upon release he takes control of Namor and uses him to battle the Fantastic Four. He also pits the Human Torch and the Thing against each other. He teams up with the Mad Thinker and uses the original X-Men to battle the Fantastic Four. Teaming up again with the Thinker, who would become his frequent ally, he battles the Thing and the Torch again, using animated life-size mannequins to battle the pair.\n\nThe Puppet Master is later seen among a group of criminals assembled by Doctor Doom. He then controls Namor again. He opposes the original X-Men through the mind-controlled Mimic. He also sparks a battle between the Hulk and Namor by controlling the Hulk.\n\nThe Puppet Master next allies with the Mad Thinker and Egghead in their attempt to blackmail the U.S. He forces Iron Man to battle Captain Marvel. He again teams with the Thinker, and attacks the Fantastic Four using androids of their past foes. He controls Ballox the Monstroid, and battles Spider-Man and the Vision. With the Thinker, he battles Spider-Man and the Thing. He then forces Thor to battle the Fantastic Four. He then controls the Wrecker and Power Man. Eventually, the Puppet Master returns to his homeland, where he encounters Modred the Mystic.\n\nWith Doctor Doom, the Puppet Master traps the Fantastic Four within the miniature artificial city of \"Liddleville\", their minds trapped inside tiny cybernetic, part-organic copies of their original bodies. However, Doom perverts what had been intended by the Puppet Master as a chance to give Alicia and Ben a normal life into a trap, and he eventually helps the Fantastic Four learn the truth and escape Liddleville while trapping Doom in the android body he had used to monitor the Fantastic Four. He is defeated by Doom in Liddleville and seemed to have been destroyed, but his mind is then resurrected in a body of living radioactive clay. He battles the Thing on the mental plane, and his physical clay body is destroyed. He is eventually resurrected in his original body by the Sphinx.\n\nHe was once thought to have been killed when he fell out of the window of a fairly tall building, but miraculously survived. The Puppet Master has exhibited an uncanny ability to cheat death, dodging mortal threats that have included bomb blasts, drownings, and even a giant squid attack. Liddleville would later be used against the Micronauts and X-Force.\n\nThe jealous Puppet Master often uses his clay to manipulate the lives of the Fantastic Four, especially where his stepdaughter was concerned. He is particularly concerned with guarding his precious Alicia from marrying the likes of the Thing. But he is later just as outraged when she is engaged to Johnny Storm, also a member of the Fantastic Four.\n\nWith the Thinker and the Wizard, Masters attempts to disrupt the wedding of the Human Torch and Alicia. The plan was to launch an attack on the church after the wedding ceremony, but when he sees how happy Alicia is to marry Johnny, Masters is overcome with remorse and turns on his associates, launching the Dragon Man against them: his wedding gift to Alicia and Johnny.\n\nLater, Masters is reformed, remarried, and has a stepson; the toys he crafts for his son inadvertently caused a battle between Power Pack and the alien Ciegramites. He reveals to the Thing that he had discovered that the Alicia Johnny had married was actually a Skrull.\n\nThe Puppet Master has been shown on two occasions attempting to leave his (overtly) criminal life behind. In the first, he found some measure of spiritual enlightenment in the service of the billionaire philosopher/cultist Satori. Satori employs Masters to construct a \"perfect man\" from his clay, which would then receive life and the power cosmic from the Silver Surfer and absorb Satori's mind, so that he might survive his body's death and serve as a proper leader to his flock. Masters at some point left this cult, and entered a S.H.I.E.L.D.-maintained witness protection program, using his abilities to aid the government through the dulling of memories of other so-protected criminals' previous associates. Masters reached out through his powers to control Ben Grimm and Alicia, duping Ben into a \"married life\" with his despondent daughter, whom Ben had stopped seeing years before. Ben was freed, but the Fantastic Four were prevented from taking any measure of revenge upon Masters, given his S.H.I.E.L.D. affiliation.\n\nThe Puppet Master returned to criminal life and affiliated himself with the Mad Thinker. Utilizing a device constructed by Mad Thinker, he was able to control a large number of non-super-humans, most notably members of the Yancy Street Gang to escalate a battle between the two different factions in the superhero Civil War.\n\nIn that same issue he reveals that he always planned to kill the person he was working with in past team-ups and that he has anger management problems. Mad Thinker gives him the number of a good therapist. This exchange seems to contradict previous interactions between the two.\n\nThe Puppet Master is then in the business of selling slaves (primarily females). Some of those under his control are superhuman females captured by members of the Chilean Army, and among those held captive are Dusk, Tigra, Silverclaw, Stature, and Araña. The Puppet Master also has random male slaves fight to the death. Once again the Puppet Master is presumed dead when he detonates explosives hidden beneath the house he used as a base, in a battle against Ms. Marvel.\n\nDuring the \"Fear Itself\" storyline, Puppet Master is seen in a comatose state in the Raft's infirmary. It is revealed that Purple Man was the one who had Puppet Master manipulate Misty Knight's Heroes for Hire organization to establish a criminal organization for him while he was in jail. Before he could kill Puppet Master, Elektra and Shroud arrive and prevented Purple Man from killing Puppet Master. Purple Man spared Puppet Master and took control of some inmates to attack Elektra and Shroud before escaping from the Raft.\n\nPuppet Master later appears by Misty Knight's side where he uses the villains on Misty Knight's side as payback on Purple Man.\n\nLater, the Puppet Master has been murdered, with all evidence pointing to the Thing as the person responsible. The crime took place in a sealed room that even Mister Fantastic could barely enter with Alicia as the only witness, and even she cannot decipher what has happened. Although the Thing claims innocence, he allows himself to be locked up. As it turns out, the dead Puppet Master was a decoy and the real Puppet Master had been hidden away by the Quiet Man, the mastermind behind Thing's framing and other misfortunes the Fantastic Four had suffered. Mister Fantastic later finds the real Puppet Master captive in the Quiet Man's building.\n\nThe Puppet Master has no revealed superhuman abilities, but he possesses a genius-level intellect and was once a brilliant biologist with a doctorate in biology. He is an extremely talented craftsman and very gifted in experimental science. His greatest strength was his ability to create extremely lifelike marionette puppets with extreme speed that he modeled after real people. Through intense concentration, he is able to control the physical actions of anyone after whom he models one of his puppets. How he did this was never adequately explained other than he used some type of special radioactive mixture. The clay he used in this mixture was magical, slightly radioactive, and came from a remote area near Wundagore Mountain, Transia, site of the prison of the elder god Chthon. He cannot control the actions of essentially mindless creatures, and his control can be broken by beings with supremely strong will-power. His control is limited to one person at a time, and the degree of control decreases with the distance from the person controlled.\n\n\n\n\nIn August 2009, \"TIME\" listed the Puppet Master as one of the \"Top 10 Oddest Marvel Characters\".\n\n"}

He is a former co-owner of Bobby Hamilton Racing-Virginia in the Craftsman Truck Series, and is a former racing analyst for ESPN full-time. Before he ran in NASCAR, Compton was a successful short track racer in Virginia.\n\nCompton was born in Hurt, Virginia, and grew up racing in Virginia with his focus on late models in local racing divisions. Eventually, he moved up to the NASCAR Winston Racing Series, and won 36 races in seven years of late model competition. During this time, Compton also hosted a TV show dedicated to covering Virginia races. In 1996, Compton made his debut in a major NASCAR series driving for Dean Monroe, when he qualified in 9th place for the Goody's Headache Powder 500 at Martinsville Speedway in the Winston Cup series. He finished 33rd that day after suffering brake failure. He ran one other race during his rookie season, the fall Martinsville event. He finished 33rd in that race as well.\n\nIn 1997, Compton signed up with a new team, Impact Motorsports, to run the No. 86 Ford F-150 for the NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series Rookie of the Year Award. During his initial Truck Series season, Compton had three Top 5 finishes and a 13th-place finish in the final points standings, but fell well short of the top rookie award. For the 1998 season, in the third race of the season held at Phoenix International Raceway, Compton won his first career pole position, and finished in third in the race. The next week at Portland Speedway, he led all but two laps and won his first career Truck Series race. He got another win later that season at Heartland Park Topeka. He finished seventh in the final points standings and was named the Most Popular Driver. Compton had high hopes for 1999 season as Impact switched to Dodge Rams and getting a teammate in Randy Tolsma, but he failed to go to victory lane that season, although he did finish fourth in points. Late that season, Compton began competing in some Winston Cup races for Melling Racing. Soon afterwards, Melling announced that Compton would driver their No. 9 Ford Taurus in the Winston Cup Series in 2000 season.\n\nCompton struggled during his first year in the Cup series, as his best finish was 16th at New Hampshire International Speedway. In the summer Michigan race, he crashed during qualifying and suffered minor injuries. He was replaced by Bobby Hillin Jr. at the following event. Compton ended the year 38th in points.\n\nIn 2001, Melling switched the car's number and manufacture to 92 and Dodge and had a new crew chief with Chad Knaus. Compton started the season by qualifying on the outside pole next to Bill Elliott in the Daytona 500 and went on to score a 10th-place finish. At the next restrictor-plate race at Talladega Superspeedway, he won his first career Cup pole position, but finished last due to mechanical issues. After winning a second career pole at Talladega, he was only able to improve his points position by five spots. At the end of the year, sponsorship problems at Melling forced him to look elsewhere for a job.\n\nIn the 2002 season, Compton signed with A.J. Foyt Racing to drive the No. 14 Pontiac, replacing Ron Hornaday Jr. He had a best finish of 18th when his sponsor Conseco filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. He was let go after the New England 300. He returned to Melling for one race before competing in two for BAM Racing at the end of the season. His last career Cup start for nine years came in the 2003 Pepsi 400 for Morgan-McClure Motorsports.\n\nIn 2001 at the GNC Live Well 300, Compton made his Busch Series debut with JTG Daugherty Racing, then known as ST Motorsports. He qualified 12th and finished 10th. For four consecutive seasons, Compton ran every Busch Series race with JTG. Although he did not win a Busch Series race, he has 33 career top-ten finishes and one pole position. His best points finish was a 9th in 2002.\nFollowing the conclusion of the 2006 season, Compton was replaced by Marcos Ambrose and returned to the Truck Series, sharing the No. 09 Ford with Joey Clanton for nine races. In 2006, Compton founded Turn One Racing, LLC, as a way of promoting talented young drivers in the southeastern United States. He made a total of fourteen starts that season, ten for Wood Brothers/JTG, as well as one for Key Motorsports and three for Xpress Motorsports. He bought into Bobby Hamilton Racing in 2008, and was named driver of the No. 4 Dodge for the team during the season. After the race at Bristol Motor Speedway the No. 4 team shut down, leaving Compton out of a job. He drove the No. 60 Toyota for Wyler Racing in 2009, finishing with 8 top-tens and finishing 11th in points. Despite the new sponsorship, Jeff Wyler was unsure if the team would continue into 2010, so Compton and Turn One Racing bought the No. 60 from Wyler, though the team continued into 2010 under the Wyler Racing banner. Compton would split the No. 60 Truck with former Formula 1 driver Narain Karthikeyan and Red Bull development driver Cole Whitt, while also changing manufacturers to Chevrolet. Compton later took sole ownership of the team and renamed it Turn One Racing. Compton scored only five top tens and finished 20th in points. Karthikeyan left at the end of the year to drive for Hispania Racing in F1, while Safe Auto left the team to sponsor ThorSport Racing's No. 13 Truck.\n\n2012 saw Compton expand his Truck Series team, Turn One Racing, into the Cup series with the No. 74 Chevrolet, starting at Bristol Motor Speedway in March He himself would attempt to qualify the car at Texas Motor Speedway but failed to do so. However, Compton did later manage to get into the field for the Pocono 400 in June. He has not raced since then.\n\n"}

It was rated PG-13 by the MPAA. The film is a remake of \"Hodet over vannet\" by Norwegian film director Nils Gaup.\n\nNathalie's considerably older husband George (Harvey Keitel) is a stern and prominent judge whose only weak spot is Nathalie herself. The two are happily married and enjoying their beach vacation. Their nearest neighbor, Lance (Craig Sheffer), is attractive and lively and has a childhood history with Nathalie. To Nathalie's dismay and chagrin, George ventures on an overnight fishing trip with Lance to clear the air between them.\n\nNathalie's initial reluctance is due to her fear of being left to her own devices (of which the true reason is later learned). Anxious and longing for her husband, she receives an unexpected visit from an old lover named Kent (Billy Zane). Seizing her chance for company that night, she welcomes him inside and the two reminisce on old times. Kent reveals that his girlfriend recently left him because of his drinking problem; it is revealed that he has a medical condition which is worsened by alcohol. While Nathalie is in the bathroom, Kent takes it upon himself to grab a bottle of liquor from her husband George’s supply. The two whimsically frolic all night and the scene ends with them exhausted by the night’s activities. Come morning, Nathalie discovers Kent dead, apparently from alcohol poisoning.\n\nPanicked and terrified, Nathalie quickly stores Kent’s naked lifeless body in a food cellar under the floorboard. When George returns from his fishing trip, she tries her best to conceal the night’s events and act normal. As the two talk, George notices the loose floorboard that is situated under the dining table. This is where the food cellar is located and Kent’s head is making the floorboard protrude outward. George stomps on the floorboard and corrects the problem. As Nathalie’s panic grows more desperate, George finds flowers and chocolate that Kent gave to Nathalie that night. Questioning her, Nathalie admits to Kent being present in the house the night of his fishing trip. When she reveals his location, George, believing him to be still alive, taunts him. When Nathalie reveals that he is dead, George comes to understand the true desperation of the situation. Taking his body to the nearby tool shed they debate over what course of action to take. The situation is further complicated because Kent’s clothes are missing and his neck was broken by George stomping on the cellar door. George's being a prominent judge and Nathalie's history (as it is now revealed) of early legal trouble for a pill addiction leave them little legal option but to dispose of the body themselves. Although Nathalie still insists that the authorities should be notified and the situation explained, George insists that it is not possible.\n\nThe two decide to dispose of his body in the ocean by tying him down with an old stove. As the two are carrying it to the house, Lance inadvertently shows up and foils their plan and the two are forced to rethink their original strategy. Nathalie and George return home and get into a heated argument. Nathalie expresses her disdain over George’s annoying ability to strangely store items in unconventional places, such as storing sausages in a cigar box. When George questions how Kent could have possibly died, Nathalie mentions his “weak heart” and the fact that he was drinking from George’s personal liquor supply. George reveals that “the blue liquor bottle” which Kent drank was in actuality not (ethyl) alcohol but methanol (methyl alcohol) which is poisonous. Kent’s heart problems along with the disguised powerful liquid drug led to his death. As the two leave each other in frustration over not having disposed of the body, Nathalie goes out for a swim.\n\nComing back from her swim Nathalie notices Kent’s white linen suit resting on the porch of Lance’s house. Seeing her opportunity to do the right thing, she insists for the suit to which Lance happily agrees. Believing her troubles are over, Nathalie goes in search of George to reveal the good news to therefore dress Kent and explain their situation to the police. Nathalie spots George on the veranda. She sees blood embedded in the newly constructed concrete steps. It is revealed that George cut Kent’s body into pieces and mixed them in with the concrete steps. Horrified, Nathalie runs but is quickly captured by George. Having taken her back to the house and tied her up and gagged her so she can’t escape, George goes out to finish the rest of the work. Nathalie manages to free herself only to take refuge with Lance. She explains the situation and is relieved by Lance’s calm demeanor and support. The two are noticeably smitten by each other and it can be seen that Lance never really stopped loving Nathalie all those years. As Nathalie is in the house she notices a postcard intended for her. Lance says he meant to give it to her but forgot and insists he hasn’t read it. The postcard was in fact the very same one of which Kent spoke of foretelling his visit.\n\nNathalie quickly concludes that Lance knew Kent was coming all along and spiked George’s liquor supply in order to kill him. Horrified, she runs to George, believing him to be an innocent victim in Lance’s murder plot. Lance, insisting upon his innocence, follows Nathalie outside to the beach. Shockingly, as Lance and Nathalie are confronted by George, the situation ends in a shootout in which George shoots Lance. Nathalie runs but is captured by George soon thereafter. George has been drinking heavily and is completely disoriented but manages to take Nathalie to the veranda and cement her legs shut in a metal crate. Finally revealing that he was in actuality behind the whole ordeal, George explains that he knew Kent was coming that night from the postcard he purposefully placed in Lance’s mailbox to frame him and keep Nathalie from knowing about Kent’s visit. He spiked the liquor before the trip, knowing Kent would drink it and die. Afterward, George starts to have trouble walking and says that he can't see. Nathalie realizes that George has unknowingly drunk the spiked liquor, that Lance had borrowed it earlier, and that Kent really did die of a heart attack. George then falls off the high rise veranda and is killed when the top of it falls down and pierces his body straight through. As a domino effect, Nathalie is thrown into the water but is unable to surface due to her cemented legs in the metal crate. Luckily, there is a local beach patrol boat nearby and Nathalie is rescued.\n\nThe scene ends with Nathalie in her own boat telling the beach patrolman her story from the very beginning. The patrolman, behind her, asks for a beverage, and Nathalie tells him to check in the cooler under the seat.

Its endeavours in this regard allow the relatives of the disappeared to recuperate the remains of their missing family members and to proceed with burials in accordance with their beliefs, and enable criminal prosecutions to be brought against the perpetrators.\n\nIn 1990 and 1991, various groups of survivors began to report to the authorities the existence of clandestine graves in their communities, most of which contained the bodies of Maya \"campesinos\" massacred during the \"scorched earth\" policy pursued by the government in the early 1980s. The forensic services of the Guatemalan judiciary began to investigate some of these cases, but they failed to pursue them to their conclusion.\n\nConsequently, in 1991, the survivors' groups contacted Dr. Clyde Snow, a renowned U.S. forensic anthropologist who had previously overseen exhumations in Argentina in the wake of that country's Dirty War and had helped found the Argentine Forensic Anthropology Team.\n\nSnow arrived in Guatemala, accompanied by forensic anthropologists from Argentina and Chile, and began the dual task of conducting the first exhumations and training the future members of the Guatemalan Forensic Anthropology Team \"(Equipo de Antropología Forense de Guatemala)\". \n\nThe Team was supported in its early years by a donation from the American Association for the Advancement of Science of the United States, and its first director was Stefan Schmitt, who has since worked on exhumations in Rwanda and Former Yugoslavia. In July 1992 the EAFG carried out its first field project at San José Pachó Lemoa in El Quiché department. \n\nThe Team was restyled as a \"Foundation\" in 1997. That same year, the Historical Clarification Commission (Guatemala's truth and reconciliation commission, set up as a part of the peace accords that ended the armed conflict) asked it to conduct four field investigations in order to secure physical evidence to back up the testimony it had heard from survivors; this evidence was included in the Commission's final report, \".\"\nBy October 2004, the FAFG had investigated a total of 349 clandestine burial sites and had recovered 2,982 sets of human remains.\n\nThe current director of the FAFG is Fredy Peccerelli.\n\n\n"}

He has been a political adviser to the Labour Party.\n\nMcTernan was Prime Minister Tony Blair's Director of Political Operations from 2005 to 2007. He then worked on the November 2007 Australian Labor Party federal election campaign. From 2007 to 2010 he was special adviser to two Cabinet Ministers in Gordon Brown's Labour Government: first to Des Browne, Secretary of State for Scotland and Secretary of State for Defence, and then to Jim Murphy MP, the Secretary of State for Scotland from 2008 until May 2010. From June 2010 to October 2011, he was a columnist at \"The Scotsman\", and then director of communications for the Australian Labor prime minister, Julia Gillard, from September 2011 to June 2013.\nHe was Chief of Staff to the 2014–2015 leader of the Scottish Labour Party, Jim Murphy, who resigned after the Labour Party lost all but one seat in Scotland, including Murphy's, in the 2015 general election.\n\nMcTernan was born in London and grew up in Edinburgh, and attended Firrhill High School. He studied English at the University of Edinburgh.\n\nMcTernan was Political Secretary/Director of Political Operations at 10 Downing Street for Tony Blair from 2005 to 2007, where he provided political management and support for the development of the government's political strategy. In 2007, McTernan was seconded to the Scottish Labour Party to run its campaign for the May 2007 Scottish Parliament election.\n\nDuring the 2006–07 police investigation into the Cash for Honours political scandal surrounding the Labour Party, McTernan was twice questioned, under caution, by the Metropolitan Police. No criminal charges were ever brought against McTernan or anybody else.\n\nFrom 2007 to 2008 he was Special Adviser to Des Browne, Secretary of State for Scotland and Secretary of State for Defence. He was special adviser to Jim Murphy MP, the Secretary of State for Scotland from 2008 until 2010.\n\nIn January 2008, while McTernan was employed as a special adviser to the Secretary of State for Scotland, it emerged that in 2002 McTernan had branded Scotland as being \"narrow\" and \"racist\" during the period he worked for the Scottish Arts Council. In an email to the then Labour MSP Karen Gillon, who was about to make a trip to Sweden, McTernan wrote: \"If you’ve not been to Sweden before, I think you’ll really like it – it’s the country Scotland would be if it wasn’t narrow, Presbyterian, racist etc. etc. Social democracy in action.\" The email was obtained by the London \"Sunday Times\" under freedom of information legislation.\n\nIn 2007 he worked on the November 2007 Australian Labor Party federal election campaign.\n\nIn September 2011, he was appointed as communications director to the Australian prime minister, Julia Gillard. From February 2011 to October 2011, he was Thinker in Residence at the Government of South Australia.\n\nDuring 2012–13, a political scandal erupted over his employment. Accusations were made that Gillard had not attempted to find a suitable Australian candidate for the director of communications post, but had flouted Australia's visa process to employ John McTernan, a British citizen, on a 457 visa – a foreign workers scheme which is designed for employers who cannot find local candidates to fill jobs. When a reporter from Australia's ABC News asked McTernan if he was working in Australia on a 457 visa, he replied \"hardly fucking relevant\".\n\nIn January 2015, McTernan was appointed Chief of Staff to Jim Murphy, then Scottish Labour leader, ahead of the 2015 general election, and oversaw media and policy in this role.\n\nMcTernan strongly opposed Jeremy Corbyn, the eventual winner, in the 2015 Labour Party leadership election, describing Corbyn's popularity as a \"strange psychological emotional spasm\". He asserted: \"I can’t see any case for letting him have two minutes in office, let alone two years in office because I think the damage that will be done to the Labour party in that period makes it incredibly hard to recover\". The MPs who nominated Corbyn were \"moronic\", according to McTernan.\n\nFollowing the 2016 revelations about David Cameron's earlier offshore earnings, and Corbyn's call for an investigation, McTernan argued in his \"Daily Telegraph\" column that tax avoidance is an expression of basic British freedoms.\n\nIn February 2016 McTernan joined the policy and media advice agency Westminster Policy Institute as an associate. He continued to write a regular column for \"The Daily Telegraph\".\n\nIn November 2016, McTernan bet blogger Stuart Campbell $100 on a Clinton victory in the 2016 US presidential election, which he lost. Campbell has claimed that McTernan failed to honour the bet, and Campbell has taken court action against him.\n\nIn August 2017 McTernan joined the Labour Party left-wing pressure group Momentum, set up to support Jeremy Corbyn's leadership. McTernan had previously been a critic of Momentum and of Corbyn.\n\nIn October 2018, John McTernan was asked if he still defends the 2003 invasion of Iraq. He responded in the affirmative: \"Any war against a fascist dictator is a good war.\" He went on to compare the war in Iraq to the Falklands War, the Second World War and the Spanish Civil War. \"As my Kurdish say 'We never ask why did you invade, we ask why did you take so long?',\" said McTernan. He went on to argue that Brexit was a result of a lack of a humanitarian intervention in the Syrian Civil War because it would have prevented the refugee crisis.\n\n"}
{"id": "2182644", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2182644", "title": "Chillingham Castle", "text": "Chillingham Castle\n\nChillingham Castle is a medieval castle in the village of Chillingham in the northern part of Northumberland, England. It was the seat of the Grey and Bennett families from the 15th century until the 1980s, when it became the home of Sir Edward Humphry Tyrrell Wakefield, 2nd Baronet, who is married to a member of the original Grey family. \n\nA large enclosed park in the castle grounds is home to the Chillingham cattle, a rare breed, consisting of about 90 head of white cattle. The castle is a Grade I listed building.\n\nIn addition to the castle itself, a number of structures on the grounds of the castle are listed Grade II on the National Heritage List for England. These include the West Lodge and gateway, the garden wall to the west, the gateway and garden wall to the north, the gateway and garden wall to the south east, and the garden wall to the west.\n\nA pair of urns in the Italian Garden are also listed Grade II.\n\nThe castle was originally a monastery in the late 12th century. In 1298, King Edward I stayed at the castle on his way to Scotland to battle a Scottish army led by William Wallace. A glazed window in a frame was specially installed for the king, a rarity in such buildings at the time. \n\nThe castle occupied a strategically important location in medieval times: it was located on the border between two feuding nations. It was used as a staging post for English armies entering Scotland, but was also repeatedly attacked and besieged by Scottish armies and raiding parties heading south. The site contained a moat, and in some locations the fortifications were thick.\n\nThe building underwent a harsh series of enhancements, and in 1344 a Licence to crenellate was issued by King Edward III to allow battlements to be built, effectively upgrading the stronghold to a fully fortified castle, of quadrangular form.\n\nAnne of Denmark and her children stayed in the castle on their way to London on 6 June 1603. In 1617, James I, whose reign unified the crowns of England and Scotland (James I of England was also James VI of Scotland), stayed at the castle on a journey between his two kingdoms. As relations between the two countries became peaceful following the union of the crowns, the need for a military stronghold in the area declined. The castle was gradually transformed; the moat was filled, and battlements were converted into residential wings. A banquet hall and a library were built.\n\nIn the 18th and 19th centuries, the grounds underwent landscaping, including work carried out by Sir Jeffry Wyattville. The once extensive park is now under a separate ownership from the castle.\n\nThe Prince and Princess of Wales stayed at Chillingham Castle en route to Scotland, in 1872.\n\nDuring the Second World War, the castle was used as an army barracks. During this time, much of the decorative wood is said to have been stripped out and burned by the soldiers billeted there. After the war, the castle began to fall into disrepair. Lead had been removed from the roof, resulting in extensive weather damage to large parts of the building. \n\nIn 1982, the castle was purchased by Sir Humphry Wakefield, 2nd Baronet, whose wife Catherine is descended from the Greys of Chillingham, and Wakefield set about a painstaking restoration of the castle.\n\nIn 1997, the castle was used as a filming location for \"Elizabeth\", featuring as Leith Castle and as the hunting lodge. The fibreglass fireplaces from the film remain in the great hall, covering 18th century white marble fireplaces from Wanstead House.\n\nAs of 2020, sections of the castle are open to the public including for late night ghost tours, and eight apartments within the castle and its outbuildings are available for holiday rentals.\n\nIts current owners market the castle as being the most haunted castle in Britain. It has been investigated on television, \"Most Haunted\", \"I'm Famous and Frightened!\", \"Scariest Places On Earth\", \"Holiday Showdown\", \"Alan Robson's Nightowls\"), The ParaPod, \"Ghost Hunters International\", and \"A Blood Red Sky\" (2013). Some of these ghosts are referred to in a 1925 pamphlet by Leonora, Countess of Tankerville. Others, such as John Sage, are of more recent invention.\n\nThe most famous ghost of the castle is the \"blue (or radiant) boy\", who according to the owners used to haunt the Pink Room in the castle. Guests supposedly reported seeing blue flashes and a blue \"halo\" of light above their beds after a loud wail. It is claimed that the hauntings ceased after renovation work revealed a young boy inside a wall. Documents dating back to the Spanish Armada were reportedly also found within the wall.\n\nIn the novel \"The Bride of Lammermoor\" (1819) by Sir Walter Scott, Chillingham Castle is singled out as a last refuge for an ancient breed of Scottish cattle. The castle and cattle served as inspiration for Eva Ibbotson's 2005 children's book, \"The Beasts of Clawstone Castle\".\n\n\n"}

He also ran the Legends Summer Shootout Series at Charlotte Motor Speedway, where he won back-to-back championships in 1996 and 1997. During those two years, he split 25 career victories at Ace and Concord. In 1998, he moved to the USAR Hooters Pro Cup Series, where he finished 3rd in points and posted thirteen top-tens. He also won the Consistency award for finishing nearly 97% of all possible laps during the season. The next season, he had three top-tens in seven starts.\n\nIn 1999, Labonte began sharing the No. 44 Chevrolet Monte Carlo with his father in the Busch Series. Qualifying nine times, he had a best finish of 14th at Myrtle Beach Speedway. He ran more races in 2000, his best finish a 20th at Nashville Speedway USA. He also made three starts in the ARCA series, posting two top-five finishes. In 2001, he ran a limited ARCA schedule, making five starts, including a race at Nashville Superspeedway, where he led 70 laps.\n\nLabonte began running late model stock series in 2002 at Caraway Speedway. In his first season at the track, he won one feature event and had ten top-tens in twelve starts. He followed that up by winning the track championship the next season. Labonte also returned to the Busch Series in 2002, attempting but failing to qualify for three races in the No. 04 Dodge for Cunningham Motorsports.

{"id": "2182661", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2182661", "title": "Office of Thrift Supervision", "text": "Office of Thrift Supervision\n\nThe Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) was a United States federal agency under the Department of the Treasury that chartered, supervised, and regulated all federally chartered and state-chartered savings banks and savings and loans associations. It was created in 1989 as a renamed version of another federal agency (that was faulted for its role in the savings and loan crisis). Like other U.S. federal bank regulators, it was paid by the banks it regulated. The OTS was initially seen as an aggressive regulator, but was later lax. Declining revenues and staff led the OTS to market itself to companies as a lax regulator in order to get revenue.\n\nThe OTS also expanded its oversight to companies that were not banks. Some of the companies that failed under OTS supervision during the financial crisis of 2007–2010 include American International Group (AIG), Washington Mutual, and IndyMac.\n\nThe OTS was implicated in a backdating scandal regarding the balance sheet of IndyMac. Reform proposals from Henry Paulson, President Barack Obama, and the U.S. Congress proposed to merge the OTS with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. Section 312 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act mandated merger of OTS with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) as of 21 July 2011. The OTS ceased to exist on 19 October 2011.\n\nOTS did not receive a government budget; instead, they were funded by the banks they regulate, like other U.S. federal bank regulators. Other regulatory agencies like the OTS include the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the FDIC, the Federal Reserve System, and the National Credit Union Administration.\n\nIf banks regulated by OTS fail, revenues for the agency decline; conversely, if the OTS regulates more banks, revenues increase.\n\nThe OTS was established in 1989 in response to the savings and loan crisis. On television, President George H. W. Bush said,\n\nand \"trashed\" the predecessor Federal Home Loan Bank Board; soon thereafter, the sign was changed to the \"Office of Thrift Supervision\". Savings and Loan legislation—the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989—\"abolished\", or renamed, the independent Federal Home Loan Bank Board to the Office of Thrift Supervision and placed it under Department of the Treasury supervision. On 22 March 1990, in a setback to the George H. W. Bush Administration, Federal District Judge Royce C. Lamberth ruled that OTS appointments of the former director and acting director, M. Danny Wall and Salvatore R. Martoche, had been unconstitutional because they were not nominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate.\n\nIn 1992, under Director T. Timothy Ryan, the OTS aggressively shut down troubled Savings and Loan (S&L) outfits, and was criticized by the industry and industry lawyers for not allowing some S&Ls that might survive to have a chance. Ryan contrasted the OTS cleanup of the S&L industry to the former situation.\n\nS&Ls were \"dropping like flies\" and this presented problems for OTS staff—declining revenues led to a declining staff. The OTS responded by marketing itself at industry meetings. At one such meeting, federal regulators were \"announcing a campaign to ease regulation\" and they were in a photo-op over a stack of the federal regulations—holding garden shears signaling their intent to cut through them. OTS Director James Gilleran brought a chainsaw. \"Companies got the message.\" In 1998, OTS approved 43 charters, with more than a third going to non-banks. In 2004 Gilleran said \"our goal is to allow thrifts to operate with a wide breadth of freedom from regulatory intrusion\". The OTS \"adopted an aggressively deregulatory stance toward the mortgage lenders it regulated... [and] allowed the reserves the banks held as a buffer against losses to dwindle to a historic low.\"\n\nIn March 2007, a Government Accountability Office report noted that \"In contrast [to the Federal Reserve], a substantial minority of the firms OTS oversees—especially the large, complex ones—have primary businesses other than those traditionally engaged in by thrifts, such as insurance, securities, or commercial activities.\"\n\nSection 312 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act mandated merger of OTS with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC), the Federal Reserve Board, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) as of 21 July 2011. The OTS ceased to exist on 19 October 2011.\n\nThe end of the OTS prompted at least one thrift, Thrivent Financial for Lutherans, to convert to a credit union rather than meet the \"strict\" insurance regulations set forth in the Dodd-Frank Act.\n\n\nOTS supervised holding companies as well as thrift institutions. This resulted in OTS providing consolidated supervision for such well-known firms as General Electric (GE), AIG, Inc., Ameriprise Financial, American Express, Morgan Stanley, and Merrill Lynch. OTS's consolidated supervision program for GE, AIG Inc., and Ameriprise was recognized as \"equivalent\" by the European Union—allowing these firms to operate their financial businesses in the EU without forming an EU holding company and submitting to supervision in the EU.\n\nThe OTS was the primary regulator of Federal Savings Associations (sometimes referred to as Federal thrifts). Federal savings associations include both Federal Savings Banks and Federal Savings and Loans. The OTS was also responsible for supervising Savings and Loan Holding Companies (SLHCs) and some state-chartered institutions.\n\nThe following are some of the larger institutions that were regulated by the OTS:\n\nIn March 2008, OTS Director John M. Reich stated that the Savings and Loan industry remained vibrant due to the effectiveness of regulators. Reich blamed Indymac's 11 July 2008 failure on $1.3bn of withdrawals in the fortnight following concerns raised from Senator Chuck Schumer over the bank's solvency. Schumer faulted the OTS. The failure of IndyMac Bank was the fourth largest bank failure in United States history. Prior to IndyMac's failure on 11 July 2008, the bank had come to rely heavily on higher cost, less stable, brokered deposits, as well as secured borrowings, to fund its operations. The bank had focused on stated income and other aggressively underwritten loans in areas with rapidly escalating home prices, particularly in California and Florida.\n\nOn 21 July 2008, Mr. Reich described \"interference with the regulatory process by reporting and disseminating speculation about the condition of financial institutions, thereby undermining public confidence in those institutions and causing serious harm\" as a contributor to the failure of IndyMac as well as Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Lehman Brothers.\n\nOn 22 December 2008, Mr. Reich removed his agency's western director, Darrel W. Dochow for allowing IndyMac to backdate a capital infusion of $18 million from its parent company so that the bank would appear \"well capitalized\" in its 10-Q for the period ending 31 March 2008. According to a source with knowledge of the incident, at another point Mr. Dochow limited the scope of a review by OTS regulators of IndyMac's portfolio of loans and other assets, overruling the advice of others in the agency. Mr. Dochow played a central role in the savings-and-loan scandal of the 1980s, overriding a recommendation by federal bank examiners in San Francisco to seize Lincoln Savings, the giant savings and loan owned by Charles Keating. Mr. Reich called the backdating irregularity \"a relatively small factor\" in the collapse of IndyMac.\n\nOn 12 February 2009, Mr. Reich resigned, announcing he would step down 27 February.\n\nOn 26 February 2009, the Treasury Department's inspector general released a report citing laxity at the OTS under Reich for adding significantly to the $10.7 billion in FDIC losses from the IndyMac failure, as well as the estimated $270 million in losses suffered by uninsured depositors. The report concluded that, under the law, OTS should have taken Prompt Corrective Action against IndyMac in May 2008. Commenting on the report, Inspector General Eric Thorson dismissed Reich's claim that Senator Schumer's letters caused the failure. Marla Freedman, the assistant inspector general for audit, detailed a pattern of excess risk-taking and abuse of the lending process at IndyMac and the OTS's consistent and concurrent failure to act. Mr. Reich said in a letter to the inspector general that he agreed with the agency's filings.\n\nOn 27 February 2009, Mr. Reich stepped down amidst the continuing audit of backdating at IndyMac and four other institutions. Scott Polakoff, OTS senior deputy director and chief operating officer, hired under Mr. Reich, became acting director on his departure.\n\nOn 26 March 2009, Polakoff was removed and placed on leave by United States Secretary of the Treasury Timothy Geithner, amidst an announced further review and investigation of the backdating scandal by the U.S. Treasury's Inspector General.\n\nThe OTS was pressed by the Senate Banking Committee to admit partial blame for the failure of American International Group (AIG). In a congressional hearing, after Donald Kohn described how there was no regulator for AIG Financial Products or the company overall, Scott Polakoff interrupted. Polakoff stated that it was time for the OTS to take some responsibility because they had been \"deemed an acceptable regulator for both US domestic and international operations\".\n\nDue to OTS regulation of AIG, the Mayfair-based (London, UK) AIG Financial Products division was not subject to Financial Services Authority regulation. OTS regulation allowed France's to grant approval for a Paris-based banking subsidiary, Banque AIG. The Mayfair-based AIG Financial Products division then opened under a system which allowed branch openings in member countries after one EU regulator's approval.\n\nThat OTS was the primary regulator of AIG has been described as \"nonsense\" and compared to \"the super-heavyweight of the world going up against the 65 lb, 13-year-old, class weakling\". AIG operates in 130 countries. The OTS had a small division that monitored derivatives including the credit default swaps at AIG. After a dispute with Goldman Sachs in 2007 over the value of the credit default swaps, the OTS did not initiate formal enforcement action, but \"periodically raised concerns with AIG managers\". Other sources of concern were the three credit rating agencies and AIG's auditor PricewaterhouseCoopers. In March 2008, after AIG disclosed valuation problems, the OTS sent a letter to AIG requesting a \"corrective action plan\" in 30 days. The division overseeing AIG Financial Products was \"quietly disbanded\" and AIG missed their deadline.\n\nIn addition to being headquartered in Washington D.C., OTS had regional offices in Atlanta, Dallas, Jersey City, San Francisco, and Chicago.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The virus mutates to become airborne, endangering the entire population of the station. \n\nMajor Kira soon finds a module in the last replicator O'Brien had worked on; Bashir discovers that it wrote the aphasia virus into the molecular pattern of any food being replicated. Bashir determines that the virus was engineered by a Bajoran terrorist during the time of the Cardassian occupation of Bajor.\n\nThe doctor who created the virus is long dead, but one of his fellow resistance fighters, Surmak Ren, is now the administrator at a Bajoran hospital. Kira believes Dr. Surmak may have knowledge of the virus, so she decides to bring him to DS9. At first, Commander Sisko refuses to allow Kira to leave, but she assures him she will not break quarantine. Kira flies to Bajor and transports Surmak directly to her runabout. Initially, Surmak refuses to help, but relents when Kira reveals that by being aboard the runabout, Surmak is also infected with the aphasia virus.\n\nMeanwhile, virtually the entire crew is incapacitated. A freighter captain, desperate to avoid infection, tries to leave DS9 without clearance, and ruptures his ship's power core in the process. To prevent the resulting explosion from destroying half the station, the ship must be ejected from its dock. Odo recruits Quark, who is unaffected by the virus, to assist him in jettisoning the ship, and it explodes at a safe distance. Surmak is eventually able to create a vaccine for the aphasia virus.\n\nKeith DeCandido gave the episode a warp factor rating of 6/10 for Tor.com, writing, \"I could watch an hour of just O’Brien dashing about the station trying desperately to keep up with all the systems failures while he does a slow burn of sleep-deprived snark, and it’s pretty much impossible for a scene between Rene Auberjonois and Armin Shimerman to not be delightful, and this episode has several.\"\n\n\"Trek Navigator\" Mark A. Altman gave the episode 1.5 stars, stating, \"[t]he clichéd virus story is a tired premise that is resolved too quickly.\"\n\nThe computer virus that infects the space station in this episode is noted as a Trojan-horse software program. The virus featured in the episode also infects people, and is noted for causing them to speak apparent gibberish.\n\n"}

After high school, he completed a six-year enlistment in the U.S. Air Force as an Air Surveillance Technician on the E-3 AWACS. It was during his last year in the Air Force that racing caught Sherman’s attention. After a trip to the Jim Russell Racing School in Sonoma, California, Sherman was asked to compete for a racing scholarship in the Russell Champ Series. He won the scholarship and his racing career began.\n\nDuring the next few years Sherman competed in several different racing series including the Barber Dodge Pro Series, Grand American Road Racing Association and the ARCA Re/Max Series.\n\nIn 2003, driving a Ford sponsored by Serta Mattresses, he collected six top-5 and 11 top-10 finishes in ARCA competition and finished fourth in the final point standings. The following year he posted nine top-5 and 14 top-10 finishes, which placed him second in the series’ point standings. He also received the prestigious Bill France Triple Crown honor and the HG Adcox Sportsman of the Year Award.\n\nSherman competed in a handful of NASCAR Busch Series races in 2004 in the No. 58 Serta Dodge for Akins Motorsports and planned to run a full schedule with the team in 2005. Glynn Motorsports bought out his team and after 11 races and one top-10 finish between the two teams, Sherman and his sponsors parted ways with the team. In July 2005, Sherman signed on with ppc Racing, replacing Michel Jourdain Jr., and brought the Serta sponsorship with him (along with Hickory Farms and Consort hair spray).\n\nIn 2006, Sherman moved up to the NEXTEL Cup Series. Bringing Serta as his primary sponsor, he was signed to drive the No. 49 for BAM Racing, replacing Ken Schrader, who moved to Wood Brothers Racing that year. His best finish was a 21st-place finish in the Daytona 500. After poor performance, BAM Racing asked Sherman to step aside while the team tested other drivers. He resigned from the team (taking the sponsorship with him) and returned to the ARCA Re/Max Series for the remainder of the 2006 season. This turned out to be a good move, and Sherman scored his first ARCA win at Michigan, and finished 19th in points despite starting the season late. In 2007, he left ARCA again and returned to the Busch Series to drive the No. 36 Big Lots Chevy for McGill Motorsports. He departing the team in September, and would spend the remainder of the season driving a limited schedule for Braun Racing in their No. 10 Toyota.\n\nOn February 19, 2008, it was announced that Sherman had signed with Panther Racing to move to the Firestone Indy Lights Series for the 2008 season. He finished 11th in points with a best finish of 3rd which came in the first race of the year at Homestead-Miami Speedway. His best road course finish was 10th in a rain drenched attrition filled race at the Mid-Ohio Sports Car Course.\n\nIn 2009, he drove in a few Camping World Truck Series races for Stringer Motorsports in the No. 90 Great Clips Toyota as well as one ARCA race at Salem, also in Stringer's No. 90.\n\nAfter five years of being without a ride, Sherman came back to stock car racing in a one-off attempt with Mason Mitchell's No. 98 team in the ARCA race at Chicago in 2016. He shook the rust off pretty quickly and earned a top-10 finish in 9th after qualifying 11th. However, despite this surprise comeback, Sherman has yet to attempt any other races in any series since that one race.\n\n"}

It is the second and final studio album to feature Tim \"Ripper\" Owens on vocals. It is the only Judas Priest studio album to feature a Parental Advisory label due to some songs featuring profanity: \"Machine Man\" and \"Metal Messiah\" both carry explicit markings on the album's iTunes page.\n\nFollowing the lukewarm-to-decent reception to \"Jugulator\", the band scrambled to assess what exactly went wrong, and determined that fans preferred a sound more faithful to Priest's back catalog. The resulting album would be an amalgam of \"Jugulator\"-style riffs, references to '80s Priest, and nu-metal additions such as samples, downtuned guitars, rapping, and industrial-style beats. While the ostensible aim was to offer something for every possible fan, in the end, the album received a much poorer reception than \"Jugulator\" by most fans -- and would result in the eventual reunion of the \"classic\" line-up with Halford. Owens has stated that \"Demolition\" was his favorite album that he did with the group, claiming it had \"better vocals and more melody\" than \"Jugulator\".\n\nIn 2018 Tim \"Ripper\" Owens pledged to re-record this album and its predecessor Jugulator as he feels that his era of the band has \"been erased\".\n\nGuitarist Richie Faulkner cites \"Hell Is Home\" as his favourite song, \"It's really heavy and the vocal melody is really great. I think Ripper sings it really well. It's probably one of my favorite Priest songs of the Ripper era. 'Hell Is Home' — I really like that.\"\n\nThe album was produced by guitarist Glenn Tipton, who also took over as the primary songwriter. The band's main songwriting team had long consisted of Rob Halford, K. K. Downing, and Tipton. After Halford departed, however, Downing and Tipton wrote all the songs on \"Jugulator\". On this album, many of the songs were written solely by Tipton, with contributions from Downing on several songs. Former producer Chris Tsangarides, who cowrote \"A Touch of Evil\" on \"Painkiller\", also assisted in the writing of a few songs. Drummer Scott Travis cowrote \"Cyberface\" – his first and only contribution to writing in the band's history. (Les Binks was Priest's only other drummer to cowrite a song.) This was the first album since \"Painkiller\" to feature a guest appearance by keyboardist Don Airey, who had played on \"A Touch of Evil.\"\n\n\"People will wonder if a new Priest album is as good as any of the fifteen that came before it,\" Tipton acknowledged. \"I'm confident they'll think this one is. It has some manic, hooligan tracks,\nlike 'Machine Man' and 'Bloodsuckers', as well as a typical 'Ripper' song in 'Jekyll and Hyde'.\n\nThe songs \"Machine Man\" and \"Feed on Me\" were included in Judas Priest's box set \"Metalogy\".\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2182672", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2182672", "title": "The Elfin Knight", "text": "The Elfin Knight\n\n\"The Elfin Knight\" (Child 2; Roud 12) is a traditional Scottish folk ballad of which there are many versions, all dealing with supernatural occurrences, and the commission to perform impossible tasks. \n\nThe first broadside version was printed before 1674. The ballad has been collected in different parts of England, Scotland, Ireland, the US, and Canada.\n\nIn the oldest extant version of this ballad (circa 1600-1650), an elf threatens to abduct a young woman to be his lover unless she can perform an impossible task. She responds with a list of tasks which he must first perform, thus evading rape. The plot is closely related to \"Riddles Wisely Expounded\" (Child Ballad #1), in which the Devil proposes to carry off a woman unless she can answer a number of riddles.\n\nLater versions invert the direction of desire, with the elf proposing tasks which the lady must perform in order to be accepted as his lover. The first verse usually opens with the introduction of the title character:\n\nMeanwhile, a maid lies in bed, wishing she could marry the knight. Upon her speaking these words, the knight appears, telling her he will marry her if she will perform numerous tasks, all impossible.\n\nShe promptly responds with her own list of impossible tasks, and thereby gains her supernatural husband.\n'The Fairy Knight'\nBuchan's Ballads of the North of Scotland, II, 296.\nThe countering of impossible tasks with other impossible tasks is a common motif in the folktale Aarne–Thompson type 875, the Clever Girl, a fairy tale making use of this motif is \"The Wise Little Girl\".\n\nIn Celtic folklore, in common with many other European traditions, impossible tasks are often given to a suitor as part of a wedding trial - a well known example would be Culhwch and Olwen from Welsh Brittonic tradition where the 40 impossible tasks are set by the father-in-law (in this case the giant Ysbadadden Pen Cawr).\n\nThis ballad was one of 25 traditional works included in \"Ballads Weird and Wonderful\" which was published by John Lane's The Bodley Head in 1912 and illustrated by Vernon Hill.\n\nThe song \"Scarborough Fair\" might be a variant recorded later, first by Martin Carthy, and later and more famously by Simon & Garfunkel. A similar variant is \"Whittingham Fair\", a song that was popular in the north and west of Northumberland. There are also several American variants, which differ greatly, among them \"My Father Had an Acre of Land\", \"The Parsley Vine\", and \"The Shirt of Lace\".\n\nThe song also forms the basis for both the melody and lyrics for Bob Dylan's \"Girl from the North Country\" first recorded on \"The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan\" in 1963.\n\nA novel by Nancy Werlin, \"Impossible\" (Penguin/Dial, 2008), was inspired by the song.\n\nFollowing are some of the notable recordings of the ballad, including the artists, titles, albums, and years:\n\n\n\n"}
