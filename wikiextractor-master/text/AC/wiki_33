Succeeding his father Lý Thánh Tông at the age of 7, during his early reign Lý Nhân Tông ruled with the assistance of his mother Ỷ Lan and the chancellor Lý Đạo Thành who were both considered competent regents and were able to help the emperor maintain the country's prosperity. Appreciated as a great emperor of the Lý Dynasty, Lý Nhân Tông made important contributions to the development of Đại Việt, especially for establishing Confucianism as the official philosophy of the state, creating Confucian-based imperial exams, and creating schools based on the Confucian system of learning. During his 55-year reign, which was the longest reign for any Vietnamese monarch, Lý Nhân Tông also experienced several wars against Đại Việt's neighbours, the Song Dynasty and the kingdom of Champa in which the Lý–Song War (1075–1076) was the fiercest.\n\nNhân Tông was born in the first month of the lunar calendar in 1066 as Lý Càn Đức to the emperor Lý Thánh Tông and his concubine Ỷ Lan. It was said that Lý Thánh Tông was unable to have his own son up to the age of 40, so he paid a visit to Buddhist pagodas all over the country to pray for a child. Therefore, right after the birth, Lý Càn Đức was entitled crown prince of the Lý Dynasty while Lady Ỷ Lan was granted the title Imperial Concubine. To celebrate the event that lifted the emperor's constraint of dying without issue, Lý Thánh Tông changed his era name from Chương Thánh Gia Khánh (彰聖嘉慶) to Long Chương Thiên Tự (龍章天嗣) and gave out a general amnesty for prisoners.\n\nIn the first month of the lunar calendar in 1072, the emperor Thánh Tông died and thus the crown prince Càn Đức, now Lý Nhân Tông, took the throne at the age of only 7. The emperor changed the era name to Thái Ninh (1072–1076), during his reign Lý Nhân Tông had seven more era names which are Anh Vũ Chiêu Thắng (1076–1084), Quảng Hựu (1085–1092), Hội Phong (1092–1100), Long Phù (1101–1109), Hội Tường Đại Khánh (1110–1119), Thiên Phù Duệ Vũ (1120–1126) and Thiên Phù Khánh Thọ (1127–1127).\n\nInitially, the question of who was to be regent for the young emperor was awarded to the chancellor (Vietnamese: \"thái sư\") Lý Đạo Thành and the Empress Mother Thượng Dương, but she was soon dismissed by Lý Nhân Tông after the influence from the emperor's natural mother Ỷ Lan. Later the Empress Mother Thượng Dương and her 76 imperial maids were imprisoned in the Thượng Dương palace; they ultimately were killed and buried in the tomb of Lê Thánh Tông.\n\nAfter the Empress Mother's assassination, Ỷ Lan was entitled Empress Mother Linh Nhân and replaced the Empress Mother Thượng Dương in the position of regent for the emperor. Concerning the death of the previous empress mother, the historian Ngô Sĩ Liên commented that \"although having a devotion to Buddhism, Ỷ Lan was too ruthless in killing the innocent empress mother, and also remarked that the chancellor Lý Đạo Thành was transferred to a position in the southern border likely because he advised against Ỷ Lan's murder of Thượng Dương.\n\nOnce Ỷ Lan became regent on behalf of Lý Thánh Tông during his military campaign in Champa, she continued to prove her ability in successfully assisting the emperor in ruling the country, together with the chancellor Lý Đạo Thành and the commander-in-chief Lý Thường Kiệt. In the second month of 1117, following Ỷ Lan's advice, Lý Nhân Tông issued an edict prohibiting people from killing buffaloes, reasoning that since buffalo were essential for farming, the death of buffalo would seriously affect many people who depended on the crops that were tilled by the now-dead buffalo; therefore, a criminal accused of killing buffalo and the occasional accomplice had to be heavily punished. The chancellor Lý Đạo Thành was also famous for his competence and righteousness that helped the young emperor Nhân Tông to maintain the prosperity of the country and the strength of the Lý army.\n\nLý Nhân Tông's reign is highly applauded, above all in national education. Following the emperor's order, the first imperial examination of a Vietnamese monarch based on Confucian learning was organized in the second month in 1072 with Lê Văn Thịnh becoming the first first-rank laureate in the history of imperial examinations in Vietnam. Afterwards Lê Văn Thịnh was promoted to the position of chancellor in 1086. However the new Chancellor soon lost his position in 1096 after a controversial case of treason, was stripped of all titles, and banished. Besides Lê Văn Thịnh, Mạc Hiển Tích was also a capable official who found his way to the royal court from the Confucian learning that was continuously being developed by the emperor, especially after his decree establishing the first school for Confucian students in Đại Việt, \"Quốc tử giám\" (國子監, National Academy), in 1076. In 1089 Lý Nhân Tông made another important decision when he reformed the ranking of officials in the royal court and in the country. To protect the capital Thăng Long against floods, Lý Nhân Tông initiated the construction of the Cổ Xá Dike, one of the first dike systems in Đại Việt.\n\nRelations between the Lý Dynasty and the Song Dynasty began to deteriorate when the Song chancellor Wang Anshi brought out his reforms in 1069. According to Trần Trọng Kim in his \"Việt Nam sử lược\", knowing that the Song emperor was preparing for an invasion in Đại Việt, Lý Nhân Tông decided to stay one step ahead by ordering the generals Lý Thường Kiệt and Tôn Đản to launch a military campaign under the pretext of \"rescuing Chinese people from the cruel reforms.\" In 1075, the Lý army led by Lý Thường Kiệt attacked the Lian and Qin provinces of the Song Dynasty while another army led by Tôn Đản besieged the citadel of Yongzhou. Although Lý Thường Kiệt succeeded in defeating the Song reinforcements intended for Yongzhou, the Song army and people in the citadel were still able to stand the besiegement for 40 days and inflicted high casualties on the Lý forces. As a result, when the Lý army finally ended the siege of Yongzhou, the Lý generals decided to get revenge by killing more than 58,000 people in the city. Several sources estimate that the total number of people killed by Lý troops during this campaign totaled 100,000. In response to the sudden attack, the Song emperor began an invasion of Đại Việt in the twelfth month of 1076 with the support of the Song's vassal kingdoms, Champa and the Khmer. After an initial, rapid advance, the Song forces were stopped by the Lý defense along the Như Nguyệt River led by Lý Thường Kiệt. In avoiding this strong defence system, the commander of the Song army decided to change the army's direction towards the nearby region of Phú Lương, where they defeated Lý Thường Kiệt's forces in a major battle. As the Song forces took the offensive, while the Lý Dynasty had to strenuously hold on to their costly defensive front, Lý Thường Kiệt tried to boost the morale of his soldiers by a poem named \"Nam quốc sơn hà\". Afterwards this poem was considered the first Declarations of independence of Vietnam. Being aware of the unfavourable situation of the Lý army, Lý Nhân Tông finally decided to propose a cease-fire which was accepted by the Song dynasty since they had lost 400,000 men to battles and the harsh weather of Đại Việt. The Song army retreated after occupying a vast region near the border between the two countries; however, this region was gradually returned to the Lý Dynasty after several diplomatic efforts made by the Vietnamese envoys Đào Tôn Nguyên and Lê Văn Thịnh.\n\nIn the south, hostilities soon flared between the Lý dynasty and Champa. Appointed for the position of commander-in-chief of the Lý army by Lý Nhân Tông, Lý Thường Kiệt often personally commanded operations in the southern border where he defeated the army of Champa several times with the last victory in 1104, only one year before his death in 1105. The success of Lý Thường Kiệt during his military campaigns against the kingdom of Champa helped Lý Nhân Tông to stabilize the southern region for the later years of his reign.\n\nAlthough Lý Nhân Tông had three empresses, Lan Anh, Khâm Thiên and Chấn Bảo, he was unable to have his own son; thus, the emperor decided to adopt sons of the Marquises Sùng Hiền, Thành Khánh, Thành Quảng, Thành Chiêu, Thành Hưng, so that the emperor could choose a capable successor to maintain the throne for the Lý Dynasty. Finally, being an intelligent and vivacious boy, Marquis Sùng Hiền's son Lý Dương Hoán was made the crown prince at the age of 2 in 1117. In December 1127 after a 56-year reign, Lý Nhân Tông died at Vĩnh Quang Palace at the age of 61 and was succeeded by Lý Dương Hoán, now the emperor Lý Thần Tông. In his last will, Lý Nhân Tông still expressed his concern for the country and only wished for a prosperous nation (\"bốn bể yên vui\") and a stable frontier (\"biên thuỳ ít loạn\").\n\nThe 55-year rule of Lý Nhân Tông is the longest reign in the history of Vietnamese monarchs. For his contributions, Lý Nhân Tông is still considered a great emperor of the Lý Dynasty, credited with solidifying the Lý Dynasty's rule in Vietnam and stabilizing the country for future Lý emperors. During his 55 years of rule, Lý Nhân Tông not only cultivated the agriculture and military strength of Đại Việt, but also established a national education for Confucian learning with the establishment of the first imperial examinations and the first imperial school for Confucian learning in Thăng Long which is still preserved today. Besides these accomplishments, Lý Nhân Tông is well known for his talent in writing poetry with three poems that still remain, \"Tán Giác Hải thiền sư, Thông Huyền đạo nhân\", \"Truy tán Vạn Hạnh thiền sư\" and \"Lâm chung di chiếu\". To commemorate the successful reign of Lý Nhân Tông, a stele was erected in 1121 with the content composed by the minister of justice Nguyễn Công Bật. Called Sùng Thiện Diên Linh Stele, this work still stands today and is considered one of the most important steles in the History of Vietnam.\n\n|- style=\"text-align: center;\"\n"}

{"id": "2090253", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2090253", "title": "Intragenomic conflict", "text": "Intragenomic conflict\n\nIntragenomic conflict refers to the evolutionary phenomenon where genes have phenotypic effects that promote their own transmission in detriment of the transmission of other genes that reside in the same genome. The selfish gene theory postulates that natural selection will increase the frequency of those genes whose phenotypic effects cause their transmission to new organisms, and most genes achieve this by cooperating with other genes in the same genome to build an organism capable of reproducing and/or helping kin to reproduce. The assumption of the prevalence of intragenomic cooperation underlies the organism-centered concept of inclusive fitness. However, conflict among genes in the same genome may arise both in events related to reproduction (a selfish gene may \"cheat\" and increase its own presence in gametes or offspring above the expected according to fair Mendelian segregation and fair gametogenesis) and altruism (genes in the same genome may disagree on how to value other organisms in the context of helping kin because coefficients of relatedness diverge between genes in the same genome).\n\nAutosomic genes usually have the same mode of transmission in sexually reproducing species due to the fairness of Mendelian segregation, but conflicts among alleles of autosomic genes may arise when an allele cheats during gametogenesis (segregation distortion) or eliminates embryos that don't contain it (lethal maternal effects). An allele may also directly convert its rival allele into a copy of itself (homing endonucleases). Finally, mobile genetic elements completely bypass Mendelian segregation, being able to insert new copies of themselves into new positions in the genome (transposons).\n\nIn principle, the two parental alleles have equal probabilities of being present in the mature gamete. However, there are several mechanisms that lead to an unequal transmission of parental alleles from parents to offspring. One example is a gene, called a \"segregation distorter\", that \"cheats\" during meiosis or gametogenesis and thus is present in more than half of the functional gametes. The most studied examples are \"sd\" in \"Drosophila melanogaster\" (fruit fly), \"t\" haplotype in \"Mus musculus\" (mouse) and \"sk\" in \"Neurospora\" spp. (fungus). Possible examples have also been reported in humans.\nSegregation distorters that are present in sexual chromosomes (as is the case with the X chromosome in several \"Drosophila\" species) are denominated sex-ratio distorters, as they induce a sex-ratio bias in the offspring of the carrier individual.\n\nThe most simple model of meiotic drive involves two tightly linked loci: a \"Killer\" locus and a \"Target\" locus. The segregation distorter set is composed by the allele \"Killer\" (in the \"Killer\" locus) and the allele \"Resistant\" (in the \"Target\" locus), while its rival set is composed by the alleles \"Non-killer\" and \"Non-resistant\". So, the segregation distorter set produces a toxin to which it is itself resistant, while its rival is not. Thus, it kills those gametes containing the rival set and increases in frequency. The tight linkage between these loci is crucial, so these genes usually lie on low-recombination regions of the genome.\n\nOther systems do not involve gamete destruction, but rather use the asymmetry of meiosis in females: the driving allele ends up in the oocyte instead of in the polar bodies with a probability greater than one half. This is termed true meiotic drive, as it does not rely on a post-meiotic mechanism. The best-studied examples include the neocentromeres (knobs) of maize, as well as several chromosomal rearrangements in mammals. The general molecular evolution of centromeres is likely to involve such mechanisms.\n\nThe Medea gene causes the death of progeny from a heterozygous mother that do not inherit it. It occurs in the flour beetle (\"Tribolium castaneum\"). Maternal-effect selfish genes have been successfully synthesized in the lab.\n\nTransposons are autonomous replicating genes that encode the ability to move to new positions in the genome and therefore accumulate in the genomes. They replicate themselves in spite of being detrimental to the rest of the genome.\nThey are often called 'jumping genes' or parasitic DNA and were discovered by Barbara McClintock in 1944.\n\nHoming endonuclease genes (HEG) convert their rival allele into a copy of themselves, and are thus inherited by nearly all meiotic daughter cells of a heterozygote cell. They achieve this by encoding an endonuclease which breaks the rival allele. This break is repaired by using the sequence of the HEG as template.\n\nHEGs encode sequence-specific endonucleases. The recognition sequence (RS) is 15–30 bp long and usually occurs once in the genome. HEGs are located in the middle of their own recognition sequences.\nMost HEGs are encoded by self-splicing introns (group I & II) and inteins. Inteins are internal protein fragments produced from protein splicing and usually contain endonuclease and splicing activities.\nThe allele without the HEGs are cleaved by the homing endonuclease and the double-strand break are repaired by homologous recombination (gene conversion) using the allele containing HEGs as template. Both chromosomes will contain the HEGs after repair.\n\nB-chromosomes are nonessential chromosomes; not homologous with any member of the normal (A) chromosome set; morphologically and structurally different from the A's; and they are transmitted at higher-than-expected frequencies, leading to their accumulation in progeny. In some cases, there is strong evidence to support the contention that they are simply \"selfish\" and that they exist as parasitic chromosomes. They are found in all major taxonomic groupings of both plants and animals.\n\nSince nuclear and cytoplasmic genes usually have different modes of transmission, intragenomic conflicts between them may arise. Mitochondria and chloroplasts are two examples of sets of cytoplasmic genes that commonly have exclusive maternal inheritance, similar to endosymbiont parasites in arthropods, like \"Wolbachia\".\n\nAnisogamy generally produces zygotes that inherit cytoplasmic elements exclusively from the female gamete. Thus, males represent dead-ends to these genes. Because of this fact, cytoplasmic genes have evolved a number of mechanisms to increase the production of female descendants and eliminate offspring not containing them.\n\nMale organisms are converted into females by cytoplasmic inherited protists (Microsporidia) or bacteria (\"Wolbachia\"), regardless of nuclear sex-determining factors. This occurs in amphipod and isopod Crustacea and Lepidoptera.\n\nMale embryos (in the case of cytoplasmic inherited bacteria) or male larvae (in the case of Microsporidia) are killed. In the case of embryo death, this diverts investment from males to females who can transmit these cytoplasmic elements (for instance, in ladybird beetles, infected female hosts eat their dead male brothers, which is positive from the viewpoint of the bacterium). In the case of microsporidia-induced larval death, the agent is transmitted out of the male lineage (through which it cannot be transmitted) into the environment, where it may be taken up again infectiously by other individuals. Male-killing occurs in many insects. In the case of male embryo death, a variety of bacteria have been implicated, including \"Wolbachia\".\n\nIn some cases anther tissue (male gametophyte) is killed by mitochondria in monoecious angiosperms, increasing energy and material spent in developing female gametophytes. This leads to a shift from monoecy to gynodioecy, where part of the plants in the population are male-sterile.\n\nIn certain haplodiploid Hymenoptera and mites, in which males are produced asexually, \"Wolbachia\" and \"Cardinium\" can induce duplication of the chromosomes and thus convert the organisms into females. The cytoplasmic bacterium forces haploid cells to go through incomplete mitosis to produce diploid cells which therefore will be female. This produces an entirely female population. If antibiotics are administered to populations which have become asexual in this way, they revert to sexuality instantly, as the cytoplasmic bacteria forcing this behaviour upon them are removed.\n\nIn many arthropods, zygotes produced by sperm of infected males and ova of non-infected females can be killed by \"Wolbachia\" or \"Cardinium\".\n\nConflict between chromosomes has been proposed as an element in the evolution of sex.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2090258", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2090258", "title": "Bob Veale", "text": "Bob Veale\n\nRobert Andrew Veale (born October 28, 1935) is an American former professional baseball player and coach. He played in Major League Baseball as a left-handed pitcher from through for the Pittsburgh Pirates and Boston Red Sox. Veale was one of the top strikeout pitchers in the National League during his tenure with the Pirates. The two-time All-Star player was the National League strikeout leader in . He was a member of the Pirates teams that won three consecutive National League Eastern Division titles between and and, won the World Series in . Veale also played for the Boston Red Sox from 1972 to 1974.\n\nVeale was born in Birmingham, Alabama where he attended Holy Family High School in the Ensley neighborhood. His father had played baseball as a pitcher for the Homestead Grays of the Negro National League. As a boy, Veale worked the concession stand at Rickwood Field in Birmingham. The Birmingham Black Barons player-manager Piper Davis made him the team's batboy and let him pitch batting practice regularly. In 1948, Davis allowed the underaged Veale to pitch in a Black Barons game however, because he was a minor, his appearance was kept off the records. Veale left Birmingham in 1955 to attend Benedictine College in Atchison, Kansas on an athletic scholarship. \n\nIn 1958, Veale was signed by the Pittsburgh Pirates as an amateur free agent. In 1959, he led the Carolina League with 187 strikeouts in 147 innings and pitched a no-hitter for the Wilson Tobs. His performance earned him a promotion to the Columbus Jets of the International League where, he established himself as a strikeout pitcher in 1961 by striking out a league-leading 208 batters in 201 innings.\n\nVeale made his major league debut with the Pirates on April 16, 1962 at the age of 26. He had one complete game victory in only his second major league game but then, struggled and was sent back to the Columbus Jets on May 25. On August 10 he set an International League record for the most strikeouts in a game with 22 against the Buffalo Bisons. On September 3, he pitched a one-hitter against Jacksonville and struck out 15 batters. After striking out 179 batters in 134 innings and winning eight games, Veale was called back by the Pirates in September.\n\nPirates manager Danny Murtaugh made Veale a starting pitcher in August 1963 and he responded impressively in September by throwing three complete games in six starts, including two shutouts. On September 22, 1964, Veale struck out 15 Milwaukee Braves to set the Pirates team record for most strikeouts in a nine-inning game, breaking the previous record of 12 set by Babe Adams in 1909. He led the National League with 250 strikeouts in 1964; he had been tied with Bob Gibson with 245 entering the final day of the season. He ended the season with a career-high record of 18-12 and a 2.74 earned run average.\n\nVeale's emergence as one of the top strikeout pitchers in the league helped earn him a spot on the National League team in the 1965 All-Star Game. He struck out 16 batters on June 1 against the Philadelphia Phillies to break his own team record. In 1965, he improved his personal best with a career-high 276 strikeouts but, finished a distant second to Sandy Koufax's then-Major League record 382 strikeouts. He ended the season with a 17-12 win-loss record and a 2.84 earned run average to help the Pirates improve to a third place finish in the National League. His 276 strikeouts in a season remains a Pirates modern-era team record.\n\nVeale was an integral member of the Pirates pitching staff during the 1966 season posting a 16-12 record and a 3.02 earned run average in 37 starts and was named to the National League team for the 1966 All-Star Game. The 1966 Pirates team which, included future Baseball Hall of Fame members Roberto Clemente, Bill Mazeroski and Willie Stargell as well as the National League batting champion Matty Alou, fought the Los Angeles Dodgers and San Francisco Giants in a tight pennant race and were in first place on September 10, before they faltered to finish the season in third place for a second consecutive year. Veale began the 1967 season by winning his first six starts and seven of his first eight starts. He ended the season with 16 victories against 8 losses but, his earned run average rose to 3.64. \n\nAn elbow injury in 1968 forced him to alter his pitching motion and reduced his strikeout rates. Veale had a losing record of 13-14 but, had an impressive 2.05 ERA, the lowest ERA since by a pitcher with more than 20 starts and a losing record. In 1969 Veale had his last 200-plus strikeout season but, in 1970 his ERA rose to 3.92. Veale had maintained a 200-plus inning workload for seven consecutive seasons between 1964 and 1970. There were rumors that he might be traded prior to the 1971 season but instead, Murtaugh moved him to the bullpen. \n\nThe 1971 season turned to be one of the most successful in team history as the Pirates won the National League Eastern Division. Veale had a 6-0 win-loss record in 37 appearances out the bullpen. Although his earned run average was a very high 6.99, he pitched strongly in September as the Pirates made their push for the division title. On September 1, 1971, the Pirates became the first major league team to start a lineup of all minorities. Veale entered the game in the third inning in relief of starter Dock Ellis. The Pirates then defeated the San Francisco Giants three games to one in the 1971 National League Championship Series to face the Baltimore Orioles in the 1971 World Series. In the only postseason appearance of his career, he faced five batters, allowing two inherited runners to score on two walks and one hit as the Orioles won 11-3 in Game 2. The Pirates would go on to win the World Series in seven games.\n\nOn May 10 1972 the Pirates released Veale and he agreed to accept an assignment to the Pirates' Triple-A team in Charleston. On September 1, the Boston Red Sox signed Veale and used him as a relief pitcher. He played in his final major league game on September 8, 1974 at the age of 38.\n\nIn a thirteen-season major league career, Veale posted a 120-95 record with 1,703 strikeouts and a 3.07 ERA in 1,926 innings pitched, including 20 shutouts and 78 complete games. His lifetime ratio of 7.96 strikeouts per nine innings is still a Pirates career team record and,\nranks fifth all-time for pitchers with 1,500-plus innings and, 65th overall on the MLB All-Time List. His 16 strikeouts in a game remains a Pirates team record. When he retired in 1974, he was the only Pirate pitcher to have 200 strikeouts in a season. Veale ranks second to Bob Friend in Pirates career strikeouts. He was among the top three strikeout pitchers in the National League three times and, he led the league in walks four times, tying a modern record.\n\nAfter his playing career, Veale worked as a minor-league pitching instructor for the Atlanta Braves and the New York Yankees.\n\nIn 2006, Veale was inducted into the Alabama Sports Hall of Fame.\n\n\n"}

According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nLocated east of Tagbilaran, Loboc is known for its lunch cruises along the scenic and winding Loboc River. Tourists also come to see the tarsier, a small nocturnal animal with large red eyes. It is one of the world's smallest primates. The Loboc Children's Choir has won numerous competitions both domestic and international.\n\nUntil the 2013 earthquake, portions of the Loboc Church complex (specifically parts of what became the convent or priests' residence) were amongst the oldest standing ecclesiastical structures in Bohol province. The earthquake also damaged the lunch cruise Docking Port, and some damage to the pedestrian river bridge and its passenger elevator.\n\nAt the end of 2014, Tropical storm Seniang passed directly over the Loboc river area. Although the winds were relatively low strength, Seniang brought with it much rainfall. This caused the river to burst its banks in several places: the entire poblacion main plaza was flooded, including the town hall; many of the lunch cruise boats were damaged; and the accumulated debris of the church was disturbed and some washed away. It was fortunate that the new replacement bridge across the river had been completed just a few weeks before, allowing traffic to reach Tagbilaran via Sikatuna because the Loay interior road was damaged and impassable.\n\nThe Loboc Church is currently in the tentative list for UNESCO World Heritage Sites under the \"Baroque Churches of the Philippines (Extension)\". A proposal has been suggested by scholars to make a separate UNESCO inclusion for the \"Old Centre of Loboc which includes the Loboc Church\". The same would be made for other churches listed in UNESCO's tentative sites, where each town plaza and surrounding heritage buildings would be added. No government agency has yet to take action on the proposal.\n\nSince pre-Hispanic times, Loboc has always been an inland market village where produce from the sea was bartered for the agricultural goods of the upland regions. It is said to be the domain of Sigala, another chief of Bohol, whose contemporary, Sikatuna, made the famous Blood Compact with Miguel López de Legazpi in 1565.\n\nIn 1596, the Jesuit Fr Juan de Torres came to Loboc from Baclayon to found the second Christian settlement on the island. After the traumatic Moro raid on Baclayon on 26 October 1600, the Jesuit missionaries decided to move the center of their missionary activities to the inland village of Loboc. By 1602, Loboc became a parish, making it the oldest on the island. To the Jesuits, Loboc was the \"\"Residencia Boholana\"\", where their local superior resided. It remained so until the middle of the 18th century when the exigencies of the times forced to them to move once more to Baclayon.\n\nAround 1604, the Jesuits established a \"Seminario-Colegio\" or boarding school for native boys. This school laid the foundation of the musical culture of the town. Today the name Loboc is synonymous with musical acumen.\n\nThe Loboc Church is one of the most beautiful in the entire province. The first stone church was built in 1602. It was destroyed by fire in 1638 and its replacement built beside the site of the older one. This is the church presently standing, a fine example of the Jesuit colonial architecture of the 18th century.\n\nAfter the expulsion of the Jesuits in 1768, the Augustinian Recollects took over and renovated the unfinished structure. They were responsible for the free-standing bell tower, the arcade façade, the mortuary chapel, the heavy stone buttresses and the unique three-storey convent built into the fabric of the Jesuit-built 17th century church.\n\nTwo saintly figures lived and were buried in Loboc church: Fr Alonso Humanes SJ whose grave became the object of pilgrimages after his death in 1633, and the native boy, Miguel Ayatumo, a student of the Seminario Colegio, who died in the odor of sanctity at the age of sixteen in 1609. Contemporary Jesuit records speak glowingly of this \"Aloysius Gonzaga\" of Bohol.\n\nLoboc Church contains a lot of interesting treasures. Among these are the decorative stone carvings and friezes on the exterior walls; a relief of St. Ignatius Loyola in polychrome stucco hidden behind the main altar, seven ancient retablos from both the Jesuit and Recollect periods; ceiling murals executed in the 1920s by Cebuano artists Ray Francia and Canuto Avila, one depicting the miracle of Our Lady of Guadalupe, the town's secondary patron, during the great flood of 1876; carved wooden cornices and decorative corbels shaped as gargoyles or mythical animals.\n\nMuch of the early history of Bohol was made around the town and church of Loboc. It would not be an understatement to say that to know Loboc is to understand the entire drama of Bohol history. At present, Loboc church is deteriorating, ignored by tourists and visitors and continually threatened by the annual flood that has already robbed it of its ancient records and other priceless relics. The church was severely damaged by the 2013 Bohol earthquake, and the tropical storm Seniang at the end of 2014 washed away most of the remains waiting for repair.\n\nIn 1942, Japanese troops occupied Loboc. In 1945, Loboc was liberated by the Philippine Commonwealth Army troops of the 8th and 83rd Infantry Division together with the Boholano guerrillas at the end in World War II.\n\nLoboc comprises 28 barangays:\n\n"}

He also played for five football clubs.\n\nSugg was born at Ilkeston, Derbyshire and became a solicitor's clerk and was living with his widowed mother at Nether Hallam in 1881. Though born in Derbyshire, he lived his early life in Yorkshire and made his first-class debut for Yorkshire in 1883. In the 1884 season, Sugg went to play for Derbyshire where he was top scorer for the club and regarded as the best bat in a team that suffered the rare ignominy of an anti-perfect season losing all ten of its county games.

In 1910, the name of the agency was changed to the Baldwin–Felts Detective Agency, and its headquarters were in Bluefield, West Virginia.\nOriginally, the company provided investigative services to railroads for train robberies and other crimes. Little is known about this chapter in the history of Baldwin–Felts, but it is known that the company provided guards for railway and mine payrolls and accompanied coal trains into the coalfields. The company investigated train wrecks, robberies, and thefts. By the early 1900s, the agency had also undertaken detective work for both federal and state government agencies.\n\nThe agency rose to national prominence with the pursuit and capture of the fugitive of Floyd Allen and members of his family who were involved in a courtroom shootout in Carroll County, Hillsville, Virginia. Five people died and seven were wounded, including Commonwealth Attorney William Foster, Sheriff Lewis F. Webb, and Judge Thornton Lemmon Massie. The event was reported nationally from March 13 to April 15, 1912.\n\nAt the time, Virginia law required the local sheriff to head the criminal investigation and pursue those suspected of committing the killings. No provision for succession after his death had been provided for in the law, and his deputies lost all their legal powers until the next election. Faced with the dilemma, Virginia Governor William Hodges Mann sent a telegram to the Baldwin–Felts agency to apprehend the fugitives:\n\nSend troops to the County of Carroll at once. Mob violence, the court. Commonwealth's Attorney, Sheriff, some jurors and others shot on the conviction of Floyd Allen for a felony. Sheriff and Commonwealth's Attorney dead, court serious. Look after this now.\nThe detectives cut a wide swathe through Carroll County in their quest. The wounded Allen was arrested at his hotel by Felts personally. Most of the Allens and their relations were arrested by a posse of Baldwin–Felts detectives, who chased down the fugitives in a relentless search that was carried out regardless of weather conditions. Nevertheless, two of the men (Sidna Allen and Wesley Edwards) escaped to Des Moines, Iowa. An informant (Maude Iroller) tipped the agency as to the men's whereabouts, and the fugitives were arrested and brought back to Carroll County before the end of the year.\n\nBy the 1910s, railroad crimes and associated banditry had decreased in the United States. Therefore, Baldwin–Felts began hiring out their detectives as private security forces for mining companies and so the company is remembered for its violent confrontations with the labor unions. \n\nBaldwin–Felts was allowed to operate like that because public law enforcement and the maintenance of order in labor disputes were often left to company owners. Therefore, they could employ the likes of Baldwin–Felts to suppress strikes; collect intelligence on unions; prevent labor organizers from entering company grounds; and evict the families of union members living in company-owned housing who had gone on strike or failed to pay rent.\n\nIn 1912, Baldwin–Felts agents were soon employed strikebreaking in West Virginia at the Pocohantas Coal Fields and the Paint Creek-Cabin Creek. Their thuggish behaviour and their known propensity for violence led the former Attorney General of West Virginia, Howard B. Lee, to remark in his 1969 book that Baldwin and Felt were the \"two most feared and hated men in the mountains.\"\n\nBetween 1913 and 1914, Baldwin–Felts agents had moved west and become involved in another coal field struggle in Las Animas County, Colorado. Agency detectives were employed in squads to harass striking workers. They used an armored car with a mounted machine gun (it was called the \"Death Special\" by the miners). The events culminated in the violent confrontation known as the Ludlow Massacre, when the Colorado National Guard used machine guns to kill 21 people, including miners' wives and children.\n\nThe most infamous striking breaking action undertaken by the Baldwin-Felts was in Matewan, West Virginia. A confrontation between locals and agents resulted in the deaths of two miners and Matewan's Mayor as well as seven Baldwin-Felts detectives including Thomas Felts' brothers, Albert and Lee.\n\nOn May 19, 1920, 12 Baldwin-Felts agents, including Lee Felts, arrived in Matewan, West Virginia and met with Albert Felts, who was already in the area. Albert and Lee were the brothers of Thomas Felts, the co-owner and director of the agency. Albert had already been in the area and had tried to bribe Mayor Testerman with $500 to place machine guns on roofs in the town; Testerman refused. That afternoon Albert and Lee along with 11 other men set out to the Stone Mountain Coal Co. property. The first family they evicted was a woman and her children; the woman's husband was not home at the time. They forced them out at gunpoint and threw their belongings in the road under a light but steady rain. The miners who saw it were furious, and sent word to town.\n\nAs the agents walked to the train station to leave town, Police Chief Sid Hatfield and a group of deputized miners confronted them and told them they were under arrest. Albert Felts replied that in fact he had a warrant for Hatfield's arrest. Testerman was alerted, and he ran out into the street after a miner shouted that Sid had been arrested. Hatfield backed into the store and Testerman asked to see the warrant. After reviewing it, the mayor exclaimed, \"This is a bogus warrant.\" With these words, a gunfight erupted and Hatfield shot Albert Felts. Testerman and Albert and Lee Felts were among the ten men killed (three from the town and seven from the agency). Albert and Lee Felts were buried in Galax, Virginia in what is now the Felts Memorial Cemetery. Their funeral was attended by over 3,000 people.\n\nThis gunfight became known as the Matewan Massacre, and its symbolic significance was enormous for the miners. The seemingly invincible Baldwin-Felts had been beaten. Sid Hatfield became an immediate legend and hero to the union miners, and a symbol of hope that the oppression of coal operators and their hired guns could be overthrown. Throughout the summer and into the fall of 1920 the union gained strength in Mingo County, as did the resistance of the coal operators. Low-intensity warfare was waged up and down the Tug River. In late June state police under the command of Captain Brockus raided the Lick Creek tent colony near Williamson. Miners were said to have fired on Brockus and Martin's men from the colony, and in response the state police shot and arrested miners, ripped the canvas tents to shreds and scattered the mining families' belongings. Both sides were bolstering their arms, and Sid Hatfield continued to be a problem, especially when he converted Testerman's jewelry store into a gun shop.\n\nOn January 26, 1921, the trial of Hatfield for killing Albert Felts began. It was in the national spotlight and brought much attention to the miners' cause. Hatfield's stature and mythical status grew as the trial proceeded. He posed and talked to reporters, fanning the flames of his own legend. All men were acquitted in the end, but overall the union was facing significant setbacks. Eighty percent of mines had reopened with the importation of replacements and the signing of yellow-dog contracts by ex-strikers returning to the mines. In mid-May 1921 union miners launched a full-scale assault on non-union mines. In a short time the conflict had consumed the entire Tug River Valley. This \"Three Days Battle\" was finally ended by a flag of truce and the implementation of martial law. From the beginning, the miners perceived the enforcement of martial law as one-sided. Hundreds of miners were arrested; the smallest of infractions could mean imprisonment, while those on the side of \"law and order\" were seen as immune. The miners responded with guerrilla tactics and violence.\n\nIn the midst of this tense situation, Hatfield traveled to McDowell County on 1 August 1921 to stand trial on charges of dynamiting a coal tipple. Along with him traveled a good friend, Ed Chambers, and their wives. As they walked up the courthouse stairs, unarmed and flanked by their wives, a group of Baldwin-Felts agents standing at the top of the stairs opened fire. Hatfield was killed instantly. Chambers was bullet-riddled and rolled to the bottom of the stairs. Despite Sally Chambers' protests, one of the agents (Charles Everett Lively) ran down the stairs and shot Chambers once more, point blank in the back of the head. Hatfield's and Chambers' bodies were returned to Matewan, and word of the slayings spread through the mountains.\n\nThe miners were angry at the way Hatfield had been slain, and that it appeared the assassins would escape punishment. They began to pour out of the mountains and take up arms.\n\nBoth Baldwin and Felts were also involved in banking, and Baldwin later served as president and member of the board of directors of several banks. Felts was later elected to two terms as a Virginia state senator.\n\nBaldwin died in 1936, at 75; Felts died a year later, at 69. In 1937, four months before his death, Felts had formally dissolved the Baldwin–Felts Detective Agency. By then, strikebreaking work had declined. State and federal legislation outlawing the use of private detectives for the purpose of spying on or harassing workers, along with shifting public opinion, had made such detectives less useful to management in labor disputes.\n\nAfter the agency closed its doors, most of the company's files were destroyed or lost. The largest collection of extant files is housed at the Eastern Regional Coal Archives, in Bluefield, West Virginia.\n\n\n"}

The town is named after Datu Sikatuna, the ancient chieftain of Bohol, although there is no evidence he lived in the area.\n\nThe town of Sikatuna,Bohol celebrates its feast on June 12-13, to honor the town patron Saint Anthony De Padua.\n\nSikatuna was formerly a part of the towns of Baclayon and Alburquerque. While part of Baclayon, Sikatuna was known as barrio Cambojod. Once Alburquerque became a town, Sikatuna was made a part of its new territory and given the name Cornago. Sikatuna became its own town in 1917. The ten barangays that now comprise Sikatuna were taken from three neighboring old municipalities: Alburquerque, Loboc, and Balilihan. In the original municipal ordinance converting barrio Cornago into a municipality, the municipal boundary was defined as barrio Cornago plus four northern barrios of Alburquerque: Libjo, Abucay Sur, Abucay Norte, and Can-agong. However, Senator Jose A. Clarin helped increase the territorial boundary by taking two barrios from Loboc: Cambuac Sur and Cambuac Norte; and two barrios from Balilihan: Badiang and Bahay-bahay. Cornago was divided into Poblacion I and Poblacion II.\n\nDuring the Japanese occupation of the Philippines, Japanese forces established a garrison at the municipal building and installed a puppet mayor. During this time, Sikatuna became a haven for evacuees, both from neighboring towns and from nearby Cebu. The most famous evacuee was Don Mariano Jesus Cuenco who, after the war, became Senator and later, Secretary of Public Works. In 1945, Sikatuna was entered by Philippine Commonwealth Army soldiers and Boholano guerrillas fought against the Japanese Imperial forces during the Second Battle of Bohol.\n\nSikatuna comprises 10 barangays. Of these, only Poblacion I is classified as urban and the rest are rural.\n\n"}
{"id": "2090295", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2090295", "title": "Talibon, Bohol", "text": "Talibon, Bohol\n\n', officially the ', (; ), is a in the province of , . According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nIt is located from Tagbilaran.\n\nTalibon is the seat of the diocese of Talibon and is the resident town of the bishop.\n\nThe town of Talibon, Bohol celebrates its feast on the last Saturday of May, to honor the town patron the Blessed Trinity.\n\nIslands in Talibon, including Nocnocan, Calituban and Guindacpan are considered to be one of the densely populated islands in the world.\n\nThe name Talibon is said to come from the word \"talibong\" which means bolo or spear, an instrument used in gold mining. There is no actual record to show how the name came about but per the records of the travels of Jesuit missionary, Fr. Juan de Torres, he went to the gold mines of Talibong. It already had its name before the first arrival of the first Spanish missionary.\n\nAccording to archival researches of F. Jose Maria Luengo, priest, historian and founder of the Mater Dei College of Tubigon, Talibon traces its history back to the time of Ferdinand Magellan after his death on 27 April 1521. Escaping from the hands of Lapu-Lapu's men, who were bent on revenge for the raping of 50 virgins of Cebu, the ship Trinidad sailed in the direction of Getafe and Talibon, where some of the crew disembarked and mingled with the natives of the place.\n\nTaking native wives and teaching them the rudiments of Christianity, they dedicated the place where they lived to the Most Holy Trinity (\"Santisima Trinidad\") in honor of the patrons of their fateful ship. The survivors became the first lay missionaries to Bohol and Fr. Luengo called them the Trinidad Christians of Talibon.\n\nIn 1830, Talibon was established as an independent municipality from Inabanga. The following year, Talibon became a parish dedicated to the Most Holy Trinity, with Fr. Ramon de Santa Ana as the first parish priest.\n\nAt first, a ramshackle hut built by the natives served as the church but in 1852 construction of the permanent church was started. With forced labor and the use of blocks of coral rocks, the church was built on an elevated plain overlooking the sea and finished in 1899.\n\nDuring World War II, a guerrilla force was organized and took control and authority over the town of Talibon. Then Senator Carlos P. Garcia, acted as High Adviser to the group and during the Japanese occupation, narrowly escaped capture by fleeing with his family to Leyte. In reprisal, the Japanese soldiers burned down the Garcia house on 4 July 1942.\n\nIn 1957, when Carlos P. Garcia became the fourth president of the Philippines, the church was renovated. In 1986, the Diocese of Talibon was created.\n\nThe town of Talibon is located on the northern side of Bohol. It is bounded on the east by Bien Unido, on the south by Trinidad on the north by Camotes Sea and on the west by Getafe. Talibon has a land area of of which about (%) is classified as urban, while the remaining is rural.\n\nIt is accessible by land from capital Tagbilaran via western or eastern exits of Bohol Circumferential Road, which are respectively, or through the interior road via Loboc which is . It can be accessed by boat direct from Cebu City or via Tubigon then by land from Tubigon to Talibon.\n\nTalibon comprises 25 barangays: 17 mainland and 8 island barangays.\n\nMajor industries in Talibon are farming and fishing with major products rice, corn, copra, banana and root crops. It is fast becoming a haven for retailers and wholesalers. It is home to one branch of Alturas group of companies which has established a supermarket in the area.\n\nLocal folks are also into seaweeds farming, rice farming, watermelon farming, and making of fish traps, hats, and pottery. Silica, gold, clay, diorites, sand and gravel abound and quarrying of these minerals is big business at present.\n\nTalibon for years has its share of foreign and domestic tourists who were lured to the town for its unexploited beaches, fresh seafood such as crabs and prawns, friendliness of the people and the general atmosphere of peace and order in the town and the neighboring barrios.\n\nPeople also come to see the historic site, the Carlos P. Garcia Monument and Park; the location of which is the birthplace of this son of Talibon who played an important role during the guerilla movement and more so when he became the 4th President of the Republic of the Philippines.\n\nThere are islands that have long been unexploited and surrounded by crystal clear waters and rich marine life. One such islet is the Bongan sandbar, a breathtaking long sandy white beach devoid of vegetation whatsoever. It is a good place to swim, snorkel or scuba dive.\n\nA relatively unknown natural treasure is the Danajon Bank, which is the Philippines' only double barrier reef and one of the few documented double barrier reefs in the world. A very rare geological formation, it comprises two sets of large coral reefs that formed offshore on a submarine ridge due to a combination of favorable tidal currents and coral growth in the area. Talibon town shares responsibility over Danajon together with 9 other Bohol towns that have jurisdiction over the reef.\n\nDanajon Bank is home to a vast array of commercially valuable reef fishes, shellfish, crustaceans and invertebrates such as sea cucumbers and sea urchins. Its extensive seagrass beds are nursery and feeding grounds for various species of rabbitfish (siganids) and sea horses, while its mangroves are spawning habitats for crustaceans, shrimps and various fishes.\n\nIn order to showcase and promote efforts to protect and manage Danajon Bank, the Municipal Government of Talibon opened the CRM Interpretive Center, otherwise known as the Fisheries and Coastal Resource Management Interpretive Center (FCRMIC). Aside from a very educational gallery, the Center boasts a 3D model of Danajon Bank, the first of its kind in Bohol and even in the whole of the Visayas. It is now becoming a drop-in site for school and foreign tours alike.\n\nAware of the vast tourism potential of Talibon, the present administration has set up an \"Eco-Tourism Program\" geared towards the development and promotion of Talibon's assets. Aside from the abovementioned sites, the local government is eyeing the promotion of the of lush mangrove vegetation as an eco-tourist destination.\n\nThe winding Ipil River is another area that has to be promoted for boating, kayaking, and other activities such as fishing, swimming, and the gathering of shells and mollusks that abound in the area. Going inland from the river, one will see wild ducks, herons, and egrets; and in San Isidro, a mangrove area has become the dwelling place of monkeys. Another attraction is the centuries-old \"piyapi\" trees growing abundantly in the area.\n\nAlmost every barangay in its vicinity has its public elementary school, making students, teachers, and parents like have a sufficient array of choices; as do secondary schools have an abundant selection to private and public education.\n\nThe diocese of Talibon comprises half the civil province of Bohol.\n\nThe territory covered by the diocese of Talibon extends from the town of Inabanga on the northwest, through Carmen in the interior, and down to Jagna on the southeast. Its inland boundary bisects the island northwest—southeast, with the other half of the island under the jurisdiction of the diocese of Tagbilaran.\n\nThe first batch of missionaries to arrive were the Augustinian Recollects who came in 1565. When the Jesuits arrived in 1596 and reached the area of Talibon, they were surprised to discover that a Christian community already existed in the area, owing to the Spanish–Talibongnon intermarriages dating back to the 1520s.\n\nAfter the Jesuits came, the faith spread fast revolts in the country against Spain. Tamblot revolted in 1622. Although his success lasted only for six months, his revolt is recorded as the first unbeaten revolt in Philippine history. In 1744 Dagohoy revolted and gained independence for the island of Bohol for eighty years.\n\nOn 8 November 1941, the Diocese of Tagbilaran was established and was given jurisdiction over the entire province of Bohol, separating it from Cebu, its mother diocese. On 9 January 1986, the new Diocese of Talibon was created, separating half of Bohol from the Diocese of Tagbilaran. Most Rev. Christian Vicente Fernandez Noel, D.D., was appointed as its first bishop in September 1986 and whose office he held until Pope Francis appointed Most Rev. Patrick Daniel Y. Parcon, D.D. on 6 June 2014 as its second bishop, and eventually installed on 22 August 2014.\n\nToday there are 25 parishes in the diocese, ministered by 50 priests. There are also 35 religious sisters active in the running of 16 secondary Catholic schools.\n\n\n"}

It has recently expanded its seaport to accommodate additional sea traffic.\n\nTubigon is well known for its \"lambay\" crabs.\n\nThe town of Tubigon, Bohol celebrates its feast on May 10, to honor the town patron San Isidro Labrador.\n\nThe first settlers in Tubigon settled along the shores of the river that flows through the community. Their exact origins are unknown but they are thought to be early Malays from southeast Asian countries, migrating to the Philippines in small bangkas. Seasonal overflowing of the river flooded the community and led the place to be called \"Tubigan\" (meaning \"place having water\" or \"watery\"), which later morphed into \"Tubigon\" (meaning \"place abounding in water\"). The first record of the town of Tubigon dates from the early part of the 17th century.\n\nIn 1816, the community organized itself under a recognized headman, Yguiz Hutora, who was succeeded by teniente Mijares and by teniente Matong in 1818. A chapel was built on an elevated site of the settlement but had no officiating priest. A coadjutor of the Spanish friars from the Calape parish would perform the religious ceremonies.\n\nIn 1819, by authority of the Spanish Governor of Cebu, Tubigon was formally organized into an independent town by separating from the town of Calape, with Capitan Teniente Matong becoming the first \"gobernadorcillo\".\n\nStarting in 1852, the exact boundaries of the municipality were defined. On 8 March of that year, sitio Bacane was made the boundary between Tubigon and Inabanga. In 1856, the boundary with Calape was fixed at Mandaug. On 19 June 1865, the boundary between Tubigon and Catigbian was set at the Sampilangon River and on 14 September 1913, the boundary with Antequera (currently San Isidro) was fixed at sitio Tubod.\n\nOn 31 January 1919, Tubigon lost five barrios when Clarin was formed by virtue of proclamation by Governor Yeater.\n\nTubigon was badly affected by the 2013 Bohol earthquake, suffering 11 fatalities and damage to some 7,300 homes, as well as total destruction of its town hall and church.\n\nTubigon is on the western side of Bohol Island, on the Cebu Strait.\n\nTubigon comprises 34 barangays:\n\nThere about 17 minor islands in the municipal, some of whom are inhabited:\n\nAgriculture and fishing are the primary industries. 60% of the total land area of the municipality is used by agriculture and other related industries. The main agricultural produce includes rice, corn, coconut, bananas and different variety of vegetables.\n\nElectric power is supplied by the Bohol Electric Cooperative I (BOHECO I). Its new administrative building is located in Tubigon along the National Road.\n\nThe main National Road is paved and provides easy access to neighboring coastal communities, with travel time to Tagbilaran about one hour. There are inland roads to Catigbian and San Isidro.\n\nPublic utility buses are available daily on routes to any point within the province of Bohol. Trips to Tagbilaran are on a 30-minute interval. Cars and vans are available for rent or charter any time.\n\nTubigon's municipal port is the second largest and busiest port in the province of Bohol. It is served by 6 conventional vessels and 2 modern fastcraft with a total of 20 trips daily to Cebu City. A roll-on/roll-off ferry operated by Lite Shipping Corporation is also operational making two trips daily.\n\nThere is no scheduled ferry service to smaller outlying islands, but outrigger canoes may be chartered any time.\n\n"}

For their secondary education, students go to Valencia High School, a public school.\n\nValencia is the birthplace of former Executive Secretary Juan Pajo.\n\nThe town of Valencia, Bohol celebrates its feast on January 10, to honor the town patron Sr. Santo Niño.\n\nIts former name used to be \"Panangatan\", which comes from the root word \"sang-at\", meaning \"to put up on an elevated place\". This referred to the practice of fishermen from Dimiao and Lila who would put up (\"sang-at\") their boats on the banks of the Panangatan River when taking shelter during the southwest monsoons. Here nipa palms grew along the river, preventing the boats from being washed away by the waves.\n\nPanangatan remained part of Dimiao until 1867. That year a Spanish priest was assigned to the place and it became a separate municipality. The priest gave it a new name, naming after his birthplace in Spain. In 1879 Valencia had a population of 7,009.\n\nValencia comprises 35 barangays:\n\nThe principal industries of the people today are weaving, pot making, and fishing. The most important produce is coconuts, rice, corn and fish.\n\nMarket day, locally known as \"Tabu\", is Sunday. Local produce such as fresh fruits, vegetable, fresh meat and live poultry are sold. The days of this weekly community occasion differ from town to town.\n\nBadiang Spring resort in barangay Anas is a major contribution to local economic activity. Badiang Spring has continuously flowing water from subterranean rocks, which is its main attraction. Not just domestic tourists but foreign tourists too frequent the lot by the shore. Badiang Spring has separate swimming pools for adults and children as well as accommodation facilities.\n\nThe parish of the Santo Niño and the town of Valencia began as barrio Panangatan of Dimiao. Together with adjacent barrios, it was constituted a town in 1869 and a parish in 1871 and named after a city on Spain's southern coast. The church building commenced during the term of Fray Mariano Cornago (1870–77) and was completed in 1882 by Fray Francisco Arraya, who laid the church's wooden floor. The church walls were of tabique but were later replaced by cement.\n\nHeritage Site: The church is cruciform with a steep roof and a pyramidal crossing tower. Cut stone is used in parts of the church like the façade, however, concrete is found elsewhere. The real treasure of the church is its wooden floor of alternating dark (tindalo or balayong) and light (molave or tugas) wood planks. At the transept crossing an eight pointed flower design is used for the floor, while a herringbone pattern is used elsewhere. The interior is unpainted, unlike most Bohol churches and has altars in the neoclassical idiom.\n\nThe convent is located not beside the church as is customary but across the street. This structure was renovated in the 19th century. The fencing of the entire campus of the convent is recent.\n\n"}

According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nUbay is in the northeast of the province, and has an area of , with of coastline. It is the largest and most populated municipality in Bohol.\n\nOne etymology derivation is that the town's name is a contraction of the term \"ubay-ubay\", meaning \"alongside\". \n\nAccording to Kaufmann's Visayan-English dictionary, the Visayan word \"\"ubay\"\" means:\n\nThe flow of seawater between the mainland and the island of Lapinig Grande (now Pres. C.P. Garcia town) could justify the second definition of Ubay. It is a situation that is permanent and the constant reference to the flow of water can make the term ubay be attached as the name of the place.\n\nAn alternative derivation is that the term 'ubay-ubay' or 'alongside' became the byword of seafarers who used to travel close to the shorelines of Ubay to avoid the strong current of the Canigao Channel . There was a single path to follow reach the island trading centres. This trail was located alongside (ubay) the sandy beach. Later on the term Ubay became the original name of the community.\n\nHistorically, Ubay was part of Talibon. On 15 January 1844, it separated from Talibon to become an independent municipality.\n\nThe religious aspect of the town was established much later than the civil aspect of the town. The decree of the Spanish Governor General creating Ubay as a town in the religious aspect is dated 22 October 1877. However, Royal Order No. 695 issued by the Kingdom of Spain has the date 5 October 1877.\n\nThe town celebrates its fiesta every last Friday of January in commemoration and honor of their patron saint, Holy Child. Ubayanons often come home during fiesta to share the joy of reviving the beautiful old story on the origin of the place.\n\nThe town is situated east of Trinidad, north of Alicia and Mabini, and northeast of San Miguel. It is northeast of Tagbilaran, southeast of Manila and east of Cebu City.\n\nThe climate is typically equatorial – temperature range over the year is less than three degrees Celsius ( deg F), and annual rainfall exceeds . The dry season starts in February and lasts through April sometimes extending to midMay. The climate in Ubay falls within Coronas climate type IV, characterised by not very pronounced maximum rainfall with a short dry season from one to three months and a wet season of nine to ten months.\n\nUbay has a tropical climate. Most months of the year are marked by significant precipitation, making agriculture favorable – it supports at least two rice crops per year. The short dry season has little impact. Ubay is classified as Am (Tropical monsoon climate) by climate classification system.\n\nUbay comprises 44 barangays organized into eight urban districts (UD):\n\nWhen the first national census was held in 1903, the municipality had a population 7,355. It continued to grow until 1960 with 34,090 (annual growth rate of over the period). The population markedly decreased in 1970 with the creation of the municipality of President Carlos P. Garcia, formerly a constituent barangay. Since 1970, average annual growth rate (1970–) is .\n\nThe primary language is Cebuano: Filipino and English are understood to a limited degree.\n\nUbay has a number of business establishments commercial trading firms engaged in retail and wholesale. The new public market building was completed in 2000. The regular market day is Monday and local traders from neighboring towns come to sell their merchandise consisting mostly of agricultural products and small consumer items like used clothes, household utensils, and other products. Ubay also provides a market for the neighboring island municipality of Pres. Carlos P. Garcia. Another well-known public market is located in barangay San Pascual, south of the municipality.\n\n\nLike the Sinulog of Cebu, the Ubay-ubay Festival is the town's own version in celebration and honor of the patron saint, Sr. Santo Niño. This colorful and fascinating festivity is a well-attended event where people flock the town's major roads and venues to view the grand street parade and the festival dance-competition. This celebration is held each 28 – 30 January.\n\nUbay is governed by the municipal mayor as head of the municipality. The vice mayor is the next highest position and acts as the presiding officer of the municipal council.\n\nThe most common form of local transportation is the tricycle for nearer barangays. For far barangays, the motorcycle is the most common. All barangays are connected by roads and the only places without roads are the steep slopes of the central mountains.\n\nThe improvement of the Bohol circumferential road and the port facilities helped Ubay to become the trading and transportation hub of northeastern Bohol, connecting it to the neighboring island of Leyte and the rest of Bohol province. Passenger and cargo traffic to these destinations has noticeably increased over the years indicating an increasing volume of trade between these points.\n\nLand transportation is provided by various short and long-distance buses, jeeps and vans, connecting Ubay to the rest of the towns in the province. Tagbilaran can be reached from Ubay in two to three hours by bus or van. There are also daily combined road/ferry services to Metro Manila (Pasay City / Cubao, Quezon City).\n\nUbay seaport is considered the province's principal gateway to Leyte, and Samar. Its improved port area is linked to the major port destinations of neighboring provinces such as Bato and Hilongos in Leyte, Maasin City in Southern Leyte, and Cebu City, the regional capital. Four vessels travels to and from Cebu City daily, and routes to and from Bato, Hilongos and Maasin City are also served daily. The journey time for each destination is 4–5 hours.\nUbay is home to one of only two airports in Bohol (the other being Tagbilaran Airport), but Ubay Airport is completely undeveloped and has no scheduled service, nor any facilities. The runway currently is only about long but couldn't extend at the southwestern end becomes it is close to hills, and the northeastern end reaches housing and the sea.\n\nFor health services, the town has two public health units staffed by doctors, nurses, midwives, dentists, medical technologists and sanitary inspectors. A small government hospital was established to provide outpatient services to local residents. A private 15-bed hospital in Fatima also provides services for emergencies. A pediatrics and OB-gyne clinic complements the health services available in town.\n\nBarangay Health Workers (BHW) from each barangay provide direct health care assistance to barangay residents.\n\nThe local police force is 37 police officers. Police–population ratio is 1:, favourable than the standard ratio of 1:1,000. The police are augmented by 492 Barangay Tanod volunteers. It is reported that crime rate in Ubay is relatively low. The local Fire Department is staffed by eight fire fighters with two fire trucks. Incidence of fires is reportedly low in the municipality.\n\nBohol was linked to the major source of geothermal power in Leyte through the underwater connection between Maasin City, Southern Leyte and Ubay. Presently, only three of the 44 barangays have no electricity, yet only 34.97 percent of the total households in the municipality have electricity compared to the province, which was 58.3 percent energized in 2000.\n\nThe town proper and seven other barangays were served by the Ubay Water Service Cooperative. The cooperative planned to expand their service to eight other barangays in the near future. Due to consumer demand and the limited size of the supply, water service became difficult during dry months. Bohol province reported that 23.71 percent of its households had their own faucets from a community system while Ubay reported only 8.97 percent.\n\nFor the province, 21.68 percent of households had access to shared faucets while Ubay only had 8.86 percent. In Ubay, slightly more than half (51.83%) of the households had access to dug wells.\n\nThere are 45 public elementary schools in the municipality located in each barangay and one on Tres Reyes island.\nThere are 7 private pre-school and elementary schools.\nThere are 17 public and private secondary and high schools in the municipality which offer junior and senior high school curriculum.\nTo meet the increasing demands for college education, Bohol Northeastern College was founded in 1996 by Bohol political leaders, former governors Erico B. Aumentado and David B. Tirol. The name was later changed to Bohol Northern Star Colleges in January 2007.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2090314", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2090314", "title": "Digital cinematography", "text": "Digital cinematography\n\nDigital cinematography is the process of capturing (recording) a motion picture using digital image sensors rather than through film stock. As digital technology has improved in recent years, this practice has become dominant. Since the mid-2010s, most movies across the world are captured as well as distributed digitally.\n\nMany vendors have brought products to market, including traditional film camera vendors like Arri and Panavision, as well as new vendors like RED, Blackmagic, Silicon Imaging, Vision Research and companies which have traditionally focused on consumer and broadcast video equipment, like Sony, GoPro, and Panasonic.\n\n, professional 4K digital film cameras were approximately equal to 35mm film in their resolution and dynamic range capacity, however, digital film still has a different look to analog film. Some filmmakers still prefer to use analogue picture formats to achieve the desired results.\n\nThe basis for digital cameras are metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) image sensors. The first practical semiconductor image sensor was the charge-coupled device (CCD), based on MOS capacitor technology. Following the commercialization of CCD sensors during the late 1970s to early 1980s, the entertainment industry slowly began transitioning to digital imaging and digital video over the next two decades. The CCD was followed by the CMOS active-pixel sensor (CMOS sensor), developed in the 1990s.\n\nBeginning in the late 1980s, Sony began marketing the concept of \"electronic cinematography,\" utilizing its analog Sony HDVS professional video cameras. The effort met with very little success. However, this led to one of the earliest high definition video shot feature movies, \"Julia and Julia\" (1987).\n\n\"Rainbow\" (1996) was the world's first film utilizing extensive digital post production techniques. Shot entirely with Sony's first Solid State Electronic Cinematography cameras and featuring over 35 minutes of digital image processing and visual effects, all post production, sound effects, editing and scoring were completed digitally. The Digital High Definition image was transferred to 35mm negative via electron beam recorder for theatrical release.\n\nThe first digitally filmed and post produced feature film was \"Windhorse\", shot in Tibet and Nepal in 1996 on a prototype of the digital-beta Sony DVW-700WS and the prosumer Sony DCE-VX1000. The offline editing (Avid) and the online post and color work (Roland House / da Vinci) were also all digital. The film, transferred to 35mm negative for theatrical release, won Best U.S. Feature at the Santa Barbara Film Festival in 1998.\n\nIn 1998, with the introduction of HDCAM recorders and 1920 × 1080 pixel digital professional video cameras based on CCD technology, the idea, now re-branded as \"digital cinematography,\" began to gain traction in the market. Shot and released in 1998, \"The Last Broadcast\" is believed by some to be the first feature-length video shot and edited entirely on consumer-level digital equipment.\n\nIn May 1999 George Lucas challenged the supremacy of the movie-making medium of film for the first time by including footage filmed with high-definition digital cameras in \"\". The digital footage blended seamlessly with the footage shot on film and he announced later that year he would film its sequels entirely on hi-def digital video. Also in 1999, digital projectors were installed in four theaters for the showing of \"The Phantom Menace\". In June 2000, \"\" began principal photography shot entirely using a Sony HDW-F900 camera as Lucas had previously stated. The film was released in May 2002. In May 2001 \"Once Upon a Time in Mexico\" was also shot in 24 frame-per-second high-definition digital video, partially developed by George Lucas using a Sony HDW-F900 camera, following Robert Rodriguez's introduction to the camera at Lucas' Skywalker Ranch facility whilst editing the sound for \"Spy Kids\". Two lesser-known movies, \"Vidocq\" (2001) and \"Russian Ark\" (2002), had also been shot with the same camera, the latter notably consisting of a single long take.\n\nToday, cameras from companies like Sony, Panasonic, JVC and Canon offer a variety of choices for shooting high-definition video. At the high-end of the market, there has been an emergence of cameras aimed specifically at the digital cinema market. These cameras from Sony, Vision Research, Arri, Silicon Imaging, Panavision, Grass Valley and Red offer resolution and dynamic range that exceeds that of traditional video cameras, which are designed for the limited needs of broadcast television.\n\nIn 2009, \"Slumdog Millionaire\" became the first movie shot mainly in digital to be awarded the Academy Award for Best Cinematography. The second highest-grossing movie in the history of cinema, \"Avatar\", not only was shot on digital cameras as well, but also made the main revenues at the box office no longer by film, but digital projection.\n\nMajor films shot on digital video overtook those shot on film in 2013. Since 2016 over 90% of major films were shot on digital video. , 92% of films are shot on digital. Only 24 major films released in 2018 were shot on 35mm.\n\nDigital cinematography captures motion pictures digitally in a process analogous to digital photography. While there is no clear technical distinction that separates the images captured in digital cinematography from video, the term \"digital cinematography\" is usually applied only in cases where digital acquisition is substituted for film acquisition, such as when shooting a feature film. The term is seldom applied when digital acquisition is substituted for video acquisition, as with live broadcast television programs.\n\nProfessional cameras include the Sony CineAlta(F) Series, Blackmagic Cinema Camera, RED ONE, Arriflex D-20, D-21 and Alexa, Panavisions Genesis, Silicon Imaging SI-2K, Thomson Viper, Vision Research Phantom, IMAX 3D camera based on two Vision Research Phantom cores, Weisscam HS-1 and HS-2, GS Vitec noX, and the Fusion Camera System. Independent micro-budget filmmakers have also pressed low-cost consumer and prosumer cameras into service for digital filmmaking.\n\nFlagship smartphones like the Apple iPhone have been used to shoot movies like Unsane (shot on the iPhone 7 Plus) and Tangerine (shot on three iPhone 5S phones) and in January 2018, Unsane's director and Oscar winner Steven Soderbergh expressed an interest in filming other productions solely with iPhones going forward.\n\nDigital cinematography cameras capture digital images using image sensors, either charge-coupled device (CCD) sensors or CMOS active-pixel sensors, usually in one of two arrangements.\n\nSingle chip cameras designed specifically for the digital cinematography market often use a single sensor (much like digital photo cameras), with dimensions similar in size to a 16 or 35 mm film frame or even (as with the Vision 65) a 65 mm film frame. An image can be projected onto a single large sensor exactly the same way it can be projected onto a film frame, so cameras with this design can be made with PL, PV and similar mounts, in order to use the wide range of existing high-end cinematography lenses available. Their large sensors also let these cameras achieve the same shallow depth of field as 35 or 65 mm motion picture film cameras, which many cinematographers consider an essential visual tool.\n\nCodecs\n\nProfessional RAW video recording codecs include Blackmagic RAW, RED RAW, ARRI RAW and Canon RAW.\n\nUnlike other video formats, which are specified in terms of vertical resolution (for example, 1080p, which is 1920×1080 pixels), digital cinema formats are usually specified in terms of horizontal resolution. As a shorthand, these resolutions are often given in \"\"n\"K\" notation, where \"n\" is the multiplier of 1024 such that the horizontal resolution of a corresponding \"full-aperture\", digitized film frame is exactly formula_1 pixels. Here the \"K\" has a customary meaning corresponding to the binary prefix \"kibi\" (ki).\n\nFor instance, a 2K image is 2048 pixels wide, and a 4K image is 4096 pixels wide. Vertical resolutions vary with aspect ratios though; so a 2K image with an HDTV (16:9) aspect ratio is 2048×1152 pixels, while a 2K image with a SDTV or Academy ratio (4:3) is 2048×1536 pixels, and one with a Panavision ratio (2.39:1) would be 2048×856 pixels, and so on. Due to the \"\"n\"K\" notation not corresponding to specific horizontal resolutions per format a 2K image lacking, for example, the typical 35mm film soundtrack space, is only 1828 pixels wide, with vertical resolutions rescaling accordingly. This led to a plethora of motion-picture related video resolutions, which is quite confusing and often redundant with respect to the relatively few available projection standards.\n\nAll formats designed for digital cinematography are progressive scan, and capture usually occurs at the same 24 frame per second rate established as the standard for 35mm film. Some films such as \"\" have a High Frame Rate of 48 fps, although in some theatres it was also released in a 24 fps version which many fans of traditional film prefer.\n\nThe DCI standard for cinema usually relies on a 1.89:1 aspect ratio, thus defining the maximum container size for 4K as 4096×2160 pixels and for 2K as 2048×1080 pixels. When distributed in the form of a Digital Cinema Package (DCP), content is letterboxed or pillarboxed as appropriate to fit within one of these container formats.\nIn the early years of digital cinematography, 2K was the most common format for digitally acquired major motion pictures however, as new camera systems gain acceptance, 4K is becoming more prominent. The Arri Alexa captured a 2.8k image. During 2009 at least two major Hollywood films, \"Knowing\" and \"District 9\", were shot in 4K on the RED ONE camera, followed by \"The Social Network\" in 2010. , 4K cameras are now commonplace, with most high-end films being shot at 4K resolution.\n\nBroadly, two workflow paradigms are used for data acquisition and storage in digital cinematography.\n\nWith video-tape-based workflow, video is recorded to tape on set. This video is then ingested into a computer running non-linear editing software, using a deck. Upon ingestion, a digital video stream from tape is converted to computer files. These files can be edited directly or converted to an intermediate format for editing. Then video is output in its final format, possibly to a film recorder for theatrical exhibition, or back to video tape for broadcast use. Original video tapes are kept as an archival medium. The files generated by the non-linear editing application contain the information necessary to retrieve footage from the proper tapes, should the footage stored on the computer's hard disk be lost. With increasing convenience of file-based workflows, the tape-based workflows have become marginal in recent years.\n\nDigital cinematography has mostly shifted towards \"tapeless\" or \"file-based\" workflows. This trend has accelerated with increased capacity and reduced cost of non-linear storage solutions such as hard disk drives, optical discs, and solid-state memory. With tapeless workflows digital video is recorded as digital files onto random-access media like optical discs, hard disk drives or flash memory-based digital \"magazines\". These files can be easily copied to another storage device, typically to a large RAID (array of computer disks) connected to an editing system. Once data is copied from the on-set media to the storage array, they are erased and returned to the set for more shooting.\n\nSuch RAID arrays, both of \"managed\" (for example, SANs and NASs) and \"unmanaged\" (for example, JBoDs on a single computer workstation), are necessary due to the throughput required for real-time (320 MB/s for 2K @ 24fps) or near-real-time playback in post-production, compared to throughput available from a single, yet fast, hard disk drive. Such requirements are often termed as \"on-line\" storage. Post-production not requiring real-time playback performances (typically for lettering, subtitling, versioning and other similar visual effects) can be migrated to slightly slower RAID stores.\n\nShort-term archiving, \"if ever\", is accomplished by moving the digital files into \"slower\" RAID arrays (still of either managed and unmanaged type, but with lower performances), where playback capability is poor to non-existent (unless via proxy images), but minimal editing and metadata harvesting still feasible. Such intermediate requirements easily fall into the \"mid-line\" storage category.\n\nLong-term archiving is accomplished by backing up the digital files from the RAID, using standard practices and equipment for data backup from the IT industry, often to data tapes (like LTOs).\n\nMost digital cinematography systems further reduce data rate by subsampling color information. Because the human visual system is much more sensitive to luminance than to color, lower resolution color information can be overlaid with higher resolution luma (brightness) information, to create an image that looks very similar to one in which both color and luma information are sampled at full resolution. This scheme may cause pixelation or color bleeding under some circumstances. High quality digital cinematography systems are capable of recording full resolution color data (4:4:4) or raw sensor data.\n\nMost compression systems used for acquisition in the digital cinematography world compress footage one frame at a time, as if a video stream is a series of still images. This is called intra-frame compression. Inter-frame compression systems can further compress data by examining and eliminating redundancy between frames. This leads to higher compression ratios, but displaying a single frame will usually require the playback system to decompress a number of frames from before & after it. In normal playback this is not a problem, as each successive frame is played in order, so the preceding frames have already been decompressed. In editing, however, it is common to jump around to specific frames and to play footage backwards or at different speeds. Because of the need to decompress extra frames in these situations, inter-frame compression can cause performance problems for editing systems. Inter-frame compression is also disadvantageous because the loss of a single frame (say, due to a flaw writing data to a tape) will typically ruin all the frames until the next keyframe occurs. In the case of the HDV format, for instance, this may result in as many as 6 frames being lost with 720p recording, or 15 with 1080i. An inter-frame compressed video stream consists of groups of pictures (GOPs), each of which has only one full frame, and a handful of other frames referring to this frame. If the full frame, called I-frame, is lost due to transmission or media error, none of the P-frames or B-frames (the referenced images) can be displayed. In this case, the whole GOP is lost.\n\nDiscrete cosine transform (DCT) coding is the most common data compression process used in digital film recording and editing, including the JPEG image compression standard and various video coding standards such as DV, DigiBeta, HDCAM, Apple ProRes, Avid DNxHD, MPEG, Advanced Video Coding (AVC) and AVCHD. An alternative to DCT coding is JPEG 2000 discrete wavelet transform (DWT) coding, used in the Redcode and DCI XYZ video codecs as well as digital cinema distribution.\n\nFor theaters with digital projectors, digital films may be distributed digitally, either shipped to theaters on hard drives or sent via the Internet or satellite networks. Digital Cinema Initiatives, LLC, a joint venture of Disney, Fox, MGM, Paramount, Sony Pictures Entertainment, Universal and Warner Bros. Studios, has established standards for digital cinema projection. In July 2005, they released the first version of the Digital Cinema System Specification, which encompasses 2K and 4K theatrical projection. They also offer compliance testing for exhibitors and equipment suppliers.\n\nJPEG 2000, a discrete wavelet transform (DWT) based image compression standard developed by the Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG) between 1997 and 2000, was selected as the video coding standard for digital cinema in 2004.\n\nTheater owners initially balked at installing digital projection systems because of high cost and concern over increased technical complexity. However new funding models, in which distributors pay a \"digital print\" fee to theater owners, have helped to alleviate these concerns. Digital projection also offers increased flexibility with respect to showing trailers and pre-show advertisements and allowing theater owners to more easily move films between screens or change how many screens a film is playing on, and the higher quality of digital projection provides a better experience to help attract consumers who can now access high-definition content at home. These factors have resulted in digital projection becoming an increasingly attractive prospect for theater owners, and the pace of adoption has been rapidly increasing.\n\nSince some theaters currently don't have digital projection systems, even if a movie is shot and post-produced digitally, it must be transferred to film if a large theatrical release is planned. Typically, a film recorder will be used to print digital image data to film, to create a 35 mm internegative. After that the duplication process is identical to that of a traditional negative from a film camera.\n\nUnlike a digital sensor, a film frame does not have a regular grid of discrete pixels.\n\nDetermining resolution in digital acquisition seems straightforward, but it is significantly complicated by the way digital camera sensors work in the real world. This is particularly true in the case of high-end digital cinematography cameras that use a single large bayer pattern CMOS sensor. A bayer pattern sensor does not sample full RGB data at every point; instead, each pixel is biased toward red, green \"or\" blue, and a full color image is assembled from this checkerboard of color by processing the image through a demosaicing algorithm. Generally with a bayer pattern sensor, actual resolution will fall somewhere between the \"native\" value and half this figure, with different demosaicing algorithms producing different results. Additionally, most digital cameras (both bayer and three-chip designs) employ optical low-pass filters to avoid aliasing; suboptimal antialiasing filtering can further reduce system resolution.\n\nFilm has a characteristic grain structure. Different film stocks have different grain.\n\nDigitally acquired footage lacks this grain structure. It has electronic noise.\n\nThe process of using digital intermediate workflow, where movies are color graded digitally instead of via traditional photochemical finishing techniques, has become common.\n\nIn order to utilize digital intermediate workflow with film, the camera negative must first be processed and then scanned to a digital format. Some filmmakers have years of experience achieving their artistic vision using the techniques available in a traditional photochemical workflow, and prefer that finishing/editing process.\n\nDigitally shot movies can be printed, transferred or archived on film. Large scale digital productions are often archived on film, as it provides a safer medium for storage, benefiting insurance and storage costs. As long as the negative does not completely degrade, it will always be possible to recover the images from it in the future, regardless of changes in technology, since all that will be involved is simple photographic reproduction.\n\nIn contrast, even if digital data is stored on a medium that will preserve its integrity, highly specialized digital equipment will always be required to reproduce it. Changes in technology may thus render the format unreadable or expensive to recover over time. For this reason, film studios distributing digitally-originated films often make film-based separation masters of them for archival purposes.\n\nFilm proponents have argued that early digital cameras lack the reliability of film, particularly when filming sequences at high speed or in chaotic environments, due to digital cameras' technical glitches. Cinematographer Wally Pfister noted that for his shoot on the film \"Inception\", \"Out of six times that we shot on the digital format, we only had one useable piece and it didn't end up in the film. Out of the six times we shot with the Photo-Sonics camera and 35mm running through it, every single shot was in the movie.\" Michael Bay stated that when filming \"\", 35mm cameras had to be used when filming in slow-motion and sequences where the digital cameras were subject to strobing or electrical damage from dust. Since 2015 digital has almost totally replaced film for high speed sequences up to 1000 frames per second.\n\nSome film directors such as Christopher Nolan, Paul Thomas Anderson and Quentin Tarantino have publicly criticized digital cinema, and advocated the use of film and film prints. Tarantino has suggested he may retire because he will no longer be able to have his films projected in 35mm in most American cinemas. Tarantino considers digital cinema to be simply \"television in public.\" Christopher Nolan has speculated that the film industry's adoption of digital formats has been driven purely by economic factors as opposed to digital being a superior medium to film: \"I think, truthfully, it boils down to the economic interest of manufacturers and [a production] industry that makes more money through change rather than through maintaining the status quo.\"\n\nAnother concern with digital image capture is how to archive all the digital material. Archiving digital material is turning out to be extremely costly, and it creates issues in terms of long-term preservation. In a 2007 study, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences found that the cost of storing 4K digital masters is \"enormously higher – 1100% higher – than the cost of storing film masters.\" Furthermore, digital archiving faces challenges due to the insufficient longevity of today's digital storage: no current media, be it magnetic hard drives or digital tape, can reliably store a film for a hundred years, something that properly stored and handled film can do. Although this also used to be the case with optical disc, in 2012 Millenniata, Inc. a digital storage company based in Utah, released M-DISC, an optical storage solution, designed to last up to 1,000 years, thus, offering a possibility of digital storage as a viable storage solution.\n\n"}

{"id": "2090320", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2090320", "title": "FIFA International Soccer", "text": "FIFA International Soccer\n\nFIFA International Soccer is a 1993 sports video game developed by EA Canada's Extended Play Productions team and published by Electronic Arts. Based on the sport of association football, the game tasks the player with controlling a football team. The game was released for the Sega Genesis/Mega Drive console in December 1993 and ported to numerous other systems in 1994.\n\nThe game was positively received on release; critics lauded the detail and animation of the footballers in the game, the crowd sound effects, and the overall presentation. The speed the game ran at and issues with the response to the player's input were seen as the game's primary faults. The 3DO version was an enhanced edition with multiple camera views and more detailed graphics than other versions, and was a high-profile showcase for the 3DO's power. The game sold well, served as a pack-in game for the Goldstar 3DO, and led to a sequel, \"FIFA Soccer 95\". It was the first game in the \"FIFA\" series.\n\n\"FIFA International Soccer\" is a video game that created one of the earliest full simulations of association football. In particular, the game is based on international matches. The game utilises an isometric viewpoint, unlike other football games at the time such as Sensible Soccer which utilised a birds-eye view or Kick Off which used a top-down view. The player controls one of the eleven footballers on their team at a time, with the ability to switch players on command. The game allows up to four human players at the same time, each controlling a different footballer. The players can choose to control a footballer on the same team or on opposing teams. The remaining footballers are controlled by the computer.\n\nFour modes of play — Exhibition, Tournament, Playoffs, and League — are available. Exhibition engages the player in a single match. Tournament mode resembles the format of the FIFA World Cup, with the player controlling a team of their choice through a series of matches, starting with three group games with the possibility of progressing to four further games in a knockout format. Playoffs mode takes the same form, but skips the group games and starts at the first knockout game. League consists of eight teams who contest a double round-robin tournament.\n\nThe game features 48 national teams in total Commentary from Tony Gubba (PC CD-ROM version), plus a team called EA All Stars. Every team has 20 players. The players are fictional (some of them, e.g. Tim Ansell of England or Joe Della-Savia of Italy, are named after people credited as the development team) and look the same, except for darker skin of certain teams' players.\n\nAn oversight by the developers makes it easy to score a goal by making a player stand in front of the opponent's goalkeeper when he holds the ball in his hands and is about to clear it away. The computer-controlled goalkeeper will kick the ball into the opposing player, giving the latter an easy chance to score.\n\nThere are 48 national teams in the game:\n\nElectronic Arts (EA) had first ventured in the sports games market in 1988 with an American football title, John Madden Football. Updated versions of the game, along with golf and ice hockey games followed under the EASN (Electronic Arts Sports Network) banner. EA's European arm carried out research into the possibility of a sports game that would appeal to a European audience and decided that a football game would stand the best chance of success, predicting high sales figures. EA US gave the go-ahead for the project to proceed, and a team of ten developers at EA's Canadian studios began work on the project led by Bruce McMillan. Initially, the development took place for the Sega Genesis under the working title of EA Soccer, with a small budget of around $50,000-$100,000.\n\nOther EA Sports titles held official licences from the leagues depicted to allow real team names, players and stadiums to be included, and with a view to securing the same for their football title, EA signed a five-year deal with football's governing body, FIFA. The deal involved \"minuscule\" royalty payments, and on further inspection the reason became clear. The licence didn't include any team names, logos, player names, likenesses or stadiums. The game would therefore only include national teams identified by country names and flags, and player names would be made up - several of the developers added their own names into the game. The licence for the forthcoming 1994 FIFA World Cup tournament was held by US Gold and their game was due for a Spring 1994 release in time for the tournament which was to take place in Summer 1994. EA decided they would need to bring forward their game ahead of the US Gold title, and aimed for a Christmas 1993 release.\n\nQuestioning the recognition that the FIFA licence held in North America, EA suggested the game be released as Team USA Soccer in North America. Fearing a sales flop, they reversed the decision and decided to release the game worldwide under the FIFA International Soccer title, providing the option of moving unsold stock to other markets. Development of the game was completed in November 1993.\n\nIn June 1995, Atari Corporation struck a deal with EA to bring select titles from their catalog to the Atari Jaguar CD, with \"FIFA International Soccer\" being among them, however, this version was never released due to the commercial and critical failure of the Atari Jaguar platform.\n\nEA anticipated sales of around 300,000 copies of the game in Europe. In the first four weeks alone, over 500,000 sales were made, and despite its December release, became the best selling game of 1993.\n\n\"FIFA International Soccer\" received mostly positive comments from the press. Reviewing the original Genesis/Mega Drive version, Edge magazine praised the way the crowd sounds reacted to the play on the field as well as the visual detail of the players and their animations with the isometric view. They highlighted that this did make for a slower game than one using a top-down view and described it a more of a simulator than a console game. Mean Machines Sega described the game as the \"greatest soccer game yet seen\", praising the \"superlative presentation\" and the \"utterly amazing\" animation. With only minor concerns around the response time to the players input and the lack of an on-screen clock graphic, they awarded a score of 96%. \"Computer Gaming World\" in June 1994 said \"\"this\" is stunning. \"FIFA\" ... is a remarkably complete simulation of the sport\". The magazine stated that \"In no other game can you achieve such a high degree of pinpoint accuracy when passing\", and praised players executing offensive or defensive stance depending on location.\n\n\"Next Generation\" reviewed the Super NES version of the game, rating it four stars out of five, and stated that \"\"FIFA International Soccer\" for the Super NES is a great game. With its extremely fast action, sharp graphics, and sensible gameplay, this title is a winner.\" \"GamePro\" gave the SNES version a positive review, commenting that \"Strong and varied game play makes this the most realistic soccer game for the SNES.\" They also praised the graphics, animation, digitized crowd chants, and accessibility to players of all skill levels. They later commented that the Sega CD version is essentially identical to the Genesis and SNES versions aside from the addition of some full motion video clips, but that this is not a bad thing because the previous versions didn't leave any room for improvement.\n\n\"Next Generation\" reviewed the 3DO version, and noted that this port differed considerably from the original Genesis version and most other ports, with the addition of multiple views, a rotating-camera effect and more detailed graphics. They described it as the \"killer-app graphics showhorse\" for the 3DO console, awarding it a maximum five star score. \"GamePro\" similarly remarked \"FIFA 3DO is no mere port-over from the cartridge market.\" They especially praised the highly detailed graphics, multiple views, realistic gameplay, and six-player support.\n\nReviewing the Amiga port, most publications spoke favourably of the game's appearance. Amiga Power, CU Amiga and The One magazines all highlighted the amount of disk swapping required to play the game as a drawback. Reaction to the changes in the controls required to adapt from the three buttons available on the Mega Drive controller to the single button common on most Amiga joysticks were mixed. Amiga Format said of hitting the button in an attempt to shoot at the goal, \"occasionally the ball flies into the onion bag; other times it seems you are just passing the ball to the keeper.\" Amiga Power described the outcome of pressing the button as random. The One however describes the control system as \"excellent - to the point that it's easier to control\" in comparison to the Mega Drive.\n\nIn 1996, \"Next Generation\" listed the Genesis and 3DO versions as number 71 on their \"Top 100 Games of All Time\", saying it \"put 3DO on the map after a year of disappointing titles for the system, and ... breathed life into EA's flagging sports line-up.\" They cited the zooming camera angles and the ability to have up to six players on the 3DO version as highlights.\n\nA sequel, FIFA 95, was released in July 1994 exclusively for the Genesis. This started the FIFA series, with a new game released every year since in the main series, alongside spin-off series games based around a particular tournament. The series passed 100 million total sales in 2010, and EA's licence to use the FIFA title runs through to 2022.\n"}

His father became a much revered Commissioner in the Army's ranks, and travelled extensively in the interests of the organisation. His mother died when he was 8 years of age.\n\nHe became an officer in 1882 at the age of 17. Most of his earlier career was spent as an officer in the United States. During his time as an officer in the U.S., there was great divisions amongst the American Salvationists. He was known as the peace maker, thus earning him a lot of respect. In 1888, he married Captain Catherine Price.\n\nWhen Higgins was 42 years of age, Commissioner and Chief of the Staff Bramwell Booth gave him the oversight of the evangelistic work in the United Kingdom. By this time, Higgins was a great speaker, and had a lot of leadership skills which was needed in this role.\n\nThe Siege of London was a 10-day effort that took place in November 1912. It was an attempt to bring a prayer service to the people out in the core of London. It was such a huge success that it was repeated in 1913.\n\nIn 1919, General Bramwell Booth appointed him as his Chief of the Staff. Higgins was never one to lead a political agenda, but he took his new role in stride. However, 1929 was a real test for Higgins and a critical time in the history of The Salvation Army, the calling of the first High Council to elect a new General. General Bramwell Booth was asked to resign because of his ill health over the past several months. He refused, however, and was then reluctantly deposed from office, to be succeeded in the election of Higgins. As General Booth sued, the matter was put in the hands of the court. The court ruled in favour of the High Council. Thus, Higgins was the first General to be elected by the High Council.\n\nAs leader of the International Salvation Army, General Higgins still had his personal touch and warmth towards others. During his term in office as the General, he allowed a centenary of William Booth's birth to be celebrated. He also presided over a gathering in the Royal Albert Hall, and among those taking part was then Prime Minister, The Rt Hon. Stanley Baldwin.\n\nWhen he retired, his farewell meeting was held at the Royal Albert Hall on 1 November 1934, presided over by the then Duke of York (later George VI), who was accompanied by the Duchess (later Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother.)\n\nThe General and his wife then went to live in Florida, and later moved to Canada. The General and his wife had 7 children. He continued to prove himself a true \"son of the Army\" by maintaining as much interest in the relatively small corps around them as he had done in the greater issues when in office. Mrs General Catherine Higgins died in 1952.\n\nHiggins wrote a number of books, including \"Stewards of God\" and \"Personal Holiness\".\n\nGeneral Edward Higgins died at age 83.\n"}

Released in 1987, it is the fourth game in the \"\" series. It was written by Peter Harrap and Shaun Hollingworth with music by Rob Hubbard and Ben Daglish.\n\nThe player controls Monty as he travels around Europe collecting money in order to buy a Greek island - Montos, where he can safely retire. Gameplay is in the style of a flick-screen platform game, similar to many such games of the 1980s such as \"Technician Ted\" and \"Jet Set Willy\". Some screens (such as those representing the Eiffel Tower and the Pyrenees) bear some relation to their real-life counterparts but most are just typical platform game screens.\n\"Auf Wiedersehen Monty\" contains many interesting features and peculiarities for the player to discover. Examples include being suddenly attacked by a bull's head in Spain after collecting a red cape (presumably a reference to bullfighting), a car being dropped in one of two places on entering a screen representing Düsseldorf in West Germany, a chef's hat found in Sweden (a reference to the Swedish Chef of Muppets fame; also, the two rooms representing Sweden are subtitled Bjorn and Borg), and a record in Luxembourg that when collected makes Monty breakdance to the game's title music (this may be a reference to Radio Luxembourg).\nIt is possible to get to areas of the game more quickly by flying from an airport using air tickets which can be collected throughout the game. Some parts of the game can only be reached in this manner.\n\nAs well as money, there are other miscellaneous objects to collect in the game for points. This was important as you need a certain number of points to get to Montos. These are often particular to the country Monty is visiting (such as berets in France). Bottles of wine or a glass of beer in West Germany cause Monty to briefly become drunk and his control to become slightly erratic leading to a reversal of controls, repeated jumping or Monty climbing any ladders or drainpipes he encounters.\n\n\n\"Moley Christmas\" was released later in the same year. A further Monty Mole game, called \"Impossamole\" was released in 1990. It took a different form to the previous games being more of a \"console-style\" arcade game.\n\n"}
{"id": "2090335", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2090335", "title": "FIFA 97", "text": "FIFA 97\n\nFIFA 97 (also known as FIFA Soccer 97) is a video game developed by EA Canada and published by Electronic Arts based on the game of football (soccer). It was released for the PC on June 24, 1996 and versions for PlayStation, SNES, Mega Drive and Sega Saturn followed.\n\n\"FIFA 97\" is the fourth game in the \"FIFA\" series and the second to use the Virtual Stadium engine. Unlike the first game to use the engine, \"FIFA 97\" features polygonal players as opposed to the 2D sprites used in \"FIFA Soccer '96\". The engine however received complaints for being sluggish in the PC and PlayStation versions.\n\nDavid Ginola (then a Newcastle United player) was pictured on the cover of the game in the European market. He also was used for motion capture for the polygonal models in the game. Bebeto (the Brazilian striker) was featured on the cover for the Americas and Asia-Pacific markets.\n\nThe main new feature of the game other than the motion capture was the indoor football mode. There are six ways to play the game, including outdoor and indoor, as well as action and simulation modes. 32-bit AI is used, as well as motion blending technology. It is possible to play six-a-side football in an indoor arena with the ball bouncing off the walls meaning there are no throw-ins and therefore a much higher paced game. Leagues available in the game include the English, French, Italian, German, Dutch, Scottish leagues and the Malaysian M-league and other sides, as well as the American A-League clubs with fictional teams, composed of the game's creators such as Bruce McMillan and Penny Lee. Commentary is provided by John Motson and Andy Gray while the presenter is Des Lynam. Multiplayer games are also possible with up to 20-players via LAN and 8-players using modem. The game trailer's tagline was \"FIFA 97, it will blow you away.\"\n\nMost European domestic leagues are featured in the game, including the English Premier League, but only teams from each nation's highest division are playable. The English clubs featured in the game are those who played in the 1995-96 Premier League.\n\nIt is also possible to field custom teams made up of players from various real teams. However, these teams can only be played with in friendly matches.\nThe game's commentary included the names of the majority of players on the game, and the names of the teams were also said by John Motson. To keep the commentary from sounding too robotic, EA Sports recorded Motson saying each phrase four different times, each time in a different tone. Several errors plagued the game's commentary, such as John Millar of Heart of Midlothian being referred to as Joe Miller, who in fact plays for Aberdeen on the game. Also, at times when a goal kick was awarded, the commentator would say that the kick had been given to the opposing team. Another similar error was that a kick-off would be referred to as a cross, as well as a goal in the first minute being described as a goal \"that would win it surely\". On rare occasions, when the game was being introduced by Des Lynam, the name of a player involved in the game would be said by John Motson, instead of Lynam saying the names of both teams. For example, a match between Partick Thistle F.C. and Kilmarnock F.C. would sometimes be introduced by Lynam saying \"Welcome to the big match between-\", and Motson's voice interjecting with \"MacPherson.\"\n\nThe pronunciation of certain players' names would change depending upon whether they were performing attacking or defensive duties, such as Roy Aitken being referred to as \"Akin\" if he made a tackle or clearance. Similarly, Alessandro Del Piero, who was called \"Del Piero Togon\" on the game, was referred to as \"Del Piero Tognon\", followed by a small hiccuping noise when he performed a tackle.\n\n\"FIFA 97\"s computer version received a \"Gold\" sales award from the Verband der Unterhaltungssoftware Deutschland (VUD), indicating sales of at least 100,000 units across Germany, Austria and Switzerland.\n\nThe PlayStation version received a wide range of reviews. \"GamePro\" gave it a rave review, particularly applauding the motion captured animations, crowd noises, and \"detailed, side-busting commentary\". GameSpot's Stephen Poole disagreed on the commentary, noting that it is on occasion blatantly inaccurate. However, he opined that the slower pace of the gameplay is more realistic. Additionally praising the new indoor soccer feature, motion capture animation, and sharply rendered players, he concluded the game \"does not disappoint.\" A reviewer for \"Next Generation\", however, insisted that \"The simple, sad fact is \"FIFA '97\" is the most disappointing EA Sports game in years.\" He argued that the slow pace, rather than being realistic, is simply boring. He acknowledged that the visuals are good and the features are comprehensive, but found the slow pace, frame rate, control, and unrealistic ball physics make \"FIFA '97\" a poor offering. The two sports reviewers of \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" took a middle ground, complimenting the graphics, stats, and realism, but agreeing with \"Next Generation\" that the play suffers from the slow pace and controls. They rated it overall decent, but not a contender against the leading soccer games.\n\nBoth Play Magazine in Issue 15 and Official UK PlayStation Magazine in Issue 15 rated the PlayStation version of the game similarly with a score of 70% and 7/10 respectively. Play when comparing it with FIFA 96 commented that it was \"Graphically better, but plays worse\".\n\nReviews for the Saturn port were more uniformly middling. Critics often compared it unfavorably to \"Sega Worldwide Soccer 97\". \"GamePro\" also noted that the graphics and audio are inferior to those of the PlayStation version. \"Saturn Power\" mentioned numerous aggravations with the controls and configurations, and summarized it as \"Almost perversely entertaining for a game as flawed as it is.\" \"Sega Saturn Magazine\"s Rich Leadbetter found the AI too heavily flawed to provide an accurate simulation of soccer. Like Price, he deemed the game enjoyable despite its flaws, but concluded \"Sega Worldwide Soccer '97\" to be indisputably a wiser purchase.\n\nThe Genesis and Super NES versions were reviewed in \"GamePro\" by two different critics. Both concluded that the game is a must-have for newcomers to the series, but that \"FIFA\" fans would likely find the game redundant due to the minimal change from previous installments.\n\n\"GamePro\" also ran a brief review of the Game Boy version, praising it for managing easy-to-follow graphics despite the small screen. They added, \"The gameplay isn't exactly speedy - the sprites lope downfield at a sluggish pace - but it's fun working your way through a lengthy tournament to the championship.\n"}
{"id": "2090336", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2090336", "title": "The Levee, Chicago", "text": "The Levee, Chicago\n\nThe Levee District was the red-light district of Chicago from the 1880s until 1912, when police raids shut it down. The district, like many frontier town red-light districts, got its name from its proximity to wharves in the city. The Levee district encompassed four blocks in Chicago's South Loop area, between 18th and 22nd streets. It was home to many brothels, saloons, dance halls, and the famed Everleigh Club. Prostitution boomed in the Levee District, and it was not until the Chicago Vice Commission submitted a report on the city's vice districts that it was shut down.\n\nThe Chicago nightlife district was initially located downtown in the First District. However, after the Great Fire of Chicago in 1871, it moved to the south of the city. Before 1890, the area known as Customs House Levee became a gathering place for players and pimps, and was one of the most notorious criminal districts in Chicago. According to one newspaper, Chicago was at that time considered \"the most violent, dirtiest cities - loud, lawless, ugly, offensive, godless; an oversized, stupid village.\" In cooperation with the Chicago Outfit, corrupt city councilors \"Hinky Dink\" Michael Kenna and \"Bathhouse\" John Coughlin, precipitated the rapid rise of vice in the district. From 1893 the pair organized a protection racket in which game parlors and brothels in The Levee had to pay protection money. Kenna and Coughlin formed a group of corrupt city councilors called \"Gray Wolves,\" which was active from 1890 to 1930.\n\nThe Levee District was home to many brothels, saloons, dance halls, and similar places. Chicago's first brothels were built on Wells Street. Among the most famous establishments were: \n\n\nThe lowest level of the brothels formed the simple houses in the Bed Bug Row, spanning from Dearborn Avenue and Federal to 19th Street and Archer). The women of color who worked there offered $0.25 services, often under poor hygienic conditions. The Bed Bug Row had a similar bad reputation to the \"Cribs\" in New Orleans or the \"cowyards\" in San Francisco.\n\nIn order to receive protection, Levee inhabitants would attend the biggest event in the district, the annual First Ward Ball. There, Levee residents gathered to celebrate the triumphs brought to them by \"Hinky Dink\" Kenna and \"Bathhouse\" Coughlin. Madams, corrupt businessmen, dance-hall owners, saloon owners, prostitutes, brothel owners, and gamblers attended the event to support these aldermen. The money raised came from the purchase of tickets to the event and of alcohol.\n\nWhen anti-vice reformers protested the ball, Kenna justified it as benefiting the people in the district through educational and community programs. The First Ward Ball of 1908 was the most significant because it was the last one to be attended by the Levee's most prominent figures. That year, anti-vice reformers tried to stop the ball by bombing its venue, The Coliseum. The ball was uninterrupted, however, in 1909, anti-vice reformers worked towards getting the city to revoke the event's alcohol license. They succeeded, and only about 3,000 people attended, less than a quarter of the attendance at the previous balls. That year, reformers like the Woman's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU) worked towards stopping events like these, claiming that they harmed the families in the Levee.\n\nAnti-Vice Reformers\nDevout Christian communities protested at the beginning of the 20th century against prostitution and gambling in the Levee. At its peak, up to 5,000 prostitutes worked in the local brothels. Increasingly, the public became aware of \"white slavery\" cases in which girls from rural areas fell into the hands of pimps and were systematically forced into prostitution. An especially sensational case was that of Madame Mary Hastings, who inflicted torture and forced prostitution on minor girls in her brothel Custom House Place on Jackson Street.\n\nThe Levee District's success in vice came to an end when reformers such as the WCTU and Chicago Vice Commission (CVC) (established by Carter Harrison, Jr.) publicly exposed the issues of white slavery and alcohol abuse. The WCTU had a \"department of rescue\" to save women forced into slavery. They also had a \"department of social purity,\" which upheld sexual consent laws. The WCTU paid investigators to conduct studies on forced prostitution in Midwest lumber camps. This in turn helped them publish a journal on the stories of women working as prostitutes in Chicago (Levee District), San Francisco, and New York.\n\nThe CVC focused on terminating vice districts, and on investigating the conditions for women in the Levee. The members spoke to prostitutes, police, and neighborhood organizations. They published a report, \"The Social Evil in Chicago\", which included prostitution statistics and recommendations for improvement. The report concluded that about 5,000 professional prostitutes worked in Chicago, and about five million men were receiving services from them, for which the women received about $25 weekly. They were mostly uneducated and unskilled, and they had little to no opportunities for economic advancement. The report was read around the world and influenced vice commissions in 43 cities to close their own vice districts.\n\nThe difficult process to close down the entire Levee District began on January 9, 1910, when Nathaniel Ford Moore died in Victoria \"Vic\" Shaw's brothel. She wanted to frame Minna Everleigh for the death, but Everleigh found out about Moore before Shaw got the chance. Shaw was forced to call the police to report the death after which her brothel was closed. A year later, on October 3, 1911, the state's attorney issued warrants for 135 people associated with the Levee, including Big Jim Colosimo, Ed Weiss, Roy Jones and Vic Shaw. The warrants shut down halls, saloons and brothels. Many people were arrested within the brothels; in Marie Blanchey's brothel, 20 women and 30 men were arrested. Word spread about corruption in the government, and on October 24, 1911, Mayor Carter Harrison ordered the closure of the Everleigh Club. It was shut down the following day. Many businesses in the Levee District closed in 1911, but the district held on for two more years. One of the last brothels to close was Freiberg's Dance Hall, which celebrated its last night on August 24, 1914.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough the Levee District had closed down in 1912, prostitution continued to be a problem in Chicago. The closing of the Levee had initiated changes throughout the city's sexual commerce. There were no brothels, but that didn't stop many men and women. They moved from brothels and saloons to cabarets, nightclubs and other nighttime scenes. Solicitation was still available, and the sex entrepreneurs were still willing to pay law enforcement to keep quiet. \n\nThe election of Chicago Mayor William \"Big Bill\" Hale Thompson in 1915 reactivated the illegal business in the Levee. Many of the brothels were reopened as hotels, saloons or cabarets. \"Big Jim\" Colosimo and his wife Victoria Moresco took over three brothels and control of the district. His \"Colosimo's Café\", frequented by famous guests such as Enrico Caruso, became the center of high society in Chicago. Due to his Italian origins, Colosimo became the target of Sicilian blackmail bands like the Black Hand Gang (La Mano Nera), which increasingly threatened him. For fear of kidnapping, he sought shelter with his co-relatives Johnny Torrio in New York. Torrio, a cousin of Victoria Moresco, sent Al Capone to reorganize the situation there. Capone began his career in the restaurant in this district \"The Four Deuces\" (2222 South Wabash). The four-storey brick building, which also housed an office and a brothel upstairs, was initially owned by Jonny Torrio. It is believed that he tortured his rivals in the basement of the \"Four Deuces\".\n\nIn the beginning of the 1920s, vice syndicates of the time moved to the suburbs where law enforcement was easier to persuade. Although laws were established to control or eliminate prostitution, they were not backed up by the court system. \"In many cases, the defendant did not appear in trial in which case the charges were dropped and the bond seized.\"\nIt was shown that even when they were sentenced, none of the prostitutes were sentenced correctly. Only 15 of the 320 cases were found guilty in a group of cases they had selected.\nIn the final decades of the 20th century, establishments similar to brothels reentered the city. New businesses like peepshows, massage parlors, and bars featuring live showgirls opened. In the 1980s, however, most were shut down and turned into condominiums, restaurants, and high-end retail stores.\n\n"}

It was the fifth game in the \"FIFA\" series and the second to be in 3D on the 32-bit machines. A number of different players were featured on the cover, including David Beckham in the UK, Roy Lassiter in the United States, Mexico, and Brazil, David Ginola in France, Raúl in Spain, Paolo Maldini in Italy and Andreas Möller in Germany. \"FIFA 98\" was the last \"FIFA\" game released for the Sega Genesis, Sega Saturn, and the Super Nintendo Entertainment System\n\nThe game includes an official soundtrack and had a refined graphics engine, team and player customisation options, 16 stadiums, improved artificial intelligence and the popular Road to World Cup mode, with all 172 FIFA-registered national teams. No subsequent edition of the FIFA series had attempted to replicate \"FIFA 98\"s inclusion of every FIFA national team, up until \"2010 FIFA World Cup South Africa\" which included all 199 FIFA nations that took part in qualifying. With the new graphical improvements, players were able to have individual faces.\n\n\"FIFA 98\" even features many accurate team rosters, including national reserves for national call-up when playing in the round-robin qualification modes. In addition, eleven leagues were featured, containing 189 clubs. The game also featured a popular five-a-side indoor mode and was the first FIFA game to contain an in-game player/team editor. \n\nFor the first time in a FIFA game, the offside rule is properly implemented. In previous games, when a player was in an offside position doing anything except running, that player was penalised for offside even when the ball was passed backwards. The 32-bit and 64-bit versions of \"FIFA 98\" correct this so that the game would only award a free kick for offside if the ball was passed roughly to where the player in the offside position was.\n\nThe theme music for the game was Blur's \"Song 2\". Four songs from The Crystal Method were also included in the game – \"More\", \"Now Is the Time\", \"Keep Hope Alive\" and \"Busy Child\" – as well as a song by Electric Skychurch entitled \"Hugga Bear\". Des Lynam was retained for the game introduction and John Motson and Andy Gray remained as match commentators.\n\nThere were 16 stadiums in the game, representing 16 countries from all six FIFA confederations.\n\nDavid Ginola served as the game's motion capture actor.\n\nUpon its release, the game was a bestseller in the UK for 2 months. At the 1999 Milia festival in Cannes, it took home a \"Gold\" prize for revenues above €37 million in the European Union during the previous year. \"Play\" magazine in issue 29 awarded the PlayStation version of the game 88%.\n\nDuring the game's 20th anniversary in 2017, Luke Plunkett of \"Kotaku\" wrote an essay arguing that \"FIFA 98\" should be considered as the best sports video game of all time, focusing on its then-unprecedented depth and breadth of content, which Plunkett contended is the main differentiating factor between titles within the highly incremental sports video gaming industry. Examples cited were its inclusion of all FIFA national teams of the time, customization options for rosters and kits, multiple game modes, and groundbreaking soundtrack including licensed rather than original music.\n\n\"Next Generation\" reviewed the Nintendo 64 version of the game, rating it four stars out of five, and stated that \"The game still doesn't have the fluidity of \"ISS 64\", but the real players and variety of options make \"FIFA RTTWC 64\" a game that soccer fans all over the world should enjoy.\"\n"}

It was the seventh game in the main \"FIFA\" series. The game was released for Microsoft Windows and PlayStation. A version was also released for the Game Boy Color, developed by Tiertex Design Studios and published by THQ.\n\nAmong the innovations for this edition of the series was the ability to play over consecutive seasons, giving the possibility of competing for promotion or relegation and qualification for European Cup competition. The US Major League Soccer was officially licensed for the first time, and was used as a subtitle for the North American release.\n\nCommentary in the UK English release is provided by BBC television commentators John Motson, Mark Lawrenson and Chris Waddle. The commentary was recorded in a London studio, however for the first time in the series Motson visited the games developers in Vancouver, Canada to provide insights into the intricacies of the real-life game. The US English release features commentary from Phil Schoen and Julie Foudy. Localised commentary exists for the German, Spanish, French, Italian, Hebrew, Japanese, Greek and Brazilian Portuguese releases.\n\nThe game's theme music was Robbie Williams' \"It's Only Us\". As part of the agreement to licence the track EA Sports included Port Vale, the club Robbie Williams supports, in the game, despite only being in the third tier of the English football league system, which wasn't included as part of this game.\n\nThe game was met with positive reception, with the exception of the Game Boy Color version, which currently has a score of 47% on GameRankings; the site also gave the PlayStation version 87%, and the PC version 85%.\n\n\"PlayStation Max\" awarded a gold rating to the game, praising the game's looks, sound and longevity, although they did criticise the ease with which it was possible to score goals. \"Official UK PlayStation Magazine\" went further with their criticism of the gameplay, believing the passing to be \"too precise\" and it being unrealistically easy to beat defenders. They did praise the level of detail in the game's graphics and the commentary and awarded the game a score of 7/10.\n\n\"FIFA 2000\"s PlayStation version received a \"Platinum\" sales award from the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA), indicating sales of at least 300,000 copies in the United Kingdom.\n\n"}

Written primarily by John Lennon and credited to Lennon–McCartney, it is the second song of the album's climactic medley. Like other tracks on the album (notably \"Because\") the song features lush multi-tracked vocal harmonies, provided by Lennon, Paul McCartney and George Harrison.\n\nThe working title was \"Here Comes the Sun King\", but was shortened to \"Sun King\" to avoid confusion with Harrison's \"Here Comes the Sun\". The song slowly fades in from the harbour sounds at the end of \"You Never Give Me Your Money\". At the end of the song, the music stops abruptly and a drum fill by Ringo Starr leads into the next track, \"Mean Mr. Mustard\".\n\nA faux mixing of Romance languages occurs in the last three lines of the song. In 1969, Lennon was interviewed about these lyrics and said, \"We just started joking, you know, singing 'cuando para mucho.' So we just made up... Paul knew a few Spanish words from school, you know. So we just strung any Spanish words that sounded vaguely like something. And of course we got 'chicka ferdy' in. That's a Liverpool expression. Just like sort – it doesn't mean anything to me but (childish taunting) 'na-na, na-na-na!'\"\nIn an interview in 1987, Harrison said that the recording was inspired by Fleetwood Mac's \"Albatross\". \"At the time, 'Albatross' (by Fleetwood Mac) was out, with all the reverb on guitar.

It never really sounded like Fleetwood Mac... but that was the point of origin.\"\n\nThe song is in the key of C and the chorus (\"Here comes the Sun King\") involves a I (C)–Imaj (Cmaj chord)–v (Gm chord)–VI (A chord) progression against a C–B–B–A vocal harmony. An interesting feature (according to Pedler) is the substitution of the Gm chord for the C dominant chord at the word \"Sun\". This represents an example of the jazz rule that allows a dominant (V) seventh chord (here C) to be replaced by a minor chord a fifth above (here Gm). The synchronous B vocal harmonises with the 3 (B note) of the Gm chord. The coda beginning \"Cuando para mucho\", which is an exact copy of the instrumental intro, is initially sung to a ii (Fm chord), which moves to V–I (B to E chords) on \"cora-zon\", then alternates back to ii (Fm) on \"\"Mundo\" paparazzi\" and \"\"Cuesto\" obrigato\" before again V–I (B–E) on \"para-sol\" and \"carou-sel\".\n\nThe song is also notable for the vocally constructed ii-on-V 'slash' polychord (Dm/G; also written G) arising in the \"Ahh\" transition to verse (\"Here comes...\" and I (C) chord) while the bass makes the standard V (G note)–I (C note) move. The frequent use of added sixth chords in the song accentuate its dreamlike feel. The song also has an example of major 9th harmony in the Cmaj chord on \"Here the Sun King\"; here, above the tonic C major triad, both B (seventh) and D (ninth) combine in the vocals \"to form a suitably lush fanfare for the monarch himself.\"\n\nA portion of the vocals was included as a reversed a cappella in the track titled \"Gnik Nus\" for the 2006 album \"Love\". An instrumental section of \"Sun King\" was also used at the end of the track \"Octopus's Garden\" on the compilation.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2090365", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2090365", "title": "Anglo-Saxon art", "text": "Anglo-Saxon art\n\nAnglo-Saxon art covers art produced within the Anglo-Saxon period of English history, beginning with the Migration period style that the Anglo-Saxons brought with them from the continent in the 5th century, and ending in 1066 with the Norman Conquest of a large Anglo-Saxon nation-state whose sophisticated art was influential in much of northern Europe. The two periods of outstanding achievement were the 7th and 8th centuries, with the metalwork and jewellery from Sutton Hoo and a series of magnificent illuminated manuscripts, and the final period after about 950, when there was a revival of English culture after the end of the Viking invasions. By the time of the Conquest the move to the Romanesque style is nearly complete. The important artistic centres, in so far as these can be established, were concentrated in the extremities of England, in Northumbria, especially in the early period, and Wessex and Kent near the south coast.\n\nAnglo-Saxon art survives mostly in illuminated manuscripts, Anglo-Saxon architecture, a number of very fine ivory carvings, and some works in metal and other materials. Opus Anglicanum (\"English work\") was already recognised as the finest embroidery in Europe, although only a few pieces from the Anglo-Saxon period remain – the Bayeux Tapestry is a rather different sort of embroidery, on a far larger scale. As in most of Europe at the time, metalwork was the most highly regarded form of art by the Anglo-Saxons, but hardly any survives – there was enormous plundering of Anglo-Saxon churches, monasteries and the possessions of the dispossessed nobility by the new Norman rulers in their first decades, as well as the Norsemen before them, and the English Reformation after them, and most survivals were once on the continent. Anglo-Saxon taste favoured brightness and colour, and an effort of the imagination is often needed to see the excavated and worn remains that survive as they once were.\n\nPerhaps the best known piece of Anglo-Saxon art is the Bayeux Tapestry which was commissioned by a Norman patron from English artists working in the traditional Anglo-Saxon style. Anglo-Saxon artists also worked in fresco, stone, ivory and whalebone (notably the Franks Casket), metalwork (for example the Fuller brooch), glass and enamel, many examples of which have been recovered through archaeological excavation and some of which have simply been preserved over the centuries, especially in churches on the Continent, as the Vikings, Normans and Reformation iconoclasm between them left virtually nothing in England except for books and archaeological finds.\n\nMetalwork is almost the only form in which the earliest Anglo-Saxon art has survived, mostly in Germanic-style jewelry (including fittings for clothes and weapons) which was, before the Christianization of Anglo-Saxon England, commonly placed in burials. After the conversion, which took most of the 7th century, the fusion of Germanic Anglo-Saxon, Celtic and Late Antique techniques and motifs, together with the requirement for books, created Hiberno-Saxon style, or Insular art, which is also seen in illuminated manuscripts and some carved stone and ivory, probably mostly drawing from decorative metalwork motifs, and with further influences from the British Celts of the west and the Franks. The Kingdom of Northumbria in the far north of England was the crucible of Insular style in Britain, at centres such as Lindisfarne, founded c. 635 as an offshoot of the Irish monastery on Iona, and Monkwearmouth-Jarrow Abbey (674) which looked to the continent. At about the same time as the Insular Lindisfarne Gospels was being made in the early 8th century, the Vespasian Psalter from Canterbury in the far south, which the missionaries from Rome had made their headquarters, shows a wholly different, classically based art. These two styles mixed and developed together and by the following century the resulting Anglo-Saxon style had reached maturity.\n\nHowever Anglo-Saxon society was massively disrupted in the 9th century, especially the later half, by the Viking invasions, and the number of significant objects surviving falls considerably, and their dating becomes even vaguer than of those from a century before. Most monasteries in the north were closed for decades, if not forever, and after the Canterbury Bible of before 850, perhaps well before, \"no major illuminated manuscript is known until well on into the tenth century\". King Alfred (r. 871–899) held the Vikings back to a line running diagonally across the middle of England, above which they settled in the Danelaw, and were gradually integrated into what was now a unified Anglo-Saxon kingdom. \n\nThe final phase of Anglo-Saxon art is known as the Winchester School or style, though it was produced in many centres in the south of England, and perhaps the Midlands also. Elements of this begin to be seen from around 900, but the first major manuscripts only appear around the 930s. The style combined influences from the continental art of the Holy Roman Empire with elements of older English art, and some particular elements including a nervous agitated style of drapery, sometimes matched by figures, especially in line drawings, which are the only images in many manuscripts, and were to remain especially prominent in medieval English art.\n\nEarly Anglo-Saxon manuscript illumination forms part of Insular art, a combination of influences from Mediterranean, Celtic and Germanic styles that arose when the Anglo-Saxons encountered Irish missionary activity in Northumbria, at Lindisfarne and Iona in particular. At the same time the Gregorian mission from Rome and its successors imported continental manuscripts like the Italian St. Augustine Gospels, and for a considerable period the two styles appear mixed in a variety of proportions in Anglo-Saxon manuscripts. In the Lindisfarne Gospels, of around 700–715, there are carpet pages and Insular initials of unprecedented complexity and sophistication, but the evangelist portraits, clearly following Italian models, greatly simplify them, misunderstand some details of the setting, and give them a border with interlace corners. The portrait of St Matthew is based on the same Italian model, or one extremely similar, used for the figure of Ezra that is one of the two large miniatures in the Codex Amiatinus (before 716), but the style there is very different; a far more illusionistic treatment, and an \"attempt to introduce a pure Mediterranean style into Anglo-Saxon England\", which failed, as \"perhaps too advanced\", leaving these images apparently as the only evidence.\n\nA different mixture is seen in the opening from the Stockholm Codex Aureus (mid-8th century, left) where the evangelist portrait to the left is in a consistent adaptation of Italian style, probably closely following some lost model, though adding interlace to the chair frame, while the text page to the right is mainly in Insular style, especially in the first line, with its vigorous Celtic spirals and interlace. The following lines revert to a quieter style more typical of Frankish manuscripts of the period. Yet the same artist almost certainly produced both pages, and is very confident in both styles; the evangelist portrait of John includes roundels with Celtic spiral decoration probably drawn from the enamelled escutcheons of hanging bowls. This is one of the so-called \"Tiberius group\" of manuscripts, which leant towards the Italian style, and appear to be associated with Kent, or perhaps the kingdom of Mercia in the heyday of the Mercian Supremacy. It is, in the usual chronology, the last English manuscript in which \"developed trumpet spiral patterns\" are found.\nThe 9th century, especially the latter half, has very few major survivals made in England, but was a period when Insular and Anglo-Saxon influence on Carolingian manuscripts was at its height, from scriptoria such as those at the Anglo-Saxon mission's foundation at Echternach Abbey (though the important Echternach Gospels were created in Northumbria), and the major monastery at Tours, where Alcuin of York was followed by another Anglo-Saxon abbot, between them covering the period from 796 to 834. Although Tours' own library was destroyed by Norsemen, over 60 9th century illuminated manuscripts from the \"scriptorium\" survive, in a style showing many borrowings from English models, especially in initial pages, where Insular influence remained visible in northern France until even the 12th century. The Anglo-Saxon metalwork produced in the Salzburg area of modern Austria has a manuscript counterpart in the \"Cutbercht Gospels\" in Vienna.\n\nBy the 10th century Insular elements were relegated to decorative embellishments in England, as the first phase of the \"Winchester style\" developed. The first plant ornament, with leaves and grapes, was already seen in an initial in the Leningrad Bede, which can probably be dated to 746. The other large initial in the manuscript is the first historiated initial (one containing a portrait or scene, here Christ or a saint) in the whole of Europe. The classically derived vine or plant scroll was to largely oust interlace as the dominant filler of ornamental spaces in Anglo-Saxon art, just as it did in much of Europe beginning with Carolingian art, though in England animals within the scrolls remained much more common than abroad. For some long time scrolls, especially in metal, bone or ivory, are prone to have an animal head at one end and a plant element at the other. All these changes were not restricted to manuscripts, and may not have been driven by manuscript style, but we have a greater number of manuscripts surviving than works in other media, even if in most cases illuminations are restricted to initials and perhaps a few miniatures. Several ambitious projects of illumination are unfinished, such as the Old English Hexateuch, which has some 550 scenes in various stages of completion, giving insight into working methods. The illustrations give Old Testament scenes an entirely contemporary setting and are valuable images of Anglo-Saxon life.\n\nManuscripts from the Winchester School or style only survive from about the 930s onwards; this coincided with a wave of revival and reform within English monasticism, encouraged by King Æthelstan (r. 924/5-939) and his successors. Æthelstan promoted Dunstan (909–988), a practising illuminator, eventually to Archbishop of Canterbury, and also Æthelwold and the French-trained Norseman Oswald. Illumination in a new style appears in a manuscript of the biographies by Bede of St Cuthbert given by Æthelstan to the monastery in Chester-le-Street about 937. There is a dedication portrait of the king presenting his book to the saint, the two of them standing outside a large church. This is the first real portrait of an English king, and heavily influenced by Carolingian style, with an elegant inhabited acanthus border. However, the initials in the text combine Carolingian elements with animal forms in inventive fashion. Miniatures added in England to the continental Aethelstan Psalter begin to show Anglo-Saxon liveliness in figure drawing in compositions derived from Carolingian and Byzantine models, and over the following decades the distinctive Winchester style with agitated draperies and elaborate acanthus borders develops.\n\nThe Benedictional of St. Æthelwold is a masterpiece of the later Winchester style, which drew on Insular, Carolingian, and Byzantine art to make a heavier and more grandiose style, where the broad classicising acanthus foliage sometimes seems over-luxuriant. Anglo-Saxon illustration included many lively pen drawings, on which the Carolingian Utrecht Psalter, in Canterbury from about 1000, was highly influential; the Harley Psalter is a copy of it. The Ramsey Psalter (c. 990) contains pages in both the painted and tinted drawing styles, including the first Beatus initial with a \"lion mask\", while the Tiberius Psalter, from the last years before the Conquest, uses mainly the tinted. Anglo-Saxon culture was coming into increasing contact with, and exchanging influences with, a wider Latin Mediaeval Europe. Anglo-Saxon drawing had a great influence in Northern France throughout the 11th century, in the so-called \"Channel school\", and Insular decorative elements such as interlace remained popular into the 12th century in the Franco-Saxon style.\n\nPagan Anglo-Saxon metalwork initially uses the Germanic Animal Style I and II decoration that would be expected from recent immigrants, but gradually develops a distinctive Anglo-Saxon character, as in the Quoit Brooch Style of the 5th century. Anglo-Saxon brooches are the most common survivals of fine metalwork from the earlier period, when they were buried as grave goods. Round disk brooches were preferred for the grandest pieces, over continental styles of \"fibulae\" and Romano-British penannular brooches, a consistent Anglo-Saxon taste throughout the period; the Kingston Brooch and Harford Farm Brooch are 7th-century examples. Decoration included cloisonné (\"cellwork\"), in gold and garnet for high-status pieces. \n\nDespite a considerable number of other finds, the discovery of the ship-burial at Sutton Hoo, probably interred in the 620s, transformed the history of Anglo-Saxon art, showing a level of sophistication and quality that was wholly unexpected at this date. The most famous finds are the helmet and matching suite of purse-lid, belt and other fittings of the king buried there, which made clear the source in Anglo-Saxon art, previously much disputed, of many elements of the style of Insular manuscripts.\nBy the 10th century Anglo-Saxon metalwork had a famous reputation as far afield as Italy, where English goldsmiths worked on plate for the altar of St Peter's itself, but hardly any pieces have survived the depredations of the Norman Conquest in 1066, and the English Reformation, and none of the large-scale ones, shrines, doors and statues, that we know existed, and of which a few contemporary continental examples have survived.\n\nThe references to specific works by the 11th century monastic artist Spearhafoc, none of which have identifiably survived, are about works in precious metal, and he is one of a small number of metalwork artists from the period whose name we know and whose work is described in any way. According to several sources, including the Norman chronicler Goscelin, who knew him personally, Spearhafoc \"was outstanding in painting, gold-engraving and goldsmithery\", the painting very likely mainly in illuminated manuscripts. It was probably his artistic work which brought into contact with the royal family, and launched his rapid promotion in the church. Even the imprecise details given, mostly by Goscelin, are therefore valuable evidence of what Anglo-Saxon metalwork was like.\n\nAnglo-Saxon skill in gold-engraving, designs and figures engraved on gold objects, is mentioned by many foreign sources, and the few remaining engraved figures closely parallel the far more numerous pen-drawn figures in manuscripts, also an Anglo-Saxon speciality. Wall-paintings, which seem to have sometimes contained gold, were also apparently often made by manuscript illuminators, and Goscelin's description of his talents therefore suggests an artist skilled in all the main Anglo-Saxon media for figurative art – of which being a goldsmith was then regarded as the most prestigious branch. One 11th century lay goldsmith was even a \"thegn\".\nMany monastic artists reached senior positions; Spearhafoc's career in metalwork was paralleled in less sensational fashion by his contemporary Mannig, Abbot of Evesham (Abbot 1044–58, d. 1066), and at the end of the previous century Saint Dunstan had been a very successful Archbishop of Canterbury. Like Spearhafoc, Mannig's biography, with some precise details, is given in the chronicle maintained by his abbey. His work also had a miracle associated with it – the lay goldsmith Godric stabbed his hand with an awl during the work on the large shrine at Evesham, which was miraculously healed overnight. Spearhafoc and Mannig are the \"only two goldsmiths of whom we have extended accounts\", and the additional information given about Godric, the leader of a team brought in by Mannig for the shrine, is also unique among the surviving evidence. Some twenty years after the miracle, he joined the Abbey of Evesham, presumably in retirement, and his son later became Prior there.\n\nIn the final century of the period some large figures in precious metal are recorded; presumably these were made of thin sheets over a wooden core like the Golden Madonna of Essen, the largest example of this type of Early Medieval figure to survive from anywhere in Europe. These appear to have been life-size, or nearly so, and were mostly crucifixes, sometimes with figures of Mary and John the Evangelist on either side. Patronage by the great figures of the land, and the largest monasteries, became extravagant in this period, and the greatest late Anglo-Saxon churches must have presented a dazzling spectacle, somewhat in the style of Eastern Orthodox churches. Anglo-Saxon taste revelled in expensive materials and the effects of light on precious metals, which were also embroidered into fabrics and used on wall-paintings. Sections of decorated elements from some large looted works such as reliquaries were sawn up by Viking raiders and taken home to their wives to wear as jewellery, and a number of these survive in Scandinavian museums.\nWhile larger works are all lost, several small objects and fragments have survived, nearly all having been buried; in recent decades professional archaeology as well as metal-detecting and deep ploughing have greatly increased the number of objects known. Among the few unburied exceptions are the secular Fuller Brooch, and two works made in Anglo-Saxon style carried to Austria by the Anglo-Saxon mission, the Tassilo Chalice (late 8th century) and the Rupertus Cross. Especially in the 9th century, Anglo-Saxon styles, sometimes derived from manuscripts rather than metal examples, are found in a great number of smaller pieces of jewellery and other small fittings from across northern Europe.\n\nFrom England itself, the Alfred Jewel, with an enamel face, is the best known of a group of finely worked liturgical jewels, and there are a number of high quality disk brooches. The most ornate of earlier ones are colourful and complicated with inlays and filigrees, but the 9th century Pentney Hoard, discovered in 1978, contained six splendid brooches in flat silver openwork in the \"Trewhiddle style\". In these small but fully formed animals, of no recognisable species, contort themselves in foliage and tendrils that interlace, but without the emphatic geometry of the earlier \"ribbon\" style. Ædwen's brooch, an 11th-century Anglo-Scandinavian silver disk brooch, shows influence from Viking art, and a fall-off from the highest earlier standards of workmanship.\n\nIn 2009 the Staffordshire hoard, a major hoard of over 1,500 fragments of 7th and ?8th century metalwork pieces, mostly gold and military in nature, many with gold and garnet cloisonné inlays of high quality, was found by a metal-detectorist in Staffordshire, then in Mercia. Jewellery is far more often found from burials of the early pagan period, as Christianity discouraged grave-goods, even the personal possessions of the deceased. Early Anglo-Saxon jewellery includes various types of \"fibulae\" that are close to their Continental Germanic equivalents, but until Sutton Hoo rarely of outstanding quality, which is why that find transformed thinking about early Anglo-Saxon art. Objects from the Royal Anglo-Saxon tomb in Prittlewell, late 6th century and discovered in 2003, will go on display in 2019. \n\nThe earliest Anglo-Saxon coin type, the silver \"sceat\", forced craftsmen, no doubt asked to copy Roman and contemporary continental styles, to work outside their traditional forms and conventions in respect of the heads on the obverse, with results that are varied and often compelling. Later silver pennies, with largely linear relief heads of kings in profile on the obverse, are more uniform, as representatives of what was a stable and respected currency by contemporary European standards. A number of complete \"seax\" knives have survived with inscriptions and some decoration, and sword fittings and other military pieces are an important form of jewellery. A treatise on social status needed to say that mere ownership of a gilded sword did not make a man a \"ceorle\", the lowest rank of free men.\n\nApart from Anglo-Saxon architecture, which survives entirely in churches, with only a handful of largely unaltered examples, monumental stone sculpture survives in large stone crosses, an equivalent to the high crosses of the Celtic areas of Britain. Most sculpture was probably once painted, clarifying the designs, which are mostly in relatively low relief and not finished with great precision, and now almost all badly worn and weathered. Dating is usually difficult. Sculpture in wood was very likely more common, but almost the only significant large survival is St Cuthbert's coffin in Durham Cathedral, probably made in 698, with numerous linear images carved or incised in a technique that is a sort of large-scale engraving. The material of the earliest recorded crosses is unknown, but may well have been wood. From various references (to its destruction by Christians) there would seem to have been a tradition of Anglo-Saxon pagan monumental sculpture, probably in wood, of which no examples remain (as opposed to later Anglo-Scandinavian pagan imagery), and with which the crosses initially competed.\n\nThe Anglo-Saxon crosses have survived less well than those in Ireland, being more subject to iconoclasm after the English Reformation. Some featured large figurative sculpture of considerable quality, as on the Ruthwell Cross and Bewcastle Cross (both probably around 800). Vine-scroll decoration and interlace are seen in alternating panels on the early Northumbrian Ruthwell, Bewcastle and Easby Crosses, though the vine-scroll is already more prominent, and has faces to itself. Later Southumbrian crosses often only use vine-scrolls. There may be inscriptions, in the runic or Roman scripts, and Latin or Old English, most famously at Ruthwell, where some of the poem the \"Dream of the Rood\" is inscribed together with Latin texts; more often donors are commemorated. It has also been suggested that as well as paint, they may have been embellished with metalwork and gems.\n\nTypically, Anglo-Saxon crosses are tall and slender compared to Irish examples, many with a nearly square section, and more space given to ornament than figures. However, there are exceptions, like the massive Sandbach Crosses from Mercia, with oblong sections mostly covered by figures on the wider faces, like some Irish crosses. The Gosforth Cross, of 930–950, is a rare example to survive complete; most survivals are only a section of the shaft, and iconoclasts were more concerned to destroy imagery than ornament. Many crosses must have just fallen over after some centuries; headpieces are the least common survivals, and the Easby Cross was repaired with lead in a way described in early documents. Like many monuments from the area of the Danelaw, the Gosforth Cross combines Christian images with those from pagan mythology; apart from a Crucifixion scene, and perhaps scenes of the Last Judgement, all the other images appear to belong to the Norse myth of \"Ragnarök\", the destruction of the gods, a theme detected in other Christian monuments in Britain and Scandinavia, and which could be turned to Christian advantage.\nAnglo-Scandinavians took up Anglo-Saxon sculptural forms with great enthusiasm, and in Yorkshire alone there are fragments from more than 500 monumental sculptures of the 10th and 11th centuries. However quantity was not matched by quality, and even the products of the main city, York, are described by David M. Wilson as \"generally miserable and slipshod\". In the early stages the successive styles of Norse art appear in England, but gradually as political and cultural ties weakened the Anglo-Scandinavians fail to keep up with trends in the homeland. So elements of the Borre style are seen, for example in the \"ring-chain\" interlace on the Gosforth Cross, and then the complex animals of the Jelling style are mostly rather incompetently depicted in England, but traces of the next Mammen style are hard to detect; they are much clearer on the Isle of Man. They are \"perhaps, dimly\" evident in the cross shaft from St Oswald's Priory, Gloucester (illustrated right). In general the traces of these styles in other media are even fainter. A uniquely Anglo-Scandinavian form is the hogback, low grave-marker shaped like a long house with a pitched roof, and sometimes muzzled bears clutching on to each end. Ornament is sometimes a crude pattern of scoring, or scale-like elements presumably representing roofing shingles, but may include interlace and images.\n\nMany fragments, parts of friezes and panels with figure and ornamental carving, have been recovered by archaeology, usually after being reused in rebuilt churches. The largest group of Anglo-Saxon sculpture is from a former abbey at Breedon-on-the-Hill in Mercia, with a number of elements of different dates, including lively narrow decorative strip friezes, many including human figures, and panels with saints and the Virgin. The most intriguing fragments are firstly a group, now at Canterbury Cathedral, from St Mary's Church, Reculver, in Kent, from a large composition with many figure scenes and groups on a curved surface, evidently of high quality, though uncertain date (perhaps early 10th century). A \"Sacrifice of Isaac\" and an \"Ascension\" can be identified, and parts of standing groups of saints, prophets or apostles.\n\nStanding equally apart from other survivals is a late slab from the Old Minster, Winchester which appears to show a section of a large frieze with the story from Germanic mythology of Sigmund, which it has been suggested may have been as long as eighty feet wide, and over four feet high. There are literary references to secular narrative tapestries, a tradition of which the Bayeux Tapestry is the only survival, and this may have been a stone equivalent, celebrating Sigmund, who was believed to be an ancestor of the intermarried royal houses of both England and Denmark, many of whom were buried in what was then the largest church in England.\n\nIt is also clear from literary sources that wall paintings were not uncommon, although not a prestigious form, and fragments of painted plaster have been found, as well as a painted face on a reused stone at Winchester, dating to before 903, and so an important early example of the Winchester figure style. A metaphor in a letter of Alcuin speaks of \"stars, like the painted ceiling of a great man's house\". However, no paintings that are at all complete have survived on either wall or panel.\n\nAs in the rest of the Christian world, while monumental sculpture was slowly re-emerging from its virtual absence in the Early Christian period, small-scale sculpture in metalwork, ivory carving and also bone carving was more important than in later periods, and by no means a \"minor art\". Most Anglo-Saxon ivory was from marine animals, especially the walrus, imported from further north. The extraordinary early Franks Casket is carved from whalebone, which a riddle on it alludes to. It contains a unique mixture of pagan, historical and Christian scenes, evidently attempting to cover a general history of the world, and inscriptions in runes in both Latin and Old English. We have few Anglo-Saxon panels from book-covers compared to those from Carolingian and Ottonian art but a number of figures of very high quality in high relief or fully in the round. In the last phase of Anglo-Saxon art two styles are apparent: one a heavier and formal one drawing from Carolingian and Ottonian sources, and the other the Winchester style, drawing from the Utrecht Psalter and an alternative Carolingian tradition. A very late boxwood casket, now in Cleveland, Ohio, is carved all over with scenes from the \"Life of Christ\" in a provincial but accomplished version of the Winchester style, possibly originating in the West Midlands, and is a unique survival of late Anglo-Saxon fine wood carving.\n\nThe textile arts of embroidery and \"tapestry\", \"Opus anglicanum\", were apparently those for which Anglo-Saxon England was famous throughout Europe by the end of the period, but there are only a handful of survivals, probably partly because of the Anglo-Saxon love of using threads in precious metal, making the work valuable for scrap.\n\nThe Bayeux Tapestry is embroidered in wool on linen and shows the story of the Norman conquest of England; it is surely the best known Anglo-Saxon work of art, and though made after the Conquest was both made in England and firmly in an Anglo-Saxon tradition, points now accepted by French art-historians. Such tapestries adorned both churches and wealthy houses in England, though at 0.5 by 68.38 metres (1.6 by 224.3 ft, and apparently incomplete) the Bayeux Tapestry must be exceptionally large. Only the figures and decoration are embroidered, on a background left plain, which shows the subject very clearly and was necessary to cover very large areas. All kinds of textile arts were produced by women, both nuns and laywomen, but many were probably designed by artists in other media. Byzantine silks were available, though certainly expensive, in Anglo-Saxon England, and a number of pieces have been found used in burials and reliquaries. Probably, as in later vestments, these were often married with locally embroidered borders and panels. If we had more Anglo-Saxon survivals, Byzantine influences would no doubt be apparent.\n\nThe most highly valued embroideries were very different, fully worked in silk and gold of silver thread, and sometimes with gems of various sorts sewn in. These were used for vestments, altar-cloths and other church uses, and similar roles in the homes of the elite. Only a few pieces have survived, including three pieces at Durham placed in the coffin of St Cuthbert, probably in the 930s, after being given by King Athelstan; they were made in Winchester between 909 and 916. These are works \"of breathtaking brilliance and quality\", according to Wilson, including figures of saints, and important early examples of the Winchester style, though the origin of their style is a puzzle; they are closest to the wall-painting fragment from Winchester mentioned above, and an early example of acanthus decoration.\n\nThe earliest group of survivals, now re-arranged and with the precious metal thread mostly picked out, are bands or borders from vestments, incorporating pearls and glass beads, with various types of scroll and animal decoration. These are probably 9th century and now in a church in Maaseik in Belgium. A further style of textile is a vestment illustrated in a miniature portrait of Saint Aethelwold in his Benedictional (see above), which shows the edge of what appears to be a huge acanthus \"flower\" (a term used in several documentary records) covering the wearer's back and shoulders. Other written sources mention other large-scale compositions.\n\nAnglo-Saxon glass was mostly made in simple forms, with vessels always in a single colour, either clear, green or brown, but some fancy claw beakers decorated with large \"claw\" forms have survived, mostly broken; these forms are also found in northern continental Europe. Beads, common in early female burials, and some ecclesiastical window glass was more brightly coloured, and several monastic sites have evidence of glass production. Vessel and bead production probably continued, at a much lower level, from the Romano-British industry, but Bede records that Benedict Biscop brought glass-makers from Gaul for window glass at his monasteries. It is not clear how much Anglo-Saxon glass was imported, but canes of millefiori coloured glass almost certainly were; one of these was in the purse at Sutton Hoo. Otherwise recycling of Roman glass may have avoided the need to import raw glass; evidence for the production of this is slender. Glass is sometimes used as a substitute for garnet in jewellery, as in some pieces from Sutton Hoo. Enamel was used, most famously in the Alfred Jewel, where the image sits under carved rock crystal, both materials are extremely rare in surviving Anglo-Saxon work.\n\nThe unique decorated leather cover of the small Northumbrian St Cuthbert Gospel, the oldest Western bookbinding to survive unaltered, can be dated to 698 or shortly before. It uses incised lines, some colours, and relief decoration built up over cord and gesso or leather pieces. Larger prestige manuscripts had metalwork treasure bindings, several of which are mentioned, but there may well have been much decorated leatherwork for secular satchels, purses, belts and the like, which contemporaries did not bother to mention and which represents a gap in our knowledge for the Early Medieval period throughout Europe.\n\nRelatively little art survives from the rest of the century after 1066, or at least is confidently dated to that period. The art of Normandy was already under heavy Anglo-Saxon influence, but the period was one of massive despoliation of the churches by the small new ruling class, who had almost entirely dispossessed the old Anglo-Saxon elite. Under these circumstances little significant art was produced, but when it was, the style often showed a slow development of Anglo-Saxon styles into a fully Romanesque version. The attribution of many individual objects has jumped around across the boundary of the Norman Conquest, especially for sculpture, including ivories. A number of objects are claimed for their period by both the \"Golden Age of Anglo-Saxon Art\" and the \"English Romanesque art: 1066–1200\" exhibition catalogues, despite both being published in 1984. These include the ivory triangle mount with angels and the \"Sigurd\" stone relief fragment (discussed above), both from Winchester, and the ivory \"pen-case\" and \"Baptism\" (illustrated above), both in the British Museum.\n\nThe energy, love of complicated twining ornament, and refusal to wholly respect a dignified classical decorum that are displayed in both Insular and Winchester school art had already influenced continental style, as discussed above, where it provided an alternative to the heavy monumentality that Ottonian art displays even in small objects. This habit of mind was an essential component of both the Romanesque and Gothic styles, where forms of Anglo-Saxon invention such as the inhabited and historiated initials became more important than they ever had in Anglo-Saxon art itself, and works like the Gloucester Candlestick (c. 1110) show the process in other media.\n\nAnglo-Saxon iconographical innovations include the animal Hellmouth, the ascending Christ shown only as a pair of legs and feet disappearing at the top of the image, the horned Moses, St John the Evangelist standing at the foot of the cross and writing, and God the Father creating the world with a pair of compasses. All of these were later used across Europe. The earliest developed depiction of the \"Last Judgement\" in the West is also found on an Anglo-Saxon ivory, and a late Anglo-Saxon Gospel book may show the earliest example of Mary Magdalene at the foot of the cross in a \"Crucifixion\".\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2090443", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2090443", "title": "Apollon Maykov", "text": "Apollon Maykov\n\nApollon Nikolayevich Maykov (, , Moscow – , Saint Petersburg) was a Russian poet, best known for his lyric verse showcasing images of Russian villages, nature, and history. His love for ancient Greece and Rome, which he studied for much of his life, is also reflected in his works. Maykov spent four years translating the epic \"The Tale of Igor's Campaign\" (1870) into modern Russian. He translated the folklore of Belarus, Greece, Serbia and Spain, as well as works by Heine, Adam Mickiewicz and Goethe, among others. Several of Maykov's poems were set to music by Russian composers, among them Rimsky-Korsakov and Tchaikovsky.\n\nMaykov was born into an artistic family and educated at home, by the writer Ivan Goncharov, among others. At the age of 15, he began writing his first poetry. After finishing his gymnasium course in just three years, he enrolled in Saint Petersburg University in 1837.\n\nHe began publishing his poems in 1840, and came out with his first collection in 1842. The collection was reviewed favorably by the influential critic Vissarion Belinsky. After this, he traveled throughout Europe, returning to Saint Petersburg in 1844, where he continued to publish poetry and branched out into literary criticism and essay writing.\n\nHe continued writing throughout his life, wavering several times between the conservative and liberal camps, but maintaining a steady output of quality poetical works. In his liberal days he was close to Belinsky, Nikolay Nekrasov, and Ivan Turgenev, while in his conservative periods he was close to Fyodor Dostoyevsky. He ended his life as a conservative. Maykov died in Saint Petersburg On March 8, 1897.\n\nApollon Maykov was born into an artistic family. His father, Nikolay Maykov, was a painter, and in his later years an academic of the Imperial Academy of Arts. His mother, Yevgeniya Petrovna Maykova (née Gusyatnikova, 1803–1880), loved literature and later in life had some of her own poetry published. The boy's childhood was spent at the family estate just outside Moscow, in a house often visited by writers and artists. Maykov's early memories and impressions formed the foundation for his much lauded landscape lyricism, marked by what biographer Igor Yampolsky calls \"a touchingly naive love for the old patriarchal ways.\"\n\nIn 1834 the family moved to Saint Petersburg. Apollon and his brother Valerian were educated at home, under the guidance of their father's friend Vladimir Solonitsyn, a writer, philologist and translator, known also for Nikolay Maykov's 1839 portrait of him. Ivan Goncharov, then an unknown young author, taught Russian literature to the Maykov brothers. As he later remembered, the house \"was full of life, and had many visitors, providing a never ceasing flow of information from all kinds of intellectual spheres, including science and the arts.\" At the age of 15 Apollon started to write poetry. With a group of friends (Vladimir Benediktov, Ivan Goncharov and Pavel Svinyin among others) the Maykov brothers edited two hand-written magazines, Podsnezhnik (Snow-drop) and Moonlit Nights, where Apollon's early poetry appeared for the first time.\n\nMaykov finished his whole gymnasium course in just three years, and in 1837 enrolled in Saint Petersburg University's law faculty. As a student he learned Latin which enabled him to read Ancient Roman authors in the original texts. He later learned Ancient Greek, but until then had to content himself with French translations of the Greek classics. It was at the university that Maykov developed his passionate love of Ancient Greece and Rome.\n\nApollon Maykov's first poems (signed \"M.\") were published in 1840 by the \"Odessa Almanac\" and in 1841 by \"Biblioteka Dlya Chteniya\" and \"Otechestvennye Zapiski\". He also studied painting, but soon chose to devote himself entirely to poetry. Instrumental in this decision was Pyotr Pletnyov, a University professor who, acting as a mentor for the young man, showed the first poems of his protégé to such literary giants as Vasily Zhukovsky and Nikolai Gogol. Maykov never became a painter, but the lessons he received greatly influenced his artistic worldview and writing style.\n\nIn 1842 his first collection \"Poems by A.N. Maykov\" was published, to much acclaim. \"For me it sounds like Delvig's ideas expressed by Pushkin,\" Pletnyov wrote. Vissarion Belinsky responded with a comprehensive essay, praising the book's first section called \"Poems Written for an Anthology\", a cycle of verses stylized after both ancient Greek epigrams and the traditional elegy. He was flattered by the famous critic's close attention. Maykov paid heed to his advice and years later, working on the re-issues, edited much of the text in direct accordance with Belinsky's views.\n\nAfter graduating from the university, Maykov joined the Russian Ministry of Finance as a clerk. Having received a stipend for his first book from Tsar Nicholas I, he used the money to travel abroad, visiting Italy (where he spent most of his time writing poetry and painting), France, Saxony, and Austria. In Paris Apollon and Valerian attended lectures on literature and fine arts at the Sorbonne and the College de France. On his way back Maykov visited Dresden and Prague where he met Vaclav Hanka and Pavel Jozef Safarik, the two leaders of the national revival movement. The direct outcome of this voyage for Apollon Maykov was a University dissertation on the history of law in Eastern Europe.\n\nIn 1844 Maykov returned to Saint Petersburg to join the Rumyantsev Museum library as an assistant. He became actively involved with the literary life of the Russian capital, contributing to \"Otechestvennye Zapiski\", \"Finsky Vestnik\" and \"Sovremennik\". He also debuted as a critic and published several essays on literature and fine art, reviewing works by artists like Ivan Aivazovsky, Fyodor Tolstoy and Pavel Fedotov.\n\nIn 1846 the \"Petersburg Anthology\" published his poem \"Mashenka\", which saw Maykov discarding elegy and leaning towards a more down-to-Earth style of writing. Again Belinsky was impressed, hailing the arrival of \"a new talent, quite capable of presenting real life in its true light.\" The critic also liked \"Two Fates\" (Saint Petersburg, 1845). A \"natural school\" piece, touched by Mikhail Lermontov's influence, it featured \"a Pechorin-type character, an intelligent, thinking nobleman retrogressing into a low-brow philistine,\" according to Alexander Hertzen's review. In the late 1840s Maykov was also writing prose, in a Gogol-influenced style known as the \"physiological sketch\". Among the short stories he published at the time were \"Uncle's Will\" (1847) and \"The Old Woman – Fragments from the Notes of a Virtuous Man\" (1848).\n\nIn the late 1840s Maykov entered Belinsky's circle and became friends with Nikolai Nekrasov and Ivan Turgenev. Along with his brother Valerian he started to attend Mikhail Petrashevsky's 'Secret Fridays', establishing contacts with Fyodor Dostoyevsky and Aleksey Pleshcheyev. Later, having been interrogated about his involvement, Maykov avoided arrest (he did not have a significant role in the group's activities), but for several years was kept under secret police surveillance. In the years to come Maykov, who never believed in the ideas of socialism, often expressed embarrassment over his involvement in the Petrashevsky affair. In an 1854 letter to M. A. Yazykov he confessed: \"At the time I had very vague political ideas and was foolish enough to join a group where all the government's actions were criticized and condemned as wrong a priory, many of [its members] applauding every mistake, according to the logic of 'the worse they rule, the quicker they'll fall'. In the 1850s Maykov, now a Slavophile, began to champion 'firm' monarchy and strong Orthodox values. Writing to Aleksandr Nikitenko he argued: \"Only a form of political system which had been proven by the test of history could be called viable\". In 1852 Maykov moved into the office of the Russian Committee of Foreign censorship, where he continued working for the rest of his life, becoming its chairman in 1882.\nIn 1847 Maykov's second collection of poems, \"Sketches of Rome\", the artistic outcome of his earlier European trip, was published. Informed with Belinsky's criticism, some poems were built on the juxtaposition of the majestic ruins and lush landscapes of 'classic' Rome with the everyday squalor of contemporary Italy. This homage to the \"natural school\" movement, though, did not make Maykov's style less flamboyant; on the contrary, it was in \"Sketches of Rome\" that he started to make full use of exotic epithets and colorful imagery.\n\nIn 1848–1852 Maykov wrote little, but became active during the Crimean War. First came the poem \"Claremont Cathedral\" (1853), an ode to Russia's historical feat of preventing the Mongol hordes from devastating European civilization. This was followed by the compilation \"Poems, 1854\". Some of the poems, like those about the siege of Sevastopol (\"To General-Lieutenant Khrulyov\") were welcomed by the literary left (notably Nekrasov and Chernyshevsky). Others (\"In Memory of Derzhavin\" and \"A Message to the Camp\") were seen as glorifying the monarchy and were deemed 'reactionary'. The last \"1854\" poem, \"The Harlequin\", was a caricature on a revolutionary keen to bring chaos and undermine centuries-old moral principles. Now a 'patriarchal monarchist', Maykov started to praise the Nikolai I regime. Another poem, \"The Carriage\", where Maykov openly supported the Tsar, was not included in \"1854\", but circulated in its hand-written version and did his reputation a lot of harm. Enemies either ridiculed the poet or accused him of political opportunism and base flattery. Some of his friends were positively horrified. In his epigrams, poet Nikolay Shcherbina labeled Maykov 'chameleon' and 'servile slave'. While social democrats (who dominated the Russian literary scene of the time) saw political and social reforms as necessary for Russia, Maykov called for the strengthening of state power.\n\nAfter Russia's defeat in the war the tone of Maykov's poetry changed. Poems like \"The war is over. Vile peace is signed...\", \"Whirlwind\" (both 1856), \"He and Her\" (1867) criticized corrupt high society and weak, inadequate officials who were indifferent to the woes of the country and its people. Now openly critical of Nikolai I, Maykov admitted to having been wrong when professing a belief in the monarch.\n\nIn 1858 Maykov took part in the expedition to Greece on board the corvette \"Bayan\". Prior to that he read numerous books about the country and learned the modern Greek language. Two books came out as a result of this trip: \"The Naples Album\" (which included \"Tarantella\", one of his best known poems) and \"Songs of Modern Greece\". The former, focusing on contemporary Italian life, was coldly received by Russian critics who found it too eclectic. In retrospect it is regarded as a curious experiment in breaking genre barriers, with images and conversations from foreign life used to express things which in Russia could not be commented on publicly at the time. In the latter, the author's sympathy for the Greek liberation movement is evident.\n\nThe early 1860s saw Maykov's popularity on the rise: he often performed in public and had his works published by the leading Russian magazines. In the mid-1860s he once again drifted towards the conservative camp, and stayed there for the rest of his life. He condemned young radicals, and expressed solidarity with Mikhail Katkov's nationalistic remarks regarding the Polish Uprising and Russian national policy in general. In poems like \"Fields\" (which employed Gogol's metaphor of Russia as a troika, but also expressed horror at emerging capitalism), \"Niva\" and \"The Sketch\" he praised the 1861 reforms, provoking sharp criticism from Saltykov-Schedrin and Nikolay Dobrolyubov. Adopting the Pochvennichestvo doctrine, Maykov became close to Apollon Grigoriev, Nikolai Strakhov, and Fyodor Dostoyevsky; his friendship with the latter proved to be a particularly firm and lasting one.\n\nIn the 1860s and 1870s Maykov contributed mainly to \"Russky Vestnik\". One of the leading proponents of Russian Panslavism, he saw his country as fulfilling its mission in uniting Slavs, but first and foremost freeing the peoples of the Balkans from Turkish occupation. \"Once you've seen Russia in this [Panslavic] perspective, you start to understand its true nature and feel ready to devote yourself to this life-affirming cause,\" wrote Maykov in a letter to Dostoyevsky. The mission of art, according to the poet, was to develop the national self-consciousness and revive the 'historical memory' of Russians. The Slavic historic and moral basis on which it stood became the major theme of Maykov's poetry cycles \"Of the Slavic World\", \"At Home\", and \"Callings of History\". Well aware of the darker side of Russia's historic legacy, he still thought it necessary to highlight its 'shining moments' (\"It's dear to me, before the icon...\", 1868). Maykov was not a religious person himself but attributed great importance to the religious fervor of the common people, seeing it as the basis for 'moral wholesomeness' (\"The spring, like an artist\", 1859; \"Ignored by all...\", 1872). His religious poems of the late 1880s (\"Let go, let go...\", \"The sunset’s quiet shine...\", \"Eternal night is near...\") differed radically from his earlier odes to paganism. In them Maykov professed a belief in spiritual humility and expressed the conviction that this particular feature of the Russian national character would be its saving grace.\n\nUnlike his artistic ally Afanasy Fet, Maykov always felt the need for maintaining 'spiritual bonds' with common people and, according to biographer Yampolsky, followed \"the folk tradition set by Pushkin, Lermontov, Krylov and Koltsov\". Yet he was skeptical of the doctrine of narodnost as formulated by Dobrolyubov and Chernyshevsky, who saw active promotion of the democratic movement as the mission of Russian literature. In 1853, horrified by Nekrasov's poem \"The Muse\", Maykov wrote \"An Epistle to Nekrasov\", in which he urged the latter to \"dilute his malice in nature's harmony.\" Yet he never severed ties with his opponent and often gave him credit. \"There is only one poetic soul here, and that is Nekrasov,\" Maykov wrote in an October 1854 letter to Ivan Nikitin.\n\nAccording to Yampolsky, Nekrasov's poem \"Grandfather\" (1870, telling the story of a nobleman supporting the revolutionary cause) might have been an indirect answer to Maykov's poem \"Grandmother\" (1861) which praised the high moral standards of the nobility and condemned the generation of nihilists. Maykov's poem \"Princess\" (1876) had its heroine Zhenya, a girl from an aristocratic family, join a gang of conspirators and lose all notions of normality, religious, social or moral. However, unlike Vsevolod Krestovsky or Viktor Klyushnikov, Maykov treated his 'nihilist' characters rather like victims of the post-Crimean war social depression rather than villains in their own right.\n\nSeeking inspiration and moral virtue in Russian folklore, which he called \"the treasury of the Russian soul\", Maykov tried to revive the archaic Russian language tradition. In his later years he made numerous freestyle translations and stylized renditions of Belarussian and Serbian folk songs. He developed a strong interest in non-Slavic folklore too, exemplified by the epic poems \"Baldur\" (1870) and \"Bringilda\" (1888) based on the Scandinavian epos.\n\nIn the late 1860s Maykov became intrigued by \"The Tale of Igor's Campaign\", which his son was studying in gymnasium at the time. Baffled by the vagueness and occasional incongruity of all the available translations, he shared his doubts with professor Izmail Sreznevsky, who replied: \"It is for you to sort these things out.\" Maykov later described the four years of work on the new translation that followed as his \"second university\". His major objective was to come up with undeniable proof of the authenticity of the old text, something that many authors, Ivan Goncharov among them, expressed doubts about. Ignoring Dostoyevsky's advice to use rhymes so as to make the text sound more modern, Maykov provided the first ever scientifically substantiated translation of the document, supplied with comprehensive commentaries. First published in the January 1870 issue of \"Zarya\" magazine, it is still regarded as one of the finest achievements of his career.\n\nFor Maykov, who took his historical poems and plays seriously, authenticity was the main objective. In his Old Believers drama \"The Wanderer\" (1867), he used the hand-written literature of raskolniks and, \"having discovered those poetic gems, tried to re-mold them into... modern poetic forms,\" as he explained in the preface. In his historical works Maykov often had contemporary Russian issues in mind. \"While writing of ancient history I was looking for parallels to the things that I had to live through. Our times provide so many examples of the rise and fall of the human spirit that an attentive eye looking for analogies can spot a lot,\" he wrote.\n\nMaykov's first foray into the history of early Christianity, \"Olynthus and Esther\" (1841) was criticized by Belinsky. He returned to this theme ten years later in the lyrical drama \"Three Deaths\" (1857), was dissatisfied with the result, and went on to produce part two, \"The Death of Lucius\" (1863). \"Three Deaths\" became the starting point of his next big poem, \"Two Worlds\", written in 1872, then re-worked and finished in 1881. Following Belinsky's early advice, Maykov abandoned Lucius, a weak Epicurean, and made the new hero Decius, a patrician who, while hating Nero, still hopes for the state to rise up from its ashes. Like \"Sketches of Rome\" decades earlier, \"Two Worlds\" was a eulogy to Rome's eternal glory, its hero fighting Christianity, driven by the belief that Rome is another Heaven, \"its dome embracing Earth.\"\n\nWhile in his earlier years Maykov was greatly intrigued by antiquity, later in life he became more interested in Christianity and its dramatic stand against oppressors. While some contemporaries praised Maykov for his objectivity and scholarly attitude, the Orthodox Christian critics considered him to be \"too much of a heathen\" who failed to show Christianity in its true historical perspective. Later literary historians viewed Maykov's historical dramas favourably, crediting the author for neutrality and insight. Maykov's antiquity \"lives and breathes, it is anything but dull,\" wrote critic F. Zelinsky in 1908. For the \"Two Worlds\" Maykov received The Russian Academy of Sciences' Pushkin Prize in 1882.\n\nIn 1858 Grigory Kushelev-Bezborodko published the first Maykov anthology \"Poems by Ap. Maykov\". In 1879 it was expanded and re-issued by Vladimir Meshchersky. \"The Complete Maykov\" came out in 1884 (its second edition following in 1893). In the 1880s Maykov's poetry was dominated by religious and nationalistic themes and ideas. According to I. Yampolsky, only a few of his later poems (\"Emshan\", \"The Spring\", 1881) had 'indisputable artistic quality'. In his later years the poet wrote almost nothing new, engaging mostly in editing his earlier work and preparing them for compilations and anthologies. \"Maykov lived the quiet, radiant life of an artist, evidently not belonging to our times... his path was smooth and full of light. No strife, no passions, no persecution,\" wrote Dmitry Merezhkovsky in 1908. Although this generalization was far from the truth, according to biographer F. Priyma, it certainly expressed the general public's perception of him.\n\nApollon Maykov died in Saint Petersburg On March 8, 1897. \"His legacy will always sound as the mighty, harmonious and very complicated final chord to the Pushkin period of Russian poetry,\" wrote Arseny Golenishchev-Kutuzov in the Ministry of Education's obituary.\n\nMaykov's initial rise to fame, according to the Soviet scholar Fyodor Pryima, had a lot to do with Pushkin and Lermontov's untimely deaths, and the feeling of desolation shared by many Russian intellectuals of the time. Vissarion Belinsky, who discovered this new talent, believed it was up to Maykov to fill this vacuum. \"The emergence of this new talent is especially important in our times, when in the devastated Church of Art... we see but grimacing jesters entertaining dumb obscurants, egotistic mediocrities, merchants and speculators,\" Belinsky wrote, reviewing Maykov's debut collection.\n\nHailing the emergence of a new powerful talent, Belinsky unreservedly supported the young author's 'anthological' stylizations based upon the poetry of Ancient Greece, praising \"the plasticity and gracefulness of the imagery,\" the virtuosity in the art of the decorative, the \"poetic, lively language\" but also the simplicity and lack of pretentiousness. \"Even in Pushkin's legacy this poem would have rated among his best anthological pieces,\" Belinsky wrote about the poem called \"The Dream\". Still, he advised the author to leave the 'anthological' realm behind as soon as possible and expressed dissatisfaction with poems on Russia's recent history. While admitting \"Who's He\" (a piece on Peter the Great, which some years later found its way into textbooks) was \"not bad\", Belinsky lambasted \"Two Coffins\", a hymn to Russia's victories over Karl XII and Napoleon.\n\nMaykov's debut collection made him one of the leading Russian poets. In the 1840s \"his lexical and rhythmic patterns became more diverse but the style remained the same, still relying upon the basics of classical elegy,\" according to the biographer Mayorova, who noted a strange dichotomy between the flamboyant wording and static imagery, and pointed to the \"insurmountable distance between the poet and the world he pictured.\"\n\nAfter Belinsky's death, Maykov started to waver between the two camps of the Westernizers and the Slavophiles, and the critics, accordingly, started to treat his work on the basis of their own political views in relation to the poet's changing ideological stance. Maykov's 1840s' \"natural school\"- influenced poems were praised (and published) by Nikolay Nekrasov. His later works, expressing conservative, monarchist and anti-'nihilist' views, were supported by Dostoyevsky, who on more than one occasion pronounced Maykov Russia's major poet.\n\nIn his 1895 article for the Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary, the philosopher and critic Vladimir Solovyov argued that Maykov's dominant characteristics were \"a serene, contemplating tone, elaborate patterns, a distinct and individual style (in form, although not in colors) with a relatively lackluster lyric side, the latter suffering obviously from too much attention to details, often at the expense of the original inspiration.\" Maykov's best works were, the critic opined, \"powerful and expressive, even if not exceptionally sonorous.\" Speaking of Maykov's subject matter, Solovyov was almost dismissive:Two major themes form the foundation of Maykov's poetry, the Ancient Greek aesthetic and historical myths of the Byzantine-Russian politics; bonded only by the poet's unreserved love for both, never merge... The concept of Byzantium, as the second Rome, though, has not crystallized as clear and distinct in the poet's mind as that of the original Roman Empire. He loves Byzantine/Russia in its historical reality, refusing to admit its faults and contradictions, tending to glorify even such monsters as Ivan the Terrible, whose \"greatness\", he believes, will be \"recognised\" in due time. [...] There was also a kind of background theme in his earlier work, the pastoral pictures of beautiful Russian nature, which the poet had all the better reason to enjoy for being a devout fisherman.\nThe modernist critic Yuly Aykhenvald, analyzing the cliché formula that bonded \"Maykov, Polonsky and Fet\" into a solid group of similar-minded authors, alleged that Maykov \"to a lesser extent than the other two freed himself from the habit of copying classics\" and \"in his earlier works was unoriginal, producing verse that shone with reflected light.\" Not even his passionate love for classics could help the author submerge \"wholly into the pagan element,\" the critic opined.He was a scholar of antiquity and his gift, self-admittedly \"has been strengthened by being tempered in the fire of science.\" As a purveyor of classicism, his very soul was not deep or naive enough to fully let this spirit in or embrace the antique idea of intellectual freedom. Poems, inhabited by naiads, nymphs, muses and dryads, are very pretty, and you can't help being enchanted by these ancient fables. But he gives you no chance to forget for a moment that – what for his ancient heroes was life itself, for him is only a myth, a 'clever lie' he could never believe himself.\n\nAll Maykov's strong points, according to the critic, relate to the fact that he learned painting, and, in a way, extended the art into his poetry. Aykhenvald gives him unreserved credit for the \"plasticity of language, the unequalled turn at working on a phrase as if it was a tangible material.\" Occasionally \"his lines are so interweaved, the verse looks like a poetic calligraphy; a scripturam continuam... Rarely passionate and showing only distant echoes of original inspiration, Maykov's verse strikes you with divine shapeliness... Maykov's best poems resemble statues, driven to perfection with great precision and so flawless as to make a reader feel slightly guilty for their own imperfection, making them inadequate to even behold what's infinitely finer than themselves,\" the critic argued.\n\nAnother Silver Age critic who noticed how painting and fishing might have influenced Maykov's poetry was Innokenty Annensky. In his 1898 essay on Maykov he wrote: \"A poet usually chooses their own, particular method of communicating with nature, and often it is sports. Poets of the future might be cyclists or aeronauts. Byron was a swimmer, Goethe a skater, Lermontov a horse rider, and many other of our poets (Turgenev, both Tolstoys, Nekrasov, Fet, Yazykov) were hunters. Maykov was a passionate fisherman and this occupation was in perfect harmony with his contemplative nature, with his love for a fair sunny day which has such a vivid expression in his poetry.\"\nPutting Maykov into the \"masters of meditation\" category alongside Ivan Krylov and Ivan Goncharov, Annensky continued: \"He was one of those rare harmonic characters for whom seeking beauty and working upon its embodiments was something natural and easy, nature itself filling their souls with its beauty. Such people, rational and contemplative, have no need for stimulus, praise, strife, even fresh impressions... their artistic imagery growing as if from soil. Such contemplative poets produce ideas that are clear-cut and 'coined', their images are sculpture-like,\" the critic argued.\n\nAnnensky praised Maykov's gift for creating unusual combinations of colors, which was \"totally absent in Pushkin's verse, to some extent known to Lermontov, 'a poet of mountains and clouds' ...and best represented by the French poets Baudelaire and Verlaine.\" \"What strikes one is Maykov's poetry's extraordinary vigor, the freshness and firmness of the author's talent: Olympians and the heroes of Antiquity whom he befriended during his childhood years… must have shared with him their eternal youth,\" Annensky wrote.\n\nD. S. Mirsky called Maykov \"the most representative poet of the age,\" but added: \"Maykov was mildly 'poetical' and mildly realistic; mildly tendentious, and never emotional. Images are always the principal thing in his poems. Some of them (always subject to the restriction that he had no style and no diction) are happy discoveries, like the short and very well known poems on spring and rain. But his more realistic poems are spoiled by sentimentality, and his more 'poetic' poems hopelessly inadequate — their beauty is mere mid-Victorian tinsel. Few of his more ambitious attempts are successful.\"\n\nBy the mid-1850s Maykov had acquired the reputation of a typical proponent of the \"pure poetry\" doctrine, although his position was special. Yet, according to Pryima, \"Maykov was devoid of snobbishness and never saw himself occupying some loftier position even when mentioning 'crowds'. His need in communicating with people is always obvious (\"Summer Rain\", \"Haymaking\", \"Nights of Mowing\", \"The Naples Album\"). It's just that he failed to realize his potential as a 'people's poet' to the full.\" \"Maykov couldn't be seen as equal to giants like Pushkin, Lermontov, Koltsov, or Nekrasov,\" but still \"occupies a highly important place in the history of Russian poetry\" which he greatly enriched, the critic insisted.\n\nIn the years of Maykov's debut, according to Pryima, \"Russian poetry was still in its infancy... so even as an enlightener, Maykov with his encyclopedic knowledge of history and the way of approaching every new theme as a field for scientific research played an unparalleled role in the Russian literature of the time.\" \"His spectacular forays into the 'anthological' genre, as well as his translations of classics formed a kind of \"antique Gulf Stream\" which warmed up the whole of Russian literature, speeding its development,\" another researcher, F. F. Zelinsky, agreed. Maykov's best poems (\"To a Young Lady\", \"Haymaking\", \"Fishing\", \"The Wanderer\"), as well his as translations of the Slavic and Western poets and his poetic rendition of \"Slovo o Polku Igoreve\", belong to the Russian poetry classics, according to Pryima.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2090445", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2090445", "title": "Cypria", "text": "Cypria\n\nThe Cypria ( \"Kúpria\"; Latin: \"Cypria\") is a lost epic poem of ancient Greek literature, which has been attributed to Stasinus and was quite well known in classical antiquity and fixed in a received text, but which subsequently was lost to view. It was part of the Epic Cycle, which told the entire history of the Trojan War in epic hexameter verse. The story of the \"Cypria\" comes chronologically at the beginning of the Epic Cycle, and is followed by that of the \"Iliad\"; the composition of the two was apparently in the reverse order. The poem comprised eleven books of verse in epic dactylic hexameters.\n\nThe \"Cypria\", in the written form in which it was known in classical Greece, was probably composed in the late seventh century BC, but there is much uncertainty. The Cyclic Poets, as the translator of Homerica, Hugh G. Evelyn-White noted \"were careful not to trespass upon ground already occupied by Homer,\" one of the reasons for dating the final, literary form of \"Cypria\" as post-Homeric, in effect a \"prequel\". \"The author of the \"Kypria\" already regarded the \"Iliad\" as a text. Any reading of the \"Kypria\" will show it preparing for events for (specifically) the \"Iliad\" in order to refer back to them, for instance the sale of Lykaon to Lemnos or the kitting out of Achilles with Briseis and Agamemnon with Chryseis\". A comparison can be made with the \"Aethiopis\", also lost, but which even in its quoted fragments is more independent of the \"Iliad\" as text.\n\nThe stories contained in the \"Cypria\", on the other hand, were fixed much earlier than that, and the same problems of dating oral traditions associated with the Homeric epics also apply to the \"Cypria\". Many or all of the stories in the \"Cypria\" were known to the composer(s) of the \"Iliad\" and \"Odyssey\". The \"Cypria\", in presupposing an acquaintance with the events of the Homeric poem, in the received view thus formed a kind of introduction to the \"Iliad\" though there is an overlap in events from the death of Palamedes, including the catalogue of Trojan allies. J. Marks observes that \"Indeed, the junction would be seamless if the \"Kypria\" simply ended with the death of Palamedes.\"\n\nThe title \"Cypria\", associating the epic with Cyprus, demanded some explanation: the epic was said in one ancient tradition to have been given by Homer as a dowry to his son-in-law, a Stasinus of Cyprus mentioned in no other context; there was apparently an allusion to this in a lost Nemean ode by Pindar. Some later writers repeated the story. It did at least serve to explain why the \"Cypria\" was attributed by some to Homer and by others to Stasinus. Others, however, ascribed the poem to Hegesias (or Hegesinus) of Salamis in Cyprus or to Cyprias of Halicarnassus (see Cyclic Poets).\n\nIt is possible that the \"Trojan Battle Order\" (the list of Trojans and their allies, of \"Iliad\" 2.816-876, which forms an appendix to the \"Catalogue of Ships\") is abridged from that in the \"Cypria\", which was known to contain in its final book a list of the Trojan allies.\n\nIn current critical editions only about fifty lines survive of the \"Cypria\"'s original text, quoted by others. For the content we are almost entirely dependent on a prose summary of the Cyclic epics contained in the \"Chrestomathy\" attributed to an unknown \"Proclus\" (possibly to be identified with the 2nd-century AD grammarian Eutychius Proclus, or else with an otherwise unknown 5th-century grammarian). Many other passing references give further minor indications of the poem's storyline.\n\nWhat follows embeds reports of known content of the \"Cypria\" in a retelling of the known events leading up to the anger of Achilles.\n\nThe poem narrates the origins of the Trojan War and its first events. It begins with the decision of Zeus to relieve the Earth of the burden of population through war, a decision with familiar Mesopotamian parallels. The Theban war of the Seven ensues.\n\nThe \"Cypria\" described the wedding of Peleus and Thetis; in the Judgement of Paris among the goddesses Athena, Hera, and Aphrodite: Paris awards the prize for beauty to Aphrodite, and as a prize is awarded Helen, wife of Menelaus.\n\nThen Paris builds his ships at Aphrodite's suggestion, and Helenus foretells the future to him, and Aphrodite orders Aeneas to sail with him, while Cassandra prophesies the outcome. In Lacedaemon the Trojans are entertained by the sons of Tyndareus, Castor and Polydeuces, and by Menelaus, who then sets sail for Crete, ordering Helen to furnish the guests with all they require. Aphrodite brings Helen and Paris together, and he takes her and her dowry back to his home of Troy with an episode at Sidon, which Paris and his men successfully storm.\n\nIn the meantime Castor and Polydeuces, while stealing the cattle of Idas and Lynceus, are caught and killed: Zeus gives them immortality that they share every other day.\n\nIris informs Menelaus, who returns to plan an expedition against Ilium with his brother Agamemnon. They set out to assemble the former suitors of Helen, who had sworn an oath to defend the rights of whichever one won her hand. Nestor in a digression tells Menelaus how Epopeus was destroyed after seducing the daughter of Lycus, the story of Oedipus, the madness of Heracles, and the story of Theseus and Ariadne. In gathering the leaders, they detect Odysseus' feigned madness.\n\nThe assembled leaders offer ill-omened sacrifice at Aulis, where the prophet Calchas warns the Greeks that the war will last ten years. They reach the city of Teuthras in Mysia and sack it in error for Ilium: Telephus comes to the city's rescue and is wounded by Achilles. The fleet scattered by storm, Achilles puts in at Skyros and marries Deidameia, the daughter of Lycomedes, then heals Telephus, so that he might be their guide to Ilium.\n\nWhen the Achaeans have been mustered a second time at Aulis, Agamemnon is persuaded by Calchas to sacrifice his daughter Iphigenia to appease the goddess Artemis and obtain safe passage for the ships, after he offends her by killing a stag. Iphigeneia is fetched as though for marriage with Achilles.\nArtemis, however, snatches her away, substituting a deer on the altar, and transports her to the land of the Tauri, making her immortal.\n\nNext they sail as far as Tenedos, where while they are feasting, Philoctetes is bitten by a snake and is left behind in Lemnos. Here, too, Achilles quarrels with Agamemnon. A first landing at the Troad is repulsed by the Trojans, and Protesilaus is killed by Hector. Achilles then kills Cycnus, the son of Poseidon, and drives the Trojans back. The Greeks take up their dead and send envoys to the Trojans demanding the surrender of Helen and the treasure. The Trojans refusing, they first attempt an assault upon the city, and then lay waste the country round about.\n\nAchilles desires to see Helen, and Aphrodite and Thetis contrive a meeting between them. The Achaeans next desire to return home, but are restrained by\nAchilles, who afterwards drives off the cattle of Aeneas, sacks neighbouring cities, and kills Troilus. Patroclus carries away Lycaon to Lemnos and sells him as a slave, and out of the spoils Achilles receives Briseis as a prize, and Agamemnon Chryseis.\nThen follow the death of Palamedes, the plan of Zeus to relieve the Trojans by detaching Achilles from the Hellenic confederacy, and a catalogue of the Trojan allies.\n\nThe \"Cypria\" was considered to be a lesser work than Homer's two masterpieces: Aristotle criticised it for its lack of narrative cohesion and focus. It was rather a catalogue of events than a unified story.\n\n\n\n\n"}

He was also a member of the Roman Curia and held several other positions prior to his elevation to the cardinalate and patriarchate. La Fontaine remained a simple pastor at heart and was known for his gentleness and his welcoming nature as both a bishop and patriarch. He was supportive of some aspects of fascism though came to oppose it when he saw it was becoming a totalitarian regime. La Fontaine was viewed as \"papabile\" in the 1922 papal conclave that elected Pope Pius XI and was a serious contender for the papal see having garnered a great deal of votes until Cardinal Ratti's selection on the fourteenth ballot.\n\nHis cause of canonization commenced over three decades after his death and he has been titled as a Servant of God.\n\nPietro La Fontaine was born in 1860 in Viterbo as the second of five sons to Francesco La Fontaine and Maria Bianchini. His father was from Geneva in origins and had been a soldier in the papal guard turned watchmaker while his mother was the daughter of Giuseppe Bianchini who served as the administrator general of the properties of the Doria-Pamphili-Landi.\n\nHis initial education was spent under both the Brothers of the Christian Schools and later the Jesuits before he set himself on the ecclesial path. He studied for the priesthood in Viterbo since 1874 and was ordained as a priest on 22 December 1883 in the Viterbo Cathedral. He served as a parish priest until he was made a professor of literature and Sacred Scripture from 1882 to 1905 and also served as a spiritual director from 1893 until his appointment as a rector in 1896. In 1906 he served briefly as the cathedral canon and as a chaplain at the Gradi jail. Pope Pius X appointed him as the Bishop of Cassano all'Jonio and he received his episcopal consecration on 23 December 1906 in Rome at the Collegio Capranica chapel from Pietro Respighi with Antonio Maria Grasselli and Raffaele Virili serving as the co-consecrators. On 28 December 1908 an earthquake that had struck Messina and surrounding cities saw him open the doors to the episcopal palace for people to come. He aided the displaced and the wounded and tended to orphaned children.\n\nLa Fontaine was appointed later as the vicar for the Basilica of Saint John Lateran in 1908 and was later appointed as the Apostolic Administrator of San Marco e Brisignano in 1909 which had fallen vacant; it was his job to oversee the diocese until a replacement bishop was found. He was later appointed as the Titular Bishop of Caristo on 1 April 1910. In 1910 he was called to lead the Congregation of Rites but never held the title \"Prefect\" since the pope held that traditional title at that time.\n\nHe served as a consulter in a commission that the pope had established for the codification of the code of canon law. Pius X saw fit to name La Fontaine as the vicar for Saint Peter's Basilica on 2 April 1910 with La Fontaine participating in the pope's liturgical reform with a particular focus on the reform of breviaries.\n\nDuring World War I he refused to leave his archdiocese even during times of aerial bombardment. In November 1917 came eight hours of bombing which proved to be the fiercest night of Austrian-led attacks. He spent the entire night begging for relief from the Mother of God and vowed he would build a temple in her honor if Venice was spared from further bombings.\n\nIn 1915 he was appointed and installed as the Patriarch of Venice and Pope Benedict XV elevated him to the cardinalate on 4 December 1916 as the Cardinal-Priest of Santi Nereo ed Achilleo; he received the red hat and title on 7 December. La Fontaine's title was later changed to Cardinal-Priest of Ss. XII Apostoli on 7 March 1921.\n\nLa Fontaine participated in the papal conclave in 1922 that elected Pope Pius XI and was himself viewed as \"papabile\" for his pastoral qualities. The German cardinals met just after the conclave opened before retiring for the evening after having deliberated and settling on voting for La Fontaine as their second choice if Pietro Gasparri withdrew his candidature. In the first two ballots he received four votes and had been perceived as both a conservative and compromise candidate; but it became clear that he was no compromise but rather a serious contender. He received nine votes in a later ballot with the sudden shift being seen as Willem Marinus van Rossum losing his four votes to the patriarch. La Fontaine secured seven votes in a later ballot before Cardinal del Val urged his supporters to follow La Fontaine; it led to him securing 13 votes at the fifth ballot.\n\nThe patriarch secured 22 votes in the seventh ballot though dropped to 21 votes in the eighth due to a cardinal switching his vote for the Archbishop of Milan Achille Ratti who was emerging as a possible candidate He secured 18 votes on the ninth ballot on 5 February but dropped to eight in the tenth. He secured 23 votes in the ballot afterward and then 22 in the final ballot before dinner. The cardinal secured 18 votes in the 13th ballot but it was Achille Ratti who was elected as Pope Pius XI.\n\nHe served as a member of the Congregation for the Oriental Churches and served as a papal legate to the centennial celebrations of Dante Alighieri in Ravenna on 13 September 1921. He was also the papal legate to the Eucharistic Congress in Chioggia on 15 September 1923 as well as to the Regional Eucharistic Congress in Ancona (1927) and the National Eucharistic Congress in Vienna (30 August 1933). On 22 April 1924 he was granted the Constantinian Order of Saint George. He was frugal in his outlook and before he died sold his gondola hoping the funds collected would be used for the poor while eschewing heating in the patriarchal palace during the cold winter months. La Fontaine had supported some aspects of fascism at its outset though came to oppose it when he saw that it was changing the Italian nation into a totalitarian regime that was encroaching on Church rights and the rights of people.\n\nLa Fontaine died on 9 July 1935 at 10:00am from arteriosclerosis and he had been ill since the beginning of that month so had moved to Treviso hoping to recover. He had suffered from diabetes in his later life. Four archbishops and 12 bishops as well as some regional senators attended his 12 July funeral which ended with him being interred in Lido in a chapel he had commissioned himself. His remains were transferred on 8 July 1959 into the Basilica of Saint Mark in the sarcophagus that was once intended for his future successor Angelo Giuseppe Roncalli, who had become Pope John XXIII.\n\nThe cause for his beatification was opened on 22 February 1960 (in a local investigation) under his third successor Giovanni Urbani. Theologians assessed his writings and approved them on 10 November 1971 after asserting his writings were in line with doctrine and contained no errors that would impede the beatification process. The informative process of investigation received validation from the Congregation for the Causes of Saints on 11 March 1988.\n\nThe current postulator for this cause is Dr. Andrea Ambrosi.\n\n"}

Because early film was largely restricted to using daylight, Horsley relocated his production company to Hollywood in 1911, taking Rosher with him, and opened the first movie studio there. This made Rosher the first full-time cameraman in Hollywood.\n\nIn 1913 he went to Mexico to film newsreel footage of Pancho Villa's rebellion. In 1918, he was one of the founders of the American Society of Cinematographers and served as the group's first Vice-President. In the 1920s, he was one of the more sought-after cinematographers in Hollywood, and a personal favorite of stars such as Mary Pickford, working with her on films such as \"Suds\" (1920), \"Little Annie Rooney\" (1925), and even \"Coquette\" (1929), Pickford's first sound film. His work with Karl Struss on F.W. Murnau's 1927 film \"\" is viewed as a milestone in cinematography. He shot five films for producer David O. Selznick, including \"Rockabye\" (1932), \"Our Betters\" (1933) and \"Little Lord Fauntleroy\" (1936).\n\nRosher worked at several studios, but spent the last 12 years of his career exclusively at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, photographing such films as \"Annie Get Your Gun\", \"Show Boat\", \"Kiss Me Kate\", and \"The Yearling\". \n\nRosher was the father of actress Joan Marsh and cinematographer Charles Rosher, Jr.\n\nRosher died of an accidental fall in Lisbon, Portugal on January 15, 1974. He was 88.\n\n\nIn addition, Rosher received two Eastman Medals (named for George Eastman), \"Photoplay\" magazine's Gold Medal, and the only fellowship awarded by the Society of Motion Picture Engineers.\n\n"}

It may also be known as a hemostatic (also spelled hæmostatic) agent.\n\nA styptic (also spelled stiptic) is a specific type of antihemorrhagic agent that works by contracting tissue to seal injured blood vessels. Styptic are also referred to as local hemostatics. Styptic pencils contain astringents.\n\nAntihemorrhagic agents used in medicine have various mechanisms of action:\n\nHemostatic agents are used during surgical procedures to achieve hemostasis and are categorized as hemostats, sealants and adhesives. They vary based on their mechanism of action, composition, ease of application, adherence to tissue, immunogenicity and cost. These agents permit rapid hemostasis, better visualization of the surgical area, shorter operative times, decreased requirement for transfusions, decreased wound healing time and overall improvement in patient recovery time.\n\nThere are several classes of antihemorrhagic drugs used in medicine. These include antifibrinolytics, blood coagulation factors, fibrinogen, and vitamin K.\n\nTopical hemostatic agents have been gaining popularity for use in emergency bleeding control, especially in military medicine. They are available in two forms—as a granular powder poured on wounds, or embedded in a dressing.\n\nMicrofibrillar collagen hemostat (MCH) is a topical agent composed of resorbable microfibrillar collagen. It attracts platelets and allows for the formation of a blood clot when it comes into contact with blood. Unlike the hemostatic clamp, no mechanical action is involved. The surgeon presses the MCH against a bleeding site, and the collagen attracts and helps with the clotting process to eventually stop bleeding.\n\nThe practical application for MCH is different from that of the hemostatic clamp.\n\nChitosan hemostats are topical agents composed of chitosan and its salts. Chitosan bonds with platelets and red blood cells to form a gel-like clot which seals a bleeding vessel. Unlike other hemostat technologies its action does not require the normal hemostatic pathway and therefore continues to function even when anticoagulants like heparin are present.\n\nChitosan is used in some emergency hemostats which are designed to stop traumatic life-threatening bleeding. Their use is well established in many military and trauma units.\n\nKaolin and zeolite activate the coagulation cascade, and have been used as the active component of hemostatic dressings (for example, in QuikClot).\n\nStyptics cause hemostasis by contracting blood vessels.\n\nA common delivery system for this is a styptic or hemostatic pencil (not to be confused with a caustic pencil). This is a short stick of medication. Anhydrous aluminium sulfate is the main ingredient and acts as a vasoconstrictor in order to disable blood flow. The stick is applied directly to the bleeding site. The high ionic strength promotes flocculation of the blood, and the astringent chemical causes local vasoconstriction. Before safety razors were invented, it was a standard part of a shaving kit and was used to seal shaving cuts. Some people continue to use styptic pencils for minor skin wounds from safety or electric razors.\n\nStyptic powder is used in the veterinary trade to stop bleeding from nails that are clipped too closely. This powder is generally used on animals, such as cats, dogs, and rabbits, whose vein is found in the center of the nail.\n\n"}

She co-founded Cisco Systems, and used the money from its sale to pursue interests in animal welfare and women's writing. One of her main projects, Chawton House, is in England, but most of her work remains in the United States.\n\nLerner is a northern California native. She received her bachelor's degree in 1975 in international relations from California State University, Chico, a master's degree in econometrics in 1977 from the Claremont Graduate School, and a master's degree in statistics and computer science in 1981 from Stanford University.\n\nIn 1984, while working as director of computer facilities for the Stanford University Graduate School of Business, Lerner co-founded Cisco Systems with her then-partner and now-former husband Len Bosack. Lerner and Bosack worked with Stanford students and faculty on a project to better connect all of the school's computer systems. They later adapted software used at Stanford into what would become the foundation for Cisco IOS.\n\nLerner told the story of Cisco's startup on the podcast How I Built This in which Cisco's early days involved building routers in the living room, financing the business using credit cards. She emphasized the collaborative nature of the work and that despite communication protocols being public domain, developed largely from collaborative work at Stanford, Cisco was still able to produce products people wanted to buy.\n\nLerner and Bosack brought in John Morgridge to be the third CEO of Cisco in 1988. On August 28, 1990, Lerner was fired; upon hearing the news, Bosack resigned in solidarity. The two sold all of their stock for $170 million and retired from Cisco. Lerner and Bosack divorced in the early 1990s.\n\nIn 1996, Lerner purchased Ayrshire Farm, an estate in Upperville Virginia. The circa-1912, 42-room Edwardian mansion of native fieldstone has since been restored and was used for a variety of social functions under Lerner's direction. Ayrshire Farm's mission has been to farm sustainably and profitably, promoting the benefits of locally produced, humanely-raised meats and organic produce to the consumer, the community, and children through education, outreach and example. The farm was the first in Virginia to meet both Certified Humane and Certified Organic standards.\n\nLerner placed a portion of her stock earnings into a start-up venture capital limited partnership called \"& Capital Partners.\" One of the companies it funded was Urban Decay Cosmetics, with the tag line \"does pink make you puke?\" In February 2000, Moet-Hennessy Louis Vuitton (LVMH), the French luxury goods conglomerate, acquired the firm. It was spun off from LVMH in December 2002. \n\nLerner also owns Hunter's Head Tavern in Upperville, Virginia and Gentle Harvest in Marshall, Virginia.\n\nIn 1992, through the foundation she shares with Leonard Bosack, Lerner invested money into the restoration of the Chawton House, which was once owned by Jane Austen's brother, Edward Austen Knight. In 2003, it opened as the Centre for the Study of Early Women's Writing, 1600–1830. In 2016, Lerner resigned from the board of trustees and withdrew the financial support of her foundation.\n\nIn November 2011, Lerner published a sequel to Jane Austen's \"Pride and Prejudice\" titled \"Second Impressions\" using the pen name of Ava Farmer (for \"a Virginia farmer\"). In August 2017, Lerner released \"Caticons\", a book of art imitating cats. Cat news website, \"The Purrington Post\" said that the book was a \"Must have\" for cat lovers.\n\nLerner was awarded an honorary degree in 2005 from Southampton University and a Doctor of Sciences in 2012 from California State University, Chico.\n\nIn 2009, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Computer Society honored Sandra Lerner and Leonard Bosack with its Computer Entrepreneur Award \"for founding Cisco Systems and pioneering and advancing the commercialization of routing technology and the profound changes this technology enabled in the computer industry.\"\n\nIn 1998, Lerner was featured in part 2 of the PBS documentary \"Nerds 2.0.1\". Lerner was also featured in the documentary film \"Something Ventured\" (2011).\n\nIn November 2014, Lerner was presented with the Pioneer Award for her work in the technology field by Women's Entrepreneurship Day.\n\nIn 2015, Lerner was presented with an honorary OBE by the Lord Lieutenant of Hampshire, Nigel Atkinson, for her contributions to UK culture.

This matches Saxon and Hibernian tradition.\n\nBecause of its association with the southern part of the United States, \"Bubba\" is also often used outside the South as a pejorative to mean a person of low economic status and limited education. \"Bubba\" may also be taken to mean one who is a \"good ol' boy\". At times, it may be used as a term of endearment (or in an insulting sense) for a person, especially to a man, who is either overweight or has a seemingly powerful large body frame. \n\nIn the US Army and Marines, \"Bubba\" can mean a lay soldier, similar to \"grunt\", but with connotations of endearment instead of derision (e.g., \"Can you make that device easier to work with, because every Bubba is going to have to use it?\").\n\nThe word exists in other languages and carries similar meanings. \"Bubba\" is common in Australia and New Zealand as a noun to refer affectionately to a baby.\n\nIn gun culture, \"Bubba\" is a term used for a person who permanently alters or modifies historic firearms, with no regard for its historical value.\n\nIn Yiddish, the word \"Bobe\" [with a vowel similar to a shortened version of the vowel of \"caught\" + \"beh\"] means \"grandmother\" and as a form of address, is often rendered by English speakers as \"Bubba\" or \"Bubbie\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Because the United States Postal Service post office in Beverly Hills serves the neighborhood, residents have a Beverly Hills mailing address and Zip code 90210, while other wealthy neighborhoods Bel Air and Holmby Hills have Los Angeles mailing addresses. While the Beverly Hills connection makes BHPO—about one third the size of the city—attractive, land is available in larger sizes, and with lower prices, better views, and more seclusion, than in Beverly Hills itself.\n\nThe \"Los Angeles Times\" wrote in 2004, \"When Beverly Hills was incorporated in 1914, the northern border was roughly a mile north of Sunset Boulevard, with the exception of Trousdale Estates. The remaining section stretching north to Mulholland Drive was left as part of the hills of Los Angeles, where it remained anonymous for decades\". The Beverly Hills post office began serving BHPO, then the Doheny Ranch, in the 1920s. By the 1940s people bought BHPO homes because they were less expensive than in Beverly Hills, despite higher property taxes. In 1963, the area was included within the 90210 ZIP Code, which also covers the northern part of Beverly Hills. 1978 California Proposition 13 equalized property taxes, making BHPO more attractive.\n\nThe ZIP Code 90210 is still handled by the Beverly Hills Main Post Office.

The dam's purpose includes flood mitigation, irrigation, water supply and hydro-electric power generation. The dam impounds Lake Burrendong and is filled by the waters from the Macquarie, and Cudgegong rivers as well as Meroo Creek.\n\nThe idea of building the dam arose in 1909. However, it was not until 1946 until legislation was passed to construct the dam. Construction commenced in 1950. The town of Mumbil expanded to accommodate the workers building the dam. The dam was completed in April 1965 and water began to flow into it for the first time. It was officially opened on 18 August 1967 by Robert Askin, the Premier of New South Wales. The date was chosen because it was the sesquicentenary of the town of Wellington.

{"id": "2090685", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2090685", "title": "Siheyuan", "text": "Siheyuan\n\nA siheyuan is a historical type of residence that was commonly found throughout China, most famously in Beijing and rural Shanxi. Throughout Chinese history, the siheyuan composition was the basic pattern used for residences, palaces, temples, monasteries, family businesses, and government offices. In ancient times, a spacious siheyuan would be occupied by a single, usually large and extended family, signifying wealth and prosperity. Today, remaining siheyuan are often still used as subdivided housing complexes, although many lack modern amenities.\n\"Siheyuan\" refers to a courtyard surrounded by buildings on all four sides. It also appears in English translation as and, less often, as .\n\nSiheyuan dates back as early as the Western Zhou period, and has a history of over 2,000 years. They exhibit outstanding and fundamental characteristics of Chinese architecture. They exist all across China and are the template for most Chinese architectural styles. Siheyuan also serves as a cultural symbol of Beijing and a window into its old ways of life.\n\nModern Beijing's population boom has made housing one of city's biggest challenges. Siheyuan today are typically used as housing complexes, hosting multiple families, with courtyards being developed to provide extra living space. The living conditions in many siheyuan are quite poor, with very few having private toilets. In the 1990s, systematic demolition of old urban buildings took place in Beijing under rapid economic development. Many siheyuan are being torn down to address the problem of overcrowding, and have been replaced by modern apartment blocks.\n\nAccording to the Beijing Municipal Administration of Cultural Heritage, there are over 500 historic courtyards preserved in the Cultural and Historical Conservation Areas as important cultural monuments. Many of these are public museums, and preserved historical siheyuans include Lu Xun Memorial, Guo Moruo Memorial, Mao Dun Memorial, Mei Lanfang Memorial, Lao She Memorial and many others. A study by the United Nations Human Settlements Programme in 2008 estimates that there are still about 400,000 residential courtyards remaining in Beijing. The sales market of siheyuan has also been booming in recent years. A report in 2005 finds there are usually around 7,000 to 9,000 residential siheyuans that are on the market for sale, and many are generally priced at 7,000 to 10,000 yuan per square meter. However, the prices vary based on the area and the market. For residential siheyuans in the Dongcheng and Xicheng districts in 2009, the prices can go up to 40,000 yuan per square meter. For siheyuans near the Houhai and Shichahai area, the prices can go up to between 100,000 and 150,000 yuan per square meter. A 2,000 square meter siheyuan near the Shichahai area was sold for 40 million yuan ($6 million) in 2005.\n\nThe four buildings of a siheyuan are normally positioned along the north-south and east-west axis. The building positioned to the north and facing the south is considered the main house (正房 zhèng-fáng). The buildings adjoining the main house and facing east and west are called side houses (廂房 xiāng-fáng). The northern, eastern and western buildings are connected by beautifully decorated pathways (抄手游廊 chāo-shǒu-yóu-láng). These passages serve as shelters from the sunshine during the day, and provide a cool place to appreciate the view of the courtyard at night. The building that faces north is known as the opposite house (倒座房 dào-zuò-fáng). Behind the northern building, there would often be a separate backside building (后罩房 hòu-zhào-fáng), the only place where two-story buildings are allowed to be constructed for the traditional siheyuan.\n\nThe entrance gate, usually painted vermilion and with copper door knockers on it, is usually at the southeastern corner. Normally, there is a screen wall () inside the gate, for privacy; superstition holds that it also protects the house from evil spirits. A pair of stone lions are often placed outside the gate. Some large siheyuan compounds would have two or more layers of courtyards and even private gardens attached to them. Such is a sign of wealth and status in ancient times.\n\nThe courtyard dwellings were built according to the traditional concepts of the five elements that were believed to compose the universe, and the eight diagrams of divination. The gate was made at the southeast corner which was the “wind” corner, and the main house was built on the north side which was believed to belong to “water”, an element to prevent fire.\n\nThe layout of a simple courtyard represents traditional Chinese morality and Confucian ethics. In Beijing, four buildings in a single courtyard receive different amounts of sunlight. The northern main building receives the most, thus serving as the living room and bedroom of the owner or head of the family. The eastern and western side buildings receive less, and serve as the rooms for children or less important members of the family. The southern building receives the least sunlight, and usually functions as a reception room and the servants' dwelling, or where the family would gather to relax, eat or study. The backside building is for unmarried daughters and female servants: because unmarried girls were not allowed direct exposure to the public, they occupied the most secluded building in the siheyuan.\n\nA more detailed and further stratified Confucian order was followed in ancient China. The main house in the north was assigned to the eldest member of the family, i.e. the head of the family, usually grandparents. If the main house had enough rooms, a central room would serve as a shrine for ancestral worship. When the head of the household had concubines, the wife would reside in the room to the eastern end of the main house, while the concubines would reside in the room to the western end of the main house. The eldest son of the family and his wife would reside in the eastern side house, while the younger son and his wife would reside in the western side house. If a grandson was fully grown, he would reside in the opposite house in the south. Unmarried daughters would always reside in the backside building behind the main house.\n\nWhen a funeral is held in a siheyuan, the location of the casket depends on the status of the deceased, but all caskets are oriented so that the head of the deceased points south while the feet point north. If the deceased is the head of the household or his wife, then the casket would be on the center line in the main house. If the deceased was the concubine of the head of the household, her casket would remain in the main house, but could not be in the center. If the deceased is a younger male, then his casket is placed on the center line of the courtyard. If the deceased is a younger female, her casket is placed in the courtyard but cannot be on the center line.\n\nThough from antiquity, a siheyuan is a practically sound, engineered structure. Northwestern walls are usually higher than the other walls to protect the inside buildings from the harsh winds blowing across northern China in the winter. Eaves curve downward, so that rainwater will flow along the curve rather than dropping straight down. The rooftop is ridged to provide shade in the summer while retaining warmth in the winter.\n\nA siheyuan offers space, comfort, quiet and privacy. Siheyuan walls provide security as well as protection against dust and storms. With plants, rocks, and flowers, the yard is also a garden, and acts like an open-air living room. The veranda divides the courtyard into several big and small spaces that are not very distant from each other. Family members talked with each other here, creating a cordial atmosphere.\n\nA number of Western ex-pats living in pre-WWII Beijing extolled the virtues of the siheyuan for an English-speaking audience. Among them were photographer Hedda Morrison, writer Harold Acton, and chronicler and sinologist George N. Kates.\n\nIn Gansu, Qinghai and other northwest regions, where dust storms are very strong, courtyard walls tend to be higher. The shapes of siheyuan are also altered: in northwestern China, the north-south span of a siheyuan is generally much longer than the east-west span, while in other provinces such as Sichuan, the opposite is true. In southern China, the houses are built with multiple stories. In the northeast, land is abundant but the weather is cold, so courtyards are built broad and large to increase the exposure to sunlight, and there are more open areas inside the walls.\n\nRecently, a modern version of \"siheyuan\" has been developed as a villa product in large scale planned residential communities of China.

Composed, arranged and recorded by Paul Giovanni and Magnet, it contains folk songs performed by characters in the film (including some by members of the cast). For example, Lesley Mackie, who plays the character of Daisy in the film, sings the opening song, and various others in the CD Soundtrack. \n\nThe songs were arranged to hint at a pre-Christian pagan European culture and vary between traditional songs, original Giovanni compositions and even nursery rhyme in \"Baa, Baa, Black Sheep\". Musicians forming the folk band in the film included Michael Cole (Bassoon and concertina) and Ian Cutler (Violin). This mix of songs contributes to the film's atmosphere, contrasting rabble-rousing songs that depict the island's community like \"The Landlord's Daughter\" and the child-sung \"Maypole\" with the sinister \"Fire Leap\" and the erotic \"Willow's Song\" before culminating in the islanders' rendition of the Middle English \"Sumer Is Icumen In\".\n\nThe opening music and \"Corn Rigs\" are arrangements of the Robert Burns ballads \"The Highland Widow's Lament\" and \"Rigs O' Barley\", respectively. The instrumental parts of the score are based on traditional Scottish, Irish, and English tunes such as \"Miri it is\" the oldest surviving middle English song fragment, the \"Struan Robertson's Rant\" strathspey (plays while Sgt. Howie searches the ship for Rowan), the \"Tenpenny Bit\" jig (Plays while Lord Summerisle and MacGregor prepare for the festivities), and \"Drowsy Maggie\" reel (plays while Sgt. Howie searches a house for Rowan). \"Chop Chop\" is based on the nursery rhyme \"Oranges and Lemons\". \"Procession\" is an arrangement of the tune of the Child Ballad \"Fause Foodrage\". The psychedelic guitar solo which plays while Sgt. Howie is looking for Rowan, on the track \"Searching for Rowan,\" is based on the melody of the Jacobite song \"Hey, Johnnie Cope, are Ye Waking Yet?\". Although some of the music is Scottish, and the film is set in the Hebrides, no traditional Scottish Gaelic numbers are featured.\n\nThe soundtrack was unavailable until a 1998 release on Trunk Records of a mono album dubbed from the music and effects tapes at Pinewood, from the shorter original cut of the film (hence missing the song \"Gently Johnny\"). It was not until 2002 that Silva Screen Records released a stereo version using cues from the tape held by Gary Carpenter, mixed with recordings from the first Trunk Records release. This release includes \"Gently Johnny\" and the missing lines from \"Willow's Song\".\n\nA sheet music album of the soundtrack is also available, published by Summerisle Songs. Titled \"The Wicker Man Complete Piano Songbook\" the book features all the songs and music from the film, arranged for piano, voice and guitar.\n\nJason Nickey, reviewing the album for \"Allmusic\" picked \"Gently Johnny\", \"Maypole\" and \"Willow's Song\" as highlights. \"Paul Giovanni, together with Magnet,\" he writes, \"uses flutes, lyres, harmonicas, and guitars in a mixture of original and traditional material to create a mysterious and sinister world that comes to life apart from the film.\" Chris Jones wrote for \"BBC\" that just as the \"cult\" film \"has now been rightly placed in the pantheon of great celluloid [...] its soundtrack deserves the same accolades.\" He notes that the \"lilting (how come folk is always lilting?) melodies of numbers like \"Corn Rigs\", \"Gently Johnny\" and \"Willow's Song\" are stuffed with a vaguely sinister eroticism, reflecting Woodward's unease as he scratches the tranquil surface of the island community to discover its sinister secret.\" \"Maybe it takes a foreigner to get to the dark heart of much of our indigenous music,\" he concludes, \"but it's a darkness suffused with beauty. Coupled to the original incidental music [...] this is a vital document of a time when the UK could still produce classic cinema. It's also a really fine album.\" TightPurpleShirt reviewed the 1998 version of the album for \"Head Heritage\" and called it an \"incredible soundtrack\", despite criticizing the exclusion of \"Gently Johnny\". He notes that the tracks \"cover everything from traditional folk music, performed by MAGNET [...] Some very, very surreal sound effect sequences and some mildly psyche [sic] guitar work [.T]here is also a track called Hum which if extended across a whole CD could be marketed by any number of drone groups as their best album to date. The whole things a head fuk [sic] from start to finish and its glorious.\" \n\nIn 2013, \"Spin\" ranked the soundtrack 11th on their list of \"40 Movie Soundtracks That Changed Alternative Music\", writing: \"The soundtrack from American songwriter Paul Giovanni reveled in the British folk idiom that bands like Pentangle had revitalized, weaving together standards as well as \"Baa Baa Black Sheep,\" no doubt influencing freak-folkers like Devendra Banhart and Joanna Newsom. Yet for all its pastoral sounds, there was an uncanny eeriness lurking at the edges, a childlike innocence mixed with malice, anticipating the aesthetics of both Animal Collective and Broadcast.\"\n\nSome of the songs (most notably \"Willow's Song\") have been covered by contemporary artists, such as the Nature and Organisation, Mediæval Bæbes, Doves, Faith and the Muse, Isobel Campbell and the Sneaker Pimps.\n\nA live performance of the soundtrack at the 30th annual Brosella Folk Festival in Brussels, on 8 July 2006, underlined the cult status of the film and its music. The organizers were looking for something to mark three decades of the festival and as such, for the final act of the evening, they assembled \"The Wicker Band\". This ensemble included many eminent performers from the thriving Flemish folk-rock scene, as well as the singer Jacqui McShee, founding member and continual reviver of the 1960s folk-jazz band Pentangle, and fellow ex-Pentangle member Danny Thompson. The band performed music from the film, plus a few selected songs from the folk and singer-songwriter repertoire that seemed to fit the mood before, shortly after midnight, the director's cut of the film was shown on a giant screen.\n"}

The version of the show at Universal Studios Hollywood closed in 2012, and the version at Universal Studios Florida closed on October 8, 2017.\n\nThe attraction is a mini-sequel to \"\" and reunites director James Cameron and the main cast from the movie, including Arnold Schwarzenegger as The Terminator, Linda Hamilton as Sarah Connor, Edward Furlong as John Connor, and Robert Patrick as the T-1000. The show was presented in two parts; a pre-show where a Cyberdyne Systems company hostess shows guests a brief video presentation about the company's innovations, and the main show, where live performers interact with a 3D film.\n\nThe attraction was originally developed for Universal Studios Florida, with producers pushing for a second installation in Universal Studios Hollywood during development. The original attraction cost a total of $60 million. With a total run time of 12 minutes, the film alone cost $24 million, making it one of the most expensive films per minute in the world. The attraction opened in the Hollywood area of Universal Studios Florida on April 27, 1996, to very positive reviews. Additional venues were later announced for Universal Studios Hollywood and Universal Studios Japan.\n\nConstruction for the Hollywood venue forced the closure of Fievel's Playland and An American Tail Theatre, which were built atop a parking structure. The attraction opened on the Upper Lot of Universal Studios Hollywood on May 6, 1999. In the year of the attraction's opening, attendance at Universal Studios Hollywood remained steady at 5.1 million; however, other parks in the region saw declines in revenue, such as Disneyland which experienced a 5% drop. \"The Terminator\" stage was subsequently used for the annual Halloween Horror Nights event, with \"The Rocky Horror Picture Show: A Tribute\" being shown in 2009.\n\nAt Universal Studios Japan, the attraction was added as one of the debut attractions in the New York section of the park. It opened to the public on March 31, 2001. California-based firm Technifex provided special effects and show equipment for the attraction.\n\nIn late 2012, Universal Studios Hollywood announced that their version would close on December 31, 2012. It was later announced Despicable Me Minion Mayhem would replace the attraction. On September 7, 2017, Universal Studios Florida announced their version would close on October 8, 2017.\n\nOn October 15, 2019 Universal Studios Florida announced that a new Jason Bourne themed show named \"The Bourne Stuntacular\" would debut in spring 2020.\n\nThe queue features dozens of television monitors that show a series of video segments (which are being presented on the \"Cyberdyne Interactive Network,\" or C.I.N.) about the latest innovations and products of Cyberdyne Systems. The video also includes several special musical segments, including two songs from the film; \"Bad to the Bone\" and \"Guitars, Cadillacs\", as well as a \"live\" video feed from Costa Rica of a performance of the song La Bamba. Mixed into the video cycle are live images of the waiting audience (in the manner of a closed-circuit security system) and two brief comical sketches of \"guests\" running afoul of Cyberdyne security – either being electrocuted by a security device or being arrested by security staff. Just before entering the pre-show auditorium, guests pass an unmanned kiosk where they pick up a pair of \"safety visors\" (3D glasses) for use during the main show.\n\nThe pre-show is hosted in the \"Miles Bennett Dyson Memorial Auditorium\" by Kimberley Duncan, Cyberdyne's Director of Community Relations and Media Control. Here, the audience stands and views a promotional video about Cyberdyne's numerous technological contributions before the video feed is temporarily hijacked by John (Edward Furlong) and Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton), warning the audience about Skynet and the future war against the machines and telling them to get out of the building before they are cut off. As the video continues, Duncan can be seen talking on a phone, telling someone on the other line to find the Connors. Once the video ends, Duncan tells the audience to ignore the Connors' warnings and proceed forward.\n\nThe promotional video in the pre-show was updated in 2015 as some of the original pre-show featured \"future\" technologies that were now in existence; new CGI and narration now accompanied the remastered original footage alongside some newly-shot scenes.\n\nGuests are ushered from the pre-show auditorium into a large theater that seats 700 where they are to see a demonstration of Cyberdyne's newest creation, the \"Cyberdyne Series 70 Autonomous Infantry Unit\" (T-70 Terminators). Once guests are seated, they are told to put on their \"safety visors\" to watch a demonstration of the T-70 Terminators in action presented by Duncan. After this brief demonstration, John and Sarah arrive and disrupt the proceedings. After disabling the security alarms, they force Duncan to shut the T-70s. However, they are confronted by a T-1000 Terminator (Robert Patrick) from the future whom they engage with automatic-weapons. Duncan is killed by the T-1000 while attempting to stop him, mistaking him as a police officer. A T-800 Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger) bursts through the movie screen through a \"time portal\" on his signature Harley-Davidson motorcycle – via actual actor/stunt double riding into auditorium – to rescue John. He takes John back through the portal and into the future war between humans and machines while Sarah stays behind in the present, with the T-1000 in pursuit. After defeating him, John and T-800 make their way across the war-ravaged landscape as they head towards Skynet. Along the way, they are chased by a flying Hunter-Killer, four Mini-Hunters, and a Terminator endoskeleton.\n\nThe duo successfully penetrate the Skynet facility and descend with the audience into Skynet's Central Core, where they battle the \"T-1000000\", a giant liquid-metal spider-like construct similar to a very large T-1000. The T-800 sends John to a nearby time machine that will take him back to the present while he stays behind to blow up Skynet and the T-1000000. The show ends with the ground-shaking destruction of Skynet, leaving Sarah and John alone in the present time once again. During the destruction of the T-1000000, water is sprayed from the ceiling onto the riders and then during the explosion, smoke is blown into the audience; the seats of the auditorium also lurch with a sudden drop, giving guests a final scare. Sarah finishes the show by saying that she feels that she owes her life to the Terminator for saving John's life. During this narration, the face of a Terminator endoskeleton fills the screen, morphing into Schwarzenegger's face before the film fades to black, during which John and Sarah mysteriously disappear.\n\nThe initial planning for \"T2 3-D: Battle Across Time\" began in the early 1990s. Jay Stein, Universal Parks & Resorts' Chairman and CEO at the time, asked Gary Goddard and his team at Landmark Entertainment to develop a stunt show based around the Terminator franchise. Goodard sought permission from MCA Planning and Development (later Universal Creative) to morph this concept into a theater-based presentation featuring a 3-D film, live action and pyrotechnics. After a year-and-a-half of development, MCA Planning and Development and Landmark Entertainment approached James Cameron's Lightstorm Entertainment for ultimate approval. Although Cameron was originally against the idea of Universal taking his Terminator franchise and converting it into a ride, he found the storyboards and the whole concept to be \"great\", so the project was green-lit.\n\nA full-scale mock-up duplicating the dimensions of the planned Florida venue was created in an airplane hangar at the Van Nuys Airport in the San Fernando Valley. The set consists of a stage surrounded by a triptych of adjoined silver screens. Each of these three screens measured . A total of six Iwerks projectors were used to run the 3-D, 70mm film simultaneously at 30 frames per second. Several elements of \"T2 3-D: Battle Across Time\" have been patented by Universal, including the seat drop effect, the blending of live action and film, the trio of projection screens, and the simulated assault weapons.\n\nThe film was shot at the abandoned Eagle Mountain iron ore mine, just north of Desert Center in California. The cast and crew from the first two Terminator films returned for the shoot, including Arnold Schwarzenegger as The Terminator, Linda Hamilton as Sarah Connor, Robert Patrick as T-1000, and Edward Furlong as John Connor. To achieve the 3-D effect on a 70mm projected film, a two-camera rig weighing was used.\n\nAs a sequel to , \"T2 3-D: Battle Across Time\" introduced two new Terminator characters. The first is the Cyberdyne's latest invention, the T-1000000. It is a large spider-like version of the T-1000 that defends Skynet's CPU from attack. Like the T-1000, it is made of mimetic polyalloy, allowing it to form its legs into stabbing weapons. The only known T-1000000 was destroyed when Skynet's core was destroyed.\n\nThe demonstration featured as the premise for the film involves several large practical effects robots called T-70s, designed as mechanical soldiers, with large miniguns on their arms. They are the earliest terminator models shown to have a humanoid form with arms and legs, and are a direct predecessor to Schwarzenegger's T-800. The T-70s stand tall and line the walls of the arena.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2090731", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2090731", "title": "Bashguard", "text": "Bashguard\n\nA bashguard is a device used on bicycles to protect components, usually the drivetrain, from damage in the case of a strike with an object, whether intentional or in a crash. There are two types, bashrings and bashplates.\n\nIn cycling, bashrings are a protective ring, often made of aluminium or polycarbonate, mounted on the outer part of the chainrings on mountain bikes.\n\nThey are commonly used on downhill and freeride bikes to protect the chain and chainring in cases of it hitting rocks and other obstacles. The position of the chainring makes it particularly susceptible to rock strikes in this kind of riding.\n\nThey are also often used on trials bikes for a similar purpose–to protect the chain and chainring–although they are often used as a tool to get up and over obstacles. It is for this reason that a lot of bashrings aimed at trials riding have a tooth-like profile. They are also used for landing on a log, so are generally wider than those used for downhill and freeride.\n\nFinally, bashrings are used a lot on street bikes, where they are used to protect the chain and chainring when grinding obstacles, and again in the case of a crash.\n\nA bashplate is a device used most often on Mod-class trials bikes, again to protect the chain and chainring. This device, however, is attached to the frame rather than to the crankset. Being more central on the bike (and generally far wider) means that balancing on this is easier, though the fact that it is not attached to the crankarm means it cannot be used to get up obstacles in the same way as a bashring.\n"}

At the 2016 census, Kintore had a population of 410, of which 376 (91.9 per cent) identified themselves as Aboriginal Australians.\n\nThe Kintore Range was named by William Tietkens during his expedition of 1889 after the Governor of South Australia, Algernon Keith-Falconer, 9th Earl of Kintore.\n\nIn 1979 and 1980 satisfactory water was found in four bores sunk at and near the Kintore Range. In mid-1981 an outstation was\nestablished there and developed as a \"resource centre\" for camps elsewhere in the region, allowing the reoccupation of at least some of the Pintupi country.\n\nThe community was founded in 1981, when many Pintupi people who lived in the community of Papunya (about from Alice Springs) became unhappy with their circumstances in what they saw as foreign country, and decided to move back to their own country, from which they had been forcibly removed decades earlier due to weapons testing from Woomera in South Australia, as part of the outstation movement.\n\nKintore is overseen by the MacDonnell Regional Council, which is based in Alice Springs.

It is the first serial made to feature David Brierley as the voice of K9.\n\nThe serial is set on the planet Chloris. In the serial, Lady Adrasta (Myra Frances) imprisons the Tythonian ambassador Erato in a pit for fifteen years in order to maintain her control over the planet's limited metal supply. The alien time traveller the Fourth Doctor (Tom Baker) attempts to negotiate peace and a trade agreement with Erato.\n\nThe use of an MK3 Emergency transceiver on the TARDIS identifies a distress signal and brings the craft to the lush jungle world of Chloris, where metal in all forms is a rare and prized commodity. The Fourth Doctor and Romana venture out to discover the remains of an enormous egg in the jungle, and when they meet the inhabitants they find a matriarchy ruled through fear by the icy and callous Lady Adrasta. Without metal to make the tools needed to keep the jungle under control, lush plant life dominates. The Lady Adrasta controls the planet's very last metal mine, holding on to power through the Huntsman and the Wolfweeds. Her throne room contains an array of metal including a shield patterned in the same way as the remnants of the shell. She mentions the Creature which dwells in a deep pit on Chloris.\n\nRomana is captured by a party of scavengers, ever keen to find and hoard more metal, and they are particularly impressed by the possibilities of K9. The robot enables her escape and she is briefly reunited with the Doctor before he leaps into the Pit himself, determined to get to the bottom of the mystery and the Pit. Within the Pit he encounters Organon, an astrologer thrown there by Adrasta some time earlier, and then comes face to face with the Creature: indeed, the vast shapeless blob rolls over him. The Doctor calculates it is not, however, dangerous, and is fascinated to note it is a herbivore which produces metal from within itself. It also forms a tentacle and draws a picture which the Doctor recognises as the shield from Adrasta’s throne room. Lady Adrasta, her lady-in-waiting Karela, the Huntsman, his Wolfweeds, and some guards, enter the Pit and make their way to the Doctor, Organon and the Creature.\n\nThe scavengers have raided the throne room for booty, including the alien shield. It exerts influence over two of them, who take it to the Pit and place it on the Creature. It turns out the shield is a communication device. Erato, as the Creature is named, is the Tythonian ambassador to Chloris and came to negotiate a treaty exchanging metal for chlorophyll fifteen years earlier. Its craft was the vast egg found in the jungle. However, Adrasta realised her power was dependent on control of the planet’s metal supply and so imprisoned Erato to maintain her status. The Huntsman sets the Wolfweeds on Adrasta as Erato rolls over them both, devouring the Wolfweeds and leaving behind Adrasta's web-covered corpse. The Doctor arranges to have Erato lifted from the Pit. Adrasta’s sidekick, Karela, attempts to capitalise on the situation and seize power herself—but with the help of K9 the Doctor brings it to nought.\n\nThe Doctor has rescued the Tythonian just in time – it seems Tythonus has declared war on Chloris over the missing ambassador, and has despatched a neutron star to collide with Chloris’ star and destroy the system. It is due to collide within the next twenty-four hours. Erato weaves a metal covering around the star, enabling the Doctor, using the TARDIS gravity beam, to draw the star off course and neutralise the danger. The Doctor’s last act on Chloris is to push the Huntsman, now one of the de facto rulers, toward a mutually beneficial trade agreement with Erato and the Tythonians.\n\nThis was actually the first serial of the season to be filmed. As a result, Lalla Ward's performance and manner of dress as Romana is somewhat different from that seen in the previously broadcast serials, since she was still working out her character at the time. It was also the final story to be directed by Christopher Barry, one of \"Doctor Who\"'s longest-serving contributors.\n\nAlthough the Doctor's solution to the problem of the neutron star, weaving a shell of aluminium around it, has been criticised as silly, the idea was in fact proposed to David Fisher by members of the Institute of Astronomy, Cambridge. Director Christopher Barry and visual effects designer Mat Irvine were called on the carpet by the BBC management for the appearance of the creature Erato. The phallic appearance of the proboscis in the first episode resulted in uncontrolled laughter in the studio and prompted an overnight change to add a pair of pincers to the creature.\n\nAt the start of the story K9 is seen reading \"The Tale of Peter Rabbit\" to the Doctor.\n\nDavid Brierley makes his debut as the voice of K9 in this story, taking over from John Leeson. Adrasta's engineer, Tollund, was played by former \"Doctor Who\" director Morris Barry. Eileen Way, who played Karela, also played the Old Mother in the first \"Doctor Who\" story, \"An Unearthly Child\" (1963). Geoffrey Bayldon, who played Organon, would go on to portray an alternate version of the Doctor, one who never left Gallifrey, in the Big Finish Production \"Auld Mortality\". Terry Walsh played Doran in Part One; this was his final appearance in the series having appeared in various roles since 1966 as well as acting as fight arranger and the stunt double for both Jon Pertwee and Tom Baker.\n\nPaul Cornell, Martin Day, and Keith Topping wrote in \"The Discontinuity Guide\" (1995) that the bandits were cliched and viewers who enjoyed Douglas Adams' humour would appreciate the serial more. They noted that some have described it as \"a conscious spoof of bad science fiction. On the other hand, it could just be bad science fiction.\" In \"The Television Companion\" (1998), David J. Howe and Stephen James Walker wrote that the setting was fleshed out but failed to develop it. They also criticised the characters, acting, dialogue, and direction, though they praised Geoffrey Bayldon as Organon and Myra Frances as Adrasta. In 2011, Patrick Mulkern of \"Radio Times\" criticised the monster, but was positive towards Barry's direction and some of the \"vivid characters,\" though he noted the bandits and minor characters were lacking. DVD Talk's John Sinnot gave \"The Creature from the Pit\" three and a half out of five stars. He described it as having \"the right mixture of humor and drama,\" although the monster let down. While Sinnot praised Baker, he criticised Ward's Romana, who had not yet grown into the role. Cliff Chapman of Den of Geek was also more positive, giving it four out of five stars and highlighting the acting, dialogue, and visual quality aside from the realisation of Erato.\n\nA novelisation of this serial, written by David Fisher, was published by Target Books in January 1981. Fisher amuses himself with lengthy discourses on life on Tythonus complete with a glossary. An audiobook was released by the BBC on 7 April 2008 read by Tom Baker as part of the \"Doctor Who: Classic Novels\" range. The audio book was broadcast on BBC Radio 7 in April and May 2010.\n\n\"The Creature from the Pit\" was released on VHS in July 2002. It was released on DVD in May 2010.\n"}

He later turned to ethnological studies of the native tribes in the American Southwest.\n\nIn 1889, with the resignation of noted ethnologist Frank Hamilton Cushing, Fewkes became leader of the Hemenway Southwestern Archaeological Expedition, named for its patron Mary Hemenway. While with this project, Fewkes documented the existing lifestyle and rituals of the Zuni and Hopi tribes.\n\nFewkes was the first man to use a phonograph to record indigenous people for study. He tested its use among the Passamaquoddy in Maine, before traveling to the Southwest to make his recordings of the Zuni (1890) and Hopi (1891). Benjamin Ives Gilman used these recordings to show that they used musical intervals unlike those in the Western tempered scale. In addition to the recordings, he wrote historically valuable descriptions of the music and musical practice.\nFewkes surveyed the ruins of a number of cultures in the American Southwest, and wrote many well received articles and books. He supervised the excavation of the Casa Grande ruins in southern Arizona, a Hohokam site, and the Mesa Verde ruins in southern Colorado, an Ancient Pueblo site. He particularly focused on the variants and styles of prehistoric Southwest Indian pottery, producing a number of volumes with carefully drawn illustrations. His work on the Mimbres and Sikyátki pottery styles eventually led to the reproduction of many of these traditional forms and images. The Hopi potter Nampeyo became his friend and reproduced the newly documented traditional designs in her own work.\n\nIn study of the Hopi Indians religious rituals and festivities Fewkes compiled descriptions and drawings of the Hopis' Katsinam. He commissioned several Hopi artist, knowledgeable in the Katsina cult and with the least outside influence in art, to produce series of paintings of the Hopis' supernatural beings, the Katsinam. This Codex Hopi, a manuscript of all the known Hopi Katsinam was the first permanent documentation of the ceremonial performers and preserved the existence of the Katsinam that otherwise may have ceased to appear.\n\nFewkes was one of the first voices for government preservation of ancient sites in the American Southwest. By the mid-1890s, vandalism of these sites was widespread. In the \"American Anthropologist\" for August 1896, Fewkes described a large cliff dwelling called Palatki, or \"Red House\", situated in the Red Rock country southwest of Flagstaff, Arizona, and appealed for protective legislation.\n\nIf this destruction of the cliff-houses of New Mexico, Colorado, and Arizona goes on at the same rate in the next fifty years that it has in the past, these unique dwellings will be practically destroyed, and unless laws are enacted, either by states or by the general government, for their protection, at the close of the twentieth century many of the most interesting monuments of the prehistoric peoples of our Southwest will be little more than mounds of debris at the bases of the cliffs. A commercial spirit is leading to careless excavations for objects to sell, and walls are ruthlessly overthrown, buildings torn down in hope of a few dollars' gain. The proper designation of the way our antiquities are treated is vandalism. Students who follow us, when these cliff-houses have all disappeared and their instructive objects scattered by greed of traders, will wonder at our indifference and designate our negligence by its proper name.

His Pali monastic name, 'Mahā Ghosānanda', means \"great joyful proclaimer\". He was well known in Cambodia for his annual peace marches.\n\nHe was born Va Yav in Takéo Province, Cambodia in 1913 to a farming family in the Mekong Delta plains. From an early age he showed great interest in religion, and began to serve as a temple boy at age eight. He greatly impressed the monks with whom he served, and at age fourteen received novice ordination. He studied Pali scriptures in the local temple high school, then went on to complete his higher education at the monastic universities in Phnom Penh and Battambang.\n\nHe was sponsored by Chuon Nath to travel to India to pursue a doctorate in Pali at Nalanda University in Bihar, at that time an institute known under the name of Nava Nālandā Mahāvihāra. While in India, he studied under the Japanese monk Nichidatsu Fujii, founder of the Japanese peace-oriented sect Nipponzan Myohoji and a former associate of Mahatma Gandhi. \n\nIn 1965, Maha Ghosananda left India to study meditation under Ajahn Dhammadaro,a famous meditation master of the Thai Forest Tradition. He remained with Ajahn Dhammadaro at his forest hermitage in southern Thailand, Wat Chai Na (located near Nakhon Si Thammarat),for eleven years. \n\nIn 1978, Maha Ghosananda traveled to the refugee camps near the Thai-Cambodian border to begin ministering to the first refugees who filtered across the border.\n\nMaha Ghosananda's appearance in the refugee camps raised a stir among the refugees who had not seen a monk for years. The Cambodian refugees openly wept as Maha Ghosananda chanted the ancient and familiar sutras that had been the bedrock of traditional Cambodian culture before Year Zero. He distributed photocopied Buddhist scriptures among the refugees, as protection and inspiration for the battered people.\n\nWhen the Pol Pot regime collapsed in 1979, Maha Ghosananda was one of only 3,000 Cambodian Buddhist monks alive, out of more than 60,000 at the start of the reign of terror in 1976. Throughout 1979 Maha Ghosananda established \"wats\" in refugee camps along the Thai-Cambodian border, ordaining monks against the orders of the Thai military. He also founded more than 30 temples for Cambodian refugees living in Canada and the United States.\n\nHis entire family, and countless friends and disciples, were massacred by the Khmer Rouge.\n\nMaha Ghosananda served as a key figure in post-Communist Cambodia, helping to restore the nation state and to revive Cambodian Buddhism. In 1980, he served as a representative of the Cambodian nation-in-exile to the United Nations.\n\nIn 1980 Maha Ghosananda and the Reverend Peter L. Pond formed the Inter-Religious Mission for Peace in Cambodia. Together they located hundreds of surviving monks and nuns in Cambodia so that they could renew their vows and take leadership roles in Cambodian temples around the world. In June 1980 the Thai Government decided to forcibly repatriate thousands of refugees. Pond and the Preah Maha Ghosananda organized a protest against the forced repatriation of refugees from Sa Kaeo Refugee Camp.\n\nIn 1988, Maha Ghosananda was elected as \"sanghreach\" (sangharaja) by a small gathering of exiled monks in Paris. He agreed to accept the position provisionally, until a complete, independent monastic hierarchy could be established in Cambodia. At the time, Venerable Tep Vong was the titular head of a unified Cambodian sangha, having been appointed to the position in 1981 by the Vietnamese-backed People's Republic of Kampuchea.\n\nIn 1989, he returned full-time to Cambodia, taking up residence at Wat Sampeou Meas in Phnom Penh.\n\nIn 1992, during the first year of the United Nations sponsored peace agreement, Maha Ghosananda led the first nationwide Dhammayietra, a peace march or pilgrimage, across Cambodia in an effort to begin restoring the hope and spirit of the Cambodian people.\n\nThe 16-day, 125-mile peace walk passed through territory still littered with landmines from the Khmer Rouge. The initial walk consisted of approximately 350 monks, nuns, and lay Buddhists who escorted around 100 Cambodians from refugee camps to their villages in Cambodia. This was carried out without official permission from Thai or Cambodian officials to cross the border. By the time the march reached Phnom Penh it had grown in size significantly, and drew coverage from the international media. In recognition of his contributions, King Sihanouk bestowed on Maha Goshananda the title \"samdech song santipeap\" ('Leader of Religion and Peace') later that year.\n\nThe Dhammayietra became an annual walk which Maha Ghosananda led a number of times, despite the danger during the Khmer Rouge years. In 1995, the Dhammayietra consisted of almost 500 Cambodian Buddhist monks, nuns and precept-taking lay people. They were joined by The Interfaith Pilgrimage for Peace and Life. Together the two groups crossed Cambodia from the Thai border all the way to Vietnam, spending several days walking through Khmer Rouge-controlled territory along the way. For his teachings on non-violence and establishing Buddhist temples throughout the world that root his exiled people in their religion of peace, he was presented with the Peace Abbey Courage of Conscience Award.\n\nHe had been called \"the Gandhi of Cambodia.\" Maha Ghosananda was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize by the chair of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Claiborne Pell. He was again nominated in 1995, 1996, and 1997 for his work in bringing peace to Cambodia. He also acted as an adviser to the Buddhist Peace Fellowship and resided part-time in the Palelai Buddhist Temple and Monastery in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States.\n\nHe died in Northampton, Massachusetts on March 12, 2007.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2090780", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2090780", "title": "Kamal Hossain", "text": "Kamal Hossain\n\nKamal Hossain (born 20 April 1937) is a Bangladeshi lawyer and politician. He is head of Kamal Hossain & Associates, a law firm based in Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh. Hossain is the founder and president of the Gano Forum political party and leader of the Jatiya Oikya Front alliance. He is widely regarded as an icon of secular democracy in South Asia. Hossain is the leader of the pro-democracy movement in Bangladesh.\n\nEducated at the University of Notre Dame and the University of Oxford, he was called to the bar of England and Wales in Lincoln's Inn in 1959. Hossain enrolled as an advocate in the High Court of East Pakistan. He worked on cases with prominent Pakistani lawyers, including Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy and Mahmud Ali Kasuri, early in his legal career. Hossain often worked on \"habeas corpus\" cases during the Ayub Khan regime. Between 1961 and 1968, he taught law at Dhaka University. Hossain was the legal counsel of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and the Awami League during the Agartala Conspiracy Case, and was elected vice-chairman of the Pakistan Bar Council in 1970. In 1971, he was part of the League's negotiation team for the transfer of power after the 1970 general election. Hossain was imprisoned in West Pakistan with Sheikh Mujibur Rahman during the war of independence that transformed East Pakistan into Bangladesh.\n\nHe served in Bangladesh's first post-independence government from 1972 to 1975, initially as law minister and chairman of the drafting committee in the Constituent Assembly. Hossain led the process which produced the 1972 Constitution of Bangladesh. He then served as foreign minister, and led Bangladesh to join the United Nations in 1974. As energy minister, Hossain later enacted the Bangladesh Petroleum Act. He was a research fellow and visiting fellow at Oxford University during the late 1970s. In 1981, he ran as an opposition candidate for president against Abdus Sattar. Hossain fell out with Awami League president Sheikh Hasina during the 1990s, and formed the Gono Forum (People's Forum) party. Hossain has often worked with the United Nations and the Commonwealth of Nations. He was also considered as a candidate for the post of UN Secretary General.\n\nRevered in Bangladesh as the \"conscience of the nation\", Hossain was compared to Adlai Stevenson by \"The New York Times\" in 1981. Hossain has been a leading lawyer in the field of human rights, energy law, corporate law and international arbitration. He served on the Iran-United States Claims Tribunal and as UN Special Rapporteur for Afghanistan. Hossain has been a member of tribunals dealing with maritime disputes between Malaysia and Singapore and Guyana and Suriname. He was a two-term member of the UN Compensation Commission. He is a former vice-president of the International Law Association, former president of the Bangladesh Supreme Court Bar Association; and chairman of the Bangladesh Legal Aid and Services Trust and the South Asian Institute of Advanced Legal and Human Rights Studies (SAILS).\n\nHossain's family is from Shaestabad in Barisal; his grandfather, Syed Sadat Hossain, was the zamindar of Shaestabad. The area of Shaestabad was home to several Bengali zaminda. Hossain's father, Ahmed, was an early Bengali Muslim physician and MBBS holder in Calcutta, Bengal Presidency, British India. The elder Hossain was a relative of Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy, the third Prime Minister of Bengal and fifth Prime Minister of Pakistan.\n\nKamal Hossain was born on 20 April 1937 in Calcutta. His family moved to Dhaka, East Bengal in 1949 after the partition of British India. Hossain attended St. Gregory's High School, where his classmates included the future academic Anisuzzaman. He received a two-year scholarship to the University of Notre Dame in Indiana, United States at age 16, and studied economics before pursuing a master's degree from the University of Michigan. Hossain's American classmates included Richard V. Allen, future national security advisor to President Ronald Reagan. In the U.S., he joined the Pakistan Students Association with fellow Bengalis Nurul Islam and Golam Wahed Choudhury. Hossain was a member of the association's leadership committee, which was led by Munir Ahmed Khan.\n\nHe has cited Justice Fazal Akbar as an inspiration to study law. Hossain moved to England from the U.S. in 1958, traveling to London by ship. In England, he met future professor Rehman Sobhan. In 1959, Hossain received a Bachelor of Civil Law degree from the University of Oxford and enrolled as a barrister in Lincoln's Inn. He also enrolled as an advocate in the High Court of East Pakistan. Hossain received a Doctor of Philosophy degree in international law from Oxford in 1964, with his dissertation \"State Sovereignty and the United Nations Charter\".\n\nHossain began his practice at Original (one of the oldest law firms on the Indian subcontinent, which had established a division in East Bengal during the 1950s), and was invited to join the firm by lawyer Abul Ahmad. At Original, Hossain worked with two Englishmen and Justice Mohammad Hossain. Hossain was at Original from 1959 to 1962, when he came into frequent contact with barrister and former prime minister Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy. Pakistan had come under military rule after a 1958 coup, and Hossain has recounted that he and Suhrawardy often zigzagged their car through Dhaka's streets to confuse (and evade) Pakistani-intelligence vehicles. Through Suhrawardy, Hossain came into contact with Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. He has said that Rahman predicted the collapse of Ayub Khan's regime in 10 years (which it did, in 1969).\n\nHossain defended Maulana Bhashani in a \"habeas corpus\" case. He was a lawyer for the English Rally brothers, who owned businesses in the Port of Narayanganj, and worked on a case for Chandranath Films. In 1963, Hossain began independent practice as a barrister. He represented \"The Daily Ittefaq\", one of East Pakistan's largest Bengali-language newspapers, when it was banned by the Pakistani government. East Pakistan Chief Justice Badruddin Ahmed Siddiky told Hossain's lead counsel Mahmud Ali Kasuri to give the floor to Hossain during the \"Ittefaq\" case, and Kasuri obliged. The verdict favored Hossain and Kasuri.\n\nHe joined Dhaka University's Department of International Relations as a part-time lecturer in 1961, and later taught international law. Hossain's academic work at the university continued until 1969, and he was a staunch supporter of the six point movement.\n\nDuring the Agartala Conspiracy Case, Hossain prepared the writ petition and worked on the case with Queen's Counsel Thomas William. In 1967, 1968 and 1969, he was elected vice-chairman of the East Pakistan Bar Council (now the Bangladesh Bar Council). Hossain was elected the last vice-chairman of the All-Pakistan Bar Council in 1969. In 1969 and 1970, he was involved in the round-table conferences between the government of Pakistan and major opposition parties led by the Awami League and Sheikh Mujibur Rahman.\n\nKamal Hossain was the Awami League's chief political negotiator. After the 1970 Pakistani general election, Sheikh Mujib vacated one of his seats in Dacca and allowed Hossain to be elected to the National Assembly of Pakistan from that seat. Hossain was considered one of Mujib's closest confidantes, along with Tajuddin Ahmad. Between January and March 1971, Hossain negotiated with Pakistan's Law Minister Alvin Robert Cornelius and the Pakistan Peoples Party's lawyer Abdul Hafeez Pirzada over the transfer of power.\n\nHossain was imprisoned in West Pakistan's Central Prison Haripur during the 1971 Bangladesh War of Independence. He was released on 28 December 1971. After his release, he accompanied Sheikh Mujibur Rahman to London and New Delhi, followed by a triumphant homecoming in an independent Bangladesh on 10 January 1972.\n\nHossain was appointed as the first law minister of the newly formed country. One of his chief responsibilities was to frame a constitution. He was chairman of the Constitution Drafting Committee in the Constituent Assembly of Bangladesh. He was 35 years of age at the time, making him one of the youngest constitution drafters in the world. Hossain was credited for leading the successful completion of the constitution's drafting process. The Constitution of Bangladesh was approved on 4 November 1972 and came into force on 16 December 1971. The constitution included a bill of rights and professed parliamentary government (scrapped in 1975 and restored in 1991).\n\nHowever, the constitution also included references to socialism, including language such as \"realise through the democratic process a socialist society\". On socialism, Hossain said \"socialism was very much within the democratic framework and not socialism in the sense of communism. That, again, I think, is something that in the context of our historical experience from the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s was the big issue in those days\". According to Hossain, the Awami League supported social democracy inspired by the politics of the British Labour Party. He recounted that socialism was an important political current in South Asia, especially during the 1960s and 1970s. For example, the Indian constitution also includes references to socialism. The government of post-1971 leader Zulfikar Ali Bhutto embarked on nationalization in Pakistan. The Dominion of Ceylon was proclaimed as the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka in 1972.\n\nHossain served as a Member of Parliament from Dhaka in the Jatiyo Sangshad. He became the Foreign Minister of Bangladesh in 1973. Hossain secured Bangladesh's admission to the United Nations in 1974. The U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger called Hossain \"another student of mine\".\n\nHossain was a signatory to the Delhi Agreement between India, Pakistan and Bangladesh. The agreement sought to normalize relations in the subcontinent after the 1971 conflict. In the agreement, Pakistan pledged to release interned Bengali families in exchange for the return of PoWs held by India and Bangladesh. On dealing with neighboring India, Hossain has said \"I had a great equation with Mrs Indira Gandhi and her foreign minister Swaran Singh. We discussed the knotty issue of land boundary with so much ease\".\nHossain was also appointed as energy minister. The 1973 oil crisis began to push developing countries like Bangladesh to explore their own oil and gas reserves. There was speculation of large reserves in the Bay of Bengal. Hossain began to study the legal reforms needed for Bangladesh to launch a hydrocarbon industry. 40 foreign companies applied to explore the bay. Under Hossain's tenure in the ministry, Petrobangla was established. Hossain drafted the Bangladesh Petroleum Act after studying the laws of Malaysia and Indonesia. The new law replaced colonial laws and introduced the Production Sharing Contract for multinational energy firms in the country.\n\nHossain offered to resign on several occasions because of pressure due to the Awami League's lobbying activities. However, he continued to serve in Mujib's cabinet, even after the creation of the one party system of BAKSAL that lasted for 6 months between January and August 1975, until the assassination of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman on 15 August 1975. At the time of the Mujib's killing, Hossain was visiting Yugoslavia on a bilateral visit. He refused invitations to join the martial law government. Fearing for his life and rejecting calls to return, he moved to Oxford University for a period of teaching and research.\n\nOn BAKSAL, Hossain has said \"Till 1971 I had not seen any differences between Mujib Bhai (the friend) and Bangabandhu (the leader). After 1972, he became the head of state. But, he never was both the head of the state and head of the party simultaneously. That change came later during the formation of BAKSAL. And that happened in a very complex situation. Through what dynamics he (Mujib) changed I cannot understand\".\n\nThe next government, which assumed power after Mujib's killing, functioned as a junta for 3 years headed by a Chief Martial Law Administrator. In 1979, President Ziaur Rahman (who was army chief during the junta) restored multiparty politics, promoted free markets and pursued pro-Western, anti-Communist policies. The 1979 Bangladeshi general election restored the country's parliament. Hossain returned to Bangladesh in the late 1970s during this period of political liberalization.\n\nIn 1981, Hossain was instrumental in orchestrating Sheikh Hasina's return to Bangladesh from her exile in India (Hasina and Sheikh Rehana could not return to the country since their family's murder in 1975). He contested the 1981 Bangladeshi presidential election as the Awami League's candidate. He lost to then incumbent Justice Abdus Sattar, who had been acting president after the assassination of Ziaur Rahman. Within a year of the election, Sattar was deposed by the military during the 1982 Bangladesh coup d'état. At the time of President Hussain Muhammad Ershad's downfall in 1990, Hossain played a leading role in drawing up the Three-Alliance Roadmap for the restoration of parliamentary democracy after 15 years of presidential government. He was also involved in making the then chief justice Shahabuddin Ahmed the head of the transitional government.\n\nIn 1992, differences between Hossain and Awami League president Sheikh Hasina caused him to leave the party. He set up a small political party called Gano Forum. In 1996, when the Awami League and Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) were at loggerheads, Kamal Hossain and Syed Ishtiaq Ahmed devised a formula that culminated in the introduction of the system of caretaker governance for holding general elections. Similar caretaker governments headed by judges were later adopted in Pakistan, Greece and Bhutan.\n\nIn 2003, Hossain was the counsel for \"The Daily Star\" editor Mahfuz Anam and \"Prothom Alo\" editor Matiur Rahman in a defamation case filed by Salahuddin Quader Chowdhury. In 2006, when the caretaker system was threatened by Prime Minister Khaleda Zia's efforts to influence the election process, Kamal Hossain led the legal battle against the fraudulent voter list drawn up by the Zia government. Hossain also criticized extrajudicial killings by the Rapid Action Battalion under the Zia administration.\n\nHossain has criticized human rights abuses under the second and third Hasina administrations. In 2011, he defended Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus in court following Hasina's decision to sack Yunus from the board of Grameen Bank. In 2018, Hossain defended the photographer Shahidul Alam in court after Alam was detained on charges of criticizing Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. Hossain has also supported the deposed chief justice Surendra Kumar Sinha who struck down a constitutional amendment allowing parliament to impeach supreme court judges.\n\nIn October 2018, Kamal Hossain announced a new alliance called Jatiya Oikya Front (National Unity Front), which received backing from the BNP. Hossain addressed political rallies in different Bangladeshi cities during October and November 2018. He addressed a rally in Sylhet on 24 October. In Chittagong on 27 October, he warned the Hasina government of legal consequences if the opposition's election demands were not met. At a rally in Suhrawardy Udyan in Dhaka on 6 November 2018, Hossain said \"The state does not belong to any king or queen. It is the people who are the sole owners of the state and their ownership must be realized\".\n\nHe secured a major breakthrough in Bangladeshi politics by requesting Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to have a dialogue with the BNP. The US Ambassador to Bangladesh Marcia Bernicat lauded the dialogue initiative. The first round of talks took place on 1 November 2018 and the second round on 7 November 2018. Hossain also met with the Chief Election Commissioner, attended the Mawlid prayer in Bangabhaban and the military reception on Armed Forces Day.\n\nThe official campaign period began on 8 November 2018. Previous free and fair elections in Bangladesh were usually a festive affair. Despite the dialogue and assurances of a peaceful election atmosphere from Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, the campaign period was marked by persecution of civil society, media and the opposition; and human rights abuses by security forces. Human Rights Watch noted that \"widespread surveillance and a crackdown on speech, have contributed to a climate of fear extending from prominent voices in society to ordinary citizens.\" The Awami League's affiliated student and youth wings mobilized its members who were armed with bamboo poles to attack the opposition. Hossain's motorcade was attacked on 14 December 2018.\n\nThe 2018 Bangladeshi general election was held amid widespread allegations of vote rigging, ballot box stuffing and intimidation of opposition polling agents. Hossain said \"There was an unprecedented vote robbery, which is a mockery of democracy. The government has exploited state machinery to suppress opposition and secure a stage-managed victory. We call upon the Election Commission to declare the election void and demand a fresh election under a non-partisan government\". After the election commission refused demands for a new election, Hossain called the incoming government illegitimate. He said \"We need a united movement of citizens, political parties and human rights organizations that are committed to the realization of human rights and the institutionalization of democracy in the country. I hope the international community will take note of the current situation in Bangladesh. And on the basis of the United Nations Charter and resolutions, it shouldn't recognize any government which doesn't have the consent of the people\".\n\nThe United States (Bangladesh's largest foreign investor) and the European Union (Bangladesh's largest export market) issued statements concerning the credibility of the election. The EU statement stated that \"The European Union expects the country to move forward towards democracy, respect of human rights and fundamental freedoms. We will continue to support the work in this context, in the interest of the people of Bangladesh. The relevant national authorities should now ensure a proper examination of allegations of irregularities and commit to full transparency in their resolution\". The US State Department stated \"We strongly encourage all parties to refrain from violence and request the Election Commission work constructively with all sides to address claims of irregularities. Bangladesh’s impressive record of economic development and respect for democracy and human rights are mutually reinforcing, and we look forward to continue working with the ruling government and opposition towards advancing these interrelated goals\".\n\nBetween 1977 and 2001, Hossain served as an international consultant for the multinational law firm Clifford Chance. He was also President of the Supreme Court Bar Association (1990–1991), the professional association of law practitioners in the Supreme Court of Bangladesh.\n\nKamal Hossain and Justice Badrul Haider Chowdhury led the Bangladeshi legal team during a lawsuit filed by Scimitar Exploration Ltd at the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes.\n\nKamal Hossain represented Petrobangla in a lawsuit filed by Chevron at the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes. The court rejected Chevron's claims from Petrobangla amounting to US$240 million.\n\nHossain is renowned worldwide as a jurist and enjoys a long-standing association with the United Nations. Between 1998 and 2003, he served as the UN Special Rapporteur on Afghanistan. He served two terms on the UN Compensation Commission in Geneva. In addition, he has appeared in several international arbitrations, both as a lawyer and an arbitrator. He was a member of the Iran-United States Claims Tribunal. He was Co-Chair of the United Nations Commission of Inquiry into Human Rights Violations in the Occupied Territories in 2001. He was Chairman of the Advisory Commission on Human Rights for the Commonwealth Secretariat. He was also a member of a human rights mission to Indonesia concerning the status of East Timor. During the 2006 United Nations Secretary-General selection, Hossain's name was floated as a possible candidate.\n\nAt the urging of the UN, Hossain advised China on energy-related legal reforms after the Asian giant began to liberalize its economy.\n\nHe is a member of the Panel of Arbitrators at ICSID and served as Chair and Member of a number of international arbitral tribunals (ICC, ICSID and UNCITRAL). He was appointed as a Judge ad hoc by Malaysia for the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea in the case \"Malaysia v Singapore\" (2003); he was a Member of the International Law of the Sea Annex VII Tribunal in the same case, as well as in \"Guyana v Suriname\" (2005–2007).\n\nHe has also been vice chairman of the International Law Association in London, chairman of the South Asian Institute of Advanced Legal and Human Rights Studies (SAILS), and advisory council member for Transparency International. He has been an international election observer.\n\nAt the request of Commonwealth Secretary-General Emeka Anyaoku, Hossain visited Cameroon and The Gambia to assess the conditions of democracy, human rights and the rule of law. The Secretary-General entrusted a team including Hossain with assessing Cameroon's eligibility for Commonwealth membership. He also led Commonwealth missions on energy-related matters. He was part of the Commonwealth observer team during the 1994 South African general election. Hossain was a counsel to the governments of Trinidad and Tobago, Grenada, the Cayman Islands, Fiji and the Solomon Islands.\n\nHossain is the vanguard of liberal, secular politics in modern Bangladesh. He has been described as the \"elder statesman\" of Bangladesh, a \"father figure\" in the political arena; and the \"conscience of the nation\". An article in \"The Daily Star\" on the occasion of Hossain's 70th birthday states \"If anything, in these past many years, he has in a way been transformed into an effective moral voice for the country. His opinions on the issues that matter, his presence on the national and global stage, all of these have reinforced our feeling that this man of the law also happens to be our point of reference on all other matters which exercise our imagination\". In 1981, \"The New York Times\" reported that Western diplomats compared Hossain to the former US senator and presidential candidate Adlai Stevenson, who was reputed for his intellectual demeanor. In 2018, an article in \"The Diplomat\" magazine described Hossain as a \"shrewd\" back-channel player.\n\nIn regional neighbors India and Pakistan, Hossain is celebrated as a secular icon with impeccable credentials. Hossain delivered a speech at the Pakistan Institute of International Affairs in 2012, which was titled \"Building a peaceful South Asia in response to the aspirations of all our peoples\".\n\nDuring the 2018 election campaign, Shah Ali Farhad, who works in the Awami League's Centre for Research and Information, wrote in the Bangla Tribune that Kamal Hossain was a \"not so conscientious\" politician. He criticized Hossain for holding the presidency of Gono Forum since its founding, arguing that the party had \"no prospects of a new leadership in sight\". Hossain has been labelled a \"Pakistani collaborator\" and a \"Qadiani\" Muslim, despite being one of Bangladesh's founding leaders and a Sunni Muslim. He has been accused of betraying the family of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman.\n\nArun Kumar Goswami, a political science professor at Jagannath University, criticized Hossain for not being a mass leader, stating \"The politics Dr. Kamal Hossain wants to introduce would not work in Bangladesh. You cannot succeed in politics here without having connection with the people\". Goswami was in turn refuted by Moudud Ahmed, who stated \"I can refer a number of politicians who succeeded with lesser contact with people than that of Dr. Kamal Hossain\".\n\nIn response to Hossain's demand for a caretaker government in 2018, Sheikh Hasina said such a provision was not included in Bangladesh's first constitution drafted by Hossain himself under her father's tenure. The BNP responded to this charge by pointing out that Hasina herself led the campaign for starting caretaker governance for elections in 1996. Former president A. Q. M. Badruddoza Chowdhury and his son Mahi B. Chowdhury initially supported Hossain as part of the National Unity Front, but later switched to support for the Awami League and began to criticize Hossain's political ambitions.\n\nDuring a hearing in the Supreme Court in 2017, Hossain used an expletive against Attorney General Mahbubey Alam and was censured by chief justice Surendra Kumar Sinha.\n\nDuring the election campaign period in December 2018, Hossain was asked about the underground relationship between the BNP and the Jamaat. Hossain told the reporter to \"keep quiet\" but later regretted his reaction after protests from two journalist trade unions. He later called the BNP-Jamaat relationship \"stupid\".\n\nHossain published a work on petroleum law in 1979. The book was titled \"Law and policy in petroleum development: Changing relations between transnationals and governments\". In 2013, Oxford University Press published Hossain's memoir, titled \"Bangladesh: Quest for Freedom and Justice\". Hossain also authored a book in Bengali in 1994, titled \"Svāẏattaśāsana theke svādhīnatā\" (Civil government and independence).\n\nHossain taught Constitutional Law and International Law at Queen’s College, Oxford (1957–59). He was a Research Student (1958-9, 1964) and Research Fellow (1977–79) of Nuffield College, Oxford and a Visiting Fellow (1976–77) of All Souls College, Oxford. He taught International Law and Constitutional law in the University of Dhaka (1962–67). He was a Visiting Professor at the Free University of Amsterdam (1997).\n\nHossain married Hameeda Hossain in 1963. He has two daughters, including the leading Bangladeshi civil rights lawyer Sara Hossain and the film maker Dina Hossain. His son-in-law (through Sara Hossain) is British journalist David Bergman.\n\nIn response to a query about his favorite foods, Hossain mentioned cheesecake as his preferred dessert.\n\n"}

The historic hotel (1914) is located in downtown Calgary, Alberta at 133 9th Avenue Southwest adjacent to the Calgary Tower and Palliser Square. It is the city's oldest and most luxurious hotel and celebrated its centennial on June 1, 2014.\n\nWhen the Canadian Pacific Railway pushed west in 1883, Calgary was essentially a mounted police post and trading centre. With an influx of tourists, mainly en route to Canadian Pacific's Banff Springs hotel, a hospitality spot in Calgary was an essential link.\n\nGroundbreaking for the building was on May 12, 1911, on property owned by the Canadian Pacific Railway. It was built by \"P. Lyall and Sons Construction Company\" with materials such as stone, steel, reinforced concrete and brick at a cost of $1,500,000.\n\nThe hotel opened on June 1, 1914. Like all of the flagship Canadian hotels in the Fairmont chain, it was built by the Canadian Pacific Railway and was a property of Canadian Pacific Hotels and Resorts (CP Hotels) until the company purchased the Fairmont Hotel chain and changed its name to Fairmont Hotels and Resorts in 1999. \n\nThe hotel was named after Captain John Palliser, who was an explorer in the region during the 1850s. Architect Lawrence Gotch of \"E. and W.S. Maxwell of Montreal\" designed the Edwardian building with a characteristic Chicago school look. The building was originally eight stories high, with three stories added in 1929, making it Calgary's highest building until 1958. It has been renovated and expanded a number of times throughout its history, including a $28 million renovation in 2000. Further enhancements and renovations in recent years included an update to Fairmont Gold and many guest rooms. \n\nThe Palliser, and the Hotel Macdonald in Edmonton, received the first two liquor licenses from the Alberta Liquor Control Board when Alberta repealed Prohibition in 1924.\n\n\n"}

In its current form (as of 2013), 42 U.S.C. 2000e(j) forbids discrimination on the basis of religion, including \"all aspects of religious observance and practice, as well as belief, unless an employer demonstrates that he is unable to reasonably accommodate to an employee's or prospective employee's religious observance or practice without undue hardship on the conduct of the employer's business.\" The 2013 version of WRFA would delete the phrase \"he is unable,\" and substitute for it: \"the employer is unable, after initiating and engaging in an affirmative and bona fide effort.\" In other words, an employer would be required to make a \"bona fide effort\" to accommodate each religious practice or observance, and would be relieved of this duty only if the employer could prove that the effort resulted in \"undue hardship.\"\n\nWRFA would also add an additional provision, to be codified at 42 U.S.C. 2000e(j)(2), further limiting employers' ability to deny accommodations with respect to \"the practice of wearing religious clothing or a religious hairstyle, or of taking time off for a religious reason.\" In such cases, the employer's proposed choice of accommodation would not be considered reasonable (or lawful) \"unless the accommodation removes the conflict between employment requirements and the religious practice of the employee.\" In order to refuse accommodation to these categories of religious practices, an employer would be required to meet a stringent definition of undue hardship by showing that \"the accommodation imposes a significant difficulty or expense on the conduct of the employer's business.\"\n\nWith these provisions, WRFA expressly attempts to supersede the Supreme Court's decision in \"Trans World Airlines, Inc. v. Hardison\", 432 U.S. 63 (1977) (see Section 2, \"Findings,\" para. 3). In that case, the Supreme Court held that an employer could deny an employee’s request for religious accommodation based on any burden greater than a \"de minimis\" burden on the employer.\n\nWRFA was first introduced in the House of Representatives in 1994 by Jerrold Nadler (D-NY). As originally introduced, the proposed 42 U.S.C. 2000e(j)(2) would not have been limited to religious clothing, hairstyle and holiday observances.\n\nThe bill was introduced in the Senate in 1999, by Senator John Kerry (D-MA), and again in 2002. Senator Rick Santorum (R-PA) introduced the bill again in 2003. In 2005, WFRA was once again introduced in the Senate by Senators Santorum and Kerry, and in the House of Representatives by Representatives Mark Souder (R-IN), Carolyn McCarthy (D-NY), Bobby Jindal (R-LA), and Anthony Weiner (D-NY). Other supporters of the bill included Senator Hillary Clinton (D-NY) and Senator Ted Kennedy (D-MA). The bill did not pass either house. In 2010, the Act was reintroduced in the Senate as the Workplace Religious Freedom Act of 2010 (S. 4046). In 2012, the Act was again reintroduced in the Senate as the Workplace Religious Freedom Act of 2013 (S. 3686). In each case, the Act's sponsor was Senator John Kerry (D-MA). In its various incarnations, the scope of WRFA was narrowed to encompass religious dress, grooming, and holidays. Although WRFA has consistently had supporters in both parties, it has yet to pass.\n\nThis legislation has garnered the diverse support of various religious groups including, the Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations, the Southern Baptist Convention, the National Council of Churches, the North American Council for Muslim Women, the Sikh American Legal Defense and Education Fund, the Seventh-day Adventist Church, the Jewish Council for Public Affairs ,the Council on American Islamic Relations, B'nai B'rith International, the American Jewish Committee, Agudath Israel of America, the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops and other groups.\n\nWhen first introduced, WRFA was opposed by the ACLU. The ACLU considered the bill \"poorly-written\" and argued that it could legalize certain acts of discrimination in the name of religion. The ACLU was also concerned that other employees might be forced to carry additional workloads to accommodate the religious practices of co-workers, and that the secular nature of the workplace would be eroded. They and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and several other business organizations opposed it as placing undue legal burdens on employers. When the scope of the provision which would create 42 U.S.C. 2000e(j)(2) was narrowed, supporters of the bill claimed that the ACLU dropped its opposition, although the ACLU itself declined comment. Michael J. Eastman, executive director of labor law policy for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said of the revised bill, \"We are not in the habit of supporting bills that make it easier to sue our members.\"\n\n\n"}

Several species (though not all) are pachycaul plants with a very stout stem for their overall size, used to store water during periods of drought. The leaves show intraspecific variation and generally range from entire to deeply palmately lobed with long slender leaflet-like lobes joined only right at the base. Their sizes range from 4 – 20 cm long and wide.\n\nAll species are monoecious with separate male and female flowers on the same plant. The flowers have a bell-shaped perianth consisting of a single series of fused lobes which is regarded as a calyx despite being brightly coloured in most species. The female flowers have five separate carpels that can each form a woody fruit containing several seeds. The flower colour is often variable within species. Eastern forest species drop their foliage before flowering but those of the drier regions carry the flowers while in leaf.\n\nA few species of Kurrajong, as the tree is known in the Dharuk language, are popular garden trees and have been introduced to hot dry regions including the Mediterranean, South Africa and the western United States.

The ARBA is headquartered in Knox, Pennsylvania in the United States. Its membership is composed of rabbit and cavy breeders throughout, fanciers, and pet owners in North America and many countries throughout the world.\n\nThe ARBA serves to promote the domestic rabbit and cavy fancy, as well as commercial rabbit production. The American Rabbit Breeders Association sets official breed standards for recognized rabbit breeds and cavy breeds. Every five years the ARBA publishes a detailed guide entitled \"Standard of Perfection\". This guide is beneficial to rabbit and cavy (guinea pig) breeders, providing a reference to those interested in understanding the conformation standard for the variety of breeds recognized by the ARBA. ARBA recognizes 49 breeds of rabbit and 13 cavy breeds.\nThe ARBA sanctions rabbit shows throughout the year, all over the USA and Canada. These shows, sponsored by local clubs, fairs, and show circuits, give rabbit and cavy fanciers the chance to have their animals examined by educated judges and compared to other breeders' animals and the standard. The ARBA holds a large national convention show once a year, which draws in fanciers from across the country and around the world. The 2005 ARBA convention was documented in the film \"Rabbit Fever\". The 2006 ARBA Convention was held in Ft. Worth, Texas, the 2007 ARBA Convention was held in Grand Rapids, Michigan, 2008 in Louisville, Kentucky, 2009 in San Diego, California, 2010 in Minneapolis, Minnesota, 2011 in Indianapolis, Indiana, 2012 in Wichita, Kansas, 2013 in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, and 2014 in Ft. Worth, Texas.\n\nThis organization helps all levels of rabbit keepers and breeders, including 4-H participants to fanciers, pet owners to commercial producers. The ARBA also produces educational materials such as a guide book, 'Raising Better Rabbits & Cavies', as well as informative books on each registered breed, and a poster with photographs of the recognized breeds of rabbits and cavies, and rabbit registrar and judge training materials. The judges education program is an ongoing program for established judges.\n\nThe ARBA has a standardized judging system in which rabbits are judged against the respective breed standard, set by a 100-point scale, and published in the Standard of Perfection. It is a book detailing all of the recognized breeds in the United States and their attributes. The association has licensed judges since the early 1900s who may judge at sanctioned shows and fairs. The registration system maintains records on all rabbits which have passed a registration examination to ensure the animals are healthy and meet the ARBA Standard for the rabbits' breed. ARBA licensed registrars conduct the examination. Registrations are ranked Red, White and Blue to distinguish how many ancestors of the subject rabbit have been previously registered.\n\nThe ARBA Library, located at the headquarters in Knox, Pennsylvania, houses the world's largest single repository of books and writings on domestic rabbits. It is an archival library, not a lending library. It holds over 10,000 items/pieces, which are housed in the collection, and it continues to constantly grow. The next largest similar collection is at the United States National Agricultural Library in Maryland, and it holds about 1,300 pieces. The British National Library, London also has an extensive collection. Access to the Library for research by members is available by appointment only.\n\nThe ARBA offers a Youth Scholarship program for high school graduates who wish to further their education.

The station is owned by West Palm Beach, Florida-based Ion Media Networks (the former Paxson Communications). KPPX-TV's offices are located on Camelback Road on the northeast side of Phoenix, and its transmitter is located atop South Mountain on the city's south side.\n\nIn February 1981, during an open window for low-power TV station applications, San Bernardino, California-based Community Service Television Company applied for a construction permit to build a translator station on channel 51, to serve Phoenix from atop South Mountain.\n\nTwo years later, on March 28, 1983, Saul Dresner filed a petition with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to allot UHF channel 51 to Tolleson, Arizona, for a full power television station. He presented sufficient evidence to support the allotment and expressed interest in applying for a station, and the FCC released a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on June 9. On May 29, 1984, having received Mexican concurrence, the FCC allotted UHF channel 51 to Tolleson.\n\nOn November 23, Great Arizona Broadcasting Co., owned in part by Dresner, submitted an application to build a full power television station on the new allocation. More than twenty competing applications followed, and the FCC set up a hearing before an administrative law judge to determine which applicant would be the most qualified to build and operate the new station. Great Arizona Broadcasting subsequently withdrew its application, and on November 18, 1987, Judge Edward Luton released a decision granting the application of Aztec Broadcasting Corp., and denying the nine applications which remained.\n\nSeveral of the denied applicants appealed the decision, and the FCC scheduled a hearing before a Review Board on May 6, 1988, to present exceptions to the initial decision. After hearing the arguments, the Review Board reversed the initial decision, and granted a permit to Hector Garcia Salvatierra instead. The FCC granted the construction permit on December 21, 1988. More appeals followed, and on September 5, 1990, the FCC released a Memorandum Opinion and Order upholding the decision of the Review Board. The decision was again appealed, this time to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, and on October 7, 1991, the Court of Appeals upheld the decision of the FCC Review Board.\n\nThe new station was originally proposed for bilingual operations using stereo and separate audio program, but activity on the construction permit stopped. In March 1993, while the full power construction permit remained inactive, the FCC issued a construction permit for the low power translator station that had submitted an application twelve years earlier. The permit was valid until September 1994, and the new station received the call sign K51EI. K51EI was not constructed in the allotted time, and shortly before the permit expired, Community Service Television Company requested a six-month extension, which was granted in December 1994. However, in January 1995, Salvatierra secured a site license to build his station's facilities on South Mountain, then requested and received the call letters KAJW the following month. The K51EI permit was allowed to expire in June 1995, and in February 1996, the permit was canceled and call sign deleted.\n\nOn July 31, 1996, Salvatierra entered into an agreement with Paxson Communications (now Ion Media Networks). Under terms of the agreement, Salvatierra created a new ownership entity called America 51, L.P., sold 49% interest of the new company to Paxson for $5.4 million, transferred the construction permit and site license to Paxson to build the television station, and gave them the right to purchase the remainder of the company for $6.6 million once the TV station had been on air for one year. Salvatierra filed the pro forma application the following week to assign the construction permit from Hector Garcia Salvatierra to America 51, L.P.\n\nThe station changed its call letters to KPPX in March 1998 to reflect its pending affiliation with Paxson's new Pax TV network (now Ion Television), and the station signed on the air February 15, 1999, broadcasting under Program Test Authority until its license was granted on April 20, 2000. Salvatierra sold the remaining interest in the company to Paxson Communications in November 2000.\n\nIn 1997, the FCC specified UHF channel 52 as the transition digital channel for KPPX-TV and granted a construction permit to build transition facilities on March 1, 2001. The station began digital operations pursuant to Program Test Authority on November 1, 2002, and the FCC granted the license to cover digital operations on December 20. Because its pre-transition digital channel was outside the range of core frequencies designated by the FCC (channels 2-51)—the high band UHF channels (52-69) being removed from broadcasting use as a result of the transition—KPPX-TV chose channel 51 for its permanent digital television operations, where it would move at the end of the digital transition, which, at the time, was scheduled for February 17, 2009. Although the DTV Delay Act became law on February 11, 2009 postponing the required analog shutoff until June 12, 2009, KPPX made the decision to proceed with final conversion on February 17, which was approved by the FCC.\n\nKPPX-TV shut down its analog signal on February 17, 2009, the original target date for full-power television stations in the United States to transition from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate (which Congress had moved the previous month to June 12). The station's digital signal relocated from its pre-transition UHF channel 52, which was among the high band UHF channels (52-69) that were removed from broadcasting use as a result of the transition, to its analog-era UHF channel 51.\n\nIn January 2016, KPPX-TV submitted a petition to the FCC to change RF channel from 51 to 31 as part of an agreement to allow T-Mobile to begin service in the adjacent 700 MHz band. Finding that the petition warranted consideration, the FCC released a Notice of Proposed Rule Making (NPRM) in April, and approved the Tolleson allotment change in June. The following month, KPPX-TV submitted an application to change channels, which was immediately approved by the FCC. The station completed the move to channel 31 in October.\n\nKPPX-TV was assigned channel 14 in the FCC Spectrum Repack, and was scheduled to change channels in Phase 10, to be completed by July 3, 2020. However, citing concerns of signal interference between channel 14 and the adjacent land mobile band at 460 MHz - 470 MHz, the station asserted that it was unable to construct facilities that would not cause prohibited interference. The FCC agreed, and allowed KPPX-TV to request alternate facilities during the first priority filing window. The station has requested to remain on channel 31.\n\nOn March 12, 2007, during a 9 p.m. airing of an Ion Life rebroadcast of a Tom Brokaw-hosted NBC special, \"State of U.S. Health Care\", a station employee inserted about 30 seconds of a pornographic film into the broadcast, prompting telephone calls to local news media outlets and the local cable provider, Cox Communications. Parent company Ion Media Networks conducted a rigorous investigation into what they called \"an intolerable act of human sabotage\", and shortly thereafter, announced that the employee found to be responsible had been fired, threatening further legal action.\n\nFrom 2001 until 2005, when NBC entered into a shared services agreement with Pax TV, KPPX aired tape delays of KPNX's 6:00 p.m. and 10:00 p.m. newscasts at 6:30 p.m. and 10:30 p.m.\n\n"}

Cooper\n\nAnna Julia Haywood Cooper (August 10, 1858 – February 27, 1964) was an American author, educator, sociologist, speaker, Black Liberation activist, and one of the most prominent African-American scholars in United States history. \n\nBorn into slavery in 1858, Cooper went on to receive a world-class education and claim power and prestige in academic and social circles. Upon receiving her PhD in history from the Sorbonne in 1924, Cooper became the fourth African-American woman to earn a doctoral degree. She was also a prominent member of Washington, D.C.'s African-American community and a member of Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority.\n\nCooper made contributions to social science fields, particularly in sociology. She is sometimes called \"the mother of Black Feminism.\"\n\nAnna \"Annie\" Julia Cooper (née Haywood) was born a slave in Raleigh, North Carolina, in 1858. She and her mother, Hannah Stanley Haywood, were owned by George Washington Haywood (1802–1890), one of the sons of North Carolina's longest serving state treasurer John Haywood, who helped found the University of North Carolina, but whose estate was later forced to repay missing funds. Either George, in whose household her mother was a house slave, or his brother, Dr. Fabius Haywood, in whose household her older brother Andrew was a slave, were probably Anna's father; Anna's mother refused to clarify paternity. George became state attorney for Wake County and with a brother owned a plantation in Greene County, Alabama. \n\nCooper worked as a domestic servant in the Haywood home and had two older brothers, Andrew J. Haywood and Rufus Haywood. Andrew, a slave of Fabius J. Haywood, he later served in the Spanish–American War. Rufus was also born a slave and became the leader of the musical group \"Stanley's Band\".\n\nIn 1868, when Cooper was nine years old, she received a scholarship and began her education at the newly-opened Saint Augustine's Normal School and Collegiate Institute in Raleigh, founded by the local Episcopal diocese for the purpose of training teachers to educate former slaves and their families. The Reverend J. Brinton offered Cooper a scholarship to help pay for her expenses. According to Mark S. Giles, a Cooper biographer, \"the educational levels offered at St. Augustine ranged from primary to high school, including trade-skill training.\" During her 14 years at St. Augustine's, she distinguished herself as a bright and ambitious student who showed equal promise in both liberal arts and analytical disciplines such as mathematics and science; her subjects included languages (Latin, French, Greek), English literature, math, and science. Although the school had a special track reserved for women – dubbed the \"Ladies' Course\" – and the administration actively discouraged women from pursuing higher-level courses, Cooper fought for her right to take a course reserved for men, by demonstrating her scholastic ability. During this period, St. Augustine's pedagogical emphasis was on training young men for the ministry and preparing them for additional training at four-year universities. One of these men, George A. C. Cooper, would later become her husband. He died after only two years of marriage.\n\nCooper's academic excellence enabled her to work as a tutor for younger children, which also helped her pay for her educational expenses. After completing her studies, she remained at the institution as an instructor. In the 1883–84 school year she taught classics, modern history, higher English, and vocal and instrumental music; she is not listed as faculty in the 1884–85 year, but in the 1885–86 year she is listed as \"Instructor in Classic, Rhetoric, Etc.\" Her husband's early death may have contributed to her ability to continue teaching; had she stayed married, she might have been encouraged or required to withdraw from the university to become a housewife.\n\nAfter her husband's death, Cooper entered Oberlin College in Ohio, where she continued to follow the course of study designated for men, graduating in 1884. Given her academic qualifications, she was admitted as a sophomore. She often attempted to take four classes, rather than three as was prescribed by the College; she also was attracted to Oberlin by its reputation for music, but was unable to take as many classes in piano as she would have wished. Among her classmates were fellow black women Ida Gibbs (later Hunt) and Mary Church Terrell. At Oberlin, she was part of the \"LLS\", \"one of the two literary societies for women, whose regular programs featured lectures by distinguished speakers as well as singers and orchestras\". After teaching briefly at Wilberforce College, Cooper returned to St. Augustine's in 1885. She then went back to Oberlin and earned an M.A. in Mathematics in 1887.\n\nIn 1900 she made her first trip to Europe, to participate in the First Pan-African Conference in London. After visiting the cathedral towns of Scotland and England, she went to Paris for the World Exposition. \"After a week at the Exposition she went to Oberammergau to see the Passion Play, thence to Munich and other German towns, and then to Italy through Rome, Naples, Venice, Pompeii, Mt. Vesuvius, and Florence.\"\n\nShe later moved to Washington, DC. In 1892, Anna Cooper, Helen Appo Cook, Ida B. Bailey, Charlotte Forten Grimké, Mary Jane Peterson, Mary Church Terrell, and Evelyn Shaw formed the Colored Women's League in Washington, D.C. The goals of the service-oriented club were to promote unity, social progress and the best interests of the African-American community. Helen Cook was elected president.\n\nCooper would develop a close friendship with Charlotte Forten Grimké – Cooper began teaching Latin at M Street High School, becoming principal in 1901. She later became entangled in a controversy involving the differing attitudes about black education, as she advocated for a model of classical education espoused by W. E. B. Du Bois, \"designed to prepare eligible students for higher education and leadership\", rather than the vocational program that was promoted by Booker T. Washington. As a result of this, she left the school. Later, she was recalled to M Street, and she fit her work on her doctoral thesis into \"nooks and crannies of free time\". \nA Voice from the South\n\nDuring her years as a teacher and principal at M Street High School, Cooper also completed her first book, \"A Voice from the South: By a Black Woman of the South\", published in 1892, and delivered many speeches calling for civil rights and women's rights. Perhaps her most well-known volume of writing, \"A Voice from the South,\" is widely viewed as one of the first articulations of black feminism. The book advanced a vision of self-determination through education and social uplift for African-American women. Its central thesis was that the educational, moral, and spiritual progress of black women would improve the general standing of the entire African-American community. She says that the violent natures of men often run counter to the goals of higher education, so it is important to foster more female intellectuals because they will bring more elegance to education. This view was criticized by some as submissive to the 19th-century cult of true womanhood, but others label it as one of the most important arguments for black feminism in the 19th century. Cooper advanced the view that it was the duty of educated and successful black women to support their underprivileged peers in achieving their goals. The essays in \"A Voice from the South\" also touched on a variety of topics, such as race and racism, gender, the socioeconomic realities of black families, and the administration of the Episcopal Church.\n\nCooper was an author, educator, and public speaker. In 1893, she delivered a paper entitled \"The Intellectual Progress of the Colored Women of the United States since the Emancipation Proclamation\" at the World's Congress of Representative Women in Chicago. She was one of five African-American women invited to speak at this event, along with: Fannie Barrier Williams, Sarah Jane Woodson Early, Hallie Quinn Brown, and Fanny Jackson Coppin.\n\nCooper was also present at the first Pan-African Conference in London, England, in 1900 and delivered a paper entitled \"The Negro Problem in America.\"\n\nIn a 1902 speech she said:\n\nIn 1914, at the age of 56, Cooper began courses for her doctoral degree at Columbia University, but was forced to interrupt her studies in 1915 when she adopted her late half-brother's five children upon their mother's death. Later on she transferred her credits to the University of Paris-Sorbonne, which did not accept her Columbia thesis, an edition of \"Le Pèlerinage de Charlemagne\". Over a decade she researched and composed her dissertation, completing her coursework in 1924. Cooper defended her thesis \"The Attitude of France on the Question of Slavery Between 1789 and 1848\" in 1925. Cooper’s retirement from Washington Colored High School in 1930 was by no means the end of her political activism. The same year she retired, she accepted the position of president at Frelinghuysen University, a school founded to provide classes for DC residents lacking access to higher education. Cooper worked for Frelinghuysen for twenty years, first as president and then as registrar, and left the school only a decade before she passed away in 1964 at the age of 105. At the age of 65, she became the fourth black woman in American history to earn a Doctorate of Philosophy degree. Her work was eventually published in an anthology of medieval French literature, and was requested for classes and the bookstore at Harvard.\n\nCooper's later years were much involved with Frelinghuysen University, of which she was the President. This was an institution providing continuing education to working African Americans at hours that did not interfere with their employment. After the University found servicing its mortgage prohibitive, she moved it to her own house.\n\nOn February 27, 1964, Cooper died in Washington, D.C., at the age of 105. Her memorial was held in a chapel on the campus of Saint Augustine's College, in Raleigh, NC, where her academic career began. She was buried alongside her husband at the City Cemetery in Raleigh.\n\nAlthough the alumni magazine of Cooper's undergraduate alma mater, Oberlin College, praised her in 1924, saying, \"The class of '84 is honored in the achievement of this scholarly and colored alumna,\" yet when she tried to present her edition of \"Le Pèlerinage de Charlemagne\" to the college the next year, it was rejected.\n\nCooper's other writings include her autobiographical booklet \"The Third Step\", about earning her doctorate from the Sorbonne, and a memoir about the Grimké family, entitled \"The Early Years in Washington: Reminiscences of Life with the Grimkés,\" which appeared in \"Personal Recollections of the Grimké Family and the Life and Writings of Charlotte Forten Grimké\" (privately published in 1951).\n\n\nPages 24 and 25 of the 2016 United States passport contain the following quotation:\n\"The cause of freedom is not the cause of a race or a sect, a party or a class – it is the cause of humankind, the very birthright of humanity.\" – Anna Julia Cooper\n\nIn 2009, the United States Postal Service released a commemorative stamp in Cooper's honor.\n\nAlso in 2009, a tuition-free private middle school was opened and named in her honor, the Anna Julia Cooper Episcopal School on historic Church Hill in Richmond, Virginia.\n\nCooper is honored with Elizabeth Evelyn Wright with a feast day on the liturgical calendar of the Episcopal Church (USA) on February 28.\n\nThe Anna Julia Cooper Center on Gender, Race, and Politics in the South at Wake Forest University was established in Anna Cooper's honor. Melissa Harris-Perry is the founding director.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Conceptually, a numerical method starts from an initial point and then takes a short step forward in time to find the next solution point. The process continues with subsequent steps to map out the solution. Single-step methods (such as Euler's method) refer to only one previous point and its derivative to determine the current value. Methods such as Runge–Kutta take some intermediate steps (for example, a half-step) to obtain a higher order method, but then discard all previous information before taking a second step. Multistep methods attempt to gain efficiency by keeping and using the information from previous steps rather than discarding it. Consequently, multistep methods refer to several previous points and derivative values. In the case of \"linear\" multistep methods, a linear combination of the previous points and derivative values is used.\n\nNumerical methods for ordinary differential equations approximate solutions to initial value problems of the form\n\nThe result is approximations for the value of formula_2 at discrete times formula_3:\nwhere formula_5 is the time step (sometimes referred to as formula_6) and formula_7 is an integer.\n\nMultistep methods use information from the previous formula_8 steps to calculate the next value. In particular, a \"linear\" multistep method uses a linear combination of formula_9 and formula_10 to calculate the value of formula_11 for the desired current step. Thus, a linear multistep method is a method of the form\nwith formula_13. The coefficients formula_14 and formula_15 determine the method. The designer of the method chooses the coefficients, balancing the need to get a good approximation to the true solution against the desire to get a method that is easy to apply. Often, many coefficients are zero to simplify the method.\n\nOne can distinguish between explicit and implicit methods. If formula_16, then the method is called \"explicit\", since the formula can directly compute formula_17. If formula_18 then the method is called \"implicit\", since the value of formula_17 depends on the value of formula_20, and the equation must be solved for formula_17. Iterative methods such as Newton's method are often used to solve the implicit formula.\n\nSometimes an explicit multistep method is used to \"predict\" the value of formula_17. That value is then used in an implicit formula to \"correct\" the value. The result is a predictor–corrector method.\n\nConsider for an example the problem\nThe exact solution is formula_24.\n\nA simple numerical method is Euler's method:\nEuler's method can be viewed as an explicit multistep method for the degenerate case of one step.\n\nThis method, applied with step size formula_26 on the problem formula_27, gives the following results:\n\nEuler's method is a one-step method. A simple multistep method is the two-step Adams–Bashforth method\nThis method needs two values, formula_30 and formula_31, to compute the next value, formula_32. However, the initial value problem provides only one value, formula_33. One possibility to resolve this issue is to use the formula_34 computed by Euler's method as the second value. With this choice, the Adams–Bashforth method yields (rounded to four digits):\nThe exact solution at formula_36 is formula_37, so the two-step Adams–Bashforth method is more accurate than Euler's method. This is always the case if the step size is small enough.\n\nThree families of linear multistep methods are commonly used: Adams–Bashforth methods, Adams–Moulton methods, and the backward differentiation formulas (BDFs).\n\nThe Adams–Bashforth methods are explicit methods. The coefficients are formula_38 and formula_39, while the formula_40 are chosen such that the methods have order \"s\" (this determines the methods uniquely).\n\nThe Adams–Bashforth methods with \"s\" = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 are (; ):\n\nThe coefficients formula_40 can be determined as follows. Use polynomial interpolation to find the polynomial \"p\" of degree formula_43 such that\nThe Lagrange formula for polynomial interpolation yields\nThe polynomial \"p\" is locally a good approximation of the right-hand side of the differential equation formula_46 that is to be solved, so consider the equation formula_47 instead. This equation can be solved exactly; the solution is simply the integral of \"p\". This suggests taking\nThe Adams–Bashforth method arises when the formula for \"p\" is substituted. The coefficients formula_40 turn out to be given by\nReplacing formula_51 by its interpolant \"p\" incurs an error of order \"h\", and it follows that the \"s\"-step Adams–Bashforth method has indeed order \"s\" \n\nThe Adams–Bashforth methods were designed by John Couch Adams to solve a differential equation modelling capillary action due to Francis Bashforth. published his theory and Adams' numerical method .\n\nThe Adams–Moulton methods are similar to the Adams–Bashforth methods in that they also have formula_52 and formula_39. Again the \"b\" coefficients are chosen to obtain the highest order possible. However, the Adams–Moulton methods are implicit methods. By removing the restriction that formula_16, an \"s\"-step Adams–Moulton method can reach order formula_55, while an \"s\"-step Adams–Bashforth methods has only order \"s\".\n\nThe Adams–Moulton methods with \"s\" = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 are (; ):\n\nThe derivation of the Adams–Moulton methods is similar to that of the Adams–Bashforth method; however, the interpolating polynomial uses not only the points formula_59, as above, but also formula_60. The coefficients are given by\n\nThe Adams–Moulton methods are solely due to John Couch Adams, like the Adams–Bashforth methods. The name of Forest Ray Moulton became associated with these methods because he realized that they could be used in tandem with the Adams–Bashforth methods as a predictor-corrector pair ; had the same idea. Adams used Newton's method to solve the implicit equation .\n\nThe BDF methods are implicit methods with formula_62 and the other coefficients chosen such that the method attains order \"s\" (the maximum possible). These methods are especially used for the solution of stiff differential equations.\n\nThe central concepts in the analysis of linear multistep methods, and indeed any numerical method for differential equations, are convergence, order, and stability.\n\nThe first question is whether the method is consistent: is the difference equation\na good approximation of the differential equation formula_46? More precisely, a multistep method is \"consistent\" if the local truncation error goes to zero faster than the step size \"h\" as \"h\" goes to zero, where the \"local truncation error\" is defined to be the difference between the result formula_65 of the method, assuming that all the previous values formula_66 are exact, and the exact solution of the equation at time formula_67. A computation using Taylor series shows that a linear multistep method is consistent if and only if\nAll the methods mentioned above are consistent .\n\nIf the method is consistent, then the next question is how well the difference equation defining the numerical method approximates the differential equation. A multistep method is said to have \"order\" \"p\" if the local error is of order formula_69 as \"h\" goes to zero. This is equivalent to the following condition on the coefficients of the methods:\nThe \"s\"-step Adams–Bashforth method has order \"s\", while the \"s\"-step Adams–Moulton method has order formula_71 .\n\nThese conditions are often formulated using the \"characteristic polynomials\"\nIn terms of these polynomials, the above condition for the method to have order \"p\" becomes\nIn particular, the method is consistent if it has order at least one, which is the case if formula_74 and formula_75.\n\nThe numerical solution of a one-step method depends on the initial condition formula_76, but the numerical solution of an \"s\"-step method depend on all the \"s\" starting values, formula_77. It is thus of interest whether the numerical solution is stable with respect to perturbations in the starting values. A linear multistep method is \"zero-stable\" for a certain differential equation on a given time interval, if a perturbation in the starting values of size ε causes the numerical solution over that time interval to change by no more than \"K\"ε for some value of \"K\" which does not depend on the step size \"h\". This is called \"zero-stability\" because it is enough to check the condition for the differential equation formula_78 .\n\nIf the roots of the characteristic polynomial ρ all have modulus less than or equal to 1 and the roots of modulus 1 are of multiplicity 1, we say that the \"root condition\" is satisfied. A linear multistep method is zero-stable if and only if the root condition is satisfied .\n\nNow suppose that a consistent linear multistep method is applied to a sufficiently smooth differential equation and that the starting values formula_79 all converge to the initial value formula_76 as formula_81. Then, the numerical solution converges to the exact solution as formula_81 if and only if the method is zero-stable. This result is known as the \"Dahlquist equivalence theorem\", named after Germund Dahlquist; this theorem is similar in spirit to the Lax equivalence theorem for finite difference methods. Furthermore, if the method has order \"p\", then the global error (the difference between the numerical solution and the exact solution at a fixed time) is formula_83 .\n\nFurthermore, if the method is convergent, the method is said to be \"strongly stable\" if formula_84 is the only root of modulus 1. If it is convergent and all roots of modulus 1 are not repeated, but there is more than one such root, it is said to be \"relatively stable\". Note that 1 must be a root for the method to be convergent; thus convergent methods are always one of these two.\n\nTo assess the performance of linear multistep methods on stiff equations, consider the linear test equation \"y\"' = λ\"y\". A multistep method applied to this differential equation with step size \"h\" yields a linear recurrence relation with characteristic polynomial\nThis polynomial is called the \"stability polynomial\" of the multistep method. If all of its roots have modulus less than one then the numerical solution of the multistep method will converge to zero and the multistep method is said to be \"absolutely stable\" for that value of \"h\"λ. The method is said to be \"A-stable\" if it is absolutely stable for all \"h\"λ with negative real part. The \"region of absolute stability\" is the set of all \"h\"λ for which the multistep method is absolutely stable . For more details, see the section on stiff equations and multistep methods.\n\nConsider the Adams–Bashforth three-step method\n\nOne characteristic polynomial is thus\nwhich has roots formula_88, and the conditions above are satisfied. As formula_84 is the only root of modulus 1, the method is strongly stable.\n\nThe other characteristic polynomial is\n\nformula_90\n\nThese two results were proved by Germund Dahlquist and represent an important bound for the order of convergence and for the A-stability of a linear multistep method. The first Dahlquist barrier was proved in and the second in .\n\nA zero-stable and linear \"q\"-step multistep method cannot attain an order of convergence greater than \"q\" + 1 if \"q\" is odd and greater than \"q\" + 2 if \"q\" is even. If the method is also explicit, then it cannot attain an order greater than \"q\" .\n\nThere are no explicit A-stable and linear multistep methods. The implicit ones have order of convergence at most 2. The trapezoidal rule has the smallest error constant amongst the A-stable linear multistep methods of order 2.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2090870", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2090870", "title": "Australian Capital Television Pty Ltd v Commonwealth", "text": "Australian Capital Television Pty Ltd v Commonwealth\n\nAustralian Capital Television v Commonwealth, was a significant case decided in the High Court of Australia on 30 September 1992. It concerned the constitutional validity of Part IIID of the \"Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures Act\" 1991, which regulated political advertising during election campaigns, and required broadcasters to broadcast political advertisements free of charge at other times. The High Court found the laws to be invalid, since they contravened an implied freedom of political communication in the Australian Constitution.\n\nIn 1992, the Government of Australia (\"the Commonwealth\") under Prime Minister Bob Hawke passed the \"Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures Act 1991\", which inserted part IIID into the \"Broadcasting Act 1942\". The changes had a number of effects, the most important of which prohibited the broadcasting of politically related material on electronic media such as radio and television during the period leading up to a State or Federal election (except in news, current affairs or talkback programs). The laws also obliged broadcasters to provide \"free time\" to political parties to air advertisements. Kim Beazley, then the Minister for Transport and Communications, said that the changes were designed to limit corruption, and prevent donors to political parties from exerting undue influence, by restricting the amount of political advertising that could be broadcast. He said that due to the practical cost of advertising, it was only the major parties and very wealthy individuals who could afford to broadcast advertisements. The Government said they had wanted to avoid a situation such as that in the United States, where it is virtually impossible for anyone but the very rich to participate in the political process.\n\nWith some exceptions, the laws prohibited broadcasters from broadcasting matter for or on behalf of the government or government agencies, and from broadcasting political advertisements (\"matter intended or likely to affect voting in the election\", or matter explicitly referring to the election) on behalf of themselves or other individuals during an election period. The \"free time\" would be divided between the parties based on the amount of representation they had in the Parliament, with only five percent available to other groups, who had to apply for an allocation of free time.\n\nThe eight plaintiffs in the case were commercial television broadcasters who held broadcasting licences under the \"Broadcasting Act\". They asked the High Court to declare that Part IIID of the act was invalid. In a related action which was heard at the same time, the Government of New South Wales also challenged the laws, particularly their application to by-elections. The Government of South Australia intervened in the case in support of the Commonwealth.\n\nThe most important argument made by the plaintiffs was that the new laws interfered with a right to free political speech which was implied in the Constitution. They also argued that the parts of the Act requiring that broadcasters give \"free time\" to certain people was an unjust acquisition of property. The Government of New South Wales argued that the laws were discriminatory against the states and they interfered with the proper business of State Governments.\n\nThe principal argument from the plaintiffs was that the changes to the \"Broadcasting Act\" contravened an implied right to freedom of participation and communication in political processes. They argued that this right to free political speech arose from the system of representative government which is provided by the Constitution, or alternatively, it arose from the \"common citizenship of the Australian people.\" Sir Maurice Byers QC, who acted for the plaintiffs, paraphrasing former Justice Isaac Isaacs argued that the principle that governments are responsible to the citizens who elect them \"permeates the Constitution, forming part of the fabric on which the written words of the Constitution are superimposed,\" and as such, all voters should be entitled to make comment on political issues.\n\nThe plaintiffs argued that since a right to free political communication was recognised in other parliamentary democracies, such as in the United States by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, and in Canada by the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, it should be recognised in Australia. They said that because the provisions in Part IIID limited the allocation of \"free time\" to people or groups already represented in the Parliaments, new parties or people not in the Parliament would not be able to express their views.\n\nThe Commonwealth argued that the laws enhanced rather than diminished the electoral process, because they prevented corruption, and allowed parties which did not have large amounts of money to have access to radio and television broadcasting. They said that the Parliament has valid powers to protect the integrity of the electoral process under sections 10, 29, 31, 51(36) and 51(39) of the Constitution. Furthermore, they argued that even if there was some implied right to freedom of political communication, this could not override valid legislation. The Commonwealth also pointed out that similar laws operated in countries such as the United Kingdom, France, Norway and Sweden, and that countries such as Canada, Germany, Japan and New Zealand had a system of allocating free broadcasting time for political purposes during election periods.\n\nThe Government of South Australia, who intervened in support of the Commonwealth, said that if the framers of the Constitution had intended to include provisions for a right of free speech as in the United States Constitution, they would have done so. They said that although some freedom of communication could reasonably be implied into the Constitution, the parts of the Act in question did not have the effect of preventing \"free and meaningful elections\" from taking place, and so the laws were not invalid.\n\nThe High Court agreed that the new part IIID of the \"Broadcasting Act\" had the effect of limiting the freedoms previously enjoyed by citizens to publicly discuss political matters. However, the question remained as to whether there was some sort of Constitutional basis for these freedoms, or whether the Commonwealth was justified in restricting them. While the court agreed that similar laws had been put in place overseas, that did not change the fact that the laws impaired freedom of communication, and privileged those political parties or interest groups who were already represented in the Parliament. The laws would not only disadvantage candidates challenging sitting members, but would severely hinder groups such as trade unions, charities or employers' groups, who may very well have a legitimate desire to make political statements.\n\nThe plaintiffs also argued that to force broadcasters to give portions of \"free time\" to the represented political parties and members of parliament had the effect of taking away their right to charge money for broadcasting advertisements. They suggested that taking away their advertising time and in effect giving it to the legislators constituted an acquisition of property by the Commonwealth, which according to section 51(xxxi) of the Constitution, has to be done \"on just terms.\"\n\nThe Commonwealth argued that the laws made no unjust acquisition of property, since broadcasting licences were not immune to being modified by the Parliament. They said that it was fair and just to require broadcasters to provide a limited amount of free service in the public interest. In any event, the Commonwealth suggested that \"free time\" granted by the Act was not a form of property anyway, since it could not be transferred to other people, one of the essential features of any form of property.\n\nUltimately the court did not decide on this issue, although Justice Brennan said that he agreed with the Commonwealth's argument that the \"free time\" was not a form of property.\n\nThe Government of New South Wales, in addition to supporting the claims of the other plaintiffs, also argued that Part IIID of the \"Broadcasting Act\" was invalid because it interfered with the executive functions of the States, and contravened sections 106 and 107 of the Constitution which protects the individual State Constitutions. They said that to interfere with the right of State Governments to make political advertisements went far beyond any legitimate power given to the Parliament of Australia by the Constitution. They also said that in any event, the changes to the Act should not apply to by-elections.\n\nThe Commonwealth argued that Part IIID of the Act did not single out the States, nor interfere with their proper activities, since State elections were treated in exactly the same way as Federal elections were.\n\nThe court decided that a right to freedom of political communication was essential to the system of representative government provided for in the Constitution. The court expressed the view that the reason why Australia does not have a bill of rights is because the framers of the Constitution believed that since Australia had a system of representative government, which gave all voters an equal share in political power, laws to protect rights were simply not necessary. To undermine the system of representative government was contrary to this trust which the people gave to the Parliaments, and was not permitted by the Constitution. Although this right is not an absolute one, it is still a right which allows for free and public political discussion.\n\nThe court also decided that the relevant laws, contained in Part IIID of the \"Broadcasting Act\", were invalid because there was no reasonable justification for the way they restricted the freedom of political communication. The court decided that the laws also impaired certain functions of the States in terms of their rights to make political advertisements, and so the laws were also invalid for that reason.\n\nThe case was one of the earliest in a series of cases in which the High Court found implied rights in the Constitution. This trend reached a High-point in \"Theophanous v Herald & Weekly Times Ltd\", which found that the implied right to freedom of political communication could be used as a defence in a defamation action. Although that is no longer the case, the limited right to freedom of communication remains. It was emphasised in later cases like \"Lange v ABC\", that political communication was not a personal right, rather a constitutional restriction on legislative power.\n\nIn discussing the nature of representative government, Chief Justice Mason expressed the view that although the Constitution originally drew its authority from the British Imperial Parliament, it would indeed be appropriate in modern times to recognise that Australian sovereignty derives its force from the Australian people.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2090875", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2090875", "title": "Manus Province", "text": "Manus Province\n\nManus Province is the smallest province in Papua New Guinea with a land area of 2,100 km², but with more than 220,000 km² of water. The provincial town of Manus is Lorengau and the total population is 60,485 (2011 census).\n\nThe province is made up of the Admiralty Islands (a group of 18 islands in the Bismarck Archipelago), as well as Wuvulu Island and nearby atolls in the west, which collectively are referred to as the Western Islands. The largest island in the group is Manus Island where Lorengau and an Australian immigration detention centre are located.\n\nThe primary industries are coconut and cocoa cultivation, and bêche-de-mer (sea cucumber) fishing. Among scuba divers, the Islands; particularly Bipi Island; have a reputation as a good diving destination with colorful marine life, coral reefs, shipwrecks, and clear water.\n\nDue to its population size, Manus Province only has two Members of Parliament, a Governor and an open member. Charlie Benjamin is the current Governor while his counterpart in the open seat is Job Pomat. Unlike most provinces in Papua New Guinea, general elections are usually peaceful and carried out efficiently on the Island. Traditional \"Lapans\" - village leaders, are also respected figures in the communities.\n\nThe archipelago became a German protectorate in 1880 and an Australian mandate in 1920.\n\nDuring World War II the archipelago was occupied by the Japanese who established a small base in April 1942 near the village of Rossun on Manus Island. They also built the first landing strip entirely by manpower at the eastern Point of Los Negros Island in Momote.\n\nOn 29 February 1944 during World War II, the Admiralty Islands were invaded in Operation Brewer led by American General Douglas MacArthur. The Americans quickly built a big base at Seeadler Harbor, including harbour, wharves and an airbase, which became an important base for the further war operations in New Guinea as well as on the Philippines. The base is today used by the PNG Defence Force. It was made famous by the work there and writing of it by the New York anthropologist Margaret Mead from the 1950s through '70s.\n\nThe Manus friarbird, known locally as the chauka, is represented on the Manus provincial flag. Designer of the Manus Province flag Luke Bulei explained his reasons for its design in 1977: chauka is only found in the Manus province; it heralds dawn and signals sunset; it often warns us of dangers; and lastly, it informs us of the success or otherwise of a forthcoming hunting trip. He added that NBC Radio Station had changed its name to Maus Bilong Chauka several years before. He explained that the colour brown on the flag represents the inland people and the blue represents the island people. The other important symbol on the flag is the green snail, which is also unique to the Manus province.\n\nManus Province has a single district, which contains one urban (Lorengau) and eleven rural Local Level Government (LLG) areas. Manus District has the highest number of LLG' s than any other district in Papua New Guinea. For census purposes, the LLG areas are subdivided into wards and those into census units.\n\nThe province was governed by a decentralised provincial administration, headed by a Premier, from 1977 to 1995. Following reforms taking effect that year, notably the introduction of the Organic Law on Provincial Government and Local Level Government 1995, the national government reassumed some powers, and the role of Premier was replaced by a position of Governor, to be held by the winner of the province-wide seat in the National Parliament of Papua New Guinea.\n\nThe province and each district is represented by a Member of the National Parliament. There is one provincial electorate and each district is an open electorate. Job Pomat as Manus District Open Member elected into office in 2016 makes history as the first politician from the province to be elected as the Speaker of the Parliament of Papua New Guinea in 2016. \n\nSoccer and hockey are among the most common outdoor sports played in the province. Rugby League, Union, basketball, volleyball and netball are gaining popularity in on the Island. Due to the lack of proper sporting facilities, most talented sportsmen and women find it hard to make it on the national scenes. However, the introduction of the PNG Grassrooots Games has helped expose some of these hidden talents.\n\n"}
{"id": "2090878", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2090878", "title": "Greater ani", "text": "Greater ani\n\nThe greater ani (\"Crotophaga major\") is a large bird in the cuckoo family. It is a breeding species from Panama and Trinidad through tropical South America to northern Argentina. It is sometimes referred to as the black cuckoo.\n\nThis ani is found in mangrove swamps, semi-open woodland near water, and the edges of forests. It is a seasonal migrant in at least some parts of its range. The nest, built communally by several pairs, is a deep cup lined with leaves and placed usually high in a tree. A number of females lay their chalky deep blue eggs in the nest and then share incubation and feeding. These breeding groups may also include non-breeding helpers. Nests have been found containing 3–10 eggs. In a recent longterm study, it was found that around 15% of females lay their eggs in the nest of another nesting group. This conspecific brood parasitism happens primarily when a female has lost her own clutch to predation.\n\nThe greater ani is about long and weighs .

It has produced movies of all genres; and is the oldest surviving movie studio in the Philippines.\n\nIn the beginning, Mother Lily and her father Remy put up a popcorn stand at the Podmon Theater in C.M. Recto, Manila (which served as the head office of Regal before it moved to the Valencia studio). Regal Films was started by distributing foreign films, such as \"That Man from Istanbul\", \"Marsha\" and \"All Mine to Give\", pouring funds for Mother Lily to produce a local movie. In 1976, Mother Lily asked permission from her father to produce her first project, \"Kayod sa Umaga, Kayod sa Gabi\". It became a big hit then in theaters. Alma Moreno was the first star who had an exclusive contract with Regal, becoming the first of the Regal Babies.\n\nIn its early years, Regal Films produced local movies with a \"mature\" and \"daring\" style, although it also produced \"wholesome\" pictures. In 1987, it ventured in local television; \"Regal Television\" produced several entertainment programs in '80s and '90s and aired in three different channels, ABS-CBN 2, GMA 7 and IBC 13.\n\nIn the late 1980s Regal Television was a weekly Sunday programming block featuring the country's biggest artists from Regal Films (eg. Gabby Concepcion, Snooky Serna, Manilyn Reynes, Sheryl Cruz, etc). In 1987 Regal co-produced \"Mother Studio Presents\" with GMA Network and featured monthly guest artists; and \"Regal Drama Presents\" with ABS CBN and featured Maricel Soriano. In 1989 ABS-CBN took over majority of her production on the latter program and renamed it as \"The Maricel Drama Special\".

He was the son of Guy of Montfort and Helvis of Ibelin (daughter of Balian of Ibelin).\n\nAt his father's death at the siege of Varilhes in the Albigensian Crusade in 1228, he succeeded to his French seigneuries. His first wife was Eleonore de Courtenay (d. bef. 1230), daughter of Peter II of Courtenay. Philip joined the party of his uncle, John of Ibelin, against the representatives of Frederick II. In 1244, he was created Constable of Jerusalem, but was subordinate to Walter IV of Brienne at the Battle of La Forbie. Philip was one of the few Christian knights to escape the disaster there. In 1246, Henry I of Cyprus, then Regent of Jerusalem, created him Lord of Tyre as a reward for his services to the baronial party. While the legality of this grant was somewhat dubious, it was recognized by Hugh I c. 1269; but Hugh reserved the right to buy back the fief.\n\nPhilip was married a second time, after 1240, to Maria of Antioch-Armenia, the elder daughter of Raymond-Roupen of Antioch and hence Lady of Toron and pretender of Armenia.\n\nHe joined the Seventh Crusade, and was employed as the ambassador of Louis IX of France in negotiations for a truce and retreat from Damietta. In 1256, he expelled the Venetians from Tyre, an action which helped to precipitate the War of St. Sabas.

In 1266, he lost Toron to the Sultan Baibars; but even in Philip's old age, Baibars feared both his energetic leadership and the possible success of his appeals to Europe for aid.

In the serial, drug smugglers Tryst (Lewis Fiander) and Dymond (Geoffrey Bateman) try to smuggle the deadly drug Vraxoin on the ship contained in alien beings called the Mandrels.\n\nThe TARDIS arrives close to an unstable area on the interstellar cruise ship \"Empress\", which has emerged from hyperspace at the same co-ordinates as the trade ship \"Hecate\", causing a dimensional crossover that the Fourth Doctor and Romana realise must be repaired. The Doctor offers his services to detach the two craft. Rigg, captain of the \"Empress\", is suspicious of the Doctor’s alias as a representative of Galactic Salvage but nevertheless agrees to let him try and separate the two craft by reversing the smaller craft at full thrust. The Doctor is accompanied on this task by Rigg's co-pilot, Secker, who, it becomes apparent, is a drug addict. He is addicted to the organic substance Vraxoin, whose origins are unknown, but whose properties are lethal and dangerous. Secker heads off alone into the unstable area and while there is attacked by a clawed monster and left for dead. K9 arrives from the TARDIS and is tasked with cutting through the locked ships.\n\nAlso aboard the \"Empress\" are a zoologist named Tryst and his assistant Della, with their CET (Continual Event Transmuter) Machine, which stores portions of planets on electro-magnetic crystals. Their collection is large and ethically dubious. Their most recent stop was on the planet Eden where one of their expedition was killed, but both Tryst and Della are reluctant to provide too many details. Romana, however, examines the Eden projection when she is on her own and is sure she has seen eyes staring out at her from the dark and forbidding jungle. When she later looks at the projection again an insect appears from within it and stings her.\n\nThe Doctor and Rigg find the wounded Secker and send him to the sickbay where he dies. When the Doctor finds Secker's drugs stash he is prevented from acting when someone stuns him and steals the evidence. Once he has recovered, he returns with Rigg and K9 to cut through the power source. Once a hole is made a roaring creature appears, flexing its vicious claws.\n\nK9 repels the creature with blaster fire while the Doctor and Rigg refit the segment of the craft. The Doctor continues to try to separate the two ships while also trying to source the Vraxoin on the craft. Rigg is positive there are no drugs on his craft, but events soon take a sinister turn, which proves him wrong. When Romana wakes up an unseen hand spikes her refresher drink with the drug, but it is Rigg who ends up drinking it. He soon starts to show signs of addiction and altered perception and heads off alone as his cravings grow.\n\nAfter the Doctor and K9 fail once more to separate the two ships, he spots a silver-suited stranger and pursues him through the passenger deck and into the blurred area between ships. The Doctor loses his quarry, but manages to relieve him of a radiation band, which he dropped and proves that he was on Tryst’s expeditionary team in the past. The clawed monsters are loose near there. When the Doctor flees back to the \"Empress\" he discovers Rigg has become addicted and Tryst accuses Della of smuggling Vraxoin, in league with her late partner Stott, who was killed on Eden. Two Azurian Customs and Excise officers now board the craft, Fisk and Costa, and start to suspect the Doctor of smuggling because of the traces of Vraxoin in his pocket. The Doctor and Romana make a break for it and head to the CET Machine room where they evade capture by leaping directly into the projection.\n\nInside the projection, the Doctor and Romana are menaced by the jungle plants and must hide to avoid the clawed monsters, which obviously originate from Eden and roam freely in this section of the planet. They soon meet up with the fugitive previously sighted by them both, Stott, who takes them to his sheltered cubicle. It seems that he is a Major in the Intelligence Section of the Space Corp and has been hiding in the projection for the past 183 days while he tries to establish the source of the Vraxoin, which he knows is from Eden but not from which organic source. He also names the vicious creatures as Mandrels. The trio exit the projection and return to find the \"Empress\" under siege from the marauding beasts, which have now started killing the passengers (as shown in the picture above). Rigg too is killed, shot down by Fisk during a mad search for Vrax.\n\nThe Doctor, Romana and K9 evade the creatures while trying once more to separate the two spacecraft. In the process, the Doctor incinerates one of the Mandrels, which disintegrates into raw Vraxoin. The beasts are evidently the source of the drug. He reapplies himself to the technical task and, with the help of his companions, the ships are finally parted – but the Doctor disappears from the \"Empress\" in the process.\n\nThe separation has been a success, with the elusive Dymond having returned to his own craft at the right time. Fisk warns him not to leave too quickly, but Dymond is keen to get away. The Doctor is also on the \"Hecate\", having been caught up in the separation of the two ships, and, without being noticed, soon finds evidence of Dymond's complicity in the drug running project. Dymond returns to the \"Empress\" by shuttle, and the Doctor smuggles himself on board. Back on the \"Empress\", Romana finds Della and confides in her that Stott is still alive, but Della is soon arrested by the Customs men and they are separated.\n\nThe Doctor rejoins Romana on the \"Empress\" and says he has seen evidence that the smugglers are planning to use an intuca laser to transport the Eden projection between the two crafts. He is now certain that Dymond’s ally is Tryst and, when Stott arrives, he also confirms the source of the Vraxoin. Fisk and Costa turn up to arrest the Doctor, but Stott pulls rank and warns them to back off. In another part of the craft, Tryst is reunited with Della and confesses all about his part in the smuggling racket. She flees when a Mandrel arrives and distracts Tryst, who is rapidly trying to escape with Dymond. They head back to the \"Hecate\".\n\nThe Doctor has meanwhile rounded up the Mandrels using K9’s dog whistle, having worked out they are pacified by ultrasonics. He leads them all back into the projection and then slips out, leaving the creatures trapped. His next task is to reverse the CET transfer process to stop the smugglers getting away with the Vraxoin supply. After allowing Tryst and Dymond to transport the Eden projection to the \"Hecate\", he activates the CET and traps them within a new projection – they are ready for the Customs Officers to walk in and arrest them. With the ships separated and the drug runners caught, the Doctor and friends slip away back to the TARDIS with the Eden project. They restore everything to their home planets and can only hope no one else discovers the secret of the Mandrels.\n\nThis story would be the final \"Doctor Who\" serial written by Bob Baker, who worked on it alone, rather than with his usual writing partner Dave Martin.\n\nAlan Bromly is credited with directing this story, but he quit partway through filming as a result of a vehement dispute with Tom Baker. As a result, producer Graham Williams wound up having to complete the director's duties uncredited. The unpleasantness of this whole incident led Williams to decide that he wished to leave the series. Bromly never directed another story for the series and in fact went into full retirement soon afterwards.\n\nThe British tabloid newspaper \"The Sun\" wrote that the Mandrels were terrifying monsters, as no publicity shots had been taken for them (which, as later reported, was untrue). However, the majority of critics were more scathing and many of them saw the Mandrels as being thoroughly unconvincing (particularly the Doctor Who Appreciation Society, which described them as \"cute rejects from \"The Muppet Show\"\"). Writer Bob Baker on the recent DVD release also expressed his disappointment with the Mandrel design.\n\nMark Braxton of \"Radio Times\" considered the serial to be \"something of a flawed diamond\". Braxton noted that the sets were \"perfectly decent, for the most part\" but thought the Mandrels were \"the least frightening monster the show ever produced.\" The review concluded by stating \"Overall, this sobering, sideways take on Paradise Lost deserves respect, in conception and narrative if not always in the finished product.\"\n\nMM Gilroy-Sinclair of Starburst said the show was \"a story with some big ideas and some shoddy production values.\" He was unimpressed by the Mandrels and the \"plodding\" story but praised the performances of Tom Baker and Lalla Ward. Despite his criticisms, Gilroy-Sinclair ended his review by stating \"it actually has some wonderful moments, it is surprisingly mature; it’s clever and has some fabulous acting.\"\n\nCultbox's Malcolm Stewart described the serial as \"Serious-minded but facetiously performed\". However, he also stated that \"For all the deficiencies in presentation, Nightmare of Eden is still a story with real science and genuine imagination at its heart.\"\n\nA novelisation of this serial, written by Terrance Dicks, was published by Target Books in August 1980.\n\n\"Nightmare of Eden\" was released on VHS in January 1999. It was released on DVD on 2 April 2012. This serial was scheduled to be released as part of the Doctor Who DVD Files in Issue 134 on 19 February 2014.\n"}

His long career has been plagued by injuries and he did not play competitive tennis between September 2008 and January 2010. However, in December 2009 he scheduled to play at the ATP Champions Tour tournament in London, where he made his debut at the senior tour.\n\nEl Aynaoui is an extremely popular figure in Morocco. He received a gold medal – the nation's highest sporting honor – from King Mohammed VI. In a 2003 poll by leading Moroccan newspaper \"L'Economiste\", readers named El Aynaoui their favorite role model for society, ahead of the prime minister and athletics star Hicham El Guerrouj. The center court of the Royal Tennis Club in Marrakech is named after El Aynaoui.\n\nIn 1990, at the age of 18, El Aynaoui traveled to Bradenton, Florida, to spend a week at the Nick Bollettieri Tennis Academy, after which he decided to turn professional. He continued to hone his skills at the academy for the next two years where, in order to afford the fees, he drove the academy bus, cleaned the gym, strung rackets, tossed practice balls to campers, and helped to babysit younger players. He also saved money in a high interest account.\n\nIn 1993, he reached his first top-level Grand Prix singles final in Casablanca, where he lost to the Argentinian player Guillermo Pérez Roldán.\n\nAfter finishing runner-up in three tour events in 1996, El Aynaoui suffered a broken right ankle. He had surgery on his ankle in November that year, but the injury continued to cause him problems. He missed seven months of the season in 1997 and had a second surgery in February 1998. He returned to the tour that summer ranked World Number 444, and enjoyed a run of strong results. He won five Challenger series tournaments and finished runner-up at one top-level event in Santiago. By the end of the year he had improved his ranking to World Number 49, and was named the ATP Comeback Player of the Year for 1998.\n\nIn 1999, El Aynaoui won his first top-level singles title in Amsterdam and the following year he reached the quarter-finals of the Australian Open where he lost to Yevgeny Kafelnikov. El Aynaoui won his second top-level title in 2001 at Bucharest. He was runner-up in Amsterdam that year, losing in the final to Àlex Corretja in a five-set, 53-game match (6–3, 5–7, 7–6, 3–6, 6–4) which was the year's longest tour final. He was also runner-up in Lyon, defeated by Ivan Ljubičić in final.\n\nEl Aynaoui captured two tour titles in 2002 (Doha and Munich), and reached the quarter-finals of the US Open. The following year, he reached the quarter-finals of the Australian and US Opens and finished the season ranked a career-high World Number 14.\n\nThe most famous match of El Aynaoui's career came in the quarter-finals of the Australian Open in 2003. In the Round of 16, El Aynaoui defeated the World No. 1, Lleyton Hewitt, 6–7, 7–6, 7–6, 6–4, in a very high quality match, thus setting up a quarter-final showdown with the up-and-coming American Andy Roddick (who would reach the World No. 1 ranking later that year). The five-set, five-hour match included the then longest fifth set in Grand Slam tennis history (since surpassed by the marathon Wimbledon 2010 match between John Isner and Nicolas Mahut). Roddick won the battle 4–6, 7–6, 4–6, 6–4, 21–19. Both players saved match points before the fifth set ended. El Aynaoui's one match point came in the tenth game of the fifth set, with Roddick serving at 4–5. Roddick saved the match point with a cross-court forehand winner after a short rally. Roddick broke El Aynaoui's serve at 10–10 to go up 11–10 and serve for the match, but El Aynaoui broke straight back for 11–11. Roddick broke El Aynaoui's serve again at 19–19 to serve for the match for the second time at 20–19, with Roddick clinching the match on his second match point.\n\nAfter a three-year hiatus due to injury, El Aynaoui made a comeback to the ATP tour in January 2007, and was awarded a wildcard at the Qatar Open, Doha. He beat former Australian Open winner Thomas Johansson with two tie-breaks in the first round, but was defeated 6–3, 6–4 in the second round by the then World Number 5 and eventual winner Ivan Ljubičić.\n\nIn March 2008, after a seven-month lay-off due to injuries, he won a Futures event in Castelldefels, Spain on clay, and in April he won a challenger event in Chiasso, Switzerland. In May, he reached the semi-finals of the BMW Open in Munich. He was oldest player to reach the semi-finals of an ATP Tour level event since Jimmy Connors in 1993. He also reached the quarter-finals of the Casablanca Open in Morocco, retiring to Juan Mónaco due to an injury in his left calf.\n\nEl Aynaoui made his debut as a wild card at the senior tour in London, the last stop on the tour, joining Stefan Edberg, Patrick Rafter, Cédric Pioline, Pat Cash, Goran Ivanišević, Mark Philippoussis and Greg Rusedski. He won two matches, against Rusedski and Philippoussis.\n\nIn the 2010 Qatar ExxonMobil Open in Doha, Qatar, El Aynaoui received a wildcard to participate in the tournament.\n\nHe played American Ryler DeHeart in the first round of this tournament and won 7–6, 7–6, thus becoming at age 38 the oldest player to win a main tour ATP match since Jimmy Connors in 1995. However, El Aynaoui's run came to an end when he was defeated 6–3, 6–1 by Belgian Steve Darcis.\n\nIn March 2017, at the age of 45, El Aynaoui participated in a $15,000 USD tournament in Manama, Bahrain on the ITF Men's Circuit.

It originates at the northwest extremity of Lake Sevan and flows south through the Kotayk Province and Armenia's capital, Yerevan; the lake in turn is fed by several streams. In the Ararat plain it joins the Aras River along the border with Turkey. A series of hydro-electric plants have been constructed on the river. Its waters are in demand to irrigate crops.\n\nThe river was called Ildaruni in Urartian. In Turkic it's known as Zangu, Zanga, Zangi, or Zengy (; ).\n\nThe Sevan Lakes (with 30 rivers contributing to its storage), the largest located in the central part of the country and the Hrazdan River which originates from it, together form the \"Sevan-Hrazdan Management Area\", which is one of the five sub-basins of the 14 sub-basins of Kura and Araks basins of Armenia. The river originates from the lake at an elevation of . The river which flows from the lake in a southern direction passes through a deep gorge as it enters on the western side of the Yerevan city, and then debauchees into the Aras River on the southern side of the city. The geological formations along the river course are made up of lava flows (existing as basalts) generated from three volcanoes in the Gegham range. The lava surfaces represent environments that existed in the form of \"lakes, river channels and floodplains\". The chronology of landscape of the upper most layer of basalts indicates an age of 200,000 years.\n\nThe river drains a total catchment area of . Precipitation volume is 1572 million cubic metre from an annual rainfall of with a maximum of in May and a minimum of during August. The average temperature recorded in the basin varies from in January to in July with diurnal variation with the lowest night temperature of in January and highest day temperature of in July. The total flow in the river is 733 million cubic meter. The regulated outflow into the river, which forms the Ararat Valley, is utilized for irrigation and hydro-power benefits.\n\nThe fauna reported from the river includes 33 species of chironomids and 23 species of blackflies. The chironomids belong to five subfamilies of Tanypodinae, Diamesinae, Prodiamesinae, Orthocladiinae, and Chironominae. 25 species of invertebrates comprising two species of rotifers, 13 species of cladocerans and 10 species of copepods have been recorded in the river.\n\nWhile the fish species contained in the lake consist of the Sevan trout (\"Salmo ischchan\") or “Prince Fish,” siga, crucian, carp, crayfish, bojak (\"Salmo ischchan danilewskii\") and winter bakhtak (\"Salmo ischchan ischchan\") and summer bakhtak (\"Salmo ischchan aestivalis\"), the river is reported to have species of crayfish as well as karas and crayfish in abundance.\n\nThe lake waters have been used for irrigation from the 19th century, and from early 20th century Hydro-power development has also been implemented. The lake waters were planned to be used through the river for irrigating in the Ararat Valley out of which an irrigation of was created. The hydro-power development was planned on the river as the Sevan–Hrazdan Cascade involving seven schemes in a stretch of the river with a total installed capacity of 560 MW with mean annual energy generation of around 500 million kilowatt hours; it is the largest hydro-power generating scheme in Armenia. This scheme was implemented between 1930 and 1962. These are small and medium size projects built as run-of-the river power plants. The seven power stations are: Sevan HEP with installed capacity of 34.2 MW with two units completed in 1949; the Hrazdan HEP of 81.6 MW with two units commissioned in 1959; the Argel HEP with installed capacity of 224 MW completed in 1953; the Arzni HEP with capacity of 70.6 MW with installation of 3 units commissioned in 1956; the Kanaker HEP with installed capacity of 100 MW with 6 units completed in 1936; the Yerevan-1 HEP commissioned in 1962 with installation of 44 MW with 2 units; and the Yerevan-3 with capacity of 5 MW with one unit commissioned in 1960. However, priority of release of water from the lake is for irrigation and accordingly the power stations are operated.\n\nThe civil works involved construction of diversion works, open canals or tunnels and power house which over the years were in need of substantial rehabilitation as they were all built around the middle of the twentieth century. In 2003, the International Energy Corporation\", a Closed Joint Stock Company, acquired the projects from the Public Services Regulatory Commission of the country under a license No. 0108 for generation of electrical energy. Right from the time of acquisition they started rehabilitating the projects to maximize power generation. The works were completed during 2004. The works were carried out under a US$25 million loan from the Asian Development Bank.\n\nThe river water is polluted by effluent flows from agricultural, commercial, industrial, and residential development, but particularly by the untreated wastewater from Yerevan. This affects the water quality in the river with dissolved oxygen (DO) levels (less than 5% of the saturated dissolved oxygen level) remaining much lower than the permissible limits. A study carried out in 2008 indicates that a 16 km stretch of the river, from 2 km upstream of the Yerevan waste water outfalls to 14 km below, is insufficiently aerated to provide a healthy environment for aquatic life.\n\n"}

Finding the people to be hospitable and nice, they asked for the name of the place. Since the natives did not understand the Spanish language, they assumed that what the Spaniards were asking for what is the status of the harvest, for them it was harvest time. The natives answered \"Maayo man\". So the Spaniards named the settlement \"El Pueblo de Maayon\". Thus, the name Maayon was derived from that word and to this very day, it is known as such.\n\nMaayon first became a town during the early American era. However, during the Cadastral Survey, it was reverted to a barrio status under the Municipality of Pontevedra. For nearly half a century, the residents fought hard and long for its restoration to a separate and distinct entity. Their untiring efforts were empty rewarded when in 1955, Carmen Dinglasan Consing,  representative of the first District of the Province of Capiz field House Bill No. 2098 in the lower chamber of Congress. Senator Justinano S. Montaño sponsored and steered the bill until its approval. Finally on March 30, 1955 President Ramon Magsaysay signed the bill re-creating the lot Municipality of Maayon, Capiz in a ceremony held in Malacañan.\n\nThe \"New Municipality\" included eight barrios then, namely, Maayon, Fernandez, Piña, Balighot, Batabat, Guia, Tuburan and Canapian Sur. Now it has thirty two (32) barangays.\n\nThe ceremony was attended by a large delegation from Capiz. The President also signed the appointment of the following officials of the new town: Rael Declaro, Mayor; Ernesto Diaz, Vice Mayor; Marcelo Diaz, Felomino Comoro, Damaso Deocampo, Ambrosio Dumagpi, Agustin Barruela, and Marcelo Delfin, Councilors.

Almalbis, Treasurer: Ponciano Declaro, Judge: Diosdado Borres, Chief of Police; and Dr. Alejandro Orosco, Rural Health Physician. Also Dr. Manuel Buenvenida who was then Rural Health Physician for Pontevedra took charge of the health problems of the new town until his transfer to Pres. Roxas Dr. Ricardo A. Dasal replaced him. It was not until a year later, in 1956, when a regular and the first Rural health Physician was appointed. Rev. Fr. Crisogono Dequiña was then parish priest.\n\nRafael M. Declaro who was also the first elected official of the town during its first election in November 1955 won with less than 200 majority over Atty. Artagnan D. Roxas. He relinquished the Mayorship to his running mate-Prudencio L. Alovera - when he assumed the position of municipal judge of the same town. The late Mayor Alovera served from April 17, 1957 to 1971 - the longest term in the 25-year existence of the municipality. Alovera did not seek re-election in 1971, In 1972, Bertile D.

The Paseo de Evangelizacion 1566 can be found in the town plaza and was erected through the efforts of Rev. Msgr. Benjamin F. Advincula. 1566 was the year the Spaniards arrived in the island of Panay and became the second Spanish settlement in the country next to Cebu.\n\nMiguel Lopez de Legazpi transferred the Spanish settlement from Cebu to Panay in 1569 due to the lack of food. The town was formally founded in 1572 (1581 according to Jorde), although by that time Legazpi had moved the capital of the Philippines, further north, to Manila. Fr. Bartolome de Alcantara was named the prior of the town with Fr. Agustin Camacho as assistant. A prosperous town due to trade, Pan-ay became capital of captivating Capiz for two centuries, until Capiz was named capital. The town name was eventually given to whole island. After 1607, Fr. Alonso de Méntrida, noted for his linguistic studies and Visayan dictionary became prior. In the 18th century, Pan-ay was famous for its textile industry which produced a cloth called suerte and exported to Europe. In the 19th century, Don Antonio Roxas, grandfather of Pres. Manuel Roxas, opened one of the largest rum and wine distilleries in the town. The Augustinians held the parish until 1898, when administration transferred to the seculars.\n\nThe first church was built before 1698 when it is reported that a typhoon had ruined it. In 1774, Fr. Miguel Murguía rebuilt the church, but it was later damaged by a typhoon on 15 January 1875. Fr. Jose Beloso restored the church in 1884. The church is best known for its 10.4 ton bell popularly called dakong lingganay (big bell). The bell was cast by Don Juan Reina who settled in Iloilo in 1868. Reina who was town dentist was also noted as a metal caster and smith. The bell was cast at Pan-ay from 70 sacks of coins donated by the townspeople. The bell was completed in 1878. It bears an inspiring inscription which translated reads: “I am God’s voice which shall echo praise from one end of the town of Pan-ay to the other, so that Christ’s faithful followers may enter this house of God to receive heavenly graces.”\n\nPanay is politically subdivided into 42 barangays.\nIn the , the population of Panay, Capiz, was people, with a density of .\n\n"}

The settlement was then known as \"Sibala\", named after the river that ran through the coastal village. In 1570, however, the settlement was seized by Spanish forces and the \"guardia civil\" took full control of the village fortifying it with a military garrison. It later flourished into a bigger town and was renamed after its designated patron \"La Nuestra Señora del Pilar\" (Our Lady of the Pillar). In the 18th century, it adopted the (Holy Trinity) \"La Santisima Trinidad\" as its municipal patron after a wooden image of the Holy Trinity from the wreckage of a Spanish galleon ship en route from Mexico was found in the town's coastline.

Her death would translate to the death of the language in Tapaz itself and the \"suguidanon\" epic chant as well. Also, Feliza has traditional tattoos on her skin which were inscribed when she was chosen as a \"binukot\".

(then called the Caterpillar Tractor Company). It was the first modern tractor to use the elevated drive sprocket to improve durability, operator comfort, and ease of maintenance.\n\nThe Caterpillar D10 was the result of a need for a tractor larger than the Caterpillar D9. At this time, competitors were building bulldozers that were more powerful than the D9. Allis Chalmers introduced at Conexpo 69 in Chicago a HD-41 which was the largest crawler in the world. In 1974 after AC and Fiat merged their construction equipment divisions the 524 hp 41-B was introduced. For example, the Fiat-Allis 41-B track-type tractor had at the time, while the D9H had . In 1976 Japanese company Komatsu came out with an even larger bulldozer called the D455A at and . \n\nThe first pilot D10 was D10X1 and was shown in July 1973 at a big Caterpillar corporate meeting. Other prototypes would follow in 1975 and 1977. In March 1977, prototypes P-1 through P-10 would appear and be subsequently dispatched to different job sites. The D10 was introduced at a dealer meeting by Caterpillar in the fall of 1977. Between 1978 and 1986 nearly 1,000 D10s were made at Caterpillar's East Peoria plant. The D10 had sales of their Fiat-Allis/Komatsu competitive sized bulldozers combined. With the introduction of the N-Series tractors in 1986-87 their model numbers were pushed up. For example, the D9N replaced the D8L, the D10N replaced the D9L and the D11N replaced the D10.\n\nThe D10 was so big that it could do about 50 percent more production than the D9H.\n\nAmong modern tractors, the High Drive (elevated sprocket) design is unique to Caterpillar products. The concept originated in 1914 with Caterpillar predecessor C. L. Best Tractor's 30 Humpback; this tractor was discontinued a year later, and the only other tractor to use the concept until the D10's introduction was the Cletrac Model F, built between 1920 and 1922. The elevated sprocket system was first applied to a 10-machine test run of the D10 in 1977. It separated the suspension from the tractor's drive train, dramatically reducing stress on both and increasing their durability. Prior to this, the combined system, which put the drive axle under constant strain of the vehicle's load and terrain beneath it, was prone to frequent failure. Elevating the drive sprocket allowed for a more absorbent suspension, which provided better traction, reduced component wear and operator fatigue, and isolated the drive sprocket in a flexible section of the machine's tracks. It also allowed for the relocation of the transmission behind and beneath the operator, providing better weight distribution and improved traction, and permitting more compact location of both the blade and rear implements. The high-drive system also eliminates the traditional geared final drive in favor of modular system employing a hydraulic planetary final drive, which withstands engine torque better, since it distributes the forces over multiple gear teeth instead of a single tooth as in the traditional system. The disadvantage is that the track moves around one more idler, reducing track life. Caterpillar claims to have alleviated this with the SALT (Sealed and Lubricated Track), a permanently lubricated track system which was introduced on their track-type tractors in the early 1970s.\n\nWhen the D10 was introduced in 1977, it was the most powerful track-type tractor ever built at . The Cat D10 could be ordered with up to a U-blade, and weighed in at . Later versions weighed in at . The U-blade was high and could push according to Caterpillar's literature. The November 1977 issue of Excavating Contractor magazine had a 2-page story on the bulldozer titled \"Cat Uncorks The New D10\". One of the first D10s is currently sitting in front of the East Peoria, Ill plant where it was made. A picture of this D10 can be found on pages of a book titled \"The Caterpillar Century\" on pages 298-297. Caterpillar put the 1,786 cid V-12 twin turbocharged D348 in the D10 to power it. This had already proven itself in the 777 off-highway hauler and the 550 hp 10 yard 992/992B wheel loaders from 1968 on. The early D10s came with a single big black exhaust stack up front. But some engine problems came up with exhaust system routing which resulted in two exhaust stacks up front to correct this problem. This new look took root in 1980. At the time Caterpillar's bulldozer lineup was the D3, D4E, D5B, D6D, D7G, D8K, and D9H with the addition of the D10.\n\nIn 1986 an even larger dozer, the Caterpillar D11N was introduced to replace the D10. The D11 carried on the success of the elevated drive sprocket system in large bulldozers. The currently available D10T model, and preceding D10R and D10N variants, are not the original D10's successors but the D11N, D11R and the current D11T are.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2090978", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2090978", "title": "Vanadzor", "text": "Vanadzor\n\nVanadzor ( ) is an urban municipal community and the third-largest city in Armenia, serving as the capital of Lori Province in the northern part of the country. It is located about north of the capital Yerevan. As of the 2011 census, the city had a population of 86,199, down from 148,876 reported at the 1979 official census. Currently, the town has an approximate population of 82,200 as per the 2016 official estimate. Vanadzor is the seat of the Diocese of Gougark of the Armenian Apostolic Church.\n\nVanadzor was known as Gharakilisa (alternatively \"Karakilisa\") -meaning the \"black church\" in Turkic- at its foundation during the days of the Russian Empire. Following the Sovietization of Armenia, the city was named Kirovakan () in 1935, after the Russian Bolshevik leader Sergey Kirov. After the independence of Armenia, Kirovakan was renamed Vanadzor in 1992.\n\nThe name \"Vanadzor\" is composed of two words, \"vank\" (), meaning \"monastery\", or \"church\", and \"dzor\" (), meaning \"valley\" in Armenian. Thus, the name of the city means \"Valley of the Monastery\" or \"Valley of the Church\", probably as a translation of its previous name \"Karakilisa\".\n\nThe area of present-day Vanadzor has been settled since the Bronze Age, based on the tombs and other historic remains found on the nearby hills of \"Tagavoranist\" and \"Mashtots\". During the ancient Armenian kingdoms, the area was considered as part of the Tashir canton of Gugark; the 13th province of the Kingdom of Armenia (Greater Armenia), until the end of the Artaxiad Dynasty's rule over Armenia in the 1st century AD. Later, the region was ruled by the other Armenian dynasties of the Arsacids and the Bagratunis. By the end of the 10th century, the area became part of the Kingdom of Lori (Kingdom of Tashir-Dzoraget) until the beginning of the 12th century. With the invasion of the Seljuk Turks, the region came under the rule of the Great Seljuk Empire. The settlement was called \"Gharakilisa\" (meaning the \"black church\" in Turkic) by the Seljuks possibly as early as the 13th century, the name being taken from the black-stoned Armenian church of the Holy Mother of God on a nearby hill.\n\nIn 1801, the entire region of Lori became part of the Russian Empire along with the Georgian state. Lori was a strategically important territory for the Russian defensive forces on the border against Persia. In 1826, the settlement of Gharakilisa was entirely destroyed by Hasan Khan during the Russo-Persian war. In 1828, the Russians founded a new town as a major centre for the deployment of their troops during the Russo-Turkish War of 1828–29. According to Khachatur Abovian, the population of Gharakilisa was not more than 600 by the end of the 1820s, mainly consisting of migrants from Yerevan. In 1849, it became part of the Erivan Governorate within the Russian Empire. Under its new administrative status, Gharakilisa was flooded with many hundreds of migrating Armenian families from Kars, Ardahan and Western Armenian cities of Karin and Daroynk).\n\nThe town enjoyed a considerable uplift through the opening of the railroad towards Tbilisi in 1899. The vicinity of the town was the site of the Battle of Karakilisa in May 1918, when General Tovmas Nazarbekian's outnumbered troops, led by Garegin Nzhdeh successfully defended the region against the invading Turkish Army, pushing them back just few days after the crucial Armenian victory in the Battle of Sardarapat, thus allowing the Republic of Armenia to come into existence. On the North side of the Spitak-Vanadzor highway, about West of the city, there is a little shrine in the ruins of a church, the site of a planned monument to that battle.\nIn 1920, after only 2 years of independence, Armenia fell under Soviet rule. The first city development plan for Gharakilisa, initiated by architects Karo Halabyan, Mikayel Mazmanyan and Gevork Kochar, was adopted in 1929–1930. Under the new plan, the town was enlarged towards the East and the West. In 1935, the Soviets renamed the city \"Kirovakan\" after the Bolshevik leader Sergey Kirov. In 1939, a new remodeling plan for the city, created by architects N. Zargaryan and A. Minasyan, was introduced to create an industrial district and a summer-resort area. The centre of the city was redeveloped during the 1950s. The central town square named after Sergey Kirov (now Hayk Square) was constructed along with the surrounding government and administrative buildings.\n\nAfter the independence of Armenia, Kirovakan was renamed \"Vanadzor\" after the Vanadzor River that flows through the city.\n\nVanadzor, along with Gyumri and Spitak ( west), suffered a considerable amount of damage from the 1988 earthquake when 564 residents died in the city. Unlike the two other cities, the majority of buildings in Vanadzor were unscathed from the earthquake.\n\nVanadzor, the capital of Lori Province, is located north of Yerevan and east of Gyumri.\n\nAt an average height of above sea level, Vanadzor is located in the valley of Pambak River, on the point where the rivers of Tandzut and Vanadzor join the Pambak river. The city is surrounded by the over mountains of Bazum and Pambak. The southern and eastern regions are densely forested while to the north and west are only covered with bushes and plants.\n\nThe climate of Vanadzor is characterized by cool summers and relatively mild winters. The average temperature in winter is , while in summer it reaches up to . Vanadzor's climate is classified as humid continental (Köppen climate classification \"Dfb\"). The amount of precipitation is around .\n\nThe Vanadzor Botanical Garden located to the southwest of the city is one of the 5 botanical parks within the Republic of Armenia.\n\nThe population of Vanadzor has grown gradually since 1849, after becoming part of the Yerevan Governorate.\n\nThe population of Kirovakan-Vanadzor increased significantly after World War II, when Stalin allowed open immigration to the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic with the promise of a better life for the arriving Armenians in the historical homeland. More than 150,000 Armenians from different parts of Europe and the Middle East, most being survivors of the Armenian Genocide, immigrated and settled in Kirovakan. Due to the harsh conditions imposed by the Soviets intelligence and the Ministry of Interior, many of the immigrants were sent to labor camps in Siberia and elsewhere. The reason for such disrespectful treatment towards the Armenian immigrants was because almost all were more educated than the local community, spoke more than 3 languages, and were open followers of the Armenian Apostolic Church, something that was considered a threat to the national security by the Stalinist Government. Despite the difficulties, more Western Armenians immigrated to Kirovakan during the following years. However, many of the immigrants left the city and returned to their diaspora countries, including Cyprus, Lebanon, Syria, Greece, France and the United States. Nowadays, approximately 2,000 Western Armenian settlers are living in Vanadzor, most of whom still using the Western Armenian dialect at daily life.\n\nWhile the majority of Vanadzor are ethnic Armenians, there are also small communities of Russian, Ukrainian and Greek population.\n\nHere is the population timeline of Vanadzor since 1831:\n\nThe majority of the population belongs to the Armenian Apostolic Church. Vanadzor is the seat of the Diocese of Gougark of the Armenian Apostolic Church, serving the population of Lori province.\n\n, The city is home to 4 churches and 2 chapels:\n\nVanadzor has several archaeological sites including the nearby Mashtots hill which is home to many remains from the 4th millennium BC.

It is a resident breeding species from southern Florida, the Bahamas, the Caribbean, parts of Central America, south to western Ecuador, Brazil, and northern Argentina. It was introduced to Galápagos around the 1960s and is potentially impacting native and endemic species across the archipelago.\n\nThis ani is found in open and semi-open country and areas under cultivation. The nest, built communally by several pairs, is a deep cup lined with leaves and placed usually high in a tree. A number of females lay their chalky blue eggs in the nest and then share incubation and feeding.\n\nEach female is capable of laying up to seven eggs, and nests have been found containing up to 29 eggs, but it is rare for more than ten to hatch. Incubation is 13–15 days, with another 10 days to fledging. Up to three broods may be raised in a season, with the young of earlier broods helping to feed more recent chicks.\n\nThe smooth-billed ani is a mid-sized species, larger on average than the groove-billed ani but smaller than the greater ani. It measures in length and weighs . The adult is mainly flat black, with a long tail, deep ridged black bill and a brown iris. The flight is weak and wobbly, but the bird runs well and usually feeds on the ground.\n\nThis is a very gregarious species, always found in noisy groups. The calls include a whining \"ooo-leeek\". The smooth-billed ani feeds on termites, large insects and even lizards and frogs. They will occasionally remove ticks and other parasites from grazing animals.\n\nThis common and conspicuous species has greatly benefited from deforestation.\n\nThis species is called \"el pijul\" in Venezuelan folklore.

It was created as a lobby group to promote independent candidates before the 1940 general election. The Conservative and Liberal parties, and the more conservative remnants of the United Farmers, recognizing the widespread popularity of the Social Credit party, ran joint candidates as independents in what was called the \"Independent Movement\" or the \"Unity Movement\". Calgary mayor Andrew Davison was named leader.\n\nAt the 1940 election, Independent candidates won 42 per cent of the vote, only 1,400 fewer votes than Social Credit. However, not all these were anti-SC activists belonging to the AUM/ICA. Some were actual independent candidates running under their own steam.\n\nBe that as it may, the Independent Movement did have considerable support and did elect 19 MLAs. The \"party\" might have done better but for their support being spread out across the province and not concentrated enough in specific districts to translate into seats, especially outside the cities. (In the cities the STV-PR system in use ensured they would receive their fair portion of city seats.) In some rural districts, Independents lost races to Socred incumbents by small margins, despite the AV system in use in rural districts in those days.\n\nAnd Social Credit was returned for a second term. The Independents did, however, succeed in slashing Social Credit's previous crushing majority; the Socreds won only 36 seats, down from 56 when the writs were dropped. Independent candidates won 19 seats, enough to make Davison Leader of the Official Opposition.\n\nThe Liberal Party under leader Edward Gray chose only to support Independent candidates that it played a hand in nominating and it nominated other candidates under its own banner, one of whom was elected to a seat. Gray felt that candidates should not be 'machined' into the field and left it up to individual Liberal constituency associations to support Unity Movement candidates or to put forward their own Liberal candidates.\n\nMany former supporters of the United Farmers joined the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation which ran its own candidates, none of whom were elected. A Labor candidate A.J. Morrison was elected in the coal-mining area of Edson.\n\nThe campaign ads for the Independents typically read: \"Be Independent of the new \"Social Order\". Vote Independent! Paid for by the Independent Citizen's Association of Alberta.\"\n\nIn 1944, James H. Walker, an Independent MLA who had been a United Farmers candidate, was elected the first permanent leader of the Independents ovet David Elton. Strains within the coalition had begun to take their toll with Liberal MLAs leaving the caucus before the beginning of that year's legislative session. The Liberals chose not to run separately in the general election, however, and Walker led the Independents into the 1944 provincial election but the party failed to run a full slate of candidates. Only three Independent MLAs were elected, and Walker lost his own seat.\n\nIn 1945, the Independents chose J. Percy Page as their leader and he became Leader of the Opposition. He led the party, now called the Independent Citizen's Association, into the 1948 election, but by that time the Liberals had left the coalition and ran their own slate of candidates. The party received only 1.35% of the vote, losing all of its seats. The party folded, and the Conservative Party re-emerged in the 1950s.\n"}

Its current population is about 50,000.\n\nWhitehaven is a neighborhood in South Memphis and is roughly bounded by Brooks Road on the north and the Mississippi state line on the south, with the Illinois Central Railroad on the west and Airways Boulevard on the east.\n\nThe major traffic artery of the community is U.S. Route 51, later known as Elvis Presley Boulevard. This roadway began as a toll \"Plank Road\" built between Memphis and Hernando, Mississippi in 1852.\n\nWhitehaven is no longer its own city, but a part of Memphis.\n\nThe community takes its name from a Colonel Francis White, who was an early settler and major property owner. White was influential in getting a rail line to run through what was first called White's Station, later Whitehaven. This Mississippi and Tennessee Railroad was chartered in 1853, and the first trains ran in 1856. The first \"White Haven\" post office was opened in 1871. The roads and train tracks connected the cotton farms of the Mississippi Delta to Memphis markets, establishing strong commercial links.\n\nSome of the other founding family names are Raines, Hale, McCorkle, and Harbin. E. W. Hale moved to the area in the 1880s and opened a store near what is now Whitehaven High School on Elvis Presley Blvd. Hale's Store was a landmark for many decades.\n\nIn 1926, WREC radio began operations there, and in 1928 Whitehaven Hoyt B. Wooten was one of the first six television licensees in America. His original home is the centerpiece of a private development called Lion's Gate.\n\nMuch of the later residential and commercial development was done by Carrington Jones and Lacy Mosby in the mid 20th century, to provide housing for \"baby boom\" families who moved from Memphis to a pleasant environment in the old community. This gradually transformed plantation tracts to neighborhoods in the late 1940s and 1950s.\n\nOriginally a farm community, Whitehaven was developed as a residential suburb of Memphis in the 1950s and early 1960s. In 1950 Whitehaven had a population of 1,311. In 1960 Whitehaven had a population of 13,894.\n\nWhitehaven was annexed by the city of Memphis January 1, 1970. It was integrated in the late 1960s and white flight ensued over the next two decades. Whitehaven is now a part of South Memphis.\n\nFour high schools are in the Whitehaven area: Fairley High School, Hillcrest High School, Pathways In Education, and Whitehaven High School. Whitehaven High School was opened by 1911 with evidence of the school dating back to 1893 and was the only high school in the community until Hillcrest opened during the 1960s. A strong rivalry developed between the two schools, and the Hillcrest/Whitehaven game became one of the major events in the community during football season. Bishop Byrne, a private co-educational Catholic high school adjacent to Saint Paul Church on Shelby Drive, opened in 1966 and closed in 2013.\n\n\n\nWhitehaven's major tourist attractions are still Graceland mansion and the annual Elvis Week, attracting many thousands there annually to remember \"The King\" on the anniversary of his death on August 16, 1977.\n\nElvis Presley bought his famous home in 1957; soon afterward the farmland surrounding the estate was subdivided into homesites.\n\nDuring the two decades he lived in Whitehaven, Elvis spent as much time as possible at his home and was a beloved neighbor to residents there.\n\nFor the next decade there was rapid development, with Whitehaven Plaza shopping center becoming the area's commercial center.\nSouthland Mall opened at the corner of Shelby Drive and Elvis Presley Blvd in 1966 and is still a destination for shoppers from all over the region. It greatly helped the community to prosper. Southland Mall was the first enclosed mall in Memphis.\n\n\nMoving to Whitehaven personal story \n"}

She is married to John Thurman. They have two children, McLin (Macky) and Liberty Lee, and make their home in Dunnellon, Florida.\n\nThurman was first elected to public office in 1974, when she won a seat on the city council of Dunnellon, Florida, on which she served until 1983. She served as Mayor of Dunnellon from 1979 to 1981. She served in the Florida State Senate from 1983 to 1993.\n\nFlorida gained three congressional districts after the 1990 census. One of them was the 5th District, which stretched from Gainesville to the far northern portion of the Tampa Bay Area. It was an open secret that this district was drawn for Thurman. She was elected to the House from that district in 1992 and was reelected four more times with no serious opposition.\n\nThurman was recognized as an expert on health, veterans, and tax issues. She was only the sixth woman to serve on the House Ways and Means Committee. On Ways and Means she fought for lower prescription drugs, increased access to health insurance, and tax relief. Prior to her appointment to Ways and Means in 1996, Congresswoman Thurman served on both the House Agriculture Committee and the Committee on Government Reform and Oversight.\n\nAfter the 2000 census, the Republican-controlled Florida legislature reconfigured the 5th to make it friendlier to Republicans. She lost heavily Democratic Gainesville and surrounding Alachua County while picking up some heavily Republican territory between Tampa and Orlando. The new 5th contained much of the territory located in the State Senate district of that body's President Pro Tem, Ginny Brown-Waite. Nonetheless, Thurman ran for reelection. Even though the redrawn district had gone narrowly for George W. Bush in 2000 (Al Gore had won her old district handily), Thurman just barely lost to Brown-Waite.

It is the most extensively investigated terrestrial isopod species.\n\n\"Armadillidium vulgare\" may reach a length of , and is capable of rolling into a ball when disturbed; this ability, along with its general appearance, gives it the name \"pill-bug\" and also creates the potential for confusion with pill millipedes such as \"Glomeris marginata\". It can be distinguished from \"Armadillidium nasatum\" and \"Armadillidium depressum\" by the gap that \"A. nasatum\" and \"A. depressum\" leave when rolling into a ball; \"A. vulgare\" does not leave such a gap.\n\n\"Armadillidium vulgare\" is able to withstand drier conditions than many other woodlouse species, and is restricted to calcareous soils or coastal areas. It feeds chiefly on decaying plant matter, but also grazes lichens and algae from tree bark and walls.\n\nIt is able to regulate its temperature through its behaviour, preferring bright sunshine when temperatures are low, but remaining in shadow when temperatures are high; temperatures below or above are lethal to it. \"A. vulgare\" is less susceptible to cold during the night, and may enter a state of dormancy during the winter in order to survive temperatures that would otherwise be lethal.\n\nThe native distribution of \"A. vulgare\" ranges across Europe, especially in the Mediterranean Basin. In the United Kingdom, \"A. vulgare\" is very common in southern and eastern England, but is more confined to coastal areas in the north. Similarly, in Ireland, \"A. vulgare\" is common in the south and east, but rarer in the north and west.\n\n\"A. vulgare\" has also been introduced to many locations in North America, where it may reach population densities of up to 10,000 individuals per square metre. It is now one of the most abundant invertebrate species in California coastal grassland habitats. It has also been introduced, to a lesser extent, to sites across the world.\n\nBecause of their unusual yet non-threatening appearance, some \"Armadillidium vulgare\" are kept as pets in areas throughout the U.S., typically among children. Different lineages are bred, usually in regards to color, in order to provide stock to hobbyists. One supposed variation, \"Punta Cana,\" is often referred to as \"Armadillidium sordidum,\" while others insist it is a variety of \"A. vulgare.\" Keeping a pet pill bug requires a very moist habitat with limited light and lots of decaying plant matter. They can often live up to three years. Among non-hobbyist adults, they are often seen as unwanted (but essentially harmless) home pests.\n\nMost metazoans have circular mitochondrial genomes, but \"A.vulgare\" has an unusual combination of both circular and linear mitochondrial DNA.\n\n\n"}

According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nIt was created in 1769.\n\nIn the summer of 1578, the natives of Tala-ugis trudged up from the coast to establish a settlement northward in the interior along Suage River. The first settlers were led by families of Gamuk, Hutikon, Uganet and Pagdakton, who settled themselves in what is currently known as barangays Matag-ub, Danao, Yabon and Quipot.\n\nMore than a century later, Spaniards came along these parts of Panay.\n\nEarly in 1738, Datu Buhawi of Yabon recognized the Spanish government, thus subjugating himself and his barangay to Spanish rule. But, Datu Dumagtol of nearby Ubian refused to follow suit. He led his subjects to the mountains to resist against the Spanish colonizers.\n\nThe Spanish governor Francisco Bayot de Ocampo recommended to the Principalía to transfer the seat of government, and in the following year (1770), the settlements were strengthened in their administration in what they called \"Janiuay\".\n\nWhile there is no certainty, there are several legends of how the place got its name. One is that it came from the ruling Datu's sons named \"Han\" and \"Oway\". Another is that the words \"\"hani\"\" (whisper) and \"\"oway\"\" (rattan) were combined.\n\nA strong typhoon followed by heavy rain in June 2008 caused the Suage river to overflow, damaging river bank communities and infrastructures. The flooding caused the river to be re-drawn and encroached the river banks by about 200 meters from its original location. Suage bridge remains structurally sound despite the flooding and encroachment.\n\nTwo rivers coming from the north-west cuts in parallel through Janiuay. One is the Suage River and the other is the Magapa River which provide natural irrigation supporting the mainly agricultural town of Janiuay. The Suage river bridge was once witness to fierce fighting between Japanese Imperial forces and the combined Filipino and American troops including the recognized Ilonggo guerrilla fighters. The Magapa river bridge was built after World War II.\n\nJaniuay is from Iloilo City.\n\nJaniuay is politically subdivided into 60 barangays.\n\nSanto Tomas approximate population is 500-800. Santo Tomas (Pakol to locals) is bounded by Madong in the east, Mangil in the north-east and Danao in the south west. It is accessible by three class C feeder roads in the east, south-west and south-east. Agriculture centers around rice, corn, coffee, beans, sugar cane, and copra. Traces of sweet mango farms are starting to gain roots especially close by the public elementary school. General topography is flat rice fields on the east and hill-valley-hill dotted by bamboos, coffee, mango, banana, coconuts and other fruit tree crops in the remaining areas.

Eugenio Moya in 1766. It lasted for eight years until Fr. Moya was forced to move to adjacent Pueblo Yabon for fear on his life on errant moros and the locales. The moros and the locales set camp in the forest of Danao away from forced labor edict from Spanish Principalia and administered by priests of Poblacion Janiuay. The moros and the locales raised in arms against Catholic conversion and had attempted to poison and kill Fr. Moya. Pueblo Danao became a prized possession disputed by Pueblo Quipot and Principalia Masin (now Maasin) because of its rich farmland in the west bounded by the Suage river and the rumor about rich mineral deposits in the hills of Kantong (now Danao Gantong). When Pueblo Quipot was moved to Poblacion Janiuay in 1769, Pueblo Danao was downgraded to a barrio and became part of Janiuay.\n\nDanao is divided into three mini locales (mini-barrangay), Danao I, Danao 2 and Danao Gantong. Each mini barangay has about a population of 300- 400. Danao is bounded by Santo Tomas (North-West), Mangil (North), Madong (East), Tambal (South-West),Calmay (West), Caraudan (West) and Aguingay (South-West).\n\nIt is accessible by two class C feeder roads from Poblacion Janiuay in the east, south-west and south-east.

Mode of transport can either be jeeps, motorcycles fitted with cabs for 2-5 persons locally known as tricycles for inter barangay transport. Intertowns are plied by buses, jeeps and private vans. Within the town, \"trysikad\" - a bicycle fitted with a cab for 2 people are commonly available.\n\nCommunication is generally available with nationwide carriers such as PLDT, Globelines and Smart competing with local and aging analog Pantelco.\n\nElectricity is sourced from electric cooperative Ileco II supplying 75% of the town proper and about 25% of the neighboring barangays.\n\nJaniuay prides itself on two heritage infrastructure dating back from 1760.\n\nThe Janiuay Catholic Church was built of sandstone, limestone and layered bricks and was completed in February 1770. Its belfry used to carry three magnificent bells, the largest weighing close to a ton. World War II damaged the belfry, and the bells were lowered to ground after the war. The largest bell crashed down during the relocation and suffered a crack in length from its lip upwards. When sounded it gives a distinct baritone rattling sound that can be heard for miles. It is now mounted in the new church's belfry built in the late 60s.\n\nAnother heritage infrastructure is the Janiuay Cemetery. It was built much later, in 1870, and is also walled with ancient sandstone and bricks brought from distant locale some 30 km away in what is now known as the town of Dingle. Spanish Fr. Llorente directed the construction of this cemetery in the Gothic design of his time. The Janiuay town cemetery is located a kilometer east of Janiuay Catholic Church.\n\nJaniuay is also home to several heritage mini sugar mills owned by landed Spanish mestizos and Swiss descent. These mini sugar mills have seen their own time and once produces brown sugar. Wrought steel rotary crushers driven by water buffaloes or carabaos extract sugar from canes and cooked in large vat until brown and solid.\n\n\n"}

The median year in which the homes were built is 1960.\n\nBenedict Canyon has a mix of vegetation and growth that is endemic to Southern California - oaks and grasses on the lower slopes, and chaparral and lupine on the higher hillsides. Along nearby Franklin's Creek can be found sycamores, ferns and vines. Evergreens, such as pines, cypresses, deodars and eucalyptus, were planted as settlers moved in, and built homes and parks. Vegetation types within the Santa Monica Mountains range from moist coastal canyon bottoms in the Santa Monica Mountains, to desert transitional areas at the headwaters of the Santa Clara River. With the exception of the areas that border the Mojave Desert, all of the vegetation within the zone is influenced by the effects of the Pacific Ocean. The resulting cool, wet winters and hot, dry summers create a Mediterranean-type ecosystem.\n\nBy far, the dominant vegetation sub-type is chaparral. Chaparral is composed of drought- and fire-tolerant evergreen shrubs that range in height from four to ten feet. Unless recently subjected to fire, or some other type of disturbance, this plant community is generally too dense to penetrate. Another unique shrub community to Southern California is sage scrub, which varies between coastal and inland types. Sage scrub vegetation contains fewer stout, woody shrubs, and more openings with fine, delicate plants. The expansive valley floors between the mountain ranges were plowed and farmed long ago. They are now entirely developed. The precise former native plant cover of the San Fernando, Simi and Santa Clarita Valleys was never adequately recorded. It is suspected that native perennial bunch grasses were dominant elements. Throughout the zone, over ninety-five percent of the native grasslands have been displaced by foreign invasive plants. The most common riparian (stream-related) woodland species are various willows, coast live oak, California sycamore, and Fremont's cottonwood. Less common species that are relics of the last Ice Age include white alder, bigleaf maple, and black cottonwood. On slopes, and in valleys where rainfall concentrates, groves of evergreen coast live oaks are common throughout Benedict Canyon. These evergreen oaks provide food and shelter for numerous species of wildlife. Deeper soiled areas in the Santa Susana Mountains, the Simi Hills and the Santa Monica Mountains support the deciduous valley oak. A widely dispersed tree in the Santa Monica Mountains, and to a lesser extent in other ranges, is the California black walnut.\n\nThe animal population is pretty much the same as it was 10,000 years ago. Grizzly bears are an exception, as they were killed off by early settlers of the area. The most common medium and large-sized mammals are coyotes, mule deer, bobcats, raccoons, and skunks. Just away from the urban edge, other predators, such as grey fox, mountain lion, American badger, long-tailed weasel, and ringtailed cat, occupy various niches. The ecosystem's top predator, the mountain lion, is present everywhere except the fragmented eastern end of the Santa Monica Mountains that bisects the Los Angeles metropolitan area. Because they fear humans, however, they are rarely seen. Also, there are numerous prey species—such as rabbits, squirrels, rats, mice, and other rodents. Seven species of hawks, eight species of owls, peregrine falcons, golden eagles, northern harriers, American kestrels, and white-tailed kite share in this bounty of prey.\n\nBenedict Canyon is also part of the Pacific Flyway. As a result, the resident Southern California bird species often share company with neo-tropical migrants and other species, such as Canada geese. There are over eighteen species of snakes and eight species of lizards. The most common snakes are pacific rattlesnake, gopher snake, California king snake, and California striped racer. The rattlesnake is the only venomous snake in California. They seek shade during the hottest summer afternoons and hibernate during the winter. The zone supports five species of frogs, three species of toads, and five species of newts and salamanders. As in most parts of the world, frog populations have declined, probably due to climate change and pollution. The widely scattered perennial streams still support unique populations of native fish. Topanga and Malibu Creeks contain tidewater gobies, arroyo chub, and the endangered Southern California Distinct Population Segment of steelhead. The Santa Clara River supports these species as well as the federally listed endangered, unarmored three spine stickleback. Some of the upper reaches of the Los Angeles River at the foot of the San Gabriel Mountains harbor populations of the Santa Ana sucker and speckled dace.\n\nThe Benedict Canyon Association (BCA), started in 1948, is an example of neighborhood activism. The BCA is dedicated to preserving the beauty, safety, environment and quality of life in the Canyon. Because of their early efforts, Benedict Canyon remains the only canyon that is 100% residential.\n\nThe Hillside Ordinance to limit building height at and stipulate restrictions on set-back, side yards or parking, was a product of Association lobbying and participation. That ordinance was also the basis of the recent defeat of the proposed villa on top of the Mark Hughes hilltop, an event cheered by many residents.\n\nCurrent and past beautification projects of the Association include the repair and repaving of roads, repainting of guardrails, repair of Upper Benedict Canyon, and a subsidized monthly service of clearing debris and trimming vegetation that spills on the roadway.\n\n\"Adopt Fire Station 99\" is another community grass roots organization representing about 9,000 residents in the Mulholland-Benedict Canyon area. Going hand-in-hand with the BCA, residents helped to generate the media attention, popular support, and political will that defeated the city's plan to reduce from two to one the number of paramedics available at each Fire Station to deliver emergency care.\n\nA number of celebrities live or have lived in Benedict Canyon. Some of them are:\nBottlenecks on the neighborhood's narrow canyon roads have been noted as a primary concern. As part of the plan, the Department of Transportation tows away cars that are parked illegally on narrow hillside streets on \"red flag days,\" when fire danger is high. When fire conditions reach the critical red flag level— wind and relative humidity below 15%—illegally parked vehicles that restrict access are ticketed and towed. Fire departments notify residents by raising red flags over the 103 fire stations in Los Angeles. Over the last ten-plus years (2015), the maximum number of Red Flag days per year was 12. The normal range is between four and seven days per year.\n\nBrush clearance is a year-round responsibility to those homeowners living in Benedict Canyon. Fire officials said that both the foliage and the lack of recent fires in the area are cause for concern, not comfort, noting the Oakland Hills fire of October 1991 that killed 25 and destroyed 3,276 residences under similar conditions.\n\nLos Angeles Police Department operates the West Los Angeles Community Police Station at 1663 Butler Avenue, 90025, serving the neighborhood.\n\nLos Angeles City Fire Department serves the area of Benedict Canyon. Fire Station 71 and Fire Station 99 serve the Benedict Canyon Area.\n\nResidents are assigned to schools in the Los Angeles Unified School District\n\n"}

It is considered to be the key stamp in any collection of US stamps.\n\nThe stamp was issued to fulfill a need for a reduced rate, 2-Cent denomination for newspaper, magazine, and local deliveries; and was often used to \"make up\" higher rates, or split in half to make up lower ones (a 1-Cent stamp) due to shortages at the local post office.\n\nDuring the Civil War, the \"Black Jack\" was supposed to have been favored by both North and South, but as soon as the South got news of the North making a stamp depicting one of their own heroes, they printed a 2-Cent stamp depicting the same portrait of Jackson on their own 'Red Jack' postage stamp in reaction. \n\nAfter the War was over, poverty inspired people to wash off the cancellation from the stamps and attempt to use them again. The Government then decided to put an antitheft device onto the stamps known as a grill. This grill, which consisted of various rows of tiny indentations into the stamps, was supposed to make it impossible to wash off the cancellations without being detected; but people usually got around this by bisecting the stamp, and then reusing that portion that didn't have a cancellation on it. The first grill applied to a Black Jack stamp is known as the \"Z\" grill, introduced in January 1868. Over the next few months, the Post Office successively employed three smaller grill patterns (D, E and F) in the production of this stamp.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2091086", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2091086", "title": "Banzai charge", "text": "Banzai charge\n\nA banzai charge is the term used by the Allied forces to refer to Japanese human wave attacks and swarming mounted by infantry units. This term came from the Japanese cry , shortened to banzai, specifically referring to a tactic used by Japanese soldiers during the Pacific War.\n\nThe banzai charge is considered to be one method of , a suicide attack, or suicide before being captured by the enemy such as \"seppuku\". The origin of the term is a classical Chinese phrase in the 7th-century \"Book of Northern Qi\", which states \"\", \"A true man would [rather] be the shattered jewel, ashamed to be the intact tile.\" Among the rules there existed a code of honor that was later used by Japanese military governments.\n\nWith the revolutionary change in the Meiji Restoration and frequent wars against China and Russia, the militarist government of Japan adopted the concepts of Bushido to condition the country's population to be ideologically obedient to the emperor. Impressed with how samurai were trained to commit suicide when a great humiliation was about to befall them, the government educated troops that it was a greater humiliation to surrender to the enemy than to die. The suicide of Saigō Takamori, the leader of old samurai during the Meiji Restoration, also inspired the nation to idealize and romanticize death in battle and to consider suicide an honorable final action.\n\nDuring the Siege of Port Arthur human wave attacks were conducted on Russian artillery and machine guns by the Japanese which ended up becoming suicidal. Since the Japanese suffered massive casualties in the attacks, one description of the aftermath was that \"[a] thick, unbroken mass of corpses covered the cold earth like a coverlet\".\n\nIn the 1930s, the Japanese found this type of attack to be effective in China. It became an accepted military tactic in the Japanese army where numerically weaker Japanese forces, using their superior training and bayonets, were able to defeat larger Chinese forces. The Japanese here did not face massed automatic weapons but rather the bolt action rifle of the Chinese, which could not fire as rapidly as a machine gun.\n\nDuring the war period, the Japanese militarist government disseminated propaganda that romanticized suicide attacks, using one of the virtues of Bushido as the basis for the campaign. The Japanese government presented war as purifying, with death defined as a duty. By the end of 1944, the government announced the last protocol, unofficially named , implying the will of sacrificing the entire Japanese population of 100 million, if necessary, for the purpose of resisting opposition forces.\n\nDuring the U.S. raid on Makin Island, on August 17, 1942, the U.S. Marine Raiders attacking the island initially spotted and then killed Japanese machine gunners. The Japanese defenders then launched a banzai charge with bayonets and swords, but were stopped by American firepower. The pattern was repeated in further attacks, with similar results.\n\nDuring the Guadalcanal campaign, on August 21, 1942, Colonel Kiyonao Ichiki led 800 soldiers in a direct attack on the American line guarding Henderson Field in the Battle of the Tenaru. After small-scale combat engagement in the jungle, Ichiki's army mounted a banzai charge on the enemy; however, against an organized American defense line, most of the Japanese soldiers were killed and Ichiki subsequently committed suicide.\n\nOn May 29, 1943, during the Battle of Attu, the beleaguered Japanese soldiers led by Colonel Yasuyo Yamasaki in Attu Island, Alaska, launched a massive banzai charge through American lines near Massacre Bay and were quickly wiped out all night despite intense fighting. At the end of the battle, only 29 remained of the Japanese force that had numbered roughly 2,600, while the Americans lost 549 combatants out of the 15,000.\n\nThe largest banzai charge of the war took place during the Battle of Saipan. General Yoshitsugu Saitō gathered almost 4,300 Japanese soldiers, walking wounded and some civilians, many unarmed and ordered the charge. On July 7, 1944, it slammed directly into the Army's 1st and 2nd Battalions of the 105th Infantry Regiment, who would lose almost 2,000 men in the 15 hour pitched battle. In the end, U.S. Army and Marine lines would hold, and almost all the Japanese soldiers taking part in the charge would be killed. \n\nBanzai charges were always of dubious effectiveness. In the early stages of the Pacific War, a sudden banzai charge might overwhelm small groups of enemy soldiers unprepared for such an attack. However, by the end of the war, a banzai charge's participants suffered horrendous losses while inflicting little damage in return, particularly if launched against an organized defense with strong firepower, such as automatic weapons, machine guns and semi-automatic rifles. At best, they were conducted by groups of the last surviving soldiers when the main battle was already lost, as a last resort or as an alternative to surrender. At worst they threw away valuable resources in men and arms in suicidal attacks which only hastened defeat.\n\nSome Japanese commanders, such as General Tadamichi Kuribayashi, recognized the futility and waste of such attacks and expressly forbade their men from carrying them out. Indeed, the Americans were surprised that the Japanese did not employ banzai charges at the Battle of Iwo Jima.\n\n"}

This is enough to reach most, if not all of India. Two variants of the Ghauri were produced under the secretive missile research programme started in 1987 and the development of a third variant was cancelled. The Ghauri-II uses increased motor assembly length and improved propellants for an increased range of .\n\nThe missile is named after Shahabuddin Muhammad Ghauri, while the \"Hatf\" designation originates from the name of the sword or lance of the Islamic prophet Muhammad.\n\nUpon its development, the missile was named after the 12th century Sultan Shahabuddin Ghauri, by a senior scientist who worked on the program with a keen interest in medieval history. Sultan Muhammad Ghauri, a Turk who successfully campaigned in the northwestern region of India between 1176 and 1182, but was defeated in his first battle in northern India by Indian King Prithviraj Chauhan; but Ghauri returned in June 1192 when he defeated Prithviraj. He captured Delhi in 1199, but established his kingdom formally in 1206.\n\nHowever, the JS HQ has officially codenamed the missile \"Hatf–5 (Ghauri–I); the Hatf codename originates from the name of the sword or lance of Muhammad.\n\nAccording to the American intelligence estimates in 1999, the \"Ghauri–I\" is influenced and its design development is based on the Rodong-1 missile of North Korea. According to the American Federation of Atomic Scientists, the \"Ghauri–I\" is believed to inherit a warhead spin-up mechanism from the Rodong 1 and it is stated that this feature could improve accuracy up to 190m CEP— although this is still debatable. The mechanism involves using steering vanes to spin the missile after 100 seconds of flight time. After 110 seconds, the rocket motor stops and the warhead separates from the rocket motor. The warhead then enters a more stable re-entry trajectory due to its spinning motion. Warhead accuracy would be further enhanced if the Ghauri's inertial navigation system is capable of being updated by GPS satellite signals.\n\nBy Pakistan's own unofficial admission, the technology transfer took place in 1990s in return of the instructions on enrichment methods for uranium Not much has been publicized as controversy surrounds the claim that North Korean nuclear efforts were well advanced before the instructions on enrichment methods uranium were provided.\n\nAccording to the Pakistani military reports, the original design of the missile was flawed and the missile's frontal conic nose section material burned up due to generated shock waves and hypersonic effect on re-entry during its first test flight in 1998. High stress and high temperature shift caused the material to melt during the re-entry while its vintage electronic systems, engine system, and propellant had to be replaced. Eventually, the conic nose section was redesigned by rounding the cone which allowed the missile to travel from subsonic flow to supersonic flow. The KRL, with assistance from the NESCOM, DESTO, and NDC, engaged in heavy reengineering of much of the missile electronic system.\n\nThe liquid fuel systems are incapable of storing fuel for any long period of time; the Ghauri–I requires fueling for several hours before launch, making it vulnerable to a first strike. It is believed that this is why Pakistan has not pursued liquid fuel systems other than the \"Ghauri–I\" and Ghauri-II. It also makes it less likely that the \"Ghaur-I\" would be armed with a nuclear warhead, although it has been stated that it is capable of being loaded with \"all types\" of warheads. Contrast to the Shaheen program that went under the joint conjecture of Pakistan's Air Force and the Army, the Ghauri program was designed for the Pakistan Army which was setting to accuracy goal for a highly accurate missile designed to strike high-value targets.\n\nThe solid-fueled Shaheen-IA is believed to be an alternative missile system for the \"Ghauri–I\". However, it has been stated that the \"Ghauri–I\" has the advantage of lower cost than solid-fueled systems. This makes it particularly useful in testing launch and control systems. It has been speculated that the Ghauri–I design may serve as a starting point for a future Pakistani space launch vehicle.\n\nThe \"Ghauri–I\" was first test fired at 7:25hrs on 6 April 1998 from the Tilla Test Range near Malute, Jhelum Cantt which is about 76mi (122.31km) south of the Islamabad. It was fired from a transporter erector launcher and traveled in a flight lasting 9 minutes and 58 seconds. It climbed to a height of 350km before turning in the direction of its planned impact area in the desert of Balochistan where it hit the designated target at 7:33hrs. At the time, Pakistani military's information source, the ISPR stated that the missile hit its designated target in the desert of Balochistan. Official Pakistani military reports revealed that the first test was not successful because the missile's conic nose melted due to tremendous amount of heat during the re-entry phase of its flight.\n\nAfter redesigning nose by rounding it to avoid the hypersonic effect but traveling from subsonic to supersonic flow, \"Ghauri–I\" was successfully test fired for second time as then-Prime Minister Zafarullah Jamali witnessed the test. On 21 December 2010, the \"Ghauri–I\" was again successfully test fired for a third time. On 12 November 2012, the \"Ghauri–I\" was successfully test fired for a fourth occasion by the Strategic Missile Group of the Army Strategic Force Command. The test-flight was monitored by the new Strategic Command and Control Support System (SCCSS) and is believed to have been geared towards testing the SCCSS rather than the missile itself.\n\nOn 15 April 2015, \"Ghauri-I\" was again test fired from Tilla Test Range; it was fired from the transporter erector launcher.\n\n\n"}

Brandon took over Domino's in March 1999 when founder Tom Monaghan sold it to the investment group Bain Capital. Prior to Domino's, he was the CEO of Valassis Communications. He is also a former regent of the University of Michigan and former football player.\n\nBrandon graduated with a bachelor's degree and teaching certificate from the University of Michigan in 1974. While in Ann Arbor, he was a back-up defensive end on the university's football team, under the leadership of Bo Schembechler.\n\nBrandon has honorary doctorate degrees from Walsh College, Schoolcraft College, Lawrence Technological University, Cleary College, Central Michigan University, and Albion College.\n\nOn May 9, 2009, David received his honorary Doctorate of Humane Letters from Albion College during the college's commencement ceremonies, in Albion, Michigan. He also delivered a commencement address to the 2009 graduating class and finished his address by giving a graduation present to each of the graduates. Taped to the bottom of each of their seats was a coupon for a free pizza and a soda.\n\nBrandon began working for Valassis in 1979 at age 27. Brandon described moving from Procter & Gamble to Valassis, then a small, family-owned coupon company, as a \"culture shock.\" Over 20 years, Brandon rose in the company's ranks. He was promoted to executive vice president and chief operating officer of Valassis in 1986, then to chief executive officer in 1989.\n\nDuring his tenure as CEO, Brandon organized Valassis's initial public offering in 1992 at $11.34 per share. \"Fortune\" selected Valassis as one of the 100 best companies to work for in 1997, 1998, and 1999.\n\nBrandon became the chief executive officer of Domino's Pizza in March 1999 after its founder, Thomas Monaghan, sold his shares of the pizza chain to Bain Capital in order to start Ave Maria University.\n\nBrandon led Domino's to its initial public offering in 2004 at $14 per share, raising $337 million. Under Brandon's direction, Domino's introduced the first pizza tracker, and added desserts and sub sandwiches to its menu. To promote the new products, Brandon appeared on a national TV commercial to burn a cease-and-desist letter from Subway. In 2009, Domino's changed its core pizza recipe in a move that Brandon called the \"biggest product introduction we've done since… well, pizza.\" Over the course of Brandon's tenure, Bain received a 500% return on its initial investment. By December 31, 2009, around when Brandon left for the University of Michigan, the stock price had fallen to $8.38.\n\nBrandon was elected to the Board of Regents of the University of Michigan in 1998, as a member of the Republican Party.

He was seen putting the letter in a pizza oven, and the letter caught on fire. Subway had sent the letter to Domino's to stop advertisements for their new oven baked sandwiches that noted a 2 to 1 advantage over Subway's subs in an independent taste test.\n\nOn January 5, 2010, Brandon was named athletic director at the University of Michigan, succeeding Bill Martin. University President Mary Sue Coleman said she chose Brandon because she believed his financial management experience would serve the department well as it grew larger and increasingly complex. Soon after arriving, Brandon established a marketing department, which began investing in resources for athletes and established a student loyalty program. Within a few years, Brandon began returning surpluses in the hundreds of millions of dollars, which the university used for a number of major facilities improvements. An opinion editorial in the \"Detroit News\" credited Brandon with raising academic standards for athletes and bringing in more counseling and tutoring resources for athletes.\n\nMichigan Athletics, under Brandon's leadership, raised student season ticket prices amid a slump in student attendance nationally, which drew scrutiny from student government officials after roughly a third fewer students bought season tickets.\n\nOn September 30, 2014, a graduate student posted a petition on the website of the University's Central Student Government asking that Brandon be fired. By midnight of October 1, the petition had grown to over 10,000 signatures.

On cable, the station is available on Cox Communications and AT&T U-verse channel 4 in standard definition (and on Cox digital channel 704 and U-verse channel 1004 in high definition) in the Oklahoma City metropolitan area; it is also carried on channel 4 on most cable systems elsewhere within the Oklahoma City DMA as well as on DirecTV and Dish Network.\n\nThe station is also carried on cable providers throughout much of western and southern Oklahoma, extending as far away as Guymon (which is in the Oklahoma Panhandle section of the Amarillo market) and Idabel (part of the Shreveport–Texarkana market). The station is carried on Sparklight and other cable systems on the Oklahoma side of the Ada–Sherman market as an alternate NBC affiliate, albeit with NBC programs and some syndicated shows blacked out due to the presence of Ada-licensed KTEN, in compliance with FCC regulations allowing local network affiliates to prohibit cable providers from carrying duplicative network content from an out-of-market station.\n\nFascinated with the medium since the late 1930s, Edward K. Gaylord—publisher of the morning \"Daily Oklahoman\" and evening \"Oklahoma Times\" newspapers—brought television to Oklahoma on an exhibitory basis in mid-November 1939, when his Oklahoma Publishing Company (OPUBCO) sponsored a six-day demonstration of telecasts and broadcast equipment at the Oklahoma City Municipal Auditorium (now the Civic Center Music Hall) in downtown Oklahoma City. The event featured appearances by performers from NBC and Gaylord's radio station, WKY (930 AM). During November and early December 1944, OPUBCO conducted a similar, 19-city television exhibition tour across central and western Oklahoma—open to residents who had purchased war bonds—that included performances from WKY personalities and demonstrations by television technicians.\n\nOn April 16, 1948, Gaylord submitted a permit application to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to build a television station that would transmit on VHF channel 4. He waited to make the submission so as to ensure that any financial burden would be limited until revenue from existing OPUBCO assets was able to offset the station's profit losses. When the FCC granted the license for the proposed television station to Gaylord on June 2, 1948, Gaylord requested to assign WKY-TV as the television station's call letters, applying the base WKY callsign that had been used by his AM radio station shortly after it signed on in 1922 and was also assigned to its FM sister on 98.9 (now defunct, frequency now occupied by KYIS) when it signed on in July 1947. The station began test broadcasts, accompanied by music playing over the test pattern slide, on April 21, 1949. Television set owners in Oklahoma and neighboring states called to report reception of the WKY test signal, which was transmitted each afternoon until regular broadcasts commenced. The test signal operated at low power for three days, after a lightning strike caused minor damage to a junction box on the transmission tower during the early morning of April 27. Closed-circuit transmissions began on May 27, with a wrestling match at the Oklahoma City Stockyards Coliseum.\n\nChannel 4 officially signed on the air at 7:00 p.m. on June 6, 1949, with an inaugural broadcast that included speeches from Gaylord, executive vice president/general manager Proctor A. \"Buddy\" Sugg, and Governor Roy J. Turner; a topical feature by Gaylord and Sugg on the new television medium; and a film outlining programs that would air on WKY-TV. It was the first television station to sign on in the state of Oklahoma (KOTV in Tulsa – which had its license approved the same day as the grant of the WKY-TV license to Gaylord – would not debut until October 22), and the 65th to sign on in the United States. WKY-TV's original studio facilities were based at the Municipal Auditorium (near Colcord Drive and Walker Avenue, west of WKY radio's facilities at the Skirvin Tower Hotel on Park and Broadway Avenues), with production facilities in the Freede Little Theatre on the second floor. Following a second round of renovations to the building due to a fire that caused $150,000 in damage on November 17, 1948, most of the technical and production equipment was replaced, and soundproofing material was installed in the auditorium to limit disruptions between production of local programs and stage productions that would be held elsewhere in the building. The radio station's broadcast tower, located between Kelley Avenue and the Broadway Extension in northeast Oklahoma City's Britton section, was the site of an accident in which the assembly carrying the WKY-TV transmitter antenna fell (at the tower's mark) while being hoisted for installation; the antenna suffered minor, albeit repairable dents.\n\nChannel 4 has been an NBC television affiliate since its debut, inheriting those rights through WKY radio's longtime relationship with the progenitor NBC Red Network, which had been affiliated with that station since December 1928. (WKY-TV did not air its first NBC program, \"Who Said That?\", until June 17.) It also maintained secondary affiliations with CBS, ABC and the DuMont Television Network. (Select programming from the Paramount Television Network was added in 1950, continuing to be cleared on WKY's schedule until the network ceased operations in 1953.) Originally broadcasting Sunday through Fridays from 7:00 to 9:45 p.m., the station expanded its broadcast hours markedly over the next two years: WKY-TV began broadcasting seven days a week on February 11, 1950, when it started offering programs on Saturday evenings, and by 1951, when it added a morning schedule of local and network programs, was airing 90 cumulative hours of programming per week. Channel 4's initial local programming included some WKY radio shows that were adapted for television, including variety series \"Wiley and Gene\" (hosted by singers and WKY performers Wiley Walker and Gene Sullivan) and children's program \"The Adventures of Gizmo Goodkin\". In July 1951, the operations of WKY-AM-TV were integrated into a proprietary studio facility, which included television soundstages that were engineered to also allow origination of WKY radio programs, built just east of the Britton Road transmission tower (WKY radio had earlier moved into the facility on March 26).\n\nOPUBCO management challenged a proposal under the FCC's \"Sixth Report and Order\"—which ended the agency's four-year-long freeze on licensing grants and realigned VHF channel assignments in many American media markets to alleviate interference issues—that would have resulted in channel 4 being reassigned to Tulsa and WKY-TV being moved to VHF channel 7. The company cited the cost of installing a temporary antenna, the potential effects on WKY radio's transmissions, and the need for viewers to replace their existing outdoor antennas with models capable of receiving high-band VHF signals in its response seeking to stay on channel 4. In April 1952, the FCC rescinded its request for WKY-TV to change frequencies, citing in part, feasible co-channel assignment separation from CBS affiliate KRLD-TV (now Fox owned-and-operated station KDFW) in Dallas, and the proposal's potential generation of signal interference issues in adjacent markets with other television stations transmitting on the same channel (the channel 7 allocation was reassigned to Lawton, where it would become occupied by present-day ABC affiliate KSWO-TV). On July 1, 1952, WKY-TV became among the first six television stations in the country—along with fellow NBC stations WBAP-TV (now KXAS-TV) in Fort Worth, KPRC-TV in Houston, WOAI-TV in San Antonio and WDSU in New Orleans, and secondary NBC affiliate KOTV (now exclusively a CBS affiliate) in Tulsa—to begin transmitting network programming over a live coaxial feed. The milestone was inaugurated that morning with a message by \"Today\" host Dave Garroway welcoming the stations in commencing live network telecasts; at that time, WKY increased its programming to 111 hours per week.\n\nIn 1953, OPUBCO—whose founder had long been an advocate for Oklahoma's educational system—donated $150,000 worth of existing WKY-TV broadcasting equipment to the Oklahoma Educational Television Authority (OETA) for its proposed station on channel 13 (flagship station KETA-TV, which would sign-on in April 1956). Because of the licensing freeze instituted by the FCC in September 1948, WKY-TV was the only television station in the Oklahoma City market until 1953; its initial two UHF-based competitors—KTVQ (channel 25, allocation now occupied by Fox affiliate KOKH-TV) and KLPR-TV (channel 19, allocation now occupied by Cornerstone Television affiliate KUOT-CD)—made their respective debuts on October 28 and November 8 of that year. Though KTVQ and KLPR respectively signed on as basic affiliates of ABC and DuMont, channel 4 continued to carry selected programs from the two networks, with ABC programming being retained through a secondary basic affiliation; in contrast, WKY disaffiliated from CBS one month prior to KWTV (channel 9) signing on as an affiliate of that network on December 20. WKY-TV remained a primary NBC and secondary DuMont affiliate until the latter network discontinued operations in August 1956. Then on October 15, 1956, WKY-TV became the primary Oklahoma City affiliate of the NTA Film Network, offering the majority of the network's program offerings with interview, variety and drama series among its clearances. (Other NTA programs that WKY-TV elected not to clear, consisting entirely of scripted shows, were carried instead by KWTV.) In March 1958, Enid-based primary ABC/secondary NTA affiliate KGEO-TV (channel 5, now exclusively affiliated with ABC)—which, accordingly, changed its call letters to KOCO-TV at that time—refocused its coverage area to include Oklahoma City, resulting in that station assuming the local ABC programming rights. This left WKY-TV as a primary NBC and secondary NTA Film affiliate until National Telefilm Associates discontinued the latter service in November 1961, with channel 4 remaining an exclusive NBC affiliate.\n\nOn April 8, 1954, channel 4 became one of the first American television stations not owned by a network to produce and transmit local programs in color, beginning with a five-minute telecast hosted that evening by E.K. Gaylord; it also carried select NBC network programs in the format, with children's program \"The Paul Winchell Show\" was the station's first network color telecast. (Before the FCC had approved a color transmission standard, Gaylord had ordered color broadcasting equipment being developed by RCA—which included two RCA TK40 color cameras—in September 1949.) The cooking show \"Cook's Book\" became the first regular program to broadcast in color from the WKY studios and first in the state to do so, while dance program \"Sooner Shindig\" became the first live color program in the country to originate from the studios of a network-affiliated station. When NBC became the first network to commence color telecasts on May 1, WKY-TV provided color feeds of the Anadarko Indian Festival to the network for broadcast on \"Today\" and \"Home\". Local variety series \"The Hank Thompson Show\" also became the first color broadcast of a variety program. In 1955, WKY-TV became the first network affiliate to feed a full-length color program to a television network, transmitting coverage of a square dance convention in downtown Oklahoma City to NBC; it also transmitted closed-circuit images of a surgical procedure in color. (WKY-TV had become the first Oklahoma television station to air a surgical procedure via closed circuit telecast four years earlier in February 1950.)\n\nThe Oklahoma Publishing Company, through its WKY Radiophone Company subsidiary, eventually acquired or launched other television and radio stations during and after its stewardship of WKY-TV, including: WSFA (TV) and WSFA (AM) (now WLWI [AM]) in Montgomery, Alabama (in 1955); WTVT in Tampa, Florida (in 1956); WUHF-TV (now WVTV) in Milwaukee (in 1966); KTVT in Fort Worth (in 1962); KHTV (now KIAH) in Houston (built and signed on by the company in 1967); and KTNT-TV (now KSTW) in Tacoma, Washington (in 1973). WKY-TV served as the company's flagship station, and in October 1956, OPUBCO renamed its broadcast group, the WKY Television System. In December 1954, a half-hour WKY-TV special, \"Gift of God\", which outlined the medical and legal aspects of corneal transplants and included a film of a transplant operation project, led to the development of a statewide eye bank through a partnership with the Lions Clubs of Oklahoma and Lions Sight Conservation Foundation; by 1957, more than 16,400 donor cards (700 of which were received within 1½ hours after the special's initial airing, including one signed by then-Oklahoma Governor Raymond Gary) were signed to permit donation of participants' eyes to the bank after their deaths and 346 Oklahomans (including two who had underwent transplant surgery within 48 hours of the broadcast) had received corneal transplants to restore their sight.\n\nIn 1958, WKY became one of the first local television stations in the U.S. to acquire a videotape recorder; intended primarily for use by the station's news department, the recording equipment was also used for some program production, including those it distributed to NBC for national broadcast. One such videotaped show, the \"Stars and Stripes Show\", premiered on NBC that year as the first network television program to be produced by a local station. Ownership of OPUBCO's Oklahoma City-based print and broadcast properties was transferred to Edward L. Gaylord, after his father, E.K. Gaylord, died of natural causes on May 30, 1974 at the age of 101.\n\nOn July 16, 1975, Oklahoma Publishing sold WKY-TV to Universal Communications (a subsidiary of the Detroit-based Evening News Association) for $22.697 million. The Gaylords—who would later rechristen their broadcasting division as Gaylord Broadcasting—sold channel 4 to comply with FCC rules of the time that prohibited a single company from owning more than seven television stations nationwide, as it chose to purchase ABC affiliate WVUE-TV (now a Fox affiliate) in New Orleans and independent station WUAB (now a CW affiliate) in Cleveland as well as make building improvements to the Britton Road studio using proceeds from the sale. The sale coincided with the FCC's passage of new cross-ownership rules that prohibited media companies from owning newspapers and full-power broadcast television and radio outlets in the same market, restricting media companies to owning only either a print or broadcast property within an individual market. However, OPUBCO filed for a \"grandfathering\" waiver (which the agency allowed companies to seek to maintain existing newspaper-broadcasting combinations under special circumstances) to retain WKY radio, the \"Oklahoman\", and the \"Times\". The transaction was approved by the FCC on October 29.\n\nOn January 5, 1976, the station's call letters were changed to KTVY (initially backronymed in on-air parlance to \"TeleVision for You\"), in order to comply with a since-repealed FCC rule that prohibited separately owned TV and radio stations that were based in the same media market from sharing the same call letters. The WKY call letters had been assigned to its former radio sister before the \"K\"/\"W\" border definition assigned by the FCC was shifted to the Mississippi River in 1935; as such, upon changing them, channel 4 would have had to adopt a callsign starting with \"K\"—the KTVY calls were presumptively chosen as an anagram of its original WKY-TV calls—in any event. (WKY radio—which, in March 1977, moved to a new facility just west of the Britton Road building—was sold to Citadel Broadcasting in 2002, it is now owned by Cumulus Media. The \"Times\" ceased publication as a separate newspaper and was folded into the \"Oklahoman\" in March 1984; the Gaylord family sold the OPUBCO properties to The Anschutz Corporation in 2011; \"The Oklahoman\" is now owned by the Gannett Company). On June 6, 1985, KTVY became the first television station in Oklahoma to broadcast in stereo; initially, the station broadcast NBC network programs, local programs and certain syndicated shows that were transmitted in the audio format. Taking advantage of the new format, channel 4's daily sign-ons and sign-offs began to feature music videos, some of which were tailored to the station's public service campaigns.\n\nOn September 5, 1985, the Gannett Company announced that it would purchase the Evening News Association for $717 million, thwarting a $566-million hostile takeover bid by L.P. Media Inc. (owned by television producer Norman Lear and media executive A. Jerrold Perenchio). As FCC rules then prohibited a single company from owning two commercial television stations in the same market, Gannett was required to sell either KTVY or KOCO-TV, the latter of which had been owned by Gannett since the company's 1979 acquisition of Combined Communications Corporation. Nine weeks later, on November 15, Gannett sold KTVY, fellow NBC affiliate WALA-TV (now a Fox affiliate) in Mobile, Alabama and CBS affiliate KOLD-TV in Tucson, Arizona to Miami, Florida-based Knight Ridder Broadcasting for $160 million (with KTVY selling for a reported $80 million). The sale to Gannett was completed on January 13, 1986, with the Knight-Ridder transaction being approved by the FCC on February 19.\n\nOn February 28, 1989, Knight Ridder—which, 3¾ months earlier on October 8, 1988, announced its intent to sell its eight television stations to reduce its $929-million debt load and to help finance its $353-million acquisition of online information provider Dialog Information Services—sold channel 4 to Palmer Communications, then-owner of fellow longtime NBC affiliates WHO-TV in the company's headquarters of Des Moines and KWQC-TV in Davenport, Iowa, for $50 million; the sale was approved by the FCC on May 8.\n\nOn April 22, 1990, the station's call letters were changed to KFOR-TV, in reference to its over-the-air analog channel assignment. (The KFOR call letters were formerly used by a now-defunct television station on channel 10 in Lincoln, Nebraska [now occupied by CBS affiliate KOLN] that operated from May 1953 to March 1954; the KTVY call letters were later used by a full-power television station in Goldfield, Nevada [later KEGS, now defunct] from 2002 to 2005, and its Las Vegas-based low-power repeater [later KEGS-LP, also now defunct] from 1997 to 2005.) It also adopted the generalized promotional brand \"4 Strong\" (an analogue to the longer-established \"5 Alive\" moniker that had been used by KOCO-TV since 1977 and remained in use until 1994), and retitled its newscasts from \"News 4 Oklahoma\" (which had been in use since March 1984) to \"News Team 4\". Subsequently, on May 11, the station began maintaining a 24-hour programming schedule seven days a week, adding a mix of syndicated programs and infomercials as well as hourly local news updates to fill overnight timeslots. (As KTVY, the station had first adopted a 24-hour schedule on weekends in 1978, in order to air overnight feature films on Fridays and Saturdays.)\nOn November 7, 1991, Palmer announced it had signed a letter of intent to sell KFOR, WHO-TV and Des Moines radio stations WHO (AM) and KLYF (now KDRB) for $70.2 million to New Canaan, Connecticut-based Hughes Broadcasting Partners, a group formed earlier that year with its purchase of ABC affiliate WOKR-TV (now WHAM-TV) in Rochester, New York. The sale agreement was terminated on April 2, 1992, after Palmer management rejected the bid submitted by Hughes Broadcasting representatives. In a lawsuit against Palmer, majority owner VS&A Communications Partners LP asked the Delaware Chancery Court to force Palmer, which claimed it had no binding obligation to negotiate or reach a formal agreement, into resuming negotiations to reach a definitive sale contract. Hughes formally gave up its pursuit of the transaction, months after the judge presiding the case ruled that the agreement between VS&A and Palmer was not binding. Coinciding with the start of that year's Summer Olympics, KFOR inaugurated the \"\"NewsChannel 4\"\" moniker for its news branding on July 25, 1992 (the title would be extended to full-time use in May 1997); the \"4 Strong\" moniker was concurrently discontinued, opting to use the phoneticism \"K-FOR\" as a general identifier, sometimes accompanied by the slogan \"\"Oklahoma's News Channel\"\".\n\nOn May 14, 1996, The New York Times Company (through its Memphis-based broadcasting subsidiary) announced that it would purchase KFOR-TV and WHO-TV from Palmer Communications for $226 million (with KFOR selling for $155 million). The sale received FCC approval less than two months later on July 3, and was finalized on July 16. On June 13, 1998, the WKY-AM-TV transmitter tower (which had been used as an auxiliary tower for KFOR-TV and WKY radio, and was designed to withstand winds in excess of ) collapsed due to straight-line wind gusts to near —which also caused minor damage to KOCO-TV's studio facility, located to the east of the KFOR studios—produced by a supercell thunderstorm that also spawned four tornadoes across northern sections of Oklahoma City that evening. On October 11, 2000, The New York Times Company entered into a joint sales agreement with Pax TV owned-and-operated station KOPX-TV (channel 62, now an O&O of successor Ion Television), as part of a broader agreement between the Times Company and Paxson Communications that also involved stations in Des Moines (WHO-TV and Pax O&O KFPX-TV) and Scranton–Wilkes-Barre (ABC affiliate WNEP-TV and Pax O&O WQPX-TV). Until the agreement ended on July 1, 2005 (coinciding with Pax's rebranding as i: Independent Television), KFOR handled advertising sales services for channel 62, while KOPX carried NBC programs on occasions when conflicts with special event programming prevented them from airing on KFOR, and aired rebroadcasts of channel 4's 6:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m. newscasts on a delayed basis.\nOn September 14, 2005, Viacom Television Stations Group sold UPN owned-and-operated station KAUT-TV (channel 43, now an independent station) to The New York Times Company, creating a duopoly with KFOR upon the sale's November 4 closure. On January 4, 2007, the Times Company sold its nine television stations to Local TV, a holding company operated by private equity group Oak Hill Capital Partners, for $530 million; the sale was finalized on May 7.\n\nOn July 1, 2013, the Chicago-based Tribune Company (which formed a management company for the operation of both Tribune Broadcasting and Local TV's television stations in December 2007) acquired the Local TV stations for $2.75 billion. The sale, which was completed on December 27, reunited KFOR with former sister station KIAH (which Tribune had acquired from Gaylord Broadcasting in 1995).\n\nOn August 5, 2014, during a staff luncheon held at the soundstage within the original Britton Road studios that housed KAUT's news set, duopoly president and general manager Wes Milbourn announced plans to construct a new facility on a plot of land directly adjacent to the existing studio building to house the operations of KFOR-TV and KAUT-TV. Construction of the facility began in January 2015, and was completed in early August 2017. The facility—designed under an open floorplan to improve workflow and encourage collaboration between employees of the station's individual departments—incorporates two production studios (the main studio, which was named in honor of after veteran anchor Linda Cavanaugh upon her retirement on December 15, 2017, provides a backdrop of the newsroom structured similarly to the set used from February 1992 until the anchor desk was walled off from the former studio's newsroom in November 2006, and incorporates an razored monitor); an expanded weather center within the production studio housing KFOR's main news set; two control rooms that relay high definition content; and several conference rooms dedicated to former channel 4 employees (such as the Barry Huddle Room, named in honor of late longtime sports anchors Bob Barry Sr. and Bob Barry, Jr.). The building's exterior was built with reinforced steel, concrete and protective glass to resist a direct hit from a tornado or extreme straight-line winds, which would allow KFOR to broadcast uninterrupted during significant severe weather events affecting Oklahoma City proper. KFOR/KAUT's news, sales and marketing departments, and all other operations moved to the new Britton Road studio on August 19, 2017 (commencing broadcasts with that evening's edition of the 10:00 p.m. newscast), ending KFOR's 65-year tenure at the original 444 East Britton Road building. The older building was later razed after operations were moved into the new building to make room for public parking space near the newer building. Coinciding with the move, KFOR-TV changed its branding to \"Oklahoma's News 4\" (although print and online TV listings incorrectly identify the station's newscasts as \"\"KFOR News 4\"\"), adopting an alteration of the Tribune Creative West-designed graphics package developed for the Fox affiliates that Tribune owned prior to the Local TV purchase in 2012, and replacing the Wow and Flutter-composed custom theme that had been in use since 1997 with Stephen Arnold Music's NBC chimes-derived \"The Rock.\"\n\nOn May 8, 2017, Hunt Valley, Maryland-based Sinclair Broadcast Group—owner of Fox affiliate KOKH-TV and CW affiliate KOCB (channel 34)—entered into an agreement to acquire Tribune Media for $3.9 billion, plus the assumption of $2.7 billion in debt held by Tribune. (Ironically, Sinclair attempted to purchase the Palmer stations in 1996, in a proposal with River City Broadcasting—which Sinclair, which in turn was purchasing then-UPN affiliate KOCB from Superior Communications at the time, would acquire later that year—that would have resulted in River City acquiring KFOR in exchange for allowing Sinclair to buy WHO-TV from Palmer; Sinclair's purchase of the River City stations precluded this, because of FCC rules that then prohibited duopolies.) Because Sinclair and Tribune each owned two television stations in the Oklahoma City market, with KFOR and KOKH both ranking among the market's four highest-rated stations in total day viewership, the companies were required to sell either KFOR or KOKH (and optionally, KAUT and KOCB) to another station owner in order to comply with FCC local ownership rules.\n\nOn April 24, 2018, in an amendment to the Tribune acquisition through which it proposed the sale of certain stations to both independent and affiliated third-party companies to curry the DOJ's approval, Sinclair announced that it would sell KOKH-TV to Standard Media Group (an independent broadcast holding company founded by private equity firm Standard General to assume ownership of and absolve ownership conflicts involving nine Sinclair- and Tribune-owned stations located in markets where both groups have television properties) in a $441.1-million group deal. Sinclair would have effectively acquired KFOR-TV's license and intellectual assets directly, while retaining ownership of KOCB, which it opted not to include in the Standard Media sale; as a result, channel 34 would have formed a new legal duopoly with KFOR-TV and migrated its operations into KFOR/KAUT's Britton Road studios following a six-month transitional period in which Sinclair would have continued to provide services to KOKH for six months after the sale's completion. However, because FCC rules prohibit common ownership of more than two full-power stations in a single market, Sinclair would have spun off KAUT-TV to affiliate company Howard Stirk Holdings for $750,000, but would have assumed control of channel 43 through shared services and joint sales agreements with Stirk. Less than one month after the FCC voted to have the deal reviewed by an administrative law judge amid \"serious concerns\" about Sinclair's forthrightness in its applications to sell certain conflict properties, on August 9, 2018, Tribune announced it would terminate the Sinclair deal and concurrently filed a breach of contract lawsuit in the Delaware Chancery Court, alleging that Sinclair engaged in protracted negotiations with the FCC and the DOJ over regulatory issues, refused to sell stations in markets where it already had properties (such as KAUT-TV), and proposed divestitures to parties with ties to Sinclair executive chair David D. Smith that were rejected or highly subject to rejection to maintain control over stations it was required to sell.\n\nOn December 3, 2018, Irving, Texas-based Nexstar Media Group announced it would acquire Tribune Media in an all-cash deal valued at $6.4 billion, including the assumption of Tribune-held outstanding debt. The transaction—which, upon its closure, made Nexstar the largest television station operator by total number of stations—gave the KFOR/KAUT duopoly additional sister stations in Lawton–Wichita Falls (NBC affiliate KFDX-TV and SSA partners KJTL [Fox] and KJBO-LP [MyNetworkTV]), Wichita (the Kansas State Network group of NBC affiliates, led by flagship KSNW), Fort Smith–Fayetteville (NBC affiliate KNWA-TV, Fox affiliate KFTA-TV and MyNetworkTV affiliate KXNW, the latter previously being co-owned with CBS affiliate KFSM-TV, which Tribune/Nexstar spun off to Tegna to comply with FCC local ownership rules), Joplin–Pittsburg (NBC affiliate KSNF and ABC-affiliated SSA partner KODE-TV), Amarillo (NBC affiliate KAMR-TV and SSA partners KCIT [Fox] and KCPN-LP [MyNetworkTV]) and Shreveport–Texarkana (NBC affiliate KTAL-TV and SSA partners KMSS-TV [Fox] and KSHV-TV [MyNetworkTV]). The sale was approved by the FCC on September 16, 2019, and was completed three days later on September 19.\n\nKFOR-DT2 is the Antenna TV-affiliated second digital subchannel of KFOR-TV, broadcasting in standard definition on UHF digital channel 29.2 (or virtual channel 4.2 via PSIP). On cable, KFOR-DT2 is available on Cox Communications digital channel 247 in the Oklahoma City area, as well as on select other cable providers throughout the market (including Suddenlink systems in Enid, Perry, Stillwater, Chickasha, Purcell, Seminole and Pauls Valley, and Vyve Broadband systems in Chandler, Holdenville and Shawnee).\n\nIn March 2004, KFOR-TV launched a digital subchannel on virtual channel 4.2, which was originally formatted as an automated local weather channel (branded as the \"4Warn Forecast Channel\"), displaying feeds of the station's two Doppler radar systems (then branded as the \"4Warn Edge\" and the \"4Warn Storm Tracker\") as well as local and regional weather forecasts. In February 2005, KFOR-DT2 became an affiliate of NBC Weather Plus under the brand \"4Warn 24/7\"; around this time, Cox Communications began carrying KFOR-DT2 on digital channel 247. Following Weather Plus' shutdown on December 1, 2008, the subchannel returned to an automated format, carrying successor service NBC Plus. On December 31, 2011, KFOR-DT2 became an affiliate of Antenna TV, taking over the programming rights from the then-operational KFOR-DT3. In addition, from September 16, 2012 until September 2013, some Antenna TV programs were simulcast on KAUT during the overnight and early morning hours to compensate for current-day syndication rights.\n\nKFOR-DT3 is the Justice Network-affiliated third digital subchannel of KFOR-TV, broadcasting in standard definition on UHF digital channel 29.3 (or virtual channel 4.3 via PSIP). On cable, KFOR-DT3 is available on Cox Communications digital channel 224 in the Oklahoma City area.\n\nKFOR launched a third digital subchannel on virtual channel 4.3 on April 21, 2011, as a charter affiliate of Antenna TV, by way of the Tribune Broadcasting-owned classic television network's affiliation agreement with then-KFOR parent Local TV; after the latter subchannel took over the rights to the Antenna TV affiliation on December 31, 2011, KFOR-DT3 continued to carry the network's programming feed in tandem with KFOR-DT2 until the station decommissioned its DT3 subchannel on January 15, 2012. KFOR-DT3 was relaunched on December 22, 2017, as an affiliate of the Justice Network under an expansion of an existing affiliation agreement that Tribune reached with the Cooper Media-owned network in August 2016.\n\nKFOR-DT4 is the Dabl-affiliated fourth digital subchannel of KFOR-TV, broadcasting in standard definition on UHF digital channel 29.4 (or virtual channel 4.4 via PSIP). The subchannel is not currently carried on Cox Communications or on other cable providers within the Oklahoma City market.\n\nKFOR launched a fourth digital subchannel on virtual channel 4.4 on September 9, 2019, as a charter affiliate of the lifestyle network Dabl, through an agreement with former KFOR parent Tribune Broadcasting that went into effect on the date of the network's (ten days prior to the closure of Tribune's purchase by Nexstar). (Because network parent CBS Television Distribution uses subchannel-leasing arrangements—a structure which, like with Court TV Mystery on KAUT-DT3 and KSBI-DT4 locally, has often resulted in duplicative affiliates for a single network within the same market—as an affiliation clearance method for Dabl, KFOR-DT4 shares the Dabl affiliation with the fourth digital subchannel of KOCB, which has carried Dabl since the subchannel launched over the station on October 28, 2019.)\n\nThe station's digital signal is multiplexed:\nKFOR-TV began transmitting a digital television signal on UHF channel 29 on June 1, 1999, becoming the first television station in Oklahoma City and the state of Oklahoma as a whole to begin operating a digital signal; until KFOR-DT began broadcasting on a full-time basis on May 1, 2002, the digital feed only transmitted NBC prime time and sports programming as well as a limited schedule of local programs carried by the main analog signal. The station discontinued regular programming on its analog signal, VHF channel 4, on June 12, 2009, as part of the federally mandated transition from analog to digital television. The station's digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 40, The station's digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 27, using PSIP to display KFOR-TV's virtual channel as 4 on digital television receivers.\n\nTo reach viewers throughout the 34 counties comprising the Oklahoma City Designated Market Area, KFOR-TV extends its over-the-air coverage area through a network of nine low-power digital translator stations—all of which transmit using PSIP virtual channel 4—encompassing much of Western Oklahoma that distribute its programming beyond the range of its broadcast signal.\n\nKFOR-TV currently broadcasts the entire NBC schedule, although it may preempt some network programs to provide long-form breaking news or severe weather coverage when necessary or for certain event programming (such as the Oklahoma City Memorial Marathon, for which the station's 3½-hour broadcast of the annual event preempts \"Sunday Today with Willie Geist\" as well as the 6:00 and 8:00 a.m. editions of \"Oklahoma's News 4 Sunday Morning\" on the marathon date each April). The preempted programs may either be diverted to KAUT-TV on a live-to-air basis or rebroadcast over KFOR in place of regularly scheduled overnight programs, although station personnel also gives viewers the option of watching them on NBC's website and mobile app, Hulu, or its cable/satellite video-on-demand service the day after their initial airing. Syndicated programs broadcast by KFOR-TV include \"Rachael Ray\", \"The Doctors\", \"Inside Edition\", \"Right This Minute\", \"\" and \"Jeopardy!\". (Oklahoma City is one of a small number of U.S. television markets in which \"Jeopardy!\" and \"Wheel of Fortune\" are carried on separate stations; \"Wheel\" airs on ABC affiliate KOCO-TV.)\n\nKFOR also serves as the flagship station for the Oklahoma Department of Tourism and Recreation-produced \"Discover Oklahoma\", a half-hour, regionally syndicated program highlighting tourist attractions, events and restaurants across the state. The program – which is also broadcast on stations such as ABC affiliates KTUL in Tulsa and KSWO-TV in Lawton, and CBS affiliate KXII in Sherman, Texas, and on local origination cable channels in some smaller Oklahoma communities – is hosted by veteran entertainment reporter/film critic Dino Lalli (who worked at channel 4 from 1980 to 1984, with later stints at KOCO, KSBI and KWTV), and former Miss America and KWTV anchor Lauren Nelson, and features several former KFOR anchor/reporters (including Chellie Mills, Tina McGarry and Quin Tran) among its correspondents. It originally aired on KFOR-TV from September 19, 1992, following an inaugural one-year run on KOKH-TV, until September 2, 1995; it returned to channel 4 (inheriting the Saturday 6:30 p.m. timeslot that KWTV had aired \"Discover Oklahoma\" since the program moved there in 1995) on August 16, 2014, after the Tourism and Recreation Department was unable to renew KWTV's contract for the program after 21 years.\n\nHistorically, although NBC was far less tolerant of preemptions than its fellow major network rivals and channel 4 was one of the network's stronger affiliates, the station has either preempted or aired out of pattern certain NBC network programs to make room for other local or syndicated programs, including an occasional prime time show. At various points from the 1970s to the mid-1990s, the station preempted select late morning NBC daytime shows in order to run syndicated and locally produced programs; among notable examples, KTVY preempted \"Search for Tomorrow\" for most of the soap's NBC run starting in September 1982; NBC contracted then-independent station KOKH-TV to carry the program in KTVY's place until September 1985, when channel 4 reincorporated \"Search\"—then months away from cancellation—onto its schedule and concurrently shifted \"Days\" (which many NBC stations in the Central Time Zone normally aired at 12:30 p.m. at the time) to a 2½-hour tape delay to accommodate \"Search\" until that program ended its run on the network in December 1986. The daytime preemptions were especially prevalent under Palmer Communications ownership, when, in September 1992, KFOR began preempting NBC's late-morning talk and game shows as well as the afternoon soap opera \"Santa Barbara\" (which was then a few months away from ending its eight-year run), choosing to retain the higher-rated soaps \"Days of Our Lives\" and \"Another World\".\n\nThe station also preempted the final two hours of NBC's Saturday morning cartoon lineup from the late 1970s until 1992. In August 1992, KFOR chose to preempt the Saturday edition of \"Today\" and the virtual entirety of the fledgling TNBC lineup (with the exception of \"Saved by the Bell\", and later its spinoff \"\", when it debuted in September 1993), in favor of a new two-hour local morning newscast and a mix of educational children's shows and syndicated lifestyle programs. The station also delayed \"Late Night\" (during its David Letterman and Conan O'Brien runs) to 12:07 a.m. from September 1984, in order to run syndicated newsmagazines and game shows in the program's recommended 11:35 p.m. timeslot; KFOR moved \"Late Night\" to its standard network slot—directly following \"The Tonight Show\"—in September 2006. Following its acquisition by The New York Times Company, KFOR-TV began clearing the entire NBC schedule in the fall of 1996; at that time, it reduced its weekend morning newscasts to an hour on Saturdays and 90 minutes on Sundays (cutting the 7:00 a.m. hour) in order to accommodate the weekend \"Today\" broadcasts (a Sunday 6:00 a.m. newscast was added by 2002), and began to carry the remainder of the TNBC block and a third hour of the NBC daytime lineup.\n\nOne of the station's most successful early local programs was \"The Adventures of 3-D Danny\", a space-themed afternoon children's program that ran from 1953 to 1959. Hosted by Danny Williams as Supreme Galaxy Chief Dan D. Dynamo, the show—which showcased cartoon shorts between segments—was set in the fictional Space Science Center (of which Dynamo served as superintendent and from where he periodically traveled in a time machine known as the \"synchro-retroverter\"). Ratings for \"3-D Danny\" often beat those of ABC's \"The Mickey Mouse Club\", making it the first local television program in the country to achieve that feat. Williams joined the station in 1950 as host of an eponymous daily talk show as well as appearing as Spavinaw Spoofkin on \"The Adventures of Gizmo Godkin\". He also served as an announcer for WKY-TV's Friday and Saturday night professional wrestling telecasts, and from 1967 to 1984, hosted the local midday talk-variety show \"Dannysday\" (which featured among Williams' co-hosts over its 17-year run, Mary Hart, before she became a household name as co-anchor of \"Entertainment Tonight\"). The format typified by \"Dannysday\" was reprised in September 1985 with the mid-morning infotainment show \"AM Oklahoma\", hosted by Ben and Butch McCain (then working respectively as news and weather anchors for the station's weekday 6:00 a.m. newscast as well as its local news updates during \"Today\"); the program was canceled after nine months in May 1986. The McCain brothers continued anchoring and weather duties at KTVY until they left the station in June 1987, and subsequently joined KOCO that August to co-anchor its newly launched morning newscast, \"Good Morning Oklahoma!\".\n\nAnother children's show with a similar local cultural impact was \"Foreman Scotty's Circle 4 Ranch\". Airing from 1957 to 1971, it was hosted by Steve Powell (who, with Williams, created and hosted WKY-TV's \"The Giant Kids Matinee\") in the role of the titular cowboy. Scotty was accompanied by a cast of supporting characters that included ranch-hand sidekick Cannonball McCoy (played by station announcer Wilson Hurst), and several played by Danny Williams including fellow sidekick Xavier T. Willard. The show also featured prize giveaways including the Golden Horseshoe, whose winner was selected through the \"Magic Lasso,\" a cut-out slide that was superimposed on-screen over the audience, and honorary rides on a wooden horse named Woody for children in the studio audience who were celebrating their birthday. At its peak, the show had a 1½-year backlog of kids who wanted to be part of the show's audience.\n\nIn 1966, WKY-TV became the originating studio for \"The Buck Owens Ranch Show\" (the first season of which was produced by local businessmen Bud and Don Mathis, founders of locally based Mathis Brothers Furniture, the former of whom played the \"ranch foreman\" that joked and bantered with Owens). The half-hour syndicated country-variety series was seen in over 100 U.S. markets at its height, and was perhaps the most successful program of its kind that was not produced in Nashville (where most television programs of the country genre have been filmed). Regular acts that appeared included Owens' band, the Buckaroos, Kay Adams, the Hager Twins, Susan Raye and Owens' sons Buddy Alan and Mike Owens. Yongestreet Productions forced Owens to discontinue the \"Ranch Show\" in 1973, due to music duplication with the longer-running \"Hee Haw\" (both of which featured Roy Clark as his co-host).\n\nOther noted local programs aired on channel 4 have included \"The Wallace Wildlife Show\", a pioneering, regionally syndicated fishing show hosted by former WKY radio disc jockey Don Wallace from 1965 to 1988 (and was the highest-rated U.S. television program of that genre during the 1974–75 season); \"The Scene\", an \"American Bandstand\"-style Saturday afternoon dance show hosted by WKY radio DJ Ronnie Kaye, which ran from 1966 to 1974 and courted such famed musicians as James Brown, Ray Charles, Smokey Robinson, Otis Redding, Jerry Lee Lewis, and Ike and Tina Turner; a local version of \"PM Magazine\"; \"The Jude 'n' Jody Show\", a country-variety program hosted by singers Jude Northcutt and Jody Taylor (later owners of local furniture store Jude 'n' Jody and Sons) that ran on channel 4 and other Oklahoma City stations at various points from 1954 to 1982; and three horror movie showcases hosted by John Ferguson as \"Count Gregore\", a local version of \"Shock Theater\" from 1958 to 1962, \"Thriller Theater\" from 1962 to 1964 and \"Sleepwalker's Matinee\" from 1973 to 1979. (Ferguson—who worked as a staff announcer for channel 4 in 1955 before going on to play multiple characters on \"3-D Danny\"—would reprise the Count Gregore character on several similar horror-thriller showcases that aired on KOCO-TV, KOKH-TV, KOCB, KAUT-TV and local cable access channels in the Oklahoma City market at various points through the late 2000s.)\n\nIn August 1949, WKY-TV reached a deal with the University of Oklahoma to air Oklahoma Sooners football home games. The station's first live Sooners telecast aired on October 1 of that year, with a game against the Texas A&M Aggies at Owen Field (now Gaylord Family Oklahoma Memorial Stadium). WKY-TV also originated the first televised college football analysis program: airing from 1953 to 1963, \"Bud Wilkinson's Football\" (later retitled \"Inside Football with Bud Wilkinson\") was a 15-minute – later 30-minute – show that featured the Sooners' three-time national championship head coach as he discussed the previous week's game strategy, demonstrated through film footage and using figurines positioned on a miniature football field. At its peak, the show was syndicated to television stations in 45 markets across the U.S. In 1966, a wrestling match between the Sooners and the Oklahoma State University Cowboys became the first to be televised live on the station.\n\nFrom 1978 to 1984, channel 4 (as KTVY) aired an hour-long condensed broadcast of the most recent Sooners football game, with wraparound segments co-hosted by then-head coach Barry Switzer. \"The Oklahoma Playback\"—which aired on Sunday afternoons during the college football season—was also syndicated to stations throughout the U.S. (mainly in the Southwest, with Anaheim, California independent station KDOC-TV among the program's few out-of-region carriers), and briefly aired on the Five Star Cable Sports Network (a now-defunct channel owned by oilman, former Texas Rangers owner and OU alumnus Eddie Chiles). Around this time, the University of Oklahoma and then-Oklahoma City mayor Andy Coats led a legal challenge to regulations imposed by the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) in 1951 that restricted the number of college football games that could be televised live in a single season; however, KTVY occasionally broadcast live games through NCAA waivers that allowed certain games to be broadcast within a team's home market as they were being held. The rules, which were imposed out of concern that the broadcasts negatively affected game attendance, were overturned in a 7–2 vote by the U.S. Supreme Court in June 1984.\n\nFrom 1982 to 1997, channel 4 also aired college basketball games involving the Sooners. These telecasts—consisting of between ten and twelve regular season games each year, most of which aired on Saturday afternoons—originated under a direct revenue-sharing deal with the university, before expanding in 1985 to encompass the Oklahoma State Cowboys and other fellow members in the Big Eight Conference (which evolved into the Big XII in 1996) under an agreement with Raycom Sports—transferring to ESPN Plus in 1993—in an agreement that also gave the station the local broadcast rights to select college football games involving Big Eight teams to which ABC did not hold the national television rights and the first three rounds of its men's basketball tournament. Since KFOR-TV lost the local syndication rights to the ESPN-produced Big XII basketball telecasts to KOCB (which aired those telecasts for 16 years afterward) in 1998, sports programming on the station has come mainly through NBC Sports. However, since its inaugural run in April 2001, KFOR-TV has served as exclusive broadcaster of the Oklahoma City Memorial Marathon, an event benefiting the Oklahoma City National Memorial & Museum that is usually held on the third Sunday in April.\n\n, KFOR-TV broadcasts 40½ hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with seven hours on weekdays, two hours on Saturdays and 3½ hours on Sundays); in regards to the number of hours devoted to news programming, it is the highest local newscast output among Oklahoma City's broadcast television stations. In addition, the station produces \"Flashpoint\", a political discussion show focusing on state and national issues (moderated by weeknight anchor Kevin Ogle, with former Oklahoma Attorney General Mike Turpen and former Oklahoma State Senator and Oklahoma Lieutenant Governor Todd Lamb as panelists), which airs Sundays at 9:30 a.m. Because it produces \"Rise and Shine\" for sister station KAUT-TV, channel 4 does not produce live news updates during the first two hours of the weekday editions of NBC's \"Today\", choosing instead to air brief weather segments recorded earlier in the morning during production of each day's edition of \"Oklahoma's News 4 This Morning\" (KFOR does produce live news updates for broadcast during the Saturday edition of \"Today\" and \"Sunday Today with Willie Geist\").\n\nThe station operates a Bell 206L-4 LongRanger IV helicopter for newsgathering, \"Air Comfort Solutions Chopper 4\", named through a brand licensing agreement with the local heating, ventilation, and air conditioning repair firm in 2018. The helicopter caught footage of an F5 tornado that killed 36 people on May 3, 1999 as it tracked from Amber to Midwest City (this video was used for eleven years in promos for \"Chopper 4\" until the helicopter's pilot at that time, Jim Gardner, left the station to join KWTV in that same capacity in 2011), and an EF5 tornado that hit Moore on May 20, 2013, which was televised nationally by The Weather Channel (via an affiliate video feed provided to the network by then-co-owner and NBC parent NBCUniversal) during its live coverage of the event. KFOR became the first Oklahoma station to broadcast aerial helicopter footage in high definition on March 11, 2010.\n\nChannel 4's news department began operations along with the station on June 6, 1949, originally consisting of 10-minute-long newscasts at sign-on and sign-off, using wire copies of local news headlines read by anchors over still newspaper photographs. Bruce Palmer, the station's first news director, wanted to provide more immediacy to news coverage; he believed the restrictions placed on television news would result in broadcasts detailing only a limited number of stories at a time, outside of weather reports, and foresaw that television news would concentrate on films or photographs to help tell the story. The television station's news department utilized news staff from WKY radio to serve as reporters and photographers. (A collection of 16 mm news footage shot by WKY-TV between 1953 and 1979 was donated to the Oklahoma Historical Society, which made the films available on its website and a dedicated YouTube channel, in 2013.) Within a few years, WKY had employed a staff of 44 Oklahoma-based reporters and additional correspondents in three surrounding states. In 1950, WKY-TV became one of the first television stations in the country to employ a mobile broadcasting unit to conduct live broadcasts that would be relayed to the Oklahoma City studio or to film on-scene footage on kinescope for later broadcast; the unit—which had its electronic equipment installed by station engineers—employed up to three cameras, one of which was stationed on a special platform on the roof of the bus, and included a 12-inch television receiver built onto its side to display the direct-to-studio feed (this vehicle was replaced in 1969, with a proprietary mobile color unit). Among the events that the unit was sent to cover during the station's early years were the Oklahoma Republican and Democratic State Conventions, both of which were relayed live from the Municipal Auditorium, respectively in February and April 1952.\n\nIn January 1951, WKY-TV became the first station in the U.S. to provide coverage of state legislature sessions, which were conducted from the Oklahoma State Capitol twice a week. Channel 4 claimed to have made the fastest showing of any sound on film ever to have been processed and aired on television at the time, when on February 8, 1952, WKY-TV aired anchor John Field's introductory remarks that were filmed 15 minutes prior to that evening's newscast. The Houston film processor used by the station allowed WKY-TV to broadcast news coverage only a few hours after it was shot on-scene. The station is also purported to be the first in the U.S. to have been allowed access to film a court proceeding on December 13, 1953, while covering the trial of accused murderer Billy Eugene Manley. A WKY-TV film crew (led by reporter Frank McGee) was placed in a specially constructed, enclosed booth in the rear of the trial's courtroom at the Oklahoma County Courthouse, with a microphone hidden near the front of the court recording the proceedings. A small button was placed on the desk of Judge A. P. Van Meter to allow him to automatically discontinue operation of the cameras at any time. The swearing in of the jury, some testimony and Manley's sentencing was filmed for later news broadcasts.\n\nThe station's ascendance in the local news ratings occurred primarily under the stewardship of longtime news director Ernie Schultz (who joined the station as a reporter and photographer in 1955, before being promoted to news director and noon news anchor in 1964). The station hired top-drawer talent and based its journalistic style around in-depth reporting. In 1972, Pam Henry—who contracted polio at 14 months old, and had served as the national poster child for the March of Dimes in 1959—was hired by channel 4 as an assignment reporter, becoming the first female to work as a news reporter on Oklahoma television; after a brief stint working in Washington, D.C., Henry would later work at other television stations in Oklahoma City and Lawton as well as a 16-year run as manager of news and public affairs at OETA. From 1973 to 1978, WKY-TV aired \"Spectrum\", a weekly prime time public affairs show with a newsmagazine format, which incorporated feature segments on local stories and people of importance and issues affecting Oklahoma's minority community. A documentary featured on the program, \"Through The Looking Glass Darkly\" (produced and reported by eventual NBC News correspondent Bob Dotson, about the history of blacks in Oklahoma), became the first program from an Oklahoma television station to win an Emmy Award in 1974.\n\nThe station is well known in the Oklahoma City market for the longevity of its anchors as well as the two families that have had roots with the station. In 1979, Linda Cavanaugh—who began her broadcasting career at the station on October 17, 1977 as an assignment reporter and news photographer, before being promoted to lead anchor of the weekend newscasts in June 1978—became the first female to co-anchor an evening newscast at channel 4 when she was appointed as lead co-anchor for the station's 6:00 and 10:00 p.m. newscasts, alongside George Tomek (who also became lead anchor of the station's midday newscast that same year) and Brad Edwards, respectively. Besides Tomek, Cavanaugh's co-anchors throughout her tenure also included Gary Essex (1981–1982), Jerry Adams (1982–1987), Jane Jayroe (1984–1987), Dan Slocum (later known as Eric Slocum after leaving KFOR for KOMO-TV in Seattle; 1987–1990), Bob Bruce (1990–1992), Devin Scillian (1992–1995) and finally, Kevin Ogle (1996–2017). In 1989, Cavanaugh and chief photographer Tony Stizza were awarded the Edward Weintal Prize for Diplomatic Reporting for its documentary \"From Red Soil to Red Square,\" which detailed life in the Soviet Union, a principal trade partner with Oklahoma's agricultural industry, under the territory's glasnost. The two partnered on several other projects including \"Tapestry\", a 1996 documentary on the lives of several survivors of the bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building one year after the terror attack, which was honored with four Emmys, a National Gabriel Award Certificate of Merit as well as several accolades by, among others, the Oklahoma Association of Broadcasters, the National Press Club and the Society of Professional Journalists. Cavanaugh holds the record as the longest-serving news anchor in Oklahoma television, having served as primary co-anchor at KTVY/KFOR for 38 years until her retirement from broadcasting on December 15, 2017. (She is also the second-longest-tenured television news personality in Oklahoma, behind only Gary England, who served as chief meteorologist at rival KWTV for 41 years from 1972 to 2013.) Replacing her on the 6:00 and 10:00 p.m. broadcasts was Joleen Chaney, who first joined KFOR as a weekend evening anchor/reporter in 2008, and after a two-year reporting stint at KWTV beginning in June 2014, returned as co-anchor of the weekday 4:00, 5:00 and 6:30 p.m. newscasts in July 2016; Heather Holeman, who first served as weekday morning anchor/reporter from 2000 to 2007 and returned to KFOR in 2015 as a weekday morning traffic reporter, concurrently replaced Cavanaugh as 4:30 p.m. anchor and Chaney as 5:00 p.m. co-anchor.\n\nThe Ogle family have been part of the station in some manner since the 1960s. Jack Ogle joined WKY-TV as its main news anchor in 1962, and became known for his interpersonal, \"\" approach to his on-air delivery; his tenure also featured prominent anchor/reporters George Tomek, Ernie Schultz and Jerry Adams. After Schultz moved to a role as WKY-TV's director of information, Ogle became news director in 1970 and served in that capacity for seven years; he continued to occasionally appear on channel 4 as well as rivals KOCO and KWTV after departing as anchor/news director role to do regular commentary pieces. His eldest son, Kevin Ogle, first worked at channel 4 as a reporter from 1986 to 1989; he returned as a weekend evening anchor/reporter in 1993, before being promoted to weeknight co-anchor in 1996. Middle son, Kent, was hired as a reporter in 1994; after brief stints anchoring the weekend morning and, later, weekend evening newscasts starting in 1994, Kent was moved to the weekday morning and noon newscasts in 1997 (two of Jack's other descendants, youngest son Kelly Ogle and granddaughter by way of Kevin, Abigail Ogle, respectively serve as evening co-anchor at KWTV and weeknight 6:00 p.m. co-anchor/field reporter at KOCO-TV). In 2006, Kevin began hosting \"The Rant\", a segment airing most Monday through Thursdays during the 10:00 p.m. newscast that features viewer opinions on a selected news story, with the Thursday edition serving as an \"open topic\" forum featuring positive and critical comments on multiple subjects.\n\nThe late Bob Barry, Sr. was also a fixture for many years, starting his television career at WKY-TV as its lead sports anchor in 1966, while maintaining his duties as the radio play-by-play voice of the Oklahoma Sooners (a position to which Barry was appointed by Bud Wilkinson in 1961; Barry called radio broadcasts of OU, and later Oklahoma State, football and basketball games with Jack Ogle until 1974). Barry became sports director in 1970, holding that position for 27 of his 42 years at Channel 4; he remained a part-time evening sports anchor until his retirement in May 2008. His son, Bob Barry, Jr., became weekend sports anchor/reporter at KTVY in 1982, working along Bob Sr. for 25 years and assuming his father's role as sports director in 1997; the younger Barry—who was known for his jovial, off-the-cuff style—served as KFOR's sports director and weeknight sports anchor until the day prior to his death in an auto-motorcycle accident in June 2015. Collectively, including a posthumous win by Bob Barry Jr. in 2016, the Barrys earned 22 \"Sportscaster of the Year\" awards from the National Sportscasters and Sportswriters Association (Bob, Sr. holds the record for most wins with 15). In February 2016, Brian Brinkley (who joined KFOR as weekend sports anchor in 1991) succeeded Barry Jr. as sports director.\n\nThe station is known for its \"In Your Corner\" series of consumer advocacy reports, which focus on investigations into reported scams, area businesses accused of ripping off consumers, and occasionally, issues of corruption in Oklahoma state and local governments. Debuting in 1981, the segment was created and originally conducted by Brad Edwards, who joined channel 4 as a reporter/photographer in 1973, before being promoted to 10:00 p.m. anchor in 1977. Edwards also started several community initiatives overseen by the station that help low-income residents, including \"Warmth 4 Winter\" (a partnership with The Salvation Army Central Oklahoma Area Command and local dry cleaners to collect donated winter coats and other winter clothing for needy Oklahomans) and \"Fans 4 Oklahomans\" (a drive held each summer to collect boxed fans for donation to the elderly and poor who cannot afford or do not have air conditioning). Following Edwards's death due to complications from endocarditis, vasculitis and a brain aneurysm in May 2006, duties for the \"In Your Corner\" segment were rotated between anchors Lance West and Ali Meyer, and assignment reporters Scott Hines and Cherokee Ballard in the interim until Hines was promoted to a full-time consumer investigative reporting role in 2007, remaining in that role until his departure from KFOR on September 26, 2019. Adam Snider (who previously served as an assignment reporter at KFOR from 2012 until 2016, when he joined eventual sister station WKRN-TV in Nashville in the same capacity) was subsequently named as Hines' replacement, returning to KFOR in December 2019.\n\nOn January 5, 1981, KTVY moved its early evening newscast one hour earlier to 5:00 p.m. and expanded it to one hour (it was the first station in Oklahoma City to air an hour-long newscast in that timeslot, predating the launch of KOKH-TV's own 5:00 p.m. news hour by 34 years). The move resulted in the station shifting \"NBC Nightly News\" to 6:00 p.m., airing on a half-hour delay from its network-recommended slot. The early-evening newscast was split into two half-hour programs at 5:00 and 6:00 p.m., bookended by \"Nightly News\", on August 19, 1985. On May 11, 1990, coinciding with its permanent adoption of a 24-hour programming schedule, KFOR-TV implemented the \"24-Hour News Source\" concept. Produced outside of its regularly scheduled, long-form newscasts and half-hourly updates during \"Today\", the station began airing 30-second-long news updates near the top of each hour—even during prime time and overnight programming—during local commercial break inserts within syndicated and NBC network programs. (Producers and other newsroom personnel anchored the overnight update segments for several years during the 1990s.) Management with rival KOCO, which would also launch the hourly update format on May 14, subsequently sued KFOR and then-owner Palmer Communications on grounds that the former infringed on KOCO's exclusive local rights to the \"24-Hour News Source\" moniker that it had held since 1980 by marketing as \"Your 24-Hour News and Information Station\" (a slogan that was changed in November 1990—following the settlement of the lawsuit—to \"Where the News Comes First,\" which was usually amended to include an oblique reference to the update concept), and that KFOR's three-day jump on instituting the concept created viewer confusion that denied KOCO immediate recognition with its own rollout. Channel 4 continued to run hourly newsbriefs exclusively in daytime and late fringe slots until 2006, when they were reduced to two afternoon segments that served as de facto promotions for the evening newscasts (, the station continues to air a promotional \"update\" segment between programs each weekday around 3:00 p.m.). Upon joining KFOR in July 1991, Galen Culver (who is currently married to Saturday morning anchor Tara Blume) started \"Is This a Great State or What?\", a regular feature airing Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays during the 5:00 p.m. newscast that focuses on stories of interesting places and people around Oklahoma.\n\nJust prior to and following the adoption of the \"NewsChannel 4\" brand in August 1992, KFOR-TV began to slowly expand its local news programming, starting under the direction of then-general manager Bill Katsafanas and news director Melissa Klinzing, who enacted the strategy to gear KFOR as \"the CNN of the [Oklahoma City] market\". On June 15 of that year, the station added a weekday afternoon, lifestyle-focused newscast at 4:30 p.m. (originally titled \"First News at 4:30\"). Two months later on August 15, channel 4 became the second Oklahoma City station to debut weekend morning newscasts, originally airing Saturdays and—beginning on August 23—Sundays from 7:00 to 9:00 a.m.; then on August 17, KFOR expanded its weekday noon newscast to a full hour. On February 7, 1993, KFOR debuted \"Flashpoint\", a half-hour Sunday morning talk show that was originally moderated by Devin Scillian (who developed a program of the same title and format at WDIV-TV in Detroit in 1996). Following their run as analysts for channel 4's coverage of the 1992 presidential election, news producer Mary Ann Eckstein—who later became KFOR's news director in 1996—developed the program around panelists and former Oklahoma gubernatorial candidates Mike Turpen and Burns Hargis. Hargis left the show in 2008 to become president of Oklahoma State University–Stillwater and was replaced by former Oklahoma City mayor Kirk Humphreys (who left the show in June 2019 to focus on his job as CEO of local real estate investment firm Humphreys Capital, with former-State Senator-turned-Lieutenant Governor Todd Lamb replacing him as the conservative on the panel).\n\nDuring coverage of the April 19, 1995 Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building bombing, the station erroneously reported during that day's coverage that a member of the Nation of Islam had called in to the station to take credit for the bombing (which was actually orchestrated by Timothy McVeigh, who associated himself with the Patriot movement, and Terry Nichols), even though it cautioned that the claim might have been a crank call; similarly, in the aftermath of the bombing, then-KFOR reporter Jayna Davis reported on a story which claimed that McVeigh was seen drinking beer with a former Iraqi soldier in an Oklahoma City tavern (Davis would later write a 2005 book, \"The Third Terrorist\", which looked at the conspiracy theory that a Middle Eastern man had been involved in planning the bombing). On May 1, 1995, KFOR debuted a half-hour extension of its 6:00 p.m. newscast—replacing first-run syndicated programs that the station had traditionally aired in the 6:30 timeslot, and originally serving to provide proceedings of the aftermath of and developments in the investigation into the Murrah Building bombing—focusing primarily on national and international news headlines that was modeled similarly to ABC, CBS and NBC's national evening newscasts. KFOR-TV has avidly competed with KWTV for first place among the market's local television newscasts for decades. It had placed second behind KWTV in the morning and late evening news timeslots. Nielsen later found an error in KFOR's ratings reports in September 2008, in which share points were mistakenly assigned to KFOR's 4.1 digital multicast signal from 2005 to 2008; the corrected ratings showed that it had placed #2 in all timeslots at that time, a rarity given the ratings declines that NBC's programming and its affiliates' local newscasts overall had suffered beginning in 2004.\n\nOn June 5, 2006, KFOR-TV began producing a half-hour weeknight 9:00 p.m. newscast for KAUT-TV (which competes against Fox affiliate KOKH-TV's hour-long newscast that debuted in May 1996); it expanded news programming on KAUT with the debut of a two-hour extension of its weekday morning newscast on September 8, 2008. On July 12, 2009, starting with its 10:00 p.m. newscast, KFOR became the first commercial television station in the Oklahoma City market to begin broadcasting its local newscasts in high definition (it also upgraded its severe weather ticker to be overlaid on HD programming without having to downconvert the content to standard definition); the \"Is This a Great State or What?\" segments began to be produced in HD that January and the KAUT newscasts were included in the overall upgrade. On September 7, 2011, KFOR-TV launched a half-hour 4:00 p.m. newscast that features an emphasis on viewer interaction through social media, mixing news, lifestyle and entertainment stories with trending stories on the internet and web videos. On August 27, 2012, KFOR expanded its weekday morning newscast to three hours, with the addition of an hour at 4:00 a.m.\n\nKFOR-TV is one of two stations within the Oklahoma City market that is known for its comprehensive coverage of severe weather affecting the state. The station's Doppler radar system, branded as \"4WARN Storm Scanner\", provides live dual-Doppler radar data from sites at the Oklahoma City studios and near Newcastle (the latter of which operates at 1 million watts); both also utilize data from National Weather Service (NWS) radar sites nationwide. Through a content agreement with iHeartMedia, KFOR's \"4WARN Storm Team\" meteorologists also provide local weather updates and, in the event of significant severe weather situations (such as a tornado warning) affecting Central Oklahoma, audio simulcasts of long-form severe weather coverage for the group's Oklahoma City radio cluster: KTOK (1000 AM), KGHM (1340 AM), KBRU (94.7 FM), KXXY-FM (96.1 FM), KTST (101.9 FM) and KJYO (102.7 FM).\n\nChannel 4 is claimed to be the first television station in the United States to have established a professional meteorological department, as a result of the 1951 hire of weather director Wally Kinnan. It also claims to have hired the first local broadcast meteorologist in Oklahoma, Harry Volkman, who joined WKY-TV in March 1952 after a two-year stint at KOTV in Tulsa. On September 5, 1954, it became the first television station to broadcast a tornado warning, doing so for a tornadic thunderstorm approaching Meeker that afternoon. WKY-TV reporter Frank McGee relayed a tornado forecast issued by and intended to be released exclusively to Tinker Air Force Base staff over the phone to Volkman. General manager P.A. Sugg – who, with Oklahoma U.S. Senator Mike Monroney, had been pushing the U.S. Government to overturn a ban on disseminating tornado alerts to the public, believing the high fatality risk and the need to allow residents to take safety precautions outweighed government concerns that it would incite panic – instructed Volkman to deliver an on-air bulletin of the \"tornado risk\" for central Oklahoma that afternoon. Though he had apprehension of facing arrest for violating government rules, Volkman agreed to deliver the warning after Sugg volunteered to take responsibility. Volkman narrowly avoided being fired by OPUBCO management upon finding out that viewers in the tornado's path sent letters thanking him and WKY-TV for the warning (Volkman would remain at channel 4 until 1954, when he became a meteorologist at KWTV).\n\nIn 1958, WKY-TV became the first Oklahoma television station to install a weather radar system, utilizing a converted surplus military radar that was used until 1970. Kinnan had earlier developed methodology to predict and detect tornadoes using radar by identifying wind patterns to predict precipitation movement, despite the NWS's belief that there was no method possible to predict them with a degree of accuracy. That year also saw the hiring of Jim Williams, who would later succeed Volkman's successor, Bob Thomas, as the station's chief meteorologist; Williams formerly held the record as the state's longest-serving television meteorologist, working at channel 4 for 32 years until his retirement in 1990 (Gary England, who served as KWTV's chief meteorologist for 41 years from October 1972 until August 2013, surpassed Williams for the title in 2005). Mike Morgan—who replaced one of Williams' two short-lived successors, Wayne Shattuck, who himself was Morgan's direct predecessor for the same position at KOCO-TV—took over as KFOR's chief meteorologist in 1993. In 1986, KTVY became the first television station in the country to introduce colorized Doppler radar. In 1995, KFOR became the first television station to transmit images over cell phones with the development of \"First Video,\" technology which allowed the station's news crews to send photos and video of severe weather over mobile relays for broadcast (KWTV claims to have originated this method with a similar system developed by former anchor Roger Cooper in 1992, which allowed near-moving video to be relayed to the station over cell phones). The \"First Video\" technology won a Heartland Emmy for technological broadcast innovation in 1996.\n\nIn recent years, KFOR has been locked in a competition KWTV and, to a lesser extent, KOCO for having the top weather technology in the U.S. In 1997, KFOR debuted \"The Edge,\" a radar system which updated radar data in near-real-time intervals (with Morgan having once claimed that it was \"20 to 25 minutes\" ahead of NEXRAD data, which has a five- to 10-minute update run on average, used by KFOR's two principal competitors) and incorporated street-level mapping. Following the May 1999 tornadoes, with which KFOR's coverage (as well as KWTV and KOCO's) were credited for their extensive warning, Morgan was criticized by other area meteorologists, including Gary England, for taking a \"chicken little\" approach to tornado coverage, either by providing too much coverage of tornadoes that do not pose an immediate threat to life and property or by misidentifying benign cloud formations in thunderstorms. In April 2013, KFOR partnered with veteran storm chaser Reed Timmer to help supplement the station's storm chasing fleet, providing coverage of severe weather events.\n\n\n\n"}

Macquarie Park is located 13 kilometres north-west of the Sydney central business district in the local government area of the City of Ryde. Macquarie Park is often referred to as “North Shore” or simply “North”.\n\nMacquarie Park was part of the suburb of North Ryde until it was gazetted as a suburb in its own right on 5 February 1999, and many businesses still use North Ryde as the address. Both suburbs share the 2113 postcode but Macquarie University, which is located at the northern part of the suburb, has its own postcode of 2109.\n\nThe whole area between the Parramatta and Lane Cove Rivers was originally known by its Aboriginal name Wallumatta. Contact with the first white settlement's bridgehead into Australia quickly devastated much of the population through epidemics of smallpox and other diseases. Their descendants live on, though their language, social system, way of life and traditions are mostly lost. The Aboriginal name survives in a local reserve, the Wallumatta Nature Reserve, located at the corner of Twin and Cressy roads, North Ryde. Very few remnants of Sydney Turpentine-Ironbark Forest still exist. The most substantial undisturbed area is the Wallumatta Nature Reserve in North Ryde, which is owned and managed by the National Parks and Wildlife Service. This small and critically endangered reserve, also known as the Macquarie Hospital Bushland, is one of the last remnants of the remaining 0.5% (as at 2007) of original and endangered turpentine-ironbark forests on Wianamatta shale soil in Sydney. See Sydney Turpentine-Ironbark Forest.\n\nMacquarie Park is located within what was once the larger suburb of North Ryde.\n\nMacquarie Park is named for Governor Lachlan Macquarie (1762–1824), a British military officer and colonial administrator who served as the Governor of New South Wales from 1810 to 1821. The area that is now Macquarie Park was part of the suburb of North Ryde from the late 19th century. The area was once filled with market gardens, poultry farms and vast tracts of bushland, with many beautiful picnic spots and waterfalls.\n\nThe mid-1960s saw the establishment of Macquarie University and the 'Macquarie Park Employment Area' which saw the rezoning of 'Green Belt' bushland to allow for industrial activities. The initial concept for Macquarie Park was based on the idea of a similar hi-tech industrial area surrounding Stanford University in Palo Alto, California, the goal being to provide for the interaction between industries and the university.\n\nDuring the 1970s, companies such as Amalgamated Wireless Australasia Limited, Beiersdorf, Racal and Universal Press located their corporate headquarters in the area. Macquarie Park has since gained a reputation of being a leading high-tech industrial area in Australia. It attracts many local and international companies from high-tech fields including electronic, scientific, computing, medical, communication, pharmaceutical and business supply.\n\nMacquarie Park is Northern Suburb's centre for major commercial and retail districts. The \"Sydney global economic corridor\", is used to describe a geographical \"arch\" of Sydney, home to international corporations.\n\nThe corporate prestige, close access to facilities and aesthetically pleasing environment are an attraction for many corporations. Macquarie Park had a total number of 32 308 jobs in 2001, making it the fourth largest concentration of jobs in NSW after Sydney CBD, North Sydney and Parramatta. Large businesses in the suburb include: AC Neilsen, Avaya, AstraZeneca, BOC, Canon, CA, Compuware, Australian Radio Network: 101.7 WSFM & Edge 96.1, CSC, Kyocera, Fujitsu, Fuji Xerox, Ford Motor Co/Premiere Automotive Group (Aston Martin, Jaguar, Volvo, Land Rover), Foxtel, General Motors (Holden & Saab), George Weston Foods, Hitachi, Hyundai, Johnson & Johnson, Kenwood, Kimberly-Clark, Lucent Technologies, Metcash, Microsoft, Nestle Purina, Nortel Networks, Novartis, Bilfinger Berger, Optus (moved in late 2007 from North Sydney), Oracle Corporation, Orix, Philips, Raytheon, Sanofi-Aventis, Siemens, Memjet, Smiths Medical, Sony, Toshiba, TPG Telecom, Warner Music Group, Wesfarmers Industrial & Safety. Businesses that have previously operated in Macquarie Park include Mix 106.5 (until 2006 when it moved to Hornsby), Network Ten (until 1991 when it moved to Ultimo then Pyrmont in 1996) and Global Television Network Studios (until mid-2007).\n\nMacquarie Centre is a major regional shopping Centre opposite Macquarie University and next to Macquarie University Station. There are also two smaller nearby shopping centres, Eden Park Centre on Lane Cove Road and Lachlan's Line (currently under construction with stage one due to open at the end of 2019).\n\nMacquarie Park has a wide variety of restaurants and cafes and is known as a major dining destination in the Northern Suburbs of Sydney. There are a large number of restaurants ranging from Australian to Chinese (including Cantonese), Japanese and Korean restaurants and eateries.\n\nThere are many hotels in Macquarie Park. This includes Astra Apartments, Quest, Courtyard by Marriott and Meriton Suites.\n\nA substantial re-development of the Macquarie University Station Precinct (also known as the Herring Road Precinct) \nin Macquarie Park is planned as part of the NSW state government's \"\"Priority Growth Precincts\"\" program (originally known as the \"\"Urban Activation Precincts\"\" program). The objective is to provide housing and employment close to transport to help meet Sydney's growth needs, including up to 2,400 new homes by 2021 and up to 5,800 by 2031 that are within a ten-minute walk from Macquarie University Station. Following public display and consultation, the rezoning proposal was finalised in September 2015.\n\nMacquarie Park has access to the M2 Hills Motorway, that runs through the northern part of the suburb. It is serviced by Forest Coach Lines, Hillsbus, State Transit, Transit Systems and Transdev NSW bus services.\n\nDuring peak hour, the whole area gets very congested with traffic.\n\n, and stations are underground stations on the Metro North West Line which opened on 26 May 2019. Until 30 September 2018 they were on the Epping to Chatswood rail line operated by Sydney Trains. The line opened on 23 February 2009 and closed for metro conversion on September 30, 2018. \n\nAt the 2011 census, only 27.3% of employed people travelled to work on public transport and 42.4% by car (either as driver or as passenger).\n\nMacquarie University is one of Australia's largest universities. It features a 126-hectare park-like campus beside a high-technology corridor. The University is affiliated with a number of colleges also located in the suburb including Dunmore Lang College, Robert Menzies College an Anglican college, Macquarie Christian Studies Institute and Sydney Institute of Business & Technology.\n\nMacquarie University has in recent years become a major research centre, with Macquarie University Hospital and the Cochlear Research Centre located within the university grounds.\n\nExcelsia College moved to a Macquarie Park campus in 2016.\n\nAt the 2016 census, Macquarie Park recorded a population of 8,144. Of these: \n\nMacquarie Park is in the State of New South Wales electorates of Lane Cove and Ryde, and the Federal electorate of Division of Bennelong.\n\nLike the rest of the Sydney basin, Macquarie Park has a humid sub-tropical climate with warm to hot summers and cool, damp winters. The record low of was recorded on 28 July 1986. The record maximum temperature was recorded more recently, on 21 December 1994 when the temperature reached .\n\nMacquarie Park is also the location for the Lane Cove River Tourist Park where the Australian soap opera \"Home and Away\" is partly filmed.\n"}

It is the last broadcast of David Brierley's voice as K9 (as John Leeson returned in the next season).\n\nThe serial is set on the planets Skonnos and Crinoth. In the serial, minotaur-like aliens called the Nimons plot to invade Skonnos by creating a tunnel in time and space linked between two artificial black holes.\n\nThe glory days of the Skonnan Empire are long since past, but many of its citizens and soldiers yearn for conquest. The arrival of the mysterious horned Nimon on Skonnos brought hope of imperial restoration. The fearsome creature from within its labyrinth has promised to rebuild the Empire providing it receives a series of tributes from the Skonnans and their fawning, arrogant leader Soldeed. This tribute is to comprise groups of youthful sacrifices from the nearby planet Aneth, as well as a supply of hymetusite crystals. Young people have thus been abducted and transferred to the labyrinth. On the final collection, however, the interstellar craft bearing the sacrifices breaks down in space. The ancient war craft has worn out, and when the co-pilot over extends the engines, the Pilot is killed when a control panel explodes.\n\nThe Fourth Doctor, Romana and K9 are in the TARDIS console room where he is making modifications to the ship. Various controls are disconnected, but unfortunately the area of space he has chosen to materialise the ship in is close to a manufactured black hole and they are in danger of being drawn in. He extends the TARDIS door force field to a nearby spaceship – the Skonnan battle cruiser – and he and Romana board it. Once aboard the Doctor notices an abundance of radioactive hymetusite crystals, and soon finds a hold full of young prisoners. They are from Aneth, and one, Teka, has a seemingly misplaced faith in another prisoner, Seth, to free them from their incarceration. The Co-Pilot investigates the hold and discovers the Doctor and Romana. He takes them to the bridge at gunpoint and forces them to fix the ship. Romana suggests adapting the ship to use a hymetusite crystal power source, and one is brought to her while the Doctor returns to the TARDIS to gather supplies. Aboard the TARDIS the Doctor learns from K9 of the collapse of the Skonnan Empire in civil war.\n\nWith the Skonnan craft repaired the Co-Pilot starts to move his ship away; the TARDIS is stranded and facing obliteration in the vastness of space. The Doctor bounces the TARDIS off the approaching asteroid and starts to repair the console in order to pilot the ship to Skonnos and confront the evil there. The planet is dominated by the Nimon, which exists within its labyrinthine Power Complex into which only Soldeed may venture. The Nimon is angry when Soldeed reports that the last batch of sacrifices have not arrived and says it will withhold the arms that will help rebuild the Skonnan Empire.\n\nSoldeed emerges from the Power Complex and hears from his guard captain Sorak that the ship has been found. It arrives on Skonnos and Soldeed leads the party of greeting, being unnerved to see Romana aboard. The Co-Pilot lies that she is the cause of all the problems on the ship, being a pirate who stole aboard and killed the Captain. Soldeed does not believe this and then forces the Co-Pilot into the Nimon Power Complex where he faces certain death. Moments later Romana and the Anethans are loaded up with hymetusite and sent into the maze. The TARDIS materialises in the central square of Skonnos and the Doctor is taken to Soldeed. He soon escapes, and heads into the Power Complex.\n\nDeep in the Complex – whose walls seem to shift and change creating various labyrinthine patterns that all lead to the Nimon – Romana finds husks of previous Anethans, drained of life. The Co-Pilot also arrives, still pleading for his life, and when the Nimon appears it despatches the desperate soldier first before turning its mighty horns on Romana and the cowering Anethans. The Doctor arrives and distracts the Nimon, saving Romana, Seth and Teka who run after him. The other Anethans are too scared to leave.\n\nThe Nimon has reached the power source room and starts manipulating the controls of the machine, which causes the Complex to glow with energy. A shimmering tunnel appears, and a travel globe bearing two more Nimons comes down it. They announce that the planet Crinoth is dying and that all the Nimons must continue the Great Journey of Life to Skonnos. Once the Nimons leave the Doctor examines the globes: they are travelling vessels that have journeyed down a tunnel set between two black holes. The Doctor accidentally sends the globe down the tunnel with Romana in it but before he can reverse this Soldeed arrives and uses his staff to destroy the control panel.\n\nRomana arrives in the dying world of Crinoth and encounters many Nimons and a broken old man named Sezom, who helped the Nimons establish themselves on his world and now knows they have destroyed it. He has also discovered that when jacenite is integrated into the staff that he was supplied with by the Nimons, it has the ability to stun them. He gives Romana a piece, but is killed by a Nimon while helping her to escape.\n\nSeth shoots Soldeed unconscious and the Doctor attempts to repair the transportation system. Just as he is about to complete the repairs, the Nimons return to the power source room and restrain him. However, they then reverse the tunnel, which brings Romana back from Crinoth. Romana tosses the jacenite to Seth, who now has possession of Soldeed's staff, and he uses it to stun two of the Nimons. Having managed to free himself from Soldeed's laboratory, K9 arrives in time to deal with the remaining one. Soldeed, having escaped from the power source room, has seen the multiple Nimons and his faith is badly damaged. He is shot down by Seth but manages to trigger a chain reaction which will destroy the Complex. The Doctor and his party make their way out, using K9 to work out a proper exit path through the labyrinth. They escape and join up with the remaining members of the Skonnan military council, all of whom evacuate the main square as the Nimon Power Complex explodes.\n\nLater in the TARDIS the Doctor watches as Seth and Teka pilot a spacecraft away from Skonnos, having been granted their freedom. Elsewhere Crinoth can be seen disintegrating. It seems that the Nimon threat is over.\n\nThe Doctor alludes to the story of Theseus and the Minotaur, of which the Nimon story is a partial retelling.\n\nPaul Cornell, Martin Day and Keith Topping gave a mixed review of the serial, stating \"With its cheap design work, and a wonderfully watchable OTT performance from Graham Crowden, The Horns of Nimon is by turns brilliant and dull\".\n\n\"Doctor Who: The Television Companion\"s David J. Howe and Stephen James Walker noted that the show had acquired a low reputation but they considered this to be undeserved. Although \"admittedly a little more light hearted than usual\" it did feature a performance by Tom Baker which was \"rather more serious and intense here than in most other stories of a similar vintage\". Production values were \"no worse than on many other stories of this era, and rather better than on some\" and the story was \"ingenious and fun\".\n\nPatrick Mulkern of \"Radio Times\" was very critical of the serial which he described as \"a turgid quagmire of vapid characters, amateur dramatics, mirthless antics and clattering sets\". Although the script contained \"interesting concepts\" these were not portrayed well due to the \"absurd\" Nimon costumes. Mulkern also thought the cast gave \"terrible performances\" with the exception of Tom Baker and Lalla Ward.\n\n\"Den of Geek\"s Andrew Blair selected \"The Horns of Nimon\" as one of the ten \"Doctor Who\" stories that would make great musicals.\n\nA novelisation of this serial, written by Terrance Dicks, was published by Target Books in October 1980. Dicks begins with a history of the Skonnan Empire and Soldeed, culminating in the arrival of the Nimon. Original author Anthony Read completed a new novelisation for audiobook publisher AudioGO in 2013, but with that company's suspension of operations, the likelihood of its eventual release is now unclear.\n\n\"The Horns of Nimon\" was released on VHS in June 2003. It was released in a DVD box set entitled \"Myths and Legends\" along with \"The Time Monster\" and \"Underworld\" in March 2010. In Region 1 North America DVD, \"Horns of Nimon\" as a single title, with extras and commentary, was released on 6 July 2010. This serial was released as part of the Doctor Who DVD Files in Issue 139 on 30 April 2014.\n\n"}

Mount Nebo (31°45.9'N 35°43.1'E) is the highest among a handful of Pisgah summits; an arid cluster of hilltops on the western edge of the Trans-Jordanian Plateau. Arabic names for Pisgah include: Fasga (Phasga), Jabal Siyāgha (transliterated also as Siaghah/Siâghah/Siyagha/Siyāgha, etc.), Rās as-Siyāgha and Rujm Siyāgha.\n\nIn Deuteronomy, God commanded Moses to climb up and view the Promised Land from Mount Nebo:\n\"Then Moses climbed Mount Nebo from the plains of Moab to the top of Pisgah, across from Jericho.

The two lowest-ranked losers are eliminated from the finals, while the two highest-ranked winners progress straight to week 3.\n\nWeek 2\n\n\nThe two losing teams are eliminated, the two winning teams progress to week 3.\n\nWeek 3\n\n\nThe two losing teams are eliminated, the two winning teams progress to week four.\n\nWeek 4\n\n\nScheduling\n\nA key element of an effective McIntyre system is scheduling in week 1. In the first week games must be played in the following order: 4 v 5, 3 v 6, 2 v 7, 1 v 8. Teams in the first two games are playing for the chance of a bye in the second week of the finals. If the final two games ultimately go as predicted, then the chance of a bye or the risk of elimination disappears. Therefore, those games need to be played last so that there is never a situation where two teams know that their result would not matter.\n\n1st: Advances with a win to preliminary final (week 3). Must play the semi final with a loss, cannot be eliminated in week 1, and has an 18,75% of winning the tournament.\n\n2nd: Same as 1st, but has a more difficult opponent in week 1 (7th instead 8th).\n\n3rd: Advances to preliminary final with a win AND at least one upset in one of the two last qualifying finals (1st or 2nd loses his qualifying final). Must play the semi final with a win and no upset in last two qualifying finals or a loss if there is at least one hopeful result in two last qualifying finals. Is eliminated if he loses AND 1st and 2nd too. (Has a 15.625% of winning the tournament).\n\n4th: Advances to preliminary final with a win AND there are at least two upsets in remaining qualifying finals. It must play the semi final if there are, at least, two hopeful results in other qualifying finals, regardless his result. Is eliminated with a loss AND, at least, two upsets (He has a 12,5% of winning the tournament).\n\n5th: Same as 4th (but play away his qualifying final against 4th).\n\n6th: Advances to preliminary final with a win AND 7th and 8th win their qualifying finals. It must play the semi final with a win AND, if there is, at least, one hopeful result, OR, if he loses, if there are BOTH hopeful results in remaining qualifying finals. Is eliminated with a loss AND one upset, at least, in remaining qualifying finals. (He has a 9,375% of winning the tournament).\n\n7th: It cannot advance straight to preliminary final. Advances to semi final with a win and is eliminated with a loss (He has a 6,25% of winning the tournament).\n\n8th: Same as 7th (but he has a more difficult opponent in week 1 -1st instead 2nd).\n\n1st, 2nd, 7th and 8th depend on themselves. 3rd, 4th, 5th and 6th depend on their results and other qualifying finals results\n\nThe 2010 NRL Final Series:\nAt the qualifying finals, team 1 won and so went straight through to the preliminary finals. Team 4 also went through to the preliminary finals, because they won while teams 2 and 3 lost. However, teams 2 and 3 were not eliminated, but played again in the semi finals, because two teams ranking lower than them on the ladder also lost. Those two losing teams ranking lower than them, teams 5 and 8, were eliminated.\n\nThe major advantages of the system are the number of different combinations of teams which could make the final game and that no matches are repeated in the first three weeks. When compared to other final eight systems, many of which split the participants into two groups, the McIntyre system means only two of the 28 possible combinations (1v7 and 2v8) are impossible in the grand final.\n\nThe top two teams after the regular season are rewarded by being given a 'second life' within the finals. If either of these two teams lose to their much lower-ranked opponents in the first week, then one of the two losing teams ranked lower than them are eliminated, which means the 1st- and 2nd-ranked teams can withstand a loss in the finals and their season will continue, albeit with significant disadvantages.\n\nThis 'second life' advantage for the highest-ranked teams on the ladder can flow on to teams 3 and 4 (and possibly teams 5 and 6.) If only one of the top two on the ladder loses in the first week, then team 3 is not eliminated if it has lost. Similarly, if only one of the top three on the ladder loses in the first week, then team 4 is saved from elimination if it has lost.\n\nIf the top two teams win in the first week, then teams 7 and 8 will be the ones to be eliminated. Only two teams drop out, so even if they were to lose their games, teams 5 and 6 would still have another chance in the second week.\n\nWith its adoption by the NRL, debate has arisen over its fairness. The McIntyre system rewards teams who have form coming into the finals rather than during the whole season. The advantages given to a victor in the first week of the finals, even if that team is initially ranked 6th to 8th, includes a home final in the second week against a team ranked 3rd to 6th coming off a loss. This advantage given to lower-ranked teams that win in the first week are significant compared to the alternate final 8 system used by the AFL, which protects teams coming 1st to 4th from elimination and never give home finals to teams ranked 7th or 8th, regardless of whether they win or lose their matches.\n\nIn 2008, the first week of the NRL finals saw the then reigning grand finalists the Melbourne Storm lose to the 8th placed New Zealand Warriors. Granted a home final as a week 1 winner, the Warriors then defeated the Sydney Roosters in the second week and proceeded to the final 4, the first team ever to make it that far from 8th position, whereas the Storm had to travel to Brisbane and win away to continue on. This scenario was exceeded in 2009 when the Parramatta Eels, who had finished 8th defeated St George Illawarra Dragons. Parramatta, with a home advantage, proceeded to defeat the Gold Coast Titans in week 2, whereas the Dragons were eliminated from the competition in week 2 in their away match against the Brisbane Broncos. This gave them the dubious distinction of being the first minor premiers to be eliminated after two consecutive losses since the inception of the McIntyre System. Parramatta became the first team ranked last of the finalists to contest the grand final, only to lose to the 4th-placed Melbourne Storm, although this Premiership has been struck from the record due to salary cap breaches by the Storm. For the record, at least one top four team has lost its qualifying final in every year since this system was introduced in 1999, until 2011 when all top four teams won their qualifying final.\n\nAnother criticism is that, like many other top-8 systems, there is the possibility of games in the first week that are effectively meaningless, where teams have no risk of elimination and results only determine respective opponents and home ground advantage in the second week. In the McIntyre system if first-week results go as planned, then first defeats eighth and second defeats seventh. This leaves the teams who finished from third to sixth effectively playing \"dead rubbers\" in the first week, with the results merely reshuffling the order of these four teams. There is a requirement therefore that the 4v5 contest be played first. This raises a further criticism that the fate of the loser in this match is dependent upon the performance of the higher-ranked teams. A good example of this was the Dragons v Penrith final in 2004. The Dragons lost by a mere point, however, due to the higher ranked Bulldogs and Broncos losing the Dragons were eliminated.\n\nThis also makes scheduling much less flexible, since the first vs eighth game must be the last game played, in order to prevent the teams between third and sixth entering their qualifying finals knowing that the game is already a dead rubber. The newly formed ARL Commission accepted a recommendation to scrap the system as of 2012 on 22 February 2012. It was replaced by the final eight system currently used by the AFL.\n\nAnother anomaly of scheduling is that in the second week a team may play a higher-ranked opponent than the team they defeated, and similarly a first week loser may play an easier opponent than the team that defeated them. In the second week of the McIntyre system the third highest winner (i.e. the strongest winner of those playing) plays the highest-ranked loser rather than the second highest loser (i.e. the weakest loser). This may ensure no repetition of games in the second week, but it means higher-ranked teams end up with more difficult opponents simply for the sake of more interesting scheduling. An example of this happened in 2005 when the Wests Tigers (4th) defeated the North Queensland Cowboys (5th) in week one of the finals and were 'rewarded' in week 2 with a game against the 3rd placed Brisbane Broncos. Meanwhile, the Cowboys (ranked 5th and first week losers) played the Melbourne Storm who were ranked 6th.\n\nIn 2011, the 6th-placed New Zealand Warriors were beaten convincingly by the Brisbane Broncos (ranked 3rd) in its qualifying final by the score of 40–10. Following that match, then-Warriors coach Ivan Cleary was quoted as saying \"the way we played tonight, we don't deserve to be in the finals\". That loss saw them at risk of being eliminated initially, but were granted a reprieve after the two lower-ranking teams, North Queensland and Newcastle, also lost their finals. A sudden reverse in form would see them advance to the grand final, thus becoming the third team (after the St. George Illawarra Dragons in 1999 and the Sydney Roosters the season previous), to advance to the grand final after finishing sixth at the end of the season. Ultimately, the Warriors would lose to the second-placed Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles who had a much easier run to the decider.\n\nIn addition to the NRL, the McIntyre Final Eight System is also used in the Rugby League National League Three in Great Britain, the NSWRL Premier League and Jersey Flegg competitions. It will be used in the final heads up in Circuito Nacional de Poker (Spain).\n\n\n"}

The lake is formed by the damming of the Obey River, 7.3 miles (12 km) above its juncture with the Cumberland River at river mile 380. Portions of the lake also cover the Wolf River. Dale Hollow is one of four major flood control reservoirs for the Cumberland; the others being J. Percy Priest Dam, Wolf Creek Dam, and Center Hill Dam. It is also the site of Dale Hollow Lake State Park on the north (Kentucky) side.\n\nDale Hollow Reservoir lies mainly in northern Tennessee, where it covers portions of Clay, Pickett, and Overton Counties. Small arms of the lake also extend northward into the Kentucky counties of Cumberland and Clinton. The project consists of 27,700 acres (112 km²) of water and 24,842 acres (101 km²) of surrounding land.\n\nDale Hollow Dam and Lake was authorized by the Flood Control Act of 1938 and the River and Harbor Act of 1946. The project was completed by the United States Army Corps of Engineers in 1943. Hydroelectric power generating units were added in 1948, 1949 and 1953. The project was designed by the Corps of Engineers and built under their supervision by private contractors. The hydroelectric generators of Dale Hollow Dam are used to supply power to the surrounding countryside. The dam, power plant and reservoir are currently operated by the Nashville District of the Corps.\n\nThe lake is also used recreationally. Water sports are moderately popular, especially water skiing. Wakeboarding and tubing are two more water sports that can be seen regularly. The main recreational use is fishing.\n\nDale Hollow is well known as a prime location for smallmouth bass fishing, currently holding the world record for the largest such fish ever taken (11 lb., 15 oz). It is the lake that is linked with the name Billy Westmoreland, famed smallmouth angler of Celina, Tennessee. The lake and surrounding rivers, the Cumberland River and the Obey River also contain other species such as largemouth bass, crappie, muskellunge, walleye, catfish, gar, and trout.\n\nThe Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency and Kentucky Department of Fish and Wildlife each maintain jurisdiction over the lake's waters within their respective states. There is a reciprocal fishing agreement between the agencies, so recreational fisherman may be licensed by either state in order to fish in the reciprocal zone. Fishermen in areas of the lake outside the zone must be licensed by the governing agency.\n\nGeiger Island is an island in Dale Hollow Lake. It is designated as a primitive camping site by the Army Corps of Engineers, which manages Dale Hollow Lake. According to author Darren Shell, the site sees heavy usage during the summer months, and was a traditional camping site of the Boy Scout troops in the area for many years. Henry Geiger, the founder of nearby Cedar Lake Camp, a Christian youth camp in Livingston, Tennessee, was the first to begin camping on the island. The island bears his name.\n\n"}
{"id": "2091266", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2091266", "title": "The Way to the Stars", "text": "The Way to the Stars\n\nThe Way to the Stars is a 1945 British war drama film made by Two Cities Films. In the United States it was known as Johnny in the Clouds and distributed by United Artists. It was produced by Anatole de Grunwald and directed by Anthony Asquith. The screenplay was co-written by noted dramatist, Terence Rattigan, as a significant reworking of his 1942 play \"Flare Path\", which incorporated his Royal Air Force (RAF) experiences as a Flight Lieutenant. The film stars Michael Redgrave, John Mills, Rosamund John and Stanley Holloway.\n\nThe title, \"The Way to the Stars\", is often assumed to have been taken from the Latin motto of the RAF, \"Per ardua ad astra\". However, the literal translation of the RAF motto is \"Through adversity to the stars\". The alternative title, \"Johnny in the Clouds\", is derived from the poem recited in the film as tribute to a dead aviator.\n\nPilot Officer Peter Penrose (John Mills) is posted in the summer of 1940 as a pilot to (the fictional) No. 720 Squadron, at a new airfield, RAF Station Halfpenny Field. He is a very green \"15-hour sprog\" Bristol Blenheim pilot and is assigned to B Flight, under Flight Lieutenant David Archdale (Michael Redgrave).\n\nWhen No. 720 Squadron's commanding officer, Squadron Leader Carter (Trevor Howard, in his second but first credited film role), is shot down, Archdale takes over. While Penrose develops into a first-class pilot, he meets Iris Winterton (Renee Asherson), a young woman living with her domineering aunt at the Golden Lion hotel in the nearby town. Archdale marries Miss Todd (Rosamund John), the popular manager of the hotel, who is known to everyone as Toddy. The Archdales later have a son, Peter.\n\nThe action flashes forward to May 1942. The squadron is now flying Douglas Boston bombers. When Penrose shows signs of strain from extensive combat, Archdale has him posted to controller school, but is himself shot down and killed over France on Penrose's last mission. Penrose had been courting Iris, despite her aunt's disapproval, but Archdale's fate weighs heavily on his mind. Not wanting Iris to suffer if the same happened to him, he stops seeing her.\n\nNo. 720 Squadron is sent to the Middle East, but Penrose remains behind as a ground controller for a United States Army Air Forces B-17 Flying Fortress bombardment group, which takes over the airfield. He befriends USAAF Captain Johnny Hollis (Douglass Montgomery) and Lieutenant Joe Friselli (Bonar Colleano). On 17 August 1942, the American airmen participate in the first attack by the USAAF on Occupied France, later ruefully acknowledging that they underestimated the difficulties involved. Afterwards, Penrose is posted to flying duties with an RAF Avro Lancaster bomber unit.\n\nIn 1944, Penrose, now a squadron leader and pathfinder pilot, makes an emergency landing at Halfpenny Field, where he meets Iris again. Iris had decided to leave her aunt for good and join up. Toddy persuades a still-reluctant Penrose to propose to Iris, saying that she did not regret her own marriage in spite of her husband's death. Hollis, who has formed a platonic relationship with Toddy, is killed while trying to land a damaged returning bomber with a large bomb still on board rather than bail out and risk it crashing into the village.\n\n\nDuring the war, Rattigan served in the Royal Air Force as a tail gunner, and used his wartime experiences to help inspire his earlier stage play, \"Flare Path\". In 1945, he was released from the service to help rewrite it with Anatole De Grunwald as a film screenplay of \"The Way to the Stars\". Although Michael Redgrave and John Mills were the leads, the film offers very early performances from two actors who would themselves become international film stars in later years: Jean Simmons and Trevor Howard. The real RAF Halfpenny Green airfield was located in Staffordshire and was used for training pilots, rather than being a bomber base. The airfield is now home to Wolverhampton Halfpenny Green Airport.\n\nThe following poetry, supposedly written by Archdale, was penned by John Pudney, as one of two poems written specifically for the film. It is found on a piece of paper and given by Penrose to Toddy after her husband's death. Later, she gives it to Hollis's friend to read after he is killed.\n\n\"For Johnny\"\n\nDo not despair ... for Johnny-head-in-air;\n\nHe sleeps as sound. ... as Johnny underground.\n\nFetch out no shroud ... for Johnny-in-the-cloud;\n\nAnd keep your tears ... for him in after years.\n\nBetter by far ... for Johnny-the-bright-star,\n\nTo keep your head ... and see his children fed.\n\nOn initial release, the film was popular in Britain, but performed poorly in the U.S. where it was released post-war as \"Johnny in the Clouds\" with a prologue added.\n\nAccording to \"Kinematograph Weekly\" the film performed well at the British box office in 1945.\n\nLater reviews considered the film \"... one of the more thoughtful of British war movies ...\" and an \"excellent drama about a British airfield and the men stationed there, focusing mainly on personal relationships in wartime.\"\n\n"}

The Cypress urban cluster ranks 50th in the top 100 highest-income urban areas in the United States.\n\nLarge scale residential and commercial development beginning in the 1980s transformed the once rural area into one of the Houston area's largest suburban communities.\n\nThe recent find of a San Patrice projectile point at the Dimond Knoll site nearby on Cypress Creek attests to a human presence in the area by 7500 BC. By the early historic era, the area around present-day Cypress was populated by Atakapa and Akokisa Indian tribes, but they soon disappeared after the appearance of German settlers in the 1840s;\n\nThe German heritage is most notably reflected in the names of some of the major thoroughfares of the area, such as Huffmeister and Telge Roads. General Sam Houston and his Texas Army camped in the area on March 22, 1836 on the way to Harrisburg, which is now in East Houston, just days before the Battle of San Jacinto.\n\nThe area remained mostly rural until the early 1990s when developers began construction of several master-planned communities. The area is often referred to as Cy-Fair or Cypress-Fairbanks, which comes from when the Big Cypress School and Fairbanks High School combined in the 1930s to form Cy-Fair High School and the Cypress-Fairbanks Independent School District. In March 2008, the Cypress Historical Society (CHS) was formed as a non-profit corporation with its primary mission being \"...to discover, educate, promote, collect, preserve and make available to the public, historical documents and artifacts of the Cypress area\". The CHS organization holds regular events aimed at exposing Cypress' residents to the historical and cultural foundation upon which the area was built.\n\nCypress is located near the intersection of US Highway 290 and Spring-Cypress Road. Cypress is located within the Cypress Creek and Little Cypress Creek watershed. There are no official boundary lines for the exact area, but roads commonly mentioned to bound the area include FM 529 road as the southern border, HWY 6 and FM 1960 as the eastern border, and HWY 249 as the northern border.\n\nCypress has two distinct geographic profiles separated by Highway 290. The area northeast of US 290 is forested and thickly wooded, while the area southwest of 290 is predominately ranch land and grassy prairie dotted with scrub brush, Live oaks and Post oaks.\n\nCypress falls under the jurisdiction of Harris County Precincts 3 and 4 (separated by Cypress Creek).\n\nMajor arteries include Highway 290 to the South and State Highway 249 to the east.\n\nThe climate in this area is characterized by hot, humid summers and generally mild to cool winters.

That first prototype, the 1929 Flying Wing X-216H, evolved from earlier design studies. The X-216H had twin rudders with a single horizontal stabilizer running between them; both rudders were connected by twin booms to the thick, all-wing blended fuselage. The aircraft had an open cockpit in the center wing section and single, rear-facing, pusher propeller connected to a piston engine blended into the all-wing shape. The X-216H was first test flown in 1929 with Edward Bellande at the controls; the aircraft displayed adequate performance and was noted for its unique all-metal stressed skin and multi-cellular construction. At about this same time, Jack Northrop became aware of Walter and Reimar Horten's prewar record-setting \"tailless\" flying wing glider designs being tested in Germany beginning in 1934.\n\nThe N-1M was one of a progression of experimental aircraft that further developed Northrop's all-wing concept. The aircraft was produced in the United States and was developed during 1939 and 1940 as a flying testbed for the purpose of proving Jack Northrop's vision of a practical Flying Wing. Built mostly of specially laminated layers of glued wood, the design of both wooden wings allowed for easy configuration changes with the central blended fuselage, which was made of tubular steel. The aircraft first flew on 3 July 1941 at Baker Dry Lake in California.\n\nNorthrop's Chief Test Pilot Vance Breese flew the N-1M on its maiden flight, unexpectedly bouncing into the air during a planned high-speed taxi run. He reported that the aircraft could fly no higher than five feet. Flight could only be sustained by maintaining a precise angle of attack, but Theodore von Kármán solved the problem by making adjustments to the trailing edges of the elevons. Control of the aircraft was achieved through the use of a system of elevons and wingtip rudders. The elevons served in tailless type aircraft both as elevators and ailerons, while split flaps on the downward angled wingtips took the place of a conventional rudder; they were later straightened after that angle proved unnecessary during flight testing.\n\nThe flight test program continued with Moye W. Stephens, Northrop Test Pilot and Secretary to the Northrop Corporation, serving as a test pilot. Early tests showed the N-1M to be satisfactory in stability and control, but overweight and underpowered. The aircraft's two Lycoming O-145 four-cylinder engines (buried in the wing to reduce drag) were replaced by two six-cylinder 6AC264F2 air-cooled Franklin engines. By November 1941, after 28 flights, Stephens reported that when attempting to move the N-1M about its vertical axis, the aircraft had a tendency to \"Dutch roll.\" The oscillations proved to be manageable when adjustments were made to the aircraft's wing configuration.\n\nThe N-1M proved to be basically sound, paving the way for Northrop's later and much larger Northrop YB-35 and YB-49 aircraft. The aircraft was donated to the United States Army Air Forces in 1945 and was placed in the storage collection of the National Air Museum the following year. It sat there for nearly three decades, but was brought back to static, non-flying status, in its final flight configuration, after several years of restoration during the 1980s. The N-1M is now on public display at the National Air and Space Museum's Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center.\n\n"}

The studio focused largely on creating new intellectual property rather than sequels. When these failed to perform on par with Capcom's more popular series, Capcom attempted to merge the studio back into their internal R&D. Those at the studio chose instead to leave the company, and Clover was dissolved.\n\nSome of the key members of Clover founded Seeds Inc., a new development group that merged with ODD Incorporated in October 2007 to form PlatinumGames, which has since built up a staff composed of former Clover staff. Other members (including the art director of \"Ōkami\") went to join UTV Ignition Games at their Tokyo development studio, which developed the game \"\". On 28 October 2010, one of the most prominent members of Clover Studio and then PlatinumGames, Shinji Mikami, joined ZeniMax Media in a deal where ZeniMax acquired his new development studio Tango Gameworks.\n\nTo facilitate \"Viewtiful Joe 2\"s development, Capcom turned \"Team Viewtiful\" into Clover Studio, a semi-autonomous production company with a focus on developing new intellectual properties (IPs). The separation was also in part due to \"Resident Evil 4\"s PlayStation 2 release, which caused significant tensions between Capcom and Mikami, who had touted the game's console exclusivity. Clover Studio was able to produce two more games in the \"Viewtiful Joe\" series, which serve as side-stories, and commissioned an anime adaptation which was handled by Group TAC. Clover's next big project was \"Ōkami\", a \"brand-focused project\" fitting with Capcom's goal for Clover to develop new IPs. Although it was a critical success, it failed to live up to Capcom's sales expectations; Clover's next project \"God Hand\" did even worse. Compounding this problem, Clover's developers still felt stifled under the weight of Capcom's corporate management, who were reluctant or actively opposed to risky new ideas.\n\nCapcom shut down Clover Studio in late 2006, after Atsushi Inaba, Hideki Kamiya and Shinji Mikami left the company.\n\nThese resignations were part of a series of high-profile departures from Capcom, including Yoshiki Okamoto in 2003 and Keiji Inafune in 2010. Inafune complained of similar problems, as Inaba, Kamiya and Mikami, namely that Capcom management had a rule dictating that at least 70-80 percent of all new projects must be sequels of existing properties, with the actual number very close to 100 percent at any time.\n\nThey would go on to found PlatinumGames with members of their old studio. In 2008, they announced the \"Platinum Three\", referring to \"MadWorld\", \"Infinite Space\", and \"Bayonetta\", which would attempt to carry on the Capcom Five's ambitious and creative original spirit.\n\nIn 2009, Capcom producer and Senior Corporate Officer of R&D Keiji Inafune, told 1up.com that the company had no interest at the time to produce sequels to Clover titles.\n\nIn 2010, Capcom released a sequel to \"Ōkami\" titled, \"Ōkamiden\" for the Nintendo DS.\n\nCharacters from \"Viewtiful Joe\" and \"Ōkami\" have appeared in other Capcom media. Viewtiful Joe and Yami, the final boss of \"Ōkami\", appear in the Wii version of the 2008 crossover fighting game, \"\". Viewtiful Joe and Amaterasu, the protagonist of \"Ōkami\", both appear as playable characters in the 2011 fighting game \"\" and \"Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3\".\n\nA high-definition port of \"Ōkami\", remastered by Capcom and HexaDrive, was released on the PlayStation 3 via the PlayStation Network in October 2012 and for retail in Japan in November 2012. The high-definition port was also released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in December 2017 worldwide, with a Nintendo Switch version released in August 2018.\n\n\n"}

In football, he was a two-way player at running back and cornerback. As a senior, he contributed to the team having a 12-1 record, along with teammate Tommie Frazier at quarterback.\n\nHe accepted a football scholarship from the University of Nebraska.

The third installment in Hammer's \"Frankenstein\" series, it stars Peter Cushing and Kiwi Kingston.\n\nA child witnesses an intruder steal the corpse of one of her recently dead relatives. Terrified, the child flees from the cabin where she is hiding, and encounters Baron Victor Frankenstein.\n\nThe body snatcher takes the corpse to Frankenstein's secret laboratory. Meanwhile, a local priest discovers the theft. The child who witnessed the theft identifies both the body snatcher and his employer. Forced to leave town, Frankenstein and his assistant, Hans, return to the Baron's hometown of Karlstaad, where they plan to sell valuables from the abandoned Frankenstein chateau to fund new work. Arriving in the village, they rescue a deaf-mute young woman from being harassed by a gang of thugs. Arriving at the chateau, they find all the valuables stolen.\n\nThe following day, Frankenstein and Hans go out for a meal, and Frankenstein notices the local Burgomeister is wearing one of his valuables; a ring. Frankenstein and Hans are recognised by the authorities, and they flee, eventually hiding at the hypnotist, Zoltan's, exhibit. Zoltan clashes with the police and is arrested, covering the escape of Frankenstein and Hans.\n\nLater that evening, Frankenstein and Hans breaks into the Burgomeister's apartments to get the valuables back, but the police arrive. Frankenstein and Hans flee and encounter the deaf-mute girl. She leads them to her shelter in a cave.\n\nFrankenstein finds his original creation frozen in the cave. He and Hans build a fire to melt the ice and free the creature. They take it to the chateau and restore it to life. However, the creature's brain is unresponsive. Frankenstein, desperate to restore active consciousness to his creation, comes up with the idea of obtaining the services of Zoltan to reanimate the creature's mind. Zoltan has been banished from Karlstaad for not having a license to perform. After clever psychological manipulation by the Baron, he agrees to the task.\n\nZoltan is successful, but has less than scientific interests at heart. With the creature responding only to his commands, Zoltan uses it to rob and take revenge upon the town's authorities. Frankenstein evicts Zoltan, who then instructs the creature to kill Frankenstein, but the creature kills Zoltan instead. The creature goes into a fit of rage and accidentally sets fire to the lab, trapping itself and Frankenstein. Hans attempts to save Frankesntein, but Frankenstein orders him and the girl to flee and save themselves. Hans and the girl escape, and watch helplessly as the burning chateau blows up, killing Frankenstein and the creature.\n\n\nThe script for the film by Anthony Hinds was based on a story synopsis that Peter Bryan submitted in May 1958 for the aborted \"Tales of Frankenstein\" television series. The film breaks continuity from the preceding film, \"The Revenge of Frankenstein\". Denis Meikle described the break: \"Any pretext of a connection to \"The Revenge of Frankenstein\" is dispensed with in a brazen display of contempt for continuity. A flashback creates a prior history that is wholly unrelated to the last Sangster script and is instead plundered from Universal's \"Frankenstein Meets the Wolfman\".\"\n\nThe film was in production from October 14 to November 16, 1963 at Bray Studios in Windsor, Berkshire and on location at Black Park Country Park in Wexham, Buckinghsamshire. The film was made during Hammer's six-year co-production pact with Columbia Pictures. This led to the company to make a few production a year with Universal Pictures, with \"The Evil of Frankenstein\" being the only film that Hammer made that was financed by Universal in 1963. The film's version of the Monster is noted for resembling the one in Universal Pictures' original \"Frankenstein\" series of the 1930s and 1940s, including the distinctive laboratory sets as well as the flat-headed look of Jack Pierce's monster make-up which had been designed for Boris Karloff. Earlier Frankenstein films by Hammer had studiously avoided such similarities for copyright reasons. However, a new film distribution deal had been made between Hammer and Universal. As a result, Hammer had free rein to duplicate make-up and set elements.\n\nAdditional scenes for American television were filmed on January 14, 1966 at Universal Studios in Los Angeles.\n\n\"The Evil of Frankenstein\" had its premiere in London on April 19, 1964 at the New Victoria Theatre. It received a general release in the country in May 31, 1964. It later received a release in the United States by Universal Pictures on May 8, 1964. The film was shown with a 97 minute running time on NBC in the United States on their \"NBC Saturday Night at the Movies\" block on January 2, 1968.\n\nFrom contemporary reviews, Howard Thompson of \"The New York Times\" wrote, \"For the first half, the latest Frankenstein go-round has a succinct pull and a curious dignity ... the picture begins to say something about superstition and hypocrisy. Then it simply goes hog-wild (monster gets drunk) and heads for the ash heap.\" \"Variety\" gave the film a lukewarm review, writing that the direction was \"deft enough over the more preposterous patches\" and that there was \"always something going on,\" but that the dialogue sometimes provoked unintended laughter and that some of the supporting cast \"tend to ham it up to the make-believe's detriment.\" \"The Monthly Film Bulletin\" wrote that the monster made \"a welcome return to tradition in a close approximation of Boris Karloff's celebrated make-up\" and that the Baron's lab equipment was \"as photogenic as ever,\" but that the film was \"sadly tatty\" in all other respects, concluding: \"Saddled with an uninspiring cast, and a Bavarian village so stagy that the villagers rhubarbing away into their Olde German beermugs seem almost real by comparison, Freddie Francis finds the going too uphill by half.\"\n\nFrom retrospective reviews, AllMovie's review of the film was mixed to negative, calling it \"dismal\" and \"the worst of Hammer Films' Frankenstein series\". The film has an average 50% on Rotten Tomatoes.\n\n\n\n"}

It has a reputation as a liberal and artistic school using some ideas of the Dalton Plan.\n\nBryanston was founded in 1928 by a young schoolmaster from Australia named J. G. Jeffreys. Armed only with his confidence and enthusiasm, he gained financial support for the school during a period of severe economic instability with financial backing from Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 9th Earl of Shaftesbury, he paid £35,000 for the Bryanston House and its of immediate grounds.\n\nThe school occupies a palatial country house designed and built in 1889–1894 by Richard Norman Shaw and modelled on the chateau at Menars in the Loire valley. Shaw designed the house for Viscount Portman to replace an earlier one. The building and estate was the biggest in Dorset and the last of the grand stately homes to be built in England. The home had been occupied by the Portman family for 30 years at the time of its sale, however, death duties made it impossible for the 4th Lord Portman to hold on to his family estate.\n\nThere were just seven teachers and 23 boys of various ages in the first term. Jeffreys innovated whilst respecting good traditions, reflected in his choice of school motto, \"Et Nova Et Vetera.\" His was the first English school to adopt the Dalton Plan, its combination of the new and the old being of particular appeal. The system was flexible enough to offer a combination of lessons in the classroom and time for assignment work in subject rooms, which gave the students freedom to decide which pieces of academic work to focus their attention. Students are required to keep a daily record on a chart showing their use of working and leisure time, meeting with their tutors on a weekly basis to ensure effective monitoring of their progress.\n\nThe school opened on 24 January 1928 with 23 pupils and seven members of staff.

Wilanów Palace survived Poland's partitions and both World Wars, and so serves as a reminder of the culture of the Polish state as it was before the misfortunes of the 18th century.\n\nIt is one of Poland's most important monuments. The Palace's museum, established in 1805, is a repository of the country's royal and artistic heritage and receives around 3 million visitors annually. The palace and park in Wilanów hosts cultural events and concerts, including Summer Royal Concerts in the Rose Garden and the International Summer Early Music Academy.\n\nThe palace, together with other elements of Warsaw Old Town, is one of Poland's official national Historic Monuments (\"Pomnik historii\"), as designated on 16th September 1994. Its listing is maintained by the National Heritage Board of Poland.\n\nSince 2006, the palace has been a member of the international association of European Royal Residences.\n\nWilanów Palace was built for king John III Sobieski in the last quarter of the 17th century and later was enlarged by other owners. It represents the characteristic type of baroque suburban residence built \"entre cour et jardin\" (between the entrance court and the garden). Its architecture is original, a merger of generally European art with distinctively Polish building traditions. Upon its elevations and in the palace interiors ancient symbols glorify the Sobieski family, especially the military triumphs of the king.\n\nAfter the death of John III Sobieski in 1696, the palace was owned by his sons and later by the famous magnate families Sieniawskis, Czartoryskis, Lubomirskis, Potockis and Branicki family of the Korczak coat of arms. In 1720, the property was purchased by Polish stateswoman Elżbieta Sieniawska who enlarged the palace. Between 1730 and 1733 it was a residence of Augustus II the Strong, also a king of Poland (the palace was exchanged with him for the Blue Palace at Senatorska Street), and after his death the property came to Sieniawska's daughter Maria Zofia Czartoryska. Every owner changed the interiors of the palace, as well as the gardens and grounds, according to the current fashion and needs. In 1778 the estate was inherited by Izabela Lubomirska, called \"The Blue Marquise\". She refurbished some of the interiors in the neoclassical style between 1792–1793 and build a \"corps de garde\", a kitchen building and a bathroom building under the supervision of Szymon Bogumił Zug.\n\nIn the year 1805, the owner Stanisław Kostka Potocki, opened a museum in a part of the palace, one of the first public museums in Poland. A most notable example of the collections is Potocki's equestrian portrait made by renowned neoclassical French artist Jacques-Louis David in 1781. Besides European and Oriental art, the central part of the palace displayed a commemoration of king John III Sobieski and the glorious national past. The palace was damaged by German forces in World War II, but it was not demolished after the 1944 Warsaw Uprising. After the war, the palace was renovated, and most of the collection stolen by Germany was repatriated. In 1962 it was reopened to the public.\n\nThe structure was designed by Augustyn Wincenty Locci. The architecture of the palace is a unique example of different building traditions - reminiscent of Polish aristocratic mansions with side towers, the Italian suburban villa and French palaces \"entre cour et jardin\" with two oblong wings on each side of the \"cour d'honneur\".\nDuring the first stage of construction, between 1677 and 1680 it was a typical Polish manor house with four alcove towers attached to the one-storeyed square building. Between 1681-1688, the building was enhanced and two gallery wings ending with towers were added. This new appearance was probably inspired by Palladio's Villa Montagnana. Shortly after the king's death the third stage of the reconstruction was accomplished. Between 1688-1696 the pavilion above the main building was erected and the towers were covered with baroque spires, all resembling the Villa Doria Pamphili in Rome (especially its initial design by Giovanni Francesco Grimaldi).\n\nThe king and his librarian Adam Adamandy Kochański took active part in the design and construction of the palace. The latter was responsible for the ideological and artistic programme, where motives and decoration elements played an essential role in glorifying the monarch, his wife and the Republic - busts of king and queen among the effigies of ancient characters, gods and goddesses, Roman emperors and empresses (such as the Dioscuri, Zeus-Amun, Sibyl, Romulus, Rhea Silvia, Alexander the Great, Cleopatra, Dido and Vespasian among others), Eagle and Pogonia, personifications of the Commonwealth regions (Masovia and Greater Poland, Samogitia, Red Ruthenia and Royal Prussia). They were issued by sculptors Andreas Schlüter (many reliefs and other secondary aspects of the façade), Stefan Szwaner and a stucco decorator named Antoni of Wilanów. Some of the sculptures were made in the Low Countries by Louis Willemsens and Artus Quellinus the Elder' workshop, shipped to Gdańsk and then transported to Warsaw. An ornate sundial on the south wall with Chronos, together with the opposite composition with Uranus on the north wall, were intended to underline the king's patronage of science and orderliness in the \"Serenissima\" during his reign. They were executed by Antoni of Wilanów, according to the design by Johannes Hevelius (astronomical aspect), Adam Adamandy Kochański (mathematical aspect) and Augustyn Locci (artistic aspect).\n\nThe side wings embracing a courtyard, initiated by the king, were built long after his death by Elżbieta Sieniawska. They were constructed in the fourth stage of the enlargement between 1720-1729. Powerful Sieniawska was very concerned in maintaining the substantial historical residence of the \"Rex victoriossimus\" (Victorious King), as it was called. Despite that she transformed the palace into a French style \"palais enchanté\" according to design by Giovanni Spazzio, with two new wings harmonious with the 17th century \"corps de logis\". She employed the most renowned architects and artists for this undertaking, such as previously mentioned Spazzio, Johann Sigmund Deybel, Józef Fontana, Jan Jerzy Plersch and Giovanni Rossi. While the original royal palace was decorated with reliefs depicting the deeds of John III, the new wings were adorned with battlefield achievements of Sieniawska's husband and father-in-law - Adam Mikołaj and Mikołaj Hieronim Sieniawski (\"nota bene\" Sobieski's comrades).\n\nThe most prominent Polish and foreign artists participated in the decoration of the palace interiors. It was entrusted to painters Martino Altomonte, Jan Rayzner of Lviv, Michelangelo Palloni, sculptor Stefan Szwaner and stucco decorators Szymon Józef Bellotti, Antoni of Wilanów and Abraham Paris. They were supervised by the official court painters Claude Callot and later by Jerzy Siemiginowski-Eleuter. The latter, one of the greatest Polish painters of that time, had a significant influence on the palace's subsequent internal aspects (plafonds in the state rooms, frescoes). Internal decoration was also superintended by Adam Kochański, a great admirer of China, who supported closer economic relations of the Commonwealth with the \"Central nation\". Due to his influence, Wilanów and other residencies were full of luxury Chinese imports and chinoiserie.\n\nThe 17th-century palace inventories included the works of the greatest contemporary and ancient masters, like Rembrandt (\"Portuguese rabbi\", \"Jewish Girl in a beret\", \"The Adoration of the Magi\", \"Abraham and Hagar\", \"Portrait of an old man\" in the so-called \"Dutch Room\" of the palace), Pieter van Laer, called \"Bamboccio\" (\"Travellers\"), Anthony van Dyck (\"Christ in the Garden of Gethsemane\"), Ferdinand van Kessel (batalistic scenes, allegorical paintings and still lifes), Raphael, Caracci brothers, Guido Reni and Bernardo Strozzi. The chambers were filled with precious furnishings, like silver folding screen, silver pyramid with 11 baskets, a three-storeyed silver fountain or a silk baldachin presented by the Shah of Persia. Unfortunately they were scattered by the successive proprietors, appropriated by Friedrich August of Saxony and transported to Dresden or looted by the Germans during World War II (e.g. John III's tortoise-shell cabinet, never retrieved).\n\nAmong the artists appointed for decoration of the palace's interiors in the 18th century were Giuseppe Rossi, an Italian fresco painter, who adorned the chambers with \"trompe-l'œil\" paintings and stucco decorators Francesco Fumo and Pietro Innocente Comparetti. Following the example of Queen Marie Casimire, who ordered a painting of herself as a goddess on the palace plafonds, Elżbieta Sieniawska embellished the Lower Vestibule with a fresco of Flora. On her initiative the walls in the royal chambers were covered with Genoan velvet. The walls of the second floor, that is the \"Great Dining Room\", were covered with frescoes depicting Apollo, Minerva and Hercules as an allegory of \"Virtus Heroica\" (Heroic Valor), Hebe symbolizing \"Venustas\" (Beauty) completed with panoplies. Sieniawska's daughter, Maria Zofia Czartoryska, furnished the palace with new fireplaces made of white-cherry marble and crowned with mirrors in rich rococo frames.\n\nIn the contract with King Augustus II Maria Zofia obliged him to preserve the palace unchanged. Therefore, his actions were limited to finishing the new dining room, called the \"White Room\" in the southern wing and to the decoration of some unfinished interiors. The plafonds and other paintings were executed by Julien Poison, Johann Samuel Mock and Lorenzo Rossi, while the decorative lacquer panneaux in the \"Chinese Room\" were made by Martin Schnell.\n\nAn integral part of the palace, almost since its beginning, is the garden. Initially it had the character of a baroque \"Italian garden\" in a semicircular form surrounding the palace on the east. In its composition this geometric garden fitted in well with the ancient patterns and the palace arrangement. It consisted of an upper garden located on a terrace with two arbours in the form of lanterns in each corner, and lower garden. During the third stage of the reconstruction of the palace the geometric garden parterres were replaced with \"embroidered\" parterres \"à la française\" inspired by André Le Nôtre's treaties. At that time the garden was embellished with gilded lead sculptures by Gaspar Richter of Gdańsk and vases carved in cherry marble from Chęciny. In the beginning of the 18th century the garden was enlarged, the late baroque parterre ornamentation was replaced with régence motives completed with Sieniawska's coat of arms \"Szreniawa\" in the northern parts and her monogram in the southern part. In 1784 Izabela Lubomirska transformed neighbouring territories of Wilanów folwark into a \"jardin anglo-chinois\" according to Szymon Bogumił Zug's design. This new garden with rich vegetation, sinuous paths and cascades was inspired by works of William Chambers, Thomas Whately and August Moszyński.\n\n\n"}

The building was opened in 1932 on the site of the Hotel Cecil and stands behind the original facade of the hotel, between the Adelphi building and the Savoy Hotel. Broadly Art Deco in style, it was designed by Frances Milton Cashmore of the architectural firm of Messrs Joseph.\n\nStanding 58 m (190 ft) tall, with of floor space, Shell Mex House has 12 floors (plus basement and sub-basement) and is immediately recognizable from the River Thames and the South Bank by the clock positioned on the south side of the building (flanked by two large, hieratic figures at the south corners in marble by the sculptor William Charles Holland King). The clock, which was known for a time as \"Big Benzene\", has the biggest clock face in the UK, at 7.62 metres in diameter, just 0.02 metres more than the clocks on the Liver Building in Liverpool; it was supplied by Gillett & Johnston of Croydon. The building faces the river and the Strand. It was described by architectural historian Nikolaus Pevsner as \"thoroughly unsubtle, but...hold[s] its own in London's river front.\"\n\nThe building was for many years the London headquarters of Shell-Mex and BP, for which it was originally built. Shell-Mex and BP was a joint venture company created by Shell and British Petroleum in 1932, when they decided to merge their United Kingdom marketing operations. Upon the UK marketing separation of Shell and BP in 1976, Shell Mex House became the head office of Shell UK, which was Shell's UK operating company. Changes in the way that Shell was run in the 1990s led to the disposal of the property by Shell. Today, simply known as 80 Strand, most of its floors are occupied by companies belonging to Pearson plc.\nThe entrance of the building, which is set back from the Strand, is through a large gated archway. A green plaque was affixed to the wall just inside the gate in March 2008, proclaiming: \"The Royal Air Force was formed and had its first headquarters here in the former Hotel Cecil 1st April 1918\". Below it is a brass plate stating: \"This plaque was unveiled by the Chief of the Air Staff Air Chief Marshal Sir Glenn Torpy KCB CBE DSO ADC to mark the 90th anniversary of the formation of the Royal Air Force\".\n\nDuring World War II, the building became home to the Ministry of Supply, which co-ordinated the supply of equipment to the national armed forces. It was also the home of the \"Petroleum Board\", which handled the distribution and rationing of petroleum products during the war. It was badly damaged by a bomb in 1940.\n\nThe building reverted to Shell-Mex and BP on 1 July 1948, with a number of floors remaining occupied by the Ministry of Aviation (latterly the Board of Trade, Civil Aviation Division) until the mid-1970s. During this time, until the department's move to the present location in Farnborough, the building was also the headquarters for the Air Accidents Investigation Branch.\n\nOn 17 May 2006, \"The Times\" reported\nthat the building was for sale and that the Indian-Kenyan Kandhari family was the front-runner in the battle to buy it from the existing owners, Vincent and Robert Tchenguiz. The Kandharis were said to have offered £530 million for the building, but they were competing with other interested groups, including Menorah, the Israeli insurer, an Irish company, and several British companies. An offer believed to be for £520 million ($1.02 billion) was made in December 2006 by Istithmar, the investment agency of the Dubai government, which withdrew its offer before completion. The property was subsequently sold in July 2007 to a fund managed by Westbrook Partners.\n\nIn the final scene of the 2016 feature film \"Assassin's Creed\", directed by Justin Kurzel, the hero Callum Lynch and two other surviving assassins stand astride Shell Mex House and survey London.\n\n\n"}

He has also played for the St. Louis Rams, Philadelphia Eagles and Tennessee Titans.\n\nWitherspoon's father served in the US Air Force, and so Witherspoon moved around as a child. However, his family never lived on the military bases, instead deciding to live in the community so the children could experience the culture. In addition to speaking English, he knows how to speak German, and is learning both Arabic and Swedish. He attended Good Shepherd Lutheran School in middle school. He played running back for Rutherford High School in Panama City, Florida, but switched to linebacker before his senior year. He was chosen as the USA Today Florida Player of the Year for his efforts as a senior, where he posted 112 tackles, 3 sacks, and three interceptions.\n\nWitherspoon and his wife, Rebecca have 3 daughters.\n\nHe played college football at the University of Georgia, where he was a starter for three years. After playing every game as a true freshman, he started most of the Bulldogs' games for the remainder of his time at Georgia, switching between the middle, strong-side, and weak-side linebacker positions. He graduated with 211 tackles, 3.5 sacks, one forced fumble, and one fumble recovery. He was a landscape architecture major.\n\nWitherspoon was drafted by the Carolina Panthers in the third round (73rd overall) of the 2002 NFL Draft. He was the latest addition to new coach John Fox's overhaul of the defense, and Witherspoon's versatility at linebacker helped the Panthers total the second-best defense in the league. He replaced Dan Morgan at middle linebacker halfway through the season after Morgan went down with injury. He finished the season with 71 tackles and 1.5 sacks, his first half sack coming at the Cleveland Browns on December 1. During the 2003 NFL season, Witherspoon was the only Panther linebacker to start every game, where he once again filled in for an injured Morgan at middle linebacker.\n\nHe intercepted his first pass off New Orleans Saints quarterback Aaron Brooks. During Super Bowl XXXVIII, Witherspoon posted a career-high 16 tackles. He ended the campaign with a total of 99 tackles, one sack and one interception. The following year, \"Spoon\" was one of the few defensive players to start every game for the Panthers, who were wracked with injuries. Despite the loss of key personnel like defensive tackle Kris Jenkins, the Panthers led the league in interceptions. Witherspoon set personal bests with three sacks and four interceptions and a then career-high of 103 tackles. In 2005, his final year with the Panthers, Witherspoon played in 15 games and finished the season 81 tackles, 2.5 sacks and two interceptions.\nOn March 12, 2006, as an unrestricted free agent, he signed a six-year, $33 million contract (including $15 million guaranteed) with the St. Louis Rams In his first season (2006) with the Rams, he played in all 16 games and recorded a career-high 113 tackles and three sacks. In 2007, he recorded 110 tackles and a career-high seven sacks and was named Team MVP for 2007.\n\nOn October 20, 2009 Witherspoon was traded from the Rams to the Philadelphia Eagles in exchange for wide receiver Brandon Gibson and a fifth round draft pick in 2010. In his first game as an Eagle against the Washington Redskins on October 26, 2009, he recorded six tackles, an interception (returned for a touchdown), sack, and a forced fumble. During the season, he played in 17 games, becoming the fifth player since bye weeks were reintroduced in 1990 to do so, as he was traded prior to St. Louis's bye week to the Eagles after the Eagles bye week.\n\nHe was released on March 5, 2010.\nWitherspoon was signed by the Tennessee Titans on March 9, 2010.

The use of brass bands and choral arrangements in his music, to create a nostalgic and romantic feel, became a trademark. He enjoyed two UK top twenty hits in the 1970s. In October 2016, he was ordained as a deacon and priest of the Church of England, but died only four months later.\n\nPeter Skellern was born in Bury, Lancashire, to Margaret (née Spencer) and John Skellern. He attended Derby High School and studied piano at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama. He later joined the pop groups Harlem and March Hare.\n\nSkellern's first song to become a hit was \"You're a Lady\" in 1972. The record featured the Congregation, who had previously recorded the top ten hit \"Softly Whispering I Love You\". \"You're a Lady\" reached number three on the UK Singles Chart and number 50 in the United States \"Billboard\" Hot 100. Success for Skellern followed three years later with \"Hold On to Love\" which reached number 14 on the UK chart. He also sang the theme song to the London Weekend Television series \"Billy Liar\" (1973). For three years in the 1970s he worked on BBC Radio 4's \"Stop the Week\". A non-charting song, \"Too Much I'm in Love\", received radio play.\n\nIn 1978 Skellern had a minor hit with the 1930s Ray Noble song \"Love Is the Sweetest Thing\" (which featured backing by the Grimethorpe Colliery Band), winning the Music Trades Association award for best middle of the road song. This followed his departure from Island Records after his previous album, \"Hard Times\", had failed to chart despite a guest appearance by George Harrison.\n\nIn 1981 he wrote, composed and performed in a series of musical playlets for the BBC called \"Happy Endings\". Two years later he hosted the \"Private Lives\" television chat show. He wrote the lyrics for the song \"One More Kiss, Dear\" from the film \"Blade Runner\" (1982).\n\nIn 1984, Skellern performed the theme song for the London Weekend Television programme \"Me and My Girl\". In the same year, he formed a group called Oasis with cellist Julian Lloyd Webber and Mary Hopkin. The group released a self-titled album in 1984 on the Warner Bros. Records label which earned a silver record. The group performed live on television, but a planned concert tour was cancelled when Mary Hopkin became ill.\n\nIn 1987, Skellern wrote and performed the theme music and song for the Yorkshire Television series \"Flying Lady\".\n\nSkellern provided the voice of Carter Brandon in the BBC Radio adaptations of Peter Tinniswood's \"Uncle Mort's North Country\". The show was produced by Pete Atkin.\n\nSkellern collaborated with Richard Stilgoe in cabaret and in musical comedy with comic songs such as \"Joyce the Librarian\". They released three live albums; \"A Quiet Night Out\", \"By the Wey\" and \"Who Plays Wins\".\n\nToward the end of his career Skellern wrote pieces of sacred choral music, including \"Waiting for the Word\" (which was written for the BBC's \"Songs of Praise\" programme of 19 August 2001), \"Six Simple Carols\" and \"The Nativity Cantata\" written for a Hemel Hempstead choir, the Aeolian Singers. The work was first performed by them in 2004 and was later recorded.\n\nIn October 2016, it was revealed that Skellern had developed an inoperable brain tumour and that he had fulfilled a lifelong calling to be ordained in the Church of England. Under a special faculty from the Archbishop of Canterbury, he was ordained both as a deacon and priest on 16 October 2016 by the Bishop of Truro.\n\nSkellern died as a result of the brain tumour in February 2017 at the age of 69, at Lanteglos-by-Fowey, Cornwall. He was survived by his wife Diana, two children and five grandchildren.\n\nIn 1972, the same year that \"You're a Lady\" was released, the song was covered in France by folk singer Hugues Aufray under the title \"Vous ma lady\", followed later in the year by Brigitte Bardot with Laurent Vergez in a duet version released on 3 January 1973. Davy Jones from the Monkees also recorded a version. It has been extensively covered since, by artists such as Johnny Mathis on his 1973 album \"Me and Mrs. Jones\" and Telly Savalas on his 1974 album \"Telly\".\n\nSkellern's other songs have been also recorded by a number of other singers, such as Andy Williams who included \"Make It Easy for Me\" on his 1973 album \"Solitaire\" and \"My Lonely Room\" on his 1975 album \"Andy\". Ringo Starr recorded Skellern's \"Hard Times\" on his 1978 album \"Bad Boy\".\n\nIn her 1985 eponymous BBC television comedy series, Victoria Wood performed an affectionate parody of Skellern's style in a song entitled \"Northern Boy\", accompanied by a brass band and choir.\n\nOn 17 April 2017, Tim Rice introduced an hour-long tribute for Skellern on BBC Radio 2.\n\n\n\n"}

Hsu in India, was a Chinese scholar and translator, indologist and philosopher. He translated 50 of the \"Upanishads\" into classical Chinese. He also translated Nietzsche's \"Also sprach Zarathustra\", Kalidasa's lyric poem \"Meghaduuta\" (\"Cloud Messenger\"), and several of Sri Aurobindo's works into Chinese. He was familiar with Greek, Latin, English, French, as well as Sanskrit and German. A 16-volume edition of his complete works was published in 2006.\n\nHe was born into a wealthy family in Changsha, Hunan. His name was \"Hu\"() by birth. Fancheng is his Pen name. The childhood of Xu was marked by a complete study of Classical Chinese. He was taught by the student of the late Qing dynasty Confucian scholar Wang Kaiyun. He was a friend and student of Lu Xun in his early life. From 1927 to 1929, he studied History at Zhongshan University and then Western Literature in Fudan University. He studied Fine Art and Philosophy at the University of Königsberg, Germany from 1929 to 1932. From 1945 to 1978, he studied and taught in India, thus escaping the Cultural Revolution. He lived in Pondicherry from 1951 to 1978 in the Sri Aurobindo Ashram (where he was an inmate). After returning to China, he worked as a researcher in the Research Institute of World Religions of Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. He translated prolifically, and various Sanskrit classics were introduced by him.\n\nXu was an acquaintance of Lu Xun. His study in Königsberg was at first inspired by Lu's advice. Throughout his entire life, his academic achievement and his fame were not proportionate. Partly due to the fact that Xu did not have any student to succeed his study. Xu possessed the ability to translate Sanskrit texts into Classical Chinese while both languages are archaic and not commonly spoken by people in India and China.\n\nXu’s translations were little known in China in the past, but today there is a growing interest in his writings and through them in Sri Aurobindo’s philosophy and vision. In 2006 Xu's Collected Works were brought out by some of his students and colleagues and in 2009 the \"China Daily\" reported on his “unending search for spirituality”. In 2010 there was an exhibition in Auroville and Pondicherry to commemorate his centenary. Around the same time some Chinese nationals, inspired by his writings, came to visit the Ashram and Auroville. In 2017 Lao Zhaohui, the Chinese Ambassador to India and a former student of Xu Fancheng, came for a visit and was especially interested in seeing his 300 paintings. Later on in a speech he greatly appreciated Xu’s work and his merits, calling him one of the bridges between China and India. In 2018 there was an exhibition and symposium on Xu in Pondicherry, inaugurated by Lao Zhaohui. The Ambassador was accompanied by some prominent scholars, and various notable speakers addressed the audience.\n\n\n"}

Mountain Ash RFC is a member of the Welsh Rugby Union and is a feeder club for the Cardiff Blues.\n\nThe team was founded in 1875 at a meeting in the Mountain Ash Inn, but their first game in earnest was not until 1891, against Swansea at the Washery Field. Some of their early fixtures were against Llanelli, Cardiff and Newport. Mountain Ash provided their first Wales international in 1892, when Frank Mills was selected for the Home Nations Championship, though at the time he had left Mountain Ash and was then representing Cardiff. It only took another four years for Mountain Ash to claim their first full international to represent Wales while still playing for the club, when Fred Miller was chosen to face Ireland in the 1896 Home Nations Championship. They managed to beat the touring Canadian team in 1904, and in the same year, moved headquarters to the Cresselly Inn. Four years later, they moved to the Recreation Ground, and established their headquarters at the Glancynon Hotel, their current clubhouse.\n\nIn 1912, the team toured the south of France, and managed to beat Bayonne RFC and Pau, but the outbreak of the First World War made it difficult for the club to continue. The situation grew even worse during the Second World War, when there were no games played from 1939 to 1946. They survived through this period, however, often maintaining at least one player in the Welsh team. In 1953, the county council removed the grandstand and the perimeter fence from the Recreation Ground, which proved to be devastating for the club, as most first class clubs refused to play there.\n\nDuring the late 1959/60 season, Mountain Ash had an excellent season losing only four matches under the captaincy of Denis Bryant, who became the club President in the 1970s, and was also instrumental in the creation of the senior second team in the 1960/61 season. In 1963 the first clubhouse was opened by former Welsh international Judge Rowe Harding, which was followed by silverware in the 1964/65 season when they won the Mid District Championship.\nIn 1994-1995, the club moved to the Parc Duffryn Pennar Ground. In 2000-2001, as part of the club's 125-year celebrations, a game was played against Public School Wanderers.\n\nThere are two senior teams, a youth team and a junior section. There is a clubhouse in the town attended by an enthusiastic supporters club and committee. The home ground, Parc Duffryn Pennar has modern facilities, including floodlights and a well maintained playing surface. Many representative games have been played there, including schoolboy internationals. Tours such as one to Canada in 2005 and South Africa in 2007 are regular features.\n\nThe first senior team play in the Division One east of the Welsh League.

{"id": "2091393", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2091393", "title": "Fault tolerance", "text": "Fault tolerance\n\nFault tolerance is the property that enables a system to continue operating properly in the event of the failure of (or one or more faults within) some of its components. If its operating quality decreases at all, the decrease is proportional to the severity of the failure, as compared to a naively designed system, in which even a small failure can cause total breakdown. Fault tolerance is particularly sought after in high-availability or life-critical systems. The ability of maintaining functionality when portions of a system break down is referred to as graceful degradation.\n\nA fault-tolerant design enables a system to continue its intended operation, possibly at a reduced level, rather than failing completely, when some part of the system fails. The term is most commonly used to describe computer systems designed to continue more or less fully operational with, perhaps, a reduction in throughput or an increase in response time in the event of some partial failure. That is, the system as a whole is not stopped due to problems either in the hardware or the software. An example in another field is a motor vehicle designed so it will continue to be drivable if one of the tires is punctured, or a structure that is able to retain its integrity in the presence of damage due to causes such as fatigue, corrosion, manufacturing flaws, or impact.\n\nWithin the scope of an \"individual\" system, fault tolerance can be achieved by anticipating exceptional conditions and building the system to cope with them, and, in general, aiming for self-stabilization so that the system converges towards an error-free state. However, if the consequences of a system failure are catastrophic, or the cost of making it sufficiently reliable is very high, a better solution may be to use some form of duplication. In any case, if the consequence of a system failure is so catastrophic, the system must be able to use reversion to fall back to a safe mode. This is similar to roll-back recovery but can be a human action if humans are present in the loop.\n\nThe first known fault-tolerant computer was SAPO, built in 1951 in Czechoslovakia by Antonín Svoboda. Its basic design was magnetic drums connected via relays, with a voting method of memory error detection (triple modular redundancy). Several other machines were developed along this line, mostly for military use. Eventually, they separated into three distinct categories: machines that would last a long time without any maintenance, such as the ones used on NASA space probes and satellites; computers that were very dependable but required constant monitoring, such as those used to monitor and control nuclear power plants or supercollider experiments; and finally, computers with a high amount of runtime which would be under heavy use, such as many of the supercomputers used by insurance companies for their probability monitoring.\n\nMost of the development in the so-called LLNM (Long Life, No Maintenance) computing was done by NASA during the 1960s, in preparation for Project Apollo and other research aspects. NASA's first machine went into a space observatory, and their second attempt, the JSTAR computer, was used in Voyager. This computer had a backup of memory arrays to use memory recovery methods and thus it was called the JPL Self-Testing-And-Repairing computer. It could detect its own errors and fix them or bring up redundant modules as needed. The computer is still working today.\n\nHyper-dependable computers were pioneered mostly by aircraft manufacturers, nuclear power companies, and the railroad industry in the USA. These needed computers with massive amounts of uptime that would fail gracefully enough with a fault to allow continued operation while relying on the fact that the computer output would be constantly monitored by humans to detect faults. Again, IBM developed the first computer of this kind for NASA for guidance of Saturn V rockets, but later on BNSF, Unisys, and General Electric built their own.\n\nIn the 1970s, much work has happened in the field\n. For instance, F14 CADC had built-in self-test and redundancy.\n\nIn general, the early efforts at fault-tolerant designs were focused mainly on internal diagnosis, where a fault would indicate something was failing and a worker could replace it. SAPO, for instance, had a method by which faulty memory drums would emit a noise before failure. Later efforts showed that to be fully effective, the system had to be self-repairing and diagnosing – isolating a fault and then implementing a redundant backup while alerting a need for repair. This is known as N-model redundancy, where faults cause automatic fail-safes and a warning to the operator, and it is still the most common form of level one fault-tolerant design in use today.\n\nVoting was another initial method, as discussed above, with multiple redundant backups operating constantly and checking each other's results, with the outcome that if, for example, four components reported an answer of 5 and one component reported an answer of 6, the other four would \"vote\" that the fifth component was faulty and have it taken out of service. This is called M out of N majority voting.\n\nHistorically, the motion has always been to move further from N-model and more to M out of N due to the fact that the complexity of systems and the difficulty of ensuring the transitive state from fault-negative to fault-positive did not disrupt operations.\n\nTandem and Stratus were among the first companies specializing in the design of fault-tolerant computer systems for online transaction processing..\n\nA highly fault-tolerant system might continue at the same level of performance even though one or more components have failed. For example, a building with a backup electrical generator will provide the same voltage to wall outlets even if the grid power fails.\n\nA system that is designed to fail safe, or fail-secure, or fail gracefully, whether it functions at a reduced level or fails completely, does so in a way that protects people, property, or data from injury, damage, intrusion, or disclosure. In computers, a program might fail-safe by executing a graceful exit (as opposed to an uncontrolled crash) in order to prevent data corruption after experiencing an error. A similar distinction is made between \"failing well\" and \"failing badly\".\n\nFail-deadly is the opposite strategy, which can be used in weapon systems that are designed to kill or injure targets even if part of the system is damaged or destroyed.\n\nA system that is designed to experience graceful degradation, or to fail soft (used in computing, similar to \"fail safe\") operates at a reduced level of performance after some component failures. For example, a building may operate lighting at reduced levels and elevators at reduced speeds if grid power fails, rather than either trapping people in the dark completely or continuing to operate at full power. In computing an example of graceful degradation is that if insufficient network bandwidth is available to stream an online video, a lower-resolution version might be streamed in place of the high-resolution version. Progressive enhancement is an example in computing, where web pages are available in a basic functional format for older, small-screen, or limited-capability web browsers, but in an enhanced version for browsers capable of handling additional technologies or that have a larger display available.\n\nIn fault-tolerant computer systems, programs that are considered robust are designed to continue operation despite an error, exception, or invalid input, instead of crashing completely. Software brittleness is the opposite of robustness. Resilient networks continue to transmit data despite the failure of some links or nodes; resilient buildings and infrastructure are likewise expected to prevent complete failure in situations like earthquakes, floods, or collisions.\n\nA system with high failure transparency will alert users that a component failure has occurred, even if it continues to operate with full performance, so that failure can be repaired or imminent complete failure anticipated. Likewise, a fail-fast component is designed to report at the first point of failure, rather than allow downstream components to fail and generate reports then. This allows easier diagnosis of the underlying problem, and may prevent improper operation in a broken state.\n\nA single fault condition is a situation where one means for protection against a hazard is defective. If a single fault condition results unavoidably in another single fault condition, the two failures are considered as one single fault condition. A source offers the following example:\n\nRedundancy is the provision of functional capabilities that would be unnecessary in a fault-free environment.\nThis can consist of backup components that automatically \"kick in\" if one component fails. For example, large cargo trucks can lose a tire without any major consequences. They have many tires, and no one tire is critical (with the exception of the front tires, which are used to steer, but generally carry less load, each and in total, than the other four to 16, so are less likely to fail).\nThe idea of incorporating redundancy in order to improve the reliability of a system was pioneered by John von Neumann in the 1950s.\n\nTwo kinds of redundancy are possible: space redundancy and time redundancy. Space redundancy provides additional components, functions, or data items that are unnecessary for fault-free operation. Space redundancy is further classified into hardware, software and information redundancy, depending on the type of redundant resources added to the system. In time redundancy the computation or data transmission is repeated and the result is compared to a stored copy of the previous result. The current terminology for this kind of testing is referred to as 'In Service Fault Tolerance Testing or ISFTT for short.\n\nProviding fault-tolerant design for every component is normally not an option. Associated redundancy brings a number of penalties: increase in weight, size, power consumption, cost, as well as time to design, verify, and test. Therefore, a number of choices have to be examined to determine which components should be fault tolerant:\n\n\nAn example of a component that passes all the tests is a car's occupant restraint system. While we do not normally think of the \"primary\" occupant restraint system, it is gravity. If the vehicle rolls over or undergoes severe g-forces, then this primary method of occupant restraint may fail. Restraining the occupants during such an accident is absolutely critical to safety, so we pass the first test. Accidents causing occupant ejection were quite common before seat belts, so we pass the second test. The cost of a redundant restraint method like seat belts is quite low, both economically and in terms of weight and space, so we pass the third test. Therefore, adding seat belts to all vehicles is an excellent idea. Other \"supplemental restraint systems\", such as airbags, are more expensive and so pass that test by a smaller margin.\n\nAnother excellent and long-term example of this principle being put into practice is the braking system: whilst the actual brake mechanisms are critical, they are not particularly prone to sudden (rather than progressive) failure, and are in any case necessarily duplicated to allow even and balanced application of brake force to all wheels. It would also be prohibitively costly to further double-up the main components and they would add considerable weight. However, the similarly critical systems for actuating the brakes under driver control are inherently less robust, generally using a cable (can rust, stretch, jam, snap) or hydraulic fluid (can leak, boil and develop bubbles, absorb water and thus lose effectiveness). Thus in most modern cars the footbrake hydraulic brake circuit is diagonally divided to give two smaller points of failure, the loss of either only reducing brake power by 50% and not causing as much dangerous brakeforce imbalance as a straight front-back or left-right split, and should the hydraulic circuit fail completely (a relatively very rare occurrence), there is a failsafe in the form of the cable-actuated parking brake that operates the otherwise relatively weak rear brakes, but can still bring the vehicle to a safe halt in conjunction with transmission/engine braking so long as the demands on it are in line with normal traffic flow. The cumulatively unlikely combination of total foot brake failure with the need for harsh braking in an emergency will likely result in a collision, but still one at lower speed than would otherwise have been the case.\n\nIn comparison with the foot pedal activated service brake, the parking brake itself is a less critical item, and unless it is being used as a one-time backup for the footbrake, will not cause immediate danger if it is found to be nonfunctional at the moment of application. Therefore, no redundancy is built into it per se (and it typically uses a cheaper, lighter, but less hardwearing cable actuation system), and it can suffice, if this happens on a hill, to use the footbrake to momentarily hold the vehicle still, before driving off to find a flat piece of road on which to stop. Alternatively, on shallow gradients, the transmission can be shifted into Park, Reverse or First gear, and the transmission lock / engine compression used to hold it stationary, as there is no need for them to include the sophistication to first bring it to a halt.\n\nOn motorcycles, a similar level of fail-safety is provided by simpler methods; firstly the front and rear brake systems being entirely separate, regardless of their method of activation (that can be cable, rod or hydraulic), allowing one to fail entirely whilst leaving the other unaffected. Secondly, the rear brake is relatively strong compared to its automotive cousin, even being a powerful disc on sports models, even though the usual intent is for the front system to provide the vast majority of braking force; as the overall vehicle weight is more central, the rear tyre is generally larger and grippier, and the rider can lean back to put more weight on it, therefore allowing more brake force to be applied before the wheel locks up. On cheaper, slower utility-class machines, even if the front wheel should use a hydraulic disc for extra brake force and easier packaging, the rear will usually be a primitive, somewhat inefficient, but exceptionally robust rod-actuated drum, thanks to the ease of connecting the footpedal to the wheel in this way and, more importantly, the near impossibility of catastrophic failure even if the rest of the machine, like a lot of low-priced bikes after their first few years of use, is on the point of collapse from neglected maintenance.\n\nThe basic characteristics of fault tolerance require:\n\nIn addition, fault-tolerant systems are characterized in terms of both planned service outages and unplanned service outages. These are usually measured at the application level and not just at a hardware level. The figure of merit is called availability and is expressed as a percentage. For example, a five nines system would statistically provide 99.999% availability.\n\nFault-tolerant systems are typically based on the concept of redundancy.\n\nResearch into the kinds of tolerances needed for critical systems involves a large amount of interdisciplinary work. The more complex the system, the more carefully all possible interactions have to be considered and prepared for. Considering the importance of high-value systems in transport, public utilities and the military, the field of topics that touch on research is very wide: it can include such obvious subjects as software modeling and reliability, or hardware design, to arcane elements such as stochastic models, graph theory, formal or exclusionary logic, parallel processing, remote data transmission, and more.\n\nSpare components address the first fundamental characteristic of fault tolerance in three ways:\n\nAll implementations of RAID, redundant array of independent disks, except RAID 0, are examples of a fault-tolerant storage device that uses data redundancy.\n\nA lockstep fault-tolerant machine uses replicated elements operating in parallel. At any time, all the replications of each element should be in the same state. The same inputs are provided to each replication, and the same outputs are expected. The outputs of the replications are compared using a voting circuit. A machine with two replications of each element is termed dual modular redundant (DMR). The voting circuit can then only detect a mismatch and recovery relies on other methods. A machine with three replications of each element is termed triple modular redundant (TMR). The voting circuit can determine which replication is in error when a two-to-one vote is observed. In this case, the voting circuit can output the correct result, and discard the erroneous version. After this, the internal state of the erroneous replication is assumed to be different from that of the other two, and the voting circuit can switch to a DMR mode. This model can be applied to any larger number of replications.\n\nLockstep fault-tolerant machines are most easily made fully synchronous, with each gate of each replication making the same state transition on the same edge of the clock, and the clocks to the replications being exactly in phase. However, it is possible to build lockstep systems without this requirement.\n\nBringing the replications into synchrony requires making their internal stored states the same. They can be started from a fixed initial state, such as the reset state. Alternatively, the internal state of one replica can be copied to another replica.\n\nOne variant of DMR is pair-and-spare. Two replicated elements operate in lockstep as a pair, with a voting circuit that detects any mismatch between their operations and outputs a signal indicating that there is an error. Another pair operates exactly the same way. A final circuit selects the output of the pair that does not proclaim that it is in error. Pair-and-spare requires four replicas rather than the three of TMR, but has been used commercially.\n\n\"Failure-oblivious computing\" is a technique that enables computer programs to continue executing despite memory errors. The technique handles attempts to read invalid memory by returning a manufactured value to the program, which in turn, makes use of the manufactured value and ignores the former memory value it tried to access. This is a great contrast to typical memory checkers, which inform the program of the error or abort the program. In failure-oblivious computing, no attempt is made to inform the program that an error occurred. Furthermore, it happens that the execution is modified several times in a row, in order to prevent cascading failures.\n\nThe approach has performance costs: because the technique rewrites code to insert dynamic checks for address validity, execution time will increase by 80% to 500%.\n\nRecovery shepherding is a lightweight technique to enable software programs to recover from otherwise fatal errors such as null pointer dereference and divide by zero. Comparing to the failure oblivious computing technique, recovery shepherding works on the compiled program binary directly and does not need to recompile to program. \n\nIt uses the just-in-time binary instrumentation framework Pin. It attaches to the application process when an error occurs, repairs the execution, \ntracks the repair effects as the execution continues, contains the repair effects within the application process, and detaches from the process after all repair effects are flushed from the process state. It does not interfere with the normal execution of the program and therefore incurs negligible overhead. For 17 of 18 systematically collected real world null-dereference and divide-by-zero errors, a prototype implementation enables the application to continue to execute to provide acceptable output and service to its users on the error-triggering inputs.\n\nThe circuit breaker design pattern is a technique to avoid catastrophic failures in distributed systems. \n\nFault-tolerant design's advantages are obvious, while many of its disadvantages are not:\n\n\nHardware fault tolerance sometimes requires that broken parts be taken out and replaced with new parts while the system is still operational (in computing known as \"hot swapping\"). Such a system implemented with a single backup is known as single point tolerant and represents the vast majority of fault-tolerant systems. In such systems the mean time between failures should be long enough for the operators to have time to fix the broken devices (mean time to repair) before the backup also fails. It helps if the time between failures is as long as possible, but this is not specifically required in a fault-tolerant system.\n\nFault tolerance is notably successful in computer applications. Tandem Computers built their entire business on such machines, which used single-point tolerance to create their NonStop systems with uptimes measured in years.\n\nFail-safe architectures may encompass also the computer software, for example by process replication.\n\nData formats may also be designed to degrade gracefully. HTML for example, is designed to be forward compatible, allowing new HTML entities to be ignored by Web browsers that do not understand them without causing the document to be unusable.\n\nThere is a difference between fault tolerance and systems that rarely have problems. For instance, the Western Electric crossbar systems had failure rates of two hours per forty years, and therefore were highly \"fault resistant\". But when a fault did occur they still stopped operating completely, and therefore were not \"fault tolerant\".\n"}

Historians regard the Mongol devastation as one of the deadliest episodes in history. In addition, Mongol expeditions may have spread the bubonic plague across much of Eurasia, helping to spark the Black Death of the 14th century.\nThe Mongol Empire developed in the course of the 13th century through a series of victorious campaigns throughout Asia, reaching Eastern Europe by the 1240s. In contrast with later \"empires of the sea\" such as the British, the Mongol Empire was a land power, fueled by the grass-foraging Mongol cavalry and cattle. Thus most Mongol conquest and plundering took place during the warmer seasons, when there was sufficient grazing for their herds. The rise of the Mongols was preceded by 15 years of wet and warm weather conditions from 1211-1225 that allowed favourable conditions for the breeding of horses, which greatly assisted their expansion.\nAs the Mongol Empire began to fragment from 1260, conflict between the Mongols and Eastern European polities continued for centuries. Mongols continued to rule China into the 14th century under the Yuan dynasty, while Mongol rule in Persia persisted into the 15th century under the Timurid Empire. In India, the later Mughal Empire survived into the 19th century.\n\nGenghis Khan forged the initial Mongol Empire in Central Asia, starting with the unification of the Mongol tribes Merkits, Tartars, and Mongols. The Uighur Buddhist Qocho Kingdom surrendered and joined the empire. He then continued expansion via conquest of the Qara Khitai and the Khwarazmian dynasty.\n\nLarge areas of Islamic Central Asia and northeastern Iran were seriously depopulated, as every city or town that resisted the Mongols was destroyed. Each soldier was given a quota of enemies to execute according to circumstances. For example, after the conquest of Urgench, each Mongol warrior – in an army of perhaps two tumens (20,000 troops) – was required to execute 24 people.\n\nAgainst the Alans and the Cumans (Kipchaks), the Mongols used divide-and-conquer tactics by first warning the Cumans to end their support of the Alans, whom they then defeated. before rounding on the Cumans. Alans were recruited into the Mongol forces with one unit called \"Right Alan Guard\" which was combined with \"recently surrendered\" soldiers. Mongols and Chinese soldiers stationed in the area of the former Kingdom of Qocho and in Besh Balikh established a Chinese military colony led by Chinese general Qi Kongzhi (Ch'i Kung-chih).\n\nDuring the Mongol attack on the Mamluks in the Middle East, most of the Mamluk military was composed of Kipchaks, and the Golden Horde's supply of Kipchak fighters replenished the Mamluk armies and helped them fight off the Mongols.\n\nHungary became a refuge for fleeing Cumans.\n\nThe decentralized, stateless Kipchaks only converted to Islam after the Mongol conquest, unlike the centralized Karakhanid entity comprising the Yaghma, Qarluqs, and Oghuz who converted earlier to world religions.\n\nThe Mongol conquest of the Kipchaks led to a merged society with a Mongol ruling class over a Kipchak-speaking populace which came to be known as Tatar, and which eventually absorbed Armenians, Italians, Greeks, and Goths on the Crimean peninsula to form the modern day Crimean Tatar people.\n\nThe Mongols conquered, by battle or voluntary surrender, the areas of present-day Iran, Iraq, the Caucasus, and parts of Syria and Turkey, with further Mongol raids reaching southwards into Palestine as far as Gaza in 1260 and 1300. The major battles were the Siege of Baghdad (1258), when the Mongols sacked the city which had been the center of Islamic power for 500 years, and the Battle of Ain Jalut in 1260, when the Muslim Kipchak Mamluks were able to defeat the Mongols in the battle at Ain Jalut in the southern part of the Galilee—the first time the Mongols had been decisively stopped. One thousand northern Chinese engineer squads accompanied the Mongol Khan Hulagu during his conquest of the Middle East.\n\nGenghis Khan and his descendants launched progressive invasions of China, subjugating the Western Xia in 1209 before destroying them in 1227, defeating the Jin dynasty in 1234 and defeating the Song dynasty in 1279. They made the Kingdom of Dali into a vassal state in 1253 after the Dali King Duan Xingzhi defected to the Mongols and helped them conquer the rest of Yunnan, forced Korea to capitulate through invasions, but failed in their attempts to invade Japan, their fleets scattered by \"kamikaze\" storms.\nThe Mongols' greatest triumph was when Kublai Khan established the Yuan dynasty in China in 1271. The dynasty created a \"Han Army\" (漢軍) out of defected Jin troops and an army of defected Song troops called the \"Newly Submitted Army\" (新附軍).\n\nThe Mongol force which invaded southern China was far greater than the force they sent to invade the Middle East in 1256.\n\nThe Yuan dynasty established the top-level government agency Bureau of Buddhist and Tibetan Affairs to govern Tibet, which was conquered by the Mongols and put under Yuan rule. The Mongols also invaded Sakhalin Island between 1264 and 1308. Likewise, Korea (Goryeo) became a semi-autonomous vassal state of the Yuan dynasty for about 80 years.\n\nBy 1206, Genghis Khan had conquered all Mongol and Turkic tribes in Mongolia and southern Siberia. In 1207 his eldest son Jochi subjugated the Siberian forest people, the Uriankhai, the Oirats, Barga, Khakas, Buryats, Tuvans, Khori-Tumed, and Kyrgyz. He then organized the Siberians into three tumens. Genghis Khan gave the Telengit and Tolos along the Irtysh River to an old companion, Qorchi. While the Barga, Tumed, Buriats, Khori, Keshmiti, and Bashkirs were organized in separate thousands, the Telengit, Tolos, Oirats and Yenisei Kirghiz were numbered into the regular tumens Genghis created a settlement of Chinese craftsmen and farmers at Kem-kemchik after the first phase of the Mongol conquest of the Jin dynasty. The Great Khans favored gyrfalcons, furs, women and Kyrgyz horses for tribute.\n\nWestern Siberia came under the Golden Horde. The descendants of Orda Khan, the eldest son of Jochi, directly ruled the area. In the swamps of western Siberia, dog sled Yam stations were set up to facilitate collection of tribute.\n\nIn 1270, Kublai Khan sent a Chinese official, with a new batch of settlers, to serve as judge of the Kyrgyz and Tuvan basin areas (益蘭州 and 謙州). Ogedei's grandson Kaidu occupied portions of Central Siberia from 1275 on. The Yuan dynasty army under Kublai's Kipchak general Tutugh reoccupied the Kyrgyz lands in 1293. From then on the Yuan dynasty controlled large portions of Central and Eastern Siberia.\n\nThe Mongols invaded and destroyed Volga Bulgaria and Kievan Rus', before invading Poland, Hungary, Bulgaria, and other territories. Over the course of three years (1237–1240), the Mongols razed all the major cities of Russia with the exceptions of Novgorod and Pskov.\n\nGiovanni da Pian del Carpine, the Pope's envoy to the Mongol Great Khan, traveled through Kiev in February 1246 and wrote:\n\nThe Mongol invasions displaced populations on a scale never seen before in central Asia or eastern Europe. Word of the Mongol hordes' approach spread terror and panic.\n\nFrom 1221 to 1327, the Mongol Empire launched several invasions into the Indian subcontinent. The Mongols occupied parts of modern Pakistan and other parts of Punjab for decades. However, they failed to penetrate past the outskirts of Delhi and were repelled from the interior of India. Centuries later, the Mughal Empire, with Mongol roots from Central Asia, conquered the sub-continent.\n\nKublai Khan's Yuan dynasty invaded Burma between 1277 and 1287, resulting in the capitulation and disintegration of the Pagan Kingdom. However, the invasion of 1301 was repulsed by the Burmese Myinsaing Kingdom. The Mongol invasions of Vietnam (Đại Việt) and Java resulted in defeat for the Mongols, although much of Southeast Asia agreed to pay tribute to avoid further bloodshed.\n\nDue to the lack of contemporary records, estimates of the violence associated with the Mongol conquests vary considerably. Not including the mortality from the Plague in Europe, West Asia, or China it is possible that between 20 and 57 million people were killed between 1206 and 1405 during the various campaigns of Genghis Khan, Kublai Khan, and Timur. The havoc included battles, sieges, early biological warfare, and massacres.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Grbac (born August 13, 1970) is a former American football quarterback who played in the National Football League (NFL) and currently serves as the head football coach, Marianist Urban Student Program director, and athletic director at Villa Angela-St. Joseph High School in Cleveland. During his career he was a starting quarterback for the San Francisco 49ers, the Kansas City Chiefs, and the Baltimore Ravens. In college, at the University of Michigan, he was the 1992 NCAA Division I passing efficiency leader, and a three time efficiency leader in the Big Ten Conference, the 1992 Sammy Baugh Trophy winner, and the quarterback for 1991 Heisman Trophy award winner Desmond Howard. Drafted by the 49ers in 1993, and serving in his rookie year as the backup to Steve Young, he went on to play seven more seasons, starting 70 of the 106 games he played for San Francisco (1993–96), Kansas City (1997–2000) and Baltimore (2001).\n\nDuring his career, Grbac was on one Super Bowl-winning team with the 49ers over the San Diego Chargers, and won one AFC West title in 1997 while quarterbacking the Chiefs. He still holds six all-time records with the Chiefs, including most consecutive games with a passing touchdown (15) and most yards gained in a single game (504).\n\nGrbac was born in Cleveland, Ohio, to Ivan and Cecilija Grbac His father was born in Lanišće, near Buzet, Istra, Croatia, and his mother was also from Istra. His parents left Croatia in 1967 with their two eldest children, Maria and Engelbert (Elvis's eldest sister and brother).\n\nGrbac attended St. Joseph High School. While there he played basketball as well as football; one of his high-school teammates was future Heisman Trophy winner Desmond Howard.\n\nAlthough Grbac initially wished to continue his football career at Ohio State, he changed his mind when the Buckeyes fired head coach Earle Bruce and opted instead to join Howard at the University of Michigan, where he played college football from 1989 to 1992. He led the Wolverines to a Gator Bowl in 1991, three Rose Bowls in 1990 and 1993 and 1992 and is best remembered for throwing to wide receiver Desmond Howard during the latter's Heisman-winning season in 1991. In 1991 Grbac's pass to Howard sealed a 24–14 victory over Notre Dame. In that game Grbac completed 20-of-22 passes, a record for a Notre Dame opponent. He finished his career at Michigan as the school's all-time leader in passing attempts (835), completions (522), passing yards (6,460) and passing touchdowns (71). These marks were later broken by John Navarre in 2003 and surpassed by Chad Henne in 2006–2007.\n\nGrbac also established the Big Ten Conference career passing efficiency record that would stand for six seasons until it was surpassed by Joe Germaine. Grbac was a two-time National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) passing efficiency champion during his last two seasons. He was a three-time Big Ten champion in this statistic.\n\nGrbac was drafted in the eighth round (219th overall) of the 1993 NFL Draft by the San Francisco 49ers, where he served as Steve Young's backup from 1994 to 1996.\n\nDealing with an injury and being taken in and out of the lineup by then-head coach George Seifert, Grbac played in 11 games in his rookie season, recording two touchdown passes, against the Minnesota Vikings and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, while throwing one interception.\n\nDuring his rookie season, Grbac posted a QB rating of 98.2, with two touchdowns, and completing 35-of-55 pass attempts.\n\nGrbac appeared in a total of sixteen games with the 49ers, five of them as the starting quarterback. In Week 11, he led the 49ers to an upset victory over the eventual Super Bowl champion Dallas Cowboys, 38–20, throwing for two touchdowns and running for a third. Grbac ended the season with a QB rating of 96.6, 183 passes attempted and 127 completed, eight passing touchdowns and two rushing, for a total of 1,469 yards gained.\n\nDuring the 1996 season, Grbac played a total of 15 regular season games, four as a starter, passing for 10 touchdowns and rushing for two, with a total of 122 passes completed and 1,236 yards gained. In 1997, Grbac signed a contract with the Kansas City Chiefs to be their starting quarterback.\n\nGrbac replaced Steve Bono as the Chiefs starter in 1997. He orchestrated a \"Monday Night Football\" comeback in Week Two against the Oakland Raiders. Despite trailing by two touchdowns late in the second half, he rallied the Chiefs by directing a six-play, 80-yard touchdown drive without the benefit of a single time-out, culminating that comeback with a 32-yard game-winner to Andre Rison with 0:03 remaining to seal a 28–27 Chiefs win.\n\nIn the 1997 season Grbac led the Chiefs to their fourth AFC West Division championship, as the team finished the year with six consecutive victories, a first in team history. The 1997 season was also the beginning of a quarterback controversy, when Grbac started the first nine games and suffered an injury, leading to Rich Gannon's substitution for the next six games. Grbac would return in the team's season finale. Gannon won five consecutive starts down the stretch to help the Chiefs earn home-field advantage with a 13–3 record. Grbac was an excellent quarterback, and a talented thrower, while Gannon was an aggressive leader who demanded the most of his players. Grbac was selected by coach Marty Schottenheimer to start the team's playoff game against the Denver Broncos, a game which the Chiefs would lose 14–10. Chiefs fans were divided over whether Gannon or Grbac should lead the team. Eventually Grbac was chosen to remain the Chiefs starting quarterback, Gannon was let go and signed with the Raiders in 1999.\n\nThe 1998 season began with high hopes of the team avenging its loss in the 1997–98 playoffs to the eventual Super Bowl champion Denver Broncos, but instead the Chiefs struggled in the highly competitive AFC West. Grbac completed only 98-of-188 attempts, for five touchdowns, and gained 1,142 yards in this season.\n\nIn 1999, Grbac managed to lead the Chiefs to 2nd place in the AFC West with a 9–7 record, starting all 16 games, For the season, Grbac threw for 22 touchdowns and 3,389 yards.\n\nHowever, in the final game of the season against the Oakland Raiders, the Chiefs were denied a trip to the playoffs and an AFC West division title when Raiders kicker Joe Nedney kicked a game-winning field-goal in overtime.\n\nHis best season statistically came in 2000 when he passed for 4,169 yards and 28 touchdowns with a passer rating of 89.9 en route to the 2001 Pro Bowl.\n\nGrbac signed a free-agent contract with the Baltimore Ravens to replace former starter Trent Dilfer. The contract was for over five years and was worth $30 million. While Dilfer had been the starting quarterback of Baltimore's Super Bowl winning team, he was seen as nothing more than a \"game manager\", and the Ravens wished to upgrade at the quarterback position.\n\nAlthough the Ravens recorded a 10–6 regular season record and qualified for the playoffs, Grbac's performance was considered a disappointment. He performed statistically below Dilfer's performance in the previous season, and two of the Ravens' wins occurred when Randall Cunningham started at quarterback. In the postseason, Grbac helped the team win the wild card round against the Miami Dolphins, but was defeated by the Pittsburgh Steelers in the divisional round. He threw three interceptions, and the Ravens failed to score an offensive touchdown during the game.\n\nAt the end of the season, the Ravens released Grbac in a salary cap move after he refused to renegotiate his contract. At the time of his retirement, Grbac had been in negotiations with the Denver Broncos—Denver was interested in signing him as a backup to starting quarterback Brian Griese, but Grbac opted for retirement.\n\nGrbac was featured as \"People\"s Sexiest Athlete in 1998. Sportswriter Jeff Pearlman claims this was because of a mistake by a photographer, told to photograph \"the Chiefs quarterback\", who accidentally photographed Grbac instead of the intended Rich Gannon. The story was later confirmed by a \"People\" employee.\n\nGrbac lives in Chagrin Falls and was an assistant quarterbacks coach for St. Ignatius High School in Cleveland, Ohio. On April 10, 2019, Grbac was named the athletic director and head football coach at his alma mater Villa Angela-St. Joseph High School. In addition to his roles in the athletic department, he will also be the head of the Marianist Urban Student Program (MUSP) at the school.\n\nGrbac has a brother, Engelbert, and two sisters, Maria and Barbara. He lives in Chagrin Falls, just outside Cleveland, with his wife Lori (née Immarino) and his three children: Ella, Jack, and Calvin. Grbac reverted to Catholicism when he was going through his \"dark times\".\n\n"}

Sims) is the stage name of Matthew Sims, a Berlin-based American DJ, performance artist and producer. A native of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Sims began his career in the local music scene. Sims was involved in several groups, the most notable of which was Citizen King, an Alternative Rock band famous for their 1999 hit \"Better Days (And the Bottom Drops Out)\", which reached #25 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart. However, Citizen King would not see any further success, and the band disbanded by 2002. Around the same time, Sims relocated to Los Angeles, where he continued his music career as a solo artist. Starting Mount Sims as an electronic music act, later releases have also shown influences from post punk, new wave, and Dark wave. Sims is almost exclusively responsible for every aspect of his music, providing vocals, instrumentation, and production. He was originally supported by two dancers, whereas the last incarnation under the altered spelling Mt. Sims was a three-piece band that included Rand Twigg on bass and Andre Lange on drums.\n\nHis first album, \"Ultra Sex\" on International DeeJay Gigolo Records in Europe and Emperor Norton Records the US, was released to good reviews. It was influenced by German and British New Wave bands, funk, and electronica. It was a concept album that focused on the themes of technology and sexuality. The album contains the tracks \"How We Do\" and \"Rational Behaviour.\"\n\nMount Sims' second album \"Wild Light\" (Released in 2005 on International DeeJay Gigolo Records) is a much darker album than the previous release. Its themes are death and information. Major musical influences are darkwave and post punk. David J. of Bauhaus played bass on some of Wild Light's songs. Roger Joseph Manning, Jr. was responsible for some of the synth production. It contains the songs \"No Yellow lines,\" \"Lights on,\" and \"Restless,\" a single featured in Amped 3.\n\nMount Sims is responsible for Madonna's remixes of her song \"Nobody Knows Me,\" from her 2003 album American Life, in which he was noted to time compress a speech by Charles Manson in order to construct different electronic drums, which he then placed in the remix.\n\nIn addition, Mount Sims' song \"Torn into\" was featured in the film Lost in Translation.\n\nMt. Sims' third album \"Happily Ever After\" (2008/Hungry Eye Records) continues on the influences of the previous release with its themes focusing on obsession, isolation, horror, and madness. It was produced by Thomas Stern of Crime & the City Solution and features guest appearances by Jessie Evans (formerly of Subtonix, Autonervous, and The Vanishing), Toby Dammit (Swans, The Residents, and Iggy Pop), and Bryan Black (Motor). The album artwork was created by Peter Wu with layout by Dez of Crossover.\n\nIn 2008, he joined the band The Silures, which was founded by Vitalic and Linda Lamb in 2002. In 2009, he quit the group.\n\nIn 2010, he collaborated with The Knife and Planningtorock on the electronic opera Tomorrow, In a Year. It is based on Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species and was released as a studio album.\n\nIt was also in 2010 that he collaborated with Warp Records artist Leila for her album U&I, of which he contributed his voice to her electronic compositions.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The total length is 1428km. Under the new numbering it has become part of the NH48.\n\nThe highway is part of the Golden Quadrilateral project undertaken by National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) and was the first section to be completed. The Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway, Jaipur-Kishangarh Expressway, and Ahmedabad Vadodara Expressway are part of NH 8.

In a modified form the octoechos is still regarded as the foundation of the tradition of monodic chant in the Byzantine Rite today.\n\nThe names ascribed to the eight tones differ in translations into Church Slavonic. The Slavonic system counted the plagioi echoi as Glas 5, 6, 7, and 8. For reference, these differences are shown here together with the Ancient Greek names of the octave species according to the Hagiopolites (see Hagiopolitan Octoechos) and to the chant treatises and tonaries of Carolingian theorists. Fifteenth-century composers like Manuel Chrysaphes, Lampadarios at the Court of Palaiologan Constantinople exchanged the Phrygian with the Lydian. The Armenian names and their temporal cycles are represented in the article about the hymn books octoechos and parakletike.\nSouthern Slavs use the Byzantine musical system and, nonetheless, use the variant numbering that is always found in Church Slavonic texts.\n\nAccording to three main periods, which divides the history of the eight-mode system, the former article has been split chronologically:\nByzantine Chant performance practice has been computationally compared to the theory by Chrysanthos. The analysis of 94 Byzantine Chants performed by 4 singers showed a tendency of the singers to level theoretic particularities of the echos that stand out of the general norm in the octoechos. In practice, smaller scale degree steps (67-133 cents) appear to be increased and the highest scale step of 333 cents appears to be decreased compared to theory. In practice, the first four scale notes in decreasing order of prominence I, III, II, IV are more prominent than the V., VI., and the VII.\n"}
{"id": "2091476", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2091476", "title": "Dave Nellist", "text": "Dave Nellist\n\nDavid John Nellist (born 16 July 1952) is a British Trotskyist activist who was the MP for the constituency of Coventry South East from 1983 to 1992. Elected as a Labour MP, his support for the Militant tendency led to his eventual expulsion from the party in late 1991. He is the National Chair of the Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition, a member of the Socialist Party, and was a city councillor in Coventry from 1998 to 2012.\n\nA long-standing supporter of the Militant tendency, Nellist was the MP for Coventry South East from 1983 to 1992. He was known for his standing as a \"workers' MP on a worker's wage\", taking only the wage of a skilled factory worker, which amounted to 40% of what was then an MP's salary. The rest he donated to the Labour movement and to charities. From 1982 to 1986, Nellist was also a Labour councillor for Coventry on West Midlands County Council.\n\nWhen Tony Blair was first elected to Parliament in 1983, he initially shared an office with Nellist at the Palace of Westminster. The duo's differing political views were considered not to make for the most harmonious working environment, so Blair was quickly allocated office space with Gordon Brown, another newly elected Labour MP, and Nellist subsequently shared the office of the other Militant supporting MP, Terry Fields.\n\nIn late 1991, shortly before his expulsion from the Labour Party, he was awarded the \"Backbencher of the Year\" award by the conservative \"Spectator\" magazine. Michael White of \"The Guardian\" recalled in 2007 the speech Nellist gave after receiving the award: \"It was witty and highly political, done with style and without compromise. They cheered him fervently and then returned to their brandy. But it was one of the best speeches I have ever heard.\"\n\nNellist in 1991 was one of the two MPs who were supporters of Militant, which had been found to contravene the Labour Party constitution several years earlier. After a National Executive Committee meeting in December 1991, along with Terry Fields he was expelled from the Labour Party and deselected as a candidate for the 1992 general election.\n\nNellist gained the support of his Constituency party (which was subsequently suspended by the National Executive Committee) and a number of local trade unions. Standing as an Independent Labour candidate in the elections, he came third in his old seat to the newly selected Labour Party candidate Jim Cunningham. Cunningham received 11,902 votes, Conservative Party candidate Martine Hyams 10,591, and Dave Nellist 10,551, or 28.9% of the vote.\n\nNellist followed the majority of Militant in founding what became the Socialist Party (not to be confused with the Socialist Party of Great Britain). Due to registration requirements, the party uses the name \"Socialist Alternative\" on ballot papers. Instead of running candidates independently, however, the party has played a leading role in several political coalitions, including the Socialist Alliance.\n\nNellist was a prominent figure in organising the Socialist Alliance, locally and across the UK, as a loose formation of individuals and groups. He became the Chair of the Socialist Alliance, but resigned in 2001, in protest of what the Socialist Party saw as manoeuvrings of the Socialist Workers Party to take control of the Alliance. He is involved in the Campaign for a New Workers' Party in Britain, which is a Socialist Party sponsored campaign to create a new party to represent the working class in the UK.\n\nNellist has run for Member of Parliament in every general election since his deselection by the Labour Party until 2015. In 1997, he ran in the Coventry South constituency, and received 3,262 votes (6.5%). In 2001 and 2005, he ran in the Coventry North East constituency. In 2001, he received 2,638 votes (7.1%). In 2005, he received 1,874 votes (5.0%).\n\nIn 1998, Nellist was elected as a City Councillor in the Coventry City Council for St. Michael's ward, where he was reelected in 2004 and again in 2008, with an increased majority, when he received 48.6% of the vote. By 2006, when Rob Windsor was elected, the Socialist Party had won all three of St. Michael's seats. However, Nellist's Socialist colleagues were defeated in the local elections of 2007 and 2010, respectively, and in the 2012 local elections, Nellist lost his seat in the St. Michael's ward to the Labour Party candidate Naeem Akhtar by 213 votes.\n\nNellist stood as a No to EU – Yes to Democracy candidate in the 2009 European election in the West Midlands Region of England gaining 13,415 votes (0.9%). No2EU takes a socialist, trade union and alter-globalisation Eurosceptic stance from a workers' perspective.\n\nAfter the 2009 European elections, Nellist played a leading role in the formation of the Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition (TUSC), of which he is interim leader. The coalition is composed of the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers, Socialist Party, Socialist Resistance, the Socialist Workers Party and Solidarity; and is endorsed by Steve Gillan, General Secretary of the Prison Officers' Association and Chris Baugh, Assistant General Secretary of Public and Commercial Services Union. Considering the overlap in constituent parties, TUSC is seen as a successor to the Socialist Alliance and the No to EU – Yes to Democracy alliance.\n\nNellist stood as a candidate for TUSC in the 2010 general elections in the constituency Coventry North East, although he stood under the label Socialist Alternative. Running against the incumbent MP, the Labour government's Secretary of State for Defence Bob Ainsworth, he received 1,592 votes (3.7%) losing his deposit for the first time in a Westminster constituency.\n\nIn August 2015, Nellist endorsed Jeremy Corbyn's campaign in the Labour Party leadership election. He said: \"I hope Jeremy does well in the election and, if successful, his first action should be to instruct local Labour councils to halt cuts and direct a strategy to resist austerity.\" Nellist also hinted he could seek to merge his new party with the Labour Party.\n\nIn August 2016, Nellist also endorsed Corbyn's campaign in the Labour Party leadership election. He responded to the letter backing Owen Smith's leadership challenge from over 500 Labour councillors by saying: \"If Jeremy is re-elected he must use his renewed mandate to compel Labour councillors to either fight the Tories or stand aside for those who will – and TUSC will back him all the way.\" In November 2016, he was among 75 people expelled from the Labour Party who wrote to the party's National Executive Committee asking to be re-admitted. However, he is not eligible to rejoin while being affiliated to another political party.\n\nIn May 2017, he withdrew as a candidate for the general election and encouraged supporters in Coventry to back Jeremy Corbyn for Prime Minister. He said: \"I support Jeremy's anti-austerity policies of higher wages, free university education, crash housebuilding programme, public ownership of the railways – and 4 more bank holidays! I want to see him elected Prime Minister on June 8th... we have a chance on June 8th to send Jeremy to No. 10 and we can't do that if Coventry sends Tory MPs to Westminster.\"\n\nIn August 1984, Nellist married Jane (née Warner) in North Yorkshire. In 2014, she was elected as a member of the National Executive Committee of the National Union of Teachers. They have two daughters (born 1985 and 1987) and one son (born 1989). Nellist also has a daughter born 1982.\n\nFrom 1992 to 1997, he worked on welfare rights cases for Robert Zara Ltd, solicitors in Coventry. From 1997 to 2017, he worked for Coventry Citizens Advice Bureau, from 1997 - 2012 as a case worker, from 2012 - 2017 as IT manager.\n\nUK Parliament elections\nUK Local elections\n\nEuropean elections\n"}

K. Rama Rao's novel of same name. Ramarao was known for his crime and detective novels, but this film was a social drama. It was directed by Siddalingaiah under the banner Srinidhi Productions. Prior to this, Siddalingaiah had worked with Rajkumar in \"Mayor Muthanna\". It stars Rajkumar and Bharathi in lead roles. The film was screened for over two years at the States Theatre (now Bhumika Theatre) in Bangalore and was screened for sixty weeks in Chamundeshwari theatre in Mysore, the film Completed one year in many centres and twenty five weeks in every major and minor centre.\n\nThe film was produced by R. Lakshman and Gopal, the film set new standards in the production design. Breaking away from conventional movie making, the producers preferred an open discussion with the crew and preliminary survey of outdoor shooting venues. While Lakshman was a Kannada activist closely associated with a league of frontline writers such as A.N. Krishna Rao and M.N. Murthy and managing the famous Bharat Talkies on the J.C. Road, Gopal was his close associate with a penchant for cinema. Most of the film was shot in Kalasa village in Chikmagalur district.\n\nThe music for the film was composed by G. K. Venkatesh. All five songs of the film became hits. Among the five songs, the song \"Aagadu Endu Kai Katti Kulithare\" became an inspirational song to the people. All the songs were sung by P. Susheela and P. B.

The Film grossed 4.5 Crores which adjusted to inflation in 2020 is 1743.45 Crores and is the biggest hit of KFI. Today this film is viewed as a milestone in Rajkumar's career. On the centenary of Indian cinema in April 2013, \"Forbes\" included Rajkumar's performance in the film on its list, \"25 Greatest Acting Performances of Indian Cinema\". The film was remade in Telugu in 1975 as \"Devudulanti Manishi\", starring Krishna.\n\nThe plot of \"Bangaarada Manushya\" revolves around Rajiv (Rajkumar), a lad educated in the city. The movie starts off with Rajiv, who is on his way to visit his sister Sharadha (Adeevani Lakshmidevi). Upon reaching, he finds to his astonishment that his brother-in-law has died. As his brother-in-law was the sole bread-winner in the family, there was no one left to look after Rajiv's elder sister, her two sons (Vajramuni and Srinath) and her daughter, Saraswati, who are still pursuing education. The sister had not informed Rajiv of her husband's ill health as she thought Rajiv would find it hard to concentrate on his examinations. The elder brother Ramachandra (Loknath) is a puppet in his wife's hands (M. N. Lakshmi Devi) and always listens to her. As per her demands he doesn't even pay for funeral costs and returns to the city with his wife and daughter fearing that he would have to bear the burden of her sister's family. Rajiv decides the best way to get back on the horse is to start farming on his brother-in-law's land. But for that he needs capital, which he decides to ask from the village head and family friend Rachutappa (Balakrishna). Rajiv also asks money for Keshava (Vajramuni) and Chakrapani's (Srinath) education costs. Rachutappa lends without hesitation.\n\nKeshava and Chakrapani leave for Bengaluru. Rajiv's sister is still hopeful of her elder brother helping her out and hence goes to his house. Upon her arrival, she meets her sister-in-law who treats her harshly and asks her husband to get rid of this metaphorical albatross. Humiliated, she returns home and informs Rajiv about this who had half expected it. Rajiv's brother-in-law's land had been cultivated by a worker for a long time who after the brother-in-law's death had claimed it as his own. After a small fight between him and Rajiv, interrupted by Rachutappa the worker cedes the land to Rajiv. Now Rajiv begins cultivating his land with help from a friendly villager. On the sidelines, the romance between the neighbour's daughter Lakshmi (Bharathi Vishnuvardhan) results in the hit song \"Baala Bangaara\". On the lighter side, Rachutappa's son (Dwarakish), who was studying in Bangalore returns to the village where immediately the tussle between the modern ways of the son and the traditional ways of the father begins. With the 2 acres land that he was cultivating, he was able to make ends meet, but it was not enough and decides to buy 25 acres of barren land near the village from the government. Again he takes loan from Rachutappa who advises against this. Undeterred, Rajiv goes ahead. On seeing the barren land, Rachutappa collapses in despair thinking Rajiv had made a mistake. Then follows another hit inspirational song from the movie, \"Agadu Endu\". During the song, an important message is given, which is the use of technology in farming. Rajiv with the help of engineers turns the land fertile. Making huge profits, Rajiv repays the loans with interest and builds a proper house replacing the hut they once lived in. He becomes a respectable person in the village.\n\nRajiv keeps going to another city, Belgaum every 6 months for a day citing one or the other reason. Keshava and Chakrapani return to the village after successfully completing their education. Though all the elders including Lakshmi's parents had agreed Rajiv and Lakshmi's betrothal, for some reason, Rajiv does not agree. On one of his trips to Belgaum, his purpose there is revealed. As he makes his way towards a house, he stops short as a nosy neighbour strikes up a conversation hoping to get more info out of him. The neighbour accuses him of carelessness for leaving his wife and kid and going on business trips for 6 months all the time. Rajiv asks the woman, Sharavathi (Aarathi) about her son, Kishore. Again on the sidelines, an important message of co-operative farming is given through a small incident.\n\nChakrapani, a doctor decides to stay in the village so does Sridhar. Keshava stays in Bengaluru. The elder brother, Ramachandra's daughter, Nagaveni expresses her wish to marry Keshava, to which even her mother agrees as he is well educated and has a lucrative job. Hence they go to Rajiv's house to talk about this. Rajiv's sister, Sharadha tells Ramachandra to talk about this with Rajiv. Rajiv and Sharadha are opposed to this, but decide to respect Keshava and Chakrapani's decision. To their surprise, Keshava also expresses his desire to marry Nagaveni. Chakrapani agrees to marry a family friends' daughter. Sridhar, a friend of Keshava and Chakrapani whose education costs were also taken up by Rajiv agrees to marry Saraswati, Keshava and Chakrapani's younger sister. Again on the lighter side, Rachutappa's son starts throwing tantrums that everyone in the village of his age are married except him. Rajiv tries to console him and mend the relationship between son and father. Rachutappa pulls a quick one on Rajiv by putting forth a condition that he will marry off his son only when Rajiv gets married. Finally Rajiv agrees to marriage with Lakshmi. Another song \"Hani Hani Gooddre\" is sung during Suggi Habba, showing how the village has flourished.\n\nKeshava's wife Nagaveni pesters him to quit his current job and start a business as his current pay is not enough for their posh lifestyle. Their conversation is interrupted by Patil, who works for Keshava. Patil sees Rajiv's photo in the house and informs him of Rajiv's periodical visit to Belgaum. To confirm the disturbing news given by Patil, Keshava goes to Belgaum. He enters Sharavathi's house and sees Rajiv's photo hanging inside. When asked who he was, Sharavathi replies \"Mane Yajamanrudu (House owner)\". With no respect for Rajiv anymore, Keshava confronts Rajiv and asks 50,000 Rupees so that he could start a business. Rajiv doesn't agree and refuses to give him money until he learns its value. Rajiv leaves the room while Lakshmi and Sharadha is still in the room. Keshava in anger reveals to them about Sharavathi, accusing Rajiv of adultery. Both of them refuse to believe this and decide not to tell Rajiv that they know about Sharavathi. Rajiv had bought Lakshmi a red saree. She decides to wear it while bringing lunch to Rajiv who is the field. On the way the red colour of the cloth attracts a bull which starts chasing her. While Rajiv fights off the bull, Lakshmi falls into a nearby well and by the time Rajiv dives in to save her, it is too late.\n\nNagaveni convinces Keshava to seek legal help in reclaiming what is rightfully his. Here Rajiv and Sharadha are in utter despair over Lakshmi's loss. In a bid to make a starving Sharadha eat, Rajiv agrees to eat with her. Just when the dinner is set, Keshava makes an entrance with a lawyer. Rajiv doesn't entertain this, by not even turning around, instead Sharadha gets up. While a verbal fight breaks out between son and mother, Keshava hurls some hurtful words at Rajiv. He accuses Rajiv of stealing their property and taking advantage of their situation. He goes to the extent of saying that the rice in front of him is not his. Hearing this, Rajiv washes his hands without having eaten a morsel of rice. Quietly Rajiv walks out of the house while praying for the well-being of the villagers. Chakrapani tracks down Sharavathi and brings her to Rajiv's house to show Rajiv's greatness to Keshava. Sharavathi reveals that she is their step-sister, i.e., she was the illegitimate child of Sharadha's husband. Rajiv had kept this a secret and had helped her all these years.\n\nAll set out to search for Rajiv, but they don't find him. Rajiv quietly walks into the sunset.\n\n\nThe film was shot at Kalasapura and in Chikmagalur.\n\nThe soundtrack of the film was composed by G. K. Venkatesh, with lyrics penned by Hunsur Krishnamurthy, Chi. Udaya Shankar, R. N. Jayagopal and Vijaya Narasimha. The two romantic songs \"Aaha Mysooru Mallige\" and \"Baala Bangaara Neenu, Haneya Singara Neenu\" have withstood the test of time. The audio was later released on Saregama.\n\nThe song \"Aaha Mysooru Mallige\" was later used by G. K. Venkatesh in the 1977 Telugu movie \"Chakradhari\" as \"Naalo Evevo Vinthalu\", which incidentally was the remake of 1974 Kannada movie \"Bhakta Kumbara\", also starring Rajkumar, with music composition by G. K. Venkatesh.\n\nThe songs \"Aagadu Endu\" and \"Nagu Naguta Nali\" remain inspirational even now. The farmer talks about how never giving up is necessary for success and that there is no substitute for hard work. The song incorporates many old proverbs and sayings found in Kannada literature like \"kei kesaradare, bai mosaru\" and also some translated versions of those from English like \"where there is a will, there is a way\" and \"work is worship\". While saying \"nothing is impossible\", it says Belur and Halebidu would not have been possible with a weak mind. Elucidating \"nothing ventured, nothing gained\", the lyricist banks on the achievements of Sir Mokshagundam Visvesvaraya by saying if he had not built Kannambadi Katte, Karnataka would not have been blessed by Kaveri. The latter talks about always being happy even during hardship. It says everything happens for a good reason and in accordance with the God's plan. The song emphasizes that the most valuable things in life are intangible and cannot be quantified. It starts to list out some of them and iterates its stand on it being priceless. One can be wealthy by giving and receiving love. A child without clothes or footwear is not poor due to his/her mother's love. Time spent with friends in childhood which becomes valuable memories later is also wealth.\n\n\"Bangaarada Manushya\" had a tremendous impact on moviegoers. Some city youth, inspired by the movie's central theme—returning to one's ancestral village—left their jobs, came back to their respective villages and took to agriculture. The film had a phenomenal box office run and was screened for two years in a row in the States film theatre on Kempe Gowda road in Bangalore. The film had a deep social impact on the audience as well and there are many stories of people in the city going to villages and becoming farmers. The film also touched on very important topics like rural development, modern agricultural practices, co-operative movement, social unity, honesty, love and dedication. In the beginning of the movie, it shows the hardship of farmers and how much they have to toil in order to make ends meet. The movie subtly says that middle-class and working-class are the backbone of the country by showing the son of a rich village head as being a spoiled brat wasting his money in the city. One of the most important messages given in the movie is that, one should not waste time and money in trying to modernize/westernize themselves through a posh lifestyle. One should be true to his identity and not try to become someone else. This theme struck a chord with the audience as Karnataka was one of the fast developing states in the country and there was a large migration from rural to urban areas.\n\nAfter the film ran for a year just at the State cinema in Bangalore, the management of the cinema hall decided to stop screening the film to accommodate a new film. This caused public outrage and took a violent turn. However, S. Bangarappa, the then MLA, intervened and resolved the issue successfully. The film went on to complete two years.\n\nThe film was remade in Telugu in 1975 as \"Devudulanti Manishi\", starring Krishna.\n\nThe 2017 film \"Bangara s/o Bangarada Manushya\" starring Dr. Rajkumar's son ShivRajkumar had a similar plot dealing with the problems of farmers. The title of the film inspired a book of same name written by A. N. Prahlada Rao.\n\nThe English translation of the book \"Bangarada Manushya\" named was released in New Jersey, United States on 10 May 2008. The same book was released in London, England by Edward Thamson, Senator during the month of August 2008. The late thespian Rajkumar, who made Kannadigas proud with his brilliant acting skills and his golden voice, the book dedicated to him, in English. Rajkumar: The Inimitable Actor With A Golden Voice was released by the actor’s wife Parvathamma Rajkumar in May 2008 at Bangalore also. She handed over the first copy to Professor K. S. Nissar Ahemed, the famous poet and Padmshree Awardee. The book, originally written in Kannada by A. N. Prahlada Rao, and titled \"Bangarada Manushya\" (The Golden Man), was first released in 2005 in the presence of Rajkumar himself. It ran into four editions and sold over 15,000 copies. The book has been translated into English by literary critic C. N. Ramachandran and journalist Alladi Jayashri. Published by Sapna Book House, Bangalore. To mark the completion of 75 years of Kannada film industry, the book has been released in New Jersey, America on 10 May 2008 sponsored by Brindavana, the Kannada Association of New Jersey. On this occasion, the author A. N. Prahalada Rao and his wife Mallika Prahlad have been honoured by the resident Kannadigas from New Jersey, New York, Washington DC and other surrounding cities.\n\nDespite the overwhelming response, the film attracted strong criticism from a section of writers. Commenting on the purpose and narrative mode of the film, the late novelist Alanahalli Krishna said, \"The film shows scant respect to the audience by showing a close-up of the hero’s footwear in the very beginning of the film. It encourages idol worship.\" On the other hand, writer U. R. Ananthamurthy said the film was deceptive and would lead the young audience believe that they too will grow rich overnight like their hero Rajiva in the film. Irrespective of the flak, the film was set to redefine the course of Kannada commercial cinema. \"Bangarada Manushya\" had drawn the audience to the cinema hall in an unprecedented manner.\n\nThe movie received following awards at 1971–72 Karnataka State Film Awards \nThe film screened at IFFI 1992 Kannada cinema Retrospect.\n\n"}

{"id": "2091495", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2091495", "title": "Nucleic acid double helix", "text": "Nucleic acid double helix\n\nIn molecular biology, the term double helix refers to the structure formed by double-stranded molecules of nucleic acids such as DNA. The double helical structure of a nucleic acid complex arises as a consequence of its secondary structure, and is a fundamental component in determining its tertiary structure. The term entered popular culture with the publication in 1968 of \"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA\" by James Watson.\n\nThe DNA double helix biopolymer of nucleic acid is held together by nucleotides which base pair together. In B-DNA, the most common double helical structure found in nature, the double helix is right-handed with about 10–10.5 base pairs per turn. The double helix structure of DNA contains a \"major groove\" and \"minor groove\". In B-DNA the major groove is wider than the minor groove. Given the difference in widths of the major groove and minor groove, many proteins which bind to B-DNA do so through the wider major groove.\n\nThe double-helix model of DNA structure was first published in the journal \"Nature\" by James Watson and Francis Crick in 1953, (X,Y,Z coordinates in 1954) based upon the crucial X-ray diffraction image of DNA labeled as \"Photo 51\", from Rosalind Franklin in 1952, followed by her more clarified DNA image with Raymond Gosling, Maurice Wilkins, Alexander Stokes, and Herbert Wilson, and base-pairing chemical and biochemical information by Erwin Chargaff. The prior model was triple-stranded DNA.\n\nThe realization that the structure of DNA is that of a double-helix elucidated the mechanism of base pairing by which genetic information is stored and copied in living organisms and is widely considered one of the most important scientific discoveries of the 20th century. Crick, Wilkins, and Watson each received one third of the 1962 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their contributions to the discovery. (Franklin, whose breakthrough X-ray diffraction data was used to formulate the DNA structure, died in 1958, and thus was ineligible to be nominated for a Nobel Prize.)\n\nHybridization is the process of complementary base pairs binding to form a double helix. Melting is the process by which the interactions between the strands of the double helix are broken, separating the two nucleic acid strands. These bonds are weak, easily separated by gentle heating, enzymes, or mechanical force. Melting occurs preferentially at certain points in the nucleic acid. \"T\" and \"A\" rich regions are more easily melted than \"C\" and \"G\" rich regions. Some base steps (pairs) are also susceptible to DNA melting, such as \"T A\" and \"T G\". These mechanical features are reflected by the use of sequences such as \"TATA\" at the start of many genes to assist RNA polymerase in melting the DNA for transcription.\n\nStrand separation by gentle heating, as used in polymerase chain reaction (PCR), is simple, providing the molecules have fewer than about 10,000 base pairs (10 kilobase pairs, or 10 kbp). The intertwining of the DNA strands makes long segments difficult to separate. The cell avoids this problem by allowing its DNA-melting enzymes (helicases) to work concurrently with topoisomerases, which can chemically cleave the phosphate backbone of one of the strands so that it can swivel around the other. Helicases unwind the strands to facilitate the advance of sequence-reading enzymes such as DNA polymerase.\n\nThe geometry of a base, or base pair step can be characterized by 6 coordinates: shift, slide, rise, tilt, roll, and twist. These values precisely define the location and orientation in space of every base or base pair in a nucleic acid molecule relative to its predecessor along the axis of the helix. Together, they characterize the helical structure of the molecule. In regions of DNA or RNA where the \"normal\" structure is disrupted, the change in these values can be used to describe such disruption.\n\nFor each base pair, considered relative to its predecessor, there are the following base pair geometries to consider:\n\n\nRise and twist determine the handedness and pitch of the helix. The other coordinates, by contrast, can be zero. Slide and shift are typically small in B-DNA, but are substantial in A- and Z-DNA. Roll and tilt make successive base pairs less parallel, and are typically small.\n\nNote that \"tilt\" has often been used differently in the scientific literature, referring to the deviation of the first, inter-strand base-pair axis from perpendicularity to the helix axis. This corresponds to slide between a succession of base pairs, and in helix-based coordinates is properly termed \"inclination\".\n\nAt least three DNA conformations are believed to be found in nature, A-DNA, B-DNA, and Z-DNA. The \"B\" form described by James Watson and Francis Crick is believed to predominate in cells. It is 23.7 Å wide and extends 34 Å per 10 bp of sequence. The double helix makes one complete turn about its axis every 10.4–10.5 base pairs in solution. This frequency of twist (termed the helical \"pitch\") depends largely on stacking forces that each base exerts on its neighbours in the chain. The absolute configuration of the bases determines the direction of the helical curve for a given conformation.\n\nA-DNA and Z-DNA differ significantly in their geometry and dimensions to B-DNA, although still form helical structures. It was long thought that the A form only occurs in dehydrated samples of DNA in the laboratory, such as those used in crystallographic experiments, and in hybrid pairings of DNA and RNA strands, but DNA dehydration does occur in vivo, and A-DNA is now known to have biological functions. Segments of DNA that cells have methylated for regulatory purposes may adopt the Z geometry, in which the strands turn about the helical axis the opposite way to A-DNA and B-DNA. There is also evidence of protein-DNA complexes forming Z-DNA structures.\nOther conformations are possible; A-DNA, B-DNA, C-DNA, E-DNA, -DNA (the enantiomeric form of -DNA), P-DNA, S-DNA, Z-DNA, etc. have been described so far. In fact, only the letters F, Q, U, V, and Y are available to describe any new DNA structure that may appear in the future. However, most of these forms have been created synthetically and have not been observed in naturally occurring biological systems. There are also triple-stranded DNA forms and quadruplex forms such as the G-quadruplex and the i-motif.\n\nTwin helical strands form the DNA backbone. Another double helix may be found by tracing the spaces, or grooves, between the strands. These voids are adjacent to the base pairs and may provide a binding site. As the strands are not directly opposite each other, the grooves are unequally sized. One groove, the major groove, is 22 Å wide and the other, the minor groove, is 12 Å wide. The narrowness of the minor groove means that the edges of the bases are more accessible in the major groove. As a result, proteins like transcription factors that can bind to specific sequences in double-stranded DNA usually make contacts to the sides of the bases exposed in the major groove. This situation varies in unusual conformations of DNA within the cell \"(see below)\", but the major and minor grooves are always named to reflect the differences in size that would be seen if the DNA is twisted back into the ordinary B form.\n\nAlternative non-helical models were briefly considered in the late 1970s as a potential solution to problems in DNA replication in plasmids and chromatin. However, the models were set aside in favor of the double-helical model due to subsequent experimental advances such as X-ray crystallography of DNA duplexes and later the nucleosome core particle, and the discovery of topoisomerases. Also, the non-double-helical models are not currently accepted by the mainstream scientific community.\n\nSingle-stranded nucleic acids (ssDNA) do not adopt a helical formation, and are described by models such as the random coil or worm-like chain.\n\nDNA is a relatively rigid polymer, typically modelled as a worm-like chain. It has three significant degrees of freedom; bending, twisting, and compression, each of which cause certain limits on what is possible with DNA within a cell. Twisting-torsional stiffness is important for the circularisation of DNA and the orientation of DNA bound proteins relative to each other and bending-axial stiffness is important for DNA wrapping and circularisation and protein interactions. Compression-extension is relatively unimportant in the absence of high tension.\n\nDNA in solution does not take a rigid structure but is continually changing conformation due to thermal vibration and collisions with water molecules, which makes classical measures of rigidity impossible to apply. Hence, the bending stiffness of DNA is measured by the persistence length, defined as:\nThis value may be directly measured using an atomic force microscope to directly image DNA molecules of various lengths. In an aqueous solution, the average persistence length is 46–50 nm or 140–150 base pairs (the diameter of DNA is 2 nm), although can vary significantly. This makes DNA a moderately stiff molecule.\n\nThe persistence length of a section of DNA is somewhat dependent on its sequence, and this can cause significant variation. The variation is largely due to base stacking energies and the residues which extend into the minor and major grooves.\n\nThe entropic flexibility of DNA is remarkably consistent with standard polymer physics models, such as the \"Kratky-Porod\" worm-like chain model. Consistent with the worm-like chain model is the observation that bending DNA is also described by Hooke's law at very small (sub-piconewton) forces. However, for DNA segments less than the persistence length, the bending force is approximately constant and behaviour deviates from the worm-like chain predictions.\n\nThis effect results in unusual ease in circularising small DNA molecules and a higher probability of finding highly bent sections of DNA.\n\nDNA molecules often have a preferred direction to bend, i.e., anisotropic bending. This is, again, due to the properties of the bases which make up the DNA sequence - a random sequence will have no preferred bend direction, i.e., isotropic bending.\n\nPreferred DNA bend direction is determined by the stability of stacking each base on top of the next. If unstable base stacking steps are always found on one side of the DNA helix then the DNA will preferentially bend away from that direction. As bend angle increases then steric hindrances and ability to roll the residues relative to each other also play a role, especially in the minor groove. \"A\" and \"T\" residues will be preferentially be found in the minor grooves on the inside of bends. This effect is particularly seen in DNA-protein binding where tight DNA bending is induced, such as in nucleosome particles. See base step distortions above.\n\nDNA molecules with exceptional bending preference can become intrinsically bent. This was first observed in trypanosomatid kinetoplast DNA. Typical sequences which cause this contain stretches of 4-6 \"T\" and \"A\" residues separated by \"G\" and \"C\" rich sections which keep the A and T residues in phase with the minor groove on one side of the molecule. For example:\nThe intrinsically bent structure is induced by the 'propeller twist' of base pairs relative to each other allowing unusual bifurcated Hydrogen-bonds between base steps. At higher temperatures this structure is denatured, and so the intrinsic bend, is lost.\n\nAll DNA which bends anisotropically has, on average, a longer persistence length and greater axial stiffness. This increased rigidity is required to prevent random bending which would make the molecule act isotropically.\n\nDNA circularization depends on both the axial (bending) stiffness and torsional (rotational) stiffness of the molecule. For a DNA molecule to successfully circularize it must be long enough to easily bend into the full circle and must have the correct number of bases so the ends are in the correct rotation to allow bonding to occur. The optimum length for circularization of DNA is around 400 base pairs (136 nm), with an integral number of turns of the DNA helix, i.e., multiples of 10.4 base pairs. Having a non integral number of turns presents a significant energy barrier for circularization, for example a 10.4 x 30 = 312 base pair molecule will circularize hundreds of times faster than 10.4 x 30.5 ≈ 317 base pair molecule.\n\nLonger stretches of DNA are entropically elastic under tension. When DNA is in solution, it undergoes continuous structural variations due to the energy available in the thermal bath of the solvent. This is due to the thermal vibration of the molecule combined with continual collisions with water molecules. For entropic reasons, more compact relaxed states are thermally accessible than stretched out states, and so DNA molecules are almost universally found in a tangled relaxed layouts. For this reason, one molecule of DNA will stretch under a force, straightening it out. Using optical tweezers, the entropic stretching behavior of DNA has been studied and analyzed from a polymer physics perspective, and it has been found that DNA behaves largely like the \"Kratky-Porod\" worm-like chain model under physiologically accessible energy scales.\n\nUnder sufficient tension and positive torque, DNA is thought to undergo a phase transition with the bases splaying outwards and the phosphates moving to the middle. This proposed structure for overstretched DNA has been called \"P-form DNA\", in honor of Linus Pauling who originally presented it as a possible structure of DNA.\n\nEvidence from mechanical stretching of DNA in the absence of imposed torque points to a transition or transitions leading to further structures which are generally referred to as \"S-form DNA\". These structures have not yet been definitively characterised due to the difficulty of carrying out atomic-resolution imaging in solution while under applied force although many computer simulation studies have been made (for example,).\n\nProposed S-DNA structures include those which preserve base-pair stacking and hydrogen bonding (GC-rich), while releasing extension by tilting, as well as structures in which partial melting of the base-stack takes place, while base-base association is nonetheless overall preserved (AT-rich).\n\nPeriodic fracture of the base-pair stack with a break occurring once per three bp (therefore one out of every three bp-bp steps) has been proposed as a regular structure which preserves planarity of the base-stacking and releases the appropriate amount of extension, with the term \"Σ-DNA\" introduced as a mnemonic, with the three right-facing points of the Sigma character serving as a reminder of the three grouped base pairs. The Σ form has been shown to have a sequence preference for GNC motifs which are believed under the GNC hypothesis to be of evolutionary importance.\n\nThe B form of the DNA helix twists 360° per 10.4-10.5 bp in the absence of torsional strain. But many molecular biological processes can induce torsional strain. A DNA segment with excess or insufficient helical twisting is referred to, respectively, as positively or negatively \"supercoiled\". DNA \"in vivo\" is typically negatively supercoiled, which facilitates the unwinding (melting) of the double-helix required for RNA transcription.\n\nWithin the cell most DNA is topologically restricted. DNA is typically found in closed loops (such as plasmids in prokaryotes) which are topologically closed, or as very long molecules whose diffusion coefficients produce effectively topologically closed domains. Linear sections of DNA are also commonly bound to proteins or physical structures (such as membranes) to form closed topological loops.\n\nFrancis Crick was one of the first to propose the importance of linking numbers when considering DNA supercoils. In a paper published in 1976, Crick outlined the problem as follows:\n\nIn considering supercoils formed by closed double-stranded molecules of DNA certain mathematical concepts, such as the linking number and the twist, are needed. The meaning of these for a closed ribbon is explained and also that of the writhing number of a closed curve. Some simple examples are given, some of which may be relevant to the structure of chromatin.\nAnalysis of DNA topology uses three values:\nAny change of T in a closed topological domain must be balanced by a change in W, and vice versa. This results in higher order structure of DNA. A circular DNA molecule with a writhe of 0 will be circular. If the twist of this molecule is subsequently increased or decreased by supercoiling then the writhe will be appropriately altered, making the molecule undergo plectonemic or toroidal superhelical coiling.\n\nWhen the ends of a piece of double stranded helical DNA are joined so that it forms a circle the strands are topologically knotted. This means the single strands cannot be separated any process that does not involve breaking a strand (such as heating). The task of un-knotting topologically linked strands of DNA falls to enzymes termed topoisomerases. These enzymes are dedicated to un-knotting circular DNA by cleaving one or both strands so that another double or single stranded segment can pass through. This un-knotting is required for the replication of circular DNA and various types of recombination in linear DNA which have similar topological constraints.\n\nFor many years, the origin of residual supercoiling in eukaryotic genomes remained unclear. This topological puzzle was referred to by some as the \"linking number paradox\". However, when experimentally determined structures of the nucleosome displayed an over-twisted left-handed wrap of DNA around the histone octamer, this \"paradox\" was considered to be solved by the scientific community.\n\n"}

{"id": "2091529", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2091529", "title": "Jerry Seinfeld (character)", "text": "Jerry Seinfeld (character)\n\nJerome \"Jerry\" Seinfeld (; ) is the title character and the main protagonist of the American television sitcom \"Seinfeld\" (1989–1998). The straight man among his group of friends, this semi-fictionalized version of comedian Jerry Seinfeld was named after, co-created by, based on, and played by Seinfeld himself. The series revolves around Jerry's misadventures with his best friend George Costanza, neighbor Cosmo Kramer, and ex-girlfriend Elaine Benes. He is usually the voice of reason amidst his friends' antics and the focal point of the relationship.\n\nAn eternal optimist, he rarely runs into major personal problems. Jerry is the only main character on the show to maintain the same career (a stand-up comedian, like the real Seinfeld) throughout the series. He is the most observational character, sarcastically commenting on his friends' quirky habits. Much of the show's action takes place in Jerry's apartment located in New York City at 129 West 81st Street, apartment 5A. He and his friends also frequently have coffee or meals together at Monk's Café.\n\nJerry appeared in all 180 episodes of \"Seinfeld\" (including several two-part episodes) and is the only character in the show to appear in every episode.\n\nIn the show's setting, Jerry is the straight man, a figure who is \"able to observe the chaos around him but not always be a part of it.\" Plot lines involving Jerry often concern his various relationships – Jerry often finds \"stupid reasons to break up\" with women; which, according to Elaine, occurs \"every week.\"\n\nJerry is generally completely indifferent to what goes on in his friends' lives, seeing their misery as merely an entertaining distraction, as well as an opportunity for joke material. He often plays along with their hare-brained schemes, even encouraging them, often just to see them fail. In the episode \"The Serenity Now\", Jerry is perplexed by his experience of crying, asking \"What is this salty discharge?\". In \"The Foundation\" Elaine points out that he has \"never felt remorse,\" to which Jerry replies, \"Yeah, I feel kinda bad about that.\" He will often nonchalantly state, \"That's a shame\" when something bad happens (often due to his or his friends' actions). A recurring joke is Jerry behaving unchivalrously towards Elaine, such as not helping her carry groceries or heavy objects, ignoring her when she is upset, and on one occasion taking a first class upgrade on a flight for himself, leaving Elaine in economy. Jerry, George and Elaine all share a general trait of not letting go of other character's remarks and going to great lengths to be proven right. In one episode, Jerry goes out of his way to rent a house in Tuscany, just because Elaine's boyfriend told him there weren't any available. Another example is when he buys his parents the same car over and over again, at great financial loss.\n\nDespite his usual indifference to his friends and their actions, Jerry apparently is very satisfied with his life, to the point that he actually feels worried about anything that might threaten the group lifestyle. In \"The Invitations\", for example, Jerry admits that he feels depressed about George getting married, seeing as how George will eventually leave the group and Jerry will never see him again. Once Elaine told him that she was also \"getting out\" of the group, Jerry became so worried about a near future of just him and Kramer that he unknowingly almost walked into a car while crossing the street. In \"The Bizarro Jerry\", Jerry also grows panicky about losing the group dynamic when Kramer becomes too busy with his fake job and Elaine temporarily leaves to join the Bizarro group, claiming that \"The whole system's breaking down!\" Jerry himself perfectly sums up his relation to his three friends in the episode \"The Letter\". In a deleted scene from that show, he claims that his friends are \"not more important\" than his girlfriends, but \"they're as important.\"\n\nUnlike George and Elaine, Jerry rarely runs into major personal problems. In \"The Opposite\", this tendency is explicitly pointed out, as Jerry goes through a number of experiences after which he invariably \"breaks even\", even as his friends are going through intense periods of success or failure. Even when Elaine threw Jerry's $20 bill out of the window, he unexpectedly found one in his coat pocket, evening out his luck. In \"The Rye\", during a particularly trying time for Elaine, she angrily tells Jerry, \"You know, one of these days, something terrible is going to happen to you. It \"has\" to!\" Jerry simply replies, \"No, I'm going to be just fine.\" Many of the problems he does run into are the result of the actions of his nemesis Newman, a disgruntled postal worker. In \"The Old Man\", George asks \"What kind of a person are you?\" in which Jerry replies \"I think I'm pretty much like you, only successful.\"\n\nHowever, Kramer persuades Jerry to do things that he's reluctant to do. In \"The Mango\", Kramer gets Jerry to buy fruit for him after Kramer is banned from the store over an argument with the owner. This continues until the owner bans Jerry, because his order is similar enough to Kramer's that it's obvious he's buying fruit for Kramer. The most famous example is in \"The Chicken Roaster\" in which Kramer and Jerry exchange apartments. This results in the two of them also switching personalities. In several arguments with Jerry, Kramer is incredibly stubborn, protecting his own interests. Examples of this include arguments in \"The Chaperone\", \"The Face Painter\" and \"The Caddy\". Probably the only exception is \"The Kiss Hello\" in which Kramer kissed Jerry as George walked in.\n\nJerry always wears a suit whenever he has to do his stand-up comedy act. In a few cases, Jerry wears an unusual item of clothing. Kramer has persuaded Jerry to wear the \"pirate shirt\" in \"The Puffy Shirt\", the cowboy boots in \"The Mom & Pop Store\" and the fur coat in \"The Reverse Peephole\". Like George, Jerry's hairstyle remains relatively the same throughout the series, though the length and thickness of it alters, especially from Season 3 onwards. There is one noticeable episode in which Jerry receives a bad haircut when he reluctantly agrees to get his hair done by an incompetent Italian barber in \"The Barber\".\n\nAs in real life, Jerry is a fan of comic book characters, particularly of Superman, who is his hero. As far as sports, Jerry is a fan of the New York Mets as evidenced as early as the episode \"The Baby Shower\" in which Kramer persuades him to install illegal cable by saying \"The Mets have 75 games on cable this year.\" Jerry is also a fan of the New York Yankees, the New York Knicks, the New York Giants, the New York Rangers, and even the Chicago Cubs. In early episodes, a New York Yankees hat sits on the counter near his computer. Later on, by the middle of Season 3, it was replaced with a Mets cap, possibly to better reflect Seinfeld's real-life support of the Queens side. While a Mets fan, he has once attended a Yankees games (in the sixth season). In the first episode of Season 6 and the first episode of Season 7, Jerry is shown watching a Yankees game with George.\n\nJerry never smokes a cigarette but is seen smoking a cigar in \"The Calzone\", \"The Wizard\" and \"The Voice\". Jerry also does not appear to have any particular interest in alcohol as he is rarely seen drinking beer or any other alcoholic beverage; however, he is seen drinking beer with George once in \"The Shower Head\", wine at various meals, and keeps a bottle of Hennigan's scotch in his apartment, though he claims that he only uses it as a paint thinner.\nHe is also seen doing a shot of Hennigans during season 3 episode 12 ‘The Red Dot’ when he is trying to lie for George's tight spending habits relating to a gift he bought for Elaine\n\nJerry and George grew up in New York City. George recalls in \"The Outing\" that the two were friends ever since an encounter in gym class in their school days. In \"The Betrayal\", Jerry mentions that he once beat George up in the fourth grade. Flashbacks in episodes such as \"The Library\" portray Jerry and George in high school. A pizza place which they frequented is portrayed in \"The Frogger\". Jerry and George attended school together at Edward R. Murrow Middle School, John F. Kennedy High School and Queens College.\n\nAfter college, Jerry briefly worked as an umbrella salesman and claims to have invented the \"twirl\" to make the umbrella look more attractive. He eventually quit the job in order to focus more on his comedy career.\n\nJerry's parents are Morty and Helen Seinfeld, a retired Jewish couple living in Florida. Unlike George, who usually can't stand his parents, Jerry gets along reasonably well with his parents, but he still prefers they live in Florida rather than New York, so that they do not interfere with his private life (a “buffer zone”). Although born and raised Jewish and he considers himself a Jew, Jerry apparently does not practice and generally does not observe many traditions. In \"The Bris\", he implies he is circumcised, repeatedly asking people if they have \"ever seen one\" - in reference to an uncircumcised penis. He also mentions having a sister in the episode \"The Chinese Restaurant\", though she is never named, never appears on screen, and is never mentioned again after this episode. In order to avoid his old friend Joel in \"Male Unbonding\", Jerry pretends to have promised to tutor his nephew; it is unclear if the nephew really exists or is simply fabricated as part of the excuse.\n\nJerry has an eccentric uncle, Leo, who appears in 15 episodes. Uncle Leo has a son, Cousin Jeffrey, who works for the parks department, about whom he constantly talks, but who never appears. In \"The Stake Out\", Jerry speaks to an \"Uncle Mac\", as well as a cousin \"Artie Levine\". In \"The Truth\", Jerry mentions a cousin named \"Douglass\" who has an addiction with Pepsi. In \"The Pony Remark\", Helen, Morty, Jerry, Elaine and Leo attend a 50th-anniversary party for Manya and Isaac, an elderly couple whose relationship to Jerry is never explicitly defined. Manya is described as a Polish immigrant. In the same episode, Jerry references having an \"Aunt Rose\", and Helen mentions a family member named \"Claire\" who is getting married. In \"The Soup\" episode, Jerry mentions an \"Aunt Silvia\", who he compares to Elaine in terms of conversation.\n\nJerry's maternal grandmother, Nana, is an elderly woman with memory problems, occasionally unable to tell the past from the present, living alone in the city. Nana makes appearances in \"The Pledge Drive\", \"The Kiss Hello\" and \"The Doodle\".\n\nJerry is notorious for his detached approach towards relationships and for breaking up with women for the slightest of flaws or for the most minor of reasons. According to the ninth-season DVD release of the series, Jerry has had 73 different girlfriends seen or alluded to over the course of the series.\n\nJerry and Elaine are depicted as having dated in the past and apparently a lot longer than they each date other people in the series. During the run of the show, they are shown mainly as best friends, sometimes even joking with one another about their failed dating relationship. However, they do date briefly during the run of the show. In \"The Deal\", they create a set of rules whereby they can sleep together but remain only friends. However, their theory is ruined when Elaine gets upset at Jerry for wanting to leave after a sexual encounter instead of sleeping over (one of the rules they discussed was that sleeping over was optional, but not whose option it was). By the end of the episode the two decide to be a couple again. Later in \"The Pen\" Jerry tells his parents that \"we decided that we don't work out as a couple.\" That is the only time in the run of the show they are shown as anything more than friends. In \"The Mango\", Jerry is upset at learning that Elaine had faked her orgasms while they were together. The fact cause such problems between the two, that Elaine agrees to sleep with Jerry in an effort to \"save the friendship\". The final scene, however, shows the two in bed, with Jerry looking distraught and gesturing towards his groin, suggesting that he was unable to perform. Elaine then asks if there is any mango left, with a stunned Jerry then taking some and successfully giving Elaine an orgasm off-screen.\n\nThere are hints throughout the series that suggest that Jerry and Elaine still have feelings for each other:\n\nOther than Elaine, Jerry has only dated a few other women for more than one episode:\n\nOnly twice in the series has Jerry considered marriage.\n\nJerry's approach to relationships is notoriously fickle, and he has broken up with women, or provoked them into breaking up with him for trivial reasons.\n\n\nLikewise, some of Jerry's girlfriends have dumped him for trivial reasons.\n\n\nIn \"The Invitations\", Jerry and his fiancée had what he described as \"the world's first truly mutual breakup\" after she acted in the same manner as him, noting \"I can't be with somebody like me. I hate myself.\"\n\nThe following celebrities starred as Jerry's girlfriend or romantic interest:\n\nJerry has a long-running hatred of Newman, describing him as his \"sworn enemy\" in \"The Andrea Doria\" and showing general contempt for him at their every meeting. Newman usually reciprocates, although at other times he seems quite pleased by Jerry's hostility, as if it is a testimony to his effectiveness at irritating him. The origin of their feud is never explained.\n\nJerry's snide greeting for him with \"Hello, Newman\" (in response to Newman's \"Hello, Jerry\") becomes a trademark of their relationship. Even Jerry's mother utters the greeting, with as much displeasure as Jerry, in \"The Raincoats, Part II\". Jerry wants to be rid of Newman so badly that he once even helped him on his postal route so that he could get a prized transfer to Hawaii (\"The Andrea Doria\").\n\nDespite their antagonistic relationship, Jerry and Newman have ended up working in unison on rare occasions. In \"The Sniffing Accountant\", Jerry worked with Kramer and Newman to find out if their accountant was on drugs. In \"The Soul Mate\", Jerry and Newman help each other with their romance problems. Newman told Jerry about Kramer's crush on his then-girlfriend, Pam, while Jerry helps Newman get a chance to date Elaine.\n\nCertain instances would even define their relationship as one of friendship, or at least mutual tolerance, built around their shared friend, Kramer. In \"The Pick\", Jerry casually walks over to Newman's apartment and brings him back to his own, to examine Elaine's Christmas card. Newman apparently puts up little fight and doesn't make any sarcastic remarks, then leaves without a confrontation. In \"The Old Man\", Jerry says \"my friends\" in reference to Kramer and Newman and in \"The Bottle Deposit\" he has no qualms about leaving Kramer and Newman alone in his apartment, trusting they'll \"keep an eye on one another.\" In \"The Barber\", Jerry allows Newman to use his bathroom, albeit reluctantly, and even watches \"Edward Scissorhands\" with him.\n\nJerry is very successful financially, and occupationally stable in comparison with his friends (and perhaps with other stand-up comedians in general). He never seems to be at a loss for money, in comparison to both George and Elaine, whose careers go through both highs and lows but are often unsuccessful or short of money. Throughout the series Jerry suffers numerous financial and material losses, but these do not seem to have long-term impacts on his situation. Examples include:\n\n\nWhile Jerry's career is successful and his opening and closing stand-up bits always go as planned, his stand-up performances depicted within the show occasionally go awry.\n\n\nJerry has an obsessive insistence on cleanliness and neatness.\n\n\nIn 2007, \"Entertainment Weekly\" placed the Jerry Seinfeld character eighth on their list of the \"50 Greatest TV icons\". For his portrayal, Jerry Seinfeld was nominated four times for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Television Series – Musical or Comedy, out of which he won one, along with being nominated five times for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series, for which he never won.\n"}

Atwill married Paula Pruter in 1944, and their marriage continued until his death. Their son, Lionel Anthony Atwill, is a retired writer.\n\nIn 1942, Atwill was indicted for perjury by a jury investigating the 1941 proceeding of a grand jury relative to the alleged occurrence of a sex orgy at his home. He was given five years probation, but Hollywood producers and other executives blacklisted him for minor criminal activity. He made small film appearances afterward.\n\nAtwill died on 22 April 1946 of lung cancer and pneumonia at his home in Pacific Palisades, Los Angeles. At the time of his death, he was filming the serial \"Lost City of the Jungle\", playing the mastermind villain. Universal Pictures retained the footage already filmed, adapted the story to enhance the villainous role of another character, and used a double for Atwill in some scenes.\n\nAtwill was born Lionel Alfred William Atwell, the oldest of four children born to Alfred and Ada Atwell His father was the only child of Thadeous Atwell, who migrated to England after being born and raised in Nassau, New Providence, Bahamas, B.W.I., the oldest of three boys born to William and Grace Atwell.

{"id": "2091547", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2091547", "title": "Mystery of the Wax Museum", "text": "Mystery of the Wax Museum\n\nMystery of the Wax Museum is a 1933 American pre-Code mystery-horror film directed by Michael Curtiz and released by Warner Bros. in two-color Technicolor. The film stars Lionel Atwill, Fay Wray, Glenda Farrell, and Frank McHugh.\n\nThis film, along with Warner's \"Doctor X\", were the last dramatic fiction films made using the two-color Technicolor process.\n\nIvan Igor (Lionel Atwill) is a sculptor who operates a wax museum in 1921 London. He gives a private tour to a friend, Dr. Rasmussen (Holmes Herbert) and an investor, Mr. Galatalin (Claude King) showing them sculptures of Joan of Arc, Voltaire, and his favorite, Marie Antoinette. Formerly a stone sculptor who did wax modeling as a hobby, he explains he turned to wax sculpting completely because he felt more \"satisfied\" that he could reproduce \"the warmth, flesh, and blood of life far better in wax than in cold stone\". Mr. Galatalin, impressed by his sculptures, offers to submit Igor's work to the Royal Academy after he returns from a trip to Egypt.\n\nUnfortunately business at the museum is failing due to people's attraction to the macabre (a nearby wax museum caters to that). Igor's partner Joe Worth (Edwin Maxwell) proposes to burn the museum down for the insurance money of £10,000. Igor will not allow such a travesty, but Worth starts a fire anyway. Igor tries to stop him and he and Worth get into a fight. As they fight, wax masterworks are melting in the flames. Worth knocks Igor unconscious, leaving the sculptor to die in the fire. Igor survives, however, and reemerges in 1933, 12 years later, in New York City, reopening a new wax museum. His hands and legs have been badly crippled in the fire and he must rely on assistants to create his new sculptures.\n\nMeanwhile, spunky reporter Florence Dempsey (Glenda Farrell), on the verge of being fired for not bringing in any worthwhile news, is sent out by her impatient editor, Jim (Frank McHugh), to investigate the suicide of a model named Joan Gale (Monica Bannister). During this time, a hideous monster steals the body of Joan Gale from the morgue. When investigators find that her body has been stolen, they suspect murder. The finger initially points to George Winton (Gavin Gordon), son of a powerful industrialist, but after visiting him in jail, Florence thinks differently.\n\nFlorence's roommate is Charlotte Duncan (Fay Wray), whose fiancé Ralph (Allen Vincent) works at Igor's new wax museum. While visiting the museum, Florence notices an uncanny resemblance between a wax figure of Joan of Arc and the dead model. At the same time, Igor spots Charlotte and remarks on her resemblance to his sculpture of Marie Antoinette.\n\nIgor employs a couple of shady characters: Professor Darcy (Arthur Edmund Carewe), a drug addict, and Hugo (Matthew Betz), a deaf-mute. Darcy also works for Joe Worth, now a bootlegger in the city, among whose customers is none other than Winton.\n\nWhile investigating an old house where Worth keeps his bootlegged alcohol, Florence discovers a monster connected with the museum, but cannot prove any connection with the disappearance of Joan Gale's body. Darcy is seen running from the house and is caught by the police. When brought to the station, he eventually breaks down and admits that Igor is, in fact, the killer and that he has been murdering people (including a missing judge whose watch was found on Darcy's person), stealing their bodies, and dipping them in wax to create lifelike sculptures.\n\nCharlotte, visiting Ralph at the museum, is trapped there by Igor, who it is revealed can still walk. When Charlotte tries to get away, she pounds away at his face, breaking a wax mask that he has made of himself, to reveal that he had been horribly disfigured. He also shows her the dead body of Joe Worth, whom Darcy had been tracking down for some time. When she faints, he straps her onto a table, intending to douse her with molten wax and make her his lost Marie Antoinette sculpture. Florence leads the police to the museum just in time: for a man supposedly crippled by fire, Igor moves with surprising speed and agility, successfully fighting off the police, but is finally gunned down. He falls into a giant vat of wax which was intended for Charlotte. Charlotte is saved when Ralph moves away from the table she is strapped to from where the wax is about to pour onto her.\n\nWhen Florence reports her story to her editor, Jim, he proposes to her. Having to choose between money (Winton) and happiness (Jim), she picks the latter.\n\nThe film is based on an unpublished short story, \"The Wax Works\", by Charles S. Belden, who had also written a play called \"The Wax Museum\", which had been optioned by Charles Rogers, an independent producer. This had been discovered by Warner's copyright attorney, but the studio optioned the story from Belden for $1,000 before getting the attorney's report. Rogers dropped his option on the play when threatened with a lawsuit from the co-author of a Broadway play with a similar plot.\n\nA follow-up to Warner's earlier horror film \"Doctor X\" (1932), \"Mystery\" involved many of the same cast and crew, including actors Lionel Atwill, Fay Wray, Arthur Edmund Carewe and Thomas Jackson; director Michael Curtiz; art director Anton Grot; and cameraman Ray Rennahan. The film also re-used \"Doctor X\"s opening theme music by Bernhard Kaun.\n\n\"Mystery of the Wax Museum\" was the last feature film under a 1931 Technicolor contract. Warner had already noted the public's apathy with the more artificial color system. Technicolor was greeted with hostility by critics and public awash in its unreal hues and humdrum quality control since 1929. The considerable additional expense of the compromised two-color spectrum, which was a fine idea when color was a novelty, was now anathema. Warners had tried without success to get Technicolor to permit them to swap out the last feature commitment for a series of shorts, but when the studio violated the contract by filming \"Doctor X\" with an additional black-and-white unit – thereby permitting them to process prints at their own lab and avoid paying Technicolor thousands of dollars – Technicolor dug in their heels and refused. Consequently, \"Mystery of the Wax Museum\" was the last studio feature using the two-color Technicolor Process 3 system. Technicolor founder Herbert Kalmus declaring it \"the ultimate that is possible with two components.\" Apparently, the combination of the two-color process with the lighting of Rennahan and the set designs of Grot created an unreal atmosphere that worked well for the film's story.\n\nThe process combined red and green dyes to create a color image with a reduced spectrum. (Technicolor would introduce their three-negative process in 1932 with \"Flowers and Trees\", cutting an exclusive deal for animation only with Walt Disney. Warner Bros. was the first to use the new process commercially for live-action on shorts like \"Service With a Smile\" in 1934).\n\nThe extremely bright light required for filming under the Technicolor process melted the wax figures, and they instead had to be played by actors. Some actors even received eye damage from the lights.\n\nUpon its release, \"Time\" magazine felt it was a good mystery film but was disappointed with the abrupt ending and lack of an explaining-it-all scene. However Mordaunt Hall of \"The New York Times\" wrote: \"It is all very well in its way to have a mad scientist performing operations in well-told stories, but when a melodrama depends upon the glimpses of covered bodies in a morgue and the stealing of some of them by an insane modeler in wax, it is going too far.\" Hall found it \"too ghastly for comfort\" – although he praised the comic performances of Glenda Farrell and Frank McHugh. The \"Variety\" reviewer said that the story was \"loose and unconvincing\" but liked the gruesome makeup and said that the film should do well at neighborhood cinemas.\n\nAt the box office, the film did better in Europe than it did in the US, but still made a profit of $80,000.\n\nAccording to Warner Bros the film earned $325,000 domestically and $781,000 foreign.\n\nThe color version of \"Mystery of the Wax Museum\" was never formally reissued and over time came to be considered a lost film. In 1936, Technicolor-Hollywood ceased servicing two-color printing after issuing a \"last call\" to their customers for prints and converting the final imbibition rig for three-color. The response of most studios was to junk the two-color negatives (which had been stored at Technicolor) of their now-obsolete films. Warner Bros. seems to have kept the negatives for only their two-color cartoons. By the late 1950s, when this film was being sold in a package for television, the Technicolor version was thought to be lost, since Technicolor discarded most of their 2-color negatives on December 28, 1948.\n\nWilliam K. Everson reported that Warner's London exchange kept a 35 mm color print on hand and that the film screened there in the late 1940s. A 35 mm nitrate copy of Reel 1, the \"lab reference\" print, was still held by Technicolor-Hollywood and screened privately in the 1960s; that reel is today in the collection of the Academy Film Archive. After the death of Jack L. Warner on September 9, 1978, a print was discovered in his personal collection. With much fanfare, the color version was screened at Grauman's Chinese Theatre in Hollywood, with Fay Wray in attendance, and then at Alice Tully Hall as part of the 8th New York Film Festival. \n\nThe Technicolor version of the film was released as an extra on the Warner Bros DVD and Blu-ray for \"House of Wax\". It was also released on Blu-ray, however it was only in standard definition.\n\nThe film was remade as \"House of Wax\" (1953), starring Vincent Price and directed by Andre De Toth. Whereas the original was more of a mystery film, the remake focused more on the horror elements. However, both films did have one unusual tendency in common: \"Mystery\" was filmed in the early two-color Technicolor process, and \"House of Wax\" showcased two other then-novel film technologies, 3-D and stereophonic sound. A wax-museum-set TV pilot, \"Chamber of Horrors\" (1966), was released as a theatrical feature and offered its own gimmick, a \"horror horn\" that would blare as the image flashed red prior to scenes of violence and murder. The horror film \"House of Wax\" (2005) was also credited as being based on the 1953 film and the same original play.\n\n\n"}

He has acted in several hit films such as \"Love Story\", \"Teri Kasam\", \n\"Star\", \"Naam,\" and \"Kaante\".\n\nHe made his film debut opposite fellow debutante actress Vijayta Pandit with \"Love Story\" (1981) which was produced by his father who also starred alongside him in the film. This film played at the box office for a long period of time; not only for its innovative story, but also its memorable music by Rahul Dev Burman and the fresh leading debutants. Many youngsters began to emulate his character in the film, produced by his father and directed by Rahul Rawail. His next film, the 1982 release \"Teri Kasam\" with actress Poonam Dhillon. That same year he starred in the musical \"Star\".\n\nHe then worked in Mahesh Bhatt's television film \"Janam\" in (1985). His understated performance in this film is still considered his career's best. In the following year he had his second box office hit with \"Naam\" (1986), again a Mahesh Bhatt film which was produced by his father and also starred his brother-in-law Sanjay Dutt in the lead role. Despite the success of \"Naam\", Gaurav's career declined as all of his subsequent films failed to do well at the box office.\n\nHaving produced his earlier films \"Janam\" and \"Naam\", his father tried to revive his career with the 1993 film \"Phool\" which had him paired with the top actress of the time Madhuri Dixit. The film also had his father and father-in-law Sunil Dutt in supporting roles. However, it didn't bring him any luck either. He then took a long break from acting and only had two delayed and completed films releasing in 1996. In 1999, he made appearances in a few television series.\n\nIn 2000, he was seen again on the big screen in the delayed release \"Gang\" which had been in production for nearly a decade due to director Mazhar Khan's ill health. In 2002, he played one of the six protagonists in the crime thriller \"Kaante\", directed by Sanjay Gupta and a remake of the American cult hit \"Reservoir Dogs\" (1992). \"Kaante\" was the third-highest-grossing film of 2002. \"Kaante\" remains his last Bollywood film to date.\n\nIn 2004, he appeared in his first American film, \"Guiana 1838\". The film tells the story of Indians arriving in the British colony of British Guiana (present-day Guyana) as indentured laborers amidst the abolition of slavery during the nineteenth century.\n\nIn 2006, he starred in the silent film \"My Daddy Strongest\".\n\n\n\n"}

It is based on Vana Tallinn liqueur with the addition of cinnamon, cardamom, anise and nutmeg.\n\n\nVana Tallinn is widely available in all of the Baltic states (Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania), as well as Ukraine, Russia and Finland. Although it is advertised as an ancient and traditional Estonian drink, the production actually started only in September 1960.\n\nUntil recently, Vana Tallinn had been only available in Europe, making it nearly impossible for anyone in the U.S. to acquire a bottle short of bringing it back from a trip. In 2007, Matrics Importing, based in Oak Lawn, Illinois, became the US importer for Vana Tallinn. Efforts were under way to establish nationwide distribution and gain broad acceptance of the product. As of 2014, Matrics Importing has discontinued the importing and distribution of Vana Tallinn anywhere in the United States, citing that the venture became cost prohibitive when the manufacturer refused to invest any money into advertising the product in the US. Currently Matrics Importing has no plans to begin re-importing Vana Tallinn. As of 2018, Vana Tallinn is imported by InterBalt Products and is available in Maryland, D.C. and Virginia where InterBalt distributes directly, as well as in 15 other states.\n\nSince 2007, Vana Tallinn has received industry recognition with a Silver Medal in the 2008 San Francisco World Spirits competition, a 94 rated review in the April 2008 edition of \"The Tasting Panel\" magazine and a Gold designation of 90 points from the Beverage Testing Institute in their 2009 International Review of Spirits which can be found on their Tastings website.\n\nLiviko introduces and distributes Vana Tallinn liqueurs among its other products in Japan since 2010 via the subsidiary Hanza Trading Co.\n\n"}
{"id": "2091559", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2091559", "title": "The Balloon Farm", "text": "The Balloon Farm\n\nThe Balloon Farm, an American musical act from New Jersey, took its name from a New York City nightclub. It is best known for its sole hit song, \"A Question of Temperature,\" which made the \"Billboard\" charts in February 1968, peaking in the top 40.\n\nTwo members of the band, Don Henny and Ed Schnug first played together in a band called Adam, which made one single for the Mala label entitled \"Eve\" in 1966. Adam's gimmick was that all four members of the group adopted the first name \"Adam\". They were probably not the first to use this idea, but they were far from the last; a similar ruse would be used by other bands, including The Donnas.\n\nAfter Adam disbanded, Henny and Schnug were joined by Mike Appel and Jay Saks and adopted the name \"The Balloon Farm\". The band's first single was \"A Question of Temperature\", which was released in October 1967. First pressings of the 45 rpm single contained a typographical error that rendered the title as \"A Question of Tempature\". Another typo, which was never fixed, was the name of the song's producer, Peter Schekeryk, which was spelled \"Shekeryk\", even after the title of the song was fixed. The single reached a peak of #37 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, and in the years since has become something of a garage-psych classic. It has appeared on numerous thematic compilations, including the Rhino box set and Acid Dreams.\n\nThe follow-up single \"Hurry Up Sundown\" flopped, and the Balloon Farm was dropped by Laurie before it was able to record an entire album. However, one of the band's unreleased songs, \"Sunshine Rides on a Trolley\" (also known as \"Sunshine Rides on a Trolley Car\"), was recorded in Australia by Robbie Snowden, who had a moderate hit with it in 1967.\n\nLater in 1968, the Balloon Farm resurfaced with yet another new name, Huck Finn, and one single on the Kapp label, \"Two of a Kind\". After that, the band broke up.\n\nThree people involved with the hit \"A Question of Temperature\" gained greater fame in the 1970s. Schekeryk would become Melanie's manager and husband. Arranger, Charlie Morrow would become internationally known for jingles including Hefty Wimpy, large scale art events like TootN Blink and New Wilderness International Solstice celebrations and, in the new millennium, the invention of MorrowSound True3D 3D audio effect. Appel, after cowriting \"Doesn't Somebody Want to Be Wanted\" and several LP cuts for The Partridge Family, would become the first manager of Bruce Springsteen.\n\n\"A Question of Temperature\" was recorded by Brownsville Station on its 1973 album \"Yeah!\", the same LP on which \"Smokin' in the Boy's Room\" appears. It was recorded in 1974 by TNT, a Harrisburg PA area garage band led by Erik Lindgren, and appears on their CD \"Mod Psych Power Pop from Central PA.\" It was recorded by several artists in the 1980s, including The Lords of the New Church on their debut album, Mindflux, Human Sexual Response, Julian Cope as a B-side to \"Charlotte Anne\" in 1988, and the Vancouver-based punk band The Young Canadians.\n"}
{"id": "2091578", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2091578", "title": "Country Life (Show of Hands album)", "text": "Country Life (Show of Hands album)\n\nCountry Life is the eleventh studio album by English acoustic roots duo Show of Hands. Released in 2003, it marks a departure for the band, with stronger socially and politically lyrics than the duo's previous albums, as well as showcasing the duo exploring a larger musical palette. Some of the album's lyrics concern rural issues which Knightley had taken to heart in previous years, including in the aftermath of their previous lyrical album \"Cold Frontier\" (2001). Prior to the release of \"Country Life\", the duo had released an instrumental album named \"The Path\". Both \"The Path\" and \"Country Life\" were released close together. The album was packaged in a lavish set which included a bonus disc of demo versions and other bonus material. The album's title track was also promoted by the band's first music video.\n\nThe album received a positive reception, with praise greeting the album from the likes of Tom Jewsbury of the BBC, Iain Hazlewood of \"Spiral Earth\", and Jane Brace of \"The Living Tradition\". \nThe album ranked at number 22 in the \"Devon's Top 50 Albums\" poll organised by BBC Radio Devon in April 2004 to find the all-time favourite albums of Devonians. The duo toured in support of the album from 2003–2005.\n\nAfter completing and releasing their eighth studio album \"Cold Frontier\" (2001), Show of Hands embarked on a nationwide tour in which they played a great deal of unreleased or \"rare\" material. The band's live album \"Cold Cuts\" (2002) was drawn from material from the tour. The tour coincided with the start of writing material for the album. Both the recording of \"Cold Frontier\" and the subsequent tour were in an era of several social and political concerns for Knightley, culminating in the more \"heavy\" lyrics that landed on the album. With a focus on rural issues, Steve Knightley of the duo named the album \"Country Life\". The duo had been commissioned by the National Trust and English Heritage to record an instrumental album to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the South West Coast Path. The resulting album, \"The Path\" (2003), was quickly recorded as the duo were preparing for their next canonical album. As such, the duo entered a busy in period in which they were working on two albums. \"The Path\" was released on 14 April 2003, by which point \"Country Life\" had been recorded at Riverside Studios in Exeter in the early part of 2003. The album was co-produced between Mick Dolan and the duo.\n\nAt the time of release, Jane Brace of \"Living Tradition\" described \"Country Life\" as the duo's \"most ambitious, exciting and keenly awaited project to date\". Iain Hazlewood of \"Spiral Earth\" noted \"the diversity of musical style, mood and pace on the album is always held in control; as an album it is totally cohesive - nothing unbalances it,\" and noted the album incorporates elements of Celtic, Spanish, South American, rock and blues, but also that despite this, \"they don't fall into the trap of creating 'world' music that isn't rooted to any real place or time. Their place is the West Country and South West of England, their time is anytime they damn well like.\" Tom Jewsbury of the BBC said the duo \"steer ever closer to the mainstream market with this latest studio album. All the usual SOH ingredients are present: soulful vocals, accomplished instrumentation, excellent production, original compositions featuring politically-charged lyrics, the occasional nod to the tradition.\"\n\nThe album contains ten songs written by Steve Knightley, as well as the duo's arrangements of two traditional folk songs and Kelly Joe Phelps's \"Tommy\", the latter being a \"raw tale of schizophrenia\" about \"a misfit\" and featuring Phil Beer's \"unusual voice\". The title track and album opener, \"Country Life\", is a \"stirring\" and \"finely honed rant about the desecration of British country life\" and \"an acerbic indictment of modern values\". Inspired by the 2001 United Kingdom foot-and-mouth outbreak, it became something of a break-though\nrecording for the band that has brought their work to a wider audience. The song\nexamines rural poverty and social exclusion from the experiences of an extended family, and was partly born from Knightley's frustration that English rural areas lacked a meaningful musical voice. Steve Knightley had commented that “cities in England have got their voices … The only countryside music bordered on a joke, like the Wurzels.\" Nonetheless, Knightley does not claim to speak for rural people or to be\npresenting an \"authentic‟ rural voice, with the story told by the particular character of an angry young man.\nThe album's mood changes quickly on the second track, \"Hard Shoulder\", a song about a long-standing friendship. The song was described as \"soaked through with the poignancy of hindsight and memory.\" \"Hard Shoulder\" is followed by \"Suntrap\", featuring Spanish guitar playing from Beer, and the poignant and gentle \"Smile She Said\", which tells of the journey of a relationship in five \"exposures\". Following this is the traditional song \"Reynardine\" which music written by Knightley. The song also features Knightley's hallmark finger drumming, this time on the cuatro, which he was taught by exiled Chilean musician Vladamir Vega during their time in Alianza in 1991. The track an unusual pulsating treatment. Knightley's singing on the ballad \"Seven Days\" is accompanied by young West Country singer Jenna Witts, with whom Knightley and Seth Lakeman recorded the album \"Western Approaches\" with the following year. Following the aforementioned cover of \"Tommy\" are the \"jaunty\" song \"Be Lucky\", the traditional folk song \"Adieu Sweet Lovely Nancy\" which again features Beer on vocals, and had originally been recorded by the duo with Alianza in 1991, and the \"gentle\" song \"I Promise You\". Before the album closer \"Don't Be a Stranger\", which was a former concert closer for the duo, is the upbeat \"Red Diesel\", about Terry, \"the kind of guy that modern society doesn't really have much time for\". The track features Knightley's mandocello and Beer's mandolin forming a \"foot tapping\" rhythm. Terry is a minor criminal who complains that \"there ought to be a law for keeping out the yuppies and the grockles\".\n\n\"Country Life\" was commercially released 20 October 2003 on the band's own label Hands on Music with the catalogue number HMCD19, but had already been sold at the duo's concerts since the middle of the year. The album was released as a double disc set, with the album on the first disc (subtitled \"The Album\"), and a bonus disc entitled \"The Demos\", which contained demo versions of the album's songs \"Country Life\", \"Hard Shoulder\" and \"I Promise You\". The bonus disc also contained other CD-ROM bonus material, namely the music videos for \"Country Life\" and their older song \"The Train\", a photo slideshow set to \"I Promise You\", a lyrics section set to \"The Exe Estuary\" from their previous album \"The Path\", live footage from their 2001 performance at the Royal Albert Hall and a downloadable screensaver. The bonus disc prompted the BBC to say the album was \"lavishly packaged\". Although no singles were released from the album, the title track had a music video produced for it.\n\nHelped to be promoted by a tour in 2003, including a performance at the Trowbridge Village Pump Festival where copies of the album was signed, the album was released to a positive critical reception. Tom Jewsbury of the BBC said the album would \"have SOH's mighty fan base in seventh heaven.\" Iain Hazlewood of \"Spiral Earth\" said that \"\"Country Life\" is one of their defining moments\" and \"a deceptively complex album, repeated listening reveals a musical and emotional depth that just picks you up and runs off with your imagination. Jane Brace of \"The Living Tradition\" said she had \"racked [her] brains for a way to describe this band and failed. And therein lies the 'riddle' of Show of Hands. Just when you think you've got a handle on them and decided it's 'acoustic with attitude' or out and out English folk they'll throw in some rock, shades of country, a reel of Celtic, a bit of bluegrass and then recreate the sitar sounds of India in the blink of an eye. They are without a doubt the coolest chameleons I've seen. and the release of \"Country Life\" proves they just get better and better. David Kidman of \"NetRhythms\" said the album is \"another excellent product all round. Probably Show Of Hands' best\". He commented that the album \"gives us the best of all of SOH's various worlds.\" Bradley Torreano of Allmusic later noted that the album \"was well-received by plaudits and fans alike.\"\n\nIn April 2004, less than a year after the album's release, it was ranked at number 22 in the \"Devon's Top 50 Albums\" online poll organised by BBC Radio Devon which listed the all-time favourite albums of participating Devonians. The album was the only album on the list by a Devonian artist, and its inclusion surprised Nick Southall of Stylus Magazine, who had not heard of the duo. Touring the album throughout 2003−2005, they won the BBC Radio 2 Folk Award for Best Live Act in 2004. \nThe award was decided by a public vote. Singer and double bass player Miranda Sykes joined them on their Autumn Tour 2004, which spawned the live album \"As You Were\" (2005). The title track of \"Country Life\" has continued to be played live by the band, it was nominated for \"Best Original Song\" at the BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards 2005, and featured on the corresponding compilation album. The song became something of a breakthrough recording for the band, bringing them a wider audience. Two songs from the album appear on the band's best-of retrospective compilation album \"\" (2007), namely \"Country Life\" and \"Cold Frontier\".\n\nAll songs written by Steve Knightley, except where noted.\n\n\nMany copies come with a bonus 'promo disc' which features demo versions to three of the songs on the album.\n\n"}

She is best known for her feature films \"Brothers\", \"After the Wedding,\" \"In a Better World\", and \"Bird Box\", and the TV miniseries \"The Night Manager\".\nBier is the first female director to win a Golden Globe, an Emmy Award, and a European Film Award, collectively.\n\nSusanne Bier was born to a Jewish family in Copenhagen, Denmark on 15 April 1960. The family of her father, Rudolf Salomon Baer (born 1930), emigrated from Germany to Denmark in 1933 after Hitler's rise to power. The family of her mother, Heni (née Jonas; born 1936), emigrated to Denmark from Russia at the beginning of the 20th century, to escape rising anti-semitism. In 1943, the two families fled from Denmark to Sweden, together with most Danish Jews, to escape the deportation to the Nazi death camps. Three years after the end of World War II, they returned to Denmark. The effects of the Holocaust caused Bier's parents to instill the strong moral values and principles into their children. Later, the importance of human resilience and dignity would be a recurring theme in her films.\n\nDuring her schooling, she went to Niels Steensens Gymnasium. In interviews for the media as an adult, Bier describes herself as lacking in social skills as a child, who liked to play football with boys and preferred to read books to interacting with others. After high school, citing a desire to reconnect with her Jewish roots, she studied art at the Bezalel Academy of Arts and Design in Jerusalem. Later she would study architecture at the Architectural Association in London before finally returning to film and graduating from the National Film School of Denmark in 1987. \"De Saliges\" (1987), Bier's graduation film, won first prize at the Munich film school festival and was subsequently distributed by Channel Four.\n\nAfter directing music videos, commercials and the feature films \"Freud Flytter Hjemmefra\" (\"Freud's Leaving Home\", 1990), \"Det Bli'r i Familien\" (\"Family Matters\", 1993), \"Pensionat Oscar\" (\"Like it Was Never Before\", 1995) and \"Sekten\" (\"Credo\", 1997), Bier made a breakthrough in her home country of Denmark with the film \"The One and Only\" in 1999. A romantic comedy about the fragility of life, the film won a clutch of Danish Film Academy awards and established Bier's relationship with actress Paprika Steen. The film remains one of the most successful domestic films ever released in Denmark.\n\nA sidestep from the easy going charm of \"Livet är en schlager\" (\"Once in a Lifetime\", 2000), \"Elsker dig for evigt\" (\"Open Hearts\", 2002) brought Bier's work to much wider international attention and acclaim. Acutely observed and beautifully written by Bier and Anders Thomas Jensen, the film is a perceptive and painful exploration of broken lives and interconnected tragedies. Made under Dogme 95 regulations, the film also marked a move towards a more minimalist aesthetic.\n\nSince the completion of \"Open Hearts\", Bier's reputation has continued to ascend with the harrowing \"Brødre\" (\"Brothers\", 2004) and the emotionally engaging \"Efter Brylluppet\" (\"After the Wedding\", 2006), which was nominated for Best Foreign Language film at the 2007 Academy Awards. After her first American film, \"Things We Lost in the Fire\" (2008) starring Benicio del Toro and Halle Berry, Bier went on to win the Oscar for Best Foreign Language film for \"In a Better World\" (2010).\n\nIn 2012, she returned to romantic comedy with local Danish smash-hit \"Den skaldede frisør\" (\"Love is All You Need\") (2012) starring Trine Dyrholm and Pierce Brosnan. And in 2014, she directed her second American feature, dark romantic drama Serena starring Jennifer Lawrence and Bradley Cooper, and shortly after followed up with Danish drama \"A Second Chance\" starring Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, Ulrich Thomsen, Nikolaj Lie Kaas and Maria Bonnevie.\n\nAlso a maker of shorts, music videos and commercials, Bier's films typically meditate on pain, tragedy, and atonement.\n\nIn 2013 she was a member of the jury at the 63rd Berlin International Film Festival.\n\nAfter graduation, Bier was invited to Sweden to direct \"Freud's Leaving Home\", which was critically acclaimed by film critics. The film follows a girl, Freud, from Sweden who comes from a Jewish family, and it became the first feature film in Sweden to depict Swedish-Jewish culture. With its heavily Jewish focus, the film \"addresses the Jewish experience to an extent that is in rare in Scandinavian cinema\". The film won ten awards and was nominated for an additional three.\n\nHer next film \"Family Matters\" continued exploration of complex, tabooed family relations begun in \"Freud's Leaving Home\", including an incestuous relationship between brother and sister.\n\nBier returned to taboo subjects with the film \"The One and Only\" in 1999. The film is a Danish romantic comedy starring Sidse Babett Knudsen, Niels Olsen, Rafael Edholm, and Paprika Steen in a story about two unfaithful married couples faced with becoming first-time parents. The film was considered to mark a modern transition in Danish romantic comedies, The film earned both the Robert Award and Bodil Award as the Best Film of 1999.\n\nFollowing the influence of Dogme 95 manifesto, Bier directed the film \"Open Hearts\" in 2002. \"Open Hearts\" tells the story of two couples whose lives are traumatized by a car crash and adultery.\n\n\"Open Hearts\" received a 96% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes movie review website. Susanne Bier received the International Critics Award at the 2002 Toronto International Film Festival \"for the fact that it proves that Dogma has come of age and matured into a potent cinematic language that skillfully captures the freeing of real emotions that extreme trauma creates within the lives of the characters in her film.\" The film won both the Bodil and Robert awards for Best Danish Film in 2003.\n\nIn Bier's next film we follow the character of Michael who has a dream life, a promising military career, a beautiful wife and two beautiful girls. His younger brother, Jannik is a little thug, an outlaw. When Michael has to go to Afghanistan for a UN mission, the relationship between the two brothers is tense. During his trip, Michael is missing, presumed dead. Sarah is supported by Jannik who, against all odds, takes care of the family. Soon, Sarah and Jannik get closer and become lovers. The film tackles the theme of the war in Afghanistan in 2001 and the psychological aftermath of prisoners of war. The plot shows inspiration from Homer's \"Odyssey\". It won several awards, including the audience award at the 2005 Sundance Film Festival and the Cannes Film Festival UCMF Movie Music Award. An opera based on the story of the film by Icelandic composer Daníel Bjarnason was premiered in Aarhus on 16 August 2017. It was commissioned by Den Jyske Opera. Kerstin Perski wrote the libretto and the director was Kasper Holten. To celebrate Aarhus as the European capital of culture 2017 three stage works were produced; a musical, dance and an opera all based on films by Bier were commissioned and performed in Musikhuset.\n\nBier's next film tells the story of Jacob Petersen who manages an Indian orphanage. With a small staff, he works as hard as he can to keep the orphanage afloat and is personally invested in the young charges - in particular, Pramod, a young boy Jacob has cared for since the boy's birth. The film was a critical and popular success and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film.\n\n\"Time\" magazine's Richard Schickel named the film one of the Top 10 Movies of 2007, ranking it at #4, calling it a \"dark, richly mounted film\". While Schickel saw the film as possibly \"old-fashioned stylistically, and rather manipulative in its plotting\", he also saw \"something deeply satisfying in the way it works out the fates of its troubled, yet believable characters.\"\n\nIn this film we follow the character of Audrey who has been married for eleven years with Brian and leads a well-to-do life, but suddenly her husband dies after trying to defend a woman from an assault. Left alone with two children, Audrey has to face the terrible pain of loss, so she decides to welcome Jerry, her friend's friend, with problems of drug addiction. The two will establish a relationship that will force them to unite their pains, helping each other to make a change in their lives, the difficult search for happiness.\n\nCritics gave the film generally favorable reviews. As of 29 January 2008 on the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, 64% of critics gave the film positive reviews, based on 117 reviews. On Metacritic, the film had an average score of 63 out of 100, based on 30 reviews. The two leads received praise for their performances, particularly Benicio Del Toro as he received immense acclaim for his portrayal of Jerry, considered one of his best roles to date.\n\n\"In a Better World\" (, \"the revenge\") is a 2010 Danish drama thriller film written by Anders Thomas Jensen and directed by Susanne Bier. The film stars Mikael Persbrandt, Trine Dyrholm, and Ulrich Thomsen in a story which takes place in small-town Denmark and a refugee camp in Africa.\n\nA Danish majority production with co-producers in Sweden, \"In a Better World\" won the 2011 Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film as well as the award for Best Foreign Language Film at the 83rd Academy Awards.\n\nDirector Susanne Bier said: \"Our experiment in this film is about looking at how little it really takes before a child – or an adult – thinks something is deeply unjust. It really doesn't take much, and I find that profoundly interesting. And scary.\"\n\nReview aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that 77% out of 114 professional critics gave the film a positive review, with the site consensus stating that \"\"In a Better World\" is a sumptuous melodrama that tackles some rather difficult existential and human themes.\" Critical aggregator Metacritic gave the film a Metascore of 65, indicating \"generally favorable reviews.\"\n\nKim Skotte called the film a \"powerful and captivating drama\" in \"Politiken\". Out of the four collaborations between Jensen and Bier, he considered \"In a Better World\" to be the one most similar to Jensen's solo films and compared the combination of biblical themes and high entertainment value to Jensen's 2005 film \"Adam's Apples\". Peter Nielsen of \"Dagbladet Information\" called \"In a Better World\" \"in all ways a successful film\", and although there \"is no doubt that Susanne Bier can tell a good story\", he was not entirely convinced: \"She can seduce, and she can push the completely correct emotional buttons, so that mothers' as well as fathers' hearts are struck, but she doesn't earnestly drill her probe into the meat.\"\n\nIn 2012, Bier directed \"Love Is All You Need\" (\"Den skaldede frisør\"), Lit.: The Bald Hairdresser) a 2012 Danish romantic comedy film starring Pierce Brosnan and Trine Dyrholm.\n\nIn 2013, \"Love Is All You Need\" was selected as best comedy film at the 26th European Film Awards.\n\nBier directed \"Serena\" is a 2014 American–French drama film based on the 2008 novel of the same name by American author Ron Rash. The film stars Jennifer Lawrence and Bradley Cooper as newlyweds running a timber business in 1930s North Carolina.\n\n\"Serena\" has received negative reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a score of 16% based on 106 reviews with an average rating of 4.3/10. The website's critical consensus states \"\"Serena\" unites an impressive array of talent on either side of the cameras – then leaves viewers to wonder how it all went so wrong.\" On Metacritic the film has a score of 36 out of 100 based on reviews from 29 critics, indicating \"generally unfavorable reviews\".\n\nIn 2014, Bier directed \"A Second Chance\" (), a Danish thriller film. The film stars Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, Ulrich Thomsen, Maria Bonnevie, Nikolaj Lie Kaas and Lykke May Andersen. It was screened in the Special Presentations section of the 2014 Toronto International Film Festival.\n\nTaking a break from film, Bier directed \"The Night Manager\", a British television serial starring Tom Hiddleston, Hugh Laurie, Olivia Colman, David Harewood, Tom Hollander, and Elizabeth Debicki. It is based on the 1993 novel of the same name by John le Carré and adapted to the present day by David Farr. The six-part series began broadcasting on BBC One on 21 February 2016. In the United States, it began on 19 April 2016 on AMC. It has been sold internationally to over 180 countries, and a second series was commissioned by the BBC and AMC. Scripting duties for the second series were handled by Matthew Orton, Charles Cumming, Namsi Khan and Francesca Gardiner.\n\nThe first series of \"The Night Manager\" was nominated for 36 awards and won 11, including two Emmy Awards for director Susanne Bier and music composer Victor Reyes and three Golden Globes for Best Performance to Tom Hiddleston, Best Performance for an Actress in a Supporting Role to Olivia Colman, and Best Performance for a Supporting Actor for Hugh Laurie.\n\nThe series received widespread critical acclaim. Adam Sisman, le Carré's biographer, wrote in UK daily newspaper \"The Daily Telegraph\", \"It is more than 20 years since the novel was published, and in that time two film companies have tried and failed to adapt it, concluding that it was impossible to compress into two hours. But this six-hour television adaptation is long enough to give the novel its due.\" He added, \"And though Hugh Laurie may seem a surprising choice to play 'the worst man in the world', he dominates the screen as a horribly convincing villain. Alert viewers may spot a familiar face in the background of one scene, in a restaurant: John le Carré himself makes a cameo, as he did in the films of \"A Most Wanted Man\" and \"Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy\". But he is on screen only for an instant: blink and you'll miss him.\"\n\nReturning to film, Bier directed \"Bird Box\", an American post-apocalyptic horror film. The screenplay, by Eric Heisserer, was based on the 2014 novel of the same name by Josh Malerman. The film stars Sandra Bullock, and had its world premiere at AFI Fest on 12 November 2018. It was released worldwide on 21 December 2018 by Netflix.\n\nOn Metacritic, \"Bird Box\" has received mixed to positive reviews. \"Forbes\" called it a \"truly terrible movie.\"\n\nBier has been praised as being a director capable of making films that appeal to an international market, especially since \"After the Wedding\" (2006) was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film and \"In a Better World\" (2010) went on to win the award in 2011. The international TV miniseries \"The Night Manager\" (2016), produced by BBC and AMC, received worldwide acclaim upon its premiere as well. It went on to receive 12 Primetime Emmy Awards nominations, winning one for Susanne Bier's directing efforts and four Golden Globe-nominations and three wins.\n\nBier's films often deal with the traditional family framework, with the collapse of the bourgeois middle class under the pressure of globalization, terrorism, and war, and the way in which people deal with a disaster or a formative event outside their lives. She notes that the moment that interests her in characters' lives is when their sense of security cracks and the outside world knocks on the door. The main questions in her films are questions of morality: whether it is moral to leave a partner who has become disabled, whether personal good precedes the general good, and how to respond to the violence directed at the individual. Bier often raises questions about how far one would go for a child is in distress, if social services appear to be unable or unwilling to help, and the limits one exceeds to get their own desires fulfilled.\n\nBier's style of direction gives the players a great deal of freedom, allowing improvisation in both texts and presentation. Her films have a common visual code - all of them are filmed in a shoulder camera, and emotional peaks use extreme close-ups of eyes, lips, and fingers. In addition, the editing method is not faithful to the continuous editing tradition, and it adds to a more free and random feeling.\n\nBier's films are characterized by the fact that, despite their tragic structure, there is a \"flattening\" of the dramatic events, or, alternatively, no dramatization of the major events. For example, in the scene of the first encounter between the father and his daughter in \"After the Wedding\", the two of them are silent for most of the scene, and talk about a bottle of water he brings to her. This style of direction creates the feeling that nothing happens in her films, but a thorough analysis of the events shows that the films are faithful to the dramatic structure of the Theatre of ancient Greece.\n\nMoreover, Bier makes sure to finish her films with a slightly optimistic tone, saying that although her films are not purely commercial, they are also not pure art, and therefore she should communicate with her audience and give them some light to lean on.\n\nIn Susan King's article, Bier claims her Jewish heritage embedded a strong sense of family in conjunction to a sense of instability and turmoil. This pertains to her father's need to flee Germany in 1933 to Denmark, where he met Bier's mother. The two of them fled by boat to Sweden after Nazis began rounding up Jews in Denmark. Originally, Bier imagined herself married to a nice Jewish man with six children. She later decided that she wanted to pursue a career. She has been married twice and has two children, Gabriel and Alice. Despite this, she still holds family as her biggest influence and claims she would have never become a filmmaker without her children. To Bier, \"family is a sense of identity\". \"I speak to my parents every day. I have a very close relationship to my aunts and uncles, but also my ex-husband…who comes to stay with us. I have this almost obsessive desire to whomever is close to me, I want to have a very intense, close, intimate relationship with them. That way of living definitely informs the stories I tell.”Although she frequently depicts international stories in third world countries, Bier had never been to Africa or India until she started making movies there. On her frequent interest and depiction of the Third World, Bier insists that \"it is sort of pointing out that the Third World is really a part of our lives. It is unavoidable, and we need to relate to it…\" As she writes in a public letter after winning the Oscar for \"In a Better World\", \"My particular world is not just Copenhagen. It had to be broader than this. My world is larger than it used to be.\" In Sylvaine Gold's article, Bier claims she doesn't like to be in a state of comfort when working. Typically in her films, happy and comfortable characters are met by situations of extreme sadness and catastrophe. She attributes this obsession to her parents experience during World War II when “society suddenly turned against them” because they were Jewish. Despite this obsession with tragedy, Bier says “I've had a very fortunate, very privileged life [but] I say that with all humility, because it could change tomorrow. But I have a very strong ability to empathize, to understand what things feel like.\" Her frequent writing collaborator Anders Thomas Jensen confirms this \"humanness\" in her, that \"She's very good at putting herself in a character's place, which is really a gift.\" Bier also insists that despite her negative depictions in her films, she always wants to end a film with some vestige of hope. She never wants to alienate her audience, that it is always key to \"have an ability to communicate\".\n\nBier was married to Swedish actor and director Philip Zanden. After her divorce from Zanden, she met her current partner, the Danish singer and composer Jasper Wenga Leisner, who wrote the music for several of her films. Bier has two children, both with Zanden, Gabriel (born in 1989) and Alice Esther (born in 1995).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

But this title was firstly used by Sultan of Delhi Sultanate in Persian context.\n\nAs with various other laudatory titles of Semitic origin, such as \"King of Kings\", Sultan of Sultans can express a claim of imperial rank up to and including universal legitimate sovereignty. Although the notion and title of an emperor is largely alien to Islamic tradition, the Ottoman dynasty, which employed the title of \"Sultan of Sultans\" in its official full style, had perhaps the best claim to usage due to its territorial extent and great length. The Ottomans also adopted the traditional Byzantine imperial title \"Caesar\" for their own ruler (the Padishah).\n\nThe Sultans of Delhi Sultanate used this title to signify their rule over entire Indian subcontinent as hundred of Indian Rajas (Prince) ruled under their suzerainty. But they also considered themselves beneath the Caliph however they were independent.\n\nThe title has also been appropriated for local use by various regional Muslim rulers, especially in Bengal Sultanate.\n\nThe Shahanshah (Persian for \"King of Kings\") of Iran also claimed, with slightly less legitimacy, to be the \"Sultan of Sultans\".

{"id": "2091599", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2091599", "title": "Ishmaelites", "text": "Ishmaelites\n\nAccording to the Book of Genesis, Ishmaelites (Hebrew: \"Bnai Yishma'el\" Arabic: \"Bani Isma'il\", ) are the descendants of Ishmael, the elder son of Abraham and the descendants of the twelve sons and princes of Ishmael.\n\nThroughout history, the Ishmaelites have been associated with Arabs (more specifically, North Arabians). Indeed, two prominent North Arabian tribes, the Qedarites and Nabateans, have names corresponding to two of Ishmael's sons. The original sequence of events, who called whom which name first and how this relates to the tradition of Abraham as a patriarch and forefather is unclear.\n\nEven today, many call upon Ishmael as their people's ancestor, notably Muslim Arabs.\n\nAccording to the Book of Genesis, Abraham's first wife was named Sarah and her Egyptian slave was named Hagar. However Sarah could not conceive. In chapter 16 Sarah (then Sarai) gave her slave Hagar in marriage to Abraham, in order that Abraham might have an heir.\n\nHagar conceived Ishmael from Abraham, and the Ishmaelites descend from him.\nAfter Abraham pleaded with God for Ishmael to live under his blessing, chapter 17 states:\n\nChapter 25 lists his sons as:\n\nThe Samaritan book Asaṭīr adds:\n\nJosephus also lists the sons and states that they \"...inhabit the lands which are between Euphrates and the Red Sea, the name of which country is Nabathæa.)\" \n\nThe Targum Onkelos annotates Genesis 25:16, describing the extent of their settlements: \"And they dwelt from Hindekaia unto Chalutsa, which is by the side of Mizraim, from thy going up towards Arthur.\" \n\n\"Allah has gifted all of Ishmael, Elisha, Jonah and Lot a favour above the nations.\nWith some of their forefathers and their offspring and their brethren; and We chose them and guided them unto a straight path\".\n\nThe 14th century \"Kebra Nagast\" says \"And therefore the children of \"Ishmael\" became kings over \"Tereb\", and over \"Kebet\", and over \"Nôbâ\", and \"Sôba\", and \"Kuergue\", and \"Kîfî\", and \"Mâkâ\", and \"Môrnâ\", and \"Fînḳânâ\", and \"’Arsîbânâ\", and \"Lîbâ\", and \"Mase'a\", for they were the seed of \"Shem\".\" \n\nAssyrian and Babylonian royal inscriptions and North Arabian inscriptions from 9th to 6th century BC, mention the king of Qedar. Of the names of the sons of Ishmael the names \"Nabat, Kedar, Abdeel, Dumah, Massa, and Teman\" were mentioned in the Assyrian royal inscriptions as Arabian tribes. Jesur was mentioned in Greek inscriptions in the First Century BC.\n\nThe Qedarite Kingdom continued long after the demise of the last native Babylonian king Nabonidus, but the Nabataean Kingdom emerged from the Qedarite kingdom because of the continuity in geography and language between the two tribes some two hundred and fifty years later.\nMany Arabic tribes names of the time of Muhammad (and now) such as Asad, Madhhij, and the ancestor tribes of Muhammad: Ma'ad and Nizar were found in the Namara inscription dated 325 AD in the Nabatean script.\n\nMedieval Arab genealogists divided Arabs into three groups:\n\nAbu Ja'far al-Baqir (676–743 AD) wrote that his father Ali ibn Husayn informed him that prophet Muhammad had said: \"The first whose tongue spoke in clear Arabic was Ishmael, when he was fourteen years old.\" Hisham Ibn Muhammad al-Kalbi (737–819 AD) established a genealogical link between Ishmael and Muhammad using writings and the ancient oral traditions of the Arabs. His book, \"Jamharat al-Nasab\" (\"The Abundance of Kinship\"), seems to posit that the people known as 'Arabs' (of his time) were all descendants of Ishmael. Ibn Kathir (1301–1373) writes, \"All the Arabs of the Hijaz are descendants of Nebaioth and Qedar.\" Medieval Jewish sources also usually identified Qedar with Arabs and Muslims. According to author and scholar Irfan Shahîd, while Western scholars viewed this kind of \"genealogical Ishmaelism\" with suspicion, the concept can be supported, Genealogical Ishmaelism was viewed with suspicion as a late Islamic fabrication because of the confusion in Islamic times which made it such a capacious term as to include the inhabitants of the south as well as the north of the Arabian Peninsula. But short of this extravagance, the concept is much more modest in its denotation, and in the sober sources it applies only to certain groups among the Arabs of pre-Islamic times. Some important statements to this effect were made by Muhammad when he identified some Arabs as Ishmaelites and others as not. Ishmaelism in this more limited definition holds that Ishmael was both an important religious figure and eponymous ancestor for some of the Arabs of western Arabia. Prominence is given in Arab genealogical accounts to the first two of Ishmael's twelve sons, Nebaioth (, \"Nabīt\") and Qedar (, \"Qaydār\"), who are also prominently featured in the Genesis account. It is likely that they and their tribes lived in northwestern Arabia and were historically the most important of the twelve Ishmaelite tribes.\n\nIt is believed that the first person to speak Arabic clearly was Ishmael from Greek literature sources:\n\"Isma’il grew up among the Jurhum an Arabic speaking tribe, learning the pure Arabic tongue from them. When grown up he successively married two ladies from the Jurhum tribe, the second wife being the daughter of Mudad ibn ‘Amr, leader of the Jurhum tribe.\"\n\nIn accounts tracing the ancestry of Muhammad back to Ma'ad (and from there to Adam), Arab scholars alternate, with some citing the line as through Nebaioth, others Qedar. Many Muslim scholars see \"Isaiah 42\" (\"21:13-17\") as predicting the coming of a servant of God who is associated with Qedar and interpret this as a reference to Muhammad.\n\n\n"}

In his day, Semon was considered a major movie comedian, but he is now remembered mainly for working with both Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy before they started working together.\n\nHe is also sometimes noted for directing (as well as appearing in) the 1925 silent film \"The Wizard of Oz\", which had a slight influence on the better-known 1939 talkie \"The Wizard of Oz\" released by MGM. The film was included in the 2005 three-disc DVD version of the 1939 film, along with other silent \"Oz\" movies.\n\nBorn in West Point, Mississippi, Semon was the son of a travelling Jewish vaudeville magician Zerubavel Semon, who billed himself as \"Zera the Great\". His mother, Irene Semon (née Rea) worked as his assistant. Along with his older sister, Semon joined his parents' act until his father's death. After completing his education in Savannah, Georgia, Semon moved to New York City, where he worked for \"The New York Sun\" and later \"The New York Morning Telegraph\" as a cartoonist, comics artist and graphic artist. While working as an artist, Semon appeared in monologues in vaudeville, where he attracted the attention of Vitagraph Studios. In 1915, he was offered a contract with the company.\n\nAfter signing with Vitagraph, Semon worked behind the scenes as a scenario writer, director, and film producer for actor Hughie Mack's films. He occasionally cast himself in bit parts in the films he worked on. When Mack left Vitagraph, Semon began playing the lead roles. He usually played a white-faced goof in derby hat and overalls who would enter any given setting (a bakery, a restaurant, a construction site, a prison camp, etc.) and cause chaos, with people being covered with debris and property being destroyed. His short slapstick comedies were made and released quickly and prolifically, making Semon very familiar to moviegoers.\n\nAs his fame grew, his films expanded from one reel (about 12 minutes) to two reels, and Semon was given a free hand in making them. This became a dangerous policy because Semon became notorious for being expensive and extravagant: his two-reel comedies could easily cost more than an average five-reel feature film. As a former cartoonist, Semon staged similarly cartoony sight gags, using elaborate special effects. No gag was too big for Semon. He loved chase sequences involving airplanes (sometimes using three in a film), exploding barns, falling water towers, auto wrecks and/or explosions, and liberal use of substances in which to douse people. A typical Semon comedy might involve barrels of flour, sacks of soot, gallons of ink, gobs of jam, or pits filled with mud. For example, in Semon's \"The Bell Hop\", a man sleeping under the spray of a malfunctioning fountain imagines he is swimming in the ocean, and in his sleep he dives off the bed, through the floor, and into a vat of paint in the lobby below. Oliver Hardy recalled in an interview that Semon, when staging his comedy short \"The Sawmill\" in a lumber camp, would not use traditional, painted stage sets. Instead, Semon insisted on building permanent log cabins complete with modern conveniences. The production budget soared, and his bosses at Vitagraph finally demanded that Semon become his own producer and underwrite his productions personally.\n\nSemon tried to reverse his money problems by entering the more lucrative field of feature films. He produced and starred in a few features in the mid-1920s, including the financial disaster \"The Wizard of Oz\" in 1925; but by 1927 he was back in short subjects released through Educational Pictures. After filing for bankruptcy in March 1928, Semon returned to vaudeville. While traveling on the vaudeville circuit, he suffered a nervous breakdown and went back to Los Angeles.\n\nAfter returning to Los Angeles, Semon was admitted to a sanatorium in Victorville, California, where on October 8, 1928—at the age of 39—he died of pneumonia and tuberculosis. His wife Dorothy Dwan was reported to be at his bedside when he died. In its obituary for Semon, the trade paper \"Variety\" speculated that ongoing stress related to his dire financial circumstances was a contributing factor in his demise, alluding to the 1925 production of \"The Wizard of Oz\" as the major cause of his money woes:\n\nFrench audiences knew him as Zigoto, Italian ones as Ridolini, and Spanish ones as Jaimito (\"Jimmy\") in pre-war releases and Tomasín (\"Tommy\") in the 1940 rereleases by Manuel Rotellar.\n\n\n\n"}

The band name \"Troopers\" is based on the term \"troops,\" the designation Frost used in the film to refer to his friends and followers. \n\nA studio group appeared on the soundtrack album for the film, along with incidental music penned by Cynthia Weil and Barry Mann and composed by Les Baxter; however, the songs were not originally credited to Max Frost and the Troopers, but rather to The 13th Power.\n\nOwing to the success of the song \"Shape of Things To Come\" as a single, an accompanying album by Max Frost and The Troopers, \"Shape of Things to Come\", was issued on the Tower record label in 1968.

It is located north of Masham and south of Bedale on the eastern slopes of the Ure Valley at the entrance to Wensleydale and the Yorkshire Dales National Park. It is 11 miles North of Ripon, 4 miles from the A1, 11 miles from the main railway line at Northallerton and 18 miles from Teesside Airport. Its population was 180 in 2000, 190 in 2005, 224 in 2011 and 240 in 2016.\n\nThe village lies at the junction of Watlass Lane and Watlass Moor Lane. At the centre of the village is the triangular village green with its trees, cricket pitch and children's playground, surrounded by houses, some of which are built from local stone. Thornton Watlass Church dates from the 11th century and the village also has a primary school and a public house called the \"Buck Inn\". The village forms part of the Thornton Watlass Estate, and Thornton Watlass Hall, an ancient two-storey gabled stone house, lies just to the north of the village.\n\nA prehistoric feature in the Thornton Watlass area is Gospel Hill tumulus, a Scheduled Ancient Monument, at about 1 km northwest of the village. The site of the priory is now a scheduled ancient monument.\n\nSaxon remains of two cross-heads are evidence that people lived in the area before the Norman conquest in 1066. They are on display in Thornton Watlass Church.\n\nThe \"Domesday book\" of 1086 mentions the separate villages of Thornton and Watlass. Before the Norman conquest the Saxon owners of these villages were Ulward and Stan; however, Thornton is shown in the Domesday book as being owned by Ribald, brother of Alan Earl of Richmond. Thornton Watlass Hall and estate has been owned by the Dodsworth family since 1415.\n\nThe Anglican Church of St Mary the Virgin stands a little way outside the village to the southwest. It was rebuilt, with the exception of the tower, in 1868 in the Perpendicular style. The tower contains some living accommodation (including toilet) and was probably used as a place of safety in times of strife.\n\nThe village school was built in 1872.\n\nToday the village has about fifty houses and a few farms, with a population of 222 at the 2011 Census.\n\nThe Church of England primary school is federated with Snape Community School and had 41 children on the roll in 2007 aged between 4 and 11 years, taught in two mixed-age classes. By 2016, the pupil numbers had dropped to 25.\n\nThere is also provision for under-5s in the village hall.\n\nThe village public house, restaurant and hotel, \"The Buck Inn\" overlooks the village green. Specialities include locally brewed real ale, Sunday lunchtime jazz, and a large room for conferences and functions.\n\nJust to the north of the village, Thornton Watlass Hall is a private home, but also provides hotel accommodation. The Hall has been featured over the years on several television dramas, including \"All Creatures Great and Small\" (BBC), \"Wuthering Heights\" (ITV) and \"Heartbeat\" (ITV) where it has featured as Ashfordly Hall and Websters Hotel for the past nine years.\n\n"}

The line runs from near Baltimore, Maryland, southwest to Washington, D.C., along the former Baltimore and Ohio Rail Road (B&O) Washington Branch. The subdivision's Alexandria Extension provides a connection to Virginia and points south. \n\nThe northeast end of the line is at Halethorpe, Maryland, just north of the historic Thomas Viaduct, where it meets the Baltimore Terminal Subdivision and the Old Main Line Subdivision. Its southwest end is at the yard north of Union Station, at a junction with the Metropolitan Subdivision and Amtrak's Northeast Corridor.\n\nBetween Elkridge and Laurel, the Capital Subdivision's rail alignment forms the border between Howard and Anne Arundel counties, having been built before Howard County was created from western Anne Arundel County in 1844.\n\nMARC Train's Camden Line provides passenger service over the entire length of the main line.\n\nThe Alexandria Extension runs south 7.2 miles (11.6 km) from a junction at Hyattsville, Maryland to the Anacostia Railroad Bridge and the RF&P Subdivision in Southeast D.C. This busy route is used by freight trains to Virginia. It runs past Benning Yard and interchanges with the Landover Subdivision.\n\nIn 1831 the Maryland General Assembly authorized the B&O to build a branch from their main line within 8 miles (13 km) of Baltimore, to Washington. As this line would take much business from the parallel turnpikes, especially the Washington and Baltimore Turnpike, the charter specifically allowed those companies to subscribe to the stock of the railroad. Construction began in July 1833, and the line opened on August 25, 1835, splitting from the B&O main line at Relay, roughly 7 miles (11 km) from Baltimore.\n\nNotable structural features on the original line include the Thomas Viaduct, the first multi-span masonry railroad bridge in the United States, and the largest bridge in the country when it was completed in 1835; and the earliest example of an iron truss bridge designed by Wendel Bollman and installed at Savage.  \n\nThe first B&O passenger station (1835–1851) was located west of the Capitol, at 2nd Street and Pennsylvania Avenue NW. In 1851 the New Jersey Avenue Station was built at a point slightly north of the Capitol, on New Jersey Avenue NW, in the area now called Union Station Plaza. Trains reached that location via the current location of West Virginia Avenue, street-running trackage on I Street NE and Delaware Avenue, and private right-of-way just south of the current location of Louisiana Avenue. When the Washington Terminal Company opened the new Union Station in 1907, that alignment was changed to the current routing, partially using the former location of Delaware Avenue.\n\nThe Alexandria Extension, originally called the Alexandria Branch, was built in 1874 and ran 12.5 miles (20.1 km) to Shepherds Landing along the eastern shore of the Potomac River, to provide a connection to Virginia. The B&O had lost access to the Long Bridge across the river in 1870 due to political maneuvering by the Baltimore and Potomac Railroad (B&P)(controlled by the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR)). In order to efficiently route its trains to points south of Washington, the B&O set up a car float operation at Shepherds Landing, which carried freight cars across the river to Alexandria, Virginia. The ferry operation was discontinued in 1906 when the B&O obtained trackage rights from PRR. The B&O built a connecting track from the Alexandria Extension to the B&P's Anacostia Railroad Bridge, which provided access to PRR tracks in southwest D.C. (now called the CSX RF&P Subdivision) and the Long Bridge.\n\nDuring World War II, the B&O re-activated the Shepherds Landing crossing at the request of the U.S. Army. The Army had requested an additional Potomac River crossing for troop movements to supplement those on the Long Bridge, and the Corps of Engineers built a temporary bridge across the river in 1942. Both B&O and PRR trains traveled over the 3,360 foot (1,020 m) bridge. Train operations on the bridge ceased in 1945 at the end of the war, and the bridge was demolished in 1947.\n\nFor many years the junction at Hyattsville, called Alexandria Junction, was controlled by JD Tower. B&O built its first interlocking tower building at the site in 1894, and rebuilt the tower in 1912 and again in 1917. CSX closed this tower in 1992, and demolished it in 1994 after a fire.\n\nThe original track from the junction at Anacostia Bridge to Shepherds Landing became known as the Shepherd Branch. This spur served several industries, including Bolling Air Force Base and the Blue Plains Advanced Wastewater Treatment Plant. (Shown as \"Shepherd Industrial Track\" on the diagram.) The Blue Plains plant was the only customer on the branch when rail service ended in 2001.\n\nThe Chesapeake and Ohio Railway acquired control of the B&O in 1962, and the B&O and C&O both became a subsidiaries of the Chessie System in 1973. In 1980 the Chessie System merged with the Seaboard System to form CSX Corporation. In 1987 the CSX Corporation merged the B&O into the C&O, then, later that same year, merged the C&O into CSX Transportation (CSXT), which now owns the line.\n\n\n"}

These developed into the 50550 class of 1941–42, with various modifications.\n\nAt the outbreak of the Second World War, the War Department had initially chosen the LMS 'Jinty' 3F 0-6-0T as its standard shunting locomotive, but was persuaded by Hunslet that a simplified version of their more modern 50550 design would be more suitable. The first locomotive was completed at their Leeds works at the start of 1943.\n\nHunslet subcontracted some of the construction to Andrew Barclay Sons & Co., W. G. Bagnall, Hudswell Clarke, Robert Stephenson and Hawthorns and the Vulcan Foundry in order to meet delivery requirements.\n\nAfter D-Day they were used on Continental Europe and in North Africa as well as at docks and military sites in Britain.\n\nA total of 377 had been built for the War Department by 1947 (on orders placed during the war), with two further engines having been built for collieries (without the permission of the Ministry of Supply). When the end of the war reduced the need for locomotives, the military started to review its fleet:\n\n\nOthers were sold for industrial use. A number of those used on the continent are believed to have worked on light and industrial railways in France, six going to the Chemins de Fer Tunisiens in 1946. One was used in Valentigney on the Peugeot industrial branch line.\n\nAs the final War Department locomotives were being delivered, the National Coal Board was placing orders for identical locomotives to be used at their collieries. Between 1948 and 1964, 77 new \"Austerity\" locomotives were built for the NCB. A further fourteen engines were ordered in 1952 by the British Army to supplement its 90 existing engines.\n\nThe Yorkshire Engine Company also built eight locomotives to this design in 1954 for use in ironstone quarries and at Scunthorpe Steelworks. It has been suggested, although it has not been proven, that Hunslet sold some of the parts for the eight \"Austerities\" to the Yorkshire Engine Company as part of a subcontract settlement for the GWR 9400 Class 0-6-0PTs, ordered by the GWR from Hunslet and partially subcontracted to the Yorkshire Engine Company.\n\nHunslet undertook the rebuilding of many NCB locomotives and when the Army started to sell off locomotives again in 1959, they bought 15 examples that were to be rebuilt and sold on. The NCB bought 13 of these, the 14th was sold directly into preservation and the final locomotive was scrapped without being rebuilt. Ultimately from first to last, a total of 485 examples were constructed between 1943 and 1964.\n\nThe NCB continued to use Austerities in the 1970s and a small number remained in service until the early 1980s, notably at Bickershaw Colliery, Greater Manchester. Some of the examples that survived the longest were those fitted with mechanical stokers and Kylpor blast pipes or Giesl ejectors to improve their performance and reduce smoke.\n\n70 Austerities have been preserved on heritage railways, many in working order. Several have been painted as LNER Class J94s to represent mainline rather than industrial use. During the \"Rocket 150\" celebrations in 1979, NCB Bold Colliery \"Austerity\" No. 7 \"Robert\" also participated in the cavalcade of locomotives at Rainhill.\n\nNot all have survived intact; the boiler of RSH 7135 of 1944 was used on the replica broad gauge locomotive \"Iron Duke\" built at the National Railway Museum in 1985. A former Hunslet Austerity at the Watercress Line has been rebuilt from an 0-6-0ST into a 0-6-0T Thomas the Tank Engine lookalike, and another one into Douglas, also from \"The Railway Series\".\n\nThe Hunslet \"Austerity\" was produced as a model by Kitmaster from 1961 onwards in 00 gauge. The Kitmaster toolings were sold to Airfix in 1962 and later Dapol in 1981 when Airfix stopped production of model railway items; Dapol continued to use the Kitmaster toolings until they were destroyed by a fire at Dapol's Winsford headquarters in 1994. Dapol subsequently created a replacement moulding to allow production of these locomotives; this tooling was sold in 1996 to Hornby who have continued to produce the \"Austerity\" as both the J94 class and in various industrial liveries.\n\nGraham Farish and subsequently Bachmann have produced the \"Austerity\" as the LNER/BR J94 class for N gauge.\n\nDJmodels now produces J94 and austerity tanks in 00 gauge in a variety of liveries including BR as well as several industrial liveries.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2091659", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2091659", "title": "The New Inquisition", "text": "The New Inquisition\n\nThe New Inquisition is a book written by Robert Anton Wilson and first published in 1986. \"The New Inquisition\" is a book about ontology, science, paranormal events, and epistemology. Wilson identifies what he calls \"Fundamentalist Materialism\" belief and compares it to religious fundamentalism.\n\nIn \"The New Inquisition\" Wilson criticizes the Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal by claiming that scientists don't give a fair hearing to anyone they don't already agree with. Something else he criticizes is that the dependence on the military-industrial complex is the norm. He proclaims that instead of this dictatory attitude scientists should apply skepticism, or a kind of agnostic principle, when faced with new ideas.\n\nAccording to Wilson, science these days glorifies the \"Idol of Materialism\". He calls their belief \"Fundamental Materialism\" and likens it to religious fundamentalists. Wilson suggests a principle that \"refuses total belief or total denial and regards models as tools to be used only and always where appropriate and replaced (by other models) only and always where not appropriate\". It is intended to be deliberately shocking, Wilson states that he \"does not want its ideas to seem any less startling than they are.\"\n\nThe book's subtitle \"Irrational Rationalism and Citadel of Science\", summarizes its topics;\nThe New Inquisition is the author's term for what he refers to as a tendency within mainstream science to forbid certain forms of theories from being classed as \"science.\" He cites the cases of Wilhelm Reich, Rupert Sheldrake, and the Mars effect controversy, among others, in support of a central claim that a materialist bias within the scientific community has led to some speculations and theories he claimed were unjustly thought of as unscientific.\n\n\"The Citadel\" is the author's term for the military-industrial complex that he claims funds mainstream science and is the source of its bias. The book lists a large list of paranormal reports, (from the Fortean Times among others) with Wilson's tour of the history of modern physics. He is particularly interested in Bell's theorem, and Alain Aspect's experimental proof of Bell's theorem. Wilson opines that the implications of Aspect's proof include that magic is possible, and that \"\"the sum total of all minds is one\"\". He claims it is not a coincidence that the Darwinian model of evolution best suits the \"reality tunnel\" of the Citadel, and that biologists such as Sheldrake who have alternative theories of evolution are drummed out of mainstream science.\n\nOn the topic, he states,\n\nAmong the concepts covered is the idea of \"absolute laws of physics\" - he ends up saying that every \"law\" that has been investigated seemed to be subject to anomalous results from time to time, and that there may be some other parallel universe with absolute laws of physics that are always obeyed, but Wilson has not seen any sign of it around in this one. Wilson draws on a large number of accounts of recorded events said to be \"paranormal\" but dismissed by materialist science as mass hallucination, e.g. the visions in Fátima, Portugal, and various UFO sightings. He comments that when it comes to 70,000 people having a mass hallucination, it's difficult to see how the explanation is any less occult than the events the explanation purports to explain. \"\"You try it\"\", he writes. \"\"See if by any means you can induce a mass hallucination\" [...] \"try, saying, hey, take a look at that light over there brighter than the sun\".\"\n\nThe book lists many phenomena that the author claims do not fit neatly into a materialist account of the world, and secondly, the book introduces various interpretations of quantum physics that may or may not provide a ground for explanation. The book concludes with the idea which he claims Schrödinger supported, that the sum total of all minds is one, and that individual brains are best understood as local receivers, of an overall transmission which is always everywhere.\nThe author repeatedly says \"\"I am not asking you to believe any of this stuff, I'm just asking you to dispassionately observe your own reaction to these accounts\"\".\n\nJim Lippard described the quality of research in the book as \"very shoddy\". The book had a large number of typographical errors. He also said that Wilson's message about avoiding dogmatism was worthwhile, that the book was entertaining but that readers should be careful about taking Wilsons' explanations seriously. Lippard listed inaccuracies about the Esperanza Stone, fish falling from the sky and the alleged Mars effect.\n\nKristin Buxton compared Wilson to Martin Gardner, noting that Gardner has written on many of the topics that Wilson writes about in the book, taking very different points of view. She pointed out that Gardner doesn't think it is easy to exactly define pseudoscience, nor does Gardner think his ideas are infallible. She mentioned that other reviewers had pointed out problems with the research and that the book needs to be read with care. She concluded with suggesting a merging of the views of Robert Anton Wilson and Martin Gardner as a possible new approach to science.\n\nScientist Carl Sagan criticized Wilson's characterizing people skeptical of the phenomena he relates as an \"inquisition\" in his book \"The Demon-Haunted World\", writing: \"Wilson... describes skeptics as a 'new inquisition.' But to my knowledge no skeptic compels belief. Indeed, on most TV documentaries and talk shows, skeptics get short shrift and almost no air time. All that's happening is that some doctrines and methods are being criticized-at the worst, ridiculed-in magazines like \"The Skeptical Inquirer\" with circulations of a few tens of thousands. New Agers are not much, as in earlier times, being called up before criminal tribunals, nor whipped for having visions, and they are certainly not being burned at the stake. Why fear a little criticism? Aren't they interested to see how their beliefs hold up against the best counterarguments skeptics can muster?\"\n\n\n"}

It was originally classified as the 4800 Class when introduced in 1932, and renumbered in 1946.\n\nAlthough credited to Collett, the design dated back to 1868 with the introduction of the George Armstrong 517 class.\n\nLike the 48xx/14xx, the 517 Class was a lightweight loco for branchline work; it was built at Wolverhampton Works between 1868 and 1885.\n\nIn this period evolutionary changes included:\n\n\nLater gradual changes included: Belpaire fireboxes, boilers rated at as opposed to , full cabs, extended bunkers and the progressive conversion of short wheelbase locos to or . From 1924 onwards, several were converted to run with an autocoach, and in this configuration were the direct ancestors of the 48xx class.\n\nIn this form, the updated 517's were but a small step away from the 48xx. The wheelbase was still , the boiler still rated at only , and the wheels and . New was the Collett-style cab and bunker and the boiler nominally to a new design. A three bar crosshead was added to the motion. This was a 1924 innovation introduced with the GWR 5600 Class and also seen in the 1930s-built 5400, 6400 and 7400 classes of pannier tanks.\n\nThe 4800 Class was designed as a more modern version of the 517 Class, which were by then beginning to show their relative age. The first locomotive, No 4800, was built by Swindon Works and entered service in 1932, with a further seventy-four engines of this type following up to 1936. During this period, Swindon also built twenty 5800 Class engines, which were broadly similar but which were not fitted with autotrain equipment or the Swindon top feed as later fitted to a number of 4800 class engines.\n\nThe 4800 Class locomotives retained their original numbers until the GWR decided to experimentally convert twelve 2800 Class 2-8-0s for oil-firing. It was decided that the converted engines would be reclassified as the 4800 Class and so the 75 tank locomotives already carrying this designation were reclassified as the 1400 Class with running numbers 1400-1474. The engines did not revert to their original classification after the experiment ended in 1948.\n\nThe 1400 Class was designed to work with the GWR design of autocoach, a specialist coach designed for push-pull working and which could also be used with engines of other classes such as the 517's, the GWR 5400 Class, the GWR 6400 Class and the older GWR 2021 Class. This lack of auto gear was the cause of earlier scrapping of the 5800 Class as there was no work for them. The last, no. 5815, was withdrawn from Swindon shed in April 1961.\n\nThe auto-fitted locos fared little better; scrapping commenced in 1956 and all were withdrawn by early 1965. Nos. 1442 and 1450 were withdrawn from Exmouth Junction shed in May 1965. By the early 1960s several had been 'in store' (parked in an out-of-the-way siding with a tarpaulin over the chimney) for some time, being occasionally steamed to replace failed diesels.\n\nFour examples have been preserved, all late withdrawals from service in the 1963-1965 period. All went direct to preservation from British Railways in relatively good condition. The current location of the preserved examples is as follows:\n\n\nKnown affectionately as \"The Tivvy Bumper\", 1442 hauled the last train to Tiverton in October 1965.\nAll preserved examples apart from 1442 are fitted with auto train equipment and 1450 has also operated on the mainline in preservation, but due to its size was restricted in the amount of work it could do and was also restricted on mileage as the 1400s only have a max water capacity of . During the 1990s it worked a number of Dawlish Donkey trips from Exeter St David's to Newton Abbot.\n\n\n\n"}

There is some variation in the writing of the first part of the name. It is Epebrodunum in Strabo's text, but later translators corrected it. Strabo (iv.) says that from Tarasco to the borders of the Vocontii and the beginning of the ascent of the Alps, through the Druentia and Caballio, is 63 miles; and from thence to the other boundaries of the Vocontii, to the kingdom of Cottius (the Alpes Cottiae), to the village of Ebrodunum, 99 miles. Ebrodunum was in the \"civitas\" (tribal state) of the Caturiges, and just on the borders of the Vocontii, as it appears.\n\nThe position of Ebrodunum is easily determined by the itineraries and the name. Ptolemy (iii. 1) mentions Eborodunum as the city of the Caturiges, and no other. In the Jerusalem Itinerary Ebrodunum is called \"Mansio\", like Caturiges (modern Chorges), which was also in the territory of the Caturiges. There are Roman remains at Chorges, and none are mentioned at Embrun, though it appears that the cathedral of Embrun is built on the site of a Roman temple, or that some of the materials of a temple were used for it.\nEbrodunum was, for a time, the capital of the Roman province of \"Alpes Maritimae\".\n\nIn the feudal age, it was an important archbishopric see. The town was sacked in 1585 by Huguenots and in 1692 by the duke of Savoy during the Nine Years' War.\n\nIn stage 17 of the 2013 Tour de France, Embrun was the starting point for an individual time trial. In 2017, stage 19 of the Tour de France started at Embrun.\n\nEmbrun was the see of a bishopric since the fourth century, which became a Metropolitan archbishopric in the fourteenth century and was suppressed in the French Revolution.\n\nEmbrun features an oceanic climate (\"Cfb\") with strong continental influences (\"Dfb\"). Winters are rather cold and snowy. Winter nights are very cold (about -3 °C) compare to the other French cities. That's because Embrun is very far from the French coasts, and near the mountains. It creates a severe climate throughout the year. In spite of the cold winters, summers tend to be hot and hazy. The afternoon average temperatures are around 28 °C, but can sometimes exceed 35 °C. \n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2091686", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2091686", "title": "James Bernard (composer)", "text": "James Bernard (composer)\n\nJames Michael Bernard (20 September 1925 – 12 July 2001) was a British film composer, particularly associated with horror films produced by Hammer Film Productions. Starting with \"The Quatermass Xperiment\", he scored such classic films as \"The Curse of Frankenstein\" and \"Dracula\". He also occasionally scored non-Hammer films including \"Windom's Way\" (1957) and \"Torture Garden\" (1967).\n\nBernard was educated at Wellington College, previously attended by Christopher Lee, the future star of many Hammer horror films Bernard was to score. In an interview late in his life, Bernard recalled that in his mid-teens three of his favourite books were \"The Devil Rides Out\", \"\", and \"The Hound of the Baskervilles\". While still a schoolboy, Bernard met Benjamin Britten when the composer came to consult the school's art master, Kenneth Green, about the stage designs for \"Peter Grimes\". Britten took interest in an inter-house music composition, and advised Bernard on the music he was writing. The two stayed in touch during Bernard's service in the RAF from 1943 to 1946, and Britten encouraged him to learn the principles of composition. \n\nDuring the war, Bernard worked with the team dedicated to breaking the code of the German Enigma machine, specialising in deciphering intercepted Japanese messages. During those years, on occasion Bernard came to London to turn pages for Britten while he played piano in recitals.\n\nIn 1944 Bernard met Paul Dehn, who was then a Major working for Military Intelligence, Section 6 (MI6). This was the start of a lifelong partnership, the two moving in together in an apartment on London's King's Road while Bernard was still serving with the RAF in 1946.\n\nAfter being demobbed, Bernard enrolled as a student at the Royal College of Music (RCM) in 1947, studying under Herbert Howells. He graduated in 1949. In 1950 Britten asked him to copy out the full score of his new opera \"Billy Budd\" for his publishers Boosey & Hawkes, inviting him to stay at his home in Aldeburgh. He went to the opera's opening night with Benjamin Britten's housekeeper and the librettist, E. M. Forster.\n\nPaul Dehn, by now a writer and critic, asked Bernard to collaborate with him on the original screenplay for the Boulting Brothers film \"Seven Days to Noon\" (1950). For this Paul Dehn and James Bernard shared the 1952 Academy Award for the Best Writing, Motion Picture Story. Then in 1953 Bernard received his first commission to write incidental music: for a radio play by Patric Dickinson, \"The Death of Hector\". Not having been taught orchestration at the RCM, Bernard often turned for advice to Imogen Holst, whom Britten had recommended when Bernard had asked for someone \"with whom I could study or go to or take things to\". \n\nBernard also sought her assistance when writing incidental music for a broadcast radio production of \"The Duchess of Malfi\", which starred Richard Burton, Peggy Ashcroft and Paul Scofield. The music for this so impressed John Hollingsworth, effectively the music director of Hammer Film Productions, that when the composer originally scheduled to score \"The Quatermass Xperiment\" fell ill the job was offered to Bernard.\n\n\"The Quatermass Xperiment\" was scored for strings and percussion only at John Hollingsworth's instruction: \"I don't think he trusted me with anything more than a small string orchestra\", Bernard later suggested. \"At that time John Hollingsworth was one of the chief conductors of the Royal Ballet at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, so he used players from the Opera House orchestra,\" Bernard elsewhere wrote. The score, predating Bernard Herrmann's for \"Psycho\" by five years, has been cited as the first film score to treat strings in an unconventional, non-romantic manner, including the use of tone clusters and asking string players to bow on the wrong side of the bridge. Again, Bernard showed the score to Imogen Holst before he committed it to the recording sessions for the soundtrack.\n\nFollowing his scores to \"X the Unknown\" and \"Quatermass 2\", Bernard scored Hammer's first horror film, \"The Curse of Frankenstein\" (1957). This included some music he had originally composed for \"The Duchess of Malfi\". Next came \"Dracula\" (1958), in which the title cue featured a motif based on the sound \"Dra-cu-laaaaa\", inspired by a suggestion Paul Dehn made to Bernard. Other Hammer horror scores include \"The Kiss of the Vampire\" (1962), \"The Gorgon\" (1964), \"\" (1966), \"The Plague of the Zombies\" (1966), \"The Devil Rides Out\" (1968), \"Dracula Has Risen from the Grave\" (1968), \"Frankenstein Must Be Destroyed\" (1969), \"Frankenstein and the Monster from Hell\" (1974) and \"The Legend of the 7 Golden Vampires\" (1974). He also scored non-horror Hammer films such as \"The Hound of the Baskervilles\" (1959), \"The Stranglers of Bombay\" (1959), \"The Terror of the Tongs\" (1961), \"The Damned\" (1963), \"The Secret of Blood Island\" (1964), and \"She\" (1965).\n\nA distinctive trait in Bernard's Hammer scores are their use of clashing harmonies, often created by doubling a motif a tone higher, as in his famous Dracula theme. His music is also frenzied and pacey at times, frequently making use of percussion such as timpani and snares. \"The Devil Rides Out\" (1968) and \"The Plague of the Zombies\" (1966) are good examples of this. However, he could also write lushly romantic melodies, such as appear in \"Frankenstein Created Woman\" (1967), \"Taste the Blood of Dracula\" (1970) and \"Scars of Dracula\" (also 1970). Unlike the majority of film composers, Bernard orchestrated almost all of his work.\n\nPaul Dehn died in 1976. Working on \"She\" (1965), Bernard first met the man who later became his second life partner, actor Ken McGregor (died January 24, 1994), with whom he lived in Jamaica until McGregor's death there in 1994. Bernard then moved back to London and lived there for the remainder of his life.\n\nIn later years, he was called upon by silent film historian Kevin Brownlow to write an original score for F. W. Murnau's classic silent horror \"Nosferatu\" (1922/1997) and for Brownlow's documentary \"Universal Horror\" (1998) on the horror films of the American studio. He also wrote the score to Paul Cotgrove's 2001 short horror film \"Green Fingers\" (starring Hammer veteran actresses Ingrid Pitt and Janina Faye). David Huckvale's critical biography of the composer, \"James Bernard – Composer to Count Dracula\" was published by McFarland in 2006.\n\n\n"}

In the classical model of ruin theory, the net cash position formula_22 is a function of the initial surplus, premium income earned at rate formula_23, and outgoing claims formula_24:formula_25where formula_26 is a Poisson process for the number of claims with intensity formula_27. Under these circumstances, the ruin probability may be represented by a Volterra integral equation of the form:formula_28where formula_29 is the survival function of the claims distribution.\n\n\n"}

A subsequent archaeological dig over four summers revealed 26 more gold and silver objects situated in a major open-air ritual site.\n\nThe Buckinghamshire family of Nernewt (Nernuyt) held land here in the 14th century, which was originally part of the Abbot of Westminster's manor. This land became the manor of Westbury Nernewtes.\n\nThe village has a wealth of architecture spanning several centuries. There was also a great fire of Ashwell on Saturday 2 February 1850, without fatalities.\n\nThe village itself is mostly in a fine state of preservation, from the medieval cottage to the fine town house, plastered or timbered, thatched or tiled, in Tudor, Carolean or Georgian brick. 'Scheduled' listed buildings include the St. John's Guildhall of 1681, the carefully restored Foresters Cottages, the Chantry House with its 15th-century window, the 16th-century town house (now a local museum), the Maltings (now converted into flats), and a small brick house which was first built in 1681 as a school by the Merchant Taylors. Ashwell Bury, a large Victorian house, was remodelled by Edwin Lutyens in the 1920s. Lutyens also designed the Grade 2 listed Ashwell War Memorial, unveiled in 1922. Ashwell also has a village lock-up that was used to detain drunks and suspected criminals. The village used to be home to a number of local breweries and, accordingly, a variety of public houses in its past, but currently has just three pubs: The Rose and Crown, the Three Tuns and the Bushel and Strike.\n\nSince 1850 the village has been served by Ashwell and Morden railway station which is about a mile and half from the centre of the village in the hamlet of Odsey in Cambridgeshire.\n\nThe parish church of St Mary the Virgin dates almost entirely from the 14th century and is renowned for its ornate church tower which stands at , and is crowned by an octagonal lantern with a leaded 'spike'. The church also contains some medieval graffiti carved on its walls which highlights the plight of survivors of the bubonic plague pandemic known as the Black Death.\n\nIn 2013, the village church became the centre of a nationally reported row over the quarter-hourly chiming of the clock. Complaints about the chimes during the night were initially received in the summer of that year, which North Hertfordshire District Council (NHDC) was legally obliged to investigate. In December, the council ruled that the chimes are \"prejudicial to health\" and have to be silenced between 11 pm and 6 am. Complying with the ruling has meant turning off the chimes altogether, although the parish council has asked the diocese in St Albans if it can install a timing mechanism that will restrict the chimes to the legally appointed hours, and has launched an appeal to raise the £1,900 cost. The chiming clock was initially installed in 1898, but was turned off for 18 months in 2011 and 2012 while repairs were carried out. A public meeting on 19 January 2014 discussed the future of the chimes. In May 2015, a timer had been installed to silence the church bells overnight.\n\nAshwell Springs, a biological Site of Special Scientific Interest, is a perennial source of the River Cam. The cool water of the chalk springs contain a rare species of stenothermic flatworm (Platyhelminthes; Tricladida) associated with cold surface waters or subterranean groundwater that is only known from this location within East Anglia. The springs now depend upon artificial flow augmentation during drier periods, due to the impact of local groundwater abstraction from the chalk aquifer for public water supply.\n\nThe village is a \"green oasis\" with many trees and this contrasts with the surrounding landscape dominated by intense agricultural production, principally of wheat, with rather limited aesthetic or biodiversity interest.\n\nAshwell has several successful sports teams from under-12s to veterans. The adult first football team have won several trophies and are currently in the Hall's of Cambridge Sunday league premier division. The cricket team won the Cambridgeshire Junior Cup in 2003 and currently play in Division 1 of the Cambridgeshire league. There are many other clubs and societies catering for all interests. Ashwell have a junior soccer side called the Academicals, which are from age 5 to 18.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2091700", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2091700", "title": "The Kiss of the Vampire", "text": "The Kiss of the Vampire\n\nThe Kiss of the Vampire (also known as Kiss of Evil on American television) is a 1963 British vampire film made by the film studio Hammer Film Productions. The film was directed by Don Sharp and was written by producer Anthony Hinds, credited under his writing pseudonym John Elder.\n\nIt was Sharp's first movie for Hammer and he would go on to make several films for the company.\n\nGerald (Edward de Souza) and Marianne Harcourt (Jennifer Daniel), are a honeymooning couple in early 20th-century Bavaria who become caught up in a vampire cult led by Dr. Ravna (Noel Willman) and his two children Carl (Barry Warren) and Sabena (Jacquie Wallis). The cult abducts Marianne, and contrives to make it appear that Harcourt was travelling alone and that his wife never existed. Harcourt gets help from hard-drinking savant Professor Zimmer (Clifford Evans), who lost his daughter to the cult and who finally destroys the vampires through an arcane ritual utilising the Seal of Solomon that releases a swarm of bats from Hell.\n\n\nOriginally intended to be the third movie in Hammer's \"Dracula\" series (which began with 1958's \"Dracula\" with Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing, and was followed by 1960's \"The Brides of Dracula\" with Cushing alone), it was another attempt by Hammer to make a \"Dracula\" sequel without Christopher Lee. The final script, by Anthony Hinds, makes no reference to \"Dracula,\" and expands further on the directions taken in \"Brides\" by portraying vampirism as a social disease afflicting those who choose a decadent lifestyle.\n\nThe job of directing was offered to Don Sharp, who later said he had never seen a horror film before being asked to the job by Tony Hinds. Hinds told Sharp he thought the director would be ideal based on Sharp's other work. The director watched \"Curse of Frankenstein\", \"Dracula\" and \"Stranglers from Bombay\" and became enthusiastic.\n\n\"What intrigued me about them was after about 20 minutes I was totally hooked despite a totally absurd situation,\" he said later. \"I thought it was wonderful - here was a genre with its own ground rules and self contained world and you could be theatrical but treat it realistically to grab the audience and make them believe something absurd.\"\n\nSharp said he was worried that \"as Hammer progressed, the goal seemed to be for each picture to top the one before it and they were becoming satiated with violence. So I persuaded Tony that it was better to suggest 'Is it going to happen?' and give the audience a little touch of it, and then go on and really get your big shock at the end. There could be a good size shock in the middle too but not all the time.\"\n\nSharp said \"I've always believed there needs to be a separation between suspense and shock. You lead on a mood but if you introduce the shock moment too quickly then it's expected. If you hang on keeping the same mood and tempo as the rest of the sequence, and then shatter the mood with a sudden violent moment, that's when it really works.\"\n\nThe film went into production on 7 September 1962 at Bray Studios. It was not released until 1964.\n\nThis is the only credited feature film screen role of Jacquie Wallis, who plays Sabena.\n\nThe film's climax, involving black magic and swarms of bats, was originally intended to be the ending of \"The Brides of Dracula\", but the star of that film, Peter Cushing, objected that Van Helsing would never resort to black sorcery. The paperback novelization of \"Brides\" does, however, use this ending.\n\nRetitled \"Kiss of Evil\" for American TV, Universal trimmed so much of the original film for its initial television screening that more footage had to be shot to fill the missing time. Additional characters that didn't appear at all in the original release were added, creating a whole new subplot. Every scene that showed blood was edited out, e.g. the pre-credits scene in which blood gushes from the coffin of Zimmer's daughter after he plunges a shovel into it. Also, in the televised version it is never revealed what Marianne sees behind the curtain (Ravna lying on his bed with blood trickling from the corners of his mouth), a sight which makes her scream. A couple of the cuts result in scenes that no longer make sense: while the theatrical release had Harcourt smearing the blood on his chest into a cross-shaped pattern (keeping the vampires away as he escapes), the televised version omits the blood-smearing, leaving the vampires' inaction unexplained.\n\nThe additional footage shot for the televised version revolves around a family, the Stanghers, who argue about the influence of the vampiric Ravna clan but never interact with anybody else in the movie. The teenage daughter, Theresa, throws over her boyfriend in favor of Carl Ravna (unseen in these scenes) who has given her a music box which plays the same hypnotic tune that he plays on the piano elsewhere in the movie.\n\nHoward Thompson of \"The New York Times\" wrote, \"Until the picture floridly hops off the track toward the end, this horror exercise is a quietly stylish, ice-cold treat, beautifully tinted, well-directed (Don Sharp) and persuasively acted (Edward de Souza and Jennifer Daniel have the leads).\" \"Variety\" wrote, \"Horror fans will dig this latest effort from the Hammer Film shop in Britain. It is a slickly-produced color story of evil doings in Bavaria, circa 1910, replete with suspense, demonism and mystery tightly wrapped in a skillful package of effective performance and well-paced direction.\" \"The Monthly Film Bulletin\" wrote, \"No new developments seem to have emerged in the vampire world, and this film is a straightforward and rather tame rehash of the standard formula ... The direction is competent enough, though Don Sharp reveals no flair for this kind of thing, and there is a signal lack of atmosphere.\"\n\nIn North America, the film was released on 6 September 2005 along with seven other Hammer horror films-\"The Brides of Dracula\", \"Nightmare\", \"The Evil of Frankenstein\", \"The Curse of the Werewolf\", \"Paranoiac\", \"Night Creatures\", \"The Phantom of the Opera\"-on the 4-DVD set \"The Hammer Horror Series\" (ASIN: B0009X770O), which is part of MCA-Universal's \"Franchise Collection\". This set was re-released on Blu-ray on 13 September 2016.\n\n\n"}

The line-up was Stewart Lupton (vocals), Tom Frank (bass), Paul Maroon (guitar and pedal steel), Matt Barrick (drums), and Walter Martin (organs, keyboards). After the band's break-up, Maroon, Barrick, and Martin went on to form The Walkmen.\n\nJonathan Fire*Eater was formed from a childhood band called The Ignobles. All the members of Jonathan Fire*Eater attended high school at the D.C. private school St. Albans School. Lupton, Martin, and Barrick formed the Ignobles in junior high school. Maroon joined as the guitarist and Ryan Cheney signed on as the vocalist. Lupton played bass. In 1993, the members went to college, mostly in New York City, and Jonathan Fire*Eater was formed with Cheney departing and later joining The Cunning Runts and Lupton taking over vocal duties. St. Albans alum Tom Frank joined as a new bassist.\n\nIn 1995, they released their eponymous debut on Tucson, Arizona's Third World Underground Records, which featured \"Christmastime, Halloween\", \"To The Tigers\", and other tracks. Later that year, a self-titled EP on PCP established their reputation with the frenetic tracks \"The Public Hanging of a Movie Star\" and \"When Prince Was a Kid\".\n\nIn 1996, the five-song mini-album \"Tremble Under Boom Lights\" was released by the Medicine label, featuring well-produced offers such as \"The Search for Cherry Red\" and \"Give Me Daughters\". Reviews were positive, with AllMusic describing \"Tremble\" as \"a ferocious record\" despite its \"minor flaws.\" By this time, the band was receiving considerable media and industry attention. They were courted by Calvin Klein to model and opened for Brit Pop stars Pulp and Blur. As Lupton said in a 1996 \"New York Times Magazine\" profile, \"Right now the record companies are sort of circling like vultures.\"\n\nIn early 1997, Jonathan Fire*Eater signed with David Geffen's nascent DreamWorks music label. Their major label debut, \"Wolf Songs for Lambs\", was released by DreamWorks in 1997 to tepid critical response. Not long after the album's release, tensions between Lupton and the other members and a general wariness of mainstream success led to the band's breakup. They played their last show at the Central Park bandshell on July 28, 1998.\n\nJonathan Fire*Eater was once called \"possibly the most hyped young group that nobody has ever heard of\".\n\nMaroon, Barrick, and Martin later went on to form The Walkmen and Lupton has pursued his music career through his band The Childballads, who put out their debut album in January 2007. The latter has toured with Cat Power and the Kills. In 2009, he released an EP in a new band, The Beatin's, which he formed with Carole Wagner Greenwood. Titled \"A Little Give And Take\", the limited edition vinyl included Lupton's poetry and the duo's art and writing. Tom Frank pursued a career in journalism as T.A. Frank.\n\nStewart Lupton died on May 27, 2018 at the age of 43.\n\nIn addition to being a precursor to the Walkmen, Jonathan Fire*Eater has also been cited as an influence by many of the early New York City-based groups of the post-punk revival, including Interpol and the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, and comparisons were drawn between the band and the Strokes. The Kills, also considered part of the post-punk revival, covered \"The Search for Cherry Red\"; their version was released as a B-side to their single \"Pull A U\".\n\n\n"}

It is commonly included in a Swedish Christmas dinner table, but is often eaten on other occasions including Easter. The dish is also common in Finland where it is known as \"janssoninkiusaus\".\nThe potatoes are cut into thin strips and layered in a roasting tin, alternating with the sprats and chopped onions in between. Salt and pepper is put over each layer, then cream is added so that it almost fills the tin. It is finally baked in an oven at for about one hour.\nThe recipe is often mistranslated into English, with anchovies being substituted for sprats. This is because sprats (\"Sprattus sprattus\") pickled in sugar, salt and spices have been known in Sweden as \"ansjovis\" since the middle of the 19th century, while true anchovies (\"Engraulis encrasicolus\") are sold in Sweden as \"sardeller\" (sardelles). Also, small herrings (\"Clupea harengus\") may be used instead of sprats.\n\nIt has often been associated with the opera singer Per Adolf \"Pelle\" Janzon (1844–1889), remembered as a gourmand. However, another claim for the origin of the name has been made by Gunnar Stigmark (1910-2001) in an article – \"Så var det med Janssons frestelse\" – which appeared in the periodical \"Gastronomisk kalender\". According to Stigmark, the name was borrowed from the film \"Janssons frestelse\" (1928) featuring the popular actor Edvin Adolphson; as a name for this dish it was coined by Stigmark's mother and her hired cooking lady for the particular occasion of a society dinner, whence it spread to other households and eventually into cookbooks.\n\n"}

{"id": "2091748", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2091748", "title": "Starting lineup", "text": "Starting lineup\n\nIn sports, a starting lineup is an official list of the set of players who will participate in the event when the game begins. The players in the starting lineup are commonly referred to as \"starters\", whereas the others are \"substitutes\" or \"bench players\".\n\nThe starters are commonly the best players on the team at their respective positions. Consequently, there is often a bit of prestige that is associated with being a starter. This is particularly true in sports with limited substitutions, like baseball or soccer. In both baseball and basketball, it is common for players' positions to be denoted by a number as well as by a name. In that instance, the associated number is used as well. If a common abbreviation is known, the abbreviation is listed after the associated number.\n\nIn American football since the 1950s, most upper level teams use a three-platoon system, each with its own starting lineup. The starting lineups for offense and defense, each with eleven players, typically get the most attention. The starting lineups are defined as the eleven players who take the first offensive or defensive play from scrimmage of a given game. (An offensive player does not have to be on the team that gets possession first to be considered a starter, nor does a defensive player have to be on the team that does not; the first play from scrimmage after the first change of possession counts as well.) The third platoon, special teams, in modern times is composed mostly of backup and reserve players from the offensive or defensive platoons, with the exception of the placekicker or punter; the players who, for instance, take part in the opening kickoff are typically not considered starters.\n\nThe player positions dictate certain responsibilities and privileges in regard to handling the ball. A uniform numbering system restricts players' ability to change positions in the middle of the game.\n\nThe offensive lineup is heavily restricted by rules that have been adopted over the course of the game's development. Several positions (indicated with * in the list below) are mandatory and must appear in any lineup, starting or otherwise. Others can be used or unused at the discretion of a team's coach, provided that no more than 11 players are on the field at any given time and at least seven (usually exactly seven) are positions along the line of scrimmage.\n\nIn addition to the center, guards and tackles, at least two ends (be they tight ends or split end wide receivers) must also be in the lineup.\n\nIn recent history the 4-3 defense (4 defensive linemen plus 3 linebackers) formation has been standard among college and professional squads. However, the 3-4 (3 defensive linemen plus 4 linebackers) formation is becoming more popular among professional and NCAA Division I teams. Unlike offenses, defenses have no restrictions on positions, and the standard lineups have developed largely through tradition, experimentation, trial and error.\n\nThe third phase, special teams, generally designates only a few positions as \"starters\", other than these specialists the other positions on the field are taken up as secondary positions by players who normally play offense or defense.\n\nIn Association football, Starting lineup is termed a starting 11 (starting eleven) or starting XI.\n\nThe starting 11 or starting XI is a list of the players who will actively participate in the game when the match begins.\n\nThe starting 11 consists of 11 players, with 1 designated goalkeeper. All other positions are optional, and teams can vary the player formations they use.\n\nThe formation are often described using the numbers of defenders, midfielders and striker/attackers used. For example, a commonly used formation is 4-4-2, which means there are 4 defenders, 4 midfielders and 2 strikers.\n\nSome formations may list 4 numbers, which usually differentiates between defensive and attacking midfielders, e.g. 4-2-3-1 would mean 4 defenders, 2 defensive midfielders, 3 attacking midfielders, and 1 striker.\n\nIn Australian rules football, a team starts with eighteen players on the field. The traditional positions are as listed below, however in modern football the players are organised into three main groups, forwards, midfielders and defenders, each consisting of between four and eight players. Only four midfielders from each team are allowed to start inside the centre square, the other 14 players can start anywhere on the field.\n\nThe starting lineup in baseball comprises either nine or ten players. In the National League of Major League Baseball and the Central League of Nippon Professional Baseball, there are nine players in the starting lineup and all players bat. American League (MLB) and Pacific League (NPB) teams have the option of using a designated hitter (DH) in place of the pitcher in the batting order. The DH does not play when the team is on defense.\n\nIn softball, where ten players are in the field, the tenth is usually placed in the outfield (OF); if placed between the infield and outfield, the extra fielder is known as a \"rover.\"\n\nThe designated hitter (DH), when used, is designated with the number zero. In variants of the game where all nine positions plus a designated hitter must bat, the designated hitter is instead known as an \"extra hitter\" (EH).\n\nIn the National Basketball Association (NBA), two starting players are traditionally announced as guards, two as forwards, and one as a center. At least ten minutes before the game is scheduled to begin, the scorers need to be supplied with the name and number of each player who is to participate in the game. The various positions are not mentioned anywhere in the official NBA rule book, and most players play more than one position.\n\nThe starting lineup on a basketball team usually comprises five positions and is called the 2-1-2 lineup:\n\nIn American college basketball, a starting lineup is announced for each team before the game. Starting players are designated as either centers, forwards, or guards. A team can name at most one center, but otherwise any combination of positions is allowable, as long as five players are named. Lineups of three guards, one forward, and one center, or of three guards and two forwards, are the most common alternate lineups.\n\nIn Canadian football, a team starts with 12 players on offense, 12 players on defense, and a special teams squad of 12 players for punts, kickoffs, and extra point attempts. As in American football, most of the special teams players are starters or bench players for offence or defence.\n\nBecause of substantial differences between the two codes—most notably the larger field and only having three downs to advance the ball 10 yards instead of four—offensive formations are somewhat different in the Canadian game. Most notably, tight ends are almost completely absent in Canada.\n\nThe Canadian Football League has an additional rule that at least seven of the 24 offensive and defensive starters in a game be Canadian citizens. These seven starters can be of any position except quarterback.\n\n\nDefences are broadly similar to those in the U.S., with the extra player used as a defensive back. Since most of the positions are essentially identical to those in American football, only the main differences will be listed here.\n\nPositions generally similar to those in the U.S.\n\nGaelic football and hurling, as well as ladies' Gaelic football and camogie, use the same starting lineup. Teams consist of one goalkeeper and fourteen outfield players (underage teams may play 13-a-side, omitting the full back and full forward positions). Teams lineup in six lines, with the goalkeeper furthest back and the full-forward line closest to the opposing team's goal. Players play on the left or right of the field looking in the direction they are attacking. Position numbering is fixed and positions are set up so that every attacker has a corresponding defender: for example, a right corner forward (jersey number 13) will be marked by a left corner back (4). Players sometimes swap positions during a match and there are sometimes tactical variations in formation, such as dropping one of the six forwards back to provide a third midfielder. Up to five substitutions are allowed during normal time (and another three if there is extra time), from a bench of 9 or sometimes 11 substitutions; substitutions are not numbered in any particular order.\n\n\nThe starting lineup in hurling or camogie is the same as that for Gaelic football.\n\nIn ice hockey, a team starts out with six players on the ice:\n\nThe starting forwards are typically known as the \"top line\" or \"first line\", as most professional teams rotate four distinct three-man forward lines and three defense pairings.\n\nIn ice hockey, a team must submit their starting lineup to the opposing team's captain and to the officials before the game. If a team inserts any other player into the lineup at game time, the opposing captain can direct the official to call a \"starting the wrong lineup\" penalty, a two-minute minor.\n\nThe starting lineup in field lacrosse comprises ten players: 3 Attackmen, 3 Defensemen, 3 Midfielders, and 1 Goalkeeper. A team may start a Long-Stick Midfielder for a defensive advantage. A team may have a player reserved exclusively to take face-offs, known as a FOGO.\n\nIn netball, a team starts with seven players on the court:\n\nA Rugby league football starting lineup is\n\n\nRugby union starting lineups consist of:\n\n\nThe starting lineup for a volleyball match typically includes:\n\n\nVariations do exist – sometimes there will be two setters, or three outside hitters without a true opposite. Though the libero is typically announced with the starting lineup, he or she is not considered to be part of it, as the libero will replace one of the above players (typically a middle blocker, as teams will want to split their middle blockers, with one beginning in the front row) before the first rally.\n"}
