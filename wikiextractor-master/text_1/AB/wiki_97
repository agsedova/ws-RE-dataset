It provides the functions which in mammals are provided separately by the liver and pancreas, including the production of digestive enzymes, and absorption of digested food.\n\nArthropods, especially detritivores in the Order Isopoda, Suborder Oniscidea (woodlice), have been shown to be able to store heavy metals in their hepatopancreas. This could lead to bioaccumulation through the food chain and implications for food web destruction, if the accumulation gets high enough in polluted areas; for example, high metal concentrations are seen in spiders of the genus \"Dysdera\" which feed on woodlice, including their hepatopancreas, the major metal storage organ of isopods in polluted sites.\n\nThe hepatopancreas is a centre for lipid metabolism and for storage of lipids in gastropods.\n\nSome species in the genus \"Phyllodesmium\" contains active zooxanthellae of the genus \"Symbiodinium\" in the hepatopancreas.\n\n"}

The book was released in 1837, and is part of the larger tradition of shape note singing.\n\nWilliam Caldwell was born in 1801 in Tennessee, the son of Anthony Caldwell and Elizabeth Aiken. William Caldwell first married Cinderella Blackburn in 1829. After her death, he married Harriet Rebecca Meek. William's children include Tillman A., Orville H., Cordula J., Leonidas Beecher, Eliza, Catherine Josephine, Mary Alice, Evaline V., and Amy H. Caldwell. The Caldwells moved from Jefferson County, Tennessee some time after 1850 to Fannin County, Texas. William died in 1857 and Harriet in 1858.\n\n\"Union Harmony or Family Musician\" was a four shape tunebook, registered in 1834, but printed in 1837 in Maryville, Tennessee by Ferdinand A. Parham. It contained 151 tunes, of which 43 songs are credited to William Caldwell. Many of these tunes, Caldwell wrote, were \"not entirely original, but he has harmonized, and therefore claims them.\" David Music called this book \"The First East Tennessee Tunebook\". Writers from George Pullen Jackson to Harry Eskew consider the chief contribution on Caldwell and the \"Union Harmony\" to be the preservation of folk songs of the oral tradition. Union Harmony went through only one printing. Though long out of print, Caldwell's songs have survived in other shape note tune books, such as \"The Good Old Songs\" by C. H.

It treats and prevents infections of heartworms, fleas, ear mites, sarcoptic mange (scabies), and certain types of ticks in dogs, and prevents heartworms, fleas, ear mites, hookworms, and roundworms in cats. It is structurally related to ivermectin and milbemycin. Selamectin is not approved for human use.\n\nThe drug is applied topically. It is isopropyl alcohol based, packaged according to its varying dosage sizes and applied once monthly. It is not miscible in water. \n\nSelamectin disables parasites by activating glutamate-gated chloride channels at muscle synapses. Selamectin activates the chloride channel without desensitization, allowing chloride ions to enter the nerve cells and causing neuromuscular paralysis, impaired muscular contraction, and eventual death.\n\nThe substance fights both internal and surface parasitic infection. Absorbed into the body through the skin and hair follicles, it travels through the bloodstream, intestines, and sebaceous glands; parasites ingest the drug when they feed on the animal's blood or secretions.\n\nSelamectin has been found to be safe and effective in a 2003 review.\n\nSelamectin has high safety ratings, with less than 1% of pets displaying side effects. In cases where side-effects do occur, they most often include passing irritation or hair loss at the application site. Symptoms beyond these (such as drooling, rapid breathing, lack of coordination, vomiting, or diarrhea) could be due to shock as a result of selamectin killing heartworms or other vulnerable parasites present at high levels in the bloodstreams of dogs. This would be a reaction due to undetected or underestimated infections prior to using the medication, rather than an actual allergic reaction to the drug itself.\n\nMain rival products for dogs include ivermectin (trade names \"Stromectol\", \"Ivermec\" and others) or milbemycin oxime (\"Interceptor\") for heartworms, imidacloprid and moxidectin (\"Advocate\"), fipronil (\"Frontline\") or lufenuron (\"Program\") for fleas, or the combination milbemycin oxime/lufenuron (\"Sentinel\") for both.\n\n"}
{"id": "2041062", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2041062", "title": "Def Jam: Fight for NY", "text": "Def Jam: Fight for NY\n\nDef Jam: Fight for NY is a hip hop-influenced 3D action video game published by EA Games (unlike the original, which was published under the EA Sports BIG brand). It was released on September 21, 2004 for PlayStation 2, Xbox, and GameCube. It is a sequel to \"Def Jam Vendetta\" and is followed by \"\". The game features several rappers, including Lil' Kim, Snoop Dogg, Method Man, Redman, Fat Joe, Mobb Deep, Ice-T, Xzibit, N.O.R.E, Ludacris, Crazy Legs and Busta Rhymes, Flavor Flav, Sean Paul as well as the voices and likeness of other celebrities, such as Henry Rollins, Christopher Judge and Kimora Lee Simmons. DMX, Keith Murray, Christina Milian and Funkmaster Flex were the only artists from the original game that did not appear in the sequel. The game was spun off into a 2006 PlayStation Portable game called \"\".\n\nThe gameplay is expanded from the original game, which was primarily a wrestling game. Fighters can choose one, two, or three of five fighting styles. The fighting styles are Streetfighting, Kickboxing, Martial Arts, Submissions and Wrestling.\n\nAdditionally, \"Def Jam Fight for NY\" emphasizes the use of the game's various environments and the surrounding crowd to cause damage. Tossing the opponent against barriers gives fighters an opportunity to inflict massive damage to their opponent by slamming them into the wall headfirst, ramming a door or gate in their face, or using other features of the environment. The crowd will shove a fighter back into combat if he is thrown into them or gets too close, sometimes holding a fighter and leaving them open to attack. Some spectators carry weapons, and will offer them to the fighters, or even attack a fighter if they are held by a nearby onlooker.\n\n\"Momentum\" is gained by successfully performing moves, countering, and taunting the opponent. The rate at which momentum is gained is effected by the fighter's Charisma stat, which like other stats varies between fighters. Created fighters can set their own charisma with a combination of clothes, tattoos, and jewelry; the more expensive, the better. A fighter with a good set of clothes, extensive tattoos, or laden with jewellery can often fill their momentum meter in just a few moves.\n\nWhen the momentum meter is full, a fighter can activate it, which results in a \"Blazin' Taunt\". In this state, the fighter is said to be \"Blazin\", and can pull off a \"Blazin' Move\", a powerful and brutal attack personalized for each character. A created character can learn every single Blazin' Move in the game, but can only have up to four usable at any one time.\n\nThough the game focuses on mixed fighting styles, the only way to win a fight is through Knock Out or Submission. A character can be made to submit by putting them into submission holds until the health bar of a single body part is depleted.\n\nKnock Out is achieved through a unique health bar used in the game. Health is composed of two bars, the first bar representing a fighter's consciousness and ability to fight (Displayed as an opaque light green), while underneath it is the fighter's physical wellness bar (Displayed as a semi transparent dark green). With every hit, a fighter's consciousness will fall quicker than his/her physical wellness. However, whenever a fighter is not losing health, their consciousness meter will recover up to the maximum current physical wellness. When a fighter's consciousness is lowered to a very low point, the entire health bar will turn red. This indicates that the fighter is in danger of being knocked out. Knocking out an opponent in danger requires the use of strong hits, Blazin' Moves, and environmental moves such as slamming an opponent into the wall, or achieving a double team move with a crowd member, or using a weapon (like a pipe, a bottle, a wooden bat, a shovel, etc.). It is possible to knock out an opponent by beating down their while their physical wellness remains very high. As a fight wears on, physical wellness will eventually fall low enough that when a fighter's consciousness recovers to the physical limit, it is still too low to turn green. This is sometimes known as permanent danger, meaning a fighter is permanently in danger of being knocked out.\n\nAdditionally, each fighting style has a unique way to knock out opponents in danger: streetfighters can attack with a strong punch; wrestlers can perform a strong grapple; kickboxers can complete a kick-combo; submission experts can force the enemy to submit with grapples; and martial artists can perform flying attacks.\n\nThe game's story mode follows the narrative of an unknown, player-created fighter, who is fighting his way through the New York Underground. Winning matches rewards the player with cash, which can be used in shops to buy clothes which include famous clothes lines such as Reebok, Phat Farm, Air Jordan, and even rapper Sean Combs clothing line, Sean John and many other clothing lines. As well as clothes, the fighter can get haircuts, tattoos, and jewelry from Jacob \"The Jeweler\" Arabo, as well as Development points, which can be used at the local gym, run by Henry Rollins, to increase the character's skills, or to purchase and set up new Blazin' Moves and up to two additional fighting styles.\n\nWinning matches also unlocks clubs and the fighters defeated, as well as their Blazin' Move, and often the jewelry they may wear. Created characters can have the jewelry of Sean Paul, Crack (Fat Joe), Xzibit, Crazy Legs, Lil' Flip, Def Jam Recordings, Roc-A-Fella Records, State Property, and many others (except for some particular signature pieces such as the medallions worn by Flavor Flav or modify it like Ghostface Killah's Sun God Plate Gold and Diamond piece.), the fighters may be used in Battle Mode, while their moves and jewelry may be purchased and used by the player.\n\nThe game features 67 playable characters, including real-life hip hop artists signed to Def Jam at the time, as well as original characters. \n\nThe game takes place immediately after Def Jam Vendetta. D-Mob (Chris Judge) is arrested by NYPD cops Starks and Jervis and placed in the back of their cop car when a SUV hits it, causing it to flip over on its back. D-Mob crawls out of the wreckage and boards the SUV as Starks catches a glimpse of the suspect before passing out. He later describes his appearance to Lauren. The suspect becomes the game's protagonist, named \"The Hero\".\nAt his crib, Blaze (Method Man) and Sticky Fingaz are playing video games. Praising The Hero for rescuing him, D-Mob tells Blaze and Sticky that he's in but the duo wants to see him fight. After defeating House, Blaze becomes impressed but Sticky is unimpressed. D-Mob then gives the Hero money to start fresh and begins scheduling fights for him. Wanted by the cops, Blaze gives The Hero a crib to stay in hiding. The Hero then begins to defeat numerous fighters, gaining notoriety after defeating O.E. (Omar Epps). O.E.'s defeat impresses D-Mob's fighter Ludacris. After The Hero defeats a fighter from The Limit, Blaze tells him that four female fighters are interested in him (Cindy J, Kimora Lee, Lil' Kim and Shawnna). When The Hero approaches one of them, their boyfriend Nyne attacks him. Depending on who wins, the Hero can take his girlfriend or Shaniqua becomes his girlfriend. After winning a match against Ice-T, The Hero and D-Mob are greeted by Crow (Snoop Dogg), and his henchmen: Magic, Crack, and Trejo. Warning D-Mob that Club 357 will be under his control, Crow announces he's accepting fighters in return for more cash. The announcement causes D-Mob to lose some of his clubs and several of his fighters siding with Crow, like WC.\n\nReturning to The Limit and Babylon to defeat Crow's fighters, Carmen Electra takes notice of The Hero. When the one approaches the other, the girlfriend becomes jealous and engages Electra to a fight. The winner becomes The Hero's girlfriend with mixed results. At a meeting with D-Mob, Blaze, Ludacris, N.O.R.E., The Hero, and Sticky, they agree to fight Crow's fighters to win back their clubs. D-Mob then arranges a match for Blaze to go up against Crack, but Blaze loses. Defeating many of Crow's fighters, The Hero then defeats WC at The Red Room. Celebrating their victory, Crow proposes a winner-take-all match between Crack and D-Mob's \"best man.\" D-Mob accepts and picks The Hero. Infuriated he wasn't chosen, Sticky storms off and later joins Crow. The Hero defeats Crack at Club Murder, Crow leaves the arena angrily as The Hero, Blaze, and D-Mob celebrate in his limo. As D-Mob gives The Hero a pendant and welcomes him into the family, Crow's gang attempt a drive by shooting, causing the cars to crash, and make their escape into the 125th Street Subway Station. As D-Mob and Blaze remain in the wreckage, The Hero chases down the trio as Magic and Sticky, boards a subway which leaves the station. Trejo is out of bullets and gets in a fight with The Hero; with Treigo potentially being thrown in front of a train. Returning to the limo, The Hero tries to get D-Mob out of the wreckage but D-Mob tells him and Blaze to leave as he is too injured and the cops arrive at the scene.\n\nBlaze takes D-Mob's place and tells The Hero to continue fighting Crow's fighters to win more clubs as Doc, waking up, joins in. Along with Ludacris, the trio takes control of the Terror Dome, the Syn Energy Power Plant, 7th Heaven, Hunt's Point Scrap Yard, and the Foundation. Arriving at the Chopshop, a team tournament sponsored by The Source is being held where the winning team wins a large amount of money and a customized Cadillac Escalade. After Magic approaches The Hero's girlfriend, he enters the tournament and picks either Ice-T or O.E. as his partner. Reaching the final round, the team faces Magic and the partner The Hero didn't choose as his partner and defeats them. The Hero continues to rack up wins and chips away at Crow's empire. Throughout the story, Crow threatens The Hero to leave his clubs alone while also trying to both get The Hero to join his side and/or threatens him, but fails; at one point sending Magic to threaten The Hero in a parking lot after a cage fight at the Gauntlet. Crow resorts to kidnapping The Hero's girlfriend and forcing him to retake all the clubs he has earned for D-Mob's side, an apparent betrayal that angers D-Mob's crew. Crow warns The Hero that if he tells anyone the real reason for his change of sides, The Hero's girlfriend will die.\n\nWith the last club won in a fight against Doc, before which a distraught Blaze angrily takes D-Mob's pendant from The Hero, Crow claims to have one final task for the player. The scene is moved to an empty scrapyard, where the player finds Blaze brutally beaten by Magic, the final task being to finish him off. The Hero refuses, and knocks out WC. He and Blaze then beat up Crack and Magic. Interrogating them, the Hero finds out where his girlfriend is being held, and that Crow never planned on letting her live. He and Blaze rush over to an abandoned factory, where Sticky is about to set the entire building on fire. The Hero fights Sticky and leaves him to die in the burning building. After he wins the fight, he can be seen taking his girlfriend out of the building before it collapses. She remains unconscious as The Hero tries to shake her awake, and enrages The Hero enough to confront Crow.\n\nThe Hero and Blaze confront Crow at his headquarters, backed up by Crack and WC, whose respect they earned, and the remainder of D-Mob's crew, whom Blaze had cleared The Hero's good name with. As a rumble breaks out with the crews, The Hero rushes to face Crow in a final showdown. After a brief stand off involving a gun, given to the player by a repentant Magic, The Hero decides that Crow is not worth killing. However, an enraged Crow attacks him with a knife hidden in his cane. After a final fight Crow is defeated, and is ultimately thrown out a window to his death. Having cleared his reputation and overthrown Crow, The Hero then takes a minute to reflect as Blaze gives him back his pendant.\n\nThere are features exclusive to PS2 and Xbox that are missing from the GameCube version. The player is restricted to having one voice for the main character - as opposed to the six found in other versions. Eight of the 28 available music tracks are missing. The GameCube's hardware lacks the light blur effect that permeates on the characters and arenas. Furthermore, certain 3 or 4 player arenas have reduced crowds due to the minidisc space limitations.\n\nJosh Holmes, the producer from EA Canada wanted to improve on the already well received \"Def Jam Vendetta\". The research they've done shows that veteran gamers were familiar with the game control system yet new players were intimidated by the complexity that's been used since \"\" that first appeared on the N64. The team decided to simplify the controls and make them more intuitive. \"We found that straight one-on-one fighting tended to get stale over time, no matter how polished the fighting engine was\" said Holmes. The team added secondary elements like crowds, weapons and interactive environments for the player to use as a weapon. Lastly, Holmes went on to say that individual players prefer to use their own tactics, so different classes has been implemented in unique ways to achieve a KO. \"The overall focus of the fighting system is fun, over-the-top action rather than a simulation of technical fighting\" said Holmes.\n\nAlso the create a fighter mode, a feature lacking in \"Def Jam Vendetta\", has been incorporated into the sequel as a part of the Story Mode. Holmes explains that with other successful fighting games, the convention of a sequel is to add complexity to the control system, multiplayer focus to the exclusion of all else, shallow single player, limited character customization and having a gameplay that's skewed towards the hardcore gamer. Probably the most common that's typical in fighting games like the first game is that it's empty and devoid of people. Inevitably, there's nothing going on except it's just you and your opponent. So they turned the concept on its head by filling the gap to make the fighting game more interactive and less predictable in order to keep it fresh and accessible for beginners and veterans alike.\n\nThe game received largely positive reviews. GameSpot and IGN gave it a score of 8.7 out of 10 and GameSpy and \"X-Play\" gave it a score of 4 out of 5. Alex Navarro praised the game for improving nearly every aspect from its predecessor, including the new fighting styles, character creation, and interaction with weapons and environments. Criticism generally befell on the game's camera view and frame rate issues that are found in all console versions. Additionally reviewers mentioned that the game is laden with a lot of profanity, though it works within the context of the game. Aside from the frame rate, reviewers praised the game's graphics, with both IGN and GameSpot calling them \"impressive\".\n\n\"Maxim\" gave it a score of eight out of ten and said, \"Should the lyrically challenged feel left out, you can create your own brawler outfitted in ice courtesy of celebrity bling supplier Jacob the Jeweler. Better to look good than to—\"ow\"—feel good.\" \"The Sydney Morning Herald\" also gave the game four stars out of five and said that \"The fact that it's got the deepest story ever seen in a fighter simply adds to the realistic feel of the brutal combat within.\"\n\nOn August 2018, \"Def Jam\"'s official Twitter account posted with the caption saying \"Pick a city\", along with four new locations that the new game can take place: \"Atlanta\", \"Los Angeles\", \"Chicago\", and \"Miami\". This can possibly hint at a sequel to the \"Def Jam Fight\" series coming in the near future.\n\n"}

Their emergence were often sparked by the gradual abandon of the timar system administered by the military fiefdom of sipahis, and the tendency of the central government to sub-contract tax revenues as of the 18th century, receiving a determined sum from the derebey and outsourcing on them the task of collecting from the taxpayers themselves. In official terminology, these intermediaries were often referred to as \"âyân\", although other terms were also used for describing this class whose official status, effective powers and the geographical extent of authority could greatly vary from one derebey to another, and could also evolve differently over time. The particular characteristics of their region of authority, such as economic development or its becoming an issue within contexts of international politics, also greatly influenced derebeys' destinies. While the derebeys did not seek to overthrow the Ottoman state, they did seek autonomy from the empire for themselves and their heirs. Through their collection and control of tax revenues in their region as well as only providing armed men for the sultan's wars when it benefitted their interests, the derebeys demonstrated a lack of centralized authority in the Ottoman state during the 18th and early 19th centuries.\n\nThe Russo-Turkish War of 1768-1774 saw an increase in the power and influence of the derebeys, due to the reliance of the Ottoman government on their assistance. By the end of the 18th century, during the reign of Sultan Selim III, most of Anatolia was ruled by derebeys, and their role in Ottoman affairs was prominent. Selim's successor, Mahmud II (who followed the year-long reign of Mustafa IV), oversaw the decline of the derebeys as Ottoman government became increasingly centralised and administration was conducted by appointed governors. In the 19th century, the term came to be applied to the powerful hereditary land-owners of southern and eastern Turkey. By 1866 the remaining derebeys were subjugated by a military expedition in the Çukurova region.\n\nThe derebeys gradually Ottomanized, i.e. became part in the mechanics of the central government, with the re-strengthening of the Ottoman central power in the 19th century. Many members of derebey families left lasting works serving general welfare, while others were also involved in bitter struggles that gave rise to public revolts, such as that of Atçalı Kel Mehmet Efe.\n\n\n"}

Otto ascended the German throne in 936 and Liudolf, as his designated heir and successor, received a broad education. \n\nIn 939 his father betrothed him with Ida, daughter and heiress of the Conradine duke Herman I of Swabia.

Moreover, as Adelaide was the sister of Otto's ally King Conrad I of Burgundy, the German king prepared for a campaign to Italy. Nevertheless, Liudolf forestalled his father's plans and in early 951 led a Swabian army across the Alps and invaded Lombardy. His father was displeased and foiled his plans, supported by his brother Duke Henry I of Bavaria, who considered Liudolf's campaign a violation of his interests in Northern Italy. The Swabian duke received little support by the Italian nobility and finally had to follow the approaching forces of his father, leaving him without much gain. \n\nWhen King Otto married Adelaide, the heiress to Italy, Liudolf felt his position threatened. He underlined his right of succession by lavishly celebrating Christmas 951 like a king at the \"Kaiserpfalz\" in Saalfeld and forged an alliance with his brother-in-law Duke Conrad of Lorraine. After Adelheid gave birth to a son, Liudolf raised the flag of revolt in 953. Though he had the support of his Swabians, his ally Duke Conrad the Red was opposed by his own subjects in Lorraine. The Bavarians of Duke Henry I, Liudolf's uncle, supported Liudolf, but Henry and Otto together put down the rebellion. In 954, he was deprived of his duchy and, though reconciled with his father, he did not regain it. He invaded Italy for a second time in 957 and many cities capitulated before him and Berengar fled. He died unexpectedly of fever amidst his victorious campaign at Pombia, near Novara, on September 6 and was buried in St. Alban's Abbey, Mainz.\n\nHis son by Ida, Otto, was later duke of Bavaria and Swabia, his daughter Mathilde, abbess of the Essen Abbey. He also founded the city of Stuttgart in southern Germany.\n\n"}
{"id": "2041080", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2041080", "title": "The Lost Symbol", "text": "The Lost Symbol\n\nThe Lost Symbol is a 2009 novel written by American writer Dan Brown. It is a thriller set in Washington, D.C., after the events of \"The Da Vinci Code\", and relies on Freemasonry for both its recurring theme and its major characters.\n\nReleased on September 15, 2009, it is the third Brown novel to involve the character of Harvard University symbologist Robert Langdon, following 2000's \"Angels & Demons\" and 2003's \"The Da Vinci Code\". It had a first printing of 6.5 million (5 million in North America, 1.5 million in the UK), the largest in Doubleday history. On its first day the book sold one million in hardcover and e-book versions in the U.S., the UK and Canada, making it the fastest selling adult novel in history. It was number one on the \"New York Times\" Best Seller list for hardcover fiction for the first six weeks of its release, and remained on the list for 29 weeks. As of January 2013, there were 30 million copies in print worldwide.\n\nRenowned Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon is invited to give a lecture at the United States Capitol, at the invitation apparently from his mentor, a 33rd degree Mason named Peter Solomon, who is the head of the Smithsonian Institution. Solomon has also asked him to bring a small, sealed package which he had entrusted to Langdon years earlier. When Langdon arrives at the Capitol, however, he learns that the invitation he received was not from Solomon, but from Solomon's kidnapper, Mal'akh posing as Solomon's assistant, who has left Solomon's severed right hand in the middle of the Capitol Rotunda in a recreation of the Hand of Mysteries. Mal'akh then contacts Langdon, charging him with finding both the Mason's Pyramid, which Masons believe is hidden somewhere in Washington, D.C., and the Lost Word, lest Solomon be murdered.\n\nLangdon meets Trent Anderson, head of the Capitol police, and Inoue Sato, the head of the CIA's Office of Security. Sato claims that Mal'akh poses a threat to the national security of the U.S. and that his capture is more important than Peter's rescue, although she refuses to elaborate. Examining Solomon's hand, they discover a clue leading them to Solomon's Masonic altar in a room in the Capitol's sub-basement, where they find a small pyramid lacking a capstone, with an inscription carved into it.\n\nSato then confronts Langdon with the security x-ray taken of his bag when he entered the Capitol which reveals a smaller pyramid in the package Langdon brought in response to the request by the kidnapper posing as Solomon's assistant. Langdon explains that he was unaware of its contents, but Sato, refusing to believe it, attempts to take Langdon into custody. Before she can arrest him, however, she and Anderson are assaulted by Warren Bellamy, the Architect of the Capitol and a Freemason, who then flees with Langdon in the confusion. He later explains to Langdon that he too has been in contact with Mal'akh and wants Langdon's assistance in rescuing Peter.\n\nMal'akh is revealed to be a Freemason with tattoos covering almost his entire body. He infiltrated the organization in order to obtain an ancient source of power, which he believes Langdon can unlock for him in return for Peter Solomon's life. Several chapters also delve into Mal'akh's history with Peter Solomon: many years earlier, Peter bequeathed a large sum of inheritance money to his rebellious son, Zachary, who then fled the Solomon household and led a reckless life in Europe until he was arrested and imprisoned in Turkey for smuggling drugs. Peter flew to Turkey but decided to have Zachary extradited in a week's time instead of getting him released immediately in order to teach him a lesson. Zachary was apparently murdered by his cellmate who got his hands on Zachary's fortune and fled to the island of Syros in Greece to lead a luxurious life under the name Andros Dareios. Dareios, however, soon grew tired of his life. Apparently having spoken with Zachary about Solomon's life as a Mason, Dareios broke into Solomon's home to find the pyramid, but accidentally killed Peter's mother Isabel and was in turn shot and left to fall into a frozen river by a vengeful Solomon. Surviving the fall, Dareios nursed himself back to health, covered his scars and eventually his entire body with tattoos and set off on a mission to infiltrate the Freemasons and gain access to their secrets, adopting the name Mal'akh.\n\nAs Langdon deals with the events into which he has been thrust, Mal'akh destroys the Smithonsonian-sponsored laboratory of Dr. Katherine Solomon, Peter's younger sister, where she has conducted experiments in Noetic Science, in the process ambushing and almost killing Katherine in a cat-and-mouse chase, but Katherine manages to escape and meet up with Langdon and Bellamy. Eventually, when cornered by the authorities, Bellamy is forced to give himself up while Langdon and Katherine escape. Both are later apprehended by Sato's team. Following clues regarding Mal'akh's previous identity as Peter Solomon's psychiatrist, Dr. Christopher Abaddon, Sato allows Langdon and Katherine to rush to his mansion to confront him, but Mal'akh ambushes them and murders their CIA escort. Meanwhile, as he is being interrogated by Sato, Bellamy expresses belief that Sato is working with Mal'akh but Sato assures Bellamy that she is also pursuing Mal'akh in the interest of national security and displays evidence that visibly shocks Bellamy.\n\nMal'akh places Langdon into an airtight sensory deprivation tank, where he interrogates Langdon by slowly filling the tank with liquid. He is able to convince Langdon to decipher the code at the pyramid's base, but continues to fill the tank until Langdon drowns and apparently dies. Mal'akh then ties Katherine to a chair and inserts an open-ended transfusion needle into her arm and leaves her to bleed to death then flees with a weakened and wheelchair-bound Peter Solomon to the Temple Room of the Scottish Rite's House of the Temple. He uses the threat of not calling an ambulance for Katherine as further coercion for Peter's cooperation. Sato leads a team of agents to the mansion after Langdon and Katherine's escort fails to check in and are able to save Katherine's life. After a near-death experience, Langdon is revealed to have survived due to the \"water\" in the tank actually being breathable oxygenated liquid and the tank being a device for meditation. Sato, Langdon and Simkins race to the House of the Temple where Mal'akh threatens to release a heavily edited video showing government officials performing secret Masonic rituals (the same video that Sato showed to Bellamy), which without context, appears highly disturbing. Mal'akh forces the Word—the unpronounceable circumpunct—out of Peter and tattoos it on his head on the last portion of unmarked skin on his body. Mal'akh then orders Peter to sacrifice him, as he believes that it is his destiny to become a demonic spirit and lead the forces of evil. When Peter claims that he will do so without hesitation to avenge his son and mother, Mal'akh shocks Peter by revealing that he is actually Zachary Solomon himself, having conspired with the prison warden to fake his death by disfiguring the body of another inmate beyond recognition (at the same time, Katherine and Bellamy discover several photos of Zachary in Greece after his supposed death that show his gradual transformation into Mal'akh). With tears in his eyes, Peter prepares to stab Zachary but ultimately cannot bring himself to do so and drops the knife just as Langdon arrives and tackles him. Director Sato arrives at the Temple in a helicopter, which smashes the Temple's skylight, the shards of which fatally impale Zachary. The CIA then thwart Zachary's plan to transmit the video to several leading media channels using an EMP blast, disabling a cell tower in the network path leading from Zachary's laptop computer. Katherine arrives and she and Langdon then share a tearful reunion with Peter and mourn Zachary's death. Zachary is only briefly able to lament his body's mutilation before dying.\n\nLater, Peter informs Langdon that the circumpunct Zachary tattooed on his head is not the Word. He also informs Katherine that he made back-ups of all of her noetic research data on his own computer, meaning her research can continue. Deciding to take Langdon to the true secret behind the Word, Peter leads him to the room atop the Washington Monument and tells him that the Word—a common Christian Bible, the Word of God—lies in the monument's cornerstone, buried in the ground beneath the monument's staircase. Langdon realizes that the symbols on the pyramid's base spelled out the words \"Laus Deo\" which translate to \"Praise God\". These words are inscribed on the small aluminum capstone atop the Monument, which is the true Masonic Pyramid.\n\nPeter tells Langdon that the Masons believe that the Bible is an esoteric allegory written by humanity, and that, like most religious texts around the globe, it contains veiled instructions for harnessing humanity's natural God-like qualities—similar to Katherine's noetic research—and is not meant to be interpreted as the commands of an all-powerful deity. This interpretation has been lost amid centuries of scientific skepticism and fundamentalist zealotry. The Masons have (metaphorically) buried it, believing that, when the time is right, its rediscovery will usher in a new era of human enlightenment.\n\n\n\"The Lost Symbol\" had been in development for several years; originally expected in 2006, the projected publication date was pushed back multiple times. When officially announced, the hardcopy book was on pre-order lists for months leading up to its release, being heavily ordered both in the United States and Canada. The book was published on September 15, 2009 with an initial print run of 6.5 million copies, the largest first printing in publisher Random House's history. Electronic versions such as eBook and Audible book versions were also made available on the same date. The American release audio book was read by Paul Michael, who also performed the audio book for \"The Da Vinci Code\".\n\nThe book immediately broke sales records, becoming the fastest selling adult-market novel in history, with over one million copies sold on the first day of release. By the end of the first week, a total of two million copies had been sold in the U.S., Canada, and UK. According to the publisher, the rapid sales prompted the printing of an additional 600,000 hardcover copies to the 5 million initially printed for the US market. On its first day the book became the #1 bestseller on Amazon.com, and the Amazon Kindle e-reader edition became the top-selling item on Amazon.com, outselling Amazon's sales of the hardback copy of the novel, which is the sixth best selling book of 2009 on pre-publication orders alone. \"The Lost Symbol\" also ranked as the #1 bestseller in Amazon's Canadian and British sites. Both Barnes & Noble and Waterstone's reported the book has broken all previous records for adult fiction in the United Kingdom. According to Nielsen BookScan data, 550,946 copies of \"The Lost Symbol\" were sold in its first week of sale, taking $7.49 million. By the end of the second sales week, Transworld intended to have 1.25 million copies printed.\n\nBy September 25 the book ranked #1 in the \"New York Times\" Best Seller list for hardcover fiction.\n\n\"The New York Times\" praised the book as being \"impossible to put down\" and claimed Brown is \"bringing sexy back to a genre that had been left for dead.\" Nevertheless, it noted the overuse of certain phrases and italics, as well as the lack of logic behind characters' motivations. It also likened Inoue Sato to Jar Jar Binks. \"Los Angeles Times\" said, \"Brown's narrative moves rapidly, except for those clunky moments when people sound like encyclopedias.\" \"Newsweek\" called the book \"contrived\", saying that to get through \"The Lost Symbol\", just like \"The Da Vinci Code\", it was necessary to swallow a lot of coincidences, but the book was still a page-turner, and that Brown \"is a maze maker who builds a puzzle and then walks you through it. His genius lies in uncovering odd facts and suppressed history, stirring them together into a complicated stew and then saying, \"what if?\"\" The \"National Post\"'s review called it a \"heavy-handed, clumsy thriller\" and that the character of the villain (Mal'akh) \"bears an uncomfortably close similarity\" to the Francis Dolarhyde character in Thomas Harris' 1981 novel \"Red Dragon\". The \"Daily Telegraph\" said the novel was \"not quite the literary train-wreck expected.\" \"TIME\" said the plot was fun, if bruising, but \"It would be irresponsible not to point out that the general feel, if not all the specifics, of Brown's cultural history is entirely correct. He loves showing us places where our carefully tended cultural boundaries — between Christian and pagan, sacred and secular, ancient and modern — are actually extraordinarily messy.\" Novelist William Sutcliffe's review in the \"Financial Times\" panned the book as \"a novel that asks nothing of the reader, and gives the reader nothing back\", adding that it \"is filled with cliché, bombast, undigested research and pseudo-intellectual codswallop\". The digested read by John Crace in \"The Guardian\" ends with Robert Langdon begging Dan Brown \"Please don't wheel me out again.\" Slovene philosopher and cultural critic Slavoj Žižek described the book as \"a candidate for the worst novel ever\".\n\nFollowing the worldwide successes of \"The Da Vinci Code\" in 2006 and \"Angels & Demons\" in 2009, which were both based on Brown's novels, starring Tom Hanks as Robert Langdon and produced and directed by Ron Howard, Columbia Pictures began production on a film adaptation of \"The Lost Symbol\". Hanks and Howard were expected to return for the film adaptation of \"The Lost Symbol\", along with the franchise's producers Brian Grazer and John Calley. Sony Pictures eventually hired three screenwriters for the project, beginning with Steven Knight and then hiring Brown himself. In March 2012, Danny Strong was also hired to collaborate on the adaptation.\n\nAccording to a January 2013 article in \"Los Angeles Times\", the final draft of the screenplay was due sometime in February, with pre-production expected to start in the mid-2013. In July 2013, Sony Pictures announced they would instead adapt \"Inferno\" for an October 14, 2016 release date with Howard as director, David Koepp adapting the screenplay and Hanks reprising his role as Robert Langdon.\n\nIn June of 2019, the project was announced to be re-conceived as a television series tentatively titled, \"Langdon\". The series will serve as a prequel to the film series, with Daniel Cerone serving as creator, showrunner, chief executive producer, and screenwriter. Dan Brown, Ron Howard, Brian Grazer, Francie Calfo, Samie Falvey and Anna Culp will act as additional executive producers. The show will be a co-production between Imagine Television Studios, CBS Television Studios, and Universal Television Studios and was ordered to series on NBC.\n\nThe plot reportedly revolves around a young Robert Langdon, who is hired by the CIA to solve a number of deadly puzzles when his mentor goes missing.\n\n\n\n"}

It is owned by P&Y Broadcasting Corporation. Radio Korea is a division of the Radio Korea Media Group. The station airs Korean–language programming, a blend of talk, news, information, and music for the largest Korean–American community in the United States, and the largest Korean community outside Korea. KMPC is one of four radio stations in the greater Los Angeles area that broadcast entirely in Korean. The others are 1190 KGBN Anaheim, 1230 KYPA Los Angeles and 1650 KFOX Torrance.\n\nKMPC broadcasts at 50,000 watts by day, the highest power permitted for commercial AM stations. At night, to reduce interference to other stations on AM 1540, KMPC drops its power to 37,000 watts. It uses a directional antenna at all times. The transmitter is off Carter Drive in the El Sereno district of Los Angeles.\n\nOn September 22, 1952, the station signed on with the call sign KPOL. It ran 5,000 watts and was originally a daytimer, required to be off the air at sunset. It was owned by Coast Radio Broadcasting Corporation. In 1958, it added an FM station at 93.9 MHz, KPOL-FM (now KLLI). Then in 1965, it put a television station on the air, Channel 22 KPOL-TV (now KWHY-TV).\n\nKPOL 1540 went on the air 10 minutes after receiving Federal Communications Commission (FCC) approval. The following year, its power was increased to 10,000 watts. Full time operations were added in 1958, with a power of 10,000 watts at night using a directional antenna array. Daytime power was increased to 50,000 watts in 1961.\n\nIn its early years, KPOL aired several polka music programs. That gave the station its call letters. Tom Kennedy, later a popular TV game show host, was a polka DJ on the station during this era.\n\nIn 1959, KPOL advertised on a billboard at Los Angeles's Wrigley Field, which can be seen in the television series \"Home Run Derby\".\n\nIn 1966, KPOL-AM-FM were sold to Capital Cities Broadcasting for $7.8 million.\n\nFor many years, KPOL aired an easy listening/beautiful music format on both AM and FM. In the late 1970s, the station switched to a soft adult contemporary format. In August 1978, it began carrying the syndicated \"Larry King Show\" overnight.\n\nIn 1979, the station's call sign was changed to KZLA while airing a more upbeat adult contemporary format, simulcast with 93.9 KZLA-FM. But with several other AC stations in Los Angeles, KZLA-AM-FM had trouble achieving significant ratings.\n\nIn 1980, with no country music station on FM in Los Angeles, KZLA-AM-FM flipped to a country format.\n\nIn 1984, the station was sold to Spanish Broadcasting System for $5 million. In December 1984, the station's call sign was changed to KSKQ, and it adopted a Spanish language format as \"La Super KQ\". \n\nOn August 4, 1992, its call sign was changed to KXED, and it aired a Mexican pop/contemporary format branded \"La Grande\" or The Big One. On March 29, 1996, the station's call sign was changed to KXMG. In late 1996, its format was changed from Regional Mexican to Spanish oldies.\n\nIn 1997, One on One Sports Inc. of Northbrook, Illinois, purchased the station and changed its format to sports, as an owned-and-operated network affiliate of One-on-One Sports, later known as Sporting News Radio, a nationally syndicated 24/7 sports network. On December 19, 1997, its call sign was changed to KCTD. One on One Sports also bought AM stations in the New York City and Chicago areas, so it would have its programming available in the largest, second largest and third largest radio markets.\n\nOn March 28, 2000, the call sign was changed to KMPC. In 2000, One-on-One Sports was acquired by Paul Allen's Vulcan Ventures, and ownership of KMPC was transferred to Paul Allen's Rose City Radio Corporation. The KMPC call letters had long been used in Los Angeles on AM 710 (now KSPN). On February 10, 2003, the station began to be branded \"1540 The Ticket\", concurrent with the launch of a new local morning show, hosted by Roger Lodge.\n\nThe station covered Southern California sports teams, including the San Diego Chargers. It also aired select Westwood One sports programming not carried by CBS Radio's KFWB and KLSX. Among the many Westwood One games KMPC carried include NCAA basketball, PGA Tour golf tournament updates (mostly those covered by CBS Sports television), the Masters Tournament and NFL football (including Monday Night Football on occasion).\n\nIn 2006, KMPC lost the broadcast rights to University of Southern California Trojans basketball and football to rival 710 KSPN. KMPC acquired the local broadcast rights of the University of Notre Dame's football games from Westwood One. The station also stopped covering NASCAR races after having done so for several years.\nThe station's regular talk-show hosts included Tony Bruno, who began his morning show in April 2005 following the departure of Roger Lodge; Dave Smith, Fred Roggin, and former USC football player Petros Papadakis.\n\nFormer Los Angeles Dodgers broadcaster Ross Porter filled in for Roggin in May 2005.\n\nRoger Nadel, former GM of all-news KFWB in Los Angeles, was General Manager.\n\nIn June 2006, former afternoon host and KNBC-TV sports director Fred Roggin left KMPC, resulting in a shift in the station's daily programming lineup and the addition of a new program, the Atlanta-based 2 Live Stews.\n\nOn September 5, 2006, it was announced that Sporting News Radio would be sold to American City Business Journals for an undisclosed price. In October 2006, the station fired all local on-air staff.\n\nIn 2007, the station was sold to P&Y Broadcasting for $33 million, and it began to air Korean language programming as \"Radio Korea\". In April 2013, KMPC began airing Korean language broadcasts of Los Angeles Dodgers baseball games.\n\n\n"}

Nicknamed \"Blue Faced Beast\", he ranks 17th among the 36 Heavenly Spirits, the first third of the 108 Stars of Destiny.\n\nYang Zhi is descended from Yang Ye, a general famous for his portrayal in the folk story Generals of the Yang Family, which tells of his and his descendants' patriotic deeds. Seven \"chi\" tall, Yang Zhi has red whiskers on his chin and a blue birthmark on his face which earns him the nickname \"Blue Faced Beast\". A highly skilled warrior and archer, he fights with either a long sabre or a spear. He serves as a middle-ranking officer under Grand Marshal Gao Qiu in Dongjing (東京; present-day Kaifeng, Henan), the imperial capital of the Song Empire.\n\nGao Qiu assigns Yang Zhi and several officers to escort separate convoys of rare minerals and plants, known as \"huashigang\" (花石綱), to Dongjing for decorating an imperial park of Emperor Huizong. However, Yang loses his freight when his boats capsize in the Yellow River during a storm. Fearing punishment, Yang Zhi goes on the run. When he learns that his offence is pardoned in a broad amnesty, he returns to Dongjing in the hope of being reinstated.\n\nOn the way, Yang Zhi runs into Lin Chong at Liangshan Marsh, who wants to cut off and present his head to the bandit chief Wang Lun as a ticket of enrolment. After a long fight, neither wins. Wang Lun appears, stops the fight and asks Yang Zhi to join his band. Yang Zhi declines, vowing to uphold his family's reputation.\n\nIn Dongjing, Yang Zhi tries to bribe his way back. However, Gao Qiu boots him out when Yang comes to explain his case.\n\nBroke, Yang Zhi has no choice but to sell his family heirloom, a precious sabre, at a marketplace. The sabre is rare as it could split metal and hair with ease and take lives without being stained with blood. Fascinated by the sabre, hooligan Niu Er wants to snatch it away from Yang Zhi. In the scuffle, Yang accidentally kills Niu. He surrenders himself to the local magistrate. As Niu was a public nuisance, many local residents seek lenient sentence for Yang. He is exiled to Daming Prefecture.\n\nIn Daming, Yang Zhi gains the attention of the prefect Grand Secretary Liang Shijie, who wants to tap his talents. Liang arranges for Yang Zhi to joust with Zhou Jin, one of his better warriors, confident that he would prove himself deserving of an official position. Yang Zhi beats Zhou easily. However, another officer Suo Chao, who teaches Zhou Jin martial arts, asks to contest with him. They fight intensely but neither wins. Liang, impressed by both, promotes them to the same position.\n\nLiang picks Yang Zhi to send a convoy of valuables to Dongjing as birthday gifts for his father-in-law Imperial Tutor Cai Jing. Yang and his escort party disguise themselves as traders to evade potential robbers. Yang is very demanding on the soldiers during the journey for fear of any misstep. They come to the Yellow Soil Ridge (黃泥崗), where Chao Gai and his six confederates, all disguised as date merchants, pretend to be taking a rest. Bai Sheng, posing as a wine seller, comes over the ridge. As the weather is very hot, Chao's group buys and finishes the wine in one of Bai's buckets. Not aware that the other bucket is drugged in a sleight of hand, Yang, who has been cautious, allows his men to buy and consume the drink. He too takes a sip. Soon Yang Zhi and his men are numb all over. Chao Gai and his party cart away the gifts.\n\nYang Zhi is the first to get up as he has drunk the least. Depressed, he abandons his men to avoid punishment. As Yang has been harsh to them, the soldiers lie to Liang Shijie that he has been part of the heist. Furious, Liang orders his arrest.\n\nMeanwhile, Yang Zhi meets Cao Zheng, a martial arts student of Lin Chong. Yang has dined in Cao's inn but leaves without paying as he is penniless. They fight but Cao soon realises Yang is no ordinary person. They cease fighting and become friends. Cao Zheng advises Yang to go to Mount Twin Dragons (二龍山) to join the outlaw band led by Deng Long. At the foot of the hill, Yang runs into Lu Zhishen, who could not ascend the hill with its one access road barred by Deng. Pretending to have drugged Lu, Yang and Cao Zheng take him to be presented to Deng. Fooled, Deng opens the gates. They kill Deng and seize the stronghold. Yang Zhi becomes the second-in-command at Mount Twin Dragons under Lu Zhishen.\n\nYang Zhi joins Liangshan following its battle at Qingzhou (青州; in present-day Shandong), which came after the stronghold was invited by three bandit groups including Mount Twin Dragons to jointly take on Huyan Zhuo. Huyan has come to Qingzhou after his earlier defeat by Liangshan.\n\nAfter the 108 Stars of Destiny came together in what is called the Grand Assembly, Yang Zhi is appointed as one of the Eight Tiger Cub Vanguard Generals of the Liangshan cavalry. He participates in the campaigns against the Liao invaders and rebel forces on Song territory following amnesty from Emperor Huizong for Liangshan. Yang Zhi dies of illness in the expedition against Fang La after the conquest of Dantu County (丹徒縣; in present-day Zhenjiang, Jiangsu).\n\nYang Zhi's precious sabre is a family heirloom dating to his ancestor Yang Ye. It has three unusual properties: it can slice metal as if it were mud; it can cut fine hair blown against its blade; and it takes lives without being stained with blood. When the hooligan Niu Er challenges Yang Zhi to prove these properties, Yang Zhi demonstrates the first two. But Niu insists that he kills a man, not animal, to prove the third. Yang Zhi refuses and kills Niu Er by accident in the scuffle.\n\n\n"}

Originally performing and recording in her teens, over the years Gillespie has been involved in the recording of over 45 albums, and appeared in stage productions, such as \"Jesus Christ Superstar\", and several films. Her musical output has progressed from teen pop and folk in the early part of her career, to rock in the 1970s and, more latterly, the blues.\n\nGillespie was born in Woking, Surrey, the second daughter of Anne Francis Roden (née Buxton) Winterstein Gillespie (1920–2007) and Hans Henry Winterstein Gillespie (1910–1994), a London-based radiologist of Austrian nobility. Her older sister, Nicola Henrietta St. John Gillespie, was born in 1946. Dana Gillespie was the British Junior Water Skiing Champion in 1962.\n\nShe recorded initially in the folk genre in the mid-1960s. Some of her recordings as a teenager fell into the teen pop category, such as her 1965 single \"Thank You Boy\", written by John Carter and Ken Lewis and produced by Jimmy Page. Her acting career got under way shortly afterwards, and it overshadowed her musical career in the late 1960s and 1970s.\n\nThe song \"Andy Warhol\" was originally written by David Bowie for Gillespie, who recorded it in 1971, but her version of the song was not released until 1973 on her album \"Weren't Born a Man\". Her version also featured Mick Ronson on guitar. After performing backing vocals on the track \"It Ain't Easy\" from Bowie's \"Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars\", she recorded an album produced by Bowie and Mick Ronson in 1973, \"Weren't Born a Man\". Subsequent recordings have been in the blues genre, appearing with the London Blues Band. She is also notable for being the original Mary Magdalene in the first London production of Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice's \"Jesus Christ Superstar\", which opened at the Palace Theatre in 1972. She also appeared on the Original London Cast album. During the 1980s Gillespie was a member of the Austrian Mojo Blues Band.\n\nShe is a follower of the late Indian spiritual guru Sri Sathya Sai Baba. She performed at his Indian ashram on various occasions, and has also recorded thirteen bhajan-based albums in Sanskrit.\n\nGillespie is the organiser of the annual Blues festival at Basil's Bar on Mustique in the Caribbean, for fifteen days at the end of January and it is now in its eighteenth year. The house band is the London Blues Band, which consists of Dino Baptiste (piano), Jake Zaitz (guitar), Mike Paice (saxophone), Jeff Walker (bass), and Evan Jenkins (drums) but there are also many other acts. In 2005, Mick Jagger appeared as a guest and sang songs such as: \"Honky Tonk Women\", \"Dust My Broom\" and \"Goin' Down\" but also many other Blues artists have appeared there through the years, such as Big Joe Louis, Joe Louis Walker, Billy Branch, Ronnie Wood and Donald Fagen.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2041117", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2041117", "title": "Social networking service", "text": "Social networking service\n\nA social networking service (also social networking site or social media) is an online platform which people use to build social networks or social relationships with other people who share similar personal or career interests, activities, backgrounds or real-life connections.\n\nSocial networking services vary in format and the number of features. They can incorporate a range of new information and communication tools, operating on desktops and on laptops, on mobile devices such as tablet computers and smartphones. They may feature digital photo/video/sharing and diary entries online (blogging). Online community services are sometimes considered social-network services by developers and users, though in a broader sense, a social-network service usually provides an individual-centered service whereas online community services are group-centered. Defined as \"websites that facilitate the building of a network of contacts in order to exchange various types of content online,\" social networking sites provide a space for interaction to continue beyond in person interactions. These computer mediated interactions link members of various networks and may help to both maintain and develop new social and professional relationships \n\nSocial networking sites allow users to share ideas, digital photos and videos, posts, and to inform others about online or real-world activities and events with people in their network. While in-person social networking – such as gathering in a village market to talk about events – has existed since the earliest development of towns, the web enables people to connect with others who live in different locations, ranging from across a city to across the world. Depending on the social media platform, members may be able to contact any other member. In other cases, members can contact anyone they have a connection to, and subsequently anyone that contact has a connection to, and so on. The success of social networking services can be seen in their dominance in society today, with Facebook having a massive 2.13 billion active monthly users and an average of 1.4 billion daily active users in 2017. LinkedIn, a career-oriented social-networking service, generally requires that a member personally know another member in real life before they contact them online. Some services require members to have a preexisting connection to contact other members.\n\nThe main types of social networking services contain category places (such as age or occupation or religion), means to connect with friends (usually with self-description pages), and a recommendation system linked to trust. One can categorize social-network services into four types:\n\n\nThere have been attempts to standardize these services to avoid the need to duplicate entries of friends and interests (see the FOAF standard). A study reveals that India recorded world's largest growth in terms of social media users in 2013.\nA 2013 survey found that 73% of U.S. adults use social-networking sites.\n\nThere is a variety of social networking services available online. However, most incorporate common features:\n\n\nThe variety and evolving range of stand-alone and built-in social networking services in the online space introduces a challenge of definition. Furthermore, the idea that these services are defined by their ability to bring people together and provides too broad a definition. Such a broad definition would suggest that the telegraph and telephone were social networking services – not the Internet technologies scholars are intending to describe. The terminology is also unclear, with some referring to social networking services as social media.\n\nA recent attempt at providing a clear definition reviewed the prominent literature in the area and identified four commonalities unique to current social networking services:\n\nThe potential for computer networking to facilitate newly improved forms of computer-mediated social interaction was suggested early on. Efforts to support social networks via computer-mediated communication were made in many early online services, including Usenet, ARPANET, LISTSERV, and bulletin board services (BBS). Many prototypical features of social networking sites were also present in online services such as America Online, Prodigy, CompuServe, ChatNet, and The WELL.\n\nEarly social networking on the World Wide Web began in the form of generalized online communities such as Theglobe.com (1995), Geocities (1994) and Tripod.com (1995). Many of these early communities focused on bringing people together to interact with each other through chat rooms and encouraged users to share personal information and ideas via personal web pages by providing easy-to-use publishing tools and free or inexpensive web space. Some communities – such as Classmates.com – took a different approach by simply having people link to each other via email addresses. PlanetAll started in 1996.\n\nIn the late 1990s, user profiles became a central feature of social networking sites, allowing users to compile lists of \"friends\" and search for other users with similar interests. New social networking methods were developed by the end of the 1990s, and many sites began to develop more advanced features for users to find and manage friends. Open Diary, a community for online diarists, invented both friends-only content and the reader comment, two features of social networks important to user interaction.\n\nThis newer generation of social networking sites began to flourish with the emergence of SixDegrees in 1997, followed by Open Diary in 1998, Mixi in 1999, Makeoutclub in 2000, Hub Culture in 2002, Friendster and Canada's first online social network Nexopia in 2003, and soon became part of the Internet mainstream. However, thanks to the nation's high Internet penetration rate, the first mass social networking site was the South Korean service, Cyworld, launched as a blog-based site in 1999 and social networking features added in 2001. It also became one of the first companies to profit from the sale of virtual goods. Friendster was followed by MySpace and LinkedIn a year later, and eventually Bebo. Friendster became very popular in the Pacific Islands. Orkut became the first popular social networking service in Brazil (although most of its very first users were from the United States) and quickly grew in popularity in India (Madhavan, 2007). Attesting to the rapid increase in social networking sites' popularity, by 2005, it was reported that Myspace was getting more page views than Google. Facebook, launched in 2004, became the largest social networking site in the world in early 2009. Facebook was first introduced as a Harvard social networking site, expanding to other universities and eventually, anyone. The term \"social media\" was introduced and soon became widespread.\n\nWeb-based social networking services make it possible to connect people who share interests and activities across political, economic, and geographic borders. Through e-mail and instant messaging, online communities are created where a gift economy and reciprocal altruism are encouraged through cooperation. Information is suited to a gift economy, as information is a nonrival good and can be gifted at practically no cost. Scholars have noted that the term \"social\" cannot account for technological features of the social network platforms alone. Hence, the level of network sociability should determine by the actual performances of its users. According to the communication theory of uses and gratifications, an increasing number of individuals are looking to the Internet and social media to fulfill cognitive, affective, personal integrative, social integrative, and tension free needs. With Internet technology as a supplement to fulfill needs, it is in turn affecting every day life, including relationships, school, church, entertainment, and family. Companies are using social media as a way to learn about potential employees' personalities and behavior. In numerous situations, a candidate who might otherwise have been hired has been rejected due to offensive or otherwise unseemly photos or comments posted to social networks or appearing on a newsfeed.\n\nFacebook and other social networking tools are increasingly the aims of scholarly research. Scholars in many fields have begun to investigate the impact of social networking sites, investigating how such sites may play into issues of identity, privacy,\nsocial capital, youth culture, and education. Research has also suggested that individuals add offline friends on Facebook to maintain contact and often this blurs the lines between work and home lives. According to a study in 2015, 63% of the users of Facebook or Twitter in the USA consider these networks to be their main source of news, with entertainment news being the most seen. In the times of breaking news, Twitter users are more likely to stay invested in the story. In some cases when the news story is more political, users may be more likely to voice their opinion on a linked Facebook story with a comment or like, while Twitter users will just follow the sites feed and/ or retweet the article.\n\nA 2015 study shows that 85% of people aged 18 to 34 use social networking sites for their purchase decision making. While over 65% of people aged 55 and over-rely on word of mouth. Several websites are beginning to tap into the power of the social networking model for philanthropy. Such models provide a means for connecting otherwise fragmented industries and small organizations without the resources to reach a broader audience with interested users. Social networks are providing a different way for individuals to communicate digitally. These communities of hypertexts allow for the sharing of information and ideas, an old concept placed in a digital environment. In 2011, HCL Technologies conducted research that showed that 50% of British employers had banned the use of social networking sites/services during office hours.\n\nResearch has provided us with mixed results as to whether or not a person's involvement in social networking can affect their feelings of loneliness. Studies have indicated that how a person chooses to use social networking can change their feelings of loneliness in either a negative or positive way. Some companies with mobile workers have encouraged their workers to use social networking to feel connected. Educators are using social networking to stay connected with their students whereas individuals use it to stay connected with their close relationships. Each social networking user is able to create a community that centers around a personal identity they choose to create online. In his book \"Digital Identities: Creating and Communicating the Online Self\", Rob Cover argues that social networking's foundation in Web 2.0, high-speed networking shifts online representation to one which is both visual and relational to other people, complexifying the identity process for younger people and creating new forms of anxiety. In 2016, news reports stated that excessive usage of SNS sites may be associated with an increase in the rates of depression, to almost triple the rate for non-SNS users. Experts worldwide have said that 2030 people who use SNS more have higher levels of depression than those who use SNS less. At least one study went as far as to conclude that the negative effects of Facebook usage are equal to or greater than the positive effects of face-to-face interactions.\n\nAccording to a recent article from \"Computers in Human Behavior\", Facebook has also been shown to lead to issues of social comparison. Users are able to select which photos and status updates to post, allowing them to portray their lives in acclamatory manners. These updates can lead to other users feeling like their lives are inferior by comparison. Users may feel especially inclined to compare themselves to other users with whom they share similar characteristics or lifestyles, leading to a fairer comparison. Motives for these comparisons can be associated with the goals of improving oneself by looking at profiles of people who one feels are superior, especially when their lifestyle is similar and possible. One can also self-compare to make oneself feel superior to others by looking at the profiles of users who one believes to be worse off. However, a study by the Harvard Business Review shows that these goals often lead to negative consequences, as use of Facebook has been linked with lower levels of well-being; mental health has been shown to decrease due to the use of Facebook. \"Computers in Human Behavior\" emphasizes that these feelings of poor mental health have been suggested to cause people to take time off from their Facebook accounts; this action is called “Facebook Fatigue” and has been common in recent years.\n\nUsage of social networking has contributed to a new form of bullying on social media, the communication model of interpersonal communications motives explains that a person could be embracing the motivation of escape in order to feel more powerful when the person's reality may not reflect the motivation that they are showing when they are online.\n\nAccording to Boyd and Ellison's (2007) article, \"Why Youth (Heart) Social Network Sites: The Role of Networked Publics in Teenage Social Life\", social networking sites share a variety of technical features that allow individuals to: construct a public/semi-public profile, articulate a list of other users that they share a connection with, and view their list of connections within the system. The most basic of these are visible profiles with a list of \"friends\" who are also users of the site. In an article entitled \"Social Network Sites: Definition, History, and Scholarship,\" Boyd and Ellison adopt Sunden's (2003) description of profiles as unique pages where one can \"type oneself into being\". A profile is generated from answers to questions, such as age, location, interests, etc. Some sites allow users to upload pictures, add multimedia content or modify the look and feel of the profile. Others, e.g., Facebook, allow users to enhance their profile by adding modules or \"Applications\". Many sites allow users to post blog entries, search for others with similar interests and compile and share lists of contacts. User profiles often have a section dedicated to comments from friends and other users. To protect user privacy, social networks typically have controls that allow users to choose who can view their profile, contact them, add them to their list of contacts, and so on.\n\nThere is a trend towards more interoperability between social networks led by technologies such as OpenID and OpenSocial. In most mobile communities, mobile phone users can now create their own profiles, make friends, participate in chat rooms, create chat rooms, hold private conversations, share photos and videos, and share blogs by using their mobile phone. Some companies provide wireless services that allow their customers to build their own mobile community and brand it; one of the most popular wireless services for social networking in North America and Nepal is Facebook Mobile.\n\nWhile the popularity of social networking consistently rises, new uses for the technology are frequently being observed. Today's technologically savvy population requires convenient solutions to their daily needs. At the forefront of emerging trends in social networking sites is the concept of \"real-time web\" and \"location-based\". Real-time allows users to contribute contents, which is then broadcast as it is being uploaded—the concept is analogous to live radio and television broadcasts. Twitter set the trend for \"real-time\" services, wherein users can broadcast to the world what they are doing, or what is on their minds within a 140-character limit. Facebook followed suit with their \"Live Feed\" where users' activities are streamed as soon as it happens. While Twitter focuses on words, Clixtr, another real-time service, focuses on group photo sharing wherein users can update their photo streams with photos while at an event. Facebook, however, remains the largest photo sharing site—Facebook application and photo aggregator Pixable estimates that Facebook will have 100 billion photos by Summer 2012. In April 2012, the image-based social media network Pinterest had become the third largest social network in the United States.\n\nCompanies have begun to merge business technologies and solutions, such as cloud computing, with social networking concepts. Instead of connecting individuals based on social interest, companies are developing interactive communities that connect individuals based on shared business needs or experiences. Many provide specialized networking tools and applications that can be accessed via their websites, such as LinkedIn. Others companies, such as Monster.com, have been steadily developing a more \"socialized\" feel to their career center sites to harness some of the power of social networking sites. These more business related sites have their own nomenclature for the most part but the most common naming conventions are \"Vocational Networking Sites\" or \"Vocational Media Networks\", with the former more closely tied to individual networking relationships based on social networking principles.\n\nFoursquare gained popularity as it allowed for users to check into places that they are frequenting at that moment. Gowalla is another such service that functions in much the same way that Foursquare does, leveraging the GPS in phones to create a location-based user experience. Clixtr, though in the real-time space, is also a location-based social networking site, since events created by users are automatically geotagged, and users can view events occurring nearby through the Clixtr iPhone app. Recently, Yelp announced its entrance into the location-based social networking space through check-ins with their mobile app; whether or not this becomes detrimental to Foursquare or Gowalla is yet to be seen, as it is still considered a new space in the Internet technology industry.\n\nOne popular use for this new technology is social networking between businesses. Companies have found that social networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter are great ways to build their brand image. According to Jody Nimetz, author of Marketing Jive, there are five major uses for businesses and social media: to create brand awareness, as an online reputation management tool, for recruiting, to learn about new technologies and competitors, and as a lead generation tool to intercept potential prospects. These companies are able to drive traffic to their own online sites while encouraging their consumers and clients to have discussions on how to improve or change products or services. As of September 2013, 71% of online adults use Facebook, 17% use Instagram, 21% use Pinterest, and 22% use LinkedIn.\n\nIn 2012, it was reported that in the past few years, the niche social network has steadily grown in popularity, thanks to better levels of user interaction and engagement. In 2012, a survey by Reuters and research firm Ipsos\nfound that one in three users were getting bored with Facebook and in 2014 the GlobalWebIndex found that this figured had risen to almost 50%. The niche social network offers a specialized space that's designed to appeal to a very specific market with a clearly defined set of needs. Where once the streams of social minutia on networks such as Facebook and Twitter were the ultimate in online voyeurism, now users are looking for connections, community and shared experiences. Social networks that tap directly into specific activities, hobbies, tastes, and lifestyles are seeing a consistent rise in popularity. Niche social networks such as Fishbrain for fishing and Strava for cycling. These social platforms offer brands a rich space in which to engage with their target market and build awareness.\n\nOne other use that is being discussed is the use of social networks in the science communities. Julia Porter Liebeskind et al. have published a study on how new biotechnology firms are using social networking sites to share exchanges in scientific knowledge. They state in their study that by sharing information and knowledge with one another, they are able to \"increase both their learning and their flexibility in ways that would not have been possible within a self-contained hierarchical organization\". Social networking is allowing scientific groups to expand their knowledge base and share ideas, and without these new means of communicating their theories might become \"isolated and irrelevant\". Researchers use social networks frequently to maintain and develop professional relationships. They are interested in consolidating social ties and professional contact, keeping in touch with friends and colleagues and seeing what their own contacts are doing. This can be related to their need to keep updated on the activities and events of their friends and colleagues in order to establish collaborations on common fields of interest and knowledge sharing.\n\nSocial networks are also used to communicate scientists research results and as a public communication tool and to connect people who share the same professional interests, their benefits can vary according to the discipline. The most interesting aspects of social networks for professional purposes are their potentialities in terms of dissemination of information and the ability to reach and multiple professional contacts exponentially. Social networks like Academia.edu, LinkedIn, Facebook, and ResearchGate give the possibility to join professional groups and pages, to share papers and results, publicize events, to discuss issues and create debates. Academia.edu is extensively used by researchers, where they follow a combination of social networking and scholarly norms. ResearchGate is also widely used by researchers, especially to disseminate and discuss their publications, where it seems to attract an audience that it wider than just other scientists. The usage of Research Gate and Academia in different academic communities has increasingly been studied in recent years.\n\nThe advent of social networking platforms may also be impacting the way(s) in which learners engage with technology in general. For a number of years, Prensky's (2001) dichotomy between Digital Natives and Digital Immigrants has been considered a relatively accurate representation of the ease with which people of a certain age range—in particular those born before and after 1980—use technology. Prensky's theory has been largely disproved, however, and not least on account of the burgeoning popularity of social networking sites and other metaphors such as White and Le Cornu's \"Visitors\" and \"Residents\" (2011) are greater currency. The use of online social networks by school libraries is also increasingly prevalent and they are being used to communicate with potential library users, as well as extending the services provided by individual school libraries. Social networks and their educational uses are of interest to many researchers. According to Livingstone and Brake (2010), \"Social networking sites, like much else on the Internet, represent a moving target for researchers and policymakers.\" Pew Research Center project, called Pew Internet, did a USA-wide survey in 2009 and in 2010 February published that 47% of American adults use a social networking website. Same survey found that 73% of online teenagers use SNS, which is an increase from 65% in 2008, 55% in 2006. Recent studies have shown that social network services provide opportunities within professional education, curriculum education, and learning. However, there are constraints in this area. Researches, especially in Africa, have disclosed that the use of social networks among students has been known to affect their academic life negatively. This is buttressed by the fact that their use constitutes distractions, as well as that the students tend to invest a good deal of time in the use of such technologies.\n\nAlbayrak and Yildirim (2015) examined the educational use of social networking sites. They investigated students' involvement in Facebook as a Course Management System (CMS) and the findings of their study support that Facebook as a CMS has the potential to increase student involvement in discussions and out-of-class communication among instructors and students.\n\nProfessional use of social networking services refers to the employment of a network site to connect with other professionals within a given field of interest. SNSs like LinkedIn, a social networking website geared towards companies and industry professionals looking to make new business contacts or keep in touch with previous co-workers, affiliates, and clients. LinkedIn not only provides a professional social use but also encourages people to inject their personality into their profile–making it more personal than a resume. Now the other network sites are also being used in this manner. Twitter has become [a] mainstay for professional development as well as promotion and online SNSs support both the maintenance of existing social ties and the formation of new connections. Much of the early research on online communities assume that individuals using these systems would be connecting with others outside their preexisting social group or location, liberating them to form communities around shared interests, as opposed to shared geography. Other researchers have suggested that the professional use of network sites produce \"social capital\". For individuals, social capital allows a person to draw on resources from other members of the networks to which he or she belongs. These resources can take the form of useful information, personal relationships, or the capacity to organize groups. As well, networks within these services also can be established or built by joining special interest groups that others have made, or creating one and asking others to join.\n\nAccording to Doering, Beach, and O'Brien, a future English curriculum needs to recognize a significant shift in how adolescents are communicating with each other. Curriculum uses of social networking services can also include sharing curriculum-related resources. Educators tap into user-generated content to find and discuss curriculum-related content for students. Responding to the popularity of social networking services among many students, teachers are increasingly using social networks to supplement teaching and learning in traditional classroom environments. This way they can provide new opportunities for enriching existing curriculum through creative, authentic and flexible, non-linear learning experiences. Some social networks, such as English, baby! and LiveMocha, are explicitly education-focused and couple instructional content with an educational peer environment. The new Web 2.0 technologies built into most social networking services promote conferencing, interaction, creation, research on a global scale, enabling educators to share, remix, and repurpose curriculum resources. In short, social networking services can become research networks as well as learning networks.\n\nEducators and advocates of new digital literacies are confident that social networking encourages the development of transferable, technical, and social skills of value in formal and informal learning. In a formal learning environment, goals or objectives are determined by an outside department or agency. Tweeting, instant messaging, or blogging enhances student involvement. Students who would not normally participate in class are more apt to partake through social network services. Networking allows participants the opportunity for just-in-time learning and higher levels of engagement. The use of SNSs allow educators to enhance the prescribed curriculum. When learning experiences are infused into a website student utilize everyday for fun, students realize that learning can and should be a part of everyday life. It does not have to be separate and unattached.\n\nInformal learning consists of the learner setting the goals and objectives. It has been claimed that media no longer just influence human culture; they are human culture. With such a high number of users between the ages of 13–18, a number of skills are developed. Participants hone technical skills in choosing to navigate through social networking services. This includes elementary items such as sending an instant message or updating a status. The development of new media skills are paramount in helping youth navigate the digital world with confidence.\n\nSocial networking services foster learning through what Jenkins (2006) describes as a \"participatory culture\". A participatory culture consists of a space that allows engagement, sharing, mentoring, and an opportunity for social interaction. Participants of social network services avail of this opportunity. Informal learning, in the forms of participatory and social learning online, is an excellent tool for teachers to sneak in material and ideas that students will identify with and therefore, in a secondary manner, students will learn skills that would normally be taught in a formal setting in the more interesting and engaging environment of social learning. Sites like Twitter provide students with the opportunity to converse and collaborate with others in real time.\n\nSocial networking services provide a virtual \"space\" for learners. James Gee (2004) suggests that affinity spaces instantiate participation, collaboration, distribution, dispersion of expertise, and relatedness. Registered users share and search for knowledge which contributes to informal learning.\n\nIn the past, social networking services were viewed as a distraction and offered no educational benefit. Blocking these social networks was a form of protection for students against wasting time, bullying, and invasions of privacy. In an educational setting, Facebook, for example, is seen by many instructors and educators as a frivolous, time-wasting distraction from schoolwork, and it is not uncommon to be banned in junior high or high school computer labs. Cyberbullying has become an issue of concern with social networking services. According to the UK Children Go Online survey of 9- to 19-year-olds, it was found that a third have received bullying comments online. To avoid this problem, many school districts/boards have blocked access to social networking services such as Facebook, MySpace, and Twitter within the school environment. Social networking services often include a lot of personal information posted publicly, and many believe that sharing personal information is a window into privacy theft. Schools have taken action to protect students from this. It is believed that this outpouring of identifiable information and the easy communication vehicle that social networking services open the door to sexual predators, cyberbullying, and cyberstalking. In contrast, however, 70% of social media using teens and 85% of adults believe that people are mostly kind to one another on social network sites.\n\nRecent research suggests that there has been a shift in blocking the use of social networking services. In many cases, the opposite is occurring as the potential of online networking services is being realized. It has been suggested that if schools block them [social networking services], they are preventing students from learning the skills they need. Banning social networking [...] is not only inappropriate but also borderline irresponsible when it comes to providing the best educational experiences for students. Schools and school districts have the option of educating safe media usage as well as incorporating digital media into the classroom experience, thus preparing students for the literacy they will encounter in the future.\n\nA cyberpsychology research study conducted by Australian researchers demonstrated that a number of positive psychological outcomes are related to Facebook use. These researchers established that people can derive a sense of social connectedness and belongingness in the online environment. Importantly, this online social connectedness was associated with lower levels of depression and anxiety, and greater levels of subjective well-being. These findings suggest that the nature of online social networking determines the outcomes of online social network use.\n\nSocial networks are being used by activists as a means of low-cost grassroots organizing. Extensive use of an array of social networking sites enabled organizers of 2009 National Equality March to mobilize an estimated 200,000 participants to march on Washington with a cost savings of up to 85% per participant over previous methods.\nThe August 2011 England riots were similarly considered to have escalated and been fuelled by this type of grassroots organization.\n\nA rise in social network use is being driven by college students using the services to network with professionals for internship and job opportunities. Many studies have been done on the effectiveness of networking online in a college setting, and one notable one is by Phipps Arabie and Yoram Wind published in \"Advances in Social Network Analysis.\" Many schools have implemented online alumni directories which serve as makeshift social networks that current and former students can turn to for career advice. However, these alumni directories tend to suffer from an oversupply of advice-seekers and an undersupply of advice providers. One new social networking service, Ask-a-peer, aims to solve this problem by enabling advice seekers to offer modest compensation to advisers for their time. LinkedIn is also another great resource. It helps alumni, students and unemployed individuals look for work. They are also able to connect with others professionally and network with companies.\n\nIn addition, employers have been found to use social network sites to screen job candidates.\n\nA social network hosting service is a web hosting service that specifically hosts the user creation of web-based social networking services, alongside related applications.\n\nA social trade network is a service that allows traders of financial derivatives such as contracts for difference or foreign exchange contracts to share their trading activity via trading profiles online. Their services are created by financial brokers.\n\nFew social networks charge money for membership. In part, this may be because social networking is a relatively new service, and the value of using them has not been firmly established in customers' minds. Companies such as Myspace and Facebook sell online advertising on their site. Their business model is based upon large membership count, and charging for membership would be counterproductive. Some believe that the deeper information that the sites have on each user will allow much better targeted advertising than any other site can currently provide. In recent times, Apple has been critical of the Google and Facebook model, in which users are defined as product and a commodity, and their data being sold for marketing revenue. Social networks operate under an autonomous business model, in which a social network's members serve dual roles as both the suppliers and the consumers of content. This is in contrast to a traditional business model, where the suppliers and consumers are distinct agents. Revenue is typically gained in the autonomous business model via advertisements, but subscription-based revenue is possible when membership and content levels are sufficiently high.\n\nPeople use social networking sites for meeting new friends, finding old friends, or locating people who have the same problems or interests they have, called niche networking. More and more relationships and friendships are being formed online and then carried to an offline setting. Psychologist and University of Hamburg professor Erich H. Witte says that relationships which start online are much more likely to succeed. In this regard, there are studies which predict tie strength among the friends on social networking websites. One online dating site claims that 2% of all marriages begin at its site, the equivalent of 236 marriages a day. Other sites claim one in five relationships begin online.\n\nUsers do not necessarily share with others the content which is of most interest to them, but rather that which projects a good impression of themselves. While everyone agrees that social networking has had a significant impact on social interaction, there remains a substantial disagreement as to whether the nature of this impact is completely positive. A number of scholars have done research on the negative effects of Internet communication as well. These researchers have contended that this form of communication is an impoverished version of conventional face-to-face social interactions, and therefore produce negative outcomes such as loneliness and depression for users who rely on social networking entirely. By engaging solely in online communication, interactions between communities, families, and other social groups are weakened.\n\nSpamming on online social networks is quite prevalent. A primary motivation to spam arises from the fact that a user advertising a brand would like others to see them and they typically publicize their brand over the social network. Detecting such spamming activity has been well studied by developing a semi-automated model to detect spams. For instance, text mining techniques are leveraged to detect regular activity of spamming which reduces the viewership and brings down the reputation (or credibility) of a public pages maintained over Facebook. In some online social networks like Twitter, users have evolved mechanisms to report spammers which has been studied and analyzed.\n\nPrivacy concerns with social networking services have been raised growing concerns among users on the dangers of giving out too much personal information and the threat of sexual predators. Users of these services also need to be aware of data theft or viruses. However, large services, such as Myspace and Netlog, often work with law enforcement to try to prevent such incidents. In addition, there is a perceived privacy threat in relation to placing too much personal information in the hands of large corporations or governmental bodies, allowing a profile to be produced on an individual's behavior on which decisions, detrimental to an individual, may be taken. Furthermore, there is an issue over the control of data and information that was altered or removed by the user may, in fact, be retained and passed to third parties. This danger was highlighted when the controversial social networking site Quechup harvested e-mail addresses from users' e-mail accounts for use in a spamming operation.\n\nIn medical and scientific research, asking subjects for information about their behaviors is normally strictly scrutinized by institutional review boards, for example, to ensure that adolescents and their parents have informed consent. It is not clear whether the same rules apply to researchers who collect data from social networking sites. These sites often contain a great deal of data that is hard to obtain via traditional means. Even though the data are public, republishing it in a research paper might be considered invasion of privacy.\n\nPrivacy on social networking sites can be undermined by many factors. For example, users may disclose personal information, sites may not take adequate steps to protect user privacy, and third parties frequently use information posted on social networks for a variety of purposes. \"For the Net generation, social networking sites have become the preferred forum for social interactions, from posturing and role playing to simply sounding off. However, because such forums are relatively easy to access, posted content can be reviewed by anyone with an interest in the users' personal information\". The UK government has plans to monitor traffic on social networks. As well, schemes similar to e-mail jamming have been proposed for networks such as Twitter and Facebook. These would involve \"friending\" and \"following\" large numbers of random people to thwart attempts at network analysis. Privacy concerns have been found to differ between users according to gender and personality. Women are less likely to publish information that reveals methods of contacting them. Personality measures openness, extraversion, and conscientiousness were found to positively affect the willingness to disclose data, while neuroticism decreases the willingness to disclose personal information.\n\nAnother debate lies in the design of algorithmicsystems to target specific audiences on social networking sites. With multiple formats for marketing, Facebook offers a variety of direct marketing options for advertisers to reach their intended audience. For example, these ads may appear as suggested ad posts on the home News Feed or on the right side of the feed as a banner. Businesses may create a page to outline their company and post related information, promotions and contact information to it, directly reaching their interested audience. Users who \"like\" a business page will be subscribed to receive these business' updates on their home News Feed. Banner ads and suggested posts are paid for by marketers and advertisers to reach their intended audience. Like other methods of marketing, emotional connections are critical to reaching the user. From the fourth quarter of 2012 to the fourth quarter of 2013, Facebook increased its advertising click-through rate by 365%, having 2.5 million promoted suggested posts on user's news feeds. This surge of posts resulted in an influx of information that was difficult to organize. A study of the emotional responses to advertising on Facebook found that Business Pages found the highest appeal to users because they were only recommended when liked by the user or the user's friends. “Liked” pages have higher credibility to users. However, a change in algorithm announced on April 10, 2014, said that Business Pages were receiving a reduced reach after engaging in “click bait” tactics (fooling users to click links to things other than what discretely said on Facebook). The quantity of engagement on Facebook posts are measured, relaying important information about the user audience and their actions online.\n\nThe debate questions to what extent the design of these systems is compromising the needs, privacy and information of the users. More research is needed to evaluate if allowing advertising to access user information to specifically tailor content to their choices and interactions, for example by placing ads within their personal feeds and throughout their use of the site, is compromising the user's information and social wellbeing. John Herrman (2018) compares the function of algorithms in adjusting content to omniscience and recounts the unpleasant experiences that coincide as a result. He calls to web browsing on Amazon, where products he browsed through briefly reappear on other news feeds, including his Instagram feed. He outlines the experience as if the networks “[have] got eyes everywhere,” and suggests that this looming omniscience may alter how we interact online, even “risk driving away followers in the process.” This may deter users from engaging in social interactions online and points to how much advertisers are able to tailor information to their intended audience. This debate was further ignited in early 2018. On April 10, 2018, Mark Zuckerberg testified before Congress on questions defining Facebook's policy, information handling and data design systems. Congress placed emphasis on addressing Facebook's tracking of user data online, skeptical that the social networking site can regulate itself.\n\nThrough data mining, companies are able to improve their sales and profitability. With this data, companies create customer profiles that contain customer demographics and online behavior. A recent strategy has been the purchase and production of \"network analysis software\". This software is able to sort out through the influx of social networking data for any specific company. Facebook has been especially important to marketing strategists. Facebook's controversial \"Social Ads\" program gives companies access to the millions of profiles in order to tailor their ads to a Facebook user's own interests and hobbies. However, rather than sell actual user information, Facebook sells tracked \"social actions\". That is, they track the websites a user uses outside of Facebook through a program called Facebook Beacon.\n\nThere has been a trend for social networking sites to send out only \"positive\" notifications to users. For example, sites such as Bebo, Facebook, and MySpace will not send notifications to users when they are removed from a person's friends list. Likewise, Bebo will send out a notification if a user is moved to the top of another user's friends list but no notification is sent if they are moved down the list. This allows users to purge undesirables from their list extremely easily and often without confrontation since a user will rarely notice if one person disappears from their friends list. It also enforces the general positive atmosphere of the website without drawing attention to unpleasant happenings such as friends falling out, rejection and failed relationships.\n\nMany social networking services, such as Facebook, provide the user with a choice of who can view their profile. This is supposed to prevent unauthorized users from accessing their information. Parents who want to access their child's MySpace or Facebook account have become a big problem for teenagers who do not want their profile seen by their parents. By making their profile private, teens can select who may see their page, allowing only people added as \"friends\" to view their profile and preventing unwanted viewing of the profile by parents. Most teens are constantly trying to create a structural barrier between their private life and their parents. To edit information on a certain social networking service account, the social networking sites require you to log in or provide a password. This is designed to prevent unauthorized users from adding, changing, or removing personal information, pictures, or other data.\n\nSocial networking sites have created issues among getting hired for jobs and losing jobs because of exposing inappropriate content, posting photos of embarrassing situations or posting comments that contain potentially offensive comments (e.g., racist, homophobic or defamatory comments), or even political comments that are contrary to those of the employer. There are works which recommend friends to social networking users based on their political opinions. Many people use social networking sites to express their personal opinions about current events and news issues to their friends. If a potential applicant expresses personal opinions on political issues or makes potentially embarrassing posts online on a publicly available social networking platform, employers can access their employees' and applicants' profiles, and judge them based on their social behavior or political views. According to \"Silicon Republic's\" statistics, 17,000 young people in six countries were interviewed in a survey. 1 in 10 people aged 16 to 34 have been rejected for a job because of comments made on an online profile. This shows the effects that social networks have had on people's lives. There have been numerous cases where employees have lost jobs because their opinions represented their companies negatively. In September 2013, a woman got fired over Facebook because she posted disruptive information about her company stating that military patrons should not receive special treatment or discounts. A manager of the company found her opinion online, disagreed with it, and fired her because it went against the company's mission statement. In November 2012, a woman posted a racist remark about the President of the United States and mentioned a possible assassination. She lost her job, and was put under investigation by the Secret Service.\n\nNot only have employees lost their jobs in the United States, but it has happened with social network users internationally. In April 2011, a Lloyd's banking group employee in the United Kingdom was fired for making a sarcastic post about the higher salary of her boss in relation to hers. In February 2013 there was another case where a flight attendant working for a Russian airline lost her job because she posted a photo of herself giving the middle finger to a plane full of passengers. The photo went viral exposing it all over the Internet. In November 2009, a woman working for IBM in Quebec, Canada, lost her company's health insurance benefits because she posted photos displaying her mental health problem. The company decided to cut her benefits because it was costing them additional funds.\n\nCases like these have created some privacy implications as to whether or not companies should have the right to look at employees' social network profiles. In March 2012, Facebook decided they might take legal action against employers for gaining access to employee's profiles through their passwords. According to Facebook Chief Privacy Officer for policy, Erin Egan, the company has worked hard to give its users the tools to control who sees their information. He also said users shouldn't be forced to share private information and communications just to get a job. According to the network's Statement of Rights and Responsibilities, sharing or soliciting a password is a violation to Facebook. Employees may still give their password information out to get a job, but according to Erin Egan, Facebook will continue to do their part to protect the privacy and security of their users.\n\nThe relative freedom afforded by social networking services has caused concern regarding the potential of its misuse by individual patrons. In October 2006, a fake MySpace profile created in the name of Josh Evans by Lori Janine Drew led to the suicide of Megan Meier. The event incited global concern regarding the use of social networking services for bullying purposes. In July 2008, a Briton and a former friend was ordered to pay a total of GBP £22,000 (about US$44,000) for libel and breach of privacy. He had posted a fake page on Facebook purporting to be that of a former school friend Matthew Firsht, with whom he had fallen out in 2000. The page falsely claimed that Firsht was homosexual and that he was dishonest.\n\nAt the same time, genuine use of social networking services has been treated with suspicion on the ground of the services' misuse. In September 2008, the profile of Australian Facebook user Elmo Keep was banned by the site's administrators on the grounds that it violated the site's terms of use. Keep is one of several users of Facebook who were banned from the site on the presumption that their names aren't real, as they bear resemblance to the names of characters like Sesame Street's Elmo.\n\nOnline social networks have also become a platform for spread of rumors, one such study has analyzed rumors in retrospect. One of the approaches to detect rumors (or misinformation) is to compare the spread of topic over social network (say Twitter) with those spread by reliable and authorized news agencies.\n\nThere are different forms where user data in social networks are accessed and updated without a user's permission. One study highlighted that the most common incidents included inappropriate comments posted on social networking sites (43%), messages sent to contacts that were never authored (25%) and change of personal details (24%). The most incidents are carried out by the victim's friends (36%) or partners (21%) and one in ten victims say their ex-partner has logged into their account without prior consent. The survey found that online social network accounts had been subject to unauthorized access in 60 million cases in 2011.\n\nCitizens and governments have been concerned with the misuse of social networking services by children and teenagers, in particular in relation to online sexual predators. For instance, there is a study which suggests the children are not too far from inappropriate content on YouTube. Overuse of social networking may also make children more susceptible to depression and anxiety. Governments are taking action to better understand the problem and find some solutions. A 2008 panel concluded that technological fixes such as age verification and scans are relatively ineffective means of apprehending online predators. In May 2010, a child pornography social networking site with hundreds of members was dismantled by law enforcement. It was deemed \"the largest crimes against children case brought anywhere by anyone\". Girls in particular are also known to be at more of risk online using social networks than boys. According to the article, High Tech or High Risks: Moral Panics About Girls Online, it suggests that young girls are more at risks because they are often represented through \"products of play\" in transgressive poses because they often manipulate other users online by making themselves look older than what they actually appear which can attract sexual predators. Many parents of teenage girls worry about their safety online because of the many manipulations there are online and on social networking sites.\n\nSocial networking can also be a risk to child safety in another way; parents can get addicted to games and neglect their children. One instance in South Korea resulted in the death of a child from starvation. Law enforcement agencies have published articles with their recommendations to parents about their children's use of social networking sites.\n\nSocial networking sites such as Facebook are occasionally used to emotionally abuse, harass or bully individuals, either by posting defamatory statements or by forwarding private digital photos or videos that can have an adverse impact on the individuals depicted in the videos. Such actions are often referred to as \"trolling\". Confrontations in the real world can also be transferred to the online world. Trolling can occur in many different forms, such as (but not limited to) defacement of deceased person(s) tribute pages, name-calling, playing online pranks on individuals and making controversial or inflammatory comments with the intention to cause anger and cause arguments. Individuals troll for many reasons. The psychology behind why people troll according to \"Psychology Today\" is due to anonymity, perceived obscurity, and a perceived lack of consequences for online misbehavior. Trolls may also do their activities due to a perceived majority status, social identity salience and due to a sense by the troll that she or he is surrounded by online 'friends'. Trolls may also engage in harmful acts due to desensitization or negative personality traits (Fox, 2014). As these eight reasons behind the thought processes of trolls suggest individuals thrive behind being able to create a false identity or pseudonym to hide behind and the premise that they have 'friends' on social networks that agree with their outlook on certain topics, thus join in on trolling. The reason for the perceived lack of consequences is that they believe they have created an identity in which they can not be seen as a real life human and more of a persona/avatar that they have created, which leads them to feel that they will not face the consequences of being an online troll.\n\nTrolling is a prominent issue in the 2010s, and as the Internet and social media is consistently expanding and more individuals sign up to social networking sites, more people come under fire and become the target of trolls. As more people sign up to social networking sites, more celebrities are also becoming more prominent on these sites. With a variety of celebrities joining social networking sites, trolls tend to target abuse towards them. With some famous people gaining an influx of negative comments and slew of abuse from trolls it causes them to 'quit' social media. One prime example of a celebrity quitting social media is Stephen Fry. He left Twitter due to \"too much aggression and unkindness around\" emphasizing how trolls can negatively impact people's lives (Cohen, 2014). As celebrities face trolls and backlash on social media forcing them to quit, it can mean that they become less in touch with their fans, potentially losing a fan base, as they are not as relevant as people enjoy interacting with celebrities and makes them feel as though they are valued. As trolling can lead to celebrities deleting their social networks such as Twitter, it emphasizes how trolls can win, and can ruin people's lives.\n\nWhile trolls believe that they do not face consequences and can troll others on the Internet without repercussions, in the 2000s, due to high-profile cases where cyberbullies have allegedly been factors in suicides attributed to bullying, more laws have been put in place by governments. Trolls can face going to prison for certain actions that they take on the Internet, such as spreading hate speech such as racist messages. One of the highest profile cases is racist trolling. Racist trolling has seen individuals been sent to prison for Tweets they have sent that to them may have seemed harmless and not racist. One case of this in recent years is Liam Stacey who was jailed for fifty-six days for tweeting offensive messages such as 'Muamba is dead, hahahaha', referring to when footballer Fabrice Muamba collapsed during a professional football game for Bolton Wanders (Williams, 2012). This highlights how offensive tweets and messages sent on any social networking platform does have repercussions for individuals and they have to be aware that they have to face the consequences of their actions.\n\nOnline bullying, also called cyberbullying, is a relatively common occurrence and it can often result in emotional trauma for the victim. Depending on the networking outlet, up to 39% of users admit to being \"cyber-bullied\". In her article, \"Why Youth (Heart) Social Network Sites\", danah boyd, published in December 2007, a researcher of social networks, quotes a teenager. The teenager expresses frustration towards networking sites like MySpace because it causes drama and too much emotional stress. There are not many limitations as to what individuals can post when online. Individuals are given the power to post offensive remarks or pictures that could potentially cause a great amount of emotional pain for another individual.\n\nInterpersonal communication has been a growing issue as more and more people have turned to social networking as a means of communication. \"Benniger (1987) describes how mass media has gradually replaced interpersonal communication as a socializing force. Further, social networking sites have become popular sites for youth culture to explore themselves, relationships, and share cultural artifacts\".\n\nThe convenience that social network sites give users to communicate with one another can also damage their interpersonal communication. Sherry Turkle, the founder and director of the MIT Initiative on Technology and Self, stated, \"Networked, we are together, but so lessened are our expectations of each other that we feel utterly alone. And there is the risk that we come to see others as objects to be accessed--and only for the parts we find useful, comforting, or amusing\". Furthermore, social network sites can create insincere friendships, Turkle also noted, \"They nurture friendships on social-networking sites and then wonder if they are among friends. They become confused about companionship\".\n\nAs social networking sites have risen in popularity over the past years, people have been spending an excessive amount of time on the Internet in general and social networking sites in specific. This has led researchers to debate the establishment of Internet addiction as an actual clinical disorder.\nSocial networking can also affect the extent to which a person feels lonely. In a \"Newsweek\" article, Johannah Cornblatt explains \"Social-networking sites like Facebook and MySpace may provide people with a false sense of connection that ultimately increases loneliness in people who feel alone.\" John T. Cacioppo, a neuroscientist at the University of Chicago, claims that social networking can foster feelings of sensitivity to disconnection, which can lead to loneliness. Fabio Sabatini and Francesco Sarracino found that if an individual tends to (a) trust people and (b) have a significant number of face-to-face interactions, the individual is likely to assess their own well-being as relatively high. The researchers found that online social networking plays a positive role in subjective well-being when the networking is used to facilitate physical interactions, but networking activities that do not facilitate face-to-face interactions tend to erode trust, and this erosion can then negatively affect subjective well-being (independent of the online social interaction itself). Sabatini and Sarracino conclude that \"The overall effect of networking on individual welfare is significantly negative.\"\n\nHowever, some scholars have expressed that concerns about social networking are often exaggerated and poorly researched. Social Media can be argued to have a positive influence on society by giving those who are highly introverted or socially inept a low risk means of communication that removes interpersonal cues that could cause anxiety or panic attacks. It has also been argued among academics that correct moderation by an authority figure such as a boss or parent can improve the perceived well being of an individual who navigates social media. As well as a variety of longitudinal studies that look at children at the start of the social media digital era up to the present, finding no correlation between social media screen time and mental health.\n\nThere has been rapid growth in the number of U.S. patent applications that cover new technologies related to social networking. The number of published applications has been growing rapidly since 2003. There are now over 3,500 published applications. As many as 7,000 applications may be currently on file including those that haven't been published yet. Only about 400 of these applications have issued as patents, however, due largely to the multi-year backlog in examination of business method patents and the difficulty in getting these patent applications allowed.\n\nIt has been reported that social networking patents are important for the establishment of new start-up companies. It has also been reported, however, that social networking patents inhibit innovation. On June 15, 2010, the United States Patent and Trademark Office awarded Amazon.com a patent for a \"Social Networking System\" based on its ownership of PlanetAll. The patent describes a Social Networking System as:\n\nA networked computer system provides various services for assisting users in locating, and establishing contact relationships with, other users. For example, in one embodiment, users can identify other users based on their affiliations with particular schools or other organizations. The system also provides a mechanism for a user to selectively establish contact relationships or connections with other users, and to grant permissions for such other users to view personal information of the user. The system may also include features for enabling users to identify contacts of their respective contacts. In addition, the system may automatically notify users of personal information updates made by their respective contacts.\nThe patent has garnered attention due to its similarity to the popular social networking site Facebook.\n\nWhat types of speech workers are protected from being fired for on social networking websites has been an issue for American companies with over 100 complaints as of 2011 on this topic having been made to the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB). The National Labor Relations Act protects workers from being fired for \"protected concerted activity\", which prevents workers from being fired for collective action, while allowing companies the right to fire workers for individual actions they take against the company. Companies are concerned with the potential damage comments online can do to public image due to their visibility and accessibility, but despite over 100 cases being presented thus far to NLRB only one has led to a formal ruling, leaving uncertainty as to the boundaries of what types of speech the NLRB will ultimately protect or condemn.\n\nMost of the existing SNS sites use one or multiple dedicated data centers to serve all its users. Such infrastructure-based systems faces over-provisioning during non-peak hours, while may encounter service outage during peak hours, due to the highly dynamic of SNS users' activities. There are several proposals, leveraging a decentralized architecture to ensure the scalability of SNS sites with low infrastructure cost. These proposals include Fethr, uaOSN, and Cuckoo.\n\nThere is a growing number of social network users who decide to quit their user account by committing a so-called virtual identity suicide or Web 2.0 suicide. A 2013 study in the journal \"Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking\" investigated this phenomenon from the perspective of Facebook users. The number one reason for these users was privacy concerns (48%), being followed by a general dissatisfaction with the social networking website (14%), negative aspects regarding social network friends (13%) and the feeling of getting addicted to the social networking website (6%). Facebook quitters were found to be more concerned about privacy, more addicted to the Internet and more conscientious.\n\nSites such as Facebook are becoming increasingly popular tools for methods of ending relationships and friendships, proving that although new media is being used as a tool for connecting with individuals, it is now creating new problems associated with disconnecting from others. Instead of the traditional phone call or face-to-face interaction between individuals, people are now starting to end relationships by simply changing their relationship status, knowing full well that their partner will soon see it. The problem with that is that you are left with no closure and the entire online world now knows you are no longer in a relationship. In a 2010 study conducted online, nearly one-quarter of the 1,000 individuals surveyed found out that their own relationship was over by seeing it on Facebook. New media websites have made our private lives much more public, especially when it comes to breaking up, since updates are able to be immediately viewed by everyone in our networks (which tend to be more people than we would normally tell personally); for example, having friends comment on your newly changed \"single\" relationship status, and having to explain what happened can be distressing.\n\nThis creates further problems, as it is even more crucial to 'save face' after one's relationship has been broken when one is connected to new media technologies. Erving Goffman argues that all social life boils down to face-to-face interactions. These interpersonal interactions are mediated by what Goffman terms as \"face-work\", which are the actions undertaken to maintain consistency with one's face and to uphold the expressive order of social situations. Individuals attempt to keep a positive image of the self when interacting with others, and in order to do so, they may have to alter their appearance or manner in some way. Such face-work can also be seen in new technologies, especially social media websites such as Facebook. If someone breaks up with you, you can actively choose what \"face\" you want to present to your friends, including your ex. You can choose to either post sad updates, which is the most natural thing you would want to do, or you can \"save face\" by posting happy updates and pictures of you going out with your friends. Even though you may be absolutely heartbroken within, Facebook allows you to hide your true feelings from the online world, and from your ex, by manipulating your profile. New media is being utilized as a tool for helping users present a desirable image of themselves, enabling them to save face in difficult situations. Nearly 35% of respondents in a study admitted to using their Facebook status to make someone think that they had plans, even if they did not.\n\nMany people find that the only way to really move on from a past relationship is to cut the person out of their life completely. Social media has made this process much more complicated and difficult. In a 2012 study, 48% of the participants stated they had remained friends with their ex on Facebook, and of these people, 88% stated they 'creeped' their ex after the breakup. Many digital social networking sites leave behind a trail of a user's interactions, so deleting content may be an arduous process, more difficult than simply burning or throwing away an entire box of letters, photos, and mementos. Additionally, this content can still remain online.\n\nThe increasing number of messages and social relationships embedded in SNS also increases the amount of social information demanding a reaction from SNS users. Consequently, SNS users perceive they are giving too much social support to other SNS friends. This dark side of SNS usage is called 'social overload'. It is caused by the extent of usage, number of friends, subjective social support norms, and type of relationship (online-only vs offline friends) while age has only an indirect effect. The psychological and behavioral consequences of social overload include perceptions of SNS exhaustion, low user satisfaction, and high intentions to reduce or stop using SNS.\n\nSmartphones and social networking services enable us to stay connected continuously with people around us or far away from us, which however is sometimes the root of our anxiety in social life. The eager to know what everyone was saying and the tendency to see if anyone shared new things are typical \"symptoms\" of this anxiety called FoMO. There is a study that examined possible connections between FOMO and social media engagement indicating that FoMO was associated with lower need satisfaction, mood and life satisfaction.\n\nAnother type of social anxiety is the FoBM (fear of being missed). It comes from the situation that we can't produce share-content for people to consume. The FoBM is a counterpart of FoMO; however, compared to FoMO it may have a more serious impact since the exclusion from the conversation can result in continuous exclusion later.\n\nThe number of contacts on a social platform is sometimes considered an indicator of social capital. However, studies show it is rather an indicator of low self-esteem and of a form of social compensation. Indeed, people tend to add friends to compensate low self-esteem and there is a high correlation between the number of \"friends\" on social media platforms and feeling social anxiety, leading to symptoms of major depression and dysthymia. If we consider this aspect with regards to the relationships maintained through social media platforms, we can easily point out a change in our understanding of friendship. As a matter of fact, online platforms and social media services altered the old definition of friendship. Indeed, friendship \"redoubleth joys, and cutteth griefs in halves\" as stated by Francis Bacon. However, nowadays we see that Facebook friends, for instance, encourage negative feelings, such as envy, revenge and sadness.\n\nWhen it comes to friendship, we can wonder whether friendship on online platforms is a real form of friendship, or it is just a sort of metaphor to compensate for social communication problems. Actually, a lot of changes can be spotted in its old definition compared to the one in the era of social media. Friendship used to relate to the public sphere as explained in \"Nicomachean Ethics\", however nowadays friendship is rather exposed publicly on different social media platforms.\nCroom et al. found that Facebook users know only a bit more than two thirds of their \"friends\" on the platform, meaning that they did not know one-third of the individuals in their friend-lists. This raises security and privacy issues and the project researchers alerted participants that they would better unfriend people they did not recognize.\n\nSocial networking services are increasingly being used in legal and criminal investigations. Information posted on sites such as MySpace and Facebook has been used by police (forensic profiling), probation, and university officials to prosecute users of said sites. In some situations, content posted on MySpace has been used in court.\n\nFacebook is increasingly being used by school administrations and law enforcement agencies as a source of evidence against student users. This site being the number one online destination for college students, allows users to create profile pages with personal details. These pages can be viewed by other registered users from the same school, which often include resident assistants and campus police who have signed up for the service. One UK police force has sifted pictures from Facebook and arrested some people who had been photographed in a public place holding a weapon such as a knife (having a weapon in a public place is illegal).\n\nSocial networking is more recently being used by various government agencies. Social networking tools serve as a quick and easy way for the government to get the suggestion of the public and to keep the public updated on their activity, however this comes with a significant risk of abuse, for example, to cultivate a culture of fear such as that outlined in \"Nineteen Eighty-Four\" or \"THX-1138\".\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control demonstrated the importance of vaccinations on the popular children's site Whyville and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has a virtual island on Second Life where people can explore caves or explore the effects of global warming. Likewise, NASA has taken advantage of a few social networking tools, including Twitter and Flickr. The NSA is taking advantage of them all. NASA is using such tools to aid the Review of U.S. Human Space Flight Plans Committee, whose goal it is to \"ensure that the nation is \"on a vigorous and sustainable path to achieving its boldest aspirations in space\".\n\nThe use of social networking services in an enterprise context presents the potential of having a major impact on the world of business and work . Social networks connect people at low cost; this can be beneficial for entrepreneurs and small businesses looking to expand their contact bases. These networks often act as a customer relationship management tool for companies selling products and services. Companies can also use social networks for advertising in the form of banners and text ads. Since businesses operate globally, social networks can make it easier to keep in touch with contacts around the world. Applications for social networking sites have extended toward businesses and brands are creating their own, high functioning sites, a sector known as brand networking. It is the idea that a brand can build its consumer relationship by connecting their consumers to the brand image on a platform that provides them relative content, elements of participation, and a ranking or score system. Brand networking is a new way to capitalize on social trends as a marketing tool. The power of social networks is beginning to permeate into internal culture of businesses where they are finding uses for collaboration, file sharing and knowledge transfer. The term \"enterprise social software\" is becoming increasingly popular for these types of applications.\n\nMany social networks provide an online environment for people to communicate and exchange personal information for dating purposes. Intentions can vary from looking for a one time date, short-term relationships, and long-term relationships. Most of these social networks, just like online dating services, require users to give out certain pieces of information. This usually includes a user's age, gender, location, interests, and perhaps a picture. Releasing very personal information is usually discouraged for safety reasons. This allows other users to search or be searched by some sort of criteria, but at the same time, people can maintain a degree of anonymity similar to most online dating services. Online dating sites are similar to social networks in the sense that users create profiles to meet and communicate with others, but their activities on such sites are for the sole purpose of finding a person of interest to date. Social networks do not necessarily have to be for dating; many users simply use it for keeping in touch with friends, and colleagues.\n\nHowever, an important difference between social networks and online dating services is the fact that online dating sites usually require a fee, where social networks are free.\nThis difference is one of the reasons the online dating industry is seeing a massive decrease in revenue due to many users opting to use social networking services instead. Many popular online dating services such as Match.com, Yahoo Personals, and eHarmony.com are seeing a decrease in users, where social networks like MySpace and Facebook are experiencing an increase in users. The number of Internet users in the United States that visit online dating sites has fallen from a peak of 21% in 2003 to 10% in 2006. Whether it is the cost of the services, the variety of users with different intentions, or any other reason, it is undeniable that social networking sites are quickly becoming the new way to find dates online.\n\nThe National School Boards Association reports that almost 60% of students who use social networking talk about education topics online, and more than 50% talk specifically about schoolwork. Yet the vast majority of school districts have stringent rules against nearly all forms of social networking during the school day—even though students and parents report few problem behaviors online. Social networks focused on supporting relationships between teachers and their students are now used for learning, educators professional development, and content sharing. HASTAC is a collaborative social network space for new modes of learning and research in higher education, K-12, and lifelong learning; Ning supports teachers; TermWiki, TeachStreet and other sites are being built to foster relationships that include educational blogs, portfolios, formal and ad hoc communities, as well as communication such as chats, discussion threads, and synchronous forums. These sites also have content sharing and rating features. Social networks are also emerging as online yearbooks, both public and private. One such service is MyYearbook, which allows anyone from the general public to register and connect. A new trend emerging is private label yearbooks accessible only by students, parents, and teachers of a particular school, similar to Facebook's beginning within Harvard.\n\nThe use of virtual currency systems inside social networks create new opportunities for global finance. Hub Culture operates a virtual currency Ven used for global transactions among members, product sales and financial trades in commodities and carbon credits. In May 2010, carbon pricing contracts were introduced to the weighted basket of currencies and commodities that determine the floating exchange value of Ven. The introduction of carbon to the calculation price of the currency made Ven the first and only currency that is linked to the environment.\n\nSocial networks are beginning to be adopted by healthcare professionals as a means to manage institutional knowledge, disseminate peer to peer knowledge and to highlight individual physicians and institutions. The advantage of using a dedicated medical social networking site is that all the members are screened against the state licensing board list of practitioners. A new trend is emerging with social networks created to help its members with various physical and mental ailments. For people suffering from life-altering diseases or chronic health conditions, companies such as HealthUnlocked and PatientsLikeMe offers their members the chance to connect with others dealing with similar issues and share experiences. For alcoholics and addicts, SoberCircle gives people in recovery the ability to communicate with one another and strengthen their recovery through the encouragement of others who can relate to their situation. DailyStrength is also a website that offers support groups for a wide array of topics and conditions, including the support topics offered by PatientsLikeMe and SoberCircle. Some social networks aim to encourage healthy lifestyles in their users. SparkPeople and HealthUnlocked offer community and social networking tools for peer support during weight loss. Fitocracy and QUENTIQ are focused on exercise, enabling users to share their own workouts and comment on those of other users. Other aspects of social network usage include the analysis of data coming from existing social networks (such as Twitter) to discover large crowd concentration events (based on tweets location statistical analysis) and disseminate the information to e.g. mobility-challenged individuals for e.g. avoiding the specific areas and optimizing their journey in an urban environment.\n\nSocial networking sites have recently showed a value in social and political movements. In the Egyptian revolution, Facebook and Twitter both played an allegedly pivotal role in keeping people connected to the revolt. Egyptian activists have credited social networking sites with providing a platform for planning protest and sharing news from Tahrir Square in real time. By presenting a platform for thousands of people to instantaneously share videos of mainly events featuring brutality, social networking can be a vital tool in revolutions. On the flip side, social networks enable government authorities to easily identify, and repress, protestors and dissidents. Another thing that social media helps with in political applications is getting the younger generations involved in politics and ongoing political issues.\n\nPerhaps the most significant political application of social media is Barack Obama's election campaign in 2008. It was the first of its kind, as it successfully incorporated social media into its campaign winning strategy, evolving the way of political campaigns forevermore in the ever-changing technological world we find ourselves in today. His campaign won by engaging everyday people and empowering volunteers, donors, and advocates, through social networks, text messaging, email messaging and online videos. Obama's social media campaign was vast, with his campaign boasting 5 million 'friends' on over 15 social networking sites, with over 3 million friends just on Facebook. Another significant success of the campaign was online videos, with nearly 2,000 YouTube videos being put online, receiving over 80 million views.\n\nIn 2007, when Obama first announced his candidacy, there was no such thing as an iPhone or Twitter. However, a year later, Obama was sending out voting reminders to thousands of people through Twitter, showing just how fast social media moves. Obama's campaign was current and needed to be successful in incorporating social media, as social media acts best and is most effective in real time.\n\nBuilding up to the 2012 presidential election, it was interesting to see how strong the influence of social media would be following the 2008 campaigns, where Obama's winning campaign had been social media-heavy, whereas McCain's campaign did not really grasp social media. JFK was the first president who really understood television, and similarly, Obama is the first president to fully understand the power of social media. Obama has recognized social media is about creating relationships and connections and therefore used social media to the advantage of presidential election campaigns, in which Obama has dominated his opponents in terms of social media space.\n\nOther political campaigns have followed on from Obama's successful social media campaigns, recognizing the power of social media and incorporating it as a key factor embedded within their political campaigns, for example, Donald Trump's presidential electoral campaign, 2016. Dan Pfeiffer, Obama's former digital and social media guru, commented that Donald Trump is \"way better at the internet than anyone else in the GOP which is partly why he is winning\".\n\nResearch has shown that 66% of social media users actively engage in political activity online, and like many other behaviors, online activities translate into offline ones. With research from the 'MacArthur Research Network on Youth and Participatory Politics' stating that young people who are politically active online are double as likely to vote than those who are not politically active online. Therefore, political applications of social networking sites are crucial, particularly to engage with the youth, who perhaps are the least educated in politics and the most in social networking sites. Social media is, therefore, a very effective way in which politicians can connect with a younger audience through their political campaigns.\n\nCrowdsourcing social media platform, such as Design Contest, Arcbazar, Tongal, combined group of professional freelancers, such as designers, and help them communicate with business owners interested in their suggestion. This process is often used to subdivide tedious work or to fund-raise startup companies and charities, and can also occur offline.\n\nThere are a number of projects that aim to develop free and open source software to use for social networking services. These technologies are often referred to as social engine or social networking engine software.\n\nThe following is a list of the largest social networking services, in order by number of active users, as of April 2020, as published by Statista (figures for Douban and Linkedin are from October 2019):\n\n\n\n"}

Apple II's hi-res display pages (Hi-Res 1: 280 × 160 and Hi-Res 2: 280 × 192) were implemented by Steve Wozniak using two TTL chips. Therefore a software programmer has to deal with the discontinuous addressing of screen pixels (a full screen is split into three parts horizontally) and each pixel's coloring properties (each pixel uses 1-bit, its color is determined by that bit's place in a byte and its neighboring pixel).

Publications have documented Quechan grammar and texts.\n\nIn 1980, it was estimated that there were fewer than 700 speakers of the language, including both the elderly and young. Hinton (1994:32) put a conservative estimate of the number of speakers at 150, and a liberal estimate at 400-500. As of 2009, 93 preschoolers were learning Quechan in the Quechan tribe's language preservation program, and the number of fluent speakers was estimated to be about 100. A Quechan dictionary was in progress.\n\nQuechan speakers participate in the Yuman Family Language Summit, held annually since 2001.\n\nA 2010 documentary, “Songs of the Colorado,” by filmmaker Daniel Golding features traditional songs in the Quechan language. Golding says, \"The songs are all sung in the language, so if you're not learning and picking up the language, then you won't be able to understand the songs ... there are actually words telling stories...\" \n\nAssistance is available for speakers of the language who wish to vote in elections in Imperial County, California and Yuma County, Arizona, under Section 203 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.\n\nQuechan has five vowel phonemes, which all occur in short and long forms. Vowel length is contrastive, as shown in \"ʔa·vé\" \"snake\" versus \"ʔa·vé·\" \"mouse\".\nThe consonants in Quechan are given in the table below.\nQuechan features word-medial and word-final consonant clusters. Word-medial clusters may be biconsonantal or triconsonantal, while word-final clusters only appear with two consonants.\n\nThe semivowels w and j occur as consonants when in a word-initial position, when intervocalic, and as final members of consonant clusters. They occur as vowels when in the word-final position and as initial members of vowel clusters.\n\nA variety of processes affect the realization of sounds in Quechan, a few of which are listed below. \n\nQuechan words consist of two immediate constituents: a theme and non-thematic elements. Themes are structures consisting of unanalyzable root morphemes that form the basis of Quechan words. Themes can consist of stems in isolation, reduplicated, or affixed. \n\nWords usually include one or more nonthematic affixes which can be either nominal or verbal. Themes can be split into noun themes, verbal themes and interjectional themes. Nouns are words composed of noun themes and nominal affixes, verbs are words composed of verbal themes and verbal affixes, and interjections are themes with no affixes added.\n\nQuechan nouns consist of a theme alone or a theme plus non thematic affixes. The primary function of a noun is to convey simple referential content. There are four types of nonthematic elements that can be affixed to nouns: pronominal prefixes, demonstrative suffixes, the locative suffix \"-i\", and case suffixes.\n\nPossessive pronominal prefixes indicate first, second, third and indefinite third person possessor. There are two distinct sets of possessive prefixes.\n\nThe first set of prefixes is used primarily with body parts and kinship terms, while the second is used primarily with natural objects and artifacts but also certain body part terms. The distinction is not that between inalienable and alienable possession: for example, \"i·kʷé\" \"his horn\" refers to both a deer's horn and a person's deer horn.\n\nThe demonstrative suffixes in Quechuan are \"-va\" \"this (nearby),\" \"-sa\", \"that (far off),\" and -nʸ \"that (location unspecified).\"\n\nThe locative suffix -i is roughly equivalent in meaning to English \"at, in the vicinity of.\" It is primarily affixed to the noun theme plus a demonstrative suffix: \"i·mé šama·vi\" (\"i·mé\" \"foot,\" \"šamá·\" \"root\" + \"-va\" \"this\" + \"-i\" \"at\") \"at his feet, underfoot\" (literally \"at the root of his foot\").\n\nNoun themes with case suffixes function as subjects of verbs, adverbs, or, with vocative \"-a\", as a predicative expression: šalʸʔáyc ʔamé·k \"the sand is high,\" literally \"sand it-is-high.\"\n\nThe following suffix combinations are found (with \"-nʸ\" representing the demonstrative suffixes):\n\nQuechan verbs convey most meaning in sentences, including indication of notional and grammatical relationships, in contrast to nouns which are comparatively simple in content. \n\nVerbs typically consist of a theme and two nonthematic elements, a pronominal prefix and a predicative suffix as in \"ʔayú·k\" \"I see\", which is composed of first person pronominal prefix \"ʔ\" + \"to see\" \"ayú\" + present-past suffix \"·k\".\n\nVerb stems that form the basis of verb themes can be modified in a variety of ways to modify their meaning. \n\nSome verb stems can be reduplicated to add the meaning of repetitive or intermittent activity.\nAn example of a reduplicated stem is \"toxatóx\" \"to be spotted\", from the stem \"atóx\" \"to have a spot.\" Another example is \"aspukaspúk\" \"to be kinky (hair)\", from the stem \"aspúk\" \"to be curled. \n\nA variety of thematic prefixes can be added to the verb stem to give the stem meaning.\n\nOne such prefix is \"t-\" \"to cause generally or by means of an instrument.\" The stem \"qʷeraqʷér\" \"to be sharp-pointed\" can be modified by \"t-\" to produce the stem \"taqʷeraqʷér\" \"to sharpen to a point.\"\n\nPrefixes can be compounded, which most frequently occurs with the causative prefix \"u·-\" in addition to another prefix. The causative prefix \"u·-\" is affixed in conjunction with the prefix \"c-\" \"to cause with the teeth\" present in \"caqáw\" \"to eat fruit,\" producing the compound \"u·caqáw\" \"to feed fruit to.\"\n\nA theme consisting of only a stem or a prefix-stem structure can be further developed through infixation. Infixing \"u·\" before the consonant preceding the accented vowel of the stem in conjunction with the suffixation of a thematic suffix \"-v\" or \"-p\" produces a developed theme with the meaning \"to be one who does.\"\n\nAn example is the theme \"ku·nácv\" \"to be one who orders\" which is produced by infixing \"u·\" and affixing \"-v\" to the stem \"kanác\" \"to order, summon.\" \n\nQuechan has a subject-object-verb word order. \n\nLike other Yuman languages, Quechan features switch-reference by which two clauses can be linked with markers specifying whether their subjects are the same or different. \n\nThe following is an excerpt from a traditional Quechan story called \"The Man Who Bothered Ants.\" \n\n<poem>\nSomeone was over there.\nSomeone was living over there.\n\nA lot of people were living here,\nbut\nit happened\nthat this (person) was the only one (who did it).\nHe bothered ants.\n\nWhen the sun came up,\nhe got up,\nand as for the ants' nest,\nhe was going to stir up the ants.\nWe say that.</poem>\n\n"}

{"id": "2041141", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2041141", "title": "Mill's Methods", "text": "Mill's Methods\n\nMill's Methods are five methods of induction described by philosopher John Stuart Mill in his 1843 book \"A System of Logic\". They are intended to illuminate issues of causation.\n\nFor a property to be a necessary condition it must always be present if the effect is present. Since this is so, then we are interested in looking at cases where the effect is present and taking note of which properties, among those considered to be 'possible necessary conditions' are present and which are absent. Obviously, any properties which are absent when the effect is present cannot be necessary conditions for the effect. This method is also referred to more generally within comparative politics as the most different systems design.\nSymbolically, the method of agreement can be represented as:\nTo further illustrate this concept, consider two structurally different countries. Country A is a former colony, has a centre-left government, and has a federal system with two levels of government. Country B has never been a colony, has a centre-left government and is a unitary state. One factor that both countries have in common, the dependent variable in this case, is that they have a system of universal health care. Comparing the factors known about the countries above, a comparative political scientist would conclude that the government sitting on the centre-left of the spectrum would be the independent variable which causes a system of universal health care, since it is the only one of the factors examined which holds constant between the two countries, and the theoretical backing for that relationship is sound; social democratic (centre-left) policies often include universal health care.\n\nThis method is also known more generally as the most similar systems design within comparative politics.\n\nAs an example of the method of difference, consider two similar countries. Country A has a centre-right government, a unitary system and was a former colony. Country B has a centre-right government, a unitary system but was never a colony. The difference between the countries is that Country A readily supports anti-colonial initiatives, whereas Country B does not. The method of difference would identify the independent variable to be the status of each country as a former colony or not, with the dependant variable being support for anti-colonial initiatives. This is because, out of the two similar countries compared, the difference between the two is whether or not they were formerly a colony. This then explains the difference on the values of the dependent variable, with the former colony being more likely to support decolonization than the country with no history of being a colony.\n\nAlso called simply the \"joint method, \" this principle simply represents the application of the methods of agreement and difference.\n\nSymbolically, the Joint method of agreement and difference can be represented as:\n\nIf a range of factors are believed to cause a range of phenomena, and we have matched all the factors, except one, with all the phenomena, except one, then the remaining phenomenon can be attributed to the remaining factor.\n\nSymbolically, the Method of Residue can be represented as:\n\nIf across a range of circumstances leading to a phenomenon, some property of the phenomenon varies in tandem with some factor existing in the circumstances, then the phenomenon can be associated with that factor. For instance, suppose that various samples of water, each containing both salt and lead, were found to be toxic. If the level of toxicity varied in tandem with the level of lead, one could attribute the toxicity to the presence of lead.\n\nSymbolically, the method of concomitant variation can be represented as (with ± representing a shift):\n\nUnlike the preceding four inductive methods, the method of concomitant variation doesn't involve the elimination of any circumstance. Changing the magnitude of one factor results in the change in the magnitude of another factor.\n\n\n\n"}

It is a development of the World War II-era North American P-51 Mustang fighter. The Enforcer concept was originally created and flown as the Cavalier Mustang by David Lindsay, owner of Cavalier Aircraft, in response to the United States Air Force PAVE COIN program, but Cavalier did not have the manufacturing abilities to mass-produce the Enforcer, so the program was sold to Piper by Lindsay in 1970.\n\nIn 1968, Cavalier Aircraft owner/founder David Lindsay began developing a highly modified version of the Cavalier Mustang for use as a counter-insurgency aircraft. Cavalier initially mated a Rolls-Royce Dart 510 turboprop to a Mustang II airframe. This privately funded prototype was also intended for the same CAS/COIN mission that the Mustang II was built for. The Turbo Mustang III had radically increased performance, along with an associated increase in payload and decrease in cost of maintenance, and was equipped with Bristol ceramic armor to protect the engine, airframe, and pilot. Despite numerous sales attempts to the United States Air Force, neither the U.S. military nor any foreign operators purchased the Turbo Mustang III.\n\nSeeking a company with mass production capability, the Turbo Mustang III, renamed the \"Enforcer\", was sold to Piper Aircraft in late 1970. Cavalier Aircraft Corp. was closed in 1971 so the founder/owner, David Lindsay, could help continue develop the Enforcer concept with Piper. Piper was able to lease a Lycoming T-55L-9 engine from the USAF (the engine Lindsay wanted initially) and flew the aircraft some 200+ hours.\n\nIn 1971, Piper built two Enforcers by heavily modifying two existing Mustang airframes, fitting them with Lycoming YT55-L-9A turboprop engines along with numerous other significant modifications. One airframe was a single seat (called the PE-1 and FAA registered as \"N201PE\"), the other a dual-control aircraft (the PE-2, registered \"N202PE\"). Prior to the Pave COIN evaluation, \"N202PE\" was lost in a crash off the Florida coast on 12 July 1971 due to flutter caused by a Piper-modified elevator trim tab. Although the Enforcer performed well in the 1971–1972 Pave COIN test flown by USAF pilots, Piper failed to secure a USAF contract.\n\nIn 1984, with a $US12 million appropriation from Congress, Piper built two new Enforcers, giving the new prototypes the designation PA-48. These aircraft were evaluated by the USAF, but flown only by Piper test pilots.\n\nFor another eight years, Piper and Lindsay lobbied Congress to force the Air Force to officially re-evaluate the Enforcer. Eventually in the 1979 defense bill $11.9 million was allocated for Piper to build two new prototypes and for the Air Force to perform another flight evaluation. Since the Enforcer was never in the Air Force inventory, it was not given an official military designation and did not receive a serial number. Instead, it carried the Piper designation PA-48 and the FAA registration numbers N481PE and N482PE.\n\nBy the time the PA-48s were completed, they shared less than 10 percent of their structure with the P-51, and were longer and larger. Essentially, the PA-48 Enforcer was a completely new aircraft.\n\nThe two PA-48s were tested during 1983 and 1984 at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida and Edwards Air Force Base, California. As in the Pave COIN tests of 1971, the PA-48s were found to perform well in their intended role, but the Air Force again decided not to purchase the aircraft.\n\nOf the four prototype aircraft produced, two still exist. In 2014, PA-48 N482PE completed restoration and is on display at the Air Force Flight Test Museum at Edwards Air Force Base. N481PE has been fully restored and is currently in storage at the National Museum of the United States Air Force at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base near Dayton, Ohio.\n\n"}

It is an elementary linear transformation represented by a matrix. The model may represent laminar flow velocity at varying depths of a long channel with constant cross-section. Limited shear deformation is also used in vibration control, for instance base isolation of buildings for limiting earthquake damage.\n\nIn solid mechanics, a simple shear deformation is defined as an isochoric plane deformation in which there are a set of line elements with a given reference orientation that do not change length and orientation during the deformation. This deformation is differentiated from a pure shear by virtue of the presence of a rigid rotation of the material. When rubber deforms under simple shear, its stress-strain behavior is approximately linear. A rod under torsion is a practical example for a body under simple shear.\n\nIf e is the fixed reference orientation in which line elements do not deform during the deformation and e − e is the plane of deformation, then the deformation gradient in simple shear can be expressed as\nWe can also write the deformation gradient as\n\nIn linear elasticity, shear stress, denoted formula_13, is related to shear strain, denoted formula_14, by the following equation:\n\nformula_15\n\nwhere formula_16 is the shear modulus of the material, given by\n\nformula_17\n\nHere formula_18 is Young's modulus and formula_19 is Poisson's ratio.

Northwest Africa (the Maghreb) was known as either \"Libya\" or \"Africa\", while Egypt was considered part of Asia.\n\nEuropean exploration of Sub-Saharan Africa begins with the Age of Discovery in the 15th century, pioneered by Portugal under Henry the Navigator. The Cape of Good Hope was first reached by Bartolomeu Dias on 12 March 1488, opening the important sea route to India and the Far East, but European exploration of Africa itself remained very limited during the 16th and 17th centuries. The European powers were content to establish trading posts along the coast while they were actively exploring and colonizing the New World. Exploration of the interior of Africa was thus mostly left to the Arab slave traders, who in tandem with the Muslim conquest of Sudan established far-reaching networks and supported the economy of a number of Sahelian kingdoms during the 15th to 18th centuries.\n\nAt the beginning of the 19th century, European knowledge of the geography of the interior of Sub-Saharan Africa was still rather limited. Expeditions exploring Southern Africa were made during the 1830s and 1840s, so that around the midpoint of the 19th century and the beginning of the colonial Scramble for Africa, the unexplored parts were now limited to what would turn out to be the Congo Basin and the African Great Lakes. This \"Heart of Africa\" remained one of the last remaining \"blank spots\" on world maps of the later 19th century (alongside the Arctic, Antarctic and the interior of the Amazon basin). It was left for 19th-century European explorers, including those searching for the famed sources of the Nile, notably John Hanning Speke, Sir Richard Burton, David Livingstone and Henry Morton Stanley, to complete the exploration of Africa by the 1870s. After this, the general geography of Africa was known, but it was left to further expeditions during the 1880s onward, notably, those led by Oskar Lenz, to flesh more detail such as the continent's geological makeup.\n\nThe Phoenicians explored North Africa, establishing a number of colonies, the most prominent of which was Carthage. Carthage itself conducted exploration of West Africa. The first circumnavigation of the African continent was probably made by Phoenician sailors, in an expedition commissioned by Egyptian pharaoh Necho II, circa 600 BC which took three years. A report of this expedition is provided by Herodotus (4.37). They sailed south, rounded the Cape heading west, made their way north to the Mediterranean, and then returned home. He states that they paused each year to sow and harvest grain. Herodotus himself is sceptical of the historicity of this feat, which would have taken place about 120 years before his birth; however, the reason he gives for disbelieving the story is the sailors' reported claim that when they sailed along the southern coast of Africa, they found the Sun stood to their right, in the north; Herodotus, who was unaware of the spherical shape of the Earth found this impossible to believe. Some commentators took this circumstance as proof that the voyage is historical, but other scholars still dismiss the report as unlikely.\n\nThe West African coast may have been explored by Hanno the Navigator in an expedition in c. 500 BC. The report of this voyage survives in a short \"Periplus\" in Greek, which was first cited by Greek authors in the 3rd century BC. There is some uncertainty as to how far precisely Hanno reached; he clearly sailed as far as Sierra Leone, and may have continued as far as Guinea or even Gabon. However, Robin Law notes that some commentators have argued that Hanno's exploration may have taken him no farther than southern Morocco.\n\n\"Africa\" is named for the Afri people who settled in the area of current-day Tunisia. The Roman province of Africa spanned the Mediterranean coast of what is now Libya, Tunisia, and Algeria. The parts of North Africa north of the Sahara were well known in antiquity. Prior to the 2nd century BC, however, Greek geographers were unaware that the landmass then known as Libya expanded south of the Sahara, assuming that the desert bounded on the outer Ocean. Indeed, Alexander the Great, according to Plutarchus' \"Lives\", considered sailing from the mouths of the Indus back to Macedonia passing south of Africa as a shortcut compared to the land route. Even Eratosthenes around 200 BC still assumed an extent of the landmass no further south than the Horn of Africa.\n\nBy the Roman imperial period, the Horn of Africa was well-known to Mediterranean geographers. The trading post of Rhapta, described as \"the last marketplace of Azania,\" may correspond to the coast of Tanzania. The Periplus of the Erythraean Sea, dated to the 1st century AD, appears to extend geographical knowledge further south, to Southeast Africa. Ptolemy's world map of the 2nd century is well aware that the African continent extends significantly further south than the Horn of Africa, but has no geographic detail south of the equator (it is unclear whether it is aware of the Gulf of Guinea).\n\nIn the medieval period, the exploration of the interior of the Sahara and the Sahel as well as along the Swahili coast as far as Mozambique was the project of Muslim conquests and slave trade. It was at Mozambique that the Arab \"clockwise\" and the Portuguese \"counter-clockwise\" routes of exploration would meet at the end of the 15th century.\n\nFollowing its 8th-century conquest of North Africa, Arab Muslims ventured into Sub-Saharan Africa first along the Nile Valley towards Nubia, and later also across the Sahara towards West Africa. They were interested in the trans-Saharan trade, especially in slaves.\nThis expansion of Arab and Islamic culture was a gradual process, lasting throughout most of the Middle Ages. The Christian kingdoms of Nubia came under pressure from the 7th century, but they resisted for several centuries. The Kingdom of Makuria and Old Dongola collapsed by the beginning of the 14th century. A significant role in the spread of Islam in Africa was taken by Sufi orders during the 9th to 14th centuries, who spread south along trade routes between North Africa and the sub-Saharan kingdoms of Ghana and Mali. On the West African coast, they set up \"zawiyas\" on the shores of the River Niger. The Mali Empire became Islamic following the pilgrimage of Musa I of Mali in 1324. Timbuktu became an important center of Islamic culture south of the Sahara. Alodia, the last remnant of Christian Nubia, was destroyed by the Funj in 1504.\n\nJaume Ferrer sailed from Majorca down the West African coast to find the legendary \"River of Gold\" in 1346, but the outcome of his quest and his fate are unknown.\n\nPortuguese explorer Prince Henry, known as \"the Navigator\", was the first European to methodically explore Africa and the oceanic route to the Indies. From his residence in the Algarve region of southern Portugal, he directed successive expeditions to circumnavigate Africa and reach India. In 1420, Henry sent an expedition to secure the uninhabited but strategic island of Madeira. In 1425, he tried to secure the Canary Islands as well, but these were already under firm Castilian control. In 1431, another Portuguese expedition reached and annexed the Azores.\n\nNaval charts of 1339 show that the Canary Islands were already known to Europeans. In 1341, Portuguese and Italian explorers prepared a joint expedition. In 1342 the Catalans organized an expedition captained by Francesc Desvalers to the Canary Islands that set sail from Majorca. In 1344, Pope Clement VI named French admiral Luis de la Cerda \"Prince of Fortune\", and sent him to conquer the Canaries. In 1402, Jean de Bethencourt and Gadifer de la Salle sailed to conquer the Canary Islands but found them already plundered by the Castilians. Although they did conquer the isles, Bethencourt's nephew was forced to cede them to Castile in 1418.\n\nIn 1455 and 1456 two Italian explorers, Alvise Cadamosto from Venice and Antoniotto Usodimare from Genoa, together with an unnamed Portuguese captain and working for Prince Henry of Portugal, followed the Gambia river, visiting the land of Senegal, while another Italian sailor from Genoa, Antonio de Noli, also on behalf of Prince Henry, explored the Bijagós islands, and, together with the Portuguese Diogo Gomes, the Cape Verde archipelago. Antonio de Noli, who became the first governor of Cape Verde (and the first European colonial governor in Sub-Saharan Africa), is also considered the discoverer of the First Islands of Cape Verde.\n\nAlong the western and eastern coasts of Africa, progress was also steady; Portuguese sailors reached Cape Bojador in 1434 and Cape Blanco in 1441. In 1443, they built a fortress on the island of Arguin, in modern-day Mauritania, trading European wheat and cloth for African gold and slaves. It was the first time that the semi-mythic \"gold of the Sudan\" reached Europe without Muslim mediation. Most of the slaves were sent to Madeira, which became, after thorough deforestation, the first European plantation colony. Between 1444 and 1447, the Portuguese explored the coasts of Senegal, Gambia, and Guinea. In 1456, the Venetian captain Alvise Cadamosto, under Portuguese command, explored the islands of Cape Verde. In 1462, two years after Prince Henry's death, Portuguese sailors explored the Bissau islands and named Serra Leoa (\"Lioness Mountains\").\nIn 1469, Fernão Gomes rented the rights of African exploration for five years. Under his direction, in 1471, the Portuguese reached modern Ghana and settled in A Mina (\"the mine\"), today's Elmina. They had finally reached a country with an abundance of gold, hence the historical name of \"Gold Coast\" that Elmina would eventually receive.\n\nIn 1472, Fernão do Pó discovered the island that would bear his name for centuries (now Bioko) and an estuary abundant in shrimp (), giving its name to Cameroon.\n\nSoon after, the equator was crossed by Europeans . Portugal established a base in Sāo Tomé that, after 1485, was settled with criminals. After 1497, expelled Spanish and Portuguese Jews were also sent there.\n\nIn 1482, Diogo Cão found the mouth of a large river and learned of the existence of a great kingdom, Kongo. In 1485, he explored the river upstream as well.\n\nBut the Portuguese wanted, above anything else, to find a route to India and kept trying to circumnavigate Africa. In 1485, the expedition of João Afonso d'Aveiros, with the German astronomer Martin of Behaim as part of the crew, explored the Bight of Benin (Kingdom of Benin), returning information about African king Ogane.\n\nIn 1488, Bartolomeu Dias and his pilot Pêro de Alenquer, after putting down a mutiny, turned a cape where they were caught by a storm, naming it Cape of Storms. They followed the coast for a while realizing that it kept going eastward with even some tendency to the north. Lacking supplies, they turned around with the conviction that the far end of Africa had finally been reached. Upon their return to Portugal, the promising cape was renamed Cape of Good Hope.\n\nSome years later, Christopher Columbus landed in America under rival Castilian command. Pope Alexander VI decreed the \"Inter caetera\" bull, dividing the non-Christian parts of the world between the two rival Catholic powers, Spain and Portugal.\n\nFinally, in the years 1497 to 1498, Vasco da Gama, again with Alenquer as a pilot, took a direct route to Cape of Good Hope, via St. Helena. He went beyond the farthest point reached by Dias and named the country Natal. Then he sailed northward, making land at Quelimane (Mozambique) and Mombasa, where he found Chinese traders, and Malindi (both in modern Kenya). In this town, he recruited an Arab pilot who led the Portuguese directly to Calicut. On August 28, 1498, King Manuel of Portugal informed the Pope of the good news that Portugal had reached India.\n\nEgypt and Venice reacted to this news with hostility; from the Red Sea, they jointly attacked the Portuguese ships that traded with India. The Portuguese defeated these ships near Diu in 1509. The Ottoman Empire's indifferent reaction to Portuguese exploration left Portugal in almost exclusive control of trade through the Indian Ocean. They established many bases along the eastern coast of Africa except for Somalia (See Ajuran-Portuguese wars). The Portuguese also captured Aden in 1513.\n\nOne of the ships under command of Diogo Dias arrived at a coast that was not in East Africa. Two years later, a chart already showed an elongated island east of Africa that bore the name Madagascar. But only a century later, between 1613 and 1619, did the Portuguese explore the island in detail. They signed treaties with local chieftains and sent the first missionaries, who found it impossible to make locals believe in Hell, and were eventually expelled.\n\nThe Portuguese presence in Africa soon interfered with existing Arab trade interests.\nBy 1583, the Portuguese established themselves in Zanzibar and on the Swahili coast.\nThe Kingdom of Congo was converted to Christianity in 1495; its king taking the name of João I. The Portuguese also established their trade interests in the Kingdom of Mutapa in the 16th century, and in 1629 placed a puppet ruler on the throne.\n\nThe Portuguese (and later also the Dutch) also became involved in the local slave economy, supporting the state of the Jaggas, who performed slave raids in the Congo.\n\nThey also used the Kongo to weaken the neighbor realm of Ndongo, where Queen Nzinga put a fierce but eventually doomed resistance to Portuguese and Jagga ambitions. Portugal intervened militarily in these conflicts, creating the basis for their colony of Angola. In 1663, after another conflict, the royal crown of Kongo was sent to Lisbon. Nevertheless, a diminished Kongo Kingdom would still exist until 1885, when the last Manicongo, Pedro V, ceded his almost non-existent domain to Portugal.\n\nThe Portuguese dealt with the other major state of Southern Africa, the Monomotapa (in modern Zimbabwe), in a similar manner: Portugal intervened in a local war hoping to get abundant mineral riches, imposing a protectorate. But with the authority of the Monomotapa diminished by the foreign presence, anarchy took over. The local miners migrated and even buried the mines to prevent them from falling into Portuguese hands. When in 1693 the neighboring Cangamires invaded the country, the Portuguese accepted their failure and retreated to the coast.\n\nBeginning in the 17th century, the Netherlands began exploring and colonizing Africa. While the Dutch were waging a long war of independence against Spain, Portugal had temporarily united with Spain, starting in 1580 and ending in 1640. As a result, the growing colonial ambitions of the Netherlands were mostly directed against Portugal.\n\nFor this purpose, two Dutch companies were founded: the West Indies Company, with power over all the Atlantic Ocean, and the East Indies Company, with power over the Indian Ocean.\n\nThe West India Company conquered Elmina in 1637 and Luanda in 1640. In 1648, they were expelled from Luanda by the Portuguese. Overall the Dutch built 16 forts in different places, including Gorée in Senegal, partly overtaking Portugal as the main slave-trading power. The Dutch Gold Coast and Dutch Slave Coast were successful.\n\nBut in the colony of Dutch Loango-Angola, the Portuguese managed to expel the Dutch.\n\nIn Dutch Mauritius the colonization started in 1638 and ended in 1710, with a brief interruption between 1658 and 1666. Numerous governors were appointed, but continuous hardships such as cyclones, droughts, pest infestations, lack of food, and illnesses finally took their toll, and the island was definitively abandoned in 1710.\n\nThe Dutch left a lasting impact in South Africa, a region ignored by Portugal that the Dutch eventually decided to use as a station in their route to East Asia. Jan van Riebeeck founded Cape Town in 1652, starting the European exploration and colonization of South Africa.\n\nAlmost at the same time as the Dutch, a few other European powers attempted to create their own outposts for the African slave trade.\n\nAs early as 1530, English merchant adventurers started trading in West Africa, coming into conflict with Portuguese troops. In 1581, Francis Drake reached the Cape of Good Hope. In 1663, the English built Fort James in Gambia. One year later, another English colonial expedition attempted to settle southern Madagascar, resulting in the death of most of the colonists. The English forts on the West African coast were eventually taken by the Dutch.\n\nIn 1626, the French Compagnie de l'Occident was created. This company expelled the Dutch from Senegambia (Senegal), making it the first French domain in Africa, they also conquered the island of Arguin.\n\nFrance also set her eyes on Madagascar, the island that had been used since 1527 as a stop in travels to India. In 1642, the French East India Company founded a settlement in southern Madagascar called Fort Dauphin. The commercial results of this settlement were scarce and, again, most of the settlers died. One of the survivors, Etienne de Flacourt, published a \"History of the Great Island of Madagascar and Relations\", which was for a long time the main European source of information about the island. Further settlement attempts had no more success but, in 1667, François Martin led the first expedition to the Malagasy heartland, reaching Lake Alaotra. In 1665, France officially claimed Madagascar, under the name of Île Dauphine. However, little colonial activity would take place in Madagascar until the 19th century.\n\nIn 1651, the Duchy of Courland and Semigallia (a vassal of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth) gained a colony in Africa on St. Andrew's Island at the Gambia River and established the Jacob Fort there. The Duchy also took other local lands including St. Mary Island (modern-day Banjul) and Fort Jillifree\n\nIn 1650, Swedish merchants founded Swedish Gold Coast in modern Ghana following the foundation of the Swedish Africa Company (1649). In 1652 the foundations were laid of the fort Carlsborg.In 1658 Fort Carlsborg was seized and made part of the Danish Gold Coast colony, then to the Dutch Gold Coast. Later on the local population started a successful uprising against their new masters and in December 1660 the King of the Akan people subgroup-Efutu again offered Sweden control over the area, but in 1663 were seized by the Danish after a long defense of Fort Christiansborg.\n\nThe Dano-Norwegian colonized the Danish Gold Coast, from 1674 to 1755 the settlements were administered by the Danish West India-Guinea Company. From December 1680 to 29 August 1682, the Portuguese occupied Fort Christiansborg. In 1750 it was made a Danish crown colony. From 1782 to 1785 it was under British occupation. From 1814 it was made part of the territory of Denmark.\n\nIn 1677, King Frederick William I of Prussia sent an expedition to the western coast of Africa. The commander of the expedition, Captain Blonk, signed agreements with the chieftains of the Gold Coast. There, the Prussians built a fort named Gross Friederichsburg and restored the abandoned Portuguese fort of Arguin. But in 1720, the king decided to sell these bases to the Netherlands for 7,000 ducats and 12 slaves, six of them chained with pure gold chains.\n\nIn 1777, the Spanish Empire and Portuguese Empire signed the Treaty of San Ildefonso in which Portugal give the islands of Annobón and Fernando Poo in waters of the Gulf of Guinea, as well as the Guinean coast between the Niger River and the Ogooué River, to Spain.\n\nThe British expressed their interest by the formation in 1788 of The Association for Promoting the Discovery of the Interior Parts of Africa. The individuals who formed this club were inspired in part by the Scotsman James Bruce, who had ventured to Ethiopia in 1769 and reached the source of the Blue Nile.\n\nOverall, the European exploration of Africa in the 17th and 18th centuries was very limited. Instead, they were focused on the slave trade, which only required coastal bases and items to trade. The real exploration of the African interior would start well into the 19th century.\n\nAlthough the Napoleonic Wars distracted the attention of Europe from exploratory work in Africa, those wars nevertheless exercised great influence on the future of the continent, both in Egypt and South Africa. The occupation of Egypt (1798–1803), first by France and then by Great Britain, resulted in an effort by the Ottoman Empire to regain direct control over that country. In 1811, Mehemet Ali established an almost independent state, and from 1820 onward established Egyptian rule over eastern Sudan. In South Africa, the struggle with Napoleon caused the United Kingdom to take possession of the Dutch settlements at the Cape. In 1814, Cape Colony, which had been continuously occupied by British troops since 1806, was formally ceded to the British crown.\n\nMeanwhile, considerable changes had been made in other parts of the continent. The occupation of Algiers by France in 1830 put an end to the piracy of the Barbary states. Egyptian authority continued to expand southward, with the consequent additions to knowledge of the Nile. The city of Zanzibar, on the island of that name, rapidly attained importance. Accounts of a vast inland sea, and the discovery of the snow-clad mountains of Kilimanjaro in 1840–1848, stimulated the desire for further knowledge about Africa in Europe.\n\nIn the mid-19th century, Protestant missions were carrying on active missionary work on the Guinea coast, in South Africa and in the Zanzibar dominions. Missionaries visited little-known regions and peoples, and in many instances became explorers and pioneers of trade and empire. David Livingstone, a Scottish missionary, had been engaged since 1840 in work north of the Orange River. In 1849, Livingstone crossed the Kalahari Desert from south to north and reached Lake Ngami. Between 1851 and 1856, he traversed the continent from west to east, discovering the great waterways of the upper Zambezi River. In November 1855, Livingstone became the first European to see the famous Victoria Falls, named after the Queen of the United Kingdom. From 1858 to 1864, the lower Zambezi, the Shire River and Lake Nyasa were explored by Livingstone. Nyasa had been first reached by the confidential slave of António da Silva Porto, a Portuguese trader established at Bié in Angola, who crossed Africa during 1853–1856 from Benguella to the mouth of the Rovuma. A prime goal for explorers was to locate the source of the River Nile. Expeditions by Burton and Speke (1857–1858) and Speke and Grant (1863) located Lake Tanganyika and Lake Victoria. It was eventually proved to be the latter from which the Nile flowed.\n\nHenry Morton Stanley, who had in 1871 succeeded in finding and succouring Livingstone (originating the famous line \"Dr. Livingstone, I presume\"), started again for Zanzibar in 1874. In one of the most memorable of all exploring expeditions in Africa, Stanley circumnavigated Victoria Nyanza (Lake Victoria) and Lake Tanganyika. Striking farther inland to the Lualaba, he followed that river down to the Atlantic Ocean—which he reached in August 1877—and proved it to be the Congo.\nIn 1895, the British South Africa Company hired the American scout Frederick Russell Burnham to look for minerals and ways to improve river navigation in the central and southern Africa region. Burnham oversaw and led the Northern Territories British South Africa Exploration Company expedition that first established that major copper deposits existed north of the Zambezi in North-Eastern Rhodesia. Along the Kafue River, Burnham saw many similarities to copper deposits he had worked in the United States, and he encountered native peoples wearing copper bracelets. Copper rapidly became the primary export of Central Africa and it remains essential to the economy even today.\n\nExplorers were also active in other parts of the continent. Southern Morocco, the Sahara and the Sudan were traversed in many directions between 1860 and 1875 by Georg Schweinfurth and Gustav Nachtigal. These travellers not only added considerably to geographical knowledge, but obtained invaluable information concerning the people, languages and natural history of the countries in which they sojourned. Among the discoveries of Schweinfurth was one that confirmed Greek legends of the existence beyond Egypt of a \"pygmy race\". But the first western discoverer of the pygmies of Central Africa was Paul Du Chaillu, who found them in the Ogowe district of the west coast in 1865, five years before Schweinfurth's first meeting with them. Du Chaillu had previously, through journeys in the Gabon region between 1855 and 1859, made popular in Europe the knowledge of the existence of the gorilla, whose existence was thought to be as legendary as that of the Pygmies of Aristotle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The day-to-day operations are managed by the superintendent, who is appointed by the board.\n\nThe Grossmont Union High School District utilizes a strategic plan that includes a mission statement, district guidelines, core values, and annual goals and objectives. The district's schools are accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC).\n\nFour of the district's high schools—Helix, Mount Miguel, Santana, and Valhalla (twice)—have been recognized as a California Distinguished School by the California Department of Education.\n\nIn March 2001, the district and two of its high schools—Santana and Granite Hills—made nationwide headlines in the US when, in a span of seventeen days, a total of two students were killed and twenty students and two teachers were wounded when two students, in separate incidents, opened fire at their schools.\n\nGrossmont Union High School District was formed in 1920 and its first high school, Grossmont High School, built in 1922, served the cities of La Mesa and El Cajon. At the time of its construction, this region of eastern San Diego County was much more rural and isolated from the city of San Diego. La Mesa and El Cajon were, in fact, only newly incorporated cities, as of 1912. Grossmont remained the region's only high school for 30 years. In 1939, Grossmont High School was rebuilt. Beginning in 1952, the school district underwent an expensive, rapid period of development to accommodate for the suburbanization and consequent growth in population of the area. Six more schools were established in a period of ten years. A further four schools were subsequently built. Most recently, the district opened Steele Canyon High School in Spring Valley in 2000.\n\nThere are many military families present in the school district. Marine Corps Air Station Miramar and Marine Corps Recruit Depot San Diego are both nearby. North of San Diego is Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton.\n\nIn October 1982, the San Diego Committee Against Registration and the Draft (CARD), later renamed the Committee Opposed to Militarism and the Draft, sought to purchase advertising space from five student newspapers published by high schools within the district. CARD, a non-profit organization, provides counseling services to young men and women on alternatives to military service. Members include both students and non-students. The advertisement was intended to provide information to students on such alternatives.\n\nDepicting a ghost-like figure, stating \"Don't Let the Draft Blow You Away!\" the advertisement contained the following statements:\n\"Know Your Rights\"\n\"Know Your Choices!\"\n\n\"If the draft starts tomorrow, you\"\n\"could be in boot camp 11 days later.\"\n\n\"Call or Write\"\n\"Committee Against\"\n\"Registration and the Draft\"\nIn November 1982, Acting Assistant Superintendent Bob King issued a directive instructing that all principals reject CARD's requests. In January 1983, CARD filed an administrative claim with the governing board so as to reverse the Superintendent's decision. The board rejected the claim in February and on March 16, 1983, CARD filed a lawsuit against the board, alleging that the board's actions and policies had deprived CARD of its rights under the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.\n\nIn June 1986, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals stated that the question of voluntary and compulsory military service is a controversial political issue, ruling that if a school establishes a forum for one side to prevent its views, it must provide equal access to opponents. CARD v. GUHSD has since become a major legal precedent with regards to military recruitment. In the nine Western states within the boundaries of the Ninth Circuit, the ruling can be cited by counter-militarism activists in order to demand the opportunity to address students in public schools, an opportunity previously granted solely to recruiters and the Selective Service System. In addition, the Court's ruling clarifies the legal definition of school newspapers, mainly as \"limited public forums.\" The governing board had argued that the newspapers were \"non-public\" and therefore completely under its control.\n\nOn March 5, 2001, Charles \"Andy\" Williams, 15, shot and killed two students and wounded 13 others at Santana High School in Santee. On August 15, 2002, Williams was sentenced to 50 years to life in prison for the shootings. His defense attorneys had filed a 200-page report arguing for more lenient sentencing. The report included excerpts from Williams' interview with University of California, Davis psychiatrist Dr. Charles Scott. Williams told Scott that taunting and bullying by his peers had depressed him and led him to consider suicide. He also told Scott that he thought someone would stop him from bringing his father's .22 calibre gun to school.\n\nLess than three weeks later, on March 22, 2001, Jason Hoffman, 18, armed with a .22 calibre handgun and a 12-gauge pump-action shotgun, shot and wounded three students and two teachers at Granite Hills High School in nearby El Cajon. The shooting ended in a gun battle with local police near the campus administration building. Before the incident, Hoffman allegedly made references to the 1999 massacre at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colorado. Hoffman reportedly had a history of mental illness and discipline problems and was ordered to attend an anger management class several years before. The \"San Diego Union-Tribune\" also reported that Hoffman had been rejected by the Navy a day before the shooting because he was 25 pounds overweight, had a skin condition and had been convicted of assault. After pleading guilty to one count of premeditated attempted murder and five counts of assault, Hoffman hanged himself in his segregation cell at the county jail on October 29, 2001.\n\nStudents throughout San Diego County joined the nationwide protests over immigration policies in March 2006. Hundreds of students walked out of El Cajon Valley High School and marched in the streets carrying signs and flags. Granite Hills High School went into morning lockdowns to prevent students from coming into contact with marchers from the neighboring school. Student walkouts also occurred at Mount Miguel High School and Monte Vista High School.\n\nGUHSD sent out an automated phone message to parents, urging them to keep their children at school. The bilingual message warned that students who are arrested could face a $250 fine. The district cautioned parents that any students who missed class or left the campus without permission would be marked truant and receive zero grades.\n\nIn 1998, Helix High School became the district's first charter high school. Steele Canyon became the second charter school on July 1, 2007. Liberty Charter High School was founded in 2008. Although affiliated with GUHSD, Helix High School has its own independent school board. Liberty Charter is operated by Literacy First inc.\n\nThe GUHSD has the following thirteen high school campuses (listed in order of year opened):\n\nIn addition to its high schools, the districts operates:\n\nGoverning board\n\n\nSuperintendent\nMs. Smith was an internal hire.\n\nMr. Godley was a former superintendent of the San Marino Unified School District.\n\nMr. Ward worked as an administrator for New York City Schools.\n\nMr. Ryan worked for the County Office.\n\nMr. Collins had worked 39 years for LA Unified.\n\nMr. Swenson was the superintendent of the Nevada Joint Union High School District in metropolitan Sacramento.\n\nIn the mid-1980s, sophomore Karen Davis requested that a district policy preventing girls from participating in \"contact sports\" (e.g. wrestling, football and boxing) be changed. It is \"outright discrimination,\" Davis argued, to exclude any capable girl from playing any particular sport. Initially, the board rejected her request, voting 4–1 in favor of prohibiting Davis from playing on the Helix High School football team. Davis threatened to sue the board and, in September 1985, the state legislative council ruled that she should be allowed to play on the team. Finally, the board changed the policy to allow girls to try out for contact sports.\n\nIn 1999, the school board approved expanding the district's anti-discrimination policy to include sexual orientation.\n\nIn 2002, the GUHSD board decided to censor a film promoting tolerance of gay, lesbian and bisexual students.\n\nIn October 2007, Governor Schwarzenegger signed an anti-discrimination law aiming to provide protection for gay, lesbian and transgender students. The following month, four of the five board members joined a federal lawsuit that challenged the new state education law as \"unconstitutionally vague and a violation of privacy rights.\"\n\nThe school board publicly voted in 2008 on a resolution endorsing Proposition 8 which would effectively ban same-sex marriage in California. The Governing Board voted 4–0 with 1 abstention by board member Hoy (who cited that the proposition had nothing to do with schools) to endorse the amendment of the California State Constitution. Many students, teachers and community members spoke out against the boards action during the public comment period. They felt the message they were sending to students was one of discrimination and felt the support of prop 8 had nothing to do with the education and students of the district. Grossmont Union School board was the only school board in the State to make such a resolution in support of prop. 8\n\nMost high schools in the district offer advanced placement (AP) courses. The percent of students in AP courses varies from school to school.\nWith 2,300 employees and hundreds more hourly employees, GUHSD is the largest employer of eastern San Diego County. GUHSD is also very ethnically diverse. Of the 24,000 students that attend schools in the district, approximately 53% are white, while 47% identify as one or more of the following: Latino, African-American, Asian, Filipino, Pacific Islander, and Native American. At the school level, these statistics change significantly. In fact, some schools comprise minority-majority populations. While non-Hispanic whites represent over 75% of the Santana High School student body, they make up only 16% at Mount Miguel High School.\n\nA 1992 UC Santa Barbara-University of British Columbia-University of Edinburgh study examined the extent and impact of ethnic and racial segregation on the achievement gap in California's six largest school districts, including GUHSD, during the 1988–1989 school year. Within these districts, the study found that GUHSD had the highest concentration of white students, while San Francisco Unified School District and Los Angeles Unified School District had the lowest. The study suggested that such widespread segregation may have led to significant differences in achievement levels across schools and among ethnic groups.\n\nAverage class size in the district varies by grade level, subject area and school. The district, however, reports that it provides staffing resources at a ratio of 35 students to one teacher. Based on audited financial statements for the 2006–2007 fiscal year, the district spent an average of $9,030 to educate each student.\n\nSocioeconomic backgrounds vary across student populations as well. The district reports relatively large percentages of socioeconomically disadvantaged students at several schools. During the 2005–2006 school year, 50% of students were considered disadvantaged at Mount Miguel High School, while 62%, 48% and 42% were deemed so at El Cajon Valley High School, Helix High School and Monte Vista High School, respectively. Valhalla High School had the lowest proportion of socioeconomically disadvantaged students, with only 12%.\n\nChaparral High School is the main continuation/alternative school of the district. Comprehensive schools may refer students to Chaparral for reasons involving poor attendance, lack of academic success and/or behavioral issues.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Glebova's successor Alice Panikian was viewed as a strong contender to win the 2006 Miss Universe crown and placed in the Top 10.\n\nIn 2010, Miss Universe Canada made headlines when Maria Al-Masani, the first beauty pageant contestant of Yemeni origin, competed. This was controversial due to accommodating her religious beliefs by allowing her to wear a semi-transparent sarong over her swimsuit. In 2012, CNN World News named her one of its eight \"agents of change\" to follow, the only Canadian to receive that designation.\n\nThe 2012 contest was accused of transphobia after disqualifying a transgender contestant, Jenna Talackova (Jana Talačková), for not being a \"naturally born female\". A spokesperson from Miss Universe Canada released a statement saying she was disqualified because on her entry form she stated she was born a female, which was not the case. Eventually, Talackova was let back into the competition.\n\nAfter this, Sahar Biniaz dropped out of the Miss Universe pageant a few days prior to it starting, having allegedly hurt her foot. Adwoa Yamoah, the first runner-up, replaced her and competed in Miss Universe 2012.\n\nOn May 27, 2013, two days after the Miss Universe Canada 2013 pageant, it was announced that Denise Garrido was the winner. As it turned out, Garrido was actually 3rd runner-up and due to a mathematical error was named the winner. Calgary's Riza Santos was the actual winner.

The village lies 10 km (7 mi) northwest of Clifden and is situated at the head of Cleggan Bay.\n\nA focal point of the village is the pier, built by Alexander Nimmo in 1822 and extended in 1908. Ferries leave the pier daily for Inishbofin (Galway), and there is also a ferry to Inishturk.\n\n\"An Cloigeann\" means head or skull, apparently referring to the coastal headland. Legend, however, provides a different origin of the name. St. Ceannanach is said to have been beheaded by a pagan chief. Lore has it that the chief then picked up his head and took it to the Holy Well in Clooncree where he washed it before lying down to die. At the top of Cleggan head, which gives a commanding view of the harbour, is the remains of a watchtower constructed during the Napoleonic wars.\n\nIn 1927, in what became known as the Cleggan Bay Disaster, 25 fishermen from the local area drowned during a great gale which arose without warning while they were mackerel fishing in the bay. The nearby village of Rossadilisk lost sixteen men and was subsequently abandoned. Nine men from Inishbofin and twenty men from County Mayo were also lost. Due to the death of so many breadwinners, the area was devastated. The disaster and the devastation visited on the local families made international news and funds were raised from as far away as the U.K., U.S. and Australia. The disaster is remembered in stories, poems and on stone markers. It was recorded by local Marie Feeney in her book “The Cleggan Bay Disaster”, by TG4 Documentary \"The Cleggan Disaster\" / \"An Bádhadh Mór\" directed by Petra Conroy, and remembered in Richard Murphy's poem \"The Cleggan Disaster\", from his 1963 book \"Sailing to an Island\". Irish singer/songwriter Saoirse Mhór wrote the song \"The Cleggan Bay Disaster\" (Greenhill Media 2013) which was the title track of the 2013 release by the German/Irish Folk band Fleadh.\n\nOffshore, the island of Inishbofin can be reached by boat from Cleggan pier. Inishbofin has a population of about 200 people. In 665 St. Coleman founded a monastery on the island. A roofless thirteenth century chapel in the present day graveyard is believed to be the site of his monastery. The harbour entrance of the island is dominated by the Cromwellian fort which was a prison camp for Catholic priests. The island also holds the remains of castle built by the “pirate queen” Gráinne O'Malley.\n\nA notable feature of the physical geography around Cleggan is blanket bog. Few plant species can live in the acid condition of the bog, but those that can form a vegetation not found outside Ireland.\n\nNear Cleggan is a collection of prehistoric monuments including tombs, standing stones and walls.\n\nCleggan now receives more tourists, but traditionally the main source of income in the village has been fishing, supplemented by farming, which is difficult in the area's soil. Fishing continues to be an important industry. The village has four bars (Olivers, Joyces, Newmans, and The Pier Bar), one grocer and a sit-down restaurant, as well as a seasonal take-out. In addition to trips to the local islands, leisure activities for visitors include horseback riding and fishing.\n\n\n\n\n"}

He studied at a Roman Catholic priest seminary in Maribor. Already as a young man, he became influenced by the social thought of Janez Evangelist Krek, Edvard Kocbek and the German philosopher Romano Guardini. After the invasion of Yugoslavia and the Nazi occupation of northern Slovenia in April 1941, Grmič started collaborating with the Communist-led Liberation Front of the Slovenian People.\n\nIn 1950, he was ordained priest and between 1952 and 1958 he worked as a parish priest of Vransko.

The word \"Skeksis\" serves as both singular and plural form for this species, with the singular being pronounced and the plural . They are described by concept artist Brian Froud as, \"part reptile, part predatory bird, part dragon\". The Skeksis are represented by puppets engineered under the direction of Jim Henson. Jim Henson said that in the development of the Skeksis, the creators drew inspiration from the Seven deadly sins.\n\nJim Henson was inspired to design the Skeksis by an illustrated edition of a Lewis Carroll poem showing two elegantly dressed crocodiles in a bathroom. He became intrigued with the idea of a reptilian race assuming control over a formerly splendid past society. Numerous names were proposed for the species, including Skekses, Reptus, Karackt and Skek-sis.\n\nHenson himself commented on the difficulty of performing as a Skeksis:\n\nThe Skeksis are tall bipeds combining avian and reptilian features, wearing elaborate but threadbare robes of lace, velvet, and brocade to apparently conceal their aged and constantly decomposing bodies while appearing large and more intimidating. Their heads are beaked like a vulture's, while simultaneously sporting curved fangs. They have enlarged bellies and long reptilian tails, as well as curved quills on their backs. While having four arms like their urRu counterparts, the Skeksis have only one functional pair as the other were initially wing-like before they eventually withered and atrophied. Though skekMal is one of a few Skeksis to make use of his extra arms in \"The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance\". In an episode of the Netflix series, it is apparent that the Skeksis species may have either a triple urethra or three male genitals.\n\nDespite their frail appearance, Skeksis are physically powerful as skekUng mustered his strength to cut through solid stone during the 'Haakskeeka' duel while a provoked skekSil single-handedly slammed pilaster rock onto protagonist Jen.\n\nThe Skeksis are the corrupt rulers of the planet Thra, having inherited it from their benevolent urSkek predecessors, and embody the knowledgeable, yet unrestrained aspects of the urSkeks' behavior. The Skeksis culture favors repetitive flamboyance, emotional pettiness, and a wasteful attitude toward life. Though they are capable of alliances, each acts only of self-preservation to the point of immediate betrayals to benefit their personal agenda. Despite their few numbers, the Skeksis form shifting political parties that stabilize the Skeksis society despite some causing friction among them, especially if the Emperor greatly favours one party over the others.\n\nBefore the events of \"Age of Resistance\", the Skeksis were divided into the Imperial Allegiance (skekSo, skekSil, skekTek) which oversee their race's continuation, the Tithing Allegiance (skekLach, skekOk, skekEkt, skekShod) who collect tributes from the Gelfling clans, and the Security Allegiance (skekVar, skekAyuk, skekZok) who command the Gelfling castle guard. But following the Garthim War and before events of the movie, the Skesis reorganize themselves into the Diplomatic Allegiance (skekSil, skekOk, skekEkt) who maintain the castle to the Emperor's liking, The Religious Allegiance (skekZok, skekShod, skekAyuk) who oversee daily routines, and Military Allegiance (skekUng, skekTek, skekNa) who oversee the Garthim soldiers.\n\nDue to the accelerated decomposition of their bodies, the Skeksis constantly attempt to prolong their lives by using the properties of the Dark Crystal itself. Their primary method is absorbing sunlight channeled through the Dark Crystal, its potency dependent on Thra's three suns. Another method is a form of acupuncture, in which power lines laid on their castle channels the planet's energy to them and feeds back noxious pulses, resulting in their kingdom's wasteland appearance. A third method is extracting the vitality from other life forms by exposing them to reflected beams from the Dark Crystal, a process that originally destroys the victims before it was refined enough to reduce them into nearly mindless drones which the Skeksis keep as slaves. The life force is collected in a liquid form that restores a Skeksis' youth and vitality, the Emperor eventually making law that only he can partake of it. Gelfling were originally used for this purpose until their near extinction with the Skeksis forced to use Podlings instead, with the youth inducing effects of the resulting elixir created from their life force lasting for a few seconds.\n\nThe Skeksis have created the Garthim through grafting corpses of Arathim and Gruenak which are then animated by the Dark Crystal, and bred the sentinel Crystal Bats.\n\nOriginally, Jim Henson thought of having the Skeksis communicate through noises, though he later shot the film showing the Skeksis speaking a constructed language, based on Ancient Greek and Egyptian, devised by the author Alan Garner. The dialogue was later redubbed in English, as the original version proved unsuccessful in impressing test audiences. The original language is present in \"The World of the Dark Crystal\" and \"The Dark Crystal\" novelization, wherein (according to the former) it is \"restricted to nouns, adjectives, and expletives\", and has an object–verb–subject word order.\n\nThe products of a botched attempt by the urSkeks to purge themselves of their imperfections while returning to their homeworld during a Great Conjunction, an event where the three suns of Thra produce a pure light that hits the Crystal, the Skeksis are the embodiments of their original selves' worst inhibitions compared to their urRu counterparts. Moments after coming into being, two of their own were accidentally killed, and infighting among the surviving Skeksis resulted in a Shard of the Crystal being broken off and lost. The urRu then left the Castle to the Skeksis, who began to modify the urSkeks' architecture with their own grotesque designs while attempting to create their own Crystal. The black rocks they created were reused as targets for the \"Haakskeekah\" rite, translated as \"Trial by Stone\", in which the loser is stripped of his position. The Skeksis have other means of punishment among their kin that include being maimed by an eye-gouging Peeper beetle.\n\nAccording to \"The World of The Dark Crystal\" and \"\" series, possessing urSkeks' knowledge but lacking their restraint, the Skeksis were initially a vibrant and jovial race as they tricked Aughra into a deep sleep to metaphysically observe the universe. Unopposed, they ruled Thra over a thousand years and kept the Gelfling tribes divided while presenting themselves as their lords and protectors. But the dynamic changed as the Skeksis aged into haggard shells of their former selves as the Dark Crystal is unable to properly prolong their lives due its connection to Thra, causing an epidemic called the Darkening that affects the planet's lifeforms. skekTek, with skekSil's help, developed a means to polarize the Dark Crystal's life-giving properties to extract life essence from Thra and its life forms to prolong their own lives. When the Gelfling learned of this and rebelled, they devised a prophecy revealing that one of them would end the rule of the Skeksis by restoring the broken Shard to the Crystal with the restoration of the urSkeks as consequence. When the Skeksis learned of this, they attempted to deter the Gelflings with Shard fabrications before using the newly created Garthim to wipe out the entire Gelfling race.\n\nAt the start of the film, skekUng succeeded skekSo as Emperor with only nine Skeksis remaining before skekTek was killed. Toward the end, protagonists Jen and Kira reunite them with the urRu to recreate the urSkeks who depart Thra.\n\nAlso known as the Emperor is the counterpart to the urRu urSu the Master. The two were originally the urSkek leader SoSu, skekSo is described in \"The World of The Dark Crystal\" as originally being an energetic ruler who enjoyed lavish festivity and winning at sporting events but age made him paranoid and spiteful to even his fellow Skeksis, elevating individuals to high positions only to depose them afterward. SkekSo appears as the main antagonist of \"The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance\", which chronologically precedes the 1982 film, where he attempts to harness and control the energy of the Darkening, which causes his body to corrode at a quicker pace compared to the other Skeksis, leading to his eventual death shown in the original film's beginning. Once skekSo died, due to urSu willing himself to death to disrupt the Skeksis' hierarchy to give Jen a fighting chance against them, skekUng succeeded him as Emperor. In the film's deleted scenes, skekSo's decayed remains are cremated. He also has an appearance in \"Legends of the Dark Crystal\".\n\nIn the film, he is performed by Jim Henson and voiced by Jerry Nelson. In \"The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance\", skekSo is performed by Dave Chapman and voiced by Jason Isaacs.\n\nAlso known as the Chamberlain is the counterpart to the urRu urSol the Chanter. skekSil is the Skeksis's chief secretary of state and next in line as Emperor of the Skeksis, being part of skekSo's Diplomatic Allegiance which also consisted of skekEkt and skekOk. However, skekSil is despised by the other Skeksis for his wheedling voice and underhanded nature, most notably by skekUng. During the events of \"Legends of the Dark Crystal\", skekSil attempted to trick the Gelfling into distrusting the urRu while protecting his right of succession when it was being threatened by skekLach. In the first season of \"Age of Resistance\", skekSil is revealed to have influenced skekTek in developing essence extraction and the creation of the Garthim. He also is the driving force behind the events of the show, from turning most of the Gelflings against Rian and each other, to securing the downfall and death of skekVar after he is replaced as the Emperor's closest advisor. In the film, skekSil's confrontation with skekUng over succession resulted in his exile, the removal of his robes, and he attempts to regain his position by capturing a Gelfling. Of all the Skeksis, skekSil's intentions are never fully revealed and seem contradictory, most notably when he forcibly brought Kira to the other Skeksis and refused to allow them to kill her. When Kira was brought to the Skeksis, skekUng had skekSil reinstated and his robes returned to him. When the Crystal was restored, skekSil was absorbed by urSol as they reverted into their original urSkek form SilSol. \n\nIn the comic book sequel \"The Power of the Dark Crystal\", taking place a century after the events of the movie, skekSil and the other Skeksis were reconstituted due to Thurma removing the Shard from the Crystal. Immediately ostracized by his comrades for causing their previous defeat, skeksil pursues Thurma and Kensho and use the Shard to force the other Skesis to submit to him. But he ends up being destroyed by the restored Crystal as it reformed itself into the Prism, housing his spirit and urSol within it.\n\nIn the film, he is performed by Frank Oz and voiced by Barry Dennen. In \"The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance\", he is performed by Warrick Brownlow-Pike and voiced by Simon Pegg.\n\nAlso known as the Garthim-Master or the General is the counterpart to the urRu urIm the Healer and the main antagonist of the original 1982 film. skekUng succeeds skekSo as Skeksis Emperor after his death in the film's beginning. His activities in the years leading up to the Garthim War are unclear, but he is absent from the events of \"The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance\", mentioned only in passing as the rest of the Skeksis consider recalling all of their number in their duel against the Gelfling, being identified as a \"strong warrior\" by skekZok the Ritual Master. Being the second strongest of the Skeksis, he was previously leader of the military allegiance after replacing skekVar upon his death. He had a bitter rivalry with skekSil, which culminated in a duel for supremacy. Though the other Skeksis admire his ferocity, his constant failure to capture the surviving Gelfling fails to evoke the respect of his subjects. He is suspicious of skekZok's loyalty, and is constantly fearing a challenge to his authority. When the Crystal was restored, skekUng was absorbed by urIm as they reverted into their original urSkek form UngIm, who leads the urSkeks back to their world.\n\nIn the film, he is performed by Dave Goelz and voiced by Michael Kilgarriff.\n\nAlso known as the Ritual-Master is the counterpart to the urRu urZah the Ritual-Guardian. skekZok is the high priest who oversees the Skeksis' rituals and leader of the Religious Allegiance. Until the story of the film, skekZok \"fancied himself skekSo's closest adviser, and sought to control the other Skeksis through false prophecies and apparitions, although they distrusted his divinations and practised their own.\" Though a contender for the throne after skekSo's death, skekZok sides with skekUng. Though he assists in the search for the surviving Gelfling with his Crystal bats, he is nonetheless distrusted and feared by skekUng. When skekSil arrived with Kira, he was annoyed at skekUng's commands to drain Kira of essence before killing her, as he insisted she must be killed immediately. Ironically, skekZok's impulse to kill Kira the moment she threw the Shard to Jen led to the Skeksis' downfall with skekZok absorbed by urZah back into their original urSkek form ZokZah.\n\nIn the film, he is performed by Jim Henson and voiced by Jerry Nelson. In \"The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance\", he is performed by Victor Yerrid and voiced by Keegan-Michael Key.\n\nAlso known as the Scientist is the counterpart to the urRu urTih the Alchemist. his obsession depraved to the point of amputating his two right limbs and replacing them with prosthetics and replacing his jugular vein with a transparent tube, skekTek is the Skeksis who conducts his research and experiments in the Castle's Chamber of Life. Through both skekSo's abuse and skekSil's influence, skekTek learned to harness the Dark Crystal's ability to extract essence and created the Garthim. He was once considered a friend of Aughra, having mentored her when he and urTih were originally the urSkek TekTih. During the events of \"The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance\", skekTek outfitted himself with a visual prosthesis after his right eye was ripped out by a Peeper Beetle as punishment for failing to prevent the Gelfling Rian from escaping with a vial of essence. By the time of the film, he had replaced his jugular vein with a transparent external tube to monitor his own circulation and his right arm and right leg with mechanical prosthetics and can be seen leaning on a cane. Because of his maltreatment by the other Skeksis, skekTek outright called himself \"the most abused creature in all of Thra\". skekSil provided skekTek with Gruenak helpers before later killing them, using one of them for parts in creating the Garthim. During the film, skekTek sided with skekUng after he became the new Emperor and convinced him to let him drain Kira of her essence, but Kira persuaded all the laboratory animals skekTek experimented on to attack him, resulting in him losing his footing and falling down the Crystal Shaft into the magma below with urTih incinerated as a result. skekTek has appearances in \"Legends of the Dark Crystal\".\n\nHe is performed and voiced by Steve Whitmire in the film. In \"The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance\", he is performed by Olly Taylor and voiced by Mark Hamill.\n\nAlso known as the Gourmand is the counterpart to the urRu urAmaj the Cook. skekAyuk is a gluttonous Skeksis who uses his status as the court's gourmet expert to devise menus for the feasts, preferring strong flavors and living prey. He is occasionally seen alongside both skekEkt and skekShod, being hypocritical in belittling his fellow Skeksis. In the novel, both he and skekEkt are part of skekSo's faction and support skekSil before turning on him once he loses. In the film, he and skekShod ultimately support skekZok. When the Crystal was restored, skekAyuk was absorbed by urAmaj as they reverted into their original urSkek form AyukAmaj.\n\nIn the film, he is performed by Louise Gold and voiced by Thick Wilson. In \"The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance\", he is performed again by Louise Gold and voiced by Harvey Fierstein.\n\nAlso known as the Ornamentalist is the counterpart to the urRu urUtt the Weaver. skekEkt is the more effeminate of the Skeksis and wears elaborate clothing that reflects his vanity. Despite possessing a genuine gift as a designer, skekEkt is nonetheless described in \"The World of the Dark Crystal\" as an extremely vain and callous character who would gladly cause the death of countless animals for the sake of fabricating one cloak. According to skekSil's thoughts in \"The Dark Crystal\" novelization, skekEkt's uncharismatic depravity was considered excessive, even by the standards of the Skeksis, to the point where it would never command their obedience. He has the responsibility of giving the final say in the selection of experimental Podling slaves modified by skekTek for ritual choruses. He is occasionally seen alongside both skekOk and skekAyuk. Interestingly, skekOk and skekAyuk are loyal to skekSil like skekEkt (depending on the film and novel versions) before turning on him once he loses. When the Crystal was restored, skekEkt was absorbed by urUtt as they reverted into their original urSkek form EktUtt.\n\nIn the film, he is performed and voiced by Brian Muehl. In \"The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance\", he is performed and voiced by Alice Dinnean.\n\nAlso known as the Slave-Master is the counterpart to the urRu urNol the Herbalist. skekNa is the supervisor and disciplinarian of the Skeksis' slaves. He is described in \"The World of the Dark Crystal\" as \"purely and openly evil from the beginning\" and in \"The Dark Crystal\" novelization as having \"no imagination and no nobility at all.\" He has a hook for a left hand and an eye patch to hide his missing right eye. He dubiously claims to have an ear for music, and takes it upon himself to select specific slaves for skekTek to experiment upon. Along with skekTek, he is a strong supporter of skekUng, and at one point was considered for promotion to the rank of Patriarch for his loyalty. When the Crystal was restored, skekNa was absorbed by urNol as they reverted into their original urSkek form NaNol. He was mentioned by skekZok in \"The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance\", as skekOk considers calling the rest of the Skeksis back to the Castle during their battle against the Gelflings, noting that he, like skekSa the Mariner, is \"useful in a fight.\"\n\nIn the film, he is performed by Mike Quinn and voiced by David Buck.\n\nAlso known as the Treasurer is the counterpart to the urRu urYod the Numerologist. administratively skekSil's subordinate, skekShod is incapable of acknowledging anyone's presence unless offered some gift. Due to his limited vocabulary and excessive material desires, he frequently bribes the other Skeksis into loaning him their personal possessions. While not appearing in \"Age of Resistance\", skekShod appears in the comic book sidestory which reveals him to oversee the Spritons' tithes and caused Hup's exile from Sami Thicket when he provoked the Podling to hit him. Along with skekAyuk and skekOk, he is a supporter of skekZok following skekSo's death. When the Crystal was restored, skekShod was absorbed by urYod as they reverted into their original urSkek form ShodYod.\n\nIn the film, he is performed by Tim Rose and voiced by Charles Collingwood.\n\nAlso known as the Scroll-Keeper is the counterpart to the urRu urAc the Scribe. skekOk is the smallest and most deceptive of the Skeksis who prides himself in his writing skills and owns a private library in the castle depicting numerous secrets. skekOk uses his talents as a historian to alter the documentation of his kind's history to suit his propaganda while pleasing his shifting allies. He was also prone to mood swings and could often be found mumbling to himself. He was always late for the Skeksis' meetings and very often fell asleep during them. In \"Age of Resistance\" skekOk is also shown to have diplomatic talents that rival skekSil's, being in charge of recording (and occasionally extorting) the tributes given to the Skeksis by the Gelfling. He also \"befriends\" Brea for a while, and suggests summoning the rest of the Skeksis back to the castle after skekMal turns up nearing death. In the film, his loyalty is ultimately to skekSil. In the novel, his loyalty is to skekZok. When the Crystal was restored, skekOk was absorbed by urAc as they reverted into their original urSkek form OkAc.\n\nIn the film, he is performed by Bob Payne and voiced by John Baddeley. In \"The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance\", he is performed and voiced by Neil Sterenberg.\n\nThrough the years various comics and novels were made which serve as prequels to the events of the film, introducing various Skeksis. Over the time their living number, names, positions and even counterparts were changed. This is evident since current canon claims there were 18 Skeksis to begin with yet throughout all forms of The Dark Crystal media there are around 20 individual Skeksis names.\n\nAlso known as the General is the counterpart to the urRu urMa. skekVar is a loyal but violent and short-tempered military leader who killed All-Maudra Mayrin when she learned of her people being used by the Skeksis to prolong their lives. When skekVar was named the Emperor's new council in place of skekSil, he ended up being secretly murdered by skekSil in a scheme to regain their Emperor's trust while destroying skekVar's reputation. Before his death, he along with the Chamberlain, brought forth to the Emperor and Scientist the idea of Soldiers that would be soulless yet loyal: these would later become the Garthim. However, with skekVar gone, all the Skeksis, in particular the Scientist, would later lay claim to their creation.\n\nskekVar first appeared in the two volume manga \"Legends of the Dark Crystal\" by Tokyopop, the three volume series \"The Dark Crytal: Creation Myths\" by Archaia Comics, and other media created by the Jim Henson Company, though his role in the story was slightly altered.\n\nHis first on camera appearance was in the Netflix prequel series \"The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance\", performed by Kevin Clash and Katherine Smee, and voiced by Benedict Wong.\n\nAlso known as the Collector is the counterpart to the urRu urSen. skekLach is a sickly and jaded Skeksis who is also known for his role in overseeing the Gelfling's tribute. Appearing in the first season of \"Age of Resistance\", skekLach is killed by exploding in a pile of pus when Deet uses her powers to redirect the Darkening's energy back at the Skeksis. His design and personality has differed in his various appearances: in the comics depicted with a mechanised arm, elaborate coat, and a scarred face, been more cunning in a battle of wits with the Chamberlain, while secretly withholding Gelfling essence for himself and using skekVar as a scapegoat.\n\nThey appeared in \"The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance\", performed by Helena Smee and voiced by Awkwafina.\n\nKnown as the Hunter is the counterpart to the urRu urVa, the Archer. skekMal is a Skeksis introduced in the J.M. Lee novel \"Shadows of the Dark Crystal\". He also appears in \"The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance\", wearing a spirit-like skull mask that conceals his scarred face. Considering himself a sportsman who relentlessly hunts his quarry down, skekMal is a brutal killer so feared even by his own kind that they tend to summon his services as a last resort. Thus few Gelfling knew of his existence as he eats his prey and keeps their skulls as his trophies. He is skilled in trapping and combat, being one of the few Skeksis to use his extra arms in a fight, with animalistic movement. Hired by skekSil to acquire Rian, skekMal's hunt brings him in conflict with urVa. When skekMal was badly wounded by urVa, he brought Brea back to the Skeksis' castle before collapsing. As the Skeksis worked to keep him alive, Aughra offered her lifeforce in order for skekMal to be saved. During the battle in Stone-In-The-Wood, urVa commits suicide by jumping to his doom in order to stop his counterpart for good. This enables Aughra to be reconstituted. In episode 8 of \"The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance\", Aughra expresses some fondness for him, declaring that skekMal was \"the most beautiful of the lot\" despite his scent of death.\n\nIn \"The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance\", SkekMal is performed by Kevin Clash, in-suit performed by Nick Kellington, voiced by Ralph Ineson.\n\nPreviously known as the Conqueror, eccentric in personality, skekGra originally served as a militant leader in the Skeksis until he and his urRu counterpart urGoh both received a vision of the eventual reunion of their races into their original selves. Both desired to merge back into the urSkek GraGoh, but skekGra was cast out by the Skeksis as \"The Heretic\" for his attempts to convince them to rejoin their urRu counterparts. skekGra and urGoh were forced to live together in self-imposed exile in the Crystal Desert where they waited for the Gelfling Rian, Brea, and Deet so they could give them the Crystal Shard that was concealed in the Dual Glaive sword they forged. SkekGra eventually became rather boisterous and eccentric, describing himself as \"the fun Skeksis,\" and he and urGoh became skilled at the art of puppetry.\n\nIn \"Age of Resistance\", skekGra is performed by Damian Farrell and voiced by Andy Samberg.\n\nIntroduced only in \"Legends of the Dark Crystal: Volume 2: Trial by Fire\", he was an ally of skekVar the General. skekEer was the Spy-Master, but neither his urRu counterpart nor urSkek name has never been depicted or identified. Since the new books and the prequel show, skekEer has been removed from canon, with skekNa revealed to be the Skeksis in charge of spies before becoming the slave master.\n\nThe Skeksis Mariner skekCru was first introduced in volume 2 of Tokyopop's \"Legends of the Dark Crystal\" and was a political ally of skekVar the General, along with the Spy-Master, skekEer, and had little to say in the manga. The Mariner would be revamped as a female Skeksis called skekSa (also known as the Captain) and was as a major character in the J.M. Lee novel \"Tides of the Dark Crystal\", making her a canon Skeksis. Her urRu counterpart was urSan the Swimmer; they made the urSkek SaSan. skekZok mentions skekSa in \"The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance\" while considering recruiting more Skeksis to help battle the Gelfling, noting that she, like skekNa the Slave Master, is \"useful in a fight.\"\n\nskekLi was the Skeksis Satirist who wrote stories for the enjoyment of the Skeksis. His urRu counterpart was urLii the Storyteller, making the urSkek LiLii. He was the main antagonist in the J.M. Lee novel \"Song of the Dark Crystal\", making him a canon Skeksis. skekOk mentions him in \"The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance,\" when the other Skeksis consider recalling more Skeksis to help fight against the Gelfling.\n\nThese were two Skeksis seen at the end of Volume 2 of \"The Dark Crystal: Creation Myths\" from Archaia Comics, and who died immediately after the botched division of the urSkeks when a rogue Skeksis killed their urRu counterparts: one was strangled while the other was thrown into the fire shaft under the Crystal. In the J.M.Lee novel \"Flames of the Dark Crystal\" their back story is changed with only one of them dying when their urRu counterpart is killed by another Skeksis who attacks it with a crystal staff. it is currently unknown how the canon events play out. skekHak's urRu counterpart was urHom and the two formed HakHom the urSkek Architect, while skekYi's counterpart was urYa, making the urSkek YiYa whose position is unknown. Their deaths established the knowledge of the Skeksis and urRu still being connected, with the former race leaving their counterparts alone out of self-preservation. Either both or one of them are indirectly mentioned in \"Age of Resistance\" by skekZok when he mentions that no Skeksis died between the events of their creation and the Gelfing's rebellion after the news of skekMal's first death. If, in the canon story, skekHak survived, it is implied he was the one who remodelled the Crystal Castle to better resemble the Skeksis themselves, while if he died, other sources claim skekShod and skekNa remodelled the Crystal Castle, as punishment for defying skekSo's position as Emperor.\n\nThese Skeksis appear in the original film, the Netflix prequel series, and J.M. Lee novels (\"Shadows of the Dark Crystal\", \"Song of the Dark Crystal\", \"Tides of the Dark Crystal\", and \"Flames of the Dark Crystal\").\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2041261", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2041261", "title": "Ayyavazhi mythology", "text": "Ayyavazhi mythology\n\nAyyavazhi mythology is the mythology of the South Indian religious faith known as Ayyavazhi, which is officially considered a Hindu sect. The main source of Ayyavazhi mythology is the Ayyavazhi scripture, Akilathirattu Ammanai, and its supplement, Arul Nool. The Akilathirattu Ammanai is a recitation by \"Mayon\" (the Tamil name for Vishnu, or Lord Narayana) to his consort Lakshmi. It is divided into three sections: Early Avatars, incarnational events and post-incarnational events.\n\nThe early avatars are all those that occurred prior to the earthly incarnation of Mayon.\n\nThe first \"Yuga\" (\"aeon\" or \"era\") was called Neetiya Yuga. During this time, divine, human and all other virtues flourished without hindrance. They did not fear demons, and there was perfect harmony among the creatures of the Universe, as well as among those who lived in the Fourteen Worlds. In this yuga, the king was righteous and did not oppress his people through taxes or other means.\n\nDuring this peaceful time, Kroni was born. Kroni, who is analogous to Satan in the Christian tradition, is a primordial personification of evil. Though Kroni is said to have been born with multitudinous limbs, each the size of a mountain, he nevertheless assumes different forms in different yugas: as Ravana or Duryodhana, for example. Likewise, Mayon also incarnates in different yugas as different \"Avatars\": for example Rama or Krishna.\n\nIn order to quell the ravenous hunger in his stomach, Kroni drank all of the waters of the sea. With these waters being insufficient, he swallowed \"Kailayam\", the abode of \"Sivan\" (the Tamil name for Shiva), and then proceeded to devour the entire universe. Akilam one: 440-446. ()\n\nMayon, residing with Sivan in \"Kailayam\", escaped to undertake \"tavam\" (\"tapas\", meaning \"austerity\") and to receive permission from Sivan to destroy Kroni. Isvaran granted this permission, but made Mayon aware of the necessity to appear in different forms in the successive six yukams in order to destroy the Six Fragments of Kroni. Following this advice, Mayon sliced Kroni into six fragments and saved the universe. The first yuga thus came to an end.\n\nIn the second yuga, called \"Chathura Yuga\", one of the six pieces of Kroni was formed into a creature named Kuntomasali. It had the shape and size of a mammoth leech, and when it disturbed the tavam of those in Tava lokam (the land of austerity), Mayon destroyed the leech by catching it with a hook.\n\nIn the third yuga, called Netu Yuga, another fragment of Kroni created two wicked individuals called Thillaimallalan and Mallosivahanan. They ruled over the people by extracting \"Uliyam\" and \"Iraikal\" (taxes) from them. When this exploitation became unbearable, the Devas (celestial beings) complained to Sivan, who, in turn, commissioned Mayon to carry out the destruction of the wicked rulers, which he did.\n\nThe fourth yuga was called Kretha Yuga. The third fragment of Kroni was, again, made into two siblings, called Suraparppan and Sinhamuka Asuran, and they were given responsibility to rule the Earth. The wicked rulers began to crush the Devas, who reported it to Mayon. Mayon took the form of Arumugan, the Tamil name for Kartikeya, and advised the rulers to desist from their wickedness. However, when they arrogantly spurned his advice, Arumugan eliminated them. During the same Yuga, Suraparppan was created, this time as Iraniyan. Mayon, incarnated as the son of Iraniyan (Prahlada), challenged his authority and finally took on the therianthropic form of man and lion (Narasimha) by piercing his stomach. On his deathbed, Mayon asked him to repent, but he replied arrogantly: \"You cannot kill me. Only by placing ten mountains as ten nails might you kill me. Otherwise you can't.\"\n\nIn the ensuing yuga, called Thretha Yuga, Sivan, as per the request of Mayon, created the fourth piece of the primordial Kroni as a ten-headed mighty warrior, with the ten mountains as ten heads, naming him as Ravanan. He oppressed all those living on Earth by extracting Uliyam from them. He subdued all the earthly kings and made them pay tributes to him. Suffering under his oppression, the Devas sought the help of Mayon who, for the purpose of destroying him, took birth as Raman. On his death-bed, he repented, saying: \"Only with the help of my brother were you able to destroy me.\" With this episode of killing Ravanan, Thretha Yuga came to an end.\n\nIn the sixth yuga, called Dwapara Yuga, the fifth fragment of Kroni was portioned into a hundred pieces, and made into Duriyodhanan and ninety-nine brothers to support him. The three brothers of Raman, along with Vibushanan and Sampoovan of the preceding epoch, were created as Pancha Pandavas in this aeon. The wicked Duriyodhanan was killed by the Pancha Pandavas, with the support of Mayon, who came in the form of Krishna. Even at the brink of death, Duriyodhanan refused to repent, saying that \"only with your cunning mind were you able to defeat me, and otherwise not.\" Mayon then told him: \"You will be created with knowledge, intelligence, and artistic skill in the next Yukam, and if you do not repent in that age, that will be your eternal annihilation.\" Having said this, Mayon went to Srirangam and dwelt there.\n\nTowards the end of Dwapara Yuga, Thirumal (Mayon), with the aid of Seven Virgins (Saptha Kanniyar), had begotten seven sons, known as the Santror Makkal (see Santror Pirappu), in order to accomplish the task of destroying the Kalineesan and Kali mayai (Kali Yuga Maya) that were to be countered in the following Kali Yuga.\n\nAfter the birth of Santror, they were all named by conducting a naming ceremony (see The Naming ceremony of Santror) and fed with celestial nectar (see Feeding the children with Celestial Nectar). The Santror were raised by Bhadrakali and married to the daughters of Nirupathirajan (see Fostered by the acclaimed Deity Patrakali).\n\nThe sixth fragment of the primordial Kroni was Neesan, the epitome of wickedness ((Tamil \"neesa\" meaning \"wickedness\"). Neesan was created in the form of a male human being who was wise, beautiful and intelligent. Neesan pushed himself out of the earth in an inverted form. Upon seeing his appearance, the celestial diviners predicted that he, being without normal human parentage, would have an undefined and rude physique, and that his intelligence and five senses would be rooted in falsehood. They further predicted that he would have a life as fragile as that of a bird, but he would unleash wickedness on people with arrogance.\n\nHaving obtained innumerable boons (see Boons), including the Chakra of Mayon and invincibility, Neesan proceeded to earth to rule over the people. On his way, he was accosted by Thirumal, who appeared as a Pantaram (an itinerant mendicant), with long flowing unkempt hair and torn clothes. Thirumal challenged him to a duel which Neesan refused, considering it beneath his dignity to fight with a Pantaram coming in such an attire without any weapon. Taking the opportune moment, Thirumal shrewdly made Neesan promise to forfeit all his boons if any of his lies caused trouble to any Pantaram on earth in the future. Then, he bought the Chakra from Kaliyan and cursed it as money. The money asked Thirumal when this curse would leave it, to which Thirumal replied: \"It will leave you when Kali is defeated\".\n\nThe Neesan was thenceforth called Kalineesan because the Kali Yuga had dawned along with his birth. Along with him was born an evil force called Kali Mayai (Kali Yuga Maya). The \"Kali\" here refers to the evil spirit behind \"Kali Yuga\" and not \"Kali\", the Hindu deity).\n\nKali Maya engulfed the whole world and consequently, deceit and illusion began to contaminate the minds of the people. Age-old traditions and conventions, based on Dharmam, were unduly overthrown. Kalineesan introduced the discrimination of caste among the people. The powerless people were crushed with brute might. People, caught in the Kalimayai, began to be inimical towards one another - men against women, children against parents, and so forth. People used demonic force to harm one another. Kalimayai captured the king of Thiruvitankur and began to rule over the people as their king.\n\nThirumal, dwelling at Sri Rangam hitherto, found it unworthy of his abode because of the misdeeds of the priests there. He shifted his tent to Thiruvananthapuram. When he reached there, a Pulayar woman saw him and spread the news to one and all. Hearing of this, Kalineesan constructed a temple of fine granite at the site where the Pulayar woman spotted Tirumal, and decorated the temple with gold and pearls. The king instituted scores of rituals and ceremonies at the temple to be performed by Namboothiri Brahmins. The lights of the temple were, however, lit daily from a torch brought from the home of the Pulayar woman.\n\nKalineesan had no children, so he went on a pilgrimage to Kasi, a holy place, and stood in \"tavam\" (spiritual suffering) for a son. While performing the \"tavam\", he was distracted by the scene of a cleric embracing a woman. Because of this, Kalineesan's semen came out and fell into the water. A white crane came and swallowed the semen, became pregnant, and delivered a baby boy in the water. A sage, Punal Rhishi, took the baby, which was white in appearance, and looked after it.\n\nKalineesan, his \"tavam\" being defective, returned to his country in despair, resigned to a prediction that even if he were to have a son, it would be only the sons of his sister who would rule the country.\n\nThe baby, delivered by the white crane, grew up and came of age, and was married in the land of Chenkomatti. He prospered there with his progeny, who later emerged as a powerful people by learning the skills of ship-travel, trading in gold and silver, and diplomacy. This people, called Venneesa kulam, propagated a religion of their own, and through the lure of money gained many new members. Venneesan (the name comes from two words, \"venmai\" meaning \"white,\" and \"neesan,\" meaning \"wicked person\") introduced a new calendar.\n\nKalineesan, coming to know about the valour and loyalty of the Santror people, appointed them as his bodyguards. It so happened that one day, while guarding the entrance of the king’s room, the body-guards happened to fall asleep, during which time, the enemies of the king, hailing from the king’s own race, entered the room and assassinated the king. The Kalineesan, while succumbing to the murderous attack, mistaking it to be a betrayal by the body-guards, cursed them that they and their progeny would be oppressed with oozhiyam (coolie service) and regressive taxation as long as the king’s dynasty ruled the country.\nThe curse of the king began to take effect on the Santror. The Kalineesan, the successor of the previous king, imposed innumerable taxes on every article used by the Santror for their day to day living. Their occupational implements, the palmyra trees that supported them, and every item of the produce of these trees were punitively taxed. The produce of the palmyra trees was to be given to the high castes, failing which the Santror were tortured with corporal punishments. There were many arbitrary taxes imposed on them. The Santror found no favour with the rules, in spite of paying these cruel taxes.\n\nHaving witnessed the woes of the Santror, Mayon admonished the king to desist from oppressing them. He reminded the king that it was his seventh birth, coming in the lineage of the primordial Kroni, and if he failed to repent during this opportunity, then it would be his eternal damnation. He exhorted him to revoke the cruel taxes and the exploitative system of uliyam, imposed on the Santror, the people born of Mayon's seeds.\n\nThe king retorted, saying:\n\nResponding to the king, Mayon said:\nPeeved at the response of Mayon, the king mockingly said: \"If you have not tasted any of my offerings, what then have you to do with me? Go wherever you want to...\" Listening to the impenitent and brute words of the king, divine rage overcame Mayon and he said: \"You have mocked at me and ill-treated me as you do to the Chanar. Lo, I am going away from your place to Thiruchendur. I will take on you in another form. Then, I will perform a Dharmam that you and the world will acknowledge as the greatest. I will destroy the pervasive demonic cult and crown the Chanar\".\n\nHaving said these things, Mayon deserted Thiruvananthapuram. He told the people: \"Henceforth, let all castes united as one people, come to the place where I am going to dwell\". Having said this, he proceeded to Thiruchendur. It happened then that the fortress of the Kalineesan crashed into pieces. The earth was covered with darkness of slumber, the sea engulfed the land, and all the palatial buildings of the king were effaced. Seeing these calamities, the Brahmins lamented and the priests wailed.\nMayon took his abode at the seashore of Thiruchendur. During this time, the venneesan had spread his wicked rule over the country, trampling upon the traditions of the land. He flouted the principles of \"Dharma\", observed by the Santror and failed to give the dignity due to them.\n\nIncarnational events include preparations for incarnation, the event of incarnation, and the proclamations and instructions given to the newly incarnated god. Since Mayon's incarnation, as Lord Vaikundar, is the foremost power, this is considered to be the most important part in Akilathirattu Ammanai. Below is an elaboration of these events.\n\nSeeing the degraded status of the Santror, the celestial gods made a plea to Mayon as follows: \"Our young brothers, the Santror, are suffering endlessly under the yoke of the centuries old oozhiyam and have lost dignity and respect on account of that. Have you not seen their iniquities?\" \nAfter listening to the plea, Mayon prepared for the incarnation. He made all the celestial gods take birth in the world in order to assist in destroying the kali. He set out to create new cattle, reptiles, birds, plants, trees, and all other elements of nature that would befit the new age of Dharma Yukam because the Dharma Yukam was to be characterised by a new life, new people, and new thinking. In that new age Shastras, Vedas and all the religions would be the same; the Tamil language would permeate the world; people would live united as a single humanity; the people of Mayon would live with pristine glory and they would flourish with all prosperity; the earth would yield abundantly; diseases, calamities and the impact of the evil magical practices would not affect the people; the old Shastras would be turned untrue, and instead, a new code would be enshrined.\n\nMayon then enunciated the attributes of his children who would be his collaborators in the world. He said:\n\nBefore the incarnation of Mayon could take place, the three godheads decided to send a final admonition with the name of Thiruvasakam to Kalineesan that he might amend\". (see : Thiruvasakam (Ayyavazhi))\"\n\nKalineesan did not pay heed to the Thiruvasakam. Mayon then decided to incarnate as Vaikundar and, to that effect, walked towards the seashore of Thiruchendur. \nWhen the day came, Lord Narayana then instantly went into the sea, amidst the chanting of the celestial gods. Inside the sea, enveloping himself in a scorching flame, he approached Lakshmi who was awaiting his arrival in the form of a Lotus pedestal. Afraid of the ball of flame approaching her, Lakshmi worshipped it with reverence. Mayon revealed himself and took Lakshmi and told her of his intention to create a son. By that time, Mayon had come into the sea. Then, Lord Narayana himself incarnated as Vaikundar during an encounter with a deity Goddess Lakshmi, he was beget inside the sea and arose from the sea of Tiruchendur on Kollam Year 1008 at 20th day of Tamil Month Masi (1st March 1833 CE, Friday).\n\nI (Hari Gopalan) am writing these words of Akilattirattu Ammanai with the grace of God!\n\n“ ‘O’ Lord you took avatar for Pandavas and eliminated their enemies. \n\n    You attained the abode of Kailasa with anger due to birth of Kaliyan. \n\n     Came again to the world to protect santror (good people) and dharma” \n\n“On Masi 1008, I (Lord Narayana) myself appeared as Pantaram on the banks of sea, have taken residence in Theksanapuri as Vaikundar” – Akilattirattu\n\nAkilattirattu says, Lord Narayana himself incarnated as Vaikundar and appeared as Pantaram on the banks of sea. This place became a holy place for the devotees of Ayya vazhi and they erected a temple there named Avathara pathi.\n\nGod says this prophecy, \n\n\"I (Lord Narayana) took the avatar for yuga trail and became the praise child for Sita.\n\nAs a king of Dharma yuga, I am going to rule the world with single command\" – Akilattirattu\n\nHe then imparted certain arcane knowledge in the form of proclamations and instructions, known as Vinchai, to his newly niall son, Vaikundar. \"(see: Vinchai to Vaikundar)\"\n\nHaving given these exhortations, Mayon called his son intimately as Narayana Vaikundar and told him that if these teachings were observed strictly, the illusory force of kali would be contained and when people learned to live with self-respect, Kali would destroy itself.\n\nThen the whole array of celestial gods sang lullabies (See:Thalattu, Palli Unarthal, Abayam.), praising the special attributes of the newly born child, Vaikundar. They praised him for having been born as the child of Mayon, in the race of Chanar, in order to teach the virtue of Dharmam to the world and to incinerate Kali.\n\nLord Vaikundar, having received all the instructions from his father, walked out of the sea to go into the world. Mayon sent two celestial sages (Kalai Muni and Gnana Muni) with him as witnesses to his activities. Vaikundar took the human form as Pantaram at Tharuvaiyur near seashore. From the point of incarnation of Vaikundar, it is said that he will destroy Kaliyan and the evil in Kali Yuga. It is also said that he will take all righteous people along with him in the succeeding eighth yuga called as Dharma yuga.\n\nThe various episodes, that are portrayed to be occurring after the event of incarnation, are called here as post-incarnational events. Given below is an elaboration of them.\n\nVaikundar crossed over to the land from the sea and showing a human appearance as Narayana Pantaram to the mother of Muthukutty (alias Sampoornadevan), told her: \"Woman, you had been Muthukutty mother before the year 1008 (AD 1833). I (Narayana) have been born as Vaikundar, the child of Mayon. I have received powers for redeeming the Santror. I am going to destroy the evilmongers and rule the world under a single command.\" Having said this, Vaikundar set out towards Detchanam (Dakshin, the south).\n\nVaikundar walked towards Detchanam, along the sea route. All along his path, the creatures of the sea and the animals of the forest greeted him, expressing their happiness, for they were to be freed from the clutches of Kali. Vaikundar, announcing the glad tidings to everyone, traversed the path towards Manavaippathi (Puvantantoppu) in Detchanam. The itinerant Vaikundar, reaching the temple of Pakavathi at Kanyakumari, told her that he, the Narayana Vaikundar, had come to uplift the lowly by ruling the world under the banner of Dharmam and therefore, she was to rescind from accepting any sacrifices or offerings.\n\nMaking himself known to the people as Vaikundar, the great Narayana took his abode under a tree at the entrance of Manavaippathi.\n\nWhen a year and a half had passed after undertaking the Tavam, people complained to Vaikundar of the disturbances caused by the demons in the world. Vaikundar, intending to put an end to the misdeeds of the demons, thought of incinerating them totally. He then summoned a celestial sage and sought his counsel on this matter. The sage, after going through the Akamankal (Agamas), told Vaikundar:\n\nVaikundar then assembled all the demons in one place. He made some persons in the gathering, who were accustomed to ‘possession’, to get ‘possessed’ of the demons in the presence of the people. The demons that had ‘come on to these persons’ began to tremble with fear and, by making loud cries, bemoaned their end. Resigned to their fate, they requested Vaikundar to tell them the modalities to surrender. When the demons asked it themselves, Vaikundar ordered them to make an oath in front of the people that they had surrendered all their powers. Accordingly, the demons made a public oath that they had surrendered all their powers. Then they fled to the mountain and killed themselves by falling into fire. As this happened, those that were dancing due to the ‘possession’ of the demons got exhausted and fell flat on the grounds. As the crowd was witnessing all these happenings, a few shepherds, tending their flock in the mountain, came rushing and reported that they heard the loud cries of the demons as they were falling in the fire. When the crowd heard these, they appreciated the way the demons were destroyed and acknowledged that Vaikundar was really the Narayanar needed for the country.\n\nHaving destroyed the demons, Vaikundar thought of incarcerating the powers of Malaiyarasar, the people of the mountain who performed black magic, witchcraft, sorcery, etc., with the aid of evil spirits. No sooner had he thought of it than the wild animals, being released from the clutches of the Malaiyaracar, went berserk and attacked the people ferociously. Horrified at the behaviour of the animals, the Malaiyaracar resorted to their usual black magic to contain the animals. But, alas, this time, their magic did not work. Disappointed and worried, they became panicky and sought the help of a Kuratti, the village astrologer, to make them known the cause of these events.\n\nKuratti, hearing their woes, told them that Vaikundar had incarnated to eradicate the sufferings of all and therefore, they would do well to meet him to get rid of their woes. Coming to know of Vaikundar, the Malaiyaracar came to him immediately and pleaded with him to solve their problems. Vaikundar told them it was time for the destruction of all the evil forces and therefore, they would do well to surrender the knowledge of black magic, witchcraft, sorcery, and trickery, the spells used to bind others, and all types of esoteric charms in their possession. If refused to comply, they were warned of severe consequences. Hearing the admonition from Vaikundar, and fearing the consequences of the refusal to surrender, they agreed to hand over all their powers to him. Since they had not brought with them the manuscript documents that contained the spells, they vowed in front of Vaikundar and the people that they would never again resort to these practices. When they did so, Vaikundar advised and blessed them to take to cultivation as an alternative profession. When this was done, the celestial Gods wrote it in the heavenly records that Vaikundar had done away with the evil forces and had made Dharmam to prosper in the world.\n\nHaving incinerated the demons and seized the powers of the Malaiyaracar, Vaikundar exhorted the people as follows:\n\nListening to these exhortations, people of all castes realised that kalimayai was being destroyed and Dharmam was established. Vaikundar brought Dharmam also to the flora and fauna, exhorting them not to hurt or kill each other, and not to crush the weak, but to live in harmony as one family.\nPeople came as one family and listened to the exhortations of Dharmam given by Vaikundar. They accepted him in their hearts as the undisputed God and lived happily.\n\nAt this time round, the king of Thiruvithankur, the Kalineesan came to Suchindrum for his routine visit. He was an agitated man. With his powers already been curtailed by the foreigners, he wanted to know whether there was any one else in his kingdom that could challenge his authority. The ministers told him as follows:\n\nListening to this, the king grew weary. He summoned a seer to know whether the news was true. The seer confirmed it, saying it was time the great Vishnu incarnated as Vaikundar. The king retorted to the seer saying:\n\n\"\"\"Even if the great Vishnu wanted to incarnate, would he, leaving aside the honourable Namboothiri and other Brahmin caste, come into this untouchable Chanar people? It looks to be a cheating\".\"\n\nListening to the king, an elderly person from a shepherd caste, who was in the assembly, advised the king saying:\n\n\"\"\"If Vishnu wants, he will take birth in any race and in any form. He may come as a Panan or a Pariyan. So better not to disturb this person\".\"\n\nThe king was infuriated and was not ready to listen to anyone's counsel. He ordered one of the chiefs of the army to bring Vaikuntar to him. Accordingly, a squad of soldiers came and surrounded Vaikundar who was sitting on a cot, performing his tavam. As the troops prepared to seize him, the Santror, standing near Vaikundar, got enraged and readied to attack the troops. Sensing trouble, Vaikundar prevented the Santror saying:\n\nThe army personnel, then, took hold of Vaikundar, tied him with a rope, and tortured him ruthlessly. They questioned him with spite:\n\nHe was then led along the streets to the king. The wicked people threw stones at him, pulled his long hair and teased him, calling him demoniac. Some people from the low castes accused him of bringing disgrace to their race. Vaikundar did not utter a word in response. He reached Suchindram and was brought in front of the king.\nThe king wanted to test Vaikundar's powers. He hid a ring in the palm of his hand and asked him to name it. Vaikundar, being aware of the fact that showing his powers would not aid his mission in any way but that it would only precipitate matters unduly, remained reticent. The king, being hurt by his silence, ordered him to be tortured more. Five kinds of poison were mixed in an arrack and given to him to drink. Vaikundar drank it as if he were drinking milk and remained unaffected. Seeing that the poison had not worked, Vaikundar was confined in a stinking prison, infested with worms and leeches. Vaikundar took upon himself all these sufferings for the sake of his poor Chanar.\n\nThen Vaikundar was led through Kottar, Chunkankadai, Thuckalay, Padmanabhapuram, Balaramapuram, and brought to Thiruvananthapuram where he was detained in an open prison. While in the prison, many people came and worshipped him.\n\nThe Kalineesan did not relent from torturing Vaikundar. He ordered him to be thrown to a starving tiger. In that, Ayya Vaikundar proves to the world, his Power (see Katuvai Sothanai).\n\nAfter that event, a person known as Poovandar went up to the king, and testifying to the genuineness of Vaikundar, pleaded for his release. The king, considering the request, wanted Vaikundar to sign a document as a condition for the release. The condition was that he would not any more gather the different castes, except his own, into one place. Vaikundar tore the piece of material that contained the condition into pieces and threw it on to the ground. However, the king did not wish to retain him in the prison anymore.\n\nVaikundar chose the nineteenth of the Tamil month Masi (February/March) to be the day of his release. His devotees, the Santror, carried him on a cradle through Balaramapuram, Parvathipuram, Kottar, Suchindram and reached back to Thamaraippathi.\n\nBack in Tamaraipathi, Vaikundar continued according to the instructions of his Father. He instructed the people to undertake a tavam called thuvayal thavam (\"thuvay\" means \"to wash\") which was also called Thuvayal Thavasu, an act of ritual washing of one's physique and clothes along with practice of self-abnegation and self-restraint.\n\nEven as Vaikundar was continuing to instruct and serve the people, he intended to marry the seven virgins. He made some people of Chanar, young and old, male and female, get into a trance and dance. He made some of them narrate the accounts of the world, and of the story of the seven virgins carrying the seeds of Mayon and delivering the seven sons of the Chanar.\n\nVaikundar then, putting on the appearance of Narayana, made the Santror, who stood around him, to walk in the four directions and call out to their mothers, the Seven Virgins. The seven divine mothers, listening to the call of their sons, came out and paid respect to Vaikundar who had come to marry them and give them back their children as it was promised to them in their previous birth.\n\nOnce the divine mothers came, after confirming their desire to get married and to get back their children, Vaikundar announced to the world the news of the marriage of the Seven Virgins with Vaikundar. Vaikundar then asked the Santror what they would give as gift to the bridegroom. (see: Thirukkalyana Ekanai).\n\nThe Santror, the kith and kin of the brides, answered that all their wealth, even their very lives could be given as gift to him. Vaikundar then requested the Santror to take and give the hands of the seven virgins to him in marriage. When they did it ceremoniously, Vaikundar placed a glittering golden chain around the necks of the seven divine women.\n\nThe celestial saints then praised the special attributes of the marriage partners, and the race in which they hailed from. Then, singing the praises of Narayana and praying that he might fulfil his mission of ushering in the Dharma Yukam, the brides and the bridegroom circumambulated the ‘Pathi’ in their ceremonial attire. The supplications of the brides were that Vaikundar should destroy the evil age, usher in the age of Dharma, and make his people rule the Dharma Yukam .\n\nWhen the marriage had taken place as per the earlier promise, the Santror realised that all the curses incurred by them had been erased and there was no curse anymore on their race. People came from all directions to pay homage to Vaikundar and presented him with various gifts.\n\nVaikundar thought of organising festivals and celebrations with the people who garnered around him. He fixed Sunday, the day of his birth in the sea, to be the day in every week for celebrations. People gathered there on every Sunday, bringing him gifts. They decorated the vicinity with flowers and festoons. Amidst crackers of fireworks and music of joy, the seven virgins, dressing themselves in saffron and sporting the Namam (sacred symbol on the forehead), came in grand procession on the streets alone with Vaikundar. Ayya Vaikundar, as a Pantaram, had donned himself in squalid rags, smeared the white mark on the body, tied a turf on his hair, and carried a cane. Besides his disciples, a large number of Santror came in procession along with him. Those who had participated in the thuvayal thavam also accompanied him by chanting the prayer, \"Siva Siva\" Those men and women, that were ‘taken hold of by divine power’, sang the praises of Narayaya and accompanied the procession.\n\nDuring the procession, Vaikundar was carried in a golden cradle. A conch shell was blown, womenfolk made kuravai, and the celestial gods were showering flowers from above. People held these festivals in high esteem.\n\nVaikundar, being instructed through a dream that occurred to one of his followers, came to Moolakuntappati (Ambalappathi) with his kith and kin. Here he enthroned himself like a reigning king on a grand seat in a mansion built with pearls, designed with a pedestal for conducting the Ukattheerppu (the judgment). He vested himself in white silk, wore a golden cap on the head, and arbitrated for the people. People celebrated his presence there.\n\nVaikundar then decided to marry deities such as Pakavathi (Bhagavati), Valli, Theivanai, Mantaikattal, Lakshmi, Parvathi and Poomadanthai. He took on different forms and told the deities that they were to be united with him in order to destroy Kali Yukam and establish the Dharma Yukam. Then, compelling each deity to seduce a woman in the gathering, he married them in a grand manner.\n\nVaikundar, having married these deities, continued his activities among his people. People flocked to him in large numbers. They were pleased to invite him to their houses. They took him in chariots, arranged grand feasts in his honour, and presented him with very valuable gifts. Vaikundar laid the foundation for Nizhal Thangals in some villages that he visited.\n\nHaving accomplished whatever he intended doing, Vaikundar thought of attaining Vaikundam, i.e., leaving this world and going to the world of Vaikundam. He prayed to Thirumal to take him back as he had accomplished his mission. Thirumal, too, had thought of calling his son back, and so he commanded his sages to decorate the house for his son in Vaikundam.\n\nVaikundar then began contemplating on Vaikundam alone. As he was preparing, he instructed his Santror not to be afraid, and to live united in love. He gave them a white mark on their forehead. Then he began his journey to Vaikundam on 1126, Itabam 21, at noon. As he reached Vaikundam, Thirumal and Isvaran received him warmly. The Devas praised him for his singular, unsurpassable achievement of the tavam that he had undertaken for the sake of destroying the Kali.\n\nWhen he was received in the celestial abode, his women and children on earth interned his golden body, erected a temple and conducted celebrations regularly.\n\nIn Vaikundam, Thirumal asked his son whether he had fulfilled, without any flaw, all that had been told to him earlier. Vaikundar, in response, told him about the six-year tavam and other activities. The sages who had been sent to accompany him vouched for the flawlessness of the tavam he undertook. \nBeing satisfied at the performance of Vaikundar, Thirumal and Isvaran crowned him gloriously, gave him a sceptre and other divine paraphernalia, and seated him on the throne. While on the throne in Vaikundam, he was worshipped by his people on earth. All those who stood by him and served him when he undertook the tavam were granted happiness on earth, besides the assurance of a life with him in Vaikundam. Those Neesakulam that opposed and tortured him were condemned to hell.\n\nOnce Vaikundar was crowned as the king, everything belonging to Dharma Yukam appeared as per the wish of Vaikundar. People worthy of Dharma Yukam, including his children and women, appeared instantly. A whole lot of new creatures, animals, plants and trees appeared. A new earth, new moon, new sky, new wind, etc. emerged. The wicked people disappeared and the people, worthy of Dharma Yukam, appeared. All those living beings, that had been ordered to come up at the coronation of Vaikundar, awoke to the new age. All those unworthy of Dharma Yukam were engulfed by the sea.\n\nThen, Thirumal brought up the life of Kroni for judgment.\n\nThirumal interrogated him as follows:\n\nKalineesan, then, without having anything to say, surrendered all his powers and boons. The force of illusion took hold of him and put him into the flames of the abyss where the devils resided. All the evil forces of the kalimayai were also destroyed likewise. And then, Vaikundar blew a conch shell to announce his victory.\nHearing the sound of the conch-shell, all that befitted Dharma Yukam - the virtues, the Sastirankal, the plants and trees, the reptiles and the birds, the divine women and their children - all gathered around Vaikundar. He gave them blessings, and instructed them to live fearlessly. He enjoined upon them to assemble in one place, to drink from the same well, and live happily as per the values of Dharma Yukam.\n\n\n\n"}

Small retailers were also concerned not to upset their bigger customers by voting differently from them. Radicals, such as the Chartists, had long campaigned for this system to end with the introduction of a secret ballot.\n\nThe Representation of the People Act 1867 (the Second Reform Act) enfranchised the skilled working class in borough constituencies, and it was felt that, due to their economic circumstances, these voters would be particularly susceptible to bribery, intimidation, or blackmail. The radical John Bright expressed concerns that tenants would face the threat of eviction were they to vote against the wishes of their landlord. It fell to Edward Aldam Leatham, husband of John Bright's sister, to introduce the Ballot Act on leave.\n\nMany within the establishment had opposed the introduction of a secret ballot. They felt that pressure from patrons on tenants was legitimate and that a secret ballot was simply unmanly and cowardly. Lord Russell voiced his opposition to the creation of a culture of secrecy in elections which he believed should be public affairs. He saw it as 'an obvious prelude from household to universal suffrage'.\n\nElection spending at the time was unlimited, and many voters would take bribes from both sides. While the secret ballot might have had some effect in reducing corruption in British politics, the Corrupt and Illegal Practices Prevention Act 1883 formalised the position and is seen by many to have been the key legislation in the attempts to end electoral corruption.\n\nThis Act, in combination with the Municipal Elections Act 1875 and the Parliamentary Elections (Returning Officers) Act 1875, is considered to have ushered in the electoral practices of today.\n\nThe secret ballot mandated by the Act was first used on 15 August 1872 to re-elect Hugh Childers as MP for Pontefract in a ministerial by-election, following his appointment as Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster. The original ballot box, sealed in wax with a liquorice stamp, is held at Pontefract museum. 16% of those who voted were illiterate and special arrangements had to be made to record their previously open oral votes.\n\nThe Ballot Act 1872 was of particular importance in Ireland, as it enabled tenants to vote against the landlord class in parliamentary elections. The principal result of the Act was seen in the General Election of 1880, which marked the end of a landlord interest in both Ireland and Great Britain.\n\nThe Act inspired Belgian minister Jules Malou to implement a similar system in Belgium, which he did with the act of 9 July 1877 (\"la loi du 9 juillet 1877 sur le secret du vote et les fraudes électorales\"). The following elections of 1878 were a victory for the Liberal Party.\n\n"}

After her father's arrest, she moved to China and married a Russian, becoming known as Elena Volkov, around 1923.\n\nThe couple emigrated to San Francisco, California in 1924 where their son, Anatole Boris Volkov was born the same year. (There is no known link between Volkov and \"Pop Folkoff\" or Volkov or Isaac Folkoff, another communist based in San Francisco.) Shortly after their son's birth the couple separated. Helen began a relationship with Nathan Gregory Silvermaster; the couple wed in 1930 and remained married until Nathan's death in 1964. \n\nThe couple came to Washington D.C. in 1939. In Washington, she was one of the leaders of the Washington Bookshop, the American League for Peace and Democracy, the Washington Committee for Aid to China, and the National Federation for Constitutional Liberties. All these organizations were Comintern and CPUSA sponsored organizations. Her code name with Soviet intelligence, identified in Venona decrypts, was \"Dora\".\n\nAt first, Jacob Golos was the main contact of the Silvermaster group but his failing health meant that he used Elizabeth Bentley to collect information from the house. Helen was highly suspicious of Bentley and she told Golos that she was convinced that she was an undercover agent for the FBI. Golos told her that she was being ridiculous and that she had no choice but to work with her. The Silvermasters reluctantly accepted Bentley as their new contact.\n\nKathryn S. Olmsted, the author of \"Red Spy Queen\" (2002), points out: \"Every two weeks, Elizabeth would travel to Washington to pick up documents from the Silvermasters, collect their Party dues, and deliver Communist literature. Soon the flow of documents grew so large that Ullmann, an amateur photographer, set up a darkroom in their basement. Elizabeth usually collected at least two or three rolls of microfilmed secret documents, and one time received as many as forty. She would stuff all the film and documents into a knitting bag or other innocent feminine accessory, then take it back to New York on the train.\" Moscow complained that around half of the photographed documents received in the summer of 1944 were unreadable and suggested that Ullmann received more training. However, Pavel Fitin, who was responsible for analyzing the material, described it as very important data.\n\nShe died on December 22, 1991 in Beach Haven, New Jersey, aged 92.\n\n\n"}

He was an important leader in the Jewish community, and was the vice president of the Jewish Agency for Western Poland and a member of the Zionist Central Committee. In 1938, he was engaged to Sophia Backenrot, although the marriage was postponed until after the war.\n\nOn 18 November 1939, during the early months of the Nazi occupation of Poland, Oskar Schindler was first introduced to Stern, who was then working as an accountant for Schindler's fellow Abwehr agent Josef \"Sepp\" Aue, who had taken over Stern's formerly Jewish-owned place of employment as a (trustee). Schindler showed Stern the balance sheet of a company he was thinking of acquiring, an enamelware manufacturer called Ltd owned by a consortium of Jewish businessmen (including Abraham Bankier) that had filed for bankruptcy earlier that year. Stern advised him that rather than running the company as a trusteeship under the auspices of the (Main Trustee Office for the East), he should buy or lease the business directly, as that would give him more freedom from the dictates of the Nazis, including the freedom to hire more Jews. Despite Stern being Jewish and Schindler being a member of the Nazi Party, Schindler was friendly to Stern. Later, Stern said of the meeting:\n\nI did not know what he wanted and I was frightened... [until] December 1, we Polish Jews had been left more or less alone. They had Aryanized the factories, of course. And if a German asked you a question in the street it was compulsory for you to precede your answer with I am a Jew...' But it was only on December 1 that we had to begin wearing the Star of David. It was just as the situation had begun to grow worse for the Jews, when the Sword of Damocles was already over our heads, that I had this meeting with Oskar Schindler.\n\nIn a later meeting, Stern informed Schindler that he could use Jewish slave labour to staff his factory, \"\" (German Enamelware Factory) at a lower price than Polish laborers, which would also allow those laborers to be protected from deportations. Schindler followed his suggestion, which began his rescue activities of Jews during the Holocaust.\n\nKraków's Jews were imprisoned in the Kraków Ghetto six months after German troops invaded Kraków. The ghetto was fully liquidated in 1943. Those considered useful (to be used as slave labor) were sent to Płaszów, including Schindler's workers and Stern. The rest were sent to various death camps across Poland. In Płaszów, Stern and his brother Natan, along with Mietek Pemper and Joseph Bau, were forced to work in Płaszów's office, where they came into frequent contact with the camp's notorious commandant, Amon Göth. Stern helped Pemper in his efforts to prevent the closure and liquidation of Płaszów, knowing that while conditions there were terrible, liquidation likely meant the deaths of every prisoner. Stern kept in contact with Schindler throughout this time and worked to better conditions for the Jews, including transferring workers to Schindler's factory, distributing aid money, and attempting to inform the outside world of their plight.\n\nIn 1944, when the closure of Płaszów became inevitable, Schindler decided to open a new factory, the Brünnlitz labor camp, in Brněnec, occupied Czechoslovakia, for his Jewish workers in order to prevent them from being sent to death camps. Stern and the surviving members of his family were placed on the famous list to be transferred to Brünnlitz by Schindler, although Stern's mother died of illness when she, along with the other female , were transferred to Auschwitz before Schindler could arrange their transfer to Brünnlitz. The male , including Stern and Natan, were transported to Gross-Rosen before they were sent to the relative safety of Brünnlitz, where Stern worked directly with Schindler and became one of the leaders of the Jewish workers. Schindler, due to his Nazi Party and the Abwehr membership, was in danger of being arrested after the defeat of Nazi Germany. Stern and the other Jewish leaders wrote a letter attesting to Schindler's rescue of Jews, which they gave to Schindler before he fled to American lines.\n\nAfter the liberation of the Brünnlitz camp by the Red Army, Stern moved to Paris, France and eventually emigrated to Israel. He advocated for Schindler to be recognized more broadly, even writing a pamphlet about his rescue activity. Stern remained friends with Schindler for the rest of his life, corresponding with him until his death in 1969. It was reported that Schindler \"cried inconsolably\" at his funeral.\n\nIn 1938, Stern was engaged to Sophia Backenrot, who survived the war due to her Aryan appearance in the Drohobycz ghetto. Their marriage was postponed until the end of the war in 1945. They remained married until Stern's death at age 68.\n\nHe was portrayed in the 1993 film \"Schindler's List\" by English actor Ben Kingsley. At the end of the film, Stern's widow Sophia appears in a procession of and the actors who portrayed them, placing stones on Schindler's grave on Mount Zion, which is a Jewish tradition showing respect for the deceased. Stern's brother Natan was also one of the in the procession.\n"}

The game was first published in 1997 in Europe by Infogrames Multimedia, and in late August of 1998 in North America. An additional campaign was designed, packaged with the original game and released in 1999 as Independence War Deluxe Edition in North America and Independence War Special Edition in Europe.\n\nThe sequel \"\" was released in 2001.\n\nAs the captain of \"Dreadnaught\", the player could assume the command of any of the four workstations on the command bridge. From the \"command\" station (\"CMD\"), the player received his/her mission briefings and could sometimes control other ships through a remote link. The station also had access to an accurate star map. The ship was normally flown from the \"navigation\" station (\"NAV\"). From the \"weapons\" station (\"WEP\"), the player had an outside view of \"Dreadnaught's\" wire frame model. Following a locked target, the angle of view could rotate 360 degrees on all axes. This workstation also had a ripple fire mode which allowed attacking quickly a large group of enemies. The fourth station \"engineering\" (\"ENG\") was for controlling the repairs when the ship was damaged by weapons or a collision with another object. However, the automated repair functioned well and player supervision was rarely needed. The station also had a fuel gauge, which was nonfunctional because the game design was changed to give \"Dreadnaught\" limitless fuel.\n\nIn the game, the player takes the role of an unnamed 23rd century spaceship captain in the Earth Commonwealth Navy. The primary opponents were rebellious insurgents called the Indies, a group distinguished by their elaborately and colourfully painted ships.\n\nI-War was notable for its use of Newtonian physics; unlike other popular space combat games such as \"Wing Commander\" and \"\", the flight model is subject to inertia caused by a ship's mass and the absence of drag in outer space. In addition to common flight dynamics, vessels can move and accelerate in all directions: up, down, forward, backwards and sideways.\n\nThe game features two gameplay modes: campaign mode, and a mode for immediate space battle with endlessly spawning enemies. The campaign consists of a series of 40 linear missions, with one or more missions being available at a time. After completing a key mission, one or more new missions become available. Sometimes a different set of missions can be unlocked depending of the outcome of the previous mission, thus setting the campaign in different directions. Three different endings to the campaign were possible. The nature of missions varied greatly; there were many combinations of combat and problem solving. The puzzles often made use of the game's physics modeling.\n\nDepending on the mission, \"Dreadnaught\" can be acting alone, supporting another vessel, or commanding a group of wingmen. During other missions, various special equipment is at the player's disposal, such as a reconnaissance drone.\n\nThe player ship is armed with Particle Beam cannons and various kinds of missiles. For protection, the ship is equipped with energy shields, that are capable of tracking and absorbing enemy fire from a single ship at a time. The bridge of the player ship is a small ship of its own, called the 'command section'. It is capable of detaching from the rest of the ship.\n\nDuring LDS-travel, ships are not able to use any weapons except missiles designed to stop LDS-travel. Ships in LDS cannot be attacked, either.\n\nThe game began with a 14 minute long high quality CGI animation to introduce the game's setting and even some gameplay features through the story of Jefferson Clay and his last battle. Along the campaign, shorter pieces of CGI encoded in RAD Game Tools's Smacker video format would be shown within missions as cutscenes. These sometimes provided clues to solving some problematic aspect of the current mission. Simple CGI animations utilising wire frame models were used in mission briefings. Occasionally, external camera views were used for kind of real-time, game engine rendered cutscenes, such as when \"Dreadnaught\" docked or undocked with another ship or a space station.\n\nThe development of \"I-War\" was led by Particle Systems co-founders Glyn Williams (whose previous games include \"Warhead\" for Amiga and Atari ST) and Michael Powell (whose previous games include \"Subwar 2050\" for PC/DOS). With Williams and Powell included, \"Independence War\" had a development team of six men, which was the full personnel of Particle Systems at the time.\n\nThe games polygon models were created using BRender. The team wrote their own low-level routines for texturing.\n\nThe game had some naming troubles. \"I-War\" was originally signed to Philips Interactive Media, Inc., who were moving into PC games. At the time the game had merely a working title, \"big ships\". The first suggested name was \"Dreadnaught\", per the player ship, but it was considered to be meaningless to French and German audiences. The next name candidate was \"Infinity War\", which was found to be also a name of a Marvel Comics comic book miniseries, \"The Infinity War\". Therefore, the name was shortened to \"I-War\". At this time Philips Media was taken over by Infogrames, who became the publisher of the game.\n\n\"I-War\" was first released in Europe in November 1997, under the label of Ocean Software. Ocean was acquired by Infogrames earlier that year. This version, having no 3D hardware support, had only software rendered graphics. The game was released in English, French and German. \"I-War\" was a critical success, but wasn't selling as well as expected.\n\nIn late August, 1998, the game was released in North America, but as \"Independence War\". The reason for the name change was that 'I-War' was already trademarked in the US by Atari Corporation for an Atari Jaguar game of that name.\n\nThe American version was successful and won 'Space-Sim of the year' awards from many magazines and websites. Encouraged by this, an expanded edition was designed. \"I-War\" / \"Independence War\" sold around 250,000 copies worldwide. Including the special editions the total sales were about 300,000. \n\nLater, an additional campaign from the Indie side of the conflict, called \"Defiance\", was developed. The campaign consisted of 18 missions and it mirrored the \"I-War\" campaign. This time the player assumed the role of Edison Hayes, a captain of the Indie fleet and the \"Dreadnaught\"-class corvette \"Spartacus\". \"Defiance\" had three new features: in-mission savepoints, limited customisation of player ship's weapons and a zoom mode for longer range weapons fire.\n\nOriginally \"Defiance\" was supposed to be released as an expansion pack, but Infogrames decided they would prefer a special edition that would have both the new campaign and the original game in the same box. This special edition was released in the US as \"Independence War Deluxe Edition\" in 1999. The European version was released the same year, but was called \"Independence War Special Edition\" instead since it was reasoned that 'deluxe' doesn't mean much to the French or German audiences. The American version also included a $10 rebate for owners of \"Independence War\", but no rebate was included with the European version. On May 25, 2010, GOG.com re-released \"Independence War Deluxe Edition\" digitally.\n\nThe development of \"Defiance\" was led by Stephen Robertson who also maintained a strong and long lasting on-line presence helping players of the \"Independence War\" series.\n\nThe game won \"Computer Games Strategy Plus\"s 1998 \"Sci-Fi Simulation of the Year\" award. The editors wrote, \"With mission-driven play, good graphics, and detailed space combat action, this European import turned out to be quite a hit on this side of the Atlantic.\"\n\nThe Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences nominated \"I-War\" for its 1998 \"Simulation Game of the Year\" award, although it lost to \"\".\n\n"}

She was scrapped in 1931.\n\nThe \"Clemson\" class was a repeat of the preceding although more fuel capacity was added. The ships displaced at standard load and at deep load. They had an overall length of , a beam of and a draught of . They had a crew of 6 officers and 108 enlisted men.\n\nPerformance differed radically between the ships of the class, often due to poor workmanship. The \"Clemson\" class was powered by two steam turbines, each driving one propeller shaft, using steam provided by four water-tube boilers. The turbines were designed to produce a total of intended to reach a speed of . The ships carried a maximum of of fuel oil which was intended gave them a range of at .\n\nThe ships were armed with four 4-inch (102 mm) guns in single mounts and were fitted with two 1-pounder guns for anti-aircraft defense. In many ships a shortage of 1-pounders caused them to be replaced by 3-inch (76 mm) guns. Their primary weapon, though, was their torpedo battery of a dozen 21 inch (533 mm) torpedo tubes in four triple mounts. They also carried a pair of depth charge rails. A \"Y-gun\" depth charge thrower was added to many ships.\n\n\"Case\", named for Augustus Case, was launched 21 September 1919 by Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation, Squantum, Massachusetts; sponsored by Miss A. R. Case; commissioned 8 December 1919, Commander C. S. Joyce in command; and reported to Destroyer Division 43, Atlantic Fleet.\n\nBetween January and July 1920, \"Case\" operated along the east coast, and on winter maneuvers in the Caribbean, during which she obtained tactical data for Naval War College study. From July 1920 through December 1921, she operated in reduced commission with fifty per cent of complement. Beginning in December 1921, \"Case\" was permanently assigned to Destroyer Division 25 for a regular schedule of operations designed to keep her operational readiness at its maximum. Along with gunnery and engineering exercises and competitions, she joined the fleet annually in maneuvers and war problems.\n\nFrom 1924 to 1925, \"Case\" was flagship of her division, and With it in April 1926 sailed to the European station, where the flag was shown and good-will created by visits to various British and Mediterranean ports. Returning to the United States a year later, the destroyer resumed operations along the east coast and in the Caribbean. Designated for scrapping in accordance with the London Naval Treaty in 1929, \"Case\" was decommissioned at Philadelphia 22 October 1930, and sold as a stripped hulk 17 January 1931.\n\n\n"}

In total 160 ships were built in the shipyards in the site. Now filled inland, the area is now being developed into condos along the Gardiner Expressway.\n\nThe ship building area was located near Old Fort York (where smaller vessels were built for the garrison) and Queens Wharf.\n\nIt was not until the late 19th Century when a formal shipyard began emerging in the area.\nThe first ship building company in the area was John Doty Company (John Doty and Sons) from 1890 to 1893. This company built 6 boats, paddle boat ferries and steamers.\n\nDoty was acquired by Bertram Engineering Works Company in 1893 and built a large number of vessels of various sizes. Bertram sold the shipyard to Canadian Shipbuilding Company in 1905 and operated until 1908. From 1908 to 1913 shipbuilding proved to be financially challenging to the new owners Toronto Shipyards (1908–1910) and the yard was abandoned until 1913.\n\nThor Iron Works acquired the yards in 1913 and built only 9 ships, mainly warships and cargo ships, before being bought out in 1917 by Dominion Shipbuilding and Repair Company Limited. Prior to 1918, shipbuilding was done in wharfs and finally in a shipyard built by Dominion. However Dominion shared the same fate as Toronto Shipyards and closed in 1920 after a strike caused the shipbuilder to go bankrupt.\n\nThe yards lay empty for two decades before being re-activated by the Government of Canada in 1941 to build minesweepers for the Royal Canadian Navy under the contractor Dufferin Shipbuilding Company Limited and then by federally owned Toronto Shipbuilding Company Limited. From 1943, the new owner Redfern Construction Company Limited built minesweepers for the Royal Navy. The last ship was completed in 1945 with the remainder orders cancelled. The shipbuilding industry came to a close in the area for good.\n\nFollowing World War II, the area remained industrial and served as docking facilities the nearby silos. Berths were filled in and in the 1980s industry was replaced with condos, a City of Toronto park (Toronto Music Garden) and a public marina by Harbourfront Corporation. Numerous marine uses exist at Spadina Quay today (2020) including Marina Quay West, numerous passenger vessels, a few active commercial tugs, a water taxi and Boatel on board B&B accommodation.\n\n"}

To date, Spider-Man has made appearances on over 15 gaming platforms, which also includes mobile games on mobile phones.\n\nThe Marvel Comics superhero Spider-Man was created by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko and first appeared in \"Amazing Fantasy\" #15 (August 1962).\n\nBy the late 1970s, Spider-Man had become a successful franchise. At this time the fictional character had already featured in the animated series \"Spider-Man\", a segment on the children's television series \"The Electric Company\" (called \"Spidey Super Stories\"), and the live action prime time series \"The Amazing Spider-Man\". As a result of the success, Marvel Comics licensed the character into a stream of electronic games.\n\nIn 1982, Parker Brothers published a game for the Atari 2600 (and its clone system, the Sears Video Arcade) titled \"Spider-Man\". The action game involves climbing a skyscraper, capturing criminals and defusing bombs set by the Green Goblin. It supports two players.\n\nIn 1984, Scott Adams released the second in the Questprobe series of text adventure games. The second in the series was titled \"Questprobe: Spider-Man\", and involved Spider-Man hunting for a series of gems at the behest of a mysterious character named the \"Chief Examiner\". The game was ported to the Commodore 64, Commodore 16, Atari 8-bit family, ZX Spectrum, PC, Amstrad CPC, and the Apple II. This was a first-person-perspective graphical adventure game, with commands entered textually.\n\nIn 1989, \"Spider-Man and Captain America in Doctor Doom's Revenge\" was released for PC DOS, Amiga, Atari ST, Amstrad CPC, ZX Spectrum and Commodore 64. The game was written by Paragon Software Corporation, and published by Medallist (a subsidiary of MicroProse). The story of the game is told in a series of comic panels, with the game play similar to that of \"Street Fighter\": The player, as either Captain America or Spider-Man, battles villains one-on-one until facing Doctor Doom.\n\nIn December 1989, \"The Revenge of Shinobi\" was released on the Mega Drive/Genesis. The game's boss battles feature comic book characters including Spider-Man and Batman, as well as famous movie characters, including Terminator and Godzilla, and even Rambo as normal-stage enemy. Initially, Spider-Man was included without consent from Marvel, but another version was released, this time with the copyright message shown in the beginning of the game, giving credit to Marvel, and editing the looks of Batman, Rambo and Godzilla, so avoiding a possible lawsuit; a Sega CD version was released, being derived from the altered version.\n\nIn the 1990s, comics enjoyed a boom, and the early 1990s saw a myriad of video games based on high-profile comic story lines and the 1994 \"Spider-Man: The Animated Series\".\n\n\"The Amazing Spider-Man\" was the first game of the decade released, a puzzle oriented action game developed by Oxford Digital Enterprises and released in 1990 for the Amiga and ported to MS-DOS, Commodore 64, and Atari ST.

Spider-Man appears between the action to offer advice on how to beat upcoming levels and swings in to rescue hostages once their captors have been shot.\n\n\"The Amazing Spider-Man vs. The Kingpin\", developed and published by Sega and released in 1990, was the first game featuring \"Spider-Man\" on Sega consoles. The game premiered on the Master System and Genesis in 1991, followed by the Game Gear in 1992, and to the Sega CD in 1993. Fundamentally, the game is the same on each platform with each iteration including new levels, enhanced graphics and a few incremental improvements to the game play. The story involves Spider-Man trying to collect six keys from six villains to defuse a bomb in New York planted by the Kingpin. Spider-Man has a finite supply of web fluid and the only way to replenish is to take photos, most profitably of the supervillains, to sell to the \"Daily Bugle\".\n\n\"\" was released in 1991 for coin-operated arcades.

It was first developed for the Super NES in 1992 by Software Creations (who went on to produce several games for Marvel) and published by LJN. The game was later ported to the Genesis in 1993. The game involves rescuing four of the mutant superhero X-Men (Wolverine, Cyclops, Storm, Gambit) from an assassin named Arcade. The player must navigate Spider-Man in search of the captured heroes (who join Spider-Man when found), fighting a variety of super villains. Software Creations later adapted the game to the Game Boy in 1993 and to Game Gear in 1994.\n\n\"\", released on Super NES and Genesis in 1994, was the first one of two major Marvel comic book storyline adaptations by Software Creations. \"\" released in 1995 for Super NES, Genesis and PC was the sequel. Both games are side scrolling beat-'em up action games where the player controls either Spider-Man or Venom, fighting various villains from the comic book plotlines.\n\n\"Spider-Man\" from 1995, was developed by Western Technologies and published by Acclaim on the Genesis, and by LJN on the Super NES. It marked the beginning of a range of software incorporating elements from the \"Spider-Man\" cartoon. The game is a side scrolling action platformer. The Super NES game features six levels, five bosses, and fourteen sub-bosses. The Genesis game features five levels, five bosses, and thirteen sub-bosses. The game also features the Fantastic Four.\n\n\"\" was released in 1995 for the Super Famicom exclusively in Japan, very loosely based on the mini-series \"The Lethal Foes of Spider-Man\".\n\nOver the years Tiger Electronics released several handheld LCD Spider-Man games.\n\n\"Spider-Man Cartoon Maker\", released in 1995 by Knowledge Adventure, is a software package that allowed the user to create films by utilizing an archive of backdrops, animations and props from the \"Spider-Man\" animated series. The game featured the voice of Christopher Daniel Barnes, who played Spider-Man in the series.\n\nThat same year Marvel attempted to release classic comic books onto CD-ROM. Only four were ever produced, based on Spider-Man, the X-Men, Iron Man and the Fantastic Four. The Spider-Man one titled, \"Marvel CD-ROM Comics featuring Spider-Man\" included animation from the series, trivia games, and four complete issues of the comic narrated by Christopher Daniel Barnes.\n\n\"Marvel Super Heroes\" for the CPS II arcade hardware was a result of the success of Capcom's fighting game \"\". It was developed by Capcom, released in 1995, ported to Sega Saturn, PlayStation and MS-DOS and features Spider-Man as a playable character.\n\n\"\", an unrelated action game, was released for the SNES in 1996. The game involves utilizing each of the Marvel superheroes through each of their levels to collect one of the Gems needed to complete the game. The SNES features Iron Man, Captain America, Hulk, Wolverine, and Spider-Man.\n\nAfter \"Children of the Atom\" and \"Marvel Super Heroes\", a partnership between Marvel and Capcom began, combining the two universes into the \"Marvel vs. Capcom\" fighting game series. Spider-Man would appear as a playable character in several titles:\nVenom also appears as a playable character in the latter two games.\nSpider-Man later returns in \"\".\n\nThis Spider-Man was seemingly killed by Morlun with a single punch during the events of Spider-Verse.\n\n\"\" was developed by Harutyun Zatikian in 1996 and published by Sega for the Sega 32X, as one the final titles for the add-on. The game is a platform action game similar to the previous Sega title, \"Spider-Man vs. The Kingpin\". This time Spider-Man teams up with Daredevil to prevent the invading forces of HYDRA from taking over New York City. The game is broken into six levels with bosses such as the Eel, Tangle, and the Super-Adaptoid.\n\n\"Spider-Man: The Sinister Six\", developed by Brooklyn Multimedia was an adventure game for the PC. The game was released in 1996 and published by Byron Preiss Multimedia. The game allowed the user to choose the path the narrative would take, interact with characters as Peter Parker, collect items, and confront various puzzles, boss battles, and mini games.\n\n\"Marvel Creativity Center\", released in 1997 for both PC and Apple Mac by Cloud 9 Interactive, teaches the user how to create comics, the 'Marvel Way' with Stan Lee and Spider-Man acting as guides. The \"story\" involves Marvel studios being infiltrated by a mystery villain who has broken contact with all the regular Marvel artists and writers, leaving it up to the user to plot, script, illustrate and letter a comic.\n\nThroughout the late 1990s, Marvel Comics suffered an industry slump with Marvel filing for bankruptcy, which explains the lack of \"Spider-Man\" games towards the end of the late 1990s. However, by 2000, Marvel was profitable again and was gearing up to drop the Comics Code Authority and established its own rating system. They began seriously licensing its characters for major feature film adaptations (with the commercially successful \"X-Men\" film premiering on July 14, 2000). By the late 2000s, new Spider-Man games were in the works, being published by Activision, until January 2, 2014, when the license expired.\n\nAs a symbolic gesture of Marvel's return the development of two separate \"Spider-Man\" titles for PlayStation and Game Boy Color were announced. Neversoft's PlayStation iteration was highly successful. Enhanced versions were ported by other developers to the Nintendo 64 in 2000 and PC CD-ROM and the Dreamcast in 2001. A sequel, \"\" was released in 2001 for the PlayStation and developed by Vicarious Visions. In those two games, Spider-Man was voiced by Rino Romano.\n\nA sequel to the Game Boy Color version, \"\" (not related to the NES Spider-Man: Return of the Sinister Six) was also released in 2001 and was developed by Torus Games.\n\nThe PlayStation Spider-Man utilized the same engine as \"Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2\" (released September 2000) which was also developed by Neversoft. As an easter egg, developer Neversoft Entertainment included the ability to play as \"Spider-Man\" if the player achieved a high level of success in 'career mode'.\n\nWhen the Game Boy Advance launched one of the earliest titles released was \"\" developed and published by Activision in 2001.\n\nIn September 2001, \"Spider-Man\" made a small appearance as one of the fighters in the fighting game by Paradox Development, \"\" for PlayStation.\n\nIn \"\", there was a deleted scene where Wolverine has his encounter with Spider-Man (again voiced by Rino Romano) in a ruined town. When Wolverine states that Spider-Man is off his home turf, Spider-Man states that he heard about the big bust-out at the Void and rode on the Charter Bus to the ruined town with the other superheroes that can't fly or teleport. When Spider-Man asks Wolverine if he needs help fighting Magneto, Wolverine tells him to deal with the chaos in town until Damage Control arrives.\n\nAs the live-action \"Spider-Man\" movie was released in 2002, a game developed by Treyarch titled, \"Spider-Man: The Movie\" was developed for PC, PlayStation 2, Xbox and Nintendo GameCube with a separate title developed by Digital Eclipse Software for Game Boy Advance. The game play was similar to that of Neversoft's previous Spider-Man game, except it featured for the first time aerial combat, and to an extent allowed the user to 'web sling' over New York openly, although not being able to land on the ground below. The game sported the voice of the actors from the film, including Tobey Maguire, Willem Dafoe, cult icon Bruce Campbell, and including Josh Keaton as Harry Osborn and in a bonus story-mode where he wears Norman's Green Goblin gear.\n\nAfter the critical success of both the first Spider-Man film and the video game releases, Marvel ordered a wider selection of titles to coincide with the release of \"Spider-Man 2\". The flagship titles being Treyarch's \"Spider-Man 2: The Game\" for PlayStation 2, Xbox and Nintendo GameCube, which extended the open environment concept started by their previous title. Unlike the previous generation of games based on the film, Treyarch's game was not released for the PC, and in its stead was an original game developed by Fizz Factor. The reasons for this remain unclear, and Fizz Factors game did not include the open environment game play as seen in Treyarch's game and appeared to be targeted towards a younger audience, despite the game being marketed the same as the console release. Later, in 2005, another version of \"Spider-Man 2\", this time for Sony's new handheld, the PlayStation Portable; which debuted in the first quarter of the year along with the system, was released. The PSP version of Spider-Man 2 was the first action games for the PSP, Spider-Man has to stay at a certain height, and Vulture is exclusive to the PSP version. The PlayStation, Xbox and GameCube got high critical acclaim and is often the basis for comparison for other Spider-Man video games.\n\nIn 2007 \"Spider-Man 3: The Game\" was released for PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, PC, PlayStation 2, PSP and Nintendo DS. It's very similar to the prequel. The Next Gen version of the game was developed by Treyarch, the other console version was developed by Vicarious Visions, and the PC version by Beenox. Xbox and Nintendo GameCube versions of the game were planned, but later cancelled due to low sales for Xbox and limited resources for GameCube.\n\nSony Pictures Mobile released a Spider-Man game for wireless phone in 2003. The game was such a success that a number of titles were planned to be released alongside the \"Spider-Man 2\" film. Some titles were delayed and are slowly being released. Current titles include; \"Spider-Man vs. Doc Ock\" (May 2004) (a multi-level action-adventure game where Spider-Man battles Doc Ock), \"Spider-Man 2 Pinball\" (May 2004) (virtual pinball game, themed with Spider-Man & Doc Ock characters), \"Spider-Man 2 3D: NY Subway\" (April 2005) (the player acts as Spider-Man as he leaps, swings and soars through the city, defeating thugs and ultimately facing off with Doc Ock. The 3D games feature superior graphics and sound and showcase the advanced capabilities of new mobile handsets) and \"Spider-Man 2 Text Messaging Games\" (players must show their knowledge of Spider-Man trivia and navigate through a mission-based text game). Other hand handheld versions developed appeared on the Nintendo DS and Game Boy Advance by Vicarious Visions and N-Gage by Backbone Entertainment.\n\nIn November 2004, in time for Christmas JakksTVGames released an all inclusive controller that includes an ATV input jack, to operate as a console plugged straight into a TV. It was titled \"Spider-Man Controller with 5 TV Games\", and as the name suggests includes five original video games each with a different goal; \"Streets of the City\", \"Spider Training\", \"Venom's Vindication\", \"Escape from the Sewers\", and \"Vulture's Venture\".\n\nAdditionally, Micro Games of America towards the end of 2004 released a portable LCD game, titled \"Spider-Man 2\". Sony Pictures has also released, their own LCD game, titled \"Spider-Man 2 Hand Held Game\" and a virtual reality head set portable game titled, \"Spider-Man 2 VR 3D\".\n\nAs 2005 began, Activision released \"Spider-Man & Friends\" for PC. It was developed by their internal company, Activision Value and targeted towards young children. It featured action game based gameplay with various puzzles used as a learning tool. In March, Activision Value released their second title based on the Spider-Man franchise, \"Spider-Man Print Studio\". The software allows the user to print various calendars, posters, bookmarks, flyers, door hangers, and masks from a library of pre-existing Spider-Man themed art, with Spider-Man as a guide to show the user the software.\n\nSpider-Man is featured in \"Ultimate Spider-Man\", voiced by Sean Marquette. Based on the Marvel Comics' Ultimate Spider-Man, it was released on September 22, 2005 for Nintendo GameCube, Xbox, PlayStation 2, Nintendo DS, PC, Mobile Phones, and Game Boy Advance. In this game, players get to play both hero Spider-Man and fan-favorite villain Venom in their own storylines. The game also introduces the new Comic Inking Animation technology, cel shading that makes the entire game appear as if it were a living comic-book. The writing and art design for Ultimate Spider-Man were done by Brian Michael Bendis and Mark Bagley, respectively, who both have worked on the comic book series of the same name since it was launched. The game's plot line also supposedly fits into the USM chronology, with issues 86 - 88 being advertised dealing with the aftermath of the events of the game. However, the issues did not deal with the game, and in fact had several continuity errors with the game (E.g. Silver Sable not knowing who Spider-Man is) and until Venom shows up again, it is open to interpretation where the game takes place.\n\nAlso in September 2005, \"\" was released, which includes both Spider-Man (voiced by Alistair Abell) and Venom as playable characters. The game was released for Nintendo GameCube, PlayStation 2, Xbox, PlayStation Portable and Nintendo DS.\n\nA spiritual sequel to \"\" was scheduled for release. A preview of the game was released containing a battle between Spider-Man and Doctor Doom, but due to the end of the partnership between EA and Marvel the game was cancelled.\n\nSpider-Man is a featured playable character in \"\", voiced by Quinton Flynn. The Scarlet Spider is an alternate costume for Spider-Man outside of his Classic, Symbiote, and Stark Armor costumes. Outside of playable character status, he is seen in the cutscenes with Captain America, Thor, and Wolverine. Spider-Man has special dialogue with various characters ranging from Dark Spider-Man and Dark Thor, Black Widow, Henry Pym, Lizard, Lockjaw, Mysterio, Rhino, Scorpion, and Shocker. A simulation disk has Spider-Man defending Dum Dum Dugan from Scorpion while on the S.H.I.E.L.D. Omega Base. Spider-Man shows mock envy to his allies during mission briefings, making comments on S.H.I.E.L.D's advanced Hellicarrier and Omega base, Tony Stark's wealth and the X-Men's relationship with the Shi'ar Empire.\n\nSpider-Man is also in \"\", voiced by Benjamin Diskin.\n\nThis Nintendo DS and Game Boy Advance video game \"\" was set in the Marvel Ultimate universe. Spider-Man is voiced by James Arnold Taylor.\n\nThe \"Spider-Man 3\" game was released at the same time as the film. The game is on all formats, with the PlayStation 3 receiving a Collector's Edition featuring an exclusive playable character - Harry Osborn's \"New Goblin\" persona. The black suit was handled differently by the different development teams that worked on the game, with some opting to keep the player in the costume until a certain point in the game whilst other versions of the game utilised the suit in a more strategic fashion, allowing the player to don or remove the costume while suffering side effects appropriate to how much the suit is worn. In October 2007, the New Goblin was released onto the Xbox LIVE Marketplace, making the PC version of \"Spider-Man 3\", besides the PS2 and Wii, the only version developed by Treyarch not to have the New Goblin as a playable character (Excluding fight against Sandman).\n\nIn 2007, two \"Spider-Man 3\" games were released for mobile devices, developed by Javaground USA and produced by Sony Online Entertainment. \"Spider Man 3 Action\" was released early in the year, followed by \"Spider-Man 3 Puzzle\" a few months later.\n\n\"\" was released on October 2, 2007 for Xbox 360, Wii, PlayStation 2, PC, PSP and Nintendo DS where James Arnold Taylor reprised his role of Spider-Man. The game is a different take on the three films, adding humor and story changes. Players can team up with a number of super villains from the comics, including Venom, Doc Ock, Green Goblin, Sandman, Black Cat, etc.\n\nStern Pinball has developed a Spider-Man pinball machine that encompasses all three Spider-Man theatrical releases, released in June 2007. This machine is designed by Steve Ritchie and programmed by Lyman Sheats.\n\nSpider-Man appears as the lead in \"\", voiced by Mike Vaughn. Released on October 21, 2008, \"Web of Shadows\" has received positive reviews with critics praising the idea of an original story, but citing poor polish and execution. Four separate versions of the game were released: a 3D action game for PS3, Xbox 360, Wii and Microsoft Windows, a 2.5D side-scrolling beat 'em up action game for the PlayStation Portable and PlayStation 2 (called Amazing Allies Edition), and a 2.5D side-scrolling brawler/platformer for the Nintendo DS.\n\nSpider-Man appears as one of the playable heroes in the \"Marvel Super Hero Squad\" with Josh Keaton reprising the role. Regular, symbiote, and 2099 versions of Spider-Man are playable.\n\nSpider-Man is also in \"\" voiced again by Josh Keaton, and he appears in \"Marvel Super Hero Squad Online\" voiced by Mikey Kelley.\n\nFour different versions of Spider-Man are playable in \"\", a game from Activision and Beenox.

It was formed on 10 September 1992 to unify specialist units into a single strategic reserve force that the regular officers need to call upon in any contingency plan and serious case of public disorder.\n\nThe current Commander of the SOC is SAC David Scott Arul and the Deputy Commander is DAC Tan Kiat Hee.\n\nThere are multiple regular and full-time national service specialist units under the SOC. The following units are as follows:\n\nThe SOC traces its history back to 1952, when an anti-riot squad of 60 police officers was formed in the wake of the Maria Hertogh riots, which broke out in 1950 and demonstrated the incapability of existing measures in containing serious cases of public disorder. The Police Task Force, predecessor of what is now the Police Tactical Unit, was hence created.\n\nOn 10 September 1992, the SOC was formally created to combine the Police Task Force, the Police Tactical Team, and the Police Dog Unit under one command. In 1993, the Special Tactics and Rescue was formed to replace the Police Tactical Team. Greater involvement of Police National Servicemen was seen with the inclusion of the National Servicemen Key Installation Unit in 1994, and the formation of the Police National Service Full-time Light Strike Force in 1998.\n\nIn response to changing demands in urban security issues, the Police MRT Unit was formed in 2005 to provide armed security within and around stations and trains on the Mass Rapid Transit network. Pooled from both regular and NSF manpower resources, they are the first SOC unit to be formed which involves regular front-line policing from inception. From 15 August 2009, the unit was renamed as the Public Transport Security Command and became an independent unit, separating from the SOC.\n\nUnder the Police Workplan Seminar 2017, a new National Servicemen unit called the Public Order Troops was formed on September 2018 under PTU and it can be called upon to work alongside their regular counterparts during major incidents such as riots, national emergencies and public order incidents, as well as possible terrorist attacks, and the POT will be implemented in the year 2023.\n\nThe SOC also sets up and coordinates the specially trained Peacekeeping Force personnel for missions overseas under command of the United Nations Department of Peacekeeping Operations.\n\n\nSOC troopers are typically armed with the MP5K, MP5N sub-machine guns and FN SCAR assault rifle. New weapons introduced from 2004 include the H&K 69, a grenade launcher which will replace the existing ARWEN 37. Their handguns will be replaced by the new H&K USP Compact, while the Sphinx 3000 will also be introduced.\n\nAs for Rapid Deployment Troops, they utilize new black BMW motorcycles with red and blue police lights and mounted circular riot shields designed to navigate through heavy traffic for fast tactical response to such public order incidents.\n\n \n"}
{"id": "2041373", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2041373", "title": "Toronto Drydock Company", "text": "Toronto Drydock Company\n\nToronto Drydock Company is a shipbuilding repair company in Canada and the name of two shipbuilders in the 19th and 20th centuries respectively.\n\nThe first Toronto Dry Dock Company was established in 1847 by William Botsford Jarvis (1799–1864) in the Province of Canada to build ships to ply the waters of the Great Lakes.\n\nAnother Toronto Dry Dock Company Limited was established in 1917 by several partners:\n\n\nToronto Dry Dock and its floating dry dock and yard were located along the south edge of Keating Channel, along with the related Toronto Ship Building Company, owned by the same principals. The company acquired the shipbuilding business of Patrick Dixon and son Harry J. Dixon) under the Ontario Companies Act to build larger ships, and during WW I Toronto Shipbuilding constructed two wood-hulled freighters in 1918, the \"War Ontario\" and \"War Toronto\", side-launching both into Keating Channel. The company remained in business until 1964 and was later acquired as part of the Port Weller Dry Docks.\n\nThe facilities were sold following the bankruptcy of Port Weller Dry Docks Limited, who moved the dry dock to Port Weller, Ontario and sold the facilities to Toronto Harbour Commission. The former dockyard is now used for storage by Harbourfront Centre and Port of Toronto (to store the airport ferries).\n\nThe current Toronto Drydock, founded in 1989 is a small marine repair facility built from the former Great Lakes pulpwood carrier Menier Consol (built in 1962 and converted as floating drydock after 1984) and located in the eastern Portland area in the Turning Basin along Basin Street and across from the former Hearn Generating Station.\n\nShipbuilding in Toronto dates back to the period when shipping was isolated to the Great Lakes. Early ship building was conducted by the Royal Navy for use in the Great Lakes, but several small, medium, and large private shipbuilding concerns developed during the 19th and early 20th centuries.\n\nPolson Iron Works, established in Toronto in 1883, was a major builder of steamers into the 1900s. Located at the foot of Sherbourne Street, the Iron Works produced around 150 assorted vessels, including ten steel-hulled minesweepers for the Royal Canadian Navy and Royal Navy, and six cargo vessels during World War I. After the war Polson declared bankruptcy and closed in 1919 due to lack orders and tariff protections.\n\nA succession of ship builders were also located at Bathurst Street Wharf, starting with John Doty Engine Works (1875–1892). The yard was purchased by Bertram Engine Works (1893–1905), then by Canadian Shipbuilding Company (1905–1907); and then by Toronto Shipyards (1908–1910). The idled yard was later taken over by Thor Iron Works (1913–1917), which constructed two minesweepers for the Royal Navy and four cargo vessels before selling the yard to Dominion Shipbuilding. Dominion then built a new facility on reclaimed land leased from the Toronto Harbour Commission and constructed twelve merchant ships during and immediately following the war (1917–1921) before ceasing operations. The once again idle ship yard was reactivated during World War II by the Canadian Government to construct \"Bangor\" and s (1941–1945), with the yard operated by a succession of companies, starting with Dufferin Shipbuilding Company Limited, then government-owned Toronto Shipbuilding Company Limited, and finally Redfern Construction Company Limited. At the end of the war the yard was closed for good.\n\nA number of other small builders dotted the waterfront east and west of Toronto proper:\n\nThe Rouge River's ship building was linked to the prolific lumber industry. The shipbuilding industry ranged between 1810 and 1856.\n\nMost of the ships were used for passenger and to carry potash, grain and lumber between Oswego, New York and Toronto, then called York.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2041378", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2041378", "title": "Alamo Placita, Denver", "text": "Alamo Placita, Denver\n\nAlamo Placita is a historic district and unofficial neighborhood of Denver, Colorado, United States. It is named after Alamo Placita Park which is located on the north side of Speer Boulevard between Ogden and Emerson Streets. \n\nThe district is bounded by Downing Street (east), Speer Boulevard (south), Pennsylvania Street (west), 6th Avenue (north) west of Clarkson Street and 7th Avenue (north) east of Clarkson Street. Alamo Placita is part of a larger official neighborhood called Speer.\n\nThe history of the Alamo Placita Historic District tells the story of 1860s prairie land along Cherry Creek just three miles (5 km) southeast of the new town of Denver. Farsighted investor Moses Hallett, an attorney from Illinois, bought the land in 1864. Hallett’s quarter section of land became Arlington Park Addition, and later, Alamo Placita neighborhood. By 1887, Denver’s southern city limit was the northern border of Hallett’s claim (now East 6th Avenue). A road on the eastern edge of Hallett’s land, called Hallett Road, is now Downing Street. In 1889, Hallett sold his land to the Arlington Park Land and Improvement Company and became one of several investors in the company.\n\nRobert W. Speer came to the West in 1878 seeking a cure for his tuberculosis. He recovered and exhibited boundless energy that defied any earlier malaise. Speer is remembered for becoming Denver’s first mayor under home rule in 1904, his three terms as mayor, his exuberance for Denver’s City Beautiful Movement, his support for the Denver park system, his boss-style politics, and his personal gains from real estate investments. Much less well known were Speer’s important connections with the Alamo Placita neighborhood.\n\nThose connections included, first, the fact that Alamo Placita neighborhood was Speer’s first major real estate investment. He formed a syndicate to develop the land. When Arlington Park Addition was created, it became the first client for Speer’s newly formed real estate company. Second, Speer’s creation of an addition and then an amusement park provided him with experience as the central figure in pulling big plans together with powerful Denver men. Third, the neighborhood was his home. Robert and Kate Speer built their residence at 505 Clarkson Street (now demolished) in 1890, and they lived there until 1906.\n\nThe grand opening for Arlington Park was held on the Fourth of July 1892. An extravagant theatrical production, “The Last Days of\nPompeii,” was the main attraction, involving 300 actors and a 54-foothigh set of Mt. Vesuvius. When Mt. Vesuvius erupted, a large\nfireworks display accompanied the eruption. In true Speer style, the grandeur was heavily promoted and an estimated 12,000 people\nattended.\n\nThe future of Arlington Park looked bright, and surely more events were anticipated. Anticipation disappeared when the 1893 Silver Crash brought the economy to a standstill. In 1898, Arlington Park reopened under the name Chutes Park. The new feature was “the chutes,” a graded waterfall that took riders in boats down into the lake at the bottom.\n\nTwo new attractions in May 1899 lured fun seekers. Miss Sadie Boynton, recently of Paris, France, would thrill all by “shooting\nthe chutes” on a bicycle. Also, “Professor Barnes’ muchheralded herd of driving and diving elks” would march up a ramp and plunge, one at a time, off a -high platform into a tank of water. Handbills proclaimed the park “The Coney Island of the West.”\n\nFires in 1901 and 1902 closed the amusement park forever, pleasing nearby neighbors who found living near the facility\nquite trying.\n\nThe 1889 Arlington Park Addition was the first and largest subdivision platted on Moses Hallett’s land. Essentially, it included almost all of the land that was not part of the amusement park. The addition went from E. 6th Avenue to approximately one-half block south of E. 4th Avenue, and from Logan Street to the alley between Corona and Downing Streets.\n\nIn January 1890, R.W. Speer and Company began accepting deposits on the property. By the end of February, 319 lots had\nsold for $217,000. The Rocky Mountain News observed, “R.W. Speer’s smiling face is more smiling than ever.” Notable early\ninvestors were Colonel John Arkins, owner of the Rocky Mountain News; John Cochran, the city postmaster; and T.M. Patterson, the first Democratic congressman from the State of Colorado.\n\nThe vigorous rate of growth in the Arlington Park Addition stopped in 1893. Building permits were lost for the years 1893 to 1900, but evidence points to a gradual recovery in Arlington Park home building. The new homes tended to be more modest than grand, and the new residents tended to be less well-known citizens. The neighborhood was serving as an affordable destination for new renters and first-time home-owners— particularly first-and second-generation European immigrants. Two groups of immigrants were especially predominant in Arlington Park. Scandinavian immigrants, primarily Swedish, were to make Hallett’s land their home in their new country. And later, Greeks would follow the path of the Swedes.\n\nHalf of Colorado’s Swedes lived in the Denver area in 1890. At first the Swedish residents of Alamo Placita were primarily\ninvolved in the building trades, domestic service, and gardening, and quite a few Alamo Placita homes were constructed by Swedish craftsmen. Soon, however, the Swedish-Americans began to embrace a variety of occupations. By the early 1930s, Alamo Placita gained significant numbers of Greek-Americans. Most were moving from the environs of their church north of Capitol Hill at E. 37th Avenue and Lafayette Street, the location of the first Greek Orthodox Church in Denver.\n\nIn 1933, the Greek Orthodox Church moved to 574 Pennsylvania Street. A residence on the Pennsylvania Street site was demolished and the Greeks built a new Assumption Greek Orthodox Church. The church was designed with the traditional onion-shaped domes associated with Eastern Orthodoxy. The presence of this building brought a rich, new, visible ethnic identity to Alamo Placita. This church was the central Greek church of Colorado. In 1973, the church moved to a spectacular new Assumption Greek Orthodox Church on E. Alameda Avenue.\n\nWith the building boom of the post-World War II years taking newer populations to the city fringe or new suburban communities, most of the Alamo Placita neighborhood continued to draw those who needed more affordable housing. Some developers demolished a few early residences to build more lucrative, multifamily apartments. Most of these new apartments were built on a relatively small scale.\n\nAccording to Assessor records, by 1930 approximately 90 percent of the present Alamo Placita Historic District buildings were built; by 1940, 94 percent were built. These include single-family dwellings, multifamily dwellings, and the few commercial buildings in the district.\n\nNeighborhood development continued with change occurring at a very slow pace, reacting to the ups and downs of the economy. During the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, the value of the neighborhood as a family-oriented environment close to the heart of the city was quietly rediscovered by young professionals and others. Lawyers, doctors, teachers, and businesspeople were moving into Alamo Placita in greater numbers, joining trade craftsmen, clerks, salesmen, and others. An example of one such couple is Richard and Dottie Lamm, who lived at 531 Emerson Street in the 1960s, before Lamm became a three-term governor of Colorado. The rediscovery of the neighborhood included an appreciation and respect for its architecture. Growing numbers of residents became aware of\nthe neighborhood’s architectural integrity. Their interest led to a desire to protect their environment and learn more about\nneighborhood history. This in turn formed the foundation for the creation of Alamo Placita Neighbors Association.\n\nAlamo Placita Historic District has some homes built for some early prominent Denverites, but mainly recognizes the 1889 to\n1942 environment of middle-income building trades and professional people, along with early clerks, Tramway workers, railroad men, and the like. The first district residents expressed their aspirations for success in part through building their neighborhood in important architectural styles of the day. Investors who built single- and multifamily residences followed this lead. Together they created an environment of lower-scale dwellings with streetscapes that respected visually pleasing setbacks accommodating gardens, lawns, and sidewalks. The gentle intermingling of architectural styles, building materials, and individual decoration remains clearly apparent despite more recent setback violations where a few demolished original structures have been replaced. Though the scale of a few newer buildings is too large, only one of the newer noncontributing structures is in serious height violation at 12 stories.\n\nThe earliest district residences were designed in Victorian-era styles. After 1893, when the Victorian-era influence began to\nwane, much of the district remained undeveloped.\n\nAlamo Placita residents were quicker than wealthier citizens to embrace the Arts and Crafts Movement, interpreted mainly in\nAlamo Placita through Foursquares and Bungalows. Wealthier citizens tended to express their status through the Classical Revival-style architecture of their residences. Less wealthy citizens were more open to the perceived practicality of new\ndesigns. Over time, in tandem with the Arts and Crafts influence, came a sprinkling of the popular Tudor-style dwellings, Spanish Mission-style dwellings, and others that spoke to Denver’s tenuous southwestern U.S. identity. The physical context of the district includes the small commercial buildings that were built along district borders, E. 6th Avenue, Speer Boulevard, and Downing Street.\n\nIn 2000, the Denver Landmark Preservation Commission unanimously recommended designation of the Alamo Placita Historic District based on the significance of its history, architecture, and geography. The City Council agreed, unanimously voting to approve the designation on June 12, 2000.\n\nAlamo Placita Neighbors Association (APNA), APNA April 2009 Newsletter, Joe Halpern\n"}

It has hosted a number of prestigious golf tournaments including three U.S. Open Championships, one U.S. Women's Open, three U.S. Amateur Championships, one PGA Championship and the Ryder Cup.\n\nPinehurst consists of nine 18-hole golf courses, each named simply by a number, and a 9-hole par-3 course. Pinehurst No. 2 has consistently been ranked as one of the top courses in North Carolina and among the best in the United States. In addition to the golf courses Pinehurst has three hotels, as well as many villas, condos, restaurants and other leisure facilities.\n\nPinehurst was founded by Boston soda fountain magnate James Walker Tufts. He purchased for approximately $1.25 per acre in 1895, and opened the Holly Inn New Year's Eve of that year. The first golf course was laid out in 1897/98, and the first championship held at Pinehurst was the United North and South Amateur Championship of 1901. Pinehurst's best known course, \"Pinehurst No. 2,\" was completed in 1907 to designs by Donald Ross, who became associated with Pinehurst for nearly half a century. After Pinehurst No. 2 was opened in 1907, Donald Ross said that the course was, \"The fairest test of championship golf I have ever designed.\"\n\nFrom 1902 to 1951, Pinehurst was the home of the North and South Open, which was one of the most prestigious golf tournaments in the United States at that time. Pinehurst is still home to the annual North and South Amateur Golf Championships, a series of tournaments which includes a Men's Championship inaugurated in 1901 and the Women's Championship that began two years later.\nThe first PGA Tour major staged at Pinehurst was the PGA Championship in 1936, won by Denny Shute. In 1951, the resort hosted the Ryder Cup, and in 1991 and 1992 it was the venue for The Tour Championship.\n\nIn 1999, Pinehurst staged its second major, the U.S. Open, won by Payne Stewart at the No. 2 course. There is currently a statue behind the 18th hole at Pinehurst No. 2 showing Stewart's famous victory pose after making a putt on the 18th hole to defeat Phil Mickelson.The U.S. Open returned in 2005, won by New Zealand's Michael Campbell. In 2011, Pinehurst No. 2 completed a $2.5 million, year-long renovation led by Bill Coore and Ben Crenshaw. The goal was to revert the course back to the original Donald Ross design.\n\nIn an unprecedented move, the USGA brought both the men's U.S. Open and the U.S. Women's Open to Pinehurst No. 2 in 2014. The U.S. Open was scheduled at its normal time, ending on the third Sunday in June (Father's Day), and the women played the following week.\n\nThe resort now has nine golf courses, three hotels, a spa and extensive sports and leisure facilities. It was ranked as the world's largest golf resort by the Guinness World Records before it was surpassed by Mission Hills Golf Club in China. The property’s old-growth longleaf pine trees are home to the federally endangered Red-cockaded Woodpecker.\n\nThe No. 2 course is included in the Links and the Tiger Woods PGA Tour video game series; the No. 8 course is also available for the Links game. Both Pinehurst No. 2 and Pinehurst No. 8 are available to play on E6 software.\n\nPinehurst was owned by the Tufts family until 1970, when it was sold to Malcom McLean. After the property was acquired by a set of banks in 1982, it was sold to Robert H. Dedman, Sr., founder of ClubCorp. When the Dedman family sold ClubCorp, they retained Pinehurst.\n\nIn June 1999, National Public Radio reported that the Pinehurst Resort was using threats of trademark infringement lawsuits to prevent any businesses located in the area of Pinehurst village from using the term \"Pinehurst\" in their business names.\n\n\nPinehurst Resort operates nine golf courses; the best known Course No. 2, opened in 1907. Designed by Donald Ross, it has hosted several major tournaments. Several notable golf course architects have designed courses for the resort. These architects include Donald Ross, Ellis Maples, Tom Fazio, Jack Nicklaus, and Gil Hanse. Houses border most of the courses but only one course was created specifically as a housing development: Pinehurst #7.\n\nThe first nine of what would become Pinehurst No. 1 was designed by Leroy Culver in 1897 and the second nine by John Dunn Tucker in 1898. Donald Ross however came in 1901 to tie it all together into a full 18-hole course, beginning a long career at what would become Pinehurst Resort. While there have been many changes to No. 1 over the years, many to accommodate the construction and renovation of the other courses, the original design is still there. The course is currently grassed with Certified Tifway 419 Bermuda tees, fairways, and rough and Mini Verde ultradwarf greens.\n\nPinehurst No. 2, the most famous course at Pinehurst Resort was first opened in 1907 and designed by Donald Ross. Pinehurst is considered to be Ross' best work and he continued to perfect it until his death in 1948. The course is famous for its exceptionally difficult green complexes which were a signature of Ross designs and many of the greens are crowned causing shots that are just short of perfect to many times roll back off the green leaving a difficult chip shot. Johnny Miller once famously compared trying to land a shot on a Pinehurst green as \"like trying to hit a ball on top of a VW Beetle. Pinehurst like many Sandhills courses was without long rough for much of its early history but in 1974 a redesign by RT Jones led to the installation of thick bermuda rough throughout the course which lasted until a restoration in 2010 by Bill Coore and Ben Crenshaw removed all of the rough a reshaped the fairways and bunkers to restore the course to its original Ross design. In lieu of rough golfers will now find hard-pan sand and native scrub bordering the fairways. The course since its inception has been host to many significant tournaments including 4 men's majors (1936 PGA Championship, and 1999, 2005, 2014 US Opens) with another US Open scheduled in 2024. It also hosted the 1951 Ryder Cup and the 2014 Women's US Open played the week after the men's. Not only has the course hosted numerous professional events, but its has also hosted the men's US Amateur 3 times in 1962, 2008, and 2019. The course is currently grassed with Tifway Bermuda tees and fairways and Champion Ultradwarf greens. Golf Digest ranks No. 2 as the 29th best golf course in the United States and the 6th best public course in the country. North Carolina Golf Panel has consistently ranked it as the best course in the state, both public and private.\n\nPinehurst No. 3, which is by far the shortest 18-hole course at the Resort, was designed by Donald Ross in 1910. The course is known for its very small greens placing a premium on accuracy and ball position, a hallmark of Ross courses. No. 3 underwent minor renovations in 2017 to make room for the new short course \"The Cradle,\" these renovations led by Kye Goalby lowered the par to 68 from 70 and shortened the length of the course. The course is currently grassed with Certified Tifway 419 Bermuda tees, fairways, and rough and Champion Ultradwarf greens.\n\nPinehurst No. 4, debatable as the second best course at the Resort was originally laid out by Donald Ross in 1919 but has undergone many significant changes in the years since, so significant that Ross is not credited by the Resort as the course's architect. The course was redesigned in 1973 by Robert Trent Jones, in 1982 by Rees Jones and in 1999 by Tom Fazio. Most recently the course reopened in 2018 after a major redesign by Gil Hanse which saw the course stripped of its rough much like No. 2 replacing it instead with native sandscapes. Also removed by Hanse were Fazio's numerous pot bunkers which some considered to be out of place at Pinehurst. No. 4 assisted its sister course No. 2 during the 2008 and 2019 US Amateurs by hosting several rounds in addition to those played on No. 2.\n\nPinehurst No. 5, which opened in 1961 was designed by Ellis Maples, an understudy of Donald Ross and one of the leading figures in North Carolina golf course architecture. The course differs from the four courses that predate it in that it takes on a more classic parkland style than the traditional rugged courses the Sandhills region is known for. The course is currently grassed with Certified Tifway 419 Bermuda tees, fairways, and rough and Champion Ultradwarf greens. \n\nPinehurst No. 6, designed by George Fazio and his nephew Tom Fazio, opened in 1979 and much like No. 5 before it, deviated from the earlier courses in that it took on a more typical parkland style with numerous lakes and more traditional bunker shapes. Aditionally No. 6 was different from the five before it in that it was the first course at the Resort to not play out of the main clubhouse. With the Resort out of room for a new course on the same site as the five other, No. 6 was built several miles away. Tom Fazio made some minor renovations in 2005, including the addition of new bunkers and installing faster greens. The course is currently grassed with Certified Tifway 419 Bermuda tees, fairways, and rough and Champion Ultradwarf greens.\n\nPinehurst No. 7 which opened in 1986 was designed by Rees Jones. This course, which was built on the site of a forgotten 9-hole employee course designed by Donald Ross, was the second at the Resort to play from a clubhouse other than the main one, even though No. 7 backs up to several holes on No. 2. The course features some of the most uneven topography of any course at the Resort and is as such a unique experience. Tiger Woods won the Big I Junior Classic in 1992 on No. 7. In 2002 the course underwent minor renovations by its original designer Rees Jones to keep it modern and in premium shape. The course is currently grassed with Certified Tifway 419 Bermuda tees, fairways, and rough and Champion Bermuda greens.\n\nPinehurst No. 8, No. 4's contender for second best at the Resort, was designed by Tom Fazio and opened in 1996 to commemorate the 100th anniversary of Pinehurst. The course is a classic Fazio design which puts a premium on playability with a nod to the tradition of Ross' signatures including many difficult green complexes. The course has the least amount of housing bordering it of any course at the Resort and as such is a more tranquil round, winding through wetlands and forests, earning it a Signature Sanctuary designation from the Audubon Society in 1996. No. 8 has played host to the PGA Club Pro Championship twice and hosted the 2017 US Amateur Four Ball with No. 2. The course is currently grassed with Certified Tifway 419 Bermuda tees, fairways, and rough and Champion Ultradwarf greens. Golf Digest ranks No. 8 as the 64th best public course in the United States.\n\nPinehurst No. 9 which opened in 1988 and was designed by Jack Nicklaus was originally a private club known as \"National Golf Club\" separate from the Resort but was purchased by Pinehurst in 2014 and became No. 9, available just like all the other courses to Resort guests. The course is a true Nicklaus original with all the hallmarks, including lush playing conditions and tricky greens. As with the others newer than No. 5, No. 9 plays out of its own clubhouse but is not far from the main resort, sitting just across the road from No. 7. The course underwent minor renovations in 2012 to keep it up to date and the course is currently grassed with Certified Tifway 419 Bermuda tees, fairways, and rough and Penn A-1/A-4 creeping bentgrass greens, the only course at the resort with bentgrass greens.\n\nPinehurst's newest and shortest course opened in 2017 and was designed by Gil Hanse. The Cradle is a 9 hole par 3 course with greens as tricky as any on the bigger courses, and at $50 with free replays is the cheapest way to play golf at Pinehurst. The course is currently grassed with Tifway Bermuda tees and fairways and Champion Bermuda greens.\n\nPinehurst is also the home of three championship croquet courts and a lawn bowling court. Players from around the country are attracted to this resort to play six wicket championship croquet. Mack Penwell is a US national champion, member of the United States Croquet Association hall of fame and, now retired, croquet professional at Pinehurst resort. Ron Lloyd took over as the croquet professional in 2004.\n\nIn May 2015 Pinehurst hosted the Solomon Trophy, the international match between teams representing the USA and Great Britain.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2041384", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2041384", "title": "The Ambassadors (Holbein)", "text": "The Ambassadors (Holbein)\n\nThe Ambassadors (1533) is a painting by Hans Holbein the Younger. Also known as \"Jean de Dinteville and Georges de Selve\", it was created in the Tudor period, in the same year Elizabeth I was born. As well as being a double portrait, the painting contains a still life of several meticulously rendered objects, the meaning of which is the cause of much debate. It also incorporates a much-cited example of anamorphosis in painting. It is part of the collection at the National Gallery in London.\n\nAlthough a German-born artist who spent most of his time in England, Holbein displayed the influence of Early Dutch painters in this work. This influence can be noted most outwardly in the use of oil paint, the use of which for panel paintings had been developed a century before in Early Netherlandish painting. What is most \"Flemish\" of Holbein's use of oils is his use of the medium to render meticulous details that are mainly symbolic: as Jan van Eyck and the Master of Flémalle used extensive imagery to link their subjects to divinity, Holbein used symbols to link his figures to show the same things on the table.\nAmong the clues to the figures' associations are a selection of scientific instruments including two globes (one terrestrial and one celestial), a shepherd's dial, a quadrant, a torquetum, and a polyhedral sundial, as well as various textiles including the floor mosaic, based on a design from Westminster Abbey (the Cosmati pavement, before the High Altar), and the carpet on the upper shelf, which is most notably oriental, an example of Oriental carpets in Renaissance painting. The choice for the inclusion of the two figures can be seen as symbolic. The figure on the left is in secular attire while the figure on the right is dressed in clerical clothes. They flank the table, which displays open books and symbols of religious knowledge, including a symbolic link to the Virgin.\nIn contrast, other scholars have suggested the painting contains overtones of religious strife. The conflicts between secular and religious authorities are here represented by Jean de Dinteville, a landowner, and Georges de Selve, the Bishop of Lavaur. The commonly accepted symbol of discord, a lute with a broken string, is included next to a hymnbook in Martin Luther's translation, suggesting strife between scholars and the clergy. For others, if the lute's broken string suggests the interruption of religious harmony, the Lutheran hymnal, open on facing pages reproducing a song on the Commandments (Law) and one on the Holy Spirit (Grace) may suggest their being in \"harmony\" with each other.\n\nThe terrestrial globe on the lower shelf repeats a portion of a cartographically imaginative map created in possibly 1530 and of unknown origin. The map is referred to as the Ambassadors' Globe due to its popularly known appearance in the painting.\n\nThe work has been described as \"one of the most staggeringly impressive portraits in Renaissance art.\"\n\nThe most notable and famous of Holbein's symbols in the work is the distorted skull which is placed in the bottom center of the composition. The skull, rendered in anamorphic perspective, another invention of the Early Renaissance, is meant to be a visual puzzle as the viewer must approach the painting from high on the right side, or low on the left side, to see the form as an accurate rendering of a human skull. While the skull is evidently intended as a \"vanitas\" or \"memento mori\", it is unclear why Holbein gave it such prominence in this painting. One possibility is that this painting represents three levels: the heavens (as portrayed by the astrolabe and other objects on the upper shelf), the living world (as evidenced by books and a musical instrument on the lower shelf), and death (signified by the skull). It has also been hypothesized that the painting is meant to hang in a stairwell, so that persons walking up the stairs and passing the painting on their left would be startled by the appearance of the skull. A further possibility is that Holbein simply wished to show off his ability with the technique in order to secure future commissions. Artists often incorporated skulls as a reminder of mortality. Holbein may have intended the skulls (one as a gray slash and the other as a medallion on Jean de Dinteville's hat) and the crucifix in the upper left corner to encourage contemplation of one's impending death and the resurrection.\n\nBefore the publication of Mary F. S. Hervey's \"Holbein's Ambassadors: The Picture and the Men\" in 1900, the identity of the two figures in the picture had long been a subject of intense debate. In 1890, Sidney Colvin was the first to propose the figure on the left as Jean de Dinteville, Seigneur of Polisy (1504–1555), French ambassador to the court of Henry VIII for most of 1533. Shortly afterwards, the cleaning of the picture revealed that his seat of Polisy is one of only four French places marked on the globe. Hervey identified the man on the right as Georges de Selve (1508/09–1541), Bishop of Lavaur, after tracing the painting's history back to a seventeenth-century manuscript. According to art historian John Rowlands, de Selve is not wearing episcopal robes because he was not consecrated until 1534. De Selve is known from two of de Dinteville's letters to his brother François de Dinteville, Bishop of Auxerre, to have visited London in the spring of 1533. On 23 May, Jean de Dinteville wrote: \"Monsieur de Lavaur did me the honour of coming to see me, which was no small pleasure to me. There is no need for the \"grand maître\" to hear anything of it\". The \"grand maître\" in question was Anne de Montmorency, the Marshal of France, a reference that has led some analysts to conclude that de Selve's mission was a secret one; but there is no other evidence to corroborate the theory. On June 4, the ambassador wrote to his brother again, saying: \"Monsieur de Lavaur came to see me, but has gone away again\".\nHervey's identification of the sitters has remained the standard one, affirmed in extended studies of the painting by Foister, Roy, and Wyld (1997), Zwingenberger (1999), and North (2004), who concludes that \"the general coherence of the evidence assembled by Hervey is very satisfying\"; however, North also notes that, despite Hervey's research, \"[R]ival speculation did not stop at once and is still not entirely dead\". Giles Hudson, for example, has argued that the man on the right is not de Selve, but Jean's brother François, Bishop of Auxerre, a noted patron of the arts with a known interest in mathematical instruments. The identification finds support in the earliest manuscript in which the painting is mentioned, a 1589 inventory of the Chateau of Polisy, discovered by Riccardo Famiglietti. However, scholars have argued that this identification of 1589 was incorrect. John North, for example, remarks that \"[T]his was a natural enough supposition to be made by a person with limited local knowledge, since the two brothers lived on the family estates together at the end of their lives, but it is almost certainly mistaken\". He points to a letter François de Dinteville wrote to Jean on 28 March 1533, in which he talks of an imminent meeting with the Pope and makes no mention of visiting London. Unlike the man on the right of the picture, François was older than Jean de Dinteville. The inscription on the man on the right's book is \"AETAT/IS SV Æ 25\" (his age is 25); that on de Dinteville's dagger is \"AET. SV Æ/ 29\" (he is 29).\n\nNorth's book analyzes the painting and shows it to be representing Good Friday through various clues on the instruments.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2041396", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2041396", "title": "Toronto Ferry Company", "text": "Toronto Ferry Company\n\nThe Toronto Ferry Company was formed from the merger of the \"Doty Ferry Company\" with \"A.J. Tymon's Island Ferry Company\", two of Toronto's early ferry operators to Toronto Islands in 1890. TFC was founded and headed by businessman Lol Solman. The company's ferry license and ships were later acquired by the Toronto Transportation Commission in 1927.\n\nCaptain Andrew J. Tymon (1844-?) operated a number ferries from 1880 until the formation of his own service in the mid-1880s. It later merged with John Doty's (1822-1902) Ferry Company to form TFC in 1892.\n\nVessels included:\n\n\nHis son Joseph Tymon (b. 1873) would become a ferry captain for the Toronto Ferry Company.\n\nJohn Doty was a Toronto industrialist born in Lewiston, New York in 1822. He moved his young family to Oakville, Ontario in 1851 where he established the town's first foundry and machine shop. By 1875, he, his wife Louisa Jane and two sons, Fred and Frank, moved to Toronto where John established a machine shop at the Yonge Street Wharf, 2 The Esplanade, with offices nearby at 2 Church Street.\n\nIn summer 1886 the Doty Brothers operated a ferry to Hanlan's Point. They also used the \"palace steamers\" Queen City and Canadian to service High Park and the Humber from York and Brock St wharves.\n\nWhen the business outgrew the capacity of the premises at the Yonge Street Wharf, John Doty leased \"about an acre of ground, with some buildings thereon, at the foot of Bathurst Street on the west side, and removed his works to that place in 1881.\" This was the former site of Dickey, Neill & Company's Soho Foundry.\n\nIn addition, The John Doty Engine Works operated a shipyard on the waterfront and established The Doty Ferry Company in 1887 with the purchase of vessels belonging to the Turner Ferry Company to provide a ferry service to the Toronto Island. In 1890, they built sister ships the \"Mayflower\" (a nod to the fact that John was a seventh generation descendant of Edward Doty who came over on the \"Mayflower\" in 1620) and the \"Primrose\". The two sisters cost $33,000 each to construct and incorporated the latest conveniences and improvements, including electric lights. \n\nIn 1888, the Dotys were forced to find a new location for their business when the owner of the property wanted to take over the site. \"In 1889, they purchased land on the east side of Bathurst Street between Niagara and Front where they constructed a state-of-the-art plant tailored to their manufacturing needs and purchased a considerable amount of new equipment. The plant started operations in 1891 and was the largest works of its kind in Canada, specializing in the design and manufacturing of marine engines, boilers, and complete vessels, with offices and supply depots at Winnipeg and Vancouver. Doty equipment was very extensively used in the development of the Canadian North West.\"\n\nCoinciding with the move to the new plant in 1890, was the sale of the Doty Ferry Company to the Toronto Ferry Company, which was incorporated as a joint stock company with financier E.B. Osler as president and Lawrence Soloman as general manager. \n\nJohn Doty became a shareholder, and the vessels belonging to the Doty Ferry Company were purchased as part of the venture. The Island Park Ferry Company and most of the other vessels in the city's ferry boat business were also acquired, giving the Toronto Ferry Company a virtual monopoly on hauling the public to and from the Island. It was reported that \"six of the ferries were built by The John Doty Engine Works.\"\n\nThat same year, The John Doty Engine Company of Toronto (Limited) was organized. The company's officers were: John Doty, President; Daniel Hunter, Vice-President; Franklin H. Doty, General Manager; Frederic W. Doty, Secretary-Treasurer; John Walsh, Assistant Secretary-Treasurer. The following year, at the age of 70, John Doty retired from his business.\n\nThen, on the cusp of achieving so much, there was a downturn in the market. \"The compulsory move of the plant in 1891 caused a substantial strain on the company's capital and credit. The financial panic of 1892 caused the Company to go into receivership. It was taken over by the Bertram interests.\"\n\nThe family was forced to sell the John Doty Engine Works to their creditors, Bertram & Co. An announcement in the Globe stated that Bertram would carry on business under the good name of the \"Doty Engine Works.\" The facility operated until 1905 under George and John Bertram as the Bertram Engine Works.\n\nJohn's sons, Fred and Frank stayed on as managers for a time. This was when they built their hydraulic sand pump, a piece of equipment they would later use under contract to the City for the dredging of the Toronto Harbour.\n\nIn 1901, at the age of 79, John Doty was living with his son Fred and family in Goderich, Ontario, where Fred had established the Doty Engine Works of Goderich. Soon after, he moved back to Toronto, boarding at the home of Robert Thomas, an engineer living at 97 Ossington Avenue and employed at the Bertram Engine Works, the new owners of the factory built by John Doty. This would be his last place of residence. On 1 October 1902, at the age of eighty, he died \"of the ill health incident to his advanced years.\"\n\nA list of engines built by John Doty:\n\n\n\nA list of ships operated by the Toronto Ferry Company:\n\n\n"}

The story then fast-forwards 15 years showing a now-adult Cal Johnston with some of his fellow inmates escaping the prison space station, where the core gameplay begins.\n\nUpon returning to his grandmother's base, Cal begins to set up his own piracy organization. Other groups in Hoffer's Wake begin to notice his work, and as he advances in fame and fortune he learns more about the current situation affecting the Badlands. For a long time, a group called the Marauders have been attacking at random—essentially terrorizing the people of the Cluster. Despite numerous attempts to run them down, the Badlands government and gangs have had no luck in stopping the attacks: the Marauders don't seem weakened even by major losses, and they don't seem to have any single base of operations.\n\nThe player is soon given access to other systems in the Cluster, with the assignment to find help fighting the Marauders in Hoffer's Wake. Most are only too happy to lend ships, supplies, and personnel once their own Marauder problems are taken care of, and the Marauders are successfully driven from Hoffer's Wake before long. However even that loss didn't slow them down, and further investigation on Cal's part reveals that they have been maintaining their primary base in the Dante system, long abandoned and thought uninhabitable after the unstable binary star flooded the system with radiation and cut it off from outside travel. The Rebel Fleet, now very large and well-organized, mounts a successful assault—only to be nearly destroyed anyway when the Marauders receive help from the Maas Corporation, who started the Marauders to \"keep you peasants in line.\"\n\nThe Rebels can't hope to directly match Maas's forces, so they fall back and try to think of alternative strategies. They conclude that the most effective action would be to find help outside of the Badlands, so they attack and secure the Santa Romera Jump Accelerator, a highly advanced piece of technology that allows travel over significantly longer distances than even Lagrange points. Cal arrives in the Fomalhaut system in the Gagarin Cluster to find much the same situation as in the Badlands: oppressive corporate rule, roving Marauders, and a desperate need for assistance.\n\nAfter working for a while, Cal receives a seemingly innocuous mission in which he is sent to spy on a number of corporate cruisers in the Gagarin Cluster. The story takes a sharp turn when, against Caleb Maas's wishes, corporate scientists activate an alien artifact that Cal himself stole for them, thinking to use it as some sort of weapon. The device goes out of control and begins to emit glowing red alien ships that eat (and thus destroy) any advanced power sources (such as ships) in their path; within days, the entire Gagarin Cluster is overrun. Cal and the fleet hold the aliens back from the Fomalhaut Jump Accelerator as refugees escape, then dash through at the last second and destroy the Accelerator, effectively isolating the Badlands indefinitely from the rest of human civilization. Cal remarks that they are safe from the aliens, but he's not sure about human civilization elsewhere.\n\nThe gameplay is a mix of free movement in space and missions. In free play, Cal can act independently, move throughout the Hoffer's Wake system and eventually the entire Badlands Cluster, and steal cargo. Game missions allow the player to gain new weapons and ships, and contribute to the rebellions against the corporations that control the Badlands.\n\nThe game may only be saved when a player returns to their 'base'. While docked here, in addition to saving, the player can also elect to change their current ship type or equipment loadout; check their inventory of current equipment and cargo; trade stolen cargo for new equipment on the black market; and manufacture various types of munitions from recycled scrap. A final and highly important function of the base is to allow access to the player's email file, which is the main process to learn about new missions and plot developments.\n\nWhen the game first starts, the player as the younger Cal is flying a Command Section or ComSec, a detachable mini-ship that is intended to be part of a larger vehicle and has minimal capabilities of its own. After the player docks at their base for the first time, they will gain access to the \"Storm Petrel\", a lightly armed but very fast fighter craft which is easy to fly for new pilots. After crossing Caleb Maas and being sent to prison, the \"Petrel\" is lost, and the player now flies a \"Spider\"-class tug. Later in the campaign, the player will also be given access to the \"Tachyon\"-class patrol-combatant (PatCom) and the \"Devastator\"-class heavy corvette. These craft only become available after key, difficult missions and are much more powerful and capable than the tug ship.\n\nThere are a wide variety of upgrades available to the player. Some few are given in the form of stolen cargo pods or through mission rewards: most are gained on the black market through the base's trading interface. Upgrades can either add new features to the ship (like installing the Imaging Module, which lets the player zoom in their view dramatically), others simply improve the ship's performance (such as installed cold gas thrusters, which are not quite as powerful as standard thrusters but much more stealthy in use). Once gained, upgrades are permanently available to the player, though may be moved between ships as desired.\n\nWeaponry in \"Edge of Chaos\" is modular. Each ship has some number of hardpoints available, and the player is left with the option of how to arm the ship from the available weapons in their inventory. Weapons are divided into three categories:\n\n\nThe Heads-Up Display in the game includes several features iconic to the Independence War franchise, including:\n\n\nBecause it is a partially freeform game modeling an entire star cluster at plausible scales, players of \"Edge of Chaos\" will often find it necessary to transit considerable distances. There are three forms of travel in \"EoC\":\n\n\nThe game's autopilot system can be used most of the time to eliminate the tedium of travel. However it is completely possible (and in some situations, necessary) to choose one's own capsule jump destination or to manually operate the LDS drive.\n\nThe game adheres well to the laws of Newtonian physics, realistically approximating the actual behavior of spacecraft; ships have inertia and take time to change speed and direction. The player's vessel is equipped with lateral thrusters that allow it to change facing while moving (e.g. face 'backward' while flying 'forward').\n\nThis has immediate effects on the game; for example, combat is often won based on how well the respective pilots can use their ship's inertia to best advantage, rather than who has the best weaponry.\n\nThe physical simulation applies to even weapon shots and missiles, which inherit their initial speed from the ship that created them: flying left and firing will create a bolt that goes straight from the firer's perspective, but to outside observers would seem to travel partially sideways. This behaviour makes it challenging to use weapons without the automatic computer-assisted weapon tracking behaviour.\n\nThe technological improvements over the first game included support for Direct3D compatible hardware accelerated 3D graphics, network multiplay and a new user interface. \"Edge of Chaos\" gave a nod to \"Elite\" style gameplay by adding free roaming piracy to the \"Independence War\" games' universe. The familiar Newtonian mechanics obeying flight model with a flight computer assistance was retained, although combat was somewhat simplified and made more accessible to the player.\n\n\"Edge of Chaos\" was initially developed for both Windows based PCs, PlayStation, Nintendo 64 & Dreamcast, but the PlayStation, Nintendo 64 & Dreamcast version was cancelled. The dual platform development affected some design decisions. Most of the ship's function interface was made navigable through a joystick hat control, but on the negative side, partly due to being designed for a game console without a hard disk, game progress could only be saved between missions, in the home base.\n\nA browser-based game, \"Edge of Chaos Online\", was created as part of the marketing campaign in late 2001.\n\nOn July 6, 2010, GOG.com re-released the game digitally.\n\nThe game has extensive modding support. Mods can introduce new gameplay elements, models and textures, interface enhancements and can bring modifications to existing elements of the game such as ships, NPC interactions and quests. The game's powerful modding capabilities has attracted a large modding community, including mod releases by Particle Systems itself\n\nJohn Lee reviewed the PC version of the game for \"Next Generation\", rating it three stars out of five, and stated that \"Only a too-accurate space flight model mars this otherwise compelling space Western.\"\n\n\"Independence War 2\" was a nominee for \"Computer Gaming World\"s 2001 \"Best Simulation Game\" award, which ultimately went to \"IL-2 Sturmovik\".\n\nThe game was a critical, but not financial, success, contributing to the eventual acquisition of developers Particle Systems by Argonaut Games, which changed the team name to Argonaut Sheffield. \"Edge of Chaos\" was distributed by Infogrames Entertainment.\n\n"}

Built in 1916 by the Duluth and Iron Range Railroad, it provided passenger train service until 1951. It operates as the Tower-Soudan Historical Society Center museum.\n\nThe first railroad line to Tower was built by the Duluth and Iron Range Railroad (D&IR) and completed in 1884. The Soudan Mine had opened the previous year, necessitating the construction of a rail line to transport ore. The first railroad depot in Tower was then built sometime before 1886; while shown on maps as a passenger depot, it was effectively a freight depot.\n\nBeginning about 1908, D&IR began heavily promoting tourism in the Lake Vermilion area. The depot's freight-oriented design and poor location for travelers spurred the construction of a new passenger station, which was announced in February 1916. Residents of eastern Tower protested its planned western site in favor of a more central location, but the request was rejected. The passenger depot was designed by William H. Beyrer and built by contractor George Spurbeck at a cost of $10,000. Construction finished later in 1916 and the first train arrived the morning of November 25, 1916.\n\nIn the 1930s and 1940s, train travel began to decline in favor of the automobile. Increased automobile ownership and improved roads opened up tourism throughout the state, lessening the special position of Lake Vermillion. Automobile associations were also able to promote tourism more successfully than D&IR. Passenger service to the Tower depot discontinued in 1951 because of reduced ridership, and freight service to Tower ceased in 1962 with the closing of the Soudan Mine. D&IR donated the depot in 1966 to the City of Tower. It later opened as the Tower-Soudan Historical Society Center, a museum of local history. The station was nominated for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places under Criterion A for its significance in tourism and transportation; it was listed on June 14, 2013 as the Duluth and Iron Range Railroad Company Passenger Station.\n\nThe wood frame structure is one-and-a-half stories tall, occupying a footprint approximately oriented northwest to southeast. The exterior is covered in clapboard from the ground to about , above which is stucco. The asphalt roof is shallow, with a complex hipped design and a overhang. Structural fatigue has resulted in sagging of the eaves, prompting the addition of six posts for support at the edge of the roof.\n\nOn the northwest face is a sign that reads TOWER in block letters, affixed at the edge of the roof.\n\nTo the southwest along the loading platform is a remnant of railroad track. The track holds D&IR 218 (later DM&IR 1218), a K class 2-8-0 steam locomotive and its tender, two train cars, and a caboose. A canopy built in 2008 shelters the locomotive and the passenger car. The canopy was fitted with solar panels in 2012 to provide electricity to the railroad cars and depot. To the west of the locomotive, beyond the boundary of the depot site, is a 1901 monument to President William McKinley made of sheet metal.\n\n\n"}

Television was new in Japan, so many children who did not have a TV set were gathered around to watch it at a friend's or neighbor's house. Children also bought toy capes, sunglasses, masks and pistols, and played Moonlight Mask in schoolyards and backyards (but as with every children's superhero, Japanese or American, Moonlight Mask was not without liability casualties; see Liability issues and cancellation below).\n\nMoonlight Mask's identity has always been a mystery (which is why the Moonlight Mask persona is credited as being played by \"?\" in the original series).\n\nDecked out in white tights, a white & red cape, a white scarf, yellow gloves & boots, dark glasses, a cloth face mask and Indian-style turban (pinned with a \"moon\" ornament), Moonlight Mask is armed with a whip, two six-shooters, shuriken and moon-shaped boomerangs, and rides a motorcycle.\n\nHowever, only audiences know that Moonlight Mask could very well be detective , who seems to disappear from his friends just before the caped crusader rides to the rescue on his motorcycle! Even his comical assistant , his friend Inspector Matsuda, and children Shigeru, Kaboko and Fujiko are oblivious to Iwai's secret identity.\n\nThe original B&W Moonlight Mask (月光仮面) tokusatsu TV drama series, produced by the advertising agency Senkosha, was aired on KRTV (now TBS) from February 24, 1958 to July 5, 1959, with a total of 131 episodes, the series being divided into five story arcs (or chapters). Jūrō Iwai/Moonlight Mask was played by Ose Koichi.\n\n\nTo coincide with the Nippon Gendai/Senkosha TV series, Toei Films produced six Moonlight Mask theatrical movies screened in theaters from 1958 to 1959. This was Toei's first involvement in the tokusatsu superhero genre (although their first \"original\" superhero production was the TV series \"7-Color Mask\" in 1959). All six movies (which are in black-and-white, just like the TV series) are basically feature adaptations of the TV show's popular story arcs, and were filmed in \"ToeiScope\" (2.35:1). Three movies were released in 1958, and three in 1959. In these six movie versions, Jūrō Iwai/Moonlight Mask was played by Fumitake Omura.\n\n\nA few months after the show first aired, a manga (comic book) tie-in was commissioned. There were different artists drawing the manga, the majority of which was done by young artist Jiro Kuwata (who would later become the co-creator of \"8 Man\").\n\nChildren watching superhero shows sometimes attempted to imitate the hero's dangerous feats, and \"Moonlight Mask\" was no exception. Because a boy in Japan jumped to his death imitating Moonlight Mask's dangerous stunts, the show was unfortunately cancelled on July 5, 1959, following the ending of the final story arc, \"Don't Turn Your Hand to Revenge\". Toei's movies, however, continued to appear in theaters well into August 1959 (fortunately, this would not be the end of Moonlight Mask; he made a return to Japanese TV 13 years later).\n\nThe anime adaptation Seigi wo Ai Suru Mono - Gekkō Kamen (正義を愛する者 - 月光仮面), translated as \"The One Who Loves Justice: Moonlight Mask\", was produced by Knack, and aired on Nippon Television from January 10, 1972 to October 2, 1972, with a total of 39 episodes (divided into three story arcs or chapters). The show also became very popular in Latin America under the title \"\".\nJapanese voice actor Michihiro Ikemizu provided the voice of Jūrō Iwai/Moonlight Mask. The hero now wears an open face helmet instead of a turban, and his cape has an ornament with the scarf attached.\n\n\nThe tokusatsu movie Moonlight Mask (月光仮面), produced by Purumie International/Herald Enterprises and distributed by Nippon Herald Pictures, was released theatrically on March 14, 1981. Considered Japan's answer to the American box office fiasco, \"The Legend of the Lone Ranger\" (released the same year), this updated version of the Moonlight Mask legend also bombed at the Japanese box office. Daisuke Kuwahara (who, like Klinton Spilsbury, disappeared from doing films) played George Owara (Moonlight Mask's new alter-ego), and the rest of the cast made up of veteran action starlet Etsuko Shihomi, Daijiro Harada and Takayuki Godai, with none of the original characters turning up. The movie was directed and co-written by Yukihiro Sawada.\n\nThe gag-anime series We Know You, Moonlight Mask-kun! (ごぞんじ!月光仮面くん - \"Gozonji! Gekkô Kamen-kun\"), a very comical take on the famous masked hero, was produced by Tokyo Movie Shinsha, animated by Actas, and broadcast on TV Tokyo from October 3, 1999 to March 26, 2000, with a total of 25 episodes. The opening theme song is an updated version of the original theme song, and is sung by COA.\n\nControversial manga artist Go Nagai made a very raunchy parody of \"Moonlight Mask\", titled \"Kekkō Kamen\" (けっこう仮面 - \"Kekkō Kamen\", roughly translated as \"Splendid Mask\"), a pun on \"Gekkō Kamen\" (Moonlight Mask's Japanese name). The manga depicts the adventures of a young superheroine who wears a red mask, scarf, an occasional cape, gloves, boots and nothing else. She has various weapons like nunchaku and a feather on her mask.\n\nIn the anime \"Sailor Moon\", the character Mamoru Chiba appears in the \"Makaiju\" arc as the \"Moonlight Knight\" dressed in a white costume and turban similar to that of Moonlight Mask.\n\nIn the anime \"Sexy Commando Gaiden: Sugoiyo Masaru-san\", Yoroshiku Kamen and his various previous reincarnations (Bye-bye Kamen, Aisatsu Kamen, etc.) all parody Gekkou Kamen and his appeal to children.\n\nIn episode 42, \"Spectreman\" faces a mysterious new villain called Solar Mask, a reversed parody of Moonlight Mask whose looks greatly resemble the original hero.\n\nThe second entry of the Yo-Kai Watch video game series produced by Level-5 features an in-universe fictional character called \"Guts Kamen\", or \"Moximous Mask\" in the English translation, who is modeled after Showa period superheroes in general, and Moonlight Mask in particular.\n\n"}

Based in Queenstown, it is the main anti-rioting and disaster-management unit of the police force. They are also called upon to handle cases of serious crime in progress, particularly cases involving firearms. From 2004, PTU officers also presented greater public prominence when they conducted patrols in public areas, such as at Orchard Road, Holland Village and Serangoon Gardens Estate, partly as a response to greater terrorism concerns.\n\nThe PTU traces its history back to the early 1950s whereby the Maria Hertogh riots demonstrated the incapability of existing law enforcement measures in containing situations of mass rioting and other disturbances to public peace. Hence in 1952, the first Riot Squad was formed with 60 junior officers deliberately chosen from a wide range of ethnic backgrounds, and who have been screened to ensure no relations to any political party or faction. These officers underwent rigorous (military) training conducted by Colonel J.F. Fairbairn, who was formerly the Assistant Commissioner of the Shanghai Municipal Police Armed Reserve.\n\nThese officers formed the first riot control squad which became operational in December 1952 as the Reserve Unit (RU). Their responsibilities included crowd control, riot control, and provision of assistance during natural calamities such as fires and floods, thus three specially-trained squads were formed.\n\nIn 1953, the squad was reorganised into 3 troops of 50 men each, and renamed as the Police Reserve Unit (PRU), with PRU 1 stationed at Mount Vernon Camp, PRU 2 at Queensway Base and PRU 3 at Jalan Bahar Camp. The unit would later come to be known as the Police Task Force (PTF) following the merger of all three Reserved Units and permanently based at Queensway Base.\n\nIn response to an increasingly complicated and multi-faceted public safety and security requirements in contemporary environments, the PTF underwent another major review in 2003, this time with upgraded weaponry and vehicles, a change to their tactical uniforms in 2005, and the renaming of the unit as the Police Tactical Unit (PTU).\n\nWong Kan Seng, Deputy Prime Minister and Home Affairs Minister, oversaw the acquisition of the PETRA (Patrol, Escort, Tactical Response Van) vehicles alongside Police Tactical Squad (PTS) and Troop Tactical Vehicle (TTV) vans for the use of the PTU alongside the rest of the SOC in 2006 just in time for the IMF World Bank Summit in Singapore. The first two vans resemble Ford Transit Vans.\n\nThe unit is currently conducting counter-terrorist duties such as security duties in order to deter terrorist threats in Singapore alongside other police units.\n\nThe PTU also has a few sub-units; Armed Strike Teams and its National Servicemen unit called Public Order Troops that was formed on September 2018. The POT, once fully implemented in 2023, will work alongside its regular counterparts in major events such as riots, national emergencies, and public order incidents, as well as possible terrorist attacks.\n\n\nThe Police Tactical Unit officers have traditionally worn the Combat Dress, also known as the no. 4 police uniform. This consists of a blue beret, long-sleeved blue polyester shirt with concealed plastic buttons, black combat belt, blue combat trousers, and black combat boots. The sleeves may be folded up during the day, and rolled down at dusk or during tactical training and operations.\n\nIn 2005, the uniform underwent a major review, and a new tactical uniform was introduced. The red beret was introduced to facilitate ease of spotting PTU officers in the event of a major crowd control incident. The combat uniform was also redesigned to a more loose-fitting attire with utility pockets, and the material changed to a cotton-polyester mix which is more durable and fire resistant. The colour of the uniform is also changed to a darker shade of blue for tactical purposes. High-heel boots with garters were also introduced.\n\nThe PTU officers are equipped with a variegated arsenal of weapons, such as riot gears, pepper spray, batons, the Heckler & Koch HK69A1 tear gas launcher, the Heckler & Koch USP semi-auto pistol and the Heckler and Koch MP5 sub-machine gun.\n\n\n"}

The mission of the school is to prepare students for higher education and lifelong learning by inspiring intellectual, physical, social, emotional, artistic, and spiritual growth so that they may realize their power for good as citizens of local and world communities.\n\nThe Oregon Episcopal School (OES) was established in 1869 in Portland, Oregon, by the Rt. Rev. Benjamin Wistar Morris, Bishop of Oregon, and is \"the oldest Episcopal school west of the Rocky Mountains.\" Known as St. Helen's Hall at the time of its founding, it was originally a boarding and day school for girls.\n\nOES's original site at 4th and Madison is now the location of Portland's City Hall. The school moved several times during its first century to different locations in downtown Portland. It was located at 13th and Hall Streets before moving to its present location in the Raleigh Hills neighborhood of Portland in 1964. The Bishop Dagwell Hall was soon added, expanding the academic program to boys.\n\nIn 1972, St. Helen's Hall merged with Bishop Dagwell Hall to become Oregon Episcopal School. Currently, the school serves children from prekindergarten through 12th grade and includes day-school and boarding programs.\n\nA number of facilities have been added over the years. Meyer Hall was built in 1996 as a new facility for Middle School students; the Drinkward Center for Math, Science and Technology opened in 2003; and in 2016 a 45,000-square-foot Lower School facility opened for Pre-K through 5th grade students. Today, approximately 870 students in Pre-K through Grade 12 attend OES.\n\nThe Beginning, Lower, and Middle schools consist entirely of day students, but the Upper School includes a large boarding program. Approximately one-fifth of the Upper School's student body resides on campus, and around three-fourths of those boarding students hail from outside the United States.\n\nIn 2007, Portland Monthly magazine named the school one of the best in Oregon. In 2014, Oregon Episcopal School was ranked the best high school in the state of Oregon and the 13th best private school in the United States. OES ranked #2 on Oregon's 25 Best K-12 Schools for 2018, according to the \"Portland Business Journal\".]\n\nOES's research-based science program is one of the best in the United States and has a long history of success in science research competitions. Over the years, many students have placed highly in prestigious competitions such as the Intel Science Talent Search, the Siemens Competition, the Davidson Fellows Scholarship, the Google Science Fair, the Intel International Science and Engineering Fair, the Stockholm Junior Water Prize, the International Sustainable World Energy Engineering Environment Project Olympiad, the BioGENIOUS Competition, and the National Junior Science and Humanities Symposium. Since 1995, 19 students have been named Intel National Semifinalists and National Finalists with one senior National Finalist contestant placed 2nd nationally among 40 national finalists in 2003 and one senior National Finalist contestant placed 3rd nationally in 2004. Since 2002, 36 students have been named Siemens National Semifinalists, Regional Finalists and National Finalists. In 2010, Akash Krishnan and Matthew Fernandez placed 1st nationally in the team category and won the Siemens Competition. Also in 2013, Ajay Krishnan was named the recipient of a prestigious $10,000 Davidson Fellows Scholarship, the top honor in the engineering category. He was also named a regional finalist in the Google Science Fair.\n\nOES's 59-acre campus lies in the hills of Southwest Portland. Facilities include:\n\nOES's official mascot is an Aardvark, chosen by the student body to replace their previous mascot, a falcon. At one time an eagle was also a mascot at the school.\n\nIn 2013, the mascot placed second in the West in \"USA Today's\" High School Sports' Best Mascot competition.\n\n\nOne of the worst climbing accidents in U.S. history occurred in May 1986 when seven sophomore students and two faculty froze to death during an excursion on Mount Hood. Of the four survivors, three had life-threatening injuries; one had his legs amputated.\nThe school commemorates this event by engaging in a day of service for the Portland community in gratitude for their support. All students and faculty go out to help others in a variety of ways, from serving food to taking care of hiking trails. At Catlin Gabel, the school's rival, there is a memorial as well.\n\nThe OES disaster spurred the development of the Mountain Locator Unit, an inexpensive transmitter which helps searchers find climbers in distress.\n\n"}
{"id": "2041431", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2041431", "title": "Sharing", "text": "Sharing\n\nSharing is the joint use of a resource or space. It is also the process of dividing and distributing. In its narrow sense, it refers to joint or alternating use of inherently finite goods, such as a common pasture or a shared residence. Still more loosely, \"sharing\" can actually mean giving something as an outright gift: for example, to \"share\" one's food really means to give some of it as a gift. Sharing is a basic component of human interaction, and is responsible for strengthening social ties and ensuring a person’s well-being.\n\nApart from obvious instances, which we can observe in human activity, we can also find many examples of this happening in nature. When an organism takes in nutrition or oxygen for instance, its internal organs are designed to divide and distribute the energy taken in, to supply parts of its body that need it. Flowers divide and distribute their seeds. In a broader sense, it can also include free granting of use rights to goods that can be treated as nonrival goods, such as information. \n\nFile sharing is the practice of distributing or providing access to digitally stored information, such as computer programs, multi-media (audio, video), documents, or electronic books. It may be implemented through a variety of ways. Storage, transmission, and distribution models are common methods of file sharing incorporate manual sharing using removable media, centralized computer file server installations on computer networks, World Wide Web-based hyperlinked documents, and the use of distributed peer-to-peer networking (see peer-to-peer file sharing).\n\nSharing is a key feature in the developing field of free software and open source software, with implications for economics. This is leading to a need to review licensing, patents and copyright, and to controversy in these areas, as well as new approaches like Creative Commons and the GPL.\n\nFurthermore, sharing is a key feature of Internet culture in which images, videos, links, knowledge and other content are shared on Web 2.0-platforms such as reddit.\n\nIn computer science, the issue of handling shared resources figures prominently. For example, time-sharing is an approach to interactive computing in which a single computer is used to provide apparently simultaneous interactive general-purpose computing to multiple users by sharing processor time. Sharing of resources between processes and threads is the source of most of the difficulties of concurrent programming. The word \"sharing\" is also used in some functional programming communities to refer specifically to sharing of memory between different data items to save space, otherwise known as hash consing.\n\nResource sharing—called kaláka in Hungarian—is an old tradition in Hungary. Young couples had to build their house after marriage. Marriage itself was called házasodás in Hungarian (en: becoming the owner of a house). When doing so the whole community, relatives and acquaintances helped the young couple with work, knowledge and even money. At pigsticking, all members of the community got their shares too.

{"id": "2041434", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2041434", "title": "Stayin' Alive", "text": "Stayin' Alive\n\n\"Stayin' Alive\" is a song written and performed by the Bee Gees from the \"Saturday Night Fever\" motion picture soundtrack. The song was released on 13 December 1977 as the second single from the \"Saturday Night Fever\" soundtrack. The band co-produced the song with Albhy Galuten and Karl Richardson. It is one of the Bee Gees' signature songs. In 2004, \"Stayin' Alive\" was placed at number 189 on the list of Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. In 2004, it ranked No. 9 on AFI's 100 Years...100 Songs survey of top tunes in American cinema. In a UK television poll on ITV in December 2011 it was voted fifth in \"\"The Nation's Favourite Bee Gees Song\"\".\n\nOn its release, \"Stayin' Alive\" climbed the charts to hit the number one spot on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 the week of 4 February 1978, remaining there for four consecutive weeks. In the process, it became one of the band's most recognisable tunes, in part because of its place at the beginning of \"Saturday Night Fever\". In the United States, it would become the second of six consecutive number-one singles, tying the record with the Beatles for most consecutive number ones in the United States at the time (a record broken by Whitney Houston who achieved seven consecutive number-ones).\n\nThe executive producer of the \"Saturday Night Fever\" motion picture soundtrack and future Bee Gees manager Robert Stigwood asked the band to write a few songs for the soundtrack. At this point, the film was in early stages and it did not have a title; in fact, all Stigwood had to go on was a \"New York\" cover story about discomania. \n\nThey wrote \"Stayin' Alive\" over the course of a few days while sprawled on the staircase at the Château d'Hérouville studio near Paris. As with many other artists during the 1970s, the Bee Gees recorded a majority of the soundtrack in France for tax reasons.\n\nRSO Records wanted the song to share the then-title of the film, \"Saturday Night\", but the Bee Gees refused a title change, insisting that there had been too many songs with \"Saturday\" in the title, and the album already had a song with the word \"night\" in the title—\"Night Fever\". Rather than change the name of the former song to match the film, Stigwood expanded the name of the film to encompass the title of the latter song. Over the years, the brothers have had mixed feelings about the song. On one hand, they admit it brought them tremendous fame; on the other, it led to their being pigeonholed as a disco act, despite a long and varied career before and after.\n\nSeveral words from Robin Gibb's Concorde ticket inspired the Gibbs to write the lyrics for \"Stayin' Alive\". Robin recalls, \"The subject matter of 'Stayin' Alive' is actually quite a serious one; It's about survival in the streets of New York, and the lyrics actually say that\". Barry Gibb also recalls, \"People crying out for help. Desperate songs. Those are the ones that become giants. The minute you capture that on record, it's gold. 'Stayin' Alive' is the epitome of that. Everybody struggles against the world, fighting all the bullshit and things that can drag you down. And it really is a victory just to survive. But when you climb back on top and win bigger than ever before, well that's something everybody reacts to everybody\". \"We'd also written a song called 'Saturday Night'\", Maurice explains, \"But there were so many songs called 'Saturday Night' even one by the Bay City Rollers, so when we rewrote it for the movie, we called it 'Stayin' Alive'.\n\nThe track was finished at Criteria Studios, with Maurice Gibb laying down a bass line similar to the guitar riff, Barry Gibb and Alan Kendall on guitar riffs, and Blue Weaver adding synthesizers. The Boneroo Horns parts were added. Barry sings falsetto on the whole song, except on the line \"life’s going nowhere, somebody help me\". \n\nDue to the death of backing drummer Dennis Bryon's mother in the middle of the song's sessions, the group first looked for a replacement. The shortage of qualified drummers in the area prompted the group to try a drum machine, but it did not offer satisfactory results. After listening to the drum track of the already-recorded \"Night Fever\", the group and producer Albhy Galuten took two bars from that track, rerecorded them as a recurrent loop on a separate tape, and proceeded with sessions for \"Stayin' Alive\". This accounts for the unchanging rhythm throughout the song. As a joke, the group listed the drummer as \"Bernard Lupe\" (a takeoff on session drummer Bernard Purdie). Mr. Lupe became a highly sought-after drummer—until it was discovered that he did not exist.\n\nAlbhy Galuten talks about the recording of \"Stayin' Alive\":\n\nIn their work together, Gibb and Galuten had tried playing with a click track as Galuten explained:\n\nThe song was not initially scheduled for release, with \"How Deep Is Your Love\" selected as lead single, but fans called radio stations and RSO Records requesting the song immediately after seeing trailers for \"Saturday Night Fever\", featuring the track over the aforementioned introductory scene. The single was eventually released in mid-December, a month after the album, and moved to the top of the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 in the United States in February, where it would stay for four weeks. Soon after, it would slide to number two, locking in a solid one-two punch with the Bee Gees's third smash hit from the album, \"Night Fever\". In the United Kingdom, \"Stayin' Alive\" was not as popular as it was in the United States, but was still a huge hit, topping out at number four.\n\nFurther demonstrating the Bee Gees's US chart domination in 1978, \"Stayin' Alive\" was replaced at number one with the group's younger brother Andy Gibb's single, \"Love Is Thicker Than Water\", followed by the Bee Gees's \"Night Fever\" for their longest run, seven weeks. This was then replaced by Yvonne Elliman's \"If I Can't Have You\". Barry Gibb had a hand in writing all four of these songs, becoming the only person in history to write four successive US number-one singles. Besides the version that appeared on the soundtrack album and the edited 45RPM single for Top 40 radio release, there was yet another version, from the same recording session but of a slightly different mix, that was distributed on twelve-inch vinyl to club DJs and radio stations that specialised in airing longer versions of hit songs. This \"Special Disco Version\", as it was called, featured all the same parts as the album version but had a horn rhythm section part interjected twice. Although twelve-inch \"Disco Versions\" were usually sped up, this version was slowed down slightly. This version was finally released on CD when Reprise re-issued \"Bee Gees Greatest\" in 2007 in an expanded and remastered edition. As for the message of the song, Robin Gibb was quoted as saying, \"'Stayin' Alive' is about survival in the big city—any big city—but especially New York.\" The longest version of \"Stayin' Alive\" ever made was faded at 6:59, and that version was finally released on the remastered version of \"Bee Gees Greatest\". The album edit is a still generous 4:43, but it was down to 3:29 for the single version.\n\nInitial plans were for Yvonne Elliman, then known for ballads, to record \"How Deep Is Your Love\" for \"Saturday Night Fever\", while the Bee Gees produced their own version of the more disco-oriented \"If I Can't Have You\" for the film. Robert Stigwood thought he would prefer the songs from different genders and directed the group to cut the ballad, while Elliman cut \"If I Can't Have You\" with her usual producer Freddie Perren. Satisfied with this switch, Elliman's interpretation made the soundtrack, while the Bee Gees's version was relegated to the B-side of the \"Stayin' Alive\" single. The brothers' version has since appeared on CD in hits compilations.\n\nGeorge Martin commented about this song saying: \"The great thing about 'Stayin' Alive' is that it had a great guitar hook to start with which set up the theme, that pulsating beat. It's no coincidence, by the way, that the disco beat of 120 beats per minute coincides the heartbeat of your heart when you're excited. This was a key thing which underlined the whole tune, and when the vocals came in, the vocals were so designed that they pushed that beat further\".\n\nThe music video for the song is of an entirely different concept from \"Saturday Night Fever\". It was filmed on MGM Studios's backlot #2 in Culver City, California. The group was filming the movie, \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\" on the lot at the same time. The video featured Quality Street—a set that was used for such films as \"The Three Musketeers\" and \"Young Frankenstein\"—as well as the Grand Central Station set used in the films \"The Band Wagon\" and the opening of \"That's Entertainment!\" with Fred Astaire. As the group walks past one of the railway cars in the video, the words \"New York Central\" can be seen printed on the side of the train above a passenger window. The MGM art directors added this bit of authenticity because the actual New York Central Railroad operated several lines from Grand Central Terminal in New York City during the 20th century until 1969.\n\n\n\n\n\"Stayin' Alive\" was used in a study to train medical professionals to provide the correct number of chest compressions per minute while performing CPR. The song has close to 104 beats per minute, and 100–120 chest compressions per minute are recommended by the British Heart Foundation and endorsed by the Resuscitation Council (UK). A study on medical professionals found that the quality of CPR is better when thinking about \"Stayin' Alive\". This was parodied in the Season 5 episode of comedy series \"The Office\" \"Stress Relief\" and the song itself was used in a season 11 episode of the medical drama \"Grey's Anatomy\" in 2015.\n\nOn 15 June 2011, the song was featured in a Hands Only CPR PSA campaign video from the American Heart Association and featured actor and medical doctor Ken Jeong in the classic John Travolta outfit from \"Saturday Night Fever\". Vinnie Jones stars in the British version of this CPR video in association with the British Heart Foundation shown on TV in January 2012.\n\nIn 1995, British electronic music group N-Trance recorded a dance version of the song, with new lyrics and rapping by Ricardo da Force. This cover reached number one on Australia's ARIA Singles Chart and Canada's \"RPM\" Dance Chart. The song was also a major hit in Europe, reaching number 2 in Finland, Iceland, Italy, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom, and reached the top 5 in several other countries. On the Eurochart Hot 100, \"Stayin' Alive\" peaked at number 3.\n\nLarry Flick from \"Billboard\" wrote, \"U.K. import enthusiasts are already aware of this jumpy rap interpretation of the Bee Gees disco classic. Early radio reaction holds promise for a quick and successful ride up the Hot 100. There is not a whole lot of substance in TLK's rap [sic], but he certainly has a rousing, infectious style that makes the track spark. Singer Kelly Llorenna injects some bright diva flash during the bridge and chorus.\"\n\nThe music video for \"Stayin Alive\" was directed by British director Alex De Rakoff.\n\nOn 10 February 2017, Capitol Records released a new version of the song entitled \"Stayin' Alive\" (Serban mix). The song was mixed by Serban Ghenea from \"hi-resolution audio files\" from the original recording session of \"Stayin' Alive\", and it was mastered by Tom Coyne. The single was released in commemoration of the 40th anniversary of the \"Saturday Night Fever\" (1977) soundtrack.\n\n\nIn the BBC show \"Sherlock\", as a ringtone of Jim Moriarty, in its series two premiere on New Year's Day, 2012. It is also heard in the series two finale, when Moriarty tells Sherlock that their final problem is 'Stayin' Alive', whilst playing the song on his phone.\n\n\n"}

Police are known to have a well-developed Blue Code of Silence. The code of silence was famously practiced in Irish-American neighborhoods in Boston, Massachusetts such as Charlestown, South Boston, and Somerville. Dan Goldberg and Danny Ben Moshe won Australia’s most prestigious journalism award, the Walkley Documentary Award, for “Code of Silence”, which covers the fight for an investigation into allegations of child sex abuse at Yeshivah College, an all-male Orthodox Jewish school. It portrays the experiences of an Orthodox Jewish father and his son, after the son breaks the code of silence in Melbourne's Orthodox community and goes public with his story of being sexually abused as a student.An Orthodox Jewish concept of mesirah forbids Jews from reporting crimes to civil authorities and keeping them with the Jewish community instead.\n\nA more famous example of the code of silence is Omertà (Italian: omertà, from the Latin: humilitas=humility or modesty), the Mafia code of silence.\n\nThe code of silence is often noted among police officers. This prevents a police officer from incriminating another officer for their wrongdoing. This behavior is done for a number of reasons including professional courtesy and trying to maintain the \"good cop\" facade. In terms of professional courtesy, it would be out of respect that an officer does not make a report for a rule or law that has been broken by another officer. While there are high social tensions between the community and the police force, the code of silence is used to maintain the solidarity among officers so it can appear that they are doing what is morally just in society. This is meant to protect them from the way in which they are critically viewed by the rest of society. Some officers abide by the code of silence out of fear. This fear stems from the possible punishment that can be faced including the loss of promotional opportunities as well as not receiving back up during a potentially dangerous call.\n\n\n"}

Programs that can be seen on VTV included \"Aló Presidente\" and \"Noticias TeleSUR\".\n\nVTV has produced a number of telenovelas, including titles such as \"Ifigenia\", \"Doña Perfecta\", and \"La Dueña\". 1984's \"La Dueña\" was perhaps its most successful and popular production. In 2004, VTV produced another telenovela, \"Amores de Barrio Adentro\", but it was only seen once a week and lasted only a few months. In August 2014, VTV celebrated its 50th anniversary.\n\nCadena Venezolana de Televisión (CVTV) was inaugurated as a privately owned television station on August 1, 1964, at 7:30 p.m. President Raúl Leoni was chosen to be the one to cut the ribbon. Despite its name, however, it was not a nationwide television network at first, broadcasting in the Caracas area during its first years. Only in the late 1960s did the channel become a national network with the opening of stations in major cities nationwide, and became the first network to produce and broadcast a color program in 1971.\n\nThe first logo of VTV thus was the company name (CVTV) on a number 8 (reflecting its channel number in Caracas).\n\nIn September 1974, CVTV, after prolonged financial problems due to its competition with the better-established privately owned television networks in Venezuela, Radio Caracas Televisión and Venevisión, was purchased by the Venezuelan government and rebranded as Venezolana de Televisión (VTV). Between 1974 and 1980, VTV was funded in whole by the government, but due to an internal economic crisis, VTV was forced to air advertisements for extra revenue (this has no longer been occurring since Hugo Chávez became president in 1999). It now only broadcasts program previews and government ads instead.\n\nAfter June 1, 1979, VTV, as well as the other television networks in Venezuela, were allowed, by the government of President Luis Herrera Campins, to transmit completely in color using the NTSC-M system. By 1980, the transition was complete, and VTV was then rebranded as the \"VTV Network\" (\"VTV Red\") until 1982, together with Televisora Nacional, the other state-owned television channel in Venezuela and the first television station to be established, thus briefly uniting channels 5 and 8 into one national network.\n\nIn 1990, VTV, after a government decision to close the Televisora Nacional due to the economic situation of the country, merged it with the latter and thus began simulcasting on channel 5, system M, color NTSC (starting midday). This simulcast lasted until December 4, 1998, when the government handed over the signal of channel five to the Archbishopric of Caracas, which gave birth to Vale TV.\n\nIn 1999, VTV used a logo identical to the nicknamed \"Exploding Pizza\" ident used by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation.\nBy 2014, became the first Latin American station to broadcast Russia's RT Actualidad's newscast.\n\nVTV has several times been targeted during coup attempts. VTV was a target in the 27 November 1992 coup attempt. Military officers, in rebellion against President Carlos Andrés Pérez, attacked the station, and ten station employees were killed.\n\nUnder the Bolivarian government, VTV has been used by the government as an instrument to campaign against Venezuela's opposition and Venezuela's privately owned media with about 75% of its programming transmitted to Venezuelans consisted of Bolivarian propaganda. On the evening of the 11 April 2002 coup attempt against Chávez, Enrique Mendoza, then governor of Venezuela's Miranda State, while being interviewed by Venevisión announced \"a esa basura de canal la vamos a cerrar\" (\"We are going to shut down that trashy channel\"), referring to VTV. Hours later, the Miranda state police occupied VTV and forced it off the air. It remained off the air until April 14, 2002, when Chávez was returned to power.\n\nDuring the Venezuelan general strike of 2002–03, VTV would share ads depicting Venezuelans waiting in line for gas canisters with a voice saying \"The opposition unleashed terrorism on the Venezuelan people and it led to hunger and unemployment. Thanks to the new PDVSA, PDVSA is for all of us, all of us are PDVSA\". VTV would also alter images of pro-government rallies to make them appear larger and used outdated videos to attack opposition members or former supporters. In February 2004, the president of state television station Venezolana de Television (VTV) stated that VTV was not a state television station but a station of President Chávez's political party. VTV also aired ads showing the September 11 attacks, comparing them to the opposition stating \"The people know who the terrorists are\". In 2005, the program \"Dossier\" was cancelled after its host and producer, Walter Martinez, accused the government of corruption.\n\nVTV's slogan is \"El Canal de todos los Venezolanos\", or \"The channel of all Venezuelans\". It had changed temporarily to \"Desde adentro\", or \"From inside\" but it has since been changed back.\n\n\n"}

The novel takes place in late 19th and early 20th centuries and chronicles four generations of the complex Piper Family. It is a story of \"inescapable family bonds, terrible secrets, and of miracles.\" Beginning in Cape Breton Island, Nova Scotia through the battlefields of World War I and ending in New York City, the troubled Piper sisters depend on one another for survival.\n\nThe book was featured by Oprah's Book Club in 2002. As of 2014, it has been published in 23 territories and translated into 19 languages. Nimble Productions purchased the rights to the work for a limited-series TV program.\n\nAt the start of the 20th century, James Piper sets fire to his dead mother’s piano and heads out across Cape Breton Island to find a new place to live. Working as a piano tuner, he meets and eventually elopes with 13-year-old Materia Mahmoud, much to the anger of her wealthy, traditional Lebanese parents. James, madly obsessed with Materia, impregnates her, and then becomes increasingly frustrated and confused by her resulting strange behavior. Materia gives birth to their first daughter, Kathleen, and James subsequently becomes disgusted with his once intriguing wife, finally realizing that he actually married \"a child\". Materia regrets marrying James, and does not take to the child, as she believes her daughter's relationship with James to be revolting. James, however, is swollen with pride over his beautiful daughter, and spends his time ignoring and neglecting Materia while spoiling and smothering Kathleen. Through the eyes of James, his life is perfect, aside from his wife. According to the town folk, however, something appears to be seriously wrong with the Piper family. Materia is taken in by the kind neighbor Mrs. Luvovitz, who teaches her to sew and cook. Materia misses her old life and her family who have since disowned her. She grows to hate James and their daughter Kathleen.\n\nMateria senses danger in James' obsession with their daughter and sees it as her duty to keep him distracted and occupied (especially in the bedroom), lest his affection for the young girl take an unnatural turn. Though his fixation on his eldest daughter is all encompassing, James eventually impregnates Materia three more times in quick succession. She gives birth to three girls, Mercedes, Frances and Lily, only to have newborn Lily die a crib death shortly after. She is from here on in the novel referred to as \"Other Lily\". The novel then explores the girls' relationship with their troubled father; their secretive, silent mother; and friendships that grow between them as they try to figure out their family's strange and mysterious history. As Kathleen grows older, she is perceived by her schoolmates as snobby, and they turn against her. Her father James is her only friend, and when he travels off to war, Kathleen is crushed. James, however, knows that he must leave Kathleen, as he has found himself increasingly attracted to her sexually. To him, enlisting is a way of beating \"the devil.\"\n\nKathleen befriends her younger sisters, and James later returns as a shadow of his former self. Still, he feels an attraction to his eldest daughter, and he sends her to New York City to train with a highly regarded but challenging voice instructor and to fulfill her dream of becoming an opera singer at the Metropolitan Opera House. During her absence, James receives a letter from an \"Anonymous Well-Wisher\" suggesting that Kathleen may have gotten into trouble in New York. He immediately fetches her from New York, bringing her home where it becomes apparent that she is pregnant. Kathleen spends her pregnancy hidden in her family home, but eventually dies during childbirth, though her mother manages to save her twin children, a boy and a girl, by performing an emergency caesarian section. Influenced by her mother's increasing devotion to Catholicism, Kathleen's younger sister Frances believes the babies must be baptized, and so attempts to do so in the creek behind the house the night of their birth. James catches her, and believes she is trying to drown them. He drags her away and the male twin, named Ambrose by Frances, is accidentally left to drown in the creek. The female twin, Lily, contracts polio from the contaminated water in the creek, but survives the disease by what Mercedes attributes to a miracle. Mercedes, Frances and Lily are all raised to believe Materia is Lily's mother. When the accidental suicide of the grieving Materia shatters the world of the remaining Piper sisters, they come to depend on one another for survival. The development of the sisters — Kathleen, the promising diva; Mercedes, the caretaker; Frances, the mischievous one; and disabled Lily, the innocent one — forms the heart of the novel as they all bear the burden of their tragically flawed father.\n\nAt their mother's funeral, Frances is unable to stop herself from laughing at a private joke, and so covers her face with her hands. As a result, she is mistaken for sobbing and offered comfort, illustrating to the young girl how the truth of a situation can diverge from people's perception of it. After the baptism incident, Frances, beaten and all-but-disowned by her father, causes trouble in school, eventually getting herself expelled, despite Mercedes' best efforts to keep her in check. Frances finds solace in her dolls, matinee movies, her late mother's old hope chest, and her darling younger sister Lily. Frances eventually runs away in the middle of the night, ends up in a beaten down pub run by her Lebanese uncle, and becomes the pub's entertainment and pint-sized whore. She says she does it to save money for Lily, but Frances is unsure as to what exactly she is saving for. She discovers her long-lost grandfathers house, and then becomes obsessed with his African maid, Teresa. Frances, remembering fragments of what happened when her sister returned from the city, becomes convinced that Kathleen had taken a lover and become pregnant while away. She fixates on reenacting this aspect of her late sister's life. Eventually she stalks and seduces Teresa's brother, Leo, and becomes impregnated by him, after she has saved enough money for Lily and is ready to stop working. She dreams of becoming a mother to a black child, but her son, Aloysius, is pronounced dead at birth and she becomes depressed. After this trauma, Frances and her father slowly reconcile and she even becomes something akin to a confessor for him before he dies years later.\n\nLily is crippled, one of her legs being smaller than the other, and she wears a leather brace. She loves Frances the most of everyone, and was raised to believe Materia and James were her parents, although Frances liked to tell her otherwise. Lily believes everything Frances tells her, and so believes Ambrose is her guardian angel, and often wished for him to protect Frances after she left the house in the middle of the night. Lily said Ambrose lived in the creek, and he came to her in her dreams. Lily led Mercedes to the spot where Frances seduced Leo Taylor, and Mercedes believed that Lily was a saint.\n\nMercedes spends her time praying, taking care of the family and working hard at school. She flirts with the idea of a romance with the son of Mrs. Luvovitz, but drags her feet because his Jewish ancestry conflicts with her growing religious devotion and sense of propriety. Eventually he moves away, marries, and has children of his own, leaving her with nothing but repressed regret over both her snobbery and having never taken a chance on being happy. James, who has become a moonshiner as his primary income source, suffers a severe stroke and Mercedes is slowly consumed by her role as care-taker in the family; becoming severe and controlling as she gives up on any life for herself outside of this role. This culminates in her deception involving Frances' illegitimate mixed-race child: who was in fact given up for adoption by his disapproving aunt. As Frances and their father grow closer in his old age, Mercedes resents their bond, feeling left out and snubbed after all the sacrifices she has made for her family.\n\nKathleen's diary and old dress is eventually sent home by her caretaker in New York, and after Frances reads it, sends it with Lily to New York, to find Kathleen's lover. As Lily reads through the pages of the diary, we learn of Kathleen's vocal lessons, her instructor she calls the Kaiser, and her illicit love affair with the female black piano accompanist, Rose Lacroix. The romance is a whirlwind, as both women fall madly in love with one another, going to Jazz bars with Rose dressed as a man. Kathleen thrives, and basks in her complete happiness. The world is their oyster, until James barges into Kathleen's apartment one day to find her in bed with the black woman (whom he mistakes for a man). A furious attack on Rose leads to James' jealous rape of Kathleen, as his sexual desire for her finally overcomes him. This reveals Lily's true father, and James brings Kathleen home to Cape Breton, where she then dies in childbirth, her dreams shattered and her short and gloriously promising life cut terribly short. James eventually confesses everything to Frances, and soon after dies in his reading chair, peacefully. Frances finally reveals the family's darkest secrets to her sister Mercedes, who is firmly in denial. Frances dies as an elderly woman with the help of Mercedes, without ever knowing the actual fate of her child.\n\nThe novel ends in New York, as Lily makes her way across North America to Rose's apartment, where the ghostly return of her lover's doppelganger child pushes her over the edge. The two form a friendship and live together for many years, eventually to be visited by a young black man called Anthony, bearing a gift from Mercedes Piper. He delivers a drawing of a family tree, made by Mercedes, finally revealing all the incest, illegitimate children, crib deaths and affairs that make up the Piper family. Anthony is revealed to be Frances' long-lost son Aloysius, and Lily sits him down to tell him all about his mother.\n\nFor \"Fall on Your Knees\", MacDonald won the 1997 Commonwealth Writers Prize for Best First Book.\n\nAlso in 1997, the book won the Canadian Authors Association Award for Fiction.\n\nIt won the Canadian Booksellers Association's Libris Award (date of award unknown).\n\nThe novel was shortlisted for the Giller Prize in 1996.\n\nIt was selected for Oprah's Book Club in 2002 and was chosen for the Amnesty International Book Club for July/August 2014.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2041515", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2041515", "title": "Garry McDonald", "text": "Garry McDonald\n\nGarry George McDonald AO (born 30 October 1948) is an Australian actor, satirist and comedian. In a career spanning five decades he has had many theatre, television and film roles, and has been listed as a National Living Treasure. He is best known as the seemingly naive celebrity interviewer Norman Gunston, through whom he pioneered the \"ambush interviewer\" technique since followed by many others. He received a Gold Logie award for the television \"Norman Gunston Show\" in which he developed the character. He is also famed for his role of the hapless Arthur Beare in the television sitcom \"Mother and Son\". Appointed an Officer of the Order of Australia in 2003 for service to the community in the mental health field and to the arts as an entertainer, he has also been a board member of the Australian mental health organisation beyondblue.\n\nMcDonald was born in Bondi, a beachside Sydney suburb. He was educated at Cranbrook School. During his time at Cranbrook, McDonald developed an interest in acting and, despite family objections, went on to study at the National Institute of Dramatic Art (NIDA), where he obtained a Diploma in Acting in 1967.\n\nIt was while working on \"The Aunty Jack Show\" in 1973, that McDonald first performed the character for which he became best-known, the gauche and inept TV personality Norman Gunston. Gunston's first appearance was in a series of brief sketches written by Wendy Skelcher which saw him reporting uncomfortably on a \"sex-scandal drought\" in the New South Wales city of Wollongong; a drought he eventually breaks by appearing naked on camera.\n\nIn 1975, McDonald further developed the Gunston character on television in the \"Norman Gunston Show\", for which he won a Gold Logie. His writing team included Morris Gleitzman (now a successful children's author) and veteran TV comedy writer Bill Harding, who had written for the Australian TV satire \"The Mavis Bramston Show\".\n\nGunston's trademark outfit consisted of an iridescent-blue tuxedo jacket, black stovepipe trousers, and sneakers with white socks. Gunston had a comb over type hairstyle and used makeup to make his face deathbed white and had bits of tissue drying on shaving nicks.\n\nThe series, which satirised many aspects of Australian culture and show business, was a mixture of live and pre-recorded interviews, awkward musical segments – excruciatingly sung by Gunston himself in the broadest \"strine\" accent – and continuing comedy sketches such as \"Norman's Dreamtime\" (in which Norman read stories to a group of children, such as \"Why Underpants Ride Up\").\n\nUsing Gunston's gormless personality as a cover to break down the defences of his \"victims\", McDonald pioneered the satirically provocative \"ambush interview\" technique which was used to great effect in interviews with Paul McCartney, Muhammad Ali, Keith Moon, Leif Garrett and actress Sally Struthers. When Gunston interviewed Elton John, who was in Australia to promote \"Tommy\", Gunston began by asking \"Are you going to premiere in Wollongong?\" \"No, but I've played tennis with her\", John responded. \"You're thinking of Evonne Wollongong\", Gunston said, \"I'm talking about the city.\"\n\nAs Norman Gunston, McDonald also had a successful recording career, releasing a string of satirical novelty pop records that anticipated the pop parodies of \"Weird Al\" Yankovic. Norman's Top 40 chart hits included his interpretation of the Tom Jones classic \"Delilah\", the punk rock send-up \"I Might Be A Punk But I Love You, Baby\" and \"KISS Army\", a parody of the KISS single \"I Was Made For Loving You\".\n\nMcDonald played Arthur Beare in the television series \"Mother and Son\", starring alongside Ruth Cracknell over six seasons from 1984 until 1994. He won several Logie Awards for his role in the show (see below).\n\nMcDonald joined the cast of the Network Ten drama series \"Offspring\" in 2012 (series three) and is now a series regular. He plays Doctor Philip Noonan.\n\nHe has had lead roles and guest roles in several theatrical stage roles and well as television appearances.\n\nEarly in his career he met his wife, the actress Diane Craig, during a production of \"Let's Get A Divorce\". They have two grown children, and live in Berry on the New South Wales south coast.\n\nSuffering from both depression and anxiety, McDonald talks openly about his condition and has become an advocate. He is an ambassador and former Board director of beyondblue, an Australian national depression initiative and serves as patron of the NSW branch of the Anxiety Disorders Foundation of Australia. McDonald is quoted in the press discussing a link between his own anxiety and that of his grandfather and mother.\n\nMcDonald's condition first came to the public's attention when he reached crisis point after an abortive attempt to revive the Gunston character in 1993. Then again in 1997, McDonald suffered a severe episode during the launch of a new series, \"Rip Snorters\". McDonald's condition also caused him to withdraw from the 2003 production of Patrick Marber's \"Howard Katz.\"\n\nIn 2003, McDonald was appointed an officer of the Order of Australia for service to the community by raising awareness of mental health issues and the effects of anxiety disorders and depression on sufferers and carers, and to the arts as an entertainer.\n\nHis popularity among Australians is reflected his being listed, after public nomination and vote, as a National Living Treasure – someone who has made an outstanding contribution to Australian society in any field of human endeavour.\n\nIn 2015, he was a featured subject on the ABC documentary series \"Australian Story\".\n\n\n\n\nTwo portraits of McDonald have won awards at the Archibald Prize. In 1999 a portrait by artist Deny Christian won the Packing Room award and, in 2006, Paul Jackson's \"All the world's a stage\" won the Peoples Choice award. In 2016, yet another painting of McDonald was a finalist in The Archibald Prize by Kirsty Neilson entitled \"There's No Humour in Darkness\".\n\n"}

{"id": "2041537", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2041537", "title": "Turkish Resistance Organisation", "text": "Turkish Resistance Organisation\n\nThe Turkish Resistance Organisation (, TMT) was a Turkish Cypriot pro-taksim paramilitary organisation formed by Rauf Denktaş and Turkish military officer Rıza Vuruşkan in 1958 as an organisation to counter the Greek Cypriot Fighter's Organization \"EOKA\"(later \"EOKA-B\"). The name of the organization was changed twice. In 1967 to \"Mücahit\", and in 1976 to \"Güvenlik Kuvvetleri Komutanlığı\"(Security Forces Command Center).\n\nThe Greek Cypriot paramilitary organization, EOKA started its anti-British activities for Enosis, the union of the island with Greece. This caused a \"Cretan syndrome\" within the Turkish Cypriot community, as its members feared that they would be forced to leave the island in such a case as was the case with Cretan Turks; as such, they preferred the continuation of the British rule and later, taksim, the division of the island. Due to the Turkish Cypriots' support for the British, the EOKA leader Georgios Grivas declared them an enemy.\n\nThe first underground organization formed by Turkish Cypriots to oppose enosis was Volkan. This organization was founded in 1956. or September 1955 according to different sources, and purportedly with the support of the British administration. Roni Alasor, however, claims that TMT's organisation structure and base had been formed as early as 1950 with its centre in Yenişehir (Yenişehir is the modern section of Ankara). Ankara.During this period, other resistance organizations were founded, such as the Turkish Resistance Legion for the Movement Legion (KİTEM), 9 September Front or Kara Çete (\"Black Gang\"), which reportedly had the support of Fazıl Küçük, but these turned out to be unsuccessful attempts and joined Volkan.\n\nThe exact date of establishment of the TMT varies across several sources, the given dates are 15 or 23 November 1957. Rauf Denktaş, however, claimed that the organization was established on 27 November. The establishment took place in the house of Kemal Tanrıverdi in Nicosia, the Turkish Cypriot attaché at the Turkish embassy, with the participation of Denktaş and Burhan Nalbantoğlu. Its declaration of establishment, which called all Turkish Cypriot members of resistance organizations to unite under the TMT, was printed on 26 November 1957 by the Lefkoşa Türk Lisesi (Nicosia Turkish High School). Initially, it only had about 100 members.\n\nThe TMT was initially formed with a local initiative, with the aims of raising awareness in Turkey about the Cypriot issue and military training and supply for Turkish Cypriot fighters. However, its leaders were aware that such an organization would not be popular without Turkish support, and thus, no organization or efforts to establish a leadership took place at this time. On 2 January 1958, Denktaş and Küçük flew to Ankara to meet with Fatin Rüştü Zorlu. In the meeting, Zorlu asked them if they would be able to receive the weapons sent by Turkey, and Denktaş replied positively, after which Zorlu brought the issue to the attention of the Chief of Staff of the Turkish Armed Forces. After several months of consideration, Turkey decided to support the organization on the condition that Turkish support would be kept secret. Daniş Karabelen was assigned to organize the TMT's foundation.\n\nTMT's members were called mujahid. Communication with its members in Cyprus was by radio and the honorary leader of the TMT was Fatin Rüştü Zorlu.\n\nGeneral Daniş Karabelen, in charge of unconventional warfare office of Turkey, was leading the irregular Turkish Cypriot attacks on Greek Cypriot properties. The Turkish state in 1950s had sent to Cyprus Turkish officers and special forces veterans who arrived secretly and presented themselves as bankers, teachers and business men and trained Turkish Cypriots in tactics of unconventional warfare.\n\nThe TMT was an ethno-nationalist organization, with a right-wing, revolutionary stance. \n\nTMT's main goal was to counter the Greek Cypriot demand for \"enosis\". \n\nTMT was active mainly between 1958 and 1974, promoting partition (in Turkish: Taksim) of Cyprus. TMT claims that their efforts were simply in response to a real threat against their community by EOKA, after 1963, by the Cypriot Government, which by then was under exclusive Greek Cyprus control and had ended representing Turkish Cypriots.\n\nTurkish Cypriot journalist Sener Levent claims that from an interview with a former TMT commander, the famous bath-tub photo featuring a mother and her dead children in a bathtub killed by the Greek-Cypriots that TMT also altered the position of the bodies to make the photographs more ‘effective’ and that many of the photos of the event portrayed in museums were taken after the event. \n\nTurkish Cypriot newspaper \"Avrupa\" claimed that TMT was also responsible for the death of two Turkish Cypriot lawyers in 1962 believed to have been killed by the Greek Cypriots. It further alleged that the real murderer, only whose initials were disclosed (H.C), confessed the crime he had committed to a male nurse at the hospital before he died from excess use of alcohol and cirrhosis.\n\n\n"}

He has also appeared in numerous independent and short films.\n\nIn 1981, Mancuso married Lady Patricia Pelham-Clinton-Hope (born 1949), a daughter of Henry Pelham-Clinton-Hope, 9th Duke of Newcastle, but they were divorced in 1983.\n\nMancuso currently resides in Toronto, where he runs a six-week acting workshop. He has also published a book of poetry titled \"Mediterranean Man\" and created a number of abstract paintings. He is fluent in English and Italian, and speaks conversational French.\n\n"}
{"id": "2041543", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2041543", "title": "Highley", "text": "Highley\n\nHighley is a large village in Shropshire, England, on the west bank of the River Severn.\n\nHighley began as a rural farming community, including an entry in the Domesday Book, later becoming a significant area for stone quarrying which provided some of the stone for Worcester Cathedral. Coal mining began in the area in the Middle Ages, but in the late 19th century the village was revolutionised by coal mining with large-scale operations beginning in 1878. A period of intense house-building also followed, giving Highley its distinctive red-brick terraced miners' houses. In the 1930s, the mine was extended to the neighbouring village of Alveley across the River Severn and a tunnel and bridge constructed between the two. There are also historical bridging points at Bridgnorth to the north and Bewdley to the south, and in Hampton Loade a private bridge used by the emergency services.\n\nThe mine closed in the late 1960s due to subsidence and waterlogging. The bridge remained open to bridleway traffic only, due to subsidence from the steep valley sides. The mine area on the Alveley (east) side was converted into an industrial estate in the late 1960s as coal mining ceased, and subsequently landscaped into the Severn Valley Country Park in the late 1980s. Initially this was as an exercise to use trees to shore up the coal spoils, and later as a tourist destination which now includes public artwork and a sculpture trail, the Seam Pavement Trail.\n\nThe trail is a series of seven bronze plaques depicting Highley's past and incorporates the designs of West Midlands artist Saranjit Birdi. He included many miner's nicknames into the artwork, gleaned from archive information and research within the local community. Nicknames of the miners, such as Dick the Devil, Joyful Clappers, Cider Biscuit, Flaming Heck and others, are incorporated into the work. Birdi calls it \"a seam through time\", echoing the skilfully mined coal seams being laid down and later extracted over time. One plaque, Plough and Lady, depicts Lady Godiva, who owned Highley Manor in the 11th century. Birdi is also responsible for another sculpture, A Song of Steam, at Highley station.\n\nIn 2000, the bridge was declared unsafe and a new footbridge constructed (completed 2006).\n\nHighley was the village where 17-year-old murder victim Lesley Whittle lived, and from which she was abducted by Donald Neilson, the Black Panther, in 1975. Lesley, the daughter of bus firm owner George Whittle (1905–1967), was taken from her home on 13 January 1975 and found strangled on an underground ledge beneath Bathpool Park near Kidsgrove, Staffordshire, on 7 March that year. Neilson was found guilty of murdering Lesley Whittle and three other people (as well as wounding a Dudley security guard, who later died having never fully recovered from his injuries) at his trial in the summer of 1976, and sentenced to life imprisonment.\n\nin 1977 a feature film was made entitled 'The Black Panther', The film is dark, unsensational, and accurately portrays the events leading up to Lesley's tragic death. Nielson is played by Donald Sumpter, and Lesley Whittle by Debbie Farrington. The film was widely banned by cinemas upon release, due to its violent content, and is available on DVD.\n\nHighley has two stops on the Severn Valley Railway, at Highley Station and Country Park Halt.\n\nThe main railway stop is a substantial sandstone Victorian railway station. The station is also home to museum of village life, housed within a vintage post office sorting carriage. Down a small flight of steps from Highley railway station is the Ship Inn Public House, and from there a public footpath leads back to the Country Park and to the Severn Way waymarked walk.\n\nThe other stop is an unmanned request halt near the bridge for the Country Park. Passengers wishing to board the train at the halt stop the train by holding out their hand, as if hailing a bus, and those wishing to alight are advised to speak to the guard of the train before it leaves the previous station.\n\nThere is also a bus service through the village, operated by Diamond West Midlands. The number 125 bus service operates Mondays to Saturdays, from Bridgnorth to Stourbridge.\n\nIn January 2020 it was reported that the GP surgery in the village was having trouble recruiting locum doctors because of potholes on the way in to the surgery on Bridgnorth Road.\n\nHighley houses the Severn Centre, a sports and leisure complex complete with heated lido (open-air swimming pool) that also includes the local library. There is also a Country Park, the sculpture trail plus several restaurants and pubs. A Steam Heritage Centre has been proposed.\n\nThe Highley Colliery Brass Band is a local brass band which existed from the turn of the 19th Century until the closure of the colliery in 1969. It reformed in 1993 when a handful of brass band musicians met at the Bache Public House in Highley. The band adopted regular rehearsals, meeting every Wednesday and Sunday night at the Bache Arms. Member numbers grew, and under the baton of Ray Millichamp the Band began performances under the name of Highley Band. In 2000 to coincide with the new uniform, the band adopted the now familiar Pit Head Wheel emblem and renamed the band to Highley Colliery Band, to reflect the mining heritage of its home village.\n\nThe band sees itself as a social group as well as a musical organisation. The band has members of all ages, young and old. The younger members especially are encouraged to take their music grades, and endeavours to enhance every player's musical ability and enjoyment. The band performs at fetes, parks and concerts throughout the country. The band used to rehearse at the Castle Inn until it closed every Wednesday & Sunday.\n\n\n\n"}

It was a development of the Hunting Jet Provost trainer, itself a jet engined version of the Percival Provost, which originally flew in 1950 with a radial piston engine.\n\nThe BAC 167 Strikemaster is essentially an armed version of the Jet Provost T Mk 5; the Strikemaster was modified with an uprated engine, wing hardpoints capable of carrying four 500 pound Mk82 bombs, two machine guns under the intakes, uprated flap system with two jacks, larger airbrake jacks, new communication and navigation gear, different electrical system, canopy breakers on the ejection seats, and a revised fuel system including tip tanks on the wing tips. First flown in 1967, the aircraft was marketed as a light attack or counter-insurgency aircraft, but most large-scale purchasers were air forces wanting an advanced trainer, although Ecuador, Oman and Yemen have used their aircraft in combat. A total of 146 were built.\n\nThe Strikemaster was capable of operating from rough air strips, with dual ejection seats suitable even for low-altitude escape, and it was therefore widely used by third-world nations. Operations by the type were restricted by most military users after the Royal New Zealand Air Force found fatigue cracking in the wings of its aircraft. Many aircraft retired by Botswana, New Zealand, Saudi Arabia and Singapore have found their way into museums and private collections.\n\nThe Strikemaster was deployed by the Royal Air Force of Oman on several occasions during the Dhofar Rebellion, including a notable appearance providing Close Air Support during the Battle of Mirbat. Three Strikemasters were shot down over the course of the war, including one lost to an SA-7 missile.\n\nThe Ecuadorian Air Force deployed the Strikemaster during the brief 1995 Cenepa War, flying ground sorties against Peruvian positions. An Ecuadorian Strikemaster crashed during a training mission in the Northern Border area, near Colombia, on 25 March 2009. Both pilots ejected; one later died of injuries received during the rescue attempt.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The phrase is used in two senses:\nThe sense of a job guarantee program is used and advocated by some schools of Post-Keynesian economists, notably by authors of Modern Monetary Theory at the University of Missouri-Kansas City, the Levy Economics Institute (both United States) and in the Centre of Full Employment and Equity (Australia), who advocate it as a solution for unemployment.\n\nColloquially, this may refer to work which is undesirable to most people or pays poorly – for instance, in the United States economy, many fast-food and retail industry jobs represent last-resort employment for many workers.\n\nIn economics, the phrase often refers to employers which can hire workers when no other employers are hiring. Their presence may soften the negative impact on employment of downturns in the business cycle. One example of such a program would be the Civilian Conservation Corps, a government agency intended to provide work to young, unemployed men. Military Keynesianism argues that the military can act as an employer of last resort.\n\nA scheme was proposed by the Urban Coalition in the mid-1960s and received some support in the US Senate but was opposed by Lyndon Johnson.\n\nMore recently L. Randall Wray suggested a proposal for the US where workers would be subject to federal work rules, jobs would be tailored to individuals' existing skills, and the US Labor Department would assess proposals for employment and keep a central register; he estimated a total cost of 1–2% of the US's GDP. Marshall Auerback suggested the government hire all unemployed workers, paying close to the minimum wage.\n\nMarshall Auerback mentioned a number of flaws which his proposal attempted to get around. Such a scheme might have an effect on wages for existing jobs. It would also potentially require a large and expensive state bureaucracy to administer.\n\nOn April 3, 2002 Argentina signed into law the social program \"Jefes y Jefas de Hogar Desempleados\". It acts as an employer of last resort for heads of household who are unemployed and unable to find work.\n\n\n"}

It is endemic to south Madagascar.\n\nThis plant is a spiny succulent shrub, with thick water-storing stems and leaves that are deciduous in the long dry season. Although strikingly similar in appearance, it is not closely related to the ocotillo, \"Fouquieria splendens\" of the Sonoran Deserts in North America.\n\nYoung alluaudias form a tangle of stems that last for several years after which a strong central stem develops. The basal stems then die out leaving a tree-like stem that branches higher up on the main trunk.\n\nLike other members of family Didiereaceae, the leaves of \"Alluaudia\", produced from brachyblasts similar to areoles found in cacti, are small, appear single and are accompanied with conical spines. Its flowers are unisexual and radially symmetric. \nThe Didiereaceae comprise 11 species divided into 4 genera, of which the largest is \"Alluaudia\" (six species). Alluaudia has been subdivided into the 2 sections \"Alluaudia\" and \"Androyella\". In this way, \"Alluaudia procera\" has two sisters, \"Alluaudia ascendens\" and \"Alluaudia montagnacii\".\n\nBased on molecular phylogeny conducted \"Alluaudia\", \"Alluaudiopsis\", and \"Didierea\" from the family are all supported as monophyletic. Relationships within the genus \"Alluaudia\" are relevant to the evolution of polyploidy within the family.\n\nResearchers haven't figured out where the family Didiereaceae originates. However, the nearest relative of the Didiereaceae, \"Calyptrotheca somalensis\", is endemic to East Africa, from which the island of Madagascar separated 100 million years ago. Thus, the Didiereaceae may have originated from the dispersal to Madagascar of a \"Calyptrotheca\"-like East African ancestor.\n"}

Today, the Evergreen Group encompasses the Evergreen Marine Corporation, Evergreen International Corporation, EVA Air, Evergreen Aviation Technologies Corporation, Evergreen Air Services Corporation, Evergreen Air Cargo Services Corporation, and Evergreen International Storage and Services Corporation. Additional divisions and subsidiaries exist within several Evergreen Group companies, such as Uniglory Shipping Corporation and Uni Air.\n\nEvergreen Marine is the fourth-largest containerized shipping company in the world, with a fleet of over 150 ships calling on 240 ports worldwide in about 80 countries. Evergreen Marine Corporation includes subsidiaries/divisions Uniglory Shipping Corporation, Hatsu Marine Ltd., and Italia Marittima S.p.A.\n\nEvergreen International Corporation includes Evergreen International Hotels, which operates the chain of Evergreen hotels and resorts worldwide, a Cultural Development Division, and the Evergreen Symphonic Orchestra.\n\nThe largest division of the Evergreen International Corporation is Evergreen International Hotels, which operate nine hotels in Taiwan, China, Thailand, Malaysia, and France.\n\nEVA Air is the international airline of Evergreen Group, operating regular flights to over 40 destinations worldwide. EVA Air features full passenger and dedicated cargo operations to North America, Asia, Europe, and Oceania. The parent company of EVA Air, EVA Airways Corporation, has links with the Evergreen Aviation Technologies Corporation, Evergreen Air Services Corporation, and Evergreen Air Cargo Services Corporation.\n\nEVA Air's domestic and regional subsidiary is Uni Air, operating a network of intra-Taiwan routes and flights to several international destinations in the Southeast Asian region.\n\nIn 1998, Evergreen Group's EVA Air partnered with General Electric to form the Evergreen Aviation Technologies Corporation (EGAT), a heavy maintenance and aircraft overhaul service. EGAT provides safety, repair, and refit services for EVA Air and other airlines' aircraft. In 2006, Boeing awarded EGAT an exclusive contract to convert four Boeing 747-400 aircraft into ultra-large Boeing 747 Large Cargo Freighter Dreamlifters for the new Boeing 787 Dreamliner program.\n\nIn 2020 EGAT announced that they would be segmenting into two distinct units with EGAT MRO to handle EGAT’s maintenance, repair and operations business and EGAT FAB to handle EGAT’s components fabrication business.\n\nEvergreen Air Services Corporation provides logistical and material support in the airline industry.\n\nEvergreen Air Cargo Services Corporation provides logistical and material support in the air cargo industry.\n\nDr Chang Yung-fa, Chairman of the Evergreen Group, was born in Taiwan in 1927. After graduating from Taipei Commercial High School at the age of 18, he went to work in the Taipei office of a Japanese shipping line.\n\nAfter World War II, he joined the seagoing staff of a local shipping company as 3rd officer. His subsequent career was spent with various local companies and he progressed smoothly through the ranks to 2nd officer, chief officer and eventually to captain.\n\nIn 1961, Chang and others established a shipping company; he branched out on his own by establishing Evergreen Marine Corporation on September 1, 1968, with just one secondhand 15,000 dwt vessel, Central Trust.\n\nOver the next four years, Chang built his fleet up to 12 vessels. Within a year, he had expanded to the Middle East. Within three, Chang was dispatching Evergreen ships to the Caribbean.\n\nBack in 1975, Chang realized that containerisation was the way forward. He built four advanced S-type container ships and launched his US East Coast service, adding the US West Coast fifteen months later. Europe followed in 1979.\n\nBy 1984 he started his most ambitious service yet – two 80-day round-the-world services, one circling the globe in an easterly direction, the other westward. Departing every 10 days, the 20 G-type container ships he employed had a capacity of 2,728 containers each and could travel at a speed of 20.5 knots.\n\nThe Evergreen Group has expanded beyond the shipping industry to encompass operations in energy development, air transport, hotels and resort services.\nThe country's first private international airline, EVA Airways Corporation, was established on March 8, 1989, and on July 1, 1991, formally inaugurated its first flight and began a new era of national commercial aviation.\n\nIn line with the development of its airline industry, Evergreen has become the first Taiwanese enterprise to gain a worldwide foothold in the hotel industry.\n\nIn 1998, Evergreen purchased the Italian shipping line Lloyd Triestino renaming as Italia Marittima S.p.A on 1 March 2006, thus providing it with a firm foothold in the European Union. It consolidated this position in 2002 with the establishment of Hatsu Marine in London, a UK-flag shipping company that today operates some of the largest and most sophisticated vessels in the Evergreen Group fleet.\nThe Evergreen Group, with over 18,000 employees and more than 240 offices/agents worldwide, now comprises over 50 major corporations worldwide, three of which are listed on the Taipei Stock Exchange.\n\nIn 2006 the Kuomintang sold its former headquarters to Evergreen Group for $2.3 billion New Taiwan dollars (96 million United States dollars).

The progression has its origins in the various Baroque harmonizations of the descending chromatic fourth in the bass ostinato pattern of passacaglia, known as the \"lament bass\". However, in its fullest form the omnibus progression involves a descent in the bass which traverses a whole octave and includes every note of the chromatic scale. It may also include one or more chromatic ascending tetrachords in the soprano, tenor and alto. \n\n</score>\n\nThey are also known as \"chromatic wedge progressions\", in reference to their wedge-like appearance in score. The origin of the term \"omnibus\" (Latin: \"for all\") to describe such a sequence is unclear, but it is of note that the chord progression encompasses \"all\" of the notes in the chromatic scale.\n\nThe following example is in C major. The lowest part is a \"lament bass\" that descends from the tonic to the dominant using chromatic passing tones before returning at the end up to the tonic in a perfect cadence. The upper voice moves in the opposite direction from the dominant note up to the tonic. The chord names are given, followed where necessary by the inversion in figured bass. For example, 'Cm' refers to a C minor triad in second inversion, and G is a G dominant seventh in third inversion.\n\n</score>\n\nA more extended treatment of this version of the omnibus could be:\n\nFor the purposes of composition, the pattern may be halted at any point, and in so doing may facilitate modulation to any desired key.\n\nModern theorists such as Telesco explain how small sections of omnibus progression (signified in example 1 by brackets around groups of chords) can be viewed as an instance of dominant prolongation achieved through voice exchange. Example 2 (above) is effectively a prolongation of the dominant seventh chord G which utilises chromatic voice movement. The bass voice descends chromatically while the upper voice ascends chromatically, and the inner voices remain stationary on the notes of D and F. Eventually the chromatic movement results in a new inversion of the dominant seventh chord G, resolving to the tonic chord C.\n\n\n"}

He also directed the construction of the Shropshire Canal, linking the East Shropshire Coalfield with the River Severn — the terminus being Coalport Wharf between the Brewery Inn and Coalport Bridge. Coalport at this time was much larger than it is today.\n\nIt forms part of the civil parish of the Gorge and is the southeastern corner of the borough of Telford and Wrekin.\n\nThe Coalport Bridge of cast iron was built in 1818 and unlike its even more famous neighbour at Ironbridge, still takes vehicular traffic, albeit limited to a single line of traffic, a 3-tonne weight limit and a height restriction of 6 ft 6in (1.98 m). It was restored and strengthened in 2004. The bridge links Coalport with Broseley, a small town approximately a mile (1.6 km) away.\n\nThe bridge effectively extends Coalport across the river to an area historically known as Preens Eddy. On this southern side of the bridge is the Woodbridge Inn and the former Coalport West railway station. The Telford and Wrekin borough boundary runs through Preens Eddy - the Woodbridge Inn for instance lies in the Shropshire Council area.\n\nCoalport was home to an important pottery founded in 1795 by John Rose. It produced Coalport porcelain which became popular worldwide. The building it was initially produced in is now a youth hostel and café. Production later moved across the canal to the buildings which are now the Coalport China Museum. Production moved to Staffordshire in 1926, and, although the Coalport name was retained as a brand, the company subsequently became part of the world-famous Wedgwood group.\n\nThe easternmost part of Coalport was, at one time, served by two railway stations. Coalport East (LNWR) was a terminus of a branch from Wellington on the northern river bank. Coalport West (GWR) was a through station on the Severn Valley Railway on the other, southern bank (now part of the Severn Way waymarked walk). The station building is a private residence. Two converted ex-British Railways coaches have been placed between the platforms to provide holiday accommodation.\n\nThe Tar Tunnel, a former source of natural bitumen, is near the Coalport Canal, and is open to the public at certain times.\n\nThe Memorial Bridge is a footbridge spanning the River Severn, linking Coalport with Jackfield. It was built with funds raised by public subscription in 1922, and is in memorial to those who died in the First World War.\n\nThe Coalport Canal runs through the village and greatly aided the settlement's development. The Hay Inclined Plane was completed in 1793 and is one of the country's major industrial monuments and the best preserved and most spectacular of its kind. It enabled canal barges and narrowboats to be transferred from the bottom of the Severn gorge to the top, up a 1 in 4 gradient on wheeled cradles, operated by a team of just four men. It was the equivalent of 27 canal locks and could transport six barges per hour in this fashion, an operation that would have taken over three hours using a traditional lock system. The canal was eventually superseded by rail transport and fell into neglect, silting up and becoming overgrown and was infilled in the 1920s. It was not until the late 1970s that it was partially restored, with further restoration in the 1990s. The Hay Inclined Plane is now part of the Blists Hill museum, part of the Ironbridge Gorge Museum Trust that operates Blists Hill Victorian Town, just half a mile up the hill.\n\nThere are four public houses open in Coalport — the Brewery Inn, the Shakespeare Inn, the Boat Inn and the Woodbridge Inn (on the southern bank, by Coalport Bridge).\n\n\n\n"}

The term derives from \"قدر (qadar)\", \"power\". Some of their doctrines were later adopted by the Mu'tazilis and rejected by the Ash'aris.\n\nQadariya was one of the first philosophical schools in Islam. The earliest document associated with the movement is the \"Risala\" by Hasan al-Basri, which was composed between 75/694 and 80/699, though debates about free will in Islam probably predate this text.\n\nAccording to Sunni sources, the Qadariyah were censured by Muhammad himself by being compared to Zoroastrians, who likewise deny predestination. It is reported in Sunan Abu Dawood: \nNarrated Abdullah ibn Umar: The Prophet said, \"The Qadariyyah are the Magians of this community. If they are ill, do not pay a sick visit to them, and if they die, do not attend their funerals.\"\n\nThe medieval sources upon which information about the Qadariya is based include Hasan al-Basri's \"Risālat al-qadar ilā ʿAbd al-Malik\" (\"Epistle to ʿAbd al-Malik against the Predestinarians\"); anti-Qadari letters by Hasan ibn Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiyyah and Caliph Umar II; the work of the 9th-century Islamic scholar Khushaysh; the list of Qadarites by Ibn Qutayba, Ibn Hajar, al-Suyuti, Ibn al-Murtada and al-Dhahabi; scattered references to the Qadariya in the work of al-Tabari; and counter-Qadari polemics in the standard hadith collections of \"Sahih Muslim\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2041603", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2041603", "title": "Floribbean cuisine", "text": "Floribbean cuisine\n\nFloribbean cuisine is found in varying forms in Florida restaurants and in the homes of many Floridians throughout the state. The essence of what makes a particular dish \"Floribbean\" is similar to that of certain other aspects of variable Floridian culture: it is influenced by visitors and immigrants from all over the world, but especially from the Caribbean (with notable influence from Haiti, the Bahamas, Barbados, Guyana, Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago), Cuba and Puerto Rico. In the case of southern Florida in particular, a subdivision called Latin-Floribbean or Hispano-Floribbean cuisine also borrows features of Latin American cuisine from such countries as Mexico, Cuba,\nColombia, Argentina, Brazil, and the Dominican Republic, as well as the US commonwealth of Puerto Rico, adding more influences to the mix. To distinguish the Latin Caribbean style from the non-Latin Caribbean style, the terms Afro-Floribbean cuisine and Indo-Floribbean cuisine are sometimes used, as the majority of the Caribbean islands have substantial populations of African or Indian heritage, descendants of slaves or immigrants transported to the islands colonized by British, French, and Dutch settlers.\n\nThe arrival of several waves of Caribbean, Hispanic, and Asian immigrants to Florida since the late 1800s has played an important role in the development of Floribbean cuisine. The use of seafood, as well as of Asian and Caribbean ingredients and cooking methods have made Floribbean cookery generally healthier than meat- and fat-heavy cuisines. Floribbean-style cooking also incorporates an exotic spice pantry: red curry, lemongrass, ginger, and scallions are as commonly used today in Floribbean cookery as grits and cobbler are in other parts of Florida.\n\nAs Floribbean cuisine evolved in South Florida it was strongly influenced by Asian culinary principles emphasizing the use of locally harvested Asian fruits and vegetables that will grow only in subtropical parts of the continental United States, where it rarely freezes.\n\nVarious types of the wide variety of seafood caught off Florida's 1350 miles of coastline are often paired with tropical fruits such as mangos, papayas, plantains, coconuts, citrus and lychees. The fusion of these flavors led to the development of this distinctive South Florida regional cuisine. \n\nTypical features of Floribbean cuisine include:\n\n\nFloribbean cooking often uses less spicy heat than the Caribbean dishes that inspire it, but there is extensive use of several kinds of peppers. This pungency, however, is almost always moderated by the use of mango, papaya, rum, almond, coconut, key lime, or honey.\n\nIn south Floridian homes, traditional Southern foods such as coleslaw, black-eyed peas, or crab cakes are often served in the same meal as a more nuanced Floribbean dish. In most restaurants serving Floribbean cuisine, however, entire meals are planned around a succession of delicate, complex flavors and so most dishes have been altered from their traditional forms.\n\n\"Further information: Regional variations of barbecue\"\n\nThis is one of the three regional versions of barbecue in Florida, found mainly in Central Florida, of which this is the first of two styles to be influenced by Caribbean. This version of Floridian barbecue basically mixes American Deep South barbecue styles with Indo-Caribbean and Afro-Caribbean barbecue styles.\n\nThis mixes Floribbean cuisine with Latin American cuisine, resulting in strong Cuban, Puerto Rican, and Dominican influences. As commonly served in Florida, some dishes are variations or fusions of traditional foods from various Latin American / Hispanic countries, while others are original dishes inspired by the older cuisines. Much of this cuisine can be found in Central Florida and South Florida. \nBelow are some examples:\n\nA fusion of Floribbean barbecue and Latin-Floribbean cuisine, tropical barbacoa blends Mexican, Cuban, Puerto Rican, Jamaican, Bahamian, and American Deep South barbecue cuisines. This is another of the three regional barbecue styles in Florida, found mainly in Southern Florida, and the second of two influenced by Caribbean cuisines. This is also the only Floridian barbecue style that is also influenced by Latin American cuisine. One example of this style is \"pechuga de pollo a la plancha\" (grilled chicken breast seasoned with citrus juice). Brazilian-style steakhouses (\"rodizios\") also very commonly employ this barbecue style.\n\n"}

It lends its Latin name to the Mesolithic Capsian culture. With a population of 105,264, Gafsa is the 9th-largest Tunisian city.\n\nGafsa is the capital of the southwest of Tunisia and is both a historical oasis and home to the mining industry of Tunisia. The city had 111,170 inhabitants at the 2014 census, under the ruling of the mayor, Malek Necibi. The city lies by road southwest of Tunis. Its geographical coordinates are .\n\nExcavations at prehistoric sites in the Gafsa area have yielded artefacts and skeletal remains associated with the Capsian culture. This Mesolithic civilisation has been radiocarbon dated to between 10,000 and 6,000 BCE. The associated ancient population, known as the \"Snail eaters\", are known for their extensive middens of snail shells. They are believed to be the ancestors of the modern Berbers.\n\nThe city of Capsa belonged to King Jugurtha, who deposited his treasures there. It was captured by Gaius Marius in 106 BC and destroyed, later becoming reestablished under the Punic-style magistracy of \"sufetes\" before being granted the status of a Roman colonia. Capsa was an important city of Roman Africa near the Fossatum Africae. Roman cisterns are still evident in the city ruins\n\nThe Vandals conquered the Roman city and ruled it until the death of Genseric (477). The Berbers then occupied it, making it the capital of a Romano-Berber kingdom until subjected to Byzantium under Justinian I (527–565). He made Capsa the capital of the province of Byzacena. The Duke of Byzacena resided there. In 540, the Byzantine governor general Solomon built a new city wall, naming the city Justiniana Capsa.\n\nThe Arab army of Uqba ibn Nafi conquered Gafsa in 688, in spite of resistance from the Berbers. After the Arab conquest, Capsa started to lose importance, replaced by Muslim-founded Kairouan.\n\nHistorians such as Camps and Laverde consider Gafsa the place in North Africa where African Romance last survived, until the 13th century, as a spoken language.\n\nExtant documents give the names of a few of the bishops of Capsa.\n\nIn the 3rd century, Donatulus took part in the council that Saint Cyprian convoked in Carthage in 256 to discuss the problem of the \"lapsi\".\n\nIn the 4th century, at the Council of Carthage (349), Fortunatianus of Capsa was present, mentioned as the first among the bishops of Byzacena. A Donatist bishop of Capsa called Quintasius was at the council held at Cabarsussi in 393 by a breakaway group of Donatists led by Maximianus.\n\nIn the 5th century, at the joint Council of Carthage (411) attended by Catholics and Donatists, Gams and Morcelli say Capsa was represented by the Donatist Donatianus, and that it had no Catholic bishop. According to the more recent Mesnage, Donatianus was instead the Donatist bishop of Capsus in Numidia, and Capsa in Byzacena was represented by the Catholic Fortunatus and the Donatist Celer, whom the earlier sources attributed to Capsus. All three sources agree in attributing to Capsa the Vindemialis who was one of the Catholic bishops whom Huneric summoned to Carthage in 484 and then exiled. However, the latest editions of the Roman Martyrology, which commemorates Vindemialis on 2 May, call him bishop of Capsus in Numidia.\n\nCapsa still had resident bishops at the end of the 9th century, being mentioned in a \"Notitia Episcopatuum\" of Leo VI the Wise (886–912). but a community may have lasted until the early 12th century\n\nNo longer a residential bishopric, Capsa is today listed by the Catholic Church as a titular see.\n\nPhosphate mines were discovered in 1886, and Gafsa today is home to one of the largest mines of phosphate in the world.\n\nIn the Second World War, Gafsa suffered heavy bombardment from both the German and Italian side and the Allies. Part of its Kasbah was destroyed.\n\nOn 27 January 1980, a group of dissidents armed and trained by Libya occupied the city to contest the régime of Habib Bourguiba. 48 people were killed in the battles.\n\nThe Gafsa region has had an active political voice throughout its history, and various events there have shaped its political developments in the various phases of modern Tunisia.\n\nIn 2008, Gafsa was the center of riots directed against the government of President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali. The government was swift and brutal in its suppression of the uprising, but this movement has since been credited with sowing the first seeds of the Jasmine Revolution that removed Zine El Abidine Ben Ali from power three years later, igniting the Arab Spring across much of North Africa and the Middle East.\n\nIn 2014, a lake suddenly appeared around 25 kilometers from the town. The cause of the lake's formation is currently unknown.\n\nGafsa – Ksar International Airport is located in the city.\n\nEl Kawafel Sportives de Gafsa (Arabic: القوافل الرياضية بقفصة, often referred to as EGSG) is the main football club of Gafsa.\n\nRadio stations:\n\nand other government and private Tunisian radios broadcast in Gafsa as Shems FM, RTCI, Youth Radio, Culture Radio, Zitouna, and the National Radio.\n\nGafsa is twinned with:\n\nGafsa has a hot desert climate (Köppen climate classification \"BWh\").\n\n\n"}

He served as Bishop of Kraków from 1423 until his death in 1455. He took part in the management of the country's most important affairs, initially as a royal secretary under King Władysław II Jagiełło and later as the effective regent during King Władysław III's minority. In 1449 he became the first native Polish cardinal.\n\nAt the age of twenty he was secretary to King Władysław Jagiełło, and fought with him in the battle of Grunwald on 15 July 1410. A favourite with the king, he took part in the management of the country's most important affairs. His influence with the king greatly aided him in opposing the Hussites, who had gained royal favour. On 9 July 1423, he was appointed to the episcopal See of Kraków, and in 1433 he was sent by the king as legate to the council of Basle, where he endeavoured to be on friendly terms with both parties.\n\nIn the 1430s he opposed Spytek of Melsztyn in a conflict which led to a short lived civil war and Spytek's death in 1439.\n\nOn 18 December 1439, he was created cardinal priest with the titular church of St. Prisca, by Pope Eugene IV. (The antipope Felix V also made him a cardinal on 20 January 1440.). As cardinal, his influence in Poland was second only to that of the king, and, during the frequent absence of Casimir IV in Lithuania, he transacted the affairs of the State.\n\nHe was recognized as one of the two most important Polish magnates of his time (the other one was magnate ).\n\nIn 1449, after the death of archbishop of Gniezno and primate of Poland Wincenty Kot, the position was proposed to Oleśnicki, but he refused it. It then passed to his political rival, bishop Władysław Oporowski.\n\nIn his conduct of Poland's affairs Oleśnicki entertained far-reaching imperial dreams, which included a complete assimilation of Lithuania into the Polish state and the conquest of Silesia from the Kingdom of Bohemia. In particular, Oleśnicki pursued the idea of a Crusading alliance with Hungary against the Ottoman Turks, with the ultimate aim of extending Poland's boundaries to the Black Sea. This was manifested in promoting Władysław III's taking the Hungarian Crown - to which some Polish magnates were strongly opposed. However, all these aspirations came to naught with King Władysław's death at the Battle of Varna.\n\nBeing a man of great learning, he advanced the study of arts and letters in every possible way, and the flourishing condition of the University of Krakow during his episcopacy is due chiefly to his efforts. The well-known chronicler Jan Długosz was his secretary. To repress the spread of Hussitism he called Giovanni da Capistrano (then in Breslau) and the Minorites to Kraków.\n\nDa Capistrano, whom Oleśnicki invited, was also known for his anti-Jewish zeal, in which he engaged in Poland as in other countries. Oleśnicki's own Anti-Jewish intolerance was manifested in his strongly criticising Casimir IV for reaffirming in 1453 the tolerant measures towards Jews enacted by Casimir III. Under Oleśnicki's influence, the 1454 Statutes of Nieszawa included the provisions that Jews' rights be \"restricted when they contradict canon law\" and that Polish Jews be compelled to wear distinctive clothing. However, this was never enforced in practice.\n\n"}

The thirteen-minute film, which was released almost 18 months after \"Star Wars\", mainly consisted of inside jokes and visual puns that heavily depended upon audience familiarity with the original. The theme song is Richard Wagner's famous \"Ride of the Valkyries\".\n\nThe film begins with the text \"Meanwhile — in another part of the galaxy — later that same day\". A household steam iron flies through space, fleeing a toaster, which fires toast at it. Two robots named 4-Q-2 (who looks like the Tin Man from the 1939 film \"The Wizard of Oz\") and Arty-Deco (a canister vacuum cleaner), escape from the evil Empire. After launching from the ship (a cassette player) in an escape pod (a cassette tape), they land on a desert planet (a watermelon). They are found by young Fluke Starbucker (played by future multi-platinum award-winning music producer Scott Mathews) who finds a video message saved on Arty-Deco. It is a loop of Princess Anne-Droid saying \"Help me, Augie Ben Doggie, you're my only hope.\" Upon meeting Augie \"Ben\" Doggie (of the venerable Red-Eye Knights), Fluke receives his father's lightsaber (a flashlight). After tricking the Imperial Steam Trooper guards (steam cabinets) to let them into the city, they reach a cantina, which Fluke describes as \"too weird\". The cantina is a country-and-western bar, where they meet space renegade Ham Salad and Chewchilla the Wookiee Monster (a puppet that resembles Cookie Monster from \"Sesame Street\"). Meanwhile, the villainous Darph Nader is interrogating the Princess. When she refuses to talk (mainly because she can't understand him; his speech is muffled by his welder's mask), he destroys her peaceful home planet, Basketball.\n\nAfter a light-speed chase, Fluke, Ham, Augie, and the rest are sucked into the enemy base (a waffle iron) by a tractor beam. While the rest of the crew attempt to rescue the Princess from the base, Augie tries to shut off the tractor beam, which requires going to an exposed pylon and lowering a switch next to an animated picture of a farm tractor. After they rescue the Princess, Augie Ben Doggie chooses to stay behind to battle Darph Nader, and the rest of the group dismiss him as a \"martyr\". Their spaceship is assaulted by bits of tin-foil trash, which makes Chewchilla jittery until he spies Princess Anne-Droid's hair whorls, which are cinnamon rolls worn on the sides of her head. He eats one as the Princess looks on in disgust.\n\nFluke joins a squad of spaceships (corkscrews). He is told to \"trust your feelings\" by the ghostly voice of Augie. The climactic destruction of the enemy base is not shown. The film ends with the voiceover, \"May the Farce be with you\". The very end of the credits state that the production was \"filmed on location in space\", followed by a statement beginning \"All scenes depicting violence towards animals were deleted from the film.\", reflecting the legal statement that was beginning to appear in film credits at that time.\n\n\n\n\n\"Hardware Wars\" was written and directed by San Francisco native Ernie Fosselius and produced by Michael Wiese. It was structured as a mock movie trailer, and Fosselius even secured narration from veteran voice-over artist Paul Frees. Fosselius capitalised on his budget limitations by using deliberately ridiculous household objects as props; spaceships were represented with such items as steam irons, toasters and cassette recorders, and the lightsaber of \"Fluke Starbucker\" was a flashlight. The characters, played by actors who were just as low-budget as the props, were also parodied in name and appearance; for example, Chewbacca the Wookiee was replaced by \"Chewchilla the Wookiee Monster,\" an obvious Cookie Monster puppet, dyed brown, and Darth Vader's counterpart, \"Darph Nader\" (also a parody of consumer protection advocate Ralph Nader), wore a welding helmet that distorted his voice so much that no one could understand anything he said. Other notable characters include \"Ham Salad,\" \"Augie Ben Doggie,\" \"Princess Anne-Droid,\" and the drones, 4-Q-2 (who resembles the Tin Woodman from \"The Wizard of Oz\") and \"Arty Deco\" (an antique canister vacuum cleaner).\nUpon completion, Scott Mathews vowed to never act in another film again, saying; \"I'm goin' out on top, baby!\"\n\nAlthough \"Hardware Wars\" was a spoof, the creators found a very talented post-production crew. The visual effects department consisted of John Allardice, Andy Lesniak, Glen David Miller, and Fred Tepper. John Allardice has since gone on to work on huge films such as $100 million grossing film \"Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.\" Andy Lesniak went on to work on many films most notably Man of Steel. Glen David Miller and Fred Tepper would go on to work on Titanic]together. Along with writing and directing the film Ernie Fosselius did puppet work, served as lead animator, and lead editor. Although Ernie did not have much success in these areas he did end up having a good career as a sound recordist and editor and has credits on and ironically, \"Spaceballs\".\n\nRuntime: 13 min (USA)\n\nSound Mix: Mono.

This song from Wagner's epic opera \"Der Ring des Nibelungen\", appears in famous films such as \"Apocalypse Now\", which is quite ironic as this film is a spoof trailer while Wagner's music is world renowned as a marvel of opera.\n\nWhen \"Hardware Wars\" premiered in 1978 it was the first of its kind, the first ever \"Star Wars\" parody. As noted in Shock Cinema Magazine \"Hardware Wars\" \"laid the groundwork for every DIY movie send up that now pops up on YouTube… Premiering when George Lucas's cash cow was still filling the theaters, it quickly became a pre-VCR, word-of-mouth phenomenon.\" This idea of a spoof movie seems so commonplace these days, but in 1978 it was quite a new approach. The idea of a \"Star Wars\" spoof became very popular and countless more parodies were created notably including the \"Family Guy\" feature length episode \"Blue Harvest\", \"George Lucas In Love\", and \"Spaceballs\". The creators of \"Hardware Wars\", Ernie Fosselius and Michael Wiese seemed to realize their influence on future \"Star Wars\" spoofs , particularly on \"Spaceballs\". As noted on \"salon.com\", \"After the success of \"Hardware Wars,\" Wiese and Fosselius resisted the temptation to produce more sci-fi spoofs. \"At one time, someone did offer to finance a full-length feature of 'Hardware Wars,' but we passed,\" Wiese says. \"We always knew it was a one-joke movie and wouldn't sustain that length. Of course that didn't stop Mel Brooks from 'quoting' us -- some might say ripping us off -- with 'Spaceballs.'\" This shows how influential \"Hardware Wars\" was over the legendary \"Spaceballs\". \"Hardware Wars\" Truly inspired the \"Star Wars\" spoof trend that is still very much alive over 40 years later.\n\nAccording to tested.com \"Hardware Wars\" \"was the first parody of Lucas' space opera (\"Star Wars\"\"--and reportedly one he (George Lucas) enjoyed.\" According to the book \"Hollywood's Copyright Wars\" by Peter Decherney \"Hardware Wars\" created an environment where \"George Lucas and his company have acknowledged and embraced fans of their franchise\" and have often showcased fan made films, including \"Hardware Wars.\"\n\n\"Hardware Wars\" won over 15 first-place film festival awards, including the award for Most Popular Short Film at the Chicago Film Festival. It is considered to be the most profitable short film of all time, grossing US$1,000,000; considering its paltry US$8,000 budget, its profit ratio was much better than \"Star Wars\". George Lucas said in a 1999 interview on the UK's \"The Big Breakfast\" television show that \"Hardware Wars\" was his favorite \"Star Wars\" parody.\n\nIn 2003, the film was honored by Lucasfilm when it was given the Pioneer Award at that year's Official \"Star Wars\" Fan Film Awards. In August 2010, \"Time\" magazine listed it as one of the Top 10 \"Star Wars\" fan films.\n\nIn 2017, Rian Johnson paid tribute to it by referencing it in the \"Star Wars\" film \"The Last Jedi\" in a scene in which a robotic steam iron is briefly framed to resemble a landing spaceship. Johnson said that John Williams had enjoyed creating a bombastic music cue to match the iron descending on a uniform.\n\nThe fact that \"Hardware Wars\" has been received by George Lucas and the \"Star Wars\" franchise in general is sure to have made \"Hardware Wars\" creators Michael Wise and Ernie fosselius very happy as the main purpose for creating this film was to meet George Lucas as Michael Wise stated in the book \"Producers on Producing: The Making of Film and Television\" by Irv Broughton. In the book Michael Wise states \"When Ernie Fosselius and I originally made the film we had no idea what to do with it. We just wanted to meet George Lucas, who had made \"Star Wars.\" That would have been fine.\"\n\nIn \"Time Out New York\", critic Andrew Johnston wrote: \"Thanks to Digital Domain, \"Hardware Wars\" now includes a fleet of Corkscrew Fighters as well as effects that parody Lucas's additions to the Tatooine sequence in the first film. The contrast between the slick new effects and the bargain-basement old ones adds a new level of satire to the film and nicely spoofs some of Lucas's less-than-seamless changes to his own film.\"\n\nAs of April 2020 \"Hardware Wars\" has an audience score of 68% on American film rating website Rotten Tomatoes.\n\n\"Hardware Wars\" had originally been available on film from Pyramid Films. It was first made available commercially on home video with the Warner Home Video release \"Hardware Wars, and Other Film Farces\", which also included another Fosselius parody, \"Porklips Now\". The tape also included \"Closet Cases of the Nerd Kind\" and the animation classic \"Bambi Meets Godzilla\".\n\nTo spoof the \"Special Edition\" re-release of \"Star Wars\" in 1997, which included additional scenes and more advanced digital special effects, \"Hardware Wars\" was re-released on VHS as a twenty-minute \"Special Edition,\" with new digital \"special defects.\" Fosselius did not participate or approve of this release, as noted in a disclaimer on the packaging.\n\nThe film was released on DVD in 2002 in its original form, with commentary tracks and other special features.\n\nIt was later released on DVD again by Apprehensive Films for its 30th Anniversary. This release is approved and licensed from Ernie Fosselius.\n\n"}

A 2016 genetics study confirmed significant divergence between the three subspecies of North America's bighorn sheep: Sierra Nevada bighorn sheep, Rocky Mountain bighorn sheep and desert bighorn sheep. Sierra Nevada bighorn sheep were listed as a federally endangered subspecies in 2000. As of 2016, over 600 Sierra bighorn remain in the wild.\n\nSierra bighorn range in color from white to dark brown, with a white rump and dark tail. There is some seasonal change in coloration due to the shedding of a thicker winter layer. Specialized hooves with adhesive soles provide traction in steep rocky terrain. Female bighorn (ewes) can weigh up to and have shorter, narrow horns, while male bighorn (rams) can weigh as much as and have massive, curving horns. The horns of both rams and ewes are composed of a dense layer of keratin covering a core of bone.\n\nThe average lifespan for Sierra bighorn males and females has been observed as 8 to 12 years.\n\nSierra Nevada bighorn sheep are gregarious, with group size and composition depending on gender and season. Spatial segregation by gender occurs outside of the mating season. Bighorn sheep ewes generally remain with the same band in which they were born. Males older than 2 years of age remain apart from females and younger males for most of the year. During the late fall and winter, the groups come together and concentrate in suitable winter habitat. During this time, males compete for dominance with behaviors like horn clashes. Breeding takes place in late fall, generally November and December. Lambing occurs between late April and early July on safe, precipitous, rocky slopes; most lambs in the Sierra Nevada are born in May and June. Ewes and lambs often occupy steep terrain that provides a diversity of exposures and slopes for escape cover.\n\nSierra bighorn are found in portions of the Sierra Nevada from Yosemite National Park to Olancha Peak. Habitat occurs from the eastern base of the range as low as to peaks above . Sierra bighorn inhabit open areas where the land is rocky, sparsely vegetated, and characterized by steep slopes and canyons. Wehausen provides a detailed description of Sierra bighorn habitat throughout their range. Bighorn prefer open ground with high visibility to better detect predators and allow enough time to reach steep, rocky areas (escape terrain). Forests and thick brush are usually avoided if possible.\n\nMost bighorn live at elevations from in subalpine and alpine areas during the summer. During winter, some bighorn occupy high-elevation, windswept ridges, while others migrate to lower elevations to avoid deep snow and to find forage.\n\nSierra bighorn are ruminant herbivores with four-chambered stomachs. Bighorn are primarily grazers, consuming various grasses, forbs, and woody vegetation depending on season and location. Naturally occurring mineral licks provide necessary minerals for bone and muscle growth.\n\nCenturies of unregulated hunting, disease outbreaks, and mountain lion predation took a heavy toll on the Sierra bighorn population. However, disease played the largest role in the decline of the subspecies with domestic sheep transmitting virulent diseases, in particular pneumonia from Pasteurella, beginning in the 1870s. By the 1970s about 250 animals remained, occupying only two small areas of their former vast range. Translocations by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) helped to reestablish bighorn herds in historic habitat, but in spite of these efforts the population hit a low of about 100 total individuals in 1995. On January 3, 2000, Sierra bighorn were listed as a federally endangered subspecies.\n\nIn 1999, CDFW was made the lead agency responsible for implementing Sierra bighorn recovery. A group of stakeholders drafted the \"Sierra Nevada Bighorn Sheep Recovery Plan\", and CDFW formed the Sierra Nevada Bighorn Sheep Recovery Program to work toward the goals of the Recovery Plan. Since then conditions have been particularly favorable for population growth, with the total number of individuals reaching about 250 by 2002 and about 600 in 2016. The Recovery Program continues to monitor population growth, habitat use, and cause-specific mortality of Sierra bighorn, and to carry out augmentations and translocations in an effort to achieve recovery goals.\n\nIn 2014, fourteen Sierra Nevada bighorn sheep were flown to Big Arroyo in Sequoia National Park via helicopter to establish a population on the western side of the Sierra Crest.\n"}

The airport covers and has two runways. The facility operates year-round, with most flights occurring in the fall, winter, and spring.\n\nThe airport was described as number 3 in a 2011 listing of \"America's Most Stress-Free Airports\" by \"Smarter Travel\".\n\nPSP was built as a United States Army Air Corps emergency landing field in 1939 on land owned by the Agua Caliente Band of Cahuilla Indians due to its clear weather and its proximity to March Field and the Los Angeles area.\n\nIn March 1941 the War Department certified improvements to the existing airport in Palm Springs as essential to National Defense. The airport was approved to serve as a staging field by the Air Corps Ferrying Command 21st Ferrying Group in November 1941. Land was acquired to build a major airfield a half mile from the old airfield site. The new airfield, Palm Springs Army Airfield was completed in early 1942, and the old air field was then used only as a backup. (Aerial pic of the old airfield at , looking ENE)\n\nMany of the field's Air Transport Command 560th Army Air Forces Base Unit personnel stayed at the comfortable Lapaz Guest Ranch nearby. Training conducted at the airfield was by the 72d and 73d Ferrying Squadrons in long-distance over-water flying and navigation. Later, training was also provided to pursuit pilot training by IV Fighter Command 459th Base Headquarters and Air Base Squadron. Training was in P-51 Mustangs, P-40 Warhawks and P-38 Lightnings.\n\nOn June 1, 1944, training moved to Brownsville Army Airfield, Texas, and the airfield was used for Army and Navy transport flights until the end of April 1945. The auxiliary field or backup field was declared surplus on May 12, 1945, and the main airfield was declared excess and transferred to the War Assets Administration for disposal in 1946 and it was sold to private buyers. The City of Palm Springs purchased the land in 1961 and converted it to Palm Springs Municipal Airport.\n\nPalm Springs had scheduled passenger service in 1934 operated by Palm Springs Air Lines with Ford Trimotor aircraft with flights to the Union Air Terminal (now the Hollywood Burbank Airport) in Burbank. Western Airlines flights began in 1945–46 followed by Bonanza Air Lines in 1957–58. In 1964 Western Lockheed L-188 Electras flew nonstop to Las Vegas, Los Angeles and San Diego. Bonanza and successors Air West and Hughes Airwest served Palm Springs for many years with the Fairchild F-27 followed by Douglas DC-9s. American Airlines Boeing 707s appeared in winter 1967-68. By 1969 American had four Boeing 707 departures a day from the airport, two nonstops to Los Angeles and two nonstops to Phoenix and on to Chicago. Trans World Airlines (TWA) Boeing 707s arrived in 1978, flying to Chicago via Phoenix.\n\nScheduled nonstops did not reach beyond California, Las Vegas, and Phoenix until winter 1969–70 when American Airlines started a nonstop to Chicago O'Hare Airport. In the 1970s American McDonnell Douglas DC-10s appeared, the largest aircraft ever scheduled to PSP. In 1976 American was flying the DC-10 to LaGuardia Airport via Chicago O'Hare Airport and Boeing 727-100s to Dallas/Fort Worth, Phoenix and Los Angeles. In 1976 Western Boeing 727-200s and Boeing 737-200s flew nonstop to Las Vegas, Los Angeles and San Francisco. In 1987 Western was merged into Delta Air Lines which continues to serve PSP seasonally. Other jets to Palm Springs in the past included Air21, Air California and successor Air Cal, America West Airlines, CP Air, the original Frontier Airlines (1950-1986), Hughes Airwest, Morris Air, Pacific Express, Pan Am, Reno Air, Republic Airlines (1979-1986) and USAir.\n\nCommuter and regional airlines at Palm Springs from the late 1970s to the 1990s included Air Bahia, Air Nevada, American Eagle operated by Wings West Airlines, America West Express operated by Mesa Airlines, Cable Commuter Airlines, California Seaboard Airlines, Dash Air, Delta Connection operated by SkyWest Airlines, Imperial Airlines, Inland Empire Airlines, Scenic Airlines, SkyWest Airlines (operating independently), Sun Aire Lines, Swift Aire Lines, Trans World Express operated by Alpha Air, United Express operated by WestAir and later by SkyWest Airlines, and USAir Express followed by US Airways Express operated by Trans States Airlines and StatesWest Airlines.\n\nOn December 30, 2006 a U.S. Air Force Presidential Boeing VC-25 (the USAF military version of the Boeing 747), departed Palm Springs International Airport with the body of the 38th President of the United States, Gerald R. Ford, and delivered it to Washington, D.C., for memorial services.\n\nAlthough a true international airport, PSP only has U.S. customs and immigration facilities for general aviation aircraft including business jets. All international airline flights are currently operated from Canadian cities that have pre-clearance facilities.\n\nPSP's passenger terminal consists of three parts—the main building, the elevated Sonny Bono Concourse to the north, and a yet-unnamed concourse to the south. Airside, it has a unique open-air layout in that all passenger walkways connecting these structures are roofless.\n\nThe main building is the land side of the airport. Road traffic accesses the airport directly off of Tahquitz Canyon Way (from downtown) or Kirk Douglas Way, itself fed by Ramon Road from points east. Uncovered parking areas are directly in front of the building. The center section houses the security screening area and automatic doors to/from the open-air walkways airside. Ticketing is on the right (south) wing, while baggage claim and car rental counters are on the left (north).\n\nDeparting passengers are routed first to airline ticket counters or kiosks for checking in. Since all gates at Palm Springs are in the two outlying concourses, passengers must pass through the security screening area for admittance into the secure air side of the airport. After leaving the main building via the automatic doors leading out to the open-air courtyard, passengers can access seventeen full-service gates at the two concourses.\n\nOn November 4, 1999, the new Sonny Bono Concourse opened as part of the 1994–2000 expansion. Named in honor of the late singer, congressman and former mayor of the city, this newer concourse is the elevated one of the two. It is used for larger aircraft (such as the Boeing 737) because of its jet bridges. SB's outdoor escalator and walkway are shaded by a designer roofline similar to that of the Denver International Airport.\nThe older Regional Concourse on the south side, simply known as the Regional Concourse on the airport website, or \"Gates 12–20\" on airport signage, is at the tarmac level and hosts smaller aircraft. Boarding uses ramps or airstairs.\n\nState Route 111 (Gene Autry Trail) is accessible to PSP via Ramon Road.\n\nPSP is served by both municipal and regional routes. Sunline's \"SunBus\" route 24 provides direct service to downtown Palm Springs via the bus stops at El Cielo/Kirk Douglas and Tahquitz/Civic. Morongo Basin Transit Authority provides service to Twentynine Palms. An Amtrak Thruway bus stop is located just outside the baggage claim area, with service to Cabazon (Morongo Casino), Riverside, and Fullerton.\n\n\n\n"}

In 1974, Louroujina was secured so as to be placed within a contiguous Turkish Cypriot zone, which later became Northern Cyprus. The United Nations Buffer Zone separates the Louroujina salient from the area controlled by the Republic of Cyprus. There is now a tunnel which has been designed to enter the village without going through any army points. The village is now open to everyone there are many historic untouched buildings in this village. \n\nPrior to 1960, Louroujina's population was Turkish Cypriots and Greek Cypriots. The Turkish Cypriots constituted a majority. The Greek Cypriots, who numbered about 100, fled the village during the Emergency years. By 1973, 1,963 Turkish Cypriots were living in Louroujina. After the Turkish invasion, the majority were relocated in nearby villages; however, about 300 opted to stay, in contravention of the authorities' demand that they vacate the village. , Louroujina had a population of 390. \n\nAccording to legend, Louroujina is so named because it was founded by a woman named \"Lorenziya\". In 1958, it was renamed in Turkish, meaning \"raiders\". The new name is said to have been inspired by an inter-communal clash between Greek Cypriots and Louroujina Turkish Cypriots, who outnumbered the former, at Pyroi (Gaziler).

{"id": "2041716", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2041716", "title": "John Seigenthaler Pedestrian Bridge", "text": "John Seigenthaler Pedestrian Bridge\n\nThe John Seigenthaler Pedestrian Bridge (previously called the Shelby Street Bridge or Shelby Avenue Bridge) is a truss bridge that spans the Cumberland River in Nashville, Tennessee, United States. The bridge spans 960 m (3,150 ft) and is one of the longest pedestrian bridges in the world.\n\nThe John Seigenthaler Pedestrian Bridge was originally known as the Sparkman Street Bridge and was built one block south of Broadway, connecting Sparkman Street and Shelby Avenue. The bridge was constructed at a cost of about $475,000. Another bridge called the Jefferson Street Bridge which was virtually identical to it was built at the same time. The Jefferson Street Bridge was opened a year after the Sparkman Street Bridge. The substructures of the bridges were light grey concrete, and the superstructures were made of steel that had been painted black.\n\nThe bridge was the first in North America to have concrete arched trusses.\n\nThe bridge was designed and construction was supervised by Howard M. Jones, the chief office engineer of the Nashville, Chattanooga and St. Louis Railway. The original architectural drawings as approved by Jones are archived at the Metro Transportation Offices.\n\nAfter twenty-five years of use, it became apparent that there was something wrong with the concrete on the Sparkman Street Bridge. The worn surfaces of the concrete were chipped away between 1927 and 1930 and replaced with gunite.\n\nThirty years later, repair work had to be done again. The Standard Engineering Company of Albany, New York was hired to repair the weathered bridge. They subcontracted the steel work to the Nashville Bridge Company. During this repair time, the Jefferson Street Bridge was also repaired.\n\nIn 1998 the John Seigenthaler Pedestrian Bridge was admitted to the National Register of Historic Places, due mainly to the unique truss design. Both the John Seigenthaler Pedestrian Bridge and the Jefferson Street Bridge were considered. The Jefferson Street Bridge was rejected because of its similarity to the John Seigenthaler Pedestrian Bridge and the fact that the John Seigenthaler Pedestrian Bridge was in better condition. The Jefferson Street Bridge was demolished in 1990 to make way for a new bridge that could handle more traffic.\n\nState inspectors declared the bridge to be in \"poor\" condition in 1992, and the bridge was closed to vehicular traffic in 1998. The bridge was originally slated for demolition. However, due to aesthetic, architectural, and historical considerations, it was decided that it should be converted to a pedestrian bridge rather than be demolished. The success of the Walnut Street Bridge as a part of Chattanooga's urban renewal efforts was a major consideration in keeping the bridge. \n\nThe bridge was refurbished and includes an elevator, ramps, and stairways. The bridge has a center lane that is fifteen feet across to accommodate bicycles. Originally it was thought that a trolley might use the center lane, but that idea was abandoned in favor of a bicycle lane. On each side of the bicycle lane are elevated boardwalk-style sidewalks. The bridge includes four scenic pedestrian overlooks that, in the metal of the railing, have artistic renderings of the history of life on the Cumberland River. The bridge is dramatically lit at night.\n\nThe refurbished bridge is part of the Metro Nashville Greenway system, which is administered by the Parks Department. The eastern terminus includes a pedestrian plaza with special landscaping and is very close to Nissan Stadium. The western terminus comes out facing the Schermerhorn Symphony Center and is very close to the Country Music Hall of Fame, Music City Center, and Bridgestone Arena.\n\nThe refurbishment of the bridge cost in excess of $15 million and was done under the supervision and planning of the Tennessee Department of Transportation. A new bridge called the Gateway Bridge, now known as the Korean War Veterans Memorial Bridge, was built to handle the vehicle traffic that used to travel over the John Seigenthaler Pedestrian Bridge.\n\nDue to the bridge's iconic status as a Nashville landmark, it is often seen in country music videos. The video for \"Save a Horse (Ride a Cowboy)\", the first hit single by Big & Rich, was shot entirely on the Shelby Street Bridge. The video for Emerson Drive's 2007 hit single \"Moments\" was also filmed on and under the bridge. Several scenes from the 2011 video for \"Together You and I\" by Dolly Parton were filmed on the bridge.\n\nIn April 2014, the bridge was renamed the John Seigenthaler Pedestrian Bridge in honor of journalist and civil rights advocate John Seigenthaler. While reporting for \"The Tennessean\" in the 1950s, Seigenthaler once physically prevented a suicidal man from jumping off the bridge.\n\n\n"}

He was a staunch democrat and vehement opponent of the oligarchs; his sparring with Critias rated a mention in Aristotle's \"Rhetoric\".\n\nOn three separate occasions, he inspired the citizens of Athens to reject the Spartans' attempts to make peace; once after the Athenian victory at Cyzicus (410 BC), again after the Athenian victory at Arginusae (406 BC), and once again after the decisive Spartan naval victory at Aegospotami (405 BC). During Lysander's ensuing siege, the tide of opinion turned against the democrats, and the oligarchs used the opportunity to rid themselves of their rival. One of their members, Satyrus, brought a charge against Cleophon of neglect of military duty, leading to his arrest. Since it was by no means certain that Cleophon could be convicted of this, the commissioner for the publication of the Athenian laws, Nicomachus, was persuaded by bribery or partisanship to exhibit a \"law\" allowing the oligarch-dominated Boule to oversee Cleophon's trial by lot-chosen jury. The oligarchs used this assessorship () over the jurors to ensure the conviction of Cleophon and his death sentence.\n\nCleophon was made the object of satire by the comic poet Plato in an eponymous play (now lost), and by Aristophanes in \"The Frogs\". Both made fun of Cleophon's Thracian origins and accent: since his father is known to have been an Athenian citizen, his mother is conjectured to have been Thracian and Plato of his low Athenian birth (Andocides says that Cleophon was a harp-maker by trade, and Aelian comments on the poverty of his early life).\n"}

She discovered two forgotten manuscripts of this type in private collections, one of them being the Codex Zouche-Nuttall. She was one of the first to identify and recognise artefacts dating back to the pre-Aztec period.\n\nNuttall was born in San Francisco in 1857 to Irish father Dr. Robert Kennedy Nuttall and Mexican-American mother Magdalena Parrott. She married the French anthropologist Alphonse Louis Pinart in 1880 and had a child, but they divorced in 1888.\n\nShe was educated in France, Germany, and Italy, and at Bedford College, London. During Nuttall’s first trip to Mexico in 1884 with her family, she worked for the National Museum of Anthropology in Mexico City as an Honorary Professor of Archaeology. While visiting Teotihuacan that year, she collected terracotta heads from San Juan Teotihuacan. The pieces had been studied before but they had not been properly dated or understood. This was the foundation of the publication which would lead her into prominence, the \"Terra Cotta Heads of Teotihuacan\" for the American Journal of Archaeology (1886). Because of the success of this article, she was appointed Special Assistant of the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology at Harvard.\n\nFrederic Putnam, leading American anthropologist and curator of Peabody from 1875 to 1909, and German-American anthropologist Franz Boas saw her as an excellent mediator between Americanist circles in different countries because of her education and cosmopolitan relations. In his 1886 annual report for the museum, Putnam praised Nuttall as “familiar with the Nahuatl language, having intimate and influential friends among the Mexicans, and with an exceptional talent for linguistics and archaeology.” Her family background made of her a particularly ideal partner for relations with Mexico. This would play an important role in the creation of the institution of international cooperation Escuela Internacional de Arqueología y Etnología Americana.\n\nFrom 1886 to 1899 she followed her family to Europe and lived mainly in Dresden. In 1902 she moved to Mexico City in an eighteenth-century house called Quinta Rosalía, which was her main residence until her death. Her home, which she renamed Casa de Alvarado, became a meeting place for foreign Americanists, scientists and intellectuals. The large land she owned allowed her to develop her passion for gardening. She studied Mexican garden art, medicinal herbs, and undertook a collection of unknown local seeds in the United States, which she intended to introduce. She also participated in the introduction of taro cultivation in the state of Orizaba.\n\nNuttall had seen many archaeological artefacts in museums and visited several sites, but it was in 1910 that she made, with the agreement of the Mexican authorities, her first important excavations on Isla de Sacrificios, where she discovered the ruins of a site of human sacrifice. During this expedition, her supervisor, Salvador Batres, claimed the discovery himself. She resigned from her position at the National Museum of Anthropology and wrote \"The Island of Sacrificios\", published in 1910 in American Anthropologist. It was a detailed account of the site's discovery and excavation which prompted the Mexican government to have Batres replaced.\n\nNuttal was a member of several academic institutions, including the Harvard Peabody Museum and the National Museum of Anthropology in Mexico City and she carried out most of her activities without pay and on a fee-for-service basis. She did, however, have some patrons, including Phoebe Hearst, mother of William Hearst, founder of the Phoebe A. Hearst Museum of Anthropology in Berkeley, to which Nuttall donated many pieces.\n\nNuttall was also the basis for D.H. Lawrence's character Mrs. Norris in his novel The Plumed Serpent.\n\nNuttall investigated Mexico’s past to give recognition and pride to its present at a time where Western archaeology favoured salacious narratives of ancient Mesoamericans. In 1897, Nuttall published \"Ancient Mexican Superstitions\" in The Journal of American Folklore. In it, she criticised the representation of ancient Mexicans as “bloodthirsty savages, having nothing in common with civilised humanity”. “Such a hold upon the imagination that it effaces all other knowledge about the ancient civilisation of Mexico”, she wrote. She hoped her work would “lead to a growing recognition of the bonds of universal brotherhood which unite the present inhabitants of this great and ancient continent to their not unworthy predecessors.”\n\nOutside of her work in anthropology and archaeology, Nuttall, partnered with Phoebe Hearst, worked to educate and preserve the heritage of indigenous Mexicans. One of her students was Manuel Gamio, who would eventually become one of Mexico's most famous archaeologists.\n\nNear the end of her life, Nuttall advocated for the revival of Mexican traditions that had been eradicated by Spanish conquest. In 1928, she called for a renewed national celebration of the indigenous New Year, which was traditionally observed twice annually by numerous Mesoamerican cultures. That year, Mexico City celebrated the Aztec New Year for the first time since 1519.\n\nZelia Nuttall was sent to Russia in 1894 as a representative of the Penn Museum to attend the coronation of Czar Nicholas II and Czarina Alexandra. At the time, the Penn Museum wanted to establish exchanges with Russian museums, and to this end offered financial assistance to Russian archaeological excavations in exchange for a share of the discoveries. Sara Yorke Stevenson, a member of the Penn Museum’s Board of Managers and Curator of the Egyptian Section, chose Nuttall as the Museum’s representative because of Nuttall’s knowledge of Russian. The opportunity for Nuttall to travel to Russia opened when Phoebe Apperson Hearst, the mother of William Randolph Hearst, cancelled her trip to the coronation, and passed the opportunity to the Penn Museum, along with the funds to acquire a collection.\n\nWhen Nuttall was in Moscow to attend the coronation of Nicholas II, she set up several exchanges between Russian museums and the Penn Museum. In addition, she visited the Pan-Russian Industrial and Art Exhibition at Nizhny Novgorod (known as Gorky from 1932 to 1990), where she inspected numerous artifacts from regions as distant as Siberia, and collected more than 400 items from Russia, Finland, Poland, and Russian Turkestan. The artifacts included religious objects, musical instruments, pottery, color lithographs of the 1894 Russian coronation ceremony, and more. She also acquired a photograph collection illustrating customs of the Kyrgyz people from the vicinity of Tashkent and Samarkand.\n\nNuttall was known for her ability to find lost or forgotten manuscripts and bring them to the attention of scholars. \n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2041764", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2041764", "title": "Kleophon Painter", "text": "Kleophon Painter\n\nThe Kleophon Painter is the name given to an anonymous Athenian vase painter in the \"red figure\" style who flourished in the mid-to-late 5th century BCE. He is thus named because one of the works attributed to him bears an inscription in praise of a youth named \"Kleophon\". He appears to have been originally from the workshop of Polygnotos, and in turn to have taught the so-called \"Dinos Painter\". Three vases suggest a collaboration with the Achilles Painter, while a number of \"black figure\" works have also been attributed to him by some scholars.\n\nThe Kleophon Painter was known for his paintings of various Red Figure Attic vases during the fifth century BCE. The themes of his vases for the most part stick to a few specific genres, specifically, Greek mythology, domestic themes (including sacrifices and parades), and paintings of warriors. Of the vases that have been discovered, there are 104 domestic style vases, forty-three mythological vases, and twenty-four paintings about warriors. His vases can be found throughout the world. Even in the fifth century BCE he shipped vases as far as Italy and Spain according to the provenance that the vases have been found in. The majority of his vases are bigger vases, with only a few smaller ones. Most of his vases are kraters.\n\nThe Kleophon Painter had a pretty common style which makes his vases difficult to distinguish from other vases that were painted during the same time period. Many vases are classified as “in the manner of Kleophon P” or “compares to Kleophon P”. One painter that he was similar to was The Dinos Painter. The Dinos Painter also had a fairly general style which made him and Kleophon similar and hard to distinguish between. One of the ways to identify works by the Kleophon Painter is by the location of the vase combined with the attributes on the vase such as the theme, type of vase, patterns, and style of the characters on the vase, especially the eyes and chin. In the Kleophon Painter’s case, the eyes are usually a rounded off triangular shape and the chin is generally rounded off or even bulbous at times.\n\nThe Kleophon Painter was likely located in or around the city-state of Athens, as his work was mostly discovered there. Twenty-two of the Kleophon Painter’s vases are still located in Athens at either the Agora Museum or the National Archaeological Museum. \n\nThe characters he paints are almost always seen in the home. Other creations depict a warrior departing or returning home or mythologically themed works. These are harder to attribute to him because so many vase painters use mythology as a subject; however, The Kleophon Painter was fairly specific with what myths he painted, usually either Dionysus with his Maenads or Hephaistion. Dionysus is harder to determine because many kraters that were used to hold wine had paintings of Dionysus on them, and they were not always the work of the Kleophon Painter. Hephaistion is a less common subject to paint which makes those vases easier to pick out.\n\nThe Kleophon Painter painted mostly large vases, especially calyxes. Of the 180 known vases that he painted, sixty-nine were calyxes. He painted twenty-seven hydriai and nineteen pelikes. He painted twelve stamnoi and eleven amphoras. There are also seven loutrophoroi, five lekythoi, one pyxis and one cup discovered that have been determined to be the work of the Kleophon Painter.\n\nThe most common theme painted on the Kleophon Painter’s vases was a domestic or ritual theme. There are 104 known vases by the Kleophon Painter that have domestic or ritual themes to them. He painted the domestic theme on a variety of different styles of vases. He liked to paint ceremonies such as weddings and the Komos. The Komos was a ceremony in ancient Greece where most of the people involved would drink heavily and parade into the center of town. It is not known what the purpose of this ceremony was but historians theorize that it was either to celebrate a wedding or some kind of worship for the gods. If the painting was not a sacrifice, Komos or parade then it was probably just a regular domestic theme from ancient Greece. \n\nA great example of a domestic style vase is an Attic Red Figure hydria discovered in Delos, Greece, and currently located in the Mykonos Archaeological Museum. The date range for this work is between 450 and 400 BCE. It has few if any intricacies about it. It is a plain painting of two women facing each other. On the very top lip there is a tongue pattern that wraps all the way around the top of the hydria. There is a more intricate tongue pattern that wraps around the neck just above the shoulder of the hydria. Around the bottom there is a meander pattern interrupted with a cross pattern every fourth block. With the exception of these three patterns the Hydria is very basic. It shows two women standing facing each other with a mirror suspended in between them. The woman on the left (as you look at the hydria) is holding a box with her head bowed. She is wearing a hat and does not have hands that are visible. The woman on the right has her head bowed as well but not quite as far and is not wearing a hat. Both women’s faces are strikingly similar. The eyes are triangular in shape, which is a common feature in most of the Kleophon Painter’s works. Their noses are unnaturally triangular and their chins have a smooth curve. The woman on the right has a slightly more bulbous chin than the one on the left. Both women are wearing fairly basic robes that go all the way down to their feet. The robes have a few lines and folds in them but for the most part are plain. The only two things in the background are a mirror that seems to be hanging in midair (most likely to be presumed that it is hung on a wall) and a seat with a simple pattern on it.\n\nThe Kleophon Painter’s style of painting clothing is fairly consistent throughout a large portion of his works. \n\nAnother domestic painting that is attributed to the Kleophon Painter is a calyx krater with two youths preparing to sacrifice a bull, discovered in Spina, Italy, and currently located in Ferrara in the Museo Nazionale di Spina. The Italian location indicates that the Kleophon painter shipped his vases outside of Greece. The date range is 450 to 400 BCE. This is the same date range found on almost all of the Kleophon Painter’s works which means that he did not have anyone carry on his workshop after he died. The krater itself has a leaf pattern that circles the top lip. There is a meander pattern, interrupted by a cross every fourth block, that wraps around the bottom. Side A shows two young males leading a bull to an altar, presumably to be sacrificed. Both of these young males have on robes that stop just above their feet. The eyes, again, are triangular shaped on the youths, but much more circular on the bull. Side B shows the same two boys, but no bull. It can be assumed that the goal of painting the krater this way was to show that the bull had been sacrificed. The boys are standing at the same altar that they had led the bull to on Side A.\n\nThe second most common theme in the Kleophon Painter’s works is Greek mythology. He often painted the return of Hephaistos or depictions of Dionysus. Hephaistos was the god of metalworking. According to myth, he was cast out of Olympia by Zeus after he stood up against him in defense of his mother. He would end up on earth and is said to have made armor for Achilles that was so bright and obviously god-made that the Trojans fled instantly at the sight of it. Those who did not were mercilessly slain. Kleophon paints the return of Hephaistos quite a few times on pelikes, skyphoi and kraters.\n\nDionysus was the god of the grape harvest and wine. He is usually painted by the Kleophon Painter with his female followers called Maenads. They were known for getting extremely drunk and losing all inhibitions, often engaging in uncontrolled sexual behavior as well as hunting wild animals. Dionysus and the Maenads were usually painted on kraters by the Kleophon Painter, likely because the kraters were used for making wine. \n\nWhile the themes of Dionysus and Hephaistos are common in the Kleophon Painter’s works, one of the best examples of a mythological theme is a painting of Eos and Kephalos, in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. It is an Attic Red Figure vase dating from 430 to 420 BCE, attributed to the Kleophon Painter by John Beazley. The painting is black from the top of the neck down to the middle of the neck with a tongue pattern interrupting the black and red in the middle of the neck. Below the tongue pattern is a three flower pattern wrapped around the neck of the lekythos. The flower pattern extends from the tongue pattern at the thinnest part of the neck down to the top of the shoulder. It has one handle (black with red on the inside) that extends the length of the neck ending at the shoulder. Wrapped around the shoulder is a red meander pattern interrupted by a saltire pattern every fourth box. Underneath the shoulder is where the main decoration is located. It is a picture of the Titan Eos with her lover, Kephalos. Eos is, in Greek Mythology, the goddess of the dawn. Kephalos was her lover, she can be seen in other vase paintings holding Kephalos who is sometimes painted in the nude. In this painting, both figures are clothed. Eos is identified by her wings and flowing robes. Eos’ eyes are triangular and directed toward Kephalos. Kephalos’ eyes are slightly more circular but still triangular in appearance and face back toward Eos. Eos has many folds on her clothing which are rounded off at the bottom whereas Kleophon has almost no folds in his clothing. \n\nThe vase is symmetric all the way around the neck and top of the shoulder. The only discrepancy is that the handle is located right between side A and B. The vase changes from a symmetrical vase with nothing but patterns to a scene of Eos and Kleophon underneath the shoulder. On side A, Eos can be seen reaching out toward Kleophon. She is wearing long robes and has wings that are folded behind her. Side B shows Kleophon with an aggressive-looking stance facing Eos. He is wearing a hat and has shorter robes. He is wearing calf-high boots with heels that are a slightly darker red than the rest of his body. \n\nThe lekythos depicting Eos and Kephalos does an excellent job of showing the common trends in the style of painting in a majority of the Kleophon Painter’s works. The meander pattern interrupted every fourth block is a good indicator that this is a Kleophon painting. Most of his works include a meander pattern as well as a tongue pattern. The meander pattern is almost always interrupted every fourth block. The next thing to look at is the eyes on the figures in the painting. They usually come to a point furthest from the nose and may or may not be slightly rounded out. The background is very plain as it is with most of the Kleophon Painter’s vases and this vase is fairly large.\n\nThe third and final main theme found in the Kleophon Painter’s works is that of warriors. The warriors are usually shown leaving their families or coming home, rarely are they seen in battle. It seems that the Kleophon Painter liked to make paintings that would have had an upper-class female target market. This can be seen by the location that most of the vases were discovered in as well as the themes that he is known for painting. The only time warriors are seen is when they are around the home, either departing or returning. This indicates that the women in the house would have these vases around as reminders of their loved ones. \n\nAn excellent example of a painting of a departing warrior is found on attic red vase number 215168. This is a bell krater that was discovered in South Italy. It is currently located in the Antikensammlungen in Munich, Germany. The date range, as with almost all other Kleophon Painter vases, is 450 to 400 BCE. This krater was attributed by Beazley. The krater has a leaf pattern wrapped around the top of it with lines bordering the top and bottom of the pattern. There are tongue patterns wrapped around the part of the krater where the handle meets the krater at both connecting points on both handles. The rest of both handles are painted black. At the bottom of the krater there is a meander pattern interrupted every third block with a saltire pattern. This pattern is also bordered on both the top and bottom with a solid line. The scene on side A shows the warrior flanked by two other figures; an old man who appears to be handing the warrior his helmet, and a woman who is seen holding the warrior’s shield. The old man and the woman are both wearing robes while the warrior is depicted nude. The shield has a dot in the center with thirteen prongs coming out away from the dot and coming to a point at varying lengths within the shield itself. The warrior is wearing nothing but a headband and a sheath with his sword in it. His robe is draped over his left arm which is holding his spear. Side B shows three youths all wearing robes. The eyes, again, are all triangular in shape. The youth to the far right has his right hand up as if telling the other two youths to stop or slow down. He is facing to the left (as you look at the vase) while the other two are facing back at him. All three have very similar, almost identical faces. They all have on the same style robes and are wearing a thin headband covered somewhat by their hair.\n"}
{"id": "2041767", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2041767", "title": "Bak Mei", "text": "Bak Mei\n\nBak Mei () is said to have been one of the legendary Five Elders — survivors of the destruction of the Shaolin Monastery by the Qing dynasty (1644–1912) — who, according to some accounts, betrayed Shaolin to the imperial government. He shares his name with the South Chinese martial art attributed to him.\n\nBak Mei has been fictionalized in Hong Kong martial arts films such as \"Executioners from Shaolin\" (1977), \"Abbot of Shaolin\" (1979), and \"Clan of the White Lotus\" (1980). Bak Mei as a fictional character is better known in the West as Pai Mei, played by Gordon Liu in the Hollywood action film \"\" (2004).\n\nAccounts of the Five Elders are many and varied, with some versions identifying the traitor as Bak Mei and others as Ma Ning-Yee. In other versions, both elders betray Shaolin, sometimes along with Fung Do-Duk. Still others say that “Bak Mei” was actually a nickname for either Ma Ning-Yee or Fung Do-Duk.\n\nThe degree to which stories of the Five Elders are based on historical fact remains unverified. Their ubiquity and widespread popularity can be at at least partially attributed to Wuxia novels (such as \"Wan Nian Qing\"), as well as the mythology around anti-Qing organizations such as the Heaven and Earth Society, which were spreading rapidly through China in the early 19th century. Whether justified or not, Bak Mei's traitorous reputation led to animosity between practitioners of his namesake martial art and practitioners of martial arts identified with those whom he is accused of betraying.\n\nIn the accounts of some Bak Mei practitioners, their founder did not so much betray Shaolin as decline to join their rebellion against the Qing. Other accounts portray Bak Mei as having been banished from Shaolin Temple because he killed several of his fellow monks when he first began practicing his new fighting style. Some Bak Mei practitioners have interpreted this to prove that their founder's style was superior to that of the Shaolin disciples he allegedly killed.\n\nBak Mei played an important part in the downfall of Shaolin temples. Manchu conquered China in 1644. Before then, China had been ruled by the Ming Dynasty, which had been weakened by internal corruption and rebellion. The Manchu dynasty became known as the Qing Dynasty. As part of the Manchu campaign to pacify China, they attacked some Buddhist Shaolin Temples. The leader of the Shaolin Temple, Hong Mei (“Red Eyebrows”) died, leaving his legacy to Chi Thien Su, also known as Jee Sin, one of the five Great Kung Fu Masters. According to some stories another such master, Chu Long Tuyen, the monk who would later become Bak Mei, did not accept this. He believed the Ming had become corrupt and Chi Thien Su would still serve them; Bak Mei would rather serve the foreign Qing Dynasty. Then came the attack against the Shaolin Temple at Quanzhou in Fujian province in 1647. Some sources indicate that this temple was actually in Henan, or that the invading forces recruited help from Tibetan warriors in the attack.\nThe Five Elders survived, however, and soon Chi Thien Su would found a second Shaolin Temple at Nine Lotus Mountain, also in Fujian Province. The Five Kung Fu Masters survived the first destruction of the Shaolin Temple by Qing Imperial forces and sought shelter in another temple, Fujian Temple, but the other monks were massacred. After Bak Mei refused to provide his real name for fear of retribution (against his family and students - if they survived), the Abbott of the temple christened the monk “Bak Mei” - White Eyebrow. According to some stories, Bak Mei betrayed the Ming at this point, taking information about their plot against the Manchu to the Manchu Shunzhi Emperor, then returned with information about the Manchu attack plan to the Shaolin. After the temple was destroyed by the Manchu, Bak Mei left the temple to study Taoism. Bak Mei trained an anti-Imperial attack force but following capture of the force by the Imperials, was forced to teach and lead 50,000 Imperial troops in the second destruction of the Shaolin Temple at Henan to prevent those captured with him from being tortured and killed. There, Bak Mei slew the “invincible” Shaolin leader, Chi Thien Su, in single combat by breaking his neck. He claimed he did this to prevent the massacre of the monks in the temple by the troops who followed him.\nThe tale of Bak Mei's death comes in many forms - it is often claimed that he was poisoned, or slain (in a grand battle) by other martial artists. Bak Mei is often portrayed as a traitor, however, it is important to note that Bak Mei's actions are not always consistent with this. Bak Mei's actions were undertaken, even to the destruction of the temple, with the intention of preventing harm to those who had chosen to follow him. It is possible that if Bak Mei had not aided the Imperial forces, his followers would have been tortured to death.\n\nDuring the reign of the Kangxi Emperor (r. 1661–1722) in the Qing dynasty, the warriors of the Xilufan revolt were so feared that the two ministers the Kangxi Emperor ordered to end their attacks fled China rather than face either the mercilessness of the Xilu warriors or the displeasure of the emperor, both of which often involved beheading.\n\nIt was the 128 monks of the southern Shaolin temple who defeated the army of Xilu over three months in 1673 without suffering a single casualty. However, by doing so the monks had made enemies of those in the Qing army and Qing court who were embarrassed by how easily the Shaolin monks had succeeded where they had failed. Soon rumors began to spread about the threat posed by a power so great that it defeated the entire Xilu army with a force of only 128 monks. This campaign of innuendo was wasted on the Kangxi Emperor, who remained grateful to the monks, but the rumors had their intended effect on his successor, the Yongzheng Emperor (r. 1722–1735), who ordered the temple's destruction.\n\nIn 1723, on the sixth day of the first new moon of the lunar calendar, Qing forces launched a sneak attack on the southern Shaolin temple, which began by bombarding the largely wooden monastery with a relentless deluge of burning arrows. Between the surprise attack, the fire, and the overwhelming number of Qing soldiers, 110 out of the 128 monks were killed that day. The Great Shaolin Purge took 70 days as Qing forces hunted down the 18 survivors. The surviving warrior monks of Shaolin inflicted massive casualties on their Qing pursuers but, in the end, their numbers were too great. Soon only five remained:\n\nAfter two years of running and hiding from the Qing army, these fugitives of the cloth regrouped at Mount Emei in Sichuan Province. As one of the sacred mountains of China, Mount Emei was home to about 70 monasteries and temples where the five clerics could blend in easily.\n\nIt was decided that Bak Mei would infiltrate the Qing imperial court as a spy while the others travelled throughout China to establish an alliance of anti-Qing rebels. However, the more Bak Mei learned, the more he realized that his allies’ efforts would never be enough to overthrow the Qing, and so he left the rebellion, who took this as a betrayal, forcing Bak Mei on the run from those he was once on the run with. Almost all of the rebels who over the years sought to murder Bak Mei for his withdrawal from the struggle ended up dead at Bak Mei's hands, including Jee Sin and Miu Hin's son, Fong Sai-yuk, whom Bak Mei had known since Fong was a small boy. In other accounts, Fong Sai-yuk is not Miu Hin's son but his grandson.\n\nBoth these versions of the legend of Pai Mei come from inheritors of Bak Mei Kung Fu yet are very different from each other. Accounts of the Bak Mei and the Five Great Kung Fu Masters are many and varied.\nThe latter account names the Shaolin traitor as Ma Ning-Yee rather than Bak Mei, though that detail was omitted for reasons of length. In other versions, Bak Mei and Ma Ning-Yee both betray Shaolin, sometimes joined by Fung Do-Duk. Still other versions say that “Bak Mei” is a nickname for either Ma Ning-Yee or Fung Do-Duk. For that matter, the legend of Bak Mei may have no basis in historical fact at all, and come solely from wuxia novels like Wan Nian Qing. The legends are particularly confused because some temples were burned down repeatedly, including after the time of Bak Mei.\n\nBak Mei is characterized by its emphasis on powerful close range hand strikes. Within Bak Mei can be found the four principles of Fou (Float), Chum (Sink), Tun (Swallow), and Tou (Spit) common in the Southern Chinese martial arts like Ng Ying Kungfu (), and also found in Karate. Unique to Bak Mei is its classification of the following 6 powers: biu (thrusting), chum (sinking), tan (springing), fa (neutralizing), tung, and chuk. Bak Mei emphasizes the movements of the tiger. The traditions of Bak Mei Kung Fu trace its origins to Mount Emei, where Bak Mei is said to have transmitted the art to the Chan (Zen) master Gwong Wai, who transmitted the art to the Chan master Juk Faat Wan and the Taoist Fung Fo.\n\nThe Taoist Fung Fo in turn passed the art on to Lau Siu-Leung, who established the Futshan lineage of Bak Mei.\n\nCheung Lai-Chuen began his study of the martial arts at the age of 7 with the traditional Chinese medicine practitioner Shak Lim, who taught him the Vagrant style. Later, Cheung would learn from Li Mung, who taught Chueng his family style, and from the Lam Yiu-Kwai's older uncle. While he was studying martial arts with the Lam family, he became close friends with their son Lam Yiu-Kwai, with whom he had much in common. Lam would later become known for disseminating Dragon Kung Fu much as Cheung would later become known for disseminating Bak Mei. Both were born in Hu¨¬y¨¢ng (»Ýê–) County in the prefecture of Huizhou in Guangdong and a marriage between their families would eventually make them cousins. They both left Huizhou to build their futures in Guangzhou and did so by opening several schools together.\nAfter moving to Guangzhou, Cheung was defeated by the monk Lin Sang after which the monk referred Cheung to his own teacher master Juk Faat Wan, who taught Cheung the art of Bak Mei over the next two or three years.\nCheung had a background in Hakka Kuen, the martial arts of the Hakka people, from his study of the family style of Li Mung and the Vagrant style, which are both identified with the Hakka, as is Southern Praying Mantis (which Cheung is not known to have trained in). Because of this, Cheung's style of Bak Mei is associated with Hakka Kuen, but more strongly still with the Dragon style of Lam Yiu-Kwai¡ªwho is also said to have had a background in Hakka Kuen¡ªdue to the many years Cheung and Lam spent training together.\n\nIn 2012 an academic research was done on the historical origins of the style of Baimei Quan (Pak Mei Kuen or White Eyebrow Fist) and the validity of the monk Bai Mei, using the resources of US University Professors of Chinese and Buddhist Studies as well as Mr. Xiong Feng of the Emei Shan Museum, Sichuan, China.\n\nThe earliest reference to the monk Bai Mei as an actual person comes in the \"Wuxia\" novel called \"Wunnian Qing\" (A Thousand Years Green or Evergreen) as being one of the five ancestors who survived the sacking of the Shaolin Temple (circa 1727) by the Qing army. Yet there are many problems with this source, as follows;\n\nGuanghui means Vast Benevolence and is a typical Buddhist nomination for either a monk or a temple; indeed there are several temples throughout China that bear this name. Yet on searching through the surviving gazetteers for Mount Emei there is no mention of a monk named Guanghui. There is no material evidence to suggest that Guanghui came from Emei Shan; all we have is the oral tradition from Zhang Liquan (Cheung Lai Chuen) that his \"Shifu\", Zhu Fayun, came from a temple in Sichuan Province.\n\nZhu Fayun. \"Fa\", in the context of a monk's name, means Buddhist Teachings and \"Yun\" means Cloud. The Chinese character \"Zhu\" formed part of the ancient word \"Tianzhu\", meaning India.\nZhu Fayun is said to have been a Buddhist monk from Emei Shan in Sichuan Province on a pilgrimage to the Guangxiao (Bright Filial Monastery), in Guangzhou. This is entirely plausible as the Guangxiao monastery is one of the oldest temples in south China as well as being one of the most influential Buddhist shrines. During his stay in Guangxiao, Zhu Fayun committed to teach Zhang Liquan (Cheung Lai Chuen) the Baimei arts.\n\nZhang Liquan (1882-1964). It would seem that Zhang Liquan was essentially an honest man with respect to his martial arts. He learnt three different styles from three different masters prior to having met Zhu Fayun. He formally acknowledges each of his former Shifu by name and honors them by keeping at least one of their forms in the Pak Mei syllabus. At a later stage in his career, Zhang Liquan formulated several of his own forms, including \"Tuotiao Quan\" (Cantonese: Tit Til Kuen) and \"Simen Bagua\" (Cantonese: Say Mun Ba Gua) which he openly professed were his own works. It would appear contradictory to suggest that such a man, who has been totally honest about the origins of all that he has learnt, would deny the existence of one teacher, or indeed invent a fictional character to disguise his own works when he has already affirmed creating several of his own.\n\nAll the supplementary forms in the Pak Mei syllabus, whatever the original style, fall under the collective classification of \"Nan Quan\" (Southern Fist) or more precisely \"Dong Jiang Quan\" (East River Fist). A common denominator to all these forms is that they are divided into two parts; the second being a repetition of the first, performed in the opposite direction. They also have numerous stances and techniques in common and share similar terminology and methodology.\n\nMing China, which had been weakened by corruption and internal rebellion, was overtaken by the Manchu people in 1644. Hong Mei (\"Red Eyebrows\"), abbot of the Southern Shaolin Temple, died during this time and his position was passed onto Chi Thien Su, known by his Dharma name Jee Sin Sim See, \"Chan teacher Perfection\". Another master named Chu Long Tuyen did not accept this. He believed the Ming had become corrupt and would rather serve the Manchu Qing dynasty.\n\nIn 1647 Manchu forces attacked the Southern Shaolin Temple in Quanzhou, Fujian. Only five masters managed to escape, and since then became known as the Five Elders.\n\nChi Thien Su, one of the Five Elders, founded another temple at Nine Lotus Mountain in Fujian where the survivors sought shelter. Chu Long Tuyen refused to provide his real name for fear of retribution against his family and students, in case they survived. The abbot then christened him \"Bak Mei\" \"White Eyebrows\". According to some stories, Bak Mei betrayed the Ming by taking information about their plot against the invaders to the Shunzhi Emperor, then returned with information about the Manchu attack plan to the Shaolin. After the temple was destroyed, Bak Mei and Fong Toh Tak (creator of the Bak Fu Pai) left the temple on separate paths in order to study Taoism.\n\nBak Mei trained an anti-imperial attack force but, following capture of the force by the imperials, was forced to teach and lead 50,000 imperial troops in the second destruction of the Shaolin Temple to prevent those captured with him from being tortured and killed. There, Bak Mei slew the \"invincible\" Shaolin leader Jee Sin in single combat by breaking his neck. He claimed he did this to prevent the massacre of the monks in the temple by the troops who followed him.\n\nWhile he is often portrayed as a traitor, Bak Mei's actions were undertaken, including the destruction of the temple, with the intention of preventing harm to those who had chosen to follow him. It is possible that if Bak Mei had not aided the imperial forces, his followers would have been tortured to death.\n\nDuring the reign of the Kangxi Emperor (1662–1722), the warriors of the Xilufan rebellion were so feared that the two ministers whom Kangxi ordered to quell the revolt fled China rather than face the mercilessness of the Xilu warriors, which often involved beheading. In 1673, over a period of three months, the 128 monks of the southern Shaolin Temple defeated the Xilu army without suffering a single casualty. However, by doing so they had made enemies of some Qing officers who were embarrassed by how easily the Shaolin monks had succeeded where they had failed.\n\nRumors soon began to spread about the threat posed by a power so great that it defeated the entire Xilu army with a force of only 128 monks. This campaign of innuendo was wasted on the Kangxi Emperor, who remained grateful to the monks, but the rumors had their intended effect on his successor, the Yongzheng Emperor (1722–1735). He began his reign by plotting the temple's destruction and was said to have secretly recruited a band of renegade warrior monks from Tibet to carry out his plan.\n\nIn 1723, on the 6th day of the first new moon of the lunar calendar, a former Shaolin disciple named Ma Ning-Yee aided Qing forces to launch a sneak attack on the southern Shaolin Temple. They began the assault by bombarding the largely wooden monastery with a relentless deluge of burning arrows. Between the surprise attack, the fire, and the overwhelming number of Qing soldiers, 110 out of the 128 monks were killed that day. The Great Shaolin Purge took 70 days as Qing forces hunted down the 18 survivors. The surviving monks of Shaolin inflicted massive casualties on their Qing pursuers but, in the end, their numbers were too great.\n\nSoon only five remained. Their identities vary but they are generally accepted as the following:\n\nAfter two years of running and hiding from the Qing army, these fugitives of the cloth regrouped at Mount Emei in Sichuan Province.\nAs one of the sacred mountains of China, Mount Emei was home to about 70 monasteries and temples where the five clerics could blend in easily.\n\nIt was decided that Bak Mei would infiltrate the Qing court as a spy while the others travelled throughout China to establish an alliance of anti-Qing rebels. The more Bak Mei learned, the more he realized that his allies' efforts would never be enough to overthrow the Qing. He decided to give up on the rebellion, which was seen as a betrayal.\n\nBak Mei was eventually killed but accounts disagree on whether he was poisoned or slain. Over the years, the rebels sought to punish Bak Mei for his defection. Almost all who made an attempt on his life ended up dead at Bak Mei's hands. This included Jee Sin and Miu Hin's son Fong Sai Yuk (Miu Hin's grandson according to other sources) whom Bak Mei had known since Sai Yuk was a small boy. Some say he was finally killed by the combined effort of Hoong Man Ting and Wu Ah Phiew who employed the Crane Style and the Tiger Style to avenge the burning of the Shaolin Temple and the death of their sigung (teacher's teacher), the Venerable Jee Sin, the Abbott whom Pak Mei is said to have killed in a duel during the burning of the temple.\n\nThe Bak Mei Pai traces its origins to Mount Emei, where Bak Mei is said to have transmitted the art to the Chan (Zen) master Gwong Wai who then passed it on to Juk Faat Wan.\n\nBak Mei's fighting style makes use of the four principles of \"floating\" (\"fou\"), \"sinking\" (\"chum\"), \"swallowing\" (\"tun\") and \"spitting\" (\"tou\") common in the southern Chinese martial arts. It is characterized by its emphasis on powerful close range hand strikes. Bak Mei strikes are usually executed in conjunction with intercepting and jamming the opponent's strike. Unique to Bak Mei, is its classification of the following 6 neijin (powers): \"biu\" (thrusting), \"chum\" (sinking), \"tan\" (springing), \"fa\" (neutralizing), \"tung\", and \"chuk\". Bak-Mei can produce effects on the nervous system that benefit the practitioner if taught correctly. Bak-Mei emphasizes the techniques of Leopard Kung Fu and its strikes are executed with fluidity and power via Fa jin. Additionally, it contains numerous Dim-Mak applications. These applications are comparable with anatomy focused arts such as tuite and chin-nah. Some of these applications involve throwing, takedowns, and restraining techniques.\nAccording to the Fatsan family tree, Pak Mei passed the art to Kwong Wai, Chuk Yun, Fung Fo Dao Yan, Lau Siu-Leung () who established the Fatsan lineage of Bak Mei. (source: Barbary Jonathan)\nJeung Lai Chuen began his study of the martial arts at the age of 7 with the Classical Chinese Medicine practitioner Sek Lam, who taught him the vagrant style. Jeung would later learn Li Style from Li Mung, (founded by Li Yi李義) who taught Jeung his family style. While he was studying martial arts with the Lam family, he became close friends with their son Lam Yiu Gwai, with whom he had much in common, and eventually studied under Yiu Gwai's uncle. Lam would later become known for disseminating Dragon Kung Fu much as Jeung would later become known for disseminating Bak Mei. Both were born in Huìyáng County () in the Huizhou prefecture of Guangdong and a marriage between their families would eventually make them cousins.\nThey both left Huizhou to build their futures in Guangzhou and did so by opening several schools together.\n\nAfter moving to Guangzhou, Jeung was defeated by the monk Lin Sang after which the monk referred Jeung to his own teacher Juk Faat Wan, who taught Jeung the art of Bak Mei over the next two or three years. Jeung had a background in the martial arts of the Hakka people, from his study of Li Mung's family style and the vagrant style. Because of this, Jeung's style of Bak Mei is associated the dragon style of Lam Yiu Gwai due to the many years Jeung and Lam spent training together.\n\nBak Mei Forms: This is an example of a form curriculum.\n\n"}

In the , Biggenden had a population of 845 people.\n\nBiggenden is on the Isis Highway north-west of the state capital Brisbane, and west of Maryborough.\n\nThe name is derived from the Kabi word \"bigindhan\" meaning a \"place of stringybark\".\n\nBiggenden was founded in 1889 as a service centre to the short-lived goldrush towns of Paradise and Shamrock; and for coach passengers travelling west from Maryborough. The township, including the intriguingly named \"Live And Let Live Inn\", moved to a new location alongside the railway station when the rail line arrived in 1891. Biggenden Post Office opened on 16 May 1891.\n\nBiggenden Provisional school opened on 9 May 1892 becoming Biggenden State School in 1900. In January 1953, the school experimented with offering high school subjects by correspondence. In 1958, a secondary school section was added.\n\nIn October 1928, the Biggenden branch of the Queensland Country Women's Association rooms were officially opened by J.C. Robertson, chairman of the Degilbo Shire Council.\n\nAt the 2011 census, Biggenden had a population of 682 people.\n\nPrimary production is the most significant industry in the Shire with beef and dairy cattle being predominant. Other agricultural pursuits include grain crops, piggeries, peanuts, citrus and timber. The area is also rich in minerals. Biggenden Mine is located eight kilometres out of town off Ban Ban Springs Road. Gold, bismuth and more recently magnetite have been extracted from the mine. The township is also close to Coalstoun Lakes National Park and Mount Walsh National Park.\n\nIn November 2005, the Queensland Government opened the Paradise Dam, about 30 minutes north-west of Biggenden, on the Burnett River. The 300,000ML dam, which submerges the former gold mining town of the same name, is touted as securing the future of the nearby Bundaberg and Childers region, although no water will be available for residents of the Biggenden area. However, more than 400 jobs were created during its construction and the dam site is proving to be one of the shire's largest tourist attraction. Artefacts and buildings removed from Paradise before the dam wall was built are now on display by the Biggenden Historical Society.\n\nBiggenden has a public library, swimming pool, bowling and golf club, memorial hall and showground. The North Burnett Regional Council operates the Biggenden Library, located at 47 Edward Street, Biggenden.\n\nThe Biggenden branch of the Queensland Country Women's Association meets at the CWA Hall at 32 Edward Street.\n\nBiggenden State School is a government primary and secondary (Prep-10) school for boys and girls at Frederick Street (). In 2017, the school had an enrolment of 143 students with 18 teachers (16 full-time equivalent) and 12 non-teaching staff (8 full-time equivalent).\n\nBiggenden has a number of heritage-listed sites:\n\n\n"}

These dusters were typically slit up the back to hip level for ease of wear on horseback. Dusters intended for riding may have features such as a buttonable rear slit and leg straps to hold the flaps in place. For better protection against rain, dusters were made from oilcloth and later from waxed cotton. Dusters were the recommended \"uniform\" for Texas Rangers.\nIn the late 19th and early 20th centuries, both men and women wore dusters to protect their clothes when riding in open motorcars on the dirt roads of the day.\n\nWestern horsemen's dusters figured little in Western films until Sergio Leone re-introduced them in his movies \"The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly\" (1966) and \"Once Upon a Time in the West\" (1968). The latter played for many months in Paris and was in part credited with a revival of the duster in men's fashions in that city. Similarly, in the film genre of heroic bloodshed, primarily through Chow Yun Fat and John Woo, the hero is often seen wearing a duster. That is also true of the fictional anti-hero Omar Little, who wears dusters both as outerwear and as a silk sleepwear coverup in the HBO series, \"The Wire\".\n\nDusters gained renewed popularity in the late 20th century and are now a standard item of Western wear. \nThe Tenth Doctor played by David Tennant wore a cinnamon brown duster coat on Doctor Who.\nVan Pelt, the main enemy on wore a dark brown duster coat.\n\nIn modern times, leather dusters are worn by motorcyclists to prevent road rash.\n\n"}

{"id": "2041826", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2041826", "title": "Fairfield railway station, Sydney", "text": "Fairfield railway station, Sydney\n\nThe Fairfield railway station is a heritage-listed railway station located on the Old Main South line, serving the Sydney suburb of Fairfield. It is served by Sydney Trains T2 Inner West & Leppington and T5 Cumberland line services. It was designed and built by NSW Government Railways from 1856 to 1891. It is also known as Fairfield Railway Station group. The property is owned by RailCorp, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.\n\nAfter completion of the initial rail line from Sydney to Parramatta, work soon proceeded on the Main South line from Granville Junction to Goulburn. The first section from Granville to Liverpool was constructed quickly over easy terrain and was opened on 26 September 1856. Fairfield was opened with this section and was the only intermediate station at that time. Campbelltown was reached in 1858, that section opening on 17 May 1858. The line was duplicated in 1891. This line was constructed as a rural railway and had no suburban purpose until well into the twentieth century. Its stations served what were then rural settlements and only later were adapted as commuter stations. In 1924, the Main South line was diverted onto a more direct route via Regents Park. The existing line through Fairfield was renamed the \"Old Main South\" \"Line.\"\n\nThe present Down (east) platform is the original and the station master's residence built in 1856 (at the north end) is the oldest building still in existence in the NSW railways system and probably Australia. It was built a year after the railway opened to Parramatta. The second building built (1860) shows a change in attitude towards railway construction under John Whitton with an emphasis on passenger traffic and is one of a group of six buildings from that period with Branxton, Parramatta, St Mary's, Penrith and Picton. The third building represents a standard duplication building of the 1890s including a sympathetic extension in the 1930s, and again shows changes in railway use and design. The footbridge dating from 1918 ties the group together and is a good example of the style associated with a good group of buildings.\n\nThe points to the north of the station can be used to terminate southbound trains on platform 2 during trackwork or if there is an incident on the line. As this is a fairly rare occurrence, the signals around Fairfield are all automatic double colour light signals. Track circuits are used to determine the location of trains and automatically set signals appropriately. Both Sydenham and Granville signal boxes can monitor the status of trains in this area, but cannot control signals or points. If trains need to terminate, a local signal box on platform 1 can be used to control the points and signals.\n\nThe complex comprises a former type 1 Office/Station Master's Residence, located on Platform 2, erected in 1856; a type 4 platform building, located on Platform 1, erected ; and a type 3 platform building, located on Platform 2, erected . Other structures include a footbridge, erected in 1918 and revised in ; platforms 1 and 2, completed and respectively; canopies, completed in 1990 and 1999; the Vine Street Footbridge, completed in 1965; and the jib crane, with an unknown completion date.\n\nFairfield Railway Station is accessed from The Crescent to the north. The Bus Interchange stands in front of the station between The Crescent and the station buildings. At some stage pre-1990 a covered shopping arcade was constructed immediately to the north-west of the station. The station is also accessed from the south from Dale Street. Flanking the station on both sides to the south are car parking areas. Across Dale Street is the Fairfield RSL complex.\n\nExternal: Brick building, dating from 1856, originating as a square plan form with a gable roof. The roof has timber bargeboards and finials and the two original chimneys remain with corbel detailing to the top. The corrugated metal roofing material and guttering has been recently replaced. In the 1930s the building was extended in brick (along the platform to the west) to include two extra rooms and there is a further corrugated metal sheet clad extension to the west for a laundry. The detailing of the windows to these extensions is inappropriate in the context of the 1856 building. The concave veranda awning which flanks the building on the north and east elevations has recently been painted in a striped colour scheme (post 1980s). This awning is a timber framed structure supported on the original timber posts and beams. There are original framing members as well; and some of the purlins are bowing in the centre. To the rear of the building, the veranda to the original building is enclosed by brick walls to either end. The awnings to the rear have shallow pitched roofs, and the entire extent of the western additions, and a section to the original building, have now been enclosed to become interior spaces. There is also an intrusive timber trellis across the open part of the veranda at the eastern end of the building. The open veranda has a timber deck. A covered area, which is fenced off to the platform, links this building and the platform building. The building remained in use as a residence until the 1970s.\n\nAlterations to the 1856 building include: corrugated metal sheet clad extension to the west for a laundry; enclosing of the south-west veranda and improved sanitary facilities in 1941; a full height picket fence in front of the veranda posts to the platform elevation, enclosing of rear veranda to 1856 building; security doors and window bars installed; air-conditioning units fixed through original windows. The building has recently been repainted.\n\nExternal: The original building took the form of a rectangular brick building, with a rendered plinth, with three rooms (booking office, general waiting room and ladies waiting room), with a relatively steep gable roof which features decorative timber bargeboards and finials and has small ventilation openings; this section of the building was linked to a further room (originally the men's toilet) to the western end which was orientated 90 degrees to the rest of the building, and maintains the same detailing, but has a raised ridge vent. The link (which housed the ladies toilets) also originally had a gable roof, but with a much lower ridge height, giving the sense of it being a deferential element. The original chimneys to the eastern section of the building still remain intact.\n\nThe windows are mostly the original timber framed sash windows with segmental arch heads with rendered detailing, and rendered and painted window sills resting on cement bracket mouldings. The extensions to the building follow the same detail, but with a simpler sill detail. Modifications such as Perspex secondary glazing and air-conditioning units and standard ticket windows have been installed within the original openings. One opening on the north elevation has been bricked up and there are some \"blind\" openings to the entrance way and to the western building on the north elevation. Some of the windows have been reglazed with wire mesh glass. The doors are mostly new, either solid or panelled, and there are security flyscreen doors fitted to the station master's office. A door way opening on the western elevation of the building (opposite the stair) has been bricked up. The building and all the awnings and canopies, have all been recently re-roofed with corrugated steel and new guttering. The building has been recently repainted.\n\nThe main part of the building, to the east, has a typical shallow pitched awning supported on cast iron columns, with Corinthian capitals and decorative cast iron brackets. The awning had a timber boarded valance to the east and west ends and a timber fascia to the platform edge. A new addition to accommodate a parcels office and signal room was constructed to the eastern end of the building. This addition had sensitive detailing and reused displaced elements of the original building such as the finial to the gable. This addition significantly altered the original roof structure. Documentary evidence shows that the parcels office addition also had a cantilevered awning over the platform, constructed in steel sections, which was replaced as a part of the 1990s works with a steel framed canopy supported on modern steel posts, the design of which is based on the 1890s original awning. This 1990s canopy structure extended around the entire platform building, except where the original awning remains and is described further on. The 1990s upgrade also saw major changes to the building form, by the removal of the link building, which was replaced with an open area with brick arched openings, with head details to match the original doors and windows. The other major alteration at this time was the large openings to the north and west elevation of the parcels office (to the Crescent) and the installation of new aluminium framed doors and windows, in order that the space could be used as a travel centre. More recently as part of the access upgrade an accessible toilet (from the platform) and new staff toilet was constructed in the south-east corner of the former parcels office.\n\nInternal: The building has been modified internally over time to suit changing operational requirements; however a good degree of original fabric remains intact, particularly in what is now the booking office, which features pressed metal ceilings with ceiling roses and original cornices, and chimney breast with staff mould detailing. The doors and window architraves are mostly intact, and some of the windows with security bars to the inside. Standard ticket windows have been installed in the booking office. The former signal box room is now used as a CCTV monitoring room and is fitted out accordingly. To the eastern end there are new partition walls which are a remnant of the works to the former parcels office and new walls to the accessible toilet and new staff toilet. The parcels office and former travel centre are currently used for storage.\n\nExternal: A rectangular form brick building with a hipped roof form. The corrugated metal roofing material and guttering has been recently replaced. The original eaves fascia remains with new guttering and rainwater goods. The two original chimneys remain with corbel detailing to the top. The windows typically are double hung timber sashes with rendered lintels and sills. The doors are original timber panelled doors with bolection mouldings and have arched brick heads.\n\nThe original building consisted of 3 rooms with a small toilet annex, with a flat roof, to the south-west corner. At some stage (between 1916 and 1931 according to documentary evidence) the building was extended with a flat roof structure to the west. This space is currently used as the booking office. Also added to the south was a lean-to workshop, which is a timber framed structure clad in weatherboards. The date of this extension is not known but this section of the building has detailing which is contemporary to construction dating from 1930-1950. The windows have security bars fitted to all the windows and doors along the southern elevation.\n\nA new concourse building, constructed in brick with a hipped roof to match the existing roof profile, was built to the west of the original building c.1990; this structure provides a covered entrance to the station (and ticket window) from this side. This building has a mini-orb ceiling and a paved ground surface.\nThe 1860s building has a timber framed awning to the platform elevation. The awning is supported by timber posts (recently replaced) with a shallow roof pitch, the soffit is the underside of the corrugated steel roofing which is supported on intermediate purlins. The building has recently been repainted.\n\nInternal: The current booking office has a modern fitout, including standard ticket window installation.\nThe buildings also includes a former ladies room (western end) and a kitchen fitout with new floor coverings, ceilings and cornices. There are original windows and doors with original architraves. There are toilet and washroom facilities in the annex to the south which have a modern fitout. There is a heater fixture installed with the modified fireplace opening.\n\nThe central room has original timber floors and plaster walls with staff mouldings on either side of the chimney breast. The ceiling has been replaced and there are no cornices. There are numerous services and conduits fixed to the walls. This room is used for storage. The former parcels & booking office (eastern end) has original timber floors and plaster walls with staff mouldings on either side of the chimney breast and new skirtings. The ceiling has been replaced. There are original windows and doors with original architraves. There is a new partition wall which contains electrical equipment. This room is used for storage. The lean to at the back has fibre cement sheeting to the walls and ceilings with timber floors and the original doors and windows intact. This room is also used for storage.\n\nThe original 1918 footbridge still remains. The footbridge is a riveted steel \"Warren Truss\" footbridge, which features angle iron trestles and channel iron stair stringers with compressed fibre cement decking. The footbridge was covered as part of a station upgrade c.1990. The surface of the footbridge was replaced recently with a tiled finish and the sides have been enclosed with frameless glass panels. The treads to the stairs have been replaced with precast concrete and a new tubular stainless steel handrail has been installed. The original iron risers are still visible.\n\nThe 2003 access upgrade included the installation of lift enclosures on both platforms which are located to the west of the footbridge and connected by a simple link.\n\nPlatform 1 (Up) is a wayside platform and is concrete faced with an asphalt surface; Platform 2 (Down) is a wayside platform and is brick faced with an asphalt surface. The surface to both platforms was recently replaced as part of the 2003 access upgrade project. Tactile ground surface indicators run along the edge of the platforms and at the foot of the ramps and stairs.\n\nPlatform 1: New canopy structures (c.1990) with transverse gable (with timber trellis detail) facing the platform. A steel skillion (1999) roofed canopy also covers the ramp access to the western end. A new canopy (c.1990) to the eastern end (in front of the Parcel Office extension) is constructed in steel to a detail loosely based on the existing awning to the heritage building.\n\nPlatform 2: New canopy structure (c.1990) abutting existing awning with timber framing supported on timber posts with transverse gable (with timber trellis detail) facing the platform. All the canopies are clad in corrugated steel. The canopy cover continues up and over the stair and footbridge, with similar gable detailing to landings and to the north and south elevation of the footbridge.\n\nThe Crescent Entrance: New canopy structure (c.1990) abutting existing awning with timber framing supported on timber posts with transverse gable (with timber trellis detail) facing the street. The canopy cover continues up and over the stairs and footbridge, and returns along the platform edge. All the canopies are clad in corrugated steel.\n\nThere is also a hipped roof shelter in front of the booking office and several canopies, to the same detail as above, over the waiting areas of the bus interchange.\n\nDale Street Entrance: New canopy structure supported on steel posts and timber roof framing and corrugated steel to the roof. The canopy has a gable detail to match 1990s structures. A steel skillion (1999) roofed canopy also covers the ramp access to the western end.\n\nSimple structure constructed from standard steel sections on concrete foundations with a precast concrete deck and steel balustrade. The footbridge appears to be unchanged based on original documentation.\n\nExisting documentation shows a goods shed (no longer extant) located to the north of the station with a single track located adjacent to where the present crane is located. This is a standard 2 tonne iron jib crane built by the Morris Brothers in Sydney. The crane, which sits on a brick and tile base, is no longer used but remains as an ornamental element set within a garden bed.\n\nBased on the surviving documentation and the evidence on site it is unlikely there would be any potential archaeological remains at Fairfield Railway Station.\n\nThe former office/Station Master's residence building on Platform 2, despite some inappropriate additions and modifications, is in good condition (based on external analysis), and as the oldest surviving station building in NSW, has a high level of integrity. The 1880s platform building is relatively intact and despite additions and refurbishment, as well as operational changes, is representative of its historic form and has a high level of integrity. The 1860s platform building is very intact and despite additions and refurbishment, as well as operational changes, is representative of its historic form and has a high level of integrity. The introduction of the canopies over the stairs and the footbridge, and the construction of the lift enclosures have decreased the integrity of the 1918 structure. The condition of the fabric and the addition of these contemporary structures mean that the stairs and footbridge have reduced integrity. The platforms have been extended since they were originally constructed, and the surface has been replaced. The Vine Street footbridge is in its original condition and despite its being a later structure, as it is intact maintains a moderate level of integrity. The jib crane is not in use, but the fabric is in good condition. The crane has a high level of integrity despite losing some of its context with the removal of the goods yard.\n\n\nAll buses depart from the Fairfield Interchange.\n\nTransit Systems Sydney:\n\nTransdev NSW:\n\nFairfield station is served by two NightRide routes:\n\nAs at 25 October 2010, Fairfield Railway Station has State significance as one of the earliest railway stations established during the first phase of NSW railway construction in the 1850s. Opened in 1856 the station was one of only two stations at the time of line construction, the other being Liverpool, on the section of the Main South Line constructed between Granville and Liverpool. It is also historically significant as the existing 1850s former station master's residence is the oldest surviving railway building in NSW and possibly Australia. The building is also rare within the Sydney Metropolitan area being one of only three known examples and, along with the 1860s and 1890s platform building, it is able to demonstrate the development of the railways from its early phase of operations through to the 1890s duplications of the lines. The various changes to the station demonstrate its evolution from a rural railway station to a suburban service and reflect the growth and change of the local area. The 1918 footbridge is a common type of structure found at suburban railway stations and together with the platform buildings and former station master's residence it forms a recognisable landmark in the local area.\n\nFairfield railway station was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria.\n\nThe place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales.\n\nFairfield Railway Station is historically significant at the state level as one of the earliest railway stations established during the first phase of NSW railway construction in the 1850s. Opened in 1856 the station was one of only two stations, the other being Liverpool, on the section of the Main South Line constructed between Granville and Liverpool.\n\nThe station is also historically significant at the state level as the existing 1850s former station master's residence is the oldest surviving station building in NSW and possibly Australia and along with the 1860s \"Second Class Station Building\" and the 1890s \"Third Class Station Building\" it is able to demonstrate the development of the railways from its early phase of operations through the 1890s duplications of the lines. The various changes to the station demonstrate its evolution from a rural railway station to a suburban service and reflect the growth and change of the local area.\n\nThe place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales.\n\nFairfield Railway Station Group has State significance with its 1850s combined residence/office building which along with sympathetic additions to its west retains characteristic features of this type of station building namely gabled roof, the two rooms width of the original residence section of the building and veranda awnings supported by timber posts. The '1860s \"Second Class Station Building\" despite extensions to its south and west retains typical features, namely the original symmetrical section of the building and its hipped roof with chimneys. Similarly the 1890s \"Third Class Station Building\" despite additions and alterations has most of its architectural features and details intact including the varied roof forms, the awning supported on original cast iron posts with Corinthian capitals and decorative cast iron brackets. The footbridge with stairs leading down the platforms, has been recently covered and its surfaces recently tiled. However its superstructure, consisting of a riveted steel \"Warren Truss\" with angle iron trestles and channel iron stair stringers and compressed fibre cement decking, is original 1910s fabric and is typical of such footbridges within the suburban network. The station with its platform buildings, station building and footbridge collectively forms a recognisable landmark in the local area.\n\nThe place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons.\n\nThe place has the potential to contribute to the local community's sense of place and can provide a connection to the local community's history.\n\nThe place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.\n\nThe combined residence/office building is a relatively rare railway structure, with only three extant examples in the metropolitan network, the other two being at Riverstone and Emu Plains.\n\nThe place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales.\n\nThe Second Class platform building at Fairfield Railway Station has been altered considerably in terms of extensions to its south and west and new fitouts to its interiors but as it retains considerable amount of original fabric internally and externally and it has characteristic features of its this type of building and is a representative example. The \"Third Class\" platform building at Fairfield Railway Station, despite alterations and the additions has remained largely intact externally and is therefore representative of this class of railway buildings. Although the footbridge has been altered it retains the characteristic superstructure of footbridges and is representative of standard footbridge design.\n\n"}

It is named after the Senegalese physicist, historian and anthropologist Cheikh Anta Diop and has an enrollment of over 60,000.\n\nCheikh Anta Diop University predates Senegalese independence and grew out of several French institutions set up by the colonial administration. In 1918, the French created the \"école africaine de médecine\" (African medical school), mostly to serve white and Métis students but also open to the small educated elite of the four free towns of Senegal with nominal French citizenship. In 1936, under the Popular Front government in France, Dakar became home to the Institut Fondamental d'Afrique Noire (IFAN), an institute for the study of African culture.\n\nIn 1950s, with decolonisation already looming, the French administration expanded these schools, added science faculties, and combined the schools into the \"Institut des Hautes Etudes de Dakar\". In 1957, a new campus was constructed as the 18th French Public University, attached to the University of Paris and the University of Bordeaux. This became the University of Dakar the largest and most prestigious university in French West Africa. In 1987, its name was changed to honor the Senegalese philosopher and anthropologist, Cheikh Anta Diop.\n\nAt independence in 1960, enrollment was 1,018 students, only 39% Senegalese, with most of the rest from other former French colonies. By 1976, this number grew to 8,014.\n\nIn the 1970s, a time of state financial crisis, funding to higher education was cut, and international agencies stepped in over the next decade. Most of this funding, though, went to meet the needs of primary schools. In the 1990s and 2000s there was a huge boom in Senegalese primary and secondary education, much of it funded through international projects. In 1984 around 50% of Senegalese children received primary education and by 2004 more than 90% did.\n\nIn the mid-1980s around 20% of World Bank funding to Senegalese education went to higher education, but this figure dropped to 7% by the mid-1990s. With these projects came severe World Bank restrictions, dramatically cutting domestic funding available to university programs. As students who have benefited from primary and secondary education age, Cheikh Anta Diop University has had its already stretched resources stretched further. Nine thousand Senegalese students received a Baccalaureate degree in 2000, while total registration shot above 40,000, for a campus built with only 5,000 dorm rooms.\n\nDespite these pressures Cheikh Anta Diop University maintains a reputation as one of Africa's most prestigious institutions. Most of the post-independence generation of Senegalese leaders are graduates of the university, and its alumni teach in universities around the world.\n\nThe education system follows the French pattern, with oral and/or written final exams administered at the end of the year. All courses at the university are taught in French, except those in language departments other than French.\n\nUCAD offers courses of study in Humanities, Sciences, Engineering, Medicine, Finance, Accounting, and Law. The university awards the following degrees: B.A., B.S., Ph.D., and D.M.A.\n\nThe School of Medicine includes departments of Pharmacy, Research, and Surgery. The university also encompasses the Institute of Sciences of the Environment (ISE) and the Institute of Sciences of Earth (ISE).\n\nThe Institut Fondamental d'Afrique Noire (IFAN), founded in 1936, remains one of the world centers of African Studies. The IFAN Museum of African Arts' \"Musée d'Art africain\", attached to IFAN, displays and conserves a world-renowned collection of African arts.\n\nThe Centre de linguistique appliquée de Dakar (Center of Applied Linguistics of Dakar) at CADU is the regulatory body for the Wolof language.\n\nLanguage studies are divided into the following disciplines: Philosophy, Sociology, History, Geography, Letters, Arabic, Russian, Languages and Civilizations, English, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, Latin, German and Linguistics.\n\nThe university oversees a language school: Institut de Français pour Etrangers (IFE). The IFE specializes in French language studies aimed at foreign students in preparation for regular courses taught in French.\n\nUCAD hosts a number of foreign study abroad programs, including ones administered by Wells College, Indiana University, and the University of Oregon in the United States and numerous European universities. Participants in the program typically take a required course in Introductory Wolof and a French language (if applicable) course through the IFE in addition to regular university courses taught in French.\n\nA division of the university offers courses for foreign students in Senegalese and African studies, including African literature, history, politics, philosophy, and sociology.\nCADU is a member of the Federation of the Universities of the Islamic World.\n\nFor foreign students, UCAD requires a minimum age of 18 to enroll in studies in Pharmacy and a minimum age of 22 to enroll in studies relating to oral surgery.\n\nUCAD has a diverse student body drawn from many countries including Senegal, Chad, Burkina-Faso, Ivory Coast, France, Togo, Benin, Nigeria, the United States, Mauritania, Mali, Morocco, Rwanda, Cameroon, Belgium, and the United Kingdom.\n\nAs with a number of other African universities, UCAD occasionally experiences student strikes protesting government or university policies, most notable of which occurred during the 1993 presidential election.\n\nWith over 60,000 students and only 5,000 dormitory rooms, most students from outside Dakar must look for other accommodations. Many students live in the Cité Aline Sitoe Diatta, near the university campus, and those who can't afford Dakar's often high rents often share rooms.\n\nThe university has had a number of notable incidents of violence. A Senegalese LGBT organization noted in 2016 that ten cases of homophobic mob violence had occurred at the university since 2012. One of these, following a riot at the university, resulted in the death of the student who was suspected to be gay. The riot followed an attempt to apprehend the student, who had sought refuge in the university's bank and security office. Separately, self-immolations and clashes between students and police have been reported after students unsuccessfully demanded scholarships or challenged grading schemes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

In addition to the main campus in Downtown Austin, McCombs offers classes outside Central Texas in Dallas, Houston and internationally in Mexico City. The McCombs School of Business offers undergraduate, master's, and doctoral programs for their average 13,000 students each year, adding to its 98,648 member alumni base from a variety of business fields. In addition to traditional classroom degree programs, McCombs is home to 14 collaborative research centers, the international business plan competition: Venture Labs Investment Competition (formerly known as \"MOOT Corp\"), and executive education programs.\n\nMcCombs is also the oldest public business school in Texas.\n\nThe University of Texas at Austin (UT Austin) was founded in 1883, and the university's School of Business Administration was established a few decades later in 1922. The school quickly grew, establishing a Master in Professional Accounting program in 1948 and offering its first executive education programs in 1955.\n\nEffects of the 1990s technology boom and dot-com bubble were palpable in Austin, leaving the nickname \"Silicon Hills\" on the city. One McCombs School program that has capitalized on this is the Venture Labs Investment Competition, is the oldest operating inter-business school new-venture competition in the world. Begun in 1984, it has been dubbed the \"Super Bowl of world business plan competitions.\" Also opportunistic was the creation of the school's first Management Information Systems degree in 1990. The MBA Investment Fund, LLC was also founded in 1994, becoming the first legally constituted investment fund run by Master of Business Administration (MBA) students and proving quite successful, with a 17.5 percent annual return to date. Additionally, in 1995 the college became the first to require students have an e-mail address.\n\nOn May 11, 2000, an auto dealership owner Red McCombs announced a $50 million donation to UT Austin. In his honor, the College of Business Administration and the Graduate School of Business were merged under the newly created Red McCombs School of Business.\n\nIn June 2007, AT&T pledged $25 million to the McCombs School towards the construction of the Executive Education and Conference Center. As part of the financial contribution, the center, which opened August 2008, will be named the AT&T Executive Education and Conference Center for the next 25 years.\n\nThe McCombs School of Business is located in the heart of the University of Texas at Austin campus. The majority of the McCombs School is housed in a three-building complex called the George Kozmetsky Center for Business Education, named after philanthropist and former College of Business Administration dean, Dr. George Kozmetsky, at the intersection of 21st and Speedway Streets. The McCombs School is bordered by Waggener Hall (the former home of the College of Business Administration) to the North, Gregory Gymnasium, and E. P. Schoch Building (one of the last overseen by campus master planner Paul Cret) to the East and is adjacent to Perry–Castañeda Library to the south.\n\nThe Business-Economics Building (now the College of Business Administration Building), opened in January 1962. It was the largest classroom structure on campus when it was built and housed the first escalator on campus. Today, it is home to the undergraduate programs at the McCombs School and the Bureau of Business Research. The building faces Speedway Street and unlike the majority of surrounding Mediterranean Revival Style architecture structures, most of the building is faced with brick.\n\nIn March 1976, Graduate School of Business Building opened next to the existing building facing 21st Street. Since its inception, the addition to the College of Business Administration Building houses the separate graduate MBA program. The addition was constructed in a rhombus shape to protect a grove of trees on the north side of the building.\n\nLocated on the southwest corner of the UT campus, the AT&T Executive Education and Conference Center is a multi-function complex and hotel. The facility has multiple sized classrooms and breakout rooms, a 300-seat amphitheater, ballroom, three restaurants, and 297 hotel rooms. The center hosts all of the executive education programs for the McCombs School, including the Texas Executive Education and evening MBA programs. It is the first building to be built to the U.S. Green Building Council's LEED Silver certification standards on campus.\n\nA statue titled \"The Family Group\" by sculptor, and former UT College of Fine Arts professor, Charles Umlauf sits in the middle of McCombs Plaza at the southern entrance of the GSB Building.\n\nIn August 2012, the University of Texas System Board of Regents approved a proposal for a new $155 million, 458,000-square-foot Graduate Business Education Center to serve MBA, M.S, and upper level undergraduate courses. Located across from the AT&T Executive Education and Conference Center, the new state-of-the-art building opened March 2018. This facility is called Robert B. Rowling Hall.\n\nMcCombs is made up of a total of 6,548 students (Fall 2018): 4,752 undergraduates, 1,702 postgraduate, and 94 doctoral students. An additional 6,450 undergraduates take coursework through the Texas Business Foundations Program (Texas BFP), described below, for a total enrollment of 12,998. All undergraduates classes are at the main campus in Austin while almost a fifth of postgraduate student classes are held outside of Central Texas in Dallas, Houston, and Mexico City.\n\nIn addition to traditional graduation routes, McCombs offers a five-year program where students earn their BBA and Master in Professional Accounting (MPA) degrees concurrently. The Texas BFP offers non-business majors the opportunity to grasp the fundamentals of business operations and minor in business while pursuing any undergraduate program at the University of Texas at Austin. Students in the Business Foundations Program take seven business courses (two lower-division and five upper-division) in addition to their existing undergraduate course work. Students who complete the program are capable of integrating their minor into their future career.\n\nIn Fall 2018, out of the 8,034 freshman applicants, 1,835 were admitted to the undergraduate program. Unlike most colleges & schools at the University of Texas at Austin and the university itself, McCombs does not accept spring or summer applications. Prospective students must apply for admission only during the fall semester. Both undergraduate and postgraduate applicants have similar admissions requirements. Applicants are evaluated holistically based on letters of recommendation, essays, transcripts, and a resume. MBA applicants however are encouraged to have at least two years of full-time work experience and are required to take the Graduate Management Admission Test (GMAT). For Fall 2018, the McCombs school received just over 2,000 applications for the Full-Time MBA program whose class size is 284.\n\nThe McCombs School of Business awards the degrees of Bachelor of Business Administration (BBA), Master of Business Administration (MBA), Master in Professional Accounting (MPA), Masters of Science in Marketing (MSM), Master of Science in Business Analytics (MSBA), Master of Science in Finance (MSF), Master of Science in Information Technology and Management (MSITM), Master of Science in Technology Commercialization (MSTC), Doctorate of Philosophy (PhD), as well as certificates upon completion of non-degreed Executive Education programs. Programs awarding doctoral degrees at the McCombs School of Business are divided in five academic departments, Accounting, Finance, Information, Risk, and Operations Management (IROM), Management, and Marketing. A sixth department, Business, Government and Society, was created in 2010 and does not award a doctoral degree.\n\nFinance students are divided into six different specializations or \"tracks.\" The Corporate Finance and Investment Banking Track prepares students for careers as associates of corporate treasury departments, as financial analysts for corporations or investment banks, and as management consultants. The Energy Finance Track prepares students for positions in project-financing, valuation, and risk management in the energy sector. The Investment Management Track provides students with a background suitable for starting positions as financial analysts with investment funds, investment banks or other financial institutions. The Financial Markets/Banking Track prepares students for various financial institution-related careers such as lending officers and financial analysts. The Real Estate Track prepares students for positions in real estate commercial brokerage and appraisal, mortgage banking, loan underwriting, real estate development and investment, and property management. Finally, the General Finance Track for students who do not wish to specialize in any area.\n\nAdmission is based on high school class rank along with extracurricular activities, and is typically only offered to students in the top 2% of their graduating class. BHP courses are taught by some of the McCombs School's most experienced faculty. Emphasis is placed on class discussion and presentations, case study analysis, and the research of actual business decisions. Enrollment in BHP classes is restricted to students in the program, and has small class sizes (generally 30-45 students). BHP also has a sophomore transfer application for first-year students that want to transfer into the Business Honors Program the following year.\n\nMcCombs is home to over a dozen collaborative research centers focused on various business and investment sectors. Research centers are part of the academic departments and research information within that department according to the center's specialty.\n\nGraduates from McCombs receive competitive salaries and are solicited by some of the best companies in the world. Furthermore, McCombs has continued to maintain a very high job placement for its graduates due to the booming Texas economy and job market. Top recruiters at McCombs historically include PriceWaterhouseCoopers, Ernst & Young, Deloitte, KPMG, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, JP Morgan Chase, Credit Suisse, Dell, Citigroup, Boston Consulting Group, Microsoft, Chevron, and BP.\n\nAlumni of the business school include:\n\nAs of the 2015–2016 school year, the McCombs School employs 192 full-time equivalent faculty. Jay C. Hartzell is the 12th dean of the McCombs School of Business at The University of Texas at Austin. He joined UT in 2001 after teaching at New York University's Stern School of Business, and prior to his current role, he held several key administrative roles at the McCombs School. His most notable positions include his service as the Senior Associate Dean for Academic Affairs, Chair of the Finance Department, and Executive Director of the McCombs School's Real Estate Finance and Investment Center. Dr. Hartzell holds the Centennial Chair in Business Education Leadership and the Trammell Crow Regents Professorship in Business. He holds a B.S. in Business Administration and Economics (cum laude) from Trinity University and a Ph.D. in Finance from The University of Texas at Austin. His research focuses on real estate finance, corporate finance and corporate governance.\n\n"}

It is in Keats Grove, Hampstead, toward the edge of inner north London. Maps before about 1915\nshow the road with one of its earlier names, John Street; the road has also been known as Albion Grove. The building was originally a pair of semi-detached houses known as \"Wentworth Place\". John Keats lodged in one of them with his friend Charles Brown from December 1818 to September 1820. These were perhaps Keats's most productive years. According to Brown, \"Ode to a Nightingale\" was written under a plum tree in the garden.\n\nWhile living in the house, Keats fell in love with and became engaged to Fanny Brawne, who lived with her family in the adjacent house. Keats became increasingly ill with tuberculosis and was advised to move to a warmer climate. He left London in 1820 and died, unmarried, in Italy the following year.\n\nThe house is a Grade I listed building.\n\nThe house was built during 1814–15 and was probably completed between November 1815 and February 1816. The house was one of the first to be built in the area known as the Lower Heath Quarter.\n\nBy October 1816, Charles Wentworth Dilke and his friend Charles Brown had moved in. Other members of the Dilke family occupied two other adjacent houses. John Keats began visiting the house in 1817 after he had been introduced to Dilke by John Hamilton Reynolds, who was part of Leigh Hunt's circle of friends. In December 1818, after Keats's brother Tom died of tuberculosis, Brown invited Keats to \"keep house\" with him. Keats paid £5 per month ( prices) and half the liquor bill.\n\nDilke and his family left on 3 April 1819 and let the house, probably furnished, to Mrs Brawne, a widow, and her family, who had briefly occupied Brown's half of the house when Keats and Brown were on their walking tour of Scotland.\n\nBrown transferred his part of Wentworth Place to Dilke's father on 18 June 1822 and left for Italy in the same year.\n\nAfter Keats's 1821 death, his sister Fanny became friends with Fanny Brawne. Fanny Keats and her husband Valentin Llanos occupied what had been Brown's half of the house from 1828 until 1831. Mrs Brawne died in December 1829 from an accident. By March 1830, the Brawnes had left their part.\n\nThe two houses were joined together in 1838–9 and a drawing-room was added. The house was in nearly continuous occupation until the 20th century, when it was threatened with demolition. The house was saved by subscription and opened to the public as the Keats Memorial House on 9 May 1925.\n\nThere were several notable occupants of the house during the 19th century: the painter and illustrator Henry Courtney Selous (1835–1838); Miss Chester (1838–1848), a retired actress, who had once been a favourite of George IV, who converted the house into one dwelling and added a dining room and conservatory; the piano manufacturer Charles Cadby (1858–1865); the physiologist Dr William Sharpey (1867–1875); and finally George Currey, Master of Charterhouse (1876). A Royal Society of Arts blue plaque was unveiled in 1896 to commemorate Keats at the house.\n\nIn July and August 2009, the museum once again hosted \"Keats in Hampstead\", a performance piece about Keats's life in Hampstead, his poetry, prose and his love for Fanny Brawne.\n\nThe building next door, within the grounds of the house, occupies the space where the kitchen garden and outhouses were; it was also the site of a later coach house. It was opened on 16 July 1931 as the 'Keats Museum and Branch Library', housing both a public library and a room to display artifacts from the Keats House collection. Some of these artifacts were donated by Charles Armitage Brown's descendants in New Plymouth, New Zealand, the town to which Charles Brown emigrated in the last year of his life. The Heath Branch Public Library closed in March 2012. The building, which is part of the Keats House Trust administered by the City of London Corporation, reopened in April 2012 as \"Ten Keats Grove\". A volunteer-run library currently occupies part of the space in the building.\n\nArtifacts on display in the house include the engagement ring Keats offered to Fanny Brawne and a copy of Keats's death mask. The museum runs regular poetry and literary events, and offers a range of educational facilities. In December 2006 it was announced that the house was to benefit from a restoration programme partly financed by a £424,000 Heritage Lottery Fund grant. Keats House was closed on 1 November 2007 and reopened on Friday, 24 July 2009, some six months after the projected re-opening.\n\nTo support the work of the house and to contribute to its upkeep, the Keats Foundation was established as a Trust in November 2010.\n\nThe tree is a Common or Black Mulberry and believed to date from the 17th century. Mulberry trees have been cultivated in England since at least the early 16th century but are not native to Great Britain. As there were other fruit trees in the grounds of Keats House, the mulberry tree may have been part of an orchard. If the tree is as old as it is thought to be, then John Keats would have seen it, although he did not mention it in his writings. Keats did mention a white mulberry tree once in a July 1818 letter to his friend John Hamilton Reynolds.\n\nThe house is on the south side of Keats Grove between St John's Church on Downshire Hill and South End Road in Hampstead, London NW3 2RR. The nearest stations are Hampstead Heath railway station on London Overground, and Belsize Park and Hampstead tube stations both on the Northern line Edgware branch. From central London, red bus route 24 terminates at South End Green, Hampstead, close to the house and marked as 275 at the bottom right of the area map.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2041866", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2041866", "title": "Floyd Lawson", "text": "Floyd Lawson\n\nFloyd Lawson (Floyd the Barber) is a fictional character on the American sitcom \"The Andy Griffith Show\", who was likely inspired by barbers in Andy Griffith's real-life hometown of Mount Airy, North Carolina. He was portrayed by Howard McNear. One barber named Russell Hiatt (1924-2016) was known as \"the real-life Floyd\". Hiatt may have cut Andy Griffith's hair while Griffith was young and living in Mount Airy, and was still cutting hair daily at \"Floyd's City Barber Shop\" in downtown Mount Airy until several years before his death on May 3, 2016. Griffith denied that Hiatt was the inspiration for Floyd Lawson, however, saying, \"A barber up there says he cut my hair when I was a child. Hell, he'll have to be 115 years old.\"\n\nFloyd the Barber was the slow-paced, somewhat absent-minded barber in the series' fictional town of Mayberry. He was first seen in episode 12, \"Stranger in Town\", played by actor Walter Baldwin. Baldwin established the running gag of Floyd's inability to trim sideburns evenly, which continued throughout the run of the series. Baldwin portrayed Floyd for just one episode. From January, 1961 on, the role was played by Howard McNear, the actor most commonly associated with the role. In McNear's first appearance as Floyd, in episode 13, \"Mayberry Goes Hollywood,\" the character's last name was \"Colby\"; thereafter, the character was always \"Floyd Lawson\".\n\nOver the first few seasons, the importance of Floyd the Barber to the series increased. Slowly, McNear changed his delivery of dialogue for Floyd from fast-paced to slower and slower as time went on. Floyd also became involved more in the plots of the various episodes as the show progressed.\n\nIn early 1963, midway through the third season, Howard McNear suffered a serious stroke. He was left with limited use of his arms and legs, especially his left arm, which rarely moved. The producers of the series and Andy Griffith wanted McNear to return as Floyd when his health permitted it, and after about a year, McNear was talked into coming back (which he was not going to do at first). The series had a special chair constructed that McNear was able to sit in most of the time while on the set, as the stroke had left him only able to stand for short periods of time. Accordingly, the Floyd character then began to appear regularly again on the series towards the end of season four.\n\nThe last appearance of Floyd the Barber on \"The Andy Griffith Show\" was in the final episode of the seventh season. Howard McNear's health worsened and he was not able to return to the series for season eight, and he died less than a year later. To try to fill in his loss on the series, a new character named Emmett Clark (a fix-it man) was brought in. As announced on the series, Floyd had retired because he had earned enough money. Emmett (played by veteran character actor Paul Hartman) moved his fix-it shop into Floyd's old barber shop location in Mayberry.\n\nFloyd has a mustache, wears thick glasses, and usually wears a white barber jacket. He is a whimsical and laid back, but occasionally excitable and absent-minded fellow whose barber shop is something of an institution in the fictional town of Mayberry. He is also an amateur poet, sometimes composing verse for Mayberry civic events. These poems always consisted of repeating, over and over, the same few words. Floyd also has a fondness for President Calvin Coolidge, often attributing quotes to him, with the irony being that President Coolidge was known for being a man of few words with the nickname of \"Silent Cal\". The men of Mayberry gather at Floyd's barbershop, not only to get their hair cut, but also to play checkers, discuss current events, read comic books, or generally just to \"shoot the breeze\" and \"carry on\". When not cutting hair, Floyd can generally be seen sitting on the bench outside his shop. \nFloyd Lawson is the uncle of Deputy Warren Ferguson, who replaced Deputy Barney Fife in the 1965 season, after the departure of actor Don Knotts. In the season-one episode \"Those Gossipin' Men\", Floyd has a son named Norman who plays the saxophone. Norman is not seen again in the series, although he is mentioned in the episode \"The Jinx\" as a terrible baseball player. In other season-one episodes, Floyd refers to his wife, whose name is revealed to be Melba in the season-one episode \"Quiet Sam\". Melba was never seen and was never referred to after the first season. In the season-three episode, \"Floyd the Gay Deceiver\", Floyd is apparently single or a widower. The episode centers around Floyd meeting a woman with whom he corresponded through a \"Lonely Hearts Club\".\n\nAt the start of \"The Andy Griffith Show\", Floyd was a secondary character, despite the fact that his barbershop is one of the main centers of action in Mayberry. Over time, Floyd's role gradually increased, and he began to be featured as a main character, most notably in the season-two episode \"The Bookie Barber\" and two season-three episodes: \"Floyd the Gay Deceiver\" and \"Convicts At Large\".\n\nThe character of Floyd the Barber has proven to be a large part of the popular culture as evidenced by these examples: In two episodes of the comedy sketch program Second City Television, actor Eugene Levy played Floyd the Barber. His first appearance was in a parody of \"The Godfather\", in the opening scene as Amerigo Bonasera, in which he asks the Don to hurt Opie for breaking his barber pole. The last line delivered by Floyd is \"Ohh, and would you kill Howard Sprague for me?\" referring to Howard Sprague, a character from \"The Andy Griffith Show\". His other appearance was in a parody of \"The Andy Griffith Show\", \"The Merv Griffith Show\", in which he is in his barber shop cutting hair and at a surprise party for Gomer.\n\nKurt Cobain wrote a song titled \"Floyd the Barber\" that was recorded on Nirvana's first album \"Bleach\" (1989). In the song, Floyd, Barney, Opie, and Aunt Bee hold him captive after he comes in for a shave, torturing and murdering him.\n\n\"St. Elsewhere\", which frequently referenced other television programs, had a barber named Floyd in the series finale (which also referred to Dr. Kimble's one-armed patient being on the loose, Henry Blake (patient no. 4077) being the victim of a helicopter crash, and a re-enactment of the \"Mary Tyler Moore\"’s group-hug and shuffle to the tissues).\n\nFloyd Lawson is also referenced in the theme song for the animated series \"Freakazoid\" as being the titular hero's barber. \n\nHe is also mentioned numerous times on different episodes of \"Mystery Science Theater 3000\" and \"Cinematic Titanic\".\n\nIn the \"Star Trek\" episode \"The City on the Edge of Forever\" has a scene in which Captain Kirk (William Shatner) and guest star Joan Collins are walking down a street supposedly located in New York City during the 1930s. As they are walking down the sidewalk, a glass window clearly marked \"Floyd's Barber Shop\" is visible briefly. This is because both series used the outdoor Desilu Studios lot that was originally constructed as \"Atlanta\" in the film \"Gone with the Wind\" (1939).\n\nIn an episode of \"St. Elsewhere\", guest-starring Griffith cast member Jack Dodson, the characters make reference to the hospital's barber also named Floyd. Dodson's character adds, \"He may bury us all.\"\n\nOn NBC's sitcom \"30 Rock\", Liz Lemon's recurring boyfriend, a recovering alcoholic, is named Floyd de Barber and played by \"Saturday Night Live\" cast member Jason Sudeikis.\n\nHis voice and mannerisms were sometimes imitated by Jon Stewart on \"The Daily Show\".\n\nFX series \"Sons of Anarchy\" featured a barber by the name of Floyd, first showing up in season one.\n\nIn the \"Animaniacs\" episode \"Dough Dough Boys/Boot Camping/General Boo-Regard\", Wakko gets his hair cut by Floyd during boot camp. Floyd in this episode was voiced by John Roarke.\n\nIn the English dub of \"\", Matt and T.K. go to a barber shop, where the barber is addressed as \"Floyd\". In the closing credits, other characters in the barber shop are credited as \"Andy,\" \"Barney\", and \"Aunt Bea\".\n\nIn the fourth-season episode of \"Arrested Development\" entitled \"Smashed\", during the \"haircut meeting\", Ron Howard refers to his barber as Floyd, remarking that he calls all of his barbers \"Floyd\". Howard was a fellow castmate in \"The Andy Griffith Show\".\n\nComedian Tim Wilson paid homage to Lawson in the lyrics of his 1999 song \"Haircut Malpractice\", singing, \"We ought to strap you in the chair with Floyd Lawson and get that mess under control.\"\n\nActor and comedian Rich Koz has portrayed Floyd Lawson on WCIU-TV's \"Svengoolie\", which is now seen nationally on the Me-TV Network. Koz appeared as Floyd during the program's showing of \"Return to Mayberry\", the 1986 NBC TV movie reuniting the surviving characters of \"The Andy Griffith Show\". Koz also portrayed Floyd Lawson during a minimarathon of \"The Munsters\" as part of \"Svengoolie's TV Graveyard\".\n\nA 1988, CBS's Saturday morning kids show titled \"Hey Vern It's Ernest\" had a segment in each episode titled \"Earl the Barber\". Earl is clearly patterned after Mayberry's barber, Floyd. In each episode, lead character Ernest P. Worrell comes in for a haircut, and after giving it some thought, tells Earl he wants his hair cut to make him look like a Wall Street tycoon. Earl is then shown in quick picture cuts (with fast music) \"going to work\". When finished, he gives Ernest a mirror to check out his handiwork. Ernest, shocked at the results, excitedly says, \"Earl, this doesn't make me look like a Wall Street tycoon.\" Realizing his mistake, Earl says \"silly me, why I thought you said a baby baboon\" or a windswept dune or a lazy lagoon, for example. Earl then asks Ernest how he likes the new look. After taking a second look at the mirror, Ernest replies \"It could work.\"\n\nIn the mid-1960s, Russell Hiatt contacted Howard McNear and gained his written permission to use his likeness on T-shirts and other items for an unlimited amount of time. Over the years, McNear's likeness has been used for things such as large billboard ads advertising \"Pink Floyd\" on rock radio. A large pink image of Howard McNear was usually in the ads. All rights to McNear's image are controlled by the barber Hiatt.\n\nHiatt died May 3, 2016, at 92 after nearly 70 years working at Floyd's City Barber Shop in Andy Griffith's real hometown of Mount Airy, North Carolina. Due to health problems, he had retired several years earlier. Whether he cut Griffith's hair when the actor had yet to become famous is uncertain, though Griffith got his hair cut at Palace Barber Shop. Hiatt was only two years older than Griffith, so he would have had to have cut his hair before Griffith moved away from Mt. Airy for college in the late 1940s. They both would have been teenagers at that time. In 1946, Hiatt started working at City Barber Shop (which was established in 1929), which added the name Floyd's in 1989 and now has photos and drawings of characters from the show. Jim Clark of the Andy Griffith Show Rerun Watchers Club doubts that City Barber Shop inspired Floyd's, but believes it was based Griffith's memories of barber shops in Mount Airy. Though Hiatt made no attempt to look like or act like the TV character, Clark called Hiatt, \"the uncanny virtual embodiment of Floyd the Barber\".\n\nPeople from every state and 42 countries have visited City Barber Shop; many are shown in the 20,000 photos on the walls and the 40,000 other photos in storage. On two separate occasions, Oprah Winfrey and Lou Ferrigno visited. George \"Goober\" Lindsey and John Schneider (of \"The Dukes of Hazzard\" and \"Smallville\") both had their hair trimmed by Hiatt himself while visiting Mount Airy.\n"}

With average weekday ridership around passengers in , BART is the fifth busiest rapid transit system in the United States. BART is administered by the Bay Area Rapid Transit District, a special district government agency formed by Alameda, Contra Costa, and San Francisco counties.\n\nMondays through Saturdays, BART trains run on five routes; four are transbay routes connecting San Francisco to Oakland and various destinations in the East Bay, while the fifth, the Richmond–Warm Springs line, runs exclusively in the East Bay. Two of the five routes do not run on nights and weekends, and one is truncated on Saturdays, but all stations remain accessible by transfers via other routes. In September 1972 BART's first route opened: Fremont to MacArthur, extended to Richmond in January 1973. Concord to MacArthur started in May 1973 and Montgomery Street to Daly City began in November 1973. The original system was completed in September 1974 when trains first carried passengers through the underwater Transbay Tube. BART's three routes then were Concord–Daly City, Fremont—Daly City and Richmond–Fremont.\n\nThe Concord-Daly City line was extended to North Concord/Martinez in 1995 and to Colma and Pittsburg/Bay Point in 1996. BART's fifth route, the Dublin/Pleasanton–Daly City line, began when the branch to Dublin/Pleasanton opened in 1997. The San Mateo County line was extended south from Colma to San Francisco International Airport and Millbrae in 2003. BART passengers can reach Oakland International Airport on BART's new automated guideway transit (AGT) system, the Coliseum–Oakland International Airport line. The Richmond-Fremont and Fremont-Daly City lines were later extended to Warm Springs/South Fremont in 2017. An extension of BART using diesel multiple unit technology, called BART to Antioch but also known during construction as eBART, opened to Antioch in 2018. \n\nBART's rapid transit system has 48 stations: 19 on the surface, 14 elevated, and 15 underground (i.e. subway). Nineteen stations are in Alameda County, eleven are in Contra Costa, and eight are in San Francisco. Six stations are in San Mateo County, though the county is not part of SF BART district. Warm Springs is the southernmost station and Pittsburg/Bay Point is the northernmost. , has the highest ridership and has the lowest.\n\nBART operates six named and interlined heavy rail services plus one separate automated guideway line. Five of the heavy rail services run through Oakland, and all of those but the Richmond–Warm Springs/South Fremont line and the SFO–Millbrae shuttle go through the Transbay Tube to San Francisco. All six services run on weekdays until the end of the afternoon rush hour; evenings (after about 7:00 pm), nights (after about 9:00 pm), and Sundays have as few as three services operating. Three of the services change terminals at certain times so that all stations are served during all service hours. The eastern segment of the line (between Antioch and the transfer platform east of Pittsburg/Bay Point) uses different rolling stock and is separated from the rest of the line.\n\nUnlike most other rapid transit and rail systems around the world, BART lines are not primarily referred to by shorthand designations or their color names (although the colors used on maps have been constant since 1980). The services are mainly identified on maps, schedules, and station signage by the names of their termini. However, the new fleet displays line colors more prominently, and BART has begun to use color names in press releases and GTFS data.\n\nBART has 48 passenger stations, of which 44 are high-platform rapid transit stations. is served by the Oakland Airport Connector, which uses cable-hauled automated guideway transit (AGT) rolling stock; has separate platforms for rapid transit trains and AGT trains. and have low platforms for use with the diesel multiple unit (DMU) trains used on that section of the line. A transfer platform east of , which does not have street access and is not designated as a station, provides cross-platform transfers between the rapid transit and DMU sections of the line. \n\nSeven stations are designated as transfer points between services; timed cross-platform transfers are available between the and lines at (southbound) and (northbound). Nine stations are the terminal of one or more services. (Two of these terminal stations - and - are also transfer stations.) Eight stations have connections available to other rail services - Amtrak, Caltrain, and Muni Metro. All stations are served during all operating hours.\n\n, two stations ( and ) are complete and will open on June 13, 2020 as Phase I of the Silicon Valley extension. The four-station Phase II will add underground stations at , , and in San José, plus the surface-level station; it is planned to open in 2029 or 2030. An infill station on the Warm Springs extension at is planned to open in 2026. Two additional infill stations–the surface-level on the Silicon Valley extension and the elevated on the Oakland Airport Connector–are proposed but not yet funded or scheduled.\n\nThese future stations connect with other rail services in the South Bay region, including Altamont Corridor Express () and VTA light rail ().\n\n"}

He was born into a wealthy and well respected family. Mansur received most of his education from his family in Shiraz, who were also well established scholars, physicians, and active as jurists and poets. He was educated in traditional schools in the Persian province of Fars and traveled to many other cities, which assisted in his education. Most notably, Mansur traveled several times to the city of Tabriz, which was known for its rich scientific background.\n\nMansur wrote many medical manuscripts ranging from a synopsis of general medicine, Kifaya-yi Mansuri, to Tashrihi Mansuri, a system-based anatomical work complete with colored illustrations of different organ systems. He dedicated both of his major medical writings, a general medical encyclopedia, and a study of anatomy to rulers of the Persian province of Fars, Prince Pir Mohammad Bahador Khan, the grandson of Tamerlane. Throughout his works, Mansur engaged in then-controversial topics, and made references to the works of Aristotle, Hippocrates, al-Razi, and Avicenna.\n\nThe work he was most known for was his, Tashrīḥ-i badan-i insān (MS P 19) (The Anatomy of the Human Body, also known as \"Mansur's Anatomy\" \"Tashrīḥi Manṣūri\") Commissioned by Zayn al-Abidin, an important political figure in being the last Muzaffarid ruler of Fars, Mansur's Anatomy is a medical treatise of about forty manuscript folios. It consists of seven sections: an introduction, five chapters covering the osseous, nervous, muscular, venous, and arterial systems, and an appendix on the formation of the fetus and compound organs, such as the heart. Instead of discussing interrelated functions of organs, he discussed organs based on their hierarchical ordering of functionality-related groups according to their importance to the life of the body. In this manner he discussed the anatomy of the vital and respiratory organs, and then the anatomy of the organs of nourishment, perception, and finally, reproduction. A concluding section on compound organs, such as the heart and brain, and on the formation of the fetus, was illustrated with a diagram showing a pregnant woman. Mansur's Anatomy is chiefly recognized for its inclusion of such colored anatomical illustrations, the first of its kind in the Arabic world.\n\nPhysicians and philosophers often argued whether the heart or brain was formed first in the fetus, and this debate forms an important part of Mansur ibn Ilyas' written works. In his works, Mansur ibn Ilyas argues that the heart is the first organ to form, unlike Hippocrates who argued that the brain is the first organ. Mansur ibn Ilyas' reasoning for the heart as the primary organ was that the semen is composed of air and strong heat, creating a substance called pneuma, which needs to be contained or it will decompose. The containment of the pneuma is within the heart, creating the body and making the heart the main source of the body’s natural heat. The heart also acts as the main force in forming the other organs; using the heat from the heart, the heart is able to provide the rest of the body with nourishment. This marks the start of the formation of the liver, which holds the source of nourishment within it. Lastly, Mansur argued that the brain is the organ that contains the senses, and these senses are what gives life force to the body. If the brain is formed first, like Hippocrates said, then there is nothing for the brain to give life to. The heart needs to be formed before the brain, so that the brain can give its life force to the rest of the body. Throughout his works, Mansur made references to the works of Aristotle, Hippocrates, al-Razi, and Avicenna.\n\nKifāyah-i Mujāhidīyah (MS P 28, item 4) (The Sufficient [book] for Mujahid)\n\nWhile Mansur's Anatomy was not the first notation of the human body, it is considered to be the first color atlas ever created. This document led to a great deal of change in the way the Islamic world viewed human anatomy at the time, as until this point a color atlas was considered to be against Islamic law. Mansur ibn Ilyas is also credited with one of the earliest anatomical sketches of a pregnant woman; while many believe his other illustrations to have been inspired by earlier Latin and Greek writings, the pregnant woman is considered an original work.\n\n\n"}

His best-known work is \"Nightmare Alley\" (1946), which was adapted into a 1947 film starring Tyrone Power.\n\nGresham was born in Baltimore, Maryland. As a child, he moved to New York with his family, where he became fascinated by the sideshow at Coney Island. Upon graduating from Erasmus Hall High School in Brooklyn in 1926, Gresham drifted from job to job, and worked as a folk singer in Greenwich Village. In 1937, Gresham served as a volunteer medic for the Loyalist forces during the Spanish Civil War. There, he befriended a former sideshow employee, Joseph Daniel \"Doc\" Halliday, and their long conversations inspired much of his work, particularly Gresham's two books about the American carnival, the nonfiction \"Monster Midway\" and the fictional \"Nightmare Alley\".\n\nReturning to the United States in 1939, after a troubling period that involved a stay in a tuberculosis ward and a suicide attempt, Gresham found work editing true crime magazines. In 1942, Gresham married Joy Davidman, a poet, with whom he had two children, David and Douglas. Gresham was an abusive and alcoholic husband. Davidman, an ethnically Jewish atheist, became a fan of the writings of C. S. Lewis, which led eventually to her conversion to Christianity. After a violent encounter with Gresham, who wanted a divorce, Davidman ultimately agreed to end her marriage to Gresham and later married Lewis, their relationship forming the inspiration for the play and movie \"Shadowlands\".\n\nGresham married Davidman's first cousin, Renee Rodriguez, with whom he had been having an affair and who was herself suffering an abusive marriage. Gresham joined Alcoholics Anonymous and developed a deep interest in Spiritualism, having already exposed many of the fraudulent techniques of popular spiritualists in his two sideshow-themed books and having written a book about Houdini with the assistance of noted skeptic James Randi. He was also an early enthusiast of Scientology but later denounced the religion as another kind of spook racket.\n\nIn 1962, Gresham's health began to take a turn for the worse. He had started to go blind and was diagnosed with tongue cancer. On September 14, 1962, he checked into the Hotel Carter, Manhattan — which he had often frequented while writing \"Nightmare Alley\" over a decade earlier. There, 53-year-old Gresham took his life with an overdose of sleeping pills. His death went generally unnoticed by the New York press, but for a mention by a bridge columnist. In his pocket they found business cards reading, \"No Address. No Phone. No Business. No Money. Retired.\"\n\n"}

It was to have become the standard submachine gun of the Polish Army some time in the 1940s. However, its production was halted by the 1939 Invasion of Poland and World War II.\n\nThe design was generally modelled after the German ERMA EMP-35. Common features of the two weapons included a wooden butt and forward pistol grip; the most noticeable difference was the magazine extending downwards in the Mors rather than to the left side of the ERMA. The SMG was to be issued to some of the infantry units, as well as to tank crews and boarding parties of the Polish Navy and armoured trains. Later the idea of equipping tank crews was abandoned due to its size. After extensive tests, the construction proved to be reliable and durable. The first trial series of 36 was ordered in March 1939 and additional purchases were planned. However, until September 1939 the Fabryka Karabinów in Warsaw produced only 39, 3 of these being the prototypes. After the start of hostilities, all were issued to the 3rd Rifle Battalion, which used them during the battle for Warsaw, and to the staff company of the 39th Infantry Division.\n\nOnly 4 incomplete SMGs have survived: one in the Polish Army Museum in Warsaw (no.38, acquired from the Soviet Union in 1983), two in Russia (no.19 in Petersburg and no.39 in Moscow) and one in Budapest museum, since 2013 loaned to Land Forces Museum in Bydgoszcz.\n\n"}

It was released as the second single from the band's 2005 album, \"Make Believe\". \"We Are All on Drugs\" was released to radio on July 12, 2005. The song is not specifically about drugs. Rather, Rivers Cuomo has said that it is more generally about the over-stimulated society addicted to the internet, gambling, drugs and relationships.\n\nThe song went into mixing with two lines in the bridge:, \"I want to confiscate your drugs/ I don't think I can get enough\", and was eventually released that way on early printings of the album, and on published sheet music. It was replaced on future printings (as well as on the CD single) with \"I want to reach a higher plane/ where things will never be the same.\"\n\nAn edited version of the song for MTV \"We Are All in Love\", changed \"on drugs\" to \"in love\" in the chorus. Patrick Wilson suggested having the edit be \"We Are All on Hugs\", which Cuomo thought was too \"quirky\". Brian Bell suggested the \"in love\" edit. Despite this edit the headline \"WE ARE ALL ON DRUGS\" still remains on the newspaper Cuomo reads at the barber shop in the music video.\n\nThe music video for the song features Rivers Cuomo wandering through a world where people appear to be on drugs (with many of the extras miming to the lyrics). The video was directed by Justin Francis. The video was the most complex shoot in Weezer history, spanning two days, having various actors, special effects and at one point according to Brian Bell, nearly being shut down by the police. Rick Rubin, the song's producer, makes a cameo as a firefighter towards the end.\n\nCuomo said about the song: I was living in an apartment above the Sunset Strip, and every Friday and Saturday night I'd hear people cruising and partying, and hooting and hollering. And I went to sleep one night and I heard those sounds all through the night, in my dreams. I had this dream about a kid on the Metro bus, blasting hip hop into his brain through his headphones. And the music sounded so decadent and overstimulating, and I woke up in the midst of that dream, in a haze, and immediately said to myself, \"Man, we're all on drugs!\" And I instantly knew that would be a cool song.\n\nIn a May 9, 2005 interview with Y100, Cuomo talked about the song: \"Don't take it literally...I'm singing more about the fact [of] how addicted we all are to stimulating ourselves, and over-stimulating ourselves with music, or whatever it is in our lives.

{"id": "2041980", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2041980", "title": "Couette flow", "text": "Couette flow\n\nIn fluid dynamics, Couette flow is the flow of a viscous fluid in the space between two surfaces, one of which is moving tangentially relative to the other. The configuration often takes the form of two parallel plates or the gap between two concentric cylinders. The flow is driven by virtue of viscous drag force acting on the fluid, but may additionally be motivated by an applied pressure gradient in the flow direction. The Couette configuration models certain practical problems, like flow in lightly loaded journal bearings, and is often employed in viscometry and to demonstrate approximations of reversibility. This type of flow is named in honor of Maurice Couette, a Professor of Physics at the French University of Angers in the late 19th century.\n\nCouette flow is frequently used in undergraduate physics and engineering courses to illustrate shear-driven fluid motion. The simplest conceptual configuration finds two infinite, parallel plates separated by a distance formula_1. One plate, say the top one, translates with a constant velocity formula_2 in its own plane. Neglecting pressure gradients, the Navier–Stokes equations simplify to\n\nwhere formula_4 is a spatial coordinate normal to the plates and formula_5 is the velocity distribution. This equation reflects the assumption that the flow is \"uni-directional\". That is, only one of the three velocity components formula_6 is non-trivial. If y originates at the lower plate, the boundary conditions are formula_7 and formula_8. The exact solution\n\ncan be found by integrating twice and solving for the constants using the boundary conditions.\nA notable aspect of the flow is that shear stress is constant throughout the flow domain. In particular, the first derivative of the velocity, formula_10, is constant. (This is implied by the straight-line profile in the figure.) According to Newton's Law of Viscosity (Newtonian fluid), the shear stress is the product of this expression and the (constant) fluid viscosity.\n\nIn reality, the Couette solution cannot be reached instantaneously. The startup problem is given by\n\nsubject to the initial condition\n\nwith boundary conditions (same as Couette flow)\n\nThe problem can be converted to a homogeneous problem by subtracting steady solution and using separation of variables, the solution is given by\n\nAs formula_15, the steady Couette solution is recovered. At times formula_16, steady Couette solution will be almost reached as shown in the figure. The time required to reach the steady solution depends only on the spacing between the plates formula_1 and the kinematic viscosity of the fluid, but not on how fast the top plate is moved formula_2.\n\nA more general Couette flow situation arises when a constant pressure gradient formula_19 is imposed in a direction parallel to the plates. This problem was studied by H. S. Rowell and U. D. Finlayson. The Navier–Stokes equations, in this case, simplify to\n\nwhere formula_21 is fluid viscosity. Integrating the above equation twice and applying the boundary conditions (same as in the case of Couette flow without pressure gradient) to yield the following exact solution\n\nThe pressure gradient can be positive (adverse pressure gradient) or negative (favorable pressure gradient).\nIt may be noted that in the limiting case of stationary plates(formula_23), the flow is referred to as Plane Poiseuille flow with a\nsymmetric (with reference to the horizontal mid-plane) parabolic velocity profile.\n\nThis problem was first addressed by C.R. Illingworth in 1950. In incompressible flow, the velocity profile is linear because the fluid temperature is constant. When the upper and lower walls are maintained at different temperatures, the velocity profile is complicated, but it turns out it has an exact implicit solution.\n\nConsider the plane Couette flow with lower wall at rest and fluid properties being denoted with subscript formula_24 and let the upper wall move with constant velocity formula_2 with properties denoted with subscript formula_26. The properties and the pressure at the upper wall are prescribed and taken as reference quantities. Let formula_27 be the distance between the two walls. The boundary conditions are\n\nwhere formula_1 is the specific enthalpy and formula_31 is the specific heat. Conservation of mass and formula_4 momentum reveals that formula_33 everywhere in the flow domain. Conservation of formula_34 momentum and energy reduce to\n\nwhere formula_37 is the wall shear stress, but the whole flow domain takes the same shear stress similar to the incompressible Couette flow. The flow do not depend on the Reynolds number formula_38, but rather on the Prandtl number formula_39 and the Mach number formula_40, where formula_41 is the thermal conductivity, formula_42 is the Speed of sound and formula_43 is the Specific heat ratio. It turns out that the said problem can be solved implicitly. Introduce the non-dimensional variables\n\nTherefore, the solutions are\n\nformula_47 is the heat transferred per unit time per unit area from the lower wall. Thus formula_48 are implicit functions of formula_4. It is useful to write the solution in terms of recovery temperature formula_50 and recovery enthalpy formula_51 as the temperature of an insulated wall i.e., the value of formula_52 for which formula_53. Then the solution is\n\nIf specific heat is assumed constant, then formula_56. When formula_57 and formula_58, then formula_59 and formula_21 are constant everywhere, thus recovering the incompressible Couette flow solution. Except this case, one should know formula_61 to solve the problem. When formula_57 and formula_63, the recovery quantities become unity formula_64. There are number of laws to predict formula_65 for example Sutherland's formula, power law etc. For air, the values of formula_66 are commonly used and the results for this case is shown in figure.\n\nLiepmann studied the effects of dissociation and ionization (i.e. formula_31 is not constant) and showed that the recovery temperature is reduced by the dissociation of molecules and also he studied the hydromagnetics effects on this compressible Couette flow.\n\nOne-dimensional flow formula_5 is valid when both plates are infinitely long in streamwise formula_34 and spanwise formula_70 direction. When the spanwise length is made finite, the flow becomes two-dimensional formula_71. The infinitely long length in streamwise direction still needs to be held to ensure the \"uni-directional\" nature of the flow.\nThe below problem is due to Rowell and Finlayson (1928). Consider an infinitely long rectangular channel with transverse height formula_1 and spanwise width formula_27, subjected to the condition that the top wall moves with a constant velocity formula_2. Without any imposed pressure gradient, the Navier–Stokes equations reduce to\n\nwith boundary conditions\n\nUsing separation of variables, the solution is given by\n\nWhen formula_79, the classical plane Couette is recovered as shown in the figure.\n\nCouette flow between coaxial cylinders also known as Taylor–Couette flow is a flow created between two rotating infinitely long co-axial cylinders. The original problem was solved by Stokes in 1845, but Geoffrey Ingram Taylor's name was attached to the flow because he studied the stability of the flow in his famous paper in 1923. \nIf the inner cylinder with radius formula_80 is rotating at a constant angular velocity formula_81 and the outer cylinder with radius formula_82 is rotating at a constant angular velocity formula_83, then the velocity in formula_84 direction is given by\n\n(Note that \"r\" has replaced \"y\" in this result to reflect cylindrical rather than rectangular coordinates). It is clear from this equation that curvature effects no longer allow for constant shear in the flow domain, as shown above.\n\nThe classical Taylor–Couette flow problem assumes infinitely long cylinders, but the finite-length effects which are encountered in real life are more pronounced in cylindrical geometry. The flow is still unidirectional and the solution for formula_86 with cylinder length formula_27 using separation of variables or using integral transforms is given by\n\nwhere formula_89 are Modified Bessel function of the first kind and Modified Bessel function of the second kind respectively.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2041985", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2041985", "title": "Rox (TV series)", "text": "Rox (TV series)\n\nRox is an American independently produced television and later onwards web series, noted for political activism as well as aesthetic and technical achievements. First shown on public-access cable TV in Bloomington, Indiana, the series expanded to multiple cable systems before becoming the first television series distributed on the internet in April 1995. Though an underground production with virtually no budget, the show has generated significant controversy and garnered major media coverage, as well as scholarly attention, especially during its earliest years.\n\nIn the fall of 1989, Bart Everson was arrested for public indecency (streaking) and assigned to community service at Community Access Television Services (then Bloomington Community Access Television) in Bloomington, Indiana. It was here that Everson learned how to produce videos for local cablecast, which a number of writers have suggested was key to the development of the series.\n\n\"Rox\" premiered (under the title \"J&B on the ROX\") on CATS on July 7, 1992. Originally conceived as a \"mixed drink cooking show,\" the program had no budget and was produced under extremely primitive conditions in the basement of a rental property on the town's northeast side. However, the show quickly mutated in both style and substance as the producers moved to new housing and employed different production techniques.\n\nEverson and bartender Joe Nickell produced three seasons of television from 1992 to 1995. Each season consisted of 26 (or more) weekly program of approximately half an hour in length.\n\nAs the producers became more ambitious, the program expanded to public access cable stations in other cities through the laborious process of sending individual tapes through the mail.\n\nIn April 1995, ten years before the launch of YouTube, \"Rox\" began distributing via the web. The debut internet episode, \"Global Village Idiots,\" was produced in segmented fashion and encoded as a series of short QuickTime videos for download from the show's website at rox.com. The program was hailed as the first television series on the internet and an example of \"the real impact of the digital revolution in pop culture.\"\n\nEverson and Nickell ceased production in 1995, citing financial difficulties, but distribution continued to expand. The producers signed several contracts with Free Speech TV, allowing for distribution via satellite on Dish Network. In the early days of Free Speech TV, this was \"the network's most popular show.\"\n\nNickell moved to Montana; Everson relocated to New Orleans, but after an eight year hiatus, they resumed production with their 87th episode.\n\nOver the course of four seasons and almost a hundred episodes, \"Rox\" has covered a wide variety of topics, from the banal task of defrosting a freezer to broader social issues such as poverty and marijuana legalization. The program never uses scripts, employing a reality-based technique of capturing video on the fly, improvising performances, and assembling a narrative after the fact.\n\nOne early report described the show as \"an offbeat look at art, life, culture, society, and whatever else the two hosts feel like looking at. The basic premise is that of teaching the viewers how to mix a variety of drinks.\" \n\nHowever, over the long term, the true subject of the series has proven to be the lives of the producers and their community. This broad approach was reflected when the name of the show was shortened from \"J&B on the Rox\" to simply \"Rox\". \"We took J&B out of the name of the show because the show's not really about the two of us, it's about the community,\" Nickell said in an interview at the time. \"We call it reality-based because it's based on people's lives.\"\n\nMany have branded the show as a form of countercultural identity production, with various commentators labeling it as \"a good depiction of the slacker lifestyle in Bloomington of the early '90s\", \"equal parts slacker diary, societal satire and improvisational theater\", \"a revealing slacker diary and satiric tour de farce of the Bohemian lifestyle,\" \"transform[ing] the bleakest realities of everyday Bloomington, IN, life into 30 minutes of social satire and bohemian adventure.\"\n\nThe show's \"early ’90s, grunge aesthetic\" is reflected in the \"blatantly amateur\" camerawork, \"grainy\" video and \"uneven sound.\"\n\nThrough it all, one constant theme has been the mixing and consumption of alcoholic beverages by Joe Nickell, the show's ostensible bartender. Though the program's early history coincided roughly with the beginning of the American craft cocktail renaissance, it can hardly be described as participating in that trend. Indeed, reporters have accused Nickell of perpetrating \"the most disgusting cocktails ever conceived\" on an unsuspecting populace.\n\nBecause of the shoestring nature of the production, the people behind the camera are usually the same people who are in front of it. No distinction is made between cast and crew.\n\nAmong the hundreds of people who have appeared on the show, the following have logged the most time.\n\n\n\nSince the beginning, \"Rox\" has courted controversy, initially through attempting to air allegedly obscene material and later through provocative, politically-charged depictions of illegal activities.\n\nConflicts between \"Rox\" producers and the Monroe County Public Library (which housed the CATS public access station) cropped up almost immediately, beginning with episode 5 and continuing with episodes 22 and 24.\n\nTelecommunications scholar Lindsy Pack details these three early episodes in a study titled \"Ambiguous Standards, Arbitrary Enforcement.\" The three episodes involved coprophagia, simulated masturbation, and a close-up shot of male genitalia; none were cablecast in their entirety, and were shown only in censored form.\n\nEpisode 5, \"Rum & Coke Special,\" featured a segment titled \"Coprophagia Corner,\" in which the hosts displayed a photo, downloaded from the internet, which \"depicted a woman defecating into a man's mouth.\" The episode was held by station director Michael White, and reviewed by the library board. Some members of the board wanted to cancel the series entirely, but in the end a compromise was reached. A portion of the screen was blacked out and the caption \"Censored by order of the Monroe County Public Library\" was displayed with the library's phone number included; the audio track, which explicitly described the image, was allowed to remain intact.\n\nThe controversies surrounding episodes 22 (\"Boyz Nite In\") and 24 (\"A Badly Dubbed Foreign Film\") entailed more media attention. Both episodes included video of penises, in the first case a fake penis, in the second case the real thing. When these episodes were held for review, it got into local newspapers.\n\nPack found the library's review procedures to be unclear and decried the \"policy void\" as \"unacceptable, and perhaps even unconstitutional.\"\n\nCATS has since established itself as a \"dedicated constitutional forum,\" in part because of these disputes.\n\nAnother side effect to these clashes was to galvanize the producers. When two of the episodes were held back for review, Everson and Nickell chose to run a looping message in their place, which asked viewers to write in. \"Our mailbox was stuffed for the next few weeks,\" Everson wrote twenty years after the fact. \"Suddenly we became aware that we had an audience.\"\n\nIn April 1994, episode 59 generated the show's biggest controversy to date, when the hosts smoked marijuana in front of the Monroe County Courthouse, as a way of dramatizing the argument for legalization. (Marijuana was illegal everywhere in the United States at the time.) The story was covered by all three network affiliates in Indianapolis (the nearest large market) with clips from \"Rox\" landing on \"The Howard Stern Show\" and, eventually, in MTV's documentary, \"Straight Dope: An MTV News Special Report on Drugs\".\n\n\"Local response was mostly positive,\" however not everyone was impressed. The Indiana Governor's Commission for a Drug-Free Indiana attempted to shut the show down, with executive director Joseph E. Mills III accusing the producers of \"the overt promotion of anarchy.\"\n\nUndeterred, \"Rox\" responded with episode 64, \"The Overt Promotion of Anarchy,\" which reveled in the designation, explored the political philosophy of anarchism, documented police brutality at a Critical Mass bicycle ride, and provided explicit instructions on how to construct a \"red box\" for circumventing payphone fees on long-distance calls. This segment generated some attention from Indianapolis television news and newspapers.\n\n"}

It is owned by the Indian Wells Valley Airport District and serves the Indian Wells Valley area. The airport is mostly used for general aviation and was previously served by a number of commuter and regional airlines over the years with passenger flights to Los Angeles (LAX).\n\nAs per Federal Aviation Administration records, the airport had 11,149 passenger boardings (enplanements) in calendar year 2008, 11,081 enplanements in 2009, and 11,109 in 2010. It is included in the National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2011–2015, which categorized it as a \"primary commercial service\" airport (more than 10,000 enplanements per year).\n\nAs early as the mid 1950s, Inyokern had scheduled passenger air service operated by Southwest Airways with Douglas DC-3 aircraft twice a day on weekdays nonstop to Burbank Airport (BUR, now Bob Hope Airport) in the Los Angeles area. According to the March 11, 1954, Southwest Airways system timetable, this DC-3 service was \"operated under and subject to terms of U.S. Navy Contract\". Southwest Airways then changed its name to Pacific Air Lines which in 1960 was operating nonstop DC-3 service to Los Angeles International Airport (LAX). By 1964, Pacific was operating Martin 4-0-4 propliners from the airport to LAX. In 1968, Pacific Air Lines merged with Bonanza Air Lines and West Coast Airlines to form Air West which at this time was operating Fairchild F-27 turboprops from Inyokern to Los Angeles via a stop at Fox Field in Lancaster, CA. Air West then changed its name to Hughes Airwest which continued to serve the airport with F-27 propjet flights to LAX via Lancaster. In 1968, Cable Commuter Airlines was operating de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter turboprops to LAX in competition with Air West.\n\nFollowing the cessation of service by Hughes Airwest in the early 1970s, a number of commuter and regional airlines served the airport over the years with scheduled passenger flights to Los Angeles International Airport (LAX). Schedules in the Official Airline Guide (OAG) from 1974 through 2007 list flights operated at various times over the years by American Eagle (operated by Wings West Airlines), C&M Airlines, Cable Commuter Airlines, Delta Connection (operated by SkyWest Airlines), Desert Sun Airlines, Golden West Airlines, Indian Wells Airlines, Mojave Airlines, and United Express (initially operated by Mesa Airlines and later by SkyWest Airlines). These OAGs also list the various turboprop aircraft types that were operated by most of the above airlines into the airport including the Beechcraft C99 (Desert Sun and Mojave Airlines), the Beechcraft 1900C (Mesa Airlines), the British Aerospace BAe Jetstream 31 (Wings West), the de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter (Cable Commuter Airlines and Golden West), the Embraer EMB-120 Brasilia (SkyWest) and the Fairchild Swearingen Metroliner (SkyWest and Wings West). C&M Airlines and Indian Wells Airlines operated small Cessna prop aircraft. Scheduled passenger airline service ended following the cessation of United Express flights operated by SkyWest in November 2013.\n\nOn July 7, 2017, airport officials awarded a contract to Boutique Air to begin daily flights to Los Angeles International Airport starting August 8, 2017. On October 12, 2017, the Indian Wells Valley Airport District board of directors voted to terminate its contract with Boutique Air following a 60-day notice.\n\nThe Inyokern Airport Dragstrip opened in 1954, and was the second oldest continuously operating dragstrip in the United States, behind Thornhill Dragstrip in Kenton, KY which opened in 1953. The drag strip closed during the 2005 season due to new Federal Aviation Administration regulations.\n\nBeginning in the 1950s, regular glider records were set out of Inyokern in various sources of lift. Due to its location on the lee side of the Sierra Nevada mountain range, it is an excellent location for altitude records in wave conditions or distance and speed records in thermal lift. It is a challenging location, as the winds change frequently, but with three long runways pilots generally have a variety of options for launch and landing. Many well known pilots have flown gliders out of Inyokern, including Neil Armstrong, Paul Bikle, and Steve Fossett.\n\nPresently Inyokern Airport is the home to Sierra Soaring Club, which operates a Cessna 182 for towing gliders, a Blanik L-23 for rides and instruction, and a Schweizer 1-35 and Standard Cirrus for wave flights and cross country soaring.\n\nIn the wake of the drag strip's closing, the airport has been actively promoting its use for film shoots, with the Ridgecrest Regional Film Commission marketing its (Runway 28) as \"the region's #1 filming location\". A notable example of this new use is a television advertisement titled \"Gravity\", for the Lexus IS. The airdrop \"target\" featured in the commercial, where the falling automobile hits the ground, was painted on the old drag strip; however, many of the vehicle shots preceding the car drop actually feature the Lexus rolling down runway 20. Other notable automotive television ads shot here include most spots from Saab's \"Born from Jets\" campaign, as well as spots for Volkswagen, Volvo, Cadillac, Nissan, Mazda, Toyota, Ford, and Chevrolet, just to name a few.\n\nInyokern Airport covers an area of at an elevation of above mean sea level. It has three asphalt paved runways: 15/33 is , 2/20 is , and 10/28 is 4,150 by 75 feet (1,265 x 23 m).\n\nFor the 12-month period ending December 31, 2010, the airport had 28,573 aircraft operations, an average of 78 per day: 80% general aviation, 10% military, 6% air taxi, and 5% scheduled commercial. At that time there were 117 aircraft based at this airport: 84% single-engine, 9% multi-engine, 5% glider, and 3% ultralight.\n\n\n"}

It is located in the borough of Altona and is the westernmost quarter in the Hamburg, bordering the German federal state of Schleswig-Holstein in the west, north, and northeast and the Elbe river to the south. In 2016, the population was 15,000.\n\nRissen was first officially mentioned in 1255, being named \"Risne\". For centuries, Rissen was a part of the County of Holstein-Pinneberg, which would have made it a part of the modern German state of Schleswig-Holstein. In 1789, the local government bought a section of Rissen called Klövensteen and let it become a large forest. Until now, this forest is still called \"Staatsforst Klövensteen\" (\"Klövensteen state forest\"). In the 19th century, the locally well-known shipowner Johan Cesar V. Godeffroy purchased a significant portion of the area and dedicated it to become his personal hunting grounds.\n\nIn 1927, Rissen became a part of the city of Altona which was then a separate, independent city. In 1938, Altona was incorporated into the city of Hamburg by law through the enactment of the Greater Hamburg Act. As a result, Rissen also became a part of Hamburg.\nIn 2006 according to the statistical office of Hamburg and Schleswig-Holstein, Rissen has a total area of 16.6 km². It shares borders with the Schleswig-Holstein towns of Wedel, Pinneberg, and Schenefeld in the west, north, and northeast, respectively, and with Hamburg's quarters Sülldorf and Blankenese in the east. To the south, the river Elbe forms a natural border. South of the river lies the German federal state of Lower Saxony. Rissen is situated on the right bank of the river.\n\nFrom south to the north, Rissen is about three times as long as from the west to the east.\n\nIn the north of Rissen lies a large forested area, the so-called Klövensteen which is a popular place for recreational activities like walking, jogging, riding, etc.\n\nIn 2007, 14,440 people were living in Rissen. The population density was 864 people per km². 16.6% were children under the age of 18, and 29.2% were 65 years of age or older. 6% were immigrants. 220 people were registered as unemployed. In 1999 there were 7,185 households out of which 18.8% had children under the age of 18 living with them and 42.1% of all households were made up of individuals. The average household size was 2.05.\n\nPopulation by year\nThere were 2 elementary schools and 2 secondary schools in the quarter Rissen.\n\nThe Honorary Consulate of Haiti established in Hamburg 1951 is located at Tinsdaler Kirchenweg 275a.\n\nThe \"Asklepios Westklinikum Hamburg\" is a general hospital with 452 beds in Rissen.

Its capital is the town of Cilacap.\n\nCilacap Regency covers an area of 2,124.47 km, and it had a population of 1,642,107 at the 2010 Census; the latest estimate (as of January 2014) is 1,662,248. The language used in Cilacap is the Javanese language, but most people can speak Indonesian. The dialect used is Banyumasan.\n\nThere are schools of all levels in Cilacap and several higher-learning institutions, but no university. There are several academies such as Akademi Maritim Nusantara (National Maritime Academy). A polytechnic, called Politeknik Cilacap, was established in 2008 and offers education in Engineering, Electronics and Informatics.\n\nCilacap Regency comprises twenty-four districts (\"kecamatan\"), tabulated below with their populations at the 2010 Census:\n\nThe town of Cilacap is also a sea port on the southern coast of the island of Java. The port is one of only a few that exist on the southern coast that can service shipping of reasonable tonnage. The nearest safe anchorage east is Pacitan. The city's harbor is protected by Nusakambangan, an island best known as the site of several high-security correctional facilities although there are also hopes that the island can be developed as a tourist hub. Nusakambangan sheltered Cilacap from the worst of the 2004 tsunami. Nevertheless, the disaster took 147 lives, devastated beaches, damaged 435 fishing boats and inflicted material losses amounting to about Rp 86 billion (around $9 million).\n\nDuring World War II Cilacap was an important departure point for people fleeing the Japanese invasion, especially Dutch colonists. Many left the Dutch East Indies by boat or seaplane, the majority heading for Broome in Western Australia.\n\nThe port is a hub for national or international trade. The town's Tunggul Wulung Airport provides scheduled airline services to Jakarta and Semarang.\n\nCilacap is the site of many industrial plants, a geothermal power plant, a cement plant (Holcim Indonesia), and one of Pertamina (Indonesia's national petroleum company) processing units in Indonesia. The site has the largest production capacity, producing the most diverse kinds of products among other Pertamina units.\n\nThe town of Cilacap offers several tourist attractions highlighting Banyumasan culture. The town has a number of beaches, two of the most popular being Teluk Penyu (close to the center of town), but these are somewhat fouled from leakage of the shipping vessels docked adjacent to this and Widara Payung. Nearby the Teluk Penyu beach is also an ancient Dutch fortress called Benteng Pendem. This fortress was built in stages during 1861-1879 by the Dutch East Indies Army.\n\nIn early 2012 Segara Anakan Bay area is only 600 hectares from 700 hectares in 2005 after dredging. Heavy sedimentation from Citanduy River which is located in border of Ciamis Regency and Cilacap Regency caused it. To overcome the sedimentation in Segara Anakan Bay, Ciamis Regency has agreed, if a new canal from Citanduy River pass their area and exit in Nusawiru near Pangandaran Beach.\n"}

It was released as a single on March 1, 2004 and is Juvenile's only number one hit on the U.S. \"Billboard\" Hot 100. The song is an original production by Dani Kartel. It held the number-one position on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 for two weeks from August 7, 2004, and was the first number one for both Juvenile and Soulja Slim. It was the seventh song to reach number 1 posthumously for a credited artist and also the first number 1 hit for Cash Money Records.\n\nAlthough not planned as a tribute, it came out as one of the more popular posthumous songs because of Soulja Slim's sudden death in November 2003, before the recording process was released (though the beat and lyrics had already been recorded by Soulja).\n\nThe \"slow motion\" of the title is the movement of a woman's body, with the lyrics proclaiming: \"\"Uh, I like it like that / She working that back; I don't know how to act / Slow motion for me, slow motion for me / Slow motion for me; move it slow motion for me\"\".\n\nAccording to \"Billboard\", the song is about sex.\n\nIn the video, everyone wears black T-shirts with \"R.I.P. Soulja Slim\" in white text on the front and back. There are also people holding \"Thou shall not kill\" paperboard signs. In the middle of the video there are cameo appearances by the rappers Birdman and Lil Wayne, signalling the end of animosity between Juvenile and Cash Money.\n\nOriginally affiliated with the Cash Money roster, as a result of the huge success of the single Juvenile was signed to Atlantic Records shortly after topping the Billboard chart. The song was produced by Cash Money, but with the new deal a complementary contract was also signed allowing Juvenile to bring his newly formed UTP (Up Town Projects) label to Atlantic. The production on the album with the Williams duo was considered a one-time collaboration from then on.\n\n\n"}

In 1675 he joined Cossack military service under Hetman Ivan Samoylovych and distinguished himself in Russo-Turkish War of 1676–1681 and once again in the Crimean expedition against the Ottoman Empire and Crimean Khanate in 1688.\n\nIvan Skoropadsky was briefly an ambassador representing Cossack Hetmanate in negotiations with the Russian Tsar Peter the Great. During the Great Northern War Skoropadsky was a Cossack colonel of the Ukrainian Starodub regiment and after Swedish army crossed into Ukraine in 1708, refused to join Ivan Mazepa who decided to switch sides and fight against Russia. Only about 3,000 Cossacks, mostly Zaporozhians, followed Mazepa, while others remained loyal to the Tsar. With Mazepa deposed, Ivan Skoropadsky was elected as new Hetman on 11 November 1708. The fear of other reprisals and suspicion of Mazepa's newfound Swedish ally Charles XII prevented most of Ukraine's population from siding with the rebels.\n\nIvan Skoropadsky moved the capital of the Cossack Hetmanate from Baturyn which was razed by the Russian army for Mazepa's rebellion, to the town of Hlukhiv. Following Mazepa's defeat in the Battle of Poltava, Skoropadsky thought to regain Peter I's trust and yet negotiate greater autonomy for the Hetmanate and greater rights for the Cossack nobility, often resisting Peter the Great's policy of incorporation of the Hetmanate lands into the Russian Empire. His careful negotiations allowed him to achieve both, and the Hetmanate regained much of its lost prominence.\n\nIn 1718 his daughter married Count Pyotr Pyotrovich Tolstoy, the son of Pyotr Andreyevich Tolstoy (a prominent Russian statesman) and Ivan Skoropadsky was granted numerous estates in Ukraine becoming its largest land-owner. The Hetman had no male children but Pavlo Skoropadsky, a descendant of his brother, briefly ruled Ukraine 200 years later, and also carried the title of Hetman in his Hetmanate-influenced government.\n\n\n"}

The \"Empire Windrush\" carried almost 500 passengers from Jamaica, including Lord Kitchener, a calypso singer from Trinidad. By chance, a local newsreel company filmed him singing \"London Is The Place For Me\" as he got off the ship. In 2002, \"London Is The Place For Me: Trinidadian Calypso, 1950-1956\" was finally released in Britain. The 1951 Festival of Britain brought the Trinidad All Steel Percussion Orchestra (TAPSO) and Roaring Lion to public attention. The smart set in Oxford and Cambridge adopted both calypso and steelband for debutante parties. In 1959, Trinidadian Claudia Jones started the Notting Hill Carnival. They brought Mighty Sparrow and others directly from Trinidad. Edric Connor had arrived in England from Trinidad in 1944. He starred in a West End musical called \"Calypso\" in 1948. A white Danish duo, Nina & Frederik, recorded several calypsos from 1958 to 1962, scoring in the charts. Cy Grant (from Guyana) sang a song by Lord Kitchener in the TV drama \"A Man From the Sun\" in 1956. It told the story of Caribbean migrants. From 1957 to 1960, Grant sang calypsos on the BBC TV news programme \"Tonight\". In 1962. English comedian Bernard Cribbins had a hit with \"Gossip Calypso\".\n\nCecil Bustamante Campbell (Prince Buster) was born in 1938 in Orange Street, Kingston, Jamaica. In 1961 he signed to Blue Beat records.\n\nIn 1962, Jamaica won its independence and Island Records was founded. One of the record label's producers, Chris Blackwell, brought Millie Small to Britain in 1963. Her high-pitched, slightly nasal voice had wide appeal with \"My Boy Lollipop\", which reached number 2 in the UK. It was perceived as a novelty pop song, not the start of a boom in ska. It was not until 1969 that reggae artists began to receive significant airplay. Dave and Ansell Collins, Ken Boothe and John Holt had hits.\n\nSymarip (also known at various stages of their career as The Bees, The Pyramids, Seven Letters and Zubaba) were a ska and reggae band from the United Kingdom, originating in the late 1960s, when Frank Pitter and Michael Thomas founded the band as The Bees. The band's name was originally spelled Simaryp, which is an approximate reversal of the word pyramids.[1] Consisting of members of West Indian descent, Simaryp is widely marked as one of the first skinhead reggae bands, being one of the first to target skinheads as an audience. Their hits included \"Skinhead Girl\", \"Skinhead Jamboree\" and \"Skinhead Moonstomp\", the latter of which was based on the Derrick Morgan song, \"Moon Hop\"\n\nTrojan Records was founded in 1967, named after producer Duke Reid, known as \"The Trojan.\" It brought Jamaican recordings to Britain. Their first hit was Jimmy Cliff's \"Wonderful World, Beautiful People\" in 1969. The label had 28 other hits.\n\nThe first Jamaican performers to reach number one in Britain were Desmond Dekker and the Aces with \"Israelites\" in 1969. The second act was Althea & Donna with \"Up Town, Top Ranking\" in 1977. Bob Marley came from Jamaica to London and recorded \"Catch a Fire\" in 1972, returning to record \"Exodus\" and \"Kaya\" in 1977. Eddy Grant was born in Guyana in 1948 and grew up in Brixton. He was part of The Equals, the first multi-racial group to reach number 1 in the UK, with \"Baby come Back\" in 1968. He took Caribbean music further in the direction of rock than anyone else. His gritty voice took \"Electric Avenue\" to the top 10 twice. His studio in Barbados has been used by Sting and Elvis Costello.\n\nRoots reggae was increasingly popular with the UK's black working-class youth from the 1970s onwards, its message of Rastafari and overcoming injustice striking a chord with those on the receiving end of racism and poverty. Jamaicans who had settled in the UK (and their children who had been born here) were instrumental in setting up a network of reggae soundsystems. The most popular soundsystems included Jah Shaka, Coxsone Outernational, Fatman, Jah Tubbys and Quaker City.\n\nA number of producers such as Dennis Bovell and Mad Professor began to record UK and Jamaican artists and release their records.\n\nBands such as Aswad, Steel Pulse, Misty In Roots and Beshara released records and played gigs throughout the UK.\n\nAs roots music's popularity waned in Jamaica in the 1980s, soundsystems such as Jah Shaka kept the faith in the UK, influencing a new generation of producers, soundsystems and artists, including The Disciples, Irration Steppas, Jah Warrior and The Rootsman. This scene has been referred to as \"UK Dub\".\n\nThe 1990s saw a resurgence of interest in 70s roots reggae and dub with a number of UK-based specialist labels such as Pressure Sounds, Soul Jazz and Blood & Fire being set up to re-release classic recordings.\n\n\"Punky Reggae Party\" is a song written by Bob Marley as a positive response to the emerging UK punk scene.\n\nRoots and Dub music gained popularity with UK punks in the mid-70s, with Don Letts playing reggae records alongside punk ones at the Roxy nightclub and Johnny Rotten citing Dr Alimantado's \"Born for a Purpose\" as one of his favourite records in a radio interview. After the Sex Pistols split, Rotten was sent to Jamaica by Virgin Records as a talent scout for their Frontline reggae sub-label.\n\nThe Clash started out as a straight-ahead punk rock group, but their first album covered \"Police & Thieves\", a reggae track by Junior Murvin. Their bass player Paul Simonon was a reggae enthusiast. Increasingly the group took significant influence from reggae, on tracks such as The Guns of Brixton, which used themes of impoverished criminality and a renegade lifestyle, with a punky edge. Their track \"White Man In Hammersmith Palais\" was written about the group's experience at a reggae dance. Jamaican reggae producer Lee Perry was brought in to produce the tune \"Complete Control\".\n\nThe Ruts recorded the reggae-inspired \"Babylon's Burning\", \"Jah War\", \"Love in Vein\" and \"Give Youth a Chance\", while The Members recorded similar white reggae tracks such as \"Don't Push\" and \"Offshore Banking Business\". The Boomtown Rats similarly released a number of reggae-inspired records, such as \"Banana Republic\" and later \"House on Fire\".\n\nTowards the end of the 1970s, punk and reggae groups would appear on the same bills at Rock Against Racism events.\n\nWhile most of the developments in the music took place in Jamaica (dub, toasting, dancehall, ragga) there was one form that was born in Britain. Lovers rock, developed in the 1970s, was a smooth, soulful version of reggae, spearheaded by Dennis Brown.\n\nThe early years of \"lovers rock\" have two main resonances: London \"blues parties\" and discs by girl singers who sounded as if they were still worrying about their school reports. The record that kick-started the phenomenon was the 14-year-old Louisa Mark's plaintive reading of Robert Parker's soul hit, \"Caught You In A Lie\", with Matumbi as backing group and production by sound-system man Lloyd Coxsone (b. Lloyd Blackwood, Jamaica); this appeared on Coxsone's Safari imprint in 1975 and was impressive enough to see release in Jamaica by Gussie Clake. Several of Louisa Mark's subsequent titles, including \"All My Loving\" (Safari) and \"Six Sixth Street\" (Bushays), repeated the success and have remained favourites at revive sessions ever since.\n\nMark's hit was followed by Ginger Williams' \"Tenderness\" (Third World), and a genre was born-essentially Philly/Chicago soul ballads played over fat reggae basslines. The style was consolidated by the husband-and-wife team of Dennis and Eve Harris who had a big hit with the white singer T.T. Ross's massively popular \"Last Date\" (Lucky), another key record, and set up a new imprint, Lover's Rock, giving the genre its name.\n\nLater labels such as Fashion Records and Ariwa would go on to take lovers rock to more sophisticated plains and beyond the music's original market of working-class teenagers. and while the music media largely ignored their performers-singers like Peter Hunnigale, Sylvia Tella, Michael Gordon and Keith Douglas they have deservedly scored hit after hit with audiences who trust what they hear rather than read.\n\nThe influence of reggae was felt in rock almost immediately, but usually surfaced as a tangential reference in some stars' isolated songs. The Beatles song 1964 \"I Call Your Name,\" for instance, has a ska break; a few years later, they would appropriate the reggae rhythm for 1968 \"Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da\".\n\nChris Andrews (born 1942) was a songwriter for Sandie Shaw. The song \"Yesterday Man\" was inappropriate for her, so he sang it himself and it went to number 3 in the UK Singles Chart in 1965. At the time, the musical style was called bluebeat, a music genre that is now recognized by most as ska or reggae. He followed this with \"To Whom It Concerns\" (number 13 in 1965) and \"Something on My Mind\" (number 41 in 1966).\n\nPaul McCartney bought Jamaican-imported singles, but this was not obvious in The Beatles' repertoire until \"Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da\" on the \"White Album\". There was a gentle reggae beat in some of his later solo singles, such as \"Another Day\" and \"Silly Love Songs\". He also named one of his Christmas song covers \"Rudolph The Red-Nosed Reggae\". Other pop hits include \"Sugar, Sugar\" by the Archies (number 1 in 1969) and \"I Can See Clearly Now\" by Johnny Nash (number 5 in 1972). Also in the mid-1970s, art rockers 10cc released a few reggae-styled singles, including \"Dreadlock Holiday\".\n\nSka/reggae artist Judge Dread (named after a Prince Buster character) released his first single in 1972; the somewhat X-rated \"Big Six\", which went to number 11. Judge Dread (born Alexander Hughes) continued his popularity with other rude songs, chiefly enjoyed by skinheads, who had always been avid fans of ska and reggae. Skinheads were preceded by the mods, who were the first real white supporters of ska/bluebeat in the 1960s. Georgie Fame, a mod R&B favourite, popularised a ska feel in his music at times.\n\nThe Police's first reggae single was \"Roxanne\", followed by \"Can't Stand Losing You\", \"So Lonely\", \"Walking on the Moon\" and others. Sting's somewhat interesting Jamaican accent attracted criticism, but the band was commercially successful. Blondie's \"The Tide is High\" was perhaps the first big white reggae hit in Britain and also draws on the lovers rock elements of reggae. Both Harry Belafonte and Nina & Frederik had hits with \"Mary's Boy Child\", but it was Boney M who gave this slow ballad a reggae rhythm in 1978 and took it to number 1 in the UK Singles Chart for four weeks.\n\nMore long-term success was achieved by UB40, of Birmingham. They started life performing reggae-influenced material of their own creation, but their biggest contribution is perhaps covering songs, whether that was reggae originals made into their own, or non-reggae songs that they were able to cross-over into the genre. \"Kingston Town\", \"I Got You Babe\", \"Many Rivers to Cross\" and \"Here I Am (Come and Take Me)\" are a few of the more famous examples they did. Their chart-topping cover of \"Red Red Wine\" was an accident of sorts - they knew a reggae version of the song, but were unaware that the American pop singer Neil Diamond was its original author.\n\n2 Tone Records, founded in 1979, combined ska, reggae and rock, which evolved out of punk rock, spawning the 2 Tone movement with bands such as The Specials, The Selecter, Madness and The Beat. The 2-Tone sound continued and evolved into the 1980s, with bands such as The Hot Knives, The Loafers and Potato 5.\n\nGospel Music although a subgenre of black music in the UK today also arrived in England in the early post-war years, along with the large-scale immigrant influx and their wide variety of musical tastes. Pioneers in this field include an eight-piece a cappella family group from Trinidad called the Singing Stewarts - Oscar Stewart, Ashmore Stewart, Frankie Stewart, Phylis Stewart, Gloria Stewart, Timothy Stewart, Thedore Stewart and Del Stewart - who were the first to appear on a major British record label in the late 1960s. They impressed many English audiences with their unique interpretation of Negro spirituals and traditional Gospel songs. Based in Birmingham in the Midlands they appeared on numerous radio shows and participated in the prestigious Edinburgh Festival, again increasing awareness of this genre.\n\nIn later years and decades when black people began to settle in the UK, groups such as The Doyleys, Paradise, Lavine Hudson and the Bazil Meade-inspired London Community Gospel Choir began to drive the music much further towards the mainstream and out of the comfort zone of the black churches.\n\nThe Singing Stewarts are featured in the book \"British Black Gospel: The Foundations of This Vibrant UK Sound\" by Steve Alexander Smith. The Huddersfield-born Smith was inspired to write the book after spending time in the US in the mid 1990s and witnessing the best that black gospel could offer.\n\nThe book is the world's first to cover the underground British Black gospel scene and is published with a 13-track CD.\n\nWhile many immigrants from the Caribbean brought with them the folk music of the area, it was not until the 1960s when The Spinners a folk group from Liverpool, England, who were the first multiracial singing group to have a major success in the UK brought Caribbean folk music into the mainstream. Cliff Hall, their West Indian singer and guitarist, born in Cuba and brought up in Jamaica, brought many songs from the Caribbean to their repertoire including \"Woman Sweeter Than Man\", \"Matty Rag\" and \"Linstead Market\".\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2042174", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2042174", "title": "Toxic!", "text": "Toxic!\n\nToxic! is a British comic book that was published weekly from March 28 to October 24, 1991 by Apocalypse Ltd, with a total of 31 issues.\n\n\"Toxic!\" was the idea of Pat Mills, Kevin O'Neill, Mike McMahon, John Wagner and Alan Grant. The aim was to provide creators an outlet for their work to be published with them retaining the rights and control of their work. This was in contrast to \"2000 AD\", which Mills had also launched in 1977. \"Toxic!\" was to be the main rival of \"2000 AD\", and would be in full colour throughout as opposed to \"2000AD\", which was still mainly published in black and white.\n\n\"Toxic!\" was published by Apocalypse Ltd, an offshoot of Neptune Distribution based in South Wigston, Leicester. Neptune also owned Trident Comics which printed black and white comics by mainly new, unpublished creators.\n\nThe first title released by Apocalypse was a \"Marshal Law\" special titled \"Kingdom of the Blind\" published in October 1990. This was followed by the first issue of \"Toxic!\" in March 1991.\n\"Toxic!\" was initially dominated by Mills (Mills had rejected John Wagner's proposal for \"Button Man\" based on its supposed similarity to \"Accident Man\". It later appeared in \"2000 AD\"). His \"Marshal Law\" strip was seen as the flagship title and a character to perhaps rival Judge Dredd. Mills also wrote \"Accident Man\" (with Tony Skinner) and \"Muto-Maniac\" in the first issue, which was rounded out by a short strip by Alan Grant and Simon Bisley.\n\nThis first issue set the tone of \"Toxic!\" as it upped the levels of violence, bad language and general anarchic tone that Mills had felt was lacking in \"2000AD\" at the time. The second issue saw Wagner and Grant's \"The Bogie Man\" strip start in an adventure called \"The Chinese Syndrome\". The strip did not fit comfortably with the others and \"The Chinese Syndrome\" stopped suddenly with issue nine, and a different story \"The Manhattan Project\") started with issue eleven. The second issue also saw the launch of the love-it-or-loathe-it strip \"The Driver\" co-written and co-drawn by David Leach and Jeremy Banx, one episode of the which resulted in a visit by the local constabulary to the offices of Toxic after a complaint from an offended reader about Toxic containing obscene material. Issue #15 saw the start of \"The Dinner Ladies From Hell\" written and drawn by David Leach, described as a cross between Dennis Wheatley and Robert Rankin.\n\nThis was not the only strip which suffered problems, \"Marshal Law\" began to miss issues, and some of the material replacing it proved not to be as popular. Some strips meant to be published by Trident Comics were even used to provide filler material. This hurt the title as although it had sold well initially, sales were dropping and it became clear that there were problems with Apocalypse paying creators. These problems meant many creators such as Mike McMahon saw work published which he had not been paid for. After 31 issues the comic was cancelled and shortly afterward Apocalypse went bankrupt. This meant many involved were never paid and some of those never worked in comics again.\n\nIn September 2002 Egmont UK launched a boy's magazine entitled \"Toxic\" which has proven to be very popular, but apart from the title, there is no connection with the comic of the nineties. However, Toxic magazine does contain some comic strips of the juvenile toilet humour variety.\n\n\"Toxic!\" may have ended up being a failure but it proved a full colour weekly comic could be done. This changed \"2000AD\" as it was forced to change its format to mirror the full colour format of \"Toxic!\". It also gave some creators their first major break into comics, Mike Carey being one of several examples.\n\nSeveral strips did go off to other publishers. Mills took \"Marshal Law\", \"Sex Warrior\" and \"Accident Man\" to Dark Horse, Wagner and Grant took \"The Bogie Man\" to Atomeka Press, and several other strips were recycled in \"2000AD\".\n\n"}

Instead of balls, other spherical objects can be used, such as balloons. It is typically employed as a recreation and exercise for children.\n\nBall pits are often found at nurseries, carnivals, amusement parks, fun centers, fast-food restaurants, and large video arcades. Chuck E. Cheese's and (now defunct) Discovery Zone formerly had ball pits and they were frequently incorporated into larger play structures, such as mazes, slides, and jungle gyms.\n\nBall pits may be rented for parties, and smaller versions are sold for use in the home. While ball pits are traditionally intended for children, some are large enough to accommodate adults.\n\nBall pits may be used together with a trampoline, or combining the two by filling a closed trampoline with the balls.\n\nIn 1976, Eric McMillan created the first ball pit at SeaWorld Captain Kids World in San Diego as a result of his experience at Ontario Place.\n\nBeginning in the late 1990s, a number of urban legends arose about children being severely injured or even killed due to ball-pit encounters with venomous snakes or hypodermic needles. Although there is no truth to these stories, workers have reported finding dirty diapers, half-eaten food and syringes in ball pits.\n\nIn China Miéville's short story \"The Ball Room\" (Looking for Jake)\",\" the ghost of a child who died in a ball pit haunts a local Ikea-like store.\n\nIn the \"Rugrats\" episode \"Piggy's Pizza Palace\", the Rugrats jump on a costumed pig named Piggy as an act of revenge to get Angelica's tickets back. It causes the ball pit structure to split right open and all of the balls fall out all over the restaurant.\n\nIn season 3 episode 14 (\"The Einstein Approximation\") of the TV series \"The Big Bang Theory\", Sheldon seeks inspiration in a ball pit at a mall, and then hides from Leonard, who spends a good amount of time and effort trying to retrieve Sheldon from the ball pit.\n\nIn 2014, a YouTube vlogger under the name Roman Atwood made a video of transforming the living room of his home into a massive ball pit, intended as a prank for his girlfriend who has returned from a trip. He later collaborates with another vlogger, Freddie Wong, to create a comedy video involving giant ball pit and \"ball monster\" prank.\n\nIn 2016, a pop-up \"ball pit bar\" opened in San Francisco.\n\n"}
{"id": "2042184", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2042184", "title": "Confessions Part II", "text": "Confessions Part II\n\n\"Confessions Part II\" is a song by R&B singer Usher, produced by Jermaine Dupri and Bryan-Michael Cox for Usher's fourth album \"Confessions\". Written by Usher, Dupri and Cox, the song is a confession of a man to his woman about his impregnated mistress. This is a continuation of \"Confessions Part I\" which relates to a man's infidelity. Its personal content evoked rumors and early responses from the public even before its release, believing that Usher was asserting the truth; however, Dupri divulged that the story behind the album is about himself.\n\n\"Confessions Part II\" received mixed reviews from critics. The song was released as the third single from the album, following the success of \"Burn\". The single reached number one on \"Billboard\" Hot 100 for two weeks, becoming the album's third consecutive number-one single. Internationally, the single had lesser success than the album's previous releases.\n\nWhen he started working on his fourth studio album \"Confessions\" after the release of his 2001 album \"8701\", Usher chose not to branch out much with musical collaborators; instead, he chose to continue creating music with his previous producers. He again enlisted producer-songwriter Jermaine Dupri, who had produced songs for Usher's two previous albums. Dupri approached Bryan-Michael Cox, asking him to become a collaborator. Cox has been a frequent partner of Dupri who had produced hits for Usher as well. Like \"Burn\", the second single from the album, Dupri and Cox conversed about a situation, creating the idea of the prospective song. However, they were concerned because they needed somebody to write such a song and they never thought Usher would do it. The concept became \"Confessions\".\n\nUsher started recording the song in July 2003 in New York City. One day, before the night was over, Usher was singing about impregnating a mistress and becoming displeased, having found that she is three months pregnant. The theme of cheating inspired him and Dupri, and they then decided to produce two parts of \"Confessions\": Part I and Part II. Usher said that the former is a \"dramatization where a guy confesses all the stuff he's been doing\" against his woman. The latter speaks of impregnating a mistress.\n\nWhile \"Confessions\" was still in production, Usher promised \"real talk\" in it. He decided \"to let it all hang out by singing about some of his own little secrets, as well as a few bones from his homies' skeleton-filled closets.\" He explained: \"All of us have our Pandora's boxes or skeletons in our closets. I let a few of them out, you know. I've got a lot to say. I've got a lot of things and stuff built in me that I just want to let go of.\" He further noted that, for the most part, the album's subject matter is \"very personal\". Dupri expected people to question some of the personal lyrics they associated in the song.\n\n\"Confessions Part II\" was released as the third single from the album, following \"Burn\". The single was released in the United States as a 12\" single on August 24, 2004. It was released in Germany on October 18, and Australia on October 26, 2004, featuring the album and remix version of the track and a song called \"Whatever I Want\". In the United Kingdom, it was a double A-side with \"My Boo\", the fourth single from the album. It was released in the country on December 28, 2004, and re-released on January 18, 2005.\n\nUsher held few listening parties for the album prior to its release. Shortly after, people came up with different interpretations of \"Confessions Part II\", among other personal songs in the album. In 2003, Usher's two-year relationship with TLC's Chilli was going to \"flame-out\", which partly contributed to the concept of \"Burn\". They finally broke up early in 2004 because of \"irreconcilable differences and because the two found it almost impossible to make compromises\" which partly triggered public speculation that some of the songs in the album are in reference to his personal struggle. They referred to the song speaking about Usher's \"infidelity\" to Chilli.\n\nAlongside the \"cheating\" rumors, the public inferred from the lyrics that Usher had impregnated a mistress in real life. Usher, however, emphasized that he was not in a relationship or \"got another girl pregnant\" and he was singing a \"character\". The similarity of situations he faced before and experiences of his friends collectively inspired him to write the song. In the middle of rumors, Dupri admitted that the stories behind the songs in the album are his. He stated, \"me cheating on my steady girlfriend, having a baby with that other woman and having to confess to everything that happened to my main girl.\" Behind rumors, Usher refuted in an interview with MTV News:\nPeople assume things, because as I said, I pull from my personal experiences to make my music ... I never experienced [fathering a child outside of a relationship] firsthand, but it's something I wanted to talk about  ... and it's something that has happened to me in the past ... As I said, I have a few deep, dark ones that I've kept stowed away in a closet for a minute ... That's why I take this time to speak to you guys and let you know really what it is ... I will tell you that I loved [Chilli] a lot and she obviously loved me; it just didn't work out. But cheating is not what caused the relationship to collide and crash. That ain't what broke it up.\n\n\"Confessions Part II\" is an R&B song composed in the key of F minor. Set in common time, the song is performed with a moderate groove. The song follows the chord progression of Dmaj-E-Fm, and Usher's voice spans from the low note of E to the high note of F. The lyrics are constructed in the inverted chorus-verse form. There are four choruses and two verses, and then a break between the third and final chorus which Usher speaks the lyrics.\n\nThe lyrics of \"Confessions Part II\" centers on a confession about impregnating a mistress. For the prelude, Usher tells his significant other that he impregnated his mistress. \"Confessions Part II\" apologizes what he had done in part one. Usher said of the song that right after he confessed with his real woman, he hoped she would still give him a chance. Dupri said that \"Confessions Part II\" is one of the songs which speak about breakups in relationships.\n\nMany critics found the song intriguing and came up with interpretations of it as well. Andrew McGregor of the BBC questioned if \"Confessions Part II\", as well as \"Truth Hurts\", are only \"mere theatre\" or telling the truth. Laura Sinagra of \"Rolling Stone\" focuses on how Usher admits in the song about impregnating a mistress. Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine commented that Usher was at an age when \"getting his 'chick on the side'\" seemed appropriate. Outside of rumors, Jem Aswad of \"Entertainment Weekly\" said that the best songs from the album were \"Confessions Part II\" and \"Burn\", which he described as having smooth melodies. Matt Cibula of Popmatters said of the flow of the concept does not work. He pointed out that in the second part, Usher claims he \"barely knows the other lady\", while in the first part, he already said that she was his ex-girlfriend. He furthered called it the \"wimpiest\" song on the theme of the album. Kelefa Sanneh of \"The New York Times\" called it a \"tricky infidelity narrative\".\n\n\"Confessions Part II\" was nominated for Best R&B/Soul, Male at the 2005 Soul Train Music Awards. At the 2005 American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers Pop Music Awards, Dupri received the ASCAP Golden Note Award for co-writing the song, alongside his many achievements and contributions to American popular music. British record company EMI was recognized as Publisher of the Year for the song, including \"Burn\" and songs by Alicia Keys, Beyoncé Knowles, Britney Spears.\n\n\"Confessions Part II\" lived up to the success of its predecessors in the United States, though not as overwhelmingly. The single debuted on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 at number 48, a higher entry than those of \"Yeah!\" and \"Burn\" did, while \"Yeah!\" was still at the top of the chart and \"Burn\" at number three. It peaked at number one on July 27, 2004, replacing \"Burn\"'s eighth non-consecutive chart run, and stayed there for two weeks. It failed to match the number of days at top spot of the previous two releases, and remained on the top ten for 13 weeks. The single left the chart after 25 weeks. The single was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America on for reaching half a million shipments.\n\nInternationally, \"Confessions Part II\" had lesser success. The single debuted at number five in Australia, becoming its highest entry, and failed to reach a higher position. The single reached number five in the United Kingdom, peaked at number seven in Ireland, and below top ten in the Netherlands and France, where it reached #43\n\nThe music video of \"Confessions Part II\" was co-directed by Usher and music video director Chris Robinson, who also directed the video for the album's fourth single, \"My Boo\". \"Confessions (Interlude)\" serves as the opening of the video. Set in a studio, Usher receives a phone message and finds out that he impregnated his mistress. After he speaks the spoken section of the interlude and gets in a car, \"Confessions Part II\" proceeds. Usher is set in a dark lit room, with only one chair. He occasionally shows a large ring on his ring finger. In the middle of the video, he lies on a piano and in his imagination, his woman and mistress are beside him. The next scene shows Usher in a brown car singing, goes out and kneels before his woman to confess. She refuses to listen and slaps Usher, then walks away. This led to Usher being sad and angry for losing his woman and becoming shirtless. Alone, Usher stands in front of a wide mirror, which breaks into pieces accompanied by a roaring sound, ending the same way \"Confessions Part II\" started, with him sitting on a chair.\n\nThe music video successfully charted on video programs. It debuted on MTV's \"Total Request Live\" on June 28, 2004, the same entry as \"Burn\". The music video reached number one on the countdown, and retired on September 15, 2004 at number seven. Like \"Yeah!\", \"Confessions Part II\" video remained on \"TRL\" for 50 days.\n\nThe official remix of \"Confessions Part II\" was included on the re-release of \"Confessions\", and features additional verses by Usher, Shyne (rapped his verse on the phone while in prison), Kanye West, Twista and Jermaine Dupri. The song is also parodied by \"Weird Al\" Yankovic on his album \"Straight Outta Lynwood\" (2006) as \"Confessions Part III\".\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2042202", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2042202", "title": "Malabar large-spotted civet", "text": "Malabar large-spotted civet\n\nThe Malabar large-spotted civet (\"Viverra civettina\"), also known as the Malabar civet, is a viverrid endemic to the Western Ghats of India. It is listed as Critically Endangered on the IUCN Red List as the population is estimated to number fewer than 250 mature individuals. It has not been recorded during surveys carried out between 1990 and 2014.\nIn the early 1990s, isolated populations still survived in less disturbed areas of South Malabar but were seriously threatened by habitat destruction and hunting outside protected areas.\n\nIt is known as \"Kannan chandu\" and \"Male meru\" in Kerala വെരുക് (veruk) in Malayalam, and in Karnataka as \"Mangala kutri\", \"Bal kutri\" and \"Dodda punugina\".\n\n\"Viverra civettina\" was the scientific name proposed by Edward Blyth in 1862 for a civet specimen from southern Malabar.\nReginald Innes Pocock considered \"V. megaspila\" and \"V. civettina\" to be distinct species. Ellerman and Morrison-Scott considered \"V. civettina\" a subspecies of \"V. megaspila\". IUCN Red List considers it a distinct species.\n\nThere is some controversy as to whether the Malabar civet is even native to the Western Ghats or whether it is a valid species. Background information for the specimens is scant, so there is little to no information on its ecology or habits. In spite of the heavy habitat destruction in the region, the civet still seems unusually threatened for a small, generalist carnivore. The region where the civet was known to occur is the site of a major trading port, formerly including the trade of civets such as the large-spotted civet. Due to this, there is some speculation on whether the Malabar civet is an introduced population of the large-spotted civet that eventually died off.\n\nThe Malabar large-spotted civet is dusky gray. It has a dark mark on the cheek, large transverse dark marks on the back and sides, and two obliquely transverse dark lines on the neck. These dark marks are more pronounced than in the large Indian civet. Its throat and neck are white. A mane starts between the shoulders. Its tail is ringed with dark bands. The feet are dark.\nIt differs from the large-spotted civet by the greater nakedness of the soles of the feet. The hairs on the interdigital webs between the digital pads form submarginal patches; the skin of the plantar pad is naked in front and at the sides. There are remnants of the metatarsal pads on the hind foot as two naked spots, the external a little above the level of the hallux, the internal considerably higher. A male individual kept in the Zoological Gardens of Trivandrum in the 1930s measured in head and body with a long tail and weighed .\n\nIn the 19th century, the Malabar civet occurred throughout the Malabar coast from the latitude of Honnavar to Kanyakumari. It inhabited the forests and richly wooded lowland, and was occasionally found on elevated forest tracts. It was considered abundant in Travancore.\n\nUntil the 1960s, extensive deforestation has reduced most of the natural forests in the entire stretch of the coastal Western Ghats.\nBy the late 1960s, the Malabar civet was thought to be near extinction. In 1987, one individual was sighted in Kerala.\n\nIn 1987, two skins were obtained near Nilambur in northern Kerala, an area that is dominated by cashew and rubber plantations. Two more skins were found in this area in 1990. These plantations probably held most of the surviving population, as these were little disturbed and provided a dense understorey of shrubs and grasses. Large-scale clearance for planting rubber trees threatened this habitat.\n\nInterviews conducted in the early 1990s among local hunters indicated the presence of Malabar civet in protected areas of Karnataka. During camera trapping surveys in lowland evergreen and semi-evergreen forests in the Western Ghats of Karnataka and Kerala from April 2006 to March 2007, no photographic record was obtained in a total of 1,084 camera trap nights.\n\nThe Malabar civet is considered nocturnal and so elusive that little is known about its biology and ecology apart from habitat use.\n\nUntil a few decades ago, local merchants in Kerala reared Malabar civets to obtain civetone, an extract from the scent gland, which was used in medicine, and as an aromatic.\n\nIt is now seriously threatened by habitat destruction and fragmentation. Until the 1990s, it was confined to remnant forests and disturbed thickets in cashew and rubber plantations in northern Kerala, where the hunting pressure was another major threat.\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent lockdown of India, a video clip of an unidentified civet walking the deserted streets of Meppayur was uploaded on Twitter. The civet was identified by its uploader as a Malabar civet and the clip subsequently went viral online. However, numerous experts identified the civet in the video as actually being the small Indian civet (\"Viverricula indica\"), a similar-looking but far more common species.\n\n"}

Merry in command.\n\nAfter fitting out, the ship departed Philadelphia on 16 December, headed for the West Indies, anchored off Havana on Christmas Day, and provided water for American warships operating in the area until sailing for home on 14 January 1899. She reached Philadelphia on the 18th and was decommissioned there on 1 February.\n\nRecommissioned on 22 August 1900, she sailed for the Far East—via the Atlantic, Mediterranean, Indian Ocean route—and arrived on the Asiatic Station early in December of that year. She furnished water and supplies to American warships and, in 1901, she carried relief supplies to Guam. During the first half of the following year, she made several trips to the Philippine Islands delivering passengers and supplies to Olongapo, Luzon. After one of these runs, she arrived at Manila on 4 July 1902 and prepared for the long voyage home. Getting underway on 9 August, she retraced the same general route she had used in coming to the Orient and stopped at Singapore and Aden en route to the Suez Canal which she reached on 15 September. Departing Port Said, Egypt on the 17th, she emerged from the Strait of Gibraltar 10 days later and reached Tompkinsville, N.Y., on Columbus Day.\n\nSome two months of operations preceded her arrival at Culebra, Puerto Rico on 14 December 1902. During most of the first half of 1903, \"Arethusa\" operated at San Juan and Ponce, before returning to Culebra on 14 June. She then began a long tour of duty as a \"water boat\" there which ended early in 1906 when she moored at Philadelphia to be placed out of service on 16 March.\n\nThe ship was given a civilian crew and, on 17 July, began providing water to ships of the Atlantic Fleet. On 29 November, she received a new naval complement and was recommissioned to serve with the small group of auxiliaries that had been selected to support the Great White Fleet during its forthcoming cruise around the world. After being fitted out at the Norfolk Navy Yard, the ship moved to Lambert Point, Virginia on 9 December 1907 and, two days later, sailed for the Pacific.\n\nProceeding down the Atlantic coast of South America, she rounded Cape Horn and steamed north to the Mare Island Navy Yard which she reached on 30 April 1908. Following voyage repairs and replenishment, \"Arethusa\" left the California coast on 17 June and reached Honolulu on the 30th.\n\nHowever, her service with the Great White Fleet did not take the ship beyond Hawaiian waters. Instead, she was reassigned to the Pacific Fleet, and on 30 July she got underway for San Francisco. She arrived at that port on 10 August, and remained in that vicinity until sailing on 1 October for Magdalena Bay, Mexico, where she anchored on the 6th and began supplying American warships there. During this period, she served briefly as the flagship of the Pacific Torpedo Flotilla. Her hold emptied, the ship got underway for San Francisco on 1 October, and — after reentering the Golden Gate — operated in nearby waters until decommissioned at Mare Island on 15 October 1909.\n\nThat same day, she was placed in service under a civilian crew and began preparations for a voyage back to the east coast. After departing San Francisco on 7 January 1910, she again sailed around South America and reached Hampton Roads on 29 March. Based at Norfolk, she issued oil to the ships of the Atlantic Fleet, primarily torpedo boat destroyers. She continued this duty until after the United States entered World War I, filling her tanks with oil at ports along the gulf coast and delivering it to bases in the Caribbean and on the Atlantic seaboard. During this phase of her career, she served with the fleet gathered off Veracruz, Mexico from 30 April – 7 June 1914.\n\nRecommissioned on 9 January 1918 for service in the Naval Overseas Transportation Service, \"Arethusa\" carried oil from the New York Navy Yard to the Azores where she issued it to destroyers and submarines. Upon returning to New York on 5 March, she spent more than a month undergoing repairs before sailing on 10 April.\n\nOn 15 April, \"Arethusa\" departed Bermuda for the Azores in a group that consisted of some 40 Allied ships led by the light cruiser . Shortly after leaving port, \"Arethusa\" collided with submarine HMS \"H-14\", necessitating \"H-14\"s return to Bermuda. The fleet tug towed \"H-14\" back to Bermuda on 18 April.\n\n\"Arethusa\" reached the Azores on the 27th and, but for a quick run to Bermuda and back in mid-May, operated there until returning to New York on 10 June. On 28 June, she began another mid-Atlantic deployment which took her twice to Bermuda and once to the Azores before she refilled her tanks at Port Arthur, Texas for another cargo of fuel oil which she once more issued in the Azores and at Bermuda before putting in at New York on 22 December, one month and 11 days after the signing of the Armistice stopped the fighting of World War I.\n\nAt New York, she filled her cargo tanks before sailing on 3 January 1919 for France. After topping off the fuel tanks of destroyers and submarine chasers operating out of Marseille, she headed for the Portuguese coast on 13 March and reached Lisbon on the 16th. From that port, she headed home via Gibraltar, the Azores, and Bermuda, supplying oil to warships whose bunkers were low, and arrived at Charleston, South Carolina, on 14 May. The following day, she entered the navy yard there for a thorough overhaul.\n\nDuring the ensuing three years of peacetime operations—primarily carrying oil from gulf ports to bases on the Atlantic seaboard—the ship was classified an oiler on 17 July 1920 and simultaneously designated AO-7. She was decommissioned at Boston on 28 June 1922 and sold on 7 July 1927 to Mr. Marshall B. Hall of Boston.\n\n"}

From 1992 to 2018 he taught graduate and undergraduate courses in media law, ethics, and politics.\n\nHe has focused much of his work on the critique of pornography and of masculinity, developed in his 2017 book, \"The End of Patriarchy: Radical Feminism for Men\". He also has written about white privilege and institutional racism. He also sits on the editorial board of the academic journal \"Sexualization, Media, and Society\".\n\nJensen grew up in Fargo, North Dakota.\n\nIn 1981, he received a Bachelor of Science degree from Moorhead State University (now Minnesota State University, Moorhead), and in 1985, he received a Master of Arts degree in journalism and public affairs from American University. In 1992 he completed his Ph.D. in media law and ethics in the School of Journalism and Mass Communication at the University of Minnesota.\n\nPrior to his academic career, he worked as a reporter and copy editor for several newspapers, including the \"St. Petersburg Times\" and the \"St. Paul Pioneer Press\".\n\nJensen writes for popular media, both alternative and mainstream. His opinion and analytic pieces on such subjects as foreign policy, politics, and race have appeared in papers around the U.S. He also is involved in a number of activist groups, including the Third Coast Activist Resource Center.\n\nJensen wrote an opinion piece for the \"Houston Chronicle\" on September 14, 2001, shortly after the September 11th terrorist attacks. In the piece, Jensen wrote that the September 11th terrorist attacks were \"reprehensible and indefensible\" but \"no more despicable than the massive acts of terrorism – the deliberate killing of civilians for political purposes – that the U.S. government has committed during my lifetime.\"\n\nJensen's piece drew both praise and criticism. Some individuals demanded that The University of Texas fire Jensen. In response, University of Texas President Larry Faulkner wrote in a letter to the editor published in the Houston Chronicle that he was \"disgusted by Jensen's article\" and called Jensen \"a fountain of undiluted foolishness on issues of public policy.\"\n\nIn early July 2014, MonkeyWrench Books collective cut all ties with Jensen over his article reviewing two feminist books that critiqued transgenderism. These books were Sheila Jeffreys' \"Gender Hurts: A Feminist Analysis of the Politics of Transgenderism\" and Michael Schwalbe's \"Manhood Acts: Gender and the Practices of Domination\". In the review published by \"Dissident Voice\", Jensen concluded that, \"On the surface, transgenderism may seem to be a more revolutionary approach, but radical feminism offers a deeper critique of the domination/subordination dynamic at the heart of patriarchy and a more promising path to liberation\" which they felt \"contributes to a dangerous culture of transphobia\". In addition, Dexter M. Thomas wrote a rebuttal which was also published by \"Dissident Voice\". Jensen responded by writing a follow-up article which elaborated on his views on the ecological and social implications of what he terms \"trans ideology\".\n\nJensen identifies as a radical Christian who rejects the supernatural claims of Christian orthodoxy. Jensen is married to musician Eliza Gilkyson.\n\nJensen is a socialist.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Sullivan (May 21, 1922 – October 23, 2019) was an American Catholic theologian and a Jesuit priest, best known for his research in the area of ecclesiology and the magisterium.\n\nFrancis \"Frank\" A. Sullivan was born in Boston on May 21, 1922, to George Edward and Bessie [Peterson] Sullivan, the second of four boys. (Contrary to his general bibliographical representation, his middle name is Alfred, not Aloysius. Another Jesuit, a classicist by the name of Francis Aloysius Sullivan, had already published his own work by the time Sullivan produced his own books. When Sullivan's \"Magisterium\" was submitted to the Library of Congress, they mistakenly identified him with this other Francis Sullivan, and assigned him that middle name, a circumstance to which he is ruefully resigned.) Raised in an actively Catholic household, Sullivan became interested in the possibility of life as a Jesuit and as a teacher through the influence of Jesuit instructors he admired at Boston College High School, as well as his uncle Louis Sullivan, a Jesuit teaching at what was then known as Weston College (now the Boston College School of Theology and Ministry). Because Sullivan had been passed up two grades early in his education, he finished at Boston College High School when he was barely 16 years old, and immediately entered the Jesuit novitiate in 1938, which then allowed entry as early as the age of 15.\n\nThe Jesuits' novitiate at that time was in the donated Berkshire Cottage known as Shadowbrook in Lenox, Massachusetts. The novitiate was devoted to spiritual instruction and development, concentrating on instruction in the tradition of the Society of Jesus and its spirituality, and being guided through the full, month-long experience of Ignatius of Loyola's Spiritual Exercises. The way Jesuit formation was structured at the time, the novitiate was followed by the juniorate, devoted to two years of classical studies, equivalent to the first two years of undergraduate education. This was followed by two years of studying philosophy at Weston College, in a program tied to, and very similar to, the classical B.A. at Boston College. Sullivan was awarded his B.A. from Boston College in the spring of 1944. Then after a further third year of philosophy at Weston, he received a master's degree in philosophy from Boston College in 1945.\n\nSullivan was now 23 years old, and was close to reaching his original goal of teaching high school. All Jesuits-in-training taught high school for three years as a matter of course during their formation, in what was called their Regency. Sullivan served for two years teaching high school Latin, English, and Algebra to the students in Fairfield, Connecticut, where the Jesuits had just recently opened Fairfield College Preparatory School in 1942. Sullivan's Regency was cut short because his Superior, John J. McEleney, S.J., had decided to prepare Sullivan for study in Patristics, with an eye toward his becoming a professor back at Weston College. He was therefore sent in 1947 to Fordham University in the Bronx for graduate work in Classics instead of the normal third year of teaching. With the possibility of becoming a teacher of Patristics before him, he wrote his Master's thesis on Clement of Alexandria's attitude toward Greek philosophy, and took his M.A. in 1948.\n\nSullivan then returned to Weston College to study theology for four years, leading to his priestly ordination in 1951, after the third year of theology had been completed. A fourth and final year of theology was then completed. Studying theology was a new experience for Sullivan, notably distinct from the classics focus of his education to this point, and was much more interesting as a subject matter to Sullivan than philosophy. His theological coursework was completed in 1952, and Father Sullivan was awarded the S.T.L. – the \"Sacrae Theologiae Licentiatus\" or Licentiate of Sacred Theology, which is the middle degree in the pontifical university system – by Weston College at the age of 30. He then took a break from his academic preparations for his \"Tertianship,\" the final year of Jesuit spiritual formation leading to the Jesuit Final Vows, which Sullivan did at a house the Jesuits had in Pomfret, Connecticut.\n\nCompleting his Jesuit formation in 1953, Sullivan now had an exciting new experience on the horizon: he was being sent abroad for his doctoral studies, to the Jesuit's first and central university, founded by Ignatius of Loyola himself in 1551, the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome. The new Provincial Superior who was sending Sullivan off on this next step was William E. Fitzgerald, who was perhaps unaware of Fr. McEleney's previous intention for Sullivan to teach Patristics, because now Fitzgerald was telling him that he would be returning to Weston to teach the part of the Fundamental Theology course dealing with Revelation. Making his way to Rome via Normandy, Paris and Lourdes with a group of Jesuit students, Sullivan excitedly soaked up both his first experience abroad and the new coursework.\n\nSullivan began to have a sense of his path becoming distinctive, because being sent abroad to the Gregorian for his doctoral work was his first major departure from the routine of regular Jesuit formation. Nevertheless, the shift in focus toward a goal of teaching Fundamental Theology and Revelation was less exciting for Sullivan, who would have preferred to carry on with the original idea of being a Patristics scholar, little knowing that he would actually end up in the field of Ecclesiology. At the Gregorian, Sullivan studied with two Ecclesiologists: the Dutch Sebastiaan Tromp and the Spaniard Timoteo Zapelena. Although he was in fact a Patristics scholar, Tromp was teaching the Theology of Revelation at the Gregorian. Ecclesiology at the time was centered on the text \"Mystici corporis Christi\" (often simply called \"Mystici corporis\"), the encyclical promulgated by Pope Pius XII on 29 June 1943, and Tromp was widely thought to have participated in the authoring of the text with the Pope. For all this ecclesiological work, Tromp was not the professor of Ecclesiology: that post was held by Zapelena. Sullivan noted that Zapelena held to a number of different points than were put forth in \"Mystici corporis\", and in that way began to experience the diversity of ecclesiological positions possible as demonstrated by his own teachers.\n\nFor his dissertation, Sullivan did not find a subject in the field of Fundamental Theology that caught his attention at the time, and so he drew on his already-existing interest in Patristics. He focused on Theodore of Mopsuestia's Christology, since it was sufficient that Sullivan had prepared in his coursework to be able to teach Fundamental Theology upon his return to Weston: the choice of subject for the project was not bound in any way to that destiny which his Superior had designated for him. Discovering that professors at either the Biblical Institute or the Oriental Institute could direct dissertations at the Gregorian, Sullivan wrote under the direction of Fr. Ignacio Ortiz de Urbina at the Oriental Institute, who had written on Theodore. Sullivan finished his task in 1955, but since his dissertation, \"The Christology of Theodore of Mopsuestia\", was not published until 1956, that is the date his degree was actually awarded. Having finished the work for the S.T.D. – the \"Sacrae Theologiae Doctor\" or Doctor of Sacred Theology, which is the final degree in the pontifical university system – Sullivan set off for Boston.\n\nHe was taking some of the summer to see more of Europe, as he did not have to be in Boston until August 1955, when he would also profess his Final Vows as a Jesuit. He was at the Jesuit house in Barcelona when an American friend arrived who surprised Sullivan with the news that Sullivan's assignment had changed: instead of teaching Fundamental Theology in Boston, he was listed as being assigned to Rome, although his friend knew nothing more than that. Sullivan wrote to his Superior, Fr. Fitzgerald and discovered that he had been tapped to teach Ecclesiology back at the Gregorian. Zapelena was approaching the mandatory retirement age of 75 and his health was declining. Afraid of a sudden gap in their faculty, the combination of Sullivan's availability and education was seized upon by the Gregorian University to guarantee that their program could continue uninterrupted. After a visit home, and feeling more than a little exiled, Sullivan returned to Rome to teach Ecclesiology at the Gregorian University, an academic ministry in which he would serve for the next 36 years, until his own mandatory retirement at the age of 70 in 1992.\n\nFrom 1956 until 1992, Sullivan was professor of ecclesiology at the Gregorian University, serving as dean from 1964 to 1970. Having been assigned to Rome unexpectedly, he received permission to take the fall semester of 1955 off, finishing work for the publication of his doctoral dissertation in Boston, and remaining close to his father, who was dying of lung cancer. Then in early 1956 he began to step into Fr. Timothy Zapelena's role as professor of Ecclesiology. Zapelena did not end up leaving the Gregorian immediately, and the two of them were both present during the 1955–56 school year. Sullivan began his work still using the book Zapelena had already prepared for his own Ecclesiology course. Zapelena had been teaching a two-semester course for many years, and since he was healthy enough to continue teaching for a little while longer, over the next two years, 1956–58, he and Sullivan split the course as it had been structured, with Sullivan teaching the first semester material and Zapelena teaching the second semester material. Sullivan assumed the full responsibility for the subject in 1958 and the first book derived from the course, \"De Ecclesia\", was published in 1962. This was intended to be the first part of a two-volume work on the Church, but the advent of the Second Vatican Council disrupted those plans.\n\nThe Second Vatican Council re-articulated the theology of the Church so that the subject as Sullivan had been teaching it, largely based on \"Mystici corporis\", was no longer adequate to the subject. Nor were professors any longer expected simply to publish Latin versions of their class notes as books. Sullivan had not been called to the Council as a \"peritus\", which was not surprising given that he was still quite a junior faculty member. Information as to the Council's proceedings were kept quiet until published. However, much rumor had to say. Nevertheless, Sullivan was given access to one critical Vatican II document, the draft form of \"Lumen gentium\", the \"Dogmatic Constitution on the Church\". This happened when he was asked to address the American bishops on the topic of charisms, a concept found in Saint Paul, particularly in his descriptions of the Church in the First Epistle to the Corinthians, but which had fallen out of use in Catholic theological circles. Sullivan's research on this idea, as given in his presentation, was then offered to the Council as a correction and advance upon the draft version by Sullivan's former Superior, John J. McEleney, who was now Archbishop of Kingston, Jamaica. In this way, Sullivan's theological work on charisms became part of the second paragraph of \"Lumen gentium\" 12. This theological preparation would have significant impact later in Sullivan's thought when he encountered the Catholic Charismatic Renewal.\n\nSullivan was named dean of the Faculty of Theology at the Gregorian University from 1964 to 1970, and it fell to him to revise the statutes of the university according to the norms put forward by the Congregation for Seminaries and Universities (now the Congregation for Catholic Education). While this extra work – without the assistance of a staff – was a great burden, Sullivan did restructure the faculty so that they were better able to conduct research as well as teach: for the first time having regular sabbaticals toward that end.\n\nA number of prominent Catholic ecclesiologists have worked with or studied under Sullivan. Sullivan was on the dissertation committee of Avery Cardinal Dulles. Joseph Komonchak and Richard McBrien were also his students. William Cardinal Levada, formerly the Prefect of the Congregation of the Doctrine of the Faith, received his doctorate under Sullivan in 1971.\n\nFrom 1992, Sullivan continued to teach graduate students as a professor of theology at Boston College. Only after the spring semester of 2009, when he turned 87, did Sullivan finally retire from teaching.\n\nAs an actively researching theologian, Sullivan was a participant in a number of ongoing discussions and investigations of matters in dispute in the theological world. In response to the production of Hans Küng's controversial book \"Infallible? An Inquiry\", Sullivan was provoked into thinking through a defense of the idea of the magisterium – the teaching authority in the Church – which eventually became his book \"Magisterium: Teaching Authority in the Catholic Church\", published in 1983.\n\nIn December 1995, he questioned the assertion of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith that the teaching reiterated in \"Ordinatio sacerdotalis\" regarding women's ordination had been infallibly taught. Sullivan wrote that \"The question that remains is whether it is a clearly established fact that the bishops of the Catholic Church are as convinced by those reasons [against women priests] as Pope John Paul evidently is, and that, in exercising their proper role as judges and teachers of the faith, they have been unanimous in teaching that the exclusion of women from ordination to the priesthood is a divinely revealed truth to which all Catholics are obliged to give a definitive assent of faith. Unless this is manifestly the case, I do not see how it can be certain that this doctrine is taught infallibly by the ordinary and universal magisterium.\"\n\nSullivan also engaged in a number of long-running discussions over disputed questions, which extended across several years of Sullivan's retirement. With Germain Grisez he discussed the question of the infallibility of the Catholic Church's teaching on artificial contraception; with Adrian Gariuit, O.F.M., he argued the question of \"dissent\" within the Church; with Lawrence J. Welch, he engaged in a long conversation in theological journals about consensus among theologians as a criterion by which it could be determined whether a doctrine was taught universally by the Church; and with Karl Becker, S.J., he debated the meaning of what the Second Vatican Council meant by saying that the Church of Christ \"subsisted in\" the Roman Catholic Church.\n\nIn 1994, Sullivan received the John Courtney Murray Award, the chief honor given by the Catholic Theological Society of America, for his achievements, particularly in the field of ecclesiology.\n\nOn 19 May 2012, the Jesuit School of Theology of Santa Clara University awarded Sullivan an honorary Doctor of Divinity degree, citing him for his accessible writing, his contributions to the charismatic and ecumenical movements, his steadfast defense of the Second Vatican Council, his exemplary life of scholarship and faith, and his generosity and availability to all students and inquirers.\n\n\n"}

It can also curl itself into a ball (volvation) as self-defence against predators such as the tiger. The colour of its scales varies depending on the colour of the earth in its surroundings.\nIt is an insectivore, feeding on ants and termites, digging them out of mounds and logs using its long claws, which are as long as its fore limbs. It is nocturnal and rests in deep burrows during the day.\n\nIt is not common anywhere in its range, and is threatened by hunting for its meat and for various body parts used in traditional medicine.\n\nThe Indian pangolin is a solitary, shy, slow-moving, nocturnal mammal. It is about long from head to tail, the tail usually being long, and weighs . Females are generally smaller than the males and have one pair of mammae. The pangolin possesses a cone-shaped head with small, dark eyes, and a long muzzle with a nose pad similar in color, or darker than, its pinkish-brown skin. It has powerful limbs, tipped with sharp, clawed digits. The pangolin has no teeth, but has strong stomach muscles to aid in digestion. The most noticeable characteristic of the pangolin is its massive, scaled armour, which covers its upper face and its whole body with the exception of the belly and the inside of the legs. These protective scales are rigid and made of keratin. It has 160–200 scales in total, about 40–46% of which are located on the tail. Scales are long, wide, and weigh . The skin and scales make up about one-fourth to one-third of the total body mass of this species.\n\nThe Indian pangolin has been recorded from various forest types, including Sri Lankan rainforest and plains to middle hill levels. The animal can be found in grasslands and secondary forests, and is well adapted to desert regions as it is believed to have a tolerance to dry areas, but prefers more barren, hilly regions. This pangolin species may also sometimes reach high elevations, and has been sighted in Sri Lanka at 1100 meters and in the Nilgiri mountains in India at 2300 meters. It prefers soft and semi-sandy soil conditions suitable for digging burrows.\n\nPangolin burrows fall into one of two categories: feeding and living burrows. Feeding burrows are smaller than living burrows (though their sizes vary depending on the abundance of prey) and are created more frequently during the spring, when there is a greater availability of prey. Living burrows are wider, deeper, and more circular, and are occupied for a longer time than feeding burrows, as they are mainly used to sleep and rest during the day. After a few months, the pangolin abandons the burrow and digs a new one close to a food source. However, it is not uncommon for the pangolin to shift back to an old burrow.\n\nUnlike its African counterpart, the Indian pangolin does not climb trees, but it does value the presence of trees, herbs, and shrubs in its habitat because it is easier to dig burrows around them. Features that promote an abundance of ants and termites (grasses, bare grounds, bases of trees, shrubs, roots, leaf litter, fallen logs and elephant feces) are often present in pangolin habitats.\n\nThe Indian pangolin is nocturnal and mostly active intermittently between 17:00 and 05:00 hr. The peak period of activity was observed between 20:00–21:00 hr in captive individuals with some one individual variation.\n\nIn Sri Lankan rainforests, it may be more arboreal, using its claws and prehensile tails as supports to readjust fore legs as they climb. It digs burrows in the ground, at depths of 1.5–6 m; these are frequently under large rocks and the entrance is often hidden with soil. When in danger, it rolls up with its tail pressed tightly against face and belly to help protect itself. Longevity of this animal in captivity can exceed 19 years.\n\nThe Indian pangolin is an almost exclusive insectivore and principally subsists on ants and termites, which it catches with a specially adapted long, sticky tongue. It is specialised to feed on ants and termites, but also forages for beetles and cockroaches. It feeds on the eggs, larvae, and adults of its prey, but eggs are the preferred choice. In the Potohar region of the Punjab province, the majority of its diet was found to consist of two types of ants, \"Camponotus confuci\" and \"Camponotus compressus\". Other matter such as plant matter, stones, sand, and clay are consumed as well and in concert with strong stomach muscles aid in breaking down the food in the stomach. The Indian pangolin is nocturnal and uses its well-developed sense of smell to locate ant nests or termite mounds and other food sources. Foraging mostly takes place on the ground but may include arboreal ants, as seen in the rainforest canopy of Sri Lanka. Pangolins tear apart and dig into mounds by using the three centre claws on their forefeet, throwing loose soil backwards with their hind feet. When feeding, the rostral part of the pangolin's tongue is quickly inserted and withdrawn to capture prey. This movement is also used for drinking. Red weaver ants (\"Oecophylla smaragdina\") with their eggs are best accepted by the Indian pangolins in captivity.\n\nFew details are known about the breeding behaviour of the Indian pangolin. During the animal's mating period, females and males may share the same burrow and show some diurnal activities. Males have testes in a fold of the skin located in their groin areas. The female's embryo develops in one of the uterine horns. The gestation period lasts 65–70 days; the placenta is diffuse and not deciduate. Usually, a single young is born, but twins have been reported in this species. The young weigh 235–400 g at birth and measure roughly 30 cm. The newborn animals have open eyes, and soft scales with protruding hairs between them. The mother pangolin carries her young on her tail. When the mother and young are disturbed, the young pangolin is held against its mother's belly and protected by the mother's tail.\n\nSuccessful reproduction by Indian pangolins has been reported from several zoos, including Calcutta Zoo, Oklahoma Zoo, and Nandankanan Zoological Park. Pangolins were found to not show any significant morphological changes during pregnancy. Births in captivity have been reported throughout the year except for May and June. At birth a baby pangolin weighed 235 g and measured 30 cm in total length, including 12.5 cm of tail. A three-day-old Indian pangolin born at Oklahoma Zoo measured 310 mm from tip to tip with a 125 mm tail.\n\nThe Indian pangolin is threatened by poaching for its meat and scales, which are used and consumed by local people, but are also increasingly traded internationally. Various parts of the pangolin are valued as sources of food and medicine. The scales are used as an aphrodisiac, or made into rings or charms. The skins are used to manufacture leather goods, including boots and shoes. The majority of hunting is carried out by nomads and trained local hunters.\nIndian pangolin body parts have been trafficked for consumption in China since at least the early 2000s.\nPangolins are the most heavily trafficked protected mammals.\n\nThe Indian pangolin is listed on CITES Appendix I since January 2017 and is protected in all range countries.\n\nWithin its range it is variously known as \"khawlyaa manjar\" (”खवल्या मांजर\" in Marathi), \"saal khapri\" (Chhattisgarhi), \"bon-rou\" (Assamese: বন-ৰৌ), పొలుశు పంది or నీల చేప (Telugu), \"eenampechi\" (\"ഈനാംപേച്ചി\" in Malayalam), \"azhungu\" or \"alangu\" ('அலங்கு' in Tamil), \"bajrakapta\" ('ବଜ୍ରକାପ୍ତା' in Odia), \"kaballewa\" (Sinhala), and \"chippu handi\" (\"ಚಿಪ್ಪು ಹಂದಿ\" in Kannada).\n"}

{"id": "2042350", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2042350", "title": "California State Route 41", "text": "California State Route 41\n\nState Route 41 (SR 41) is a state highway in the U.S. state of California, running from the Cabrillo Highway (SR 1) in Morro Bay on the Central Coast to SR 140 in Yosemite National Park, via Fresno and the San Joaquin Valley. It has been constructed as an expressway from near SR 198 in Lemoore north to the south part of Fresno, where the Yosemite Freeway begins, passing along the east side of downtown and extending north into Madera County.\n\nThe majority of Route 41 runs as either two-lane rural highway or four-lane divided highway. The southern end of the highway intersects SR 1 in Morro Bay. Between Morro Bay and Fresno, the highway intersects U.S. Route 101 in Atascadero, proceeds through the Coast Range and intersects SR 46. Actor James Dean died in an accident in 1955 at the intersection of SR 46 in Cholame. Currently, there is a memorial located there. The interchange is now called the James Dean Memorial Junction. Between SR 46 and SR 33, SR 41 briefly travels through Kern County without any intersections in its entirety. After entering Kings County, it reaches SR 33. SR 41 then intersects Interstate 5 south of Kettleman City. A large hazardous waste and municipal solid waste disposal facility operated by Waste Management, Inc. is located 5.6 km (3.5 mi) SSW of Kettleman City on the west side of the highway. Just before reaching the intersection at SR 198 outside of the city of Lemoore, SR 41 becomes a four-lane divided highway until just southeast of Riverdale, where SR 41 reverts to one lane in each direction. The El Adobe de los Robles Rancho built by pioneer Daniel Rhoads can be found north of Lemoore.\n\nSoutheast of Caruthers, SR 41 becomes a four-lane divided highway and eventually a freeway approaching the Fresno city limits. The route intersects SR 99 near Jensen Avenue. Complete access is not available between SR 41/SR 99. For example, there is no direct connector between the southbound SR 41 and northbound SR 99; drivers wanting to make this transition must exit at the SR 41/SR 180 interchange, head west on SR 180, and then transition onto SR 99 at the interchange between those two freeways. Likewise, there is no direct connector between the northbound SR 41 and the southbound SR 99. Drivers must exit at Jensen Avenue, head east on Jensen until its junction with SR 99 a half-mile east of SR 41, and then make the southbound transition onto SR 99.\n\nSR 41 continues north into downtown Fresno, then intersects SR 180 at a section of the latter route that links SR 41 to both SR 99 to the west, and to SR 168 to the east. North of Fresno, the route crosses the San Joaquin River, and enters Madera County near Children's Hospital of Central California before reverting to a two-lane highway. further north, Route 41 intersects with SR 145, before entering California's Sierra-Nevada mountain range. Route 41 continues through the towns of Coarsegold and Oakhurst, where it intersects with SR 49. Route 41 ends in Yosemite National Park to the north.\nTunnel View is a viewpoint located just outside the east end of the Wawona Tunnel in Yosemite National Park. It is located about 1.5 miles (2.4 km) from the Yosemite Valley. This is the first view that most people have of Yosemite Valley. There is an END-41 sign just south of the southern entrance to Yosemite National Park. The state routes within the park are not signed (with the exception of SR 120). Tunnel View is along Route 41's alignment, although state maintenance of the route ends at the south entrance of the park.\n\nExcept between US 101 in Atascadero and SR 46 near Shandon, SR 41 is part of the California Freeway and Expressway System, and north of SR 46 is part of the National Highway System, a network of highways that are considered essential to the country's economy, defense, and mobility by the Federal Highway Administration. Three segmentsfrom SR 1 to US 101, SR 46 to SR 33, and SR 49 at Oakhurst to Yosemite (the Wawona Road)are eligible for inclusion in the State Scenic Highway System, but SR 41 is not officially designated as a scenic highway by the California Department of Transportation. SR 41 is known as the E.G. Lewis Highway from SR 1 to US 101 in San Luis Obispo County, the Dwight David Eisenhower Memorial Freeway from Ventura Avenue in Fresno to Herndon Avenue in Fresno, the Donald DeMers Highway from Jensen Avenue in Fresno to Elkhorn Avenue, the Yosemite Freeway from Elkhorn Avenue to the Fresno-Madera County line, the Southern Yosemite Highway from the Fresno-Madera County line to Yosemite National Park, and the Wawona Road from Fresno to Yosemite National Park.\n\nIn 1930, the counties of Fresno, Kings, Kern, and San Luis Obispo considered organizing a joint highway district to construct a shortcut connecting Fresno with the Pacific Ocean at Morro Bay. This highway would pass through Kettleman City on its way to the Cholame Lateral (Legislative Route 33) near Cholame or Shandon, and then continue to Morro Bay, where a new harbor was being developed. The entire length from Fresno to Morro Bay, as well as the Wawona Road to Yosemite, was added to the state highway system in 1933 as Route 125, and subsequently improved by the state. In 1934, the state sign route system was established, and Sign Route 41 was designated along Route 125 from Yosemite south and southwest to Cholame and then west through Paso Robles to Cambria via Legislative Route 33. The part of Route 125 southwest of Cholame instead became part of the new U.S. Route 466.\n\nBy the 1950s, the short piece of US 466 (Route 125) between Creston and Atascadero had not yet been paved, and so US 466 was moved to the longer but better road via Paso Robles, replacing SR 41 to Paso Robles and overlapping US 101 to Atascadero. As SR 41 had not been signed over the unpaved road west of Paso Robles, it was truncated to Cholame. US 466 was eliminated in the 1964 renumbering, becoming SR 46 east from Paso Robles. However, instead of going south and west to Morro Bay, SR 46 continued west to Cambria, and the road via Creston and Atascadero to Morro Bay (which had since been paved) became part of SR 41.\n\nIn the 1980s, the urban stretch of 41 running through Fresno was upgraded to freeway standards, intersecting SR 99 to the south. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, the freeway portion was extended several miles beyond Fresno in both directions.\n\nAlso in the late 1990s and early 2000s in Atascadero, the old SR 41 alignment used to cut through downtown by going north on El Camino Real and turning right onto West Mall. Then it continued past the Atascadero Colony Building and crossed the 1921 Atascadero Creek Bridge before turning left onto Capistrano Avenue. It then went under a low clearance railroad crossing and a dangerous narrow bridge crossing the Salinas River before rejoining its existing alignment. Then Caltrans built a bypass of this dangerous route with a long wider bridge crossing the railroad, Sycamore Drive, and the river before joining the original 1950s SR 41. SR 41 is now currently signed on this bypass. Since then, the old bridge was demolished but the railroad undercrossing still remains. There's an old sign on Capistrano Avenue that still marks it as \"Hwy 41\" and signs on El Camino Real that mark West Mall with covered up \"41\" shields.\n\nThe Kings County Association of Governments has plans to improve the state highways within the county. Developers are interested in building distribution warehouses in Kings County because of its strategic location midway between the Los Angeles and San Francisco Bay areas, but they are currently turned off by the lack of freeway access. For SR 41, the plan is to upgrade it so the highway is a continuous freeway from I-5 north to Fresno County. However, Kings County voters have shown little interest in passing any transportation taxes to fund these projects.\n\n"}
{"id": "2042367", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2042367", "title": "Always Greener", "text": "Always Greener\n\nAlways Greener was an Australian television drama/comedy series that aired on the Seven Network which followed the fortunes of two families, one from the city and the other from the country, when they decide to switch homes and start a new direction in life for themselves. It ran from 2001 until 2003, when it was cancelled after declining ratings and concerns over the cost of production.\n\nThe name of the show stems from the phrase \"The grass is always greener on the other side\". Promotion of the show's premiere episode used the Travis song \"Side\", which features the phrase as part of the chorus. The show was broadcast overseas in New Zealand on TV ONE. In 2006 reruns started airing on TV2. The series has since been released on DVD.\n\nThe Southern Star Group owns the rights to distribute \"Always Greener\" internationally.\n\nThe series mainly revolved around the members of two families, the Taylors, who live in suburban Sydney, and the Todd family who live on a farm just outside the rural New South Wales town of Inverness. Each faced with problems of their own, John Taylor pays his sister Sandra Todd a Christmas visit to her farm. Joking that they should consider switching houses for a change in their life, the move becomes a reality when John discovers that his daughter Marissa is on drugs and Sandra can't pay the bills. \"Always Greener\" was noted for both dealing with serious issues as well as putting an often humorous touch to episodes. Fantasy sequences (such as a song and dance number when John mulls over having a vasectomy) were common and often added to the charm of the series.\n\n\n\n\nClayton Watson won the Australian Film Institute's award for \"Best Actor in a Supporting or Guest Role in a Television Drama\" for his work on \"Always Greener\" in 2002. The show was also nominated for an International Emmy Award in 2002 and \"Always Greener\" and its cast have been nominated for several Logies during its run.\n\nLogie Awards\n\n\nASSG Australian Screen Sound Awards\n\n\nAPRA-AGSC Screen Music Awards\n\n\nAustralian Film Institute Television Awards\n\n\nInternational Emmy Awards\n\n\nAustralian Writers' Guild Awards\n\n\nOn 6 July 2003, Seven's Director of Programming and Production, Tim Worner announced the renewal of \"Always Greener\" saying: \"Always Greener is an important program for Seven. We see it as a key franchise for us, a program we believe will continue to build in its third season.\" Then in September, the decision was reversed. News was broken to cast and crew as the first script meetings for the new series were already being held.\n\nRumours were that the cancellation was due to falling ratings. The show began with over 2 million viewers in 2001, but ratings never recovered from the disastrous decision to début the second season in the low rating Easter period of 2002 - Against stronger competition in both '60 Minutes' and 'Big Brother'. In 2002 the show moved from Sunday to Monday and then back to Sunday by 2003. \"Always Greener\" was rating around 1.0 million when cancelled. However, Seven cited \"cost management\" as the reason for dropping the series.\n\nAt the time, Worner was reported as saying that the decision was purely based on cost, because the 22 episodes were to cost $10 million, and he said that was far too much.\n\nIn late 2005 Seven aired reruns of the show in the early morning 9.30am timeslot and again in Seven's popular reruns timeslot at 12.00pm. Presently it airs sporadically on Universal Channel.\n\nThe first season of \"Always Greener\" have been released on DVD in Region 4 (Australia) format. The DVDs are distributed by Madman Entertainment under the label of VIA Vision Entertainment. A photo gallery is included in Season 1 (Vol. 2) and Season 1 (Complete).\n\n"}

{"id": "2042384", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2042384", "title": "Bengal monitor", "text": "Bengal monitor\n\nThe Bengal monitor (\"Varanus bengalensis\") or common Indian monitor, is a monitor lizard found widely distributed over the Indian Subcontinent, as well as parts of Southeast Asia and West Asia. This large lizard is mainly terrestrial, and its length can range from about 61 to 175 cm from the tip of the snout to the end of the tail. Young monitors may be more arboreal, but adults mainly hunt on the ground, preying mainly on arthropods, but also taking small terrestrial vertebrates, ground birds, eggs and fish. Although large monitors have few predators apart from humans who hunt them for meat, younger individuals are hunted by many predators.\n\nThe Bengal monitor can reach 175 cm with a snout-to-vent length (SVL) of 75 cm and a tail of 100 cm. Males are generally larger than females. Heavy individuals may weigh nearly 7.2 kg. The populations of monitors in India and Sri Lanka differ in the scalation from those of Myanmar; these were once considered subspecies of the Bengal monitor, but now considered two species within the \"V. bengalensis\" species complex. What was once the nominate subspecies, \"V. bengalensis\", is found west of Myanmar, while \"V. nebulosus\" is found to the east. \"V. nebulosus\" can be differentiated by the presence of a series of enlarged scales in the supraocular region. The number of ventral scales varies, decreasing from 108 in the west to 75 in the east (Java).\n\nYoung monitor lizards are more colourful than adults. Young have a series of dark crossbars on the neck, throat and back. The belly is white, banded with dark crossbars and are spotted with grey or yellow (particularly in the eastern part of the range). On the dorsal surface of young monitors, there are a series of yellow spots with dark transverse bars connecting them. As they mature, the ground colour becomes light brown or grey, and dark spots give them a speckled appearance. Hatchlings of \"V. nebulosus\" by comparison tend to have a series of backward-pointing, V-shaped bands on their necks.\n\nBengal monitors have external nostril openings (nares) that is slit-like and oriented near horizontal, and positions between the eye and the tip of the snout. The nares can be closed at will, especially to keep away debris or water. The scales of the skin are rougher in patches and on the sides, they have minute pits, especially well distributed in males. These scales with micropores have glandular structures in the underlying dermal tissue and produce a secretion which may be a pheromone-like substance. Like other varanids, Bengal monitors have a forked tongue that is protruded in the manner of snakes. The function is mainly sensory, and is not very involved in the transport of food down the throat. Bengal monitors have fat deposits in the tail and body that serve them in conditions when prey are not easily available.\n\nThe lungs have spongy tissue unlike the sacs of other saurians. This allows for greater rates of gas exchange and allows a faster metabolic rate and higher activity levels. Like all varanids, they have subpleurodont teeth, meaning the teeth are fused to the inside of the jaw bones. The teeth are placed one behind another, and there are replacement teeth behind and between each functional tooth (polyphyodont). The maxillary and dentary teeth are laterally compressed, sometimes with a slightly serrate cutting edge, while the premaxillary teeth are conical. There are 78 premaxillary teeth, 10 maxillary and 13 dentary teeth. Replacement teeth move forward and about four replacements happens each year for a tooth. Their mandibular glands produce secretions at the base of the teeth, and although some varanids have been shown to have a venom, no toxicity has been reported in the Bengal monitor.\n\nThe species ranges from Iran to Java, among the most widely distributed of varanid lizards as they are eurytopic and adaptable to a range of habitats. It is found in river valleys in eastern Iran, Afghanistan, India, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Burma. The closely related species \"Varanus nebulosus\", the clouded monitor, occurs in southern Burma, Vietnam, Cambodia, Thailand, Malaysia, Sumatra, Java and the Sunda Islands. They have not been confirmed on Sumatra, and have been found to be absent from the Andaman Islands.\n\nThe species is distributed mainly in the lower elevations, and is found both in dry semiarid desert habitats to moist forest. They are often found in agricultural areas, and are mainly found below 1500m altitude.\n\nBengal monitors are usually solitary and usually found on the ground, although the young are often seen on trees. \"V. nebulosus\" has a greater propensity for tree climbing. The two sympatric species Bengal and yellow monitor partially separated their habitat as Bengal monitor prefers forest over agricultural areas. Bengal monitors shelter in burrows they dig or crevices in rocks and buildings, whilst clouded monitors prefer tree hollows. Both races will make use of abandoned termite mounds. Bengal monitors, like other varanids, show true sleep at night and are diurnal, becoming active around 6 AM and bask in the morning sun. During winter, in the colder parts of their distribution range, they may take shelter and go through a period of reduced metabolic activity. They are not territorial, and may change their range seasonally in response to food availability.\n\nThey are usually shy and avoid humans. They have keen eyesight and can detect human movement nearly 250 m away. When caught, a few individuals may bite, but rarely do so.\n\nAlthough they are found on agricultural land, they prefer forests with large trees. Generally, high ground cover with large trees are favorable areas.Captives have been known to live for nearly 22 years. Predators of adults include pythons, mammalian predators and birds. A number of ectoparasites and endoparasites are recorded.\n\nFemales may be able to retain sperm, and females held in confinement have been able to lay fertile eggs. Some species of monitor lizards such as \"Varanus niloticus\" have additionally demonstrated to be capable of parthenogenesis. The main breeding season is June to September, but males begin to show combat behaviour by April. Females dig a nest hole in level ground or a vertical bank and lay the eggs inside, filling it up and using their snouts to compact the soil. The females often dig false nests nearby and shovel soil around the area. They sometimes make use of a termite mound to nest. A single clutch of about 20 eggs are laid. The eggs hatch in 168 to nearly as long as 254 days. About 40-80% of the eggs may hatch.\nThey are capable of rapid movement on the ground. Small individuals may climb trees to escape, but larger ones prefer to escape on the ground. They can climb well. On the ground, they sometimes stand on the hind legs to get a better view or when males fight other males. They can also swim well and can stay submerged for at least 17 minutes. They can use both trees and bushes for shelter.\n\nBengal monitors tend to remain active the whole day. Large adults may ascend vertical tree trunks, where they sometimes stalk and capture roosting bats. The species is a generalist, and feeds on a varied diet of invertebrates and vertebrates. Invertebrate prey mostly consists of beetles and their larvae followed by orthopterans, but also maggots, caterpillars, centipedes, scorpions, crabs, crayfish, snails, termites, ants, and earwigs. Larger individuals in addition to invertebrates also eat a large amount of vertebrate prey, including toads and frogs and their eggs, fish, lizards, snakes, rats, squirrels, hares, musk shrews, and birds. Hares and rodents such as Indian bandicoot rats are often caught by digging them out of their nests. Diet may differ based on season and locality, for example, they often forage for fish and aquatic insects in streams during the summer, and individuals in Andhra Pradesh eat mostly frogs and toads. Bengal monitors will also scavenge carrion, and sometimes congregate when feeding on large carcasses such as that of deer. In areas where livestock are common, they often seek out dung to forage for beetles and other insects.\n\nThe lizard is known as \"bis-cobra\" in western India, \"Goyra\" in Rajasthan, \"guishaap\" or \"goshaap\" in West Bengal and Bangladesh, \"goh\" in Punjab and Bihar, as \"ghorpad\" in Maharashtra and as \"Thalagoya\" in Sri Lanka. Folk mythology across the region includes the idea that these lizards, though actually harmless, are venomous, and in Rajasthan, the locals believe that the lizards become venomous only during the rainy season. Monitor lizards are hunted, and their body fat, extracted by boiling, is used in a wide range of folk remedies.\n\nIn Sri Lanka, the water monitor (Kabaragoya) is considered venomous and dangerous when confronted, while the Bengal monitor (Thalagoya) is considered harmless and rather defenseless. Land monitor meat is considered edible (especially by indigenous Veddah and Rodiya people) while water monitor meat is not. Killing a land monitor is usually considered a cowardly act, and is frequently referred to folklore along with other harmless reptiles such as rat snakes (Garandiya).\n\nA clan in Maharashtra called \"Ghorpade\" claims that the name is derived from a legendary founder Maratha Koli leader Tanaji Malusare who climbed a fort using a monitor lizard and a rope. Folk traditions have various stories of monitor lizards being used by soldiers to climb walls of forts.\n\nThe Bengal monitor's belly skin has traditionally been used in making the drum head for the \"kanjira\" (known as \"Dimadi\" in Maharashtra), a South Indian percussion instrument.\n\nWhile it is assessed LC (Least Concern) by the IUCN 2009, the assessment currently requires updating. The Bengal monitor is listed as Appendix I of CITES and Schedule I of the 1972 Wildlife Protection Act. The wild population is decreasing as it is hunted for both consumption and medicinal purposes. As it is adaptable to a range of habitats, the threat of habitat degradation is relatively less prominent and is superseded by the threat of agricultural pollution, as pesticides reduce the availability of prey. In Iran, it is also sometimes killed due to being seen as a dangerous threat. \n\n\n"}

As a Neoplatonist, his influence on Islamic philosophy is primarily in the area of ethics. He was the author of the first major Islamic work on philosophical ethics entitled the \"Refinement of Character\" ( \"Tahdhīb\" \"al\"-\"Akhlāq\"), focusing on practical ethics, conduct, and refinement of character. He separated personal ethics from the public realm, and contrasted the liberating nature of reason with the deception and temptation of nature. Miskawayh was a prominent figure in the intellectual and cultural life of his time.\n\nMiskawayh was born in Rey, then under Ziyarid control. Miskawayh may have been a Zoroastrian convert to Islam, but it seems more likely that it was one of his ancestors who converted. During his early career, he spent his life in Baghdad, where he served as the secretary of Muhallabi, the vizier of the Buyid emir Mu'izz al-Dawla. He was fluent enough in Middle Persian to have translated some pre-Islamic texts in that language into Arabic. After a long service to the Buyids of Iraq, Miskawayh moved to the court of Rukn al-Dawla, where he spent seven years working there with the Buyid vizier Abu 'l-Fadl ibn al-'Amid. In 966, a group of \"ghazi\" marched towards the Library of Rey but Miskawayh managed to save it. After the death of Abu'l-Fadl ibn al-'Amid in 970, Miskawayh continued to serve the latter's son, Abu'l-Fath, and in 975 along with him left for Baghdad.\n\nHe later worked as a secretary and librarian for a sequence of viziers, including 'Adud al-Dawla. Some contemporary sources associated him with the Brethren of Purity, claiming that some of his writings were used in the compilation of the \"Encyclopedia of the Brethren of Purity\".\nMiskawayh died in 1030 at Isfahan, then under Kakuyid control.\n\n\n\n"}

It was a light machine gun used by the Poles in World War II.\n\nAfter Poland regained its independence in 1918, the Polish Army was equipped with all sorts of machine guns inherited from the armed forces of the partitioners, along with equipment from the French and British armies that equipped the Polish Blue Army during the Great War. The large variety of light machine guns used, as well as the fact that each of them used a different calibre, made troop training and logistics a difficult task.\n\nAfter the Polish-Bolshevik War, in 1923 a competition was opened for a new, standard light machine gun for the Polish army that was to replace all previously used types of LMG. The competition ended without a winner and the following year the Polish Ministry of War purchased 12 specimens of the M1918 Browning Automatic Rifle, Lewis gun (\"Lewis wz. 1923\") and Hotchkiss M1909 Benét–Mercié each. Testing proved the superiority of the American construction, and during the 1925 competition a Belgian FN-made Browning was chosen. Although extensive tests were continued, the Polish army ordered a series of Belgian-made BAR machine guns, modified to better suit the Polish needs. The modifications included changing the round from .30-06 Springfield to standard Polish 7.92×57mm Mauser), the construction of a bipod and mounting and the iron sights (peephole changed to v-notch type). The barrel was lengthened for greater accuracy and a pistol grip was added for easier aiming. Apart from the 10,000 pieces ordered from Fabrique Nationale, Poland also bought a licence to construct the weapon at home. The first wz.28 LMGs were officially commissioned in 1927 and were officially named \"7,92 mm rkm Browning wz. 1928\", which is a Polish designation for \"7.92 mm hand-held machine gun of Browning mark 1928\".\nDue to serious flaws in license documentation purchased from Belgium, production in Poland was not started until 1930. Until 1939 approximately 14,000 pieces were built. Additional modifications were introduced during the production run. Among them was replacement of the iron sights with a smaller version and reshaping the butt to a \"fish tail\" shape. There were also extensive works on spare, replaceable barrels for the weapon, which however were never completed due to the outbreak of World War II.\n\nDuring the German-Soviet Invasion of Poland of 1939, the \"rkm wz. 1928\" was the standard LMG used by almost all Polish infantry and cavalry units. The German armed forces captured a number of Polish-made Browning guns and used them until the end of World War II under the designation of \"lMG 28 (p)\". A number were also seized by the Red Army and used during the war.\n\nThe RKM wz.28 was a basis for development of an aerial, flexible machine gun, designated karabin maszynowy obserwatora wz.37, used mainly by the Polish PZL.37 Łoś bombers.\n\n\n"}

Qumri is theorized to be Avicenna’s teacher.\n\nLittle is known about al-Qumri’s life, however the thirteenth century biographer Ibn Abi Usaibia writes in \"History of the Physicians\"Abū Mansūr al-Hasan ibn Nūh al-Qamarī was the leading personage of his generation, celebrated as a fine physician who had praiseworthy methods and a thorough and wide knowledge of medical theory. He had, may God bless him, a good hand in treatment and was held in great esteem by the kings of his times. The Shaikh and Imam Shams al-Dīn `Abd al-Hamīd ibn `Isā from Khusroshah told me that the Grand Master Ibn Sīna had met this physician when he was very old. He used to attend his council and lessons and benefited from his medical knowledge. Abū Mansūr al-Hasan ibn Nūh al-Qamarī wrote the following books: 1) \"Wealth and Fate\", a fine compendium in which he summarized all the maladies and their treatments in the most perfect and concise way. 2) A collection of citations from the works of those who practiced medicine, especially al-Rāzī. 3) \"The Causes of Maladies\".Usaibia’s brief biography suggests that Avicenna would have directly attended lectures from al-Qumri, but upon comparing birth and death dates of the two, it seems that Avicenna may have heavily consulted his works in Bukhara.\n\nThere are currently three known works attributed to Qumri, and one is presumed to be missing. It is theorized that he may have written more, but if he did these works are lost.\n\nThe \"Ghina Wa Muna\", loosely translated as the “Book of Wealth and Wishes” is mentioned in Usaibia's biography. This work has approximately 220 folios and is divided in to three parts; “diseases from head to toe”, “external medicine”, and fevers/pharmacological recipes”. \"Ghina Was Muna\" is arranged in a formulaic manner suggesting that this manual would be used as a reference tool while working in the field rather than a theoretical work. Approximately 44 extant copies survive many of them are well preserved suggesting that many of them were library copies, with any working copies too far degraded to survive.\n\nMany of the \"Ghina Wa Muna\" manuscripts are either not digitized or accessible in online catalogue entries. The chart below is a selection of digitized or accessible manuscripts:\n\nThe \"al-Tanwir fi al-Istiliahat al-Tibbiyya\" (or \"al-\"Tanwir is translated as “Book of Illumination Regarding Medical Technical Terminology”) is a short book on medical terms and tools. This book is presumably designed to be a working reference book and is much shorter than the \"Ghina Wa Muna\". There are approximately 14 extant manuscripts, and at least one critical edition. Like the \"Ghina Wa Muna,\" the \"al-Tanwir’s\" manuscripts are difficult to access online, and unfortunately a similar chart could not be made.\n\n\"The Causes of Maladies\" is presumed missing.\n\n\n"}

St. Thomas of Canterbury received his religious profession on 16 February 1163, and perhaps then ordained him. He was certainly one of the monks who buried the saint after his martyrdom, on 29 December 1170.\n\nHistorical records show that Gervase took a prominent part in the disputes between the monks and Archbishop Baldwin (1185-1191) and was one of the monks sent to announce to the archbishop an appeal to the pope. In 1189 he was again one of a deputation sent to lay the matter before King Richard I. As yet, Gervase, though one of the senior monks, had held no prominent office, but about this time he was made sacristan, for in 1193 he attended the new archbishop, Hubert Walter, in that capacity. He probably ceased to hold this office in 1197 when he speaks of one \"Felix\", as sacristan.\n\nThe rest of Gervase's life is obscure. He was still writing in 1199 and there are slight indications in another chronicle, the \"Gesta Regum\", that he continued to write till 1210, when a sudden change in style and arrangement point to a new chronicler. His death may therefore be assumed in or soon after that year. Gervase has occasionally been confused with others of the same name, notably with Gervase of S. Ceneri, and thus he is described as prior of Dover by Dom Brial, which is impossible on chronological grounds. Thomas Duffus Hardy identified him with Gervase of Chichester, but William Stubbs argued against this theory, as also against confusing him with Gervase of Melkley.\n\nFive monks from Canterbury reported to the abbey's chronicler, Gervase, that shortly after sunset on 18 June 1178, (25 June on the proleptic Gregorian calendar) they saw \"\"the upper horn [of the moon] split in two.\"\" Furthermore, Gervase writes, \"\"From the midpoint of the division a flaming torch sprang up, spewing out, over a considerable distance, fire, hot coals and sparks. Meanwhile the body of the Moon which was below writhed, as it were in anxiety, and to put it in the words of those who reported it to me and saw it with their own eyes, the Moon throbbed like a wounded snake. Afterwards it resumed its proper state. This phenomenon was repeated a dozen times or more, the flame assuming various twisting shapes at random and then returning to normal. Then, after these transformations, the Moon from horn to horn, that is along its whole length, took on a blackish appearance\"\". In 1976 the geologist Jack B. Hartung proposed that this described the formation of the crater Giordano Bruno.\n\nModern theories predict that a (conjectural) asteroid or comet impact on the Moon would cause a plume of molten matter rising up from the surface, which is consistent with the monks' description. In addition, the location recorded fits in well with the crater's location. Additional evidence of Giordano Bruno's youth is its spectacular ray system: because micrometeorites constantly rain down, they kick up enough dust to quickly (in geological terms) erode a ray system. So it can be reasonably hypothesized that Giordano Bruno was formed during the span of human history, perhaps in June 1178.\n\nHowever, the question of the crater's age is not that simple. The impact creating the 22-km-wide crater would have kicked up enough debris to trigger a week-long, blizzard-like meteor storm on Earth – yet no accounts of such a noteworthy storm of unprecedented intensity are found in any known historical records, including the European, Chinese, Arabic, Japanese and Korean astronomical archives. This discrepancy is a major objection to the theory that Giordano Bruno was formed at that time.\n\nAll this raises the question of what the monks saw. An alternative theory holds that the monks just happened to be in the right place at the right time to see an exploding meteor coming at them and aligned with the Moon. Because meteors appear about 45 to 75 miles up in the atmosphere, the laws of geometric perspective dictate that only a relatively small area in Britain would have the perfect geometry to make it look like it was on the Moon.\n\nThe works of Gervase consist of: (1) \"The Chronicle\", covering the period from 1100 to 1199. It was first printed by Twysden in \"Historiae Anglicanae Scriptores Decem\" (London, 1652). (2) The \"Gesta Regum\", which is in part an abridgment of the earlier chronicle, and from the year 1199 an independent source of great value for the early years of John's reign. (3) \"Actus Pontificum Cantuariensis Ecclesia\", a history of the archbishops of Canterbury to the death of Hubert Walter in 1205, also printed by Twysden with the chronicle. (4) \"Mappa Mundi\", a topographical work with lists of bishoprics and ecclesiastical foundations in the various counties of England, Wales, and part of Scotland. The works of Gervase were published in the Rolls Series in 1879–1880 under the editorship of Dr. Stubbs, whose introduction has been the groundwork of all subsequent accounts of Gervase.\n\nA play by Dorothy L. Sayers, \"The Zeal of Thy House\" is based on Gervase's account of the injury and resignation of William of Sens.\n\n"}

It was enforced by several laws throughout Imperial China, but its cultural and possibly religious origins predate the Qin dynasty. Not respecting the appropriate naming taboos was considered a sign of lacking education and respect, and brought shame both to the offender and the offended person.\n\n\nThere were three ways to avoid using a taboo character:\n\nThroughout Chinese history, there were emperors whose names contained common characters who would try to alleviate the burden of the populace in practicing name avoidance. For example, Emperor Xuan of Han, whose given name Bingyi (病已) contained two very common characters, changed his name to Xun (詢), a far less common character, with the stated purpose of making it easier for his people to avoid using his name. Similarly, Emperor Taizong of Tang, whose given name Shimin (世民) also contained two very common characters, ordered that name avoidance only required the avoidance of the characters \"Shi\" and \"Min\" in direct succession and that it did not require the avoidance of those characters in isolation.\n\nHowever, Emperor Taizong's son Emperor Gaozong of Tang effectively made this edict ineffective after his death, by requiring the complete avoidance of the characters \"Shi\" and \"Min\", necessitating the chancellor Li Shiji to change his name to Li Ji. In later dynasties, princes were frequently given names that contained uncommon characters to make it easier for the public to avoid them, should they become emperor later in life.\n\nDuring the rule of the Han Ming Emperor, whose personal name was Zhuang, most people with surname Zhuang (庄) were ordered to change their names to Yan (). \n\nThe custom of naming taboo had a built-in contradiction: without knowing what the emperors' names were one could hardly be expected to avoid them, so somehow the emperors' names had to be informally transmitted to the populace to allow them to learn them in order to avoid them. In one famous incident in 435, during the Northern Wei Dynasty, Goguryeo ambassadors made a formal request that the imperial government issue them a document containing the emperors' names so that they could avoid offending the emperor while submitting their king's petition. Emperor Taiwu of Northern Wei agreed and issued them such a document. However, the mechanism of how the regular populace would be able to learn the emperors' names remained generally unclear throughout Chinese history.\n\nThis taboo is important to keep in mind when studying ancient historical texts from the cultural sphere, as historical characters and/or locations may be renamed if they happen to share a name with the emperor in power (or previous emperors of the same dynasty) when the text was written. Thus, the study of naming taboos can also help date an ancient text.\n\nJapan was heavily influenced by the naming taboo. In modern Japan, it concerns only the Emperor of Japan, whom people only refer as Tennō Heika (天皇陛下, his Majesty the Emperor) or Kinjō Heika (今上陛下, his current Majesty). Ancient Japanese people had so much respect for this custom that historians forgot the actual names of many historical figures or even sometimes the correct pronunciation, as many Han characters have multiple pronunciations. For example, the son of Oda Nobunaga, Oda Nobukatsu, is often called Oda Nobuo; but it mainly concerns more ancient historical figures like Murasaki Shikibu, whose actual name may forever remain a mystery.\n\nIn Vietnam, the family name Hoàng (黄) was changed to Huỳnh in the South due to the naming taboo of Lord Nguyễn Hoàng's name. Similarly, the family name \"Vũ\" (武) is known as \"Võ\" in the South.\n\n\n"}

It carried train Nos. 3 & 4 and ran between Chicago, Illinois and Los Angeles, California.\n\nThe line was conceived by company president Allen Manvel as a means to \"signify completion of the basic Santa Fe system.\" Manvel felt he could attract business and enhance the prestige of the railroad with daily first-class service from Chicago to the West Coast. The \"California Limited\", billed as the \"Finest Train West of Chicago,\" made its first run on November 27, 1892. \n\nThe \"California Limited\" was the first Santa Fe train with Fred Harvey Company meal service. The later trains also offered air conditioning, a barber, beautician, steam-operated clothing press, even a shower-bath. The \"Limited\" was the first Santa Fe train with illuminated drumhead on its observation cars, with the train's name over the company logo.\n\nThe \"California Limited\" was withdrawn on June 15, 1954, giving it the longest tenure of any train on the Chicago-Los Angeles run of the Santa Fe.\n\nThe Santa Fe introduced the \"California Limited\" on November 27, 1892. The journey took 83 hours and 50 minutes and required fifteen locomotive changes. During the summer, multiple sections were necessary to accommodate demand; reportedly 23 sections once operated from Chicago on one day. The train carried just Pullman sleeping cars (no coaches) until 1938.\n\nThe Santa Fe re-equipped the \"California Limited\" in 1910 with a club-lounge, a twin-unit dining car, and new 7-2 (7 compartments, 2 drawing rooms) sleeping cars from Pullman.

A breakfast stop was scheduled at Seligman, a lunch stop at Winslow, and a dinner stop at Albuquerque.

It was produced by Ginger Productions, written by Danny Baker and hosted by Chris Evans, for the first five series. The sixth series was hosted by a number of guest presenters. The show was broadcast on Fridays at 6pm from 9 February 1996 to 22 December 2000, with a repeat later that night. Its theme tune was Ron Grainer's theme from \"Man in a Suitcase\", in keeping with Evans' frequent use of 1960s television themes in his work.\n\nA one-off revival episode of the show was broadcast on Channel 4 on 12 June 2015. The episode was well received; on 23 June 2015, Channel 4 announced that it had commissioned a full revived series, which began airing on 16 October 2015.\n\nIn 2016, Channel 4 announced that there were no plans for any further series.\n\nThe show regularly featured live music, mostly of the then-popular Britpop school. A snippet of \"The Riverboat Song\" by Ocean Colour Scene, a band particularly championed by Evans (and the very first band to play on the show, with the same song), was used as an introduction to guests, as they walked the length of a walkway up into the \"bar\" to be interviewed by the host.\n\nViewers repeatedly asked if they could have the \"TFI Friday\" mug (or one like it) that graced Evans' table every week, so the production company created a limited run of 1,000 mugs. These were offered for sale at a prohibitive price and for a limited period of time, after which, the remaining stock was destroyed live on air when a washing machine was dropped on to them from the height of the television studio.\n\nDuring November and December 1999, the show included a segment titled \"Someone's Going to Be a Millionaire!\", inspired by the ITV game show \"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?\" (which would not have its first million-pound winner until November 2000). \"TFI Friday\" paid out the promised £1 million jackpot on 24 December 1999, becoming the first British TV show to do so.\n\nIn the summer of 2000, Channel 4 announced that the sixth series of \"TFI Friday\" was to be the last. Chris Evans left the show moments after this announcement, leaving the final series to be presented by a number of guest presenters.\n\n\nThe show attracted controversy when Happy Mondays frontman Shaun Ryder said \"fuck\" several times. Following the first interview on the show in which he had used the word, he was not allowed to be interviewed live, then during a \"Stars in Their Eyes\" skit, Ryder performed (as Johnny Rotten) the Sex Pistols' \"Pretty Vacant\". The section was transmitted live, as it was not an interview. Ryder shouted \"fuck\" several times. Subsequently, Ryder has been barred from appearing live on any Channel 4 programme – he is the only person listed by name in the Channel 4 transmission guidebook. Despite this, he reappeared for the live 20th Anniversary Special in June 2015.\n\nIn 1996, Ewan McGregor also said \"fuck\" on the show, when ranting about the Conservative government of the time. In the wake of Ryder's and McGregor's antics, \"TFI Friday\" was forced to be pre-recorded. In episode 2 of the 2015 series, actor Nicholas Hoult was heard saying \"oh fuck it\" after Chris Evans asked him to play the trombone. Evans immediately apologised afterwards.\n\nThe show gained more notoriety when as part of a competition, two children were forced to go head to head in a stare-out contest to win their parents a car. After the competition was won, the boy who had lost then started to cry, which led the tabloid press to attack the show. The next edition showed the boy with the consolation prize of an assortment of toys, an apparent attempt to mitigate controversy, but which was followed by another staring contest (this time for a speedboat), again ending with the losing child crying. The ITC gave Channel 4 a formal warning following these two incidents, and the competition feature never appeared again on the programme. On the 2015 revival show, both losing children (now grown up) were invited back and given a free holiday to Barbados with their families. Chris Evans also took this opportunity to apologise for what they did to them, acknowledging that it should never have happened.\n\nIn September 2005, Evans announced that he would be returning the \"TFI Friday\" format to TV, with \"OFI Sunday\" airing on ITV. The first edition was broadcast on 20 November 2005, but was not as successful and quickly axed. On 30 July 2014, Evans announced during his BBC Radio 2 breakfast show that \"TFI Friday\" could be returning to Channel 4, after being asked to host a 20th anniversary special (despite the gap having been only been 19 years), as well as a new series, in 2015. During his radio breakfast show on 24 February 2015, Evans revealed that the show would return on Channel 4 on 12 June. It aired from the Cochrane Theatre in Holborn, \"TFI Friday\"s previous home at Riverside Studios having been demolished.\n\nOn 23 June 2015, it was confirmed that Channel 4 had commissioned a new series, which started airing on 16 October 2015, with U2 opening and closing the show. On 7 July 2016, Channel 4 confirmed it had \"no plans\" to commission more episodes of \"TFI Friday\".\n\n\nFeatures on the show included:\n\n\n"}

Robert Mercer-Tod, of the 43rd Regiment. His mother's family were Scottish landed gentry. He grew up in London, where he was privately educated, then studied at the Slade School of Fine Art between 1926 and 1929. In 1931 he joined the London Artists' Association and then, two years later, the London Group. In 1934, Coldstream joined the GPO Film Unit to make documentary films with John Grierson. During his time with the GPO, Coldstream worked alongside W. H. Auden, Benjamin Britten and Barnett Freedman but also continued to paint. In 1937, with some financial support from Kenneth Clark, Coldstream returned to painting on a full-time basis. Later that year he co-founded the Euston Road School with Graham Bell, Victor Pasmore and Claude Rogers, having previously been involved in the short-lived Objective Abstraction movement. Notable among his paintings of this period is the portrait of Inez Pearn (at that time married to Stephen Spender), which has been called ‘a masterpiece of analytical realism’ and which was said to have needed some forty sittings. Coldstream's earlier years were characterized by a dedicated engagement with socialist ideals, and by the pursuit of a non-elitist form of art. To this end, he supported the Mass Observation social survey of Britain and participated in their 1938 painting trip to Bolton.\n\nAt the start of World War Two Coldstream enlisted in the Royal Artillery before transferring to the Royal Engineers. At first he served as a gunner with a training regiment near Dover and then, from 1940 until 1943 was a camouflage officer with Camouflage Command in Farnham and later in Bristol. In 1943, the War Artists' Advisory Committee, WWAC, offered Coldstream a full-time commission which he accepted, having previously declined to work for the Committee. He was stationed in Cairo with an Indian transport unit and painted four portraits of individuals there. From Cairo he travelled to Italy, painting buildings in Capua, Rimini and Florence. Due to his slow means of working, Coldstream only produced nine pictures during his WAAC commission. He also painted Helen Darbishire in her role as principal of Somerville College, Oxford.\n\nIn November 1945, he became a visiting teacher at Camberwell School of Arts and Crafts, and later its Professor. In 1949 he returned to lead the Slade School as Principal, and Professor of Fine Art. Under his direction the Slade achieved an international reputation. In 1952 he became a CBE In the Queen's Birthday Honours 1956 Coldstream was appointed as a Knight Bachelor. Between 1958 and 1971 he was Chairman of the National Advisory Council on Art Education, which published its first report in 1960—called the \"Coldstream Report\"—outlining the requirements for a new Diploma in Art and Design (Dip.A.D.). Coldstream's proposals eventually led to more art school courses being giving degree status. Other administrative posts he held were as Vice Chairman of the Arts Council, and as a director of the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, and as a trustee of the National Gallery. He was also Chairman of the British Film Institute from 1964 to 1971. In 1978 he was awarded the Sir Misha Black award and was added to the College of Medallists.\n\nColdstream retired from the Slade School in 1975, and continued to paint until 1984, when his health was in marked decline. He died in the Royal Homeopathic Hospital in London on 18 February 1987.\n\nAs a student at the Slade in 1931, Coldstream met and married Nancy Sharp. The marriage lasted until 1939 and produced two daughters. In 1960 he married his model, Monica Hoyer, and together they would have three children, a boy and two girls. Coldstream's cousin, Nicolas Coldstream, was a leading archaeologist and academic.\n\nColdstream was committed to painting directly from life; he once remarked, \"I lose interest unless I let myself be ruled by what I see\". His type of realism had its basis in careful measurement, carried out by the following method: standing before the subject to be painted, a brush is held upright at arm's length. With one eye closed, the artist can, by sliding a thumb up or down the brush handle, take the measure of an object or interval. This finding is compared against other objects or intervals, with the brush still kept at arm's length. Informed by such measurements, the artist can paint what the eye sees without the use of conventional perspective. The surfaces of Coldstream's paintings carry many small horizontal and vertical markings, where he recorded these coordinates so that they could be verified against reality. As a result of his painstaking methods, Coldstream worked slowly, often taking scores of sittings over several months to complete a work. His subjects include still-life, landscapes (usually centered on architecture), portraits, and the female nude.\n\n\n"}

Noyes Lloyd of Bishopstone (near Shrivenham in Wiltshire) and his wife, Martha Craven. Her mother was second daughter of the Royal Governor of South Carolina, Charles Craven. She is believed to have met her future husband in Newbury, when she and her sister lived there with an aunt. Mrs Lloyd considered herself fortunate to have married \"a beneficed clergyman of respectable character and good position.\" The Lloyds settled down and had four children. Martha, the oldest daughter, was born in 1765 and her sister Mary in 1771. A few years later, a smallpox epidemic took the life of their brother and left the two older sisters scarred for life, though the youngest, Eliza, seems to have escaped relatively unharmed. When the Rev. Lloyd died in 1789, the Lloyd family lived for two or three years in the parsonage at Deane, a benefice held by Rev. George Austen. During this period, Martha Lloyd and her sister Mary became particular friends of Cassandra and Jane Austen, friendships that lasted as long as they lived.\n\nThe Lloyd family had much in common with the Austens and from an early time, visits between the two families were frequent. Though no one knows quite how they met, the Austens and Lloyds shared many mutual friends and when the Rev. Lloyd died in 1789, his widow and her two oldest, single daughters were happy to move into the unused Deane parsonage offered by Rev. Austen. Their time there, only a mile and a half from Steventon, must have been a delight for young Jane, for though she was ten years younger than the oldest Lloyd daughter, Martha, they were, as Jane's cousin Eliza de Feuillide remarked, \"very sensible and good-humored.\"\n\nAusten considered Martha to be a second sister, as her letter of 13 October 1808, written to Cassandra, shows: \"With what true sympathy our feelings are shared by Martha, you need not be told;—she is the friend & Sister under every circumstance.\"\n\nAfter three years (1792), when Jane Austen's brother, James, married and assumed the parish of Deane, it was necessary for the Lloyds to move, this time to a home in Hurstbourne, called Ibthorpe. Though only from Steventon, this separation must have seemed cruel to Jane, who had few friends nearby and no mode of transportation. It is clear from Jane Austen's correspondence that her friend Martha was privy to her great secret—her writing. An early piece of \"Juvenilia, Frederick and Elfrida\", is dedicated to her \"As a small testimony of the gratitude I feel for your late generosity to me in finishing my muslin Cloak, I beg leave to offer you this little production of your sincere Friend\" and later writings prove that she had been allowed to see the manuscripts for \"Love and Freindship\" [sic] and for \"First Impressions\", an early version of \"Pride and Prejudice\" and an honor accorded to few.\n\nIn 1805 changes abounded for the Austen and Lloyd families. Many years had now passed since James Austen's first wife had died and he had remarried again, choosing the younger Miss Mary Lloyd to be his second wife. With The Rev, George Austen's retirement and his family's to Bath in 1801, James had taken over both the Deane and Steventon, Hampshire holding and his growing family now lived in the Steventon parsonage.\n\nIt was while they were living in Bath, Somerset that Mr. Austen finally succumbed to his long illness and not too many months later that Mrs. Lloyd also died. The women, being in a delicate financial state, decided to combine housekeeping and all four (Mrs. Austen, Cassandra, Jane and Martha Lloyd) moved to Southampton to be with Jane's younger brother Frank and his wife, Mary. As an officer in the Navy, Frank was often away from home and this joining of households not only helped him look after his widowed mother, but provided constant companionship for his soon pregnant wife. It seems to have been, by all accounts, an excellent arrangement.\n\nOn 7 July 1809, Jane Austen moved to a cottage in Chawton, together with her mother, her sister Cassandra, and their friend Martha Lloyd, at the invitation of her brother Edward Austen Knight, on whose estate it lay. Their new house was a late 17th Century brick building with two sitting rooms, five bedrooms, kitchens, garrets, outbuildings, and about of grounds. It had once been an inn, and stood at the junction where the Gosport and Winchester roads met and became the main road to London.\n\nThe family remained at Chawton Cottage, even after Jane Austen's death in 1817. Martha Lloyd took on many duties as housekeeper for the family, though the work was divided among the three surviving women. Unfortunately for Frank, by now Sir Francis Austen, his happy home was broken up upon the death of his wife in 1823 after the birth of their 11th child. In 1828 he remarried, completing the family circle by wedding Martha Lloyd. At sixty-two, Martha was at last a bride, and more than that, Lady Austen.\n\nMartha Lloyd's role as Jane Austen's friend and confidante cannot be overvalued and her contribution to what we know of Austen's life is significant. We have not only letters written by Jane to Martha, but Martha's collection of recipes used at Chawton, which were later compiled into \"A Jane Austen Household Book\" by Peggy Hickman, David & Charles, Ltd. 1977, and in \"The Jane Austen Cookbook\" by Maggie Black and Deirdre Le Faye, British Museum Press, 1995 (). Martha Lloyd is also directly mentioned in Jane Austen's poem, \"Oh! Mr. Best You're Very Bad.\"\n\nA single photograph (daguerreotype) exists of Martha, capturing her in old age accompanied by her dog. It must have been taken at some point after 1839 (when the daguerreotype was invented).\n\nMartha Lloyd died in 1843.\n\n\n"}

First appearing in Italy, in the 16th century, most types of parma violets have lavender flowers of varying sizes, which have an attractive fragrance.\n\nThe origins of the parma violet are unknown, though they have been shown to be derived from two different \"Viola alba\" strains, and more closely resemble, in flower colour and odour, \"Viola odorata\". It was first imported into Naples in the latter part of the 19th century, when Filippo di Brazza took the plant to Udine. There are no records of his work, though it is widely believed that he deliberately crossbred to produce at least two varieties of parma. One of these is still available, whereas the other one is romantically believed to languish in some forgotten back garden somewhere, just waiting to be rediscovered.\n\nParma violets are widely believed to be sterile, and there is much store laid by their reproduction through cuttings. Armand Millet, a French violet grower, proved this belief to be a myth, however, and with the right conditions any sturdy violet could well produce a seed pod.\n\nThe delicate purple flowers of the parma violet plant also give their name to a delicate, violet-scented sweet Parma Violets, manufactured by Swizzels Matlow.\n"}

Later the emphasis for optical telescopes shifted more towards Roque de los Muchachos Observatory on La Palma.\n\n\n\n\nThe observatory has a visitors' centre and a residencia (hostel) for astronomers. Brian May helped construct a building there to study interplanetary dust.\n\nThe Minor Planet Center credits the discovery of several minor planets directly to the observatory.\n\nThe position where the observatory is situated has a mediterranean climate (Köppen \"Csb\"), with average temperature features reminiscent of southern England. This renders in warm summers that averages around with light frosts being possible and sometimes happening in winter. Extremes are moderated by its marine features, which combined with the altitude keeps temperatures below even during heat waves, and in spite of the altitude the marine features are strong enough to prevent severe frosts. Sunshine levels, as typical of the nearby lowland arid climates, are high throughout the year. Many alpine areas at further distance from the equator are above the tree line at this elevation, but Teide is far above even any subarctic temperatures due to its position on the 28th parallel north.\n\nThe useful observing time is given as 78% and the median FWHM seeing from DIMM measurements is given as 0.76\" and 0.70\" at two sites near the Carlos Sánchez Telescope.\n\n"}

Netcom started off in San Jose, California as a service to allow local students to access university networks off-campus. The original accounts were all dialup shell accounts on Intel 80386 Tandy PCs running Xenix, with email addresses in the format of user@netcom.com. Netcom soon served 95% of the San Francisco Bay Area. They later expanded to serve other areas and replaced the Tandy PCs with equipment from Sun Microsystems.\n\nWhen first launched, Rieger was the only system administrator for the company. Users would call him early in the morning to fix Internet access issues until he hired night staff. In 1992, the company was incorporated.\n\nAs the World Wide Web became more popular, and users were looking for an easy way to surf the Web, Netcom released a Windows 3.1 based program called NetCruiser (originally it was to be called Internet Xpress, but there were legal issues with calling it by that name, so it was changed in the latter part of development - although the email addresses were still kept user@ix.netcom.com). The NetCruiser service became very popular and made Netcom one of the leading Internet service providers by the mid-1990s. Netcom also had business T1, Frame Relay, UUCP, and dedicated dialup services.\n\nIn February 1995, Rieger turned the presidency of Netcom over to David W. Garrison, formerly of SkyTel. Under his direction, the company ventured into the business services market with web hosting and high-speed business connectivity products.\n\nOn September 30, 2000, the shell account services were discontinued.\n\nIn December 1995, Netcom Canada, a subsidiary of Netcom On-line, was launched in Toronto, Ontario, with Ron Close as its CEO. Netcom Canada boasted a Canada-wide network, and allowed U.S. Netcom customers to access their Internet accounts via their network using either NetCruiser or any PPP dialer. It was the first Internet service provider in Canada to become EBITDA positive.\n\nIn May 1996, Netcom Internet Limited, a subsidiary in the United Kingdom, was launched. In 1997, Internetcom do Brasil SA was founded as a joint project between Netcom On-line and Itanet, a Brazilian telephone company.\n\nIn 1996 the company called itself the world's largest ISP, with some 500,000 subscribers.\n\nOn October 13 of 1997, ICG Communications announced in a press release that it had \"entered into a definitive agreement and plan of merger with NETCOM On-Line Communication Services, Inc.\". In February 1999, ICG sold off the Netcom's U.S. subscribers and other assets to MindSpring for $245 million in cash and stock. MindSpring later merged with EarthLink in 2000. Netcom Canada was bought by and was eventually merged with Metronet (the first Canadian CLEC), and AT&T Canada, with the combined entity acquiring the AT&T Canada name (later, in the summer of 2003, this entity dropped the AT&T name and rebranded itself as Allstream). Meanwhile, at the time of the MindSpring acquisition, Netcom Internet Limited in the United Kingdom became GTS Netcom, and in March 2003, it became part of the Viatel Group along with another business ISP, Cybernet.\n\nOn January 12, 2004, Netcom Internet Ltd was rebranded to Viatel Internet Limited.\n\nIn February 1995, computer security researcher Tsutomu Shimomura monitored Netcom's network to track down an unknown attacker who electronically broke into his computer. While monitoring their network, he discovered the person who compromised his computer was Kevin Mitnick.\n\nNetcom became headline news when the Church of Scientology sued Netcom for copyright infringement. On February 13, 1995, armed police officers and attorneys from the Church of Scientology raided the home of Dennis Erlich, a former minister of the Church of Scientology. Erlich was charged with copyright infringement of the Scientology's Advanced Technology documents, and Netcom On-line was sued by the Church because a BBS owned by Tom Klemesrud hosted the alleged infringing material. This case became controversial among free speech advocates such as the EFF and Internet service providers since Netcom itself did not post the content nor have any involvement with it other than operating as a third-party hosting medium which did not actively monitor or censor their users' content. Netcom and Klemesrud eventually settled out of court.\n\n"}

It can also be found in other regions of southern Africa, such as Botswana, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Lesotho, Namibia, Swaziland, and had plans to open in Malawi but has yet to do so. Raymond Ackerman purchased three Pick n Pay supermarkets from Jack Goldin in Cape Town, and served as executive chairman until his retirement in 2010. His eldest son, Gareth, is the current chairman.\n\nDue to a slump in profits in July 2011 the company told labour unions that it would lay off 3,137 of its 36,673 staff.\n\nAs of 2018, the company was operating over 1,600 locations across 7 countries in Southern Africa. In that year's annual report, the company announced a planned expansion into Nigeria, and that it was considering expanding into Ghana. Pick n Pay also operates stores under the Boxer brand in South Africa and Swaziland.\n\nIn mid 1994, Pick 'n Pay acquired the Score & Rite Valu Supermarket chains from the Johannesburg-based Metro Group. At the time, Score stores ranged from standard urban stores to informal, \"Spaza\" rural type outlets in South Africa's previously segregated Bantustan homelands and in Lesotho, Botswana and Swaziland (approximately 160 stores), These stores targeted lower income, black and coloured population groups with basic food, and other essential products. The approximate 40 Rite Valu stores based in South Africa only, catered for predominantly white groups in smaller towns in the greater Transvaal province. The attractiveness of the acquisition may have been attributed to the year-on-year growth of both chains over the prior 4 years, and the almost blatant copying of Pick 'n Pay's \"in-house\" products, which saw Score and Rite Valu developing their own, cheaper house brands and packaging through Johannesburg based ad agency Rayner Francis-Pope & Associates, The success of the strategy led to an increase in cyclical sales, margins and over all growth. South Africa's first democratic elections and change of government could have also been a driving factor in Metro Group's willingness to sell. Shortly after being consolidated into Pick 'n Pay's marketing channel managed by the Hedley Byrne agency, the Score and Rite Valu brands were eventually phased out.\n\nThe Pick n Pay brand, which had previously remained largely unchanged since the 1970s, was redesigned in 2007. On 12 November 2007, the company announced a brand transformation in the form of a brand redesign, new uniforms, advertising campaigns, and the slogan \"Inspired by You\". This rebranding of the iconic Pick n Pay brand led to the disappearance of the apostrophe which appeared before the \"n\", which led to uproar among those working for the preservation of the apostrophe.\n\n\nIn 1984 a Pick n Pay Hypermarket was opened in Aspley, Queensland, and in Sunnybank Hills, Queensland, Australia in 1994. It was bought by Coles Myer in the 1990s.\n\nWhen the Aspley store opened, they invited all mothers who had given birth on the store's grand opening date of 7 November 1984 to bring their newborn children each year for a birthday party. These birthday parties lasted until the mid 1990s when the store was bought out.\n\nOn 1 July 2010, it was announced that all 85 stores Franklins had been sold to Metcash for A$215 million, to become part of the IGA chain. The stores will be sold individually to independent retailers.[3] Franklins' last store was located at Westfield Miranda, this being the final Franklins in Australia closed in April 2015.\n\n"}

The population of the civil parish taken at the 2011 Census was 191.\n\nThe village gave its name to the Pentrich rising, an armed uprising which occurred on the night of 9/10 June 1817. The name is controversial. While much of the planning took place in Pentrich, two of the three ringleaders were from South Wingfield and the other was from Sutton in Ashfield; the 'revolution' itself started from Hunt's Barn in South Wingfield, and the only person killed died in Wingfield Park.\n\nA gathering of some two or three hundred men (stockingers, quarrymen and iron workers), led by Jeremiah Brandreth ('The Nottingham Captain'), (an unemployed stockinger, and claimed, without substantiation, by Gyles Brandreth as an ancestor), set out from South Wingfield to march to Nottingham. They were lightly armed with pikes, scythes and a few guns, which had been hidden in a quarry in Wingfield Park, and had a set of rather unfocussed revolutionary demands, including the wiping out of the National Debt.\n\nThe organizer of the event turned out to be a government spy, who became known as Oliver the Spy, and the uprising was quashed soon after it began. Three men were hanged for their participation in the uprising, including Brandreth.\n\nWhilst St Matthew's Church is not mentioned in the Domesday book (1086), a charter of 1154–9 confirms the gift of the church of Pentrich to the canons of Darley Abbey. Of this Norman church or one which shortly after replaced it the five arcades separating the aisles from the nave, parts of the west wall and south aisle and lower part of the tower remain.\n\nThe tower was made higher in the late 14th century and the two aisles were rebuilt. Around 1430 a new pointed chancel arch was built, retaining the earlier capitals and piers and a clerestory was added. The tracery of the east window suggests a date of 1420–50.\n\nThe font stands on a pedestal dated 1662 but the bowl has decoration typical of the Norman period. During the 19th century the bowl was absent and was used for the salting of beef.\n\nOn the exterior of the south chancel wall is a scratch dial or mass clock, a sort of sundial used to show service times.\n\nPercy Bysshe Shelley wrote the pamphlet \"We Pity the Plumage, But Forget the Dying Bird\" (1817) contrasting the wretched fate of the 'Pentrich Martyrs' (Brandreth, Turner & Ludlam) to the public mourning for the death of Princess Charlotte Augusta of Wales in childbirth a day earlier.\n\nCharles Lamb wrote \"The Three Graves\" (1820) (which turns out to be not for the condemned men, but their accusers)\n\n\nHistorical romance and erotic novelist Pam Rosenthal involves the hero and heroine of her novel \"The Slightest Provocation\" in the unmasking of the Pentrich uprising's government provocateur.\n\nPaul and Clara visit the village in D.

Another feature of the N700 is that it accelerates quicker than the older 700 series Shinkansen trains, with a maximum acceleration rate of 2.6 km/h/s (0.72 m/s/s). This enables it to reach in only three minutes. Further advancements led to the development of the N700A, an incremental evolution of the N700. N700A trains can reach 285 km/h on 3,000 m curves, allowing the maximum operating speed on the Tōkaidō Shinkansen to be raised to 285 km/h.

Modified sets were re-designated \"K\" sets, with cars renumbered in the -5000 subseries.\n\nThe 16-car K sets are formed as follows.\nThe 16-car N sets were formed as follows.\n\nCars 5 and 12 each have one single-arm pantograph.\n\n, the JR-West N700 series fleet is as follows.\n\nThe N700-7000 series variant are 8-car sets operated by JR-West on through-running \"Sakura\" and \"Mizuho\" services between and on the Kyushu Shinkansen since 12 March 2011. The pre-series set (S1) was delivered to Hakata Depot in October 2008. These trains do not feature the tilting mechanism of the earlier N700 trains, as they do not run on the Tokaido Shinkansen.\n\nExternal livery is pale blue intended to evoke the colour of traditional porcelain with indigo and gold bodyside lining.\n\nFull-production JR-West sets were delivered to Hakata Depot from early April 2010. The final S set, S19, was delivered to Hakata Depot in February 2012.\n\nThe 8-car S sets, S1–S19, are formed as follows.\n\nCars 2 and 7 each have one single-arm pantograph.\n\nThese sets feature a Green car saloon in half of one car (car 6) consisting of 24 seats (6 rows) arranged in 2+2 abreast configuration with wide seats and a seat pitch of . Cars 4 to 8 (including half of car 6) are designated as \"reserved seating\" cars with 2+2 abreast configuration, 465 mm wide seats and a seat pitch of 1,040 mm. Cars 1 to 3 are \"non-reserved seating\" cars with 2+3 abreast configuration, 440 mm wide seats (460 mm in middle of 3-seat row) and a seat pitch of 1,040 mm.\n\n, the fleet consists of 19 sets, all based at Hakata Shinkansen Depot.\n\nThe N700-8000 series variant consists of ten 8-car sets operated by JR Kyushu alongside JR-West N700-7000 series \"S\" sets on through-running \"Sakura\" and \"Mizuho\" services between Shin-Osaka and Kagoshima-Chūō on the Kyushu Shinkansen since 12 March 2011. External livery is identical to the N700-7000 series \"S\" sets.\n\nThe first set, R1, was delivered to Kumamoto Depot in July 2010. Test running on the unopened section of the Kyushu Shinkansen began on 31 August 2010.\n\nThe 8-car R sets are formed as follows.\n\nCars 2 and 7 each have one single-arm pantograph.\n\nAs with the JR-West N700-7000 series sets, the R sets feature a Green car saloon in half of one car (car 6) consisting of 24 seats (6 rows) arranged in 2+2 abreast configuration. Cars 4 to 8 (including half of car 6) are designated as \"reserved seating\" cars with 2+2 abreast configuration. Cars 1 to 3 are \"non-reserved seating\" cars with 2+3 abreast configuration.\n\n, the fleet consists of 11 sets, all based at Kumamoto Shinkansen Depot.\n\nIn June 2016, JR Central announced plans to build a new prototype \"N700S\" 16-car trainset for evaluating new technology and features on the Tokaido and Sanyo Shinkansen lines from March 2018. Developed from the earlier N700 series design, the new train will incorporate a number of new features. Refinements to the ATC and braking systems will enable shorter braking distances in emergencies such as earthquakes. Optimized underfloor equipment layout will allow the same standard design to be used to produce 12-car and 8-car trainsets in the future in addition to the Tokaido Shinkansen 16-car trainsets. The optimization is intended to make the train more flexible for possible export. The optimization further allows Toshiba SCiB LTO batteries to be installed so that the train can operate at low speed in the event of a disruption to overhead power. Green cars will use active suspension to further improve ride quality, and ordinary-class cars will have AC power outlets for each seat.\n\nA 16-car prototype set (J0), assembled at the Nippon Sharyo Toyokawa plant, was unveiled at Hamamatsu depot on 10 March 2018. Beginning from 20 March, this set has been used for testing and evaluation, with full-production trains expected to enter service on the Tokaido and Sanyo Shinkansen lines from fiscal 2020.\n\nHigh-speed trials at up to 360 km/h were conducted during 2019 on the Tokaido Shinkansen. This is 28 km/h faster than the fastest speed ever achieved by the N700A, and may indicate plans to raise the maximum operating speed on the line.\nThis was a proposed export version of the N700 series design announced by JR Central Chairman Yoshiyuki Kasai at an international high-speed railway symposium held in Nagoya on 16 November 2009. Nominally specified as an 8-car set with a maximum operating speed of 330 km/h (205 mph), the train can be configured in lengths from 6 to 16 cars to suit customer requirements.\n\nThe same model is currently being considered in the developing Houston–Dallas Texas Central Railway.\n\nOn 16 November 2009, JR Central conducted a late-night high-speed demonstration run using N700 series trainset Z0, recording a maximum speed of 332 km/h (206 mph) on the Tokaido Shinkansen between and . The high-speed run was conducted as a demonstration for approximately 160 international guests attending a high-speed railway symposium in Nagoya.\n\nCar 783-2059 (car 1) of JR Central set X59 was scrapped due to fire damage sustained in an arson attack occurring on 30 June 2015. A replacement car with the same running number was built by Nippon Sharyo in 2016.\n\nOn 11 December 2017, Car 785-5505 (carriage 13) of JR West set K5 (a 16-car N700A built by Kawasaki Heavy Industries) was taken out of service at Nagoya Station after engineers confirmed an unusual burning smell. The smell was detected at Kokura Station, but was ordered by the operational centre to continue service until Nagoya which JR West later admitted was a \"big danger\". An on-site inspection revealed that the outer frame of the carriage had cracked and its underfloor carriage was leaking oil. It was the first \"serious incident\" involving any Shinkansen, and Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism reported that the train could have derailed had it continued on service and the carriage frame broke. An investigation by JR West implicated companies involved in the construction of the trainset, which included Kawasaki Heavy Industries, Nippon Steel and Mitsubishi Electric. The investigation revealed that at least 100 out of the 303 Kawasaki-made bogies were substandard due to improper welding preparations, which caused the base material of the bogies to become 4.7mm in thickness, instead of the required 7mm or more. Following the events JR West is planning to gradually replace all the bogies that were provided by Kawasaki.\n\nThe annual totals for the fleet sizes (number of vehicles as of 1 April each year) owned by JR Central, JR West, and JR Kyushu are as follows.\n\n\n\n"}

After studying art and philosophy at the University of Constantinople, he moved to Novgorod in 1370, and in 1395 to Moscow. His style is considered unsurpassed in expression achieved by almost mono-colored painting. Some of his contemporaries observed that he appeared to be \"painting with a broom\", in reference to the bold, broad execution in some of his finest frescos (see ), which are unique in the larger Byzantine tradition. Theophanes was described by the Muscovites as \"learned in philosophy\", a reflection on his broad education and erudition. A hint of this might be gathered from his panel icon of the Transfiguration of Jesus, where the arresting geometry and brilliance of the figure of Christ is balanced against the ordered disarray of the earthbound Apostles, strewn about doll-like in the uncreated Light of Mount Tabor. The balance of mathematical harmony in line and shape, wed to a master's use of an earthtone palette and precious gold leaf, evokes a spirituality that is immensely powerful, and speaks to the genius of this relatively unknown painter.\n\nTheophanes decorated in fresco the walls and ceilings of many churches including:\n\nAlthough he created panel icons, works attributed to Theophanes have become a topic of intense academic debate based on historical evidence.

Gardner is notable for his involvement in the sale of Manchester United to American businessman Malcolm Glazer and his controversial spell as chairman of Plymouth Argyle, which resulted in the club entering administration with debts of over £17 million and accusations of financial mismanagement.\n\nBorn in Brentford, he was the eldest son of a carpenter, Roy Thomas Gardner, and his wife Iris Joan (née Paine) and was brought up in Middlesex and Surrey in humble surroundings. He initially wanted to be a professional footballer, and supported Manchester United from the age of 8. He went to Strode's School (a grammar school, which became Strode's College in 1975) in Surrey. In the holidays he worked at Wall's.\n\nGardner started his career at the British Aircraft Corporation through their accounting apprentice scheme, working in the Commercial Aircraft Division from 1963 to 1975. He joined the Marconi Company Ltd in 1975. From 1979 to 1985, he was Group Finance Director of the Marconi Space and Defence part of the company. From January 1986 he was the Finance Director of Standard Telephones and Cables (STC plc). He became managing director of STC Communication Systems. Nortel took over STC in 1991 and he became chief operating officer of Northern Telecom Europe. He then became managing director of GEC Marconi Ltd, succeeding Arnold Weinstock from 1992 to 1994.\n\nGardner joined British Gas in November 1994 as Executive Director, Finance and was involved in splitting the company into two parts. He was the Chief Executive of Centrica plc from February 1997 (when it first formed when British Gas demerged) until October 2005. Under his leadership, Centrica bought the AA. He was replaced by Sam Laidlaw. During his time with Centrica, he was listed in the Harvard Business Review’s Best-Performing CEOs in the World.\n\nIn 2001, Gardner was appointed as chairman by Mainstream Renewable Power, the privately held renewable energy development company with wind projects in England, Scotland, Germany and South Africa. In July 2006, Gardner became non-executive Chairman of Compass Group plc, the British multinational contract food service, cleaning, property management and support services company. He retired from this role in 2014. He has also been non-executive Chairman of Connaught plc, the FTSE 250 support services company. He was chairman of Enserve, the infrastructure services company in the UK, operating in the electricity, water and analytics sectors, from its inception in 2010 until 2014.\n\nIn 2014, he joined the board of William Hill as senior independent non-executive Director, serving as a member of the Audit and Risk, Remuneration, Nomination and Corporate Responsibility Committees. In 2015, Gardner became chairman of Serco, the British outsourcing company which operates public and private transport and traffic control, aviation, military weapons, detention centres, prisons and schools. He was a director at Willis Towers Watson until January 2016 and is currently a Senior Adviser to Credit Suisse, providing counsel to clients in a variety of sectors including energy, utilities, industrials and leisure and services.\n\nSir Roy is the Chairman of the Advisory Board of the Energy Futures Lab at Imperial College London. He has chaired the Apprenticeship Ambassadors Network and is a Fellow of the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants, the Royal Aeronautical Society, and the Royal Society of Arts. He is a companion of the Chartered Management Institute.\n\nIn June 2007 he became President of the Energy Institute. In 2008, he was awarded an honorary doctorate by Thames Valley University. The same year he was named 27th Most Powerful Executive in the retail industry by The Telegraph.\nGardner is also a Fellow of the City and Guilds Institute and a governor at St Albans School.\n\nGardner raised £80,000 climbing Mount Kilimanjaro for the Carers Association, of which he was president. He has also been a council member of the Prince's Youth Business Trust and chairman of the Employers' Federation on Disability as well as a Trustee of the Development Trust for the Disabled. Gardner has also completed four marathons, raising funds for a variety of charities. He is also on the board of the Combat Stress charity, the Veterans mental health charity.\n\nGardner became a director of Manchester United in December 1999. He was appointed as non-executive chairman of Manchester United plc in November 2001, taking over from Sir Roland Smith on 31 March 2002. In April 2005, he and the Manchester United board issued a statement recommending against the proposed buyout by Malcolm Glazer and his family, saying the \"proposed capital structure […] still contains more leverage [debt] than the board would consider prudent\"; however, they were forced to issue a contrary statement a month later, once the Glazers had acquired enough shares to constitute a majority stake in the club. Gardner resigned as chairman in June 2005, shortly after the Glazer takeover, as did his fellow non-executive directors Jim O'Neill and Ian Mutch. In 2010, Gardner reiterated his criticism of the method the Glazers used to purchase Manchester United, describing it as not \"a sustainable model\".\n\nIn July 2009, Gardner and business partner Keith Todd secured ownership of 13 percent of Championship team Plymouth Argyle as part of a consortium of international and local businesses which took over the club. He stated that it was the consortium's ambition to see Argyle promoted to the English Premier League within five years and focused on the club’s bid to host the World Cup finals in 2018. Gardner also stated that he wished to \"develop a better understanding of the club's precise needs, plan to progressively increase the budget for new players, in particular as we grow the commercial income of the club\".\n\nDuring Gardner's chairmanship, the football club was issued with a number of winding up orders over unpaid taxes and debts. It entered a repayment strategy, involving the sale of players Reda Johnson and Craig Noone.\nIn March 2010, the club announced that Home Park was to be transferred to the holding company owned by Gardner, Todd and Yasuaki Kagami. Gardner stated that no money would go directly to the club and that the £7.5 million received would be used to pay off the club’s debts. This included the money owed to directors.\nGardner, Todd and their co-investors spent more than £3m in an attempt to save the club. Gardner himself almost trebled his stake. Kagami said the directors were “fighting tooth and nail to make sure the club does not go into administration.”\nGardner resigned as chairman on 27 December 2010 and the club entered administration shortly afterwards. The club formally exited administration on 31 October 2011 but only after Plymouth City Council agreed to re-purchase the stadium and other land belonging to the club was sold to local entrepreneur James Brent. The club was close to being liquidated after 125 years of history whilst staff had been without pay for almost a year.\n\n\n"}

He was a modern poet and his works are associated with the criticism of traditions. He also made translation of literary works from French into Persian.\n\nIraj was born in October 1874 in Tabriz, northwestern Iran. His pedigree chart shows that he was a great-grandson of Fath Ali Shah Qajar, the second shah of Qajar dynasty (reigned 1797–1834). Iraj's father, prince Gholam-Hossein Mirza was son of prince Malek Iraj Mirza son of Fath Ali Shah Qajar.\n\nGholam-Hossein Mirza, Iraj's father, was a poet laureate or the official court-poet of Mozaffar al-Din Mirza. Mozaffar al-Din Mirza, the son of Nasser-al-Din Shah (the fourth shah of Qajar dynasty reigned 1848–1896), was the Crown Prince of Iran at the time. (As a tradition, all Crown Princes during Qajar era used to reside in Tabriz).\n\nThough some sources indicate that Iraj was schooled privately, there are reliable evidences that he studied at a branch of the Dārolfonoon (House of Sciences and Techniques) in Tabriz. At 15, he was fluent in Persian, French, Arabic and Azerbaijani. He was also familiar with the art of calligraphy. His handwriting was very artistic and he was and still is considered as one of the famous calligraphers of Iran.\n\nIn 1890, at the age of 16, Iraj got married. When he was 19, both his father and wife died.\n\nHe then took the position of his late father and became the court-poet of Mozaffar al-Din Mirza . At 22, when Mozaffar al-Din Mirza acceded to the throne in 1896 and became Mozaffar al-Din Shah; Iraj was titled as the Head of Poets (in Persian: Sadr o-Shoʻarā). He was then titled as \"Jalāl ol-Mamālek\".\n\nFew years later, however, he left the royal court and joined the Tabriz office of Ali Khan Amin al-Dowleh who was the governor of Iranian Azarbaijan. At this time, Iraj learned French and became very familiar with Russian too.\n\nIn 1905, when Amino-Dowleh was relocated and moved to Tehran, Iraj also accompanied him and soon became involved in the Persian Constitutional Revolution. In 1907 when Ahmad Ghavam (Qavam os-Saltaneh), a governmental authority, was assigned to go to Europe, Iraj was asked to join him. Two years later, Iraj returned to Tehran where he started to work as a staff member in the \"Office of Official Compositions\" (in Persian: Dār ol-ʻenshā).\n\nIn 1915, his first son, Ja'afar Gholi Mirza, due to some psychological problems, committed suicide.\n\nIn 1917, Iraj joined the newly established Ministry of Culture, and three years later he was transferred to the Ministry of Finance and Revenue. From 1920 to 1925 he worked as a Revenue Officer in Mashhad, the capital city of Khorasan Province (now Razavi Khorasan), in northeast of Iran.\n\nAt 52, Iraj moved back to Tehran where he died on March 14, 1926.\n\nHe was survived by his second son, Khosrow Iraj.\n\nIraj is considered as one of the famous contemporary poets of Iran and also as the first Iranian master of colloquial poetry. In his verses he uses words from everyday speech. The origin of this tendency has come to be identified with his name. Through Iraj, poetic language was enriched with many colloquial words and expressions. His simple poetic language is also famous for its witticism and satire.\n\nDuring Qajar era, Iraj was influenced by the Persian Constitutional Revolution (1906–1911) and by the changing circumstances in the country. This fact is manifested in the particular style of poetry that he created. Modern and imported concepts, combined with what were obtained from his own thoughts, form the framework of his style. He criticizes the social conditions of the country, and the striking originality in his use of metaphor when addressing diverse social problems has been admirable by his critics.\n\nHis style is rich in the art of simile. His striking sarcasm, pungent and fanged words are pointed at the dishonest clergy, businessmen, merchants and statesmen. In addition to those colloquial poems, Iraj also composed elegies to praise Mozzafar-al-Din Shah, Hassan Ali Khan Garroosy (also known as Amir Nezam Garroosy, the governor of Iranian Azarbaijan (now East Azarbaijan and West Azarbaijan) and Kermanshah during Qajar era), and many other Qajar personalities. His praise never shaded into flattery. Iraj also composed very nice massnawi and qat'aa on the raising and education of children, maternal affection, love and romance.\n\nHe was an enlightened and innovative poet, and tended towards European thought.\n\nDespite his famous technical skills, he sometimes used similar cases of rhyme, which is considered by some poetry researchers as an intentional rejection of strict traditional poetical rules. Although Iraj was one of the pioneers of the innovative movement in Persian poetry, he never thought of abandoning the rules of classical poetry. Some scholars believe that because of the time in which he lived, his depth of literary knowledge and his familiarity with French and other foreign languages, he could also have been one of the masters of free verse if he had wanted to.\n\nHe is particularly famous for his pederastic and satirical poetry.\n\nAmong many poems that Iraj composed, his well-known poems include Satan (in Persian: Ebleess), Mother (in Persian: Maadar), A Letter to a Poet Aref Ghazvini (in Persian: Arefnameh), Woman's Picture (in Persian: Tassvir-e Zan), Story of the Veil or Hijab (in Persian: hejab) and the Story of Zohreh and Manouchehr (in Persian: Daastan-e Zohreh o Manouchehr), which is based on William Shakespeare's Venus and Adonis.\n\nIn Mother, the poet describes a child's affection for his/her mother and how the mother nurtures the child from birth onwards. The words Iraj uses are exquisitely descriptive and lovely not only in its original Persian but even in translated versions.\n\nThe Story of Zohreh and Manouchehr is one of his famous poetic works. Here Iraj tells the story based on the Greek myth of Venus and Adonis. In this poem, Zohreh leaves the gods and comes to Earth, where she is overcome by the pleasing charm of Manouchehr in his armor. He rejects her advances while Zohreh attempts her first seduction. She goes to great pains to explain the beauty of lovemaking and she finally goes her own way as she returns to the gods.\n\nOn December 8, 2004 the last Iranian movies launched in France was The Story of Zohreh and Manouchehr directed by Mitra Farahani. The film had already participated in the Berlin film festival and several other international events and attracted many viewers.\n\nIraj believed that the status of Iranian women at his time was reminiscent of the Dark Ages. Iraj could not bear to see that life was intolerable, unbearable and miserable for the courageous and valorous women of Iran. That was why he composed the very powerful and memorable pieces of women's daily lives in his poems.\n\nHis tomb is in Zahir-od-dowleh cemetery between Darband and Tajrish located in Shemiran, north of Tehran.\n\n\n\n"}

This led to the setting up of ED50 as a consistent mapping datum for much of Western Europe. It was, and still is, used in much of Western Europe apart from Great Britain, Ireland, Sweden and Switzerland, which have their own datums.\n\nIt used the International Ellipsoid of 1924 (\"Hayford-Ellipsoid\" of 1909) (radius of the Earth's equator 6378.388 km, flattening 1/297, both exact). That spheroid was an early attempt to model the whole Earth and was widely used around the world until the 1980s when GRS 80 and WGS 84 were established.\n\nMany national coordinate systems of Gauss–Krüger are defined by ED50 and oriented by means of geodetic astronomy. Up to now it has been used in databases of gravity fields, cadastre, small surveying networks in Europe and America, and by some developing countries with no modern baselines. ED50 was also part of the fundamentals of the NATO coordinates (Gauss–Krüger and UTM) up to the 1980s.\n\nThe geodetic datum of ED50 was centred at the Helmertturm on the Telegrafenberg in Potsdam, (then East) Germany; the intent was to encourage cooperation with the socialist states during the cold war, which failed. The adjustments for later versions of the datum (ED77, ED79) used the Munich Frauenkirche as starting point.\n\nThe longitude and latitude lines on the two datums are the same in the Archangel region of north-west Russia. As one moves westwards across Europe, the longitude lines on ED50 gradually become further west than their WGS 84 equivalents, and are around 100 metres west in Spain and Portugal. Moving southwards, the latitude lines on ED50 gradually become further south than the WGS 84 lines, and are around 100 m south in the Mediterranean Sea. \n\nThis means that if the lines are further west, the longitude value of any given point becomes more easterly. Similarly, if the lines are south, the values become northerly. This is due to the fact that the International Ellipsoid is larger than the GRS 80/WGS 84 ellipsoid, so a given north-south distance will cover more latitude on the new ellipsoid, and a given east-west distance will cover more longitude.\n\nThe datum shift for the Universal Transverse Mercator grid is different. The eastings vary between 0 m in Eastern Europe and 100 m in the far west of the continent, roughly similar to the longitude shift, but the northings are about 200 m different across Europe, with the ED50 UTM northing lines south of the WGS 84 UTM northing lines. UTM northings are measured from the Equator; distance from the equator to latitude 50 degrees is 112 m more on the International than on the WGS 84 spheroid.\n\n"}

The term \"communal apartments\" is a product of the Soviet epoch. The concept of communal apartments' grew in Russia and the Soviet Union as a response to a housing crisis in urban areas – authorities presented them as the product of the “new collective vision of the future.” Between two and seven families typically shared a communal apartment. Each family had its own room, which often served as a living room, dining room, and bedroom for the entire family. All the residents of the entire apartment shared the use of the hallways, kitchen (commonly known as the \"communal kitchen\"), bathroom and telephone (if any). The communal apartment became the predominant form of housing in the USSR for generations, and examples still exist in \"the most fashionable central districts of large Russian cities\".\n\nThe first communal apartments appeared in the early 18th century, when rental lodging was partitioned by the landlords into \"corners\", often walk-through tiny dwellings. From the mid-19th century the number of such apartments had drastically increased. Usually they consisted of 3 to 6 rooms.\nIn the 20th century, the Soviet Union undertook “intensive industrialization and urbanization,” shifting from eighty percent of the population living in rural villages and towns at the time of the Revolution, to nearly the same percentage living in cities by the 1990s. People were driven from the countryside by poverty and collectivization, and pulled to the city by the industrialization of the economy. This exodus put enormous pressure on existing urban housing accommodations. Communal apartments were one answer to the housing crisis, and many considered them a step up from the alternatives of housing communes, hostels and barracks.\nLenin conceived of the communal apartment, and drafted a plan to “expropriate and resettle private apartments” shortly after the Russian revolution. His plan inspired many architects to begin communal housing projects, to create a “revolutionary topography.” The communal apartment was revolutionary by “uniting different social groups in one physical space.” Furthermore, housing belonged to the government and families were allotted an extremely small number of square meters each.\n\nAfter Stalin's death in 1953, Khrushchev's regime “embarked upon a mass housing campaign,” to eliminate the persistent housing shortages, and create private apartments for urban residents. This campaign was a response to popular demand for “better living conditions, single-family housing, and greater privacy;” Khrushchev believed that granting the people private apartments would give them greater enthusiasm for the communist system in place and that improving people's attitudes and living conditions would lead to a healthier and more productive workforce. However, the new apartments were built quickly, with an emphasis on quantity over quality, and in underdeveloped neighborhoods, with poor systems of public transportation, making daily life harder for workers. These apartment blocks quickly became called ‘khrushchyoba,’ a cross between Khrushchev's name and the Russian term for slums.\n\nSpace in communal apartments was divided into common spaces and private rooms “mathematically or bureaucratically,” with little to no attention paid to the physical space of the existing structures. Most apartments were partitioned in a dysfunctional manner, creating “strange spaces, long corridors, and so-called black entrances through labyrinthine inner courtyards.” Entire families lived in a single overcrowded room, with little hope of changing their situation.\nResidents were meant to share the kitchen, bathroom and corridors amongst themselves, but even these spaces could be divided. For example, each family might have their own kitchen table, gas burner, doorbell, and even light switch, preferring to walk down the hall to use their light switch to turn on the bathroom lights rather than using a closer switch belonging to another resident. Furthermore, the hallways were often poorly lit, because each family had control of one of the lights hanging in the corridor, and would only turn it on for their own benefit. Though communal apartments were relatively small, residents had to wait at times to use the bathroom or kitchen sink. The kitchen was the primary place the residents interacted with one another, “sharing their joys and sorrows,” and scheduling shared responsibilities. Wary of theft, residents rarely left groceries in the kitchen unless they put locks on the kitchen cabinets. However, they often stored their toiletries in the kitchen as opposed to the bathroom, because other residents could more easily use things left unattended in the bathroom. Laundry was left to dry in both the kitchen and the bathroom.\n\nThe communal apartment was the only living accommodation in the Soviet Union where the residents had “no particular reason to be living together.” Other forms of communal living were based around type of work or other commonalities, but the communal apartment residents were placed together at random, as a result of the distribution of scarce living space by a governing body. These residents had little commitment to communal living or to each other. In spite of the haphazard nature of their cohabitation, residents had to navigate communal living, which required shared responsibilities and reliance on one another. Duty schedules were posted in the kitchen or corridors, typically assigning one family to be “on duty” at any given moment. The family on duty would be responsible for cleaning the common spaces by sweeping and mopping the kitchen every few days, cleaning the bathroom and taking out the trash. The length of time a family was scheduled to work usually depended on the size of the family, and the rotation followed the order of the rooms in the apartment.\nCommunal living posed unique challenges; one author tells of an incident when a drunk neighbor passed out on the floor in front of the entrance to their room and urinated, to the horror of her mother, who was entertaining foreign guests when the “little yellow stream slowly made its way through the door of the room.” She relates this incident to the experience of communal living, “both intimate and public, with a mixture of ease and fear in the presence of foreigners and neighbors.” Tenants in communal apartments are “like family in some respects and like strangers in others.” Neighbors are forced to interact with each other, and they know nearly everything about each other, their schedules and daily routines, profession, habits, relationships and opinions, prohibiting any sense of privacy in the communal apartment.\n\nThe communal kitchen was an epicenter of the communal life in the apartment, with its news and gossips, joys and dramas, friendly shared salt and nasty practical jokes.\nSpying was especially prevalent in the communal apartment, because of the extremely close quarters people lived in. It was not unusual for a neighbor to look or listen into another resident's room or the common room and to gossip about others. Furthermore, the communal apartment was “a breeding ground of police informants,” people were encouraged to denounce their neighbors, and often did so to ensure safety for themselves or to gain their neighbor's room for themselves after they had them evicted or imprisoned.\nSome individuals chose to get married simply to upgrade to a bigger apartment.\nOne way that families were able to improve their living conditions was to “exchange” their living quarters. If a family was separated by divorce they could trade spaces, for example one could swap out one large space for 2 smaller units to accommodate a family. \nIn spite of all these challenges, many former residents of communal apartments look back fondly on the sense of family they had with their neighbors. When asked which she would prefer, one woman who lived her whole life in a communal apartment in St. Petersburg said\n\n"}

The former leader of the autonomist movement \"Lotta Continua\" (\"Continuous Struggle\") in the 1960s, he was arrested in 1988 and sentenced to 22 years of prison, having been found guilty of instigating the murder of police officer Luigi Calabresi. Sofri, and the others comrades convicted with him, have always proclaimed their innocence. The charges against them rested on the testimony of a \"pentito\" (\"collaborator of justice\"), Leonardo Marino. While in prison, Sofri wrote for various newspapers, such as \"Il Foglio\", \"La Repubblica\", and \"Panorama\".\n\nAdriano Sofri was born 1 August 1942 in Trieste.\n\nOn 12 December 1969 a bomb exploded at the Piazza Fontana in Milan. Among those brought in for questioning was militant anarchist Giuseppe Pinelli. On 15 December 1969, while in police custody Pinelli fell from a fourth floor window of the police building in Milan. The policemen present in the interrogation room claimed that Pinelli committed suicide, but many leftist circles believed him to have been murdered. An initial investigation in 1970 ruled Pinelli's death an accident. (A subsequent inquiry in 1975 concurred, holding that Pinelli had fainted due to an \"active illness\").\n\nDespite the fact that it was established that Calabresi had not been in the room at the time of Pinelli's death, he became the target of an extensive media campaign led by the \"Lotta Continua\" newspaper and the weekly \"L'Espresso\" because of his alleged involvement in Pinelli's death. On 15 December 1969, the Lotta Continua newspaper directed by Sofri explicitly claimed that Calabresi had to be \"shot dead\". The press campaign against Calabresi continued for the next two years.\n\nOn the morning of 17 May 1972 Calabresi was shot and killed outside his home. Members of \"Lotta Continua\" were considered to be the prime suspects.\n\nIn July 1988, Leonardo Marino, an ex-activist, confessed to taking part in the assassination of Calabresi. Marino claimed that he was driving the car, while Ovidio Bompressi allegedly shot Calabresi. He said that the assassination had been decided by Adriano Sofri and Giorgio Pietrostefani, the leaders of \"Lotta Continua\". Based on testimony provided by Marino, on 28 July 1988, Sofri was arrested with Ovidio Bompressi and Giorgio Pietrostefani for the murder of police officer Luigi Calabresi on 17 May 1972.\n\nIn the long series of trials, that spanned about two decades and that alternated acquittals with sentences of guilt, the evidence against Sofri was only the confession of \"pentito\" (\"collaborator of justice\") Leonardo Marino, who accused Sofri of having ordered him, as chief of \"Lotta Continua\", to assassinate Calabresi, during a meeting held on a piazza after a demonstration in Pisa on 13 May 1972, in the name of Franco Serantini, an anarchist who died from lack of care in the police station following a demonstration in the same city on May 5.\n\nSofri denied having talked with Marino at this alleged meeting, pointing out that on this day, it was pouring with rain, and that the town was under surveillance by the police. This was confirmed by other participants of the demonstration.\n\nSofri was convicted on 2 May 1990 and sentenced to serve 22 years in the prison of Pisa . Pietrostefani and Bompressi also received 22 years, while Marino was sentenced to 11 years.\n\nBy the time the appeals process began various pieces of evidence were no longer available. The clothes which Calabresi was wearing on the day of his death were never found. The blue Fiat 125 (which Marino declared beige) was sent to the breaker's yard on 31 December 1988. The bullet which killed Calabresi was auctioned on 15 April 1990, after a flood which had damaged the office holding the material evidence of the case.\n\nIn July 1991, the Court of Appeals upheld the convictions, but this was reversed the following year by the Court of Cassation. Sofri and others were acquitted in 1993. However, after the Cassation's cancellation of the previous judgment, a new trial took place, and they were convicted, again, to 22 years of prison, in 1995 — (Sofri, Marino and others were also accused of armed robberies). The Court of Cassation confirmed this last judgment in 1997. Pietrostefani, was residing in France with and no chances of being extradited.\n\nMarino initially claimed that the weight of his conscience had pushed him to confess his crimes, which he allegedly had done on 19 July 1988 to the carabinieri in Ameglia, a little town, before going to Milan where he allegedly described with precision the assassination of Calabresi — remaining before to general facts — to Ferdinando Pomarici, substitute of the attorney, and investigative magistrate Antonio Lombardi. However, on 20 February 1990, two years after the beginning of the trial, a witness of the Court, carabinieri officer Emilio Rossi, declared that Marino had first presented himself to the carabinieris in Ameglia on 2 July 1988. Although historian Carlo Ginzburg has interrogated himself on the possibility that Marino's contact with the carabinieri were to be traced to May, in any cases, the judicial documents did not register this period during which Marino was in contact with the Italian authorities.\n\nA lot of other discrepancies in Marino's testimony against Sofri have led many to suspect the reliability of his words, on which Sofri's sentence exclusively relies. These include his first account, where he claimed that Bompressi and Sofri ordered him the assassination, whether that later became only Sofri; his description of the itinerary that he allegedly followed immediately after the crime, during which he said he had gone in the exact opposite direction of where the Fiat had been finally abandoned; confusion about when his qualms of conscience came to arise, as soon as 1972 or in \"the last three years\"; the fact that he had been convicted for armed robbery on 1987, thus making his claims about his moral concerns dubious ...\n\nFurthermore, the description of the crime scene by eyewitnesses contradicted those of Leonardo Marino. But the Cour d'assise of Milan, headed by the president Manlio Minale, finally decided that Marino's testimony was completely reliable, which was allegedly not the case of those various eyewitnesses invoked during the trial.\n\nOn the other hand, it has to be noticed that Marino's confession was given so much time after the facts that some contradictions are somewhat unavoidable.\n\nIn favor of Sofri, there was a large opinion movement, including politicians, intellectuals and artists, including Dario Fo, Giuliano Ferrara, Gad Lerner, Luigi Ciotti, Walter Veltroni, Piero Fassino, judge Ferdinando Imposimato, Marco Pannella, Vasco Rossi, Adriano Celentano, Jovanotti, Gianna Nannini, Paolo Hendel, Emmanuelle Béart, Manuel Vázquez Montalbán, Vittorio Sgarbi, Francesco Tullio Altan, Niccolò Ammaniti, Stefano Benni, Gianni Vattimo, Andrea Zanzotto, Franco Battiato, Lucio Dalla, Fabrizio De André, Bernardo Bertolucci, Fabio Fazio, Gillo Pontecorvo, Gabriele Salvatores and Massimo Cacciari.\n\nThe convictions were upheld in 2000. Sofri has always maintained his innocence and continues to do so to this day. He has become a columnist writing for \"Il Foglio\" and \"La Repubblica\". He also writes editorials in \"Panorama\".\n\nAt the end of November, 2005, Adriano Sofri suffered Boerhaave syndrome while in prison. He was moved to a hospital and was considered for a pardon, but Justice Minister Roberto Castelli refused in December 2005 to grant one. However, after the defeat of the Silvio Berlusconi government during the April 2006 election, the new Justice Minister, Clemente Mastella, announced that Sofri could be pardoned before the end of the calendar year, although he continued to refuse to ask for a pardon, saying such a request would be admission of guilt. The Justice Minister nonetheless argued that \"The truth is that 34 years after the events Sofri is a very sick person to whom one can offer a spontaneously humane gesture.\" He did not receive a pardon, but from 2007 he was allowed to serve his sentence under house arrest for medical reasons. The 22-year sentence ended in January 2012.\n\nCarlo Ginzburg, who usually studies witch-hunts during the Inquisition and microhistory, has written a book concerning this alleged \"miscarriage of justice\" and the relations, and differences, between the works of a judge and of a historian.\n\n\n\n"}
