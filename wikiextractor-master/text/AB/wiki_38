It states that the vertices of every large enough graph can be partitioned into a bounded number of parts so that the edges between different parts behave almost randomly.\n\nAccording to the lemma, no matter how large a graph is, we can approximate it with the edge densities between a bounded number of parts. Between any two parts, the distribution of edges will be pseudorandom as per the edge density. These approximations provide essentially correct values for various properties of the graph, such as the number of embedded copies of a given subgraph or the number of edge deletions required to remove all copies of some subgraph.\n\nTo state Szemerédi's regularity lemma formally, we must formalize what the edge distribution between parts behaving 'almost randomly' really means. By 'almost random', we're referring to a notion called -regularity. To understand what this means, we first state some definitions. In what follows is a graph with vertex set .\n\nDefinition 1. Let be disjoint subsets of . The edge density of the pair is defined as:\n\nwhere denotes the set of edges having one end vertex in and one in .\n\nWe call a pair of parts -regular if, whenever you take a large subset of each part, their edge density isn't too far off the edge density of the pair of parts. Formally,\n\nDefinition 2. For , a pair of vertex sets and is called -regular, if for all subsets , satisfying , , we have\n\nThe natural way to define an -regular partition should be one where each pair of parts is -regular. However, some graphs, such as the half graphs, require many pairs of partitions (but a small fraction of all pairs) to be irregular. So we shall define -regular partitions to be one where most pairs of parts are -regular.\n\nDefinition 3. A partition of formula_3 into formula_4 sets formula_5 is called an formula_6-regular partition if\nNow we can state the lemma:\n\nSzemerédi's Regularity Lemma. For every and positive integer there exists an integer such that if is a graph with at least vertices, there exists an integer in the range and an -regular partition of the vertex set of into sets.\n\nThe bound for the number of parts in the partition of the graph given by the proofs of Szemeredi's regularity lemma is very large, given by a -level iterated exponential of . At one time it was hoped that the true bound was much smaller, which would have had several useful applications. However found examples of graphs for which does indeed grow very fast and is at least as large as a -level iterated exponential of . In particular the best bound has level exactly 4 in the Grzegorczyk hierarchy, and so is not an elementary recursive function.\n\nWe shall find an ε-regular partition for a given graph following an algorithm. A rough outline:\n\n\nWe apply a technique called the energy increment argument to show that this process terminates after a bounded number of steps. Basically, we define a monovariant which must increase by a certain amount in each step, but it's bounded above and thus cannot increase indefinitely. This monovariant is called 'energy' as it's an formula_8 quantity.\n\nDefinition 4. Let be subsets of . Set formula_9. The energy of the pair is defined as:\n\nFor partitions formula_11 of and formula_12 of , we define the energy to be the sum of the energies between each pair of parts:\n\nFinally, for a partition formula_5 of , define the energy of formula_15 to be formula_16. Specifically,\n\nObserve that energy is between 0 and 1 because edge density is bounded above by 1:\n\nNow, we start by proving that energy does not decrease upon refinement.\n\nLemma 1. (Energy is nondecreasing under partitioning) For any partitions formula_19 and formula_20 of vertex sets formula_21 and formula_22, formula_23.\n\nProof: Let formula_24 and formula_25. Choose vertices formula_26 uniformly from formula_21 and formula_28 uniformly from formula_22, with formula_26 in part formula_31 and formula_28 in part formula_33. Then define the random variable formula_34. Let us look at properties of formula_35. The expectation is\n\nThe second moment is\n\nBy convexity, formula_38. Rearranging, we get that formula_39 for all formula_40.formula_41\nIf each part of formula_15 is further partitioned, the new partition is called a refinement of formula_15. Now, if formula_44, applying Lemma 1 to each pair formula_45 proves that for every refinement formula_46 of formula_15, formula_48. Thus the refinement step in the algorithm doesn't lose any energy.\n\nLemma 2. (Energy boost lemma) If formula_49 is not formula_6-regular as witnessed by formula_51, then,\n\nProof: Define formula_35 as above. Then,\n\nBut observe that formula_55 with probability formula_56(corresponding to formula_57 and formula_58), so\n\nNow we can prove the energy increment argument, which shows that energy increases substantially in each iteration of the algorithm.\n\nLemma 3 (Energy increment lemma) If a partition formula_5 of formula_62 is not formula_6-regular, then there exists a refinement formula_64 of formula_15 where every formula_66 is partitioned into at most formula_67 parts such that\n\nProof: For all formula_69 such that formula_45 is not formula_6-regular, find formula_72 and formula_73 that witness irregularity (do this simultaneously for all irregular pairs). Let formula_64 be a common refinement of formula_15 by formula_76's. Each formula_66 is partitioned into at most formula_67 parts as desired. Then,\n\nWhere formula_80 is the partition of formula_66 given by formula_64. By Lemma 1, the above quantity is at least\n\nSince formula_66 is cut by formula_76 when creating formula_64, so formula_80 is a refinement of formula_88. By lemma 2, the above sum is at least\n\nBut the second sum is at least formula_90 since formula_15 is not formula_6-regular, so we deduce the desired inequality. formula_41\nNow, starting from any partition, we can keep applying Lemma 3 as long as the resulting partition isn't formula_6-regular. But in each step energy increases by formula_90, and it's bounded above by 1. Then this process can be repeated at most formula_96 times, before it terminates and we must have an formula_6-regular partition.\n\nIf we have enough information about the regularity of a graph, we can count the number of copies of a specific subgraph within the graph up to small error.\n\nGraph Counting Lemma. Let formula_98 be a graph with formula_99, and let formula_100. Let formula_101 be an formula_102-vertex graph with vertex sets formula_103 such that formula_45 is formula_6-regular whenever formula_106. Then, the number of labeled copies of formula_98 in formula_101 is within formula_109 of\n\nThis can be combined with Szemerédi's regularity lemma to prove the Graph removal lemma. The graph removal lemma can be used to prove Roth's Theorem on Arithmetic Progressions, and a generalization of it, the hypergraph removal lemma, can be used to prove Szemerédi's theorem.\n\nThe graph removal lemma generalizes to induced subgraphs, by considering edge edits instead of only edge deletions. This was proved by Alon, Fischer, Krivelevich, and Szegedy in 2000. However, this required a stronger variation of the regularity lemma.\n\nSzemerédi's regularity lemma does not provide meaningful results in sparse graphs. Since sparse graphs have subconstant edge densities, formula_6-regularity is trivially satisfied.\n\n first introduced a weaker version of this lemma, restricted to bipartite graphs, in order to prove Szemerédi's theorem,\nand in he proved the full lemma. Extensions of the regularity method to hypergraphs were obtained by Rödl and his collaborators and Gowers.\n\nJános Komlós, Gábor Sárközy and Endre Szemerédi later (in 1997) proved in the blow-up lemma that the regular pairs in Szemerédi regularity lemma behave like complete bipartite graphs under the correct conditions. The lemma allowed for deeper exploration into the nature of embeddings of large sparse graphs into dense graphs.\n\nThe first constructive version was provided by Alon, Duke, Lefmann, Rödl and Yuster.\nSubsequently, Frieze and Kannan gave a different version and extended it to hypergraphs. They later produced a different construction due to Alan Frieze and Ravi Kannan that uses singular values of matrices. One can find more efficient non-deterministic algorithms, as formally detailed in Terence Tao's blog and implicitly mentioned in various papers.\n\nAn inequality of Terence Tao extends the Szemerédi regularity lemma, by revisiting it from the perspective of probability theory and information theory instead of graph theory. Terence Tao has also provided a proof of the lemma based on spectral theory, using the adjacency matrices of graphs.\n\nIt is not possible to prove a variant of the regularity lemma in which all pairs of partition sets are regular. Some graphs, such as the half graphs, require many pairs of partitions (but a small fraction of all pairs) to be irregular.\n\nIt is a common variant in the definition of an formula_6-regular partition to require that the vertex sets all have the same size, while collecting the leftover vertices in an \"error\"-set formula_113 whose size is at most an formula_6-fraction of the size of the vertex set of formula_101.\n\nA stronger variation of the regularity lemma was proven by Alon, Fischer, Krivelevich, and Szegedy while proving the induced graph removal lemma. This works with a sequence of formula_6 instead of just one, and shows that there exists a partition with an extremely regular refinement, where the refinement doesn't have too large of an energy increment.\n\nSzemerédi's regularity lemma can be interpreted as saying that the space of all graphs is totally bounded (and hence precompact) in a suitable metric (the cut distance). Limits in this metric can be represented by graphons; another version of the regularity lemma simply states that the space of graphons is compact.\n\n"}
{"id": "1962418", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1962418", "title": "Chess set", "text": "Chess set\n\nA chess set has thirty-two chess pieces in two colours and a chessboard used to play chess. Chess is played by two players, each starting with one king, one queen, two rooks, two bishops, two knights and eight pawns. Chess equipment often accompanying a chess set are a chess box, chess clock and chess table. Chess sets are made in a wide variety of styles, often for ornamental rather than practical purposes. For tournament play, the Staunton chess set is preferred or required.\n\nHuman chess uses people as the pieces. Blindfold chess may be played without any set at all. \n\nThe variety of designs available is broad, from small cosmetic changes to highly abstract representations, to themed designs such as those that emulate the drawings from the works of Lewis Carroll, or modern treatments such as \"Star Trek\" or \"The Simpsons\". Themed designs are generally intended for display purposes rather than actual play . Some works of art are designs of chess sets, such as the modernist chess set by chess enthusiast and dadaist Man Ray, that is on display in the Museum of Modern Art in New York City.\n\nChess pieces used for play are usually figurines that are taller than they are wide. For example, a set of pieces designed for a chessboard with squares typically have a king around tall. Chess sets are available in a variety of designs, with the most well-known Staunton design, named after Howard Staunton, a 19th-century English chess player, and designed by Nathaniel Cooke. The first Staunton style sets were made in 1849 by Jaques of London (also known as \"John Jaques of London\" and \"Jaques and Son of London\") .\n\nWooden White chess pieces are normally made of a light wood, boxwood, or sometimes maple. Black wooden pieces are made of a dark wood such as rosewood, ebony, red sandalwood, African Padauk wood (African padauk which is similar to red sandalwood and is marketed as Bud Rosewood or Blood Red Rosewood) or walnut. Sometimes they are made of boxwood and stained or painted black, brown, or red. Plastic white pieces are made of white or off-white plastic, and plastic black pieces are made of black or red plastic. Sometimes other materials are used, such as bone, ivory, or a composite material .\n\nFor actual play, pieces of the Staunton chess set design are standard. The height of the king should be between . United States Chess Federation rules call for a king height between . A height of about is preferred by most players. The diameter of the king should be 40–50% of its height. The size of the other pieces should be in proportion to the king. The pieces should be well balanced such that their center of gravity is closer to the board. This is done by adding weights such as iron studs or lead blocks at the bottom and felted. It makes the pieces bottom-heavy and keeps them from toppling easily (a well-weighted piece should come upright even if tilted 60 degrees off vertical axis). This helps in blitz games as the speed of movement doesn't offer enough time or precision in dropping the pieces onto the intended squares. The length of each side of the squares on the chessboard should be about 1.25–1.3 times the diameter of the base of the king, or . Squares of about are normally well suited for pieces with the kings in the preferred size range. These criteria are from the United States Chess Federation's \"Official Rules of Chess\", which is based on the Fédération Internationale des Échecs rules .\n\nThe grandmaster Larry Evans offered this advice on buying a set :Make sure the one you buy is easy on the eye, felt-based, and heavy (weighted). The men should be constructed so they don't come apart. ... The regulation board used by the U. S. Chess Federation is green and buff—never red and black. However, there are several good inlaid wood boards on the market. ... Avoid cheap equipment. Chess offers a lifetime of enjoyment for just a few dollars well spent at the outset.\n\nSome small magnetic sets, designed to be compact and/or for travel, have pieces more like those used in shogi and xiangqi – each piece being a similar flat token, with a symbol printed on it to identify the piece type.\n\nOn computers, chess pieces are often 2D symbols on a 2D board, although some programs have 3D graphics engines with more traditional designs of chess pieces.\n\nUnicode contains symbols for chess pieces in both white and black.\n\n"}

{"id": "1962426", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1962426", "title": "Gustav Otto", "text": "Gustav Otto\n\nGustav Otto (12 January 1883 – 28 February 1926) was a German aircraft and aircraft engine designer and manufacturer.\n\nGustav was born in Cologne to Nicolaus August Otto, the founder of \"N. A. Otto & Cie.\" and inventor of the four-stroke internal combustion engine. It is therefore regarded that his interest in engines, specifically aircraft and the manufacture thereof, was something he inherited from his father at an early age.\n\nGustav Otto was regarded as successful and career-minded, and moved in elevated social circles. He attended higher secondary school in Cologne, and had internships at machine tool manufacturers. Later, he attended the Technical Colleges in Hanover, Karlsruhe and Munich for further engineering study. He is believed to have remained in Munich after completing his studies to co-found the \"Bayerische Auto-Garage\" company. Gustav had a difficult time getting out from under his father's long shadow. He was prone to bouts of depression, which affected his work.\n\nOtto successfully raced cars and motorcycles in various competitive events. He was also very active in the earliest days of aviation. On 10 April 1910 he obtained his pilot's licence on an \"Aviatik\" biplane (also he took over an agency for this aircraft). He founded the \"Aeroplanbau Otto-Alberti\" workshop (renamed \"Gustav Otto Flugmaschinenfabrik\" in 1911) at the Puchheim airfield. In 1910, Gustav designed and built a biplane which created a sensation throughout Germany. Otto, along with a few others, flew machines made of wood, wire, canvas and powered by Daimler aeroengines. Through their passion for flying machines, they helped transform aviation from a do-it-yourself hobby to an industry vital to the military, especially after the breakout of World War I. \n\nOtto founded several companies for the purpose of building aircraft. For his first company, the following entry was recorded in the Munich Company Register under the number 14/364 on 15 March 1911: \"Gustav Otto in Munich, Flugmaschinenfabrik (aircraft factory), Office Karlstrasse 72\". Shortly afterwards, Otto moved the workshop from its original location at 37, Gabelsberger Strasse to its new premises at 135, Schleissheimer Strasse, and in 1913 started to construct a new factory at 76, Neulerchenfeldstrasse (later Lerchenauer Straße) at the Oberwiesenfeld (the business was renamed \"Otto-Werke\" in 1915).\n\nOtto sold over 30 aircraft through his company, which also included a flight school. Ernst Udet, the second-highest scoring German flying ace of World War I (after Manfred von Richthofen), earned his pilot's license after private training with Otto.\n\nIn 1913, after selling 47 aircraft to the Bavarian Army, Otto opened a factory \"Otto-Flugzeugwerke\" on Lerchenauer Strasse just east of the Oberwiesenfeld troop manoeuvre area in the Milbertshofen district of Munich (this area later became Munich's first airport). He wanted to be closer to the German government's procurement process for military sale. However, he was not skilled at the politics and payoffs necessary when dealing with the Bavarian war ministry and Prussian Army. Unable to navigate these politics while leaving his pride and integrity intact deeply troubled him.\n\nShortly after 1914, Otto established another company named \"AGO Flugzeugwerke\" at Berlin's Johannisthal Air Field.\nThe name \"AGO\" stood for either \"Actien-Gesellschaft Otto\" or \"Aerowerke Gustav Otto\" – there seems to be some ambiguity – but during the early years of World War I the company mostly licence-built Otto Flugmaschinenfabrik designs (as did \"Pfalz Flugzeugwerke\"). Otto's designs were initially successful, but constantly plagued with problems related to cost-effective production, and revenue. At the start of the war, Otto-Flugzeugwerke was supplying the German Air Force, but the production problems ended up being so great that government agencies urged the company to solve the issues. The stress of wartime seemed to prove too great a burden for Otto who suffered health issues which led to financial problems with the company: In 1915 he was admitted to a Munich mental hospital for treatment of depression. During his treatment, the company languished to the brink of bankruptcy. Eventually, Otto was forced to resign and was offered a buyout that would compensate him for the business and also cover his medical bills. The assets were finally taken over by a consortium which incorporated them into \"Bayerische Flugzeugwerke\" on 19 February 1916. Otto therefore no longer had a stake in this company and instead turned his interest to a just previously founded (1 February 1916) independent \"Otto-Werke Flugzeug- und Maschinenfabrik GmbH\".\n\nAfter the First World War, Otto started a new attempt at car manufacturing with the \"Starnberger Automobilwerke\". The luxury \"Otto-Mercedes\" car built there is alleged to have been well received abroad.\n\nIn 1924 Otto was divorced from his wife Ada. He suffered badly from the emotional ordeal. Ada remarried, but in August 1925 died under mysterious circumstances that gave rise to much speculation. Although no longer married to her, Otto took her death most harshly and apparently fell into a deep depression.\n\nIn 1926, amid failed attempts at business (caused by various reasons), the death of his wife, and health issues, Otto committed suicide at the age of 43 in Munich.\n\nHistory of BMW\n\n"}

The divalent organic ligand coordinated to the metal center is called a carbene. Carbene complexes for almost all transition metals have been reported. Many methods for synthesizing them and reactions utilizing them have been reported. The term carbene ligand is a formalism since many are not derived from carbenes and almost none exhibit the reactivity characteristic of carbenes. Described often as M=CR, they represent a class of organic ligands intermediate between alkyls (−CR) and carbynes (≡CR). They feature in some catalytic reactions, especially alkene metathesis, and are of value in the preparation of some fine chemicals.\n\nMetal carbene complexes are often classified into two types. The Fischer carbenes named after Ernst Otto Fischer feature strong π-acceptors at the metal and being electrophilic at the carbene carbon atom. Schrock carbenes, named after Richard R. Schrock, are characterized by more nucleophilic carbene carbon centers, these species typically feature higher valent metals. \"N\"-Heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) were popularlized following Arduengo's isolation of a stable free carbene in 1991. Reflecting the growth of the area, carbene complexes are now known with a broad range of different reactivities and diverse substituents. Often it is not possible to classify a carbene complex with regards to its electrophilicity or nucleophilicity.\n\nFischer carbenes are found with:\n\nThe chemical bonding (\"Scheme 1\") is based on σ-type electron donation of the filled lone pair orbital of the carbene atom to an empty metal d-orbital, and π back bonding of a filled metal d-orbital to the empty p-orbital on carbon. An example is the complex (CO)Cr=C(NR)Ph.\n\nFischer carbenes can be likened to ketones, with the carbene carbon being electrophilic, much like the carbonyl carbon of a ketone. Like ketones, Fischer carbene species can undergo aldol-like reactions. The hydrogen atoms attached to the carbon α to the carbene carbon are acidic, and can be deprotonated by a base such as \"n\"-butyllithium, to give a nucleophile which can undergo further reaction.\n\nThis carbene is the starting material for other reactions such as the Wulff-Dötz reaction.\n\nSchrock carbenes do not have π-accepting ligands. These complexes are nucleophilic at the carbene carbon atom. Schrock carbenes are typically found with:\n\nBonding in such complexes can be viewed as the coupling of a triplet state metal and triplet carbene. These bonds are polarized towards carbon and therefore the carbene atom is a nucleophile. An example of a Schrock carbene is the compound Ta(=C(H)Bu)(CHBu), with a tantalum(V) center doubly bonded to a neopentylidene ligand as well as three neopentyl ligands. An example of interest in organic synthesis is Tebbe's reagent.\n\n\"N\"-Heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) are particularly common carbene ligands. They are popular because they are more readily prepared than Schrock and Fischer carbenes. In fact many NHCs are isolated as the free ligand, since they are persistent carbenes. Being strongly stabilized by π-donating substituents, NHCs are powerful σ-donors but π-bonding with the metal is weak. For this reason, the bond between the carbon and the metal center is often represented by a single dative bond, whereas Fischer and Schrock carbenes are usually depicted with double bonds to metal. Continuing with this analogy, NHCs are often compared with trialkylphosphine ligands. Like phosphines, NHCs serve as spectator ligands that influence catalysis through a combination of electronic and steric effects, but they do not directly bind substrates. Carbenes without a metal ligand have been produced in the lab.\n\nCarbene radicals are long-lived reaction intermediates found with:\n\nThe main applications of metal carbenes involves none of the above classes of compounds, but rather heterogeneous catalysts used for alkene metathesis in the Shell higher olefin process. A variety of related reactions are used to interconvert light alkenes, e.g. butenes, propylene, and ethylene. Carbene-complexes are invoked as intermediates in the Fischer–Tropsch route to hydrocarbons. A variety of soluble carbene reagents, especially the Grubbs' and molybdenum-imido catalysts have been applied to laboratory-scale synthesis of natural products and materials science. In the nucleophilic abstraction reaction, a methyl group can be abstracted from a Fischer carbene for further reaction.\n\nDiazo compounds like methyl phenyldiazoacetate can be used for cyclopropanation or to insert into C-H bonds of organic substrates. These reactions are catalyzed by dirhodium tetraacetate or related chiral derivatives. Such catalysis is assumed to proceed via the intermediacy of carbene complexes.\n\nThe characterization of (CO)W(COCH(Ph)) in the 1960s is often cited as the starting point of the area,\nalthough carbenoid ligands had been previously implicated. Ernst Otto Fischer, for this and other achievements in organometalic chemistry, was awarded the 1973 Nobel Prize in Chemistry.\n\n"}

It is located in Advisory Neighborhood Commission 4B, in the District's Fourth Ward, within the northwest quadrant. It borders the city of Takoma Park, Maryland.\n\nTakoma is a diverse neighborhood, populated mostly by middle-class families. Its small downtown has recently been redeveloped, bringing in new residents and attractive new businesses. Many of the houses in Takoma are historic, and some are over 100 years old.\n\nTakoma and the rest of Ward 4 are represented in the Council of the District of Columbia by Brandon Todd.\n\nAlong Eastern Avenue, Takoma borders Takoma Park, Maryland, a city with which Takoma shares its origins. Takoma shares a common identity with the neighboring city in Maryland, and the downtown area surrounding the Takoma Metro station crosses the District of Columbia line. \nTakoma is bounded by Georgia Avenue to the west, somewhere between Tuckerman and Van Buren Streets to the south, and Eastern Avenue to the northeast. The current site of the Walter Reed Army Medical Center on Georgia Avenue separates it from Rock Creek Park. However, the neighborhood historically and culturally spans across the Maryland line into the greater neighborhood of Takoma Park.\n\nTakoma, which was originally named Takoma Park, was developed in 1883 by developer Benjamin Franklin Gilbert as a commuter suburb on the Metropolitan Branch of the Baltimore and Ohio railroad line. Gilbert welcomed the Seventh-day Adventist Church to set up their world headquarters and publishing house in Takoma Park, D.C. with a hospital and college in neighboring Takoma Park, Maryland, and promoted the community's reputation for vegetarianism and \"clean living\" away from the \"malarial swamps\" of the city. Takoma, D.C. was originally regarded as the commercial hub for the entire surrounding area, prior to the development of Silver Spring, Maryland, as it featured large shops and industrial buildings in the area now occupied by the Metro station. Its commercial hub is considered to be part of Takoma Park's Historic District.\n\nTakoma was originally the name of Mount Rainier, from Lushootseed (earlier ), \"snow-covered mountain\". Gilbert wished to rename the train stop called Brightwood, and the name Takoma was chosen in 1883 by D.C. resident Ida Summy, who believed it to mean \"high up\" or \"near heaven\".\n\nThe Seventh-day Adventist Church maintained its world headquarters and a publishing house on the Eastern Avenue side of the D.C. line until the early 1980s; after moving to Silver Spring, the former site of the publishing house became art lofts and rehearsal space for the Washington Opera.\n\nThe Takoma Theater, built in 1924, is located in the neighborhood and is supported by the Takoma Theatre Conservancy, a nonprofit preservation group that raised money to buy and refurbish the theater.\n\nThe Takoma Masonic Center ground-breaking ceremony took place on November 12, 1924 at the corner of Carroll Street NW and Maple Street NW. On November 29, 1924, the masonic cornerstone ceremony was conducted by the Grand Master of Masons of the District of Columbia, Charles F.

However, much of the land adjacent to the station was demolished or neglected in the wake of the freeway controversy, creating division between downtown Takoma Park, Maryland, and the center of the Takoma community, which roughly parallels the D.C. line. Both of the remaining areas, on either side of the D.C.-Maryland line, are now protected as U.S. Historic Districts.\n\nDistrict of Columbia Public Schools operates public schools. Takoma Education Campus and Coolidge High School are located in Takoma, D.C.\n\nDistrict of Columbia Public Library operates the Takoma Park Neighborhood Library. It was the first neighborhood library in Washington, D.C., and a Carnegie library. Washington Adventist University (formerly Columbia Union College--1960-2010) is the only graduate university in Takoma Park, and the only graduate institution in Montgomery County, MD.\n\nEF International Languages Center Washington, D.C., a private English school for foreign students, is located in Takoma.\n\n\n"}

It operated as a pig iron-producing blast furnace from 1882 to 1971. After closing, it became one of the first industrial sites (and the only blast furnace) in the U.S. to be preserved and restored for public use. In 1981, the furnaces were designated a National Historic Landmark by the United States Department of the Interior.\n\nThe site currently serves as an interpretive museum of industry and hosts a nationally recognized metal arts program. It also serves as a concert and festival venue. A new visitor center was built 2015 and opened in 2016. The furnace site, along a wide strip of land reserved in Birmingham's original city plan for railroads and industry, hosts thousands of students through their education programs per year. The museum is free to visit during their operating hours of Tuesday-Saturday 10:00 A.M to 4:00 P.M. and Sunday 12:00 to 4:00 P.M.\n\nColonel James Withers Sloss was one of the founders of Birmingham, helping to promote railroad development in Jones Valley, Alabama and participating in the Pratt Coke and Coal Company, one of the new city's first manufacturers. In 1881 he formed his own company, the Sloss Furnace Company, and began construction of Birmingham's first blast furnace on 50 acres (202,000 m²) of land donated by the Elyton Land Company for industrial development. The engineer in charge of construction was Harry Hargreaves, a former student of English inventor Thomas Whitwell. The two Whitwell-type furnaces were 60 feet (18 m) tall and 18 feet (5.4 m) in diameter. The first blast was initiated in April 1882. The facility produced 24,000 tons of high quality iron during its first year of operation. Sloss iron won a bronze medal at the Southern Exposition held in 1883 at Louisville, Kentucky.\n\nIn 1886 Sloss retired and sold the company to a group of investors who reorganized it in 1899 as the Sloss-Sheffield Steel and Iron Company. The group regularly utilized forced mainly African-American convict-laborers that were purchased in collusion with local sheriffs in a system called peonage. Sheriffs would arrest mainly African-American men under often bogus charges of “vagrancy” and the Sloss company would purchase these men and work them as slaves. This allowed slavery to continue after the Civil War and amassed great wealth for Sloss.\n\nNew blowers were installed in 1902, new boilers in 1906 and 1914 and the furnaces completely rebuilt with modern equipment between 1927 and 1929. In 1909 James Pickering Dovel had become the superintendent of construction. For the next 21 years, Sloss was Dovel's workshop for invention. He developed gas cleaning equipment, modified the design of the furnaces, and improved the linings of the furnaces. In all, some 17 patents are credited to Dovel. Sloss's No. 2 Furnace, rebuilt in 1927, included many of these inventions, earning Dovel and Sloss a national reputation for innovation. Through this aggressive campaign of modernization and expansion, including furnace and mining and quarrying operations all around Jefferson County, Sloss-Sheffield became the second largest seller of pig-iron in the district and among the largest in the world. During this period the company built 48 small cottages for black workers near the downtown furnace — a community that became known as \"Sloss Quarters\" or just \"the quarters\".\n\nIn 1952, the Sloss Furnaces were acquired by the U.S. Pipe and Foundry Company, and sold nearly two decades later in 1969 to the Jim Walter Corp. The Birmingham area had been suffering from a serious air pollution problem during the 1950s and 1960s due to the iron and steel industry there, and Federal legislation such as the U.S. Clean Air Act encouraged the closure of older and out-of-date smelting works. Also, by the early 1960s, higher-yielding brown ores from other regions were feeding the blast furnaces.\n\nThe Jim Walter company closed the furnaces two years later, and then donated the property to the Alabama State Fair Authority for possible development as a museum of industry. The authority determined that redevelopment was not feasible and made plans to demolish the furnaces. Local preservationists formed the Sloss Furnace Association to lobby for preservation of this site, which is of central importance to the history of Birmingham. In 1976, the site was documented for the Historic American Engineering Record and its historic significance was detailed in a study commissioned by the city. Birmingham voters approved a $3.3 million bond issue in 1977 to preserve the site. This money went towards stabilization of the main structures and the construction of a visitors' center and the establishment of a metal arts program. The Sloss Furnaces site became a National Historic Landmark in 1981, and opened to the public as the nation's first and only 20th century blast furnace site preserved as a museum on Labor Day weekend, 1983.\n\nIn February 2009 Sloss became the new home of the SLSF 4018 steam locomotive, which was relocated from Birmingham's Fair Park.\n\nSloss is currently used to hold metal arts classes and events, food festivals, fun runs, education programs, weddings, and concerts. Being a reportedly haunted location, it is also rents the site to an outside company to create an annual Halloween haunted attraction. Sloss Furnaces holds Historic Night Tours to give visitors a chance to hear the darker history of Sloss. The story of Sloss' preservation and modern use was documented in Alabama Public Television's \"Sloss: Industry to Art\".\n\nFor many years Sloss Furnaces has been used as a haunted house attraction during the Halloween season. The event is termed \"Fright Furnace at the Historic Sloss Furnaces\".\n\nIn June 2012 a formal groundbreaking ceremony was held at the site, signaling the beginning of construction on a new 16,000 square foot Visitors' and Education Center to be located on the south-west corner of the furnace site. The new complex, funded jointly by the City of Birmingham and the Sloss Foundation, hosts educational exhibits relevant to the site's history, administrative offices, as well as additional multi-purpose space for public events. The facility improvements are in line with an expected ongoing project within the city to construct new \"greenway\" spaces in the downtown area, possibly linking several popular city venues in the future.\n\nThe paranormal claims of Sloss Furnances were featured in paranormal reality TV shows like, \"Ghost Adventures\" and \"Ghost Hunters\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1962467", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1962467", "title": "Visual J++", "text": "Visual J++\n\nVisual J++ \"(pronounced \"Jay Plus Plus\")\" is Microsoft's discontinued implementation of Java. Syntax, keywords, and grammatical conventions were the same as Java's. It was introduced in 1996 and discontinued in January 2004, replacing it to a certain extent with J# and C#.\n\nWhile J++ conformed to the Java language specification, Microsoft did not implement certain features of the official Sun Java implementation in its Visual J++ product line. Remote Method Invocation (Java RMI) and Java Native Interface (JNI) are such examples.\n\nIn addition, J++ implemented other extensions that were not part of Sun's Java implementation. The inclusion of callbacks and delegates for event handling further contributed to defining J++ as a completely different language merely based on an already existing design concept.\n\nFurthermore, J++ applications did not conform to the standardized method of accessing the underlying operating system functions as any other Java application under Sun's Java SDK. In Microsoft's implementation, an underlying framework called J/Direct provided a base mechanism that allowed J++ applications to completely circumvent Java's class libraries and API media in accessing the underlying operating system. Due to this short-cut around the original Java framework, J++ applications were more efficient in taking advantage of Win32 API functions than Java applications.\n\nJ++ applications using these features could not be run on Sun's Java SDK, but the Kaffe project developed extensions which made it possible to run J++ applications with these features on their open sourced JVM. However, these extensions (implemented by TransVirtual under Microsoft funding) were not widely used, and J++ applications still needed to be compiled on Visual J++ before being able to be run by Kaffe.\n\nVisual J++ supported ActiveX.\n\nThe Windows Foundation Classes (WFC) encapsulated the Microsoft Win32 platform API and DHTML object models into a unified class library. WFC was primarily designed for creating graphical user interfaces for Java applications on Windows.\n\nSun Microsystems had originally licensed Java to Microsoft but later initiated litigation against Microsoft for trademark violation. Sun's trademark license for usage of the Java brand insists that all implementations be \"compatible\".\n\nSome observers have remarked that this incompatibility appears to have been a deliberate aim of Microsoft's, in an attempt to at least slow the advance of Sun's Java technology.\n\nThe failure of the MSJVM to pass Sun's compliance tests was a large factor in the initial lawsuit. On January 24, 2001, this and all other outstanding Sun-Microsoft lawsuits were settled as part of a wide-ranging agreement between Sun and Microsoft. As provided in the settlement, Microsoft could not incorporate into J++ features that Sun introduced into Java in versions beyond the one J++ had (at that date) been mirrored from; it would be frozen at the feature set of Java version 1.1.4. This effectively killed J++, and ended further updates. Microsoft was also forced to agree to cease distribution of the MSJVM; it is no longer available for download. \n\nThe terms of the settlement did, however, permit Microsoft to provide security support, allowing further updates to the MSJVM to fix security holes and any other problems relating to security threats. Microsoft ceased such support for the MSJVM on December 31, 2007.\n\nThe technology of J++ was eventually recycled, surviving for a while as part of the Microsoft .NET platform and the J# programming language.\n\nVisual J++ was also the name of the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for J++ and provided many tools and utilities to help J++ programmers fully leverage the Win32 API.\n\nVisual J++ is no longer available for distribution, but it was part of the Microsoft Visual Studio product line. Visual Studio 6.0 was the last release to include J++.\n\nVisual J# \"(pronounced \"Jay Sharp\")\" is a Microsoft language whose syntax is close to Java, part of the .NET Framework. Visual J# is part of the Microsoft Visual Studio .NET product suite and is designed to help developers and programmers migrate from J++ (or Java) to the .NET Framework. \n\nMicrosoft later developed the C# (\"C Sharp\") language as the primary language for the .NET platform, which was in many ways influenced by Java; subsequently the .NET Framework shares many ideas in common with Java. Much like Java, C# is compiled to a type of bytecode (called CIL), and runs on top of a virtual machine called the Common Language Runtime in .NET. Visual Studio 2005 was the last release to include J#.\n\n"}

BotCon has been held annually since 1994. BotCon is a syllabic abbreviation for \"Robot Convention\" but also refers to \"Autobot\" and \"Decepticon\", the protagonist and antagonist robot factions in the many continuities in the Transformers franchise.\n\nFeatured BotCon guests are usually involved in the creation of Transformers media in some respect, whether as voice actors from the animated series, artists or writers from the comic books, or actual Hasbro employees. Fun Publications has held the convention for a number of years, with 2016 being its final year. It was replaced by HASCON, Hasbro's own convention, in 2017.\n\nThe first BotCon was held in Fort Wayne, Indiana, United States in 1994. Organized by brothers Jon and Karl Hartman, the convention had 180 attendees. BotCon was organized in 1995 by Raksha, a prominent figure in the fan community, and in 1996 by Men In Black Productions, headed up by Dennis Barger. In 1997, the Hartmans brought Glen Hallit, a fellow fan, into the fold, forming 3H Enterprises (based on the first letter of the organizers' last names).\n\nIn 1999, BotCon Europe took place in Clapham Common, Wandsworth, South West London, England.\n\nAt BotCon 2002, Hallit announced that 3H had secured the official Transformers convention license, as well as licenses to produce comic books and start a fan club. Shortly thereafter, the Hartmans were removed from their organizational duties, leaving Glen Hallit as the sole organizer of the new company, 3H Productions, Inc.\n\nIn the winter of 2002, 3H sought to expand to Europe, holding an official European convention in Cheshunt, UK. However, the event, which was held in conjunction with the main BotCon 2002 in the US, had much less advertising and the registration did not open until a couple of weeks before the convention. Since the attendance at the European BotCon had been much smaller than the main show that summer, 3H decided it was too much work to hold two separate conventions, and officially announced that they would never hold BotCon outside the US again.\n\nIn 2003, the convention changed its name to \"The Official Transformers Collectors' Convention\" (OTFCC), due to the Hartmans' ownership of the BotCon service mark. The fandom held dueling conventions in 2004, as 3H held OTFCC in Chicago, Illinois, while the Hartman brothers revived the BotCon name for their final convention in Pasadena, California. That fall, 3H Productions lost all of its Transformers-related licenses, leaving the convention in a state of limbo.\n\nIn early January 2005, Hasbro announced on its official website that Fun Publications, owned by Brian Savage, had been awarded the convention and fan club licenses. The Hartman brothers and prominent fans Pete Sinclair, Benson Yee, and Rik Alvarez were invited to form an advisory council to help ease the transition of organizing the convention for the new owners. Once the Hartmans' service mark was transferred to Fun Publications, BotCon regained its status of being the official Transformers collectors' convention.\n\nOn February 2, 2020, people started to observe new activity on the official Botcon website. On February 3, 2020 Karl Hartman announced Botcon 2021. In a post on the Official Botcon Facebook page, Hartman said, \"The story of BotCon is not over. It just has a new chapter. On behalf of myself, Bret Lovell, Andrew Hall and the rest of the BC Productions crew, I am honored and humbled to announce: Botcon 2021\".\n\n\nOver the years, BotCon has featured many individuals who have worked to bring the Transformers multiverse to life, including voice actors, animation staff, and Hasbro design team members. BotCon guests include:\n\nAt the 2010 BotCon, Hasbro introduced a \"Hall of Fame\" awards ceremony to commemorate the people and characters of the franchise. Hasbro selected the first four robot inductees, while fans worldwide voted for the fifth. In the end, Dinobot from \"\" won the votes. Among the human inductees were Bob Budiansky for helping create the franchise through comics and personality profiles, Peter Cullen for giving Optimus Prime his voice, and Hideaki Yoke and Kohjin Ohno of Takara Tomy for creating many of the franchise's toys.\n\nFor 2011, Steven Spielberg and Michael Bay were inducted for the success of the \"Transformers\" live-action film franchise.\n\nIn 2012, the first posthumous award was given to voice actor Chris Latta, who died in 1994. Wheeljack, one of the characters he voiced in the original series, was selected as the Fan's Choice recipient.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of BotCon's most popular features is the exclusive toys made available to the attendees. The toys are different every year and are not retailed anywhere in the world. The number of exclusive toys increased significantly in 2005 after Fun Publications became the official license holder of the convention. The identities and designs of the toys were originally kept a close secret until the opening of the convention, but in the later years of the convention the organizers often chose to reveal one or more of the exclusives ahead of time due to repeated problems with stolen prototypes being sold on eBay. In 2008, organizer Brian Savage ordered all eBay users selling these prototypes to return them to their rightful owners.\n\nAlthough the toys are always unique, financial costs prohibit the creation of entirely new molds. As such, the toys are redecos, repaints, or retools of previously used toys given new identities, occasionally switching allegiances and even gender. Beginning in 2003, some of the exclusives were given new, retooled heads to further differentiate the new characters from previous uses of a mold. As the number of exclusives offered at each convention grew, so did the number of retooled parts. Since then, it has been standard practice to produce three or four newly tooled heads (or other parts such as wings in the case of 2007) for each BotCon. After the convention, exclusive toys usually become valuable collector's items in the community, particularly among fans who missed the convention.\n\nThe Transformers Collector's Club also releases exclusive figures, which are also remolds and repaints of regular \"Transformers\" figures.\n\n"}

The movie is a parody of \"Alien\". It stars Leslie Nielsen in a role similar to those in the farcical comedies \"Airplane\" and \"Naked Gun\". It co-stars Cindy Williams, Gerrit Graham, and Patrick Macnee. It was released on VHS in 1983 under the title \"Spaceship\" to emphasize Nielsen's connection to \"Airplane!\", and released on DVD in 1999 under the title Naked Space to play up the connection to Nielsen's \"Naked Gun\" movies.\n\nThe movie is a low-budget comedy with simple sets and dialogue wrapped around several musical numbers. In one of the scenes, the red slimy one-eyed alien monster performs a lounge-act style musical number called \"I Want to Eat Your Face.\" Williams performs two musical numbers, one solo and one with Kimmel, who had previously appeared with and directed Williams in 1976 in \"The First Nudie Musical\". The film was completely re-edited by the producers - that is what was released as Spaceship/Naked Space on home video. The original version, The Creature Wasn't Nice, was only seen at two public previews. In 2019, it was announced that both versions of the film would come to home video under its original title.\n\n\n\"TV Guide\" reviewing the Spaceship version gave the film one out of four stars, calling it a \"misguided attempt at horror comedy\". Cavett Binion, writing for Allmovie, also reviewing the re-cut version called the film \"painfully dull [...] [Patrick Macnee's] hammy performance provides one of the film's few real laughs [...] the lovely soft-shoe number \"I Want to Eat Your Face\" [provided] the film's other real laugh.\" Variety, reviewing the original version of the film under its original title at a public sneak preview in Westwood, called it \"a likeably silly send-up of outer-space horror pix like 'Alien'\".\n\n"}
{"id": "1962520", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1962520", "title": "Keeping the Faith", "text": "Keeping the Faith\n\nKeeping the Faith is a 2000 American romantic comedy film written by Stuart Blumberg, and starring Ben Stiller, Edward Norton (in his directorial debut), Jenna Elfman, Eli Wallach, and Anne Bancroft. This film was released by Touchstone Pictures and Spyglass Entertainment, in association with Triple Threat Talent, on April 14, 2000.\n\nThe film is dedicated to Norton's late mother, Robin. It had a budget of $29 million.\n\nFather Brian Finn (Edward Norton), dedicated to his calling as Catholic priest since childhood, shares the duties of his New York parish with the older Fr. Havel (Miloš Forman). Rabbi Jacob \"Jake\" Schram (Ben Stiller), best friends with Brian since they were children and the youngest rabbi at his synagogue, focuses on his work to the detriment of his private life, much to the chagrin of his mother, Ruth (Anne Bancroft). The two men show a close bond even in their professions, planning to open a jointly-sponsored community center. The pair reminisce about their childhood friend Anna Reilly (Jenna Elfman), meeting them in middle school after beating up a bully. The three were close friends until Anna's family moved to California and they ultimately lost touch.\n\nSixteen years later, Anna moves to New York for work and calls Jake and Brian out of the blue, rekindling their friendship. Anna and Jake begin sleeping together, but he is reluctant to become seriously involved as she is not Jewish, which could compromise his relationship with his congregation and his mother Ruth, who disowned her eldest son for marrying outside the faith. Between this conflict and their desire to spare Brian's feelings, the relationship is kept mostly secret. As the relationship continues, Jake remains unwilling to view the relationship as serious, despite Anna’s hints at her ‘taking a class’. She is upset when they run into members of Jake's congregation while on a date, and Jake introduces her only as \"my old friend Anna\".\n\nBrian is in private turmoil after also developing feelings for Anna, in conflict with his vows. He misinterprets Anna's words and actions – some of which are subtle signals to Jake – and even has an erotic dream about her. He seriously considers leaving the priesthood to pursue a romantic relationship with her. While the three have dinner with Ruth, she reveals to Anna that she knows about her and Jake's secret relationship. Jake and Brian walk in on the tearful moment, and Jake and Anna later argue over the religious issues complicating their romance and part ways. Anna calls Brian for comfort and he rushes to her, taking her tearful ramblings to be a confession of feelings for him. When he kisses her and confesses his love, she interrupts him, admitting she is in love with Jake and they have been seeing each other secretly for months. Embarrassed and rejected, Brian spends the night drinking on the streets. Still drunk the next day, Brian stumbles into Jake's temple and interrupts a post-bar mitzvah gathering, resulting in a confrontation with Jake that ends with the priest punching the rabbi.\n\nAs the Community Center's grand opening approaches, along with the end of Anna's East Coast assignment, Jake reconciles with Brian, as does Anna soon after. A discussion with Brian prompts Jake to go to Anna's office building, with Brian shouting encouragement as he runs down the street. Interrupting Anna's going-away party, Jake gets her attention from a window across the street, and calls to explain himself and offer to set things right. That evening, they surprise Brian in the middle of his karaoke number at the interfaith center. Anna greets Rabbi Lewis (Eli Wallach) and mentions their meetings together, revealing that she had been taking classes to convert to Judaism. She tells him she hopes to pick it up again as she is now staying in New York, with Jake clearly thrilled. The film ends with the three friends happily posing for a photo together.\n\n\"Keeping the Faith\" received generally positive reviews. On Rotten Tomatoes, it holds a 69% rating, sampled from 117 film critics, with an average score of 6.23/10. The consensus states: \"A dramedy featuring an unusual love triangle, \"Keeping the Faith\" is a perceptive look at how religion affects us in everyday life.\" Metacritic gives the film a score of 60 out of 100, based on reviews from 31 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews.\"\n\nThe film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists:\n\nThe film opened at #3 at the US box office, making $8,078,671 in its opening weekend, behind \"28 Days\" and \"Rules of Engagement\". The film eventually grossed $37,047,880 in North America and $22,897,303 in other territories, totaling $59,945,183 worldwide.\n\n"}

The primary purpose of anointing with the holy anointing oil was to sanctify, to set the anointed person or object apart as \"qodesh\", or \"holy\" ().\n\nOriginally, the oil was used exclusively for the priests and the Tabernacle articles, but its use was later extended to include kings (). It was forbidden to be used on an outsider () or to be used on the body of any common person () and the Israelites were forbidden to duplicate any like it for themselves ().\n\nChristianity has continued the practice of using holy anointing oil as a devotional practice, as well as in various liturgies.\n\nThe holy anointing oil described in Exodus was created from:\n\n\nThe Hebrew term \"Messiah\" (in Greek \"Christos\") means \"the anointed one\", and relates to anyone anointed (dedicated to God). The person thus anointed might be a king, a priest, or a prophet.\n\nCustoms varied in the cultures of the Middle East. However, anointing with special oil in Israel was either a strictly priestly or kingly right. When a prophet was anointed, it was because he was first a priest. When a non-king was anointed, such as Elijah's anointing of Hazael and Jehu, it was a sign that Hazael was to become king of Aram (Syria) and Jehu was to become king of Israel. Extra-biblical sources show that it was common to anoint kings in many ancient Near Eastern monarchies. Therefore, in Israel, anointing was not only a sacred act but also a socio-political one.\n\nIn the Hebrew Bible, the Israelite way of life and cultural environment put great importance on the sense of smell for survival and was highly esteemed. It contributed to the ability of man to orient himself and to find his way in a world where life and death were permanently struggling. Where stench arose, he diagnosed the presence of disease, decay, rotting processes and death (Exodus 7:18) and where pleasant aromas existed were places biologically clean and conducive to habitation and/or food production and harvesting. Spices and oils were chosen which assisted man in orienting himself and in creating a sense of safety as well as a sense of elevation above the physical world of decay. The sense of smell was also considered highly esteemed by deity. In Deuteronomy 4:28 and Psalms 115:5-6 the sense of smell is included in connection with the polemics against idols. In the Hebrew Bible God takes pleasure in inhaling the \"soothing odor\" (\"reah hannihoah\") of offerings (Genesis 8:21 etc.).\n\nTo the ancient Israelite there was no oil or fat with more symbolic meaning than olive oil. It was used as an emollient, a fuel for lighting lamps, for nutrition, and for many other purposes. It was scented olive oil that was chosen to be a holy anointing oil for the Israelites.\n\nSome believe in the continuity factor relative to the holy anointing oil.\nCustoms utilizing the continuity factor is found in many of the world’s religions. For example, early Jewish rabbis stressed the importance of the succession of classical semikhah and the Catholic Church emphasized the importance of apostolic succession, the continuity of laying on of hands for ordination, in an unbroken chain. The continuity factor relative to the holy anointing oil can be found in rabbinical judaism, in the Armenian Church, in the Assyrian Church of the East in the Coptic Church, in the Nazrani and Saint Thomas churches, and others.\n\nAs mentioned above, the continuity factor can be found in Rabbinic Judaism, including that of the holy anointing oil.\n\nOne Jewish tradition teaches that the ashes of the last red heifer sacrificed were always mixed with the ashes of each new red heifer The Temple Institute states, \"Some opinions maintain that the newer ashes were always mixed together with a combination of the previous ashes. One way of understanding this, is to the view this mixture of old and new ashes as being yet another precautionary measure... Additionally, mixing in the newer ashes we have produced now with those from olden times is a way of connecting through time with the original heifer that was slaughtered and prepared by Moses. As such, in a sense, it is a way of connecting with the level of Moses himself.\" Since the last succession of ashes of the red heifer were either hidden or lost after 70 AD Vendyl Jones searched for the original ashes by following the map on the Copper Scroll that purports to tell the location, so that the old ashes can be added to the new, which serves to continue the \"continuity factor.\"\n\nThere is a traditional Jewish \"mitzvah\" that when making \"challah\" one should separate and set aside part of the dough. Some Jewish people remove a small piece of the \"challah\" dough (the word \"challah\" means to remove) and give it away to someone else as a challah starter, although according to traditional Jewish law, this piece may not be eaten under any modern day conditions, and must thus be destroyed in a dignified manner. In one Jewish custom a portion of the \"challah\" is set aside (refrigerated) until the making of new \"challah\" when the old is added to the new. It is recorded in Exodus 30:31 \"And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, This shall be an holy anointing oil unto me throughout your generations.\" (Exodus 30:31). Commenting on this verse Rashi quotes a teaching of the Sages [Horiyos 11b] that the original Shemen HaMishcha that Moses made, to anoint the priesthood and the tabernacle furnishings, would remain intact in its entirety into the distant future (\"l'asid lavoh\"). When the Temple was to be rebuilt they would then need that very same holy anointing oil to anoint the priests prior to their service in the Third Temple as well as to anoint the furnishings of the mishkan. Vendyl Jones claimed that such a small quantity of oil (around a gallon) would not last that long. It is claimed that one juglet of oil lasted over 800 years. To explain this discrepancy it is claimed that one of two things occurred: Either the container of holy anointing oil miraculously multiplied when supply became low (as did the of oil mentioned in the story of Elijah and the widow woman or the oil that lasted for eight days without being consumed during the Jewish Chanukka) or, following ancient customs, new oil was added to the old thus continuing the original oil for all time.\n\nAnointing oil is used in Christianity. A passage in the New Testament says,\nThe holy anointing oil of the Armenian Church is called the holy muron ('muron' means myrrh). The church holds a special reverence for the continuity factor of the oil. According to tradition, a portion of the holy anointing oil of Exodus 30, which Moses and Aaron had blessed, still remained in Jesus' time. Jesus Christ blessed this oil and then gave some of it to Thaddeus, who took the holy oil to Armenia and healed King Abkar of a terrible skin disease by anointing him with the holy oil. Saint Thaddeus is said to have buried a bottle of the holy anointing oil in Daron under an evergreen tree. Saint Gregory the Illuminator discovered the hidden treasure and mixed it with muron that he had blessed. It is said that \"To this day, whenever a new batch of muron is prepared and blessed, a few drops of the old one go into it, so that the Armenian muron always contains a small amount of the original oil blessed by Moses, Jesus Christ, and Gregory the Illuminator.\"\n\nThe holy muron is composed of olive oil and forty-eight aromas and flowers. The remaining portion of the previous blessed holy oil is poured into the newly prepared oil during the blessing ceremony and passes the blessing from generation to generation. It is said that this very procedure has been followed for nearly 1700 years. The Catholicos of all Armenians in Etchmiadzin combines a new mixture of holy muron in the cauldron every seven years using a portion of the holy muron from the previous blend. This is distributed to all of the Armenian churches throughout the world. Before Christianity, muron was reserved solely for the enthroning of royalty and for very special events. In later years, it was used with extreme unction and to heal the sick, and to anoint ordained clergy.\n\nIt is said by the Assyrian Church that the holy anointing oil \"was given and handed down to us by our holy fathers Mar Addai and Mar Mari and Mar Tuma.\" The holy anointing oil of the Assyrian Church is variously referred to as the Oil of the Holy Horn, the Oil of the Qarna, or the Oil of Unction. This holy oil is an apostolic tradition, believed to have originated from the oil consecrated by the apostles themselves, and which by succession has been handed down in the Church to this day. The original oil which the disciples blessed began to run low and more oil was added to it. The Assyrian Church believes that this has continued to this very day with new oil being added as the oil level lowers. This succession of holy oil is believed to be a continuity of the blessings placed upon the oil from the beginning.\n\nBoth the Oil of Unction and the Holy Leaven are referred to as \"leaven\" although there is no actual leavening agent, so the nomenclature Holy Leaven seems to be a bit misleading. Yohanan bar Abgareh referred to it in 905 as did Shlemon d-Basra in the 13th century. Yohanan bar Zo’bee in the 14th century integrated the Holy Oil of unction with baptism and other rites. Isaaq Eshbadhnaya in the 15th century wrote the Scholion which is a commentary on specific theological topics. It tells us that John the Baptist gave John the Evangelist a baptismal vessel of water from Christ’s baptism, which was collected by John the Baptist from water dripping from Christ after his baptism in Jordan River. Jesus gave each disciple a \"loaf,\" at the Last Supper, but the Scholion informs us that to John he gave two with the instructions to eat only one and to save the other. At the crucifixion John collected the water from the Lord's side in the vessel and the blood he collected on the loaf from the Last Supper. After the descent of the Holy Spirit on Pentecost the disciples took the vessel and mixed it with oil and each took a horn of it. The loaf they ground up and added flour and salt to it. Each took a portion of the holy oil and the holy bread which were distributed in every land by the hand of those who missionized there.\n\nThe Assyrian Church has two types of holy oils; the one is ordinary olive oil, blessed or not blessed, the other is the oil of the Holy Horn which is believed to have been handed down from the apostles. The Holy Horn is constantly renewed by the addition of oil blessed by a bishop on Maundy Thursday. While almost anyone can by tradition be anointed with the regular oil, the oil of the Holy Horn is restricted for ordination and sanctification purposes.\n\nThe holy anointing oil of the Coptic Church is referred to as the holy myron ('myron' means myrrh). The laying on of hands for the dwelling of the Holy Spirit is believed to have been a specific rite of the apostles and their successors the bishops, and as the regions of mission increased, consequently numbers of Christian believers and converts increased. It was not possible for the apostles to wander through all the countries and cities to lay hands on all of those baptized, so they established anointment by the holy myron as an alternative, it is believed, for the laying on of the hands for the Holy Spirit’s indwelling.\n\nThe first who made the myron were the apostles who had kept the fragrant oils which were on the body of Jesus Christ during his burial, and they added the spices which were brought by those women who prepared them to anoint Christ, but had discovered he had been resurrected. They melted all these spices in pure olive oil, prayed on it in the upper room in Zion, and made it a holy anointing oil. They decided that their successors, the bishops, must renew the making of the myron whenever it is nearly used up, by incorporating the original oil with the new. Today the Coptic Church uses it for ordination, in the sanctification of baptismal water, and in the consecration of churches and church altars and vessels.\n\nIt is said that when St. Mark went to Alexandria, he took with him some of the holy myron oil made by the apostles and that he used it in the sacrament of Chrism, as did the patriarchs who succeeded him. This continued until the era of Athanasius the Apostolic, the 20th patriarch, who then decided to remake the myron in Alexandria. Hence, it is reported, he prepared all of the needed perfumes and spices, with pure olive oil, from which God ordered Moses to make the holy anointing oil as specified in the recipe in the thirtieth chapter of the book of Exodus. Then the sanctification of the holy myron was fulfilled in Alexandria, and Athanasius was entrusted with the holy oil, which contained spices which touched Jesus’s body while it was in the tomb, as well as the original oil which had been prepared by the apostles and brought to Egypt by St. Mark. He distributed the oil to the churches abroad: to the See of Rome, Antioch and Constantinople, together with a document of its authenticity, and all of the patriarchs are said to have rejoiced in receiving it.\n\nThe Coptic Church informs that the fathers of the Church and scholars like St. Justin Martyr, Tertullian, St. Hippolytus, Origen, St. Ambrose, and St. Cyril of Jerusalem, spoke about the holy myron and how they received its use in anointing by tradition. For example, St. Hippolytus in his Apostolic Tradition, speaks of the holy oil \"according to ancient custom\" Origen writes about the holy oil “according to the tradition of the church\" St. Cyril of Jerusalem goes into further detail in speaking about the grace of the Holy Spirit in the holy myron: \"this oil is not just any oil: after the epiclesis of the Spirit, it becomes charism of Christ and power of the Holy Spirit through the presence of the deity\" \n\nThe early fathers and scholars mention the use of the holy myron, as well as a documentation by Abu'l-Barakat Ibn Kabar, a 14th-century Coptic priest and scholar, in his book Misbah az-Zulmah fi idah al-khidmah (The Lamp of Darkness in Clarifying the Service). According to his account, the holy apostles took from the spices that were used to anoint the body of Jesus Christ when he was buried, added pure olive oil to it, and prayed over it in Upper Zion, the first church where the Holy Spirit fell in the upper room.\n\nThis holy oil was then distributed among all of the apostles so that wherever they preached, new converts would be anointed with it as a seal. They also commanded that whenever a new batch of Holy Myron was made, they add to it the old holy myron to keep the first holy myron continually with all that would ever be made afterwards.\n\nAccording to the available resources, the holy myron in the Church of Egypt has been made 34 times.\n\nAccording to tradition, St. Thomas laid the original foundation for Christianity in India. It is reported that Jewish communities already present in India enticed Thomas to make his missionary journey there. It is said that he brought holy anointing oil with him and that the St. Thomas Christians still have this oil to this day.\n\nPatriarch Ya`qub, of the Syrian Malabar Nasrani Church, is remembered for his celebration of the liturgy and his humble encouragement to accept the simple way of life. After he consecrated sacred myron in the Mor Gabriel monastery in 1964, holy myron flowed from the glass container the following day and many people were said to have been healed by it.\n\nWhile sources agree about the identity of four of the five ingredients of anointing oil, the identity of the fifth, \"kaneh bosem\", has been a matter of debate. The Bible indicates that it was an aromatic cane or grass, which was imported from a distant land by way of the spice routes, and that a related plant grows naturally in Israel. Several different plants have been named as possibly being the \"kaneh bosem\".\n\nMost lexicographers, botanists, and biblical commentators translate \"keneh bosem\" as \"cane balsam\". The Aramaic Targum Onkelos renders the Hebrew \"kaneh bosem\" in Aramaic as \"q'nei busma\". Ancient translations and sources identify this with the plant variously referred to as sweet cane, or sweet flag (nl. the Septuagint, the Rambam on Kerithoth 1:1, Saadia Gaon and Jonah ibn Janah). This plant is known to botanists as \"acorus calamus\". According to Aryeh Kaplan in \"The Living Torah\", \"It appears that a similar species grew in the Holy Land, in the Hula region in ancient times (Theophrastus, \"History of Plants\" 9:7).\"\n\nMaimonides (\"Yad, Kley HaMikdash\" 1:3), in contrast, indicates that it was the Indian plant, rosha grass (\"Cymbopogon martinii\"), which resembles red straw. Many standard reference works on Bible plants by Michael Zohary (University of Jerusalem, Cambridge, 1985), James A. Duke (2010), and Hans Arne Jensen (Danish 2004, English translation 2012) support this conclusion, arguing that the plant was a variety of Cymbopogon. James A. Duke, quoting Zohary, notes that it is \"hopeless to speculate\" about the exact species, but that \"Cymbopogon citratus\" (Indian lemon-grass) and \"Cymbopogon schoenanthus\" are also possibilities. Kaplan follows Maimonides in identifying it as the \"Cymbopogon martinii\" or palmarosa plant.\n\nOther possible identifications have also been made. Sula Benet in \"Early Diffusion and Folk Uses of Hemp\" (1967), identified it as \"cannabis\". Rabbi Aryeh Kaplan notes that \"On the basis of cognate pronunciation and Septuagint readings, some identify Keneh bosem with the English and Greek \"cannabis\", the hemp plant. There are, however, some authorities who identify the 'sweet cane' with cinnamon bark (Radak, Sherashim). Some say that kinman is the wood, and keneh bosem is the bark (Abarbanel).\" Benet in contrast argued that equating Keneh Bosem with sweet cane could be traced to a mistranslation in the Septuagint, which mistook Keneh Bosem, later referred to as \"cannabos\" in the Talmud, as \"kalabos\", a common Egyptian marsh cane plant.\n\nSeveral churches, including THC Ministries, Green Faith Ministries, and Temple 420 use cannabis as an ingredient in holy anointing oil, medicines, and incense, believing that kaneh bosm is cannabis. Is also associated with the Plant of Renown and Tree of life in Revelation 22:2.\n\n"}

Gottesman attended Claremont McKenna College for one year and dropped out.\n\nGottesman worked as a junior aide to then-White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card at the beginning of Bush's first presidential term and became Bush's full-time personal aide in February 2002. Gottesman was responsible for managing Bush's day-to-day activities and traveled with him to functions and on overseas trips. In a 2006 \"Time\" article on Gottesman, he was said to understand Bush's moods and tendencies better than most of his other advisors, leading many to have discussions with him on issues before presenting them to the President. When compared to fictional presidential aide Charlie Young in television series \"The West Wing\", Gottesman stated, \"Our jobs are probably pretty similar.\"\n\nIn his role as a personal aide, Gottesman performed a wide range of duties, from dog-sitting the president's Scottish terriers, Barney and Miss Beazley, to carrying the president's speeches and giving him the two-minute warning before a speech begins.

His admission to the school despite not having received an undergraduate degree was criticized by many media commentators.\n\nAfter the inauguration of President Barack Obama, Gottesman joined Berkshire Partners, a Boston-based private equity firm, as a Senior Associate.\nSince then, Gottesman has been elevated to Managing Director at Berkshire.\n\n"}
{"id": "1962535", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1962535", "title": "Richardoestesia", "text": "Richardoestesia\n\nRichardoestesia is a medium-sized (about ) genus of theropod dinosaur from the late Cretaceous Period of what is now North America. It currently contains two species, \"R. gilmorei\" and \"R. isosceles\".\n\nThe holotype specimen of \"Richardoestesia gilmorei\" (NMC 343) consists of the pair of lower jaws found in the upper Judith River Group, dating from the Campanian age, about 75 million years ago. The jaws are slender and rather long, 193 millimeter, but the teeth are small and very finely serrated with five to six denticles per millimeter. The serration density is a distinctive trait of the species.\n\nIn 2001, Julia Sankey named a second species: \"Richardoestesia isosceles\", based on a tooth, LSUMGS 489:6238, from the Texan Aguja Formation, which is of a longer and less recurved type. The teeth of \"R. isosceles\" have also been identified as crocodyliform in shape, possibly belonging to a sebecosuchian.\n\nThe jaws were found in 1917 by Charles Hazelius Sternberg and sons in the Dinosaur Provincial Park in Alberta at the Little Sandhill Creek site. In 1924 Charles Whitney Gilmore named \"Chirostenotes pergracilis\" and referred the jaws to this species. In the eighties it became clear that \"Chirostenotes\" was an oviraptosaur to which the long jaws could not have belonged. Therefore, in 1990 Phillip Currie, John Keith Rigby and Robert Evan Sloan named a separate species: \"Richardoestesia gilmorei\". The genus is named for Richard Estes, to honor his important work on small vertebrates and especially theropod teeth of the Late Cretaceous. The naming authors actually intended to use the spelling \"Ricardoestesia\", \"Ricardus\" being the normal latinisation of \"Richard\". However, except in one overlooked figure caption, the editors of the paper altered the spelling to include the 'h'. Ironically, in 1991 George Olshevsky in a species list also used the spelling \"Richardoestesia\", and indicated \"Ricardoestesia\" to be the misspelling, unaware that the original authors actually intended the name to be spelled this way. As a result, under ICZN rules, he acted as \"first revisor\" choosing between the two spelling variants of the original publication and inadvertently made the misspelt name official. Subsequently, the original authors have adopted the spelling \"Richardoestesia\". The specific name honors Gilmore.\n\n\"Richardoestesia\"-like teeth have been found in many Late Cretaceous geological formations, including the Horseshoe Canyon Formation, the Scollard Formation, Hell Creek Formation, Ferris Formation, and the Lance Formation (dated to about 66 million years ago). Similar teeth have been referred to this genus from as early as the Barremian age (Cedar Mountain Formation, 125 million years ago).\n\nBecause of the disparity in location and time of the many referred teeth, researchers have cast doubt on the idea that they all belong to the same genus or species, and the genus is best considered a form taxon. A comparative study of the teeth published in 2013 demonstrated that both \"R. gilmorei\" and \"R. isosceles\" were only definitively present in the Dinosaur Park Formation, dated to between 76.5 and 75 million years ago. \"R. isosceles\" was also present in the Aguja Formation, roughly the same age. All other referred teeth most likely belong to different species, which have not been named due to the lack of body fossils for comparison.\n\nFossils of \"Richartoestesia\" have also been found in the Tremp Formation of northeastern Spain.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1962537", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1962537", "title": "Attitude change", "text": "Attitude change\n\nAttitudes are associated beliefs and behaviors towards some object. They are not stable, and because of the communication and behavior of other people, are subject to change by social influences, as well as by the individual's motivation to maintain cognitive consistency when cognitive dissonance occurs—when two attitudes or attitude and behavior conflict. Attitudes and attitude objects are functions of affective and cognitive components. It has been suggested that the inter-structural composition of an associative network can be altered by the activation of a single node. Thus, by activating an affective or emotional node, attitude change may be possible, though affective and cognitive components tend to be intertwined.\n\nThere are three bases for attitude change: compliance, identification, and internalization. These three processes represent the different levels of attitude change.\n\nCompliance refers to a change in behavior based on consequences, such as an individual's hopes to gain rewards or avoid punishment from another group or person. The individual does not necessarily experience changes in beliefs or evaluations of an attitude object, but rather is influenced by the social outcomes of adopting a change in behavior. \nThe individual is also often aware that he or she is being urged to respond in a certain way.\n\nCompliance was demonstrated through a series of laboratory experiments known as the Asch experiments. Experiments led by Solomon Asch of Swarthmore College asked groups of students to participate in a \"vision test\". In reality, all but one of the participants were confederates of the experimenter, and the study was really about how the remaining student would react to the confederates' behavior. Participants were asked to pick, out of three line options, the line that is the same length as a sample and were asked to give the answer out loud. Unbeknown to the participants, Asch had placed a number of confederates to deliberately give the wrong answer before the participant. The results showed that 75% of responses were in line with majority influence and were the same answers the confederates picked. Variations in the experiments showed that compliance rates increased as the number of confederates increased, and the plateau was reached with around 15 confederates. The likelihood of compliance dropped with minority opposition, even if only one confederate gave the correct answer. The basis for compliance is founded on the fundamental idea that people want to be accurate and right.\n\nIdentification explains one's change of beliefs and affect in order to be similar to someone one admires or likes. In this case, the individual adopts the new attitude, not due to the specific content of the attitude object, but because it is associated with the desired relationship. Often, children's attitudes on race, or their political party affiliations are adopted from their parents' attitudes and beliefs.\n\nInternalization refers to the change in beliefs and affect when one finds the content of the attitude to be intrinsically rewarding, and thus leads to actual change in beliefs or evaluations of an attitude object. The new attitude or behavior is consistent with the individual's value system, and tends to be merged with the individual's existing values and beliefs. Therefore, behaviors adopted through internalization are due to the content of the attitude object.\n\nThe expectancy-value theory is based on internalization of attitude change. This model states that the behavior towards some object is a function of an individual's intent, which is a function of one's overall attitude towards the action.\n\nEmotion plays a major role in persuasion, social influence, and attitude change. Much of attitude research has emphasised the importance of affective or emotion components. Emotion works hand-in-hand with the cognitive process, or the way we think, about an issue or situation. Emotional appeals are commonly found in advertising, health campaigns and political messages. Recent examples include no-smoking health campaigns (see tobacco advertising) and political campaigns emphasizing the fear of terrorism. Attitude change based on emotions can be seen vividly in serial killers who are faced with major stress. There is considerable empirical support for the idea that emotions in the form of fear arousal, empathy, or a positive mood can enhance attitude change under certain conditions.\n\nImportant factors that influence the impact of emotional appeals include self-efficacy, attitude accessibility, issue involvement, and message/source features. Attitudes that are central to one's being are highly resistant to change while others that are less fixed may change with new experiences or information. A new attitude (e.g. to time-keeping or absenteeism or quality) may challenge existing beliefs or norms so creating a feeling of psychological discomfort known as cognitive dissonance. It is difficult to measure attitude change since attitudes may only be inferred and there might be significant divergence between those publicly declared and privately held. Self-efficacy is a perception of one's own human agency; in other words, it is the perception of our own ability to deal with a situation. It is an important variable in emotional appeal messages because it dictates a person's ability to deal with both the emotion and the situation. For example, if a person is not self-efficacious about their ability to impact the global environment, they are not likely to change their attitude or behaviour about global warming.\n\nAffective forecasting, otherwise known as intuition or the prediction of emotion, also impacts attitude change. Research suggests that predicting emotions is an important component of decision making, in addition to the cognitive processes. How we feel about an outcome may override purely cognitive rationales.\nIn terms of research methodology, the challenge for researchers is measuring emotion and subsequent impacts on attitude. Since we cannot see into the brain, various models and measurement tools have been constructed to obtain emotion and attitude information. Measures may include the use of physiological cues like facial expressions, vocal changes, and other body rate measures. For instance, fear is associated with raised eyebrows, increased heart rate and increased body tension. Other methods include concept or network mapping, and using primes or word cues.\n\nMany dual process models are used to explain the affective (emotional) and cognitive processing and interpretations of messages, as well as the different depths of attitude change. These include the heuristic-systematic model of information processing and the elaboration likelihood model.\n\nThe heuristic-systematic model of information processing describes two depths in the processing of attitude change, systematic processing and heuristic processing. In this model information is either processed in a high-involvement and high-effort systematic way, or information is processed through shortcuts known as \"heuristics\". For example, emotions are affect-based heuristics, in which feelings and gut-feeling reactions are often used as shortcuts.\n\nSystematic processing occurs when individuals are motivated and have high cognition to process a message. Individuals using systematic processing are motivated to pay attention and have the cognitive ability to think deeply about a message; they are persuaded by the content of the message, such as the strength or logic of the argument. Motivation can be determined by many factors, such as how personally relevant the topic is, and cognitive ability can be determined by how knowledgeable an individual is on the message topic, or whether or not there is a distraction in the room. Individuals who receive a message through systematic processing usually internalize the message, resulting in a longer and more stable attitude change.\n\nAccording to the heuristic-systematic model of information processing, people are motivated to use systematic processing when they want to achieve a \"desired level of confidence\" in their judgments. There are factors that have been found to increase the use of systematic processing; these factors are associated with either decreasing an individual's actual confidence or increasing an individual's perceived confidence. These factors may include framing persuasive messages in an unexpected manner; self-relevancy of the message.\n\nSystematic processing has been shown to be beneficial in social influence settings. Systematic reasoning has been shown to be successful in producing more valid solutions during group discussions and greater solution accuracy. Shestowsky's (1998) research in dyad discussions revealed that the individual in the dyad who had high motivation and high need in cognition had the greater impact on group decisions.\n\nHeuristic processing occurs when individuals have low motivation and/or low cognitive ability to process a message. Instead of focusing on the argument of the message, recipients using heuristic processing focus on more readily accessible information and other unrelated cues, such as the authority or attractiveness of the speaker. Individuals who process a message through heuristic processing do not internalize the message, and thus any attitude change resulting from the persuasive message is temporary and unstable.\n\nFor example, people are more likely to grant favors if reasons are provided. A study shows that when people said, \"Excuse me, I have five pages to xerox. May I use the copier?\" they received a positive response of 60%. The statement, \"Excuse me, I have five pages to xerox. I am in a rush. May I use the copier?\" produced a 95% success rate.\n\nHeuristic processing examples include social proof, reciprocity, authority, and liking.\n\n\nThe elaboration likelihood model is similar in concept to and shares many ideas with other dual processing models, such as the heuristic-systematic model of information processing. In the elaboration likelihood model, cognitive processing is the central route and affective/emotion processing is often associated with the peripheral route. The central route pertains to an elaborate cognitive processing of information while the peripheral route relies on cues or feelings. The ELM suggests that true attitude change only happens through the central processing route that incorporates both cognitive and affective components as opposed to the more heuristics-based peripheral route. This suggests that motivation through emotion alone will not result in an attitude change.\n\nCognitive dissonance, a theory originally developed by Festinger (1957), is the idea that people experience a sense of guilt or uneasiness when two linked cognitions are inconsistent, such as when there are two conflicting attitudes about a topic, or inconsistencies between one's attitude and behavior on a certain topic. The basic idea of the Cognitive Dissonance Theory relating to attitude change, is that people are motivated to reduce dissonance which can be achieved through changing their attitudes and beliefs. Cooper & Fazio's (1984) have also added that cognitive dissonance does not arise from any simple cognitive inconsistency, but rather results from freely chosen behavior that may bring about negative consequences. These negative consequences may be threats to the consistency, stability, predictability, competence, moral goodness of the self-concept, or violation of general self-integrity.\n\nResearch has suggested multiple routes that cognitive dissonance can be reduced. Self-affirmation has been shown to reduce dissonance, however it is not always the mode of choice when trying to reduce dissonance. When multiple routes are available, it has been found that people prefer to reduce dissonance by directly altering their attitudes and behaviors rather than through self-affirmation. People who have high levels of self-esteem, who are postulated to possess abilities to reduce dissonance by focusing on positive aspects of the self, have also been found to prefer modifying cognitions, such as attitudes and beliefs, over self-affirmation. A simple example of cognitive dissonance resulting in attitude change would be when a heavy smoker learns that his sister died young from lung cancer due to heavy smoking as well, this individual experiences conflicting cognitions: the desire to smoke, and the knowledge that smoking could lead to death and a desire not to die. In order to reduce dissonance, this smoker could change his behavior (i.e. stop smoking), change his attitude about smoking (i.e. smoking is harmful), or retain his original attitude about smoking and modify his new cognition to be consistent with the first one--\"I also work out so smoking won't be harmful to me\". Thus, attitude change is achieved when individuals experience feelings of uneasiness or guilt due to cognitive dissonance, and actively reduce the dissonance through changing their attitude, beliefs, or behavior relating in order to achieve consistency with the inconsistent cognitions.\n\nCarl Hovland and his band of persuasion researchers learned a great deal during World War 2 and later at Yale about the process of attitude change.\n\nThe process of how people change their own attitudes has been studied for years. Belief rationalization has been recognized as an important aspect to understand this process. The stability of people's past attitudes can be influenced if they hold beliefs that are inconsistent with their own behaviors. The influence of past behavior on current attitudes is stable when little information conflicts with the behavior. Alternatively, people's attitudes may lean more radically toward the prior behavior if the conflict makes it difficult to ignore, and forces them to rationalize their past behavior. For example, if a person believes that Greece is a beautiful country and that the people there are very hardworking, then their belief will be stable or even become reinforced when they visit the country and are amazed by its beauty. However, when they interact with local Greeks, they realize they might in actuality not be as hard-working as they had imagined. This inconsistency becomes difficult to ignore once it stands out.\n\nAttitudes are often restructured at the time people are asked to report them. As a result, inconsistencies between the information that enters into the reconstruction and the original attitudes can produce changes in prior attitudes, whereas consistency between these elements often elicits stability in prior attitudes. Individuals need to resolve the conflict between their own behaviors and the subsequent beliefs. However, people usually align themselves with their attitudes and beliefs instead of their behaviors. More importantly, this process of resolving people's cognitive conflicts that emerges cuts across both self-perception and dissonance even when the associated effect may only be strong in changing prior attitudes\n\nHuman judgment is comparative in nature. Departing from identifying people's need to justify their own beliefs in the context of their own behaviors, psychologists also believe that people have the need to carefully evaluate new messages on the basis of whether these messages support or contradict with prior messages, regardless of whether they can recall the prior messages after they reach a conclusion. This comparative processing mechanism is built on \"information-integration theory\" and \"social judgement theory\". Both of these theories have served to model people's attitude change in judging the new information while they haven't adequately explained the influential factors that motivate people to integrate the information.\n\nMore recent work in the area of persuasion has further explored this \"comparative processing\" from the perspective of focusing on comparing between different sets of information on one single issue or object instead of simply making comparisons among different issues or objects. As previous research demonstrated, analyzing information on one target product may trigger less impact of comparative information than comparing this product with the same product under competing brands.\n\nWhen people compare different sets of information on one single issue or object, the effect of people's effort to compare new information with prior information seemed to correlate with the perceived strength of the new, strong information when considered jointly with the initial information. Comparison processes can be enhanced when prior evaluations, associated information, or both are accessible. People will simply construct a current judgment based on the new information or adjust the prior judgment when they are not able to retrieve the information from prior messages. The impact this comparative process can have on people's attitude change is mediated by changes in the strength of new information perceived by receivers. The effects of comparison on judgment change were mediated by changes in the perceived strength of the information. These findings above have wide range of applications in social marketing, political communication, and health promotion. For example, designing an advertisement that is counteractive against an existing attitude towards a behavior or policy is perhaps most effective if the advertisement uses the same format, characters, or music of ads associated with the initial attitudes.\n\n"}

He played for 11 seasons in Major League Baseball, all for the New York Yankees, and coached for 23 seasons, for the Yankees, New York Mets, Houston Astros, and Seattle Mariners. He was a five-time MLB All-Star as a player and a five-time World Series champion as a coach.\n\nStottlemyre pitched in American Legion Baseball and attended Mabton High School in Mabton, Washington, and Yakima Valley Community College. A scout for the New York Yankees discovered Stottlemyre pitching for Yakima's baseball team, and signed him to a contract with no signing bonus on June 10, 1961. The Yankees assigned him to the Harlan Smokies of the Rookie-level Appalachian League. After appearing in eight games, the Yankees promoted him to the Auburn Yankees of the Class D New York–Penn League, and he appeared in seven games for Auburn.\n\nStottlemyre pitched to a 17–9 win–loss record and a 2.50 earned run average (ERA) with the Greensboro Yankees of the Class B Carolina League in 1962, and was promoted to the Richmond Virginians of the Class AAA International League in 1963. He alternated between starting and relieving for Richmond, before Ralph Houk, the Yankees' general manager, insisted that Stottlemyre be used exclusively as a starting pitcher. He recorded a 1.42 ERA in the 1964 season, the best in the International League.\n\nCalled up midseason in 1964, Stottlemyre went 9–3 to help the Yankees to their fifth consecutive pennant while being on the cover of \"The Sporting News\". In the 1964 World Series, Stottlemyre faced Bob Gibson of the St. Louis Cardinals three times in the seven-game Series. Stottlemyre bested Gibson in Game 2 to even the series, and got a no-decision in Game 5, but lost the decisive Game 7 as the Cardinals won the Series.\n\nStottlemyre was named to the American League's (AL) roster for the 1965 Major League Baseball (MLB) All-Star Game, though he did not appear in the game. He won 20 games in the 1965 season, and led the AL with 18 complete games, 291 innings pitched, and 1,188 batters faced. He appeared in the 1966 MLB All-Star Game. He led the league with 20 losses. Stottlemyre won 20 games in the 1968 and 1969 seasons. He also started the 1969 MLB All-Star Game.\n\nStottlemyre threw 40 shutouts in his 11-season career, the same number as Hall of Fame lefty Sandy Koufax, which ties for 44th best all-time. Eighteen of those shutouts came in a three-season span from 1971–73.\nThe Yankees released Stottlemyre before the 1975 season. Stottlemyre retired with 164 career wins and a 2.97 ERA.\n\nKnown as a solid-hitting pitcher, on July 20, 1965, Stottlemyre hit a rare inside-the-park grand slam. On September 26, 1964, he recorded five base hits in five at bats.\n\nIn 1977, Stottlemyre re-emerged in baseball as a roving instructor for the Seattle Mariners. He spent five seasons in that position, and was hired by the New York Mets as their pitching coach in November 1983. He served in the role for ten years (including the 1986 World Series championship team) and then followed that by serving a two-year stint as the Houston Astros pitching coach.\n\nIn 1996, Stottlemyre joined the Yankees coaching staff along with the incoming manager Joe Torre. Under Torre, Stottlemyre lowered the team ERA from 4.65 in 1996 to 3.84 in 1997. Under Stottlemyre, the Yankee team averaged an ERA of 4.23 from 1996 to 2005. The pitching staff was regarded as a major factor in the team's dynasty years, when they won four World Series Championships in five years.\n\nAfter 10 seasons, Stottlemyre resigned his coaching position on October 12, 2005, following the Yankees' defeat in the 2005 American League Division Series by the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim. He cited personal disagreements with Yankees owner George Steinbrenner among his reasons for leaving and cited Steinbrenner's comment that, after the division series was over, he had congratulated Angels manager Mike Scioscia. Stottlemyre's response was: \"My first thought was, 'What about Joe?' Joe did a hell of a job, too. To congratulate the other manager and not congratulate your own, after what he's done this year, I laughed.\" The Yankees replaced Stottlemyre with former Yankees pitcher Ron Guidry.\n\nStottlemyre was named pitching coach of the Seattle Mariners under manager John McLaren at the beginning of the 2008 season, and was retained by interim manager Jim Riggleman after McLaren's firing. He was dismissed after the season ended. Following the season, he retired from baseball.\n\nThe mayor of Mabton, Washington, declared October 12, 1964, to be \"Mel Stottlemyre Day\". He was inducted into the Washington State American Legion Baseball Hall of Fame in 2012. At Old-Timers' Day on June 20, 2015, the Yankees dedicated a plaque in Monument Park in Stottlemyre's honor.\n\nStottlemyre was raised in the town of Mabton, Washington, located in the south-central part of the state. He resided with his wife, Jean, in Issaquah, Washington. Two of his sons, Todd and Mel Jr., followed their father by becoming major-league pitchers. His other son, Jason, died of leukemia at the age of 11.\n\nStottlemyre and John Harper coauthored an autobiography titled \"Pride and Pinstripes\", published in 2007.\n\nStottlemyre was diagnosed with multiple myeloma in 2000. In remission for several years, he was an avid supporter of the Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation. The cancer reappeared in 2011. Stottlemyre died on January 13, 2019 at the age of 77,\nof cancer. To honor Stottlemyre, the Yankees wore black armbands on their uniform during the 2019 season.\n\n\n"}

On 22 March 1994 two transoms (the supporting beams suspended from wire ropes running from side to side beneath the bridge) snapped causing the bridge to collapse while beekeeper Kenneth Richards was crossing in a laden light truck. Richards was killed when the truck fell 30 metres into the river.\n\nThe bridge was built on public land in 1986 for Keith and Margaret Berryman, a nearby landowner, by members of the New Zealand Army and a group of Fijian army trainees, as an exercise. The design was based upon calculations by Lieutenant John Armstrong, with labour and logistics for construction provided at New Zealand army expense. The Berrymans were to provide all materials, but instead of the specified macrocarpa or tanalised radiata pine timber for the transoms and bearers, they obtained Douglas fir timber from a demolition site in Wanganui. Lieutenant Armstrong's initial reaction was not to proceed with construction using deficient materials, but he was eventually persuaded when Keith Berryman signed a statement, witnessed by a neighbouring JP, taking responsibility for the materials and their subsequent inspection and maintenance. Loading was recalculated accordingly.\n\nUntreated Douglas fir timber has featured in the leaky homes saga around New Zealand; it is difficult to treat against decay and untreated timber is suitable for use only where it can be adequately protected from moisture. Te Rata receives about 1800 mm (72 in) of rainfall per year, and the river gorge is continuously damp with frequent fog.\n\nG. W. Butcher, a retired Lieutenant Colonel and civil engineer, who reported on the collapse for the army, concluded that the failure was caused by \"50% reduction in the nominal strength of the member ... entirely due to decay of the untreated timber.\" Additional factors were \"the decision to use two 300x75 beams bolted together for the transoms in place of a solid 300x150 member\" and the lack of a \"regular inspection and maintenance programme [...] by the owners of the bridge\".\n\nThe army withheld Butcher's report from the 1997 inquest into Richards' death and kept its contents secret until it was published illegally on the internet by the Berrymans' lawyer, Rob Moodie. The Berrymans claim that their fight against attempts by the Occupational Safety and Health department to prosecute them for Richards' death has led to bankruptcy and the loss of their farm.\n\nThe complete text of the Butcher report is held at . Its author could not previously comment publicly on its implications, but since its illegal distribution the Army has released the report. George Butcher has now spoken publicly and said Keith Berryman admitted to him that the transoms were in poor condition, that there was visible rot in some timbers, and that he was worried about the state of the bridge. Knowledge of an unsafe work environment and failure to prevent or isolate the risk is an offence in New Zealand, but the prosecution of the Berrymans failed when the judge ruled the bridge did not meet the definition of Mr Richards' place of work in the Health and Safety in Employment Act 1992.\n\nThe Berryman Bridge was the second suspension bridge to be the primary access to Te Rata. The earlier bridge, which collapsed around the 1980s, was a fearsome structure on the same site. In the 'Otago Born and Bred' articles noted below, this first bridge is referred to as the Hayes Bridge. The Hayes bridge, said to be 100 ft above the water, is understood by the Ruslings, still resident in the valley, to have been built by the Tichner brothers, formerly sailors, around 1915–1916. The cables consisted of bunches of 52 strands of No. 8 wire, and endured the whole life of the bridge, a period of at least 66 years. When the bridge finally collapsed under the weight of a mob of sheep, the uprights on the house side gave way, allowing the anchors to fall away. Evan and Bob Hayes, who were moving the sheep, were fortunately not on the bridge when it collapsed, but most of the sheep were either killed from the fall, or drowned in the Retaruke.\n\n\n"}

Designed to a United States Navy specification, the helicopter was produced from 1949 to 1954, and was also used by the United States Army and foreign navies. The HUP/H-25 was the first helicopter to perform a loop and to be produced with an autopilot.\n\nThe design was a product of a competition by the U.S. Navy in 1945 for a compact utility/rescue helicopter to operate from ships including aircraft carriers, battleships, and cruisers. Either 2 or 3 prototypes—designated PV-14 by the factory and XHJP-1 by the Navy—were built and subjected to a side-by-side flight evaluation against the 3 prototypes of the Sikorsky XHJS-1; however, the XHJS was fundamentally a scaled-up version of the Sikorsky H-5, and the increased weight and size magnified the design's problems with maintaining proper weight and balance under varying loading conditions. The Piasecki won the competition, and with the introduction of the aircraft configuration letter \"U\" for Utility in the 1950s, the aircraft was ordered for production as the HUP-1.\n\nThe design featured two three-bladed, rotors in tandem in which blades could be folded for storage; the relatively small rotor diameter allowed the aircraft to use aircraft carrier elevators with its blades fully extended. The tandem overlapping rotor configuration was a development by Piasecki and was used in future helicopter designs by the company and successors including the H-21, HRB-1/CH-46, and CH-47. The original HUP-1 was powered by a single Continental R-975-34 radial engine, with a take-off rating of , while later versions used the uprated R-975-42 or R-975-46A with . To aid search and rescue (SAR) operations, the aircraft was equipped with an overhead winch capable of lifting 400 lb (181 kg), which could lower a rescue sling through an electrically-operated door available after the copilot's seat was folded forward.\n\nDuring a flight demonstration of its capability to withstand high g-force, the type became the first helicopter to perform a loop, albeit unintentionally.\n\nThe aircraft first entered service in February 1949 with the delivery of the first of 32 HUP-1 aircraft to the US Navy. The improved HUP-2 (Piasecki designation PV-18) was soon introduced with a more powerful engine, deletion of the inward-canted horizontal stabilizer endplate fins, and various minor changes in equipment; a sub-variant equipped with dunking sonar for anti-submarine warfare was given the designation HUP-2S. The HUP-2 was the first production helicopter equipped with an autopilot. The US Navy also tested a system called \"Raydist\" that allowed an unmanned HUP-2 to be directed from a ground station and by radio ordered to hover within five feet of the desired point. Edo tested a HUP-2 with a fiberglass hull and outrigger floats for amphibious operations.\n\nAn upgraded version of the HUP-2 was built for the US Army and designated as the H-25A Army Mule, but most were quickly withdrawn from Army service and converted for naval use under the designation HUP-3.\n\nIn 1954, the Royal Canadian Navy received 3 former US Army H-25A aircraft, which were modified and redesignated on delivery to conform to US Navy HUP-3 standards. The aircraft were used aboard HMCS \"Labrador\" for SAR and varied utility duties, and were later used to support construction at Distant Early Warning Line radar sites. The helicopters were subsequently posted to NAF Patricia Bay and naval air station HMCS \"Shearwater\"; after the last 2 were struck off strength on 18 January 1964, 1 aircraft was donated to a technical school and the other 2 were sold as surplus.\n\nThe US Army H-25 designation was adopted by the US Navy in 1962 on introduction of the 1962 United States Tri-Service aircraft designation system. The final units were withdrawn from US service in 1964. It also served with French Naval Aviation (Aeronavale) from 1953 to 1965.\n\nA total of 339 aircraft were delivered during the 6-year production run. A large number of surplus US Navy aircraft later appeared on the US civil registry, and at least 7 were transferred to the French Navy.\n\nOn 7 November 2009, former US Navy HUP-1, BuNo \"124925\", civil registration number \"N183YP\", collided with high-voltage power lines in Adelanto, California; the subsequent crash and post-crash fire killed all 3 occupants and substantially damaged the aircraft. Operated in association with Classic Rotors, the accident aircraft was the only airworthy example in the world. The National Transportation Safety Board attributed the crash to \"\"The pilot’s failure to maintain clearance from powerlines during en route flight.\"\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor surviving aircraft, hyphenated numbers are original US Army Serial Numbers; six-digit numbers are original US Navy Bureau of Aeronautics (BuAer) Bureau Numbers (BuNo). All 50 H-25A/HUP-3 aircraft transferred from the US Army to the US Navy were given new bureau numbers; 3 aircraft transferred to the Royal Canadian Navy were redesignated, but retained their original US Army serial numbers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1962581", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1962581", "title": "Edgar Alwin Payne", "text": "Edgar Alwin Payne\n\nEdgar Alwin Payne (1 March 1883 – 8 April 1947) was an American Western landscape painter and muralist.\n\nPayne was born near Cassville, Barry County, Missouri, in the heart of the Ozarks. Cassville is in southwest Missouri, near the Arkansas border. Despite his relative isolation this turn-of-the-century Missouri teenager toured the world. Before Edgar was done he would crisscross the United States, travel to Mexico, Canada, and Europe, and even spend the summer in the Alps. But, like John Muir before him, and Ansel Adams after, it was the American West that most appealed to his heart.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Census of 1900, he resided with his parents, two sisters and five brothers in Prairie Grove, Washington County, Arkansas; his Alabama-born father was employed as a carpenter. Edgar’s occupation was listed as “carpenter, apprentice.” Leaving home on several occasions, Payne painted houses, signs, portraits, murals, and local theater stage sets, to pay his way. Traveling through the Ozarks, then around the Southeast and Midwest, he finally wound up in Chicago, and enrolled to study portrait art at the Art Institute of Chicago. He remained only two weeks at the institute, finding it too structured. He preferred instead to be self-taught, relying on practice and his own sense of direction.\n\nStruggling at first, he soon exhibited a group of landscape works, painted on a small easel, at the Palette and Chisel Club. During this period he also obtained the occasional mural work to supplement his income.\n\nHe made his way to California for the first time in 1909, at the age of 26. He spent several months painting at Laguna Beach, then headed to San Francisco. In San Francisco he met other artists, including commercial artist Elsie Palmer (1884–1971). He returned to California for a second time in 1911. When he returned to Illinois that fall, he found that Elsie had taken a job as commercial artist in Chicago. This cemented their already growing interest in each other. On the morning of their wedding day about a year later, 9 November 1912, Edgar noticed that the light was \"perfect\", and had Elsie postpone the ceremony until the afternoon. Luckily the artist in her offered some understanding.\n\nAs a couple they became well known in Chicago's art circle. Elsie helped Edgar with his mural work, and soon he had an exhibition at the Art Institute of Chicago. Arguably their greatest collaborative effort happened in 1914 with the arrival of their daughter, Evelyn. Between 1915 and 1918-19 Edgar maintained a professional address in Chicago at the Tree Studio Building on East Ohio Street.\n\nThe following spring they took Evelyn to see her maternal grandparents in San Francisco. They also attended the Panama-Pacific International Exposition. The following year Edgar made his first trip to the Sierra Nevada Mountains. This trip was a big moment in his life, and Payne would return again and again to paint the unspoiled Sierra; these paintings remain one of the hallmarks of his work.\n\nHe earned his first major commission in 1917. In a bid to attract tourism, the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railroad asked him to paint the Southwest, along the railroads' trek from Albuquerque to California. This commission not only solidified his reputation as an artist, it also forever linked him to Western America. Although he painted in Europe, he is most remembered for his work from the Four Corners area of the Navajo Nation Reservation, Yosemite, and the California coast. That year he and Elsie spent four months painting, exploring, and taking in Canyon de Chelly. This area, from Taos, New Mexico to the Grand Canyon, became one of Payne's two main inspirations for the next twenty years.\n\nThe Santa Fe Railroad commissions were the turn of the century brainchild of William H. Simpson, chief of the railway's advertising department. Starting in 1892, with Thomas Moran, Simpson exchanged travel on the train, along with lodging at railroad hotels and meals at railroad restaurants, and sometimes even cash, for paintings, photographs, pottery, and jewelry. This endeavor lasted for decades and made the Santa Fe one of the largest collectors of southwestern fine art.\n\nWhen the Santa Fe commission expired the couple returned to San Francisco. Edgar received a commission from the Congress Hotel in Chicago for a mural on 11,000 square yards of muslin. The mural was to cover several floors of the hallways of the hotel. Payne rented a warehouse in Glendale, California and hired other artists, including Elsie, to help complete the work.\n\nIn 1918, Edgar and Elsie made their home and studio in Laguna Beach. He helped to organize the Laguna Beach Art Association, and become its first president. They spent the next four years painting their way through the southwest, in places like Canadian Rockies in British Columbia and Alberta, Canada, and then exhibiting in the Los Angeles area. Sometimes their trips would involve hiking into the backcountry, looking for undisturbed places of raw and rare beauty to paint, sometimes for weeks. Edgar exhibited extensively in California, including such important venues as the California Art Club (1918-1921), California State Fair (gold medal 1918; silver medal in 1919), Cannell & Chaffin Galleries (1920), and Stendahl Galleries (1921-1922). The Paynes spent part of the summer of 1921 at the California art colony of Carmel-by-the-Sea where Edgar exhibited his work at the Fifteenth Annual Exhibition of the local Arts and Crafts Club. After finding success during this period, the trio took a two-year \"painting tour\" of Europe, 1922-1924. Painting in Brittany, Paris, Provence, Switzerland, and Venice. His favorite place in Europe was the Alps, where he painted the Great White Peak of Mont Blanc, which the Paris Salon gave \"an honorable mention\" in spring 1923.\n\n\"The Great White Peak\" is reputed to be in the collection of Newport Harbor High School in Newport Beach, California. This painting, and others, formed a collection of annual acquisitions at an art show sponsored to acquaint high school students with styles of painting and art. The collection was forgotten and distributed to various offices (and closets) in the school district. Its existence was rediscovered by school librarian John McGinnis who tracked down and restored all 56 of the missing paintings. The collection is now known as \"The Ruth Stoever Fleming Collection\".\n\nUpon returning the U.S. in the fall of 1924, the Paynes first stayed in Chicago, then went back to Laguna Beach, and then to New York City in 1926. Always on the go, they painted in Arizona, California, the California Sierras, Connecticut, New Mexico, New York, and Utah. They spent summers crossing the country, painting as they went. They returned to Europe to paint the harbors of Brittany, and Chioggia, in 1928. The following summer they painted Lake Louise, Alberta.\n\nAfter the financial collapse of 1929, and the subsequent Great Depression, commissions didn’t come as easily, so the Paynes returned to Southern California on a more permanent basis, purchasing a new Los Angeles, studio-home, in 1932. During this time, Evelyn would marry, and Edgar and Elsie would become separated that same year. Edgar moved to Hollywood, to a small studio-home on Seward Street. However, he would spend a great deal of his time in the California Sierra Nevada Mountains, painting his favorite subject.\n\nHis lifelong obsession with the Sierras would lead him to produce a documentary film, \"“Sierra Journey”\". In 1941 he wrote \"Composition of Outdoor Painting\", a comprehensive book on composition and composition forms. The book also explains landscape painting techniques, color, repetition, rhythm, and value. The seventh edition printing of the work was completed in 2005.\n\nAfter a 14-year separation, Elsie returned to help Edgar in 1946, upon learning that he had cancer. She stayed with him until he died, 8 April 1947.\n\nThere is a bronze relief sculpture of Edgar at the Laguna Beach Art Museum, done by Elsie in 1952. She championed his work until her own health, and degradation of eyesight, caused her to stop in 1959. She moved in with Evelyn and her husband, in 1969, in Minneapolis. Elsie died peacefully 17 June 1971.\n\nYou can find works of Payne's that are of Italian harbors, the Alps, landscapes of Laguna, but Edgar Alwin Payne is most remembered for his work of American Indians of the Four Corners area, and, of course, the paintings of his beloved Sierras. In the Sierras, high up in Humphrey's Basin, you will find the lake named for him, Payne Lake.\n\nHis work was an influence on Bill Wray, John Deckert and other painters.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Tux Paint is seen by many as a free software alternative to Kid Pix, a similar proprietary educational software product.\n\nTux Paint was initially created for the Linux operating system, as there was no suitable drawing program for young children available for Linux at that time. It is written in the C programming language and uses various free and open source helper libraries, including the Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL), and has since been made available for Microsoft Windows, Apple Mac OS X, BeOS and other platforms.\n\nSelected milestone releases:\n\n\nTux Paint stands apart from typical graphics editing software (such as GIMP or Photoshop) that it was designed to be usable by children as young as 3 years of age. The user interface is meant to be intuitive, and utilizes icons, audible feedback and textual hints to help explain how the software works. The brightly colored interface, sound effects and cartoon mascot (Tux, the mascot of the Linux kernel) are meant to engage children.\n\nTux Paint's normal interface is split into five sections:\n\n\nA simple slideshow feature allows previously saved images to be displayed as a basic flip-book animation or as a slide presentation.\n\nLike most popular graphics editing and composition tools, Tux Paint includes a paintbrush, an eraser, and tools to draw lines, polygonal shapes and text. Tux Paint provides multiple levels of undo and redo, allowing accidental or unwanted changes to be removed while editing a picture.\n\nTux Paint was designed in such a way that the user does not need to understand the underlying operating system or how to deal with files. The \"Save\" and \"Open\" commands were designed to mimic those of software for personal digital assistant devices, such as the Palm handheld. When one saves a picture in Tux Paint, they do not need to provide a file name or browse for where to place it. When one goes to open a previously saved picture, a collection of thumbnails of saved images is shown.\n\nSimilarly, printing is typically a 'no questions asked' process, as well.\n\nTux Paint includes a number of 'filters' and 'special effects' which can be applied to a drawing, such as blurring, fading, and making the picture look as though it was drawn in chalk on pavement. These are available through the 'Magic' tool in Tux Paint. Starting with version 0.9.18, Tux Paint's 'Magic' tools are built as plugins that are loaded at runtime and use a C API specifically for creating such tools.\n\nA large collection of artwork and photographic imagery are also available (under a license allowing free redistribution), and may be placed inside drawings using Tux Paint's \"Rubber Stamp\" tool. Stamps can be in either raster (bitmap) format (in PNG format, supporting 24bpp and full alpha transparency), or as vector graphics (in SVG format) on many platforms Tux Paint supports. As of mid-2008, over 800 stamps are included in the stamps collection.\n\nAs features are added to Tux Paint, configuration options have been added that allow parents and teachers to disable features and alter the behavior to better suit their children's or students' needs, or to better integrate the software in their home or school computing environment. Typical options, such as enabling or disabling sound effects and full-screen mode are available. There are also options that help make Tux Paint suitable for younger or disabled children, such as displaying text using only uppercase letters or ignoring the distinction between buttons on the mouse.\n\nTux Paint has been translated into numerous languages, and has support for the display of text in languages that use non-Latin character sets, such as Japanese, Greek, or Telugu. As of June 2008, over 80 languages are supported. Correct support for complex languages requires Pango. Sound effects and descriptive sounds for stamp imagery can also be localized. Tux Paint includes its own form of input method support, allowing entry of non-Latin characters using the 'Text' tool. Japanese (Romanized Hiragana and Romanized Katakana), Korean (Hangul 2-bul) and Traditional Chinese are currently supported.\n\nTux Paint is included with the software that comes with the ASUS Eee PC. It is also a standard package in educationally oriented Linux distributions, such as Debian Jr. and Edubuntu, as an optional package in numerous other Linux distributions, as well as part of numerous educationally oriented Linux Live CDs. It is included in various software collections for Windows (such as GNUWin II and Open Source Software CD), as well as in portable software collections for Windows, since it can be run as a stand-alone application (without needing to be installed system-wide). Tux Paint is also available as an activity within the free and open source educational suite GCompris.\n\n\n"}

He played for FC Nantes, Stade Rennais, RC Lens, FC Sion in Switzerland, and FC Lorient.\n\nMonterrubio started his professional career at Nantes in 1996. Product of the famed \"Centre of Formation\" of Nantes, he was in the same crop of players such as Mickaël Landreau. He was an essential part of the squad in the 1998–99 season, and his winning penalty handed Nantes the Coupe de France title in 1999. He also scored the winning goal in the 1999 Trophée des Champions and played as a substitute when Nantes won the 2000 Coupe de France Final. Finally, in 2001, Monterrubio became a Ligue 1 winner with \"Les Canaries\".\n\nIn the summer of 2001, Monterrubio signed for fierce rivals Stade Rennais. Despite having a quiet start to his spell at the club, he became one of their key players, establishing a deadly partnership with Swiss striker Alexander Frei, now of FC Basel 1893. In the 2004–05 season, he led Ligue 1 in assists while Frei was the top scorer. Such was his influence, that he has inherited the captain's armband from Cyril Jeunechamp.\n\nIn the last few hours of the January 2007 transfer window, Monterrubio signed for RC Lens as a replacement for Olivier Thomert, who moved in the opposite direction. On 3 February 2007, he played his first Ligue 1 match for Lens against Valenciennes. During this period, he had to fight for his first team place with the Ivorian midfielder Kanga Akalé. He struck up a strong partnership with Nadir Belhadj upon the Algerian left-back's arrival at the club in January 2008, but the team were relegated to Ligue 2 at the end of the season despite Monterrubio's fine form.\n\nMonterrubio signed a two-year contract with Swiss side FC Sion during the summer of 2008.\n\nOn 28 June 2009, he signed a contract between 30 June 2011 with FC Lorient leaving Sion after one year.\n\nBorn in France, Monterrubio is of Spanish descent. In his prime, Monterrubio was among the finest players of his unique kind. Although he did not win a single national team cap, he did receive three call-ups to the France B team, scoring in all 3 of his appearances.\n\nMonterrubio was an accomplished left winger, but had also been featured as a striker and attacking midfielder in the early of his career. He specialized in set-pieces, especially at penalty-taking. He led Ligue 1 in assists in 2004–05 and 2005–06 and was runner-up in 2006–07.\n\n"}
{"id": "1962645", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1962645", "title": "Paul Languedoc", "text": "Paul Languedoc\n\nPaul Languedoc is an American audio engineer and luthier who is most closely associated with the rock band Phish. \n\nHe was the soundman for rock group Phish prior to the band's breakup in 2004. As the band's chief sound engineer and house mixer, he recorded their double-CD \"A Live One\", and all 20 volumes of the Live Phish Series. He also built guitars and basses for Trey Anastasio and Mike Gordon. A luthier by trade, he built his first guitar when he was 18 years old. He later spent four years working for Alan Stack at Time Guitars in Burlington, Vermont, and by the time he had joined Phish in 1986 at age 28, he had built hundreds of instruments. Since then, he has built only for Anastasio and Gordon, and his original designs have given Phish its own unique instrumental identity. Languedoc has a preference for European hardwoods of the types used for building cellos, specializing in inlay work in mother-of-pearl and abalone. Languedoc first worked with Phish on October 15, 1986, at a concert at Hunt's in Burlington, Vermont. He remained with the band until their 2004-2009 hiatus, when Phish resumed touring and recording in 2009, Paul Languedoc declined to join them, deciding to retire from the road to focus on his luthier duties. In March 2009, Garry Brown took over the task of soundman for Phish.\n\nGordon says Languedoc's striking instruments are only one aspect of the many talents he brings to the Phish sound. \"We're really lucky to have Paul. He gives us the freedom to do our own thing.\"\n\nNamed for its intricate headstock inlay, the Dragon bass (built in 1989) has a five-piece curly-maple neck and a bound ebony fingerboard. The body is solid koa, with a face of curly-maple veneer. The guitar bridge and machine heads were made by Schaller. Mike Gordon custom-ordered the instrument's active, 18-volt Mørch pickups from Denmark; they came with myriad knobs and switches Gordon didn't really want. \"I have trouble making decisions,\" he says. \"I probably change my instrument settings only every two years.\" The three larger knobs on the bass control volume (one per pickup) and pickup blend; the four micro-switches and three smaller knobs are for various midrange contours and high and low boosts. (Languedoc comments, \"Even I don't know what they all do!\")\n\nGordon and Languedoc both call the Fish — also named for its inlays — \"a bit of an experiment.\" The bass, which was built about two years ago, has a two-piece curly-maple body with an interior chamber, a koa face with an f-hole and multiple-layered binding, and only one knob, which blends between the two EMG ASB-5 pickups. Mike eventually wants to add a piezo bridge transducer to accentuate the highs of the instrument's hollow body.\n\nIn 2006, Paul Languedoc started Languedoc Guitars, selling handmade instruments through his web site. The guitars for sale are near replicas of the hollow-body guitar Trey Anastasio of Phish currently plays. The G2 model guitar sells for $10,000 and the G4 model sells for $7500. The G2 features two \"F\" holes and a pair of Seymour Duncan '59 Model humbuckers; and the G4 has a single \"F\" hole and a Duncan Custom 5 in the bridge position and a '59 in the neck. As recently as February 2020, Languedoc has zero inventory of new guitars for sale, and his wait-list for future new builds remains listed on his website as \"full\" and \"closed\" to accepting new names.\n\n"}

{"id": "1962648", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1962648", "title": "Central Canada Hockey League", "text": "Central Canada Hockey League\n\nThe Central Canada Hockey League (CCHL) is a Canadian Junior \"A\" hockey league operating in eastern Ontario, Canada. The league is sanctioned by the Hockey Eastern Ontario and Hockey Canada and is a member of the Canadian Junior Hockey League. The winner of the CCHL playoffs competes for the Fred Page Cup — the Eastern Region championship of the Canadian Junior Hockey League — with the winners of the Quebec Junior AAA Hockey League and the Maritime Junior A Hockey League. The winner of the Fred Page Cup then moves on to compete for the national Royal Bank Cup.\n\nIn July 2013, the TheHockeyWriters.com listed the CCHL as one of the ten best developmental leagues, professional or amateur, in North America.\n\nThe league started in 1961 as the \"Ottawa-Hull District Junior Hockey League\", under the sponsorship of the Montreal Canadiens of the National Hockey League (NHL), in hope of a better development program. The league has featured such NHL stars as Steve Yzerman and Larry Robinson, for which its two divisions are named. As this league was for the Ottawa District, teams out of the area were not allowed to compete, with one exemption: Pembroke. In the early years, any player in the league was automatically a member of the Montreal Canadiens, and were forced into a contract which would disallow them to sign with any other NHL team if they wanted to play in the NHL. The Canadiens also wanted the league to be strictly for development, allowing four 19-year-olds and five 18-year-olds per team with the rest of the players being 17 or younger. This was met with much anger and disappointment with players who had just reached their 20s, but the league substantially gained in popularity, and they were ignored. A notable alumnus of the league is 4-time Stanley Cup Champion Billy Smith of New York Islanders fame, a former member of the Smiths Falls Bears. In 1963, the Montreal Canadiens allowed the Chicago Blackhawks-sponsored Brockville Braves into the league.\n\nIn the late 1960s, the Cornwall Royals applied to enter into what is now the Ontario Hockey League, when they were turned away, they applied to join the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League and were accepted. In 1973, the Hull Festivals, also departed for the QMJHL. In 1975, the Canadian Hockey Association informed the league that they had to allow 20-year-olds into their league, as all other leagues of their calibre already were doing.\n\nIn February 1966, players from the Hawkesbury Braves went on strike over coaching issues. The Braves brought in replacement players from midget and Jr. B leagues for a game against the Cornwall Royals. The Royals went on to win 43–0. It still stands as the highest margin of victory in the league to date.\n\nIn 1976, the late Bryan Murray, former General Manager of the NHL's Ottawa Senators, took over as head coach of the Rockland Nationals. With Murray at the wheel, the Nationals won the leagues, the region, and then went on to win the National Championship as Centennial Cup Champions. The financial cost of the playoff run was too much for the team's backers to handle and they declared bankruptcy one disappointing season after winning it all. The Nationals have resurrected since then as a member of the Eastern Ontario Junior C Hockey League.\n\nAfter the ruling that allowed 20-year-olds to play in the league, teams began attempting to \"buy\" championship teams by going after former Major Junior players. The effect of this resulted in the labeling of the league as a \"goon league\" or \"bush league\" as the league got more violent. The fan base dwindled, and by 1984 there were only 5 teams left in the league, all on the verge of bankruptcy. The owners of the five teams approached the owners of Ottawa's Talisman Hotel and asked them to purchase the league. Through new management and rule changes, the league barred 20-year-olds from the Major Junior ranks, created a limit of five 20-year-olds (homegrown from the CJHL), and banned the paying of players. The new rules worked, and the league was once again successful. The league then approached the Canadian Hockey Association, and requested a new system. After the fall of the Rockland Nationals, the league realized there was a revenue problem amongst its teams. The league demanded longer regular seasons and a shorter National playdown schedule to determine the National Champion. This new system was guaranteed to increase revenue amongst all teams nationwide as they were allowed to have more home games, increasing revenue through ticket sales, and decreased the travel expenditures that forced the Rockland Nationals to fold soon after they won the National Championship.\n\nThe league began flourishing, and by the early 1990s, had more than doubled. Teams that had folded during the \"dark days\" of the late 1970s and early 1980s came back. The league even allowed for the expansion of their first American hockey team, the Massena Americans. Also, now a member of the OHL, the Cornwall Royals moved from Cornwall. In response, the CJHL allowed the Messena Americans to move to Cornwall, hoping the Cornwall Colts could help the city fill its competitive hockey \"void\".\n\nThe Gloucester Rangers hosted the last Centennial Cup tournament in 1995 before it was transformed into the Royal Bank Cup. The Rangers boosted NHL stars like Mathieu Dandenault and Robert Esche. The Gloucester Rangers were seconds away from defeating the Calgary Canucks in the final, until the Canucks scored a last-minute goal and won it all in overtime, to continue the drought of a CJHL team winning the National Junior \"A\" Championship.\n\nIn 2004-05, the Central Junior Hockey League saw higher attendance figures in all arenas with the NHL lockout. All teams in the CJHL had doubled their attendance.\n\nIn April 2007, it was announced that the Kemptville 73's were joining the CJHL as its 11th member team. The 73's formerly played in the Eastern Ontario Junior B Hockey League.\n\nThe Cornwall Colts became the 4th team in CJHL history to play host to a Centennial/Royal Bank Cup tournament in 2008. The Colts managed to qualify for the semi-finals, but were ousted 7–1 by the Humboldt Broncos.\n\nIn 2009, the Carleton Place Canadians, another former EOJBHL team, was announced as the league's 12th franchise. They began play during the 2009–10 season. At the beginning of the 2009–10 season, the league dropped the \"A\" from their name, switching to the Central Junior Hockey League.\n\nIn February 2010, it was announced that the Smiths Falls Memorial Centre – one of the league's oldest facilities and home to the Smiths Falls Bears was staging its final home game of the 2009–10 season. The Bears will be moving into a brand-new multipurpose facility for that fall. The Memorial Centre was demolished to accommodate parking spaces for the new facility.\n\nIn April 2010, the Pembroke Lumber Kings made CJHL history by winning four-consecutive Art Bogart Cup championships, which is now the most-consecutive championships won by a CJHL team, however the Pembroke Lumber Kings qualified for the Fred Page Cup for the fifth consecutive year, but lost the finals to the Brockville Braves, who advanced to the Royal Bank Cup in Dauphin, Manitoba. The 2012 Fred Page Cup was awarded to the Kanata Stallions to commemorate their 25 years of Jr. A hockey in Kanata.\n\nOn April 26, 2010, the league rebranded by changing their league to the Central Hockey League, from the Central Junior Hockey League. A league, by the same name \"Central Hockey League\" already existed, a minor professional league below the ECHL, which was 15 teams throughout the mid-western United States. In January 2011, the league rebranded itself again the Central Canada Hockey League.\n\nOn May 8, 2011, at the 2011 Royal Bank Cup in Camrose, Alberta, the Pembroke Lumber Kings defeated the BCHL's Vernon Vipers 2–0 to win the CCHL's second ever National Title during the league's 50th anniversary season.\n\nPrior to the 2014–15 season, the CCHL announced it was adapting the American Hockey League's overtime format.\n\n\nIn the 2013–14 season, 69 CCHL regular season games were tied after regulation. The outcome of 30 games was determined in the over time session and 39 games required a shoot out.\n\nFor the 2015–16 the CCHL made a significant move to the development model for the league. The Eastern Ontario Junior B Hockey League was aligned directly with the CCHL to establish direct affiliations and specific guidelines for players to move up and down between leagues. The EOJBHL also took on a re-branding to become the Central Canada Hockey League Tier 2. The development model is also to be extended to affiliation with midget (under18) teams.\n\nIn fall 2016, the Gloucester Rangers were sold to new ownership, who will relocate the team to Rockland, Ontario for the 2017-18 season and become the Rockland Nationals. The current Rockland Nationals, who currently play in the National Capital Junior Hockey League are expected to relocate to a nearby community to accommodate junior A hockey in the community for the first time since 1977. The Rockland Nationals expect to develop and renew their geographical rivalry with the Hawkesbury Hawks, and also develop a rivalry with the Cumberland Grads.\n\nDavid Frost, the agent of former St. Louis Blues player Mike Danton, was banned from all Central Junior \"A\" Hockey League games and events in fall 2005 after Frost entered an off-limits-to-fans area at the Jim Durrell Arena, home to the Ottawa Jr. Senators, in which Frost \"accosted, harassed and threatened an official of the CJHL\". League commissioner Mac MacLean stated \"We don't want him around period\". The Lumber Kings were fined $1000 for David Frost's actions, because the league considered Frost to be associated with owner Sheldon Keefe. MacLean sent posters to each league arena to help security staff identify Frost if he were to show up at games, and to refuse entry to Frost. Weeks later, the ban was lifted after Mac MacLean was relieved of his duties of CJHL commissioner. Newly appointed commissioner John Comerford lifted the ban, stating \"We can't stop David Frost from entering the rink and I haven't received any complaints from anybody about him\". League's former vice president, who was fired tried to extend the ban throughout the 2005–06 season. David Frost had no affiliation with the Pembroke Lumber Kings hockey organization. He was allowed to attend league games, but was barred from restricted areas. Frost disregarded the advisement not to entire restricted areas, and was seen getting off the Lumber Kings team bus by \"CBC Fifth Estate\" film crew, and was filmed following the team to dressing room during a playoff game in Nepean. At the end of the season, David Frost severed un-affiliated ties with the league and informed that he would not attend any more league games or events.\n\n\n\n"}

He was the son of a Lutheran pastor; his mother came from a merchant family. Justus-Georg regularly styled himself \"Schottelius\", and this must be regarded as the correct form of his name, though after his death the de-Latinized form \"Schottel\" long persisted in scholarly writings and is still sometimes used.\n\nSurmounting the many upheavals of the Thirty Years' War (1618–48) and the untimely death of his father, Schottelius managed to acquire a good education, notably at the Akademisches Gymnasium in Hamburg and at the universities of Groningen, Leiden, Leipzig and Wittenberg. In 1640 he found employment as tutor to the children of Duke August the Younger of Braunschweig-Lüneburg (1579–1666), including August's heir, Anton Ulrich (1633–1714). Schottelius wrote several plays for his pupils to perform, some with musical accompaniments composed by August's consort, Sophie Elisabeth, or in one case by Heinrich Schütz (1585–1672). In 1646 he married Anna Margarete Eleonore Cleve, but she died the following year. His second wife, whom he married in 1649, was Anna Margarete Sobbe. During the 1640s and 1650s Schottelius rose to prominent administrative positions at court. He also had access to the magnificent ducal library at Wolfenbüttel, and he continued to reside in that town until his death.\n\nSchottelius quickly established himself in the early 1640s as a powerful protagonist of the German language. Admitted in 1642 to the leading patriotic language society, the \"Fruchtbringende Gesellschaft\" or 'Fructifying Society', Schottelius took as his society name \"Der Suchende\" ('The Seeker'), engaging vigorously in its controversies on fundamentals of grammar and lexical purity. In 1645 or 1646 he became a member of the \"Pegnesischer Blumenorden\", headed in Nürnberg by Georg Philipp Harsdörffer (1607–1658) and later Sigmund von Birken (1626–1681). In 1646 he obtained a doctorate in laws at the University of Helmstedt.\n\nThough he also distinguished himself in the fields of poetry, poetic theory and drama, Schottelius is chiefly memorable for his insights and achievements as a linguist. Acting like many of his contemporaries in a spirit of cultural and linguistic patriotism. he sought to raise the lowly status of German, to celebrate its high antiquity, to defend it against latter-day foreign influences, to re-examine it in the light of current linguistic theory, to promote its refinement and use as a communicative medium, and ultimately to inaugurate a new, prestigious epoch in the language. This process was known among contemporaries as \"Spracharbeit\".\n\nFor his début as a language reformer, Schottelius chose a poetic medium. His \"Lamentatio Germaniae exspirantis\" (1640) attacked in stately alexandrines and lurid metaphors the corrupt state of the language, in particular the burgeoning over-use of foreign words. In a dying lament, the once fair nymph Germania presents herself as a grotesque hag. Venerated down the ages, and even meriting the crown of Europe, she now prostitutes herself, begging words from French, Spanish, Italian and English. For all his potent rhetoric, Schottelius's linguistic purism was of a somewhat moderate kind, when compared with his contemporary Philipp von Zesen (1619–1689). But his championship of the German language was without equal.\n\nSchottelius's \"magnum opus\", his \"Ausführliche Arbeit Von der Teutschen HaubtSprache\", appeared in 1663. Running to over 1,500 pages, it incorporated substantial amounts of material that had appeared earlier, notably in his \"Teutsche Sprachkunst\" of 1641. Aimed at a learned, international readership, with much use of Latin alongside German, the \"Ausführliche Arbeit\" is a compendium of remarkable range and depth. Combining many discourse traditions, it embraces language history, orthography, accidence, word-formation, idioms, proverbs, syntax, versification, onomastics and other features, including a dictionary of more than 10,000 German root-words . Heading the work (pp. 1–170) are ten so-called eulogies (\"Lobreden\"): these are massively documented, programmatic statements characterising many aspects of the German language, past and present, and claiming for it the status of a 'cardinal' language (\"Hauptsprache\") alongside Latin, Greek and Hebrew. One key argument here was the German language's rich lexical productivity, its ability to combine root-words (\"Wurtzeln, Stammwörter\", mostly monosyllabic) and affixes (\"Hauptendungen\") in ways which gave it unique and infinite powers of expression. To depict nature in all her variety, it had, for example, the means to name hundreds of different colours, as Schottelius showed in some detail.\n\nSeeking to demonstrate that the German language had a rational basis, Schottelius based his grammar partly on the Classical principle of analogy, identifying (and sometimes even artificially creating) patterns of regularity or similarity in spelling and grammatical inflection. But as a grammarian he also acknowledged countless anomalies or irregularities in the language, and he respected written usage in what he regarded as its most exemplary forms. In the 17th century, German was still in the long and difficult process of becoming standardized or codified. Influential here was Schottelius's own conception of High German as a language transcending the many dialects, and as currently used in writing by 'learned, wise and experienced men' (\"viri docti, sapientes et periti\"). Schottelius argued distinctively that this idealized, supra-regional form of German could not be acquired spontaneously, and certainly not from speech: it had to be 'learnt through much diligence and toil' (\"durch viel Fleis und Arbeit ... erlernet\").\n\nSchottelius’s truly 'comprehensive' work dominated the German linguistic field until Johann Christoph Gottsched (1700-1766), whose authoritative grammars appeared from 1748 onwards. Schottelius's wider legacy has been variously assessed, but it lies mainly in the development of linguistic ideas, with measurable influences to be found in early grammars of Danish, Dutch, Swedish and Russian, and in theoretical writings on these and other languages.\n\n\n\n\n"}

They are evergreen or herbaceous perennial tufted grasses with a height range of and a cosmopolitan distribution, occurring on every continent except Antarctica. The genus is closely related to ryegrass (\"Lolium\"), and recent evidence from phylogenetic studies using DNA sequencing of plant mitochondrial DNA shows that the genus lacks monophyly. As a result, plant taxonomists have moved several species, including the forage grasses tall fescue and meadow fescue, from the genus \"Festuca\" into the genus \"Lolium\", or alternatively into the segregate genus \"Schedonorus\".\n\nBecause the taxonomy is complex, scientists have not determined how many true species belong to the genus, but estimates range from more than 400 to over 500.\n\nFescue pollen is a significant contributor to hay fever.\n\nThe genus \"Festuca\" represents a major evolutionary line of the tribe Poeae. The ancient group has produced various segregates that possess more advanced characteristics than \"Festuca\", including racemose inflorescences and more annual habits.\n\nThe word \"\"festuca\"\" is a Latin word meaning \"stem\" or \"stalk\" first used by Pliny the Elder to describe a weed. The word \"Festuca\" first appears to describe grasses in Dodoens' \"Stirpium historiae pemptades sex, sive libri XXX\" in 1583. However, the plant Dodoens described as \"Festuca altera\" is truly \"Bromus secalinus\". Other authors before Linnaeus used the name to describe other various species of \"Bromus\". In the first edition of \"Genera Plantarum\", Linnaeus describes seven species of \"Festuca\", five of which are truly \"Bromus\" grasses with the other two being \"Festuca gigantea\" and \"Festuca pratensis\". In 1753 the genus is accepted as first being formally described, in Linnaeus' \"Species Plantarum\". Eleven species were described, with \"F. ovina\" being the type species. Of these eleven, one species was \"Danthonia\", one \"Poa\", and one \"Koeleria\". The first major monograph on the genus was Hackel's \"Monographia Festucarum Europaearum\" in 1882. Since Linnaeus' publications, seven genera have been proposed for groups of perennial fescues and fifteen for annual fescues, all with varying degrees of acceptance. For example, in 1906 the subgenus \"Vulpia\" was introduced for North American species. The annual habit and shorter anthers of \"Vulpia\" has since been enough to distinguish \"Vulpia\" as a separate genus from \"Festuca\".\n\nThe taxonomy of the genus is ultimately problematic and controversial, as evidenced by the large number of small genera closely related to \"Festuca\". Often distinguishing species within the genus requires the analysis of highly specific morphological differences on characters such as ovary pubescence or leaf sclerenchyma patterns. This distribution of sclerenchyma tissue is an important distinguishing character between species, and though species can be locally distinguished without analyzing these characteristics, to distinguish the genus as a whole the analysis is necessary.\n\n\"Festuca\" grasses are perennial and bisexual plants that are densely to loosely cespitose. The some grasses are rhizomatous and some lack rhizomes, and rarely species are stoloniferous. The culms of the grasses are typically glabrous and smooth, though some species have scabrous culms or culms that are pubescent below the inflorescences. The leaf sheaths range from open to the base to closed to the top. Some species have sheaths that persist over years and typically have deciduous blades, and some species have sheaths that quickly shred into fibers and decay in senescence and typically have blades that are not deciduous. Species lack auricles. The membranous ligules measure and are typically longest at the margins. The ligules are typically truncate and ciliate, though they can occasionally be acute or erose. The flat and conduplicate leaf blades are involute or convolute and are sometimes glaucous or pruinose. The abaxial surfaces of leaf blades are glabrous or scabrous and occasionally pubescent or puberulent. The adaxial surfaces of leaf blades are typically scabrous, though occasionally are hirsute or puberulent. The abaxial sclerenchyma tissue forms longitudinal strands that vary in presence from the margins and opposite of the midvein to adjacent to some or every lateral vein. These longitudinal strands occasionally merge into interrupted or continuous bands. Bands of confluent strands that reach veins are known as \"pillars\". The adaxial sclerenchyma tissue sometimes forms strands that are opposite or extend to epidermal veins. Some strands form \"girders\" together with the abaxial sclerenchyma tissue that connect epidermides at some or all veins.\n\nThe inflorescences of species are open or contracted panicles, occasionally racemes, with one to two (rarely three) branches at their lower node. The branches are erect and begin to spread during anthesis, and occasionally lower branches are reflexed. The spikelets have two to twelve mostly bisexual florets. The rachillas are typically either scabrous or pubescent, but can occasionally be smooth and glabrous. The subequal or unequal glumes are ovate to lanceolate, acute to acuminate, and are typically exceeded by the florets. The lower glumes are as long or shorter than their adjacent lemmas and have one (rarely two or three) veins, and the upper glumes have three (rarely four or five) veins. The calli are typically glabrous and smooth, but can be occasionally scabrous or rarely pubescent. The chartaceous or sometimes coriaceous lemmas have somewhat dorsally rounded and distally keeled bases. The lemmas typically have five (rarely six or seven) veins. The lemmas have acute to attenuate apices that are occasionally doubly pointed, and terminal awns or mucros. The bidentate paleas are shorter to longer than the lemmas, with scabrous-ciliate veins. The regions between the veins are smooth and glabrous near the base of the paleas and become scabrous or puberulent distally. All grasses have three anthers. The ovaries are glabrous with occasionally hispidulous apices on which hairs persist when ovaries become caryopses. The oblong caryopses have adaxial grooves. The linear hila vary in length from half as long to as long as the caryopses.\n\nSome fescues are used as ornamental and turf grasses and as pasture and hay for livestock, being a highly nutritious stock feed. \"Festuca rubra\" and \"F. rubra\" subsp. \"commutata\" are used as lawn grasses, and these species, \"F. arundinacea\", and \"F. trachyphylla\" are used in parks, deforested areas, and sports fields for land stabilization. \"F. saximontana\" and \"F. idahoensis\" are used as rangeland grasses for livestock, and fescues often provide good forage for native wildlife. \"F. ovina\" and its various subspecies are the most important grazing fescues for North America, and \"F. arundinacea\" is one of the most important hay and pasture grasses in Europe. Fescue is easily established on bare ground, outcompeting other plants and persisting over several years, and so is often used in soil erosion control programs. Tall fescue (\"F. arundinacea\") is good for this purpose, and one cultivar, 'Kentucky 31', was used in land reclamation during the Dust Bowl of the 1930s in the US. Fescues have been used as building material, as rope and as a variety of other things in indigenous Ethiopian communities, in particular the Guassa Community Conservation Area where it is referred to as 'Guassa Grass'. The grasses \"F. amethystina\", \"F. cinerea\", \"F. elegans\", \"F. glauca\", and \"F. pallens\" are all grown as ornamentals.\n\nFescue is sometimes used as feed for horses. However, fescue poisoning, caused by ergot alkaloids produced by the endophytic fungus \"Epichloë coenophiala\", is a risk for pregnant mares. During the last three months of pregnancy fescue poisoning increases the risk of spontaneous abortion, stillbirths, retained placenta, absent milk production, and prolonged pregnancy. Incorporating legumes into the fescue can be a way to increase livestock gains and conception rates, even if the fescue is infected.\n\nSpecies include:\n\n\n"}

Paseo Colorado is just east of and connected by a pedestrian bridge, the Garfield Promenade, to Old Town Pasadena, and west of the center of downtown. The mall is located across Green Street from the Pasadena Civic Auditorium in the Pasadena Conference Center. As of 2014, the mall is currently without an anchor retail chain stores since both Macy's and a Gelson's Markets had closed in 2013.\n\nThe site was originally occupied by a shopping mall called Plaza Pasadena, which opened in 1980 and featured three anchor stores: J.C. Penney, The Broadway, and May Company California. It was built by The Hahn Company at a cost of $115 million on an 11-acre site and had featured over 120 stores. The development was designed by Charles Kober & Associates and the resulting design was awarded a Progressive Architecture Magazine Design Award in 1979.\n\nThis mall did not live up to expectations. May Company closed its store there in 1989, and the space was divided among smaller stores.\n\nIn 1998, following the conversion of the Broadway store to Macy's and the closure of J.C. Penney, the developers announced plans to tear down the mall and replace it with an outdoor center.\n\nPaseo Colorado opened in September 2001, retaining the Macy's store from the original development and added a supermarket and movie theater complex. Two years later, the outdoor center was sold to Developers Diversified Realty Corp. for $114 million.\n\nIn November 2010, the Paseo Colorado saw the opening of Noor, a 16,000 sq ft event space featuring state-of-the-art audio/visual and lighting and seating for up to 350 guests for banquets in its large ballroom, the Sofia, and 140 guests for banquets in its smaller ballroom, the Ella.\n\nOn January 3, 2013, Macy's announced their store at Paseo Colorado would close in early spring 2013. At the time of the store closure, there were plans to demolish the Macy's building and replace it with a multi-story hotel.\n\nIn March 2013, Gelson's announced that they would close their store at Paseo Colorado on July 21, 2013. This store had been at this location since Paseo Colorado first opened 12 years prior.\n\nBy late 2014, the mall was in the process of obtaining the necessary local governmental licenses to replace the vacant Macy's Department Store with a Hyatt Place hotel and mixed-use condominium complex. After obtaining the necessary permits, DDR began the demolition process in August 2015.\n\nIn January 2016, DDR sold the retail development to Cypress Equities of Dallas.\n\nIt was renamed The Paseo in 2017.\n"}

The first sale of agriculture produce can occur only at the market yards (mandis) of APMC. \n\nThe concept of agriculture produce market regulation programme in India dates back to British period as raw cotton was the first farm produce to attract the attention of the Government due to anxiety of British rulers to make available the supplies of pure cotton at reasonable prices to the textile mills of Manchester (UK). Consequently, first regulated market (Karanja) under Hyderabad Residency Order was established in 1886 in the Country and the first legislation was the Berar Cotton and Grain Market Act of 1887, which empowered British Resident to declare any place in the assigned district a market for sale and purchase of agricultural produce and constitute a committee to supervise the regulated markets. This Act became the model for enactment in other parts of the country. An important landmark in the agricultural marketing scene in the country has been the recommendation of the Royal Commission on Agriculture, 1928 for regulation of marketing practices and establishment of regulated markets. One of the measures taken to improve the situation was to regulate the trade practices and to establish market yards in the countryside. In pursuance, Government of India prepared a Model Bill in 1938 and circulated to all the States but not much headway was made till independence. Later, most of the States enacted Agricultural Produce Markets Regulation (APMR) Acts during sixties and seventies and put these in operation. All primary wholesale assembling markets were brought under the ambit of these Acts. Well laid out market yards and sub-yards were constructed and for each market area, an Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) was constituted to frame the rules and enforce them. Thus, the organized agricultural marketing came into existence through regulated markets.\nPrior to independence, the major concern of the Government policy related to agricultural marketing was to keep the prices of food for the consumers and agro-raw materials for the industry in check. However, after independence, the need to protect the interest of farmers and to provide them incentive prices to augment the production of agricultural commodities was also felt. Further, problems of local money lenders extorting high amounts of foodgrains from the farmer, at throwaway prices, as interest were common throughout the country. Recognizing the defects like losses to the farmers in terms of undue low prices, higher costs of marketing and considerable physical losses of the produce in the agricultural marketing system which the farmers had to face, the Government, with a view to establishing a mechanism to monitor the market conduct, introduced from time to time several mandatory regulations. Regulation and development of primary agricultural produce markets was taken up as an institutional innovation and construction of well laid out market yards was considered as an essential requirement for regulating the practices in primary wholesale markets.\n\nAPMCs operate on two principles:\n\nEach state which operates APMC markets geographically divide the state. Markets (mandis) are established at different places within the state. Farmers are required to sell their produce via auction at the mandi in their region. Traders require a license to operate within a mandi. Wholesale and retail traders (e.g. shopping mall owners) and food processing companies cannot buy produce directly from a farmer.\n\nSome of the salient features of the APMC Model Act 2003 are as follows\n\n1) Facilitates contract farming model.\n\n2) Special market for perishables.\n\n3) Farmers, private persons can set up own market.\n\n4) Licensing norms relaxed.\n\n5) Single market fee.\n\n6) APMC revenue to be used for improving market infrastructure.\n\nHowever, not all states have passed the bill. Some states have passed but neither framed rules nor notified it. Thus, inter-state barriers continue. Further, Union Budget 2015 proposed to create United National Agriculture Market with the help of State Government and NITI Ayog.\n\nThe state government has taken several initiatives so that farmers may get a better price for their produce.\n\nThe state government of Karnataka has created APMCs in many towns to enable farmers to sell their produce at reasonable prices. Most APMCs have a market where traders and other marketing agents are provided stalls and shops to purchase agriculture produce from farmers. Farmers can sell their produce to agents or traders under the supervision of the APMC.\n\nFarmers cannot sell produce outside the APMC mechanism. However, the government is now encouraging direct selling through 'Rythu Bazar' or to supermarkets directly. The present APMC system makes farmers vulnerable to traders' and marketing agents' price manipulations. The Government of India is considering improving the APMC Act to benefit all parties involved.\n\nThe Maharashtra State Agricultural Marketing Board runs 295 APMCs in Maharashtra, under the APMC Act enacted by the Government of India. In July, 2016, the Maharashtra State Government removed fruits and vegetables from the purview of the APMCs. The state government has urged the farmers to directly bring their produce for sale in Mumbai. Of the 307 APMCs in the state, 219 are operating, The government has granted 148 Direct Marketing Licenses of which 91 are for fruits and vegetables. The Pune APMC, meanwhile, appealed to the farmers from the state as well as from outside to bring their produce to the market and sell those directly..\n\nIn Tamil Nadu, the Tamil Nadu State Agricultural Marketing Board is the regulatory board for agricultural markets which is successfully running since 1977. 21 Market committees are established for every notified area and 277 Regulated Markets are functioning under these committees for better regulation of buying and selling of agricultural produce.\n\nThe Andhra Pradesh (Agricultural Produce and Livestock) Markets act G.O (Government Order) was passed in the eyear 1966 and rules were amended in the year 1969.\n\nThere are many problems faced by farmers due to the restrictions imposed by the APMC Act. Even after receiving the produce, like some traders delay payment to farmers for weeks or months. If payment is made at the time of sale, then the trader may arbitrarily deduct some amount, on the excuse that he has not received payments from the other parties. To avoid tax, some traders do not give sale slips to farmers. As a result, it is difficult for the farmer to prove his income to get loans from banks. On average, the farmer is able to receive barely 25% to 33% of the final retail price. Middlemen receive a double commission (both from seller and buyer), thus making consumers pay for this spread. Also middlemen do not pass the benefit to either side. During peak seasons, when they buy from farmers at low prices, they do not drastically reduce the prices to final consumers. Conversely, during lean seasons, when consumer prices are high, the farmers do not get higher returns on their produce.\n\nFurther, since these APMCs markets are often in districts, some farmers cannot afford to take their produce to faraway APMC markets both in terms of time as well as the cost of transport. As such, they often sell their produce at a cheap price closer to their growing areas. Additionally, though the mandis charge multiple entry, exit, and other fees, the infrastructure remains poor, with a lack of cold-storage and transport facilities. \n\n\n"}

The existence of stable [PNP] cluster calls into question models of the atomic nucleus that restrict nucleon interactions within shells to 2-body phenomenon.

{"id": "1962680", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1962680", "title": "Andalusian cadence", "text": "Andalusian cadence\n\nThe Andalusian cadence (diatonic phrygian tetrachord) is a term adopted from flamenco music for a chord progression comprising four chords descending stepwise—a vi–V–IV–III progression with respect to the major mode or i–VII–VI–V progression with respect to the minor mode. It is otherwise known as the minor descending tetrachord. Traceable back to the Renaissance, its effective sonorities made it one of the most popular progressions in classical music .\n\nDespite the name it is not a true cadence (i.e., occurring only once, when ending a phrase, section, or piece of music); it is most often used as an ostinato (repeating over and over again). It is heard in rock songs such as \"Runaway\" by Del Shannon.\n\nThe Andalusian cadence may be notated vi – V – IV – III with respect to a major key; i – VII – VI – V with respect to a natural or melodic minor key, the two being identical in descent; or i – VII – VI – V with respect to a harmonic minor key, in which the reversal of the raising of the subtonic (VII) to a leading tone (which would be notated in non-harmonic minor keys as VII) must be notated. In the third degree of the final chord (III or V, depending on key signature), the subtonic is sharpened by a semitone into a leading note in order to lead back into the minor chord that begins the sequence.\n\nA popular melodic pattern of Ancient Greece offers a possible starting point for the Andalusian cadence. Called the \"Dorian tetrachord\", the sequence resembles the bass line of the chord progression developed centuries later. Some theorists consider that the same structure may have occurred earlier in Judah. A sequence more or less close to the Greek tetrachord structure might have been known to the Moors in Southern Spain and spread from there through Western Europe. The French troubadours were influenced by the Spanish music.\n\nThe Andalusian cadence known today, using triads, may not have occurred earlier than the Renaissance, though the use of parallel thirds or sixths was evident as early as the 13th century. One of the earliest uses of this chord sequence is seen in Claudio Monteverdi's choral work, \"Lamento della Ninfa\". The piece begins in A minor and clearly uses the cadence pattern as a basso ostinato - resulting in Amin - Emin - Fmaj - E7. This work was first published in the Eighth Book of Madrigals (1638).\n\nThe progression resembles the first four measures of the 15th century Passamezzo antico; i – ♭VII – i – V. The use of the ♭VI chord may suggest a more recent origin than the Passamezzo antico since the cadences i – ♭VII and ♭VII – i were popular in the late Middle Ages and early Renaissance, \"(see also double tonic)\" while ♭VII – ♭VI arose as a result of advancement in music theory. However, the absence of the leading tone from the ♭VII chord suggests that the progression originated before the tonal system in the modal approach of the time of Palestrina, where the tonic must be approached from chord V whereas typical Baroque style would have avoided the flat VII and introduced dominant chords (♮VII or V chords, to form cadences resolving upon a i chord).\n\nA minor seventh would be added to the dominant \"V\" chord to increase tension before resolution (V-i). The roots of the chords belong to a modern phrygian tetrachord (the equivalent of a Greek Dorian tetrachord, the latter mentioned above), that is to be found as the upper tetrachord of a natural minor scale (for A minor, they are: A G F E).\n\nA remarkable fact about tetrachords was noticed since the Ancient times and rediscovered in early Renaissance: when a tetrachord features a semitone (half-step) between two of its tones, it is the semitone that will determine the melodic tendency of the given tetrachord or mode (when combining tetrachords). If the semitone falls between the highest two steps, the melody tends to be ascending (e.g. major scales); a semitone between the lowest tones in the tetrachord involves a melody \"inclined\" to descend. This said, the Phrygian tetrachord, borrowed from traditional music of Eastern Europe and Anatolia, is to be found also in the Andalusian cadence and sets the mentioned character (the semitone falls between [the roots of] V and VI).\n\nA rigorous analysis should note that many chord progressions are likely to date back from an epoch prior to early Baroque (usually associated with birth of tonality). In such cases (also, that of the Andalusian cadence), explanations offered by tonality \"neglect\" the history and evolution of the chord progression in question. This is because harmonic analyses in tonal style use only two scales (major and minor) when explaining origins of chord moves. In exchange, the luxuriant \"modal system\" (i.e., the entirety of musical modes ever created and their specific harmonies – if existing) offers various plausible origins and explanations for every chord move. However, most classical (Baroque or subsequent) and popular music which makes use of the given chord progression might treat it itself in a tonal manner.\n\nA number of musicians and theorists (including renowned guitarist Manolo Sanlúcar) consider the Andalusian cadence as a chord progression built upon the Phrygian mode. Since tonality took the first chord in the progression for a tonic (\"i\"), the Phrygian notation (modal) of the cadence writes as following: iv – III – II – I (or, more commonly, but less correctly, iv – III – II – I). Though tonal functions have little in common with the Phrygian mode, the four chords could be roughly equalized. (The Phrygian mode is like a natural minor with step two lowered; however, step three switches between major and minor third, an equivalent to the subtonic/leading tone conflict in the tonal acceptation.) Thus, the \"iv\" corresponds to a subdominant chord, while \"III\" is the mediant and \"I\" is the tonic. The \"II\" chord has a dominant function, and may be thought of as a tritone substitution of \"V\", i.e., the Neapolitan sixth chord. (The only purpose for highlighting these \"functions\" is to compare between the modal and tonal views of the cadence. The mode involved in the cadence is not a pure Phrygian, but one whose third step occurs in both instances, minor and major third. This is unacceptable in tonality; hence, tonal functions cannot be used. A common mistake occurs when the given mode is thought of as major, given that the tonic chord is major. However, the Phrygian mode features a minor third and the \"I\" chord may be taken for a borrowed chord, i.e., a Picardy third.)\n\nWhen the VI chord, which may be added between III and II (iv-III-VI-II-I) and cadenced upon, is the most characteristic contrasting tonal area, similar by analogy to the relative major of a minor key.\n\nAnother modification gives the progression a more characteristically modal sound by simply replacing the VII with a vii chord. This alters the progression slightly; Amin – Gmin – Fmaj – E7. It can be found in “Chanela”, by DiMeola / McLaughlin / De Lucia. Although this example is in the key of B minor, the applied principle is the same.\n\nThe tonal system sets three main functions for the diatonic tertian chords: tonic (T), dominant (D) and subdominant (SD). Any sequence through different functions is allowed (e.g. T→D, SD→D), except for D→SD. A tonal scale's degrees are as following: \"I\" and \"VI\" are tonic chords (of which, \"I\" is stronger; all final cadences end in \"I\"), \"V\" and \"VII\" are dominants (both feature the leading tone and \"V\" is more potent), \"IV\" and \"II\" are subdominant chords (\"IV\" is stronger). (\"III\" isn't given a precise function, although it may replace a dominant in some cases.) All sequences between same-function chords, from the weaker member to the stronger (e.g. VII – V), are forbidden. When using the natural minor, dominant chords exchange their leading tone for a subtonic; as a result, their dominant quality is strongly undermined.\n\nA tonal insight on the Andalusian cadence leads to considering the \"VII\" a local exception: the subtonic it uses for a root should be, however, re-replaced by the leading tone before returning to \"i\". (The leading tone is heard in the \"V\" chord, as the chord's major third.) A \"VII\" would leave the dominant category (compare: \"VII\") and start acting to the contrary. That is, a \"VII\" chord would now prefer moving to a subdominant rather than to a tonic chord. Yet, the Andalusian cadence brings about a limit condition for tonal harmony, with a VII – VI chord move.\n\nThe Andalusian is an authentic cadence, because a dominant chord (\"V\") comes just before the tonic \"i\". (Using modal harmonies, the third, and not the fourth chord – \"II\" – acts as the dominant, substituted to tritone. Even so, the cadence stays authentic. The fourth chord itself is the tonic, so the cadence need not return to the tonal tonic, i.e. modal \"iv\".)\n\nA most unusual way of altering the cadence can be heard in Pink Floyd's \"Comfortably Numb\" (1979), where the \"V\" chord is skipped for a \"iv\". It is as follows: i – ♭VII – ♭VI (– ♭VI) – iv (and back to \"i\"). The resulting progression is on the edge between tonal and modal, where the subtonic doesn't change back into a leading-tone, but the obtained cadence is suitable for tonality (called plagal or backdoor).\n\nThe standard tuning in guitars causes most flamenco music to be played only in a few keys. Of those, the most popular are A minor and D minor (equivalent to E and A Phrygian, respectively). They are as follows: \n\nUsing a capotasto or scordature, other keys can be obtained, mainly derived from the two basic keys. Flamenco guitarist Ramon Montoya and singer Antonio Chacón were among the first to use the new keys, which have distinctive names:\n\nSongs of the early 1960s, such as the Ventures' 1960 hit \"Walk, Don't Run\", used the bass structure from the iconic Andalusian cadence for a surf rock hit; however, the first chord is A Major not A minor as is a common misconception about the song. Other notable examples from popular music are \"Stray Cat Strut\", \"All Along the Watchtower\", \"Like a Hurricane\" \"Happy Together and \"California Dreamin\".\n\nThe Andalusian cadence is featured in the chorus of Michael Jackson's \"Smooth Criminal,\" and it also builds the basis for the middle section in Paco de Lucía's signature track, “Entre dos Aguas,” where this progression is played in the key of E minor.\n\nIn addition, the I-♭VII-♭VI-V chord progression is the primary structure of \"Hit the Road Jack.\"\n\n\n\n\nThe integration of the traditional Andalusian cadence and Renaissance-style practices of musical composition and song are evident in modern musical genres such as rock and pop. Flamenco music, a style of music and dance that was popularized in the Andalusian regions of Spain, has also been incorporated into modern pop and rock music. Specific examples include the usage of the cadence in \"La leyenda del tiempo\" by Camarón de la Isla. Other recent uses of the cadence are apparent in flamenco inspired rock songs such as \"Ya no me asomo de la reja\", 'La que vive en la Carrera\", and the bassline of \"Negras las intenciones\".\n\n\n\n"}

It was founded on 20 September 1909 with 10 students on its original site at Lagos Island, adjacent to Tafawa Balewa Square. The school admits only male students although historically some female HSC (A-Level equivalent) students were admitted before the establishment of Queen's College Lagos, popularly known as King's College's sister school. King's College conducts exams for the West African School-Leaving Certificate and the National Examinations Council.\n\nIn 1908, the Nigerian Acting Director of Education in Lagos, Henry Rawlingson Carr advised Governor Walter Egerton on a detailed scheme of education in Lagos. Carr's suggestions and proposals were the basis for the formation of King's College. Carr convinced the London Board of Education that King's College's education mission would not overlap but supplement the education initiatives of missionary societies. As a result, some authors regard Henry Carr as the \"architect of King's College\". On 20 September 1909 King’s School (as it was then called) came into being. There were 10 pioneer students which included J.C. Vaughan, Isaac Ladipo Oluwole, Frank Macaulay, Herbert Mills (from the Gold Coast), O.A. Omololu and Moses King. Oluwole was the first senior prefect of the school. The school building was erected and furnished at a cost of £10,001. It consists of a hall to accommodate 300 students, 8 lecture rooms, a chemical laboratory and an office.\n\nThe philosophy of King’s School was \n“to provide for the youth of the colony a higher general education than that supplied by the existing Schools, to prepare them for Matriculation Examination of the University of London and to give a useful course of Study to those who intend to qualify for Professional life or to enter Government or Mercantile service.”\n\nThe staff of the college consists of three Europeans (a principal who gives instruction in English Language, Literature and Latin, a Mathematical and Science Master) with two African assistant teachers. Occasionally, members of the Education Department were engaged as lectures of the evening classes.\n\nThe government awarded three scholarships and three exhibitions annually based on merit. The beneficiaries of the scholarships are entitled to free tuition and a government grant of 6 pounds per annum. Conversely, holders of exhibitions receive free tuition; only Hussey Charity Exhibitions tenable at the college was established for indigent students out of the investment proceeds of the premises of the defunct Hussey Charity.\n\nThe average attendance of students as at the end of 1910 was 16. This rose to 67 as at the end of 1914.\n\nIn 1926, \"The Development of the Education Department, 1882–1925\" was published. Chapter 1, \"Annual Report on the Education Development, Southern Provinces, Nigeria, for the year 1926\" unearthed interesting facts about the school.\n\nIt reads, in part, \"…1909 is chiefly noticeable for the opening of King’s College as a Government Secondary School under the headmastership of a Mr. Lomax who was seconded from the Survey Department, and who was assisted by two European Masters. The number of boys on the roll was 11. In 1909, Mr. Hyde-Johnson was appointed headmaster of King’s College, but nine months later, he succeeded Mr. Rowden as Director of Education…..\"\n\nThat the first headmaster of the college was Mr. Lomax is an outstanding revelation, outstanding because the general conception has always been that Mr. Hyde-Johnson who held that position. Until 1954 when the first edition of the brief history of the college was written, the popular myth was that Mr. Hyde-Johnson was the first principal of King’s College. Except for the few surviving foundation students, there was hardly any Old Boy who had ever heard of Mr. Lomax; this pioneer’s name was curiously sunk in obscurity.\n\nAn insight into life at K.C. in its early years is provided by F.S. Scruby’s article dated 24 February 1924 in the \"Mermaid\" titled “Further Glimpse of the Past”:\n\nThere are four houses in the school named after former principals. Hyde-Johnson's House (red), Panes' House (blue), Mckee-Wright's House (yellow) and Harman's House (green). It has ten arms per class (as of the 2017- 2018 session), They are A, Alpha, C, D, E, F, G, H , J and K. King's College Lagos makes use of the Greek letter Alpha instead of the letter B as the second arm of their classes.\n\nDue to population constraints, the school was divided into two campuses, with the senior school moving into the premises of the former Federal School for Arts and Sciences (F.S.A.S) on Victoria Island. (The school administration was still under the control of one principal and ultimately under the control of the Federal Ministry of Education.) This meant that the senior classes of the school (classes 1–3) were now in the Victoria Island \"Annex,\" as that campus came to be known.\n\nPresently, King's College, Lagos has junior school. The seniors are now split as follows: SS1 to SS3 boys are found in the Main Camp (Tafawa Balewa Square), while JSS1 to JSS2 boys are found in the annex campus (Victoria Island) The former PKC, Otunba 'Dele Olapeju, assumed office in January, 2010 and bowed out of service in November, 2015. He moved the senior students from the annex to the main campus. Today, King's College is wearing a new look. He has erected a number of structures both at the main campus and at the annex campus. The students' results are now online, with parents and guardians being able to follow up on their children/wards' academic and extra-curricular activities using the students' log-in details which have been given to them.\n\nAs at the 2014–2015 session, King's College Lagos had 45 prefect positions.\n\nKing's College Lagos has proved its educational quality for centuries and has passed the test of time. Unproven information reports that King's College Lagos performed at a 90% success rate in May/June 2015 WASSCE. Socially, KC proves to be one of the best, as yearly activities such as the inter-house sports competition, the annual bi-lateral games with Achimota School Ghana, and the King's College/Queen's College Graduation ball for outgoing SS3 students have become prominent social events in King's College.\n\nThe annual KIGS cup is an important sporting event. It is an elite quadrangular cricket tournament with four schools participating - King's College, Igbobi College, Government College Ibadan and St. Gregory's College.\n\nThe annual Ikoyi Run is also one of King's College's major sporting event. Ikoyi Run is a marathon with the four houses competing.\n\nThere is also an annual inter-house athletics competition with the four houses competing.\n\nThe school uniform consists of a white shirt (long-sleeved for those in the senior school and short-sleeved for those in the junior school), a school tie and/or a school badge, white trousers, black belt, socks and black laced shoes and a blue blazer. The wearing of the blazer became compulsory with Mr. Onoja, and this has made the school look more inviting to the general public.\n\nThe first principal of the school was a Sir Lomax, while the first African principal was Rex Akpofure. The current principal of the school is Ali Andrew Agada. Some other principals were:\n\n\n"}

The 35lb weight throw (men) and 20lb weight throw (women) are not recognised by the International Association of Athletics Federations.\n\nThe Scottish Highland Games contain two weight throwing events. In the one event the weight, 28lb or 56lb, is thrown in a similar manner to a discus. In the other event, the 56lb weight gets thrown over a bar for height.\n\nThe 56-pound weight throw was conducted twice at the Olympic Games, in 1904 and in 1920.\n\n\n\n\nThe event, held outdoors and indoors, it is a World Championship and world record event in World Masters Athletics. Outdoors, it is also the final event of the Throws pentathlon. Masters athletics has different weight specifications for different age groups.\n\nThe weight throw is an indoor track and field event, predominately in North America. The technique implemented to throw the weight is similar to that of the hammer throw in outdoor competition. In international competition, the men's weight is a 35 lb ball (25 for high school) with a D-ring or triangle handle attached directly to the weight. The technique in wide use is to start in a throwing circle with the thrower's back to the landing area. The weight is then swung overhead to gain momentum before transitioning into the spinning position. The thrower then turns heel to toe up to four times across the ring and toward the front of the circle. At the front of the circle, the thrower releases the weight over his/her shoulder and into the landing area. The landing area is a sector of 34.92° which is identical to the Hammer throw, Discus throw and Shot Put. Because of the demands of the landing area, USATF rules allow for the event as part of an indoor meet to be held outdoors. The world record for men is 25.41 m (outdoor) and 25.86 m (84'10\") (indoor) and is held by American Lance Deal. For women, who throw a weight of 20 lb, the world record is 24.57 m (80'07½\") (outdoor) set by Brittany Riley of Southern Illinois University on 27 January 2007 and 25.60 m (indoor), by Gwen Berry, on 4 March 2017.\n\nThe weight throw event has had an enduring history in American track and field. It was a national championship event for men outdoors from 1878 to 1965. Despite the decline of such outdoor contests in the United States, the event has been a mainstay of the USA Indoor Track and Field Championships: the men's 35 lb event has been held from 1932 to present and a women's 20 lb weight throw event was introduced in 1991. The weight throw is also present on the event programme of the NCAA Men's and NCAA Women's Indoor Track and Field Championships.\n\nThe Superweight Throw uses implements similar in construction to the regular weight throw but with heavier implements. The event was part of two Olympic Games in 1904 and 1920. Though no longer officially sanctioned by the IAAF, it still is contested as a novelty event at various competitions, including the USATF Master's Indoor Championship.\n\nIn the Highland Games, the weight throw consists of two separate events, the light weight and the heavy weight. In both cases, the implement consists of a steel or lead weight (usually spherical or cylindrical) attached by a short chain to a metal handle. The handle may be a d-ring, a triangle or a ring. The size of the weight depends on the class of the competition.\n\nFor advanced male athletes, the light weight is 28 lb, or two stone (12.7 kg). The heavy weight is 56 lb, or four stone (25.4 kg). For all female athletes, the weights are 14 and 28 lb (6.35 and 12.7 kg). For male master class or senior athletes, the weights are 28 and 42 lb (12.7 and 19.05 kg).\n\nThe weight is thrown one-handed from a rectangular (4.5 feet by 9 feet) area behind a toe board or trig. The athlete must stay behind the trig at all times during the throw. The techniques vary, but usually involve a turning or spinning motion to increase momentum before the release. Each athlete gets three attempts, with places determined by the best throw.\n\n\nThe weight over the bar, or weight throw for height, is contested at highland games in Scotland and elsewhere, and at track and field events in Ireland.\n\nThe weight is thrown one-handed over a bar set at increasing heights above the thrower. Similar to the high jump or pole vault, the thrower has three attempts for each successive height. Places are determined by maximum height reached with the fewest misses.\n\nThe size of the weight varies with the competition class. Advanced male athletes throw a 25 kg (56 lb. or four stone) weight, female athletes throw a 12 kg (28 lb.) weight and male master class or senior athletes throw a 19 kg (42 lb). weight. There are two techniques for this event. The classic technique swings the weight between the legs before pulling the weight up and directly overhead. The alternate technique (which is not allowed in some games) involves a spinning motion, with the athlete throwing from the side.\n\nAthletics Ireland recognises the weight throw for height and distance. The weight is 56 lbs at senior level, and 35 lbs in underage level. It is mainly a men's event, though women's weight throw for distance is contested at university level. The height event proceeds in a manner similar to the high jump and pole vault, with throwers required to clear a bar progressively raised. The Irish records are:\n\nIn Ireland, a 56 lb weight is used for both height and distance weight throw events.\n"}

The election was held on 14 July 2005.\n\nThe Liberal Democrat candidate succeeding Calton was Stockport council leader Mark Hunter. The Conservative candidate was Stephen Day (who held the seat from 1987 to 2001, and lost to Calton in the 2005 general election). In his victory speech, Hunter described the campaign of the Conservatives as 'nasty' and 'misleading'.\n\nThe campaign was marred by accusations of dirty tricks and ruthless negative campaigning, principally accusing the Conservative campaign. Both the Liberal Democrats and a local newspaper threatened legal action over inaccuracies and defamation in Conservative campaign leaflets. The most significant example was a Conservative leaflet that superimposed a headline about Hunter's voting record on crime with a headline from a local newspaper about a rape, prompting the Liberal Democrats to threaten legal action. With only 4.6% of the vote the Labour Party candidate, Martin Miller, lost his deposit; Labour did not fight an energetic campaign in a seat that was a Liberal Democrat/Conservative marginal.\n\nWith the exception of the 1997 Winchester by-election, where the General Election result was annulled, it was the first seat to be defended in a by-election by the Liberal Democrats since their formation in 1988.

{"id": "1962733", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1962733", "title": "Mandocello", "text": "Mandocello\n\nThe mandocello () is a plucked string instrument of the mandolin family. It is larger than the mandolin, and is the baritone instrument of the mandolin family. Its eight strings are in four paired courses, with the strings in each course tuned in unison. Overall tuning of the courses is in fifths like a mandolin, but beginning on bass C (C2). It can be described as being to the mandolin what the cello is to the violin.\n\nMandocello construction is similar to the mandolin: the mandocello body may be constructed with a bowl-shaped back according to designs of the 18th-century Vinaccia school, or with a flat (arched) back according to the designs of Gibson Guitar Corporation popularized in the United States in the early 20th century. The scale of the mandocello is longer than that of the mandolin. Gibson examples have a scale length of 24.75\" (62.87 cm) but flat-back designs have appeared with both significantly shorter and longer scale lengths (27\"/68.58 cm on some Vega mandocellos). Bowl-back instruments may have a shorter scale length, on the order of 22.5\" (about 57 cm).\n\nThe internal bracing also bears some similarity to the mandolin. Gibson's mandocellos were typically constructed with a single transverse brace on the top just below the oval soundhole. Modern builders also use X-bracing.\n\nAs is typical of the mandolin family, mandocellos can be found with either a single oval soundhole or a pair of \"F\" soundholes.\n\nThese instruments typically have between 18 and 22 frets; concert bowl-back instruments may have more frets permitting virtuoso passage work in the upper register. \n\nThe mandocello generally has four courses of two strings each. Because of the heavy gauge of the lowest course, some folk mandocello players remove one of the C strings to prevent rattling while playing fortissimo. \n\nThere is a rare 10-string/5-course mandocello, containing an additional course of strings above the 1st (highest) course, sometimes termed a liuto cantabile or \"liuto moderno\", although these instruments remain technically mandocellos.\n\nLike most other instruments in the mandolin family the mandocello originated in Europe. Mandolins evolved from the lute family in Italy during the 17th and 18th centuries, and the bowl back mandolin, produced particularly in Naples, became common in the 19th century. It was during the Baroque period (1600-1750) that interest in the mandolin began to increase, along with its use in ensemble playing, resulting in increased interest in developing and expanding the mandolin family.\n\nThe first evidence of modern metal-string mandolins is from literature regarding popular Italian players who travelled through Europe teaching and giving concerts. Notable are Signor Gabriele Leone, Giovanni Battista Gervasio, Pietro Denis, who travelled widely between 1750 and 1810. This, together with the records gleaned from the Italian Vinaccia family of luthiers in Naples, Italy, has led musicologists to believe that the family of modern steel-string mandolins were developed in Naples by the Vinaccia family.\n\nMandolin ensembles were popular in the late Baroque period, and a number of instruments were added to the family around this time, including the mandalone a flat-backed, bass instrument, \"much larger than the liuto\" with \"four heavy wound strings\" tuned (in fourths) to A2-D3-G3-C4. This instrument may have been the direct precursor of the mandocello. The popularity of mandolin ensembles began to wane during the late Classical (1750-1825) period, and after 1815 the mandolin largely transitioned to the status of a folk instrument, and the mandolone all but disappeared. \n\nIt was during this decline in popularity that Pasquale Vinaccia (1806–1885) made his modifications to the instrument that his family made for generations, creating the Neapolitan mandolin.\n\nThe mandolin was largely forgotten outside of Italy by that point, but the stage was set for it to become known again, starting with the Paris Exposition in 1878. Vinaccia modernized several members of the mandolin family, improving resonance, increasing ranges, and adding features. In addition to creating the Neapolitan mandolin c. 1835, he reconceived the mandalone and related instruments, which had limited range, and a much quieter tone than the treble mandolins. The Neopolitan mandocello he developed had increased volume, extended range, and effectively superseded the mandolone as the bass instrument of the mandolin family.\nBeginning with the Paris Exposition of 1878, the mandolin's popularity began to rebound. In particular, the Spanish Estudiantina Figaro, an \"association of young teachers, musicians ... created and established in Madrid forming a magnificent band of guitars, bandurrias and violins\" attracted widespread attention. \n\nThis was followed by a wave of Italian mandolinists traveling in Europe in the 1880s and 1890s, and in the United States by the mid-1880s, playing and teaching their instrument. The instrument's popularity continued to increase during the 1890s and mandolin popularity was at its height in the \"early years of the 20th century. Thousands were taking up the instrument as a pastime, and it became an instrument of \"society\", taken up by young men and women. Mandolin orchestras were formed worldwide, incorporating the mandolin family of instruments—mandolins, mandolas, \"mandocellos\", and even mandobasses—as well as guitars, double basses and zithers.\n\nAround this time, the Gibson company began building mandocellos in the style of their mandolins with arched tops and backs. Gibson is known to have produced at least four models of mandocello between 1905 and the 1920s: the K-1, K-2, K-4, and K-5. Other American instrument companies also produced mandocellos.\n\nAfter the 1930s the popularity of mandolin ensembles once again began to decline, though not as completely as it had in the 19th century. Mandolins continued to be produced, but production of other members of the family decreased significantly, although—with the possible exception of the mandobass—it never died out completely.\n\nUsually, courses of 2 adjacent strings are doubled (tuned to the same pitch). The standard mandocello tuning of C2 C2•G2 G2•D3 D3•A3 A3 is equivalent to that of the violoncello:\n\n\nThe average range, therefore, is about three-and-a-half octaves, with the exact range depending on the number of frets on the individual instrument: from two octaves below middle C up to D#5/Eb5, in the octave above middle C, (with 18 frets), to as high as A5, with 24 frets.\n\nOn 10-string/5-course instruments an additional string-pair, placed above the first course, is tuned to E3 E3, adding an additional half-octave or so to the upper range.\n\nThe bowl-back mandocello is chiefly used in mandolin orchestras and mandolin quartets, where it provides a melodic and bass role similar to the cello in a bowed string quartet. It is occasionally used as a solo instrument for the performance of classical music, such as concertos and unaccompanied repertoire originally composed for solo cello. However, some pieces specifically for liuto cantabile were composed by Raffaele Calace, who championed the instrument in the early 20th century. More recent music for solo mandocello was presented at the 2018 Classical Mandolin Society Convention in Santa Rosa. An article on this event and examples of the music appear in the CMSA Mandolin Journal.\n\nThe mandocello also has a role in modern folk music, such as bluegrass or Celtic music. In this setting the flat-back mandocello is typically used. The mandocello's lower range does not produce the bright, projecting sound of the mandolin or mandola, and its use in this setting has been generally eclipsed by mandolin artists since Bill Monroe. The amplified instrument has infrequently been used in modern rock music groups. The bowl-back mandocello (mandoloncello) is traditionally used for Italian folk music. \n\nThe most historically significant mandocellist was Raffaele Calace, who wrote the first method book specifically for liuto cantabile, and is thought to have perfected the design of the instrument following its putative introduction by the Vinaccia family. Luigi Embergher also contributed significantly to advancements in the design of the instrument during the late 19th and early 20th centuries.\n\nAccomplished artists specializing in mandocello performance in 21st century America are relatively few in number, and only a modest number of contemporary recordings prominently feature the instrument. One American mandocello artist, Stanley Greenthal, is a specialist in the music of Brittany and an instructor at Zouk Fest. The mandolinist Radim Zenkl is also well known for performances of American, Italian, and other European folk music on the mandocello. One recent recording with mandolin virtuosos Carlo Aonzo and David Grisman has featured Zenkl's mandocello on the album of Italian folk music \"Traversata\" published by Acoustic Disc. Steve Knightley of the English folk-rock band Show of Hands plays the \"cello-mandolin\", however his instrument is tuned GDAD, similar to an octave mandolin. Mike Marshall, best known for his collaborations with David Grisman, Darol Anger and Chris Thile has performed and recorded frequently with the mandocello.\n\nGeoff Goodman, New York born European jazz musician and composer, features both guitar and mandocello in his compositions.\n\nPatterson Hood, front man for Drive-By Truckers, plays a mandocello made by Scott Baxendale of Baxendale Guitars in Athens Georgia. Baxendale starts with a vintage Harmony guitar and converts it from six string standard tuning to the mandocello. \n\nBryn Haworth uses a mandocello on his album Let The Days Go By.\n\nJohn Nagy and David Grisman play mandocello on the Earth Opera album The Great American Eagle Tragedy.\n\nMike Marshall played a mandocello on his collaboration album \"Uncommon Ritual\" with Edgar Meyer and Béla Fleck and plays it live occasionally (for example with Darol Anger on violin).\n\nRick Nielsen of the band Cheap Trick has a stringed instrument collection that includes electric mandocellos custom made by Hamer Guitars. Such an instrument was used for the title track from their LP \"Heaven Tonight,\" while their song \"Mandocello\", released on the band's debut album, used a standard acoustic mandocello. This song was later covered by Concrete Blonde and released on their album \"Still in Hollywood.\" \n\nJaco Pastorius, bassist for Weather Report, overdubbed a mandocello on their hit \"Birdland.\"\n\nRichie Sambora, guitarist for Bon Jovi, used a mandocello on the song \"Lay Your Hands on Me\" from their acoustic album \"This Left Feels Right.\"\n\n\nPatterson Hood's Converted Baxendale Mandocello.\n\n"}

He was educated at Berlin and Jena universities. During 1867 and 1868 he was the holder of a fellowship at the Royal Statistical Bureau of Berlin, and in 1869 became privat-docent at the University of Heidelberg, but in the same year accepted an invitation from the Polytechnikum at Riga. Cohn paid a visit to England in 1873, and the fruits of his observation and research were embodied in the masterly production \"Untersuchungen über die Englische Eisenbahnpolitik,\" 2 vols., Leipzig, 1874-75. In 1875, he was invited to fill the chair of economics at ETH Zurich, which he held until 1884, when he became professor in the University of Göttingen.\n\nWhile at Zurich he prepared for publication his \"Volkswirtschaftliche Aufsätze\" (Stuttgart, 1882), and contributed to the \"Göttingische Gelehrte Anzeigen\" (1880, i. 97-135) an exhaustive critical review of the first volume of Wagner's \"Allgemeine Volkswirtschaftlehre.\" The names of Wagner and Cohn have often been coupled, not only because both were classed among the Katheder-Socialisten, but also because they have much in common in their attitude toward the various so-called schools of economic science. In continuation of his study of the English railroad policy, and as the third volume of his earlier work on that subject, appeared his \"Die Englische Eisenbahnpolitik der Letzten Zehn Jahre,\" Leipzig, 1883.\n\nAfter his establishment at Göttingen a period of ardent literary activity set in. The first volume of the greatest work which he has yet produced, his \"System der Nationalökonomie,\" was published in 1885, the very next year after his arrival. It is significant of the importance and character of this work that two such great leaders of the respective opposing \"schools\" as Wagner and Schmoller should unite in praising it.\n\nIn 1886, he contributed to the \"Jahrbuch für Nationalökonomie\"(vol. xiii, No. 6), \"Zur Fabrikgesetzgebung,\" a review of government reports on factory legislation in Switzerland and Saxony, and to the \"Jahrbuch für Gesetzgebung\" (x.3), \"Eröterungen über die Fiskalische Behandlung der Verkehrsanstalten.\" In that year, too, appeared his \"Nationalökonomische Studien,\" Stuttgart, 1886.\n\nThe year 1889 witnessed the publication of the second volume of his \"System der Nationalökonomie,\" and his \"Finanzwissenschaft.\"\n\nCohn was elected a regular member of the Gesellschaft der Wissenschaften at Göttingen in 1894; and in 1896 the Prussian Order of the Red Eagle of the fourth class was conferred upon him. After an interval of nearly ten years he completed the third volume of the \"System der Nationalökonomie,\" which was also issued under the title \"Nationalökonomie des Handelsund Verkehrswesens: Ein Lesebuch für Studierende,\" Stuttgart, 1898. To the \"Jahrbuch für Nationalökonomie\" (vi, Jan., 1901) he contributed \"Ueber die Vereinigung der Staatswissenschaften mit den Juristenfacultäten.\"\n\n\n\n"}

They have different functions, including praising God in heavens, interacting with humans ordinary life, and carrying laws of nature. Islam acknowledges the concept of angels both as anthropomorphic and abstract. Belief in angels is one of the six articles of faith in Islam. The Quran is the principal source for the Islamic concept of angels, but more extensive features of angels appear in hadiths, Mi'raj literature, Islamic theology and Islamic philosophy. The angels differ from other spiritual creatures in their attitude as creatures of virtue in contrast to impure demons and morally ambivalent jinn.\n\nAngels are another kind of creature created by God, known to mankind, commonly dwelling in the heavenly spheres. Although the Quran does not mention the time when angels were created, they are generally considered as the first creation of God. According to Tabari, the angels had been created on Wednesday, while other creatures on the following days. Although not mentioned in the Quran, angels are believed to be created from a luminous substance, repeatedly described as a form of light. The probably most famous hadith regarding their origin is reported in Sahih Muslim: \"The Angels were created out of light and the Jann was created out of a mixture of fire and Adam was created out of what characterizes you.\" \"Nur\", the term used for the \"light\" from which the angels are created from, usually corresponds to the cold light of night or the light of the moon, contrasted to \"nar\", which corresponds to \"fire\" or the diurnal and solar light from which the angels of punishment are said to be created of. Dividing angels into two groups created from different types of light is also attested by Tabari, Abd al-Ghani al-Maqdisi, Al-Jili and Al-Suyuti. Suyuti distinguishes in his work Al-Hay’a as-samya fi l-hay’a as-sunmya angels as created from \"fire that eats, but does not drink\" in opposition to devils created from \"fire that drinks, but does not eat\" which is also identified with the fire of the sun. Scholars also argued that there is no distinction between \"nur\" and \"nar\" at all. Although not his conclusion, Tabari argued that both can be seen as the same substance, since both pass into each other but refer to the same thing on different degrees. Asserting that both fire and light are actually the same but on different degrees can also be found by Qazwini and Ibishi. The lack of distinction between fire and light might be explained by the fact that both are closely related morphologically and phonetically. Al-Baydawi argued that \"light\" serves only as a proverb, but fire and light refers actually to the same substance. Apart from light, other traditions also mention exceptions about angels created from fire, ice or water.\n\nOne of the Islamic major characteristic is their lack of bodily desires; they never get tired, do not eat or drink and have no anger. As with other monotheistic religions, angels are characteristics of their purity and obedience to God. However, their constant loyalty, towards God, emphasized by some Quranic verses such as , does not necessarily imply impeccability, and the motif of erring angels is also known to Islam. Some scholars on the other hand, among Hasan of Basra as one of the first, extend their loyalty towards God to assume general impeccability. Those who accept the possibility of erring angels, advocate that actually only the messengers among the angels are infallible, since the Quran also describes angels as being tested. Al-Baydawi argued, that angels only remain impeccable if they do not fall. Ibn Arabi stated that angels may err in opposing Adam as a vice-regent and fixing on their way of worshipping God to the exclusion of other creatures.\n\nAngels are usually described in anthropomorphic forms combined with supernatural images, such as wings, being of great size, wearing heavenly clothes and great beauty. Some angels are identified with specific colors, often with white, but some special angels have a distinct color, such as Gabriel being associated with the color green.\n\nThe Quran says that the angels were considered to be daughters of God and worshipped in Pre-Islamic Arabia, while newborn girls were often killed, which is condemned in Islam. This is also mentioned concerning Al-Lat, Al-Uzza, and Manāt. The notion that God created the angels as females and fathered daughters is rejected in the Quran.\n\nScholars debated whether human or angels rank higher. The prostration of angels before Adam is often seen as evidence for humans' supremacy over angels. Nevertheless, other hold angels to be superior, as being free from material deficits, such as anger and lust, Angels are free from such inferior urges and therefore superior, a position especially found among Mu'tazilites and some Asharites. A similar opinion was asserted by Hasan of Basri, who argued that angels are superior to humans due to their infallibility, originally opposed by both Sunnis and Shias. This view is based on the assumption of superiority of pure spirit against body and flesh. Contrarily argued, humans rank above angels, since for a human it is harder to be obedient and to worship God, hassling with bodily temptations, in contrast to angels, whose life is much easier and therefore their obedience is rather insignificant. Islam acknowledges a famous story about competing angels and humans in the tale of Harut and Marut, who were tested to determine, whether or not, angels would do better than humans under the same circumstances, a tradition opposed by later scholars, such as ibn Taimiyya, but still accepted by earlier scholars, such as ibn Hanbal. Some Sufi traditions argue that a human generally ranks below angels, but developed to Al-Insān al-Kāmil, he ranks above angels. Comparable to another major opinion, that prophets and messengers among humans rank above angels, but the ordinary human below an angel, while the messengers among angels rank higher than prophets. Maturidism generally holds that angels' and prophets' superiority and obedience derive from their virtues and insights to God's action, but not as their original purity.\n\nAngels believed to be engaged in human affairs are closely related to Islamic purity and modesty rituals. Many hadiths, including Muwatta Imam Malik from one of the Kutub al-Sittah, talk about angels being repelled by humans' state of impurity. Such angels keep a distance from humans, who polluted themselves by certain actions (such as sexual intercourse). However, angels might return to an individual as soon as the person (ritually) purified himself or herself. The absence of angels may cause several problems for the person. If driven away by ritual impurity, the Kiraman Katibin, who record people's actions, and the Guardian angel, will not perform their tasks assigned to the individual. Another hadith specifies, during the state of impurity, bad actions are still written down, but good actions are not. When a person tells a lie, angels nearly are separated from the person from the stench it emanates. Angels also depart from humans when they are naked or are having a bath out of decency, but also curse people who are nude in public.\n\nIn Islamic philosophy, angels appear frequently as incorporeal creatures. Al-Kindi and Ibn Sina both define angels as simple substances, which means, they belong to the Celestial spheres comparable to Ptolemaic astronomy, endowed with life, reason, and immortality, in contrast to sublunary entities such as humans and animals, who are endowed with life, and the former also with reason, but are mortal. Similar Qazwini assigns the angels to heavenly spheres, distinguishing them from among the animals, although both are said to possess the attribute of life. Significantly, Al-Damiri includes in his zoological works, animals, humans, jinn and even demons, but not angels. Such cosmological thought, maintained by scholars such as Al-Farabi and Ibn Sina, has strong resemblance with the Neo-Platonistic emanation cosmology, identifying the different angels in Islam with intellects, dividing the cosmos into different spheres. However, Islamic scholars repeatedly insist that all heavenly spheres as a whole form a single body and are moved by God, in contrast to Aristotelian cosmology in which God only moves the outer sphere. According to ibn Sina, but differing from Al-Farabi, God is not part of the scheme of emanation. God emanated things in accordance with his will. In his \"Theologia Aristotelis\" he shows that through the manifestation of God, the intellects are aware of God and their role in the universe. Further Ibn Sina seems to distinguishes between two types of angels: One completely unrelated to matter, and another one, which exists in form of a superior kind of matter. The latter ones can carry messages between the heavenly spheres and the sublunary world, appearing in visions. Therefore, the higher angels dwell in higher spheres, while their subordinate angels appear in an intermediary realm. Ibn Sina's explanation might imply an attempt to consider revelation as part of the natural world. Also Qazwini lists a lower type of angels; earthly angels as indwelling forces of nature, who keep the world in order and never deviate from their duty. Qazwini believed that the existence of these angels could be proved by reason and effects of these angels on their assigned object.\n\nIslamic philosophy stressed that humans own angelic and demonic qualities and that the human soul is seen as a \"potential angel\" or \"potential demon\". Depending on whether the sensual soul or the rational soul develop, the human soul becomes an angel or a demon. Angels may also give inspirations opposite to the evil suggestions, called \"waswās\", from Satan.\n\nMuhammad's encounter with several significant angels on his journey through the celestial spheres, play a major role in Ibn Abbas version. Many scholars such as Al-Tha`labi drew their exegesis upon this narrative, however it never led to an established angelology as known in Christianity. The principal angels of the heavens are called \"Malkuk\", instead of \"Malak\".\n\nIslam has no standard hierarchical organization that parallels the division into different \"choirs\" or spheres hypothesized and drafted by early medieval Christian theologians, but does distinguish between archangels and angels. Angels are not equal in status and consequently, they are delegated different tasks to perform.\n\n\nNāzi'āt: will take out the soul painfully, he is allocated for taking out the souls of kaafir.\nNāshiṭāt; He will take out the souls of momineen.\nRef:Quran surah Al-Fussilat Ayah# 31\nAnd we angels were your allies in the worldly life, and are so in the hereafter. cont'd.\n\n\nReference: Surah Al-Anfaal Ayah #09\nWhere ALLAH said,\n(Remember) when you asked help of your Lord, and he answered you ,indeed, I will reinforce you with a thousand from the Angels , following one another.\nThis Ayah affirms the statement of Ar-Rabi bin Anas in Tafsir ibn e kathir while explaining the Tafsir of Ayah no 12 of surah Al-Anfal where he said in the Aftermath of badr, the people used to recognize whomever the Angels killed from those whom they killed,by the wound over their necks, fingers, and toes because those parts had Mark as if they were branded by fire.\n\n\n\nAngels play an important role in Sufism. Just as in non-Sufi-related traditions, angels are thought of as created of light. Al-Jili specifies that the angels are created from the Light of Muhammad and in his attribute of guidance, light and beauty. Influenced by Ibn Arabis Sufi metaphysics, Haydar Amuli identifies angels as created to represent different names/attributes of God's beauty, while the devils are created in accordance with God's attributes of Majesty, such as \"The Haugthy\" or \"The Domineering\". Sufi cosmology divides the world into several realms. The realm of Malakut is the plane in which symbols take on form. It is also the sphere in which humans may encounter angels, during their dreams. Some authors have suggested that some individual angels in the microcosmos represent specific human faculties on a macrocosmic level. According to a common belief, if a Sufi can not find Shaikh to teach him, he will be taught by the angel Khidr.\n\nContemporary Salafism continues to regard the belief in angels as a pillar of Islam and regards the rejection of the literal belief in angels as unbelief and an innovation brought by secularism and Positivism. Modern reinterpretations, as for example suggested by Nasr Abu Zayd, are strongly disregarded. Simultaneously, many traditional materials regarding angels are rejected on the ground, they would not be authentic. The Muslim Brotherhood scholars Sayyid Qutb and Umar Sulaiman Al-Ashqar reject much established material concerning angels, such as the story of \"Harut and Marut\" or naming the Angel of Death \"Azrail\". Sulayman Ashqar not only rejects the traditional material itself, further he disapproves scholars who used them.\n\nIslamic Modernist scholars such as Muhammad Asad and Ghulam Ahmed Parwez have suggested a metaphorical reinterpretation of the concept of angels.\n\n"}

Hosted by former test cricketer Mike Whitney and co-hosted by Tania Zaetta, the show has been screened in over 50 countries around the world.\n\nAs an adventure game show in which contestants are expected to complete undesirable tasks in order to win prizes, \"Who Dares Wins\" could be considered a precursor to contemporary reality TV series such as \"Fear Factor\". It was created by David Mason and Adrian Brant.\n\nThe main focus of each episode of the show often revolves around a dangerous stunt of some kind. An unsuspecting contestant, previously nominated by a viewer of the show, is ambushed by Whitney and dared to partake and complete the stunt successfully in order to win a major consolation prize (usually a holiday and spending money).\n\nMost of the runtime of a typical episode is devoted to the preparation of the stunt and the training the contestant receives. Often the stunt would also be demonstrated beforehand (successfully or unsuccessfully) by professional stuntmen.\n\nIn the climax of the show the contestant then attempts to complete the dare; if successful they win the major prize. If they fail or decide to drop out, co-host Zaetta will then try to complete the dare instead; the contestants forfeits the prize if she succeeds, but if she fails or pulls out herself, the contestant wins regardless.\n\nDuring the show each major dare is bookended by several minor segments in which Whitney travels the streets and shopping malls of Australia challenging people to complete a lesser dare for a cash prize (usually around $50 to $200). This may range from sticking a hand into a container full of cockroaches or having all their hair shaved off, to more complex dares such as tightrope walking above a mall foyer, or diving off a ten-metre platform into a pool.\n\nDespite Australian production of the show ending in 1998, \"Who Dares Wins\" continues to be popular around the globe on cable television networks such as AXN. In particular, the show's massive success in India even led to a series of India-based specials hosted by Whitney and Zaetta in 2002, and later an Indian spin-off called \"Extreme Dhamaka\" in 2003.\n\nThe show was also licensed to the United Kingdom and named \"Don't Try This At Home\" and then renamed \"Challenge of a Lifetime\". In the United States the Game Show Network aired \"Who Dares Wins\" on several occasions, with the tagline that \"Who Dares Wins\" was \"Australian for Game Show\" as a parody of Foster's Lager's American advertising campaign of the time.\n\nAt the height of the show's popularity, Mike Whitney introduced the 'Maxibon challenge', a minor segment challenge to eat a Nestlé Maxibon ice-cream in 30 seconds. Every week Whitney would test the mettle of the Australian public. If a contestant managed to complete the challenge they would then be awarded AU$50.00 and dubbed a 'Whitney Warrior'.\n\nA board game called \"Who Dares Wins: The Board Game\" was made and released by Milton Bradley featuring the Seven Network logo and a picture of Mike Whitney on the cover of the box.\n\nAt the 39th Annual TV Week Logie Awards held in 1997, Tania Zaetta was nominated for the Logie for \"Most Popular New Talent\" for her work on \"Who Dares Wins\". The series itself was also nominated for \"Most Popular Light Entertainment Program\".\n\n\n"}

He has represented Senegal at international level, participating in the 2004, 2006, and 2008 African Cup of Nations. He is the older brother of Papa Niang, who is also a professional footballer.\n\nAfter beginning his career with the Le Havre youth team, Niang turned professional at 18 years of age with Troyes. He had a mixed beginning to his career with his first season featuring ten Ligue 1 starts, all from the bench, the following season would show little improvement with 17 starts and only 3 league goals.\n\nA loan period with second division Metz allowed him to hone his skills, contributing 5 goals in 12 appearances and helping Metz return to top flight French football for the 2003–04 season.\n\nJean Fernandez, the Metz manager, tried to make the loan deal into a permanent move but failed and Niang left Troyes for Strasbourg. The arrival of Danijel Ljuboja, to Strasbourg at the same time allowed Niang to form an important strike partnership until Ljuboja moved to Paris Saint-Germain. Niang didn't score again for the remainder of the second half of that season.\n\nThe 2004–05 season saw Mickaël Pagis arrive at Strasbourg, and a fruitful new partnership was formed, with the pair linking up for 27 goals in the league. This partnership helped Strasbourg make it to the Coupe de la Ligue final, where victory over Caen gave Strasbourg their second Coupe de la Ligue trophy. Niang scored Strasbourg's first goal as they won 2-1.\n\nIn 2005, Niang moved to Marseille for a reported fee of €7 million. He was joined six months later by Mickaël Pagis. Niang finished the season as Marseille's top scorer with ten goals but Marseille lost the Coupe de France final to Paris Saint-Germain.\n\nNiang would go on to finish the 2009–10 season with 18 goals in Ligue 1, making him the highest scorer in the league and Marseille's highest scorer with 28 goals in all competitions.\n\nNiang was selected OM player of the month for May 2008.\n\nNiang signed a 3+1 year deal with Fenerbahçe on 14 August 2010 for a fee of reported €8 million.\nHe made a great start with Fenerbahçe SK when he scored 7 goals in his first 6 league appearances. Niang scored his first hat-trick for Fenerbahçe on his 5th appearance when they won 6–2 against Kasımpaşa. He helped his side win the 2010–11 Süper Lig, scoring 16 goals in 29 appearances.\n\nOn 6 September 2011, Niang was sold to Al-Sadd for €7.5 million.\n\nOn 19 October 2011, at the 2011 AFC Champions League semi-final match against Suwon Samsung Bluewings, he scored the controversial, un-sportsmanlike second goal for his team. Al Sadd should've sent the ball back to the Bluewings since the play was suspended when the home team's player was injured. However, while Suwon's defense stood still thinking their goalkeeper will get the ball back, Niang stole the ball and went past the goalkeeper to score. The goal induced an intrusion of a home fan and a huge melee of both players and bench. The controversy got bigger when Al Sadd's player Keita took a swing at a home fan. Even though his goal was against general notion of fair-play, Niang argued that there was no problem with his goal, and that it was Suwon who played without manners, inducing melee between two teams.

{"id": "1962803", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1962803", "title": "Jindalee Operational Radar Network", "text": "Jindalee Operational Radar Network\n\nThe Jindalee Operational Radar Network (JORN) is an over-the-horizon radar (OTHR) network that can monitor air and sea movements across 37,000 km. It has a normal operating range of 1,000 km to 3,000 km. It is used in the defence of Australia, and can also monitor maritime operations, wave heights and wind directions.\n\nJORN's main ground stations comprise a control centre, known as JCC, at RAAF Base Edinburgh in South Australia and two transmission stations: JOR1 near Longreach, Queensland and JOR2 near Laverton, Western Australia.\n\nThe roots of the JORN can be traced back to post World War II experiments in the United States and a series of Australian experiments beginning in the early 1950s. From July 1970 a study was undertaken; this resulted in a proposal for a program to be carried out, in three phases, to develop an over-the-horizon-radar system.\n\nPhase 1, Project Geebung, aimed to define operational requirements for an over-the-horizon-radar (OTHR), and study applicable technologies and techniques. The project carried out a series of ionospheric soundings evaluating the suitability of the ionosphere for the operation of an OTHR.\n\nPhase 2, Project Jindalee, aimed at proving the feasibility and costing of OTHR. This second phase was carried out by the Radar Division, (later, the High Frequency Radar Division), of the Defence Science and Technology Organisation (DSTO). Project Jindalee came into being during the period 1972–1974 and was divided into three stages.\n\nStage 'A' commenced in April 1974. It involved the construction of a prototype radar receiver at Mount Everard, (near Alice Springs), a transmitter (at Harts Range, 160 km away) and a beacon in Derby. When completed (in October 1976) the Stage A radar ran for two years, closing in December 1978. Stage A formally ended in February 1979, having achieved its mission of proving the feasibility of OTHR. The success of stage A resulted in the construction of a larger stage 'B' radar, drawing on the knowledge gained from stage A.\n\nStage 'B' commenced on 6 July 1978. The new radar was constructed next to the stage A radar. Developments during stage B included real time signal processing, custom built processors, larger antenna arrays, and higher power transmitters, which resulted in a more sensitive and capable radar. \nTrials were carried out with the Royal Australian Air Force during April 1984, substantially fulfilling the mission of stage B, to demonstrate an OTHR operating in Australia. Another two years of trials were carried out before the Jindalee project officially finished in December 1985.\n\nStage 'C' became the conversion of the stage B radar to an operational radar. This stage saw substantial upgrades to the stage B equipment followed by the establishment of No. 1 Radar Surveillance Unit RAAF (1RSU) and the handover of the radar to 1RSU. The aim was to provide the Australian Defence Force with operational experience of OTHR.\n\nPhase 3 of the OTHR program was the design and construction of the JORN. The decision to build the JORN was announced in October 1986. Telstra, in association with GEC-Marconi, became the prime contractor and a fixed price contract for the construction of the JORN was signed on 11 June 1991. The JORN was to be completed by 13 June 1997.\n\nTelstra was responsible for software development and systems integration, areas in which it had no previous experience. GEC-Marconi was responsible for the HF Radar and related software aspects of the project, areas in which it had no previous experience. Other unsuccessful tenderers for the project included experienced Australian software development and systems integration company, BHP IT, and experienced Australian defence contractor AWA Defence Industries (AWADI). Both of these companies are no longer in business.\n\nBy 1996, the project was experiencing technical difficulties and cost overruns. Telstra reported an A$609 million loss and announced that it could not guarantee a delivery date.\n\nThe failed Telstra contract prompted the project to enter a fourth phase.\n\nPhase 4 involved the completion of the JORN and its subsequent maintenance using a new contractor. In February 1997 Lockheed Martin and Tenix received a contract to deliver and manage the JORN. Subsequently, during June 1997 Lockheed and Tenix formed the company RLM Group to handle the joint venture. An operational radar system was delivered in April 2003, with maintenance contracted to continue until February 2007.\n\nIn August 2008 Lockheed-Martin acquired Tenix Group's interest in RLM Holdings Pty Ltd.\n\nAs a consequence of the duration of its construction, the JORN delivered in 2003 was designed to a specification developed in the early 1990s. During this period the Alice Springs radar had evolved significantly under the guidance of the Defence Science and Technology Organisation (DSTO). In February 2004 a fifth phase of the JORN project was approved.\n\nPhase 5 aimed to upgrade the Laverton and Longreach radars to reflect over a decade of OTHR research and development. It was scheduled to run until approximately the year 2011, but was completed around 2013/2014 due to skills shortage. All three stations are now similar, and use updated electronics.\n\nIn March 2018 it was announced that BAE Systems Australia will undertake the $1.2 billion upgrade to Australia’s Jindalee Operational Radar Network which will take 10 years to complete.\n\nThe JORN project (JP2025) has had 5 phases, and has cost approximately A$1.8 billion. The ANAO Audit report of June 1996 estimated an overall project cost for Phase 3 of $1.1 billion. Phase 5 costs have been estimated at $70 million. Phase 6 costs expect to be $1.2 billion.\n\nJORN consists of:\n\nDSTO uses a radar station near Alice Springs, Northern Territory (JFAS) for research and development and also has its own network of vertical/oblique ionosondes for research purposes.\nThe Alice Springs radar can be patched into the JORN to provide a third active radar station.\n\nEach radar station consists of a transmitter site and a receiver site, separated by a large distance to prevent the transmitter from interfering with the receiver. The four JORN transmitter and receiver sites are:\n\nThe research and development transmitter and receiver sites are:\n\nThe Alice Springs radar was the original 'Jindalee Stage B' test bed on which the design of the other two stations was based. It continues to act as a research and development testbed in addition to its operational role.\n\nThe Mount Everard receiver site contains the remains of the first, smaller, 'Jindalee Stage A' receiver. It is visible in aerial photos, behind the stage B receiver (). The stage A transmitter was rebuilt to become the stage B transmitter.\n\nThe high frequency radio transmitter arrays at Longreach and Laverton have 28 elements, each driven by a 20-kilowatt power amplifier giving a total power of 560 kW. Stage B transmitted 20 kW per amplifier. The signal is bounced off the ionosphere, landing in the \"illuminated\" area of target interest. Much incident radiation is reflected forward in the original direction of travel, but a small proportion \"backscatters\" and returns along the original, reciprocal transmission path. These returns again reflect from the ionosphere, finally being received at the Longreach and Laverton stations. Signal attenuation, from transmit antenna to target and finally back to receive antenna, is substantial, and its performance in such a context marks this system as leading-edge science. The receiver stations use KEL Aerospace KFR35 series receivers. JORN uses radio frequencies between 5 and 30 MHz, which is far lower than most other civilian and military radars that operate in the microwave frequency band. Also, unlike most microwave radars, JORN does not use pulsed transmission, nor does it use movable antennas. Transmission is Frequency-Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW), and the transmitted beam is aimed by the interaction between its \"beam-steering\" electronics and antenna characteristics in the transmit systems. Radar returns are distinguished in range by the offset between the instantaneous radiated signal frequency and the returning signal frequency. Returns are distinguished in azimuth by measuring phase offsets of individual returns incident across the kilometres-plus length of the multi-element receiving antenna array. Intensive computational work is necessary to JORN's operation, and refinement of the software suite offers the most cost-effective path for improvements.\n\nThe JORN ionosonde network is made up of vertical ionosondes, providing a real time map of the ionosphere. Each vertical incidence sounder (VIS) is a standardized Single-Receiver \"Digisonde\" Portable Sounder built by Lowell for the JORN. A new ionospheric map is generated every 225 seconds. In a clockwise direction around Australia, the locations of the twelve (11 active and one test) JORN ionosondes are below.\n\nThe DSTO ionosonde network is not part of the JORN, but is used to further DSTO's research goals. DSTO uses Four-Receiver Digisonde Portable Sounders (DPS-4), also built by Lowell. During 2004 DSTO had ionosondes at the following locations.\n\nFrom west to east, the seven JORN transponders are located at\n\nAll of the above sites (and many more that likely form part of the network) can be found precisely on the RadioFrequency Map, which also lists the frequencies in use at each site.\n\nThe JORN network is operated by No. 1 Remote Sensor Unit (1RSU). Data from the JORN sites is fed to the JORN Coordination Centre at RAAF Base Edinburgh where it is passed on to other agencies and military units. Officially the system allows the Australian Defence Force to observe air and sea activity north of Australia to distances up to 4000 km. This encompasses all of Java, Irian Jaya, Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands, and may include Singapore.\nHowever, in 1997, the prototype was able to detect missile launches by China over away.\n\nJORN is so sensitive it is able to track planes as small as a Cessna 172 taking off and landing in East Timor 2600 km away. Current research is anticipated to increase its sensitivity by a factor of ten beyond this level.\n\nIt is also reportedly able to detect stealth aircraft, as typically these are designed only to avoid detection by microwave radar. Project DUNDEE was a cooperative research project, with American missile defence research, into using JORN to detect missiles. The JORN was anticipated to play a role in future Missile Defense Agency initiatives, detecting and tracking missile launches in Asia.\n\nAs JORN is reliant on the interaction of signals with the ionosphere ('bouncing'), disturbances in the ionosphere adversely affect performance. The most significant factor influencing this is solar changes, which include sunrise, sunset and solar disturbances. The effectiveness of JORN is also reduced by extreme weather, including lightning and rough seas.\n\nAs JORN uses the Doppler principle to detect objects, it cannot detect objects moving at a tangent to the system, or objects moving at a similar speed to their surroundings.\n\nIn May 2016, the JORN FAQ file / Fact Sheet was updated by the RAAF to address questions about Malaysia Airlines Flight 370. According to the update, \"JORN was not operational at the time of the aircraft's disappearance.\" The update also stated that MH370 would have been unlikely to be detected by the system due to radar range, ionospheric conditions and a \"lack of information on MH370's possible flight path towards Australia.\"\n\nHowever, in the immediate aftermath of the 8 March 2014 disappearance, information regarding JORN's status was not released. This led to months of speculation. On 18 March 2014, sources cited by \"The Australian\" said that JORN was not tasked to look toward the Indian Ocean on the night of the disappearance of MH370 as there was no reason for it to be searching there at that time. On 20 March 2014, it was reported that Malaysian Defence Minister (also Acting Transport Minister) Hishammuddin Hussein requested the US to give any information from the Pine Gap base near Alice Springs, possibly alluding to JORN as well. On 19 March 2014, it was reported that an Australian Defence Department spokesman said it \"won't be providing comment\" regarding specific information on tracking MH370 by JORN. However, several days prior to this, Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop told the Australian Parliament, \"All our defence intelligence relating to Flight 370 has been, and will continue to be, passed on to Malaysian authorities...\"\n\nIn March 2015, before the July 2015 discovery of MH370 debris on Réunion Island, aviation technology expert Andre Milne requested information from JORN to prove or disprove that the aircraft ended up in the Indian Ocean, but he received no response from the Australian government in 2015. It was made public in May 2016 that JORN was not operational at the time of the disappearance.\n\nJORN received an Engineering Heritage International Marker from Engineers Australia as part of its Engineering Heritage Recognition Program.\n\n"}

It was established in 1902 by Assid Abraham Corban, a Lebanese immigrant who had arrived in New Zealand ten years earlier. Corbans Wines grew to become the second largest producer of wine in New Zealand until they were purchased by Montana Wines in 2000. Following several takeovers of Montana by Allied Domecq and then Pernod Ricard, Corbans was spun off in 2011 and is now owned by Lion.\n\nAssid Abraham Corban purchased a block of rural land for £320 in Henderson. Although Henderson is now suburban Auckland, at the time the block was in a rural area quite some distance away, which he named Mt Lebanon Vineyards. The original plantings were Black Hamburgh, Chasselas, Hermitage, and Cabernet Sauvignon.\n\nThe first vintage was in 1908, coinciding with the local electorate voting in prohibition, which meant he was unable to sell wine from the property. Assid's son Wadier took over wine-making in 1916, and by the 1920s the Corban family were the largest winemakers in New Zealand. Development of different vineyards by the five sons of Assid Corban continued until 1963 when the partnership of the five brothers was converted into Corban Wines Ltd.\n\nBy the 1960s, Corbans produced New Zealand's first commercial Müller-Thurgau, Pinotage, and Chardonnay wines, and were pioneering many new developments in winemaking such as using cultured yeast and temperature-control during fermentation, and the use of stainless steel tanks and press machinery. At the same time however, the family struggled to finance increasing competition with Montana Wines. New Zealand food wholesaler Rothman Industries (later Magnum Corporation) took a shareholding, and by 1979 had taken full control.\n\nIn the 1980s Corbans was also producing wines under the Stoneleigh and Robard and Butler labels. Today, the Corban family are no longer associated with Corbans wines; Alwyn Corban set out in 1981 to establish Ngatarawa Wines in what is now the Bridge Pa Triangle zone of the Hawke's Bay wine region, now owned by Mission Estate.\n\nThe original estate homestead and winery buildings in Henderson were sold in 1992 to the Waitakere City Council, which repurposed the historic buildings as art studios and galleries, establishing the Corban Estate Arts Centre in 2001.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1962824", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1962824", "title": "SD Gundam", "text": "SD Gundam\n\nSD Gundam originated from a contributed illustration of a junior student from Nagoya by the name of Koji Yokoi to the \"Model News\" magazine that Bandai was issuing in the 1980s. The illustration is of a Gundam but with an unusual proportion where the overall height of the Gundam is equal to twice that of its head. This illustration interested the chief editor and led to Koji Yokoi serializing SD Gundam in 4 frame comics in \"Model News\".\n\nThe super deformed designs were suitable for capsule toys, and so they were first merchandised as small SD Gundam-shaped erasers as part of the Gashapon series \"SD Gundam World\" in 1985. Built with a hole so they could be skewered into a pencil, the series was a hit with Japanese schoolchildren, and the concept soon expanded to other forms of merchandising and media, including models, manga, trading cards, anime and video games.\n\nThe popularity of SD Gundam was such that between the late '80s and early '90s, sales from the SD Gundam franchise far exceeded those of the rest of Gundam. And whereas Gundam pioneered the real robot branch of mecha anime, SD Gundam's more comical and exaggerated approach to the genre served to move it away from the ultra-realism that it was shifting towards in the '80s, and inspired a new flood of super-deformed robot shows the late '80s and early '90s such as Sunrise's \"Mashin Hero Wataru\" and \"Haō Taikei Ryū Knight\", as well as video games such as the \"Super Robot Wars\" franchise.\n\nAlthough the SD Gundam franchise initially started out featuring characters and mecha from the mainstream Gundam series, by the 1990s SD Gundam spawned numerous spin-off series, \"SD Gundam Sengokuden\" (Musha Gundam) which has a Sengoku setting, \"SD Gundam Gaiden\" (Knight Gundam) which has a fantasy medieval setting and \"SD Command Chronicles\" which has a modern military style to name a few.\n\nAnimated works based on SD Gundam are generally adapted from existing toy lines or manga and are animated by Sunrise.\n\n are Gundam units modelled after samurai, ninja, or other forms of feudal Japanese warriors. Musha Gundam first appeared in \"Plamo-Kyoshiro\"<プラモ狂四郎> (Story by Craft dan and art by Koichi Yamato). In the story, the \"SD Gundam\" is an original Gundam created by Kyoshiro (protagonist) for a showdown with Shigeru (antagonist). The original design of the SD form Musha Gundam is credited to Koichi Yamato, and Yasui Hisashi. The story of Musha Gundam, SD Sengokuden, originated from the manga \"Seven Gundams\" of the \"Comic World\" series by MARSHI (a.k.a. Susumu Imaishi). The Musha Gundam series is the longest running SD Gundam series, since the series is set in the Warring States period the use of katakana is avoided, and kanji is used heavily.\n\n is part of the SD Gundam franchise, a sub-franchise of the popular Gundam anime. In Knight Gundam, Gundam mecha and characters are reimagined as knights, sorcerers and other fantasy and medieval European character types. Knight Gundam is a series that took elements from Japanese role playing games, such as the \"Dragon Quest\" series, into SD Gundam. The knight style SD Gundam designs are devised by Koji Yokoi and soon Knight Gundam became an independent series like Musha Gundam.\n\nThe series first started on Carddas trading cards with the story set in the \"Saddarc World\" (Carddas spelt backwards). Soon after it expanded to Gashapons, plastic models, manga and games. The Gundams in the Knight Gundam series are portrayed as living beings just like in the Musha Gundam series. But later on in the series giant robots known as \"Kihei\"(機兵) were introduced thus creating a weird picture of a Gundam piloting a Gundam. Also different from Musha Gundam, Knight Gundam has important human characters like Knight Amuro and Princess Frau throughout the whole series.\n\n\nIn the past most of the SD Gundam games are turn-based strategy video games and brawling-type games with shooting. However, the recent SD Gundam games started appearing in other genres.\n\nBelow is a rough list of game works, a more accurate and complete list is available at the .\n\n\nThrough not treated as a title from the SD Gundam series, the RPG (MS Saga: A New Dawn in the US) also used super-deformed graphics for the mobile weapons that were found in the game.\n\nThe SD Gundam designs were also used throughout the earlier Super Robot Wars games (up through \"SRW F\" and \"F Final\", stopping at \"SRW Alpha\" for the PS1), as can be seen by the pupils present in the eyes of the various Mobile Suits that appeared. From \"SRW Alpha\" and beyond, however, the eyes of Mobile Suits remain blank, though the robots themselves are still super-deformed (just as all mechs represented in typical SRW games are). The only exceptions are in \"Shin Super Robot Wars\" and the \"Scramble Commander\" series, where all series featured in these games used real-sized designs instead of the traditional SD-sized ones.\n\nA real-sized Musha Gundam has been placed as a hidden, unlockable unit in \"\" series. Particular SD Gundams that has been converted to normal sizes are confirmed to participate in the Gundam War trading card game.\n\nWhile regular Gundam model lines strive for realism by introducing High Grade, Master Grade, and Perfect Grade models, SD Gundam models are designed for (and sometimes by) the customization crowd. Many SD Gundam models are designed such that variations of the stock models, as seen by SD Gundam comics, can be made by using parts from other SD Gundam kits. Modifying SD models is very popular in Japan, more so than the full-sized counterparts. In addition to made-up robots contributed to SD Gundam comics, Bandai also held monthly contests for custom Gundam (usually Musha-based) models.\n\nThe model kit series is called . The \"BB\" in the title comes from the fact that, initially, BB Senshi models came with airguns that shot BB gun pallets. Due to product liability and safety regulations, the feature was soon removed. 2007 saw the release of the 300th kit in the series. Forming the bulk of the series are Musha Gundam kits; the Musha kits have standard gimmicks like detachable armour and others, such as combination and compatibility of parts between kits. In recent years the G Generation kits have introduced a new proportion and enhanced poseability.\n\nScale is often inconsistent, especially in older kits where many characters from the same storyline are out of scale with one another. However, as the line continued these issues have mostly been addressed and sometimes been intentional. Dai-Shogun characters have often seen their final form released as a much larger figure (in some cases, this is included in the storyline by the character growing to giant size to combat an equally large foe).\n\nAnother model kit series called , though discontinued in the 1990s, covered all the SD Gundam series but mainly focus on Knight Gundam kits. These kits are made from more durable plastic and are bigger than the BB Senshi kits. They can currently be found at auction sites, usually with high prices.\n\nCentury number releases (100, 200, 300, etc.) are often marked as special occasions. 2007 saw the release of the 300th BB Senshi kit in official numbering. However, the previous kit had been BB 295. Bandai retroactively filled in the missing five kits alongside releases of kits with the 300+ numbering. These retroactive kits were of units from \"Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny\", many being recolors of existing kits. Additionally, popular SD Gundam kits have been re-released in waves at around the same time as new kits. These re-releases are broken down by series (Musha, Knight, Command, G-Generation). The popularity of these older kits is such that many have been included in later re-release waves.\n\nA limited subline titled Chi-Bi Senshi (a pun on the mainline's 'BB' and 'chibi', meaning small) consisted of thirteen kits based on Super G-ARMS, Knight Gundam, Gundlaner and Musha. The kits were smaller and less complex than full BB Senshi, built on a five-point skeleton block which allowed for parts swapping between the kits. This gimmick was also utilized with some of the Knight kits to allow them to combine with larger BB Senshi versions of the 'Kihei' mobile weapons they piloted. Additionally, nine of the Chi-Bi Senshi were released in three triple boxsets, depicting them in widely different transparent colours. The Comic World chapters included with these sets referred to these 'Crystal' versions as doppelgangers made from sentient alien crystals who had chosen to copy the real Gundams.\n\nA related line of merchandise has included the designs from SD Gundam works presented as 'real type' versions, lacking the deformed proportions. This concept has seen a resurgence in recent years, with Bandai issuing a Master Grade model kit of Hajime Katoki's Shin Musha Gundam (appearing in\" \") and Banpresto releasing toys and mini-statues based on 'real type' versions of Musha and Knight characters.\n\nStarting in 2008, the SDX line is a collector aimed series of action figures based on SD Gundam characters. The first figure released, Knight Gundam, was based on a scratch-built model of the character made by Hobby Japan for his appearance in Musha Retsuden Zero. Following this was a release of 'Full Armor Knight Gundam' (depicting the character's upgraded form), with figures of Satan Gundam and Command Gundam announced for later in 2009.\nBeing a collector aimed line, the series focuses on high detail, option parts and updating popular SD Gundam characters who are only otherwise represented by decades old model kits and toys. For example, Knight Gundam was released with a display base, alternate facial expressions and armor pieces produced from metal.\n\nThis is the most recent model kit series which aims for styled proportions, weapon customization, budget friendliness, and connecting every single SD Gundam Kit, and possibly even make kits from other grades that doesn't have SD versions of it; one example is the Try Burning Gundam, which currently has a HG (High Grade) version of it, and unlike its past counterpart, the Build Burning Gundam has its own BB Senshi counterpart.

For more than ten years now, K-Tino (on earlier albums Catino) has been one of the main exponents of bikutsi. Her lyrics are quite explicit, although she herself denies that she is vulgar, saying \" I am not vulgar, I do not make vulgar spectacles. If I am vulgar, then the Ewondo language is vulgar.\" A key to bikutsi is the subtlety of the sexual content, which is hidden by changing non-vulgar words very slightly in the Ewondo language. The media dubbed K-Tino as \"femme du peuple,\" \"mama bonheur,\" and \"mama la joie.\" K-Tino began singing in Chacal and Escalier Bar, later joining the band Les Zombies de la Capitale.\n\nIn early 2014 K-tino stated that she has stopped doing obscene music and has now given her life to god. She is starting a church called Celestial City in the Gabonese capital.\n\nK-Tino's daughter, K-Wash, is also a bikutsi performer.\n\nSome member of the press were critical of the sexual nature of the lyrics, including a writer for the newspaper Mutations who said, \"\"Cameroon has exhibited a looseness of morals unprecedented. The debauchery and the sexual perversions are of the most immoral, and affect everyone. Sex, of the most vulgar manner, is more and more present in the media and the public, marked by eccentric, indecent clothing intended to provoke sensual pleasure, nudity, and sensuality.\"\n"}

This building houses some of the finest stained glass works of Sir Edward Burne-Jones.\n\nIn Easthampstead there is evidence of local Bronze Age existence in the form of a large round barrow on the top of Bill Hill. The hill itself is also surrounded by an ancient ditch, which has largely been filled in. Bill Hill now forms part of a park next to Downshire Way and it is a Scheduled Ancient Monument.\n\nEasthampsted is mentioned as an entry in the Domesday book as land belonging to the abbey of Westminster St. Peter in the hundred of Ripplesmere. It was a small village of 14 villagers and 8 ploughlands, and had a value of £5 in 1066. By 1070 it was only worth £2.5.\n\nOriginally Easthampstead was an important parish in Windsor Forest, its manor house at Easthampstead Park being a popular hunting lodge with the Royal Family.

Principally a stage actor, he has also appeared as a regular character in several high-profile British television programmes, including \"Crossroads,\" \"Emmerdale Farm,\" and most notably in the BBC science fiction television series \"Doctor Who,\" in which he portrayed Captain Mike Yates of UNIT. Franklin initially played the part from 1971 until 1974, but has returned to the role on a number of occasions both on television and in Doctor Who spin-off media. Franklin is a prolific dramatist and author of books such as \"Forest Wisdom: Radical Reform of Democracy and the Welfare State\" reflecting his left-wing political views and activism, as well as novels based in the Doctor Who universe. Franklin has stood as an independent candidate for Parliament several times and founded the Silent Majority Party.\n\nFranklin was educated at Westminster School, and studied PPE before going on to complete an MA in Modern History at Christ Church, Oxford. During National Service he was commissioned into the Royal Green Jackets (Rifle Brigade) and was a captain in Queen Victoria's Rifles. Prior to embarking on an acting career, he spent three years at the advertising agency Hobson and Grey as an assistant account executive, assistant producer, and scriptwriter.\n\nFranklin trained as an actor at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (colloquially known as RADA), where he won the Jenny Laird prize.\n\nImmediately after graduating RADA, Franklin spent six years in repertory theatre, beginning at the Century Theatre under the directorship of Heinz Bernard. He then spent two years at Birmingham Rep under Peter Dews, a season at Bristol Old Vic under Val May, before moving to Ipswich where in addition to acting he also held an associate directorship.\n\nFranklin has appeared in a number of productions in London's West End. In 1967 he played the role of Corin in \"As You Like It\" at the Vaudeville Theatre, alongside Brian Cox as Orlando. In 1978 he took over the lead role in Same Time, Next Year from Michael Crawford.

{"id": "1962852", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1962852", "title": "Cecil Woodham-Smith", "text": "Cecil Woodham-Smith\n\nCecil Blanche Woodham-Smith (\"née\" Fitzgerald; 29 April 1896 – 16 March 1977) was a British historian and biographer. She wrote four popular history books, each dealing with a different aspect of the Victorian era.\n\nCecil Woodham-Smith was born in 1896 in Tenby, Wales. Her family, the Fitzgeralds, were a well-known Irish family, one of her ancestors being Lord Edward Fitzgerald, hero of the Irish Rebellion of 1798. Her father Colonel James FitzGerald had served in the Indian Army during the Sepoy Mutiny; her mother's family included General Sir Thomas Picton, a distinguished soldier who was killed at Waterloo.\n\nShe attended the Royal School for Officers' Daughters in Bath, until her expulsion for taking unannounced leave for a trip to the National Gallery. She finished her schooling at a French convent and afterwards entered St Hilda's College, Oxford. She graduated with a second-class degree in English in 1917.\n\nIn 1928 she married George Ivon Woodham-Smith, a distinguished London solicitor with whom she had an exceptionally close and deep relationship until his death in 1968. But although she possessed a knack for historical writing, she postponed her career (as was customary for women of her time) until her two children had gone off to boarding school. In the meantime, she wrote pot-boilers under the pseudonym Janet Gordon; this training was to stand her in good stead as an historian, as she mastered the art of writing entertaining narrative.\n\nHer first book as a historian, a biography of Florence Nightingale published in 1950, took her straight to the top of her profession. Her meticulous research had taken nine years, and the book succeeded in restoring Nightingale's reputation, which had dwindled following Lytton Strachey's representation of her in \"Eminent Victorians\". Acclaimed for its combination of scholarship and readability, \"Florence Nightingale\" won the James Tait Black Award for biography.\n\nHer next book was equally well received. \"The Reason Why\" (1953) was a study of the Charge of the Light Brigade, a military disaster during the Crimean War and one of the defining events of the Victorian age. It became her most popular book, and afterwards she explained to a television audience how she wrote the Charge itself: working at a gallop through thirty-six hours non-stop without food or other break until the last gun was fired, when she poured a stiff drink and slept for two days. Though the work was critically acclaimed, it came to the conclusion that the allies had lost the Crimean War, which most historians conclude is not true.\n\nShe produced two more notable works. The first was \"\" (1962), a history of the Great Irish Famine of the 1840s that was critical of the British government's handling of the famine, in particular singling out Sir Charles Edward Trevelyan for criticism, although she did acknowledge that the British government assisted during the first phase of the famine. The second was the first volume of \"Queen Victoria: Her Life and Times\" (1972). She was unable to complete the next volume of the biography, and died in London in 1977 at the age of 80.\n\nCecil Woodham-Smith was appointed CBE in 1960. She received honorary doctorates from the National University of Ireland in 1964 and the University of St Andrews in 1965. She also became an honorary fellow of St Hilda's College (her alma mater) in 1967.\n\nAlan Bennett wrote of her:\nCecil was a frail woman with a tiny bird-like skull, looking more like Elizabeth I (in later life) than Edith Sitwell ever did (and minus her sheet metal earrings). Irish, she had a Firbankian wit and a lovely turn of phrase. ‘Do you know the Atlantic at all?’ she once asked me and I put the line into \"Habeas Corpus\" and got a big laugh on it. From a grand Irish family she was quite snobbish; talking of someone she said: ‘Then he married a Mitford … but that’s a stage everybody goes through.’ Even the most ordinary remark would be given her own particular twist and she could be quite camp. Conversation had once turned, as conversations will, to fork-lift trucks. Feeling that industrial machinery might be remote from Cecil’s sphere of interest I said: ‘Do you know what a fork-lift truck is?’ She looked at me in her best Annie Walker manner. ‘I do. To my cost.’\n"}

Karski and Louis Kaliski, held its grand opening on March 6, 1926. On August 1, 1929, Abraham C. Karski and Louis Kaliski leased the theater to West Coast Theatres, Inc. for a period of 94 years, 4 months until November 30, 2023. The theater is still owned by descendants of Abraham C. Karski and Louis Kaliski; and is still under the original lease terms although the lease has been assigned twice (to Mann Theaters Corporation of California (who later became National General Theaters, Inc.) in 1973 and to the current tenant Renaissance Rialto, Inc. in 1980.)\n\nAfter the Grand Lake Theater opened on March 6, 1926, it held vaudeville and silent movie showings, but with the arrival of \"talkies\" it began to exclusively show sound films. The original Wurlitzer Hope Jones Unified Orchestral Organ by the Rudolph Wurlitzer Co. of San Francisco still stands in the main auditorium. The original phone number for the theater was Glencourt 3100 and the original ticket prices were 40 cents for night and Sunday matinees in the orchestra and balcony, 50 cents for the loges, 25 cents for daily matinees, and 10 cents for children at any performance.\n\nThe theater's exterior is surmounted by a giant illuminated rooftop sign which was originally furnished by Brumfield Electric Sign Co., Inc. Neoclassical faux columns and urns line the main interior space and the ceiling is adorned with a crystal chandelier in the lobby and classical frescos in the auditorium. The theater's interior artwork is considered to be Art Deco.\n\nAfter purchasing the lease in 1980, the current tenant, Renaissance Rialto, Inc., owned by Allen Michaan, spent $3.5 million on renovation and expansion. In 1981, the balcony of the auditorium was split into a second auditorium. In 1985, neighboring storefronts were purchased and attached to the theater. These were transformed into a small Egyptian Revival styled auditorium and a small Moorish styled auditorium. After the expansions of the 1980s, the Grand Lake Theatre had a total of four screens and 1619 seats. The main auditorium is also equipped with a Mighty Wurlitzer organ hidden beneath the floor. On Friday and Saturday evenings, the historical organ rises for a brief concert before the movie.\n\nMost recently, Allen Michaan has spent close to $300,000 to install twin 3-D projectors in two of the 84-year-old Oakland movie palace's theaters - similar to the state-of-the-art setup Pixar has in its private screening auditorium, and he also repainted the building at a cost of $170,000.\n\nThe Karski and Kaliski owners are preparing for the end of the theater's 94-year lease in 2023.\n\nThe sign mounted on top of the Grand Lake Theatre is the largest rotary contact sign west of the Mississippi River. It measures 52 feet (15.85m) high by 72 feet (21.95m) wide and consists of 2,800 colored bulbs and was designed by Theodore Wetteland. The firing sequence is controlled by a device much like a music box. The sign is typically lit Friday and Saturday, from dusk until the start of the last show of the night.\n\nCurrent tenant Michaan is known to use his liberal politics as a guide in managing the Grand Lake. In 2004, he publicly announced that the theater would not enforce the R rating of the political documentary \"Fahrenheit 9/11\". The Grand Lake has also received widespread recognition for Michaan's use of the marquee as a political message board. In outrage at the 2000 presidential election, he posted this message on the high-traffic side of the marquee: \"This Is America — Every Vote Should Be Counted\" Since then, and with much support from the local community, Michaan has regularly used one side of the theater's marquee to display a timely political message. In addition to films, the theater also occasionally hosts talks and events on progressive political issues.\n\nBetween the midterm elections of November 2006 and January 2007, no political messages were displayed on the marquee, instead devoting the space to the names of upcoming films. Messages began to appear again in early January, beginning with \"All that is necessary for the triumph of evil is that good men do nothing,\" a statement derived from Edmund Burke's 1770 speech to Parliament, \"Thoughts on the Cause of Present Discontents.\"\n\nOn September 9 and 10, 2009, the fifth 9/11 Film Festival was presented at the Grand Lake Theatre. The theater premiered Dylan Avery's \"Loose Change 9/11: An American Coup\", narrated by Daniel Sunjata and produced by Korey Rowe and Matthew Brown.\n\nOn November 2, 2011, the Grand Lake Theatre closed its doors in support of the Occupy Oakland general strike. The marquee read \"We proudly support the Occupy Wall Street Movement. Closed Wed. to support the strike.\" \n\n\"The Rachel Maddow Show\" featured the theater on November 2, 2011, as part of the video segment covering that day's Occupy Oakland protest and general strike. Maddow, a native of nearby Castro Valley, said that the Grand Lake Theatre was one of her favorite landmarks when she was growing up and is still a favorite of hers as an adult today. See the Rachel Maddow Show Nov 2nd transcript for her full statement about the Grand Lake Theatre.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It elected one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first-past-the-post system of election.\n\nThe constituency was created by merging the Ayr burgh and Prestwick burgh components of the Ayr District of Burghs constituency with parts of the South Ayrshire and Kilmarnock constituencies.\n\n1950 to 1974: The civil parishes of Ayr, Prestwick, Tarbolton and Symington.\n1974 to 1983: The civil parishes of Ayr (except rural area around Ayr Hospital), Prestwick, Tarbolton and Symington.\n\n1983 to 1997: The towns of Ayr (except the council estate of Kincaidston), Prestwick and Troon plus the villages of Dundonald, Loans, Monkton, Tarbolton and Symington.\n\n1997 to 2005: The 1995 South Ayrshire electoral wards of Dundonald; East Kyle; Fort; Lochside and Craigie; Heathfield; Kingscase; Newton; Seafield; St Cuthbert's; St Nicholas; Troon Central; Troon East; Troon West; Wallacetown and Whitletts, covering Dundonald, Loans, Monkton, Prestwick, Symington, Tarbolton, Troon and the north and west of Ayr. This change led to a substantial alteration in the demographic of the constituency with the Labour Party being the prime beneficiaries.\n\n2005 onwards: In 2005 the constituency was divided between the Central Ayrshire and Ayr, Carrick and Cumnock constituencies. This had a significant impact on the Conservative party by dividing their support in Ayr, Prestwick and Troon into two separate, predominantly Labour-voting constituencies, neither of which attained any considerable level of support for the Conservatives to match that of the Labour party. The town of Ayr joined two-thirds of the former Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley constituency to form Ayr, Carrick and Cumnock, with the remaining portion of the former Ayr constituency (based in Prestwick, Troon, Dundonald and Loans) joining Irvine, Annbank, Auchincruive, east Kilwinning and the remainder of Kyle to form Central Ayrshire.\n\nAt the 2017 general election Conservative candidate Bill Grant gained the Ayr, Carrick and Cumnock constituency with a 2,774 vote majority over the SNP's Corri Wilson.\n\nAt the Scottish Parliament the Ayr constituency has existed since the creation of the Scottish Parliament in 1999. The constituency retained the same boundaries as that of the former Ayr constituency at Westminster (1997-2005) until the 2011 First Periodic Review of Scottish Parliament Boundaries. The constituency is currently composed of the electoral wards of Ayr West, Ayr East, Ayr North, Prestwick and Troon, covering the towns of Ayr, Prestwick and Troon. The constituency has been represented by Conservative MSP John Scott since a by-election in 2000.\n\nIn 1987 Ayr became the most marginal Westminster constituency in Scotland and the fourth most marginal constituency in the United Kingdom, being won by Conservative George Younger by 182 votes.\n\nIn 1992 Ayr remained the most marginal constituency in Scotland and fourth most marginal constituency in the United Kingdom, being won by Conservative Phil Gallie with a majority of 85 votes. \n\nIn 1997 the boundaries of the Ayr seat were altered. Below is the notional result from the 1992 general election using the 1997 boundaries.\n"}

After releasing 2 albums worldwide, \"Rise from the Ashes\" (1998) and \"Eternal Crusade\" (2000), the band had changed their singer and formed Highland Glory.\n\nWith a fresh new start and an increased potential, the band developed their style of melodic metal in a heavier and more traditional direction on the debut album, \"From the Cradle to the Brave\" (2003). The artwork was created by Mark Wilkinson (famous for his work with Marillion, Fish, Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, etc.), who has worked for the band ever since. Still signed to Face Front (the label run by Frode Øien, chief editor of Scream Magazine) for Scandinavia, but the debut-album was licensed to Massacre Records for the rest of the world. The follow-up “Forever Endeavour” (2005) took the different aspects of the band's sound even further, showing a natural, yet darker and more atmospheric progression. In the autumn of 2007 singer Jan Thore Grefstad left the band, and was replaced by Trine Elise Johansen in the winter of 2008. The change from a male to a female singer naturally affected the band's sound, but the trademark still proved to be intact on the album \"Twist of Faith\" (2011), yet the band had developed in a more mid-tempo and even more melodic direction.

It stars Charlie Sheen, Kiefer Sutherland, Chris O'Donnell, Oliver Platt, Tim Curry, and Rebecca De Mornay.\n\nThe film is loosely based on the 1844 novel \"The Three Musketeers\" (\"Les Trois Mousquetaires\") by Alexandre Dumas. It recounts the adventures of d'Artagnan on his quest to join the three title characters in becoming a musketeer. However, this adaptation simplifies and alters the story.\n\nIn 1625, young-but-skilled fencer d'Artagnan sets off for Paris, France in hopes to follow in his murdered father's footsteps and become a member of the musketeers: the personal guard of the King of France. He is pursued by Gérard and his brothers, accused of blemishing their sister's honor. Unfortunately, Captain Rochefort of the Cardinal's Guards has disbanded the musketeers per the orders of Cardinal Richelieu, the King's Minister, ostensibly to help fight in an impending war with England. Rochefort informs Richelieu that three musketeers refused to relinquish their duties: Athos, Porthos, and Aramis.\n\nIn Paris, d’Artagnan “rescues” the queen’s handmaidens from their own bodyguards, and after a scolding, takes a liking to one, Constance. \nIn the city d’Artagnan has a series of physical encounters with the Three Musketeers, though he doesn't \"know\" they are musketeers, resulting in a duel with each. At the Ruins, Athos, Porthos and Aramis reveal themselves as musketeers to d'Artagnan's surprise. Before they can duel, a Captain of the Cardinal's Guard arrives to arrest the musketeers with five other cardinal’s guards; although d'Artagnan is not under arrest, he allies with the musketeers during the skirmish. The Musketeers kill four guards, while d’Artagnan accidentally hurls the Captain of the Guard down a huge cliff. Impressed but displeased at d'Artagnan's involvement, the musketeers leave d'Artagnan behind after encouraging him to flee and maintain his innocence. When more of the Cardinal's Guards arrive, d'Artagnan is captured.\n\nd'Artagnan eavesdrops on a conversation between Richelieu and the mysterious Milady de Winter whereupon he tasks her with delivering a signed treaty to England's Duke of Buckingham. d'Artagnan is unable to see her face before being caught by Rochefort; Richelieu orders him executed for refusing to give up the musketeers' location, but he is saved by the musketeers. As they flee, d'Artagnan reveals Richelieu's plans; they decide to find the spy and get the treaty to prove Richelieu's guilt.\n\nDuring a skirmish, the party splits up; d'Artagnan rides ahead to intercept the spy, but passes out from exhaustion. He wakes in a bed stripped of his weapons and clothes as Milady de Winter tries to seduce him. d'Artagnan speaks freely of his plans, not knowing she is the spy, and she seduces him to kiss her. She tries to kill him, but he convinces her to keep him alive. As her party tries to escape by boat to England, they are confronted by the musketeers. Milady attempts to run away but is stopped by Athos, who calls her Sabine; they had been lovers, but he regretfully betrayed her to the authorities when he found out she was branded for execution. The musketeers retrieve the treaty and Sabine is sentenced to beheading for killing her first husband, Lord de Winter; just before she is executed, Athos begs her forgiveness. Moved, she reveals the Cardinal's plans to assassinate the king at his birthday celebration before throwing herself off a cliff to her death.\n\nAthos, Porthos and Aramis send missives to rally the rest of the musketeers. Richelieu and Rochefort hired a sharpshooter; during the assembly, d'Artagnan makes the sniper's shot go wide, narrowly missing the king. Richelieu deflects blame to the three musketeers in the crowd for the attempted assassination.\n\nAs the three face off with the Cardinal's guards, men rush to their sides and reveal themselves as musketeers. The two forces battle as Richelieu takes the king and queen hostage, shooting Aramis in the chest before fleeing to the dungeon with Athos and Porthos in pursuit. d'Artagnan duels Rochefort and is disarmed; as Rochefort gloats about having killed d'Artagnan's father, Constance passes his sword back and d'Artagnan promptly kills Rochefort.\n\nAthos and Porthos arrive just as Richelieu's boat leaves on an underground river. Although his plans are foiled, Richelieu claims he will be back. The boatman then reveals himself as Aramis, his crucifix having stopped the bullet. Aramis attempts to apprehend the Cardinal, but King Louis stops him to punch Richelieu himself, knocking him into the river.\n\nThe musketeers are reinstated by the king, and d'Artagnan is offered anything he wants; he chooses to serve Louis as a musketeer. Outside the musketeer headquarters, Gérard and his brothers arrive and challenge d'Artagnan to a duel; Porthos reminds him that musketeers not only protect King and country, but also each other. Gérard and his brothers are then chased off by the entire musketeer division.\n\nCharlie Sheen was originally sought for the role of Porthos before he was cast as Aramis. Kiefer Sutherland, Chris O'Donnell and Oliver Platt all endured six weeks of fencing and riding lessons. Sheen missed this training as he was still filming \"Hot Shots! Part Deux\". Brad Pitt and Stephen Dorff turned down the role of d'Artagnan, which ultimately went to O'Donnell. William Baldwin, Jean-Claude Van Damme, Al Pacino, Johnny Depp, Cary Elwes and Gary Oldman were also sought out by Disney for parts in the film. Winona Ryder was considered for the role of Milady de Winter, but dropped out and Rebecca De Mornay was cast. \"The Three Musketeers\" was mostly shot in Perchtoldsdorf, Austria, where De Mornay attended high school and college. A rival TriStar version was also in development at the same time as this film, with Depp and director Jeremiah S. Chechik attached. Ultimately, it fell through. Oliver Platt had also been approached to play Porthos in that version as well.\n\nFilming locations included Charlestown, Cornwall, UK, and Castle Landsee (Burgenland); Burg Liechtenstein, Maria Enzersdorf, Hinterbrühl, Korneuburg (Lower Austria); and Vienna (particularly Hofburg) in Austria. Some sequences were shot in Cornwall, UK. A small woods called Golitha Falls was used in one sequence when the musketeers are being pursued by guards. The small harbor village of Charlestown is home to the galleon that was used in a night-shoot.\n\nFilm critic Leonard Maltin christened this version \"Young Swords\", as it reunited Sheen and Sutherland, both of \"Young Guns\" fame. Janet Maslin of \"The New York Times\" described the movie as \"Conceived frankly as a product, complete with hit-to-be theme song over the closing credits, this adventure film cares less about storytelling than about keeping the Musketeers' feathered hats on straight whenever they go galloping.\"\n\nThe film received a generally negative reception from critics but a more mixed reception from the general public. The Rotten Tomatoes website gives it only a 28% rating from 29 reviews, but on the IMDb website it holds a more favorable 6.4/10 and on Amazon.com it currently holds a rating of 4.3/5.\n\nChris O'Donnell was nominated for a Golden Raspberry Award as Worst Supporting Actor for his work in the film, but lost to Woody Harrelson for \"Indecent Proposal\".\n\nThe film grossed $11.5 million for the Friday to Sunday weekend, placing it at number 1 at the box office.\n\nBryan Adams co-wrote \"All for Love\" with Robert John \"Mutt\" Lange and Michael Kamen for the movie's end credits, performing it with Rod Stewart and Sting. As Janet Maslin predicted, the song was a big hit (reaching #1 in North America and several other territories). Kamen also composed the movie's score, conducting the Greater Los Angeles All Star Orchestra.\n\nThe soundtrack album was released on compact disc and cassette on November 12, 1993 by Hollywood Records in North America and A&M Records (the label to which both Adams and Sting were signed at the time) elsewhere.\n\n\n\n"}

The mountain around the gorge itself and the stones spread across its bottom consist largely of grey-brown and dark-brown porphyritic rock with elements of quartz and red feldspar. Several species of moss grow in and around the gorge, including \"Junger-mannia orcandesis\" and \"Steodon inponens\". \n\nIn the middle of the gorge is a loose rock that can be removed to reveal a guestbook signed by other visitors (the exact location is marked by a small sign). In the summer, the temperature at the bottom of the gorge is typically somewhat lower than the area around the gorge, and in certain extreme years, pockets of snow and ice have remained until well into the summer.

It was founded by Dr. Joseph Kennedy and C. Payne Lucas in 1970, former Peace Corps members who worked in eastern Niger.\nAfricare is the largest and oldest African-American founded international NGO focused exclusively on the continent of Africa. Since 1970, Africare has been improving lives and building a better future by partnering with local communities, focusing on agriculture and food security, healthcare, maternal and child health, HIV/AIDS, access to potable water, and women's empowerment. In more than 40 years of building partnerships with local communities, NGOs, governments and the private sector, Africare has invested over $1 billion in more than 35 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nThe organization employs men and women who are largely indigenous to the countries or to the areas where it works. More than 98% of the staff is of African descent and about 30 staff and volunteers work at the organization's headquarters in the Washington, D.C.\n\nAfricare's programs address needs mostly in the areas of food security and agriculture, health and HIV/AIDS, water and sanitation, and emergency and humanitarian aid. Africare also supports water resource development, environmental resource management, basic education, microenterprise development, governance initiatives, and women's empowerment.\n\nAfricare currently has active programs in Angola, Benin, Burkina Faso, Chad, Ghana, Liberia, Malawi, Mali, Mozambique, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, South Africa, Tanzania, and Zimbabwe.\n\nIn 1970, when Africare was founded, West Africa was in the midst of one of the most severe droughts in its history. Among those providing help—medical aid to the Maine-Soroa town Hospital in Diffa, Niger—were 17 American volunteers, led by William O. Kirker, M.D., and Barbara Jean A. Kirker, who named their group \"Africare\". The Kirkers themselves had been working in Africa to improve African healthcare since 1966, but eventually they needed more support. Diori Hamani, then president of the Republic of Niger, appealed to the United States on the effort's behalf, asking, \"Why don't black Americans, whose ancestors came from the continent, respond to the needs in Africa?\"\n\nC. Payne Lucas, then the director of the Peace Corps Office of Returned Volunteers in Washington, D.C. served previously in Niger and knew the president from that time. Lucas and others decided to form an organization to answer Hamani's appeal.\n\nIn 1970, Africare was incorporated in Hawaii, with Kirker as its founder and first president. In 1971, Africare was permanently reincorporated in Washington, D.C. Lucas became the executive director (later, that title changed to \"president\"), and Kirker joined the Board. In addition to Kirker and Lucas, other incorporators were Oumarou G. Youssoufou, a Nigerian diplomat, and Joseph C. Kennedy, Ph.D., then in the Peace Corps. It began with a $39,550 budget, a U.S. headquarters in the basement of Lucas's home and one project in Niger.\n\nAfricare first concentrated on helping to alleviate the effects of severe drought in West Africa. By the mid-1970s, Africare had shifted its emphasis to development programs in the areas of food, water, the environment and health—expanding in the late 1980s to include microenterprise development, governance, basic education and, as it became necessary, HIV/AIDS response, as well as emergency humanitarian aid.\n\nThe President and CEO of Africare since November, 2015, is Robert L. Mallett. He develops Africare's strategic vision in a new environment for development assistance. He articulates Africare's unique guiding philosophy and value proposition. Mr. Mallett has a diverse background in law, government, public policy, healthcare and international development. Before joining Africare in late 2015, Mr. Mallett served on the Board of Directors for seven years and as President and CEO at Accordia Global Health Foundation which has just merged with Africare. He was a senior corporate executive at two of the world's largest companies. He was Executive Vice President and General Counsel for the Public & Senior Markets Group at United Healthcare and at Pfizer Inc. he served as Senior Vice President of Worldwide Public Affairs and Policy and as President of the Pfizer Foundation.

Normally, beams of light pass through each other unperturbed. Inside an optical material, and if the intensity of the beams is high enough, the beams may affect each other through a variety of non-linear effects. In pure vacuum, some weak scattering of light by light exists as well. Also, above some threshold of this center-of-mass energy of the system of the two photons, matter can be created.\n\nPhoton–photon scattering limits the spectrum of observed gammas to a photon energy below 80 TeV, that is, a wavelength of more than ~ . The other photon is one of the many photons of the cosmic microwave background. In the frame of reference where the invariant mass of the two photons is at rest, both photons are gammas with just enough energy to pair-produce an electron–positron pair.\n\nTwo-photon physics can be studied with high-energy particle accelerators, where the accelerated particles are not the photons themselves but charged particles that will radiate photons. The most significant studies so far were performed at the Large Electron–Positron Collider (LEP) at CERN. If the transverse momentum transfer and thus the deflection is large, one or both electrons can be detected; this is called tagging. The other particles that are created in the interaction are tracked by large detectors to reconstruct the physics of the interaction.\n\nFrequently, photon-photon interactions will be studied via ultraperipheral collisions (UPCs) of heavy ions, such as gold or lead. These are collisions in which the colliding nuclei do not touch each other; i.e., the impact parameter formula_1 is larger than the sum of the radii of the nuclei. The strong interaction between the quarks composing the nuclei is thus greatly suppressed, making the weaker electromagnetic formula_2 interaction much more visible. In UPCs, because the ions are heavily charged, it is possible to have two independent interactions between a single ion pair, such as production of two electron-positron pairs. UPCs are studied with the STARlight simulation code.\n\nLight-by-light scattering can be studied using the strong electromagnetic fields of the hadrons collided at the LHC, it has first been seen in 2016 by the ATLAS collaboration and was then confirmed by the CMS collaboration. The best previous constraint on the elastic photon–photon scattering cross section was set by PVLAS, which reported an upper limit far above the level predicted by the Standard Model. Observation of a cross section larger than that predicted by the Standard Model could signify new physics such as axions, the search of which is the primary goal of PVLAS and several similar experiments.\n\nFrom quantum electrodynamics it can be found that photons cannot couple directly to each other, since they carry no charge, but they can interact through higher-order processes:\na photon can, within the bounds of the uncertainty principle, fluctuate into a virtual charged fermion–antifermion pair, to either of which the other photon can couple. This fermion pair can be leptons or quarks. Thus, two-photon physics experiments can be used as ways to study the photon structure, or, somewhat metaphorically, what is \"inside\" the photon.\n\nThere are three interaction processes:\nThe intrinsic quark content of the photon is described by the photon structure function, experimentally analyzed in deep-inelastic electron–photon scattering.\n\nFor the latter two cases, the scale of the interaction is such as the strong coupling constant is large. This is called \"Vector Meson Dominance\" (VMD) and has to be modelled in non-perturbative QCD.\n\n\n"}

Mediacorp first presented in 1994 took place at the Caldecott Broadcast Centre, MediaCorp TV Theatre hosted by Chen Shucheng and Yvette Tsui.\n\nThe 25th Star Awards ceremony, honoring best Television of 2018 will be held on April 14, 2019, at the Mediacorp Campus, MES Theatre @ Mediacorp. The ceremony will be broadcast live on Toggle, Mediacorp Channel 8 and Mediacorp Channel U. The Nominees were announced on February 8, 2019, Friday.\n\nThe 1st Star Awards presentation was held on 26 February 1994, took place at the Caldecott Broadcast Centre, MediaCorp TV Theatre with an audience of about 500 people. There have no other pre-show and post-awards ceremony held in that year. Winners were announced during the presentation of the ceremony, the ceremony also presented a popularity contest, with Li Nanxing, Chew Chor Meng and Zoe Tay winning the Most Popular Actor and Actress award, respectively.\n\nAt the Inaugural \"Star Awards\" ceremony in 1994; Chew Chor Meng, Li Nanxing, Terence Cao, Sean Say, and Desmond Sim received the award as the Top 5 Most Popular Male Artistes award while Chen Liping, Chen Xiuhuan, Pan Lingling, Aileen Tan, and Zoe Tay received the award as the Top 5 Most Popular Female Artistes and it is given in honour of Mediacorp artistes who were deemed as the top five most popular among the television audience. The nominees and winners are determined and selected by a majority vote from the public via telephone and SMS text voting. Between 1994–1996, only the top five male artistes were given the award.\n\nAlso, \"The Unbeatables\" (Chinese: 双天至尊) received the award and it is given in honour of a Mediacorp drama serial which has delivered an outstanding overall performance. The nominees are determined by a team of judges employed by Mediacorp; winners are selected by a majority vote from the entire judging panel.\n\nSince 1994, the ceremony used a sealed envelope to reveal the name of the winners, as in tradition of most award ceremonies.\n\nThe first Best Actress awarded was Fann Wong, in her performances in \"Chronicle of Life\" (Chinese: 缘尽今生) as Fang Ling 方玲 in the drama. Fann Wong is the first leading actress who have won this award since the awards was introduced in the 1995 ceremony. At the same ceremony; Li Nanxing received the award for his role in \"Wounded Tracks\" (Chinese: 伤城记) and it is given in honour of a Mediacorp actor who has delivered an outstanding performance in a leading role. Also, Zhu Xiufeng received the award for her supporting role in \"Chronicle of Life\" (Chinese: 缘尽今生) and it is given in honour of a Mediacorp actress who has delivered an outstanding performance in a supporting role in the 2nd year of the Star Awards ceremony.\n\nBetween 1995 and 2003, the Special Achievement Award is given to one artiste who have made significant contributions in the performance of his/her respective field of profession over the past few years. The award was discontinued in 2004 until it revived again in 2018 with Marcus Chin receiving the award. Also, each ceremony ends with the Best Actor and Actress award, but recent ceremonies' last award would be Top 10 Most Popular Male or Female Artistes award, a popularity contest open for all nominated Mediacorp Artistes.\n\nBeginning in the 1998 ceremony, the variety categories were introduced in the awards, and variety programmes, as well as the artistes playing a role in these programmes were now made eligible; these includes Sitcoms, Variety Programme Hosts, and Variety Special (an one-off episode with a longer runtime, such as awards ceremony or live finals). For the first time in the awards' history, Technical Categories were also presented, but they were taped outside the ceremony on a separate date, and presented on a clip montage due to time constraints; these practice would later be done on later years except for 2010-15, where it was done on a single show instead. The 2000 ceremony further added awards in recognition to News and Current Affairs team and the Top Rated Drama Serial and Variety Programme.\n\nBeginning in the 2004 ceremony, the All-Time Favourite Artiste Award was introduced in the place of Special Achievement Award. Chew Chor Meng, Li Nanxing and Zoe Tay received the award after winning the Top 10 Most Popular Male or Female Artistes award from 1994–2003. It is given in honour of an artiste who has won the Top 10 Most Popular Male Artistes or Top 10 Most Popular Female Artistes for ten times (not necessary to be consecutive). Artistes who receive the award will no longer be eligible for the running of the respective Top 10 Most Popular Male or Female Artistes awards from that particular year onwards, allowing younger MediaCorp artistes have a chance to win the popularity awards as well. 21 artistes had won the All-Time Favourite Artiste award since its award inception, and it have been awarded in almost every year except 2007, 2013 and 2018.\n\nThe ceremonies were held annually in April to honour television talents from works from the previous year; prior to the 2007 ceremony, the ceremony were held at the end of the year while there is no ceremony in 2008 due to a format change.\n\nIn the 2010 ceremony, held in 2010, introduced the six awards, Favourite Male Character, Favourite Female Character, Most Unforgettable TV Villain, Male Media Darling, Female Media Darling and Rocket Award. The first three awards were decided by online voting with the results being announced during the first ceremony. The Rocket Award was also introduced, which mainly focuses on the artiste who contributed the most improvement throughout the past year.\n\nIn 2014, the 20th Star Awards ceremony was held. The title of the Star Awards also short-formed to \"Star Awards 20\" as a remarkable awards night. The first ceremony was held at the MediaCorp TV Theatre with the veteran artistes; Chen Shucheng who was the first Star Awards hosts came back as a co-hosts after 20 years hosting the first ceremony. Samuel Chong, Dasmond Koh, Vivian Lai, Lee Teng, Pornsak, Zhang Wei and Zhou Ruzhu and was held at the MediaCorp TV Theatre. Social Media Award and The Most Popular Regional Artiste Award were introduced at the ceremony. The second ceremony was held at Suntec Singapore International Convention and Exhibition Centre with hosts Guo Liang and Quan Yi Fong. As of the most recent ceremony, it was the last time the ceremony was held outside Mediacorp Studios.\n\n2014 also saw a revision of quota towards the category, as categories requires at least ten nominations in order to be presented; this caused three awards, Best News Presenter, Best Current Affairs Presenter, and Best Newcomer, to be temporarily suspended. However, despite 8World (renamed from the Channel 8 News and Current Affairs Team in January 2019) had fulfilled the minimum quota of 10 nominations, these awards have yet to be presented since its last presentation in 2013, while Best Newcomer returned except for 2016 and 2017, both of which were not presented due to the same reason.\n\nIn 2015, both ceremony was held in 19 April 2015 and 26 April 2015. It's the last year that Mediacorp presented the awards at the venue of Caldecott Broadcast Centre, MediaCorp TV Theatre (hence the Caldecott subtitle was present in the name of ceremony). Both ceremonies were held in the venue before moving to MediaCorp campus at 1 Stars Avenue for the next ceremony.\n\nAt the 2016 ceremony, the Professional and Technical awards have been moved to a backstage awards and also the last time it held a double ceremony (not counting prelude or special episodes). The online Favourite award categories were held for the final time, with Jeanette Aw nominated again for Favourite Female Character and Favourite Onscreen Couple (Drama). Aw won six voting-based awards in Show 1 in 2015 including three Most Popular Regional Artiste Awards, Social Media Award and Favourite Female Character award for her role in \"\". Aw expressed her intention to be removed from the voting, but was rejected as Mediacorp said that the awards were determined though online voting, and still requiring her to participate. There was a change in lineup of the awards streamlined to 19 categories. A new category, 'Best Programme Host', was created with a merger of two hosting awards (Best Variety Show Host and Best Info-Ed Programme Host) due to a similar presentation style in both the variety and info-ed programmes, as well as similar eligibility criteria. 'Best Evergreen Artiste', which was based on the performances for drama veterans, was also introduced in 2016.\n\nAt the 2017 ceremony, online voting categories were also streamlined, by putting more emphasis placed on the Top 10 Most Popular Artiste awards, while the Favourite Male and Female Character, and Favourite Onscreen Couple awards, as well as Social Media Award were dropped due to the change. Due to the switch in measuring television viewership, the Top Rated Variety Programme and Top Rated Drama Serial awards were also suspended.\n\nThe 2018 ceremony saw revamps towards the Top 10 Popularity Awards, whereas a poll of 1,000 people representing a wide demographic across Singapore's population, were conducted independently by an accredited market research company, will be used to shortlist the nominations. The results of the poll weighed 50% towards the combined total, while the other 50% comes from the public vote (with 50% weighed on telepoll and online votes each). Eligibility criteria for performance and popularity categories were also revised; eligible artistes were now required to lead a role in a programme or play as a supporting role/assistant host in at least three eligible programmes or at least 30 episodes out of all eligible programmes, whichever applicable. Best Evergreen Artiste were also accessed on veteran artistes based on a full calendar year, as opposed to a single programme.\n\nThe 2019 and most recent ceremony, which celebrates the silver jubilee of the ceremony on 14 April 2019, introduced two categories to feature miniseries, which were the Best Short-form Drama Serial and Best Short-form Variety Programme.\n\nThe upcoming edition of the \" Star Awards 2020\", initially scheduled to be held on 26 April 2020, would be postponed to the second half of 2020 due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. This became the first ceremony in 13 years since the revision of the eligibility period in 2008 where the ceremony would not be held on the month of April.\n\nPreviously, technical category awards (e.g. Best Director, Best Screenplay, Best Variety Show Producer, etc.), newscaster and current affairs awards and, for a time, the Young Talent Award (for child actors) were held separately at a gala dinner (or afternoon conference) due to time constraints and results and clips from the event would be shown either during the ceremony, or live-streaming before the ceremony. Between 2010 and 2015, and again in 2017, those technical awards were presented in Show 1 (or during the three prelude episodes, in 2017), while the Show 2 presented the main awards. Since 2016 (with the exception for 2017), the format was reverted with the technical category awards presented at an off-site ceremony.\n\nThe Star Awards trophy has seen four different designs, since its inception in 1994. In the first ceremony, The trophy was designed with a circular column and a star-shaped circle capping the top. This trophy only been used in only in this 1994 ceremony. Between 1995 until 1997 ceremony, the trophy was designed with a straight column topped and a gold star. This trophy had been used in three ceremonies. The trophy was changed to a cone-like shape with a bigger star in the ceremony of 1998 and 1999.\n\nSince 2000, A new trophy made in Shanghai was designed, weighing 4 kg and cost S$1,000 each. It is designed with a crystal body shaped in the letter \"S\", and from another angle, shaped in the letter \"A\", forming the initials of the \"Star Awards\". The trophy used to come in different colors every year.\n\nTo date, 25 ceremonies were held, as summarised below:\nThe following individuals have hosted (or co-hosted) the Star Awards ceremony on two or more occasions.\n\nThe major awards are presented at a live televised ceremony, commonly in April following the relevant calendar year in order to focus on the full calendar year; prior to the 2007 ceremony, the ceremony were held at the end of the year (usually December) while there is no ceremony in 2008 due to a format change.\n\n2007 was the first ceremony to have a double ceremony, one that paid tribute to the 25th Anniversary of television, and a second ceremony being the normal ceremony. Between 2010 and 2015, the Professional and Technical awards (given out to backstage crew and scriptwriters) were telecast and presented in the first show, and the main awards on the second, airing the following week. While the first show was still held at MediaCorp TV Theatre, the second show was, for the third time in Star Awards history, being held on the new location of Resorts World Sentosa, after 1996 and 2006. Both of the ceremonies were broadcast live on 18 and 25 April 2010. The post-show was held after the second ceremony at 10pm on Channel U.\n\nIn 2016, although the show was a two-part program, the technical awards was, for the first time since 2009, presented in an off-site non-televised presentation instead of being presented live in show 1. In their place, the main ceremony (which was presented in show 2) was also split into two shows, allowing to put more emphasis on mostly variety/info-ed award categories and drama award categories, for shows 1 and 2, respectively. The Post-show Party, airing after show 2, focuses on online voting award categories. For the first time in \"Star Awards\" history, the awards for the Top 10 Artistes were presented in separate shows instead of single show, with the female artistes awarded in show 1, and the male artistes on show 2.\n\nAt the 2017 ceremony, in a gap of eight installments since 2009, the ceremony was revert to one show, and the post-show party was scrapped. In-lieu of the \"3+1\" change, a three-episode weekly preludes aired on Sundays before the main ceremony. The preludes were removed in 2018.\n\nWith the merger of MediaCorp with SPH MediaWorks on 1 January 2005, nominees now include artistes and shows from MediaCorp Channel U, formerly MediaWork's Chinese language channel, and were broadcast for said channel since. Between 2010 and 2014, xinmsn provided its first online Live streaming for both the ceremony as well as backstage, and since 2013, Toggle (both the website and the smartphone/smart TV application). However, these streams were only viewable exclusive to Singapore. Starting from the 2019 ceremony, YouTube will also broadcast live streaming for the awards as well, and is viewable to the world.\n\nIn 1994, the first Star Awards were presented at the Caldecott Broadcast Centre, MediaCorp TV Theatre and the following year until 2015; however, seven ceremonies were held outside the studios: in 1996, the venue of \"Star Awards\" changed to World Trade Centre, Harbour Pavilion and was hosted by Guo Liang and Yvette Tsui. In 2006, the ceremony was held at St James Power Station, near VivoCity and Sentosa. Between 2010 and 2014, the ceremony was also held outside location while the show was split into two, with the first show held at Caldecott Hill, while the second show was held at Resorts World Sentosa (2010 and 2011), Marina Bay Sands (2012 and 2013) and Suntec City (2014).\n\nIn 2016, the awards had since held at the new Mediacorp Campus, MES Theatre @ Mediacorp, and it became the presentation's current venue with incredibly spacious interior and stunning architectural designs, the 1,500-seater performance venue features tiered seating in its stalls and two circle levels, including removable seats at the lower stall and additional audience sitting space at the orchestra pit for your special needs.\n\nJudged Categories\nPopularity Categories<br>\nNote: Before 1997, the number of recipients for the Most Popular Artistes were five.\nTechnical Categories<br>\nNote: All the categories were introduced in 1998 (unless otherwise stated), and these awards were presented outside broadcast except for 2010-2015, where it was presented on one show.\nA number of awards have either suspended or retired throughout the years, including some that have been replaced by similar award categories in other areas of recognition:\n\nRetired Categories\nOne-off Categories\n\nSuspended Categories\nAs of :\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Star Awards\" had been nominated for 15 times since the Best Variety Special category was introduced in 1998 (with the exceptions for five shows, the award was not presented in years 2000 and 2018; while the ceremony were not nominated in years 1999, 2001 and 2006). As of 2018, Seven shows, out of the total 21 ceremonies since 1997 were won, with their first win in 2007 which was awarded for the 2006's ceremony.

He is perhaps best known for his appearances with the Universal Wrestling Federation and the World Class Wrestling Association in the mid-1980s, with World Championship Wrestling between 1988 and 1991 and with Extreme Championship Wrestling between 1998 and 2001.\n\nRinehurst debuted in 1984 in the Oklahoma City, Oklahoma-based Universal Wrestling Federation under the ring name Jack Victory. He went on to wrestle throughout the Southeastern United States. Early in his career, Victory accompanied The Sheepherders to ringside while carrying the New Zealand flag.\n\nVictory formed a tag team with John Tatum. Managed by Tatum's girlfriend, Missy Hyatt, Victory and Tatum won the UWF Tag Team Championship in 1986. Victory, Tatum and Hyatt joined \"Hot Stuff International\", a stable headed by \"Hot Stuff\" Eddie Gilbert.\n\nIn 1985, Victory began appearing with the Texas-based World Class Championship Wrestling promotion. He won the WCCW Television Championship from David Peterson in December 1985, losing the title to Mark Youngblood less than a month later.\n\nVictory and Tatum won the WCWA Texas Tag Team Championship on three occasions in 1988, trading the titles with Shaun and Steve Simpson. On the 30th of November 1987, Victory and Tatum also teamed together in the Fort Worth, Texas-based Wild West Wrestling (where they won the WWW Tag Team Championship in 1987). Victory and John Tatum defeated Missing Link and Jeff Raitz in a tournament final to become the first champions of the Wild west tag team championships. These titles would unify with the WCCW tag team championships on the 12th of October 1988.\n\nIn the late 1980s, Victory began wrestling for Jim Crockett Promotions as Jacko Victory, where he formed a tag team with Rip Morgan known as The New Zealand Militia.\n\nAt the 1989 NWA pay-per-view Chi-Town Rumble, Victory replaced Dennis Condrey as Randy Rose and Paul E. Dangerously's tag team partner. The three men were defeated by the Midnight Express and Jim Cornette in a losing team leaves the NWA match. Victory wrestled at four Clash of the Champions events in 1989, appearing as the masked heel jobbers Russian Assassin #2, The Blackmailer, The Terrorist and The Super Destroyer. In the same year, Victory and Morgan were repackaged as The Royal Family and given a manager, Lord Littlebrook. They wrestled for Jim Crockett Promotions, by then renamed World Championship Wrestling, until their contracts expired and they were released in the early 1990s. In 1990, Victory briefly wrestled for WCW as Jacko Victory. In 1991 Victory and Morgan made their way to the Global Wrestling Federation in Dallas Texas this time as The Maulers. Wrestling as the Maulers, Victory and Morgan also wrestled a dark match at a \"WWF Superstars\" taping in Mobile, Alabama on March 9, 1992, defeating Jim Cooper and John Allen.\n\nFrom 1991 to 1998, Victory wrestled on the independent circuit.\n\nIn 1998, Victory debuted in Extreme Championship Wrestling as a mercenary hired to assault New Jack. His wrestling ended for ECW when he broke his leg at 1998's November to Remember in a tag team match pitting himself and Justin Credible against Tommy Dreamer and Jake \"The Snake\" Roberts when he was backdropped over the top rope by Dreamer. While using a wheelchair for rehabilitation, Victory became the manager of Steve Corino. When his leg healed, Victory began interfering in Corino's matches on behalf of his client. Along with Corino, Victory was a member of the stable known as The Network. He remained in ECW until the promotion declared bankruptcy in April 2001, defeating C.W. Anderson on the promotion's last ever show in January.\n\nFollowing the closure of ECW, Victory began wrestling on the independent circuit. Along with several other ECW alumni, he made several appearances with the Premier Wrestling Federation, winning the PWF Tag Team Championship in February 2002 and the PWF Xtreme Championship in August 2002. In 2004, Victory appeared regularly with Pro-Pain Pro Wrestling.\n\n"}

However, St. Ignatius Loyola had always regarded her with suspicion. Falling dangerously ill in 1543, Magdalena confessed that her stigmata and claims of performing miracles were fraudulent. She was sentenced by the Inquisition, in an auto-da-fé at Córdoba in 1546, to perpetual imprisonment in a convent of her order, and there she is believed to have ended her days most piously amid marks of the sincerest repentance.\n\nDuring the early decades of the sixteenth century she was considered saintly and believed to be in constant and intimate communication with God. Her devotees included the general of the Franciscan Order, Fray Francisco de los Ángeles Quiñones; Fray Francisco de Osuna, the mystic whose writings were so appreciated by Saint Teresa of Ávila; and the archbishop of Seville and inquisitor general, Alonso Manrique. Indeed, on the birth of the future Philip II in 1527, \"the hábitos of this nun were sent off as a sacred object so that the infante could be wrapped up in them and thus apparently be shielded and protected from the attacks of the Devil.\" In 1533 Magdalena was elected abbess of her convent and was at the height of her power and popularity. But only in 1546, and after many false prophecies, visions, and miracles, including a controversial pregnancy, did the Cordoban Inquisition finally try her and sentence her to life imprisonment in a convent in Andújar.\n\nAccording to Montague Summers, Magdalena went to the \"pope (Paul III) as a Penitent, and confessed her sins, that at twelve years old the Devil solicited her, and lay with her, and that he had layen with her for thirty years; yet she was made the Abbess of a Monastery, and counted a saint. [...] She died full of sorrow and deeply contrite, in 1560. It may be remarked that on her confession of imposture and guilt, seventeen years before, the demoniacal stigmata disappeared\". The book mentions a Spanish manuscript, kept at the British Museum, and referred to Magdalena de la Cruz, Abbess of the Poor Clares Monastery of St. Isabel of the Angels, which was sentenced by the Holy Inquisition of Cordoba on 3 May 1546.\n\nIn Cordoba, it is located the Convent of Saint Isabel of the Angels ().\n\n"}

He is best known for his tenure with World Championship Wrestling (WCW) from 1993 to 1999 under the ring names Scotty Riggs and Riggs. Antol is also known for his appearances with Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) as Scotty Anton.\n\nAntol debuted on June 2, 1992 using the ring name Scott Studd after being trained by Ted \"The Nightmare\" Allen. Allen trained Studd by teaching while wrestling in front of live crowds. In the early 1990s, he worked for various independent promotions, including the North Georgia Wrestling Association (NGWA), Peach State Championship Wrestling (PSCW), Smoky Mountain Wrestling (SMW), and the United States Wrestling Association (USWA).\n\nAntol signed a contract with World Championship Wrestling in 1995 and was renamed Scotty Riggs, with his last name taken from Mel Gibson's character, Martin Riggs, from the \"Lethal Weapon\" films. He was immediately placed in to a tag team with Marcus Alexander Bagwell and they became known as The American Males. Together, they captured their first and only World Tag Team Championship, but only held it for eight days before losing it back to Harlem Heat, the team they won it from in the first place. The team competed on a tour of Germany for WCW at this time.\n\nThe American Males broke up in November 1996 after Bagwell turned heel on Riggs and joined the New World Order. Following the split, Riggs began competing as a singles competitor. He immediately entered a feud with Bagwell, which resulted in a match at nWo Souled Out which he lost and a rematch at Uncensored in a strap match where Riggs was choked out by Bagwell with the strap while hanging from the ropes.\n\nAfter performing in the mid-card for most of 1997, Raven took an interest in him and during a No Disqualification match on the October 27 edition of \"Nitro\", Raven caught Riggs in a drop toe-hold, sending him face-first into a steel chair and injuring his eye in the process. Riggs then began wearing an eye patch and, to this day, claims that the eye injury was legitimate. At first, Riggs resisted joining Raven's Flock, but eventually joined after they kidnapped him following his loss to Raven at the World War 3 pay-per-view. Raven explained that Riggs's \"ocular disability\" had alienated him from society and that he was seeking acceptance within The Flock. Riggs remained within The Flock until Saturn defeated Raven at Fall Brawl: War Games in a match that forced The Flock to disband.\n\nFollowing The Flock's disbanding, Riggs turned heel and adopted a narcissistic gimmick. However, the gimmick was unsuccessful, and Riggs remained on the undercard before being released from WCW in 1999.\n\nIn 2000, Antol debuted in Extreme Championship Wrestling as Scotty Anton, aligning with his real-life friend Rob Van Dam. At Hardcore Heaven, Anton betrayed Van Dam, knocking him off the top rope to the floor, allowing Jerry Lynn to pin him and thus end Van Dam's two-year undefeated streak. From there, he joined The Network as a \"hired gun\". Van Dam gained revenge at Heat Wave, where he defeated Anton by using his new \"Van Terminator\" finisher.\n\nAfter leaving ECW, Antol returned to the independent circuit, where he found his greatest success in Turnbuckle Championship Wrestling (TCW). While competing for TCW, he became a three time Heavyweight Champion and a one time TCW Tag Team Champion with Erik Watts. Following TCW's closure in 2003, Antol took time away from professional wrestling to deal with personal issues of divorce and his father developing lung cancer. His father died from the illness in 2004. Following this, Antol moved to Hilton Head Island, South Carolina to work as a bouncer and manager at a lounge.\n\nUpon getting his life together, Antol resumed his wrestling career under his Scotty Riggs ring name, where he wrestled several matches for AWA World-1 Championship Wrestling in 2007 before retiring in 2009 due to injuries. He briefly returned later in 2009 to appear in TNA's Feast or Fired match at Final Resolution, but was unable to retrieve a briefcase and was released from the company two weeks later after he was found to have stolen Rob Terry's case, dedicating the stunt to his former tag team partner, Marcus Bagwell.\n\n"}

{"id": "1962999", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1962999", "title": "Swansea Vale Railway", "text": "Swansea Vale Railway\n\nThe Swansea Vale Railway (SVR) was a railway line connecting the port of Swansea in South Wales to industries and coalfields along the River Tawe on the northern margin of Swansea, by taking over a tramroad in 1846. It was extended to Brynamman in 1868. Passengers were carried from 1860, and a loop line through Morriston was built.\n\nThe company was profitable but it was always short of capital, and it looked for a larger company to buy it out. The Midland Railway did so in 1874 when it leased the network, and it absorbed it in 1876. The Midland Railway used the line to get access to Swansea, which it had long sought. After 1923 the Midland's successor transferred the through traffic to another route.\n\nRoad omnibus services abstracted much of the local passenger business, and only anthracite traffic kept the line going. When that industry declined the railway mineral traffic followed, and from 1965 closures set in. Parts of the network continued for a time, but by 1983 the entire line was closed.\n\nThe South Wales coalfield extends to the sea at Swansea, and therefore was immediately accessible to shipping at a time, before the nineteenth century, when land transport was limited to what pack animals could carry on their backs.\n\nAt that time the extraction of copper in Cornwall became an important industry, and as a great deal of coal is required to smelt copper, it became the practice to bring the copper to Swansea by ship and smelt it there.\n\nThis specific sector of the metal industry became so dominant that Swansea was given the nickname \"Copperopolis\". The works engaged in this industry were located on the banks of the River Tawe at first, but the construction of the Swansea Canal, opened in 1798, and the development of railways enabled allied metal industries to operate, and to be located further from water transport terminals.\n\nAnthracite coal of high quality was available around Llansamlet, and an early wooden wagonway was built from there to a wharf on the River Tawe by George Kirkhouse; it was operational sometime after 1750. John Scott acquired control of mines on the Gwernllwynchwth Estate and after 1812 built a tram road from there to Foxhole, on the Tawe near its mouth.\n\nIn 1834 the Benson family purchased land at the Tyrllandwr Estate and as Swansea harbour developed this gave the family, led by Starling Benson, considerable wharfage land, encouraging the business of shipping coal. The needed transport and in 1839 they commissioned George Bush to survey for a railway. The west bank of the Tawe was heavily developed at this time and his scheme was on the east bank to Abercrave. Public notice was given in 1840 of the intention to build this railway, but in fact it lapsed, probably due to opposition from the Duke of Beaufort.\n\nNevertheless, Benson and his partners repaired and modernised the 1812 tramroad and made some extension to it over land in their possession, thus not needing Parliamentary authorisation.\n\nIn 1845 the partners transferred their interest to a joint stock company, and in 1846 the tramroad was formally purchased. The name \"Swansea Vale Railway\" was first used at this time. This appears to mark the change from operating as a tramroad to being a railway.\n\nThe South Wales Railway was authorised in 1845 to build a broad gauge railway from near Gloucester to Milford Haven, connecting South Wales with the Great Western Railway network to London. Its route intersected the route of the Swansea Vale Railway.\n\nThe SVR hoped to sell its line to the South Wales Railway, and the SWR was amenable, but did not have the Parliamentary powers to make the purchase. As a means of by-passing this obstacle, the South Wales Railway sponsored a nominally independent company, the \"Swansea Valley Railway\", to take over the SVR and alter it to the broad gauge.\n\nThe Swansea Valley Railway Bill was passed in Parliament on 2 July 1847, but with the condition that it could not be sold on to the South Wales Railway until at last half of the authorised capital had been raised and expended on construction. As there was no intention to raise capital or construct anything, this resulted in a stalemate.\n\nIn March 1850 the construction of the South Wales Railway reached Llansamlet, and a flat crossing was made by the SWR of the SVR line. To optimise their own gradients they lifted the SVR track, which was of stone block sleeper construction, and this caused a minor argument as the SVR had not been asked for permission.\n\nIt was now obvious to the Swansea Vale Railway directors that their line would remain independent for the foreseeable future, so they assessed what needed to be done to secure the future. Some attempts were made to obtain authorisation for passenger operation, and finally in 1855 the Company obtained an Act of Parliament incorporating it, and authorising passenger operation, and permitting extension to Pontardawe, and southwards to the New Cut in Swansea. To neutralise objections in Parliament from the South Wales Railway, it undertook that a third rail (to make mixed gauge track) would be laid southward from the intersection with the South Wales Railway, allowing broad gauge traffic access down to Swansea. The capital of the newly incorporated company was £117,000.\n\nThe South Wales Railway agreed to alter the intersection so as to separate the levels of the two lines, and to build a transhipment shed there to reload goods from narrow gauge to broad gauge wagons. These works were completed in 1857.\n\nIn 1855 the SVR railway was said to be open for a distance of miles and only carrying mineral traffic; this amounted to 1,000 tons per day with an annual income exceeding £5,000.\n\nIn 1856 the Company obtained a further Act authorising further northward extension to Ystalyfera and Ystradgynlais.\n\nThrough the period from 1856 the company seems to have had trouble raising money for capital works, and a preference share issue was authorised in 1859, although the trading position of the railway was profitable throughout this period.\n\nPassenger operation had been authorised and the preparations made for opening from Swansea to Pontardawe for passengers. Captain Ross of the Board of Trade visited the line but he found deficiencies, and declined to permit passenger running. Improvements were made and when Colonel Rich of the Board of Trade made a follow-up visit on 20 February 1860 he was satisfied, and passenger trains started running the following day, 21 February 1860. The passenger business was buoyant, and further third-class carriages had to be acquired. Receipts for the half year to August 1860 were £4,912 compared with the previous £3,693, and operating expenses were now £1,740, and rent and rates £683. In later years the practice was usually that the preference shareholders were paid their full dividend but that ordinary shareholders got nothing.\n\nThe northward extension had been authorised, but actual construction was slow, largely due to the poor level of subscription for shares. In September 1860 the board decided to open the line as far as a temporary terminus at Ynisygeinon. Late in 1860 the passenger service was extended to that place.\n\nThe extension to Ystalyfera was opened on 20 November 1861.\n\nAn essential part of any through route between Hereford and Swansea was the completion of the Swansea Vale and Neath & Brecon Junction Railway, commonly referred to as \"The Junction Line\". This was to run between Colbren Junction on the N&BR to Ynysygeinon on the SVR. Even without Midland Railway involvement, this had been desirable for the N&BR company, giving better access to Swansea than running via Neath.\n\nThe \"Swansea Vale and Neath & Brecon Junction Railway\" was promoted in 1863 to build a line connecting the Swansea Vale Railway at Ynysygeinon with the Neath and Brecon Railway at Colbren. The Swansea Vale Railway considered that it would abstract traffic from its line and it decided to petition against it in Parliament. This was not successful, and the SVR&N&BR obtained the Royal Assent in to its Act on 29 July 1864.\nThe SVR&B&NJR ran into serious financial difficulty; it was unable to secure the subscriptions for shares that it needed to start construction. It entered into a complex arrangement with a contractor, John Dickson, but he fell into bankruptcy at a time when he himself was heavily indebted to the company. For some time, work on the SV&N&BJR was in abeyance. As a moribund company whose only asset was the power to build a line, it was absorbed by the Neath and Brecon Railway in July 1869, and construction was completed and it was opened to traffic on 10 November 1873.\n\nFrom that time the N&BR started to run a passenger service between Brecon and Swansea, using the SVR&N&BJR line and the Swansea Vale Railway, over which it had running powers.\n\nThe SV&N&BJR was to be leased by the N&BR on completion, but when it was clear that no progress toward that goal was being made, it was amalgamated with the Neath and Brecon Railway on 26 July 1869..\n\nThe Llanelly Railway had reached Brynamman from the west in 1842 and was well established in serving the pits there. The coal industry there and in the vicinity was of prime importance and the SVR decided to build a line to it. In 1863 the SVR submitted a Bill for more capital at a level of £48,000 to pay for the Brynamman extension and more rolling stock.\n\nIt was probably opened to goods traffic in stages, and to passengers throughout on 2 March 1868. The branch off it from Gwys to Brynhenllys Colliery did not open until 1875.\n\nThe Llanelly Railway at Brynamman was considered to be an ally, not a competitor, and a connection between the two companies at Brynamman was under construction. The Llanelly Railway was running passenger trains to Brynamman from 20 March 1865.\n\nThrough goods and mineral traffic was soon being run over this route, from Swansea to the West Midlands via Brynamman, representing a more convenient through route.\n\nRevenue increased to £9512 by the middle of 1864; the increase was said to be largely due to traffic coming from Llanelly Railway and the Vale of Neath Railway (which was by now mixed gauge) via the Swansea and Neath Railway.\n\nThe main line had been built on the eastern bank, as it was less developed and land acquisition was expected to be cheaper. Of course, most of the industry and population were on the western bank, and the railway could not serve them directly. The Board decided to propose a Morriston branch; it was to be a loop line off the existing main line, leaving at Upper Boat station and rejoining the original line at Glais. Powers for the construction were granted in 1867.\n\nIt was submitted for inspection to the Board of Trade for passenger operation, and Colonel Hutchinson visited for the purpose; everything was satisfactory and the first part of the line between Morriston and Upper Bank was opened for goods traffic on 6 October 1871. The section probably opened for passenger traffic on 15 March 1871.\n\nThe full length of the Morriston Loop was opened on 2 October 1871 and from that date all passenger trains ran via Morriston and Clydach, with a new station at Glais. The old station at Llansamlet was retained for goods but closed to passengers and Birchgrove closed completely, so the old main line between Glais and Upper Bank was now operated by goods trains only.\n\nIn the second half of 1872, the dividend on ordinary shares for the year reached 6%.\n\nFor some time, the directors of the SVR had believed that sale to a larger company was the solution to their long-standing financial difficulties. Richard Moon and a party of directors of the London and North Western Railway visited the Llanelly Railway in April 1864, and had special train trip over Swansea Vale Railway, but the LNWR was really interested in completion of what became the Central Wales line, and expressed no desire to treat with the Swansea Vale.\n\nThe Midland Railway was negotiating with the Hereford, Hay and Brecon Railway in 1869. The Midland had a presence in Hereford from Worcester, and was known to aspire to reach South Wales. It was obvious that a route over the HH&BR, the Neath and Brecon Railway and the Swansea Vale Railway would achieve that objective.\n\nOn 13 December 1869 the Swansea Vale Railway Board had formal discussions with representatives of the Midland Railway; the negotiation was successful, but did not lead to an immediate arrangement. Nevertheless, in August 1870 the Midland Railway agreed to lend £10,000 to the Swansea Vale Railway; the sum was later raised to £20,000.\n\nOn 23 August 1872 it was announced that the directors had agreed with the Midland Railway, that they would lease the Swansea Vale Railway. SVR shareholders would receive a permanent 6% dividend. Incidentally the Midland Railway was not interested in this kind of arrangement with the Neath and Brecon Railway, (which had taken over the SVJ&N&BR), as the N&BR was considerably over-capitalised, following a series of financial improprieties and the failure of a contractor who was also financing much of the construction personally.\n\nThe capital of the Swansea Vale Railway at this time was £230,392, and there were loans in existence to the extent of £328,040.\n\nThe lease of the Swansea Vale Railway by the Midland was authorised by Act of 30 July 1874; the Midland actually took possession in September 1874.\n\nFrom this time the Swansea Vale Railway Company was only a financial entity, receiving the lease charge. Nevertheless, considerable capital expenditure was now being undertaken by the Midland Railway on bringing the SVR track and structures up to date, and this complicated the financial relationship. Accordingly, it was agreed that the Midland Company would absorb the SVR; an Act to authorise this was obtained on 11 August 1876 and the SVR Company wound up its affairs and ceased to exist.\n\nWhen the Midland Railway took full control of the SVR and the SVR&N&BJR, it had already been running its trains on the line under running powers arrangements.\n\nThe high dividends paid in the final years of the SVR's independent existence had been achieved by not doing enough maintenance of the line or locomotives. There were a number of track-related derailments in the early period of Midland ownership, and Miles et al attribute them to lack of maintenance. The Midland was no doubt aware of the poor state of the infrastructure of the network it had acquired, and it quickly set about modernising it; track replacement was an early priority, followed by the renewal of some bridges.\n\nTwo bridges at Brynamman were renewed in 1875, and the Midland installed signal boxes and block signalling (for the first time probably) during 1875 and 1876\n\nIn 1876 the Midland opened a new goods depot at Swansea on the link line between Swansea St Thomas station and the Eastern Docks. The line was owned by the GWR and access to the depot was under running powers.\n\nThe Swansea Vale Railway had running powers over the Neath and Brecon Railway, so the Midland Railway, as successor to the SVR, ran through trains over the N&BR. The Midland Railway offered to operate all the N&BR domestic trains north of Colbren Junction for one third of receipts, about £4,000 annually. The N&BR reluctantly accepted this arrangement from 1 July 1877 for five years, and the N&BR only operated trains between Colbren Junction and Neath.\nThe arrangement was renewed until in 1889, with the arrival of Sir Edward Watkin as Chairman, the N&BR tried to negotiate better terms. When the talks broke down the Midland Railway abruptly discontinued the through trains on 1 July 1889. For several days there was no service whatever on the N&BR route. The matter went to arbitration and the Midland Railway resumed working the trains from 22 July 1889.\n\nIn 1881 the GWR built a branch line to Morriston, and it extended northwards from Morriston itself to Tyrcanol, a distance of about half a mile. The GWR requested a junction at this point, as the two lines were very close together, and this was installed in May 1881; however, it was never used and it was removed in 1883.\n\nIn June 1891 a new marshalling yard was commissioned at Ynysygeinon to handle the colliery traffic coming down the valley.\n\nThe GWR had long felt that its network around Swansea was inadequate for efficient handling of its traffic, and in 1911 it promoted the Swansea District line, a new route by-passing Swansea. It intersected the Midland line north of Morriston, and was opened in 1913.\n\nAt the same time the GWR got authorisation for a line ten miles long from Gwaun-Cae-Gurwen to the Swansea District Line through the Upper Clydach Valley and Pontardawe. Actual construction was delayed by GWR and then by World War I, but a part of it opened in 1922 from Felin Fran to Clydach and in 1923 to Trebanos just south of Potardawe.\n\nFrom 31 December 1916 the through carriages from Swansea to Birmingham were withdrawn. The transit was very slow and patronage had never been enough to justify the service.\n\nAfter 1918 the effect of passenger road omnibuses was felt by the line; at this period they were slower than the trains, but they ran direct to the centre of Swansea, and often more conveniently through the centre of towns and villages on the route. St Thomas station had been complained of in the past for its lack of proximity to the centre of Swansea.\n\nFollowing the Railways Act 1922 most of the main line railways of Great Britain were compulsorily merged into one or other of four new large companies, the \"groups\"; this took effect during 1922. The Midland Railway was a constituent of the new London, Midland and Scottish Railway, as was also the LNWR.\n\nThe LMS therefore had two routes from Swansea to the Midlands and north, and the former LNWR route was considered to be more convenient operationally.\n\nThe discontinuation of the Swansea to Birmingham through carriages in 1916 was now followed by the suspension of through carriages from Swansea to Brecon, from 31 December 1930. The GWR took over responsibility for local passenger and goods services south of Colbren and the LMS ran a connecting service from Colbren on the Neath and Brecon line to Ynysygeinon, but this was unsuccessful, and was itself discontinued form 12 September 1932. On the same date the through goods traffic was re-routed to the former LNWR line.\n\nThe SVR network continued to prosper, mainly because of the high quality anthracite mined within its area; this was considered a premium product, and much was exported to Canada and to France.\n\nThe railways of Great Britain were nationalised at the beginning of 1948. The passenger business had collapsed in the 1930s and the new owner, British Railways, took stock of the situation; the assessment resulted in SVR passenger services being withdrawn from 25 September 1950.\n\nAt the same time the traditional industries were by now in steep decline, and many of the anthracite mines closed down. As these were by far the dominant business of the former SVR network, it too suffered.\n\nThe Morriston Loop was severed between Glais Junction and the Mond Works just to the north of Clydach in 1956, and the section between Clydach and Morriston closed in 1965.\n\nThe Brynamman line was cut back to Gurnos in September 1964. Traffic from Ynyscedwyn ceased 1968 resulting in closure of the line north of the Imperial Smelting Works at Llansamlet, and the entire Llansamlet line closed in 1971.\n\nTraffic to Llansamlet itself ceased in 1973; the Llansamlet line was closed formally in September 1982, having been dormant for many years. The entire line closed formally on 24 May 1983 and SVR ceased to be a commercial railway.\n\nAfter closure, a heritage group named the \"Swansea Vale Railway Society\", leased a section of track between Upper Bank and Six Pit; in 2007 the lease expired, and the group merged with the Gwili Railway in Carmarthen, and moved most of their rolling stock there.\n\n\nThe Llanelly Railway station had opened on 20 March 1865; renamed Brynamman West 1950; closed 18 August 1958.\n\n"}

It is strongly identified with Adlai Stevenson, the party's unsuccessful candidate for President in both 1952 and 1956 (in each case Stevenson lost to Republican Dwight Eisenhower).\n\nThe domestic policies advocated by the adherents of the New Politics movement stressed strong support for civil rights legislation, while in foreign affairs the movement favored a less aggressive posture toward the Soviet Union (criticizing \"Cold War liberals\" within the party such as Harry Truman and Dean Acheson), prompting its critics to accuse it of being \"soft on Communism.\" Younger adults accounted for many of its members, and provided it with an aura of youthful vibrance — this fact leading some opponents to attempt to link it to so-called \"beatniks\" (that term having been coined in 1958 by \"San Francisco Chronicle\" columnist Herb Caen). However, this may not have been accurate as most of the prominent \"Beat\" writers of that era expressed little if any interest in electoral politics.\n\nThe New Politics movement threw its support behind John F. Kennedy in his successful bid for the Presidency in 1960, but was not happy with Kennedy's choice of Lyndon B. Johnson as his running mate.

Family tradition maintains he was actually born almost a year earlier, on 10 April 1766.\n\nFoveaux was an ensign in the 60th regiment and then joined the New South Wales Corps in June 1789 as lieutenant and reached Sydney in 1791. There he was promoted to major and, as senior officer between August 1796 and November 1799, he controlled the Corps at a time when the senior officers were making fortunes from trading and extending their lands. He soon became the largest landholder and stock-owner in the colony.\n\nIn 1800, having established a reputation as an able and efficient administrator, Foveaux offered to go to Norfolk Island as Lieutenant-Governor. Finding the island run down, he built it up with particular attention to public works, for which he earned the praise of Governor King.\n\nDuring this period, part of the first settlement of Norfolk Island (1788–1814), Norfolk Island was basically a free settlement with convicts making up no more than 10 per cent of the population. While some individuals were sent from Sydney as a means of isolation, the Island was not a place of secondary punishment as it became in the second settlement (1825–1855).\n\nJudgements of Foveaux's career are often clouded by a manuscript purporting to be the recollections of Norfolk Island gaoler Robert Jones. This document is dated 1823, five years after Jones's death. It contains paintings of buildings on Norfolk Island which were not erected until the 1840s. Modern scholarship reveals it to be a forgery from after 1850 which contains no valid evidence on Foveaux's life and career.\n\nRobert Hughes writing in \"The Fatal Shore\" describes Foveaux as brutal in his dealings with convicts.\n\nIn September 1804 Foveaux left Norfolk Island for England to attend to his private affairs and seek relief for the asthma that affected him.\n\nHaving recovered, he returned to New South Wales on the \"Sinclair\" to serve as Lieutenant-Governor, but on arrival in July 1808, he found Governor Bligh under arrest by officers of the New South Wales Corps in the event known as the Rum Rebellion. Foveaux assumed control, stating that he was not favouring either Bligh or the rebels. His control was characterised by a desire for cheap and efficient administration, improvement of public works, and encouragement of small-holders.\n\nIn January 1809, the acting Lieutenant-Governor, Colonel William Paterson, returned and Foveaux remained to assist him and his successor, Major-General Lachlan Macquarie.\n\nMacquarie was impressed with Foveaux's administration and put him forward as Collins's successor as Lieutenant Governor of Van Diemen's Land, because he could think of no one more fitting, and considered that he could not have acted otherwise with regard to Bligh. However, when Foveaux returned to England in 1810, Macquarie's recommendation was put aside. Foveaux was promoted to Inspecting Field Officer in Ireland and in 1814 became a major-general.\n\nHe pursued an uneventful military career after that, rising to the rank of lieutenant-general in 1830. In 1814 he married Ann Sherwin, his partner since 1793, and they had a daughter born in 1801.\n\nHe died in London on 20 March 1846 and was buried in Kensal Green Cemetery.\n\nSurry Hills near the centre of Sydney was once a farming area owned by Foveaux. His property was known as Surry Hills Farm, named after the Surrey Hills in Surrey, England.\n\nFoveaux Strait in New Zealand is named in his honour, as are streets in the Sydney suburbs of Airds, Barden Ridge, Bella Vista, Cromer, Harrington Park, Lurnea and Surry Hills, the Maitland suburb of Metford, and the Canberra suburb of Ainslie.\n\n"}

Although it uses the same frequency-shift keying (FSK) modulation used by regular radioteletype (RTTY), SITOR uses error detection, redundancy, and/or retransmission to improve reliability.\n\nThere are two SITOR modes:\n\nSITOR sends 7-bit characters as a bit stream at 100 baud (which, in this case, is 100 bits per second, 10 milliseconds per bit, or 70 milliseconds per character).\n\nThe bitstream is FSK modulated with a 170 Hz frequency shift. The high frequency is a mark, and the low frequency is a space.\n\nSITOR is used commonly on shortwave bands, where it is used to transmit maritime-related information such as weather forecasts and storm warnings.\n\nSITOR-B is used for narrow-band direct printing (NBDP).\n\nNAVTEX marine weather and safety messages are broadcast using SITOR-B. The NAVTEX messages have a specific format that is interpreted by NAVTEX receivers. (NAVTEX is layered on top of SITOR-B just as HTML is layered on top of TCP.)\n\nAmateur radio uses SITOR but calls it AMTOR, AMateur Teleprinting Over Radio. AMTOR-A is SITOR-A. AMTOR-B (also called AMTOR-FEC) is SITOR-B. In 1991, an AMTOR extension was described that includes lower case and other printable ASCII characters.\n\nRTTY uses the ITA2 (Baudot code) character code. ITA2 is a five bit code with 32 possible code points. Four code points are used for null (BLANK), space (SPACE), carriage return (CR), and line feed (LF). Two code points are used for a letter shift (LTRS) or a figure shift (FIGS). The remaining 26 code points are used for characters in the letters and figures sets. Consequently, ITA2 can represent 52 (2*26) additional characters.\n\nSITOR recasts ITA2 into a 7 bit code called CCIR 476. Each 7-bit character in CCIR 476 has 4 marks (ones) and 3 spaces (zeros). Each valid character code has a Hamming distance of at least 2 from every other character. A one bit error will disrupt the balance of marks and spaces; a second bit error may (or may not) bring the count back to 4 marks and 3 spaces. Consequently, the CCIR 476 alphabet is guaranteed to detect all single bit errors within a character.\n\nThe number of valid characters in CCIR 476 is the number of ways to choose 4 marks for 7 bit positions, and the number can be calculated using the binomial coefficient: formula_1. Thus CCIR 476 has 3 additional code points over ITA2. SITOR uses the additional code points for idle, phasing, and repeat requests. In addition, some of the ordinary characters are reused as control signals.\n\nTransmission in synchronous frames of 450ms. Three characters are transmitted by Information Sending Station (ISS). Takes 210 milliseconds. The ISS then waits 240 ms for a response. Information Receiving Station (IRS) receives the three characters and checks that they each have 4 marks and 3 spaces. If they do, then the IRS transmits an acknowledgement. If they don't, then the IRS requests retransmission. At the beginning of the next frame, the ISS either retransmits the last 3 characters or the next three characters.\n\nSITOR has an aurally easy to identify idling pattern. Synchronization bursts are transmitted every second or so and last for slightly more than one second. Every few sync bursts, a Morse identifier of three letters is transmitted (for example NMO in Honolulu).\n\n\n"}

The Canningites were distinct within the Tory party because they favoured Catholic emancipation and free trade.\n\nAfter the incapacity of Lord Liverpool in 1827, Canning was asked to form a government. Because Canning did not have the full support of the Tory party, which was split between Canningites and Ultra-Tories, he created a coalition government with his Canningites allying themselves with the Whigs. Canning died in August 1827 and the Canningite Lord Goderich became Prime Minister, but his government collapsed in January 1828. The Canningites then allied themselves with the Tories, led by the Duke of Wellington. They resigned in May 1828, though, on the issue of allocating seats from disenfranchised corrupt boroughs to the new growing cities of England.\n\nNow usually known as the 'Huskissonites' (after their new leader, William Huskisson) the group numbered a bare dozen or so in the House of Commons, with greater support in the House of Lords. For the next year and half they acted a separate group between the two main parties, and were courted by both. After Huskisson died in 1830 (in a railway accident, the first recorded casualty of this new form of transport), the remainder of the group decided to join the Whigs and voted against the Tory government in a parliament in favour of electoral reform. Wellington resigned as prime minister and the surviving Canningite/Huskissonites joined the new Whig cabinet of Earl Grey in November 1830.

It was first released as a hardcover in September 1998. Almost a year later, in August 1999, its first mass market edition was published. An ebook reprint was published in 2011.\n\n\"Bloom\" is one of Borders' \"Best 10 Books of 1998\" and is a \"New York Times\" Notable Book.\nThe premise of the book is how to handle human technology that has evolved beyond human control.\n\n\"Bloom\" is set in the year 2106, in a world where self-replicating nanomachines called \"Mycora\" have consumed Earth and other planets of the inner solar system, forcing humankind to eke out a bleak living in the asteroids and Galilean moons. Two groups of humanity are described—The Immunity, who use \"ladderdown\" technology and augmented reality and live on the moons of Jupiter, and The Gladholders, who use human intelligence amplification and artificial intelligence and live in the asteroid belt. The story begins on Ganymede with an article about a “bloom”, or outbreak of Mycora, that serves to emphasize the danger and horror of this technogenic life (TGL). The article is written by Strasheim, the primary narrator character. He is first seen in the office of Chief of Imunnology Lottick, the effective ruler of Ganemede, who has called him there for an unknown purpose.\n\nLottick tells Strasheim that the Mycora have apparently been stealing or assimilating human designed defensive nanotech and may soon develop resistance to the coldness of the outer solar system, which incites concern. It is planned to send mission to drop TGL detectors onto the polar ice caps of Mars, Earth, and the Moon, and Lottick asks Strasheim to go along as a reporter. For the longer term, a starship is being constructed to colonize other star systems before the Mycora.\n\nStrasheim agrees, and goes to meet the other crew-members and inspect the ship, which is called the \"Louis Pasteur\". The ship is technologically camouflaged to protect the crew against Mycora. A terrorist attack releases a Mycora bloom in the hangar, killing one crew member and forcing the others to launch the \"Pasteur\" and escape—departing three weeks earlier than planned, and without adequate supplies.\n\nBecause of their forced launch, the \"Pasteur\" docks at Saint Helier, a medium-sized Floral asteroid of the Gladholders to pick up supplies. While there, they are surprised by the culture multiple times, but what shocks them most is that the asteroid's inhabitants have apparently discovered, through powerful telescopes, human life on both Earth and Venus, co-existing with the Mycora.\n\nThe \"Pasteur\" is pursued by ships of the Temples of Transcendent Evolution, a fringe political/religious group that believes the Mycora are divine, investing large sums of money in researching them. \n\nSearching for ways to defend themselves against the Temple ships, the crew discover that the mission has a somewhat more violent purpose than they were led to believe. The \"detectors\" they have by this time dropped on Mars, Earth, and Luna can actually be repurposed as \"cascade fusion\" devices. \n\nShaken, the crew continues on their journey, but become aware that one of the crew is sabotaging the mission. The saboteur turns out to be the Mycorea specialist Baucum, with whom Strasheim has developed a personal relationship. She is secretly a member of the Temples of Transcendent Evolution, and after being discovered, Baucum ruptures a storage bag inside herself that had been carrying spores of Mycora. Terrified, the crew responds, with Strasheim himself shoving her out an airlock before the Mycora now consuming her can also devour the ship.\n\nIt is determined that the mission's actual purpose was to use the detector/bombs to establish small footholds on the three planetary bodies, but it occurs to Strasheim that if such a device were detonated in the Sun, a massive blast of laddered-down iron would wipe out most Mycoran life in the inner solar system. Several of the Temples' ships that have chased them since Mars, are now desperately attempting to destroy the \"Pasteur\" against this possibility (The \"Pasteur\" is heading toward the Sun to get away from the Mycosystem via an out-of-plane slingshot, but the action could have been construed differently by Temples' agents.).\n\nHaving discovered this possibility, the crew decide not to pursue it, but instead transmit the existence of this potential weapon back to the outer solar system. As a result of the energy of this high power transmition the Mycora break through the hull of the \"Pasteur\", blooming, and unexpectedly assuming the form of a pseudo-human spokesperson. It transpires that the Mycora is sapient and without ill-will toward humans. Communication is brief but paradigm-shattering. The ambassador explains that the majority of persons consumed during the destruction of Earth or on the evacuation out-system was incorporated into the Mycosystem and are still alive in some sense, their consciousness and intelligence adjusted to run on the cellular-automata-like Mycora substrate, or \"Unpacked\". The crew is given information on how to mark areas as off-limits to the Mycosystem. They are told that humanity is, \"...Utterly free. Free to conduct your lives in the classical manner, to escape this solar system, to populate the stars. Free to Unpack, if you choose.\"\n\nThe book ends almost thirteen years later, with a description of how the captain of the \"Pasteur\" has been diagnosed with a terminal disease and requests that Strasheim (now a successful media magnate) be his witness as he joins the Mycora.\n\n\nNamed after Louis Pasteur the French microbiologist and chemist, the ship is described as being very small and having an unusual external covering invented by Lehne called the t-balance.\n\nAccording to Strasheim, the \"Pasteur\" is \"like a bathroom with seven shower stalls and a streetcar cockpit wedged incongruously at one end, a utility closet wedged in the other.\" Rather cramped quarters for a crew of seven going on a voyage that will take about two years.\n\nThe purpose of the t-balance is to convince the Mycora that the ship is part of it by means of tactile camouflage. It is described as a gleaming rainbow gray colored coating that appeared to be made up of millions of minuscule dots, each of which also appears to be made up of millions of tiny dots, and so on. The t-balance also gives off the illusion that the dots are moving. Unfortunately for the \"Pasteur\"'s crew, although the t-balance should work in theory, it has not yet been tested because the only way to do so is by surrounding it with Mycora.\n\n\n"}

Both buildings are official monuments.\n\nThe fraternity is considered smaller and therefore more accessible than other student fraternities in Delft, while retaining its traditions and mores. It offers cheap student dinners for both members and non-members, as well as coffee and tea in a coffee-bar called Oele.\n\nThe fraternity's history has been summarized in the 1997 book “Broederlijcken Liiefde” and the 2007 documentary film “Liieve Leden”.\n\nSint Jansbrug has an 'open eettafel'. This means that everyone can come in and have dinner here.

A gilde consists of members of Sint Jansbrug from different years who share similar interests. To become a member of a guild you have to be invited by existing members of that guild.

Among them were Mr. Charlie, Cinderella Backstreet, Peter & The Wolves, The Blue Drivers and Friction. However, his most enduring contributions were to Rocket From The Tombs and the early work of Pere Ubu. In addition to all this, he wrote for Creem magazine.\n\nLaughner was a voracious rock fan and writer, and was heavily influenced by the writings of Lester Bangs. Like Bangs, Laughner admired Lou Reed, but also drew inspiration from folk and blues figures such as Robert Johnson and Woody Guthrie. Tom Verlaine was also one of Laughner's idols.\n\nLaughner was briefly considered as a replacement for Richard Lloyd when he departed Television, a band he championed from their earliest days. However, Richard Lloyd disputes this.\n\nLaughner had severe drug and alcohol abuse problems that ultimately led to his death by acute pancreatitis in 1977 at the age of 24. Lester Bangs wrote a eulogy for him, simply titled \"Peter Laughner is Dead\".\n\nRumors to the effect that Laughner was despondent, even suicidal, at the time of his death have been contradicted by Laughner's last known message, written and mailed to Cleveland singer Ruby Port on the evening prior to his death. This letter revealed his intent to move to a retreat in the Ohio countryside, where he could write new music as well as rest and regain his health.\n\nLaughner's only known entrance into a recording studio was for the Pere Ubu single sessions, though he left behind countless lo-fi live, rehearsal, and demo recordings. In 1994, Tim/Kerr label released \"Take the Guitar Player for a Ride\", a 15-track LP drawn from these tapes, later re-released as a CD. This compilation sold poorly and has since gone out of print.

It is known as the \"Garden Town of Namibia\". It is located 70 km north of Windhoek on the B1 road. It was founded around 1800, by two local groups, the Herero and the Nama.\n\nOkahandja means \"the place where two rivers\" (Okakango and Okamita) \"flow into each other to form one wide one\" in Otjiherero.\n\nA German pastor, Heinrich Schmelen, became the first European to visit the town in 1827. In 1844, two missionaries were permanently assigned to the town, Heinrich Kleinschmidt and Hugo Hahn. A church dates from this period. A military post was established at the initiative of Theodor Leutwein in 1894, and it is this date that is officially recognized as the town's founding.\n\nA number of important historic Namibian people are buried in Okahandja, among them Maharero, Jan Jonker Afrikaner, Hosea Kutako and Clemens Kapuuo.\n\nOkahandja's population is growing rapidly. It stood at just over 14,000 as measured by the 2001 Population and Housing Census, and is estimated to have surpassed 24,000 in 2012.\n\nVon Bach Dam is situated outside of Okahandja. It provides the majority of Windhoek's water. An open-air curio market attracts tourists, and the town serves as the administrative centre for the Herero people.\n\nOkahandja Railway Station, situated on the Windhoek—Swakopmund line, was built in 1902 during Imperial Germany's colonial rule of German South West Africa. Today it belongs to the Trans-Namib railway network.\n\nIn the 1870s Rhenish missionaries established the first school. The Augustineum School was reopened at Okahandja on 9 November 1905; it was later moved to Windhoek.\n\nThe National Institute for Educational Development (NIED) is today situated in Okahandja. NIED was created after independence as the institute from where a new national system of education was created, replacing the previous racist system of apartheid.\n\nPreviously the German school Regierungsschule Okahandja was in the city.\n\nOkahandja is governed by a municipal council that has seven seats.\n\nIn the 2010 local authority election in Okahandja, SWAPO won with approximately 62% of the vote. Of the five other parties seeking votes in the election, Rally for Democracy and Progress (RDP) received approximately 13% of the vote, followed by the United Democratic Front (UDF, 8%), the United People's Movement (UPM, 7%), National Unity Democratic Organization (NUDO, 6%) and Democratic Turnhalle Alliance (DTA, 2%).

However, on 8 September, the channel was scrapped due to insufficient funding, after Sky would not provide it with encrypted carriage in its then basic package, which was then called \"the Family Pack\". Sky does not accept any adult-themed channels for this package, along with other excluded genres including shopping and religious channels.\n\nThe channel was planned to be the first to be specifically targeted at gay men in England. The channel was the brainchild of David Bouchier, who had been the head of British Sky Broadcasting before spending time as the programming managing director for SKY Italia. The plan was to offer original programming covering news, community and health issues, fashion, clubbing and travel. Existing comedy and cult series would be purchased for broadcast. Adult programs would be offered late night. The 1 September 2005 launch was to have been promoted with an advertising campaign designed to coincide with Pride festivals during the preceding summer in London and elsewhere in the UK. As part of his plans, Bouchier expressed his disappointment at the lack of positive portrayals of gays on television and indicated in an interview that a gay channel like Faze TV was \"long overdue in Britain\" and that he was disappointed that positive images of gays are still missing from TV. He stressed that \"The channel is gay-owned and run and will reflect how 'real' gay men live in Britain today\".\n\nAs of August 2005, the developers of Faze TV reached out to prospective viewers by email asking them to make phone calls or to send emails to Sky Broadcasting asking that they add the gay-oriented channel to their basic package, noting that the company did not offer any magazine or lifestyle shows, movies or documentaries with gay-specific content.\n\nIn September 2005, Faze TV announced that they would be scrapping their planned launch, following their inability to reach agreement on carriage terms with Sky. The company stated that they had obtained adequate funding to launch the channel but that after eight months of negotiations with Sky they were unable to obtain license fees from Sky for airing the channel. The company stated that they would need the fees from Sky to cover their operating costs, which could not be covered by advertising revenues alone. The developers of the proposed channel announced that \"We really wanted to deliver the quality channel which you deserve reflecting the lives and interests of gay men today in the UK.

{"id": "1963091", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1963091", "title": "Azoospermia", "text": "Azoospermia\n\nAzoospermia is the medical condition of a man whose semen contains no sperm. It is associated with infertility, but many forms are amenable to medical treatment. In humans, azoospermia affects about 1% of the male population and may be seen in up to 20% of male infertility situations in Canada.\n\nAzoospermia can be classified into three major types as listed. Many conditions listed may also cause various degrees of oligospermia rather than azoospermia.\n\nPretesticular azoospermia is characterized by inadequate stimulation of otherwise normal testicles and genital tract. Typically, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels are low (hypogonadotropic) commensurate with inadequate stimulation of the testes to produce sperm. Examples include hypopituitarism (for various causes), hyperprolactinemia, and exogenous FSH suppression by testosterone. Chemotherapy may suppress spermatogenesis. Pretesticular azoospermia is seen in about 2% of azoospermia. Pretesticular azoospermia is a kind of non-obstructive azoospermia.\n\nIn this situation the testes are abnormal, atrophic, or absent, and sperm production severely disturbed to absent. FSH levels tend to be elevated (hypergonadotropic) as the feedback loop is interrupted (lack of feedback inhibition on FSH). The condition is seen in 49–93% of men with azoospermia. Testicular failure includes absence of failure production as well as low production and maturation arrest during the process of spermatogenesis.\n\nCauses for testicular failure include congenital issues such as in certain genetic conditions (e.g. Klinefelter syndrome), some cases of cryptorchidism or Sertoli cell-only syndrome as well as acquired conditions by infection (orchitis), surgery (trauma, cancer), radiation, or other causes. Mast cells releasing inflammatory mediators appear to directly suppress sperm motility in a potentially reversible manner, and may be a common pathophysiological mechanism for many causes leading to inflammation. Testicular azoospermia is a kind of non-obstructive azoospermia.\n\nGenerally, men with unexplained hypergonadotropic azoospermia need to undergo a chromosomal evaluation.\n\nIn post-testicular azoospermia sperm are produced but not ejaculated, a condition that affects 7–51% of azoospermic men. The main cause is a physical obstruction (obstructive azoospermia) of the post-testicular genital tracts. The most common reason is a vasectomy done to induce contraceptive sterility. Other obstructions can be congenital (example agenesis of the vas deferens as seen in certain cases of cystic fibrosis) or acquired, such as ejaculatory duct obstruction for instance by infection.\n\nEjaculatory disorders include retrograde ejaculation and anejaculation; in these conditions sperm are produced but not expelled.\n\nIdiopathic azoospermia is where there is no known cause of the condition. It may be a result of multiple risk factors, such as age and weight. For example, a review in 2013 came to the result that oligospermia and azoospermia are significantly associated with being overweight (odds ratio 1.1), obese (odds ratio 1.3) and morbidly obese (odds ratio 2.0), but the cause of this is unknown. The review found no significant relation between oligospermia and being underweight.\n\nGenetic factors can cause pretesticular, testicular, and post-testicular azoospermia (or oligospermia) and include the following situations: The frequency of chromosomal abnormalities is inversely proportional to the semen count, thus males with azoospermia are at risk to have a 10–15% (other sources citing 15–20% incidence) abnormalities on karyotyping versus about <1 % in the fertile male population.\n\nPretesticular azoospermia may be caused by congential hypopituitarism, Kallmann syndrome, Prader-Willi syndrome and other genetic conditions that lead to GnRH or gonadotropin deficiency.\nTesticular azoospermia is seen in Klinefelter syndrome(XXY) and the XX male syndrome. In addition, 13% of men with azoospermia have a defective spermatogenesis that is linked to defects of the Y chromosome. Such defects tend to be de novo micro-deletions and affect usually the long arm of the chromosome. A section of the long arm of the Y chromosome has been termed Azoospermia Factor (AZF) at Yq11 and subdivided into AZFa, AZFb, AZFc and possibly more subsections. Defects in this area can lead to oligospermia or azoospermia, however, a tight genotype-phenotype correlation has not been achieved.\nSpermatogenesis is defective with gene defects for the androgen receptor.\n\nPost-testicular azoospermia can be seen with certain point mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene commonly associated with congenital vas deferens abnormalities.\n\nGenetic counselling is indicated for men with genetic causes of azoospermia. In terms of reproduction, it needs to be considered if the genetic defect could be transmitted to the offspring.\n\nBRD7, a transcription regulatory protein, is normally highly expressed in the testis. Absent or reduced expression of BRD7 protein was observed in the testes of azoospermia patients exhibiting spermatogenesis arrest. Homozygous knockout mice [\"BRD7\"(-/-)] are infertile and have higher levels of apoptosis and DNA damage in their germline cells.\n\nThe human breast cancer susceptibility gene 2 (\"BRCA2\") is employed in DNA repair. A common single nucleotide polymorphism in \"BRCA2\" is associated with idiopathic male infertility with azoospermia.\n\nFour genes involved in DNA double-strand break repair and chromosome synapsis (\"TEX11\", \"TEX15\", \"MLH1\" and \"MLH3\") have key roles in genomic integrity, meiotic recombination and gametogenesis. Polymorphisms in these genes were tested for associations with male infertility. Single nucleotide polymorphisms in two of these genes (\"TEX11\" and \"MLH3\") were found to be associated with male infertility involving azoospermy or oligospermia.\n\nAzoospermia is usually detected in the course of an infertility investigation. It is established on the basis of two semen analysis evaluations done at separate occasions (when the seminal specimen after centrifugation shows no sperm under the microscope) and requires a further work-up.\n\nThe investigation includes a history, a physical examination including a thorough evaluation of the scrotum and testes, laboratory tests, and possibly imaging. History includes the general health, sexual health, past fertility, libido, and sexual activity. Past exposure to a number of agents needs to be queried including medical agents like hormone/steroid therapy, antibiotics, 5-ASA inhibitors (sulfasalazine), alpha-blockers, 5 alpha-reductase inhibitors, chemotherapeutic agents, pesticides, recreational drugs (marijuana, excessive alcohol), and heat exposure of the testes. A history of surgical procedures of the genital system needs to be elicited. The family history needs to be assessed to look for genetic abnormalities.\n\nCongenital absence of the vas deferens may be detectable on physical examination and can be confirmed by a transrectal ultrasound (TRUS). If confirmed genetic testing for cystic fibrosis is in order. Transrectal ultrasound can also assess azoospermia caused by obstruction, or anomalies related to obstruction of the ejaculatory duct, such as abnormalities within the duct itself, a median cyst of the prostate (indicating a need for cyst aspiration), or an impairment of the seminal vesicles to become enlarged or emptied.\nRetrograde ejaculation is diagnosed by examining a post-ejaculatory urine for presence of sperm after making it alkaline and centrifuging it.\n\nLow levels of LH and FSH with low or normal testosterone levels are indicative of pretesticular problems, while high levels of gonadotropins indicate testicular problems. However, often this distinction is not clear and the differentiation between obstructive versus non-obstructive azoospermia may require a testicular biopsy. On the other hand, \"In azoospermic men with a normal ejaculate volume, FSH serum level greater than two times the upper limit of the normal range is reliably diagnostic of dysfunctional spermatogenesis and, when found, a diagnostic testicular biopsy is usually unnecessary, although no consensus exists in this matter.\" But also, extremely high levels of FSH (>45 ID/mL) have been correlated with successful microdissection testicular sperm extraction.\n\nSerum inhibin-B weakly indicates presence of sperm cells in the testes, raising chances for successfully achieving pregnancy through testicular sperm extraction (TESE), although the association is not very substantial, having a sensitivity of 0.65 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.56–0.74) and a specificity of 0.83 (CI: 0.64–0.93) for prediction the presence of sperm in the testes in non-obstructive azoospermia.\n\nSeminal plasma proteins TEX101 and ECM1 were recently proposed for the differential diagnosis of azoospermia forms and subtypes, and for prediction of TESE outcome. Mount Sinai Hospital, Canada started clinical trial to test this hypothesis in 2016.\n\nIt is recommended that men primary hypopituitarism may be linked to a genetic cause, a genetic evaluation is indicated in men with azoospermia due to primary hypopituitarism. Azoospermic men with testicular failure are advised to undergo karyotype and Y-micro-deletion testing.\nPre- and post-testicular azoospermia are frequently correctible, while testicular azoospermia is usually permanent. In the former the cause of the azoospermia needs to be considered and it opens up possibilities to manage this situation directly. Thus men with azoospermia due to hyperprolactinemia may resume sperm production after treatment of hyperprolactinemia or men whose sperm production is suppressed by exogenous androgens are expected to produce sperm after cessation of androgen intake. In situations where the testes are normal but unstimulated, gonadotropin therapy can be expected to induce sperm production.\n\nA major advancement in recent years has been the introduction of IVF with ICSI which allows successful fertilization even with immature sperm or sperm obtained directly from testicular tissue. IVF-ICSI allows for pregnancy in couples where the man has irreversible testicular azoospermia as long as it is possible to recover sperm material from the testes. Thus men with non-mosaic Klinefelter's syndrome have fathered children using IVF-ICSI. Pregnancies have been achieved in situations where azoospermia was associated with cryptorchism and sperm where obtained by testicular sperm extraction (TESE).\n\nIn men with post-testicular azoospermia a number of approaches are available. For obstructive azoospermia IVF-ICSI or surgery can be used and individual factors need to be considered for the choice of treatment. Medication may be helpful for retrograde ejaculation. \n\n"}

Many performers have devised their own variations of this trick. It is often billed as \"the trick that fooled Winston Churchill\" due to a story describing how it was performed for him during World War II. The method behind the trick is simple and essentially self-working, and can be enhanced by the presentation of the performer and the use of other principles of magic.\n\n\nThe deck in use is either stacked or partially stacked prior to performance, or manipulated in the course of performance to form a partial or full stack, in which there is a separation between the red and black cards, with a run of each colour comprising either half the deck or a substantial portion of the stack near the top.\n\nIn the first round of dealing face-down cards, all of the cards dealt will be of one colour. The switching of sides occurs at the halfway point through the deck because that is the point at which the first colour cards will be exhausted and the second colour of cards will begin to be dealt.\n\nTo understand why this enables the trick to work, think about what will be in the two lines of cards at the end of the trick. The left-hand line will begin with (for example) a black marker card (placed at the start), followed by the face-down black cards from the top of the deck, then the red marker card (placed at the side switch), then the face-down red cards from the bottom of the deck. That's (black marker) (black cards) (red marker) (red cards). In other words, this line is exactly right, and is given to the subject to gather up.\n\nThe right-hand line will begin with the red marker card (placed at the start), followed by the face-down black cards from the top of the deck, then the black marker card (placed at the side switch), then the face-down red cards from the bottom of the deck. That's (red marker) (black cards) (black marker) (red cards). Although incorrect, this can be instantly made to appear correct by moving the red marker card from one end of the line to the other, or by reversing the order of all other cards in the line. This must be performed by the magician during the act of gathering up the right-hand line of cards, while the subject is distracted by gathering up their own line.\n\nChapter 13 of the book \"Magician's Magic\" by Paul Curry describes a dinner party during World War II at which a magician named Harry Green performed the trick for Winston Churchill. According to the book, Churchill insisted that the trick be performed for him half a dozen times, and was left thoroughly baffled.\n"}

The French Football Federation (FFF, Fédération Française de Football) is the national governing body and is responsible for overseeing all aspects of association football in the country, both professional and amateur. The federation organizes the Coupe de France and is responsible for appointing the management of the men's, women's and youth national football teams in France. The federation gives responsibility of Ligue 1 and Ligue 2 to the Ligue de Football Professionnel who oversee, organize, and manage the country's top two leagues. The LFP is also responsible for organizing the Coupe de la Ligue, the country's league cup competition. The French Football Federation also supervises the overseas departments and territories leagues and hosts football club AS Monaco, a club based in the independent sovereign state of Monaco. In 2006, the FFF had 2,143,688 licenses, with over 1,850,836 registered players and 18,194 registered clubs.\n\nThe first football club was introduced to France in 1863, as described in a newspaper article by \"The Scotsman\", which stated \"A number of English gentlemen living in Paris have lately organised a football club... The football contests take place in the Bois de Boulogne, by permission of the authorities and surprise the French amazingly.\" Modern football was introduced nine years later in 1872 by English sailors playing in Le Havre in 1872.\n\nThe top two divisions of French football, Ligue 1 and Ligue 2, are governed by the Ligue de Football Professionnel. The league is responsible for overseeing, organizing, and managing the top two leagues and is also responsible for the 46 professional football clubs that contest football in France (20 in Ligue 1, 20 in Ligue 2, and 6 in the Championnat National).\n\nLigue 1 is the French professional league for football clubs. It is the country's primary football competition and serves as the top division of the French football league system. Contested by 20 clubs, it operates on a system of promotion and relegation with Ligue 2. Ligue 1 is one of the top national leagues, currently ranked fifth in Europe behind the English Premier League, Spanish La Liga, German Bundesliga, and the Italian Serie A. Ligue 1 was inaugurated on 11 September 1932 under the name \"National\" before switching to \"Division 1\" after a year of existence. The name lasted until 2002 before switching to its current name. The current champions of France are Paris Saint-Germain, who were awarded their ninth title in 2020.\n\nLigue 2 is the second division of French football. Contested by 20 clubs, it operates on a system of promotion and relegation with the Championnat National. The league was created in 1934, a year after Ligue 1 and consisted of 23 clubs that were divided into two groups, Nord and Sud.\n\nThe Championnat National is the third division of French football. Though the league has several clubs that are members of the Ligue de Football Professionnel, it is not governed by the organization primarily because of the LFP's refusal to divide its profits into smaller shares, so they can collaborate with the many amateur clubs in the league to help them become professional. The French Football Federation moderates the league, which was founded in 1993 under the name \"National 1\". Contested by 20 clubs, it operates on a system of promotion and relegation with the Championnat de France amateur.\n\nThe Championnat National 2 is the fourth division of French football and normally features 72 football clubs. Most clubs that participate in the league are amateur clubs, but a small number of clubs are semi-professional. The CFA consists of 72 clubs spread into 4 parallel groups of 18. It is open to the best reserve teams in France and amateur clubs in France, although only the amateur clubs are eligible for promotion to the Championnat National. The highest-placed amateur team in each pool are promoted, replaced by the 4 lowest-placed in the Championnat National.\n\nThe Championnat National 3 is the 5th division in French football and normally consists of 168 teams in 12 groups of 14 organised to align with the regional leagues. The twelve teams (both amateur and reserves of professional teams in higher divisions) that top their league are promoted to Championnat National 2. Relegation from Championnat National 3 is defined by both position in the group and the region the club belongs to. Normally, one club is relegated to each regional league that feeds that group.\n\nAmateur football in France is organised and managed by the Ligue du Football Amateur. The LFA, under the watch of the French Football Federation, is responsible for administering and federating the actions of the regional and district leagues beginning with the Division d'Honneur all the way down to the lower division\n\nWomen's football in France consists of three divisions, Division 1 Féminine, Division 2 Féminine, and Division 3 Féminine. The D1 Féminine is the top league for women's association football clubs in France. It is the female equivalent to the men's Ligue 1 and is contested by 12 clubs. The league operates on a system of promotion and relegation with lower leagues and is governed by the French Football Federation, who resurrected the women's league in 1974.\n\nThe leagues based in the overseas departments and territories of France are run by their respective associations under the watch of the French Football Federation. Under the rules of the FFF, clubs in the leagues are allowed to participate in confederation competitions based on their regional locations. For example, the champion of the Réunion Premier League is allowed inclusion into the CAF Champions League.\n\nThe two most important cup competitions in France are the Coupe de France and the Coupe de la Ligue. However, several other national cups are targeted at clubs at different levels.\n\n\nThe following teams have qualified for the last eight of the European Cup / UEFA Champions League.\n\n\nThe France national football team represents France in international football. France was one of the four European teams that participated at the inaugural World Cup in 1930 and are one of eight national teams to have won the competition, which they did in 1998 when they hosted the Cup, defeating Brazil 3–0 in the final. They won their second world title 20 years later, after defeating Croatia 4–2 in the final of the 2018 edition in Russia. France also won two European Championships in 1984 and 2000, and hosted the tournament on three occasions, including their victorious 1984 campaign. Following France's 2001 Confederations Cup victory, they became the first national team to win the three most important men's titles organised by FIFA: the FIFA World Cup, the FIFA Confederations Cup, and the Olympic Tournament. This would be followed with Argentina and Brazil's victories at the Summer Olympics in 2004 and 2016.\n\nThe France women's national football team represents the country in international women's football. The France women's national team initially struggled on the international stage failing to qualify for three of the first FIFA Women's World Cups and the six straight UEFA European Championships before reaching the quarter-finals in the 1997 edition of the competition. However, since the beginning of the new millennium, France have become a mid-tier national team and one of the most consistent in Europe, having qualified for their first-ever FIFA Women's World Cup in 2003 and reaching the quarter-finals in the last three consecutive European Championships. They also hosted the 2019 Women's World Cup, reaching the quarter-finals.\n\nThe France national youth football teams consists of age-specific national teams beginning with the France national under-16 football team and ending with the France national under-21 football team. Since the coaching tenure of Aimé Jacquet, there is an unwritten rule among senior national team coaches that players called up to the national team must have had prior international experience with the under-21 team.\n\nThe following overseas department national teams act as feeder teams for the French national football team. All teams are run by their respective federation under the authority of the French Football Federation.\n\nAs an overseas department of the French Republic, each national team is not a member of FIFA, therefore they are not eligible to enter the World Cup. However, since inhabitants of the overseas departments are French citizens, players are eligible to play for the French national football team. Guadeloupe, Martinique, Saint Martin, and the French Guiana are associate members of CONCACAF and are full members of the Caribbean Football Union, and are thus eligible for all competitions organized by both, while Réunion are associate members of CAF. Indeed, according to the status of the FFF (article 34, paragraph 6): \"\"[...]Under the control of related continental confederations, and with the agreement of the FFF, those leagues can organize international sport events at a regional level or set up teams in order to participate to them.\"\"\n\nA special rule of the CONCACAF Gold Cup only allows players to join the team if they have not played for France during the past five years. On the other side, any player joining the team is allowed to join the French national team afterward with no time restrictions.\n\nThe use of overseas department players have been extremely beneficial with regards to the French national team. Lilian Thuram and Bernard Lama, who were born in Guadeloupe and Martinique, respectively, were a part of the winning team at the 1998 FIFA World Cup. Also on the team were Thierry Henry and Bernard Diomède, who, though born in metropolitan France, were descendants of parents from overseas departments. Currently, Florent Malouda (French Guiana), William Gallas, Mikaël Silvestre, Michaël Ciani (Guadeloupe), Nicolas Anelka (Martinique), and Guillaume Hoarau and Florent Sinama Pongolle (Réunion) are members of the national team who either hail from or families hail from the overseas departments.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1963141", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1963141", "title": "Port Adelaide", "text": "Port Adelaide\n\nPort Adelaide is a port-side region of Adelaide, approximately northwest of the Adelaide CBD. It is also the namesake of the City of Port Adelaide Enfield council, a suburb, a federal and state electoral division and is the main port for the city of Adelaide. Port Adelaide played an important role in the formative decades of Adelaide and South Australia, with the port being early Adelaide's main supply and information link to the rest of the world.\n\nPrior to European settlement Port Adelaide was covered with mangrove swamps and tidal mud flats, and lay next to a narrow creek. The entrance to this creek, the Port River, was first reported in 1831. It was explored by Europeans when Captain Henry Jones entered in 1834. The creek's main channel was then fed by numerous smaller creeks, and was deep. The navigable channel was narrow and the creek soon faded into swamps and sandhills. At low tide the channel was surrounded by mudbanks. Dry and solid land ended near present-day Alberton.\n\nColonel William Light began closely exploring the area in late 1836 while deciding on a site for the colony of South Australia's port. After initial trepidation, he reported to the Colonisation Commissioners that the location was a suitable harbour. By this time it had acquired the name \"the port creek\". Light's choice of separating the port and Adelaide was strongly opposed by a few merchants, a newspaper and Governor John Hindmarsh. This opposition was largely based on the distance between them. The division of power in the colony meant that the final decision was Light's alone. He kept Adelaide and the port separate principally due to the lack of fresh water at the port.\n\nThe effective foundation day of Port Adelaide was 6 January 1837. On this day the first harbourmaster, Captain Thomas Lipson (Royal Navy), took up residence with his family on the edge of Port Creek. The new port was used for shipping later that month, and passengers began disembarking the next. At this point the site was known as \"The Port Creek Settlement\".\n\nWhen founded, the port's land was just higher than the surrounding tidal flats; at high tide the port could be rowed around. The port had a significant problem—reported in letters from Light and complaints to the Governor from ship owners—of a lack of a fresh water supply. At first the river was not used for larger ships. They had to land at Holdfast Bay until the port was charted. This early port was plagued by mosquitoes, was a comparative long distance from Adelaide, had few amenities and had a risk of inundation when the tide was very high. By 1840 it had acquired the name \"Port Misery\"; the name was widely used in news reports. It was first coined in a book credited to T. Horton James, probably a pseudonym, and comes from a line stating:\nThe original drawings of Adelaide City Plan by Light show that he envisaged a canal (sea communication) between Port Adelaide and the City of Adelaide. The canal was not built; it would have required a massive investment that was not available at the time. A plan of a proposed \"Grand Junction Canal\" between Adelaide and the North Arm, by engineer Edward Snell was produced in 1851, with an exhibition of his \"A Bird's Eye View of the Country Between Adelaide and the North Arm\", showing the proposed canal.\n\nBy early 1838, large vessels could only get as far as the end of Gawler Reach (near the current Birkenhead Bridge). Arrivals had to use smaller boats, traverse the mangrove swamps at low tide and climb sandhills to reach the road to Adelaide. A canal for the loading of sailing ships was constructed in 1838, and town acreages nearby surveyed and sold. By the years end deficiencies of the canal were clear. The canal was dry for most of the day and cargo movement very slow. Seagoing ships had to stop some distance from the settlement due to the mudbanks. Cargo and passengers covered the remaining distance in ships' boats. All had to traverse 2–300 m of swamps after landing to reach sandhills, and eventually the road to Adelaide. The new port's first maritime casualty was the migrant ship \"Tam O'Shanter\" that ran aground on the outer sand bar. Later a small waterway in the port was named after the ship; the waterway later became the Port Adelaide Canal.\n\nThe port's initial location was intended to be temporary. The location for a proper port was chosen by Governor George Gawler, between the original settlement and the Governor's preferred location at the junction of the North Arm and the Port River. One reason for the chosen site was Gawler's instructions on leaving England to limit expenditure; the North Arm site would have required more transport infrastructure and reclamation work. Gawler awarded a tender allowing the South Australian Company to construct a private wharf, again partly to limit government expenditure. Along with the wharf they were to construct a warehouse and roadway. The roadway was to be a wide and run from the port to dry land, a distance of approximately . This first wharf was built near the end of the modern Commercial Road.\n\nThe wharf, known as McLaren Wharf, was finished in 1840 and named after David McLaren, company manager of the South Australian Company. McLaren Wharf was long and deep at low tide. Contrary to usual practice, it was allowed to be built at the low water mark, which made construction simpler. The wharf, warehouse and road were opened by Governor Gawler in October 1840. The opening procession from the old port to the new included over 1,000 people; then the largest assembly of colonists to date. The procession included 600 horsemen and 450 vehicles, almost all of the colony's wheeled transportation. At the opening a parcel was ceremonially landed from the barque \"Guiana\". Upon opening, the port could accommodate vessels up to . In May 1841 John Hill became the original holder of the land grant for all the land south of St Vincent Street, reaching to Tam O'Shanter Creek (later the Port Canal), comprising 134 acres and known as Section 2112. Much of this land was a tidal mangrove swamp, being reclaimed by successive owners over many decades.\n\nDuring reclamation work, the ground level was raised by approximately , with mud and silt from dredging work. Early houses had their ground floors below the now raised ground level; some had steps built down from road level. The Port Admiral Hotel's original ground floor now forms part of its basement. The last major reclamation was of the Glanville Reserve in 1892.\n\nBy the mid-1840s, with increasing trade, the wharves proved insufficient and some more private wharves were constructed. During the late 1850s the state of the dry and dusty plain, between Adelaide and Port Adelaide, led to the pejorative terms \"Dustholia\" and \"Mudholia\" in summer and winter.\n\nGas street lighting was erected by the local council in 1881. The town received its first electric lighting in January 1889, lit with the colony's first town supply from a powerhouse in Nile Street. During the rest of the 1800s harbour facilities expanded and the town grew. It gained an impressive range of commercial and institutional buildings. Many have survived, resulting in Port Adelaide having one of the best concentrations of colonial buildings in South Australia. Their significance was recognised in May 1982, when a sizeable part of the town centre was declared a State Heritage Area.\n\nThe construction of the Outer Harbor took place at the beginning of the 20th century, accommodating larger ships and reducing the time needed to sail up the Port River to the inner harbour. In the 1920s and 1930s the first wharf was removed or disappeared and the Port Adelaide wharves underwent a significant reconstruction programme, changing the face of the inner harbour's waterfront.\n\nThe introduction of containerisation in the 1960s had a major impact on the Port, changing cargo handling methods and significantly reducing the size of the local workforce.\n\nCompounding the effect of a declining workforce on business activity, competition for shoppers arrived in the form of regional shopping centres. Up until the 1960s the Port had been second only to Adelaide as a shopping and commercial precinct. The opening of shopping centres in nearby suburbs led to a general decline in retail turnover. Activity in the suburb has declined significantly from its heyday, leaving parts empty and derelict. Historic buildings are closed and sometimes vandalised, shops in the main streets are empty and boarded up.\n\nRedevelopment of the waterfront was first publicly discussed in 1975. Over the following years, plans and costs were proposed and discussed but most lapsed without action.\n\nBy 2002, the \"Newport Quays\" consortium was the government's preferred bidder for a $1.2 billion project to cover of under used land. The development was unveiled in 2003 and land sales began two years later. This development was stated to be worth $1.5 billion and would comprise 2000 homes, construction of which would create 4000 jobs.\n\nIn 2004 Premier Mike Rann announced that a dolphin sanctuary would be established in the Port River and Barker Inlet covering 118 square kilometres, the first \"urban\" dolphin sanctuary in the world. In 2005 the \"Adelaide Dolphin Sanctuary Act\" was enacted.\n\nBy 2006 Newport Quays was being criticised for its poor planning for a residential development, criticism that continued with each stage of the project. By early 2007, two stages of the now $2 billion development were under construction, or nearing completion, and the third's plans submitted; The plans included provision for a 100-berth marina and one building built over the water. By 2008 reports showed the resale value of some properties in the developments were under the initial cost. The local council estimated that less than half of finished properties were occupied.\n\nIn October 2009 it was named, by the National Trust of Australia, as one of the country's most at risk heritage sites. A lack of people living in, and travelling to, Port Adelaide is seen as the major cause of this decline.\n\nIn February 2010 Premier Mike Rann opened the $400 million Techport naval construction hub at Osborne (next to the Australian Submarine Corporation's facility) to underpin the development of the Navy's $8 billion Air Warfare Destroyer program and other naval construction projects. Techport features the largest ship lift in the Southern Hemisphere.\n\nIn 2015–16 Quest Hotel Consortium built a $25 million apartment building on the corner of McLaren Wharf and the Birkenhead Bridge.\n\nIn 2016 it was announced that Starfish Developments and Cedar Woods had won tenders to develop 23ha of vacant waterfront land in the inner Port Adelaide harbour with total investment exceeding $1 billion. The development was later renamed Fletcher's Slip after a nearby historic landmark.\n\nIn 2016 the Federal Government announced that DCNS had won the tender to build 12 submarines for the Royal Australian Navy in a $50 billion deal, with construction taking place in Port Adelaide.\n\nIn 2016 the South Australian State Government indicated it is interested in re-establishing the tram network from the City to Port Adelaide, with links to Outer Harbor and Semaphore.\n\nIn 2017 developer EPC Pacific began construction of a $38 million office tower on Nelson Street in Port Adelaide that will house public servants.\n\nIn 2017 the Port Admiral Hotel was reopened after a $1m redevelopment. It is one of the oldest buildings in Port Adelaide built in 1849.\n\nIn 2018, Pirate Life Breweries announced it would be relocating in Port Adelaide into a $15m refurbished warehouse.\n\nIn 2018, Precision Group began the redevelopment of the Port Canal Shopping Centre as Port Adelaide Plaza.\n\nPort Adelaide is known for its well preserved 19th-century pubs and hotels, reflecting the area's maritime history in catering to the sailors of trading ships.\n\nDuring the rest of the 1800s harbour facilities expanded and the town grew. It gained an impressive range of commercial and institutional buildings. Many have survived, resulting in Port Adelaide having one of the best concentrations of colonial buildings in South Australia. Their significance was recognised in May 1982, when a sizeable part of the town centre was declared a State Heritage Area.\n\nThe earliest recorded was the Port Hotel. It opened in 1838, two years before the port was officially declared. Three years later the First Commercial Inn opened. It has the longest licensing history in the suburb, though discontinuous. It did not trade for 12 years following a fire in 1857.\n\nThe British hotel is the longest continually licensed. It opened 1847 as a single storey building, and was rebuilt with two further storeys in 1876 for then-owner Henry Ayers. The South Australian Brewing Company acquired it in 1937. It was known from c. 1907–1952 as \"McGraths British Hotel\". Dockside Tavern is one of the few Late Victorian style buildings remaining in the Port. It was opened as the Britannia Hotel in 1850 then was rebuilt on site in 1898, in contemporary style. It was renamed as the Dockside Tavern in 2002. The Golden Port Tavern is on the corner of Vincent and Robe Streets. On this site the Carpenters' Arms Tavern opened in late 1850. The Arms burned down in 1865 and was replaced with the current hotel, then known as The Globe. The hotel's name was changed to the current one in 1981.\n\nBlack Diamond Square—named after the Black Diamond Hotel—is the main intersection of Port Adelaide, at the north end of Commercial Road. The hotel was designed by Adelaide architect William Wier. It opened as the White Horse Cellars Inn in 1851, with an integral 600 seat theatre. Parts of the building were used for an early freemason hall, library and the Port Adelaide Institute. It was renamed as the Family Hotel in 1876, then as the Black Diamond Hotel c. 1878. This last name came from the Black Diamond Line shipping company. From 1866–1883 Cannon brand beer was brewed in the hotel. The building was converted to retail shops in 1884 and the Central Hotel erected on the south side.\n\nPort Dock Brewery hotel won business awards as best hotel and restaurant in 2001. It was built in 1855 and opened as the Dock Hotel. The current building structure results from an 1883 rebuild, with stone from Dry Creek near Yatala Labour Prison. The Hotel lost its licence in 1909, after a 1906 Opinion Vote. The building was renovated, part of it converted into a small brewery, and reopened as a hotel in 1986. Railway Hotel opened in 1856 opposite the new Port Adelaide railway station, a month before the line to Adelaide was opened. The hotel retains many original features including leadlight windows and an 1890s glass fanlight.\n\nTwo six-room houses were built on the corner of Cannon Street and Church Place in 1873. They were converted into a single building and opened as the Kent Hotel in 1875. The building's exterior was restyled in Art Deco fashion in the 1940s and the interior of the hotel completely renovated in the 1990s. It is now known as the Port Anchor Hotel.Brunswick Pier Hotel was on the corner of Vincent and Robe Streets. It opened in 1878 in what had been a butcher's shop. The hotel lost its licence in 1909, along with other hotels, after an opinion poll resulted in a reduction of the number of licences. After this the building was used as a furniture shop and a butcher's shop. During the 1920s it became a pharmacy specialising in photographic materials and \"Kirby's Calcarea Teething Powders\". Medical suites were leased upstairs. It was bought by Birks Chemists in 1946, and remained a pharmacy until 1996. From then to at least 2001 the building was vacant.\n\nOn the corner of Dale street is a building that was opened by the Port Adelaide Market Company in 1879, divided into shops, offices and stalls. Part of the building was later adapted to make a 17-room hotel, the Newmarket. Colac Hotel, on Ocean Steamer's Road, opened in 1881. It was built opposite the then No. 1 Dock, alongside the 1879 extension to the South Australian Company basin. The hotel has had strong ties to both the Australian Labor Party and the union movement. Both former Prime Minister Bob Hawke and local Member of Parliament Mick Young used to talk to workers at the pub. Mick Young owned the pub from 1988–1990 and as of 2002 it was owned by the Labor Party.\n\nFrom 1838 to 1906, sixty differently named hotels had been run on 38 different sites within Port Adelaide. A local opinion poll was held in Port Adelaide and other Adelaide districts in February 1906, on the subject of liquor licensing. Port Adelaide voters supported the Temperance Party's platform, reducing the number of licences by a third. Fifteen hotels and three wine licences expired on 25 March 1909 and were not renewed.\n\nThe Port River, known officially as the Port Adelaide river, is home to a large population of bottle nose dolphins. The Port River also has a significant amount of mangroves that provide a habitat for a large variety of wildlife.\n\nPort Adelaide is bound by the Port River and Inner Harbour to the north and west, and by Webb Street and Grand Junction Road to the south. The main strip of Port Adelaide is along St Vincent Street, with a residential area to the south of the train station along Commercial Road and Webb Street. Recent residential development has occurred along the waterfront promenade.\n\nPort Adelaide has many parks. The most recent is a $2 million refurbishment of the Hart's Mill precinct at Port Adelaide, opened in May 2014. Hart's Mill, Mundy Street, Port Adelaide SA 5015, Australia.\n\nPort Adelaide is home to various markets including the Torrens Island Food Market and the Fishermen's Wharf Markets which is housed in Shed 1, the last remaining Wharf Shed in the inner Port Adelaide harbour. The Fishermans Wharf Markets are soon to be demolished for the construction of apartments and a public plaza.\n\nThe first transport infrastructure in the suburb was the construction of a long road from the port to near the present Alberton Hotel. The road was opened in October 1840. The cost of this road, and the causeway upon which it ran proved so large that Governor Gawler allowed the constructing company to charge a toll. Later investigations showed the company was making excessive profits and a compromise was reached where the colony leased the roadway. Ownership of the roadway was later moved to the government, in exchange for land at Dry Creek.\n\nThe river was first crossed with a wooden bridge in the 1850s. This was replaced with the iron Jervois Bridge in 1878; It was named by Sir William Jervois after himself. Jervois Bridge was an opening bridge first operated by horse power, and later by mechanical means. It was replaced with a fixed bridge in the same position in 1969, when there was no longer a need for small boats to pass. Birkenhead Bridge, the first bascule bridge in Australia, opened in 1940. In 2004 Premier Mike Rann said the State government would build new rail and road bridges over the Port River at a cost of $178 million. On 3 April 2005 he announced that the 'opening and closing' bridges would be toll-free and would be opened twice a day to minimise disruptions to road traffic. It was opened for traffic on 3 August 2008. It is between Docks 1 and 2 at Port Adelaide and links with Francis Street to the east and Victoria Road to the west.\n\nTom 'Diver' Derrick Bridge, commonly referred to as the 'Diver' Derrick Bridge, is an opening, single-leaf bascule bridge over the Port River. It was built at the same time as an adjacent rail crossing, the Mary MacKillop Bridge.\n\nAt the opening of both bridges Rann unveiled a plaque dedicated to Mary Mackillop blessed by Pope Benedict during his recent visit to Sydney.\n\nThe Port Adelaide and Le Fevre Peninsula Ferry Co began operations in 1877, ferrying passengers from the end of Commercial Road to the other side of the river. The ferry stopped operating in 1943, consequent to opening of the Birkenhead Bridge.\n\nIn April 1856 a rail line reached the port, crossing the almost empty plain from Adelaide. By 1876 it was a thriving seaport and the principal artery from South Australia, to the rest of the country and to the World. To service the numerous stores and warehouses, many railway lines were built around the wharf areas, along streets, and connecting with the main lines from Adelaide. A horse tram line was constructed from Port Adelaide to Albert Park in 1879. This line was built in broad gauge to accommodate steam locomotives. Some of the line was raised on embankments to avoid swampy ground and flooding. The line used horse trams until 1914, when conversion to electric operation began. It reopened on 3 April 1917. From 1917 until its closure in 1935, the Port Adelaide tram system was not connected to the rest of Adelaide's light rail network.\n\nRail transport in the 21st century uses the Port Adelaide railway station which has two elevated platforms located on a viaduct, built in 1919. Trains connect to Adelaide and Outer Harbor. The line was closed in November 2009 to enable upgrade work on the line, station and viaduct. The line and station re-opened in 2010. Scheduled bus services directly connect Port Adelaide to much of metropolitan Adelaide. The State Government has promised that the Glenelg Tramline will be extended down Port Road as far as Port Adelaide by 2018. In 2005 the road portion of the Port River Expressway was completed. It is a freeway-grade road, which links Port Adelaide and the Lefevre Peninsula to the northern suburbs of Adelaide, and major interstate routes via Salisbury Highway.\n\nPort Adelaide is traditionally a working class area which stemmed from the economic activity the wharves produced and the subsequent industry.\n\nPort Adelaide has a long-standing tradition of social reform and progressive movements. Early examples are religious leaders seeking to reduce prostitution and alcoholism amongst wharf workers in the mid-1800s. Later examples are union movements that fought for better working conditions on the wharf and surrounding industries. Recently Port Adelaide has had a strong tradition of helping support local indigenous populations with Kura Yerlo Community Centre, indigenous programs and various efforts by the Port Adelaide Football Club trying to advance the lives of disadvantaged and discriminated indigenous peoples and youth. Significant people involved in these movements are often recognised on the Port Adelaide Workers Memorial at Black Diamond Corner.\n\nThe Port Adelaide Artists Forum organises events for local artists. Galleries in the area include the Black Diamond Gallery and Gallery Yampu.\n\nThe Waterside Workers Hall is a venue used for performance art and concerts. It is currently occupied by Vitalstatistix.\n\nThe Hart's Mill precinct is home to various events and festivals. Most notable currently is St Jerome's Laneway Festival. The Semaphore Music Festival also holds events in the flour shed at Hart's Mill.\n\nThe Largs Pier Hotel had a history of hosting early Adelaide rock bands. Jimmy Barnes wrote a song after the pub and his experiences playing there.\n\nPort Adelaide's strong sporting tradition and culture extend into other sports with most clubs using black and white along with the magpie as their club symbols.\n\n\nPort Adelaide is home to the Port Adelaide Football Club, an Australian rules football team. Its headquarters and training facility and home ground for South Australian National Football League (SANFL) games is Alberton Oval. Founded in 1870, the club has competed in the SANFL from 1877 until 1996, and in the Australian Football League AFL since 1997. The club was awarded the second AFL licence in South Australia in doing so becoming the only pre-existing non-Victorian club to gain entry into the competition. It had won 34 SANFL Premierships before its move to the AFL. The club is still represented by its reserves team in the SANFL.\n\nFrom the time of settlement, the port's population grew rapidly. By 1876 it was estimated that there were 5,000 living in 500 houses. More measured figures were 3,013 residents recorded in the 1881 census and 5005—living in approximately 1000 houses—recorded in the 1891 census. By 1911 the port was the State's second largest city and had a population over half that of Adelaide city. By 2006 the population had declined; that year's census records 1,099 living in c. 560 houses. The 2006 census also shows that suburb's median family income is low to average for Australia, though median individual and household income is lower, indicating a low socioeconomic status for the area. Unemployment is relatively high for the region and educational attainment moderately low in comparison to other Metropolitan Adelaide local government areas. Over half of the population identified as Christian—mostly Catholic and Anglican—though almost a third expressed no religious affiliation.\n\nThe office of the City of Port Adelaide Enfield is in the Council Chambers in St Vincent Street. The Council area is divided into seven wards that span across 51 suburbs and the current Mayor is Claire Boan.\n\nPort Adelaide is the namesake of its state electorate and its current elected representative is Susan Close (Labor).\n\nUp until 2019, Port Adelaide was the namesake of its federal electorate, however, the suburb of Port Adelaide is now under the electorate of Hindmarsh and the current elected representative is Mark Butler (Labor).\n\nA railway museum was created by rail preservationists, and opened in 1963 on Railway Terrace, Mile End. The mostly outdoor exhibits remained on this site until 1988; during this period the gauge steam train known as Bub was built. Involvement of the History Trust of South Australia and receipt of a $2 million Australian Bicentennial Commemorative Grant enabled the museum's relocation to Port Adelaide in 1988. On 10 December of that year the Port Dock Railway Museum was opened by State Premier John Bannon. The museum was sited in the former Port Dock railway station, and retained the \"Port Dock\" name until 2001 when it was renamed the National Railway Museum. A significant change in 2001 was the opening of the Commonwealth Railways display pavilion. It was built with the assistance of a grant received under the Federation Grant Scheme; a scheme that commemorated the hundredth anniversary of the Federation of Australia. The pavilion was officially opened in October by the Honorable Peter McGauran, then Federal Minister for the Arts and the Centenary of Federation.\n\nVisitors can ride in historic railway and custom-built narrow gauge carriages. \"Bub\", a 457 mm steam locomotive, and Ken, a 457 mm diesel locomotive, take passengers on a loop track around the two main pavilions. Another 457 mm steam locomotive, \"Bill\", is used for some of the year on a seafront rail line between Semaphore and Fort Glanville Conservation Park. \"Peronne\", a narrow gauge steam locomotive, is used for further runs during special events. This locomotive was built in 1919 and used by Broken Hill Associated Smelters at Port Pirie until 1964.\n\nThe museum is an independent entity, run by volunteers and a small paid staff. It has track and trains representing all three main rail gauges used in South Australia: broad (); standard (); and narrow (). Locomotives and rail stock fill two large display pavilions, and are accompanied by other historic railway related displays. On site is the South Australian Heritage Register listed Port Dock Goods Shed, the last remaining building from the former railway station. It was built in the 1870s and showcases the wooden construction techniques used by the South Australian Railways in the 19th century. The museum has a railway-related retail shop, hosts special events including an Annual \"Friends of Thomas\" show. The 1947 cafeteria car, or the entire site, can be hired.\n\nOn Lipson Street, within a historic warehouse, is the South Australian Maritime Museum.\n\nAfter a 14-year campaign the \"City of Adelaide\" Preservation Trust was successful in its bid to return the historic 1864 clipper \"City of Adelaide\" from Scotland to Port Adelaide, where she finally arrived in the inner harbour on 6 February 2014.\n\nThe \"City of Adelaide\" has a strong connection with South Australia, to which she made 23 voyages between 1864 and 1886, bringing an estimated 889 passengers who came to settle in South Australia.\n\nThe clipper's hull is being temporarily stored on a barge moored in Dock 1 of the port's inner harbour for the next 6–12 months, until a permanent location is selected and prepared. A major celebration was planned for the ship's 150th anniversary, on 17 May 2014.\n\nThe South Australian Aviation Museum is the State's official aviation museum. It is run by an independent non-profit voluntary organisation that is accredited by the History Trust of South Australia. The museum was formed in 1984 at Glenelg and relocated in 1986 to a former Port Adelaide Flourmill. It relocated again in 1996, to an aircraft hangar also in Port Adelaide, and in January 2006 opened on its present site in Lipson Street, adjacent to the railway museum.\n\nIn 1991 the State Historical Aviation Collection became part of the museum. This collection was formerly held by the National Motor Museum in Birdwood. A collection of rockets from Woomera was received for display in 1996. Amongst the exhibits are a Spitfire Mark VC that was recovered after crashing in Papua New Guinea in 1943, a de Havilland Sea Venom formerly from the aircraft carrier and a Douglas C-47B (Dakota) that was used for Government VIP transportation.\n\nThe Austbuilt Maritime Museum, operated by the Port Adelaide Historical Society, is located on Fletcher Road, Peterhead. It houses an extensive collection of maritime memorabilia accumulated by the late Keith Le Leu, who famously bought the steam tug \"Fearless\" for $1 in Brisbane in 1972 and steamed it to Adelaide. This vessel, currently owned by the South Australian Maritime Museum, remains on hardstand at Cruickshanks Corner near the Birkenhead Bridge, while its fate is still to be determined. During his lifetime, Keith Le Leu also donated other maritime artefacts for public display around Port Adelaide. These include two large anchors that sit outside the Birkenhead Tavern and another outside Le Fevre High School. The museum and these anchors form nodes along the Port Adelaide Anchor Trail, which was created in 2020.\n\nThe Australian Museum of Childhood displays a collection of toys that were manufactured in Australia from the 1890s onwards. The toys were collected by Alan Griffiths over a 30-year period.\n\nPeople who lived around the Port Adelaide area include:\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1963144", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1963144", "title": "Celestron", "text": "Celestron\n\nCelestron is a company based in Torrance, California, United States, that manufactures telescopes and distributes telescopes, binoculars, spotting scopes, microscopes, and accessories manufactured by its parent company, the Synta Technology Corporation of Taiwan.\n\nThe predecessor of Celestron was Valor Electronics, an electronics and military components firm founded in 1955 by Tom Johnson. Johnson became involved with telescopes when he built a 6\" reflecting telescope for his two sons. In 1960, Johnson established the \"Astro-Optical\" division of Valor, which would later become Celestron.\n\nBy 1964, Johnson had founded \"Celestron Pacific\" as a division of Valor Electronics offering Schmidt-Cassegrain telescopes from 4\" to 22\". In 1970 Celestron introduced its \"C8\" 8\" diameter 2032 mm focal length, ƒ10 telescope, the first of a new line of telescopes built using methods developed by Celestron to produce Schmidt-Cassegrains at a high volume and low cost. These models made significant inroads into the amateur astronomical and educational communities.\n\nJohnson, the founder of the company, sold Celestron in 1980. Celestron was acquired by Tasco in 1997 and almost went out of business when Tasco folded in 2001.\n\nIn early 2002 Celestron's rival, Meade Instruments, attempted a takeover but a bankruptcy court allowed the sale of the company back to its original owners. The company had been U.S. owned until April 2005 when it was acquired by SW Technology Corporation, a Delaware company and affiliate of Synta Technology Corporation of Taiwan. Synta is a manufacturer of astronomy equipment and related components and at that time had been a supplier for Celestron for over 15 years.\n\nOn March 13, 2012, Tom Johnson died at the age of 89.\n\nCelestron was the first large scale commercial manufacturer of the Schmidt-Cassegrain telescope, introducing its \"C8\" 8\" diameter 2032 mm focal length, ƒ10 telescope in 1970. The primary innovation Celestron/Tom Johnson came up with was a way to produce Schmidt corrector plates using a vacuum to pull the glass blanks into a pre-shaped curve mold called a \"master block\" during the polishing process. This allowed for the inexpensive mass production of corrector plates of uniform shape. The telescope line had a trademark matte orange tube (changed to glossy black in 1980, and back to semi-gloss orange in 2006), and double-fork equatorial mount, and became a popular large aperture, compact design.\n\nOther telescope product lines include the CGE, CGEM, CPC, NexStar, Omni, Onyx, AstroMaster, Ambassador, TravelScope, and PowerSeeker product lines. These range from large computerized reflectors with GPS to decorative/casual viewing telescopes with brass tube refractors on wood mounts.\n\nCelestron products (as of 2010) include:\n\nCelestron telescopes offer the option to use computerized location of astronomical objects as well as mounts that will aim themselves at any given object, a technology known as GoTo. Most of the computerized models can be connected to an external computer via an RS-232 cable, allowing them to be controlled by a third-party astronomy program or connected to a GPS receiver. GPS receivers are useful for programming the telescope with its precise location and time, which aids the alignment process required for GoTo.\n\nSome motorized telescopes sold during the mid 80s to early 90s, including the Celestron Compustar® which used a form of GoTo technology, were not programmed to allow for dates after 2000; making some Celestron products susceptible to the Y2K bug. However, a third party chip to update the computer is available for some products.\n\nSince their founding in 1972, Meade Instruments has been one of Celestron's chief rivals. Design, sizing, introduction, and pricing of each company's products lines and models have been in response to their competition with each other. There has been litigation over infringement of patents between the two companies, one instance regarding GoTo technology. In September 2013, Sunny Optics Inc, a unit of the Chinese firm Ningbo Sunny Electronic Co Ltd, completed the acquisition of the entire share capital of Meade.\n\n\n"}

The IET is now the second largest engineering society in the world next to the IEEE. The IET has the authority to establish professional registration of engineers (Chartered Engineer or Incorporated Engineer) through the Engineering Council. The IEEE does not have the authority to replicate the registration process in its complementary environment.\n\nThe IIE traces its heritage to the Vulcanic Society that was founded in 1884. The Vulcanic Society was formed by a group of apprentices from the works of Maudslay, Son & Field Ltd, in Lambeth, London. This society went through three name changes before it became the Junior Institution of Engineers in 1902, which became the Institution of General Technician Engineers in 1970 and the Institute of Mechanical and General Technician Engineers (IMGTechE) in 1976.

In October 2015, the school announced that it would extend co-education to all years, commencing in 2016 with an intake of girls in Years 3 and 4. By 2018 the school became fully co-educational. \n\nThe school was founded in 1929 when the existing Monaro Grammar School was relocated to Canberra from Cooma. The foundation stone was laid on 4 December 1928 by Prime Minister Stanley Bruce. Initially it was attended by only 63 students, but has grown considerably since the early 1950s to a total attendance of 1,749 students as of June 2015.\n\nThe school has educated one Australian Prime Minister and has a long list of notable alumni.\n\nIn the primary school, the Australian Curriculum and Early Years Learning Framework requirements are incorporated through International Baccalaureate Primary Years Programme.\n\nIn the senior school, from years 7 to 10, the school follows the Australia Curriculum and the ACT \"Every chance to learn\" curriculum framework.

They live wedged in between the Nandi, Luo and Luhya (Luyia) peoples. Among the Luo they are known as \"nyangóóri\", but to the Terik, this is a derogatory term. The Terik call themselves \"Terikeek\"; in their usage, 'Terik' refers to their language, land, and culture.\n\nAccording to their own oral history the Terik are \"people of Mount Elgon\"; this is confirmed by linguistic evidence as well as by Bong'om traditions that \"the people who later called themselves Terik were still Bong'om when they left Elgon and moved away in a southern direction\" (Roeder 1986:142).\n\nIn pre-colonial times, relations between the Terik and the Nandi (their eastern neighbours) were characterized by mutual raids for cattle, land and women, a perspective still alive among old Terik people. However, in recent years the Terik have increasingly come to perceive the Nandi as friendly relatives. A number of factors have contributed to this change in perspective.\n\nTerritorial expansion of the Luhya people (the western neighbours of the Terik) has strained Terik-Luhyia relations during the last decades. Luhya are felt to be a threat to the Terik identity and intermarriage has drastically reduced. The expansion of the Luhya (especially the Logoli group) into Terik territory has been a cause of population pressure. This, along with dwindling agricultural potential in the area, has in the second half of the twentieth century motivated many of the Terik to move eastwards, into 'Nandiland' as they call it. Some Terik even claim that they abandoned their homeland because they were afraid of the Luhya.\n\nThe Terik have become increasingly oriented at and assimilated to the Nandi. One of the results is a change towards a Nandi-type age set system. The Terik traditionally have twelve age sets, whereas the Nandi have seven. Terik living in Nandiland tend to name a smaller number of age sets than those living in traditional Terik territory. Terik boys also undergo initiation together with Nandi boys. Assimilation to the Nandi has furthermore been accelerated by the growth of a common \"Kalenjin\" consciousness, a process which started in the early 1950s.\n\nIn recent years, migration into Nandiland has decreased, and the position of the Terik language has been strengthened. Terik schools now teach Terik language.\n\n\n"}

Høiby\n\nSven Olaf Bjarte Høiby (14 November 1936 – 21 March 2007) was the father of Crown Princess Mette-Marit of Norway. After his daughter married the Crown Prince, he became a national celebrity due to a number of articles in the yellow press, especially \"Se og Hør\".\n\nHe and Mette-Marit's mother, Marit Tjessem, divorced in 1984. After the divorce, Mette-Marit grew up with her mother, stepfather, and siblings, while visiting her father regularly on weekends. She later revealed in an interview that her father also suffered from alcoholism, which she \"had to hide\" from her friends. Høiby worked for several years as a journalist in a local newspaper and as a small-scale advertiser and publisher in his hometown. By the time his daughter's relationship to the Crown Prince was publicly known, he had retired from working and was receiving a disability pension.\n\nIn his younger days, he participated in athletics. Among others, he achieved a time of 58.0 seconds in the 400 metres hurdles in 1959. He represented the club Kristiansands IF.\n\nSven O. Høiby became something of a controversial figure following his daughter's marriage to the Crown Prince. The national tabloids and especially the gossip magazine \"Se og Hør\" printed several stories where he gave interviews and was presented in less-than-flattering situations.\n\n\"\"En helt vanlig dag på jobben\"\" (\"\"Just another day at the office\"\"), a book published by former \"Se og Hør\" journalist Håvard Melnæs, who knew Høiby personally, reveals that Høiby was being paid up to 400,000 Norwegian krone a year by the magazine to appear in articles, and for sharing private pictures and information about his daughter's childhood. The magazine even purchased a mobile phone for him (he couldn't afford one himself) and paid his phone bills as a bonus for his \"services\".\n\nDuring this period he made several outspoken comments, and he announced that he was writing a book about Mette-Marit's young son, Marius, her child from a previous relationship. The book never materialised, but the relationship between father and daughter had been strained by this, and Høiby giving information about her to the tabloids. Høiby further estranged himself from his daughter by marrying Renate Barsgård, a former stripper half his age. The couple divorced after three months. At their wedding, folk singer Sputnik was best man.\n\nThe magazine and other tabloids have been criticized for taking advantage of a man who seemed to have a less than sound judgment on what kind of articles to participate in.

{"id": "1963178", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1963178", "title": "O-Town", "text": "O-Town\n\nO-Town (also known as OTWN/OTOWN) is an American boy band formed from the first season of the MTV-produced reality television series \"Making the Band\" in 2000. As of 2015 the group consisted of Erik-Michael Estrada, Trevor Penick, Jacob Underwood, and Dan Miller. The line up also included Ashley Parker Angel. Ikaika Kahoano was originally part of the band but was replaced by Miller after dropping out of the group. \n\nAfter releasing two albums near the end of the boy band fad of the late 1990s and early 2000s, the group disbanded in 2003. The group was originally managed by Lou Pearlman during their first season of \"Making the Band\", but later managed by Mike Cronin and Mike Morin for their debut album and remaining television seasons.\n\nO-Town was assembled for the first season of the ABC reality television series \"Making the Band\". Originally, Ikaika Kahoano was one of the five members selected, but he and his family decided he should go to med school instead causing him to back out, making way for Dan Miller (who was selected by the four remaining members). The ratings of \"Making the Band\" were strong enough to warrant a second (and eventually third) season. These subsequent seasons depicted their development as a pop group, following their tours and performances. Such events included the development of their second album, \"O2\", their transition to a new record label (J Records), and an ongoing effort to establish themselves. The third season of \"Making the Band\" was broadcast on MTV, instead of the original network, ABC.\n\nAfter season one, Clive Davis of J Records signed O-Town to his new label. Davis believed in the marketability of the group, and scheduled O-Town to be the label's debut act. Their first release, the self-titled \"O-Town\", boosted by the publicity of the weekly television series, sold more than three million copies. Their first single, \"Liquid Dreams\", was the first single to reach number 1 on the Billboard singles sales chart without making the Airplay chart. The single managed to peak at number 10 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart.\nHowever, their novelty as television personalities soon wore off, and O-Town would enjoy only temporary success. Jacob Underwood even commented, on a \"Making the Band\" recap of seasons one and two, that after \"Liquid Dreams\", they alone had to prove themselves to the public that they weren't a \"flash-in-the-pan\" success. In the late spring of 2001, O-Town released \"All or Nothing\" (July 21, 2001), and the song became their biggest hit of their career as a group. \"All or Nothing\" reached #3 on the Billboard Hot 100 and the song was nominated for numerous awards, including \"Song of the Year\" during the 2001 Radio Music Awards. The success of \"All or Nothing\" granted them the ability to air another season of Making the Band. Near the end of the third season, O-town fans and television viewers watched as they tried to take their careers to the next level by writing their own music, earn the respect of their industry peers, and market themselves beyond being labeled as a \"boy band\". They never found the market acceptance they sought.\n\nIn 2001, the group was the opening act for Britney Spears' Dream Within a Dream Tour in the US.\n\nTheir second album, \"O2\", originally scheduled for the summer of 2002 (and planned debut single \"I Showed Her\" a few weeks before release), was delayed numerous times, and as time passed between their last U.S. single, the moderately successful \"We Fit Together\", and the anticipation of \"O2\", without any new singles getting radio airplay and no new episodes of \"Making the Band\", the popularity of O-Town began to wane.\n\nO-Town had burst onto the scene when boy bands and other types of bubblegum pop were beginning to decline and lose their influence. Sales of O-Town's second album, \"O2\", were below expectations. Their debut single for \"O2\", \"These are the Days\" eventually broke into the Billboard Top 40 at 40, and critics, such as those from Billboard.com, praised their second single, \"I Showed Her\" for being a well-developed song. Despite this moderate success, \"O2\" was nowhere near the commercial success of their first album, \"O-Town\", and the band went on tour in the summer of 2003 to promote the album. J Records dropped the band from the label in November 2003.\n\nThough fans tried to organize campaigns to get O-Town signed to a new label, their efforts met with little success. O-Town sent a personal e-mail to all their fans, via the now defunct Inside O-town.com, thanking them for the great memories and experience they had shared together. In the e-mail, O-Town themselves stated that they had disbanded due to the changing climate of the music industry, along with certain financial problems, hinting that Lou Pearlman and his company, Trans Continental Records, may have been involved with these issues. At that point, Pearlman had already experienced many legal challenges by previous acts managed by his company, Trans Continental, including highly successful acts such as the Backstreet Boys, 'N Sync, and Aaron Carter.\n\nThe members of O-Town moved on to solo careers. The most successful member was Ashley Parker Angel, who was signed to Universal's Blackground Records, and also given his own reality show on MTV, \"There and Back\". Released in 2006, Ashley's solo debut album was heavily promoted but did not achieve solid sales numbers. In January 2007, he began playing the role of Link Larkin in the Broadway production of \"Hairspray\". Ex-bandmate, Trevor Penick, now professionally known as \"Tre Scott\", was signed to Mach 1 Music, and worked with established industry producer Eddie Galan. After the disbandment of O-Town in 2003, Trevor worked for Wood Ranch BBQ & Grill as a waiter. The other band members retained a fanbase and had success in their own right, as evidenced by their Myspace profiles. Erik stayed in the music business and went on to collaborate and co-write songs for other artists. Jacob Underwood went on to start his own country band \"Jacobs Loc\".\n\nBack in January 2011, rumors were swirling that a reunion was in the works for the band. TMZ reported that Erik, Trevor, Dan & Jacob have returned to the studio to record the follow-up to O2, however, it was confirmed that Ashley Parker Angel declined the offer from the guys. Ashley told TMZ in a following article his explanation. \"O-Town was one of the greatest chapters of my life, so when the idea of a reunion was brought to me, of course I was intrigued. However I have made the decision not to be a part of an O-Town reunion. It was a difficult decision, but ultimately necessary to move on with the next chapter of my career.\" He has, however, given the guys his blessing for them to reunite without him. When interviewed about their rejection, Erik said that the guys eventually come to terms with it, but admitted \"I would just think they would want to come on board and be a part of it ... but they don’t and that's cool.\" \n\nThe remaining guys continued to pursue the reunion over the next few years, keeping details very private.\n\nOn May 28, 2014, O-Town released a preview of the single \"Skydive\" on SoundCloud. The single is from their third studio album \"Lines & Circles\". The album was released on August 24, 2014.\n\nIn 2017, they premiered a new single \"Empty Space\" in addition to announcing a new EP. They also announced a new 2017 tour featuring Ryan Cabrera on select dates, as well as some spots on the \"I Love the 90s\" nationwide tour.\n\nTheir \"Part 1\" EP is set for an August 4, 2017 release.\n\nIn June 2019, O-Town planned on filing a trademark for their band name, which Universal Music Group believed was too similar to the Motown Records label.\n\nOn August 2, 2019, they released \"The O.T.W.N. Album\".\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1963187", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1963187", "title": "Institution of Engineering and Technology", "text": "Institution of Engineering and Technology\n\nThe Institution of Engineering and Technology (IET) is a multidisciplinary professional engineering institution. The IET was formed in 2006 from two separate institutions: the Institution of Electrical Engineers (IEE), dating back to 1871, and the Institution of Incorporated Engineers (IIE) dating back to 1884. Its worldwide membership is currently in excess of 168,000. The IET's main offices are in Savoy Place in London, England and at Michael Faraday House in Stevenage, England.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the IET has the authority to establish professional registration for the titles of Chartered Engineer, Incorporated Engineer, Engineering Technician, and ICT Technician, as a licensed member institution of the Engineering Council.\n\nThe IET is registered as a charity in England and Wales, and in Scotland.\n\nDiscussions started in 2004 between the IEE and the IIE about merging to form a new institution. In September 2005, both institutions held votes of the merger and the members voted in favour (73.5% IEE, 95.7% IIE). This merger also needed government approval, so a petition was then made to the Privy Council of the United Kingdom for a Supplemental Charter, to allow the creation of the new institution. This was approved by the Privy Council on December 14, 2005, and the new institution emerged on March 31, 2006.\n\nThe Society of Telegraph Engineers (STE) was formed on May 17, 1871, and it published the \"Journal of the Society of Telegraph Engineers\" from 1872 through 1880. Carl Wilhelm Siemens was first President of IEE in 1872. On December 22, 1880, the STE was renamed as the Society of Telegraph Engineers and of Electricians and, as part of this change, it renamed its journal the \"Journal of the Society of Telegraph Engineers and of Electricians\" (1881 – 82) and later the \"Journal of the Society of Telegraph-Engineers and Electricians\" (1883 – 88). Following a meeting of its Council on 10 November 1887, it was decided to adopt the name of the Institution of Electrical Engineers (IEE). As part of this change, its Journal was renamed \"Journal of the Institution of Electrical Engineers\" in 1889, and it kept this title through 1963. In 1921, the Institution was Incorporated by royal charter and, following mergers with the Institution of Electronic and Radio Engineers (IERE) in 1988 and the Institution of Manufacturing Engineers (IMfgE) in 1990, it had a worldwide membership of around 120,000. The IEE represented the engineering profession, operated Professional Networks (worldwide groups of engineers sharing common technical and professional interests), had an educational role including the accreditation of degree courses and operated schemes to provide awards scholarships, grants and prizes. It was well known for publication of the \"IEE Wiring Regulations\" which now continue to be written by the IET and to be published by the British Standards Institution as BS 7671.\n\nThe IET hosts the archive for the Women's Engineering Society (WES) and it has also provided office space for WES since 2005.\n\nThe modern Institution of Incorporated Engineers (IIE) traced its heritage to The Vulcanic Society that was founded in 1884 and became the Junior Institution of Engineers in 1902, which became the Institution of General Technician Engineers in 1970. It changed its name in 1976 to the Institution of Mechanical and General Technician Engineers. At this point it merged with the Institution of Technician Engineers in Mechanical Engineering and formed the Institution of Mechanical Incorporated Engineers in 1988. The Institution of Engineers in Charge, which was founded in 1895, was merged into the Institution of Mechanical Incorporated Engineers (IMechIE) in 1990.\n\nThe Institution of Electrical and Electronic Technician Engineers, the Society of Electronic and Radio Technicians, and the Institute of Practitioners in Radio and Electronics merged in 1990 to form the Institution of Electronics and Electrical Incorporated Engineers (IEEIE).\n\nThe IIE was formed in April 1998 by the merger of The Institution of Electronic and Electrical Incorporated Engineers (IEEIE), The Institution of Mechanical Incorporated Engineers (IMechIE), and The Institute of Engineers and Technicians (IET, not to be confused with the later-formed Institution of Engineering and Technology). In 1999 there was a further merger with The Institution of Incorporated Executive Engineers (IIExE). The IIE had a worldwide membership of approximately 40,000.\n\nThe Institution of Manufacturing Engineers (IMfgE), formerly the Institution of Production Engineers (IProdE), was founded following the initiative of one H. E. Honer who wrote to a technical periodical titled ‘Engineering Production’ suggesting that the time was ripe to form an institution for the specialised interests of engineers engaged in manufacture. As a result of correspondence generated by this letter a meeting was held at Cannon Street Hotel in London on 26 February 1921. At this meeting it was decided to form the IProdE in order to; establish the status and designation of production or manufacturing engineers; to promote the science of practical production in industry; and to facilitate the interchange of ideas between engineers, manufacturers and other specialists.\nThe term ‘production engineering’ came into use to describe the management of factory production techniques first developed by Henry Ford, which had expanded greatly during the First World War. The IProdE was incorporated in 1931 and was granted its armorial bearings in 1937. From the outset the Institution operated through decentralised branches called local sections wherever a sufficient number of members existed. These local sections were self-governing and elected their own officers. Local sections held monthly meetings at which papers were read and discussed.\nOutstanding papers were published in the Institution's journal. Named papers commemorating the work of the following eminent production engineers were read at national meetings: Viscount Nuffield, Sir Alfred Herbert, Colonel George Bray, Lord Sempill, E. H. Hancock, and J. N. Kirby. National and regional conferences were also arranged dealing with specific industrial problems. Active councils were gradually established worldwide including in Australia, Canada, India, New Zealand, and South Africa. The Institution's education committee established a graduate examination which all junior entrants undertook from 1932 onwards. An examination for Associate Membership was introduced in 1951.\nThe Second World War further accelerated developments in production engineering and by 1945 membership of the IProdE stood at 5,000. The 1950s and 1960s were perhaps the most fruitful period for the Institution. Major conferences such as ‘The Automatic Factory’ in 1955 ensured that the Institution held a place at the forefront of production technology. A Royal Charter was granted in 1964 and membership stood at over 17,000 by 1969.\nIn 1981 the IProdE instituted four medals as part of its Diamond Jubilee celebrations comprising; the International Award, the Mensforth Gold Medal, the Nuffield Award and the Silver Medal. The Mensforth Gold Medal was named after Sir Eric Mensforth, founder and chairman of Westland Helicopters and a former IProdE President. The medal was awarded to British recipients who had made an outstanding contribution to the advancement of production engineering technology. Today the Mensforth Manufacturing Gold Medal is the IET's premier manufacturing award.\nFinancial constraints, a slowing in membership and a blurring of distinctions between the various branches of engineering led the IProdE to merger proposals in the late 1980s. The Institution of Electrical Engineers (IEE) had interests very close to those of the IProdE. The IEE was a much larger organisation than the IProdE and the proposal was that the IProdE should be represented as a specialist division within the IEE. While these talks were reaching fruition in 1991 the IProdE changed its name to the Institution of Manufacturing Engineers. A merger with the IEE took place the same year, with the IMfgE becoming the IEE's new Manufacturing Division.\n\nThe IET is governed by the President and Board of Trustees . The IET Council, on the other hand, serves as the advisory and consultative body, representing views of the members at large and offering advice to the Board of Trustees. Since founding the IET, several prominent engineers have served as its President and the recent Presidents are listed below:\n\nThe IET represents the engineering profession in matters of public concern and assists governments to make the public aware of engineering and technological issues. It provides advice on all areas of engineering, regularly advising Parliament and other agencies.\n\nThe IET also grants Chartered Engineer, Incorporated Engineer, Engineering Technician, and ICT Technician professional designations on behalf of the Engineering Council UK. IEng is roughly equivalent to North American Professional Engineer designations and CEng is set at a higher level. Both designations have far greater geographical recognition. This is made possible through a number of networks for engineers established by the IET including the Professional Networks, worldwide groups of engineers sharing common technical and professional interests. Through the IET website, these networks provide up-to-date sector-specific news, stock a library of technical articles and give members the opportunity to exchange knowledge and ideas with peer groups through dedicated discussion forums. Particular areas of focus include education, IT, energy and the environment.\n\nThe IET has an educational role, seeking to support its members through their careers by offering a professional home for life, producing advice and guidance at all levels to secure the future of engineering. For instance, the IET accredits degree courses worldwide in subjects relevant to electrical, electronic, manufacturing and information engineering. In addition, it secures funding for professional development schemes for engineering graduates including awards scholarships, grants and prizes.\n\nFor the public, the IET website provides factfiles on topics such as solar power, nuclear power, fuel cells, micro-generation and the possible effects on health of mobile phones and power lines. The IET runs the bibliographic information service Inspec, which is a major indexing database of scientific and technical literature and publishes books, journals such as Electronics Letters, magazines such as Engineering & Technology and conference proceedings. Over 80,000 technical articles are available via the IET Digital Library.\n\nIET.tv is one of the world's largest collated resources of authoritative and multidisciplinary engineering and technology content. Comprising in excess of 6,500 presentation, lecture and training videos, this high quality engineering information offers research insight, workflow solutions and access to inspirational events and expert communities. With a range of search and user functionalities, IET.tv enables online video access to a range of topics and expertise. IET.tv also has an YouTube presence, where it publishes a wide variety of content related to engineering and technology.\n\nThe IET has several categories of membership, some with designatory postnominals:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe IET has a journals publishing programme, totalling 24 titles such as \"IET Software\" as of March 2012 (with the addition of \"IET Biometrics\" and \"IET Networks\"). The journals contain both original and review-oriented papers relating to various disciplines in electrical, electronics, computing, control, biomedical and communications technologies.\n\n\"Electronics Letters\" is a peer-reviewed rapid-communication journal, which publishes short original research papers every two weeks. Its scope covers developments in all electronic and electrical engineering related fields. Also available to Electronics Letters subscribers are something called the \"Insight Letters\".\n\n\"Micro & Nano Letters\", first published in 2006, specialises in the rapid online publication of short research papers concentrating on advances in miniature and ultraminiature structures and systems that have at least one dimension ranging from a few tens of micrometres to a few nanometres. It offers a rapid route for international dissemination of research findings generated by researchers from the micro and nano communities.\n\nThe IET Achievement Medals are awarded to individuals who have made major and distinguished contributions in the various sectors of science, engineering and technology. The medals are named after famous engineers and persons, such as Michael Faraday, John Ambrose Fleming, J. J. Thomson, and Oliver Heaviside. The judging panel look for outstanding and sustained excellence in one or more activities. For example: research and development, innovation, design, manufacturing, technical management, and the promotion of engineering and technology.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe IET offer Diamond Jubilee undergraduate scholarships for first year students studying an IET accredited degree. Winners receive between £1,000 to £2,000 per year, for up to four years to help with their studies. Eligibility is partially based on the exam results at the final year of school prior to university. IET also offers postgraduate scholarships intended for IET members carrying out doctoral research, the postgraduate scholarships offered by the IET assist members with awards of up to £10,000, to further research engineering related topics at universities. The IET Engineering Horizons Bursary are offered at £1,000 per year for undergraduate students on IET accredited degree courses in the UK and apprentices starting an IET Approved Apprenticeship scheme. For those UK residents who have overcome personal challenges to pursue an engineering education.\n\nThe IET refers to its region-specific branches as \"Local Networks\".\n\nIET Australia is the Australian Local Network of the IET (Institution of Engineering and Technology). The Australian Local Network of the IET has representation in all the states and territories of Australia. These include the state branches, their associated Younger Members Sections, and university sections in Australia. The Younger Members Sections are divided in categories based on each state, e.g. IET YMS New South Wales (IET YMS NSW).\n\nThe IET Toronto Network covers IET activities in the Southern and Western areas of Ontario and has approximately 500 members. The first Canadian Branch of the IEE (now the IET) was inaugurated by John Thompson, FIEE, and Harry Copping, FIEE, in Toronto in the early 1950s.\n\nIET Hong Kong is the Hong Kong Local Network (formerly Branch) of the IET (Institution of Engineering and Technology). The Hong Kong Local Network of the IET has representations in the Asian region and provides a critical link into mainland China. It includes six sections, i.e. Electronics & Communications Section (ECS); Informatics and Control Technologies Section (ICTS); Management Section(MS); Power and Energy Section (PES); Manufacturing & Industrial Engineering (MIES); Railway Section( RS), as well as the Younger Members Section. It has over 5,000 members and activities are coordinated locally. It is one of the professional organisations for chartered engineers in Hong Kong.\n\nIET Italy Local Network was established in 2007 by a group of active members led by Dr M Fiorini with the purpose to represent locally the aims and services of the IET. The vision of sharing and advancing knowledge throughout the global science, engineering and technology community to enhance people's lives is achieved building-up an open, flexible and global knowledge network supported by individuals, companies and institutions and facilitated by the IET and its members.\n\nAn IET India Office was established in 2006. India has eight Local Networks: Bangalore, Chennai, Delhi, Kanyakumari, Kolkata, Mumbai, Nashik and Pune. The prestigious IET Pinkerton Lecture is presented annually in Bangalore.\n\nAn IET in Kenya was established on November 16 2011. It is registered under the Societies Act Section 10 Certificate of Registration No.35998. The Institution has been enacted in the Kenya National Assembly of the Engineering Technologists Act No. 23 of 2016. With support of Faculty at the newly established Technical University of Kenya (formerly the Kenya Polytechnic) and Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture & Technology, the proposed bill seeks to register Technologists, Technicians and Craftsmen, who were previously excluded from registration by the Engineering Board of Kenya.\n\nIET Kuwait community was established in 2013 by Dr. Abdelrahman Abdelazim. The community is very active in the region, overseeing 4 student chapters in Kuwait universities. The community's most notable event was the 2015 GCC robotics challenge, the challenge witnessed collaboration with many networks in the region.\n\nIET Malaysia Local Network has more than 1,500 members located in Malaysia. In addition, the Malaysia Local Network has encouraged the formation of On Campus in public and private universities. These On Campuses are mentored by the Young Professional Section (YPS) of IET. As of December 2016, there are a total of 10 active On Campuses.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1963198", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1963198", "title": "Seletar Airport", "text": "Seletar Airport\n\nSeletar Airport is an airport in the north-east of Singapore, approximately 16 kilometres away from Singapore Changi Airport and about 20 kilometres away from the city centre. The airfield opened in 1928 as RAF Seletar, a military airbase of the UK Royal Air Force. In 1971 the base was handed over to the Singapore government.\n\nRAF Seletar was a Royal Air Force station in Singapore between 1928 and 1971. Plans for establishing an airfield, flying boat and naval base in Singapore were first agreed by the RAF in 1921. In 1923, two sites in the northern region of the island were approved. The first planes to arrive at the base were four Supermarine Southampton seaplanes on 28 February 1928.\n\nRAF Seletar served was also used for civilian flights from 1930 to 1937, when Kallang Airport was opened.\n\nAmy Johnson landed at Seletar in May 1930 on her UK – Australia flight in her Gipsy Moth named 'Jason'. Amelia Earhart also landed there in June 1937 on her world flight attempt in an Lockheed 10 Electra.\n\nWith the threat of war in the area, the RAF started building up their forces in the Far East in the late 1930s and early 1940s. Seletar airfield was the target of carpet bombing when Japanese navy bombers conducted the first air raid on Singapore, sometime after their ground forces invaded Kota Bahru. It was abandoned when the Japanese took Johore Bahru, which brought their artillery in range of the airfield.\n\nWhen the Japanese launched their invasion of Malaya and Singapore, Seletar housed four RAF units. 205 Sqn operated Consolidated Catalina flying boats, and No. 36 and No. 100 Squadron RAF operated obsolete Vickers Vildebeest torpedo bombers (as well as five Fairey Albacores acquired by 36 Sqn to supplement its Vildebeests). These flying squadrons were serviced by 151 Maintenance Unit RAF.\n\n21 Squadron, Royal Australian Air Force was also based at Seletar in 1941–42, and was in the process of converting from lightly-armed CAC Wirraway trainers to Brewster F2A Buffalo fighters, when hostilities began.\n\nThese units stayed until Jan–Feb 1942, soon before the surrender to the invading Japanese.\n\nDuring the Japanese occupation, Seletar as was in the case of Sembawang came under the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service while Tengah fell under the jurisdiction of the Imperial Japanese Army Air Force. From 1942 through 1945, a number of IJN squadrons were based or transited through Seletar mainly, for training. Among the units known to be based at Seletar during this time were \"936th Kōkūtai\" (B5N Kate, D3A Val and E13A1 Jake), \"381st Kōkūtai\" (A6M Zero and J2M Raiden). The \"601st Kōkūtai\" was also stationed there for training early before its destruction on board Japanese aircraft carriers during the Battle of the Philippine Sea (Marianas Turkey Shoot) in June. Seletar's present runway was built during the Japanese Occupation.\n\nAfter World War II, the base went back to the RAF and, in the late 1940s and 1950s, the base was heavily involved in the Malayan Emergency, with Beaufighters, Spitfires and Mosquitos based there while operating against Malayan Communist insurgents. Among the many squadrons based there during this time were Nos 60, 81 and 205 Sqns of the RAF. The base was also the home of 390 MU – the Maintenance Base for the whole of the Far East Air Force - FEAF.\n\nDuring the 1960s, RAF Seletar was home base to No's 103 and 110 Squadrons, both of which were equipped with Westland Whirlwind Mk 10 helicopters and to 34 Squadron, which was equipped with Blackburn Beverley transports. All three Squadrons (among several others) were involved with support of operations in North Borneo during the Indonesia-Malaysia confrontation. From June 1962, 66 Squadron (led by Sqn Leader Gray) with their Bristol 192 Belvedere helicopters were also based at Seletar, and were sent on frequent tours and detachments to Kuching, Brunei, Labuan and Butterworth as part of the Borneo hearts and minds campaign (the squadron was later disbanded in March 1969). The helicopter squadrons provided a search and rescue service for the Singapore area. The station was also, at that time, home to 209 Squadron, equipped with Single and Twin Pioneer aircraft. 65 Squadron based at Seletar operated Bloodhound Mk II surface-to-air missiles as anti-aircraft defence from 1 January 1964 until the squadron was disbanded on 30 March 1970 with the equipment and role handed over to 170 Squadron, Republic of Singapore Air Force. Auster aircraft were flown during the Emergency and Confrontation periods in troop/enemy spotting patrols.\n\nIn December 1966, three Andover CC Mk1 arrived to replace the ageing Vickers Valetta C1 aircraft of 52 Sqn. 52 Squadron was later reformed in March 1967 after the arrival of a further three aircraft. By now, Confrontation had finished and with no purpose the squadron moved to Changi in 1968 before being disbanded in January 1970.\n\nThe RAF station closed at the end of March 1971 (see East of Suez) and Seletar was handed over to the Singapore Air Defence Command (SADC), which by 1973, after the British pullout, became the Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF).\n\nSeveral classic aircraft types flew their last RAF operational sorties from Seletar including the Short Singapore flying boat (Mk.III \"K6912\" of No. 205 Squadron RAF 14 October 1941, aircraft transferred to No. 5 Squadron RNZAF), Supermarine Spitfire (PR.XIX \"PS888\" of 81 Sqn 1954), De Havilland Mosquito (PR.34 \"RG314\" of 81 Sqn 1955), Short Sunderland flying boat (GR.5 \"ML797\" \"P\" of 205 Sqn, 15 May 1959) and Bristol Beaufighter (TT.X \"RD761\" Station Flight 1960). The Short Sunderland flying boats started in RAF service from \"Seletar\" on 22 June 1938 with 230 Sqn, a sister squadron of 205 Sqn.\n\nThe formative years of the SADC (later the RSAF) was established at Seletar Airbase in September 1968, with the setting up of the Flying Training School (FTS) utilising three Cessna 172G/H on loan from the Singapore Flying Club. The subsequent arrival of eight new Cessna 172Ks in May 1969, took over the duty from the former and contributed to the increase of training tempo for more selected trainees to participate in the basic flight-training course.\n\nSeletar Airport now operates as a general aviation airport, mainly for chartered flights, private aircraft operations and training purposes. The airport is open 24 hours a day. It has a single runway with 27 aircraft stands, 100 square metres of warehouse space and can handle 840 tons of freight per day. In 1998, the airport recorded receiving a total of 7,945 scheduled flights, handled 23,919 passengers and 6,025 tons of cargo.\n\nThe airport fire service, AES Seletar, is provided by Changi Airport Group. AES Seletar has 1 station housing 6 apparatus (water tender, foam tender and others) and provides Level 7 protection.\n\nThe Republic of Singapore Flying Club, Seletar Flying Club and Singapore Flying College are situated at Seletar Airport. The Singapore Flying College also conducts its flying training at Jandakot Airport in Perth, Western Australia and at Sunshine Coast Airport in Maroochydore, Queensland. Another prominent flying school is the Singapore Youth Flying Club, which has its headquarters built on western side of the airport's runway. Completed in June 2003, the clubhouse also has its own parking bays for its fleet of Diamond DA40. Also, the rotary training unit of Republic of Singapore Air Force – 124 Squadron, has a training detachment at the civilian airport although it is normally headquartered at Sembawang Air Base.\n\nPreviously, Berjaya Air operated scheduled flights to Tioman and Redang. The Berjaya Air service ended on 31 October 2010 and relocated to Changi Airport.\n\nChangi Airport Group took over the management of the airport from the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore on 1 July 2009. In 2011 the runway was extended to 1,840 metres to enable larger and heavier aircraft to use the airport.\n\nThe airport underwent refurbishment in 2015 as part of plans to relieve pressure on Changi Airport. The plan was to optimise its capacity and move smaller and slower aircraft from Changi to Seletar airport.\n\nA new passenger terminal building opened on 19 November 2018, replacing the previous passenger terminal. The terminal houses four check-in counters, six immigration lanes, two security screening stations and a gate holdroom that can accommodate 200 passengers.\n\nMalaysia banned its airline Firefly, one of two subsidiaries of state-owned Malaysia Airlines from using Seletar airport after the relocation of its ATR 72 turboprop aircraft from Changi Airport in Singapore, which was due to commence operation on 1 December 2018. Changi has phased out the use of turboprop aircraft and Singapore has designated Seletar as the airport for turboprop operation. The ban was imposed on Firefly after Singapore published the Seletar's Aeronautical Information Publication for the Instrument landing system on 1 December 2018 that covers Johor airspace over Pasir Gudang, an act which Malaysia claimed violated its sovereign territory. The ban impacted the flight operation plans of two other Malaysian-based airlines, Berjaya Air and Malindo Air which also planned to commence operations between Seletar and Malaysian destinations in 2019.\n\nAs early as January 2012, the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) had indicated that an ILS will be installed at Seletar Airport by 2014 as part of the upgrading work for the airport, which had commenced expansion and improvement works since 2008. In 2014, Singapore had formally informed the then Department of Civil Aviation Malaysia, currently known as the Civil Aviation Authority of Malaysia (CAAM), that all turboprop aircraft, private jets and chartered aircraft from Changi Airport will be relocated to Seletar Airport by end-2018.\n\nChangi Airport Group, (CAG) the airport operator for Changi and Seletar, said that it had been working with Firefly since 2014 to prepare for Firefly's shift to Seletar airport, as part of a plan to move all turboprop aircraft movements out of Changi airport and that Singapore has made all preparations and approved all applications by Firefly to commence scheduled turboprop operations at Seletar airport from 1 December 2018, without affecting operational efficiency or flight safety.\n\nIn July 2017, Ignatius Ong Ming Choy CEO of Firefly, a subsidiary of Malaysia Airlines (MAS) and a respected member in the aviation community, had raised the issue of an ILS which has not been in installed in Seletar, to the Singapore civil aviation authority, in which Firefly believed that the lack of an ILS impacted on Seletar airport's aim to be \"\"a proper commercial airport\"\" as the ILS will improve aviation safety and enhance operational efficiency of descending aircraft into the airport during poor weather, night landing or adverse visibility. Ignatius Ong had represented Malaysia Airlines in Kuala Lumpur and Beijing as a leading member of the responsive MAS crisis management team that dealt directly with traumatised relatives of those in the missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370.\n\nBy end-2017, a draft ILS procedure for descending aircraft into Seletar airport for Runway 03 and Runway 21 had been presented by CAAS to the Department of Civil Aviation Malaysia also known as the Civil Aviation Authority of Malaysia (CAAM) for consultations and feedback. Singapore needed CAAM's input for the ILS installation in Seletar as the ILS will covers Malaysian airspace over Pasir Gudang, which was delegated to Singapore in 1973 by Malaysia, with the approval of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO).\n\nOn 5 December 2017, in a meeting in Kuala Lumpur between the civil aviation authorities of Malaysia and Singapore, the draft ILS operational procedures for Seletar airport was further discussed, and the draft Instrument Approach charts and overview maps showing the full details of the incoming descending approach and missed approach procedures for Seletar Airport ILS were presented by CAAS to the Malaysian authorities.\n\nIn that meeting, CAAS informed CAAM that, to facilitate the move of turboprop operators like Firefly to Seletar by end-2018 and improve the safety and operational efficiency of aircraft operations, Singapore intended to install an ILS at Seletar between December 2017 and February 2018 with an Airport Instrument Approach (AIP) Supplement charts to be published by 31 May 2018 and made effective by 16 August 2018. Further as the Seletar ILS will cover part of the Malaysian airspace over Pasir Gudang that was delegated to Singapore, CAAS informed CAAM in that meeting that Singapore \"would send DCA Malaysia the draft charts and details as part of the formal consultative process to enable the publications of the (ILS) procedures.\"\n\n0n 6 December 2017, CAAS sent an email to CAAM, together with the all the draft charts and details, and further informed that should Malaysia requires more information about the ILS or wishes to highlights any concern about the system, the CAAS would be ready to address all technical issues.\n\nSince there was no response for six months from Malaysia until 6 June 2018 (which by then was already past the CAAS's intended publication date for the ILS-AIPs on 31 May 2018) Singapore sent another email to Malaysia requesting for an update on the ILS issue, as CAAS intended to publish the ILS-AIP data on the revised date of 7 June 2018.\n\nOn 7 August 2018, the two civil aviation authorities met in Kuala Lumpur where CAAS provided additional details on the Seletar ILS procedures, and Singapore requested from Malaysia for its urgent feedback on the ILS.\n\nOn 15 August 2018 15, CAAS sent to CAAM another email stressing the urgency of Malaysia's feedback on the ILS matter due to the impending move by Firefly to Seletar on 1 December 2018, and Singapore requested CAAM's prompt response by 27 August 2018, but there was no reply from CAAM to the Singapore requests.\n\nAt the sidelines of an International Civil Aviation Organization event soon after, Singapore continued to engage with Malaysia for an update on the ILS issue, without success.\n\nOn 14 November 2018, Firefly informed CAAS that it was \"unable to obtain approval from its regulator, CAAM, to operate into Seletar airport\".\n\nIn an announcement on 22 November 2018, Firefly announced on its website that it will suspend all of its 10 daily flights between Singapore and the three Malaysian towns of Subang, Kuantan and Ipoh from 1 December 2018, until \"the relevant authorities have cleared remaining matters in relation to the Singapore authority's plans to move turboprop operations from Changi International to Seletar (Airport)”. The Firefly announcement was described as \"rather unusual \" by Brendan Sobie, the Southeast Asia chief representative for the Centre for Aviation (CAPA).\n\nThe suspension resulted in more than 12,000 Firefly customers adversely affected and many were transferred to Malaysian Airlines (MAS), Firefly's parent company, thus incurring considerable losses to both airlines and causing negative impacts on the aviation sectors on both Malaysia and Singapore. Firefly could not obtained its landing slots to Changi airport since those slots were already sold to other non-turboprop operators.\n\nFirefly's intended move was thus vetoed by Malaysia which had said that the move will be detrimental to the development of Malaysian interests in Pasir Gudang, Johor and that the flight path had intruded into Malaysian airspace and therefore violated Malaysian sovereignty and development of its international port.\n\nOn 23 November 2018, Malaysia declared in a media statement that Singapore had never discussed an ILS for Seletar Airport with CAAM and Malaysia \"was never consulted (by Singapore) on the timeline to move scheduled turboprop operations to Seletar Airport starting Dec 1, 2018\".\n\nCAAM's Airport Standard Division director \"Dr Zainul Fuad Md Wahi\" in a press conference stated that CAAM did not receive any communication from Singapore about the ILS and that the \"requirement (to fly over Pasir Gudang) was never communicated to CAAM, and CAAM had never made any indication that CAAM agreed with it, especially when taking into consideration that it would affect the development over Pasir Gudang and its international port\".\n\nZainul Fuad Md Wahi added that the Seletar ILS issue surfaced only when Firefly was asked to move its flights from Changi Airport to Seletar by 1 December 2018.\n\nOn Thursday 29 November 2018, both civil aviation bodies met in Singapore where CAAM raised its technical concerns with the Seletar ILS procedures, which were promptly addressed by CAAS during that meeting.\n\nSingapore again conveyed to Malaysia of its intentions to publish the long-delayed ILS and AIP procedures on 1 December 2018, seven months later than the originally planned for 31 May 2018.\n\nOn Friday 30 November 2018 and with Firefly's scheduled move to Seletar to be conducted less than one day away on 1 December 2018, CAAS team flew to Kuala Lumpur to meet CAAM to discuss the records of the 29 Nov meeting, including whether there was any new issue on the ILS or other matters, as well as to facilitate Firefly operations (which had been suspended) between Malaysia and Singapore from 1 December 2018 onwards.\n\nDuring that meeting, Malaysia did not raised any new concern to Singapore regarding the ILS, airspace sovereignty or other new issues, and the records of discussion during the two meetings on the 29 and 30 November 2018 by the two sides were minuted, including Singapore's intention to publish the ILS-AIP data on the next day, 1 December 2018, to facilitate Firefly relocation to Seletar airport from Changi airport.\n\nOn 1 December 2018, CAAS officially published the AIP Supplement AIP SUP 079/2018-1 AIP Singapore for the implementation of ILS and Approach Procedure for Seletar Runway 21 which shall be effective as at 3 January 2019 and informed all stakeholders, including CAAM, Firefly and the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) in Montreal, Canada, thus clearing the way from the Singapore side for Firefly to commence commercial flight operations between Subang-Seletar, Ipoh-Seletar and Kuantan-Seletar operations. in the event Firefly managed to obtain the approval from CAAM to do so.\n\nFirefly, being the sole turboprop operator to Changi Airport and already with the much-coveted landing slots and firm schedules to Seletar Airport would have been the biggest commercial flight operator into Seletar airport as others like Berjaya Air, Malindo Air, Wings Air, City Link have not been as prepared as Firefly, with Berjaya Air expected to fly to Seletar later in February 2019 together with Malindo Air\n\nAddressing the Malaysian Parliament on Monday, 3 December 2018, the transport minister Anthony Loke Siew Fook said that Singapore's ILS proposal had violated Malaysian sovereignty by publishing the ILS-AIP procedures for Seletar Airport on 1 December 2018 without CAAM's approval, and the Malaysia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs will send a statement of protest to Singapore over the territorial violation caused by Singapore's publication of the ILS procedures.\n\nLoke added that Malaysia was informed by Singapore only around October 2018 of Singapore's intent to commence ILS operations for Seletar airport. and that during the meetings on 28 and 29 Nov between the two national aviation bodies of Malaysia and Singapore, CAAM had conveyed to Singapore not to allow CAAS to broadcast its ILS, which Singapore ignored and proceeded to broadcast the ILS from 3 January 2018.\n\nIn the parliamentary speech, Loke said that Malaysia had informed Singapore that it would be taking back its delegated airspace between 2019 and 2023, which was delegated to Singapore in 1974 under the \"Operational Letter of Agreement between Kuala Lumpur and Singapore Area Control Centers Concerning Singapore Arrivals, Departures And Overflight\" (LOA 1974).\n\nWithin hours of Loke's statements, Singapore released a minutes of meeting dated 5 December 2017 and email correspondences dated 6 December 2017 and 17 June 2018 between CAAS and CAAM to counter Loke's claims that Malaysia was informed about the ILS only around October 2018 as well as to counter CAAM's Zainul Fuad Md Wahi's statement that CAAM was never informed by CAAS about an ILS for Seletar airport.\n\nReacting to Singapore's releases of the correspondences, Loke said on 10 December 2018 that Singapore was being partial and selective in the choice of correspondences it published and he challenged Singapore to release four other letters dated 9 October 2018, 15, 21 and 28 November 2018 which Singapore failed to do so.\n\nMalaysia further feedback to Singapore that \"failing to do so, we (Malaysia) are prepared to release the letters for full disclosure of such information for the public's comprehension of our stand on the same.\"\n\nOn the same day (10 December 2018) Singapore informed Malaysia that Singapore had no objections for Malaysia to proceed and release all the letters, email correspondences and records of discussions on the ILS between CAAM and CAAS, but not limited to just the four letters as mentioned earlier by Malaysia, but to include all correspondences and minutes of discussions for total transparency regarding the CAAM-CAAS negotiations on the Seletar airport's ILS unit.\n\nAfter Singapore announced that it had no objections to Malaysia's threatened release of the CAAM-CAAS letters, Malaysia announced on 12 December 2018 that it declined to release any correspondence on the Seletar ILS citing the need for confidentiality. Malaysian Transport Ministry said that it is a \"matter of principle not to release correspondence between parties to address media queries and get public support and it agreed with its Singaporean counterpart that it would be useful for negotiations to be kept confidential to facilitate frank and constructive exchanges.\"\n\nThat video showed that since the south-bound flight path to Seletar airport overflew Pasir Gudang, the ILS operations violated Malaysia territorial rights.\n\nThe airspace over Johor delegated to Singapore in 1974 under the Operational Letter of Agreement between Kuala Lumpur and Singapore Area Control Centers Concerning Singapore Arrivals, Departures And Overflight (LOA 1974) and CAAS was of the view that airspace sovereignty and ILS operational procedures are separate issues, since Singapore had never denied that the airspace over Pasir Gudang is Malaysian territory.\n\nIt was pointed out that Malaysian air traffic controls had similarly overlapped the national territories of Brunei, Indonesia and Thailand, where Brunei's upper airspace is managed by Malaysia under the Kota Kinabalu Flight Information Region, which also covers the Indonesian waters around Kuching Airport, which is outside Malaysian territory\n\nChangi Airport similarly has ILSs that extended into Johor in southern Malaysia and over Batam Island in the Riau region of Indonesia while the Singapore Flight Information Region extended northwards to the Malaysia-Thailand border and into the territorial waters of Vietnam and eastwards towards the Philippines Sea.\n\nKota Kinabalu FIR covers Brunei northern airspace as well as the airspace over Indonesia territorial waters near Kuching Airport. Indonesia managed the airspace over Australia's Christmas Island and Timor Leste. while in Europe for example, Denmark managed airspaces over Sweden and Scotland.\n\nIn his Facebook video post dated 11 December 2018, Loke claimed that the ILS in Seletar will impact Pasir Gudang sea port developments and will place compulsory height restrictions on the port and developments in Pasir Gudang and further north all the way northwards to the towns of Air Tawar and the outskirts of Kota Tinggi, about 25 km north of Seletar. Loke added that Singapore should installed the ILS facing south of Seletar for Runway 03 instead of facing north towards Malaysia, for Runway 21 at Seletar airport.\n\nOn 13 December 2018 Singapore denied that the Seletar ILS placed compulsory height restrictions in Pasir Gudang and that Malaysia sovereignty over Pasir Gudang airspace was never questioned by Singapore, being the party delegated by Malaysia to manage that airspace since 1973 and agreed by both countries and approved by the ICAO. Singapore also stated that based on historical meteorological patterns, the Seletar and Pasir Gudang regions faced opposing wind directions for each half of a year, thus singular directional approach and take-off procedures via Seletar's Runway 03 only will render flight operations unsafe.\n\nNumerous experts have since pointed out that with the ILS in place, it will help the pilots to land properly and safely and will not impose any compulsory height restrictions.\n\nIn that video Loke Siew Fook had stated that at 3,000m from Seletar airport, there is a height restriction of 54m compulsorily enforced by the ILS on building heights in Pasir Gudang, while at 6,000m the height restriction is 145m, where \"\"this means, even a mobile crane would have breached the height limit and there are many tall buildings in Johor\".\n\nOn 12 December 2018, Singapore countered by stating that at 3,000m from Seletar airport, the bare height limit, without a safety buffer zone, is 93.8m while at 6,000m, it is 193.1m, while at a 25 km mark from Seletar, at Air Tawar or Kota Tinggi, the height limit exceeds 1,000m high. Since the ILS has a safety buffer zone, the height at 3,000m from Seletar airport is 2005m, while at 6,000m it will be 401m, and at Air Tawar and Kota Tinggi, the height will be 1,066.8m or about 200m higher than the height of Burj Khalifa in Dubai at 829.8m or more than twice higher than the Petronas Twin Towers at 452m.\n\nSingapore explained that a descending plane approaching Seletar Runway 21 at a 3.5-degree glide slope will be at a height of 183.5m at 3,000m from Seletar and 366m high at the 6,000m mark while at 25 km away in the Air Tawar and Kota Tinggi region, incoming aircraft into Seletar airport will be at a minimum height of 1,066.8m or 3,500 feet.\n\nWith a safety buffer zone under the ILS glide path, the height of a descending aircraft at the 3,000m mark from Seletar is increased to 200.1m which is the same height before the ILS comes into operation on 3 January 2019, and that the glide path and height limits are in accordance with safety and operational standards required by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) which both Malaysia and Singapore had ratified.\n\nSingapore said that all existing tall buildings directly below the current Seletar glide path have been taken into account in the design of the ILS procedures and that the Singapore authorities have not been informed of any new developments being planned in Pasir Gudang that could significantly affect the flight profile for Seletar flights. Malaysia have not obligation to inform any future developments in Pasir Gudang to Singapore as these do not affect any Singapore sovereignty.\n\nThe current Seletar airport glide path over Pasir Gudang passes over the Johor Port Pasir Gudang Container Terminal where eight gantry cranes, each exceeding 90m high or equivalent to a 30-storey building, are in operation and it also passes over the TNB Sultan Iskandar Power Station with a smoke chimney exceeding 125m. Both the cranes and the chimney (completed in 1980) are located on the Pasir Gudang shorelines of the Johor Straits and located directly north of Seletar Airport under the glide path and these tall structures are clearly indicated in the Seletar Aeronautical Information Publication (AIP) and Instrument landing system (ILS) charts published by CAAS on 1 December 2018 as well as in the Visual approach charts for Seletar airport.\n\nUnder ICAO regulations, countries with adjacent air boundaries are required to provide early notification of proposed future developments to all relevant parties so that flight procedures can be adjusted if necessary and Singapore will make operational adjustments for any future development plans involving tall buildings in Pasir Gudang and all affected areas under the ILS glide path into Seletar.\n\nSingapore assured Malaysia that for more than three decades, the republic has safely managed flight operations and ships transiting the Johor Strait to and from ports and marine facilities in Pasir Gudang region and in this regard, Singapore had installed the \"Vessel Height Measuring System\" (VHMS) to safeguard both aviation and maritime activities which, and on occasions, had flights been delayed while tall vessels crossed the Strait of Johor safely.\n\nThe VHMS protocol had been in operation since 1986 and was also presented by the CAAS to the ICAO on 17 August 2011. Singapore further stated that the Seletar ILS procedure is meant to enhance the safety of the existing flight operations over Pasir Gudang and it does not create a new flight path that differs or deviates from the current air corridor that had been in operations since 1974.\n\nBesides Firefly, two other airlines, Berjaya Air and Malindo Air, are not expected to start their Malaysia-Seletar routes until both airlines had received permission from the Civil Aviation Authority of Malaysia to use Seletar airport.\n\nOn 14 December 2018, Malaysia said that enough had been said publicly and that technical and aviation experts from both sides should be given space to solve any technical issues, hence Malaysia requested for bilateral meeting promptly with Singapore.\n\nOn 25 December 2018, Malaysia declared that the air space over Pasir Gudang is a restricted area for the purpose of military activities which shall go into effect on 2 January 2019. CAAM had published a Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) on 25 December 2018 that informed the aviation community of its establishment of a permanent restricted area.\n\nSingapore Ministry of Transport said the restricted area, being within a controlled and congested airspace, will impact the existing and normal operations of aircraft transiting through the airspace.\n\nTwo bus services (services 103 and 117) are available from the old airport terminal. Since 14 October 2018, Service 102 also serves the new airport terminal of Seletar Airport, with a new bus stop within the Passenger Terminal Building. Service 102 allows access to the North East MRT line via Sengkang, Buangkok and Hougang stations.\nPassengers heading to Changi Airport can alight at Jalan Kayu roundabout and transfer to 858. Connections to Tampines, Pasir Ris & Serangoon via services 168, 39 and 103 are also possible here. Passengers heading to Yishun (North South MRT line) may transfer to service 103 at Aft Baker St bus stop.\n\nTaxis are available at the taxi stands at the arrival hall. There is an additional airport surcharge for all trips originating from the airport.\n\n\n\n"}

The base motto is \"Dare and Will\".\n\nBefore Singapore's independence from the United Kingdom, it was a Royal Air Force station known as RAF Sembawang as well as being the Royal Naval Air Station – HMS Simbang – to the carrier pilots of the Royal Navy Fleet Air Arm (attached to the Eastern Fleet based in Singapore) who used it for rest and refit whenever an aircraft carrier of the Royal Navy berthed at the nearby HMNB Singapore for refuel and repairs, which also housed the largest Royal Navy dockyard east of Suez up to the time of UK forces withdrawal from Singapore.\n\nAfter the Japanese capture of Singapore during World War II, the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service took over the two RAF stations of Sembawang and Seletar. Singapore was split into north-south spheres of control, and the Imperial Japanese Army Air Force took over RAF Tengah. It was not until September 1945 that the two airfields reverted to British control following the Japanese surrender.\n\nRAF Sembawang was a key part of Britain's continued military presence in the Far East (along with the three other RAF bases in Singapore: RAF Changi, RAF Seletar, RAF Tengah) during the critical period of the Malayan Emergency (1948–1960), the Brunei Revolt in 1962 and the Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation (1962–1966).\n\n1941–42\n\n1945–1971<br>\n\"Royal Air Force\"\n\n\"Royal Navy\"\n\nThe base was renamed Sembawang Air Base (SBAB) in 1971 when it was handed over to the Singapore Air Defence Command (SADC). From 1971 to 1976, under the auspices of the Five Power Defence Arrangements (FPDA), Sembawang housed British, Australian and New Zealand forces.\n\nIn 1983, the airbase became a full-fledged rotary-wing air base when the first resident helicopter squadron – 120 Squadron – was permanently relocated from Changi Air Base.\n\nCurrently, there are approximately 100 helicopters based in Sembawang Air Base, almost all are operating in support of the Singapore Army and the Republic of Singapore Navy. It is the home base to all the RSAF helicopter squadrons, consisting of Eurocopter AS332 Super Pumas, Boeing CH-47SD Chinooks, Sikorsky S-70B (derivative of Sikorsky SH-60 Seahawk) naval helicopters, as well as the Eurocopter Fennecs and Bell UH-1Hs, which are currently stored in reserve.

But the senator had died early in 1904 therefore ending all opposition in the Republican Party.\n\nThere were also very informal talks with future president William Howard Taft about trying for the nomination, but Taft refused these motions as evidenced by a letter to Henry Hoyt, the Solicitor General, in 1903.\n\nRoosevelt was nominated by 994 votes to none. The other threat to Roosevelt, Indiana Senator Charles W. Fairbanks was nominated for vice president.\n\nThe 1904 Republican platform favored the protective tariff, increased foreign trade, the gold standard, expansion of the Merchant Marine and strengthening of the United States Navy; it also praised Roosevelt's foreign and domestic policies.\n\nVice President Roosevelt had ascended to the presidency in 1901 after the death of President William McKinley. As the 25th Amendment had not yet been passed, there was no way to fill the vice presidential vacancy. So the 1904 convention had the task of choosing a running mate for Roosevelt. Entering the convention, Senator Charles Fairbanks of Indiana was considered the likely favorite for the vice presidential nomination, but the Roosevelt administration favored Illinois Representative Robert R. Hitt or Secretary of War William Howard Taft of Ohio. Speaker Joseph Gurney Cannon of Illinois also had support among the delegates, but Cannon had no desire to leave his position in the House. However, the administration did not launch a fight over the nomination of Fairbanks, and Fairbanks was nominated by acclamation.\n\nThere were significantly fewer speakers at the 1904 convention then there are at a typical convention today. This is because the convention at the time was much lower in viewership (as there were not the mass media devices of TV or radio at this time only those actually invited saw it). Also, this was before the primary era so the delegates were expected to nominate the candidate at the actual convention as well as more typical tasks such as electing the chairman and handling other business which varies in importance at the Republican Convention today. Nonetheless, there were speeches by the following individuals at the 1904 Republican National Convention:\n\n\n\n\nRoosevelt and his running mate Charles Fairbanks, were unanimously nominated but unlike candidates today they did not give convention speeches instead having individuals give nominating speeches for them. Roosevelt's nomination speech was made by former New York Governor Frank S. Black and it was seconded by Indiana Senator Albert Beveridge. Fairbanks's nomination speech was made by Iowa Senator Jonathan P. Dolliver and seconded by New York Senator Chauncey Depew.\n\n\n"}

Sanders\n\nEd Parish Sanders (born 18 April 1937) is an American New Testament scholar and a principal proponent of the \"New Perspective on Paul\". He is a major scholar in the scholarship on the historical Jesus and contributed to the view that Jesus was part of a renewal movement within Judaism. He has been Arts and Sciences Professor of Religion at Duke University, North Carolina, since 1990. He retired in 2005.\n\nSanders is a Fellow of the British Academy. In 1966 he received a Doctor of Theology degree from Union Theological Seminary in New York City. In 1990 he received a Doctor of Letters degree from the University of Oxford and a Doctor of Theology degree from the University of Helsinki. He has authored, co-authored or edited 13 books and numerous articles. He has received a number of prizes, including the 1990 University of Louisville and Louisville Presbyterian Theological Seminary Grawemeyer Award for the best book on religion published in the 1980s for \"Jesus and Judaism\".\n\nSanders was born on April 18, 1937, in Grand Prairie, Texas. He attended Texas Wesleyan College (1955–1959) and Perkins School of Theology at Southern Methodist University (1959–1962). He spent a year (1962–1963) studying at Göttingen, the University of Oxford, and in Jerusalem.\n\nBetween September 1963 and May 1966 Sanders studied at Union Theological Seminary, New York City, for his Doctor of Theology degree. His thesis was entitled \"The Tendencies of the Synoptic Tradition\" (published in 1969), which used form criticism to examine whether the Gospel tradition changed in consistent ways. The thesis was supervised by W. D. Davies.\n\nHe taught at McMaster University (Hamilton, Ontario) from 1966 to 1984. In 1968 he won a fellowship from the Canada Council and spent a year in Israel, studying Rabbinic Judaism.\n\nIn 1984, he became Dean Ireland's Professor of the Exegesis of Holy Scripture at the University of Oxford and a Fellow of Queen's College, positions he kept until his move to Duke University in 1990. He has also held visiting professorships and lectureships at Trinity College, Dublin, and the University of Cambridge. Sanders identifies himself as a \"liberal, modern, secularized Protestant\" in his book \"Jesus and Judaism\"; fellow scholar John P. Meier calls him a postliberal Protestant. In any case, he is cognizant of Albert Schweitzer's indictment of liberal theology's attempt to make Jesus in its own image, and seeks to keep his religious convictions out of his scholarship.\n\nSanders is known for his New Testament scholarship. His field of special interest is Judaism and Christianity in the Greco-Roman world. He is one of the leading scholars in contemporary historical Jesus research, the so-called \"third quest,\" which places Jesus firmly in the context of Judaism. In contemporary scholarship, Jesus is seen as the founder of a \"renewal movement within Judaism,\" to use Sanders' phrase. He promotes the predominant view that Jesus was an apocalyptic prophet.\n\nSanders' first major book was \"Paul and Palestinian Judaism\", which was published in 1977. He had written the book by 1975, but had difficulty in having it published.\n\nSanders argued that the traditional Christian interpretation that Paul was condemning Rabbinic legalism was a misunderstanding of both Judaism and Paul's thought, especially since it assumed a level of individualism in these doctrines that was not present, and disregarded notions of group benefit or collective privilege. Rather, Sanders argued, the key difference between pre-Christian Judaism and Pauline teaching was to be found in ideas of how a person becomes one of the People of God. Sanders termed the Jewish belief \"covenantal nomism\": one was a member of the people by virtue of God's covenant with Abraham, and one stayed in it by keeping the Law.\n\nSanders claimed that Paul's belief was one of \"participationist eschatology\": the only way to become one of the People of God was through faith in Christ (\"dying with Christ\") and the Old Covenant was no longer sufficient. But, once inside, appropriate behavior was required of the Christian, behavior based on the Jewish Scriptures, but not embracing all aspects of it. Both patterns required the grace of God for election (admission), and the behavior of the individual, supported by God's grace. The dividing line, therefore, was Paul's insistence on faith in Christ as the only way to election. However, Sanders stressed that Paul also \"loved good deeds\" and that when his words are taken in context, it emerges that Paul advocates good works in addition to faith in Christ.\n\nSanders' next major book was \"Jesus and Judaism\", published in 1985. In this work he argued that Jesus began as a follower of John the Baptist and was a prophet of the restoration of Israel. Sanders saw Jesus as creating an eschatological Jewish movement through his appointment of the Apostles and through his preaching and actions. After his execution (the trigger for which was Jesus overthrowing the tables in the temple court of Herod's Temple, thereby antagonizing the political authorities) his followers continued the movement, expecting his return to restore Israel. One consequence of this return would involve Gentiles worshiping the god of Israel. Sanders could find no substantial points of opposition between Jesus and the Pharisees, and he viewed Jesus as abiding by Jewish law and the disciples as continuing to keep it (cf. e.g., Acts 3:1; 21:23–26, for their worship in the Temple). Sanders also argues that Jesus' sayings did not entirely determine Early Christian behavior and attitudes, as is shown by Paul's discussion of divorce (1 Cor. 7:10–16) where the latter quotes Jesus' sayings and then gives his own independent ruling. In one interview, Sanders stated that Paul felt that \"\"he\" was the model to his churches.\"\n\n\"Judaism: Practice and Belief\" was published in 1992 and tested Sanders' thesis in the light of concrete Jewish practices. Sanders argued that there was a \"Common Judaism\", that is, beliefs and practices common to all Jews, regardless of which religious party they belonged to. After the reign of Salome Alexandra, the Pharisees were a small but very respected party which had a varying amount of influence within Judaism. The main source of power, however, was with the rulers and especially the aristocratic priesthood (Sadducees). Sanders argues that the evidence indicates that the Pharisees did not dictate policy to any of these groups or individuals.\n\nIn general, Sanders stressed the importance of historical context for a proper understanding of first century religion. He attempted to approach Judaism on its own terms, not in the context of the Protestant–Catholic debates of the sixteenth century in order to redefine views on Judaism, Paul, and Christianity as a whole. As Sanders said, he reads Paul in his context, which is \"Palestine in the first century and especially first century Judaism.\" In this spirit, one of Sanders' articles is titled \"Jesus in Historical Context\". In a 2000 encyclopedia entry on Jesus whom Sanders calls an 'eschatological prophet', the subject avoids the word 'angel' although mention is made of the two men 'in dazzling clothes' at the empty tomb.\n\nSanders has argued that more comparative studies are needed, with wider examinations conducted between New Testament texts and the other available historical sources of the period. Speaking at a conference organized in his honor, he described the attractiveness of these types of comparative studies: \"They are not all that easy, but they are an awful lot of fun.\"\n\n\n\n"}

Built on a 2 square kilometre site of reclaimed land, the new base was located approximately 2 kilometres east of Singapore Changi Airport and approximately 1.5 kilometres west of Changi Naval Base. Groundbreaking took place on 15 July 2002 and it was officially opened on 29 November 2004. The runway (02R/20L) length was approximately 2,748 metres (9,015 ft), it has since been lengthened to 4,000 metres.\n\nThe new base houses the Republic of Singapore Air Force's 145 Squadron, which comprises the extended-range, attack-oriented F-16D Block 52+ Fighting Falcons, as well as the 208 Squadron, the 808 Squadron and the 508 Squadron.\n\nThe proximity of the South China Sea to the air base gives it an advantage over Tengah Air Base and Paya Lebar Air Base as the F-16 jets from Changi can make a faster and shorter trip out to training areas over the South China Sea, compared to their counterparts from other air bases. The 145 Squadron can save as much as five to seven minutes of transit time, which means they also save on fuel and further reducing costs.\n\nIn the future, the runway will be extended to 4,000 metres to accommodate further growth in passenger, cargo and air traffic as construction of Terminal 5 gets underway.\n\nAs part of Changi Airport's expansion and to accommodate the eventual relocation of Paya Lebar Airbase, the air base was closed for expansion works and re-opened at the end of 2018.\n\n\nAlso, located just beyond the northern edge perimeter fencing of the air base is the permanent venue of the new Changi Exhibition Centre for the Singapore Airshow which was completed in September 2007 and had hosted the recently inaugurated Singapore Airshow 2008 in February 2008. The most recent Airshow was held from 11–16 February 2020.\n\nOn 1 November 2011, Singapore hosted the Five Power Defence Arrangements (FPDA)'s 40th-anniversary celebrations, with the defence ministers, aircraft and servicemen from all five signatory countries converging on the air base to participate in the event. Amongst the participating aircraft spotted roosting at the dispersal area of the air base were Republic of Singapore Air Force's F-15SG Strike Eagle, Royal Air Force's Typhoon FGR4, Royal Australian Air Force's F/A-18A Hornets, Royal Malaysian Air Force's F/A-18D Hornets and Royal New Zealand Air Force's P-3K2 Orions. Later, a gala dinner was hosted by Singapore's defence minister - Dr Ng Eng Hen at Singapore's Istana whereupon they called on the Prime Minister of Singapore - Mr Lee Hsien Loong to discuss a multitude of issues. Codenamed \"Exercise Bersama Lima\", the three days joint exercise is expected to test the readiness and cooperation between all participating countries and should conclude on 4 November 2011.\n\n\n"}

It spawned musical acts O-Town, Da Band, Danity Kane, Day26, and Donnie Klang. Except for the first iteration of the series featuring O-Town, all seasons of \"Making the Band\" have been overseen by Diddy, acting as the man of the house who makes the final decision on who will be in the band.\n\nOn July 15, 2019, it was announced by MTV that the series was revived and will premiere in 2020. But due to he global covid-19 pandemic\nit has been postponed to 2021 and TBD\nThe first iteration of \"Making the Band\" started on March 24, 2000, and aired for three seasons, finishing on March 30, 2002. It centered around the musical group O-Town.\n\nThe first season aired on ABC. \"Making the Band\" was the last new series, and the only series that was not a sitcom, to air during the original run of the TGIF block. The block ended its run upon the end of the series' first season in 2000. \"Making the Band\" was then relocated to cable television network MTV, where two additional seasons aired. Future iterations of the show also aired on MTV. O-Town's return for additional seasons marked the first time the main cast of a reality show returned for a second season.\n\nIn 1999, Lou Pearlman, the man responsible for the formation of the Backstreet Boys and NSYNC, embarked on a nationwide talent search, cutting auditions in eight cities down to 25 young men, and eventually to eight finalists. These eight young men would compete for five spots in Pearlman's newest boy band creation, to be signed to his record label, Transcontinental Records.\n\nThe season chronicled the competition between the men in typical reality-show fashion. It featured on screen choreography by Ramon Del Barrio. Midway through the first season, three of the eight men (Paul Martin, Mike Miller and Bryan Chan) were eliminated, leaving Ashley Parker Angel, Jacob Underwood, Erik-Michael Estrada (not to be confused with American actor Erik Estrada), Trevor Penick, and Ikaika Kahoano. These five were set to become O-Town and the process of producing their first CD began. Several episodes later, however, Kahoano left for reasons that weren't exactly clear. Kahoano later stated that he \"did not respect the other members on a musical or personal level\" and described the experience as \"wack\". He later joined \"Making the Band\" semi-finalist Mike Miller and Bryan Chan to form the boy-band LMNT. Selecting from the original group of 25 semi-finalists, the remaining four members of the band chose Dan Miller to be Kahoano's replacement. With the final member of O-Town in place, the remainder of the first season tracked the development and struggles with the new band.\n\nThe second and third seasons continued to track the development of O-Town as a pop group, following tours, performances, and other seminal events in the band's history. Such events included the development of their second CD, \"O2\", their transition to a new record label, Clive Davis' J Records, and an ongoing struggle to \"prove themselves\" as legitimate artists.\n\nThe second iteration of \"Making the Band\" started on October 19, 2002, and aired for three seasons, finishing on April 29, 2004. It centered around the musical group Da Band and was filmed in various spaces around Manhattan all designed by noted visual artist and designer Ron Norsworthy.\n\nIn 2002, a new talent search had begun, this time by P. Diddy. Diddy sought to find the best rappers and singers from which to assemble a new hip-hop group. After weeks of selection and training P. Diddy chose the members of the band (Sara Stokes, Dylan Dilinjah, Frederick (Freddy P) Watson, Rodney (Chopper) Hill, Lloyd (Ness) Mathis and Lynese (Babs) Wiley) on the first season of \"Making The Band 2\". Orlando (OG) Goodman, Walter (Hammin) Anderson, Kimberley (Mysterious) Bert, Belinda (Pocahantas) Carter, Damone Coleman, Jamie Huy, Yazmin Mendez, Jonessa Monique, Mina Monroe, Allah Ricks and Jamirah Turner did not make the cut.\n\nFor several weeks, the contestants were subject to difficult tasks, including walking from Midtown Manhattan to Brooklyn to purchase cheesecake for Diddy and reciting the Notorious B.I.G.'s Juicy & the Sugarhill Gang's Rapper's Delight out loud in the Bad Boy Records office. Many altercations between members also took place throughout the season. The finalists were then named Da Band.\n\nTheir debut album, \"Too Hot for TV\", was released in September 2003. Their first single was \"Bad Boy This, Bad Boy That,\" and their second was \"Tonight.\" The album was certified gold selling 600,000 copies.\n\nDa Band effectively ended its career at the end of the third season of the show, when P. Diddy dissolved the group during the season finale. However, he still wanted to work with Babs and Ness, calling them hip hop's next \"Bonnie and Clyde,\" though nothing yet has been released from either of them. Diddy also kept Chopper, now known as Young City, with the label, who was signed with Bad Boy South. Sara Stokes, Frederick and Dylan John were the remaining three members of Da Band to be dropped completely from Bad Boy.\n\nThe third iteration of \"Making the Band\" started on March 3, 2005, and aired for three seasons, finishing on August 10, 2006. It centered on the musical group Danity Kane. Home base interiors were again designed by Ron Norsworthy.\n\nAfter the failure of Bad Boy's Da Band, P. Diddy returned with \"Making the Band 3\" in 2004. This time, he was on the look for the next girl group. With the help of Laurieann Gibson, Doc and Johnny, he set out on a multi city search to find girls who had everything: a great voice, dancing ability and most importantly the looks. The theme song \"Oh La La\" was recorded by Badboy Recording Artist Cheri Dennis.\n\n Roxanne was cut by Laurie Ann.\n\nThe band performed at the Backstreet Boys concert at the Nissan Pavilion on August 6, 2005. There were two groups. Group one, named \"SHE (She Has Everything)\", included Aubrey, Melissa, Denosh, Jasmine, and Kelli. Group two, named \"Chain 6\", included Aundrea, Dawn, Shannon, Wanita, Dominique, and Taquita. During dress rehearsal, group one was the favorite according to Dave, Laurie Anne and Doc. However, the first group was booed as they gave their performance because Denosh started off key on the a cappella which led Aubrey to go off key in the beginning of the song. The second group won, as many screaming girls yelled for them.\n\nThe song that each contestant sang in the studio \"Tell Me\" was actually used by Diddy on his album \"Press Play\". Instead of one of the members of the group who originally sang the song on the show appearing on the track, the vocals are done by Christina Aguilera.\n\nThe finale took place on Tuesday, November 15, 2005, where the 11 contestants left competed for five spots in the band. The 11 finalists; Aundrea, Aubrey, Dawn, Jasmine, TaQuita Thorns, Denosh, Wanita, Shannon, Melissa, Kelli, and Dominique, were sent home for three months, told to polish up, and return for the final stretch. When the girls returned after their three-month hiatus, they had to perform numerous acts such as radio interviews, a photo shoot, and dance all of their old dance routines. As Diddy's crew chooses the group, all of the girls went on a last dinner.\n\nThey decided on the name Danity Kane. The band's self-titled debut album was released in stores on August 22, 2006 and peaked at #1 on the Billboard charts within its first three weeks of release.\n\nThe fourth iteration of \"Making the Band\" started on June 18, 2007, and aired for three seasons, finishing on April 23, 2009. It focused on the musical acts Day26 and Donnie Klang. Season 1 was filmed in a midtown Manhattan with interiors designed by noted visual artist and designer Ron Norsworthy.\n\nDiddy begins his search for an all-male super group. This all-male band is widely believed to be the new version of 112 or New Edition as reported earlier in the season. The season began on June 18, 2007 at 9:00 p.m. The band was finally made on August 26, 2007, consisting of five males from their late teens to their early-to-mid-20s.\n\nSeason 2 showed the \"Making The Band 4\" winners and Donnie's debut albums along with Danity Kane's second album coming together. There was a \"Making The Band\" tour with Danity Kane, the \"Making The Band 4\" winners, and Donnie. They all moved into the same house and record their new albums and got to know each other a lot more. This was the debut of Danity Kane's second album and \"Making The Band 4\" winners.\n\nThe \"Making The Band 4\" boys have a song out called \"Got Me Going\" (lead single off their debut album). Danity Kane has a confirmed lead single called \"Damaged\". Fans voted between it and another song, \"Pretty Boy\". Donnie Klang also has out a song called \"Take You There\". Both \"Damaged\" and \"Got Me Going\" were released to all digital music stores on January 29, 2008.\n\nThe group's official name was revealed as Day26 On the February 4, 2008 episode of TRL the boys explained that Day 26 is the band name because August 26, 2007 was the day that they became a band.\n\nThe third season premiered on August 19, 2008, and the series finale aired on April 23, 2009. Season 3 would feature the shows stars on a U.S. Tour, the Making the Band Tour. On August 12, 2008 there was a 1-hour special that aired on MTV called \"Making The Band's Greatest Hits.\" The special was hosted by Aubrey from Danity Kane, Donnie Klang and Robert from Day26, looking back on past events throughout the seasons of Making the Band 3 and 4.\n\nInstead of \"making a band\" the show's focus turned into a The Real World-type show, focusing on friendships, relationships, and drama in and out of the studio and the industry.\n\nDiddy announced that he was searching for musicians for a \"Making the Band\" spin-off titled \"Making His Band\", where he would be searching for guitarists, drummers, backup singers, etc. to form his own personal live band. This new season premiered on July 27, 2009.\n\nOn September 2, 2009, this series was placed on hiatus. On September 12, 2009, the show returned and aired the last five episodes on a new Saturday time slot. Reasoning for this included a delay in Diddy's album release date as well as generally low ratings overall for the program.\n\nIn 2010, \"Making His Band\" was nominated for a GLAAD Media Award for \"Outstanding Reality Program\" during the 21st GLAAD Media Awards.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1963238", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1963238", "title": "Joseph Kimhi", "text": "Joseph Kimhi\n\nJoseph Qimḥi or Kimchi (1105–1170) () was a medieval Jewish rabbi and biblical commentator. He was the father of Moses and David Kimhi, and the teacher of Rabbi Menachem Ben Simeon and poet Joseph Zabara.\n\nGrammarian, exegete, poet, and translator; born in southern Spain about 1105; died about 1170. Forced to leave his native country owing to the religious persecutions of the Almohades, who invaded the Iberian Peninsula in 1146, he settled in Narbonne, Provence, where he spent the rest of his life. The Hachmei Provence were under the considerable influence of the neighboring Spanish Jewish community to the south at the time.\n\nQimḥi is known to have written commentaries on all the books of the Bible, though only fragments of his work have survived until today. The foundation of his work is a literal reading of the Masoretic Text (\"𝕸\") and its grammatical analysis, interspersed with contemporary philosophical musings. This reflects his opposition to a christological reading of the text, which highlights allegory. In fact, Kimhi participated in several public debates with Catholic clergy, in which he highlighted his own method of reading biblical texts. His opposition to the contemporary Christian reading can be found in his \"Book of the Covenant\" ().\n\nHis son David, though but a child at the time of his father's death, may also be considered one of his pupils, either directly through his works, or indirectly through the instruction David received from his elder brother Moses.\n\nAbraham ibn Ezra, who in his wanderings visited Narbonne in 1160, may have possibly met Joseph. The latter followed Ibn Ezra in some particulars, e.g., in the use of the stem for the paradigm of the verb. Both scholars worked at the same time and along the same lines to popularize Judeo-Arabic science among the Jews of Christian Europe by excerpting from and translating Arabic works. Although ibn Ezra was Qimḥi's superior in knowledge, the latter can rightly claim to have been the first successful transplanter of Judeo-Arabic science in the soil of Christian Europe. His diction is elegant and lucid, the disposition of his material scientific, his treatment of his subject even and without digressions; so that his works are much better adapted for study than those of Ibn Ezra, which lack all these qualifications.\n\nAnother famous contemporary of Qimḥi was Jacob ibn Meïr, called Rabbeinu Tam, of Ramerupt, who was the greatest Talmudic authority of the day. This scholar, wishing to settle the literary quarrel between the followers of Menahem ben Saruq and of Dunash ben Labraṭ, had written a book of decisions ( \"hakhraʻot\"), in which he took the part of Menahem. These decisions did not satisfy Qimḥi. Feeling himself better able than Rabbeinu Tam to pass judgment in the case, he wrote the \"Sefer ha-Galui\" in 1165.\n\nThis work falls into two parts: the first treats the differences between Menahem and Dunash; the second contains independent criticisms on the former's dictionary. In the introduction, Qimḥi apologizes for daring to come forward against so eminent a man as the leading Talmudic authority of his time. Hearing that the ignorant among the people will attack him on that account, he puts into their mouths the words which Abner, the captain of Saul, spoke, when David cried out to the king: \"Who art thou that criest to the king?\" ('I Sam. 26,14').\n\nHis fears were realized; Benjamin of Canterbury, a pupil of Rabbeinu Tam, made observations on the \"Sefer ha-Galui\", defending his teacher. He also called Qimḥi in a contemptuous sense \"HaQore\" \"The Crier\" because the latter ventured to cry his contradictions to the \"king,\" i.e., Rabbeinu Tam.\n\nIn Qimḥi's grammatical works \"Sefer Zikkaron\" (edited by Bacher, Berlin, 1888) and \"Sefer haGalui\" (edited by Matthews, ib. 1887) he is dependent on Judah ben David Hayyuj for the treatment of his subject, but in his explanations of words he relies mainly on Jonah ibn Janah.\n\nOn the whole, he is not original; in minor points, however, he goes his own way, becoming therein the model for future generations. Thus he was the first to recognize that the hif'il has also a reflexive and an intransitive meaning; he was also the first to arrange a list of nominal forms, to indicate eight verb classes, and to classify the vowels into a system of five short and five long ones. In his works he pays frequent attention also to the language of the liturgy. In his etymological explanations he seeks for analogies in Bible, Talmud, Targum, and in Arabic. In cases where such analogies are wanting or unsatisfactory he is guided by the principle, \"The unknown must be deduced from the known.\" Not seldom he explains difficult words on the basis of phonetic laws laid down by himself.\n\nOf his exegetical works few have been preserved. Mention is made of his \"Sefer hatTorah\", a commentary on the Torah; his \"Sefer hamMiḳnah\", a commentary on the Nevi'im; and his \"Ḥibbur halLeḳeṭ\" of unknown contents. A commentary by him on the Song of Songs exists in manuscript; his commentary on the Book of Proverbs has been published by Dob Bär ans Dubrowo under the title \"Sefer Ḥuqqah\" (Breslau, 1868); and variants to the badly printed text are given by Eppenstein in \"Zeit. für Hebr. Bibl.\" v. 143 et seq.\n\nA fragment of his commentary on the Book of Job has been published by Schwarz in his \"Tiqwat Enosh\" (Berlin, 1868); the remaining portions, by Eppenstein in \"R. E. J.\" xxxvii. 86 et seq. Many exegetical remarks are scattered throughout Qimḥi's grammatical works. His method is mostly that of the peshaṭ, i.e., literal interpretation. He frequently follows the Spanish school, without, however, reading into the Scriptural text the scientific knowledge of his own time. He pays a great deal of attention to the context, a point usually neglected by Aggadists. His explanations are short and terse. While criticizing at times some untenable explanations of his predecessors, he accepts such as seem to him to be correct. He is the first eclectic of the Hachmei Provence.\n\nḲimḥi tried his hand also at writing poetry. His liturgical hymns and other poems which have come down are indeed distinguished by beauty of form and elegance of language. In spirit, however, they can not be compared with the works of the great Spanish Hebrew language poets. Nevertheless, he retains importance as one of the Provençal poets. His poems met with consideration at the hands of later generations and were frequently quoted by them. He is the first known author to write poems in the Magen Avot genre, and apparently is the inventor of the genre, which later became popular in Germany.\n\nHe translated Bahya ibn Paquda's ethical work \"Hobot halLebabot\" from Arabic into Hebrew, and he turned Solomon ibn Gabirol's \"Mibḥar hapPeninim\" into metrical form under the title \"Sheqel haqQodesh\". Of the translation, only a fragment has been preserved, which was published by Jellinek in Benjacob's edition of ibn Tibbon's translation of that work (Leipsic, 1846); the \"Sheqel\" is still unprinted. In his translation, aiming chiefly at elegance of expression, Ḳimḥi does not keep to the original. He works too independently and, carrying into the work his own spirit, he often obscures the thought of the author. Notwithstanding its defects, his translation is not without merit. It has contributed to a better understanding of the Arabic authors, and is, therefore, to be considered in a certain sense as supplementing the works of the Tibbonides.\n\nFinally mention must be made of Ḳimḥi's apologetic work \"Sefer ha-Berit,\" which contributed to Jewish polemics and apologetics in the Middle Ages, though it was not printed until a fragment was published in \"Milḥemet Ḥobah\" (Constantinople, 1710). This work was written at the request of one of his pupils who wished to have a collection of all the prophetic passages in Scripture that might serve as aids in refuting those persons who denied the Torah. It is in the form of a dialogue between a loyal Jew and an apostate. The loyal Jew claims that the true religion of the Jew may be recognized by the moral conduct of the individual; all Jews are intent on carrying out in their lives the Decalogue; they give no divine honors to any one besides God; do not perjure themselves; commit no murder; and are not robbers. Their children are educated in the fear of God; their women are chaste; the Jews are hospitable toward one another, perform works of charity, and redeem captives—all virtues which are not found in such a high degree among non-Jews. The apostate admits all these claims, but points out that Jews demand high interest on loans. This objection the loyal Jew meets with the statement that non-Jews also are usurers, and that they impose upon members of their own faith, while rich Jews lend money to their coreligionists without any interest whatever. The \"Sefer ha-Berit\" is of importance as showing the moral condition of the Jews at that time, and as bearing testimony to the conditions of those days, in which the Jews in the Provence could freely express themselves not only with regard to their own religion, but also with regard to the religion of their neighbors.\n\n"}

As a result of notoriety surrounding the sale of the house where the crimes occurred, the NSW government made it illegal to not disclose information related to the history of a property.\n\nSef Gonzales was born in 1980 in Baguio, Benguet, Philippines to Teddy Gonzales, a lawyer, and his wife Loiva who had married in 1977. In 1983, his sister Clodine was born. After the 1990 Luzon earthquake destroyed the family's home and business, a newly built 40-room hotel (from which Gonzales was rescued from the rubble by his father), the family emigrated to Australia. The family settled in Sydney, and by the late 1990s, Teddy had requalified as a lawyer, set up a successful law firm, began working as an immigration lawyer, and purchased a plot of land in North Ryde.\n\nThe family appeared to be close-knit: the parents, however, were devout Catholics who, as tiger parents, had high hopes and strict expectations for their children. In particular, they had hoped their son would perform well academically, give up his musical and singing aspirations, and embark on a career in medicine or law. After attending Parramatta Marist High School, Gonzales studied medical science at the University of New South Wales but withdrew after two years. He then enrolled in law at Macquarie University. Performing poorly in his courses and at risk of expulsion, Gonzales tried to cover up his failure by falsifying his grades. When this was revealed by his sister to his parents, they threatened to withdraw certain privileges such as the use of his prized car, a green Ford Festiva. Gonzales also argued with his mother over a girlfriend of whom she disapproved, and his family threatened to disinherit him. This, along with Gonzales's desire to inherit the family's assets, were later established by police as motives for killing his family.\n\nOn 10 July 2001, at about 4:00p.m., Gonzales left the family's law firm, where he worked part-time, and headed to the family home. Around 4:30 pm, armed with a baseball bat from his car and with two kitchen knives from a knife block in the kitchen, he entered Clodine's bedroom and assaulted her while she was studying. There he compressed her neck while trying to strangle her, struck her head with the bat at least six times, and then stabbed her multiple times with the smaller of the knives. The cause of Clodine's death was a combination of the compression of her neck, blunt force head injuries, and abdominal stab wounds. Gonzales then waited until Loiva arrived home about 5:30p.m. After entering the house, Gonzales attacked her with one of the kitchen knives in the living/dining room. Gonzales inflicted multiple stab wounds and cuts to her face, neck, chest and abdomen. Her windpipe was then completely transected post-mortem.\n\nAt around 6:00 pm, Gonzales's maternal aunt visited the house. She noted her nephew's and sister's cars in the driveway, but the house was dark and unusually quiet (especially given that the family kept six small dogs inside). Looking into the house, she noticed movement, and left with her son after deciding not to enter via the garage. Teddy then arrived home about 6.50pm. After entering the house, Gonzales attacked him with one of the kitchen knives and inflicted multiple stab wounds to his neck, chest, back and abdomen. One of the stab wounds penetrated his right lung, another penetrated his heart and another partially severed his spinal cord. Teddy sustained defensive wounds, suggesting that there was a struggle.\n\nAfter killing his family, Gonzales disposed of the murder weapons and the clothing and the size 7 running shoes he was wearing at the time of the murders. He showered, changed clothes, and spray painted the words \"Fuck off Asians\" on a wall in the house in an attempt to fool investigating police into believing that his family had been the victims of a hate crime. Gonzales then drove to a friend's house, arriving there about 8:00 pm. The two then went to the Sydney CBD, where they ate at Planet Hollywood and visited a nearby video game arcade. Later in the evening, after dropping his friend off, Gonzales returned home. He called emergency services at 11:48 pm to say he had discovered the bodies. Gonzales had also frantically run to his neighbours' house and told them that his parents had been shot.\n\nIn the days following the murders, Gonzales appeared on television asking for the killers to come forward, saying he wanted justice and offering a reward of $100,000. A few days after the murder, Gonzales visited the family's accountant, enquiring about his inheritance (estimated at $1.5m in Australia and $1.3m in The Philippines). As an apparent victim of crime, he was also eligible for a $15,000 payout. Gonzales then moved to an apartment in Chatswood and put a deposit on a $173,000 Lexus, telling the dealership he would be using his inheritance to pay for the vehicle. It was also claimed at trial that he traded in his parents' cars and pawned his mother's jewellery. Gonzales also told relatives that he had a brain tumour and asked his godmother in the Philippines for $190,000 for the alleged surgery. On 20 July, at the combined family funeral, he gave the eulogy and sang \"One Sweet Day\".\n\nBased on the initial evidence, NSW Police investigators assumed that the murders were part of a robbery attempt. However, given the absence of a forced entry and despite some superficial ransacking, nothing of value was missing, including the cash in the victims' possession. Also, given the 3-hour duration of the crimes it was deemed unlikely that thieves would remain in the house for that long. After noticing an emotional detachment and many inconsistencies in Gonzales' story, such as his claims of performing CPR, and no evidence of any intruders, police began to suspect that he was involved. Gonzales' clothes, for example, were found to have the same paint used in the graffiti scrawl and a shoe box in his room matched the shoes used in the attack. Based on this, his internet records were searched, his phone calls began to be recorded, and he was befriended and surveilled by an undercover policeman.\n\nIn December 2001, police were able to disprove Gonzales' first alibi, that he waited in his car in the driveway before driving to another suburb and later meeting his friend on the night of the murders. Gonzales then constructed a second alibi, claiming he had taken a taxi (as his car may have been recognised) and visited a brothel at the time of the murders, but this was discredited by both the supposed taxi driver and the sex worker. Other false trails included the fabrication of an e-mail that implicated a business rival of Teddy in the murders and the staging of an attempted burglary on 30 May. A breakthrough came when his fingerprint was matched to a series of product poisoning letters which matched address searches on his PC. Other evidence indicated his research into poisons, the ordering of toxic-plant seeds, and recent unexplained poisoning-like illnesses in his family. On 13 June 2002, detectives from Strike Force Tawas arrested Gonzales.\n\nGonzales was charged with three counts of murder and one count of threatening product contamination. He was refused bail and held on remand in Silverwater Correctional Centre. During this time, he was denied access to the family's estate to fund his defence, and sought legal aid for the murder trial which took place during April and May 2004. Prosecuted by Mark Tedeschi, the trial revealed that Gonzales had planned the murders for several months before they took place. Initially Gonzales researched the idea of poisoning his family, which led to an elaborate contamination hoax one week before the killings. The court heard of numerous lies told to his friends, family and police regarding his whereabouts at the time of the murders, suggesting that Gonzales was a pathological liar. It was found that he had committed the murders because he was fearful that, because of his poor performance in his university studies, his parents might take his car away from him and might withdraw other privileges which had been granted to him and that he wished to be the sole beneficiary of his parents' property.\n\nOn 20 May 2004, he was found guilty of all four charges. He was sentenced on 17 September 2004 to three concurrent life sentences without parole for the murders, Justice Bruce James remarked that \"I consider that the murders show features of very great heinousness and that there are no facts mitigating the objective seriousness of the murders and hence the murders fall within the worst category of cases of murder at common law.\" In June 2007, Gonzales was granted approval to appeal his conviction and his sentence. The Supreme Court determined that statements taken from Gonzales by police on the night of the murders may be inadmissible, as he was not cautioned. On 27 November 2007, the appeal was dismissed as there had been no miscarriage of justice, and his convictions remained. As of 2020, Gonzales maintains his innocence and continues to serve his sentence at the Goulburn Correctional Centre.\n\nThe North Ryde house, located at 6 Collins Street and built by the Gonzales in 2000, was put on the market shortly after the murders but due to its notoriety, it remained unsold for three years. Its eventual sale aroused controversy in October 2004 when prospective buyers, a couple from Taiwan, agreed to purchase the property. However, they had not been informed of the events that took place there by the realtors, LJ Hooker, only finding them out from a newspaper. LJ Hooker initially refused to reverse the sale as they had no legal obligation of disclosure, but eventually refunded the buyers' $80,000 deposit due to the bad publicity it caused. The company was also fined $21,000 by the NSW Office of Fair Trading. After this incident, the NSW government made it illegal to \"fail to disclose information that could have a substantial impact on the value of a property\". In November 2005, the house was sold for $720,000 ($80,000 less than the previous price) to a buyer who was informed of its history.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1963245", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1963245", "title": "Heartbreak House", "text": "Heartbreak House\n\nHeartbreak House: A Fantasia in the Russian Manner on English Themes is a play written by George Bernard Shaw, first published in 1919 and first played at the Garrick Theatre in November 1920. According to A. C. Ward, the work argues that \"cultured, leisured Europe\" was drifting toward destruction, and that \"Those in a position to guide Europe to safety failed to learn their proper business of political navigation\". The \"Russian manner\" of the subtitle refers to the style of Anton Chekhov, which Shaw adapts.\n\n\nEllie Dunn, her father, and her fiancé are invited to one of Hesione Hushabye’s infamous dinner parties, to be held at the house of her father, the eccentric Captain Shotover, an inventor in his late eighties who is trying to create a \"psychic ray\" that will destroy dynamite. The house is built in the shape of the stern of a ship. Lady Utterword, Shotover's other daughter, arrives from Australia, but he pretends not to recognise her. Hesione says they are running out of money. Shotover needs to invent a weapon of mass destruction. His last invention, a lifeboat, did not bring in much cash. Ellie intends to marry businessman Boss Mangan, but she really loves a man she met in the National Gallery. Unfortunately, her fiancé is a ruthless scoundrel, her father's a bumbling prig, and it turns out that the man she's in love with is Hector, Hesione's husband, who spends his time telling romantic lies to women. Marriage to Mangan will be the sensible choice.\n\nA burglar is captured. They say they do not want to prosecute him, but he insists he will turn himself in unless they pay him not to. It turns out that the burglar is one of Shotover's old crewmen. He confesses that he is not a real burglar. He deliberately gets himself captured to get charitable assistance from his victims. Shotover laments that the younger generation have lost their romance. Ellie suggests that she should marry Shotover, but he says he's already married to a black Jamaican wife, though it's possible she's now dead.\n\nLady Utterword says that everything will be put to right if only they get some horses. Every English family should have horses. Mangan declares that he is to head a government department, but Ellie suddenly announces that she cannot marry him as she is now Shotover's \"white wife\". Shotover predicts that the ship of England will founder, as the captain is drunk and the crew are all gambling. The maid enters with news that an air-raid is about to happen. The lights are switched off, but Hector switches them back on to demonstrate his lack of concern about the threat. A bomb lands in the garden, blowing up Shotover's store of dynamite and killing Mangan and the burglar who were hiding there. When it is over everyone says how bored they are. They hope the bombs will come again tomorrow.\n\nIn the preface to the play Shaw acknowledges his debt to Chekhov, in particular to \"The Cherry Orchard\". He writes that in comparison to himself, Chekhov was \"more of a fatalist, had no faith in these charming people extricating themselves. They would, he thought, be sold up and sent adrift by the bailiffs; therefore he had no scruple in exploiting and even flattering their charm.\"\n\nCritics have taken very different views about Shaw's adaptation of Chekhov. Louis Kronenberger says that Shaw \"turns Chekhov into a sort of literary Hyde Park soapbox dialectic for the theatre...We should be brow-beaten indeed to accept the idea that in \"Heartbreak House \"there is more than the merest hint or tiny reflection of Chekhov's true method, none of that pure, pains-taking economy and drawing, none of that humility of vision, none of that shy certainty of intuition. And Mr. Shaw's play has none of the variety in emotional rhythm that Chekhov's has, either in tone or in profound self-revelation among the characters.\"\n\nLouis Crompton, in contrast, says that,\n\nThomas Whitaker says that Shaw differs markedly from Chekhov by presenting his characters as mercurial \"rhetorical puppets\" which gives them a \"surprisingly rich vitality... a heartbroken adolescent can instantly become a cynic on the prowl, a maternal confidante can also be a seductive hostess and an emasculating wife, a philandering lapdog can be a shrewd judge of character and an offstage hero, and a mad hatter can be a mad Lear and a mad Shaw.\"\n\nThe house could arguably be a metaphorical reference to a ship which must be guided capably, not only by its crew, but also its passengers. Each character in the house represents to some degree a facet of Edwardian British society, Mangan being the \"nouveau riche\" capitalist, Hesione the flighty Bohemian, Ellie a struggling member of the bourgeoisie and so on. Shaw divides the Edwardian upper-class into two facets: the traditional country-based gentry and aristocracy (those of Horseback Hall) and the upper middle-class (those of Heartbreak House). The \"horsey set\" are identified with activity, most of it pointless; the \"rentiers\" with passivity, equally pointless. Both groups share the delusion that their worlds could continue to travel in tandem forever, which they did until Sarajevo.\n\nOne of Shaw's most important and evident themes is reality versus appearances. By the end of the play, each character is revealed to be nothing like who they appeared to be in the beginning.\nMangan, who was reported to be \"a Napoleon of industry\" is revealed in the third act to be virtually penniless and incapable of running his own businesses. It is in fact Mazzini who runs Mangan's businesses although he at first appears mild and incompetent.\n\nMazzini's belief in fate ruling his life reinforces his feeble ability to control his situation and according to the captain dooms the ship to destruction unless competent navigation can be learned:\n\nCaptain Shotover: \"Navigation. Learn it and live; or leave it and be damned.\" (p. 141)\n\nThe play was first performed in New York at the Garrick Theatre in November 1920, with Albert Perry as Shotover and Elizabeth Risdon as Ellie Dunn. It was first presented in England on 18 October 1921, at the Royal Court, with Ellen O'Malley as Ellie and Brember Wills as Shotover. Edith Evans played Lady Utterword. \n\"Heartbreak House\" is not often performed due to its complex structure; however it is argued that the genius of the play cannot be fully appreciated without seeing it in performance. Its subject-matter is the ignorance and indifference exhibited by the upper and upper-middle classes to the First World War and its consequences. The self-indulgence and lack of understanding of the high-class characters are central issues in British society at the time that the play illuminates.\n\nIt was directed by John Schlesinger in a production by the National Theatre at the Old Vic in 1975 with Anna Massey, Colin Blakely, Eileen Atkins, Patience Collier and Kate Nelligan.\n\nIn 1981 it was produced at the Royal Exchange, Manchester directed by Jonathon Hales with Eleanor Bron and Lynsey Baxter\n\nA major Broadway revival was mounted in 1984, with an all star cast headed by Sir Rex Harrison as Shotover (a role for which he was nominated for a Tony), and featuring Amy Irving, Rosemary Harris, Dana Ivey, George N. Martin and Tom Aldredge.\n\nThe play has been performed several times at the Shaw Festival in Niagara-on-the-Lake, Ontario, Canada: most notably in 1968 directed by Val Gielgud and with Jessica Tandy, Paxton Whitehead, Tony Van Bridge and Frances Hyland (this production was recorded and released by Caedmon Records [Caedmon TRS-335]); then in summer 2011 directed by Christopher Newton with Michael Ball as Captain Shotover, Blair Williams as Hector, Patrick McManus as Mazzini, Laurie Paton as Ariadne, Benedict Campbell as Mangan and Robin Evans Willis as Ellie. It also formed part of Chichester Festival Theatre's 50th Anniversary Season in 2012 and cast Derek Jacobi as Captain Shotover. The \"Denver Center Theatre Company\" staged it for a run 30 March to 29 April 2012.\n\nIt is available on VHS based on the 1985 television version directed by Anthony Page, with Rex Harrison as Shotover, Amy Irving as Ellie and Rosemary Harris as Hesione.\nAlso available on DVD is the 1977 BBC \"Play of the Month\" version directed by Cedric Messina, with John Gielgud as Shotover, Lesley-Anne Down as Ellie and Siân Phillips as Hesione.\n\nThe play was performed at Shaw's Corner 25–27 July 2014, produced by Michael Friend and by the Abbey Theatre, Dublin from 14 August to 13 September 2014.\n\nIn 2018, the play was staged Off-Broadway from 28 August to 29 September. The production was directed by David Staller and produced by Gingold Theatrical Group, a New York-Based Theatre Group dedicated to presenting plays that echo Shaw's values.\n\nAleksandr Sokurov's loose film adaptation \"Mournful Unconcern\" (\"Skorbnoye beschuvstviye\") was made in 1987.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1963273", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1963273", "title": "Australian Skeptics", "text": "Australian Skeptics\n\nAustralian Skeptics is a loose confederation of like-minded organisations across Australia that began in 1980. Australian Skeptics investigate paranormal and pseudoscientific claims using scientific methodologies. This page covers all Australian skeptical groups which are of this mindset. The name \"Australian Skeptics\" can be confused with one of the more prominent groups, \"Australian Skeptics Inc\" which is based in Sydney and is one of the central organising groups within the Australian Skeptics.\n\nIn 1979, Mark Plumber (later president of Australian Skeptics) sent a letter to the American skeptical magazine \"The Zetetic\" in which he expressed interest in beginning a skeptical organisation in Australia. Sydney electronics entrepreneur Dick Smith responded to the letter, and offered to sponsor a visit to Australia by James Randi, the principal investigator for the American-based Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal (CSICOP), now known as the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry (CSI), part of the non-profit organisation Center for Inquiry (CFI), which are joint publishers of the \"Skeptical Inquirer\". During this visit, James Randi, Dick Smith, Phillip Adams, Richard Carleton and an unidentified businessman offered a $50,000 prize to anyone who could prove psychic phenomena in front of Randi. A number of contenders, largely water diviners came forward, but all failed to prove their claims in front of independent observers.\n\nThe Australian Skeptics formed in 1980 out of this event, with the original purpose of continuing to test claims of the paranormal, with committee members Mark Plummer (president), James Gerrand (secretary), Joe Rubinstein (treasurer), and Allan Christophers, as well as Bill Cook, John Crellin, Logan Elliot, Peter Kemeny, Loris Purcell, and Mike Wilton. It was at this time that the group adopted the name \"Australian Skeptics\". The amount of the prize was raised to AU$100,000 and it has been offered since then (see The $100,000 Prize below). Very soon after the original formation of the Australian Skeptics in Victoria, Barry Williams from Sydney, New South Wales, responded to a call from Dick Smith seeking interest for new members. He became involved, and the New South Wales committee formed. The New South Wales committee included Barry Williams (president), Tim Mendham (secretary/treasurer), Mel Dickson, Dick Champion, Jean Whittle and others. The Australian Skeptics are the second oldest English language skeptical group in the world after CSICOP in the US, which is now known as CSI. Tim Mendham joined the NSW committee from the from the very first meeting and went on to became secretary, treasurer, and editor of the magazine.\n\nIn 1986, the year after the first national convention in Sydney (see below), Mark Plummer stepped down as national president when he began a new job as an executive officer at CSICOP in the US, which is now known as CSI. At this time the NSW Skeptics group took over the role as the national secretariat and the national committee, but the magazine production remained in Victoria with various editors including James Durand. The national committee didn’t consist of representative from all the state organisations, but rather was just of the state groups which acted as the national organising committee. \"Australian Skeptics incorporated in NSW\" (Australian Skeptics Inc.) or \"ASI\" became an incorporated association in 1986 in NSW with Barry Williams as president.\n\nASI still operates today and is responsible for several national activities, such as the publication of \"The Skeptic\" magazine and coordination of awards (listed below) and the annual conventions. Today ASI is one of many formal and informal skeptical groups throughout Australia which fall under the general umbrella title of \"Australian Skeptics\". Over time, other branches around Australia became incorporated including Australian Skeptics (Victorian Branch) Inc, Skeptics (S.A.) Incorporated, Hunter Skeptics Incorporated, Canberra Skeptics and Borderline Skeptics Inc (which caters for skeptics living around the NSW and Victorian border). ASI is the local group in NSW.\n\nIn 1995 the Australian Skeptics received a sizeable bequest from the estate of Stanley David Whalley. With these funds the organisation established the \"Australian Skeptics Science and Education Foundation\", tasked to expose \"irrational activities and pseudoscience and to encourage critical thinking and the scientific view\". This foundation now funds the \"Thornett award for promotion of reason\", known affectionately as \"the Fred\", named after the late Fred Thornett, an influential figure in the skeptical movement in Tasmania and nationally. \"The Fred\" is a $1000 prize given by ASI for significant contribution to educating or informing the public regarding issues of science and reason. The bequest also allowed for the introduction of a paid position, that of executive officer. This position is answerable to the ASI committee, and traditionally manages accounts, queries from the public and media, editing \"The Skeptic\", and various sundry tasks. Barry Williams was executive officer from 1995 to 2009, followed by Karen Stollznow (2009) and Tim Mendham from 2009 to the present.\n\nIn 1989 at a national committee meeting the aims of Australian Skeptics were updated and drafted as follows;\n\nAs of 2015, every state and territory within Australia has its own regional branch, and some have their own newsletters, with new local skeptics' groups springing up in Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide, Launceston and Darwin.\n\nThe Thornett Award for the Promotion of Reason, affectionately known as \"The Fred\" (much like the Academy Award is known as the \"Oscar\"), is named after Fred Thornett, a noted member of Australian Skeptics from Tasmania, who died in April 2009. The Fred award includes a $2000 cash prize (increased from $1000 in 2018) that is given to the recipient or to a charity or cause of their choice. It is awarded annually to a member of the public or a public figure who has made a significant contribution to educating or informing the public regarding issues of science and reason.\nThe Skeptic of the Year award is given annually to someone associated with the skeptical community who has been particularly active over the previous year. ASI coordinates the prize, and the final decision is voted on by representatives from the various Australian Skeptics groups.\n\nThe Barry Williams Award for Skeptical Journalism which recognises \"the best piece of journalism (in any medium) that takes a critical and skeptical approach to a topic\" within the scope of the Australian Skeptics. The award is named in memory of Barry Williams who died in 2018 and carries a $AU2000 prize. Williams was a past president and executive officer of Australian Skeptics who regularly appeared in the Australian media. The award has been nicknamed \"the Wallaby\" after the \"nom-de-plume\" Sir Jim R Wallaby, used by Williams in some of his more whimsical writing.\n\nThe Bent Spoon Award is an annual award coordinated by ASI, however the final decision is voted on by representatives from the various groups comprising Australian Skeptics. It is \"presented to the perpetrator of the most preposterous piece of paranormal or pseudoscientific piffle\" in a tongue-in-cheek fashion. The award trophy is a piece of gopher wood supposedly from the Noah's Ark, upon which is affixed a spoon rumoured to have been used at the Last Supper. The spoon was allegedly bent by energies unknown to science and gold plated by an Atlantean process. Although awarded annually since 1982, only one copy of the trophy exists, as \"anyone wishing to acquire the trophy must remove it from our keeping by paranormal means\" and no winner has yet overcome this obstacle.\n\nThe award is only offered to Australian individuals or groups, or those who have carried out their activities in Australia. The New Zealand Skeptics have a similar Bent Spoon Award.\n∞ \n\nSince its foundation in 1980, Australian Skeptics has been offering a cash prize to anyone who can prove they have psychic or paranormal powers and is able to demonstrate their ability under proper observing conditions. The offer has been made in an effort to seek out the truth of paranormal claims such as those of psychics, healers, witnesses to paranormal events and those selling devices which claim to defy scientific laws. If someone nominates another person, and that person is successful, then 20% of the prize may be awarded the nominator.\n\nThe challenge originally offered $50,000 to any water diviner who was able to demonstrate their powers, and it was later raised, with contributions from various sources, to AU$100,000 offered to anyone who could demonstrate any form of paranormal or psychic ability unknown to science. Up to the end of 2018, more than 200 claims have been seriously investigated but none of them has produced a positive result.\n\nThis challenge is now coordinated by ASI and the prize money is backed by the Australian Skeptics Science and Education Foundation. It is open to any contender who can state exactly what their paranormal claim is, and the claim can give a definite yes or no result. They must define under what conditions the claim can be performed, and expect to beat million to one odds in order to claim success. The result of each test is then published in \"The Skeptic\", the magazine of Australian Skeptics. ASI states that should any contender pass the challenge, and be awarded the prize, they want to tell the world and give the claimant proper recognition. If, however, a claim is proved to be unfounded or fraudulent, the association reserve the right to expose this result in an effort to prevent clients from spending time and money on a product or service that cannot deliver what is claimed for it.\n\nThe Australian Museum Eureka Awards is a series of annual awards presented by the Australian Museum in partnership with their sponsors, for excellence in various fields. Until 2005 the Australian Skeptics were major sponsors of the award for critical thinking, which during this period was awarded to:\n\nAfter 2005 the Australian Skeptics decided to withdraw from the Eurekas, and award their own critical thinking Prize known as the Australian Skeptics Critical Thinking Prize. The winners are as follows:\n\nBoth of these prizes have been discontinued.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Australian Skeptics National Convention is the longest running annual skeptical convention, and has been held annually since 1985.\nNo Answers in Genesis is a website affiliated with the Australian Skeptics organisation that provides information to defend the theory of evolution, and, more specifically, counter young Earth creationist arguments put forward by Answers in Genesis. It was founded by Australian atheist and skeptic John Stear, a retired civil servant. The website contains links, essays and other postings that rebut creationist arguments against evolution. Stear states that the site is meant for educational purposes as well as to illustrate the problems with young Earth creationism. The site also contains simple introductions to evolutionary concepts. It mainly has posts, on creationism, but now has some essays on \"intelligent design\". It has two discussion boards.\n\nIn June 2005, members of the creationist group Answers in Genesis – Australia debated a team from the Australian Skeptics online on Margo Kingston's web diary section of the \"Sydney Morning Herald\" website.\n\nIn 1984 the Australian Skeptics brought magician Bob Steiner to Australia to pose as a psychic under the name \"Steve Terbot\". He went on \"The Bert Newton Show\" with Derryn Hinch who was in on the hoax, and accused him of being a charlatan. He also performed shows to live audiences in Melbourne and Sydney, pretending to be psychic. He later returned to the \"Bert Newton Show\" to reveal that he was a magician performing a hoax.\n\nLater in February 1988 Richard Carleton, a reporter on the TV show \"60 Minutes\", brought James Randi back to Australia to oversee an elaborate hoax involving a fictional character named \"Carlos\" who was reported to be a 2,000-year-old entity who had last appeared in the body of a 12-year-old boy in Venezuela in 1900 was now manifesting through a young American art student named José Alvarez. In reality José had no special abilities, and was actually Randi's partner and assistant. The hoax involved the character \"Carlos\" appearing on various television shows in character and culminated in channel nine hosting a large media event at the Sydney Opera House where members from the Australian Skeptics were interviewed in front of a large audience of believers. The Australian Skeptics had not been made aware of the hoax until hours before it was revealed, a few days later, on \"60 Minutes\". There was outrage amongst the Australian media, to which Randi responded by pointing out that none of the journalists had bothered with even the most elementary fact-checking measures. There were some among the Australian Skeptics who took the view that this hoax had the potential of harming the good relationships that had been formed with certain media organisations, possibly discouraging them from reporting critically on similar stories in the future, and instead leaving such stories to other, less skeptical media organisations.\n\nOver the years the Australian Skeptics have conducted many investigations and demonstrations. Some examples are as follows:\n\nIn the early 1980s Dick Smith brought James Randi to Australia to conduct a test to determine whether those who conduct water divining have any real abilities. They laid out a grid of plastic irrigation pipes which were able to have water flowing or not flowing, and then challenged water diviners to determine with pipes contained the running water. Prior to the testing, the diviners agreed that the experimental conditions were suitable, however, when they were unable to display any ability, they changed their positions and blamed various external influences for preventing their success. This experiment was repeated several times beginning in 2001 using bottled water and bottled sand hidden within paper bags, with similar results.\n\nIn 1983 Ian Bryce and Mark Plummer investigated a patent filed for a \"water powered car\", designed by Stephen Horvath. The car was well publicised in the media of the day, and promoted by the then Premier of Queensland; Joh Bjelke-Petersen. The investigation concluded that the claim that the car was powered by nuclear fusion was not supported by evidence.\n\nIn 1981 when James Randi was visiting Australia he demonstrated how psychic surgery can be performed by sleight of hand with no actual surgery taking place. This was then later demonstrated again by the Australian Skeptics at a convention held in Sydney. The publicity from these demonstrations led to other forms of media, including the Australian \"Penthouse\" magazine publishing the story.\n\nThe Victorian Skeptics have demonstrated several times how firewalking or lying on a bed of nails can be achieved without any harm to the person. As publicity stunts they had various celebrities such as Steve Moneghetti, as well as committee members including Barry Williams, demonstrate fire walking, and then invited members of the public to repeat the stunt.\n\nThe journal of the Australian Skeptics is called \"The Skeptic\". The first issue of the skeptic magazine came out of Melbourne in January 1981, edited by Mark Plummer and produced by James Gerrand. The first issue was a black and white broadsheet tabloid. For many years the logo was the same logo as the American publication the \"Skeptical Inquirer\" only photocopied with the end chopped off. After that first issue, the format was reduced to a standard A4 publication produced on a typewriter. In the early days of the Australian Skeptics there was a strong focus on media and outreach, and the magazine ran a special column in each issue listing all media coverage for that period. After the national secretariat moved up to NSW in 1986, the production of the magazine was moved to the Sydney branch in 1987 with Tim Mendham as the new editor, and at this time the magazine was produced on a computer (a Macintosh) for the first time. About a year before the change, there was a competition held to choose a new logo for the Australian Skeptics, and this new logo was used in the magazines up until the 1990s. In 1988 for the first time the magazine was produced with a cover, showing the title and various art work, and for a few years after that the publication was produced in a different colour for each issue. In 1990 Tim Mendham stepped down as editor and Barry Williams took on the role, intending to only edit one issue in 1991, but then remaining in the role until 2008. Both Karen Stollznow and Steve Roberts were editors briefly in 2009, until editing was handed back to Tim Mendham in June 2009, and with whom it remains today.\n\nThe first big project that the Australian Skeptics undertook was in the 1980s when two scientists, Martin Bridgstock and Ken Smith, researched the various claims of creationism, and the Australian Skeptics, along with other authors, published a very successful book detailing their debunking of creationist claims. The book, titled \"Creationism: An Australian Perspective\" was first published 1986. At this time creationism was still being taught in science classes in some public schools in Queensland, but this research led to campaigns led by Martin Bridgstock, which resulted in creationism being removed from science classes. Ken Smith and Martin Bridgestock were both awarded the first life memberships in the Australian Skeptics at the 1986 convention for this service.\n\nThe Australian Skeptics also re-published the book \"Gellerism Revealed: The Psychology and Methodology Behind the Geller Effect\" by Ben Harris, originally published in 1985.\n\nThe Canberra Skeptics also published a book titled \"Skeptical\" which gave one- to two-page overviews of various skeptical topics.\n\nDuring the creationism in science classes debate, the Australian Skeptics attended a talk by a creationist geologist and collected various leaflets at that event. They responded to the leaflets by setting up a small sub-committee for the purpose of researching and responding to the various points raised in the creationist leaflets. The results of this research were published in a booklet in 1991 titled \"Creationism-Scientists Respond\".\n"}

She was the second Estonian musician with higher education.\n\nHer greatest contribution is perhaps the fact that she took organ music to the countryside, as virtually no skilled organists gave concerts outside of towns.\n\nDuring her 60-year period of creativity, she wrote more than 200 choral songs, 10 cavatinas, a canto, \"Kalev and Linda\" and much more. Most of her works were forms of vocal music, rather than instrumentals.\n\nHärma was born Miina Hermann in 1864 in Kõrveküla, Livonia, Russian Empire to a local teacher and his wife. There were seven children in the family. Both of her parents were musically educated.\nHärma began to learn music on her own with a small organ her father bought her. When she was 15, Härma began studying with K. A. Hermann, who gave her lessons in both musical composition and piano.\n\nIn 1883, Härma entered the Saint Petersburg Conservatory as its only organ student that year. She graduated in 1890, but continued to live in Saint Petersburg because it was very hard to find work in the Baltic governorates. In 1894, the fifth Estonian Song Festival took place, which led to the formation of Härma's own choir.\nIn 1903, as financial problems overwhelmed her, Härma moved to Kronstadt, Governorate of Saint Petersburg. She had to leave the city in 1915 because of the beginning of the First World War, as no civilians were allowed to stay there.\nDespite the fact that music had rapidly developed in Tartu, it was still hard to find a job as a music teacher, since there were almost no students due to the war.

{"id": "1963303", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1963303", "title": "Canopus, Egypt", "text": "Canopus, Egypt\n\nCanopus, also known as Canobus (), was an Ancient Egyptian coastal town, located in the Nile Delta. Its site is in the eastern outskirts of modern-day Alexandria, around from the center of that city. Canopus was located on the western bank at the mouth of the westernmost branch of the Delta – known as the Canopic or Heracleotic branch. It belonged to the seventh Egyptian Nome, known as \"Menelaites\", and later as \"Canopites\", after it. It was the principal port in Egypt for Greek trade before the foundation of Alexandria, along with Naucratis and Heracleion. Its ruins lie near the present Egyptian town of Abu Qir.\n\nThe settlement's Egyptian name was written in Demotic as \"pr-gwṱ\" (sometimes romanized Peguat or Pikuat). The Greeks called it Canopus (, \"Kánōpos\") after a legendary commander of the era of the Trojan War supposedly buried there. The English form of the name derives from the Latinized form used under Roman rule.\n\nCanopus was the site of a temple to the Egyptian god Serapis.\n\nThe name of Canopus appears in the first half of the 6th century BC in a poem by Solon. Early Egyptological excavations some 2 or 3 km from the area known today as Abu Qir have revealed extensive traces of the city with its quays, and granite monuments with the name of Ramesses II, but they may have been brought in for the adornment of the place at a later date. The exact date of the foundation of Canopus is unknown, but Herodotus refers to it as an ancient port. Homeric myth claims that it was founded by Menelaus, and named after Canopus, the pilot of his ship, who died there after being bitten by a serpent. Legend describes how Menelaus built a monument to his memory on the shore, around which the town later grew up. There is unlikely to be any connection with \"canopy\". A temple to Osiris was built by king Ptolemy III Euergetes, but according to Herodotus, very near to Canopus was an older shrine, a temple of Heracles that served as an asylum for fugitive slaves. Osiris was worshipped at Canopus under a peculiar form: that of a vase with a human head. Through an old misunderstanding, the name \"canopic jars\" was applied by early Egyptologists to the vases with human and animal heads in which the internal organs were placed by the Egyptians after embalming.\n\nIn Ptolemy III Euergetes' ninth regnal year (239 BC), a great assembly of priests at Canopus passed an honorific decree (the \"Decree of Canopus\") that, \"inter alia,\" conferred various new titles on the king and his consort, Berenice. Three examples of this decree are now known (plus some fragments), inscribed in Egyptian (in both hieroglyphic and demotic) and in classical Greek, and they were second only to the more famous Rosetta Stone in providing the key to deciphering the ancient Egyptian language. This was the earliest of the series of bilingual inscriptions of the \"Rosetta Stone Series\", also known as the Ptolemaic Decrees. There are three such Decrees altogether.\n\nThe town had a large trade in henna.\n\nIn Roman times, the town was notorious for its dissoluteness. Juvenal's \"Satire VI\" referred to the \"debauchery\" that prevailed there. The emperor Hadrian built a villa at Tivoli, 18 miles away from Rome, where he replicated for his enjoyment architectural patterns from all parts of the Roman Empire. One of these (and the most excavated and studied today) was borrowed from Canopus.\n\nThe Egyptian town of Abu Qir (\"Father Cyrus\"), honoring two Christian martyrs, is located a few kilometres away from the ruins of Canopus. It is a town (around 1900 with 1000 inhabitants), at the end of a little peninsula north-east of Alexandria. It has a trade in quails, which are caught in nets hung along the shore. Off Aboukir on 1 August 1798, the French Mediterranean fleet was destroyed within the roads by British Admiral Horatio Nelson. On 25 July 1799, Napoleon Bonaparte destroyed there a Turkish army 18,000 strong; and on 8 March 1801, the French garrison of 1,800 men was defeated by 20,000 English and Ottoman Turks commanded by Abercromby.\n\nEgypt had many martyrs in the persecution of Diocletian, among others St. Athanasia with her three daughters, and St. Cyrus and John. There was here a monastery called Metanoia, founded by monks from Tabennisi, where many a patriarch of Alexandria took shelter during the religious quarrels of the 5th century. east of Canopus was the famous Pharaonic temple of Manouthin, afterwards destroyed by monks, and a church on the same spot dedicated to the Four Evangelists. St. Cyril of Alexandria solemnly transported the relics of the holy martyrs Cyrus and John into the church, which became an important place of pilgrimage. It was here that St. Sophronius of Jerusalem was healed of an ophthalmy that had been declared incurable by the physicians (610–619), whereupon he wrote the panegyric of the two saints with a compilation of seventy miracles worked in their sanctuary (Migne, \"Patrologia Graeca\", LXXXVII, 3379-676) Canopus formed, with Menelaus and Schedia, a suffragan see subject to Alexandria in the Roman province of Aegyptus Prima; it is usually called Schedia in the \"Notitiae episcopatuum\". Two titulars are mentioned by Lequien (II, 415), one in 325, the other in 362.\n\nOver time the land around Canopus was weakened by a combination of earthquakes, tsunamis and rising sea levels. Finds of pottery and coins appear to stop at the end of the 2nd century BC. At this point, probably after a severe flood, the eastern suburbs succumbed to liquefaction of the soil on which it was built. The hard clay turned rapidly into a liquid and the buildings collapsed. The western suburbs eventually became the present day Egyptian coastal city of Abu Qir.\n\nIn 1933 ruins were sighted under the water by an RAF commander who was flying over Abu Qir Bay. Egyptian scholar Prince Omar Toussoun subsequently undertook archaeological investigations between 1934 and 1940. The undersea ruins were eventually identified as the lost cities of Heracleion and Canopus.\n\nIn 2000 the French underwater archaeologist Franck Goddio explored the submerged ruins of the two cities. Archaeological discoveries made by Goddio's team included parts of the \"Naos of the Decades\" temple and pieces of various statues, including a marble head of the god Serapis.\n\nAttribution:\n\n"}

In 1907 he started working for Norsk Hydro, and came to their factory in Rjukan in 1910-1911. In 1905, he debuted with \"Ung sorg\" (Young sorrow) and \"Kvæde\" (Songs), collections of poetry, followed by \"Sollaug\" in 1908, and \"Villfuglar\" (Wild birds) in 1909.\n\nWith the short-stories collection \"Ved Akerselva\" (By the Aker River) in 1910, Uppdal introduced his epic 10-volume series of novels, \"Dansen gjenom skuggeheimen\" (The Dance through the Shadow Land). Here listed are the separate volumes in the order that Uppdal himself later designated and explained in the preface to \"Herdsla\", along with year of publication:\n\n\nUppdal seems to have decided to link the stories together in hindsight, as he outlined the plan in the last volume, \"Herdsla\", and thus revised and republish the three volumes first published so they'd fit the puzzle. His intent, by his own statements, was to describe the dawn of the working class, its severance from its origins (the peasantry), the proletarization, and finally the modern worker and the worker movement. At the same time, Uppdal claimed he was not a \"proletarian poet;\" his main purpose was to describe the human being.\n\nTwo of the volumes were republished in revised editions in the 1950s, in which Uppdal (in addition to expanding the narrative considerably, and emphasizing the political agenda) had changed the language used into a more archaic and dialectal form. These editions didn't win any acclaim, and later editions of the series in the 1970s and 1985-91 were made from the 1919-24 editions.\n\nUppdal was also an important lyric poet. He gathered his finest poetry of youth and adulthood in \"Elskhug\" (Love) in 1919, and \"Altarelden\" (The Altar Fire) in 1920. Of his poetry, Johs. A. Dale has written that \"It has a primitive strength and a masculine self-assertion, and is marked by suffering and conflict of the soul.\" Uppdal was finally granted a poet's pension by the state in 1939, perhaps due to his long periods of financial hardship.\n\nWhen confronted with his difficult prose and asked if he had plans to make his novels more audience-friendly, he is said to have responded: \"I don't give a damn about the audience! Don't give a hoot about what anyone else says, be yourself even if it should take you straight to the pits of Hell.\"\n"}

Some remains of the castle, which stood for only 50 years, are still visible on what is now Vredenburg square in Utrecht.\n\nIn 1528, the Holy Roman Empire annexed the Bishopric of Utrecht, and Emperor Charles V immediately ordered the construction of a castle in Utrecht, not only to protect the domain from invasion by the duke of Guelders, but also to retain control over the city's unruly population. Construction began in 1529 and was completed in 1532.\n\nOn 8 November 1576, the States General of the Seventeen Provinces ratified an agreement, known as the Pacification of Ghent, to remove Spanish occupying soldiers. In response the castle's Spanish garrison prepared to be besieged by the Dutch rebels, turning the castle's cannons towards the city itself.\n\nBy December, the siege was underway and fighting broke out between the Spanish and Dutch. However, the garrison abandoned the castle on 11 February 1577, following negotiations between garrison commander Francesco Fernando d'Avila and Maximilien de Hénin-Liétard, the count of Bossu, who served as temporary Dutch stadholder. The abandonment was part of a general withdrawal agreed upon by the new Governor-General Don Juan one day later, on 12 February.\n\nThe citizens of Utrecht demanded that the castle be demolished to prevent the Spanish or other foreign powers from dominating the city again in future. However, the city government opposed demolition, so as not to offend the emperor. On 2 May, the population took the matter into their own hands. According to legend, a group of local women led by Trijn van Leemput stormed the castle and Trijn gave the signal for the castle to be destroyed by removing the first bricks from the castle walls. Despite doubts about the historical accuracy of this tale, a statue of Trijn van Leemput was erected on the in Utrecht in 1955.\n\nThe demolition of the castle lasted until 1581. The two western towers remained standing, as they were part of the outer city walls. However, they were also demolished piece by piece in the following centuries; by 1919 they had completely disappeared. The foundations of Vredenburg castle were uncovered during archaeological excavations in 1976 and 1978.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1963347", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1963347", "title": "Four sons of Horus", "text": "Four sons of Horus\n\nThe four sons of Horus were a group of four gods in Egyptian religion, who were essentially the personifications of the four canopic jars, which accompanied mummified bodies. Since the heart was thought to embody the soul, it was left inside the body. The brain was thought only to be the origin of mucus, so it was reduced to liquid, removed with metal hooks, and discarded. This left the stomach (and small intestines), liver, large intestines, and lungs, which were removed, embalmed and stored, each organ in its own jar. There were times when embalmers deviated from this scheme: during the 21st Dynasty they embalmed and wrapped the viscera and returned them to the body, while the canopic jars remained empty symbols.\n\nThe earliest reference to the sons of Horus the Elder is found in the Pyramid Texts where they are described as friends of the king, as they assist the king in his ascension to heaven in the eastern sky by means of ladders. Their association with Horus the Elder specifically goes back to the Old Kingdom when they were said not only to be his children but also his souls. As the king, or Pharaoh was seen as a manifestation of, or especially protected by, Horus, these \"parts\" of the deceased pharaoh, referred to as the Osiris, were seen as parts of Horus, or rather, his children.\n\nIsis was often seen as the mother of the four sons of Horus though in the details of the funerary ritual each son, and therefore each canopic jar, was protected by a particular goddess. Others say their mother was Serket, goddess of medicine and magic. Just as the sons of Horus protected the contents of a canopic jar, the king's organs, so they in turn were protected. As they were male in accordance with the principles of male/female duality their protectors were female.\n\n\nThe classic depiction of the four sons of Horus on Middle Kingdom coffins show Imsety and Duamutef on the eastern side of the coffin and Hapi and Qebehsenuef on the western side. The eastern side is decorated with a pair of eyes and the mummy was turned on its side to face the east and the rising sun; therefore, this side is sometimes referred to as the front. The sons of Horus also became associated with the cardinal compass points, so that Hapi was the north, Imsety the south, Duamutef the east and Qebehsenuef the west.\n\nUntil the end of the 18th Dynasty the canopic jars had the head of the king, but later they were shown with animal heads.\n\nHapi (xapi) the baboon headed son of Horus protected the lungs of the deceased and was in turn protected by the goddess Nephthys. The spelling of his name includes a hieroglyph which is thought to be connected with steering a boat, although its exact nature is not known. For this reason he was sometimes connected with navigation, although early references call him the great runner: \"You are the great runner; come, that you may join up my father N and not be far in this your name of Hapi, for you are the greatest of my children – so says Horus\"\n\nIn Spell 151 of the Book of the Dead Hapi is given the following words to say: \"I have come to be your protection. I have bound your head and your limbs for you. I have smitten your enemies beneath you for you, and given you your head, eternally.\"\n\nSpell 148 in the Book of the Dead directly associates all four of Horus's sons, described as the four pillars of Shu and one of the four rudders of heaven, with the four cardinal points of the compass. Hapi was associated with the north.\n\nImsety the human headed son of Horus, protected the liver of the deceased and was in turn protected by the goddess Isis. It seems that his role was to help revivify the corpse of the dead person, as he is asked to lift them up by Horus: \"You have come to N; betake yourself beneath him and lift him up, do not be far from him, (even) N, in your name of Imsety.\"\n\nTo stand up meant to be active and thus alive while to be prone signified death. In Spell 151 of the Book of the Dead Imsety is given the following words to say: \"I am your son, Osiris, I have come to be your protection. I have strengthened your house enduringly. As Ptah decreed in accordance with what Ra himself decrees.\" Again the theme of making alive and revivifying is alluded to through the metaphor of making his house flourish. He does this with the authority of two creator gods Ptah and Ra (or Re).\n\nSpell 148 in the Book of the Dead directly associates all four of Horus's sons to the four cardinal points. Imsety was associated with the south.\n\nDuamutef, the jackal-headed son of Horus, protected the stomach of the deceased and was in turn protected by the goddess Neith. It seems that his role was to worship the dead person, and his name means literally \"he who worships his mother\". In the Coffin Texts Horus calls upon him, \"Come and worship my father N for me, just as you went that you might worship my mother Isis in your name Duamutef.\"\n\nIsis had a dual role. Not only was she the wife of Osiris and the mother of Horus, but she was also the consort of Horus the Elder and thus the mother of the sons of Horus. This ambiguity is added to when Duamutef calls Osiris, rather than Horus his father, although kinship terms were used very loosely, and \"father\" can be used as \"ancestor\" and \"son\" as \"descendant\". In Spell 151 of the Book of the Dead Duamutef is given the following words to say: \"I have come to rescue my father Osiris from his assailant\n\nThe text does not make it clear who might assail Osiris, although there are two major candidates. The obvious one is Set, the murderer of Osiris. Somehow the son who worships his mother Isis is able to assist in overcoming Set. The other possibility is Apophis, the serpent demon who prevents the Sun's passage and thus the resurrection of Osiris. Either way, Duamutef through his worship of Isis has the power to protect the deceased from harm.\n\nDuamutef was also considered one of the four pillars of Shu, a rudder of heaven, and was associated with the east.\n\nQebehsenuef was the falcon-headed son of Horus, and protected the intestines of the deceased. He was in turn protected by the goddess Serket. It appears that his role was to refresh the dead person, and his name means literally \"he who libates his siblings\". Horus commands him, \"Come refresh my father; betake yourself to him in your name of Qebehsenuef. You have come that you may make coolness for him after you ... \"\n\nLibation or showering with cool water was a traditional form of worship in Ancient Egypt. There are many images of the pharaoh presenting libation to the gods. There is a sense of a dual function of cleansing and refreshing them.\n\nAfter Set murdered Osiris he cut the body into pieces and scattered them around the Delta. This was anathema to the Egyptians and the service that Qebehsenuef gives to the dead is to reassemble their parts so they can be properly preserved. In Spell 151 of the Book of the Dead he is given the following words to say: \"I am your son, Osiris, I have come to be your protection. I have united your bones for you, I have assembled your limbs for you. have brought you your heart, and placed it for you at its place in your body.\"\n\nQebehsenuef was the god associated with the west.\n\nThe reasons for attributing these four animals to the sons of Horus is not known, although we may point to other associations which these animals have in Egyptian mythology. The baboon is associated with the moon and Thoth, the god of wisdom and knowledge, and also the baboons which chatter when the sun rises raising their hands as if in worship. The jackal (or possibly dog) is linked to Anubis and the act of embalming and also Wepwawet the \"opener of the ways\" who seeks out the paths of the dead. The hawk is associated with Horus himself and also Seker the mummified necropolis god. Imseti, the human, may be linked to Osiris himself or Onuris the hunter.\n\nThe Egyptians themselves linked them with the ancient kings of Lower and Upper Egypt, the Souls of Pe and Nekhen. In Spells 112 and 113 of the Book of the Dead which have their origins in the earlier Coffin Texts Spells 157 and 158, it is described how Horus has his eye injured, and because of this is given the sons of Horus: \nThe injury of Horus's eye is part of the myth cycle known as the Contending of Horus and Set recounting how they fought over the crown of Egypt.\n\nIn a unique illustration in the tomb of Ay the sons of Horus are shown wearing the red and white crowns as the Souls of Pe and Nekhen, the souls of the royal ancestors.\n\nThe attributes of the sons of Horus are not limited to their role as the protectors of canopic jars. They appear as the four rudders of heaven in Spell 148 of the Book of the Dead, as four of the seven celestial spirits summoned by Anubis in Spell 17 of the Book of the Dead and through this are linked to the circumpolar stars of the Great Bear (or Plough): \"The tribunal around Osiris is Imset, Hapi, Duamutef, Qebehsenuf, these are at the back of the Plough constellation of the northern sky.\"\n\n\n\n"}

The demonstration involved throwing glass bottles containing a mixture of petrol and phosphorus at pieces of wood and into a hut. On breaking, the phosphorus was exposed to the air and spontaneously ignited; the petrol also burned resulting in a fierce fire. Because of safety concerns, the RAF was not interested in white phosphorus as a source of ignition, but the idea of a self-igniting petrol bomb took hold. Initially known as an \"A.W. bomb\", it was officially named the \"No. 76 grenade\", but was more commonly known as the \"SIP\" (self-igniting phosphorus) grenade. The perfected list of ingredients was white phosphorus, benzene, water and a two-inch strip of raw rubber; all in a half-pint bottle sealed with a crown stopper. Over time, the rubber would slowly dissolve making the contents slightly sticky and the mixture would separate into two layers – this was intentional and the grenade was not to be shaken to mix the layers as this would only delay ignition. When thrown against a hard surface, the glass would shatter and the contents would instantly ignite, liberating choking fumes of phosphorus pentoxide and sulphur dioxide as well as producing a great deal of heat.\n\nStrict instructions were issued to store the grenades safely, preferably underwater and certainly never in a house. Mainly issued to the Home Guard as an anti-tank weapon, it was produced in vast numbers; by August 1941 well over 6,000,000 had been manufactured.\n\nThe grenade could either be thrown by hand, or fired from the Northover projector, a simple mortar; a stronger container was needed for the latter and the two types were colour-coded. \n\nThere were many who were sceptical about the efficacy of Molotov cocktails and SIP grenades against the more modern German tanks. Weapon designer Stuart Macrae witnessed a trial of the SIP grenade at Farnborough: \"There was some concern that, if the tank drivers could not pull up quickly enough and hop out, they were likely to be frizzled to death, but after looking at the bottles they said they would be happy to take a chance.\" The drivers were proved right; trials on modern British tanks confirmed that Molotov and SIP grenades caused the occupants of the tanks \"no inconvenience whatsoever\".\n\nThe Home Guard hid caches of these grenades during the war for use in the event of an invasion. Not all locations were officially recorded and some caches were lost. Occasionally, the caches are discovered by builders digging foundations. In all cases, the grenades are still found to be dangerous and typically are destroyed via a controlled explosion.\n\n\n\n"}

It is identified by the police as belonging to Ann-Lynne, a local model. Lieutenant Fred Williams (Jack Hedley), the burned-out police detective investigating the murder, interviews the young woman's nosy landlady, Mrs. Weissburger (Babette New), who tells him that during her daily spying and eavesdropping on her tenants, she overheard the girl last week over the phone arranging to meet a man who spoke with a strange, duck-like voice.\n\nMeanwhile, a young woman (Cinzia de Ponti) rides her bicycle down Manhattan to the Staten Island Ferry at Battery Park. After an altercation with a motorist, she rides onto the boat. When the ferry is underway, the young woman sneaks into the car-bay and begins vandalizing the man's car, but is interrupted by an unseen figure, who adopts a grotesque duck voice and brutally murders her with a switchblade. At the morgue, Williams talks to Barry Jones the pathologist (Giordano Falzoni), who believes he recognizes the \"style\" of the killing and links it to Ann-Lynne, as well as a similar case in Harlem the previous month.\n\nHaving informed the press that a serial killer is at large, Williams is visited at the station by New York's chief of police (Lucio Fulci), who tells him not to make any further public announcements about the case to avoid starting a citywide panic. Soon after the chief leaves, Williams is notified that a man \"sounding like a duck\" phoned while he was out at the press conference wanting to speak with him. Williams travels to Columbia University, where he meets with a brilliant young psychotherapy professor named Dr. Paul Davis (Paolo Malco) for help in creating a profile of the killer.\n\nThat night in New York's red-light district, Jane Lodge (Alexandra Delli Colli), attends a live sex show and records the simulated moans and groans of the two performers with a pocket tape recorder. A scruffy, dangerous-looking man (Howard Ross), with two fingers missing from his right hand sits nearby and observes what she is doing. After the show has ended, the female performer (Zora Kerova) retires backstage to her dressing room only to find it totally dark. Hearing a noise, she opens a closet door and is brutally attacked and killed by the maniac. Later that night, at the home of Kitty (Daniela Doria), a prostitute regularly visited by Williams, he receives a taunting phone call from the duck-voiced killer saying that he has killed again.\n\nThe next day, Jane shows her latest tape recording to her husband, Dr. Lodge (Laurence Welles), who has agreed to support their open-marriage. Jane goes to a bar in a rough neighborhood where she's approached by two Hispanic bar punks (Antone Pagán) and (Josh Cruze) who proceed to fondle and sexually humiliate her. The emotionally troubled Jane runs out and drives away.\n\nThat night, Fay Majors (Almanta Keller), a young woman, is riding alone on a late-night subway train when she gets menaced by the man from the live sex theater. She runs off the train, through the deserted subway station, and onto the street where she gets attacked in a dark alley by the quacking maniac, who stabs her in the leg and slashes her hands and arms as she tries to defend herself. Limping away, Fay stumbles through a doorway into an apartment building. She locks the door behind her, then passes out from the loss of blood. Reality and illusion blur: Fay is sitting alone in a dark movie theater watching cartoons when she attacked and killed by a handsome young man who slashes her neck with a straight razor. Fay wakes up in the hospital the morning after when the same man visits her in her room. He is revealed to be her physicist boyfriend, Peter Bunch (Andrew Painter).\n\nLater Williams and Dr. Davis visit Fay, and she tells them her attacker was missing two fingers from his right hand. Williams and Davis both conclude that this is the killer since all forensic evidence points to the killer being left-handed.\n\nSomewhere in night-time New York, the owner of the mutilated right hand picks up Jane and takes her to a sleazy hotel room for bondage sex. The S&M game she had willingly begun soon turns nasty, and he begins to beat her. Then the man turns up the radio while it plays Berto Pisano's \"Tic nervoso\" and makes a muttered phone-call, describing the bound woman to someone on the other line as \"she's right up your perverted alley.\" A little later, while the man sleeps, Jane overhears a radio DJ describing the killer, whom the press has now dubbed, 'the New York Ripper,' as missing two fingers from his right hand. Jane quietly unties herself and flees into the hotel hallway, only to be killed by the real New York Ripper, who guts her, and stabs her to death just as she tries to make for the exit.\n\nWilliams arrives at the scene when the police find Jane's tape recordings of the sex shows and of her 'master.' Learning from witnesses, Williams discovers that the identity of the 8-fingered man is Mickey Scellenda - a Greek immigrant with a history of sexual assault and drug abuse. Williams and the police step up the search for Scellenda after raiding his apartment, finding photographs of most of the Ripper victims and huge stashes of pornography and drug paraphernalia. Williams also pays a visit to Dr. Lodge to inform him of his wife's murder. Dr. Lodge tearfully defends his open marriage, which gets him a sneering response from the moralistic Williams.\n\nMeanwhile, Dr. Davis begins to express doubt to the killer's identity, as Scellenda is only a petty criminal, not matching the high intelligence that Davis had established in profiling the Ripper. Davis then buys a gay porn magazine at a local newsstand (revealing his repressed homosexuality) and pays a visit to Peter and Fay at their house to ask them more questions about Fay's experience. Something about their story arouses his suspicion. That evening, after Peter goes out, Fay is attacked in their house by Scellenda, who breaks in trying to kill her. She is saved when Peter returns, and the man flees.\n\nA few days later, Williams gets another taunting phone call from the New York Ripper, who wants to \"dedicate a murder\" to him. Williams and the police put a trace on the line and race to the location, only to find that the killer has set up a two-way radio to a remote phone booth, while he is presently in the home of Kitty, the young prostitute favored by Williams, torturing her. Williams races to Kitty's apartment, but is too late as the killer has fled, leaving behind Kitty's maimed corpse to be discovered.\n\nSometime later, the dead body of Mickey Scellenda is found having committed suicide. When Dr. Barry Jones informs Williams that Scellenda was dead for the last eight days, four days before Kitty's murder, Williams realizes that they have been tailing the wrong man. He relays this to Professor Davis, who is both delighted and disappointed with the news. Davis explains that with Scellenda eliminated as a suspect, his original idea to the killer's identity is confirmed; a misogynist psychopath who used Scellenda to throw the police off his trail.\n\nFay is shown visiting a hospital where Peter has a child from a previous marriage, a little girl named Susy, who is dying from a rare bone disorder. Visiting the hospital, Williams and Davis observe Susy in her hospital bed and decide to race over to Peter and Fay's place to arrest both of them. At the house, one of them gets a phone call from a duck-voiced person, while the other one overhears. While Peter goes into the kitchen for dinner, Fay has disappeared. Going upstairs to Susy's bedroom, Fay jumps out of the darkness at Peter while stabbing him with a kitchen knife. Peter rises, quacking like a duck, and struggles with Fay in which they both tumble down the stairs. Just as Peter grabs the knife away from Fay and is about to stab her, Williams runs in and literally blasts Peter's face off with his gun. In the ambulance, Davis explains to Fay her deranged boyfriend's motivation for killing. His hatred of sexually active women stemmed from bitterness at the cruel blow fate had dealt his young daughter, who will never enjoy the freedoms of his victims. After leaving the scene, the phone in the now-deserted house rings again. In her hospital bed, Susy is calling out for her father, pleading to him to answer her call, as her voice is drowned out beneath the indifferent traffic of the city.\n\n\nPrior to the release of the film, Fulci discussed the production, describing it as \"much less horror than my previous films, no zombies, but a human killer working in the dark.\" Fulci described the film as a tribute to Alfred Hitchcock, billing it as \"Hitchcock Revisited, a fantastic film with a plot, violence and sexuality.\" Dardano Sacchetti, who was one of Fulci's key creative collaborators at the time, stated that much of the film's sexual content came from Fulci, claiming that Fulci \"nurtures a profound sadism towards women.\" The film was shot on location in New York with interiors filmed in Rome.\n\nThe lead heroine role had originally been offered to British actress Catriona MacColl who had starred in Fulci's, \"City of the Living Dead\" (1980), \"The Beyond\" (1981) and \"House by the Cemetery\" (1981), but she turned it down and the role went to Almanta Suska.\n\nZora Kerova, who played Eva in the film, spoke positively about working with Fulci and stated that it took a while for Fulci to warm up to her. When asked what she thought of the film, she stated she \"didn't like \"The New York Ripper\" at all.\"\n\n\"The New York Ripper\" was released on 4 March 1982 in Italy.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the film was screened for the BBFC, with Carol Tpolski describing the film as \"simply the most damaging film I have ever seen in my whole life\" and \"a relentless catalogue of the eponymous antihero/villain cutting women up.\" The film was banned in the United Kingdom, where it could not be sold or owned until 2002.\n\nThe film received a limited theatrical release in the United States in 1984 and was released on VHS in 1987, where it was slightly edited by Vidmark Entertainment.\n\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 17% based on , with a weighted average rating of 3/10.\n\nEric Henderson of Slant Magazine called the film \"sour and pointless,\" adding that it \"utilizes all the necessary ingredients but fails to summon from them the magisterial dignity one expects from the finer NYC vomitoriums.\" On his website, \"Fantastic Movie Musings and Ramblings\", Dave Sindelar criticized the film's cliched plot, obvious identity of the killer and attempts at pathos, the latter of which he felt were \"forced and ineffectual.\" In the end, Sindelar stated that the film's nastiness and gore were its primary appeal, while also noting that it \"will certainly not be to everyone’s taste.\" Maitland McDonagh from TV Guide gave the film 1/4 stars, writing, \"Fulci alternates sleazy sex scenes with graphic and deeply misogynistic murders, fills the plots with twists that make no sense, then wraps the whole thing up in a preposterous psychological flourish.\"\nRobert Firsching of AllMovie claimed that the film was Fulci \"pandering to the lowest common denominator as never before in his career\". He added that \"Fulci showed with this blatant play for the sicko slasher crowd that the days of well-plotted, stylish Italian horror were gone, replaced with the most vicious sort of sexual violence and perversion\", concluding that the film was a \"shameful piece of work\".\n\n"}

He joined the Society of Jesus in 1967, and is a member of the Jesuits' Midwest Province. Leahy earned a bachelor's degree in philosophy and a master's degree in United States history at Saint Louis University in 1972 and 1975, respectively. He then began studies at the Jesuit School of Theology at Berkeley in Berkeley, California, where he earned degrees in theology (1978) and historical theology (1980). He was ordained a priest in 1978. He received a doctoral degree in U.S. history from Stanford University in 1986.\n\nHe began his academic career as a teacher at Campion High School in Wisconsin from 1973 to 1975. He served as a teaching assistant at Stanford in 1981 before joining the Marquette University faculty as an instructor of history in 1985. He became an associate professor with tenure in 1991, and in that same year became Marquette's executive vice president.\n\nLeahy's memberships include the American Catholic Historical Association, the American Historical Association, the History of Education Society, and the Organization of American Historians.\n\nSince becoming Boston College president, Leahy has accelerated the growth and development of the university initiated by his predecessor J. Donald Monan. Boston College's endowment has continued to increase rapidly to more than $2 billion, making BC one of the 50 wealthiest universities in the nation. During the years after the global recession of 2008, Leahy's effective fiscal governance has enabled BC to emerge in a position of strength. BC had the fastest-growing endowment of many high-ranking universities. During Leahy's presidency, the campus has expanded by almost 150 acres (607,000 m²), and undergraduate applications have surpassed 30,000. At the same time, its students, faculty and athletic teams have seen unprecedented success — winning record numbers of Truman, Marshall, Fulbright, Rhodes scholarships as well as other academic awards and research grants.\n\nIn 2006, after a two-year self-study involving more than 200 BC faculty, administrators, students and alumni, Leahy announced a $1.6-billion strategic plan that called for hiring 100 new faculty, adding a dozen new academic centers and spending $1 billion in construction and renovation projects to elevate Boston College to the highest echelon of premier national universities. The Plan set seven strategic directions for the University: To become a national leader in liberal arts education and student formation; to enhance its research initiatives in select natural sciences and in areas that address urgent social problems; to support leadership initiatives in BC's graduate and professional schools; to expand international programs and partnerships. Leahy's stated goal was to establish Boston College as \"the world's leading Catholic university.\"\n\nIn line with this direction, the Weston Jesuit School of Theology re-affiliated with Boston College in 2008 to form the new School of Theology and Ministry. During the same year, Leahy started the construction of Stokes Hall, a administrative and classroom building for BC's humanities departments, which opened in 2012. Already in 2002, Leahy initiated the Church in the 21st Century program to examine issues facing the Roman Catholic Church in light of the clergy sexual abuse scandal.\n\nIn athletics, Boston College won conference and national titles during Leahy's presidency: for example four national men's ice hockey championships. In 2005, it left the Big East Conference and joined the Atlantic Coast Conference.\n\n\nLeahy has written a number of articles on Catholic higher education in the United States, including, among others:\nIn addition, Leahy has authored numerous articles in the Dictionary of Christianity in America and book reviews in History, Journal of American History and History of Education Quarterly.\n"}

The dealer's advantages are in having an extra card and the fact that if the player folds, he will lose his ante, even if his hand turns out to be better than the dealer's.\n\nAfter seeing their cards and the dealer's face up card, the player can opt to fold the ante bet, in which case the player loses it, or play by betting 1-3 times their ante. Unlike Three Card Poker and some other games, the dealer always qualifies (plays). If the player ties or beats the dealer, the player is paid the amount bet. A bonus is paid if the player has a three of a kind (2-1 for the original ante bet only), straight flush (20-1), or four of a kind (25-1). This bonus is paid out even if the dealer's hand is better than the player's; however, in this situation, the player would still lose their ante and play bets. \n\nThe Aces Up bet depends solely on the player's hand. If the player has a pair of aces or better, they win, otherwise they lose. The dealer's hand is immaterial. The payout for a win can range from 1-1 for a pair of aces to 50-1 for four of a kind, the best possible hand. Various payout variations are possible, depending on the casino, resulting in a house edge ranging from 1.98% to 6.15%.\n\nThe possible four-card hands are (from best to worst): \n\n"}

The stated aim being to \"create heavy guitar-based original Black Metal with Medieval/Eastern influences and a lyrical concept derived from Christ's mortality, Biblical Apocrypha, Fallen Angels and Death.\" Their demo releases \"The Bemoaning of Metatron\" and \"Metatron and the Red Gleaming Serpent\" gained them a good deal of critical attention in the underground metal press, even receiving mentions from such mainstream sources as \"Kerrang!\" magazine, and they soon signed to Supernal Music after the release of their widely acclaimed final demo \"The Watchers of Catal Huyuk\". Their albums, particularly 2001's \"The Excommunication of Christ\" explore conceptual themes based around an anti-Christian interpretation of the Bible and Apocrypha. Despite a fluctuating line-up, the band continues to release well-received music.\n\nOne of the band's most consistent features is their use of guest musicians. Over the years they have had a large roster of guests including members of Hawkwind, Sigh, Amebix, Mael Mordha, Taake, and an actual Rabbi.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He gained some knowledge of practical mathematics and navigation, and at thirteen was apprenticed on board a vessel which traded between Liverpool and North America. After having made several voyages across the Atlantic Ocean, he was impressed for the navy, in which he soon rose to the rank of midshipman. During the Napoleonic Wars he saw a good deal of active service, and at the storming of Port Louis, Mauritius, in November 1810, he was first in the breach and hauled down the French flag.\n\nIn 1814 Clapperton went to Canada, was promoted to the rank of lieutenant, and to the command of a schooner on the Canadian lakes. In 1817, when the flotilla on the lakes was dismantled, he returned home on half-pay. In 1820 Clapperton removed to Edinburgh, where he made the acquaintance of Walter Oudney, who aroused his interest in African travel.\n\nLieutenant G. F. Lyon having returned from an unsuccessful attempt to reach Bornu from Tripoli, the British government determined on a second expedition to that country. Walter Oudney was appointed by Lord Bathurst, then colonial secretary, to proceed to Bornu as consul, accompanied by Hugh Clapperton. From Tripoli, early in 1822, they set out southward to Murzuk, where they were later joined by Major Dixon Denham, who found both men in a wretched condition. They eventually proceeded south from Murzuk on 29 November 1822. By this time, a deep antipathy had developed between Clapperton and Denham, Denham secretly sending home malicious reports about Clapperton having homosexual relations with one of the Arab servants. The accusation, based on a rumour spread by a disgruntled servant dismissed by Clapperton for theft, was almost certainly unfounded, and Denham later withdrew it but without telling Clapperton he had done so, leading the historian Bovill to observe that 'it remains difficult to recall in all the checkered (sic) history of geographic discovery... a more odious man than Dixon Denham'.\nOn 17 February 1823, the party eventually reached Kuka (now Kukawa in Nigeria), capital of the Bornu Empire, where they were well received by the sultan Sheikh al-Kaneimi, having earlier become the first white men to see Lake Chad. Whilst at Kuka, Clapperton and Oudney parted company with Denham on 14 December to explore the course of the Niger River. Denham remained behind to explore and survey the western, south and south-eastern shores of Lake Chad, and the lower courses of the rivers Waube, Logone and Shari. However, only a few weeks later, Oudney died at the village of Murmur, located near the town of Katagum on the road to Kano. Undeterred, Clapperton continued his journey alone through Kano to Sokoto, the capital of the Fulani Empire, where by order of Sultan Muhammed Bello he was obliged to stop, though the Niger was only a five-day journey to the west. Exhausted by his travels, he returned by way of Zaria and Katsina to Kuka, where Denham found him barely recognizable after his privations. Clapperton and Denham departed Kuka for Tripoli in August 1824, reaching Tripoli on 26 January 1825. Their mutual antipathy unabated, they exchanged not a word during the 133-day journey. The pair continued their journey to England, arriving home to a heroes' welcome on 1 June 1825. An account of their travels was published in 1826 under the title \"Narrative of Travels and Discoveries in Northern and Central Africa in the years 1822–1823 and 1824\".\n\nImmediately after his return to England, Clapperton was raised to the rank of commander, and sent out with another expedition to Africa, the sultan Bello of Sokoto having professed his eagerness to open up trade with the west coast. Clapperton came out on HMS \"Brazen\", which was joining the West Africa Squadron for the suppression of the slave trade. He landed at Badagry in the Bight of Benin, and started overland for the Niger on 7 December 1825, having with him his servant Richard Lemon Lander, Captain Pearce, and Dr. Morrison, navy surgeon and naturalist. Before the month was out Pearce and Morrison were dead of fever. Clapperton continued his journey, and, passing through the Yoruba country, in January 1826 he crossed the Niger at Bussa, the spot where Mungo Park had died twenty years before.\n\nIn July, Clapperton arrived at Kano and thence the Fulani capital Sokoto, intending to continue to Bornu and renew his acquaintance with the Kanuri leader Sheikh al-Kaneimi. However, the Fulani were now at war with al-Kaneimi, and Sultan Bello refused him permission to leave. After many months' detention, afflicted by malaria, depression, and dysentery, Clapperton died, leaving his servant Lander the only survivor of the expedition. Lander returned to the coast, and at Fernando Po by extraordinary coincidence met Clapperton's old antagonist, Dixon Denham, who duly relayed the news of Clapperton's demise to London.\n\nClapperton was the first European to make known from personal observation the Hausa states, which he visited soon after the establishment of the Sokoto Caliphate by the Fula. In 1829 the \"Journal of a Second Expedition into the Interior of Africa, &c.\", by Clapperton appeared posthumously, with a biographical sketch of the explorer by his uncle, Lieutenant-Colonel S. Clapperton, as a preface. Richard Lander, who had brought back the journal of his master, also published \"Records of Captain Clapperton's Last Expedition to Africa ... with the subsequent Adventures of the Author\" (2 volumes, London, 1830).\n\nHugh Clapperton was painted in c 1817 by Sir Henry Raeburn, the painting now residing in the United States. A later oil painting by Gildon Manton is held by The National Gallery of Scotland\nThe frontispiece to Clapperton's \"Narrative of Travels and Discoveries in Northern and Central Africa\" features an engraving by Thomas Goff Lupton\n\n"}

Founded in 1997, HTC began as an original design manufacturer and original equipment manufacturer, designing and manufacturing laptop computers.\n\nAfter initially making smartphones based mostly on Windows Mobile, HTC became a co-founding member of the Open Handset Alliance, a group of handset manufacturers and mobile network operators dedicated to the development of the Android mobile operating system. The HTC Dream, marketed by T-Mobile in many countries as the T-Mobile G1, was the first phone on the market to run Android.\n\nAlthough initially successful as a smartphone vendor, competition from Apple Inc. and Samsung Electronics, among others, diluted its market share, which reached just 7.2% by April 2015, and the company has experienced consecutive net losses. In 2016, HTC began to diversify its business beyond smartphones, having partnered with Valve to produce a virtual reality platform known as HTC Vive. After having collaborated with Google on its Pixel smartphone, HTC sold roughly half of its design and research talent, as well as non-exclusive rights to smartphone-related intellectual property, to Google in 2017 for billion.\n\nCher Wang (王雪紅) and H. T. Cho (卓火土) founded HTC in 1997. Initially a manufacturer of notebook computers, HTC began designing some of the world's first touch and wireless hand-held devices in 1998.\n\nHTC started making Windows Mobile PDAs and smartphones starting from 2004 under the Qtek brand. In 2006 the range was rebranded as HTC with the launch of the HTC TyTN.\n\nIn 2007, HTC acquired the mobile device company Dopod International.\n\nIn 2008, HTC unveiled the HTC Max 4G, the first GSM mobile phone to support WiMAX networks.\n\nHTC joined Google's Open Handset Alliance and then developed and released the first device powered by Android in 2008, the HTC Dream.\n\nIn November 2009 HTC released the HTC HD2, the first Windows Mobile device with a capacitive touchscreen. The same year, HTC Sense debuted as a user interface which continues to be used as of 2018.\n\nIn July 2010, HTC announced it would begin selling HTC-branded smartphones in China in a partnership with China Mobile. In October 2010, HTC launched the brand tagline \"quietly brilliant\"', and the YOU campaign, HTC's first global advertising campaign. The same month, the HTC HD7 was released as one of the launch models of Microsoft's revitalised Windows Phone. In 2010, HTC sold over 24.6 million handsets, up 111% over 2009.\n\nAt the Mobile World Congress in February 2011, the GSM Association named HTC the \"Device Manufacturer of the Year\" in its Global Mobile Awards. In April 2011, HTC surpassed Nokia as the third-largest smartphone manufacturer by market share, behind Apple and Samsung.\n\nOn 6 July 2011, it was announced that HTC would buy VIA Technologies' stake in S3 Graphics. On 6 August 2011, HTC acquired Dashwire for $18.5M. In August 2011, HTC confirmed a plan for a strategic partnership with Beats Electronics involving acquiring 51 percent of the company.\n\nThe 2011 Best Global Brands rankings released by Interbrand, listed HTC at #98 and valued it at $3.6 billion. Based on researcher Canalys, in Q3 2011 HTC Corporation became the largest smartphone vendor in the U.S. with 24 percent market share, ahead of Samsung's 21 percent, Apple's 20 percent and BlackBerry's 9 percent. HTC Corporation made different models for each operator.\n\nDuring early 2012, HTC lost much of this U.S. market share due to increased competition from Apple and Samsung. According to analyst firm comScore, HTC only accounted for 9.3% of the United States smartphone market as of February 2013. In light of the company's decrease in prominence, Chief Executive Peter Chou had informed executives that he would step down if the company's newest flagship phone, the 2013 HTC One, had failed to generate impressive sales results. HTC's first quarter results for 2013 showed its year-over-year profit drop by 98.1%, making it the smallest-ever profit for the company—the delay of the launch of the HTC One was cited as one of the factors. In June 2012, HTC moved its headquarters from Taoyuan City (now Taoyuan District) to Xindian District, New Taipei City. On 14 January 2013, HTC launched its smartphones in Burma.\n\nThe HTC One was released in mid-2013 and, subsequently won various industry awards in the best smartphone and best design categories, but global sales of the HTC One were lower than those for Samsung's Galaxy S4 flagship handset and HTC recorded its first ever quarterly loss in early October 2013: a deficit of just under NT$3 billion (about US$100m, £62m). Marketing problems were identified by HTC as the primary reason for its comparative performance, a factor that had been previously cited by the company.\n\nDuring 2013, Microsoft were in negotiations to purchase HTC. This was only revealed in 2018 by Risto Siilasmaa, chairman of Nokia, in an interview with the \"Helsingin Sanomat\". Microsoft would eventually purchase Nokia's mobile phone business that year.\n\nIn August 2013, HTC debuted a new \"Here's To Change\" global marketing campaign featuring actor Robert Downey, Jr., who signed a two-year contract to be HTC's new \"Instigator of Change.\". On 27 September 2013, HTC announced that it would sell back its stake in Beats Electronics\n\nFollowing the release of the HTC One, two variants were released to form a trio for the 2013 HTC One lineup. A smaller variant named the HTC One Mini was released in August 2013, and a larger variant named the HTC One Max was released in October 2013. Similar in design and features to the HTC One, the upgraded aspects of the One Max include a display measuring , a fingerprint sensor and a removable back cover for expandable memory. The product was released into the European and Asian retail environment in October 2013, followed by a US launch in early November 2013.\n\nIn March 2014, HTC released the HTC One (M8), the next version of the HTC One flagship, at press conferences in London and New York City. In a change from previous launches, the HTC One was made available for purchase on the company website and North American mobile carrier websites on the same day a few hours after the launch.\n\nIn April 2014, HTC reported sales climbing 12.7 percent to NT$22.1 billion, the company's fastest growth since October 2011. In September 2014, Google selected HTC to make its Nexus 9 tablet. In August 2014 HTC announced a Windows Phone-powered variant of the One (M8), their first using the operating system since 2012. HTC ended its long relationship with Microsoft afterwards due to Nokia's dominance in Windows Phone devices, and started focusing solely on Android.\n\nOn 1 March 2015, HTC unveiled Vive, a virtual reality head-mounted display in collaboration with Valve. In June and October 2015, HTC reported net losses; the company has faced increased competition from other smartphone makers, including Apple, Samsung, and others, which had resulted in a decline in its smartphone sales, as well a major loss of market share. Its smartphone market share had risen back to 7.2 percent in April 2015 due to its strong sales of recent devices, but HTC's stock price had fallen by 90 percent since 2011.\n\nIn November 2016, HTC reported that it had sold at least 140,000 Vive units, and that each unit was being sold at a profit. In January 2017, HTC unveiled its new U series smartphone line, the U Play and U Ultra; the company described the U series as a \"new direction\" for its phones, emphasizing an integrated virtual assistant developed by the company. In February 2017, HTC reported that in the fourth quarter of 2016, its operating losses had decreased by 13% year-over-year, citing \"robust sales performance\" and sequential revenue increases throughout the year.\n\nOn 21 September 2017, Google announced that it would acquire roughly half of the 4,000 employees who worked in HTC's design and research staff, and non-exclusive licences to smartphone-related intellectual property held by HTC, for US$1.1 billion. The employees included the team involved with Google's Pixel smartphone, which was manufactured by HTC. Google stated that the purchase was part of its efforts to bolster its first-party hardware business. The transaction was completed on 30 January 2018; while HTC will continue to produce its own smartphones, the company has stated that it planned to increase its focus on Internet of Things (IoT) and virtual reality going forward.\n\nOn 26 March 2018, HTC reported a quarterly net loss of US$337 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, citing \"market competition, product mix, pricing, and recognized inventory write-downs\". The company's transaction with Google will be reflected in its first quarter 2018 numbers. HTC stated that it would use the revenue to further its investments in \"emerging technologies\". The company had also cited its increasing VR investments, including its upcoming Vive Pro model, and Vive Focus—a standalone \"all-in-one\" VR headset unveiled in November 2017.\n\nIn July 2018 HTC has revealed that it has entered into a partnership with games and apps developer and publisher Animoca. This includes product development and joint collaboration in areas such as games, blockchain, artificial intelligence, machine learning, augmented reality and virtual reality. Animoca's games will be pre-installed on HTC devices in the future.\n\nOn 5 February 2019 HTC released its first \"Cryptophone\", focused on providing universal finance through Bitcoin and creating a portal towards realizing a truly decentralized web.\n\nOn 11 May 2019 HTC announced that its Cryptophone will be the first smartphone to support a bitcoin full node.\n\nOn 17 September 2019 HTC appointed Yves Maitre, former executive vice president of consumer equipment and partnerships of Orange, as CEO where Cher Wang will continue her role as chairwoman.\n\nIn March 2010, Apple Inc. filed a complaint with the US International Trade Commission claiming infringement of 20 of its patents covering aspects of the iPhone user interface and hardware. HTC disagreed with Apple's actions and reiterated its commitment to creating innovative smartphones. HTC also filed a complaint against Apple for infringing on five of its patents and sought to ban the import of Apple products into the US from manufacturing facilities in Asia. Apple expanded its original complaint by adding two more patents.\n\nOn 10 November 2012, Apple and HTC reached a 10-year license-agreement covering current and future patents held by the two companies. The terms of the agreement remain confidential.\n\nPreviously, Apple ignored HTC's long held rights over the trade name Touch by calling its new iPod range the same.\n\nIn February 2013, HTC settled with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission concerning lax security on more than 18 million smartphones and tablets it had shipped to customers and agreed to security patches.\n\nHTC's chairwoman and acting CEO is Cher Wang who is the daughter of the late Wang Yung-ching, founder of the plastics and petrochemicals conglomerate Formosa Plastics Group. Peter Chou serves as head of the HTC Future Development Lab, and HT Cho as Director of the Board and Chairman of HTC Foundation. HTC's CFO is Hui-Ming Cheng. In addition to being chair of HTC, Cher Wang is also acting chair of VIA Technologies. HTC's main divisions, including the IA (Information Appliance) engineering division and the WM (Wireless Mobile) engineering division, are ISO 9001/ISO 14001-qualified facilities.\n\nThe company's growth has accelerated dramatically since being chosen by Microsoft as a hardware platform development partner for the Windows Mobile operating system (based on Windows CE). HTC also works with Google to build mobile phones running Google's Android mobile OS such as the Nexus One. HTC's sales revenue totalled $2.2 billion for 2005, a 102% increase from the prior year. In 2005 it was listed as the fastest-growing tech company in \"BusinessWeek\"s Info Tech 100.\n\nHTC invested strongly in research and development, which accounts for a quarter of its employees. The company's North American headquarters are located in Bellevue, Washington. HTC runs a software design office in Seattle (near its North American headquarters) where it designs its own interface for its phones. In 2011, HTC also opened a research and development office in Durham, North Carolina, a location the company chose over Seattle and Atlanta, to focus on multiple areas of wireless technology.\n\nOn 17 February 2010, \"Fast Company\" ranked HTC as the 31st most innovative company in the world. On 27 May 2011, in response to customer feedback, HTC announced that they will no longer lock the bootloaders on their Android based phones.\n\nHTC sponsored the HTC-Highroad professional cycling team from 2009 to 2011.\n\nIn 2012, HTC became the official smartphone sponsor of the UEFA Champions League and UEFA Europa League. The contract will last for three years and makes HTC one of the main sponsors of the two competitions.\nHTC also became the shirt sponsors for the Indian Super League franchise NorthEast United FC for the 2014, 2015 and 2016 season.\n\nAhead of the 2015 season, Indian Premier League franchise Kings XI Punjab signed a sponsorship deal with HTC. According to the agreement, HTC would be the team's official principal sponsor, and the company's logo would occupy the right chest position on the Kings XI Punjab playing jersey.\n\nHTC sponsors professional eSports teams FaZe Clan, Team SoloMid, Cloud9, Team Liquid, and J Team, (formerly known as Taipei Assassins).\n\nHTC sponsored a \"Super Smash Bros. Melee\" tournament, HTC Throwdown, which was held on 19 September 2015, in San Francisco. At the end of 2015, the company also sponsored the creation of that year's SSBMRank, the annual rankings of the best \"Melee\" players in the world.\n\n"}

It was released on Polydor Records on 26 January 1998, then reissued on Pond Life on 13 March 2000. In 2003, the album was released in LP format on Universal Records. Its sound is noted for being extremely sparse and minimal; AllMusic called it \"quite possibly the most quiet and intimate record ever made\". Hollis found inspiration not in the popular music of the day, but rather in 20th-century classical music and jazz from the late fifties and sixties. The album did not mark a return for Hollis to the music industry or live performance; he stated at the time of the album's release that \"There won't be any gig, not even at home in the living room. This material isn't suited to play live.\"\n\nThe album was recorded as part of a two-album contract with Polydor, along with Talk Talk's 1991 \"Laughing Stock\". At one point, the record was to be entitled \"Mountains of the Moon\" and released under the Talk Talk name, but eventually it was decided it should be a self-titled solo project (early promotional CD-Rs and cassettes of the album contain the original details, with the CD-R retaining the attribution to Talk Talk). Engineer Phill Brown, who also recorded \"Laughing Stock\", stated that, compared to the final Talk Talk album, which he considered \"one of [his] best projects\" but \"dark and claustrophobic\", he found the solo release \"the opposite…- open, restful and at times fantastically beautiful\".\n\nOn 11 October 2011, Ba Da Bing Records released \"Mark Hollis\" on vinyl. This marks the first time that the album has been issued on vinyl in the US. A reissue of the album was released on 18 October 2019 through UMC/Polydor.\n\nThe cover photo, taken by Stephen Lovell-Davis, is of southern Italy Easter bread designed to resemble the lamb of god. Hollis stated about the image, \"I like the way something appears to come out of his head; it makes me think of a fountain of ideas. Also the manner how the eyes are positioned fascinates me. When I saw the picture for the first time I had to laugh, but there's something very tragic about it at the same time.\"\n\n\"\"A Life (1895 1915)\"\", which has been referred to as \"the album's epic centrepiece\" refers to Roland Leighton (1895–1915), a British soldier and poet who was the fiancé of Vera Brittain at the time of his death in World War I. Hollis has stated about the song, \"That was someone born before the turn of the century…and dying within one year of the First World War at a young age. It was based on Vera Brittain's boyfriend. It's the expectation that must have been in existence at the turn of the century, the patriotism that must've existed at the start of the war and the disillusionment that must've come immediately afterwards. It's the very severe mood swings that fascinated me.\" The song correspondingly contains a variety of styles, tempi, and instrumentations.\n\n\n\n"}

The CCD was a member of the European People's Party (EPP).\n\nThe CCD was founded in January 1994 by members of Christian Democracy (DC) who opposed the party's transformation into the Italian People's Party (PPI), and advocated an alliance with Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia (FI), which was launched on the same day, while the PPI advocated a centrist alliance with the Segni Pact called Pact for Italy. Its leaders were Pier Ferdinando Casini and Clemente Mastella. The CCD represented the right-wing of the defunct DC, while the PPI was largely the heir of the party's left-wing, especially after the split of the United Christian Democrats (CDU) from the PPI in 1995.\n\nIn accordance with an agreement between the party presidents of CCD and PPI, the CCD \"inherited\" 15 percent of the DC's assets, while the PPI was awarded the remainder. In the 1994 general election the CCD joined FI as a member of the Pole of Freedoms in Northern Italy and the Pole of Good Government in Southern Italy, forming a joint list with FI, and gaining 27 deputies and 12 senators. After the election the CCD joined the Berlusconi I Cabinet, with Mastella minister of Labour and Francesco D'Onofrio minister of Education.\n\nAfter the sudden fall of the government in December 1994, caused by Lega Nord's exit, a new general election took place in 1996. The CCD formed a joint list with the CDU. The alliance proved successful, gaining 5.8% of the vote, 30 deputies and 15 senators. However, as the centre-right lost the election to The Olive Tree centre-left coalition, the party was in opposition.\n\nIn 1998 Mastella and several MPs left the party to form, along with the CDU, the Christian Democrats for the Republic (CDR), which was later folded into the Democratic Union for the Republic (UDR) and supported the centre-left government led by Massimo D'Alema. In 1999 the UDR was transformed into the Union of Democrats for Europe (UDEUR), while the CDU was re-organised as an independent party and returned to the alliance with the CCD.\n\nOnce again, the CCD and the CDU formed a joint list (the so-called White Flower) for the 2001 general election, this time gaining only 3.2% of the vote, as part of the winning House of Freedoms coalition composed mainly of FI, National Alliance and Lega Nord. Casini was elected President of the Chamber of Deputies, while Carlo Giovanardi was appointed minister of Relations with Parliament in Berlusconi II Cabinet. In 2002 the CCD, the CDU and European Democracy (DE), which had won 2.3% in 2001, gave birth to the Union of Christian and Centre Democrats (UDC).\n"}
{"id": "1963413", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1963413", "title": "Second Battle of Corinth", "text": "Second Battle of Corinth\n\nThe second Battle of Corinth (which, in the context of the American Civil War, is usually referred to as the Battle of Corinth, to differentiate it from the siege of Corinth earlier the same year) was fought October 3–4, 1862, in Corinth, Mississippi. For the second time in the Iuka-Corinth Campaign, Union Maj. Gen. William Rosecrans defeated a Confederate army, this time one under Maj. Gen. Earl Van Dorn.\n\nAfter the Battle of Iuka, Maj. Gen. Sterling Price marched his army to meet with Van Dorn's. The combined force, known as the Army of West Tennessee, was put under the command of the more senior Van Dorn. The army moved in the direction of Corinth, a critical rail junction in northern Mississippi, hoping to disrupt Union lines of communications and then sweep into Middle Tennessee. The fighting began on October 3 as the Confederates pushed the U.S. Army from the rifle pits originally constructed by the Confederates for the siege of Corinth. The Confederates exploited a gap in the Union line and continued to press the Union troops until they fell back to an inner line of fortifications.\n\nOn the second day of battle, the Confederates moved forward to meet heavy Union artillery fire, storming Battery Powell and Battery Robinett, where desperate hand-to-hand fighting occurred. A brief incursion into the town of Corinth was repulsed. After a U.S. counterattack recaptured Battery Powell, Van Dorn ordered a general retreat. Rosecrans did not pursue immediately and the Confederates escaped destruction.\n\nAs Confederate General Braxton Bragg moved north from Tennessee into Kentucky in September 1862, Union Maj. Gen. Don Carlos Buell pursued him from Nashville with his Army of the Ohio. Confederate forces under Van Dorn and Price in northern Mississippi were expected to advance into Middle Tennessee to support Bragg's effort, but the Confederates also needed to prevent Buell from being reinforced by Maj. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant's Army of the Tennessee. Since the conclusion of the siege of Corinth that summer, Grant's army had been engaged in protecting supply lines in western Tennessee and northern Mississippi. At the Battle of Iuka on September 19, Maj. Gen. Sterling Price's Confederate Army of the West was defeated by forces under Grant's overall command, but tactically under Rosecrans, the commander of the Army of the Mississippi. (Grant's second column approaching Iuka, commanded by Maj. Gen. Edward Ord, did not participate in the battle as planned. An acoustic shadow apparently prevented Grant and Ord from hearing the sounds of the battle starting.) Price had hoped to combine his small army with Maj. Gen. Earl Van Dorn's Army of West Tennessee and disrupt Grant's communications, but Rosecrans struck first, causing Price to retreat from Iuka. Rosecrans's pursuit of Price was ineffectual.\n\nAfter Iuka, Grant established his headquarters at Jackson, Tennessee, a central location to communicate with his commands at Corinth and Memphis. Rosecrans returned to Corinth. Ord's three divisions of Grant's Army of the Tennessee moved to Bolivar, Tennessee, northwest of Corinth, to join with Maj. Gen. Stephen A. Hurlbut. Thus, Grant's forces in the immediate vicinity consisted of 12,000 men at Bolivar, Rosecrans's 23,000 at Corinth, Maj. Gen. William T. Sherman's 7,000 at Memphis, and another 6,000 as a general reserve at Jackson.\nPrice's army marched to Ripley where it joined Van Dorn on September 28. Van Dorn was the senior officer and took command of the combined force, numbering about 22,000 men. They marched on the Memphis and Charleston Railroad to Pocahontas, Tennessee, on October 1. From this point they had a number of opportunities for further moves and Grant was uncertain about their intentions. When they bivouacked on October 2 at Chewalla, Grant became certain that Corinth was the target. The Confederates hoped to seize Corinth from an unexpected direction, isolating Rosecrans from reinforcements, and then sweep into Middle Tennessee. Grant sent word to Rosecrans to be prepared for an attack, at the same time directing Hurlbut to keep an eye on the enemy and strike him on the flank if a favorable opportunity offered. Despite the warning from Grant, Rosecrans was not convinced that Corinth was necessarily the target of Van Dorn's advance. He believed that the Confederate commander would not be foolhardy enough to attack the fortified town and might well instead choose to strike the Mobile and Ohio railroad and maneuver the U.S. soldiers out of their position.\n\nAlong the north and east sides of Corinth, about two miles from the town, was a line of entrenchments, extending from the Chewalla Road on the northwest to the Mobile and Ohio Railroad on the south, that had been constructed by Confederate General P.G.T. Beauregard's army before it evacuated the town in May. These lines were too extensive for Rosecrans's 23,000 men to defend, so with the approval of Grant, Rosecrans modified the lines to emphasize the defense of the town and the ammunition magazines near the junction of the two railroads. The inner line of redoubts, closer to the town, called the Halleck Line, was much more substantial. A number of formidable named batteries, guns positioned in strong earthwork defenses, were part of the inner line: Batteries Robinett, Williams, Phillips, Tannrath, and Lothrop, in the area known as College Hill. They were connected by breastworks, and during the last four days of September these works had been strengthened, and the trees in the vicinity of the centrally placed Battery Robinett had been felled to form an abatis. Rosecrans's plan was to absorb the expected Confederate advance with a skirmish line at the old Confederate entrenchments and to then meet the bulk of the Confederate attack with his main force along the Halleck Line, about a mile from the center of town. His final stand would be made around the batteries on College Hill. His men were provided with three days' rations and 100 rounds of ammunition. Van Dorn was not aware of the strength of his opponent, who had prudently called in two reinforcing divisions from the Army of the Tennessee to deal with the difficulty of assaulting these prepared positions.\n\nRosecrans's Army of the Mississippi was organized as follows:\n\nVan Dorn's combined Confederate Army of West Tennessee was organized as follows:\n\nOn the morning of October 3, three of Rosecrans's divisions advanced into the old Confederate rifle pits north and northwest of town: McKean on the left, Davies in the center, and Hamilton on the right. Stanley's division was held in reserve south of town. Van Dorn began his assault at 10 a.m. with Lovell's division attacking McArthur's brigade (McKean's division, on the Union left) from three sides. Van Dorn's plan was a double envelopment, in which Lovell would open the fight, in the hope that Rosecrans would weaken his right to reinforce McKean, at which time Price would make the main assault against the U.S. right and enter the works. Lovell made a determined attack on Oliver and as soon as he became engaged Maury opened the fight with Davies's left. McArthur quickly moved four regiments to Oliver's support and at the same time Davies advanced his line to the entrenchments. These movements left a gap between Davies and McKean, through which the Confederates forced their way about 1:30 p.m., and the whole Union line fell back to within half a mile of the redoubts, leaving two pieces of artillery in the hands of the Confederates.\n\nDuring this part of the action Gen. Hackleman was killed and Gen. Oglesby (the future governor of Illinois) seriously wounded, shot through the lungs. About 3 p.m. Hamilton was ordered to change front and attack the Confederates on the left flank, but through a misunderstanding of the order and the unmasking of a force on Buford's front, so much time was lost that it was sunset before the division was in position for the movement, and it had to be abandoned. Van Dorn in his report says: \"One hour more of daylight and victory would have soothed our grief for the loss of the gallant dead who sleep on that lost but not dishonored field.\" But one hour more of daylight would have hurled Hamilton's as-yet unengaged brigades on the Confederate's left and rear, which would in all probability have driven Van Dorn from the field and made the second day's battle unnecessary.\n\nSo far the advantage had been with the Confederates. Rosecrans had been driven back at all points, and night found his entire army except pickets inside the redoubts. Both sides had been exhausted from the fighting. The weather had been hot (high of 94 °F) and water was scarce, causing many men to nearly faint from their exertions. During the night the Confederates slept within 600 yards of the Union works, and Van Dorn readjusted his lines for the attack the next day. He abandoned his sophisticated plans for double envelopments. Shelby Foote wrote, \"His blood was up; it was Rosecrans he was after, and he was after him in the harshest, most straightforward way imaginable. Today he would depend not on deception to complete the destruction begun the day before, but on the rapid point-blank fire of his guns and the naked valor of his infantry.\"\n\nRosecrans's biographer, William M. Lamers, reported that Rosecrans was confident at the end of the first day of battle, saying \"We've got them where we want them\" and that some of the general's associates claimed that he was in \"magnificent humor.\" Peter Cozzens, however, suggested that Rosecrans was \"tired and bewildered, certain only he was badly outnumbered—at least three to one by his reckoning.\" Steven E. Woodworth, a historian specializing in the Western Theater of the American Civil War, portrayed Rosecrans's conduct in a negative light:\n\nAt 4:30 a.m. on October 4, the Confederates opened up on the Union inner line of entrenchments with a six-gun battery, which kept up its bombardment until after sunrise. When the guns fell silent, the U.S. troops prepared themselves to resist an attack. But the attack was slow in coming. Van Dorn had directed Hébert to begin the engagement at daylight, and the artillery fire was merely preliminary to enable Hébert to get into position for the assault.\n\nAt 7 a.m., Hébert sent word to Van Dorn that he was too ill to lead his division, and Brig. Gen. Martin E. Green was ordered to assume command and advance at once. Nearly two hours more elapsed before Green moved to the attack, with four brigades in echelon, until he occupied a position in the woods north of town. There he formed in line, facing south, and made a charge on Battery Powell with the brigades of Gates and McLain (replacing Martin), while the brigades of Moore (replacing Green) and Colbert attacked Hamilton's line. The assault on the battery was successful, capturing the guns and scattering the troops from Illinois and Iowa. Hamilton repulsed the attack on his position and then sent a portion of his command to the assistance of Davies, who rallied his men, drove the Confederates out of the battery, and recaptured the guns.\n\nMaury had been engaged sometime before this. As soon as he heard the firing on his left, he knew that Davies and Hamilton would be kept too busy to interfere with his movements, and gave the order for his division to move straight toward the town. His right encountered a stubborn resistance at about 11 a.m. from Battery Robinett, a redan protected by a five-foot ditch, sporting three 20-pounder Parrott rifles commanded by Lt. Henry Robinett. Fierce hand-to-hand combat ensued, and Maury was forced to retire with heavy losses from arguably the hottest action of the two-day battle. Col. William P. Rogers of the 2nd Texas, a Mexican–American War comrade of President Jefferson Davis, was among those killed in the charge. Col. Lawrence Sullivan Ross of the 6th Texas was thrown from his horse and mistakenly reported killed with Rogers.\n\nPhifer's brigade on the left met with better success, driving back Davies's left flank and entering the town. But their triumph was short-lived, as part of Sullivan's brigade, held as a reserve on Hamilton's left, charged on the Confederates, who were thrown into confusion in the narrow streets, and as they fell back came within range of batteries on both flanks of the Union army, the cross-fire utterly routing them. Cabell's brigade of Maury's division was sent to reinforce the troops that had captured Battery Powell, but before it arrived, Davies and Hamilton had recaptured it, and as Cabell advanced against it, he was met by a murderous fire that caused his men to retreat.\n\nMeanwhile, Lovell had been skirmishing with the Union left in the vicinity of Battery Phillips, in preparation for a general advance. Before his arrangements were complete he was ordered to send a brigade to Maury's assistance, and soon afterward received orders to place his command so as to cover the retreat of the army. At 4 p.m., reinforcements from Grant under the command of Brig. Gen. James B. McPherson arrived from Jackson. But the battle of Corinth had effectively been over since 1 p.m. and the Confederates were in full retreat.\n\nRosecrans's army lost 2,520 (355 killed, 1,841 wounded, and 324 missing) at Corinth; Van Dorn's losses were 4,233 (473 killed, 1,997 wounded, and 1,763 captured or missing).\n\nOnce again, Rosecrans's performance during the second day of the battle has been the subject of dispute among historians. His biographer, Lamers, paints a romantic picture:\nPeter Cozzens, author of a recent book-length study of Iuka and Corinth, came to the opposite conclusion:\nRosecrans's performance immediately after the battle was lackluster. Grant had given him specific orders to pursue Van Dorn without delay, but he did not begin his march until the morning of October 5, explaining that his troops needed rest and the thicketed country made progress difficult by day and impossible by night. At 1 p.m. on October 4, when pursuit would have been most effective, Rosecrans rode along his line to deny in person a rumor that he had been slain. At Battery Robinett he dismounted, bared his head, and told his soldiers, \"I stand in the presence of brave men, and I take my hat off to you.\"\n\nGrant wrote disgustedly, \"Two or three hours of pursuit on the day of the battle without anything except what the men carried on their persons, would have been worth more than any pursuit commenced the next day could have possibly been.\" Rosecrans returned to Corinth to find that he was a hero in the Northern press. He was soon ordered to Cincinnati, where he was given command of the Army of the Ohio (soon to be renamed the Army of the Cumberland), replacing Don Carlos Buell, who had similarly failed to pursue retreating Confederates from the Battle of Perryville.\n\nAlthough his army had been badly mauled, Van Dorn escaped completely, evading Union troops sent by Grant later on October 5 at the Battle of Hatchie's Bridge, and marching to Holly Springs, Mississippi. He attributed his defeat to the failure of Hébert to open the second-day engagement on time, but nevertheless he was replaced by Lt. Gen. John C. Pemberton immediately after the battle. There were widespread outcries of indignation throughout the South over the senseless casualties at Corinth. Van Dorn requested a court of inquiry to answer charges that he had been drunk on duty at Corinth and that he had neglected his wounded on the retreat. The court cleared him of all blame by unanimous decision.\n\nThe Civil War Trust (a division of the American Battlefield Trust) and its partners have acquired and preserved of the Corinth battlefield.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Reliance Communications was soon in talks with MTN for a \"potential combination of their businesses\". In July, the two companies announced that they had mutually decided to end discussions regarding the merger.\n\nIn June 2008, MTN Group agreed to purchase Verizon Business South Africa, which was a provider of data services to corporate customers in South Africa and four other African countries. The acquisition was completed on 28 February 2009. MTN positioned themselves to provide DSL Broadband services in Africa, particularly South Africa, through its partnership with leading South African ISP, Afrihost.\n\nOn 26 June 2009, MTN Group's subsidiary merged with Belgacom International Carrier Services (BICS), a subsidiary of Belgacom. The combined subsidiary would function as the international gateway for carrier services of MTN.\n\nSouth African holding company Shanduka Group acquired a minority stake in MTN Group's Nigeria business for $335 million in November 2012.\nIn 2014, MTN was the only African brand named in the 2014 BrandZ Top 100 Most Valuable Global Brand ranking, the only South African company on the World Champions list and the Most Admired and Most Valuable Brand in Africa. It was also on the 2014 Brand Africa 100 ranking of the most admired and most valuable brands in Sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nOn 22 October 2015, MTN was named the Most Admired and the Most Valuable African brand, valued at US$4,672m, its second award in two years.

This was part of the agreement between MTN Ghana and Ghana's National Communications Authority (NCA) in November, 2015 for MTN Ghana to deploy 4G LTE mobile services to its customers in Ghana. Among other methods of payments, MTN mobile money was included as a payment option for the MTN share offer subscription. This was the first time mobile money had been used as a payment method in an IPO.\n\nOn February 23, 2017, Nigerian protestors attacked a MTN office in Abuja, Nigeria as a counterattack due to violence targeted against Nigerians in South Africa.\n\nIn September 2019 MTN began closing stores in Nigeria and some of their stores in Johannesburg, South Africa due to rioting, looting, and attacks on some of their facilities.\n\nGeoffrey Onyeama the Nigerian Foreign Minister stated at a press briefing on September 4, 2019, that MTN group along with Shoprite, stated that the targeted South African stores in Nigeria are \"subsidiaries that are owned by Nigerians.\" And that \"the property owned by Nigerians within Nigeria and the people working there are Nigerians.”\n\nLai Mohammed, Nigeria's Minister of Information and Culture, reported that some of the South African companies that were attacked in Nigeria have Nigerian investors owning significant amounts of stakes, and Nigerian employees.\n\nMTN has stated that they will continue to do business in Nigeria.\n\nIn March 2019 MTN launched a WhatsApp channel to let its customers buy airtime and data bundles through the messaging app. Customers can also check their balances and store their credit or debit cards in the app for future purchases.

MTN has a 49 percent stake in government-controlled MTN Irancell, the second-largest mobile phone operator in Iran, and 21 percent of MTN's subscriber base is from the country. In January 2012, the US-based advocacy group United Against Nuclear Iran (UANI) launched a campaign publicly calling for MTN to scale back its operations in Iran and end its business in the country. UANI alleges that MTN technology is \"enabling the Iranian government to locate and track individual cellphone users which it says is a violation of users' human rights\".\n\nIn June 2012, Reuters and the BBC reported an allegation by Chris Kilowan, a former executive for the company in Iran, that MTN Group may have been complicit in securing American telecommunications technology from Sun Microsystems, Hewlett-Packard and Cisco Systems on behalf of Irancell, in violation of trade sanctions against Iran. Oracle, which owns Sun Microsystems, said that it was investigating and denied involvement, saying that it complies with US export laws. Hewlett-Packard issued a similar statement. MTN Group denied the allegations, saying that it complied with US sanctions against Iran.\n\nTurkey's Turkcell filed a $4.2 billion lawsuit in Washington, D.C., in 2012 alleging the company used bribery to win a mobile licence in Iran that was first awarded to Turkcell. The court delayed the case in October 2012 pending a US Supreme Court decision on the Alien Tort Statute, the US human rights law on which Turkcell's suit is based. In May 2013, Turkcell dropped its multibillion-dollar US lawsuit against MTN Group, citing a US Supreme Court ruling that hurt its case. On 27 November 2013, Turkcell resued in Johannesburg.\n\nIn 2015, the Nigerian subsidiary of MTN was fined by the Government of the Federal Republic of Nigeria through the telecommunications regulator, Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) for partial compliance of regulatory guidelines to Mobile Network Operators to disconnect from their network, all improperly registered Subscribers Identification Modules (SIM). The commission exercised section 20(1) of the Telephone Subscribers regulation (TSR) law on MTN, leading to a calculated fine of $5.2 billion, according to the constitution.\n\nThe compliance audit carried out by the NCC on MTN network revealed unregistered 5.2 million customers lines were not deactivated as directed. This led to the NCC fining MTN with the sum of $1000 for each unregistered SIM according to the Telephone Subscribers regulation (TSR) law, which amounted to $5.2bn.\n\nWhat followed was major resignations among the top echelon of the organization including the chief executive officer, Sifiso Dabengwa, the Head of Nigeria Operation, Micheal Ikpoki and the Head of Cooperate Affairs, Akinwale Goodluck being replaced with Phuthuma Nhleko, Ferdi Moolman and Amina Oyegbola as new chairman, managing director and Head of Corporate and Regulation respectively.\n\nThe new management employed a diplomatic measure between the government of the Republic of South Africa and its Nigerian counterpart to ameliorate the burden of the liabilities from the fine. This action brought about the reduction of the liability to $3.2 billion.\n\nIn September 2018, MTN announced that it will close its zero rated access to the popular social network Twitter.\n\nThe company was founded in 1994 as M-Cell with assistance from the South African government. In 1995, it replaced its then-CEO, John Beck, with Robert (Bob) Chaphe. In 2001, the company reported that its controlling shareholder was Johnnic Holdings, and the chairperson was Irene Charnley. In 2002, Phuthuma Nhleko became the CEO, replacing then-CEO Paul Edwards, who had invested in expansion to Nigeria.\n\n"}

It is one of the better known castles in the Netherlands and featured in many television shows set in the Middle Ages.\n\nThe history of Muiden Castle begins with Count Floris V who built a stone castle at the mouth of the river in 1280, when he gained command over an area that used to be part of the See of Utrecht. The Vecht river was the trade route to Utrecht, one of the most important trade towns of that age. The castle was used to enforce a toll on the traders. It is a relatively small castle, measuring 32 by 35 metres with brick walls well over 1.5 metres thick. A large moat surrounded the castle.\n\nIn 1296, Gerard van Velsen conspired together with Herman van Woerden, Gijsbrecht IV of Amstel, and several others to kidnap Floris V. The count was eventually imprisoned in Muiden Castle. After Floris V attempted to escape, Gerard personally killed the count on the 27th of June 1296 by stabbing him 20 times. The alleged cause of the conflict between the nobles was the rape of Gerard van Velsen's wife by Floris.\n\nIn 1297, the castle was conquered by Willem van Mechelen, the Archbishop of Utrecht, and by the year 1300 the castle was demolished.\n\nA hundred years later (ca. 1370-1386) the castle was rebuilt on the same spot based on the same plan, by Albert I, Duke of Bavaria, who at that time was also the Count of Holland and Zeeland.\n\nThe next owner of the castle shows up in the 16th century, when P.C. Hooft (1581-1647), an author, poet and historian took over sheriff and bailiff duties for the area (Het Gooiland). For 39 years he spent his summers in the castle and invited friends, scholars, poets and painters such as Vondel, Huygens, Bredero and Maria Tesselschade Visscher, over for visits. This group became known as the Muiderkring. He also extended the garden and the plum orchard, while at the same time an outer earthworks defense system was put into place.\n\nAt the end of the 18th century, the castle was first used as a prison, then abandoned and became derelict. Further neglect caused it to be offered for sale in 1825, with the purpose of it being demolished. Only intervention by King William I prevented this. Another 70 years went by until enough money was gathered to restore the castle to its former glory.\n\nMuiden Castle is currently a national museum (Rijksmuseum). The inside of the castle, its rooms and kitchens, was restored to look like they did in the 17th century and several of the rooms now house a collection of arms and armour.\n\n\n"}

Real-time collaborative editing can also occur in hybrid manner, such as with Power Sheet BI for Excel, in with offline, web-based, and online collaborative editing in desktop software as well as web-based and mobile apps, can be synchronized automatically with instant access to version history.\n\nUnlike asynchronous (non-real-time, delayed or offline) collaborative editing, such as occurs with revision control systems like Git or Subversion, real-time editing performs automatic, periodic, often nearly instantaneous synchronization of edits of all online users as they edit the document on their own device. This is designed to avoid or minimize edit conflicts. In asynchronous collaborative editing, each user must typically manually submit (publish, push or commit), update (refresh, pull, download or sync) and (if any edit conflicts occur) merge their edits.\n\nDue to the delayed nature of asynchronous collaborative editing, multiple users can end up editing the same line, word, row, element, data, row or field resulting in edit conflicts which require manual edit merging or overwriting, requiring the user to choose which edits to use or (depending on the system and setup) automatically overwriting their edits or other people's edits, with or without a warning.\n\nThe first instance of a collaborative real-time editor was demonstrated by Douglas Engelbart in 1968, in The Mother of All Demos. Widely available implementations of the concept took decades to appear.\n\nInstant Update was released for the classic Mac OS in 1991 from ON Technology. Later, a version for Microsoft Windows was released as well, allowing real-time collaboration across these two operating systems. Instant Update relied on a work group server to coordinate documents updated in real time on multiple clients.\n\nThe Web 2.0 phenomenon has caused an explosion of interest in browser-based document editing tools. In particular, a product called Writely saw explosive user growth and was bought by Google in March 2006 (what became known as Google Docs and later renamed to Google Drive). It provided simultaneous edits on the entirety of a document, though changes from other users were only reflected after the client program polling the server (every half-minute or so). Another early web-based solution was JotSpotLive, in which line-by-line simultaneous editing was available in near-realtime. However, after Google's purchase of parent company JotSpot in November 2006, the site was closed. Google Sites was launched in February 2007 as a refactoring of JotSpot, but it lacks the multi-user real-time abilities of JotLive. The Synchroedit (rich text) and MobWrite (plain text) projects are two, more recent, open source attempts to fill the in gap real-time browser-based collaborative editing, though still unable to achieve true real-time performance, especially on a large scale architecture.\n\nIn 2009, Google started beta testing Google Wave, a real-time collaboration environment which Google hoped would eventually displace email and instant messaging. EtherPad was acquired by Google, which allocated the EtherPad team to work within the Wave project. However, Google announced in August 2010 on its blog that it had decided to stop developing Wave as a standalone project, due to insufficient user adoption. After Google released the abandoned EtherPad source code as open source in December 2009, the community took over its development and produced a complete rewrite named Etherpad lite, which is written entirely in JavaScript and built on top of node.js. Other notable tools based on operational transformation technology are ShareJS, CKEditor, and SubEthaEdit.\n\nThe complexity of real-time collaborative editing solutions stems from communication latency. In theory, if communication were instantaneous, then creating a real-time collaborative editor would be no more difficult than creating a single-user editor, because a document could be edited using an algorithm similar to the following:\n\n\nHowever, the speed of communication is limited by network latency. This creates a fundamental dilemma: users need their own edits incorporated into the document instantly, but if they are incorporated instantly, then because of communication latency, their edits must necessarily be inserted into different versions of the document.\n\nAn example illustrates this problem. Suppose Bob and Alice start with a document containing the word \"Mary\". Bob deletes 'M', then inserts 'H', to change the word into \"Hary\". Alice, before she receives either edit from Bob, deletes 'r', then deletes 'a', to change it into \"My\". Both Bob and Alice will then receive edits that were applied to versions of the document that \"never existed\" on their own machines.\n\nThus, the challenge of real-time collaborative editing is to figure out exactly how to apply edits from remote users, which were originally created in versions of the document that never existed locally, and which may conflict with the user's own local edits.\n\nThe most sophisticated solutions solve this problem in a way that does not require a server, does not use locking (all users can freely edit all parts of a document at the same time), and supports any number of users (limited only by the resources of the computers). UNA and SubEthaEdit are examples of two programs that take this approach.\n\nWhile these sophisticated approaches enable the best user experience, a basic collaborative editor can also be created in a client–server model. In a client–server scenario, one of the editor instances is assigned the role of collaboration server when the document is opened. This server ensures that other editors are kept in sync by determining network latency and acting as a time synchronization server. The server receives timestamped notifications of changes made to the document by other users. It determines how those changes should affect its local copy, and broadcasts its changes to the collaboration pool. In some models, the changes are not reflected on a client until an official response is returned from the server, even if those changes were made locally.\n\nThis approach, while significantly less powerful, allows for basic collaboration at a relatively low cost. This makes it preferable in situations where processing resources are limited. NetSketch is an example of a program that uses this model.\n\nIn the past, Microsoft and IBM have worked to add collaboration facilities to their existing architectures. Although marketed as real-time collaboration, these 'workspace' approaches require either document locking (so only one person can edit it at a time), or 'reconciliation' of conflicting changes, which is generally found by users to be unsatisfactory.\n\n"}

Jägerstätter was sentenced to death and executed for his refusal to fight for Nazi Germany. He was later declared a martyr and beatified by the Catholic Church.\n\nJägerstätter was born in Sankt Radegund, Upper Austria, a small village between Salzburg and Braunau am Inn. He was the illegitimate child of Rosalia Huber, a chambermaid, and Franz Bachmeier, a farmer. As his parents could not afford a marriage, Franz was first cared for by his grandmother, Elisabeth Huber. His biological father was killed in World War I when Franz was still a child. When his mother married in 1917, Franz was adopted by her husband, Heinrich Jägerstätter.\n\nIn his youth, Franz gained a reputation for being a wild fellow, but, in general, his daily life was like that of most Austrian peasants. He worked as a farmhand and also as a miner in Eisenerz, until in 1933 he inherited the farmstead of his foster father. In that same year, he fathered an out-of-wedlock daughter, Hildegard Auer. On Maundy Thursday of 1936, he married Franziska Schwaninger (4 March 1913–16 March 2013), a deeply religious woman. After the wedding liturgy, the bridal couple proceeded on a pilgrimage to Rome. Inspired by his wife, Jägerstätter began to study the Bible and the lives of saints. The marriage produced three daughters.\n\nWhen German troops moved into Austria in March 1938, Jägerstätter rejected the offered position as Radegund mayor. He was the only person in the village to vote against the \"Anschluss\" in the plebiscite of 10 April; nevertheless, the local authorities suppressed his dissent and announced unanimous approval. Although he was not involved with any political organization and did undergo one brief period of military training, he remained openly anti-Nazi. On 8 December 1940, he joined the Third Order of Saint Francis and from summer 1941 worked as a sacristan at the local parish church, being deferred from military service four times. \n\nDrafted for the first time on 17 June 1940, Jägerstetter, aged 33, was again conscripted into the German Wehrmacht in October and completed his training at the Enns garrison. He refused to take the Hitler oath, but could return home in 1941 under an exemption as a farmer. Faced with his experiences in military service, the suppression of the church, as well as reports on the Nazi \"T4\" \"euthanasia\" program, he began to examine the morality of the war. He even proceeded to Linz to discuss this with his bishop but emerged from the conversation saddened that the episcopate seemed afraid to confront the issues.\n\nAfter many delays, Jägerstätter was finally called to active duty on 23 February 1943. By this time, he had three daughters with his wife, the eldest not quite six. He maintained his position against fighting for Nazi Germany and upon entering into the Wehrmacht garrison in Enns on March 1 declared his conscientious objection. His offer to serve as a paramedic was ignored. He was immediately arrested and placed in custody, first at the Linz remand prison, then from 4 May at Berlin-Tegel. A priest from his village visited him in jail and tried to talk him into serving, but did not succeed. When he heard of the fate of the Austrian priest Father Franz Reinisch, who had been executed for his refusal to take the Hitler oath, he was determined to go the same way.\n\nAccused of \"Wehrkraftzersetzung\" (undermining of military morale), Jägerstätter was sentenced to death in a military trial at the \"Reichskriegsgericht\" in Berlin-Charlottenburg on 6 July 1943. He was deported to Brandenburg-Görden Prison on 9 August, where he was executed by guillotine in the afternoon, aged 36. After the war, in 1946, his ashes were buried at the Sankt Radegund cemetery.\n\nJägerstätter was criticized by his countrymen, especially by those who had served in the military, for failing in his duty as a husband and father. The municipality of Sankt Radegund at first refused to put his name on the local war memorial and a pension for his widow was not approved until 1950.\n\nJägerstätter's fate was not well known until 1964, when US sociologist Gordon Zahn published his biography, \"\". Thomas Merton, the famed Trappist monk and peace activist, included a chapter about Franz Jägerstätter in his book \"Faith and Violence\" (1968). A 1971 film treatment of his life made for Austrian television, \"Verweigerung\" (\"The Refusal\") (originally titled \"Der Fall Jägerstätter\"), by director Axel Corti starred Kurt Weinzierl. A bronze plaque with his quotation about conscientious objection was dedicated at the Pacifist Memorial in Sherborn, Massachusetts in 1994. His case was a topic of the annual \"Braunauer Zeitgeschichte-Tage\" conference in 1995. The death sentence was nullified by the Landgericht Berlin on 7 May 1997. A Stolperstein for Jägerstätter in Sankt Radegund was laid in 2006.\n\nIn June 2007, Pope Benedict XVI issued an apostolic exhortation declaring Jägerstätter a martyr. On 26 October 2007, he was beatified in a ceremony held by Cardinal José Saraiva Martins at the New Cathedral in Linz. His feast day is the day of his baptism, 21 May.\n\nThe documentary, \"Franz Jaegerstaetter: A Man of Conscience\", was released in 2011.\n\nA film about Jägerstätter, \"A Hidden Life\", written and directed by Terrence Malick, premiered in May 2019 at the 72nd Cannes Film Festival, and was given a general release in the US on December 13, 2019. The film is inspired by the book titled \"Franz Jägerstätter: Letters and Writings from Prison\", edited by Jägerstätter biographer Erna Putz, with Malick acquiring its adaptation rights for the production.\n\n\n"}

The scholarship is often considered one of the most prestigious and competitive international fellowships available to American graduate students, alongside the Marshall, Rhodes, and Mitchell scholarships. Each year, up to two students may be endorsed by each of the 110 U.S. institutions invited to participate in the program.\n\nWith an acceptance rate of approximately 6.3%, the Churchill Scholarship is less selective than the Marshall, Rhodes, Gates Cambridge and Mitchell scholarships (acceptance rates 3.3%, 3.7%, 1.6%, and 4% respectively), however, significantly fewer institutions are allowed to nominate candidates for the Churchill Scholarship (presently 110 institutions as compared to at least 240 institutions for the Marshall, over 320 institutions for the Rhodes, and at least 415 institutions for the Mitchell). Furthermore, each institution may nominate only two candidates to the Churchill Scholarship, so the endorsed candidate pool is initially very selective. By comparison, the Marshall scholarship typically receives 915-980 endorsed applicants and the Rhodes scholarship typically receives 850-880 endorsed applicants, and the Mitchell scholarship typically receives 300 endorsed applicants. In contrast to the Gates Cambridge Scholarship, applying to the Churchill, Marshall, Rhodes, or Mitchell scholarships all require the endorsement of an approved U.S. undergraduate institution. As such, the actual acceptance rates for these scholarships are significantly lower than the official acceptance rate of endorsed applicants (e.g., approximately 1.2% for the Rhodes in 2016). Instead of looking for the canonical \"well rounded\" applicant, the Churchill Scholarship seeks those with \"interesting jagged-edges\" and is considered one of the most academically challenging scholarships; the average GPA of the applicant pool is 3.8, and the average GPA of the winners is 3.98 (in 2016 all winners had a GPA above 3.95).

Anticipating the final establishment of the college, Churchill met with American friends Lewis W. Douglas, John Loeb, Sr., and Carl Gilbert to ask them to create a scholarship for young Americans to study at the college. In 1959, the Winston Churchill Foundation of the United States was established as a nonprofit charitable organization. The Foundation initially made travel grants to Churchill Overseas Fellows, distinguished senior faculty from American colleges and universities who would spend a sabbatical year at the College. Eight of the Churchill Fellows won the Nobel Prize.\n\nIn 1963 the Foundation funded the first three Churchill Scholarships for one year of study. Subsequently, the Scholarships funded either one-year programs or three-year doctoral degrees. In order to increase the number of Churchill Scholars, the foundation decided in the early 1980s to support only one-year programs. To this day however, it is not uncommon for Churchill Scholars to obtain alternate funding to support continued doctoral study at the University of Cambridge following the completion of their Scholarship year.\n\nSince 1963, around 550 Churchill Scholarships have been awarded. As of 2016 the Foundation has increased the number of scholarships awarded each year from fourteen to fifteen. The scholarship is worth between $50,000 and $60,000 depending on the exchange rate, covering all university and college fees (i.e., tuition, currently about $25,000) at the University of Cambridge, a living allowance, visa fees, up to $1,500 for travel between the United States and the United Kingdom, and the possibility of an additional $2,000 Special Research Grant.\n\nA complete list of past Churchill Scholars is available here.\n\nAs of 2017-2018, 80 institutions have had successful nominations, and the schools with the most Churchill Scholars are:\n\n"}

Other major cities include Porto Sant'Elpidio (25,118 inhabitants), Porto San Giorgio (16,201 inhabitants), Sant'Elpidio a Mare (16,838 inhabitants), and Montegranaro (13,358 inhabitants). As of 2017, the province has a population of 174,358 inhabitants and spans an area of . It contains 40 \"comuni\".\n\nAn 1861 report by Minister Minghetti to Prince Eugene of Savoy, Lieutenant of the King, justified merging the small and fragmented provinces of southern Marche into a single large province, a move to overcome the historical border between the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies and the Papal States. The residents of Abruzzo and Cardinal Filippo de Angelis were opposed to this. Despite this, 58% of the population of Fermo voted in favour of merging some smaller provinces, and the province of Ascoli-Fermo was created and became known as Ascoli Piceno.\n\nIn 2000, supporters of forming a new province of Fermo exploited a pact between the Lega Nord and Forza Italia who had formed a number of proposals regarding establishing provincial bodies, including one that later led to the foundation of the province of Monza and Brianza. Fabrizio Cesetti was the only signatory of the act forming the province, which was delayed due to the conclusion of the Legislature XIII of Italy. Following this, Law 147/2004 was passed, and the province of Fermo was established in 2004.\n\nThe Province of Fermo is in the Marche region of central Italy, and stretches from the Sibillini Mountains to the Adriatic Sea. Its main geographic feature is the valley of the River Tenna. This river rises in the mountains, enters the province near Servigliano, passes through Grottazzolina and Montegiorgio, and reaches the sea near Sant'Elpidio a Mare and Porto Sant'Elpidio. The River Aso forms the southern border of the province, separating it from the Province of Ascoli Piceno. It rises in the mountains and flows into the Adriatic Sea at Pedaso.

{"id": "1963448", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1963448", "title": "George Washington Masonic National Memorial", "text": "George Washington Masonic National Memorial\n\nThe George Washington Masonic National Memorial is a Masonic building and memorial located in Alexandria, Virginia, outside Washington, D.C. It is dedicated to the memory of George Washington, the first President of the United States and a Mason. The tower is fashioned after the ancient Lighthouse of Alexandria in Egypt. The tall memorial sits atop Shooter's Hill (also known as Shuter's Hill) at 101 Callahan Drive. Construction began in 1922, the building was dedicated in 1932, and the interior finally completed in 1970. In July 2015, it was designated a National Historic Landmark for its architecture, and as one of the largest-scale private memorials to honor Washington.\n\nThe memorial is served by the King Street–Old Town Metro station on the Blue and Yellow Lines of the Washington Metro. The station is located about four blocks from the memorial.\n\nThe idea to construct a Masonic memorial for George Washington was first proposed in 1852 by the Washington area's \"mother lodge,\" Fredericksburg Lodge No. 4 (located in Fredericksburg, Virginia). Funds were sought from Grand Lodges (state-level Masonic organizations) throughout the United States to construct a memorial Masonic Temple with a large statue in the vestibule. Enough funds were raised to commission a life-size bronze statue of Washington in full Masonic regalia from a sculptor named Powers who was living in Rome, Italy. The statue reached Alexandria in early 1861, just before the outbreak of the American Civil War. It remained on display in Alexandria until the summer of 1863, when it was moved to Richmond, Virginia. The statue was destroyed in the fire which occurred as Richmond surrendered to the Army of the Potomac on April 3, 1865.\n\nPlans for a Masonic memorial moved forward again in 1909 after work on a competing memorial began. The proposed site for the new memorial was Shooter's Hill, which at one time had been seriously considered by James Madison and Thomas Jefferson as the site of the United States Capitol building. On May 8, 1900, citizens of Alexandria formed the \"Washington Monument Association of Alexandria\" (WMAA), a nonprofit organization whose mission was to build a memorial to George Washington in the city of Alexandria. Little was accomplished in the organization's first few years of life, but in February 1908 the WMAA purchased an option to buy a tract of land on and around Shooter's Hill and the nearby Alexandria Golf Course. Most of the land immediately on either side of King Street was subdivided into housing tracts and sold, with on top of Shooter's Hill reserved for a memorial. The sale of the housing subdivisions paid for the purchase of the entire tract, with enough left over to provide for construction of a memorial.\n\nWithin a month of the purchase of Shooter's Hill, the WMAA decided to build a park rather than a memorial. About were set aside for the George Washington Memorial Park, while another were set aside for a small memorial within the park. The new subdivision, named Fort Ellsworth (after an American Civil War fort which used to occupy Shooter's Hill), was platted in November 1908, and public streets laid out. The park was ready for dedication on April 30, 1909—the 120th anniversary of the inauguration of Washington as President. Alexandria-Washington Lodge No. 22 (George Washington's Masonic lodge, as well as the lodge he led as a Worshipful Master) was asked to preside over its dedication. President William Howard Taft, Vice President James S. Sherman, Speaker of the House Joseph Gurney Cannon, Virginia Governor Claude A. Swanson, Virginia Lieutenant Governor J. Taylor Ellyson, the Board of Commissioners of the District of Columbia, Baltimore Mayor J. Barry Mahool, and numerous other dignitaries attended the dedication ceremony. (Shooter's Hill was incorporated into the city of Alexandria on April 1, 1914.)\n\nThere were several reasons why Masonic bodies finally began to build a memorial. The construction of George Washington Memorial Park sparked renewed Masonic interest in building their own memorial. But another reason was the safety of items owned or used by George Washington (\"Washingtoniana\") and which were now owned by the Alexandria-Washington lodge. The lodge had suffered several fires over the previous century, and a number of these historic items were destroyed. Constructing a fire resistive building which would more safely house these important items was a major factor in pushing the Masonic memorial forward.\n\nIn late 1907 or early 1908, Alexandria Commissioner of Revenue Charles H. Callahan (the deputy master of Alexandria-Washington Lodge No. 22) proposed to his fellow Masons that, at last, a memorial to George Washington should be built. Callahan proposed the construction of a $10,000 memorial temple. In early 1908, the Alexandria-Washington Lodge formed a \"local memorial temple committee\" to research the costs and obstacles involved in building a memorial temple. The committee passed a resolution asking Joseph Eggleston, the Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of Virginia, to approve the creation of a memorial temple and to assist in creating a national memorial association in which all Masons and Masonic organizations could participate.\n\nOn May 7, 1909, the Grand Lodge of Virginia called upon all grand lodges in the United States to meet in Alexandria on February 22, 1910, to discuss plans for organizing a George Washington Masonic National Memorial Association whose purpose would be to construct a memorial temple. President Taft, Representative Champ Clark, Secretary of War Jacob M. Dickinson, and Virginia Governor William Hodges Mann all spoke at the February 22 meeting. The George Washington Masonic National Memorial Association (GWMNMA) was formed at this meeting, and plans were adopted to raise $500,000 to go toward the cost of construction and another $500,000 for an endowment and maintenance fund. Thomas J. Shryock, Grand Master of Maryland (and a former Treasurer of Maryland and Brigadier General in the Maryland National Guard), was elected president of the GWMNMA.\n\nAt this point, the GWMNMA only planned to construct a Masonic temple, not a giant memorial. One floor was to be set aside for use by Masonic lodges, and one or more fire resistive, secure rooms in the temple were to be used for the display of Washingtoniana and historical documents owned by the Alexandria-Washington Lodge. By February 1911, the GWMNMA had ruled out all locations except Alexandria as the site for its memorial temple, and fund-raising activities were being planned. A more formal association structure was also adopted at this time. But except for fund-raising activities, little was done in the association's first five years of activity.\n\nNearly everyone involved in the project in its early years agreed the memorial temple had to be built in Alexandria due to Washington's extensive ties to that city. George Washington Memorial Park seemed a good location, but this park was still privately owned by the WMAA. In September 1915, the Alexandria-Washington Lodge offered to buy several lots on top of Shooter's Hill for $1,000. At about the same time, the city of Alexandria discussed whether it should ask the WMAA to turn over the remainder of George Washington Memorial Park to the city. The lodge suggested that of the eastern slope of George Washington Memorial Park be retained as a public park, while the rest of the tract could be used for any purposes the city wanted. This plan was not acted on. By December 1915, the city had purchased all of Shooter's Hill and George Washington Memorial Park from the WMAA except for a area (lots 29 through 38, inclusive, of block 5) on the north slope of the hill. In October or December 1915 (sources disagree on the date), the Alexandria-Washington Lodge purchased the north slope of Shooter's Hill (an area about ) for $1,000. Under the terms of the conveyance of the deed, the Masons were required to build a memorial temple (costing no less than $100,000) to George Washington at the top of the hill within 10 years or they would be forced to turn over the land to the city of Alexandria.\n\nWith land secured, the Masons began making plans to build a memorial. In 1917, the Alexandria-Washington Lodge reported that the intent remained to construct a $500,000 building to house the Washingtoniana (valued at $2 million) which the lodge held. The GWMNMA had raised $5,000, and another $20,000 in donations was anticipated. GWMNMA President Thomas J. Shyrock died on February 3, 1918, and Louis Arthur Watres (former Lieutenant Governor of Pennsylvania and a former Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania) was elected president as his successor. At its annual meeting just two weeks later, the association approved the employment of an architect to begin developing plans for the memorial. Watres departed for New York City to interview architects. On the train, he met Harvey Wiley Corbett of the New York City firm of Helmle & Corbett (and coincidentally a Freemason). The GWMNMA selected Corbett to be the chief architect.\n\nBy February 1922, the GWMNMA had radically revised its plans for the memorial. Now the association planned a building which would cost $1.5 million, with another $400,000 set aside for landscaping the grounds and $500,000 as an endowment for perpetually maintaining the memorial. The directors of the GWMNMA also approved a new charter for the organization, inspected the building site, and approved blueprints for the building. The state of Virginia approved the revised charter for the GWMNMA on March 16, 1922.\n\nCorbett planned a three-story memorial temple topped by a three-story tower. The first three floors (which constituted the temple and the base of the tower) would be built in the Neoclassical style, while the tower would be a variation on the setbacks popular in Modern architecture. The structure was to be built entirely of masonry, with almost no metal used in its construction (except for reinforcing rods in the concrete). The rationale for this decision was that a building constructed purely of stone would be the most permanent structure possible. The firm of Osgood & Osgood of Grand Rapids, Michigan, was the consulting engineer. Daniel E. Moran (of the firm Moran, Maurice & Proctor of New York) designed the building's foundation; Gunvald Aus was the structural engineer; the firm of Clarke, McMullen & Riley (of New York) was the mechanical engineer; and Carl Rust Parker of Olmsted Brothers was the landscape architect. The general contractor was the Percy Cranford Co., but the actual masonry work was done by the Samuel Miller Co. (both companies were located in Washington, D.C.).\n\nCorbett's initial design was for a memorial about high. Corbett drew his inspiration from the restoration of the lighthouse at the port of Ostia Antica near Rome. The first floor was occupied by a main hall with a colonnade on either side and clerestory windows, at the back of which a large statue of Washington would reside. Historic murals would be painted on the walls. To the right and left of the main hall would be large meeting rooms (one for the use of the Alexandria-Washington Lodge and one for use by other Masonic bodies). To the left of the main hall there would also be a small room which would contain a replica of the original Masonic lodge room in which Washington himself had presided.\n\nAdditional details and apparent design changes were revealed in July 1922. Although the building was still just in height, the press now reported that the building would be built specifically in the Greek and Romanesque Revival styles and be constructed of white marble and white concrete. The atrium of the building (as the first floor main hall was now called) was now slated to contain space along the walls which could be used by Grand Lodges to memorialize their prominent members, while the rooms around the atrium would be dedicated to the various Masonic \"appendant bodies\" (jurisdictional bodies, social groups, youth and women's organizations, etc.). The plan called for the second floor to be used as an art gallery as well as a museum, and for the museum to not only honor Washington but also other famous Masons from Virginia. The memorial was still intended to house Washingtoniana and contain a replica of the original Alexandria-Washington Lodge's meeting room.\n\nA major revision to the memorial plans was made in February 1923. The GWMNMA approved constructing the building entirely of granite (rather than marble and concrete), a change which increased the cost of the structure to $3 million. Including landscaping and the endowment, the total cost of the structure had risen to $4 million.\n\nThese plans were revised and elaborated on again by April 1923. Now the memorial was to stand high. The atrium on the first floor was specified to be wide by deep. With the clerestory windows, this hall would be in height. Meeting rooms would still surround the atrium. The second story, now in size with a high ceiling and extensive windows (to let in large amounts of natural light), was still slated to house the Washington museum. The purpose of the third floor was not yet agreed upon. The tower above the third floor now contained an observation deck forming a seventh and ultimate floor at the top of the tower. The new plans specified that terraces would lead from the front steps of the memorial down to the street below. The cost, however, was still budgeted for $4 million.\n\nThe final major change in the memorial came in early 1924. The height of the tower had been decreased at some point to . But in February 1924, architect Corbett raised the tower's height back to .\n\nGiven the size and weight of the memorial, even in its early design stages, a solid foundation for the structure was critical. An initial test borehole into Shooter's Hill (which reached a depth of ) found no bedrock, leading to concerns that the site might not be a suitable location for the building. Daniel E. Moran, the foundation engineer, further investigated the earth beneath the building. Moran drilled below the lowest point of the foundation and found gravel, hard clay, and sand. Soil experts in New York City and with the United States Geological Survey analyzed the soil and provided a guarantee (backed up by a bond) that no settling of the building would occur due to soil conditions.\n\nGround for the memorial was broken at noon on June 5, 1922. Louis Watres, president of the association, and Charles H. Callahan, vice president, broke ground in a driving rain. The shovel and pick used to break ground, as well as four small stones from the first two spades of earth turned, were preserved by the Alexandria-Washington Lodge. Excavation of the memorial's foundation began a few days later, with Cranford Paving Co. of Washington, D.C., doing the work. The foundation was roughly hemispherical to provide the greatest stability, and of the top of hill removed (lowering the elevation to just ) in order to accommodate the wide by long foundation. To ensure that the clay remained damp and did not dry out, which would cause the building to settle, a concrete pad was laid on top of the clay. This pad was deep in the center but only deep on the edges, and consisted of of concrete and of reinforcing steel rods. The pad was allowed to set for several months before work began on the foundation itself. The basement of the building was as large as the first two floors combined and was intended to house the structure's mechanical plant. Although steam shovels were used to excavate the foundation, the earth was carried away by mule-drawn wagons. A wide road was constructed to the top of Shooter's Hill to permit the transport of earth off the site and construction materials to the hilltop.\n\nBy July 1922, the GWMNMA had received $700,000 in donations and another $900,000 in pledges. Some time in the spring of 1922, the GWMNMA also obtained title to the tract encompassing the rest of Shooter's Hill. About of the tract, valued at $1 million, was purchased from the city of Alexandria at almost no cost (essentially making it a gift from the city). The total size of the tract owned by the Masons was now .\n\nBy January 1923 the foundation was almost completed and the granite walls for the first floor were rising. Work proceeded very rapidly through June. By February 1923, $1 million had been spent on constructing the foundation and walls and on landscaping. Topsoil for the landscaping came from the Earl Strong Co. of Alexandria, the grass seed from O.M. Scotts and Sons of Ohio, and other trees, shrubs and landscaping products from C.F. Armiger of Washington, D.C. Revenues easily exceeded these expenditures, as $1.8 million had been received in donations and pledges. The same month, the GWMNMA expanded its board of directors from nine to 12. By April 1923, the foundation had been fully excavated and the foundation walls constructed. The \"Washington Post\" reported that the concrete foundation was the largest ever cast in a single piece. The foundation (of articulate girder design) was in size, thick, and contained of concrete. Plows pulled by mules had reshaped the side of the hill into its terraced form, and most of the landscaping was now done. Total cash donations received by April 1923 totaled more than $1 million. Concrete for the first floor was poured in June 1923 and once it had set, the eight green granite marble columns in the atrium were set in place. Each green marble column was high and in diameter when finished. To prevent the columns from twisting or slipping, a mortise and tenon was used. A mortise approximately deep was created in the floor and a tenon carved on the bottom of the column base. A small amount of mortar mixed with small flat discs of metal was used to help fix the tenon into the mortise. Between the base and the first drum (or section of the column), between the drums and between the top drum and the capital were placed wedge-shaped thin sheets of lead to inhibit slippage. By October 15, the first floor and granite outer walls were complete.\n\nLaying of the memorial's cornerstone occurred on November 1, 1923. Planners had initially proposed that cornerstone be laid on November 4, 1923—the 170th anniversary of George Washington's initiation into Freemasonry. But because November 4 fell on a Sunday in 1923, the ceremony was scheduled for November 1. The ceremony almost did not occur. A short time before the event, contractors discovered that the cornerstone for the memorial had been cut too small. A new cornerstone was quickly fashioned and completed just in time. Alexandria Mayor William Allen Smoot declared a holiday, and all businesses closed except for banks and the U.S. post office. The United States Navy light cruiser and a U.S. Navy destroyer anchored at the Alexandria torpedo factory as part of the festivities. Trains ran every three minutes into the city of Alexandria in order to accommodate the crowds.\n\nAn estimated 14,000 Masons, dignitaries, United States armed forces personnel, police, and others marched in a parade from the Alexandria waterfront to Shooter's Hill to kick off the event. During the parade, four United States Army Air Corps planes circled overhead. Among the dignitaries present at the 1:00 P.M. cornerstone-laying event were President Calvin Coolidge, now-Chief Justice of the United States William Howard Taft, Virginia Governor Elbert Lee Trinkle, and Alexandria Mayor Smoot. Charles H. Callahan was master of ceremonies, and the Rt. Rev. James Edward Freeman, Bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Washington, provided the invocation and benediction. President Coolidge laid the cornerstone using the same trowel Washington used on September 18, 1793, to lay the cornerstone of the U.S. Capitol building (the trowel was owned by the Alexandria-Washington Lodge). Loudspeakers were used to broadcast the speeches of President Coolidge and the other speakers to the crowd, and a temporary radio station (operated by radio station WCAP) was set up on Shooter's Hill to broadcast the proceedings nationwide. (Both the loudspeakers and temporary radio station were the same which President Warren G. Harding had used during the laying of the cornerstone for the Lincoln Memorial.)\n\nEvery U.S. state deposited an item into the cornerstone. Other items deposited in the cornerstone were an American flag; a bronze medal celebrating the inauguration of Warren G. Harding; a bronze plaque containing the names of the architects, consulting architects, landscape architects, engineers, and contractors working on the memorial; a Christian Bible; a lambskin apron; a copy of William Joseph Williams' 1794 portrait of George Washington in Masonic regalia; several books and pamphlets concerning the life of Washington and the history of Freemasonry in America; and the names of the board of directors and officers of the GWMNMA. Beneath the cornerstone was another container, which held several dimes, copies of the Constitution, copies of the Declaration of Independence, books, and other items.\n\nConstruction proceeded slowly after the cornerstone was laid. This was because construction stopped every winter to ensure that the memorial remained free of moisture, frost damage, and the effects of cooling (to improve the fit between stones). The Helmle & Corbett architectural firm did an extensive study of stone buildings in Europe, and determined that working during good weather was the best way to construct a durable building. During 1923, the GWMNMA raised another $500,000 in cash donations, which brought the total received to $2 million. The granite for the memorial came from quarries in New Hampshire, and was provided by the Maine & New Hampshire Granite Corp. Some of these blocks were as much as long.\n\nBy the time of the GWMNMA's annual meeting in February 1924, construction on the first floor was almost complete. The first five terraces above the street (the \"lower terrace\") were built using Potomac bluestone for the walls, while the walks were graveled. The topmost sixth terrace (the \"upper terrace\", which encircled the building and its main entrance) was constructed with Conway Pink Granite for a base. The base was high and thick. The upper portion of this wall was concrete. More than of concrete and of steel reinforcing bars were used in this part of the wall. The GWMNMA believed that the second floor would be finished by the end of the construction season in the fall of 1924, and that the entire structure would be done by late 1927 or early 1928. The association also decided that a statue of Washington should be placed in the memorial atrium, and that this statue should be a marble copy of Jean-Antoine Houdon's 1788 statue of George Washington (which stood in the rotunda of the Virginia State Capitol in Richmond). In May 1924, the GWMNMA resodded the terrace and spent $6,000 on a new gateway and entrance to the memorial at the foot of Shooter's Hill.\nThe 1924 construction year ended in December with the installation of eight green marble columns (each weighing ) in the first floor atrium. Each column was high and in diameter, and arrived at Alexandria's Union Station by train from Redstone, New Hampshire. One columnar section was damaged, and given to the Ladies Auxiliary of the Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW). The VFW turned it into a memorial to American war dead, and erected it in front of Alexandria's Union Station. In December 1924, it was estimated that the building would be complete in three to six years.\n\nWork on the building slowed in 1925 due to the difficult nature of completing the roof and raising the tower. About of pink Conway granite (also quarried near Redstone) was received in May 1925 and used to build the memorial hall on the second floor. The walls of the hall were already high, and about of granite needed to be raised on the northeast and south sides of the hall to complete them. (They were when finished in December 1925.) Sixteen columns of St. Genevieve marble, quarried in Missouri, were procured and placed around the perimeter of the second floor auditorium to help support the auditorium roof. Each column was high and in diameter, and weighed . Once the columns were in place, a jack arch was constructed above them. The arch had two cross-members (each consisting of five stones weighing a total of ) supported by four wide, long steel rods placed in shallow grooves on the underside. The GWMNMA anticipated spending $595,000 in construction funds in 1925, and raised another $500,000 in cash donations.\n\nIn 1926, the GWMNMA appropriated another $500,000 to continue construction on the memorial. The first event held in the memorial was the February 22, 1926, GWMNMA annual meeting. The group reported that $2 million in cash donations had been received thus far, and $1.8 million expended. Eight pink Conway granite columns—each high and weighing —for the portico were raised into position in October 1926, nearly completing this portion of the structure. Also nearing completion was a massive bas-relief sculpture of Washington's head in profile, designed by sculptor Gail Sherman Corbett (wife of architect Harvey W. Corbett). G. Fred Coles, who helped execute the statue of Abraham Lincoln at the Lincoln Memorial, did the carving of the sculpture on-site in the summer of 1927 from Corbett's maquette.\n\nAt the group's February 1927 meeting, the GWMNMA officers reported raising another $125,000 in cash donations. Six months later, the roof over the first three floors was put in place. The concrete roof was designed by Gunvald Aus, who also designed the Woolworth Building in New York City. Pouring of the concrete roof began on August 22, 1927, and was completed on August 30. Steel for the roof was provided by Concrete Steel Co. of Washington, D.C. The Vulcanite Portland Cement Co. of Philadelphia provided the cement, and Cranford Construction Co. poured the roof. A total of of steel reinforcing rods were used in the roof, which contained of concrete. The roof was wide and long—reportedly the largest concrete roof in the world at the time. The roof was supported by four steel-reinforced concrete beams, each beam long and deep. Each beam varied from in thickness, contained of steel reinforcing rods, and weighed ). The beams were supported at the front of the building by four of the pink Conway granite columns. At the four corners of the roof were concrete piers, each in size. Spandrel beams between the columns— wide at the bottom, wide at the top, and deep—also supported the roof. The roof was waterproofed, sealed, and covered with copper sheeting by the New York Roofing Co. and the Ehret-Warren Co. In August 1927, it was believed the building would be finished in another three to five years.\n\nAt its February 1928 annual meeting, the GWMNMA agreed to spend another $500,000 in the coming year on construction costs. The association also agreed to increase the endowment fund to $1.5 million, for a total cost of building, grounds, and endowment of $5 million. At this time, it was estimated that the building could be completed if another $500,000 was raised in 1929. The Grand Lodge of the state of Virginia announced at the meeting that it had agreed to fund the construction of bronze doors for the memorial at a cost of $10,000. At the close of the meeting, the GWMNMA established a formal dedication date of 1932 for the memorial.\n\nIn February 1929, the GWMNMA learned that $400,000 in cash donations were received in 1928. When work on the structure began again in March 1929, the terrace and lawns were resodded. The first Masonic degrees were conferred in the unfinished memorial in mid-October 1929. The first Blue Lodge meeting to be held at the memorial occurred on November 14, 1929. With so many skilled workers unemployed due to the Great Depression, the association was able to hire more men at lower wages than before. By February 1930, the tower section had risen to above elevation, more than the construction schedule anticipated. At the GWMNMA annual meeting, the association voted to establish a $1 million endowment fund to maintain the memorial after it was completed. In 1930, the association spent $225,000 on the memorial. That same year, GWMNMA President Watres donated a large Celesta-like set of chimes for the memorial's tower. The tower was completed, and floors for the eighth, ninth, and tenth levels installed.\n\nWork on the exterior of the memorial ended on February 8, 1931. The Grand Chapter of Virginia of Royal Arch Masonry donated the aluminum double-keystone symbol and light at the top of the building. The fixture, the largest of its kind in the world at the time, was in place by February 1929 but not yet illuminated (as exterior lighting systems were still being installed). The $17,000 light fixture is high, made of aluminum, and has its own independent power supply. Claude Haynes, a steelworker employed on the memorial since 1923 and a member of Alexandria-Washington Lodge No. 22, completed the light by installing the aluminum sheeting on it on February 8. Construction of decorative items, flooring, landscape drainage, marble walls, and plumbing continued throughout 1931 and was expected to be complete by February 1932. Work on the outbuilding housing the memorial's boiler room began in late March 1931. The brick building was constructed by the Temple B. Greenstreet Co. of Washington, D.C., and the brick smokestacks built by the Alphonse Custodis Co. of New York. A steam tunnel square and long carried heat to the building. The outbuilding's two low-pressure boilers and the memorial's interior radiators were supplied and installed by the American Radiator Co. Interior heating and ventilation units and ductwork were provided by the B.F. Sturtevant Co., Benjamin F. Shore Co., and Buffalo Forge Co. Modern thermostats provided by Johnson Service Co. were used to control the heating and cooling. The furnaces used heating oil for fuel, and were installed by the Automatic Heating Corporation of Washington, D.C.\n\nThe George Washington Masonic National Memorial was dedicated on May 12, 1932. Planners had hoped for a dedication date of February 22, 1932—the 200th anniversary of Washington's birth. But the structure was not ready in time, as many of the interior details had not yet been agreed on or installed, electrical and plumbing work had not yet reached the third floor, and the George Washington National Bicentennial Commission had already scheduled numerous programs for February. Initially, May 13—the 325th anniversary of the founding of the English settlement at Jamestown, Virginia—was chosen as the date for the dedication. But since the number 13 was considered unlucky, May 12 was chosen instead.\n\nEven with an extra two months, the contractors still rushed to finish the building. The huge granite steps leading up to the main entrance were not in place (and would not be until 1940). Among the rooms being prepared at the last minute was the 1,000-seat circular auditorium at the rear of the second floor. Workers laid a cement floor for the auditorium (although this would later be replaced with marble). The marble wall material in the auditorium came from the Hilgartner Marble Co. of Baltimore, while the seating and woodwork came from the American Seating Co. of Grand Rapids. The fan-shaped ceiling and the frieze in the auditorium were designed by Louis Ludwig of Washington, D.C., while the installation of the ceiling and the frieze was done by the A.W. Lee Co. of Washington. Contractors were also busy installing sashes, windows and ventilation grillwork throughout the building, and laying a cement floor in the memorial hall on the second floor. Bronze was used for the sashes, doors, doorjambs and other exterior work where connection to the granite was required, and these items were installed by the William H. Jackson Co. of New York. The interior and exterior ironwork was supplied by the Alexandria Iron Works and the Washington Stair and Ornamental Iron Co. Other than the auditorium, no attempt was made to complete the first floor, the lodge rooms on the second floor or any of the tower rooms in time for the dedication.\n\nThe memorial had been constructed without incurring any debt. From the start of the project, the Masonic bodies involved in the memorial's construction resolved not to sign any contract or begin any work until the money for such efforts was in hand. At the time of the dedication, not a single bond had been sold or loan sought to fund the building's construction.\n\nA number of special events marked the dedication ceremony. More than 100 special trains carried an estimated 150,000 spectators into Alexandria. Many attendees slept in railway sleeping cars (which remained parked in the city's rail yards) because hotel accommodations were lacking. The U.S. Navy sailed the historic wooden-hulled, three-masted heavy frigate to Alexandria for the dedication. Three United States Coast Guard cutters and a U.S. Navy submarine also anchored in the Potomac River for the ceremony. The United States Post Office Department established a special temporary ceremonial post office at the site of the memorial to postmark letters and postcards with the memorial's name and location and the date of the dedication ceremony. (More than 200,000 letters were postmarked at the ceremonial station that day.) The United States House of Representatives adjourned because most House members were attending the dedication event. Most members of the United States Senate also went to the dedication, as did a number of foreign ambassadors.\n\nA continuous heavy rain dampened the May 12 festivities. Only about 20,000 people (rather than the anticipated 150,000) lined Alexandria's streets to view the parade. Originally estimated to incorporate 20,000 participants, only 15,000 marched in the parade through Alexandria to the memorial prior to the dedication ceremony. More than 5,000 U.S. military personnel and 3,000 Knights Templar (the third part of the York Rite system of Masonic degrees) marched in the procession. The contingents took more than two hours to pass the reviewing stand. Representatives from every branch of Freemasonry in the U.S. attended and many representatives from overseas Masonic lodges were also present. President Hoover and nearly his entire Cabinet attended the dedication. When the President and his party arrived at the memorial site, the \"Constitution\", the three Coast Guard ships and a battery of the 16th Field Artillery fired a 21-gun salute.\n\nDue to the heavy rain, the ceremony was moved from the portico of the memorial to the newly completed auditorium. Several items of Washingtoniana were employed during the dedication. Among these were the Bible which Washington used when initiated into Fredericksburg Lodge No. 4 in 1752, the trowel and gavel Washington used while laying the cornerstone of the U.S. Capitol building, the Bible on which Washington took the presidential oath of office and a silver urn made by Paul Revere which contained a lock of Washington's hair. A special Masonic ritual was written for the dedication. The ceremony incorporated a high model of the memorial (manufactured by inmates at the Lorton Reformatory), and the pouring of wine, oil and corn (Masonic symbols) from gold and silver pitchers onto the model. The pitchers were made by metalsmith Olaf Saugstadt. The invocation was given by the Rt. Rev. W. Bertrand Stevens, Bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Los Angeles. The benediction was given by Dr. William J. Morton, Rector of Christ Church, Alexandria (the church where Washington worshipped).\n\nConstruction on some of the exterior and nearly all of the interior of the memorial continued after its May 1932 dedication. Sheet metal for interior window sashes, doorjambs and other moldings, fixtures and fittings was provided by G.O. Robertson of Delaware; Ernest Gichner of Washington, D.C.; and the E. Van Norden Co. of New York. The Hires-Turner Glass Co. of Rosslyn, Virginia, provided the windows and stained glass. The lighting fixtures were supplied by the Sterling Bronze Works, while electrical supplies were furnished by the National Electrical Supply Co. of Washington and A.L. Ladd of Alexandria. Four firms oversaw the plumbing and sewage work: Earl Riley, the D.C. Engineering Co., Potomac Clay Works and the Thos. Somerville Co. The interior heavy hardware as well as some heavy internal equipment was supplied by Henry H. Meyer & Co. of Washington, D.C., while lighter hardware and fixtures were supplied by Worth Hulfish & Sons of Alexandria, Baldwin-Stuart Co. of Hartford, Connecticut and Sargent & Co. of New York. Many of the non-marble floors were covered in cork (provided and installed by the David E. Kennedy Co.) and carpeting was provided by Woodward & Lothrop (the department store chain). Acoustic tile was used in many rooms to dampen the echoes produced by the granite walls. This tile was provided by the George P. Little Co. Terrazzo (faux marble flooring) work was done by the V. Foscato Co. of New York. Much of the interior woodwork was supplied by W.A. Smoot & Co. of Alexandria. Interior painting was done by the W.W. MacCallum Co. of Alexandria, while the terracotta (unglazed baked ceramic) decorations were provided by Ernest Simpson of Alexandria. The aluminum for interior work was supplied by the Aerocrete Corporation and worked and molded into forms by the Aluminum Company of America. Gold vein and Tennessee pink marble were used to line the walls of the first floor atrium and the second floor memorial hall and ceilings on both floors were plastered. But by the end of 1933, no heating had been installed in the second floor hall.\n\nDespite the immediate flurry of work on the memorial after its dedication, construction and decoration of the interior slowed significantly over the next two decades. The Great Depression and World War II left both funds and building materials in short supply.\n\nThe association wished to complete the memorial hall, the north lodge room and the Alexandria-Washington replica lodge room on the second floor of the memorial. To complete the rooms and hallways leading to them would cost about $193,000. Although fund-raising for the effort began, in 1936 the organization learned that it had to complete the library and elevators in the tower first. In February 1931, Florence M. Lemert, widow of Rae John Lemert, Grand Historian of the Grand Lodge of Montana, donated more than 6,000 books and manuscripts about Masonic history and Masonry to the memorial as a means of founding a national Masonic library. With these books in danger of deterioration, a library had to be constructed immediately and at least one elevator installed in order to reach the library room in the tower. Additional landscaping had to be done in order to reduce the fire danger in the area, walls had to be erected around the land to prevent the public from cutting across the property and roads had to be re-graveled and maintained.\n\nIn 1935, the GWMNMA set aside the fourth floor as a \"States Memorial Hall\" (where each state's Grand Lodge could recognize its famous Masons), the sixth floor as a Masonic library and the eighth floor as a museum. The third, fifth and seventh floors had not yet been assigned a function. But these plans were not carried out. After the death of Louis Watres in June 1937, Dr. Elmer R. Arn, Past Grand Master of Ohio, was elected president of the association as his successor. Four large lighting sconces were added to the second floor memorial hall in 1938, with the $4,000 cost of their installation paid for by the General Grand Chapter of the Order of the Eastern Star. In 1939, the granite steps leading up to the portico, the walls containing the patio which surrounds the memorial and the stone balustrade for the granite steps were installed. Several hundred plants were also added to the landscaping.\n\nIn February 1941, the association reported its first big fundraising season since the memorial's dedication, receiving $100,000 in cash donations. In 1941, the association raised an additional $70,000, leaving it with total funds on hand of $225,000. By now, the total cost of completing the structure had risen to $6 million. The GWMNMA agreed to spend $60,000 in 1942 in order to finish the south lodge room on the second floor and dedicate it to the Blue Lodge. The sum also would cover the cost of finishing the room in the southwest corner of the second floor to house the Alexandria-Washington Lodge's Washingtoniana. Five empty lots on Shooter's Hill were also purchased in 1942, so that a large building could not be built next to the memorial. Additionally, the United States Department of Commerce provided, free of charge, equipment for lighting the building and tower as an aid to aviation. The association paid to have the equipment installed. In February 1942, Representative Sol Bloom donated an oil painting of Washington in full Masonic regalia to the memorial that year as well. Bloom was a member of Pacific Lodge No. 233 in the state of New York and had served as director of the Washington Bicentennial Commission. Artist Hattie Elizabeth Burdette painted the picture in 1932. Actor Tefft Johnson modeled for the portrait, posing in the Masonic apron and wearing the same jewel Washington himself had worn. The chair in the painting also belonged to Washington and the pedestal and background cloth belonged to the Alexandria-Washington Lodge. The painting had been used to advertise the Washington Bicentennial and Bloom donated it to the memorial in memory of his wife (who had died in 1941).\n\nThe Blue Lodge room and Alexandria-Washington Lodge replica room were finished in late 1942. During the following year, one of the granite columns in the memorial cracked and was repaired.\n\nWork on the interior did not really begin in earnest until after the war. It was not until May 1945 that the room dedicated to the Ancient Arabic Order of the Nobles of the Mystic Shrine (the Shriners) on the north side of the first floor was begun. Placed in the finished room was an original oil painting of Shrine co-founder William J. Florence (valued at $5,000), a copy of the Shrine's Ritual in the handwriting of co-founder Walter M. Fleming, a collection of jewels, and other items. In time, the Shriners would furnish two more rooms on ground floor at a total cost of $168,000. In 1946, the association received a major donation of about $154,700 which went to its maintenance fund (which now had to be at least $3 million to generate enough funds to keep the structure maintained).\n\nAt the GWMNMA's annual meeting in February 1947, the Alexandria-Washington Lodge Replica Room was dedicated. The association also voted to allot one of the rooms in the unfinished tower to the Mystic Order of Veiled Prophets of the Enchanted Realm (also known as \"the Grotto\"), which had raised $25,000 to finish the room. The Supreme Council, Scottish Rite (Southern Jurisdiction, USA) donated $100,000 to finish the north lodge room on the second floor and dedicate it to Cryptic Masonry. Prior to this donation, the association was unsure whether appendant bodies of Freemasonry should be allowed to occupy rooms in the memorial. The Southern Jurisdiction's donation effectively ended this debate. It also encouraged many Grand Lodges (state organizations) of Masonry to make large donations to the memorial, bringing new life to the memorial's fund-raising efforts. The association also agreed to expend funds to build a kitchen and dining room, hang bronze doors on the first floor and install bronze grillwork for the heating and ventilation system on the first floor. Two other major decisions were made in 1947 as well. Long-time memorial architect Harvey W. Corbett presented his plans for completing the memorial's interior and sculptor Bryant Baker discussed his plans for a life-size statue of George Washington to adorn the memorial hall. The Order of DeMolay, the young men's affiliate of Freemasonry, had won the association's approval for a campaign to raise money for a bronze statue of George Washington back in 1934. Baker proposed a marble statue that would cost $50,000 to $60,000 and stand on a pedestal worth $7,000 to $10,000. The association also began work on its first elevator. The Otis Elevator Company was awarded this contract on October 23, 1947. Designed to fit into the southeast stairwell, the company overcame the 7.5 degree incline of the stairwell by putting wheels on one side of the elevator car to keep it vertical. The memorial's dining room was completed at the end of 1947, and its first use was for a meeting of the GWMNMA in February 1948.\n\nThe Grotto dedicated its finished room (designed to house its archives) on the third floor of the building in February 1948. The association, meanwhile, outfitted the first floor auditorium with handrails and bronze windowsills and HVAC ventilation grills. The association also made the decision to begin fund-raising for a number of other projects at the memorial. These included designing, manufacturing and installing stained glass windows in the second floor memorial hall, designing and painting murals on the walls of the memorial hall, finishing the roof over the auditorium and portico, installing marble over the rough cement in the interior stairwells and replacing the large wooden doors at the memorial's entrance with bronze doors. That same year, President Harry S. Truman presented the memorial with a replica of the Great Seal of the United States which was in diameter and lit from within. The sign had originally topped of the United States Government Printing Office headquarters, but had been damaged by lightning. Removed and listed as scrap, a Freemason noticed the sign in a government warehouse and asked that it to be donated to the memorial. A presentation ceremony was set for June 24, 1948. Truman's arrival at the presentation was significantly delayed, for he had spent the morning giving military orders to begin the Berlin airlift.\n\nBy September 1949, the memorial was still \"nowhere near finished.\" None of the tower rooms in floors three through nine were finished, although the observation deck was under construction. The Scottish Rite agreed to fund the observation deck. The observation deck was accessible only by a circular stairway. In late 1949, the Cryptic Lodge Room (also known as the \"North Room\") was finished and the two elevators were installed on the north and south side of the building. The room contained seating for 450 and an organ (which was used for the first time during the room's dedication ceremony). To avoid piercing the second floor's memorial hall, the elevators slanted inward at 7.5 degrees. They were apart on the first floor, but only apart at the observation deck. They were the only slanting elevators in the world when installed, and the motors for them had to be passed up through the shafts in order to get them to the roof. Other decorative changes were made by late 1949 as well. A woven Persian carpet, the largest in the world and worth $1 million, was donated to the memorial by Sarkis Nahigian (a Masonic member from Chicago). (It was installed in the Alexandria-Washington Replica Lodge Room. But it had to be folded in order to fit in the room, which caused wear on the rug. The rug was removed after several years and reinstalled in the memorial hall on the second floor.) In the Memorial Hall, two stained glass windows designed and manufactured by Robert M. Metcalf were being installed. Bronze doors, grillwork and window sashes had been installed throughout the first floor, the first floor assembly hall was completed, the kitchen and dining room were finished, the north and south corridors on the first floor were completed and an addition to the heating plant installed. The \"Hall of Presidents\" was also finished. This walkway on the upper level of the auditorium contained plaques depicting Presidents of the United States who were Masons. The Shriners, too, completed their rooms on the first floor.\n\nAt some point during 1949, Bryan Baker's sculpture of George Washington was changed from marble to bronze. The statue and its base were both paid for that year.\n\nBaker's bronze statue of Washington was finally unveiled on February 22, 1950. President Truman, past Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of Missouri, dedicated the statue and delivered a major foreign policy address at its unveiling. The same year, muralist painter Allyn Cox was hired to paint murals throughout the memorial depicting allegorical Masonic events from history as well as scenes from the life of George Washington. The Grand Lodge of California donated the funds for these murals. Cox also designed six stained glass windows for installation above the murals, each depicting a famous Masonic patriot (such as Benjamin Franklin and Gilbert du Motier, marquis de Lafayette). The windows were executed and installed by stained glass artist Robert Metcalf.\n\nIn 1951, the General Grand Chapter of Royal Arch Masons agreed to fund the completion of the room on the fifth floor and dedicate it to Holy Royal Arch Masonry. That same year, two more Metcalf windows were installed in the memorial hall, the chimes were installed on the 10th floor, and a ladder (acting as a staircase) was placed to provide access to the 10th floor from the ninth floor. A water tank was installed on the fifth floor (to help ensure high pressure) and plumbing extended to the eighth floor, and air conditioning placed in the second floor South Lodge Room. A spiral staircase was added between the third and ninth floors to provide an emergency exit. It was also in 1951 that the Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania sponsored the completion of the memorial's sixth-floor main library. Outside the memorial, the northwest parking lot was paved and two flagpoles placed outside the main entrance.\n\nWork on the memorial continued in 1952, although most of the work was not finished until a year later. The ninth floor observation deck remained unfinished (although money had been donated to enclose it in a suicide-proof iron cage), and only two floors were open to the public. But the sixth floor library was dedicated on February 22, and later that year Allyn Cox's sketches for the memorial hall murals were approved. Finally, with the second-floor auditorium nearing completion, the memorial association authorized the expenditure of funds for the Moller Organ Co. to begin design and construction of a pipe organ for this space. By early 1953, however, the observation deck was finished and opened for use, and the second inclined elevator began to be installed. Problems with the shaft, however, delayed its completion. Additional internal construction was also completed at this time. The building plans had called for two sets of stairs to descend from the second floor's memorial hall to the first floor's assembly hall. These stairs had never been completed, however, and the space had been used for storage for years. Now funds were available to build the staircases. In order to do so, the unfinished space beneath the main portico was turned into a storage room, and the stairs were installed. Contractors also resealed the exterior of the tower and the second floor roof parapet to prevent water from leaking into the memorial. By the end of 1953, the remaining stained glass windows in the memorial hall were installed.\n\nIn 1954, the 42-rank Moller organ was installed in the main auditorium. The $50,000 for the organ had been donated by the Grand Lodge of New Jersey in 1930. The marble staircases between the first and second floors were also completed, and the fifth floor with its Royal Arch Masonry room was almost finished as well. The memorial association now began reconsidering some of its plans. It was clear now that there was no need for a \"States Remembrance Room\" on the fourth floor, and that the eighth floor did not have enough space to hold all the Washingtoniana in the possession of the Alexandria-Washington Lodge. So the association resolved to make the fourth floor a Washington museum, while leaving the eighth floor open.\n\nAllyn Cox's mural on the south wall of the memorial hall was completed in early 1955. Although a mural on the ceiling of the memorial hall had also long been planned, the association decided to forgo this. In February 1955, Theodor Vogel, Grand Master of the United Grand Lodges of Germany, presented the memorial association with intricate wood carvings depicting the Four Crowned Martyrs (in this case, Claudius, Castorius, Nicostratus, and Symphorian). The carvings were hung in the memorial library. That same year, the Knights Templar asked that their assigned room be moved from the seventh to the eighth floor. This request was quickly granted, although it left the seventh floor unoccupied. Throughout the year, Allyn Cox continued to work on murals in the Royal Arch Masonry room and on the mural on the north wall of the memorial hall. At the end of the year, the north and south steps from the parking lots to the first floor were completed. William and Annetta Childs of Oklahoma donated an electronic, automated carillon to the memorial, which was installed in the tenth floor.\n\nThe following year, the north side elevator was finally completed. With the elevators freed from the need to carry construction materials and workmen, the tower was finally opened to the public. A number of exterior projects remained, however: granite facing for the upper terrace walls, bronze trim for the main doors, bronze lighting standards for the portico, granite facing for the lower terrace walls, and granite facing for the back of the auditorium. Some interior work was also needed. For example, holes had been drilled in the marble floor of the memorial hall so that electric plugs could be installed for lighting fixtures. The unassigned seventh floor finally found a sponsor as well. That year, the Grand Central Council of Cryptic Masonry agreed to sponsor the floor, and by year's end had raised half the funds necessary to complete and furnish the floor.\n\nThe Royal Arch Room was dedicated on April 20, 1957, by Vice President of the United States Richard Nixon. The four bays in the room remained unfinished for many years, however, and were curtained off. The same year, the Southern and Northern Jurisdictions of the Scottish Rite dedicated the George Washington museum on the memorial's fourth floor (although there were no display cases or other furnishings to permit the Washington museum to open). The day before Easter (April 20), the Knights Templar dedicated their eighth floor chapel. At year's end, the second of Allyn Cox's murals for the memorial hall was completed.\n\nWork on the seventh-floor Cryptic Masonry room was well under way by late 1957 and the room was dedicated on February 12, 1958. A change was made to the portico as well that year. The portico had been designed so that large bronze plaques could be installed on either side of the main doors. Fundraising for these plaques had not gone well, leaving two gaping holes in the marble walls. The memorial association decided that marble, rather than bronze, plaques be installed in these spaces. Quotations from George Washington's Masonic correspondence were selected and inscribed on these marble plaques. Additionally, the bronze doors for both sets of elevators were also installed (at a cost of $18,000). At the end of the year, the memorial association spent more than $108,000 to finish the granite facing of the auditorium.\n\nIn 1959, a large bronze bust of Washington by sculptor Donald De Lue (commissioned by the Grand Lodge of Louisiana, and originally destined for their headquarters) was donated to the museum. The Scottish Rite offered to finance the completion of the fourth floor's museum.\n\nIn 1962, artists Dwight Franklin and Robert N.S. Whitelaw completed 12 dioramas (worth $75,000) to be placed in the assembly hall and which depicted key incidents in Washington's life. These dioramas had been part of the original decorative scheme for the memorial, with eight dioramas (two for each corner) to be placed in the assembly hall. Due to a dispute over the subject matter, 12 rather than eight dioramas were ordered. Air conditioning was added to the North Lodge (form the Cryptic Lodge) Room in 1963.\n\nBut despite these achievements, by 1964 the memorial still wasn't finished. More than 150,000 people a year were visiting the memorial, but the Washington museum was still unfinished. A major push to finish the museum came after 1966, when Washington's descendants—Anne Madison and Patty Willis Washington—donated the Washington family's collection of papers and memorabilia to the museum. The donation included a large portrait of George Washington and his family, as well as the Washington family Bible. Only after this donation was made were funds for the museum's completion finally raised.\n\nThe late 1960s saw the completion of the memorial. In February 1966, Senator Everett Dirksen (a Mason) dedicated the George Washington museum on the memorial's fourth floor. The dedication meant that the final room in the tower was now complete and open to the public. In 1967, the city of Alexandria changed the street layout around the memorial. As part of this alteration, the memorial granted the city a wide access path (or \"alley\") between the memorial's access road and Park Road. Since the back wall of the auditorium had never been faced with granite, the protruding steel reinforcing bars had rusted. These were removed in 1968, as they were no longer fit for use. Finally, in 1970, the 40-year-old oil-burning heating plant was replaced with new natural gas-burning boilers, the city of Alexandria donated a back-up electrical generator to keep the tower lit in case of blackouts, additional lighting for the tower was installed, and additional landscaping work completed.\n\nThe memorial was considered complete in 1970. However, the granite facing still remained incomplete. The memorial association finally raised the funds to finish the facing in July 1972, and the facing was finished in March 1973. The tower, too, remained only partially lit. But the Grand Lodge of New York provided the funds to finish the lighting, and the final tower exterior illumination was completed in the summer of 1973.\n\nThe George Washington Masonic National Memorial is Neoclassical in style. Portions of the building are also in the Greek Revival and Romanesque Revival styles. The columns which form the portico, are in the first floor assembly hall and the second floor main hall, and on the first tier of the tower are Doric. However, the columns on the second tier of the tower are Ionic, and the columns on the third tier of the tower are Corinthian.\n\nThe memorial consists of nine floors. The first (or \"ground\") floor appears, from the outside, to be part of the foundation. In the center of the first floor is the Grand Masonic Hall. The Grand Masonic Hall features eight large green granite columns, four on each side of the hall. The Grand Masonic Hall is long, wide, and high. The 12 dioramas commissioned in the mid-1960s are located in this hall. At the western end of the hall are short steps which lead up to an alcove in which a bronze bust of George Washington was placed in 2008. The semicircular alcove surrounding the bust contains murals depicting Masonic events in the life of Washington. For many years, the Great Seal of the United States donated by President Truman to the memorial in 1948 was displayed in this hall, but it was removed in the late 1990s. Large, medium, and small meeting rooms are on the north and south sides of the Grand Masonic Hall. All three rooms on the north side contain exhibits which document the history and activities of the Shriners. Many of the models in these rooms depict Shriner charities, and one model is a miniature mechanical version of a Shriners' parade. The medium-sized room on the memorial's southwest corner contains an exhibit about Freemasonry in general. The medium-sized meeting room (the George Washington Room) and large-sized meeting room (the Andrew Jackson Room) on the south side are generally closed to the public but can be rented as meeting space.\nThe second (or \"main\") floor appears, from the outside, to be the main level of the memorial. The Parthenon-inspired portico with its Doric columns forms the primary entrance to the memorial. The portico is supported by eight fluted columns of pink Conway granite in diameter and high, each weighing . The bas-relief medallion of Washington in profile which is incorporated into the pediment above the portico is across. Bronze doors lead the way into the memorial. Once inside the memorial, to the left is the Alexandria-Washington Lodge No. 22 Replica Lodge Room, which faithfully duplicates the look of the lodge room at the time Washington presided over the lodge. This room contains several items which belonged to Washington as well as historic items (such as furniture) from the Alexandria-Washington Lodge. Behind the Master Mason's chair in this room is the William Joseph Williams portrait of Washington in his Masonic garb. Along the south side of this floor is the South Lodge Room, which replicates the Neoclassical look of the Alexandria-Washington Lodge when it was located in the Alexandria City Courthouse. This room is used for meetings of Alexandria-Washington Lodge No. 22 as well as other Masonic lodges who wish to use it for meetings while visiting the memorial.\n\nThe main feature of the second floor is the Memorial Hall, which is long, wide, and high. Eight green granite columns (four on each side) support the roof of the Memorial Hall. Each column is high, wide at the base, and weighs . On the western end of the hall is the high bronze statue of Washington in Masonic regalia. It weighs . The floor is composed of Tennessee marble in a geometric design, and the walls are of Missouri marble. In the corners of the Memorial Hall are four high bronze lamps, donated by the Order of the Eastern Star (a Masonic social organization composed primarily of women). On the north and south sides of the Memorial Hall are murals by Allyn Cox depicting Washington attending a service at Christ Church, Alexandria and of Washington (in Masonic garb) laying the cornerstone of the U.S. Capitol building. The murals were photographed in their entirety for the first time in 2000.\n\nBehind the Memorial Hall to the west is the semicircular Memorial Theater, which was designed to seat 1,000. (After being reconfigured, it seats just 358 today.) The Memorial Theater features a fan-shaped ceiling and 16 St. Genevieve marble columns around its perimeter. Around the mezzanine are 14 bronze bas-relief portraits of Presidents of the United States who were Freemasons. Behind the stage is the portrait of Washington donated by Rep. Sol Bloom. In the balcony in the theater's eastern end is the Moller organ donated by Grand Lodge of New Jersey. On the north side on the first floor is the North Lodge Room. An open-beam arched ceiling marks this room, which is in the half-timbered style and has balconies on three sides and a stage in front. This is the meeting room of Andrew Jackson Lodge No. 120, as well as other Masonic lodges who wish to use it for meetings while visiting the memorial.\nThe tower contains the third through ninth floors. The tower is divided into four sections, each smaller in circumference than the one below. There are two floors in the first, second, and third section, but only one floor in the fourth section. The third floor contains exhibits about the history, charitable activities, and socializing that various Masonic bodies engage in. The third floor used to be solely dedicated to the Mystic Order of Veiled Prophets of the Enchanted Realm (\"the Grotto\"), and housed the organization's archives. But beginning in February 2012, the third floor was renovated to contain displays about other appendant bodies as well (although the Grotto's display in the room remains by far the largest). The fourth floor contains the George Washington Museum, which is maintained with funding from the Supreme Council of the Scottish Rite of the Southern and Northern Jurisdictions of the United States. The Donald De Lue bronze statue of Washington is located in the museum, which also contains many items used or owned by Washington. The fourth floor is double the height of the third floor, with a mezzanine that contains additional exhibits. The fifth floor is the same height as the third floor, and is dedicated to exhibits and symbols important to Royal Arch Masonry. This floor is in the Egyptian Revival and ancient Hebraic architectural styles. It also contains a replica of the ark of the covenant (curtains automatically open and close to reveal the replica to visitors). The sixth floor contains the Memorial Library. This floor is double the height of the fifth floor, and like the fourth floor contains a mezzanine. The seventh floor is the same height as the third and fifth floors, and is dedicated to Cryptic Masonry (the second part of the York Rite system of Masonic degrees). The room is a symbolic replica of the legendary crypt beneath the Temple of Solomon where secrets and treasures were kept. It also contains murals which depict key events mentioned in Cryptic initiation rituals (such as the murder of Hiram Abiff, architect of Solomon's Temple). The eighth floor is the same height as the seventh floor, and contains a chapel dedicated to the Knights Templar. It is in the early French Gothic architectural style. Like the fourth and sixth floors, it is double the height of the third and fifth floors but it lacks the mezzanine found on the fourth and sixth floors. The stained glass windows in this chapel depict four scenes from the Christian Bible: Jesus healing the blind, the Sermon on the Mount, the crucifixion of Jesus, and the ascension of Jesus into heaven. The ninth floor is the same height as the third, fifth, and seventh floors, and contains both the Tall Cedars Room and the observation platform. The Tall Cedars of Lebanon is a social group for Master Masons, and their room on the ninth floor depicts King Solomon's throne room and symbols important to this group. The observation platform, which rings the exterior of the ninth floor, is accessible only from this room.\n\nThe structure is capped by a step pyramid with seven steps. The light fixture atop the pyramid is in the shape of a double keystone (a shape which is of symbolic importance to Freemasons).\n\nThe memorial sits on of parkland. Since the GWMNMA is a nonprofit organization, the memorial and its land are not taxed. The first and second floors are open to all visitors, but visitors are required to be accompanied by a docent when visiting the other floors. Tours occur every hour. Tours were free for most of the memorial's history, but a fee began to be charged in 2010.\n\nThe George Washington Masonic National Memorial is the only Masonic building supported by all 52 grand lodges of the United States. By 1983, the memorial had 35 full-time staff and an annual budget of $500,000. At that time, each person initiated into Freemasonry in the United States paid a one-time-only $5 fee which was deposited in the memorial's building maintenance fund.\n\nBut despite this income and its endowment, the memorial faced a severe financial crisis in the 1980s. A significant decline in the number of Freemasons in the United States led to strong declines in donations to the memorial's maintenance and endowment funds. The building needed significant repairs, but making them left the maintenance fund exhausted. For the first time in its history, the GWMNMA considered taking out a loan to pay for the repairs and the upkeep of the memorial. The financial crisis was avoided when several Grand Lodges adopted a per capita assessment on their members to keep the memorial afloat, and the GWMNMA began a series of fundraisers and the sale of gifts to generate additional income.\n\nIn 1993, to make the memorial a more central part of the cultural life of Alexandria, the memorial began renting out its meeting rooms, assembly halls, and theaters to private groups for various kinds of functions. In 1994, the memorial's operating budget was $600,000. By 2000, the GWMNMA's endowment had grown to $12 million. But revenues were still inadequate. In the 1920s and 1930s, many Grand Lodges had enacted a per capita assessment on their members to provide general support for the GWMNMA. But by 2003, only one-quarter of all Grand Lodges still did so. That year, the GWMNMA began pushing Grand Lodges to assess an automatic per capita contribution again. The program met with some success. But despite this growth, in 2004 the endowment was still only half the size it needed to be.\n\nThe GWMNMA also made some organizational changes. Between 1910 and 1951, the association had had just three presidents (Shyrock, Watres, and Arn). The GWMNMA board of directors decided that imposing term limits on the office of the president would give board members a chance to become president and implement new ideas more frequently. In 2004, the GWMNMA amended its constitution to impose a limit of three one-year terms on presidents of the association. In 2008, the number of presidential terms limit was reduced further to two one-year terms.\n\nFor the calendar year 2008, the GWMNMA had 21 staff, total revenues of just over $1 million, total expenses of about $1.6 million, and total assets of about $15.8 million. The association's endowment, however, was not as robust as it had once been. About $500,000 had been spent (primarily on building repairs), and losses due to the economic downturn were significant (close to $2.7 million). The endowment had dropped from about $11.8 million at the end of 2007 to about $8.7 million at the end of 2008.\n\nMajor changes have occurred to the memorial and the nearby area since it was completed in 1970. The King Street Metro station opened about three blocks from the memorial in November 1983. Storm windows on the exterior of building were also replaced about this time, at a cost of $75,000. Microwave transmission antennas were added to the top of the memorial in 1990 to help the City of Alexandria improve police radio transmissions in the area.\n\nFor the memorial's 60th anniversary in 1992, the George Washington museum exhibited a special collection of Washingtoniana. A rhinestone Past Master's Masonic \"jewel,\" owned by Martha Washington and sold by the Washington family at the time of her death, was part of the display. Also loaned to the museum was the desk in the Maryland Statehouse on which Washington resigned his commission in the Continental Army at the end of the American Revolution. The Washington museum's collection was recataloged at this time as well. This led to some historic discoveries. It had long been known that the Washington family Bible had a half-page of the family torn out, but the recataloging discovered that one of Washington's descendants had ripped it out to go into the cornerstone of the Washington Monument on July 4, 1848. A map, hand-drawn by Washington to show the route a British military expedition took to Ohio in 1790, turned up in a desk. Also uncovered was a book on the use of artillery sent to Washington by a Scotsman, and a 1798 encyclopedia (the first printed in America) specially ordered by Washington. Researchers also uncovered a print of Washington's deathbed scene, and the stub of a candle carried by Freemasons in a ceremony after his death.\n\nIn 1999, the George Washington Masonic National Memorial was branded for the first time as a Masonic building. Although twin sidewalks used to run directly up the eastern slope of Shooter's Hill toward the memorial's front steps, these were partially replaced by curving cement paths and a large Square and Compasses (the Masonic symbol) in a landscaped setting. The new symbol cost $250,000, and is wide by long. (It is visible from aircraft landing at nearby Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport.)\n\nA number of renovations and repairs were made to the memorial in 1999 and 2000 as well. The Tall Cedars of Lebanon paid for the cleaning and restoration of its room on the ninth floor about this time. The ninth floor chapel suffered water damage in the early and mid-1990s, but the Knights Templar organization repaired and repainted this space in 1999. At the same time, the Grotto began a project to refurbish the murals and decorations in its room, while also researching and preparing for a later installation of new exhibits and displays. In the fall of 1999, the York Rite organization installed an exhibit in the south hall on the memorial's first floor which explained the rite's charities, degrees, and goals. Scheduled for completion in 2000 were a lawn sprinkler system on the east side of the hill, refurbishment of the boilers and the kitchen, installation of air conditioning in the Memorial Theater and library, upgrades to the elevators, repairs and upgrades to the electrical system, upgrades to make the memorial more ADA-compliant, removal hazardous materials (such as asbestos), repaving of driveways and parking lots, waterproofing of the portico and the tower, and a general refurbishment of the interior. The cost of these upgrades was in excess of $500,000. The same year, the memorial hired staff to begin a major renovation of the George Washington Museum and its exhibits, and began a major landscaping effort to restore the grounds to their original condition.\n\nBut despite these repairs, by 2002 the memorial still had almost $795,000 in deferred repairs. Some of the larger and more costly projects which were needed included removal and resetting of the granite front steps, purchase and installation of emergency generators, replacement of the fresh water mains, installation of a tuned mass damper to prevent wind damage to the tower, installation of emergency lighting, and a structural survey of the memorial. In 2003, the Northern and Southern Jurisdictions of Scottish Rite of Freemasonry agreed to provide $200,000 to fund the renovation of the George Washington museum. The renovations were to be completed by August 2003. In February 2004, renovations to the exhibits in the three Shriners' rooms on the first floor were also complete. By fall of that year, the sidewalks on the north side of the memorial had also been replaced, and in 2005 retaining walls around the Masonic symbol on the east side were built. Aircraft warning lights were installed atop the memorial in early 2006, and security lighting installed in the parking lots. But while welcome, these were not the major repairs the GWMNMA said it needed to make.\n\nIn anticipation of the association's 100th anniversary in 2010, the memorial underwent significant repair. The GNWMMA Board of Directors approved a significant expenditure of funds to make these changes. The Main Assembly Hall was renamed the Grand Masonic Hall, and restored to its original condition. The \"Grand Masonic Hall\" was also enclosed with glass and doors, permitting it to be used as a conference center. Air conditioning was installed throughout the building, elevators reaching to the first floor added, the roof over the second and third floors repaired, the memorial made even more handicap-accessible, the main front granite steps removed and reset, and a security and surveillance system installed. The hallways around the Grand Masonic Hall on the first floor were repainted, new lighting installed, and a new photo exhibit (\"The Golden Age of Masonic Architecture\") placed on the walls. The room containing the historic replica of the Alexandria-Washington Lodge No. 22 meeting room was also renovated and updated, to better display the Washingtoniana in the room. A new exhibit, \"The Form and Function of American Freemasonry,\" was added to the first floor to help explain what Freemasonry is and what its symbols represent. Also planned were an exhibit (intended for the Grotto's third floor room) about Freemasonry's appendant bodies and a history of the memorial and its relationship with the city of Alexandria.\n\nSeveral new exhibits and permanent displays were added to the memorial in 2010 as well. On February 22, 2010, the GWMNMA unveiled a new painting by artist Christopher Erney depicting George Washington as a Freemason. The memorial also unveiled a new temporary exhibit, \"The Freemasons' White House Stones.\" The exhibit displayed stones which had been marked with Masonic symbols by some of the Scottish workmen during the construction of the White House in the 1790s. Although some stones were permanently cemented into place in the fireplace in the White House basement kitchen, others had been unearthed during the structure's renovation from 1949–1951. President Truman sent each Grand Lodge and Masonic body in the U.S. one of these stones. The new exhibit reassembled most of these stones again in one location for the first time since 1951. A new, permanent exhibit was \"Founders' Hall,\" which featured busts of Charles H. Callahan, Thomas J. Shryock, Louis H. Watres, and Elmer R. Arn. The GWMNMA also received $50,000 from the California Grand Lodge to plant trees throughout the grounds.\n\nThe GWMNMA has voiced concern that the memorial seems isolated from the life of the city around it, and the association has worked to improve its relationship with the surrounding community. For example, in February 1994, the memorial held its first \"open house.\" The memorial was opened to the public for the first time without the need for a guide, and numerous objects and documents related to Washington from Alexandria-Washington Lodge No. 22's private collection were put on display.\n\nThe memorial also opened its grounds to archeological digs in 1994. Estimates of human occupation on Shooter's Hill go back as far as 3,000 BC. Shooter's Hill had been occupied by Native Americans, a mansion (in the 1830s and 1840s), a log cabin, Fort Ellsworth, a reservoir for the city's fresh water system, a park for outdoor dancing, and the Alexandria Golf Course among many others. Alexandria city archeologists used ground-penetrating radar to help identify sites of interest on Shooter's Hill, including a brick foundation wall. In the dig's first three seasons, a stone ax, pieces of ceramic pots, Civil War ammunition, various kinds of colored glass, a piece of jewelry shaped like a scarab, a Colonial-era mug imported from England, Native American spear points, a silver-plated spoon, a stoneware jar, and the bisque heads of dolls manufactured in Germany were found. In 2002, the memorial opened an exhibit designed to showcase some of the archeological evidence unearthed on the memorial grounds.\n\nThe memorial has been the target of criminal activity several times in its history. The first set of incidents occurred in the 1960s. Twice the Cox murals in the second floor Memorial Hall were vandalized. The first time was about 1960, when someone cut into one of the murals and removed a fist-sized portion of the canvas. The second time was in March 1965, when two portions of a mural were cut out. The vandals were not caught, but the murals were repaired. The memorial's grounds have also been vandalized numerous times. In the 1960s and throughout the 1970s, vandals uprooted trees, sawed the tops off the memorial's many evergreens (for use as Christmas trees), smashed windows with stones, held drag races on the lawns, and cut fences down for use as firewood. At one point in 1973, the vandalism was so severe that security guards with attack dogs had to patrol the grounds at night.\n\nThe memorial has also drawn unwanted attention from potential terrorists. In April 2005, Syed Haris Ahmed, a naturalized American citizen and student at the Georgia Institute of Technology, took videos of the George Washington Masonic National Memorial as well as the U.S. Capitol, the Pentagon, the headquarters of the World Bank, and other buildings and infrastructure in the D.C. area. American law enforcement authorities later learned that Ahmed had shared the video with Younes Tsouli and Aabid Hussein Khan (men later convicted of terrorism-related crimes in the United Kingdom). Ahmed was arrested in March 2006, and convicted in 2009.\n\nA scene from the 2007 mystery-adventure film \"\" was filmed in the Memorial Theater. The stage in the theater was a stand-in for a lecture hall. An additional scene was filmed in the Memorial Hall.\n\nThe memorial also figured briefly in author Dan Brown's 2009 best-selling novel, \"The Lost Symbol\". The memorial is discussed in chapter 78, but not visited by the novel's protagonists. When the book was released in 2009, the memorial attracted widespread media attention. The Discovery Channel filmed a portion of a documentary about Freemasonry at the memorial in August 2009 (it aired in October 2009). Brown himself recommended that \"The Today Show\" co-host Matt Lauer visit the memorial, and Lauer subsequently filmed a segment in the Royal Arch room (it aired September 14, 2009, the day before Brown's book was released). \"NBC Nightly News\" interviewed memorial staff around the same time, and \"Dateline NBC\" recorded a portion of a segment on Brown's book at the memorial as well (it aired October 16, 2009).\n\nC-SPAN aired a special program about the building, \"George Washington Masonic National Memorial\", on December 21, 2010 (the 100th anniversary of the creation of the memorial's governing association).\n\n\n\n"}

The airplane received full type certification from the Federal Aviation Administration on September 8, 2006. Cessna received FAA certification to fly into \"known icing conditions\" on November 9, 2006. Cessna delivered the first production LJ on November 22, 2006, the same day the FAA awarded Cessna with the necessary certification. Dave and Dawn Goode of GOODE Ski Technologies received the first retail delivered Cessna Mustang on April 23, 2007.\n\nIn 2010, Cessna launched an enhanced edition of the aircraft called the \"High Sierra\", which features higher quality cabin furnishings and enhanced avionics, including synthetic vision.\n\nCessna ended production of the design in May 2017. Production ended due to lack of customer demand for the aircraft, as a result of competition from the company's own Cessna Citation M2. The company had been selling an average of 40 Mustangs per year until the M2 was introduced in 2013 and then Mustang sales dropped to just 24 aircraft over the next three years. The M2 is a faster and larger aircraft, but can operate from similar length runways and requires the more common C/E-525 type rating, which potentially reduces training and crewing costs over the Mustang. A total of 479 examples of the Citation Mustang were produced.\n\nIn 2018, used 2009-2016 Mustangs were priced at $1.85-2.5 million.\n\n \nThe Mustang is a low-wing cantilever monoplane with a swept wing, T-tail and retractable tricycle gear. One main door is located in the forward left section of the aircraft, with an additional emergency exit on the center right section of the fuselage.\nThe Mustang, in standard configuration, has four passenger seats in the aft cabin, a toilet, and seating for two in the cockpit. \nThe airframe is primarily of aluminum alloy construction, with a three spar wing.\nPower is provided by two Pratt & Whitney Canada PW615F turbofans, mounted in pods on the aft fuselage.\nIt was built at the Cessna production facility in Independence, Kansas.\n\nLike many other light jets, the Mustang is approved for single-pilot operation.\n\nHalf of the fleet is in the U.S. and Canada, mostly operated by firms or individuals owning a single aircraft and typically flown by their owners, with some owners defraying a portion of the fixed operating costs by sharing use with air charters. Outside of North America, most are exclusively flown by third-party crews. Most of the other half of the fleet is based in Europe: 23 aircraft in the British Isles, 20 aircraft in Austria, 20 in France, 11 in Germany, six in the Czech Republic, five in Switzerland and four in Italy.

{"id": "1963457", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1963457", "title": "East Hills railway line", "text": "East Hills railway line\n\nThe East Hills railway line serves the southern and south-western suburbs of Sydney, Australia. The line opened to East Hills in 1931 and was extended to connect to the Main South line in 1987. Most services along the line form part of the Airport & South Line operated by Sydney Trains.\n\nThe East Hills line branches from the Illawarra line at Wolli Creek Junction, between Tempe and Arncliffe railway stations. From Wolli Creek, the line heads west towards East Hills, where the alignment is within 2 km of the since-constructed M5 South Western Motorway. It then turns south-west through the new suburbs of Voyager Point and Wattle Grove to meet the Main South line at Glenfield Junction. The line is four tracks between Wolli Creek junction and Revesby station, then two tracks to Glenfield junction. The bridge over the Georges River at East Hills, opened in 1987, is the only significant engineering structure on the line.\n\nProposals for a line to East Hills were first raised after World War 1 as an extension of the existing line at Bankstown. In 1923, the Railway Department put forward a proposal for a railway from Tempe to Salt Pan Creek to serve the growing town of Dumbleton (later known as Beverly Hills). Residents west of Salt Pan Creek petitioned the government to extend the line to East Hills.\n\nThe New South Wales Public Works Committee approved of construction of a railway from Tempe to East Hills in August 1924 and the bill for construction of the line passed both Houses of the state Parliament in late 1924. A ceremony at Padstow Park commemorating the turning of the first sod by the then-Premier of New South Wales Jack Lang was held in September 1927.\n\nThe initial line was to be double track between Tempe and Kingsgrove and single track beyond, although earthworks were to allow future easy duplication of the entire route. Electrification was also to end at Kingsgrove. Construction began in 1927 with the employment of 400 workers, and most of the earthworks were completed in by 1930. Station names were announced in November 1929. They were largely the same as those used today with the exception of Dumbleton (present-day Beverly Hills) and Herne Bay (present-day Riverwood).\n\nThe first section to Kingsgrove opened on 21 September 1931 as an electrified double track line from Wolli Creek Junction on the Illawarra line to Kingsgrove. \n\nThe second section, a single-track non-electrified extension to East Hills, was opened on 19 December 1931 by the then-Minister for Local Government James McGirr in a ceremony at East Hills. Points to reverse trains were provided at Kingsgrove, and a passing loop was provided at Herne Bay. Services on this section were by CPH railmotor, supplemented by through steam trains from Central in peak hours. Some electric services from Kingsgrove operated through to St James station (the City Circle was not complete at that time), however most terminated at Tempe, connecting with Illawarra line services to and from the city. Complete through service commenced in 1937. The single line between Kingsgrove and East Hills was opened for electric services on 17 December 1939.\n\nThe line was duplicated between Kingsgrove and Riverwood in 1948, with points for terminating trains provided at both stations, and a passing loop at Revesby was opened in 1956. Services generally ran all stations from East Hills via Tempe and Sydenham, to the City Circle. Occasional services terminated at Riverwood, Kingsgrove and Padstow. Most trains stopped at Erskineville and St Peters, now only served by the Bankstown line.\n\nIn 1985, the line was duplicated through to East Hills and on 21 December 1987 extended to Glenfield to connect with the Main South Line, allowing through services to and from Campbelltown. A new station was provided at Holsworthy, and East Hills station was rebuilt with the addition of a third platform. When services commenced on 21 December 1987, there were only limited services from Campbelltown via East Hills during peak hours only; however, in 1988 an all day half-hourly service was provided. Local (all stations) services generally ran every 15 minutes from East Hills.\n\nIn conjunction with the construction of the Airport Line, the section of the East Hills Line between Wolli Creek Junction and Kingsgrove was quadruplicated. Once this was opened, the running patterns of the trains on the lines changed. The \"flying junctions\" interchange near Central Station was altered to give the Airport Line its own platforms (21 & 23) at Central. Local (all stations) trains generally were timetabled to run from East Hills via the airport, peak hour express trains from Campbelltown run along the original route via Sydenham, taking the express tracks between Kingsgrove and Wolli Creek Junction.\n\nThe line as a whole suffered a substantial loss in patronage when the M5 East Tunnel opened in 2002. The tunnel joined the Eastern Distributor and M5 South Western Motorway, shortening road travel times between the city and the south west. The line was estimated to have lost 384,450 commuters over 12 months after the tunnel opened. Since that time, however, the line appears to have gained commuters again, with a reported 3.5% increase in patronage up to early 2006.\n\nAn additional platform and turn-back track was completed at Revesby as part of the Rail Clearways Program. From October 2009 it replaced East Hills as the primary turn-back point for local all-stations services on the line.\n\nA second Rail Clearways project involved quadruplicating the section of track between Kingsgrove and Revesby. This enables express services between the Campbelltown area and the city to operate separately from local services between Revesby and the city. The new tracks opened on 15 April 2013.\n\n"}

It is held on the last weekend in September and is the third race of the Cup Series playoffs.\n\nAs of the 2018 season, the event is run as a 400 kilometer (248.5 mi) race using the infield road course configuration the track calls \"The Roval\"; previously, the race was run at a distance of 500 miles using the regular oval. It is one of three races on a road course, with the other ones being the Toyota/Save Mart 350 at Sonoma Raceway and the Go Bowling at The Glen at Watkins Glen International. Of the three road-course events on the Cup schedule, this event is the longest of the three at just under 250 miles. Both Sonoma and Watkins Glen are around 220 miles in length. Chase Elliott is the defending winner of the event.\n\nThe race had been a Sunday afternoon event until 2002. That year rain delayed the start by over 3 hours, meaning much of the race was run under the lights. Thanks in large part to the ratings boost NBC received in primetime hours, NASCAR made a decision to move the race date from Sunday afternoon to Saturday night from 2003-2016. NBC retained their rights to broadcast the race, unlike in most of the night events aired in their part of the season's contract which normally aired on TNT. With the move, then-Lowe's Motor Speedway became one of only two tracks in NASCAR to have two night dates on the schedule.\n\nIn 2015 and 2016, the races on Saturday night were cancelled due to bad weather, so they were run on Sunday afternoon. In 2017, at the time of the schedule announcement, the race was scheduled for Saturday night. On April 20, the race was rescheduled for Sunday and moved from a night race to a day race. At the 2017 event, after rain caused the Xfinity series event of the Saturday afternoon to be delayed by several hours, a decision was made to move the Cup race an hour back to a 1:00 PM local time start, as more rain was expected later during the day. The race eventually concluded successfully after 3 and a half hours without the occurrence of any rain delays.\n\nStarting in 2018, the race utilizes a road course configuration of Charlotte Motor Speedway, with a race distance of over 109 laps. Ryan Blaney became the first driver to win the first Roval Cup race.\n\nIn 2020, the Bank of America Roval 400 will be moved from late September to the middle of October, and be held as the final race of the Round of 12, The Bass Pro Shops NRA Night Race at Bristol Motor Speedway will take Charlotte's former spot.\n\nOval ()<br>Race time: 2:58:35 (1964)<br>Average Speed: (1964)\n\nOval ()<br>Race time: 3:09:53 (2013)<br>Average Speed: (2013)\n\nRoval ()<br>Race Time: 3:01:34 (2018)<br>Average Speed: (2018)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe race was shown on TBS from at least the mid-1980s to 2000. From 2002 to 2006, it was shown on NBC, and from 2007 to 2014, it was on ABC.\n\nThe 2002 race was also known for beginning a practice where, if a race broadcast on a network was running long and ran into prime-time hours, the broadcast would not switch to cable. In this case, the race began as scheduled in the early afternoon but was delayed for hours due to weather. NBC did not move the race to TNT, and broadcast the race in its entirety; the race ended early Sunday evening with Jamie McMurray winning in only his second NASCAR Winston Cup start. Since ESPN took over the rights to the race and to most of NBC and TNT's former NASCAR package, that policy has been discontinued. Starting in 2015 the race will move back to NBC, after the network signed a 10-year, $4.4 Billion dollar deal with NASCAR, NBC has the rights for the final 20 races of the season(13 of 20) from the Coke Zero 400 at Daytona International Speedway and the Ford EcoBoost 400 at Homestead-Miami Speedway, this event was on ABC for several years as part of ESPN before the departure, In 2017, due to broadcasting changes, the race will move from NBC to NBCSN.\n\nThe 2005 running of the race drew ire from fans due to the broadcast policy in which a college football game cut into NBC's NASCAR slot. Due to the excessive length, the pre-race show was not broadcast at all and the network finally started it as the field came to the green flag to begin the race.\n\nThe 2014 race was known for the broadcast policy that drew the ire of fans once again. Because of the excessive length of the Baylor-TCU ESPN College Football game, the race would be shifted to ESPNEWS. But the station was airing an NBA preseason game between the Cleveland Cavaliers and Miami Heat from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, that ran long into overtime. The race broadcast started on Lap 27.\n\n\n"}

The line is the third commercially operated maglev line in history (after the British Birmingham Maglev and the German M-Bahn), the oldest commercial maglev still in operation, and the first commercial high-speed maglev with cruising speed of . \nIt is also the fastest commercial electric train in the world.\n\nThe train line connects Shanghai Pudong International Airport and Longyang Road Station (in the outskirts of central Pudong), where passengers can interchange to the Shanghai Metro to continue their trip to the city center. The line is not part of the Shanghai Metro network, which operates its own service to Pudong Airport from central Shanghai and Longyang Road Station. It cost $39.759 million per kilometer to build. The line's balance of payments has been in huge deficit since its opening.\n\nFrom 2004 to 2006, Shanghai Maglev Transportation Development Co. Ltd, the company which runs the line, had more than one billion RMB in losses. The line's lack of profitability derives from its construction as a test project for the future of China's rail infrastructure, rather than as a viable market solution for the needs of travelers.\n\nThe line runs from Longyang Road station in Pudong to Pudong International Airport; The Pudong International Airport station provides a transfer to Line 2, but the Longyang Road station provides access to Line 2, Line 7 and Line 16. At full speed, the journey takes 7 minutes and 20 seconds to complete the distance of , although some trains in the early morning and late afternoon take about 50 seconds longer. A train can reach in 2 minutes, with the maximum normal operation speed of reached thereafter.\n\nHans-Dieter Bott, vice president of Siemens that won the contract to build the rail link, stated that \"Transrapid views the Shanghai line, where the ride will last just eight minutes, largely as a sales tool. This serves as a demonstration for China to show that this works and can be used for longer distances, such as Shanghai to Beijing\". However, the decision was eventually made to implement the Beijing–Shanghai high-speed railway with conventional high-speed technology. Plans for a shorter maglev extension from Longyang Road to Hangzhou, the Shanghai–Hangzhou maglev line, have been suspended.\nSpeculation that a line would be built from Shanghai to Beijing mounted in 2002. It would cover a distance of about , at an estimated cost of £15.5bn. The chief executive of ThyssenKrupp, Dr Ekkehard Schulz said he was certain that not only Germany, but many countries would follow the Chinese example. The German government along with a selection of German companies sought to win more projects for their maglev technology, and highlighted that a train between Shanghai and the Chinese capital, Beijing remained a possibility. However, no projects have been revealed as of 2014.\n\nConstruction of the line began in March 1, 2001, and public commercial service commenced on 1 January 2004. The top operational commercial speed of this train is , making it the world's fastest train in regular commercial service since its opening in April 2004. During a non-commercial test run on 12 November 2003, piloted by Jonathan Texiera, a maglev train achieved a Chinese record speed of . The Shanghai Maglev has a length of , a width of , a height of and a three-class, 574-passenger configuration.\n\nThe train set(rake)model (SMT Transrapid) was built by a joint venture of Siemens and ThyssenKrupp from Kassel, Germany and based on years of tests and improvements of their Transrapid maglev monorail. The Shanghai Maglev track (guideway) was built by local Chinese companies who, as a result of the alluvial soil conditions of the Pudong area, had to deviate from the original track design of one supporting column every 50 metres to one column every 25 meters, to ensure that the guideway meets the stability and precision criteria. Several thousand concrete piles were driven to depths up to 70 metres to attain stability for the support column foundations. A mile-long, climate-controlled facility was built alongside the line's right of way to manufacture the guideways. The train was manufactured in Germany by Seimens-Thyssenkrupp JV(Joint venture)\n\nThe electrification of the train was developed by Vahle, Inc. Two commercial maglev systems predated the Shanghai system: the Birmingham Maglev in the United Kingdom and the Berlin M-Bahn. Both were low-speed operations and closed before the opening of the Shanghai maglev train.\n\nThe train was inaugurated in 2002 by the German chancellor, Gerhard Schröder, and the Chinese premier, Zhu Rongji.\n\nThe line is operated by Shanghai Maglev Transportation Development Co., Ltd and runs from 06:45 to 21:30, with services every 15 to 20 minutes. A one-way ticket costs ¥50 (US$8), or ¥40 ($6.40) for those passengers holding a receipt or proof of an airline ticket purchase. A round-trip return ticket costs ¥80 ($12.80) and VIP tickets cost double the standard fare.\n\nFollowing the opening, overall maglev train ridership levels were at 20% of capacity. The levels were attributed to limited operating hours, the short length of the line, high ticket prices and that it terminates at Longyang Road in Pudong – another 20 min by subway from the city centre.\nTwo additional one-way scheduled trains starts off at 10:15 pm and 10:40 pm from Pudong Airport to Longyang Road for about 8 minutes since October 2016.\nTravel time was sped up considerably, as the journey takes 45 minutes by road.\n\nA 2007 statement by Transrapid USA said with 4 million passengers in 2006 the system was able to cover its operating costs. The ratio of costs were given as: 64%-energy, 19%-maintenance & 17%-operations/support services; no amount was given. The high proportion of energy costs was attributed to the short trip time and high operating speed.\nHowever, according to Chinese media's report, due to the huge costs of operating and the lack of the passenger flow, Shanghai Maglev Transportation Company would lose 500 million to 700 million RMB every year.\n\nThe Shanghai Transrapid project took ¥10 billion (US$1.33bn) and two and a half years to complete. The line is track and has a further separate track leading to a maintenance facility.\n\nIn January 2006, the Shanghai–Hangzhou maglev line extension project was proposed by the Shanghai Urban Planning Administrative Bureau. The extension would continue the existing line towards Shanghai Hongqiao International Airport, running via Shanghai South Railway Station and the Expo 2010 site, with a possible continuation towards Hangzhou. The extension would allow transferring between the two airports—located apart—in approximately 15 minutes.\n\nThe plan for the extension to Hangzhou was first approved by the central government in February 2006, with a planned date of completion in 2010. Work was suspended in 2008, owing to public protests over radiation fears\ndespite an environmental assessment by the Shanghai Academy of Environmental Sciences saying the line was safe and would not affect air and water quality, and noise pollution could be controlled.\nAccording to China Daily, as reported on People's Daily Online 27 February 2009, the Shanghai municipal government was considering building the maglev line underground to allay the public's fear of electromagnetic pollution and the final decision on the maglev line had to be approved by the National Development and Reform commission.\n\nAnother approval was granted in March 2010, with construction to begin in late 2010.\nThe new link was to be long, longer than the original plan. The top speed is expected to be but limited to in built-up areas.\n\nIn October 2010 the non-maglev Shanghai–Hangzhou High-Speed Railway was opened, bringing travelling time between the two cities down to 45 minutes. Consequently, plans for a Maglev link have been suspended again.\n\nIn addition, a new express\nAirport Link line (机场联络线), which began construction in June 2019 and is due for completion in 2024, would likely stop any future extension.\n\nOn 11 August 2006, a Maglev train compartment caught fire at 14:40, after having left Pudong International Airport in the direction of Pudong Longyang Road Station. There were no injuries aboard. Preliminary reports indicated that an electrical problem may have been the cause.\n\nOn 14 February 2016, the Shanghai maglev line had an equipment failure which affected operation for more than 1 hour. Due to the use of single-line operation during this time, the train interval was extended.\n\n\n"}

Her parents divorced in 1972 and she split her time with her mother in Los Angeles, California and her father in Sacramento, California. When Brandt was 12 years old, she met comedic actor Jon Lovitz, who at the time was in a Groundlings class with American Girls bandmate Hillary Matthews. Brandt and Lovitz became friends.\n\nAt age 18, Brandt appeared as the \"Playmate of the Month\" and cover girl for the October 1987 \"Back To Campus\" issue of \"Playboy\" magazine. She also appeared in Playboy \"Blondes, Brunettes, Redheads\" magazine and on the cover with Debi Nicole Johnson and Sandra Wild.\n\nShe was the cover model for Playboy's August 1989 \"Women Of Wall Street\" issue and appeared on the cover of the March 1990 issue with Donald Trump.

{"id": "1963466", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1963466", "title": "Fazal Mahmood", "text": "Fazal Mahmood\n\nFazal Mahmood (Punjabi, ), (18 February 1927 – 30 May 2005) was a Pakistani cricketer. He played in 34 Test matches and took 139 wickets at a bowling average of 24.70. The first Pakistani to pass 100 wickets, he reached the landmark in his 22nd match.\n\nFazal played his earliest first-class cricket for Northern India in the Ranji Trophy and strong performances there led to selection for India's inaugural tour of Australia in 1947–48. The independence of Pakistan, prior to the tour led Fazal, a Muslim, to withdraw and choose Pakistan. He played a major role in first gaining Test status for the new nation and then establishing them as a Test match team. He took ten wickets in a Test on four occasions; those against India, England and Australia coming in Pakistan's maiden victories over those teams. Fazal's most memorable performance came on the 1954 tour of England, when he had a leading role as Pakistan won at The Oval to square the series. He took match figures of 12/99, including 6/46 in the second innings as England collapsed chasing a target of 168.\n\nSucceeding Abdul Kardar as captain, Fazal led the national team in 10 matches between 1959 and 1961. He had immediate success against the West Indies but after losing to Australia and a stalemate with India he was sacked as captain. In all Pakistan won two Tests and lost two under his leadership. He retired from Test and first-class cricket following the 1962 tour of England when he was called up to replace injured opening bowlers.\n\nBorn in Lahore, Fazal attended Islamia College, Lahore, from the age of 13. His father, Ghulam Hussain, was a Professor of Economics at the College as well as being president of the College's cricket club. Before settling for a career in academia, and despite passing the competitive Indian Civil Service exams, Ghulam Hussain joined the independence movement under the Islamic scholar and revolutionary activist Ubaidullah Sindhi, hoping to throw the British colonialists from a base in Afghanistan through an armed struggle. He set Fazal a stringent training routine which involved waking at 4:30 am, walking five miles and running five miles. This schedule was adhered to for seven years. Fazal made the College first team in his second year and at the age of 15 took 5/13 in an inter-college final, a record for the tournament.\n\nIn March 1944, Fazal, aged 17 and still at college, made his first-class debut for Northern India. In a Ranji Trophy match against Southern Punjab he batted at number eleven scoring 38 not out and taking three wickets. His maiden first-class wicket was that of India Test all-rounder Lala Amarnath. In Fazal's second appearance, a semi-final against Western India, he claimed eight wickets including 6/65 in the first innings.\n\nAfter a quiet 1944–45 season, in which Fazal took five wickets at 18.20, his performances the following season almost led to a place on the 1946 tour of England. Playing in the Zonal Quadrangular Tournament, a competition which acted as a trial for the tour, he opened the bowling for North Zone with Amarnath and took match figures of 9/83. Indian captain Nawab of Pataudi wanted Fazal in the squad but he was considered too young by the other selectors. On the tourists return home they played two matches against a Rest of India XI, Fazal took seven wickets in the first match which the Rest won but was expensive in the second. Later in the 1946–47 season his batting abilities were displayed when he scored his first and only first-class century. Playing for North Zone he scored exactly 100 not out from number eight, sharing in a 207-run seventh wicket partnership with Gogumal Kishenchand. North Zone won the match comfortably with Fazal contributing six wickets. He took a further five wickets in the final but North Zone lost by an innings. The zonal tournament had again acted as a trial, on this occasion for the country's inaugural tour of Australia in 1947–48. Fazal was included in the squad and attended the training camp, however before the tour began independence intervened and as a devout Muslim Fazal withdrew.\n\nThe maiden first-class match in the newly formed country took place on 27 December 1947 between Punjab and Sind. Fazal played for Punjab, taking six wickets and scoring 60 in an innings victory. The match was the first time that Fazal opened the bowling alongside Khan Mohammad, his future new ball partner for Pakistan. The first international visitors to Pakistan were West Indies in November 1948. The last of three fixtures was against a representative side which contained Fazal, he failed to take a wicket in a drawn match. At the end of the 1948–49 season Pakistan toured Ceylon for four matches, Fazal was the leading wicket-taker with 20 wickets. On the return tour a year later he took 16 wickets in two matches.\n\nA MCC side toured the subcontinent in 1951–52, playing a number of fixtures in Pakistan. In the first match against Punjab they were nearly forced to follow on after Fazal took 5/58. The fifth and final match of the tour was against a Pakistan side on a coir matting wicket at Karachi, Fazal exploited the surface to return figures of 6/40 in the MCC's first innings. The hosts went on to win by four wickets, a victory that played a large part in Pakistan gaining Test status. Pakistan were made Test members on 28 July 1952, less than five years after independence.\n\nIn October 1952, Pakistan began their first Test series against India. Fazal made his Test debut in the first match at Delhi, taking 2/92 in India's first innings, his maiden wicket was Indian captain, Lala Amarnath. Pakistan were dismissed cheaply twice to lose by an innings, Fazal was the only Pakistani player to reach double figures in both innings. Pakistan reversed the result in the second Test at Lucknow, played on a jute matting pitch Fazal took 5/52 in the first innings and 7/42 in the second as Pakistan won by an innings in only their second ever Test. His match figures of 12/94 are the best by a Pakistani bowler away from home, and were the best by any bowler against India until 1980. In the third Test at Bombay Fazal was wicketless as Pakistan lost by ten wickets, although in their first innings he scored 33 batting at number eight, helping Pakistan recover from 60/6 to 143/7. The final two Tests of the series were drawn, Fazal took six further wickets to finish his maiden series as Pakistan's leader wicket-taker with 20 at 25.60. He also made some lower order contributions finishing with a series total of 173 runs at 28.83.\n\nA Pakistan Eaglets side, containing Fazal, was sent to England in 1953 in preparation for the following year's tour of the country. While in England, Fazal received coaching from retired England and Surrey fast bowler Alf Gover.\n\nFazal was made vice-captain to Abdul Kardar for the 1954 tour which would prove a success for both player and team on their first series outside the subcontinent. Fazal began the tour well, taking 11/102 and scoring 67 in the tourists first match against Worcestershire. He continued to take wickets in the lead up to the Test series, and also demonstrated his ability to bowl long and economical spells particularly against Oxford University where he bowled 37 maidens in 68 overs taking 7/95 in the process.\n\nThe first Test at Lord's was heavily affected by rain and drawn, batting was difficult in the play that was possible and Pakistan were dismissed for 87 in their first innings. England in response scored 117/9 declared with Fazal and Khan Mohammad bowling throughout the innings, Fazal recording figures of 4/54. In the tour match before the next Test Pakistan played Nottinghamshire at Trent Bridge, the tourists won by eight wickets with Fazal taking 11 wickets including a then career best 8/66 in the first innings. The second Test was at the same venue but saw contrasting fortunes as the Pakistanis suffered a heavy innings defeat and Fazal recorded his worst Test figures of 0/148. Although he was suffering with a leg injury which forced him to shorten his run-up. Pakistan faced another innings defeat after three days of the third Test but the match was drawn after rain stopped any play on the final two days, Fazal took 4/107 from 42 overs in England's innings.\n\nPakistan went to the fourth and final Test at The Oval 1–0 down but caused a major upset by beating England to level the series, it was the first occasion that a country had won a Test in England on their inaugural tour. Fazal played a leading role in the victory claiming match figures of 12/99. In England's first innings he bowled throughout taking 6/53 from 30 overs, \"Wisden\" wrote the figures 'would have been much better but for dropped catches'. In a low scoring match, England were set a target of 168 in their second innings. Despite the early loss of Len Hutton, for the second time in the match caught behind off the bowling of Fazal, at 109/2 England looked well set on the fourth evening. However Fazal took the wickets of Peter May, Godfrey Evans and Denis Compton before the close and the next day took the first two wickets to fall as Pakistan completed a 24-run victory. Fazal's finished with second innings figures of 6/46 from 30 overs.\n\nIn the series Fazal took 20 wickets, 12 more than the next best Pakistani bowler, at an average of 20.40. He played in only one of the six first-class matches that concluded the tour but still finished as leading wicket-taker with 77 at 17.53. In recognition of his feats, Fazal was named a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1955, the first Pakistani to be honoured.\n\nPakistan's first home series came in the 1954–55 season with the visit of India for five Test matches. The series was marked by defensive and dull cricket with all five matches being drawn, the first occurrence of this in Test history. Fazal played in four of the matches and took 15 wickets at 21.93. His best figures came in the fifth Test at Karachi where he took 5/48 in India's first innings.\n\nLater in 1955 New Zealand made their maiden tour to the country, Pakistan completed a first Test series victory, winning 2–0. Fazal played in two of the three Tests and took five wickets at 18.40.\n\nAustralia was the next visitors to Pakistan, touring in October 1956 for a single Test prior to their series in India and following the tour of England. In the match at Karachi, Pakistan secured a historic victory in their first Test against Australia. Fazal played a major role in the win, taking Test best figures of 13/114. He took the first six wickets to fall in Australia's first innings leaving the tourists on 52/6, a position they failed to recover from, they were 80 all out. He also took the first four wickets in the second innings and finished with 7/80. \"Wisden\" described his technique: \"maintaining an accurate length and varying his swing with a mixture of leg-cutters and breakbacks\". Imtiaz Ahmed said that: \"Fazal never wavered in length and direction, and he moved the ball both ways intelligently...For one whole over from Fazal in the first innings, even the great Miller had no clue.\"\n\nPakistan's tour of the West Indies in 1958 was marked by a number of high scoring Test matches and Fazal had a large workload, sending down over 320 overs in the five Test series including 186 in consecutive Tests. Pakistan lost the series 3–1 and only avoided defeat in the first Test thanks to the 16-hour innings of 337 by Hanif Mohammad. In the second Test at Trinidad Fazal was Pakistan's most economical bowler collecting six wickets in the process, while as batsman he scored 60 from number 10, his highest Test score and only fifty at international level. The third Test at Kingston was historic as Gary Sobers scored 365 not out, breaking the Test record for highest individual score. Injuries to fellow opening bowler Mahmood Hussain and spinner Nasim-ul-Ghani meant that Fazal sent down 85.2 overs, what \"Wisden\" described as 'a phenomenal number of overs for a bowler of his pace'. Fazal conceded 247 runs in the innings and took the only two wickets to fall. Fazal's bowling analysis places him fifth in Test history for most overs bowled and most runs conceded in an innings. Pakistan lost the Test by an innings and by losing the next match in Guyana they lost the series. Pakistan achieved a consolation victory in the fifth Test, Fazal taking 6/83 in the first innings including the wicket of Conrad Hunte with the first ball of the match. Fazal finished the series with 20 wickets at 38.20, despite being one of his worst in terms of average, he was still Pakistan's leading wicket-taker.\n\nBy the time of the return tour the following year, Abdul Kardar, captain of Pakistan since their Test election, had retired from Test cricket. Fazal, the nation's leading bowler, succeeded him in the role. In his first Test as captain he won the toss and decided to field, opening the bowling he took the wicket of Conrad Hunte in the first over for the second successive Test. Fazal finished the innings with figures of 4/32 which also included dismissing Gary Sobers for a duck. Fazal took three further wickets in the second innings including both Hunte and Sobers, the latter's wicket was Fazal's 100th in Test cricket, the first Pakistani to reach the landmark. Pakistan completed a ten wicket victory to give their new captain a winning start. Pakistan also won the next Test at Dhaka and therefore completed a series win in the three match rubber. In a low scoring match Fazal played an instrumental role, taking ten wickets in a match for the fourth time in Tests. Put in to bat, Pakistan recovered from 22/5 to make 145. West Indies fared worse, being dismissed for 76 following a collapse of six wickets for 11 runs. Fazal bowled throughout the innings, taking 6/34. West Indies, set 214 in their fourth innings, fell 41 runs short. Fazal taking six of the first seven wickets, the other dismissal that of Sobers by Mahmood Hussain involved Fazal as the catcher. Mahmood finished off the tail to claim four wickets while Fazal ended with figures of 6/66 and a match analysis of 12/100. The latter were the best figures by a bowler whilst captain until 1993, when bettered by Waqar Younis. The third Test, a dead rubber, was won by the West Indies. Fazal dismissed both openers but these were his only wickets in 40 overs. He was the leading wicket-taker in the series with 21 at 15.85.\n\nAustralia toured Pakistan at the end of 1959 for a three Test series which they won 2–0, Pakistan's first series defeat at home. In the first Test at Dacca the tourists won by eight wickets, Fazal claimed six wickets including a first innings five-for, 5/71. He missed the second Test at his home city of Lahore, wicket-keeper Imtiaz Ahmed taking over captaincy duties in a match Australia won by seven wickets. Fazal returned for the third Test in Karachi and took another five wicket haul with 5/74 in Australia's first innings. Pakistan gained a lead on first innings but after three early wickets their second innings slowed and the match petered out to a draw. Despite missing a match Fazal was Pakistan's leading wicket-taker for the series, taking 11 at 19.36. These efforts led him to achieve the number 1 ranking in ICC Test Bowlers ranking for 1959.\n\nPakistan toured India during the 1960–61 season but with little reward as all 15 matches on their tour, including five Tests, were drawn. Just as seven years previous, the series contained dour and defensive cricket as both sides appeared intent on avoiding defeat rather than attempting to win. Fazal won the toss in the first four Tests but only in the third Test at Eden Gardens did Pakistan gain a first innings lead. In that match Fazal took 5/26 off 25.3 overs, but he failed to take a wicket in India's second innings as they batted out time comfortably. Apart from that five-for, his 13th and last in Test cricket, Fazal took only four other wickets in the series. Fazal's captaincy received severe criticism with accusations of favouritism, and following the final Test he was sacked as captain.\n\nFazal wasn't initially selected by Pakistan for the home series against England but returned for the final Test. He was as economical as ever, conceding 98 runs from his 63 overs, but failed to take a wicket. He wasn't included in the 1962 tour squad to England but was called up as a replacement when fast bowlers Mahmood Hussain and Mohammad Farooq broke down injured. The five match series already lost, Fazal came into the team for the fourth Test at Trent Bridge. He shouldered much of the workload, bowling for all but 30 minutes of the second day and continuing throughout on the third morning until the England declaration, from his 60 overs he took 3/130. In the fifth Test at The Oval, he was expensive taking 2/192 from 47 overs, the two wickets, which proved to be his last in Test cricket, were those of Colin Cowdrey (182) and Ted Dexter (172).\n\nFazal spent three seasons as the professional with the East Lancashire Cricket Club in 1957, 1958, and 1959. Playing against albeit excellent amateur cricketers his bowling was devastating. In three memorable seasons he took 4 hat-tricks, with 8 wickets on 2 occasions and 7 wickets on 6 occasions, including 7 for 9 in 1959, and 7 for 26 in 1957.\n\nAfter leaving Islamia College with a master's degree in Economics, Fazal joined the Pakistan Services as an Inspector of Police in 1947 rising to Deputy Superintendent in 1952 and Deputy Inspector General in 1976.\n\nDue to his good looks, he had many movie offers : during Pakistan's first tour of India, in 1952-1953, famous director Mehboob Khan offered him a second-lead role in the movie \"Aan\" (1952), while well-known American director George Cukor, while on a visit in Lahore and meeting Mahmood, said he would have preferred him as the lead role in his 1956-movie \"Bhowani Junction\", instead of Stewart Granger. He refused them to concentrate on cricket.\n\nQuitting cricket, he also became more religious in his outlook, and notably published, in 1970, the book \"Urge To Faith\", where he outlines his vision of applying Islamic principles to the economy and social system of Pakistan, and which has been described by journalist Peter Oborne as \"a meditation on religion, philosophy and politics. The book demonstrates a profound faith and learning, containing many relevant quotations from the Quran. Fazal doubted whether ‘a democracy of western type’ was capable of bringing about Islamic justice.\" He also acted as a muezzin for the local mosque in his old age, and established a school for girls, the \"Sidra Model School\", using the plot of rural land he was gifted after the 1954 Oval victory.\n\nHis autobiography has been published by the Oxford University Press, in 2003, as \"From Dusk to Dawn: Autobiography of a Pakistan Cricket Legend\".\n\nFazal suffered a fatal heart attack at his Lahore residence on 30 May 2005. His friend and former teammate Hanif Mohammad described Fazal as a \"great human being\" and \"the doyen of Pakistan bowlers in the country's formative years\".\n\nFazal Mahmood married the daughter of Mohammad Saeed, Pakistani cricket's captain.\n\n\nFazal was the first bowler in the history of Test cricket to take 12 or more wickets in a Test match against four different countries, those being India, England, Australia, and West Indies.\nHe reached 100 Test wickets in 22 Tests, of Pakistan bowlers only Waqar Younis and Mohammad Asif reached the landmark quicker.\n\n"}

The school has a non-selective enrolment policy and currently caters for approximately 890 students from Year K to Year 12. The school is regularly among the top-performing schools in New South Wales. While predominantly a day school, SCEGGS offers a small number of boarding places at St Vincent's College, Potts Point.\n\nSCEGGS is affiliated with the Association of Heads of Independent Schools of Australia (AHISA), the Junior School Heads Association of Australia (JSHAA), the Alliance of Girls' Schools Australasia (AGSA), and is a founding member of the Association of Heads of Independent Girls' Schools (AHIGS).\n\nIn 2001, \"The Sun-Herald\" ranked SCEGGS Darlinghurst second in Australia's top ten girls' schools, based on the number of its alumnae mentioned in the \"Who's Who in Australia\" (a listing of notable Australians).\n\nOn 17 July 1895, a grammar school for girls was officially opened in Sydney under the auspices of the Sydney Diocese of the Church of England. The Sydney Church of England Girls' Grammar School (abbreviated as S.C.E.G.G.S.) commenced in a terrace house at 65 (now 55) Victoria Street, Darlinghurst with one pupil, Mary Watson, one teacher, Miss Janet Uther, and the Principal, Miss Edith Badham. Within a year, the school had increased to 50 pupils enrolled, and moved to \"Chatsworth\", a larger home in Macleay Street.\n\nBy 1900, the school had 100 pupils, including a Kindergarten and junior school. \"Barham\" in Forbes Street, Darlinghurst was purchased and the school moved there in 1901. The curriculum at the time included English Language and Literature, Geography, Modern and Ancient History, Latin, Classical Greek, Mathematics, French Language and Literature, German or Italian, Needlework and Drilling. Classes in Botany, Geology or other scientific subjects, were also offered to pupils who reached a fair standard of proficiency in their ordinary subjects. Classes in Cookery and Dressmaking were held whenever there was sufficient demand.\n\nS.C.E.G.G.S. continued to expand and several branch schools were opened – Bowral (1906–1929) relocated to Moss Vale (1930–1974), Hunters Hill (1912–1915), North Sydney (1911–1941) becoming Redlands (1945–1976), Wollongong (1955–1976) and Loquat Valley (1967–1976).\n\nIn 1974, financial difficulties arose due to the controller of the Anglican Diocesan schools misappropriating school funds, threatening the school with closure. Within two years, contributions from the school community and the Sydney Diocese ensured that the original school, S.C.E.G.G.S. Darlinghurst, was not closed but continued to operate. Moss Vale was forced to close in 1974, and two years later, Redlands, Wollongong and Loquat Valley became schools independent from S.C.E.G.G.S. Darlinghurst, and have been governed by their own boards ever since.\n\nA not-for-profit company limited by guarantee, S.C.E.G.G.S. Darlinghurst Ltd, was formed in 1976, under a Board of Directors, to govern the school. On the school's Centenary in 1995, the school changed its name from Sydney Church of England Girls' Grammar School, Darlinghurst (S.C.E.G.G.S.) to SCEGGS Darlinghurst.\n\nSCEGGS Darlinghurst has expanded from a terrace house in 1895 to a campus incorporating a chapel, primary school, classroom blocks, assembly hall, science and library block, auditorium, sports hall, senior study building, lecture theatre, play house, Great Hall and performing arts centre and many more. From 1965 to 1983, a preparatory school was operated at Bellevue Hill for boys and girls up to Kindergarten age. A new music centre has also been added, including a renovated church to be used for performances etc.\n\nThe house system was introduced in 1926 by Miss Wilkinson to help generate school spirit and sporting enthusiasm, encourage good conduct and to provide girls with opportunities for taking on responsibility. House competitions are held in various sports, in music, drama, science and debating.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

She was the sister of Norman Selfe and a cousin of Eadward Muybridge, who migrated to the United States in 1850. Her family migrated to Australia as free settlers when she was nine years old. Twelve years later in September 1867 she married Edmund Kay Wolstenholme, a timber merchant. The couple had seven children between 1868 and 1879, four of them died from a heart condition before the age of five. Her son, Harry Wolstenholme, was a lawyer and keen amateur ornithologist. The Wolstenholmes built a large house called 'Maybanke' in Marrickville. The later years of the marriage were unhappy; Edmund had a number of business failures and became an alcoholic, leaving the family in 1884. Maybanke had to wait for the passage of the \"Divorce Amendment and Extension Act\" in 1892 before she could divorce Edmund on the grounds of \"\"three years of desertion.\"\" The divorce was finalised in 1893. After the divorce, she was supported financially by her brother, the renowned engineer Norman Selfe, with whom she would later campaign for education reform.\n\nIn 1885 Maybanke opened Maybanke School, a girls' school that she operated in her home preparing girls for the University of Sydney entrance examination. Operating for 10 years, the school was later known as Maybanke College.\nFollowing her divorce, Maybanke took an active role in the promotion of women and children's rights. She became active in the women's suffrage movement; she believed that the vote was 'the kernel for all reform'. She was vice president of the Women's Literary Society started by her friend Rose Scott. Many of the society's members would go on to form the Womanhood Suffrage League of New South Wales (WSL) on 6 May 1891. In 1893 she was elected to the WSL presidency, and founded the Australasian Home Reading Union in the same year. The Union was a program to promote induction by organising small study groups in rural areas.\n\nIn 1894, she began publishing the fortnightly newspaper \"Woman's Voice\". The paper ran for 18 months, drawing women's attention to suffrage issues at the national and international level. In 1895 she established the first free kindergarten in Australia at Woolloomooloo as the president of the Kindergarten Union, helping the children of working mothers.\n\nThe WSL's attempts to have suffrage implemented by the New South Wales government were not fruitful; however, in 1897, Maybanke decided to petition the 1897 Federal Convention in Adelaide. She reasoned that this would have the women's vote written into the Federal agenda. Thus, the women from South and Western Australia who already had the vote could not have it taken from them, and if there was suffrage at the federal level, it would flow down to the states. At this time, she also became involved in the pro-federation movement. Maybanke resigned from the WSL in 1897. Suffrage was extended to the women of New South Wales in 1902.\n\nMaybanke was inducted onto the Victorian Honour Roll of Women in 2001 in recognition of her achievements.\n\nIn 1899 Maybanke married her second husband, Sir Francis Anderson. Anderson was the first Professor of Philosophy at the University of Sydney. They travelled and worked together on voluntary projects, including campaigning to have women stand for local government. She was active with the National Council of Women of New South Wales, and worked closely with the University Women's Society. Maybanke died in St Germain-en-Laye, Paris on 15 April 1927.\n\n\n"}

CAN was one of the original four distributed hash table proposals, introduced concurrently with Chord, Pastry, and Tapestry.\n\nLike other distributed hash tables, CAN is designed to be scalable, fault tolerant, and self-organizing. The architectural design is a virtual multi-dimensional Cartesian coordinate space, a type of overlay network, on a multi-torus. This n-dimensional coordinate space is a virtual logical address, completely independent of the physical location and physical connectivity of the nodes. Points within the space are identified with coordinates. The entire coordinate space is dynamically partitioned among all the nodes in the system such that every node possesses at least one distinct zone within the overall space.\n\nA CAN node maintains a routing table that holds the IP address and virtual coordinate zone of each of its neighbors. A node routes a message towards a destination point in the coordinate space. The node first determines which neighboring zone is closest to the destination point, and then looks up that zone's node's IP address via the routing table.\n\nTo join a CAN, a joining node must:\n\n\nTo find a node already in the overlay network, bootstrapping nodes may be used to inform the joining node of IP addresses of nodes currently in the overlay network.\n\nAfter the joining node receives an IP address of a node already in the CAN, it can attempt to identify a zone for itself. The joining node randomly picks a point in the coordinate space and sends a join request, directed to the random point, to one of the received IP addresses. The nodes already in the overlay network route the join request to the correct device via their zone-to-IP routing tables. Once the node managing the destination point's zone receives the join request, it may honor the join request by splitting its zone in half, allocating itself the first half, and allocating the joining node the second half. If it does not honor the join request, the joining node keeps picking random points in the coordinate space and sending join requests directed to these random points until it successfully joins the network.\n\nAfter the zone split and allocation is complete, the neighboring nodes are updated with the coordinates of the two new zones and the corresponding IP addresses. Routing tables are updated and updates are propagated across the network.\n\nTo handle a node departing, the CAN must \n\n\nDetecting a node's departure can be done, for instance, via heartbeat messages that periodically broadcast routing table information between neighbors. After a predetermined period of silence from a neighbor, that neighboring node is determined as failed and is considered a departing node. Alternatively, a node that is willingly departing may broadcast such a notice to its neighbors.\n\nAfter a departing node is identified, its zone must be either merged or taken over. First the departed node's zone is analyzed to determine whether a neighboring node's zone can merge with the departed node's zone to form a valid zone. For example, a zone in a 2d coordinate space must be either a square or rectangle and cannot be L-shaped. The validation test may cycle through all neighboring zones to determine if a successful merge can occur. If one of the potential merges is deemed a valid merge, the zones are then merged. If none of the potential merges are deemed valid, then the neighboring node with the smallest zone takes over control of the departing node's zone. After a take-over, the take-over node may periodically attempt to merge its additionally controlled zones with respective neighboring zones.\n\nIf the merge is successful, routing tables of neighboring zones' nodes are updated to reflect the merge. The network will see the subsection of the overlay network as one, single zone after a merge and treat all routing processing with this mindset. To effectuate a take-over, the take-over node updates neighboring zones' nodes' routing tables, so that requests to either zone resolve to the take-over node. And, as such, the network still sees the subsection of the overlay network as two separate zones and treats all routing processing with this mindset.\n\nSylvia Ratnasamy, Paul Francis, Mark Handley, Richard Karp, Scott Shenker\n\n"}

Founded in 1998 by a small group of radio activists in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Prometheus has participated in the community radio movement by providing technical training, helping marginalized communities gain access to affordable media outlets, and creating a network of low power community radio stations. A lot of Prometheus' efforts have focused on legal advocacy for low-power FM (LPFM) stations.\n\nThe Prometheus Radio Project evolved out of Radio Mutiny, an unlicensed station based in West Philadelphia which broadcast in the mid-1990s. Radio Mutiny was shut down by the FCC in 1998. In response, the Radio Mutiny organizers held a protest at Benjamin Franklin's printing press and stated that \"for every station [the FCC] harassed or shut down, we would teach people to build ten more.\" After Radio Mutiny came to an end, some of the pirate broadcasters involved formed the Prometheus Radio Project in order to advocate for new low-power FM licenses and help community groups to establish independent radio stations.\n\nIn 2003 the Federal Communications Commission, under Chairman Michael Powell, sought to significantly relax media outlet ownership regulations. In Prometheus Radio Project v. FCC, a number of broadcasters and citizens groups, including the Consumer Federation of America, the National Council of Churches of Christ, and Media Alliance, sued to prevent the FCC from following through on the decision. Prometheus was represented by Andrew Jay Schwartzman and Cheryl Leanza of the Media Access Project. On September 3, 2003, the U.S. Third Circuit Court of Appeals issued a stay which prevented the new rules from being enforced pending the outcome of the litigation. In 2004, the majority ruled 2-1 in favor of Prometheus and mandated the FCC re-examine its media ownership rules. They ruled that a \"diversity index\" used by the FCC to weigh cross-ownership (of radio, television and newspapers) employed several \"irrational assumptions and inconsistencies.\" Dissent by Chief Judge Anthony Joseph Scirica noted that the majority were simply employing their own assumptions.\n\nThe Supreme Court later turned down an appeal, so the decision stands. The FCC was ordered to reconfigure how it justifies raising ownership limits.\n\nIn the spirit of the Amish barn-raising tradition, where a community comes together and erects an essential structure, Prometheus holds radio barnraisings. These events bring together the local community with community radio advocates from around the world to build a community radio station, while advancing the movement for media democracy. Prometheus barnraisings gather Low Power FM radio advocates, journalists, radio engineers, students, lawyers, musicians, activists and other folks from across the country to build a studio, raise an antenna mast, and put the station on air for the first time – all over the course of three days. At a typical barnraising, the organization invites expert facilitators to lead workshops on a wide variety of topics, like understanding the workings of the FCC, introductions to various aspects of radio engineering, updates on media and democracy campaigns, and how radio can promote social change today. In the inclusive spirit of Prometheus's mission, the events are open to the public.\nPrometheus has held eleven community radio barnraisings to date:\nPrometheus has also been active internationally, working with groups in Guatemala, Nepal, Colombia, Jordan, Kenya, and Tanzania.\n\nFor many years, Prometheus has strived to gain community members and nonprofit groups a fair share of the radio spectrum. Most recently, Prometheus was involved in the passing of the Local Radio Community Act. The act, proposed in 2009, opened up a portion of the radio spectrum to low-power community radio stations (LPFMs). Before then, community members could apply for licenses for full-power stations, which are five to ten times as expensive as LPFMs. Those groups who did not have the capital to build a full-power station were forced into piracy.\n\nThe Prometheus Radio Project did everything possible to ensure the passage of the Local Community Radio Act. Members of the organization discovered that while the bill circulated in Congress, secret holds were put on it to prevent its passage. People who opposed the bill, like Senator Gordon Smith – the president of the National Association of Broadcasters – were persuading other senators to vote against it. The moment the Prometheus Radio Project found out about this, members began contacting all the citizens they could. They encouraged their contacts to call their senators to show they were aware of these holds. Their efforts turned out to be successful when the Local Community Radio Act was finally passed in 2010.\n\nWhat signing this act means is that “the FCC [has] a new mandate to expand low power radio,” says Brandy Doyle, Policy Director for the Prometheus Radio Project. However, the FCC will not begin to automatically handout licenses. Doyle states that “we think the FCC will need to do a rule making to clarify the intent of the new law and update the rules going forward.” (Doyle) Because of this act more groups will soon start to apply for licenses and they will need a lot of support in order to “navigate the process” says Vanessa Maria Graber, Community Radio Director at the Prometheus Radio Project. Now, however, “many low power stations are under a significant and substantive threat of encroachment.” Low Power FM Encroachment Report, 2/15/2005. Encroachment is something that Prometheus will have to work on combating next.\n\nPrometheus saw the act's passage as an opportunity to give a voice to local community radio and bring community radio to urban areas.\n\nPrometheus' current Outreach Campaign involves the contacting and support of groups wishing to attain their own low-power FM community radio station.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1963519", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1963519", "title": "History of general relativity", "text": "History of general relativity\n\nGeneral relativity (GR) is a theory of gravitation that was developed by Albert Einstein between 1907 and 1915, with contributions by many others after 1915. According to general relativity, the observed gravitational attraction between masses results from the warping of space and time by those masses.\n\nBefore the advent of general relativity, Newton's law of universal gravitation had been accepted for more than two hundred years as a valid description of the gravitational force between masses, even though Newton himself did not regard the theory as the final word on the nature of gravity. Within a century of Newton's formulation, careful astronomical observation revealed unexplainable variations between the theory and the observations. Under Newton's model, gravity was the result of an attractive force between massive objects. Although even Newton was bothered by the unknown nature of that force, the basic framework was extremely successful at describing motion.\n\nHowever, experiments and observations show that Einstein's description accounts for several effects that are unexplained by Newton's law, such as minute anomalies in the orbits of Mercury and other planets. General relativity also predicts novel effects of gravity, such as gravitational waves, gravitational lensing and an effect of gravity on time known as gravitational time dilation. Many of these predictions have been confirmed by experiment or observation, while others are the subject of ongoing research.\n\nGeneral relativity has developed into an essential tool in modern astrophysics. It provides the foundation for the current understanding of black holes, regions of space where gravitational attraction is so strong that not even light can escape. Their strong gravity is thought to be responsible for the intense radiation emitted by certain types of astronomical objects (such as active galactic nuclei or microquasars). General relativity is also part of the framework of the standard Big Bang model of cosmology.\n\nAs Einstein later said, the reason for the development of general relativity was the preference of inertial motion within special relativity, while a theory which from the outset prefers no particular state of motion appeared more satisfactory to him. So, while still working at the patent office in 1907, Einstein had what he would call his \"happiest thought\". He realized that the principle of relativity could be extended to gravitational fields.\n\nConsequently, in 1907 he wrote an article (published 1908) on acceleration under special relativity.\nIn that article, he argued that free fall is really inertial motion, and that for a freefalling observer the rules of special relativity must apply. This argument is called the Equivalence principle. In the same article, Einstein also predicted the phenomenon of gravitational time dilation.\n\nIn 1911, Einstein published another article expanding on the 1907 article.\nThere, he thought about the case of a uniformly accelerated box not in a gravitational field, and noted that it would be indistinguishable from a box sitting still in an unchanging gravitational field. He used special relativity to see that the rate of clocks at the top of a box accelerating upward would be faster than the rate of clocks at the bottom. He concludes that the rates of clocks depend on their position in a gravitational field, and that the difference in rate is proportional to the gravitational potential to first approximation.\n\nAlso the deflection of light by massive bodies was predicted. Although the approximation was crude, it allowed him to calculate that the deflection is nonzero. German astronomer Erwin Finlay-Freundlich publicized Einstein's challenge to scientists around the world. This urged astronomers to detect the deflection of light during a solar eclipse, and gave Einstein confidence that the scalar theory of gravity proposed by Gunnar Nordström was incorrect. But the actual value for the deflection that he calculated was too small by a factor of two, because the approximation he used doesn't work well for things moving at near the speed of light. When Einstein finished the full theory of general relativity, he would rectify this error and predict the correct amount of light deflection by the sun.\n\nAnother of Einstein's notable thought experiments about the nature of the gravitational field is that of the rotating disk (a variant of the Ehrenfest paradox). He imagined an observer performing experiments on a rotating turntable. He noted that such an observer would find a different value for the mathematical constant π than the one predicted by Euclidean geometry. The reason is that the radius of a circle would be measured with an uncontracted ruler, but, according to special relativity, the circumference would seem to be longer because the ruler would be contracted. Since Einstein believed that the laws of physics were local, described by local fields, he concluded from this that spacetime could be locally curved. This led him to study Riemannian geometry, and to formulate general relativity in this language.\n\nIn 1912, Einstein returned to Switzerland to accept a professorship at his \"alma mater\", ETH Zurich. Once back in Zurich, he immediately visited his old ETH classmate Marcel Grossmann, now a professor of mathematics, who introduced him to Riemannian geometry and, more generally, to differential geometry. On the recommendation of Italian mathematician Tullio Levi-Civita, Einstein began exploring the usefulness of general covariance (essentially the use of tensors) for his gravitational theory. For a while Einstein thought that there were problems with the approach, but he later returned to it and, by late 1915, had published his general theory of relativity in the form in which it is used today. This theory explains gravitation as distortion of the structure of spacetime by matter, affecting the inertial motion of other matter.\n\nDuring World War I, the work of Central Powers scientists was available only to Central Powers academics, for national security reasons. Some of Einstein's work did reach the United Kingdom and the United States through the efforts of the Austrian Paul Ehrenfest and physicists in the Netherlands, especially 1902 Nobel Prize-winner Hendrik Lorentz and Willem de Sitter of Leiden University. After the war ended, Einstein maintained his relationship with Leiden University, accepting a contract as an \"Extraordinary Professor\"; for ten years, from 1920 to 1930, he travelled to the Netherlands regularly to lecture.\n\nIn 1917, several astronomers accepted Einstein's 1911 challenge from Prague. The Mount Wilson Observatory in California, U.S., published a solar spectroscopic analysis that showed no gravitational redshift. In 1918, the Lick Observatory, also in California, announced that it too had disproved Einstein's prediction, although its findings were not published.\n\nHowever, in May 1919, a team led by the British astronomer Arthur Stanley Eddington claimed to have confirmed Einstein's prediction of gravitational deflection of starlight by the sun while photographing a solar eclipse with dual expeditions in Sobral, northern Brazil, and Príncipe, a west African island. Nobel laureate Max Born praised general relativity as the \"greatest feat of human thinking about nature\"; fellow laureate Paul Dirac was quoted saying it was \"probably the greatest scientific discovery ever made\".\n\nThere have been claims that scrutiny of the specific photographs taken on the Eddington expedition showed the experimental uncertainty to be comparable to the same magnitude as the effect Eddington claimed to have demonstrated, and that a 1962 British expedition concluded that the method was inherently unreliable. The deflection of light during a solar eclipse was confirmed by later, more accurate observations. Some resented the newcomer's fame, notably among some German physicists, who later started the \"Deutsche Physik\" (German Physics) movement.\n\nBy 1912, Einstein was actively seeking a theory in which gravitation was explained as a geometric phenomenon. At the urging of Tullio Levi-Civita, Einstein began by exploring the use of general covariance (which is essentially the use of curvature tensors) to create a gravitational theory. However, in 1913 Einstein abandoned that approach, arguing that it is inconsistent based on the \"hole argument\". In 1914 and much of 1915, Einstein was trying to create field equations based on another approach. When that approach was proven to be inconsistent, Einstein revisited the concept of general covariance and discovered that the hole argument was flawed.\n\nWhen Einstein realized that general covariance was tenable, he quickly completed the development of the field equations that are named after him. However, he made a now-famous mistake. The field equations he published in October 1915 were\n\nwhere formula_2 is the Ricci tensor, and formula_3 the energy–momentum tensor. This predicted the non-Newtonian perihelion precession of Mercury, and so had Einstein very excited. However, it was soon realized that they were inconsistent with the local conservation of energy–momentum unless the universe had a constant density of mass–energy–momentum. In other words, air, rock and even a vacuum should all have the same density. This inconsistency with observation sent Einstein back to the drawing board and, on 25 November 1915, Einstein presented the updated Einstein field equations to the Prussian Academy of Sciences:\n\nwhere formula_5 is the Ricci scalar and formula_6 the metric tensor. With the publication of the field equations, the issue became one of solving them for various cases and interpreting the solutions. This and experimental verification have dominated general relativity research ever since.\n\nAlthough Einstein is credited with finding the field equations, the German mathematician David Hilbert published them in an article before Einstein's article. This has resulted in accusations of plagiarism against Einstein, although not from Hilbert, and assertions that the field equations should be called the \"Einstein–Hilbert field equations\". However, Hilbert did not press his claim for priority and some have asserted that Einstein submitted the correct equations before Hilbert amended his own work to include them. This suggests that Einstein developed the correct field equations first, though Hilbert may have reached them later independently (or even learned of them afterwards through his correspondence with Einstein). However, others have criticized those assertions.\n\nIn the early years after Einstein's theory was published, Sir Arthur Eddington lent his considerable prestige in the British scientific establishment in an effort to champion the work of this German scientist. Because the theory was so complex and abstruse (even today it is popularly considered the pinnacle of scientific thinking; in the early years it was even more so), it was rumored that only three people in the world understood it. There was an illuminating, though probably apocryphal, anecdote about this. As related by Ludwik Silberstein, during one of Eddington's lectures he asked \"Professor Eddington, you must be one of three persons in the world who understands general relativity.\" Eddington paused, unable to answer. Silberstein continued \"Don't be modest, Eddington!\" Finally, Eddington replied \"On the contrary, I'm trying to think who the third person is.\"\n\nSince the field equations are non-linear, Einstein assumed that they were unsolvable. However, Karl Schwarzschild discovered in 1915 and published in 1916 an exact solution for the case of a spherically symmetric spacetime surrounding a massive object in spherical coordinates. This is now known as the Schwarzschild solution. Since then, many other exact solutions have been found.\n\nIn 1922, Alexander Friedmann found a solution in which the universe may expand or contract, and later Georges Lemaître derived a solution for an expanding universe. However, Einstein believed that the universe was apparently static, and since a static cosmology was not supported by the general relativistic field equations, he added a cosmological constant Λ to the field equations, which became\n\nThis permitted the creation of steady-state solutions, but they were unstable: the slightest perturbation of a static state would result in the universe expanding or contracting. In 1929, Edwin Hubble found evidence for the idea that the universe is expanding. This resulted in Einstein dropping the cosmological constant, referring to it as \"the biggest blunder in my career\". At the time, it was an ad hoc hypothesis to add in the cosmological constant, as it was only intended to justify one result (a static universe).\n\nProgress in solving the field equations and understanding the solutions has been ongoing. The solution for a spherically symmetric charged object was discovered by Reissner and later rediscovered by Nordström, and is called the Reissner–Nordström solution. The black hole aspect of the Schwarzschild solution was very controversial, and Einstein did not believe that singularities could be real. However, in 1957 (two years after Einstein's death in 1955), Martin Kruskal published a proof that black holes are called for by the Schwarzschild solution. Additionally, the solution for a rotating massive object was obtained by Roy Kerr in the 1960s and is called the Kerr solution. The Kerr–Newman solution for a rotating, charged massive object was published a few years later.\n\nThe first piece of evidence in support of general relativity came from its correct prediction of the anomalous rate of precession of Mercury's orbit. Subsequently, Arthur Stanley Eddington's 1919 expedition confirmed Einstein's prediction of the deflection of light by the Sun during the total solar eclipse of 29 May 1919, which helped to cement the status of general relativity as a viable theory. Since then, many observations have shown agreement with the predictions of general relativity. These include studies of binary pulsars, observations of radio signals passing the limb of the Sun, and even the global positioning system.\nThe theory predicts gravitational waves, which are ripples in the curvature of spacetime that propagate as waves, travelling outward from the source. The first observation of gravitational waves, which came from the merger of two black holes, was made on 14 September 2015 by the Advanced LIGO team, corroborating another prediction of the theory 100 years after it was published.\n\nThe first image of a black hole, the supermassive one at the center of galaxy Messier 87, was published by the Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration on 10 April 2019.\n\nThere have been various attempts to find modifications to general relativity. The most famous of these are the Brans–Dicke theory (also known as scalar-tensor theory), and Rosen's bimetric theory. Both of these theories proposed changes to the field equations of general relativity, and both suffer from these changes permitting the presence of bipolar gravitational radiation. As a result, Rosen's original theory has been refuted by observations of binary pulsars. As for Brans–Dicke (which has a tunable parameter \"ω\" such that \"ω = ∞\" is the same as general relativity), the amount by which it can differ from general relativity has been severely constrained by these observations.\n\nIn addition, general relativity is inconsistent with quantum mechanics, the physical theory that describes the wave–particle duality of matter, and quantum mechanics does not currently describe gravitational attraction at relevant (microscopic) scales. There is a great deal of speculation in the physics community as to the modifications that might be needed to both general relativity and quantum mechanics in order to unite them consistently. The speculative theory that unites general relativity and quantum mechanics is usually called quantum gravity, prominent examples of which include String Theory and Loop Quantum Gravity.\n\nKip Thorne identifies the \"golden age of general relativity\" as the period roughly from 1960 to 1975 during which the study of general relativity, which had previously been regarded as something of a curiosity, entered the mainstream of theoretical physics. During this period, many of the concepts and terms which continue to inspire the imagination of gravitation researchers and the general public were introduced, including black holes and 'gravitational singularity'. At the same time, in a closely related development, the study of physical cosmology entered the mainstream and the Big Bang became well established.\n\nFulvio Melia refers frequently to the \"golden age of relativity\" in his book \"Cracking the Einstein Code\". Andrzej Trautman hosted a relativity conference in Warsaw in 1962 to which Melia refers:\nRoy Kerr, protagonist of the book, contributed an Afterword, saying of the book: \"It is a remarkable piece of writing capturing beautifully the period we now refer to as the golden age of relativity.\"\n\n\n"}

It was granted pontifical college status in 1892 by Pope Leo XIII and renamed to its current name, thus becoming, and remaining, the only pontifical seminary in the Western Hemisphere.\n\nIn the 1870s, inspired by the orphanage work of Father Jessing, when four older boys indicated a desire to serve the Church as Roman Catholic priests, Father Jessing advertised in his German-language newspaper that he would be willing to sponsor two boys who wished to become priests but who lacked the financial means to do so. Jessing accepted twenty-three of the more than forty applicants who replied. Originally his new seminary was called the Collegium Josephinum and was located in downtown Columbus.\n\nAs those first students progressed through the seminary program, the institution initially provided six years of primary education (\"minor seminary,\" four years of high school and two years of college/pre-theology) and six years of secondary seminary education (\"major seminary,\" another two years of college/pre-theology and four years of theology/ seminary). Father Jessing lived to see the first class of six seminarians ordained to the priesthood in June 1899 but he died less than six months later.\n\nTo make sure that the fledgling institution would continue after his death, Father Jessing asked that it be placed under the protection of the Holy See. Pope Leo XIII granted the request in 1892, thus making the new institution, the Pontifical College Josephinum, the only pontifical seminary outside of Italy. From that time to the present, the institution has been under the direction of the Congregation for Catholic Education, with the Apostolic Nuncio to the United States as its Chancellor. Today, the seminary is financially independent from both the Holy See and the Diocese of Columbus.\n\nIn 1931, the Josephinum moved to its present location just north of Worthington, Ohio and eleven miles (18 km) north of downtown Columbus on a landmark campus. (The current size of the campus is slightly less than with another approximately parcel close by.) The new complex was designed by architect Frank A. Ludewig.\n\nThe academic structure of the seminary changed over time during the 1940s and 1950s from the \"six-six\" format to four years of high school, four years of college, and four years of theology/seminary (though the distinctions were gradual and unclear). Reflecting the German origins of its founder and its service to the German-speaking community, the seminary high school and college held almost all classes in German until the influx of non-German speaking students made this no longer practical. The first official College commencement occurred in June 1953; the College and Recreation buildings were dedicated in 1958; and the high school closed in 1967.\n\nFor the first few decades of its existence, the seminary focused its work on educating priests to work with the large population of German immigrants in the United States. The Josephinum was incorporated in Ohio in 1894; its Constitution was first approved by Pope Pius XI in 1938 and was most recently revised and approved by the Congregation for Catholic Education in 1996.\n\nIn the years after World War I, the focus of the seminary shifted away from its original mission of meeting the spiritual needs of German-speaking Catholics to a wider mission of preparing priests for dioceses throughout the United States that lacked their own seminary. With the advent of the Second Vatican Council in 1962, the Church took on a more outward-looking and evangelical orientation. It was only natural that seminaries like The Josephinum also become increasingly involved in outreach and ministry work in their local communities. This trend continues today, along with many other initiatives.\n\nThe Very Reverend Steven P. Beseau STD assumed leadership of the Pontifical College Josephinum on October 1, 2019. Josephinum alumni serve the Church in 48 states and 22 foreign countries. The Josephinum continues to prepare priests for U.S. dioceses that do not have their own seminaries, missionary areas of the United States, including regions of the U.S. with growing Hispanic communities and finally, dioceses around the world in need of help with the education of their seminarians.\n\nLed by a decades long effort by its most significant graduate and 20th Century leader, Msgr. Leonard J. Fick, the Josephinum was accredited by The Higher Learning Commission, an affiliate of the North Central Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools in 1976. The Josephinum has been accredited by the Association of Theological Schools in the United States and Canada since 1970. The seminary also holds a Certificate of Authorization from the Ohio Board of Regents.\n\n"}

It became available in 1912 and superseded the more toxic and less water-soluble salvarsan as an effective treatment for syphilis. Because both of these arsenicals carried considerable risk of side effects, they were replaced for this indication by penicillin in the 1940s.\n\nBoth salvarsan and neosalvarsan were developed in the laboratory of Paul Ehrlich in Frankfurt, Germany. Their discoveries were the result of the first organized team effort to optimize the biological activity of a lead compound through systematic chemical modifications. This scheme is the basis for most modern pharmaceutical research. Both salvarsan and neosalvarsan are prodrugs — that is, they are metabolised into the active drug in the body.\n\nAlthough, like salvarsan, it was originally believed to contain an arsenic-arsenic double bond, this is now known to be incorrect, and exists as a mixture of differently sized rings with arsenic-arsenic single bonds. \n"}

On the Champions Tour, Reid managed to win two senior majors; the 2005 Senior PGA Championship and the 2009 Tradition. \n\nReid was born in Bainbridge, Maryland, the son of an Air Force officer. He first hit a golf ball when he was five years old. Military life for his father meant that his family frequently moved from one state in America to another. Reid later said: \"It wasn't much of a life for a kid growing up but it certainly helped my golf game as I played on every kind of grass there is.\"\n\nIn 1976, Reid graduated from Brigham Young University. During his collegiate golf career, Reid was selected for All-American honors from 1973–1976. He became close friends with PGA Tour player Pat McGowan. Both Reid and McGowan developed their game under BYU's golf coach Karl Tucker.\n\nIn the 1976 U.S. Open, while still an amateur, Reid led the tournament by three strokes with an opening round of 67, before finishing tied for 50th place. Reid won the 1976 Pacific Coast Amateur Championship at The Los Angeles Country Club and lost in the quarter-final of the 1976 U.S. Amateur Championship.\n\nReid turned professional in late 1976, obtaining his PGA Tour card at the first attempt. He joined the PGA Tour in 1977.\n\nIn 1978, Reid lost a playoff to Mac McLendon in the Pensacola Open. In 1980, Reid finished in the top-10 thirteen times on the PGA Tour. Only Tom Watson had more top-10 finishes that year. Reid led the PGA Tour for driving accuracy in 1980 and was given the nickname \"Radar\" for his outstanding driving accuracy.\n\nIn 1985, Reid lost a playoff to Hal Sutton in the Southwest Golf Classic. Sutton sank a 30-foot birdie putt on the first extra hole to win the tournament.\n\nReid ended a wait of over a decade for his first PGA Tour title by winning the 1987 Seiko Tucson Open by four strokes.\n\nIn 1988, Reid finished 2nd at The Players Championship. His brother Bill was the general manager of the TPC at Sawgrass tournament venue at one time. Later in 1988, Reid won his second PGA Tour title by defeating Tom Watson in a playoff at the NEC World Series of Golf.\n\nIn 1989, Reid led the Masters Tournament with four holes to play but hit an approach shot into the pond at the par-5 15th hole to make a double-bogey and finished the tournament in 6th place. He also lost the lead in that year's PGA Championship on the back nine during the final round at Kemper Lakes Golf Club, bogeying the 16th hole and having a double-bogey 5 on the par-3 17th. Needing a birdie on the 18th hole to tie Payne Stewart, Reid missed a seven-foot birdie putt which would have forced a playoff with Stewart. After his final round, Jack Nicklaus approached Reid and said: \"I just want to say that I've never felt so bad for anyone in my life. You played too well not to win.\"\n\nIn 1990, Reid was the third round leader in the KMart Greater Greensboro Open, but had three bogeys on the back nine for a round of 75, finishing in a tie for 2nd place behind the winner Steve Elkington. Later in the year, in November 1990, Reid won the Casio World Open in Japan by two strokes.\n\nReid missed virtually all of the 1993 PGA Tour season after sustaining a wrist injury while playing table tennis, which resulted in him having surgery to reattach a tendon.\n\nIn 1997, Reid was the third round leader in the Hawaiian Open, but lost the tournament in a three-way playoff to Paul Stankowski. In 1998, Reid shot a course record of 62 in the Westin Texas Open at La Cantera Golf Club. He finished the tournament tied for 4th place.\n\nReid's last top-5 finish on the PGA Tour was 5th place at the Michelob Championship at Kingsmill in 2000, at the age of 46.\n\nIn 2004, Reid became eligible to play the Champions Tour and in 2005 he claimed his first senior title at the Senior PGA Championship, which is one of the senior majors. Reid won the tournament despite being three shots down with one hole to play. He forced himself into a three-way playoff with a long eagle putt on the 18th hole. After Jerry Pate missed a 3-foot par putt on the 18th to win the tournament, Reid then birdied the first extra playoff hole to win the title. Reid later said: \"I feel bad for Jerry. I know how he feels because I felt that way. Fate takes a hand, and I can't explain it, but I'm grateful.\"\n\nReid did not win again on the Champions Tour until 2009 at the JELD-WEN Tradition, another major championship, in a playoff over John Cook. Reid was one shot behind Cook on the 18th tee of the final round. Reid and Cook both hit their approach shots to the par-4 18th into the right greenside bunker. Cook's bunker shot finished 20 feet away and Reid's bunker shot finished six inches from the hole. Cook missed his par putt that would have won the championship. On the first playoff hole Reid holed a 12-foot birdie putt to win the title.\n\nReid's victory at The Tradition tournament meant that he joined a prestigious small group of players, including Jack Nicklaus and Arnold Palmer, whose first two wins on the Champions Tour were in major championships.\n\nHe is married to wife Randolyn and has six children. He spends his free time visiting historic sites and museums. He is a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.\n\n\nPGA Tour playoff record (1–3)\n\nChampions Tour playoff record (2–0)\n\nCUT = missed the halfway cut<br>\n\"T\" indicates a tie for a place.\n\n\nCUT = missed the halfway cut\n\"T\" indicates a tie for a place\n\nDefeated Pate and Quigley in a sudden-death playoff.<br>\nDefeated Cook in a sudden-death playoff with a birdie on the first hole of the playoff.\n\n\"Results not in chronological order before 2017.\"\n\nCUT = missed the halfway cut<br>\n\"T\" indicates a tie for a place\n\nProfessional\n\n"}

TNR opened a station at Agincourt in 1871 (not to be mistaken for CPR Agincourt station located further east) and was later demolished and not replaced until GO established service in the area in 1982 (and renovated a station structure in the 1990s).\n\nIn 2018, EllisDon Transit Infrastructure was awarded a contract to expand the station for increased Regional Express Rail service. The project will include construction of a second platform, improved pedestrian and vehicle connections, and a new station building. The project is expected to be completed by December 2020.\n\nThe Toronto Transit Commission's 85 Sheppard East and 985 Sheppard East Express bus routes links Agincourt Station to Don Mills station in the west, the 85 and 985B continues east into Scarborough while the 985A continues express to Scarborough Centre station. The proposed Sheppard East LRT would create a grade-separation of the rail line at Sheppard Avenue East (this started in December, 2009), with a connection from the LRT platform to the GO platform. But now it seems that plans have been made to build a second track from Agincourt to Markham GO so the line will operate on weekends. The Rob Ford administration saw a cancellation of the LRT projects, with an intended Sheppard subway line extension; however, on March 22, 2012 Toronto City council voted to reinstate the Sheppard LRT project and construction should restart sometime within the next few years.\n\nSince the Sheppard LRT project was a plan back in 2010, it required a grade separation of Sheppard Avenue East and the GO train tracks. This led contractors from the City of Toronto government and TTC to build a bridge for the GO train tracks, while having Sheppard Avenue move under it, as the light rail vehicles would not have been able to cross the GO tracks at ground level. On July 3, 2012 the underpass was completed and opened to regular traffic, which was five months ahead of schedule.\n\nNot only does this improve the flow of traffic along Sheppard Avenue, as vehicles no longer have to wait at a rail crossing, it also improves GO train service. The bridge will also allow two-way service on this portion of the line.\n\nBuilding the bridge also meant that the parking capacity of the station could be expanded. Before the project, parking capacity was only 297 and now it has been increased to 342 spaces.\n"}

It is located in the neighbourhood of Milliken, Ontario. The station originally opened on September 7, 1982 on the Stouffville line but was relocated on September 6, 2005 because the curve of the original station made it difficult for the operator to see, and it would allow a parking lot to be built on the other side, along with making the station accessible.\n\nThe station was re-located south of Steeles Avenue, opposite to the Splendid China Mall shopping centre and accessed by a re-aligned Redlea Avenue. This new station has a straight platform long enough to accommodate a full-length train of ten carriages and a locomotive, which allows the conductor to have a good enough view from the 5th carriage to open all the doors safely. It has a 725 car parking lot, a dedicated passenger pick-up and drop-off area, and a station building with ticket sales counters, a waiting area, and public washrooms.\n\nThe former Milliken station (closed September 2, 2005), was located on the north side of Steeles in Markham, to the east of Market Village Mall. It consisted of a fenced off area with a small ticket booth and 2 large bus shelters. It was one of the most neglected GO railway stations because it was built on a sharp curve, and was much shorter than most GO stations. Because of that, trains could not open all the doors when stopped there. It had no dedicated parking spots and a small kiss-and-ride area. Cars waiting for the trains were parked at Market Village or along Steeles Avenue. There are no traces of the former platform, other than a single sign facing towards Steeles Avenue reading \"CN Milliken.\"\n\nFrom 2018 to 2019 Steeles Avenue will be re routed to allow for the construction of a pedestrian bridge and new level crossing.\n\nA small shed was built (in latter 19th Century) by the Toronto and Nipissing Railway as a flag stop located on the north side of Steeles Avenue on the east side of the tracks (see postcards) and used by successor railways (Grand Trunk Railway and Canadian National Railways) until it was demolished in the early 1960s.\n\nThe station is not directly served by regular local transit services, but there is a short connecting walkway beside the railway tracks to bus stops on Steeles Avenue East.\n\nToronto Transit Commission's bus routes 53 Steeles East operates along Steeles Avenue East and 43 Kennedy terminates by looping there, as does the 57 Midland.\n\nYork Region Transit route 8 Kennedy stops at the Steeles Avenue and Kennedy Road intersection, while the 203 Milliken GO Shuttle only operates during peak hours, specifically to connect the neighbouring part of Markham to GO Train service.\n"}
