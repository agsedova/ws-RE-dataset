{"id": "2144047", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2144047", "title": "Castle Grayskull", "text": "Castle Grayskull\n\nCastle Grayskull is a fortress located on the fictional planet Eternia. It forms a central location in the \"Masters of the Universe\" toy/comic/animation universe, and also appears in the 1987 live action adaptation.\n\nIn the storyline of the franchise, it is the target of numerous attacks by Skeletor, Hordak and the Snake Men, all of whom believe that the secrets inside will allow them to conquer Eternia and become the titular Masters of the Universe.\n\nCastle Grayskull was conceived as the central location for the battle between the forces of good and evil. The original playset was released in 1982, and all other depictions of the castle originate from it. It is a large hollow green castle, consisting of two halves connected by a hinge. The toy is designed to open for play, and close for storage. A carrying handle is molded into the top of the castle. A large skull decorates the front, with a hinged \"Jawbridge\" allowing access to the interior, through the \"mouth\" opening. The interior has a throne room, elevator, and a trap door. Multiple accessories are also included - a ladder, removable flag pole, turret cannon, weapons rack with 9 weapons, and a \"battle trainer\" device,\n\nThe original concept art and prototype show a large swamp surrounding the castle, which was going to be printed on a playmat that would be positioned beneath the playset. This moat playmat was not included with the finished toy, in order to keep costs down.\n\nThe origin of Castle Grayskull was related in the read-along book \"Castle Grayskull\" as once being the beautiful \"Hall of Wisdom,\" the \"center of Eternian culture and a storehouse of all knowledge of the universe.\" The Hall was the meeting place of the Council of Elders. One day, the elders saw a vision of a beautiful woman dressed in snake armor (note that this description matches early versions of Teela AND the Sorceress, see for example, making an intended identity with the Sorceress very possible) who warned of future danger and also the coming of He-Man. The elders concentrated all of their power into a magical orb. The elders then magically transformed the Hall of Wisdom into Castle Grayskull in order to frighten away intruders and protect the orb. This was to have all taken place several centuries before the coming of He-Man. The Castle was then largely forgotten until Man-At-Arms eventually led Prince Adam to Castle Grayskull, where Prince Adam became He-Man using the Sword of Power.\n\nIn the original television series, Castle Grayskull is a legendary/mythical location situated on a pedestal of bones jutting out of an abyss in a barren plain just on the edge of the Evergreen Forest. It serves as home to the Sorceress and to the mysterious and rarely seen Spirit of Grayskull, as well as a place of refuge for He-Man and all those considered his friends. Its origins are unknown except for the fact that it was constructed to protect an unspecified source of power from those who would misuse it. It is a frequent target for the forces of evil.\n\nAlthough it is mostly viewed from the outside, there are a few notable internal locations: the Throne Room; Main Chamber (including the Walkway of the Elders); the Hall of He-Man; the Portal Chamber (in the skull top); a laboratory (basement); Mirror Room (basement); the Sorceress' den (where she studies and practices spells; in the right tower); and, the Sorceress' bed chamber. In the episode \"Double Trouble\", an evil doppelganger of He-Man's friend Kol Darr also comes across the chamber that houses the Secrets of Castle Grayskull. It is a room with two doors, between which sits the Guardian, one of which houses the secrets, the other one is only destruction.\n\nThe castle is surrounded by a bottomless abyss, which doubles as a moat in at least one episode, and a Jawbridge (a drawbridge formed by the lowerjaw of the castle's \"mouth\") is used to come across it. When Prince Adam transforms into He-Man, sparks shoot up from the abyss towards He-Man's sword. This phenomenon is seen in the episode \"Into the Abyss\", when Teela falls into the abyss and witnesses this spectacle from a unique vantage point. In the same episode, He-Man states that the abyss actually leads to the center of Eternia.\n\nThere are a number of magical doors inside the castle, most of them in the Portal Chamber, that serve as portals to various locations on Eternia, including Snake Mountain, and at least one that leads to Etheria.\n\nThe castle's purpose and history are significantly expanded upon in the 2002 series, as are the variety of locations shown in the castle. The most significant of the expansions made is the addition of a large Crystal Chamber, accessible only by a secret \"door\" in the floor of a secluded chamber. Within this chamber is the Orb of Power, within which lies the combined powers of the Elders. Prior to its bestowal upon Prince Adam, the Sword of Power was also stored in the depths of the Crystal Chamber.\n\nOther locations within the castle include the Throne Room (trophy room); a massive library (blue room); a room that houses an enormous, mystical mirror used to view both the past and present; an underground colosseum; a secret chamber devoted to King Grayskull; the area behind the eyesockets of the castle's facade; and, numerous corridors that are draped in illusions to confound invaders.\n\nOnce made of white marble, and at the center of King Grayskull's bustling kingdom, the castle fell into a state of disrepair following a devastating battle with the forces of Hordak. Over countless years, the castle was almost entirely forgotten by the populace. Its true purpose, and the secrets within, are now known to only a very select few. Like the Filmation version, it is surrounded by a seemingly bottomless abyss, and is backed by a sheer cliff. This abyss was revealed to have been created during the final confrontation between King Grayskull and Hordak.\n\nIn the 1987 live action movie, Castle Grayskull is finally captured by Skeletor's forces. The first image of it seen is of its interior as Skeletor, victorious at last, makes the long march across the castle's Throne Room. The throne resides in the posterior section of the room just beyond the section's seemingly incomplete marble foundation which rests atop pillars and framework that extend from a deep abyss. This foundation is formed in such a way that there are four large holes of sizes that altogether occupy most of the floor's area leaving a few wide catwalk walkways. The large posterior section of the room is lined with several tall statues of elders along each side whereas the much thinner, less tall, anterior section of the room is an open hallway lined with columns along each side. Near the throne, Skeletor has trapped the Sorceress within an energy field, which, little by little, transfers her power to him. The castle serves as Skeletor's main base of operations throughout the movie. According to the film, it houses a giant circular portal called \"the Great Eye of the Galaxy\", which only opens when Eternia's moon reaches its zenith, granting whoever stands before it god-like power. It is never explicitly stated, though visuals strongly indicate, that for this to happen the Sword of Grayskull must be inserted into a small column near the portal. The opening narration implies that Castle Grayskull itself is at the center of the universe.\n\nIn the 2002 remake of \"He-Man\", it is revealed that Castle Grayskull was once home to King Grayskull, an ancestor of Prince Adam, who died defending his kingdom and Eternia as a whole from Hordak.\n\nUpon his death, King Grayskull transferred his power into his sword that now forms the basis of He-Man's power. His wife Veena became the first Sorceress, and his advisers became the Council of Elders. He also had an enormous green lion as a mount, bearing the same armor as Battle Cat, and is presumably where Battle Cat gains his powers.\n\n\nCastle Grayskull was made as a playset for both the 1980s and 2002 Masters of the Universe toy lines. The 1980s incarnation was one of the more popular Christmas presents for pre-adolescent boys in the 1980s. The castle was user-friendly, possessing many settings and functions suitable for the 5\" action figures it was built to complement.\n\nCastle Grayskull was released by Mattel for inclusion in their Masters of the Universe Classics action figure line (mid to late November 2013), and a new character, named Castle Grayskullman, described as the \"Heroic Embodiment of Castle Grayskull\" was created by Daniel Benedict, and was the winner of the 30th Anniversary \"Create-A-Character\" Contest. The figure of Castle Grayskullman was released in November 2012.\n\n"}

Largely produced and performed on a single computer (including live shows), his songs tend to be constructed from digital samples of found sounds and other artists' music. Until 2004 he recorded under the name Donna Summer, an allusion to disco singer Donna Summer.\n\nIn 2005 \"RES\" magazine named Forrest's \"Steppin Off\" video, by director Jon Watts, music video of the year. In 2006 \"Res\" magazine named Forrest's video \"War Photographer\", directed by Joel Trussell video of the year, and online magazine \"Pitchfork Media\" also named it in their top five videos of the year. Both videos have won several awards at various international film and video festivals and have both been widely viewed, downloaded and acclaimed.\n\nForrest has released on many labels, but primarily on Sonig, the Köln, Germany based record label. He also has releases on Irritant Records (UK), Omeko (JP), MeWe le Disque (BE), Mirex (DE), Brooklyn Beats (USA), and HOSS Records (USA).\n\nSome of the more conspicuous samples of other artists to be found in Forrest's work include ones from Laurie Anderson, The Who, Supertramp, Steely Dan, Joe Jackson, Elton John, Creedence Clearwater Revival and Pat Benatar. This (along with his former stage name) shows his interest in appropriation as an artistic concept. Along with many images featured on the Cock Rock Disco web site it also shows his interest in recontextualizing popular culture from past decades.\n\nForrest grew up in South Carolina, has lived in Atlanta and New York City and now (Winter, 2009) resides in Berlin. He has a BA in Photography. He previously worked as a professional artist as well as an art critic for the Atlanta Journal-Constitution news paper.\n\nBesides being a fan himself, there is no connection between Forrest and the pop music/disco artist, Donna Summer. In a 2003 interview with the CBC Radio program, \"Brave New Waves\", he stated that by being a middle class white male using this name he was \"subjecting people to a fake issue of diversity\" and forcing them \"to consider gender a little bit more.\"\n\nHe created the record label Cock Rock Disco to release his own recordings in 2000, while living in New York City. For three years he self-released his earliest albums on CD-R, including \"Rock Non Rock\" and \"Belligerent Super Vision\", his first unreleased full-length. Then in 2005, Cock Rock Disco began releasing other artists including Duran Duran Duran, Drumcorps, Otto von Schirach, About, the Assdroids and Dev/Null. The label has currently (as of Nov 2009) 18 full-length releases, 15 12\"-only releases and continues to release bi-monthly free MP3 only albums, of which there are currently 19 and growing fast.\n\nA free full-length Mp3 album was made available in Dec, 2005 and remains online and free to download. To date it has been downloaded over 70,000+ times. In April 2009 a new free compilation \"Monsters of Cock Rock Disco\" was released and features newcomers to the label Captain Ahab in addition to their normal roster of artists.\n\nTo celebrate release of the \"Monsters of CRD\" the label hosted a tour of central Europe with Otto von Schirach, Duran Duran Duran, Nero's Day at Disneyland, and Forrest, as DJ Donna Summer. The tour lasted 2 weeks and stopped at 10 cities. There was a limited edition poster accompanying the tour that was sold out.\n\nForrest also designs most of the visuals for Cock Rock Disco including the website, many of the album covers, and any social media presence.\n\nIn 2015, Cock Rock Disco was re-launched with many of the label's previous releases becoming available as free mp3 downloads and continuing to release new music and videos.\n\nIn 2008, Forrest began a new label that focused exclusively on club-friendly music called Nightshifters together with New York City Dj Jubilee. The label works mainly with a small group of musicians including AC Slater, Hostage, Rob Threezy, Proper Villains, Jubilee, Rampage, and Forrest himself as Dj Donna Summer.\n\nThe label releases \"EP\" length releases of usually 4 original tracks and 2-4 remixes per release. To date (Nov 2009) the label has released 9 mp3-only releases, 3 Dj mixes, and a T-shirt. Remixers have included Jokers Of The Scene, Mikix the Cat, Angel Alanis, Scott Cooper, Luna-C, Grahmzilla, DreSkull, and Blatta & Inesha.\n\nForrest currently makes all of the design work for Nightshifters.\n\nForrest was also the host of \"Advanced D&D With Donna Summer\" on independent freeform radio station WFMU, where he continued to use the name Donna Summer after dropping it in relation to his own recordings. The show is still archived on the main WFMU website above.\n\nForrest says, \"\"The show was primarily focused on unreleased new musicians. I tried to play as much CDR stuff as possible, and figure about 80% of each show was completely unreleased.\"\" On his own web-forum he has maintained that he would like to continue with the show again in the future.\n\nNetwork Awesome is an online TV broadcasting outlet launched by electronic musician Jason Forrest and co-founder Greg Sadetsky on January 1, 2011.\n\nNetwork Awesome also includes a magazine with the goal of providing commentary and analysis of the featured content via daily articles. The magazine is syndicated by Huffington Post and DigBoston.\n\nIn 2005, Forrest co-founded the Wasted Festival to showcase breakcore musicians and related acts. The mini-festival began in co-operation with Club Transmediale, and ran at least ten events.\n\n\n\n\n"}

He has previously played for Ipswich Town, Derby County, Crystal Palace and Sheffield Wednesday.\n\nPrice was born in Bournemouth, but graduated through the Ipswich Town youth system. He became known for stepping in for Kelvin Davis during the 2004–05 season and saving a penalty against Coventry. After Davies returned from injury, Price played for Cambridge United on loan for part of the season. Davis departed at the end of the 2004–05 season, with Price contesting Shane Supple to be first choice goalkeeper.\n\nHe then started nearly every game ahead of first choice keeper Shane Supple. In the 2006–07 season, just a week after Petr Čech and Carlo Cudicini sustained horrific injuries which brought up an argument that goalkeepers need more protection, Price was injured in Ipswich's 3–1 victory over Southend United. Price had to be stretchered off after colliding with Matt Harrold.\n\nDespite playing well for Ipswich when called upon, the arrival of Neil Alexander at Ipswich meant Price's future was destined to be away from Portman Road.\n\nOn 27 July 2007, Price joined Premier League club Derby County, for an undisclosed fee on a three-year contract, to provide back-up and competition for then first choice goalkeeper Stephen Bywater.\n\nPrice made his debut for Derby against Liverpool on 26 December, after Stephen Bywater was injured in the warm-up and went on to start the next eight league and cup matches before the signing of Roy Carroll ended his run in the first team. In the FA Cup third round replay between Derby and Sheffield Wednesday, Price made two penalty saves helping Derby to victory in a penalty shootout.\n\nPrice signed for Milton Keynes Dons on an emergency one-month loan on 27 October 2008, and made his debut the next day in the Dons 2–1 Football League One victory over Leyton Orient. He returned to Derby but, again, could not supplant teammates Stephen Bywater and Roy Carroll from the goalkeepers spot and joined Luton Town on a one-month loan on 2 February 2009. During his time at Luton he played only twice because of a groin injury, but impressed in those two games, helping Luton to the Football League Trophy final at Wembley Stadium, making two penalty saves against Brighton. Price joined League One side Brentford on a season-long loan deal on 8 July 2009. He made 18 appearances for Brentford, but didn't make an appearance after January due to the arrival of Wojciech Szczęsny, who was on loan from Arsenal at the time. Upon his return to Derby at the end of the 2009–10 season, it was announced that his contract would not be renewed and he left the club with just nine appearances in his three-years there.\n\nAfter leaving the Rams, Price signed a 3-year contract to join Crystal Palace as understudy to Julián Speroni. He made his Palace debut in March against Burnley after Speroni had suffered an injury. Price was not offered a new contract by Palace at the end of the 2014–15 season.\n\nOn Friday 11 April 2014, Price signed for League 2 side Mansfield Town on loan as emergency goalkeeper cover for the injured Alan Marriott.\n\nOn 17 November 2014, Price signed on loan with League One club Crawley Town until 20 December. At the end of his loan spell he returned to Crystal Palace but on 16 January 2015 it was announced that he had rejoined Crawley until the end of the season.\n\nFollowing his release from Crystal Palace, he signed a one-year contract with Championship side Sheffield Wednesday.\n\nAt the end of his contract at Sheffield Wednesday, Price signed a two-year deal with Championship side Rotherham United.\n\nHe was released by Rotherham at the end of the 2017–18 season, but re-signed for the club on a two–year deal on 6 July 2018.\n\nPrice received his first call-up to the full Wales international squad for a friendly against Slovenia on 17 August 2005, but missed out on his first cap after he was forced to withdraw with a knee injury. He then made his debut against Cyprus on 17 November 2005.

He then joined Wycombe on loan later in the 2000–01 season. At Wycombe, Parkin scored perhaps one of the most important goals in their history (alongside Roy Essandoh winner versus Leicester City F.C. when he headed in the winner against Wolverhampton during Wycombe's run to the semi finals of the FA Cup. However his loan had finished and he returned to Chelsea denying him a chance to play in the quarter finals v Leicester City F.C. or semi final v Liverpool He scored two other goals for Wycombe, including one in the Football League Trophy against Leyton Orient.

{"id": "2144088", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2144088", "title": "Will contest", "text": "Will contest\n\nA will contest, in the law of property, is a formal objection raised against the validity of a will, based on the contention that the will does not reflect the actual intent of the testator (the party who made the will) or that the will is otherwise invalid. Will contests generally focus on the assertion that the testator lacked testamentary capacity, was operating under an insane delusion, or was subject to undue influence or fraud. A will may be challenged in its entirety or in part.\n\nCourts and legislation generally feel a strong obligation to uphold the final wishes of a testator, and, without compelling evidence to the contrary, \"the law presumes that a will is valid and accurately reflects the wishes of the person who wrote it\".\n\nA will may include an \"in terrorem\" clause, with language along the lines of \"any person who contests this will shall forfeit his legacy\", which operates to disinherit any person who challenges the validity of the will. Such no-contest clauses are permitted under the Uniform Probate Code, which most American states follow at least in part. However, since the clause is within the will itself, a successful challenge to the will renders the clause meaningless. Many states consider such clauses void as a matter of public policy or valid only if a will is contested without probable cause.\n\nThis article mainly discusses American law and cases. Will contests are more common in the US States than in other countries. This prevalence of will contests in the US is partly because American law gives people a large degree of freedom in disposing of their property and also because \"a number of incentives for suing exist in American law outside of the merits of the litigation itself\". Most other legal traditions enforce some type of forced heirship, requiring that a testator leave at least some assets to their family, particularly the spouse and children.\n\nTypically, standing in the United States to contest the validity of a will is limited to two classes of persons:\n\nFor example, if Monica makes a will leaving $5,000 each to her husband, Chandler; her brother, Ross; her neighbor, Joey and her best friend, Rachel. Chandler tells Monica that he will divorce her if she does not disown Ross, which would humiliate her. Later, Ross tells Monica (untruthfully) that Chandler is having an affair with Phoebe, which Monica believes. Distraught, Monica rewrites her will, disowning both Chandler and Ross. The attorney who drafts the will accidentally writes the gift to Rachel as $500 instead of $5,000 and also accidentally leaves Joey out entirely.\n\nUnder such facts:\n\nCommon grounds or reasons for contesting a will include lack of testamentary capacity, undue influence, insane delusion, fraud, duress, technical flaws and forgery. \n\nLack of testamentary capacity or disposing mind and memory claims are based on assertions that the testator lacked mental capacity when the will was drafted, and they are the most common types of testamentary challenges. Testamentary capacity in the United States typically requires that a testator has sufficient mental acuity to understand the amount and the nature of the property, the family members and the loved ones who would ordinarily receive such property by the will, and (c) how the will disposes of such property. Under this low standard for competence, one may possess testamentary capacity but still lack mental capacity to sign other contracts. Furthermore, a testator with serious dementia may have \"lucid periods\" and then is capable of writing or modifying a will.\n\nOther nations like Germany may have more stringent requirements for writing a will. Lack of mental capacity or incompetence is typically proven by medical records, irrational conduct of the decedent, and the testimony of those who observed the decedent at the time the will was executed. Simply because an individual has a form of mental illness or disease, undergoes mental health treatment after repeated suicide attempts, or exhibits eccentric behavior, does not mean the person automatically lacks the requisite mental capacity to make a will.\n\nUndue influence typically involves the accusation that a trusted friend, relative, or caregiver actively procured a new will that reflects that person's own desires rather than those of the testator. Such allegations are often closely linked to lack of mental capacity: someone of sound mind is unlikely to be swayed by undue influence, pressure, manipulation, etc. As it is required for invalidation of a will, undue influence must amount to \"over-persuasion, duress, force, coercion, or artful or fraudulent contrivances to such a degree that there is destruction of the free agency and will power of the one making the will.\n\nMere affection, kindness or attachment of one person for another may not of itself constitute undue influence.\" For example, Florida law gives a list of the types of active procurement that will be considered in invalidating a will: presence of the beneficiary at the execution of the will; presence of the beneficiary on those occasions when the testator expressed a desire to make a will; recommendation by the beneficiary of an attorney to draw the will; knowledge of the contents of the will by the beneficiary prior to execution; giving of instructions on preparation of the will by the beneficiary to the attorney drawing the will; securing of witnesses to the will by the beneficiary; and safekeeping of the will by the beneficiary subsequent to execution.\n\nIn most U.S. states, including Florida, if the challenger of a will is able to establish that it was actively procured, the burden of proof shifts to the person seeking to uphold the will to establish that the will is not the product of undue influence. However, undue influence is notoriously difficult to prove, and establishing the someone has the means, motive and inclination to exert undue influence is not enough to prove that the person in fact exerted such influence in a particular case. However, attorneys are often held to a higher standard and are suspect if they assist in drafting a will that names them as a beneficiary.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, a legal presumption of undue influence arises when there is a finding of a confidential (or fiduciary) relationship, the active procurement of the will by the beneficiary and a substantial benefit to that beneficiary, such as if a testator leaves property to the attorney who drew up the will. However, that is dependent on the circumstances of such a relationship and typically the burden is initially on the person contesting to show undue influence. Proving undue influence is difficult. In Australia, a challenger must show that the free will of the testator has been overborne by words and actions of the alleged wrong doer(s), to such an extent that the deceased’s freedom of testation has been taken away.\n\nInsane delusion is another form of incapacity in which someone executes a will while strongly holding a \"fixed false belief without hypothesis, having no foundation in reality.\" Other courts have expanded on this concept by adding that the fixed false belief must be persistently adhered to against all evidence and reason, and the irrational belief must have influenced the drafting or provisions of the will. \n\nIn Florida, one of the most-often cited court rulings on insane delusion is from 2006. In this case, the decedent executed a new will in 2005 in the hospital with severe pain and under the influence of a strong medication. She died the next day. The new will disinherited the caretaker and left the decedent's estate to several charities. The caretaker asserted that the decedent was suffering from an insane delusion at the time the will was executed and that she thus lacked testamentary capacity. The decedent's physicians testified regarding the medication that the decedent was taking and how it had changed her personality. A psychiatrist who saw the decedent opined that she was delusional when she stated that the caretaker had abandoned her and had killed her dog. To the contrary, witnesses and evidence supported the position that the caretaker visited the decedent in the hospital every day, and the caretaker gave credible testimony that she was continuing to care for the dog. Accordingly, the court set aside the will as invalid based upon insane delusion.\n\nDuress involves some threat of physical harm or coercion upon the testator by the perpetrator that caused the execution of the will.\n\nThere are four general elements of fraud: false representations of material facts to the testator; knowledge by the perpetrator that the representations are false; intent that the representations be acted upon and resulting injury. There are two primary types of fraud: fraud in the execution, (for example, the testator was told the will he signed was something other than a will), and fraud in the inducement (for example, the testator is intentionally misled by a material fact that caused the testator to make a different devise from the one he would otherwise have made).\n\nA will contest may be based upon alleged failure to adhere to the legal formalities required in a particular jurisdiction. For example, some states require that wills must use specific terminology or jargon, must be notarized, must be witnessed by a certain number of persons, or witnessed by disinterested parties who are not relatives, inherit nothing in the will, and are not nominated as an executor. Additionally, the testator and witnesses must generally sign the will in each other's sight and physical presence.\n\nFor example, in Utah, a will must be \"signed by the testator or in the testator's name by some other individual in the testator's conscious presence and by the testator's direction; and... signed by at least two individuals, each of whom signed within a reasonable time after he witnessed either the signing of the will... or [received] the testator's acknowledgment [that he or she actually signed the will].\" In a Pennsylvania case, the wills of a husband and wife were invalidated because they accidentally signed each other's wills.\n\nIn some cases a will contests is based on allegations that the will is forged. Forgery can range from the fabrication of an entire document, including the signatures, to the insertion or modification of pages in an otherwise legitimate will.\n\nAccording to a 2009 \"Wall Street Journal\" article, \"charges of forgery are more common than proven cases of it. They often originate with an adult child who, feeling short-changed in a parent's will, accuses a sibling of doctoring the document\". \n\nNotable cases of forged wills include the \"Mormon will\" allegedly written by reclusive business tycoon Howard Hughes (1905-1976), and the Howland will forgery trial (1868) in which sophisticated mathematical analysis showed that the signature on a will was most likely forged. British physician Harold Shipman killed numerous elderly patients and was caught after forging one patient's will to benefit himself.\n\nSome jurisdictions permit an election against the will by a widowed spouse or orphaned children. That is not a contest against the will itself (the validity of the will is irrelevant), but an alternate procedure established by statute to contest the disposition of property.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, wills are often contested on the basis that a child of the deceased (or somebody treated as such) was bequeathed nothing or less than could reasonably be expected.\n\nIn the United States, research finds that between 0.5% and 3% of wills are contested. Despite that small percentage, given the millions of American wills probated every year it means that a substantial number of will contests occur. As of the mid-1980ss, the most common reason for contesting a will is undue influence and/or supposed lack of testamentary capacity, accounting for about three quarters of will contests; another 15% of will contests are based on an alleged failure to adhere to required formalities in the disputed will; the remainder of contests involve accusations of fraud, insane delusion, etc.\n\nThe vast majority of will contests are not successful, in part because most states tend to assume that a properly-executed will is valid, and a testator possesses the requisite mental capacity to execute a will unless the contesting party can demonstrate the contrary position by clear and convincing evidence. Generally, proponents of a will must establish its validity by a preponderance of evidence, but those contesting a will must prevail by showing clear and convincing evidence, the latter requiring a much higher standard of proof.\n\nContesting a will can be expensive. According to a Boston-area estate planning attorney quoted in \"Consumer Reports\" (March, 2012), \"A typical will contest will cost $10,000 to $50,000, and that's a conservative estimate\". Costs can increase even more if a will contest actually goes to trial, and the overall value of an estate can determine if a will contest is worth the expense. In some cases, the threat of a will contest is intended to both pressure the estate into avoiding the expense of a trial and forcing an out-of-court settlement more favorable to disgruntled heirs. However, those who make frivolous or groundless objections to a will may be forced to pay the costs for both sides in the court battle.\n\nCourts do not necessarily look to fairness during will contests, and a considerable portion of will contests are initiated by those who have no cause of action justifying a court case but are instead reacting to \"hurt feelings\" of disinheritance. In other words, just because the provisions of a will may seem \"unfair\" does not mean that the will is invalid. Therefore, wills cannot be challenged simply because a beneficiary believes the inheritance or lack thereof is unfair. In the United States, the decedent generally has a legal right to dispose of property in any way that is legal.\n\nDepending on the grounds, the result of a will contest may be:\n\n"}

Within the community, there was only one sari-sari store wherein household necessities being supplied by the Chinese traders, who frequently visited the place from Zamboanga City.\n\nOne day, a group of Spaniards happened to visit the place as part of their Christianization campaign. They roamed around until they reached the only store within the settlement. They asked what the name of the place was. The store owner did not understand a single word from the Spaniards. He thought that the Spaniards were asking what he was selling because they were pointing at the piles of sardines inside the shelves. Immediately, the store owner replied, \"Sardinas\", the native word of sardines. The foreigner nodded convincingly, \"Ah, Dinas\" and the Spaniards thought that the name of the place is Dinas. This is how Dinas got its name.\n\nDinas is politically subdivided into 30 barangays.\n"}

According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nLocal stories said it is named after a noted Subanen chieftain, \"\"Dumi\"\" and his wife, \"\"Ingag\"\".\nAnother supposed origin of the name tells about the native fellow who was asked by a government agent as to what the name of the place was while watching a cockfight. After the game was over, the stranger inquired about the name of the place. The native curtly replied: \"\"Duminag!\"\" meaning \"I won\". The government agent misheard the word. Instead of \"Duminag\", he wrote down \"Dumingag\".\n\nThe authenticity of these stories, however, is questionable since there has never been a single piece of evidence or record that Dumi and Ingag had ever actually existed. The first non-Subanen settlers of Dumingag were from the Ilo-ilo town of Dumangas the Decolongon Family who cultivated town center area. According to more convincing sources, the earliest settlers arrived in Dumingag with renewed optimism after World War II and, starting their lives anew, they hailed the place as \"Little Dumangas\". Hence, this soon developed into the current name \"Dumingag\".\n\nDumingag is a municipality of Zamboanga del Sur that is located in the heartlands of the Zamboanga peninsula. It is north-west of the fertile Salug Valley and its land boundaries are the municipality of Sergio Osmeña, Sr. of Zamboanga del Norte in the north, the municipality of Mahayag in the east, the municipalities of Sominot and Midsalip in the south, and the municipality of Siayan in the west. Dumingag is classified as a 3rd class municipality and, as of the August 2007 census, has a population of about 46,039.\n\nOriginally, Dumingag was a barrio, and was part of the municipality of Molave. It was created in 1950 and the first barrio lieutenant back then was Jose Montuerto. On December 27, 1957, by virtue of Executive Order No. 283 issued by President Carlos P. Garcia, Dumingag finally became a municipality. Ever since it acquired its municipality status, a total of five people have handled the position of municipal mayor. They are Isidoro Y. Real, Sr (1957-1978), Julian C. Kho (1978-1986), Domeciano Y. Real (1986-1998), Edgardo J. Jamero (1998-2007), and Nacianceno M. Pacalioga, Jr., who's currently the mayor now. Of all the mayors who served the position, Isidro Y. Real, Sr. is widely considered to be the municipality's father and builder, him being the first mayor and the one who has served the longest.\nThe first inhabitants of Dumingag were the Subanens who initially came from the coastal areas of the province and the neighboring province of Misamis Occidental. Prior to that, the place was once a vast expanse of jungle and marshland. There is no exact reason how the municipality got its name but the most popular one says that it came from the names of a noted Subanen chieftain and his wife, Dumi, and Ingag.\nDumingag is slowly carving its name as one of the most rapidly improving municipalities of the whole region. It has been getting awards and citations in different fields, local and national. It is fast heading to progress and rapid development.\n\nThe town is bounded by the Province of Zamboanga del Norte on the western and northern side, Mahayag on the East, and the towns, Midsalip and Sominot on the South. It is the northernmost town in the province.\n\n"}

Some years later Tambulig became independent and was recognized as a township with the land of Josefina still tagged as part of its territories.

These settlers came from Tudela, Misamis Occidental, a barrio part of Tambulig was established and was named Bagong Tudela.\n\nSome years passed and the Paredes family, one of the first settlers, was able to acquire properties there and named it \"Salug Estate\". A member of the family was a rubber technologist at that time and worked in Borneo. He brought along his lessons and expertise and together with the locals, \"the Subanen\", planted his land with Rubber Trees. By then the Rubber Technologist, Nicholas Paredes, coined the name \"New Town\" for the new rubber plantation.\n\nWith the rubber plantation, the place was then locally called as \"Gumahan\". This became a new trading center and small businesses came bustling. With the increased activity in this new location it was then christened as \"Upper Bagong Tudela\". This eventually became the center of the new community.\n\nIn the early 1970s, the people of Gumahan and its outlying barrios made a move, through the leadership of Nicholas Paredes, to create a town. They were able to submit the proposal to congress, through the sponsorship of then Cong. Cerilles, and it passed the 2nd congressional reading. When scheduled for the 3rd and final congressional reading, Martial Law was declared dissolving the Congress.\n\nOn November 11, 1978, by virtue of Presidential Decree 1240, 13 barangays of Tambulig were separated and formed into the independent municipality Josefina.

{"id": "2144166", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2144166", "title": "Cainnech of Aghaboe", "text": "Cainnech of Aghaboe\n\nSaint Cainnech of Aghaboe (515/16–600), also known as Saint Canice in Ireland, Saint Kenneth in Scotland, Saint Kenny and in Latin Saint Canicus, was an Irish abbot, monastic founder, priest and missionary during the early medieval period. Cainnech is one of the Twelve Apostles of Ireland and preached Christianity across Ireland and to the Picts in Scotland. He wrote a commentary on the Gospels, which for centuries was known as the \"Glas-Choinnigh\" or \"Kenneth's Lock\" or the \"Chain of Cainnech\".\n\nMost of what is written about Cainnech's life is based on tradition, however he was considered a man of virtue, great eloquence and learning. His feast day is commemorated on 11 October in the Roman Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox Church according to their respective calendars (Gregorian or Church Julian) with additional feast days on 1st or 14 August in the Eastern Orthodox Church.\n\nA lot of what is known of Cainnech comes from legend. However, he is documented by Saint Adomnán (also known as Eunan), the ninth abbot of Iona who died in 704. Adomnán was a hagiographer and his greatest work \"Vita Columbae\" or \"Life of St. Columba\" contains references to Cainnech.\n\nCainnech was born in 515 or 516, at Glengiven, near Dungiven in Ulster, the northern province in Ireland. His full name was Cainnech moccu Dalánn.\n\nCainnech's father Lughadh Leithdhearg was descended from the CorcoDalann or Ui Dalainn, a tribe whose ancestor, Dalann, is traced back to Fergus (King of Ulster), son of Ross, son of Rudhraighe. The Corco-Dalann were from an island referred to as \"Insula Nuligi\", and is usually identified with Inis-Doimhle or Inis-Uladh, which is now the Little Island, in the River Suir, south-east of Waterford.\n\nLughadh was a distinguished bard, a highly trained, professional itinerant poet. Lughadh settled at Glengiven, in what is now County Londonderry. Lughadh ended up under the favour and protection of the chief of Cianachta, and became the tutor of the chieftain's son, Geal Breagach.\n\nCainnech's mother was called Maul or Mella. She attained an eminent degree of sanctity. The church of Thompleamoul or Capella Sanctae Maulae seu Mellae, beside Kilkenny city, was dedicated to God under her invocation.\n\nIn early Christian Ireland the druid tradition collapsed, with the spread of the new faith. The study of Latin and Christian theology flourished in monasteries.\n\nCainnech spent his early years watching his chieftain's flocks. In 543 Cainnech became a pupil at Finnian's monastic school at Clonard. During the sixth century, some of the most significant names in the history of Irish Christianity studied at the Clonard monastery. Twelve students who studied under St. Finian became known as the Twelve Apostles of Ireland, Cainnech was one of these. It was at Clonard that Cainnech became a friend and companion of St Colmcille (Columba).\n\nIn 544 he studied under St. Mobhi at the school of Glasnevin, with Kieran of Clonmacnoise and St. Comgall of Bangor. When plague scattered that community, he went to Saint Cadoc's monastery of Llancarfan in Glamorganshire in Wales, where he was ordained a priest in 545.\n\nHe left for Rome to obtain the blessing of the reigning pontiff. In 550 he had returned to Glengiven, where he converted his foster-brother, Geal-Breagach, who afterwards assisted him in founding Drumachose, in nearby Limavady.\n\nIn 565 Cainnech joined Columba in Scotland, where he is known as St. Kenneth. Adamnan tells of the arrival of Cainnech, on Iona. St. Columba had a prophecy of a \"certain holy and excellent man, who will arrive here among us before evening.\" According to Adamnan, God provided Cainnech with a safe and calm crossing, even though the sea was perilous and stormy that day. St. Columba received him that evening with all honour and hospitality.\n\nCainnech built a church in the place now known as Saint Andrews. He built monastic cells on the island of Ibdon, possibly South Uist, and Eninis, an oratory called Lagan-Kenny on the shores of Loch Laggan (the remains of which are marked on the OS map), and a monastery in Fife on the banks of the Eden. The saint may have been an important saint in converting South Uist to Christianity. Cainnech's name is still recalled in the ruins of an ancient church, Kil-Chainnech on Tiree, in a burial ground, Kil-Chainnech, in Iona and Inch Kenneth off Mull.\n\nCainnech spent a good deal of his time in County Meath and Ossory in what is now County Laois. In Ossory he had a good repute with the king, Colmann son of Feradach. Colman gave him grants of land including Aghaboe (\"the field of the Ox\") which became his principal monastery. Aghaboe grew in importance, and in the 7th century sent St. Feargal as a missionary to the church of Salzburg, Austria. Aghaboe was for a time the site of the bishop's see until under Norman influence in the twelfth century the see transferred from Aghaboe to Kilkenny. In 1346 Diarmaid Mac Giollaphádraig burned the town of Aghaboe, and completely destroyed Cainnech's shrine along with his relics.\nKilkenny (Irish: Cill Chainnigh \"The Church of Cainnech\") was originally the name of a church erected by or dedicated to Cainnech, but was afterwards extended to the townland and parish. Kilkenny was one of the last parts of Ireland to be converted to Christianity. Tradition asserts that in 597, Cainnech led a Christian force to Kilkenny to eliminate the last bastion of Druidic rule in Ireland. The last Archdruid of Ireland had retired with his Council to a mound in Kilkenny for safety. Cainnech led an army there and overcame them. He founded a monastery near what is now the Church of Ireland's St. Canice's Cathedral. He died and was interred at Abbey of Aghaboe in 599/600.\n\nIn his old age Cainnech retired to an island in what was once Loch Cree, and wrote a commentary on all four Gospels. This became known as \"Glass Kinnich\" (\"Glas-Chainnigh\") or the \"Chain of Cainnech\". This was long preserved in his church and became a continuous commentary in the Middle Ages.\n\nCainnech is the patron of Aghaboe and together with St. Ciarán of Saigir, is one of the patrons of Kilkenny and the historic kingdom of Osraige. St. Cainnech is also the patron saint of the shipwrecked.\n\n\n\nThis is a Troparion of St Cainnech. \nIn honour thou dost rank with Ireland's Enlightener, \nO Lover of the Desert, Composer of sacred verse, \nFather of Monks and Founder of Monasteries, O Father Cainnech. \nLabouring for Christ, both in thy native land and in Scotland, \nthou art a tireless intercessor for the faithful. \nPray for us who hymn thee, that despite our frailty we may be granted great mercy.\n\n\n\n"}

He is best known for his appearances with World Championship Wrestling from 1993 to 1996 under the ring name Dave Sullivan, where he played the dyslexic brother of Kevin Sullivan.\n\nDannenhauer attended Westside High School, where both he and his brother wrestled. He and his brother attended the University of Nebraska Omaha, where they played football for the Omaha Mavericks. Dannenhauer went on to play for the short-lived United States Football League before ending his playing career. He went on to serve as an assistant coach for the Mavericks before joining Washburn University as offensive coordinator for the Washburn Ichabods.\n\nIn 1989, Dannehauer decided to become a wrestler after meeting Harley Race at a high school tournament. He trained under Len Denton and debuted later that year.\n\nDanenhauer started wrestling in 1989 in the National Wrestling Alliance territory Pacific Northwest Wrestling under the ring name \"The Equalizer\". He teamed with The Grappler as \"The Wrecking Crew\", with the duo winning the NWA Pacific Northwest Tag Team Championship on two occasions.\n\nIn 1990, he would tour on and off with Catch Wrestling Association for two years under the name \"The Barbarian\".\n\nIn 1991, he briefly wrestled in New Japan Pro Wrestling, most notably losing a match to Scott Norton on March 21 at the Tokyo Dome.\n\nIn 1992, Danenhauer left PNW for the Global Wrestling Federation where he wrestled as \"Captain Ron\". He would tour the United Kingdom under the name \"American Hawkwind.\"\n\nIn 1993, Danenhauer joined World Championship Wrestling as The Equalizer, and teamed briefly with Rick Rude as his tag team partner/bodyguard. They feuded with Dustin Rhodes and Road Warrior Hawk. He also teamed with Paul Orndorff.\n\nHis biggest push started in the summer of 1994 when he became \"Dave Sullivan\" the dyslexic brother of Kevin Sullivan who regularly mispronounced his own forename as \"Evad\". He was being picked on by The Nasty Boys and brought Kevin in to help him against them. He was injured by them, so Kevin Sullivan brought in Cactus Jack to help them out. After Kevin and Jack took care of The Nasty Boys, they split up, and Jack left. Hulk Hogan made his WCW debut that summer, and Sullivan became his biggest fan. Kevin hated Hogan, and problems started brewing.\n\nSullivan started teaming with Hogan and Sting against Ric Flair and his henchmen, and Kevin soon turned on Dave, which started a feud that went into 1995. After his feud with Kevin ended, Dave fell in love with Kimberly, the valet of Diamond Dallas Page. Page took offense to this and started a feud with Dave that lasted all summer. During this feud, Dave gave Kimberly presents, which infuriated Page even more. Sullivan eventually lost the feud and moved on.\n\nSullivan's next feud was with Big Bubba Rogers. Sullivan had a pet rabbit that he brought to ringside with him, and Bubba was allergic to rabbits. Bubba started wearing a surgical mask to keep from inhaling the allergins, but Sullivan would always pull it off and get the victory. Danenhauer left WCW in early 1996 after participating in the first World War 3 event.\n\nDanenhauer retired from professional wrestling in 2001 due to the cumulative impact of injuries sustained in his football and wrestling careers. He relocated to Bentonville, Arkansas, where he worked for Wal-Mart as a fitness trainer. In 2003, he began working as offensive coordinator for the Vikings football team of Dana College in Blair, Nebraska. He was later appointed athletics director.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2144171", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2144171", "title": "GNOME Terminal", "text": "GNOME Terminal\n\nGNOME Terminal is a terminal emulator for the GNOME desktop environment written by Havoc Pennington and others. Terminal emulators allow users to access a UNIX shell while remaining on their graphical desktop.\n\nGNOME Terminal ('gnome-terminal' from the command line or GNOME's Alt-F2 launcher) emulates the xterm terminal emulator and provides some of the same features.\n\nGNOME Terminal supports multiple profiles. A user can create multiple profiles for his or her account. Users can then set configuration options on a per-profile basis and assign a name to each profile. The available configuration options range from different fonts, different colors, emission of the terminal bell, the behavior of scrolling, and how the terminal handles compatibility with the backspace and delete key.\n\nWhen GNOME Terminal starts, it can be configured to launch the user's default shell or run a custom command. These options can be configured per profile, allowing users to execute different commands depending on the profile. For example, some users may have one profile to launch their default shell, another profile that connects to another computer remotely through SSH, and finally a profile that opens a GNU Screen session.\n\nGNOME Terminal supports a couple of different compatibility options for interfacing with older software that depends on varying keyboard-to-ASCII assignments. In computing, there has been ambiguity between the backspace key and delete key. When the user presses the backspace key, the computer can either delete the character before the cursor, or the character at the cursor, which introduces this ambiguity (see ASCII). GNOME Terminal allows the user specify which control character or escape sequence the delete and the backspace keys should generate. Users can specify this option on a per-profile basis.\n\nColored text is available in GNOME Terminal, although users may turn this feature off. GNOME Terminal supports a basic set of 16 colors, which the user can choose. Furthermore, GNOME Terminal has support for a palette of 256 colors by default. Some programs, such as vim, can use that many colors.\n\nAs of version 3.12, it also supports RGB direct true colors.\n\nGNOME Terminal allows changing background settings on per profile basis. Available options are solid color.\n\nOlder versions also included transparent background option, which allowed to see windows beneath terminal window. Although this option was dropped shortly after 3.6 release, several Linux distributions including Ubuntu and Fedora patch their packages of GNOME Terminal to re-enable this feature.\n\nAlthough GNOME Terminal is primarily a command-line interface and uses the keyboard for most input, GNOME Terminal has limited support for mouse events. GNOME Terminal can capture mouse scrolls and both left and right clicks. Presently, it cannot\ndetect the location of the mouse, but some terminal applications can utilize the mouse events, such as aptitude or vim. At this time, there is no support for touch based gestures.\n\nSince version 3.12 (incorporating version 0.35 of the VTE widget), GNOME Terminal supports text re-wrapping on re-sizing (long lines of text already printed to the terminal's standard out are reflowed to fit the new line width when the dimensions of the terminal window are resized). This behaviour is similar to that of GNU Screen and other curses-based applications such as less.\n\nGNOME Terminal parses the output and automatically detects snippets of text that appear to be URLs or email addresses. When a user points to a URL, the text is automatically underlined, indicating that the user may click. Upon clicking, the appropriate application will open to access that resource.\n\nMultiple terminal sessions may be organized within single GNOME Terminal window as tabs. Switching between active session is possible either by using keyboard shortcuts or by using tab bar – a row of buttons, each corresponding to active session, that appears on top of GNOME Terminal window when multiple tabs are used. Similar to the profile feature, each tab can be assigned a name.\n\nIn recent versions, when the user attempts to quit the entire graphical application, GNOME Terminal will prompt the user with a dialog box to confirm if the user truly wants to exit GNOME Terminal. This feature is intended to reduce the risk of accidentally closing a terminal window (e.g., by clicking the window's close button) with a job still running. If a job is running and the user closes the window, the job will quit and the user will have to restart the job if exiting was an accident.\n\nThis feature is only present when the user closes the application through the graphical interface. If the user attempts to quit with the exit shell command, it is the responsibility of the user's shell to confirm the exit. Although not a GNOME Terminal feature, some shells, e.g. tcsh and bash, offer similar functionality and will notify the user that there are stopped jobs.\n\nGNOME Terminal is largely based on the VTE widget (which replaced the older zvt widget). VTE, part of the GNOME project, has widgets that implement a fully functional terminal emulator. GNOME Terminal and VTE are both written in C.\n\nVTE is a library (libvte) implementing a terminal emulator widget for GTK, and a minimal sample application (vte) using that. Vte is mainly used in gnome-terminal, but can also be used to embed a console/terminal in games, editors, IDEs, etc.\n\nThe VTE library provides a terminal emulator widget VteTerminal for applications using the GTK toolkit. It also provides the VtePTY object containing functions for starting a new process on a new pseudo-terminal and for manipulating pseudo-terminals.\n\nAt least GNOME terminal, XFCE terminal, ROX terminal, evilvte, guake, sakura, terminator and vala-terminal rely on vte.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2144172", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2144172", "title": "Bobby Zamora", "text": "Bobby Zamora\n\nRobert Lester Zamora (born 16 January 1981) is an English former professional footballer who played as a striker. Zamora began his career at Football League club Bristol Rovers, but was soon signed by Brighton & Hove Albion, where he found first-team success. Zamora scored 77 goals in three seasons and helped the club achieve two successive promotions.\n\nFollowing a spell at Tottenham Hotspur, Zamora was signed by West Ham United, where he played for five years and won promotion to the Premier League. Zamora joined Fulham in 2008, where, in his first season, he played regularly but scored only four goals. However, Zamora's form in the 2009–10 season gained praise and subsequently saw the player gain a call-up for England. Zamora had an important role in Fulham's successes in the Premier League, FA Cup and UEFA Europa League, before transferring to Queens Park Rangers in January 2012. He returned to play for Brighton in 2015 and retired from football in December 2016.\n\nZamora also played for the England national under-21 team before gaining his first full cap at senior level almost a decade later.\n\nBorn in Barking, London, Zamora attended Essex Junior School (in Manor Park) followed by Little Ilford School before moving onto Barking Abbey Secondary School. As a boy, he played for Senrab in east London, alongside John Terry, Ledley King, Paul Konchesky and Jlloyd Samuel. A lifelong West Ham United fan, he started his footballing career as an apprentice at the club's Academy of Football but was released from the east London club on the same year group as Samuel, Fitz Hall and Konchesky.\n\nZamora joined Bristol Rovers as a trainee in August 1999, making a total of six substitute appearances for Bristol Rovers in all competitions, before joining Bath City on a one-month loan in early 2000, where he scored 11 goals in eight appearances, and then Brighton & Hove Albion on loan in February 2000.\n\nZamora joined Brighton in February 2000 on a three-month loan until the end of the 1999–2000 season, scoring six goals in six appearances. In August 2000, he made a permanent move to Brighton for a £100,000 fee. During his tenure he quickly established himself as a prolific goalscorer, breaking into the England national under-21 team and attracting interest from several higher-division clubs. He scored 83 times for the club in 136 appearances, helping Brighton win two successive championships as the team won promotion into what became the Championship. The Brighton fans had a chant they used to sing in his honour, to the tune of Dean Martin's \"That's Amore\": \"When the ball hits the goal it's not Shearer or Cole, it's Zamora.\"\n\nHaving been watched for much of the previous two seasons by the then manager Glenn Hoddle, Zamora moved to Tottenham Hotspur for a £1.5 million fee in July 2003. However, he struggled to gain a consistent first-team place at White Hart Lane, making only 18 cup and league appearances, 11 as substitute, and scoring a single goal, knocking West Ham United out of the League Cup in October 2003.\n\nIn January 2004, Zamora joined West Ham in a deal which saw Jermain Defoe go the other way to Tottenham Hotspur. He quickly made his mark, scoring on his debut as West Ham came from behind to beat Bradford City and also on his home debut, when he scored the winning goal against Cardiff City.\n\nIn the 2004–05 season, Zamora scored 13 goals, including one in the first leg and two in the second leg of the Championship play-off semi-final against Ipswich Town and the only goal in West Ham's 1–0 victory over Preston North End in the 2005 Championship play-off Final sending West Ham into the Premier League.\nIn the 2005–06 season, he made 42 league and cup appearances and scored ten goals as West Ham finished in the top half of the Premier League and reached the FA Cup final, for which he received an FA Cup runners-up medal, missing a penalty in the shootout against Liverpool. He was rewarded for his contribution to the team with a new four-year contract in January 2006, and extended it to 2011 in October 2006, saying, \"\"I'm delighted to have extended my contract and I'm now looking forward to spending my long-term future at Upton Park. I've been here for almost three years now, and there is really no other place I would rather be. This is my club and wearing a claret and blue shirt is all I have ever wanted to do.\"\"\n\nHe started the 2006–07 season well, scoring five of the Hammers' six goals in the first four matches of the season but, as West Ham hit a bad patch that saw them struggling in the relegation places, he did not score again until January 2007. However, he ended the season with 11 goals, including a controversial goal against Blackburn Rovers in March 2007 and being the first player to score a winning goal against Arsenal at the Emirates Stadium in April 2007, as West Ham pulled off an unexpected escape from relegation. He made only 14 appearances for West Ham in the 2007–08 season after missing five months of the season with tendinitis suffered in August 2007 but scored against Derby in the Hammers' 2–1 win. By the end of the 2007–08 season, Zamora had made 152 appearances in all competitions for West Ham, scoring 40 goals.\n\nIn July 2008, Zamora and teammate John Paintsil were signed by Fulham for a joint total of £6.3 million, Zamora accounting for £4.8 million of the fee. In his first season with Fulham, Zamora struggled to find the net, scoring just twice in 35 league appearances over the 2008–09 season. After the season had concluded, Fulham and Hull City agreed a fee on 15 July, which would have seen Zamora move to Hull for £5 million. Zamora turned down the move to stay with Fulham.\n\nShortly after he turned down Hull, he played in a friendly against Peterborough United and scored twice in a 3–3 draw. Four days later he made his UEFA Europa League debut, against FK Vėtra of Lithuania, scoring once and setting up two goals to give Fulham a 3–0 away advantage going into the second leg. He opened his 2009–10 Premier League account on the opening day of the season when a Clint Dempsey shot hit him on the back and beat David James in the Portsmouth goal. He scored his second goal of the season against Hull on 19 October 2009 by heading in a rebound in the 43rd minute as Fulham won 2–0. By scoring the lone goal against Sunderland on 6 December 2009, Zamora doubled his output from the previous season with his fourth goal of the campaign. In celebrating his winning goal, Zamora held a finger against his lips in response to the Fulham fans who had previously jeered him.\n\nOn 17 December 2009, with Fulham needing a win to progress from Group E in the UEFA Europa League, Zamora scored twice against Basel in a 3–2 victory at St. Jakob-Park. Two days later, Zamora scored once again in a 3–0 win against Manchester United at Craven Cottage prompting talk of a call-up to the England squad. On 5 January 2010, he dislocated his shoulder at the Britannia Stadium during Fulham's 3–2 loss to Stoke City.\n\nZamora struck the winner in Fulham's UEFA Europa League Round of 32 first leg match against Shakhtar Donetsk, his powerful strike from outside the box earning the Premier League side a 2–1 win. Zamora continued his scoring form on 22 February 2010 when netting a last minute free-kick against Birmingham City as Fulham came from behind to win 2–1. Zamora also scored Fulham's first goal in what was a historic UEFA Europa League comeback against Juventus, Fulham winning 4–1 on the night and 5–4 on aggregate. Zamora was widely praised for the trouble he caused Juventus' veteran captain Fabio Cannavaro, who was sent off in the 27th minute, having suggested that the Italian was past his best prior to the match. He continued to impress on the European stage for Fulham; scoring in both legs of a 3–1 aggregate win against reigning Bundesliga champions Wolfsburg as Fulham progressed to the UEFA Europa League semi-final. His goal during the second leg in Germany came after just 22 seconds. Fulham went on to reach the final of the UEFA Europa League but, with Zamora's fitness in real doubt, they were beaten 2–1 by Atlético Madrid of Spain.\n\nOn 10 September 2010, Zamora signed a new four-year contract with Fulham, which would have kept him at the London club until the summer of 2014. The day after, Zamora broke his leg during a match against Wolverhampton Wanderers following a challenge from Karl Henry that drew criticism. Zamora made his return from injury as a substitute in the FA-Cup encounter against Bolton Wanderers on 21 February 2011. He marked his Premier League return, again as a substitute, with a match-deciding goal from the penalty spot against Blackburn Rovers on 5 March 2011.\n\nOn 31 January 2012, Zamora joined Fulham's west London Premier League rivals Queens Park Rangers on a two and a half year contract for a fee believed to be around £4 million. He scored on his debut on 4 February in a 2–1 defeat to Wolverhampton Wanderers. On 21 November 2012, it was announced Zamora would be out injured for three months due to requiring surgery on a hip injury. Zamora was a member of the Queens Park Rangers side which won the 2014 Championship play-off Final 1–0 against Derby County on 24 May 2014 at Wembley Stadium. He scored the only goal of the match in the 90th minute to return QPR to the Premier League after a one-season absence. In May 2015, Queens Park Rangers announced the release of Zamora.\n\nOn 3 August 2015, Zamora joined former club Brighton on a one-year deal on a free transfer. He claimed that he turned down an approach by a team competing in the UEFA Champions League to return to Brighton. His first goal on return to Brighton was an 89th-minute winner against Leeds United on 17 October 2015, coming 4,549 days after his last goal for the club in a 2–2 draw at Grimsby on 4 May 2003. Zamora was released by Brighton when his contract expired at the end of 2015–16.\n\nZamora retired from football in December 2016. He had not played since March 2016 and had been struggling with a hip injury for which he had undergone an operation. His interests outside football include involvement in a social housing scheme with Rio Ferdinand and Mark Noble.\n\nZamora was called up for the England Under-21 squad for a friendly with Portugal in April 2002. Zamora was named in the England Under-21 squad for the 2002 UEFA European Under-21 Championship with David Platt, the then England under-21 team manager, saying of him, \"\"My mistake was not going to have a look at him earlier than I did. He's been in one squad, did very well in training and came on for 25 minutes and did great. If I need a goal and look at my bench and see a player who has scored 30 for the past two seasons, there is a chance he could come on. He warrants his place. [...]\"\" Zamora was capped six times for the England Under-21 team.\n\nZamora was watched by the Trinidad and Tobago coach, Leo Beenhakker, who also spoke to his club manager at the time Alan Pardew. However, Zamora turned down the chance of playing in the 2006 FIFA World Cup with Trinidad and Tobago, saying in August 2005, \"\"Trinidad is my dad's country and to play in the finals would be a dream but West Ham are more important. I am only thinking about the club at the moment and do not want to be distracted from that.\"\"\n\nOn 7 August 2009, it was revealed that Zamora and Jlloyd Samuel had received their Trinidadian passports, and would play for the Soca Warriors in their 2010 FIFA World Cup qualifier against El Salvador on 12 August. However, Zamora did not get his first cap due to an injury he picked up while training. His form in the 2009–10 season led to calls for Zamora to be called up to the England squad, and there had been rumours that Fabio Capello had been visiting Craven Cottage to look at his performances. However, due to an Achilles injury, he was not included in Fabio Capello's provisional squad of 30 players for the run-up to the 2010 FIFA World Cup, which was announced on 11 May 2010.\n\nOn 7 August 2010, Zamora was one of five uncapped players named in the England squad for their friendly on 11 August against Hungary alongside Jack Wilshere, Kieran Gibbs, Michael Dawson and Gary Cahill. On 11 August 2010, Zamora won his first England cap in a friendly, coming on as a half time substitute against Hungary in a 2–1 win at Wembley Stadium.\n\nOn 23 May 2011, Zamora was selected for the England squad to face Switzerland in the UEFA Euro 2012 qualifier on 4 June at Wembley Stadium. On 15 November 2011, Zamora made his full England debut by starting in the 1–0 friendly victory over Sweden at Wembley Stadium.\n\nBrighton & Hove Albion\n\nWest Ham United\n\nQueens Park Rangers\n"}

The storyline was conceived from a screenplay written by Roy Huggins and John Pogue. The film is a spin-off to the 1993 motion picture \"The Fugitive\", which in turn was based on the television series of the same name, created by Huggins. The story does not involve the character of Dr. Richard Kimble, portrayed by Harrison Ford in the initial film, but instead the plot centers on United States Deputy Marshal Sam Gerard, once again played by Tommy Lee Jones. The plot follows Gerard and his team as they pursue another fugitive, Mark Sheridan, played by Wesley Snipes, who attempts to escape government officials following an international conspiracy scandal. The cast features Robert Downey Jr., Joe Pantoliano, Daniel Roebuck, Tom Wood, and LaTanya Richardson, several of whom portrayed Deputy Marshals in the previous film.\n\nThe film was a co-production between Warner Bros. and Kopelson Entertainment. The score was composed by Jerry Goldsmith.\n\n\"U.S. Marshals\" premiered in theaters in the United States on March 6, 1998, grossing $57 million in its domestic run. The film took in an additional $45 million through international release for a worldwide total of $102 million. The film was generally met with mixed critical reviews. The film was released on home video on July 21, 1998.\n\nTwo Diplomatic Security Service (DSS) agents are killed while trying to intercept a briefcase exchange taking place in a United Nations parking garage. The murders are caught on a security camera, but the criminal escapes with top secret information.\n\nMonths later, tow truck driver Mark Warren is arrested for an illegal weapons possession charge following a vehicular collision in Chicago. Through a fingerprint check, the police determine that he is actually federal fugitive Mark Roberts, wanted for a homicide. That night, Roberts boards a prisoner transport aircraft back to New York, sharing the flight with Deputy U.S. Marshal Samuel Gerard, who is escorting prisoners unrelated to Roberts' case. Roberts thwarts an assassination attempt by a Chinese prisoner with an improvised firearm, but the bullet blows a window that depressurizes the cabin, killing the prisoner and another marshal. The pilots attempt an emergency landing but the damaged plane crashes in a river in Southern Indiana. With the plane sinking, Gerard assists in rescuing fellow marshals and officers while they retrieve the surviving prisoners, but discovers Roberts has escaped. Eight hours later, DSS Special Agent John Royce is assigned to join Gerard's team and other officers to hunt Roberts, much to Gerard's reluctance to his potential in assistance.\n\nRoberts flees to New York City, after escaping a near death encounter with law enforcement, with Gerard and his team cornering him in a swampland in Kentucky. Arriving in New York days later, he secures money, weapons and fake identification from a former fellow US Marine of Force Recon. Roberts begins conducting surveillance on a Chinese diplomat named Xiang Chen. In Chicago, Gerard and the Marshals pursue several leads, including Roberts' girlfriend Marie Bineaux as well as the airplane mechanic who hid the zip gun, whom the Marshals find murdered by Chen. Gerard and his colleagues manage to access surveillance footage of the murders in the parking garage and realize that Roberts acted in self-defense and was wearing gloves; thus couldn't have been identified by fingerprints at the scene as was earlier claimed. Confronted with the evidence, DSS Director Bertram Lamb informs Gerard and his senior supervisor that Mark Roberts is in fact Mark Sheridan, a former CIA Special Activities Division operative and a former Force Recon Marine, that went rogue during an investigation to uncover a mole within the U.S. State Department that had been selling covert secrets to China. Chen was the contact delivering the money to Sheridan for the information and when DSS agents tried to apprehend him, Sheridan killed them in defense and fled the scene.\n\nEventually, Gerard and his team catch up with Sheridan in Queens Hill Cemetery where he meets with, and threatens to expose, DSS Special Agent Frank Barrows as one of the conspirators who framed him. Chen tries to assassinate Sheridan as he leaves the cemetery, but inadvertently kills Barrows instead. Sheridan flees to a retirement home followed by Gerard, Royce and Deputy Marshal Noah Newman. Meanwhile, Chen is caught and detained by Deputy Marshals Savannah Cooper and Bob Biggs. At the senior care facility, Newman overhears a physical struggle and walks into a room where he witnesses Royce holding Sheridan at gunpoint. Royce suddenly shoots Newman with his gun and later lies to his associates, claiming Sheridan shot Newman. Sheridan escapes by swinging from the building onto the roof of a passing train. Newman dies of his gunshot wound en route to the hospital.\n\nAfter retrieving fingerprints from an abandoned vehicle at a marine loading dock, Gerard tracks down Sheridan on a freighter ship bound for Canada. During a scuffle between Sheridan and Gerard aboard the vessel, Royce shoots Sheridan, injuring him. Sheridan is later taken into custody. Gerard begins to suspect Royce may be the mole when he notices the firearm that shot Newman had its serial number filed off (in an attempt to hide it), was actually Royce's own gun earlier. Left alone to guard Sheridan's hospital room, Royce wakes Sheridan up to murder him, but Gerard steps in, confronts and kills Royce first. After leaving the hospital, Sheridan's charges are dropped as he is exonerated and released. Gerard and his team depart to honor Newman's legacy.\n\n\nFilming locations included, Metropolis, Illinois; Bay City; Shawneetown; Chicago (all Illinois); New York; Benton, Kentucky; and at Reelfoot Lake, in Lake County, Tennessee.\nThe original motion picture soundtrack for \"U.S. Marshals\" was released by the Varèse Sarabande music label on March 10, 1998. The score for the film was composed by Jerry Goldsmith and mixed by Bruce Botnick. Kenneth Hall edited the film's music.\n\nAmong mainstream critics in the U.S., the film received mixed reviews. Rotten Tomatoes gave the film a score of 26% based on reviews from 34 critics, with an average score of 5 out of 10. The site's consensus states: \"A rote albeit well-cast action thriller, \"U.S. Marshals\" suffers badly in comparison to the beloved blockbuster that preceded it.\" At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average out of 100 to critics' reviews, \"U.S. Marshals\" was given a score of 47 based on 20 reviews. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A-\" on an A+ to F scale.\nBarbara Shulgasser, writing in \"The San Francisco Examiner\", commented in positive sentiment about the acting, saying, \"The film's pacing is unimpeachable and good performances are delivered by Jones, Snipes, Irene Jacob as Sheridan's loyal girlfriend and, for brief moments, Kate Nelligan as Gerard's tough but lovable boss.\" Left impressed, Desson Howe in \"The Washington Post\" noted how \"Every story beat is expertly planned and executed.\" Howe also praised director Baird, exclaiming how he \"runs the show with a smart eye and a metronome ticking somewhere in his mind.\" In a mixed to negative review, Russell Smith of \"The Austin Chronicle\" bluntly deduced that, \"Unlike Kimble, whose innocence and decency are known from the beginning in \"The Fugitive\", Sheridan is a total cipher to both Gerard and the audience until deep into this two-hours-plus film. Ergo, we can't be expected to give a rat's ass what happens to him — and don't.\" Owen Gleiberman of \"Entertainment Weekly\" opined that \"U.S. Marshals\" was \"Lean, tense, and satisfyingly tricky.\"\n\nThe film however, was not without its detractors. Writing for the \"Chicago Sun-Times\", Roger Ebert, giving the film two and a half stars out of four, observed, \"I didn't expect \"U.S. Marshals\" to be the equal of \"The Fugitive\", and it isn't. But I hoped it would approach the taut tension of the 1993 film, and it doesn't. It has extra scenes, needless characters, an aimless plot and a solution that the hero seems to keep learning and then forgetting.\" In a primarily negative review, Mick LaSalle, writing for the \"San Francisco Chronicle\", called the film \"a bad idea to begin with.\" He noted his confusion with the plot, remarking, \"the movie tells us from the beginning that the fugitive is not quite innocent. He killed two fellow agents in self-defense. All this does is muddy the moral waters, making us queasy about the one guy we like. At no point is there ever a compelling reason to keep watching.\" Describing a mild negative opinion, James Berardinelli of \"ReelViews\" professed Marshal Gerard as exhibiting \"only a token resemblance to the character who doggedly pursued Kimball in \"The Fugitive\". As re-invented here, Gerard is a generic action hero; most of the quirks that made him interesting (and that earned Jones an Oscar) are absent. With a few minor re-writes, John McClane from the \"Die Hard\" movies could have been plugged into this role.\"\nDissatisfied with the film's quality, Jonathan Rosenbaum of the \"Chicago Reader\" said that it was \"Not so much a sequel to \"The Fugitive\" as a lazy spin-off that imitates only what was boring and artificially frenetic about that earlier thriller; the little that kept it interesting—Tommy Lee Jones's Oscar-winning inflections, better-than-average direction—is nowhere in evidence.\" Stephen Hunter, writing for \"The Washington Post\", reasoned, \"It turns out to be one of those lame double-agent things where everybody's working for everybody else, the security of Taiwan (Taiwan!) is at stake, and it never quite lurches into clarity or acquires any real emotional punch. I didn't think the end of \"The Fugitive\" was so great either: Who wants to watch doctors fistfight on a roof? But by the time it winds down, \"U.S. Marshals\" has all but destroyed itself.\" Film critic Maitland McDonagh of \"TV Guide\" was not consumed with the nature of the subject matter, declaring, \"To every hit there is a season, and a time for every sequel under heaven — no matter what narrative contortions it takes.\" She later surmised, \"The minute Gerard mocks Royce's 'nickel-plated sissy pistol,' it's clear they're headed for a cathartic showdown, and anyone who can't see which member of Gerard's merry band might as well be wearing a 'Dead Meat Walking' T-shirt really shouldn't be allowed to operate complicated machinery.\"\n\n\"U.S. Marshals\" premiered in cinemas on March 6, 1998 in wide release throughout the United States. During that weekend, the film opened in 2nd place, grossing $16,863,988 at 2,817 locations. The film \"Titanic\" was in 1st place during that weekend, with $17,605,849 in revenue.

{"id": "2144181", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2144181", "title": "Muktinath", "text": "Muktinath\n\nMuktinath is a Vishnu temple, sacred to both Hindus and Buddhists. It is located in Muktinath Valley at the foot of the Thorong La mountain pass in Mustang, Nepal. It is one of the world's highest temples (altitude 3,800 m). The site is close to the village of Ranipauwa, which is sometimes mistakenly called Muktinath.\n\nWithin Hinduism, it is known as Mukti Kshetra, which literally means the 'place of liberation' (\"moksh\").\n\nThis temple is considered to be 106th among the available 108 Divya Desam (premium temples) considered sacred by the Sri Vaishnava sect. Its ancient name in Sri Vaishnava literature was in 10 th CE (Common Era - means after 0 year ) while Buddhism was in 568 BCE (Before Common Era - Before 0 year ), origin, is \"Thiru Saligramam\". This houses the Saligram shila, considered to be the naturally available form of Sriman .\n\nBuddhists call it Chumig Gyatsa, which in Tibetan means \"Hundred Waters\". For Tibetan Buddhists, Muktinath is an important place of \"dakinis\", goddesses known as Sky Dancers, and one of the 24 Tantric places. They understand the \"murti\" to be a manifestation of Avalokiteśvara, who embodies the compassion of all Buddhas.\n\nThe central shrine of Sri Muktinath is considered by Hindu Vaishnavas to be one of the eight most-sacred shrines, known as Svayam Vyakta Ksetras. The others are Srirangam, Srimushnam, Tirupati, Naimisharanya, Thotadri, Pushkar and Badrinath. The temple is small. The \"murti\" is gold and the size of a man.\n\nThe \"prakaram\" (outer courtyard) has 108 bull faces through which water is poured. The sacred water that flows in 108 pipes around the temple complex denotes the sacred Pushkarini waters (Temple Tanks) from the 108 Sri Vaishnava Divya Desams, where devotees take their sacred bath even in freezing temperatures.\n\nWorship is conducted by Buddhists, with a Buddhist monk present. A local nun manages the \"pujas\" (prayer rituals) in the temple. Pilgrims are expected to offer a \"prasad\" (religious offering of food) to the deity.\n\nThe Muktinath Temple is considered to be a Shakti Peetha for a \"yatra\". It is one of the 108 Siddhpeeth and is named Mahadevi [Devibhagwat 7.14]. Shakti Peethas are sacred abodes of Shakti (primordial cosmic energy), formed by the falling body parts of the corpse of Sati Devi, when Lord Shiva carried it as he wandered. 51 Shakti Peethas are revered by Shaktism, connecting them to the 51 alphabets in Sanskrit. Each Shakti Peetha has a Shakti shrine and a Bhairav shrine in its temple. The Shakti of Muktinath is addressed as \"Gandaki Chandi\", and the Bhairava as \"Chakrapani\". Sati Devi's temple on the forehead is believed to have fallen there.\n\nThe Tibetan Buddhist tradition states that Guru Rinpoche, also known as Padmasambhava, the founder of Tibetan Buddhism, meditated at Muktinath on his way to Tibet. This temple is praised by many saints of the Hindu tradition. Scripts narrating the temple's importance are available in Vishnu Purana with the Gandaki Mahathmya.\n\nThe waterway downstream from Muktinath along Kali Gandaki is the source of the Silas or Shaligrams that are required to establish a temple of Vishnu. It is considered to be one of the holiest places of pilgrimage for Hindus and Buddhists.\n\nIt has 108 water springs, a number that carries great significance in Hindu philosophy. As an example of the mystery surrounding the number 108, Hindu astrology mentions 12 zodiacs (or Rashi) and 9 planets (or Graha), giving a total of 108 combinations. 27 lunar mansions (or Nakshatras) are divided into four quarters (or Padas) each giving a combination of 108 Padas in total.\n\nHindu and Buddhist traditions claim this site to be the only place on Earth to host all five elements (fire, water, sky, earth and air) from which all material things in the universe are made.\n\nThe riverbed of the Gandaki river has Shaligram stones that are used to worship Lord Vishnu.\n\nAccording to Sri Vaishnava philosophy, it is considered to be one of the most-sacred places of worship of Lord Vishnu, praised by Thirumangai Alwar in the compilation of Nalayira Divya Prabandha 10 Pasurams in Mudal pathu Iyndham thirumozhi.\n\nIt is said that one has to be gifted to get the \"darśan\" (divine presence). Lord Sri Vishnu \"murthi\" and Goddess Sri Devi and Bhoo Devi are believed to give Jeevan Mukthi, hence it is called Mukthinath.\n\nSri Vaishnava tradition is a sub-sect of Hinduism, predominant in present-day Tamil Nadu in southern India. The river Ghantaki, flowing adjacent to the temple has a kind of stone called Salagram. The different patterns of the stone are worshiped as different forms of Vishnu. The colour white is considered Vasudeva, black as Vishnu, green as Narayana, blue as Krishna, golden yellow & reddish yellow as Narasimha and Vamana in yellow. The stones are found in various shapes with even shapes of conch and Chakra, the symbols of Vishnu.\n\nThe temple is revered in \"Nalayira Divya Prabandham\", the 7th–9th century Vaishnava canon, by Kulasekhara Alvar in one hymn. The temple is classified as a \"Divyadesam\", one of the 108 Vishnu temples that are mentioned in the book. Many devotees have contributed to it, most prominently the Alvars. Thirumangai Alvar could not reach Muktinath, but sang 10 pashurams from the nearest place, in praise of Lord Sri Murthy. Periy Alvar sang in praise of Sri Murthi as \"Salagramamudaiya Nambi\".\n\nThe pontiff of Srivilliputtur (the most venerated Srivaishnava pilgrim centre in Tamil Nadu), Sri Manavala Mamunigal Mutt H.H 23rd peetam Sri Sri Sri Satakopa Ramanuja Jeeyar Swamiji installed the idols of Andal (Sri Gotha Devi), Ramanuja, and Manavala Mamunigal there during the \"yagna\" performed between 3 and 6 August 2009. This is considered by devotees to be a milestone in the history of Muktinath. A large crowd of devotees visit this shrine, where the Lord resides in the form of Sri Paramapatha Nathan with his divine consorts of Sri, Bhoomi, Neela and Gotha Devis.\n\nNote: No need for special trekking permit. (Required only for annapoorna)\n\nRoad - From Kathmandu -> Pokhra ->Beni -> Ghasa -> Jomsom (Hill Base)\n\nBest option - Take direct buses early morning from Kathmandu(Thamel) arrive Beni at night 8pm. From Beni take direct buses to Jomsom early in the morning. Thus arriving mukthinath by 12pm, This will enable plenty of time for darshan and also for return.\n\nAir - Bangalore/Chennai/Delhi/Mumbai - Kathmandu -> Pokhra ->Jomsom (Hill Base)\nNote - Direct flight from bangalore to Kathmandu, also direct flights available from New Delhi.\n\nThere are many hotels and lodges available at Mukthinath temple. Also, accommodation and food are available at hill base JAMSOM.\n\n"}
{"id": "2144182", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2144182", "title": "Plurality opinion", "text": "Plurality opinion\n\nA plurality opinion is in certain legal systems the opinion from a group of judges, often in an appellate court, in which no single opinion supports a majority of the court. The plurality opinion did not receive the support of more than half the justices, but received more support than any other opinion, excluding those dissenting from the holding of the court.\n\nIn \"Marks v. United States\", 430 U.S. 188 (1977), the Supreme Court of the United States explained how the holding of a case should be viewed where there is no majority supporting the rationale of any opinion: “When a fragmented Court decides a case and no single rationale explaining the result enjoys the assent of five Justices, the holding of the Court may be viewed as that position taken by those Members who concurred in the judgments on the narrowest grounds.” \"Marks\", 430 U.S. at 193.\n\nThat requires lower courts to look at all opinions to determine which is the most narrow compared to others. This opinion will be called the controlling opinion, and can be a mere concurrence, not the plurality.\n\nThe \"Marks Rule\" has raised the following schools of thought regarding the appropriate basis for determining the holding in such fractured cases: (a) the narrowest analysis essential to the result derived from a combination of all concurring opinions, (\"Pedcor Mgmt. Co. Welfare Benefit Plan v. Nations Pers. of Tex., Inc.\", 343 F.3d 355, 358-59 (5th Cir. 2003)); (b) the concurring opinion offering the narrowest rationale, (\"e.g. Horn v. Thoratec Corp.\", 376 F.3d 163, 175-76 (3d Cir. 2004)); or (c) only those parts of the concurring opinions which overlap and arrive at the same result. For example, if one follows the first interpretation, then the holding in the case should be viewed as the narrowest rationale supported by all of the concurring opinions read together as though it were a single majority opinion, and where there is a conflict, the opinion based on the narrowest ground governs. Followers of the second rationale would find the concurring opinion offering the narrowest analysis to be the holding. Whereas, under the third interpretation, only the rationale(s) common to all concurring opinions which arrive at the same result(s) (and to the exclusion of all other rationales) is considered the holding.\n\nA good example of a plurality opinion can be found in the Supreme Court's decision in \"Crawford v. Marion County Election Board\", 553 U.S. 181 (2008). In considering whether Indiana's voter identification law passed constitutional muster, three justices believed the proper analysis was to apply the balancing approach laid down in \"Anderson v. Celebrezze\", 460 U.S. 780 (1983). Three other justices agreed with the outcome of the \"Anderson\" approach, but believed the proper analysis was to apply the rule in \"Burdick v. Takushi\", 504 U.S. 428 (1992), which \"forged \"Anderson\"'s amorphous 'flexible standard' into something resembling an administrable rule.\" Regardless of the approach used, a reading of the opinions together results in a holding that \"neutral, nondiscriminatory regulation of voting procedure\" is constitutional so long as the burden imposed by the regulation is minimal or not severe.\n\n"}
{"id": "2144185", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2144185", "title": "Sam'al", "text": "Sam'al\n\nSam'al (Zincirli Höyük) was founded at least as far back as the Early Bronze Age. It was largely abandoned during the Hittite and Mittani periods then flourished again in the Iron Age, initially under Luwian speaking Neo-Hittites, and by the 920 BC had become a kingdom. In the 9th and 8th century BC it came under control of the Neo-Assyrian Empire and by the 7th century BC it had become a directly ruled Assyrian province. It is located in the Anti-Taurus Mountains of modern Turkey's Gaziantep Province.\n\nThe site of Sam'al was occupied in the Early Bronze Age, and is thought to be part of the kingdom of Yamhad (Aleppo) early in the second millennium. It was then abandoned but later rose again in the Iron Age, eventually becoming a kingdom. With the rise of the Neo-Assyrian Empire, Sam'al became a vassal state and later a province of that empire.\n\nKingdom of Sam'al (in Samalian \"Yādiya\", in Aramaic \"Ya'udi\") was a middle power of the Middle-East in the first half of the 1st millennium BCE. It was near the Nur Mountains. Sam'al was the capital of the country. Royal steles and stone tablets from the period, of Kilamuwa and Panamuwa II, are the main sources for historical data about this timeperiod.\n\nIt became a middle power at the end of the 10th century BCE. It had expanded from being a city state and gained territories from Carchemish, around Adana from Quwê and remained independent. It didn't become part of Cilicia. In 859 BC Alimus was saved with the help of Hayyanu, king of Sam'al. He didn't participate in the Battle of Qarqar in 853 BC, but Assyria had been blocked in the Western area. Though the campaign of Assyria in 825 BC occupied the vital territories of Sam'al, Quwê had been defeated, but it had been reorganised as Denyen. After the death of Shalmaneser III, Ya'udi again became independent.\n\nSome rulers of Sam'al had aggressive expansionist politics; others acceded to one of the anti-Assyrian Syrian coalition. Assyrian sources are not clear regarding Sam'al. Ya'udi was one of Assyria's satellite states in the annals of Shalmaneser III. Though around 830 BC Azitawadda, king of Denyen, states Ya'udi is his satellite country – at the same time, Kilamuwa mentions on his stela that he hired Assyria against Denyen. Other sources from the same period mention Ya'udi as a satellite state of Denyen and Assyria wanted to occupy this territory. Kilamuva might offer for Deyen to be a satellite state. Before this, he should defeat his greatest foe, Azitawadda. Assyrians won over Denyen and Sam'al in 825 BC. Sam'al became independent after the death of Shalmaneser III.\n\nThere is an alternative opinion which states that Ya'udi and Sam'al were originally separate royal houses and Sam'al, the younger of the two, fought against the Assyrians at Alimus in 859 BC, in 858 BC when Shalmanser III crossed the Euphrates for the first time, and again in 853 BC at the Battle of Qarqar. The Kingdom of Sam'al was founded by Hayyanu and his successor was Ahabbu of Siri'laya (Zincirli) in 854 BC. Whereas Gabar, the founder of Ya'udi, and his successors became a member of the Assyrian satellites. This makes clear why Shalmaneser III lists Ya'udi (Bit-Gabbari) but not Sam'al as a satellite state. The Kingdom of Ya'udi wanted to open a corridor between Assyria and Denyen. It was prevented by the unified Syrian forces. This unity had been dissolved in 825 BC. After the death of Shalmanezer III Denyen couldn't occupy it but the Samalians could. Sam'al annexed Ya'udi and moved into the palace of Kilamuva.\n\nAt the end, in 717 BC, Assyria occupied the country under the rule of Sargon II.\n\nThe site was excavated in 1888, 1890, 1891, 1894 and 1902 during expeditions led by Felix von Luschan and Robert Koldewey. Each of the expeditions was supported by the German Orient Committee, except for the fourth (1894), which was financed with monies from the Rudolf-Virchow-Stiftung and private donors.\n\nThey found a heavily fortified teardrop-shaped citadel, which was surrounded by the as yet unexcavated town and a further enormous double fortification wall with three gates and 100 bastions. Among the notable objects found at the site are five giant statues of lions carved from stone, which apparently had guarded the gates of the city, but may have been ritually buried together within the citadel. The German excavations on the citadel recovered large numbers of relief-carved orthostats, along with inscriptions in Aramaic, Phoenician, and Akkadian. These are on exhibit in the Pergamon Museum, Berlin, and Istanbul. Also found was the notable Victory stele of Esarhaddon celebrating his victory over Taharqa. The field diaries of the excavation were lost during World War II.\n\nIn August 2006, the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago began a new long-term excavation project at the site of Zincirli under the directorship of David Schloen. Seven seasons of excavation have been conducted through 2012.\nThree royal inscriptions from Ya'udi or Sam'al are particularly informative for the history of the area. The earliest is from the reign of King Panammu I, the others later at 730 BCE. Their language is known as Samalian or Ya'udic. Some scholars including P.-E. Dion. and S. Moscati have advanced Samalian as a distinct variety of Old Aramaic. Attempts to establish a rigorous definition of \"Aramaic\" have led to a conclusion of Samalian as distinct from Aramaic, despite some shared features.\n\nKuttamuwa was an 8th-century BC royal official from Sam'al who ordered an inscribed stele, that was to be erected upon his death.

They are produced by Spanish company Magic Box Int., and PPI Worldwide Group, the sole distributor in North America.\n\nCrazy Bones was inspired by a children's game played in Ancient Greece and Rome called 'Astragal' (Knucklebones), where children played a similar game using sheep's knucklebones.\nThis ancient pastime is also known as Tabas.\nGames played are reminiscent of marbles and jacks.\nCrazy Bones is a modern version of this game, played with characters molded from plastic. There are hundreds of individual characters, each character having a unique face and name. Each series has a number of 'rare' (referred to as 'wanted', 'most wanted' or 'w' on trading cards.) pieces that are sought after by collectors and are sold on numerous websites for many times their original value.\n\nCrazy Bones was launched in the United States by Peter Gantner after witnessing the success of Barcelona-based GoGos in Spain, which had sold over 350 million packs from its inception in 1996 to 1997.\nGantner formed Toy Craze in December 1997 with his brother David Gantner and businessman Scott Harris, and the company acquired the distribution rights in the US.\nSome sources indicate Bill Flaherty, who became President of Toy Craze, also founded the company.\nGogos agreed to provide him with inventory with no upfront costs in return for 50% of all profits.\nThis deal was later renegotiated, and the manufacturer was later paid a royalty of sales.\nA small company at the time of inception, Crazy Bones became a popular fad in the late 90s. The product was aggressively marketed to children, and promotional events took place in scout meetings, club groups, fairs, and shows, where free sample packs were distributed.\nToy demos have also taken place in SkyDome, where children were given free packs and taught how to play Crazy Bones. This promotion was organized by the Canadian marketers of Crazy Bones, a joint venture by Wayne Fromm and Eric Segal of All 4 Fun Consumer Products Ltd. All 4 Fun Toy Products Ltd. also created a series of Crazy Bones for the Toronto Blue Jays, a cereal promotion with Cap'n Crunch and another with Wrigley. In 1999 and 2000 Fromm and Segal created one of Canada's largest collectible fad in the toy industry. . Fromm conceived of a musical band based on Crazy Bones in 2000, called B2Krazy. This was a joint venture between Fromm, Segal and Iron Music.\nNearly four million free packs have been distributed.\nCrazy Bones secured a number of high-profile partners, including McDonald's, which included the product as Happy Meal toys nationwide.\nThese Crazy Bones were significantly larger than the normal toys, possibly to reduce risk of choking among young children.\n\nWithin two years, the company's revenues had grown to nearly $17 million. By favoring tours of scout meetings and the like over television and print advertisements, Toy Craze has also kept its marketing costs to around 10%.\n\nCrazy Bones were originally distributed in Canada through the Concord, Ontario-based company Playtoy Industries, where they enjoyed similar success. Playtoy Industries declared bankruptcy in December 1999 and Wayne Fromm and Eric Segal catapulted Crazy Bones through a joint venture (www.frommtoys.com)\n\nCrazy Bones enjoyed incredible popularity in the late 1990s. From 1998-2000, 31.5 million packages were sold.\nOver 23 million figurines were sold in the UK and Spain in a recent relaunch between March and December 2008. \n\nCrazy Bones were banned in many schools, as they were blamed for encouraging theft, arguments, and in-class distractions.\n\nCrazy Bones was first released by an American company HotShots.\n\nHotShots later lost or sold the Crazy Bone patent. Toy Craze then obtained, distributed and licensed it, with Magic Box int. manufacturing them. \n\nThe original bones were small plastic figurines made with faces. Each bone had a different name and personality. The long line of characters included the well known Jaws, Top Hat, and Eggy. Slight variations in design with a shift to a more spooky nature, of 59-78, led to production of the Mutant set of bones. On the other hand, Things, Ghost, Aliens, Buddies, and Sports were intended as each containing brand new characters.\n\n\"Sports\" included 40 sports-uniformed Crazy Bones characters, whilst \"Buddies\" included 58 Gogos, each, like the past series, with its own function and design including: Liberty, Bookworm and Slick. In the \"Things\" series (60 units), all the bones are shaped like various everyday objects such as: a TV, a couch and a book, but as with the other series they had smiley faces. In the \"Aliens\" series, there are 60 different anthropomorphic figures of a classic grey, big eyed, alien. Some of the designs included: Salad Head (Caesar), Cyclops, Boris, Tut and others.\nA \"Third\" series of Crazy Bones (in the old packaging and design) named \"The New Generation\" was later released, including 120 all new characters. Some seem to be variations of the originals, or mutant original, but they are all meant as new characters to the series. A second sports series was released, but instead of uniformed characters, it features characters from the Original, Buddies, and Mutants series performing a sport (Eggy playing basketball or Speedy driving a car). There was also a series with magnetic characters, which are incredibly difficult to find. Rockers are music themed characters.\n\nAs of October 2010, the current distributor for Gogo's Crazy Bones in the US (as well as Canada) is Jonic Distribution North America.\n\nThe Classic series was available in Canada in the 1990s. The rebranded Gogo's Crazy Bones series 1 was sold in Canada in 2009. Series 2 became available in May 2011, then came series 3 and now series 4.\n\nIn Europe Crazy Bones are released in different sets for different countries.\n\nThe following sets have been released:\n\n\nIn March 2009, to mark the release of the \"Explorer\" series in the UK, the \"Daily Mirror\" newspaper ran a week-long promotion where they gave away free figurines, stickers and sticker books. Two of the figurines were exclusive to this giveaway\n\nIn April 2009, the Entertainer toy shop in Kingston upon Thames held a 'swap day'. Every swapper received a special 'Laser Mosh' - Mosh is the first bone in the original series. The Laser Mosh is lime green, and carries the same coating as the Explorer special Gogos.\nIn January 2010, Gogo's Crazy Bones Mega Metropolis was re-released in the UK after an earlier trial in selected areas. A Partwork, the magazine features a new 'Mega Gogo' each week. Starting with Mosh (Gogo #1 from series 1), the Mega versions are thus far all from series 1. After that, the others have been released in a different order (1,8,3,9 etc.)\nEach Mega Gogo has a flip-top head which opens to reveal an evolution series 2 bone. The Mega Bones' heads are also removable, allowing different versions to be created once other models have been collected. Each Mega Bone comes in several colour variants, some of which do not match the original colours from the series. The Mega Bones are contained in a hexagonal 'pod'. These are connectible and also have different colours to collect. It is possible to pull these apart to make multi-colour pods.\n\nFrom January 21, 2011, Magic Box International added a new Gogo's Crazy Bones Trading Card Game. \nThis new trading game complemented the range of Gogo collectable figurines and created an exciting new way to play and collect Gogos. There were 160 cards to collect, including 32 special prismatic 'Leader' cards.\nPackets of the Gogo's Crazy Bones Trading Card Game contain 6 cards, including 1 special card and were priced at 50p.\nA Starter Pack was also available containing a Collector Album for storing the cards, a full game guide, checklist and 3 packets of cards. The Starter Pack was priced at £3.99.\nAs with all Gogo's Crazy Bones collections, an extensive marketing campaign was in place to support the launch. This included a large TV advertising campaign and product sampling via the Gogo's Crazy Bones Comic.\n\nGogo's Crazy Bones Series 1 was released in South Africa in October 2009. The collectables are available as 4 product variations:\n\nIn December 2009, the largest South African Sunday newspaper listed the toy as the top gift for boys between the ages of 6 and 8. Four months after release the sales exceeded 200,000 units.\n\nGogo’s Crazy Bones Series 2 was released on March 18, 2010. The South African distributors and licensors of the toy are Blowfish Entertainment.\n\n\nOther than the collectible nature of Crazy Bones there are multiple games that can be played with the figurines including:\n\n\nEuropean Crazy Bones, Evolution, Explorer and Superstar packets also contain stickers. These can be collected in sticker albums which are sold separately.\n\nSeries 4 Power Gogo's replace stickers with cards. There is a collector's folder with transparent sleeves for all cards.\nReleased February 2011, The trading cards also have a collector's folder, sold with a free pack of cards @ £3.99.\n\nMagic Box Int has also created various collector tins, bags (blue and green) and containers for the gogos.\n\nIn August 2009, plush toys of three types were released:\nAll plush designs are based on bones from series 1\n\nIn March 2010, the 'England dugout 2010' was released to store the England 2010 collection.\n\n\nDuring the mid 1990s, Coca-Cola released a similar brand of toys named \"Hielocos\" in Mexico, Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador, Costa Rica and \"Geloucos\" in Brazil (translated to 'Crazy Ice Cubes').\n\nSince the resurgence of the European Gogo's Crazy Bones, several similar products have entered the market;\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2144201", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2144201", "title": "Marina City", "text": "Marina City\n\nMarina City is a mixed-use residential-commercial building complex in Chicago, Illinois, United States, North America, designed by architect Bertrand Goldberg. The multi-building complex opened between 1963 and 1967 and occupies almost an entire city block on State Street on the north bank of the Chicago River on the Near North Side, directly across from the Loop. Portions of the complex were designated a Chicago Landmark in 2016.\n\nThe complex consists of two , 65-story apartment towers, opened in 1963, which include physical plant penthouses. It also includes a 10-story office building (now a hotel) opened in 1964, and a saddle-shaped auditorium building originally used as a cinema. The four buildings, access driveways, and a small plaza that originally included an ice rink are built on a raised platform next to the Chicago River. Beneath the platform, at river level, is a small marina for pleasure craft, giving the structures their name.\n\nThe Marina City complex was designed in 1959 by architect Bertrand Goldberg and constructed between 1961 and 1968 at a cost of $36 million, financed to a large extent by Building Service Employees International Union, a union of building janitors and elevator operators, who sought to reverse the pattern of white flight from the city's downtown area. When finished, the two towers were both the tallest residential buildings and the tallest reinforced concrete structures in the world. The complex was built as a \"city within a city\", featuring numerous on-site facilities including a theater, gym, swimming pool, ice rink, bowling alley, stores, restaurants, and, of course, a marina.\n\nMarina City was built in a joint venture with Brighton Construction Company (owner: Thomas J. Bowler) and James McHugh Construction Company. James McHugh Construction Co. subsequently built Water Tower Place in 1976 and Trump Tower in 2009, both of which were also the tallest reinforced concrete structures in the world at the times they were built. Marina City was the first building in the United States to be constructed with the Linden climbing tower cranes.\n\nWLS-TV (ABC Channel 7) transmitted from an antenna atop Marina City until the Willis Tower (formerly known as Sears Tower) was completed. Local radio station WCFL operated out of Marina City in the office building of the complex. Local television station WFLD (FOX Channel 32) had its studios and transmitter at Marina City for 18 years until they were bought by Metromedia.\n\nMarina City was the first post-war urban high-rise residential complex in the United States and is widely credited with beginning the residential renaissance of American inner cities. Its model of mixed residential and office uses and high-rise towers with a base of parking has become a primary model for urban development in the United States and throughout the world, and has been widely copied throughout many cities internationally.\n\nThe two towers contain identical floor plans. The bottom 19 floors form an exposed spiral parking ramp operated by valet with approximately 896 parking spaces. The 20th floor of each contains a laundry room and gym with panoramic views of the Loop, while floors 21 through 60 contain apartments (450 per tower). A 360-degree open-air roof deck lies on the 61st and top story. The buildings are accessed from separate lobbies that share a common below-grade mezzanine level as well as ground-level plaza entrances beside the House of Blues. Originally rental apartments, the complex converted to condominiums in 1977, but still contains a number of rental units.\n\nMarina City apartments are unusual in containing almost no interior right angles. On each residential floor, a circular hallway surrounds the elevator core, which is in diameter, with 16 sector-shaped units arrayed around the hallway. Apartments are composed of these units. Bathrooms and kitchens are located towards the inside of the building. Living areas occupy the outermost areas of each unit. Each unit terminates in a semi-circular balcony, separated from living areas by a floor-to-ceiling window wall. Because of this arrangement, every single living room and bedroom in Marina City has a balcony.\n\nThe apartments are also unusual in that they function solely on electricity; neither natural gas nor propane serves any function. The apartments are not provided with hot water, air conditioning, or heat from a central source, as was the common practice at the time the towers were built. Instead, each unit contains individual water heaters, heating and cooling units, and electric stoves; residents pay individually for the electricity needed to run these appliances. This might have been a financial decision on the part of the building owners; at the time these towers were constructed, local electric utility Commonwealth Edison provided expensive building transformers at little or no charge, provided the buildings were made all-electric.\n\nIn addition, the residential towers are noted for the high speed of their elevators. It takes approximately 33 seconds to travel from the lower-level lobby to the 61st floor roof decks.\n\nThe towers were awarded a prize by the New York Chapter of the American Institute of Architects in 1965 for their innovation.\n\nThe appearance of the towers is said to have inspired a similar design for the Corinthian Tower in New York.\n\nIn 2007, the condominium board controversially claimed to own the common law copyright and trademark rights to the name and image of the buildings, although they do not own the parking garage portion of the buildings located below the 20th floor. They have claimed that any commercial use (such as in film or other media, such as on web sites) of pictures of the buildings or of the name \"Marina City\" without permission is a violation of their intellectual property rights.\n\nIn celebration of the 2018 Illinois Bicentennial, Marina City was selected as one of the Illinois 200 Great Places by the American Institute of Architects Illinois component (AIA Illinois).\n\nThe complex houses the House of Blues concert hall, restaurant and bar, the Hotel Chicago, 10Pin Bowling Lounge, and four restaurants (Yolk, Smith and Wollensky, Katana, and Dick's Last Resort).\n\nThe House of Blues concert hall was built in the shell of the complex's long-disused movie theater. Similarly, the hotel was built in what was once the Marina City office building. In order to accommodate Smith and Wollensky, the former skating rink was demolished. Pedestrian and vehicular access to the residential towers and the raised common plaza were redesigned. In 2006, decorative lighting was installed around the circular roofs of the mechanical sheds that top each tower; the towers had not contained any such lighting since the 1960s.\n\n\nThe towers' appearances include: \n\n\n\n"}

An Elteber (Almış) is known to have met the famous Muslim traveller Ibn Fadlan and requested assistance from the Abbasids of Baghdad.\n\nThe earliest extant mention of the term is for a ruler of the North Caucasian Huns in the 680s, referred to in Christian sources from Caucasian Albania as \"Alp Ilutuer\". The title was also mentioned in \"Letter to Kültegin\" in 732. It was used by rulers of pre-Islamic Volga Bulgaria during the period of their vassalage to the Khazars.\n\nGolden (1980:149) noted that Rásonyi (1942:92) had glossed an \"il teber\" as \"one who steps on the \"il\" at the head of conquered tribes\"; with \"il\" descending from Proto-Turkic *\"ēl\" \"realm\" (Clauson, 1972:121; Sevortijan:1974:339) whereas \"täbär\" from Turkic root *\"täp-\" \"to kick with foot\" (or *\"tep-\" / *\"dēp-\" \"to stamp, tramp\"). Alternatively, Róna-Tas (2016:72–73) proposes an Iranian etymology; he compares the Turkic title \"(H)elteber\" to Manichean Bactrian \"l’dβr\", Written Sogdian \"δātβar\", Sogdian \"ryttpyr\" / \"dyttpyr\" (*\"litbir\"), etc. from Middle Iranian *\"lātbär\" < Old Iranian *\"dāta-bara\" \"who brings the law\", ultimately from Proto-Indo-European roots *\"dʰēH\" \"to put, place\" & \"bʰer-\" \"to bring\", respectively.\n\n\n"}

The municipality of Lapuyan is located in the southern section of the Zamboanga del Sur province. It is also often referred to as \"Little America\".\n\nLapuyan was created by separating the barrios of Lapuyan, Maruing, Kumalarang, Karpok, and Timbang, all of the municipality of Margosatubig and formed into a regular municipality by virtue of Executive Order No. 273 on October 16, 1957, by President Carlos P. Garcia upon the recommendation of Sen. Roseller T. Lim, Gov. Bienvenido Ebarle and the Provincial Board of Zamboanga del Sur. The municipality was formally inaugurated on April 21, 1958, with the induction into office of the following municipal officials: Mayor Coco I. Sia, Vice Mayor Bayang Guiaya, Councilors Dr. Vicente Imbing, Datu Manupak Dakula, Benigno Bualan, Javier Suico, Catalino Fernandez and Canuto Lingating.\n\nUpon creation into a regular municipality, the existing barrios within its jurisdiction were Poblacion, Kumalarang, Maruing, Carpok, Bulawan, Lakewood and Sayog.\n\nLapuyan covers an area of of land, located on the northern shore of Dumanquilas Bay, bounded on the east by the municipality of San Miguel, on the west by Dumanquilas Bay and the municipalities of Malangas, Buug and Kumalarang, to the north by the municipalities of Lakewood and Tigbao, and on the south by Dumanquilas Bay and the municipality of Margosatubig, all in Zamboanga del Sur.\n\nLapuyan is politically subdivided into 26 barangays.\nSubanen, English, Cebuano, Chavacano, Maguindanao, Tagalog/Filipino\n\nUpon the municipality's inauguration on April 21, 1958, the first appointed mayor was Mayor Coco Imbing Sia (nephew of Datu Lumok Imbing) and the first appointed Vice Mayor was Bayang Guiaya. The first appointed municipal councilors were Dr. Vicente Imbing, Datu Maneped Dakula, Benigno Bualan, Javier Suico, Canuto Lingating, and Catalino Fernandez. The first appointed municipal officials served for two years from 1957–1959. \n\nIn the local elections of 1959, the first elected municipal officials were Mayor Coco I. Sia, Vice Mayor Fausto H. Imbing, Councilors Felicidad M. Minor, Dr. Vicente L. Imbing, and four others; they served from 1960-1963.\n\nBelow is a list of municipal officials who served as mayors and vice mayors of the municipality of Lapuyan.\n\n\nDuring the Spanish regime, the Subanens were a thriving tribe in the hinterlands of Western Mindanao that had not been conquered by the Spanish colonists, who had their hands full waging wars with the Moros in the South. The ancestral Subanen domains were in the Pingolis and Dumangkilas areas. In the olden times, Pingolis consisted of the areas of Misamis Occidental, Zamboanga del Sur and Zamboanga del Norte. Dumangkilas consisted of Margosatubig up to the Dinas and Dimataling areas. The Spaniards came upon these places almost at the close of the 18th century but were never able to build a permanent settlement, only bayside watchtowers for any upcoming pirate attacks, in Margosatubig and Tukuran, Zamboanga del Sur, and in the shores of Misamis, now Ozamiz City.\n\nGumabongabon, a native of Cotabato, sought refuge in Mount Malindang in Misamis province to flee from the Muslim faith of Salipabunsuan (Shariff Kabunsuan). He had two sons named Dageneg and Daginding. The younger brother Daginding took over the Subanen leadership from his aging father Gumabongabon. Throughout his lifetime Gumabongabon was never conquered or subjugated either by the Muslim or Christian faith by remaining in the jungles with his family and those that continued his leadership.\n\nDaginding, the surviving son of Gumabongabon, is said to be the origin of the Imbings in Lapuyan. Daginding bore a son named Baless who took over the leadership from Daginding. Baless bore a son named Baan, then Baan begat Paluli, who also begat a son named Habali who begat Bongulan, who bore a son named Pamaisen. The latter also bore a son named Samaya, who bore a son named Lihaiwan, who bore a son named Sanira. It was at the time of the leadership of Sanira that he transferred his place to Salug Valley, now Molave town. There he met and married a wife from Dumangkilas, now Margosatubig, Zamboanga Del Sur. Sanira bore four children, triplets – two boys and one girl. The triplets were called Palaganding, Dainding, and Gumaed. The only girl was named Balao. Among the triplets, Palaganding became the leader after his father Sanira. He was the most feared Subanon leader. He ate his enemies' hearts raw after every battle.\n\nPalaganding married a girl from Pingoles and bore four sons, named Lumang, Mandaulay, Sandok and Talatap, and one daughter named Sinumpay. Son Talatap and daughter Sinumpay were kidnapped by pirates when they were fishing in Dumangkilas bay. Sinumpay was sold by the pirates to a Hadji Usah in Jolo, who married her and became a Muslim. Talatap's fate is not known.\n\nPalaganding’s eldest son Lumang took over the leadership of the Subanens when he died. Lumang bore three sons and two daughters. He named his sons Mandal, Bahong, and Imbing. He named his daughters Ames and Amog.\n\nLumang's youngest son, Imbing, took over the leadership of the Subanens during the American regime. It was during this time that his victorious battle of Mount Guillian took place against the Iranons. Mount Imbing was named by American Governor-General Leonard Wood, who happened to stay with Timuay Beng Imbing on his way to Lakewood, where he saw a lake while flying during World War I. The lake was so beautiful surrounded by trees that General Wood named it Lakewood. Today, Lakewood is already a municipality which was a former barangay of Lapuyan, Zamboanga del Sur.\n\nTimuay Labi (highest) Beng Imbing bore six children — three boys and three girls. He named his boys Calay, Lumok and Purok, all with a title of Datu. He named his girls Calat, Calangian and the last Sindium. The last Subanen Datu among the Subanens was Datu Purok Imbing. After him, there was no more anointment. The American missionaries were already in Lapuyan and the saga of the Datus and Timuays ended its cruel and happy days.\n\nIn the olden days, the Subanens did not have schools; parents were in charge of schooling them. In a family of singers, the mother or the father sang Subanen epics and poems, and read legends and stories. Mothers trained their daughters to weave abaca cloth; the father usually trained their son to do wood carvings or weave rattan baskets and to make musical instruments out of bamboo and wood.\n\nWhen they came into contact with the Muslims, they learned about the teachings of Islam. Subanens of Lapuyan had early contact with the Spaniards who built a garrison in Margosatubig during the mid-19th century; a school for the natives was opened by Spanish priests but the Subanens misunderstood the message of Christianity. They were scared to see a stick (the cross) with a dead man (Jesus) on it. The cross, which they called \"karehus\", was interpreted differently; the early Catholic missionaries were thought of as cannibals. With the coming of the Americans, Protestant missionaries brought big picture rolls showing among others, the baby Jesus and the Mother Mary. The old folks associated these stories with their own tribal beliefs of a “Diwata” or God-child, a savior of mankind. With this understanding, Subanen elders now encouraged their children to go to the mission school run by these American missionaries. In 1912, Mr. & Mrs. David O. Lund opened a mission school in Sunglupa in the village of Thimuay Imbing, now a part of the Municipality of Lapuyan. Thimuay Imbing accepted the new religion, a Protestant denomination of the Christian and Missionary Alliance whose headquarters were located in Nyac, New York, in 1914; they constructed a semi-permanent-building called the Pampang Tabernacle where the Subanen worshipped. Next to the Tetuan Church in Zamboanga City, the Lapuyan Tabernacle became the first Alliance Church in Mindanao, if not the entire Philippines. There were further changes in the way of life of the Subanen in Lapuyan with the opening of government schools in 1919.\n\nThe Subanen have now largely absorbed Western culture: notably in the way they dress and the way they build their houses, however they still have managed to preserve many of their customs and traditions.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2144220", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2144220", "title": "Pierian Spring", "text": "Pierian Spring\n\nIn Greek mythology, the Pierian Spring of Macedonia was sacred to the Muses. As the metaphorical source of knowledge of art and science, it was popularized by a couplet in Alexander Pope's poem \"An Essay on Criticism\" (1711): \"A little learning is a dang'rous thing; / Drink deep, or taste not the Pierian spring.\"\n\nThe Pierian spring is sometimes confused with the Castalian Spring.\n\nThe sacred spring was said to be near ancient Leivithra in Pieria, a region of ancient Macedonia, also the location of Mount Olympus, and believed to be the home and the seat of worship of Orpheus. The Muses \"were said to have frolicked about the Pierian springs soon after their birth\". The spring is believed to be a fountain of knowledge that inspires whoever drinks from it.\n\nThe name of the spring comes from the Pierides, the gaggle of girls (daughters of King Pierus) who sought a contest with the Muses. When they lost, they were turned into magpies. Ovid tells this tale after explaining the origin of the Heliconian spring in \"Metamorphoses\"V. The metamorphoses into magpies comes at the end of the book:\n\nThe greatest of our number ended thus her learned songs; and with concordant voice the chosen Nymphs adjudged the Deities, on Helicon who dwell, should be proclaimed the victors. But the vanquished nine began to scatter their abuse; to whom rejoined the goddess; 'Since it seems a trifling thing that you should suffer a deserved defeat, and you must add unmerited abuse to heighten your offence, and since by this appears the end of our endurance, we shall certainly proceed to punish you according to the limit of our wrath.' But these Emathian sisters laughed to scorn our threatening words; and as they tried to speak, and made great clamour, and with shameless hands made threatening gestures, suddenly stiff quills sprouted from out their finger-nails, and plumes spread over their stretched arms; and they could see the mouth of each companion growing out into a rigid beak.And thus new birds were added to the forest.While they made complaint, these Magpies that defile our groves, moving their stretched-out arms, began to float, suspended in the air. And since that time their ancient eloquence, their screaming notes, their tiresome zeal of speech have all remained.\nAn early reference to the Pierian spring is found in the \"Satyricon\" of Petronius, from the 1st century AD, at the end of section 5 \nSappho, too, refers to the roses of the Pierian spring, in her poem \"To One Who Loved Not Poetry,\" in the mid-600 B.C.\nLines 215 to 232 of read:\n\nIn Greek mythology, it was believed that drinking from the Pierian Spring would bring you great knowledge and inspiration. Thus, Pope is explaining how if you only learn a little it can \"intoxicate\" you in such a way that makes you feel as though you know a great deal. However, when \"drinking largely sobers\" you, you become aware of how little you truly know.\n\nThe opening stanza also appears in Ray Bradbury's \"Fahrenheit 451\", as Fire Captain Beatty chastizes Guy Montag, the protagonist, about reading books, which are forbidden in the society of the novel.\n\nIn his poem \"Hugh Selwyn Mauberley,\" Ezra Pound refers to Pierian \"roses\" in a critique of the cheap aesthetic of his time, which in his opinion has replaced a true appreciation of art and knowledge:\n\n\"Conduct, on the other hand, the soul\n'Which the highest cultures have nourished'\nTo Fleet St. where\nDr. Johnson flourished;\n\nBeside this thoroughfare\nThe sale of half-hose has\nLong since superseded the cultivation\nOf Pierian roses.\"\n\nSir William Jones (1746–1794) also made reference to \"the fam'd Pierian rill\" (a brook or rivulet) in his poem about the origin of chess, \"Caissa\".\n\nHenry Miller also made mention of it in his MOLOCH.\n\nIn the David Cronenberg remake of The Fly, the protagonist Seth Brundle succumbs to madness and disease as the result of a hubristic science experiment. During his descent into fanaticism in the movie's second act, he rants at the short-sightedness of his lover, proclaiming \"drink deep, or taste not the plasma spring!\". The usage is ironic; Brundle's inability to recognise the shortcomings of his knowledgeand his experimentultimately leads to his destruction.\n"}

According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nThe town's name is derived from the Cebuano term \"\"mahayag\"\" (\"ma\" = to become + \"hayag\" = bright) which means to become bright or sunny. When the Visayan migrants first trickled into the area after World War II, the place was heavily forested, which, to some looks dark and forbidding. Local historical sources had it that when a large \"\"Dao\"\" tree which stands in the townsite was felt, the place becomes bright, hence the expression \"\"mahayag\"\".\n\nMahayag used to be the sitio of the barangay Molave in the municipality of Aurora. Early settlers of the area had endeavored for the creation of another municipality to fast-track development which is possible only by having a distinct political subdivision from the municipality of Molave. The town site for the new municipality was donated by Zacarias dela Torre and Pedro Alquizar.\n\nThe municipality of Mahayag was officially created on March 9, 1960, pursuant to Executive Order No. 393 by President Carlos P. Garcia, with Saturnino Mendoza as its first appointed and subsequently elected Municipal Mayor. It was formed by the separation of 20 barrios from the municipality of Molave and 3 barrios from the municipality of Dumingag.\n\nMahayag is politically subdivided into 29 barangays.\n\n2013-2016 Municipal officials:\n\nLorna Saycon Espina, the incumbent Municipal mayor, is the 9th Municipal Mayor of the Municipality of Mahayag. Past mayors include Paulino P. Fanilag, Carlito A. Lumacang as OIC-Mayor following the EDSA I Revolution, and Perpetuo C. Apale, the appointed Officer-in-Charge in the Office of the Municipal Mayor during the first election after the ratification of the 1987 Constitution.\n\nThe town of Mahayag has a high eco-tourism potential, particularly, the cold springs in Barangay Tuburan, the cave system in Barangay Kaangayan, and the Salug River that traverses the Municipality.\n\nAlthough the municipality has good eco-tourism potential, to date, only the cold springs in Barangay Tuburan have been developed as evidenced by the three private resorts in the area. This is the only tourist destination in Mahayag as of this time.\n\nGovernment investment to promote and to develop eco-tourism remains to be desired. The cave system in Barangay Kaangayan, for example, due to its proximity to the national highway, can be developed to promote spelunking activities. On the one hand, studies can be undertaken on the feasibility of promoting whitewater rafting in the rapids of Salug River.\n\nIn addition to the daycare centers in each barangay, at least one (1) public elementary school exists in each of the 29 barangays in the municipality.\n\nThere are six (6) public high schools and one private high school run by the Catholic Church in the municipality.\n\nAlthough permitted to operate and offer Collegiate courses since the later part of the 1990s, no tertiary courses had been offered by the Santa Maria Goretti Diocesan School except during the time when it served as an extension campus of the Saint Columban College, Pagadian City.\n\nCollege students who cannot afford to obtain their education from far places like Ozamiz or Pagadian, may still enroll post secondary classes or TESDA accredited short-term courses at the Pagadian Institute of Technology (PIT) campus in Mahayag, and college degrees like Bachelor in Secondary Education (BSED), Bachelor in Elementary Education (BEED) and Associate in Information Technology (AIT) at Josefina H. Cerilles State College- Mahayag External Studies Unit.\n\n"}
{"id": "2144224", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2144224", "title": "Château de Valençay", "text": "Château de Valençay\n\nChâteau de Valençay was a residence of the d'Estampes and Talleyrand-Périgord families in the commune of Valençay, in the Indre \"département\" of France. Although it is part of the province of Berry, its architecture invites comparison with the Renaissance châteaux of the Loire Valley, notably the Château de Chambord. The manor was praised as \"one of the most beautiful on earth\" by George Sand, who also noted that \"no king has owned a more picturesque park\". It is at an elevation of 135 m.\n\nChâteau de Valençay is located at the edge of a plateau overlooking the Nahon river. In ancient times, the site of the château was home to a Gallo-Roman villa called \"Valencia us\", the domain of Valans. By the 10th or 11th century, a \"heavy and massive tower\" had been built, and between 1026 and 1047 a donation charter deeded Valençay to its first recorded lord, Bertrand. In 1220, the then-lord of Valençay, Gauthier, was reported to have built a feudal castle or house on the site, but it is unclear if this was an addition or an extension to the earlier tower. There are remains of the original structure buried under the courtyard.\n\nThe modern château was built on a royal scale by the d'Estampes family of financiers over a period of some 200 years. Construction started in 1540 at the behest of Jacques d'Estampes in place of the demolished 12th-century castle and was not completed until the 18th century, when the south tower was added.\n\nThe 18th century saw a rapid succession of owners, including the notorious Scottish banker John Law, who purchased the estate in 1719. Nearly a century later, in 1803, Napoleon ordered his foreign minister Charles Maurice de Talleyrand to acquire the property as a place particularly appropriate for reception of foreign dignitaries, notably Ferdinand VII of Spain, his brother Infante Carlos, Count of Molina and his uncle Infante Antonio Pascual, who would spend six years in Napoleonic captivity at Valençay. The treaty providing for their release in 1813 took the estate's name.\n\nThe period of Talleyrand's occupancy was the golden age in the history of Valençay, with twenty-three communes reportedly administrated by the ruling prince. Undoubtedly the most celebrated of Talleyrand's servants employed at Valençay was his chef, Marie-Antoine Carême. After Talleyrand's death in 1838, the great statesman was buried in a small mortuary chapel in the park. His collateral descendants retained the ownership of the estate until 1952, when the male line ended. The last prince bequeathed the property to his stepson, who sold it to an association of historic chateaux in 1979.\n\nThe Princes of Talleyrand-Périgord ranked among the mediatized German nobility, by virtue of their nominal control of the duchy of Sagan in Prussian Silesia (now in Poland). On this technicality, the château was spared the German occupation during the Second World War. Having established his personal neutrality, the Duke of Sagan saw treasures from the Louvre (like the \"Winged Victory of Samothrace\" and the \"Venus de Milo\") safely sheltered at Valençay.\n\nRelics of the 16th century include an outsized round tower at the western corner, capped by a dome \"à l'impériale\", and the central block in the shape of a donjon, with a slender tower on each corner, grouped around the raking roof. Its feigned battlements are evocative of the Middle Ages, a retrospective formula stylistically derived from Chambord but somewhat vitiated by ample fenestration, including characteristic Renaissance dormers.\n\nThe exterior has withstood time and the elements remarkably well. It is clothed in classical orders: the Doric order on the ground floor, the Ionic order on the first floor, and the Corinthian order on the second. This was an innovative feature anticipating French classicism. An arcaded gallery rings the courtyard. The western wing with its Mansard roof dates from the 17th century.\n\nTalleyrand's château boasts one of the most advanced interiors of the Empire style anywhere. There are a hundred rooms, of which a quarter comprise Talleyrand's apartments. A room of King Ferdinand is also shown to tourists. The western wing contains the Talleyrand Museum, formerly housed in outbuildings.\n\nThe formal French gardens, dating from the early 20th century, cover about forty hectares, not counting the area of Talleyrand's vineyards. Llamas, peacocks, and other exotic animals kept in the park provide amusement for tourists.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2144227", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2144227", "title": "Bayog, Zamboanga del Sur", "text": "Bayog, Zamboanga del Sur\n\n', officially the ', is a in the province of , . According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nIn 1953, large numbers of immigrants started settling permanently in this area which was then sparsely populated by the native Subanen. Barrio Bayog came into existence under the Municipality of Malangas. Bayog was adopted as the name of the barrio, as this place was known to the natives due to the abundance of the “Bayog” (pterospermum diversifolium) trees in the area.\n\nOpportunities in agriculture, business and employment attracted more settlers into the area, particularly during the year 1957 and 1958. The influx of settlers was given more impetus when the Samar Mining Company (SAMICO) constructed the existing SAMICO road from Bobuan to its wharf in Pamintayan. By 1959, Bayog was already quite big for a barrio. So another barrio was created which is now the present barangay Kahayagan. When the municipality of Buug (also a former barrio of Malangas) was created in 1960, barangay Bayog and Kahayagan were among the barrios under it.\n\nAs early as 1963, three years after the SAMICO road was completed and the company was in full-blast operation, the population of Bayog already warranted the creation of a new municipality. Thus, on November 14, 1964, Bayog started to function as a corporate municipality separate and distinct from the Municipality of Buug by virtue of Executive Order No. 112 issued by the then President Diosdado Macapagal. However, on February 15, 1966, the infant municipality was dissolved and reverted into its former status as one of the barangays of the Municipality of Buug by virtue of a Supreme Court decision in the case of Pelaez vs. Auditor General. The then Senator Pealez contented that the creation of a new municipality through an executive Order was against the law as the same was a prerogative of Congress.\n\nIn time, the town re-applied as a candidate for municipality. The Municipality of Bayog became the 29th municipality of the Province of Zamboanga del Sur on May 8, 1967, by virtue of Republic Act No. 4872, authorized by then Congressman Vincenso Sagun. The new municipality was formed out of twenty barrios of the Municipality of Buug (at that time still Province of Zamboanga del Sur): Bayog (which became the poblacion), Bobuan, Datagan, Pulangbato, Dipili, Salawagan, Lamari, Damit, Depasi, Pangi (now San Isidro), Liba, Datagan I, Datagan II, Mataga, Dimalinao, Baking, Dipuri, Kwai, Maton-og and Kanipa-an. During the later part of the year, barangays Supon, Canoayan, Dagum, Camp Blessing, Conakon, Matin-ao, Balukbahan, Sigacad, Deporehan, Bantal and Balunbunan were created by virtue of a Provincial Board Resolution. To date, the Municipality has twenty-eight (28) barangays within its juridical boundaries.\n\nThe town is bounded on the north by Godod, Bacungan, Sindangan, and Siayan; on the east by Lakewood; on the south by Kumalarang, Buug, and Diplahan; and on the west by Kabasalan. It is the westernmost town in the province.\n\nThe town is partly situated in the Sibougey Valley watered by the Sibuguey River, Dipili River, and Depore River. 75% of the land lies on rugged terrain with elevation up to .\n\nBayog is subdivided into 28 barangays.\n\nBayog has one of the most bustling economies in the province, since it is one of the top revenue-producing municipalities in Zamboanga del Sur, with an annual income of over 25,000,000 which come mainly from mining, business establishments, and quarrying.\n\nAs of now, there is one financial institution which operates in the town and numerous cooperatives which also contribute to the town's overall income. Two pawnshops have also started operations in the town - the Mlhuiller Pawnshop and the Bayog Pawnshop.\n\nSince Bayog is mainly agricultural, over 20 rice and corn mills can be found in the municipality. In addition, their products are also traded with neighbouring cities such as Zamboanga City and Pagadian City, which is why Bayog has also been considered as th \"Rice Granary Of Region IX\". The people of the town rely mainly on crop raising and animal husbandry. The town is situated in a wide plain fed by the Siboguey River and its tributaries. Two dams can be found in the municipality, namely, the Sibouguey Irrigation Dam and the Dipili River Irrigation Dam, which are responsible for irrigating some 100 square kilometres of ricefields. This dams were erected during the late 1970s with support from the Philippine-Australian Development Project. The dams are now under the management of the National Irrigation Administration through their office in the town center.\n\nBayog has also been cited as the Livestock Center of the region because of the Western Mindanao Livestock Development Center in Barangay Kahayagan, which is responsible for the improvement of livestock products in Zamboanga Peninsula through right breedings.\n\nThe people have also been engaged in logging due to the vast forest which were found in the area. In the past, Bayog was also referred as the Timbermines Country.\n\nMining is a major industry in Bayog. Gold is concentrated in Barangay Depore while copper, lead and steel are mined in Barangay Bubuan and Barangay Liba. Several companies have already started their explorations here, i.e. Toronto Ventures Incorporated (TVI), Cebu Ore Mining Inc, Miki Trio Ore Mining Inc., and some small scale miners which have their own organization, the Monte de Oro Small Scale Mining Association (MOSSMA).\n\nThe new Public Market Building has 180 stalls occupied by different business groups. The Fish and Meat section has 40 stalls, fruit stand & old carenderia has 15 stalls, Dry Goods section 15 stalls, and new Carenderia building with 7 stalls. As of now there were already 6 stalls in the newly constructed night market. A new phase of the Public Market is under construction and will add new 25 stalls.\n\nBayog has a gymnasium with a seating capacity of 4500, considered as one of the largest in the province. Three other gymnasiums in the town are also used in handling large crowds, the Kahayagan Gymnasium, BCES Gymnasium and the BNHS Gymnasium. There are also four tennis courts ( BALTEC, NIA, Kahayagan Sports Complex, WESMILDEC), maintained by the Bayog Lawn Tennis Club. Another local facility is the Bayog Municipal Plaza.\n\n\nEvery summer, the town was always been the venue of different religious gatherings, including the Regional Youth Camp which is hosted by the Liberty Bible Baptist Church and draws approximately 600 youths from all over the region and several participants from Cebu, Lanao del Norte, and Misamis Occidental. Another is the GAYEM, hosted by the Seventh-Day Adventist Church and held participants from the Provinces of Zamboanga del Sur and Zamboanga Sibugay.\n\nFestival dates in Bayog include the following:\n\n\nThe total road network of the municipality is , of which are concrete, are gravel and are dirt roads.\n\nMunicipal records show that there are 134 registered tricycles/Habal-Habal as of December 2005. There are 50 privately owned vehicles in the municipality. There are also passenger buses and jeepneys plying Bayog to Buug, Bayog-Pagadian routes. To date, there are two buses plying Bayog-Zamboanga Route.\n\nOut of the twenty eight barangays, only two barangays are not accessible by vehicles due to the very poor conditions of their farm to market roads. Residents utilized horses or carabaos to transport their farm products up to the point where transportation is accessible.\n\nThe municipality of Bayog has nine (9) Tulay ng Pangulo projects constructed at Barangays Dipili, Depase, Balunbunan, Depase, Canoayan, Lamare, Bobuan, Depore and Poblacion.\n\n\n\nThe municipal compound is located in the heart of the town. The charred municipal building is in the center, looking over Bayog Municipal Plaza, which featured a Children's Park; a twin fountain which has the town's map drawn on it; a flower field, a priority project of the recent administration; a statue of the National Hero; the famous 30 flagpoles, and the Bayog Trees, which is believed to be the burial site of a Subanen Datu which was considered as the first town's settler.\n\nOn its right side, resides the Philippine National Police Headquarters, the Bayog Lawn Tennis Association Court, the Municipal Canteen, the Municipal Motorpool, the SIVAFA Midwife Clinic, and the AFUZS Headquarters.\n\nWhile on its left sides, stand the ABC Multi-purpose Building, the DILG Office, a session hall, the Bayog Municipal Health Center, and the 3500-seater Municipal Gymnasium.\n\nAlong the side of the Municipal Hall, there you can find the Senior Citizen House, the post office, the Office of the Agriculturist, the Department of Transportation and Communication, the Department of Environment and Natural Resources, Department of Social Welfare and Development, the Municipal Day Care Center, the Newly constructed E-Center and the Municipal Swimming Pool.\n\nAt its back is the Municipal Nursery, and the Municipal Guest House.\n\nThe town has a college, the Josefina H. Cerilles State College which caters the educational needs of the entire populace and of the neighboring towns. It offers cheap education to the townfolks. It has replaced the External Studies Unit of Western Mindanao State University, which for seven years have served the municipality of Bayog and provided the Bayoganos access to higher learning. Bayog has also four secondary schools, of which Bayog National High School is the most prominent. There are 33 elementary schools in this town, of which one is a private institution, the Siboguey SDA Elementary School owned by the Seventh-day Adventist Church. All of the public schools here are networked through an office situated at the Central School.\n\n\n"}

According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nThe Subanens were believed to be the first people to have settled in this land, right near the swift flowing river that now traverse the Margosatubig Pilot School and Guiwan district. “Malagus Tubig” was the original name of the town, which was taken after the swift river current that kept changing its course towards the mouth of the Dumanquilas Bay. In the 15th century, the Spaniards arrived and found that its bay is a natural refuge from bad weather for their ships. Soon it became their choice settlement changing Malagus Tubig to its present name Margosatubig. They built a huge stone fort on top of a hill that served as their bastion against Moro pirates who used to raid the settlements along the Dumanquillas Bay and its vicinity. The fort was known as Cotta Heights. In 1963, it was demolished and is now the site of Pax High School. The Spaniards reigned for years and left as their heritage most evidently, the Chavacano dialect. Suffice it to say that more than a hundred years ago, Margosatubig already existed as a settlement of migrants and natives in the 19th century.\n\nFrom 1917 to 1936, Margosatubig stayed as a municipal district of the city of Zamboanga. During the Commonwealth Government and by virtue Executive Order No. 17 dated December 23, 1936 signed by President Manuel L. Quezon, Margosatubig finally became a regular and distinct municipality with eight original barrios. It can be said that Margosatubig is the oldest town in Zamboanga del Sur; older even than the undivided Province of Zamboanga.\n\nIn 1950, the barrios of Punta Flecha, Pitogo, Qugbay, Balong-balong, Libertad and Dumanguilas were transferred to the newly created town of Dimataling\n\nIn 1951, the barrios of Malangas, La Dicha, Diplo, Gusem, Buug, Matinaw, Gaulan, Tinungtungan, Manangon, Lindang, Luop, Silupa, Minsulao, Paruk, Lubing, Balabao, Mali, Baluran, Sampuli and Bacao, all from Margosatubig were separated to form the town of Malangas.\n\nMargosatubig, in spite of being a pioneer town, still remained isolated and reachable only by sea craft. In 1976, it was finally opened to the rest of Zamboanga del Sur by an asphalt road connecting it to Pagadian. This was facilitated by the Zamboanga del Sur Development Project undertaken by the Philippine-Australian Development Assistance Programme (PADAP), and its Electrification by ZAMSURECO-1 followed in 1979.\n\nMargosatubig is politically subdivided into 17 barangays.\n\n"}

Its economy is focused on agricultural production, and of fertile land is irrigated and planted with rice. Corn, coconut, cassava, banana, camote and various vegetables are also grown. These are marketed to neighboring towns and cities, and reach Cebu. Due to its strategic location, Molave is becoming the commercial hub of the Salug Valley.\n\nMolave originated during the 1930s as a small settlement in a marshy jungle, originally known as Salug. The Subanons were early settlers of the area; the fertile land of the Salug Valley later attracted settlers from throughout the Philippines, making the area ethnically diverse. On June 16, 1948, the settlement was separated from the municipality of Aurora as a separate municipality and designated the new capital of the province of Zamboanga. Molave was the provincial capital until Zamboanga was divided into the provinces of Zamboanga del Norte and Zamboanga del Sur; it became part of Zamboanga del Sur, with the town of Pagadian as its capital.\n\nMolave is in the northeastern part of the province of Zamboanga del Sur, at the foot of a hill, and is bounded by the Salug River and mountains which protect it from typhoons. It is bordered by the municipalities of Tambulig in the east, Mahayag in the west, Josefina and Province of Zamboanga del Norte in the north, and Ramon Magsaysay in the south. Molave is about from Pagadian, the provincial capital, and from Ozamiz. It is above sea level.\n\nMolave is divided into two topographical areas. The east and southwest lowlands, which cover 30 percent of its total land area, consist of nine barangays and are generally flat, swampy and marshy. The upland, which covers 70 percent of Molave's total area, is hilly and mostly deforested. The terrain is moderately sloping to rolling, with the overall grade varying from 10 percent in the lowlands to 27 percent in the mountains.\n\nThe municipality has two types of soil. The lowlands and part of the upper barangays are composed of San Miguel silt loam, and is well-suited for cultivation. Adtoyon clay loam is found in the upland areas, and can be used for grazing and a variety of crops such as corn, cassava, and camote.\n\nMolave is the fourth type on the PAGASA climatology map, with rainfall evenly distributed throughout the year. Its average temperature is .\n\nMolave is divided into 25 barangays:\nThe Subanon people were early inhabitants of the area. Molave originated during the early 1930s as a small settlement in a marshy jungle which was known originally as Salug. The fertile soil of the Salug Valley attracted settlers from Luzon, Visayas and Mindanao, making the area's population a diverse mix of Cebuano, Boholano, Ilongo, Tagalog, Ilocano, Leyteño, Misamisnon, Surigaonon, and Muslim and other ethnic groups. A number of Chinese and Filipino businessmen settled in the region before World War II.\n\nThe population influx enabled the settlement's rapid development. Molave became a municipality with Republic Act No. 286, authored by Congressman Juan S. Alano, on June 16, 1948. It was separated from the municipality of Aurora, established as a separate municipality, and designated the capital of the province of Zamboanga del Sur with the act. Molave was the provincial capital until Zamboanga's division in 1951 into the provinces of Zamboanga del Norte and Zamboanga del Sur. It became part of Zamboanga del Sur, with Pagadian as its capital. \n\nPelagio Blancia was appointed Molave's first mayor. Blancia was defeated in the 1951 elections, and Mayor Javier Ariosa moved the seat of government from Camp 7 (present-day Barangay Blancia) to its present site. Ireneo Glepa, the current mayor, was Molave's youngest and longest-serving vice mayor. Unopposed for two terms as vice-mayor, Glepa was elected mayor in May 2010.\n\n\nMolave is the commercial hub of the Salug Valley. Rice trading, milling and farming are major agricultural industries, and glass and aluminum are major non-agricultural industries. Molave's economy is focused on agricultural production; 91.85 percent of its total land area is devoted to agriculture, and are irrigated and planted with rice. Corn, coconut, cassava, bananas, camote, and other vegetables are also grown. They are marketed to neighboring towns and cities as far as Cebu. Molave has 23 farmer cooperatives (19 of which are registered), with a total membership of 7,566.\n\nMolave has ten barangay health stations, one maternity clinic, 26 health and nutrition posts, and a municipal health center staffed by one rural-health physician, one dentist, one sanitary inspector, three nurses and 11 midwives. It has three private hospitals (Lumapas Hospital, Salug Valley Medical Center and Blancia Hospital), five private clinics, ten pharmacies, and two funeral chapels.\n\nSports facilities include a municipal gymnasium, three tennis courts, four basketball courts, three volleyball courts and the Molave Regional Pilot School sports complex.

Buchanan. \n\nLong performed in a number of Broadway shows, including \"Porgy and Bess\" (as Sportin' Life in the 1942 revival), and \"Beggar's Holiday\" (1946). Long and Lena Horne co-introduced the Harold Arlen–Ted Koehler composition \"As Long As I Live\" in \"Cotton Club Parade\" (1934) when Horne was only 16 years old.\n\nHe reprised his role of Sportin' Life in the 1951 Columbia recording of \"Porgy and Bess\", the most complete recording of the opera issued up to that time. He also appeared with Thelma Carpenter in the 1952 revival of \"Shuffle Along\", which was recorded by RCA Victor.\n\nLong received a Tony Award nomination for Best Supporting or Featured Actor (Musical) in 1973, for the role of Dave in \"Don't Play Us Cheap\". The all-black play opened at the Ethel Barrymore Theater in New York on May 16, 1972 and ran for 164 performances. Long, along with Thomas Anderson, Joshie Armstead, Robert Dunn, Jay Van Leer, Esther Rolle, Mabel King, George Ooppee McCurn, Frank Carey, Nate Barnett, and Rhetta Hughes, recreated their stage roles in a film production by Melvin Van Peebles, in 1973.\n\nLong originated the role of John in \"Bubbling Brown Sugar\" on Broadway, which opened at the August Wilson Theatre (then-ANTA Playhouse) on March 2, 1976, and closed on December 31, 1977, after 766 performances.\n\nLong also appeared in a number of films and television shows. He played the elderly Chicken George Moore in \"\" miniseries, and had small roles in \"Trading Places\" (1983) – memorable as Ezra, the servant to whom Ralph Bellamy gives a miserably small Christmas bonus (\"maybe I'll go to the movies – by myself\"), \"The Sting\" (1973) (\"Flat rate!\"), and \"Harry and Tonto\" (1974).

It is located on Washington Street, across from City Hall.\n\nCastle Point is the highest point in Hoboken. The name is a corruption of \"Castille Point\", due to its supposed resemblance to the Castilian coast in Spain. To early navigators, the high serpentine crag jutting over the river reminded them of a miniature Rock of Gibraltar (although the Rock of Gibraltar is actually in Andalusia, not Castile which has no coast). The land was bought at public auction in 1804 by Col. John Stevens, who built his estate there. After his death, his son Edwin Augustus Stevens took responsibility of the estate and in 1853 built a 40-room mansion, the \"Stevens Castle\", on land adjacent to the point. It was acquired by Stevens Institute of Technology in 1910 and served as an administrative and residential building until 1959. Castle Point is still part of the Stevens campus. It overlooks Sybil's Cave.\n\nCastle Point also includes the surrounding area and streets such as the yellow brick Castle Point Terrace. Castle Point Park and Castle Point Skate Park are at the base of Castle Point, next to the Hudson River.\n\nThe Clam Broth House (1899–2004), was a landmark Hoboken restaurant that operated for over a century.\n\nThe Clam Broth House opened in 1899. The restaurant attracted attention with several giant hand-shaped signs. There were two giant hand-shaped signs, one hanging on the outside of the Clam Broth House that pointed downward towards the entrance, and one on a neighboring building (which is the only sign still there today). In addition, there was a third, smaller hand-shaped sign.\n\nIn 2004, the Clam Broth House building was condemned by city officials because of structural failures caused by construction workers, and destroyed. There were cracks and bulges in the building's facade prior to the building's destruction, and the facade also buckled in May 2003, causing it to be shut down. \n\nThe Clam Broth House reopened in 2010, but was bought in 2012 by another restaurant, Biggie's Clam Bar.\n\nIn Edwin A. Stevens Hall on 5th Street opposite Stevens Park.\n\nAt Church Square Park, the Hoboken Public Library contains a collection of historical photos and publications related to the history and culture of Hoboken. Erected with funds from philanthropist Martha Bayard Stevens in 1896.\n\nThe Hoboken Historical Museum was founded in 1986 and moved into its current location at 1301 Hudson St. in 2001. It presents displays on the city's history as well as exhibits of local artists' work. Its current location was once the W. & A. Fletcher Company machine shop, a hub of the city's 19th century shipbuilding and repair industry.\n\nThe Hoboken Projects are a complex of low-income apartments on the western side of Hoboken, built in 1952.\nThough the Hudson-Bergen Light Rail has created a station near the Projects to connect it with other parts of Hudson County, residents are prevented direct access from the projects and must walk one block south and then again one block north to gain access.\n\nHoboken Terminal, also known as Lackawanna Station (named for the Native American tribe that formerly made the area their dwelling), at the city's southeast corner, is a major transportation hub and a national historic landmark was built in 1908.\n\nThe Hudson River Waterfront Walkway is a promenade along the Hudson River.\n\nThe Hudson Tea Building apartment complex (1500 Washington and 1500 Hudson Streets) is the site of a former Lipton Tea plant. The part of the Hudson River Waterfront Walkway which opened in 2004 forms a \"C\" shape around the west, north and east sides of buildings at the Hudson Weehawken Cove. Although places are farther north and east than the northeastern most point in Hoboken is found here. It is the home of former New Jersey Governor Jon Corzine, New York Giants quarterback Eli Manning and was used as a residence by actress Mischa Barton when she filmed the 2009 film \"Assassination of a High School President\" in nearby Bayonne. In 2016 Hudson Tea opened a seris of new buildings, designed by DeWitt Tishman Architects with interiors by Andres Escobar (designer).\n\nOn July 29, 2005, a claim was made that a miniature statue of Jesus opened one of its eyes on its own. Before July 29, its eyes were shut. The statue is a part of a shrine at the corner of Jackson Street and Third Street that is taken care of by Julio Dones, a partially blind man who says he noticed one of its eyes was open while he was cleaning it. He claims that it is a miracle, while others believe it was a hoax. Some believe that there were already eyes in the statue, and that eyelids were glued on and one of them fell off. Regardless of how it happened, the incident gained publicity quickly. On July 29, 2005 two local news stations, ABC and UPN, came to the shrine to report it live and interview people. It has since been called \"The Miracle Statue\".\n\nIn the early 1980s after his family bought the uptown Hoboken building, Steve Fallon began booking bands into what had been the ground floor tavern's back dining room. Bands like R.E.M., Sonic Youth, Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band, My Chemical Romance, Fugazi, They Might Be Giants and Nirvana have all played Maxwell's. Except for a small break in the 1990s, Maxwell's was a vital a part of the indie music until it closed.\n\nMarineview Plaza is a building complex made up of two 25-story buildings, built in Brutalist style. The Marineview buildings are the tallest buildings in Hoboken, New Jersey. Marineview Plaza One is the northernmost and Marineview Plaza Two is the southernmost. Both buildings are residential, and are bordered on the west by Hudson Street, on the north by 4th Street, on the east by River Street and on the south by 3rd Street. In 2001 many floors' views of the New York skyline were blocked by the 333 River Street complex. Even so, they are still visible from Manhattan. \n\nAs well as having two 25-story buildings, the Marineview Plaza complex also has three smaller buildings, one of which (Marineview Plaza five) once housed Hoboken's only movie theater, which has since closed and been replaced by a bank.\n\nThe university is situated overlooking the Hudson.\nSybil's Cave is a cave with a natural water spring, that is now buried at the bottom of the Stevens Institute of Technology hill, near the Castle Point Skate Park on Frank Sinatra Drive. One of Hoboken's best known landmarks, it was first excavated around 1832 by Hoboken's founder, Col. John Stevens III, and adorned with a gothic-style stone arch. Named after the ancient Greco-Roman prophetesses, it was originally Hoboken's biggest tourist attraction, for the magnesium-laced water that flows from the spring.\n\nThe cave gained national attention in 1841 when the body of a young cigar shop worker, Mary Cecilia Rogers, washed ashore nearby, an incident that inspired Edgar Allan Poe's \"The Mystery of Marie Rogêt\", one of the first true-crime detective novels. From the mid-to-late-1800s, thousands of glasses were sold daily for a penny each to tourists from New York, who drank the cave's water in the belief that it had therapeutic properties. The cave was closed in 1880 due to health department concerns about water quality, and it was used as a cool storage locker for a nearby eating establishment. That establishment devolved into a seedy waterfront tavern and closed in the 1930s, when the cave was filled in with concrete and dirt.\n\nAround the time of World War I the cave fell into disuse and was sealed. It was reopened in October 2008 after former Mayor David Roberts worked with the Hoboken Historical Museum, Hoboken Brownstone company and others on a $106,752 renovation project to unblock the cave and make it accessible to the public.\n\nToday, although the exterior gate to the park is usually open 24 hours a day, the gate to the cave itself is locked, as its water was found to contain too many impurities to be drinkable, and the interior is rocky and slippery. As of December 2018, there are no plans to reopen it.\n\nWeehawken Cove is a small cove that extends westward from the Hudson River. The cove straddles the boundary between Hoboken to the south and Weehawken to the north. Explorer Henry Hudson anchored his ship there on October 2, 1609. His first mate noted that Castle Point looked as if it contained silver mines.\n\nListed on the National Register of Historic Places, the United Synagogue of Hoboken is among the oldest synagogue buildings in New Jersey.\n\nCastle Point Park is a public park consisting of a walkway along the Hudson River, offering scenic views of Manhattan. Stretching north along the river from Frank Sinatra Park, it terminates near 10th Street, with Sinatra Drive following along its length. Castle Point Park runs past the bottom of Castle Point, home to the Stevens Institute of Technology. Historic Sybil's Cave is also visible from the park.\n\nWithin the park is the Castle Point Skate Park, Hoboken's only designated skateboarding area. It features many ramps: one small half-pipe, one large half-pipe, one quarter pipe, and one 45° ramp, as well as several smaller ramps.\n\nRenovation began in 2012 for Church Square Park after much community input as part of a citywide park improvement plan. New play equipment. A parents group is replacing out date equipment and soft surfacing added, fully updated bathrooms, the basketball courts are being resurfaced, fenced, and lighted. The dog park run is being resurfaced and re-fenced.\n\nChurch Square Park is bordered on the west by Willow Avenue, the east by Garden Street, the north by 5th Street and the south by 4th Street. Park Avenue is blocked by the park. Church Square park is surrounded by landmarks, such as the OLG church, the Hoboken Public Library on the north side, the Demarest School Building on the east, and nearby Hoboken University Medical Center.\n\nIn the eastern part of the park is a statue of the radio pioneer Guglielmo Marconi, with a bas-relief tribute to the Four Chaplains. The statue was commissioned and donated by John Minervini to replaced the Italian 1939 World's Fair Marconi statue Mr. Minervini received from the Italian government. That original statue was damaged in transit when a rigging strap broke. Mr. Minervini added the four chaplains at the request of Mayor John Grogan. These details we're told by John Minervini to his stepson Joseph L. Giovannoli, who provided this edit.\n\nThe Firemen's Monument, Hoboken is a statue of a fireman, in the western part of the park.\n\nThere is a gazebo in the center of the park, it used to be a fountain, where weekly outdoor concerts are held in the summer and fall. The playground and swings are slightly southeast of the gazebo, and there are also 4 fields (formerly 6), a dog run, and many bushes. \"No ball playing\" signs have been put up in the fields.\n\nIn 1994, the wooden playground that had been in place for a long time was destroyed and replaced with a safer playground.\n\nIn 2005, a memorial grove, containing trees dedicated to a fire victim, was relocated to a less attractive part of the park to make way for a toddler playground, despite public opposition. Questions were raised about the toddler playground's necessity, and those opposed to the project argued that there was no need for it since there were already 3 playgrounds within Church Square Park. They also argued that the new toddler playground was an eyesore and had replaced too much open space (at the time, 6 major fields were reduced to 5). In March 2005, the oldest tree in Church Square Park was removed to make way for playground. Despite controversy, it was finished in April, 2005.\n\nColumbus Park is a park near Hoboken High School at the corner of 9th Street and Clinton Street originally designed by Charles N. Lowrie, who was landscape architect for the Hudson County Parks Department. There is a statue of Christopher Columbus in the center of the park. There is also a memorial dedicated to John A. Sacci, a beloved Hoboken High School History teacher, who was tragically shot on February 12, 1998. The monument was facilitated by students and to this day, the word \"remembrance\" is misspelled on the marble monument.\n\nThere was once a one-of-a-kind playground, tall as a three-story building with unusual equipment. It was destroyed in October 2002 to make way for a more normal, packaged (and safer) playground, in the name of Deborah Lynn Williams, a woman who was killed in the World Trade Center in the September 11 Terrorist Attacks. Because of the new playground's memorial status, the original playground will probably never be re-built. The original playground was made up of 3 sections: the first section contained a complex of chains for climbing, 3 platforms, and a very tall slide made of plastic (probably the tallest in Hoboken), which curved and could be seen over 6 blocks away. The second section was a large castle-like structure with a slide, two entrances and a pole for sliding. The third section was a series of unusual and unique space-like metal domes, which kids could crawl through and create echos. There was also a fourth section including a fountain where children would play. No photos are known to exist of the original playground.\n\nHoboken Island is a planned park in Hoboken, New Jersey, connected by a bridge to Pier A's gazebo, honoring the September 11, 2001 victims. The park was among many designs submitted to create a Hoboken 9/11 memorial. The \"Hoboken Island\" concept by the FLOW group was chosen in September 2004. When the park is constructed, a beam of light is planned to be in the center. There are 57 victims recognized in the project. Currently, there is a temporary memorial already on Pier A, in the form of a tear drop.\n\nFrank Sinatra Park is a park near Pier A, offering views of Manhattan. Built in 1998, it honors Frank Sinatra, who was born in Hoboken. Sinatra Park is shaped in a Roman amphitheater style with an area that faces the former site of the World Trade Center. The Hoboken Division of Cultural Affairs regularly produces events at the park such as their Thursday concerts featuring a variety of New Jersey-based and regional musical acts and \"Shakespeare Mondays\" present by the Hudson Shakespeare Company. Other attractions include a soccer field.\n\nOn August 24, 2004, CNN broadcast live episodes of \"Inside Politics\" and \"Crossfire\" from the park.\n\nGateway Park is an official yet secluded park that was created in 2000 to help make the neighborhood more scenic. In 2002 Troop 146 cleaned up Gateway Park for Earth Day and also cleaned up nearby Jackson Street. The park itself has trees, grass, and a bird feeder. There is an official sign at the park that says \"Your Park\", although it does not say \"Gateway Park\" yet. The park, triangle-shaped and about the size of a gas station, is Hoboken's smallest park.\n\nGateway Park is on the southwest corner of Hoboken, bordered to the south by the train tracks that separate Hoboken from Jersey City. To the east is an abandoned building (the Windsor Wax Company). The park also borders Newark Street and is at the intersection of Newark Street and Jackson Street. On two of the three sides the park is lined with pine trees.\n\nJackson Street Park is a park on Jackson Street near 1st Street.\n\nJackson Street Park is a young children's play park built within the shell of a historic building surrounded on three sides by buildings and open to the sky.\n\nIt was fully renovated in the mid-2012 with new play equipment, soft surfacing. a water spray for summer use and a rock climbing wall.\n\nMadison Park (also called Madison Street Park) is at the corner of 3rd Street and Madison Street. There's a large abstract painting on the building that faces it. The original playground since the park's founding in 1991 contained a metal slide and a community trellis. The slide and trellis were destroyed in December 2006 to make way for park \"renovation\". The original playground is still visible on Google Earth.\n\nPier A was originally used as a pier for ships and was recrafted as a park in 1999. It extends from the southern end of Hoboken (just north of the Hoboken Terminal) east into the Hudson River, with a view of the entire Manhattan skyline. At this point, the Hudson River starts to be affected by the tides in New York Bay. Pier A has a water-jet fountain, bike paths, rows of trees (some of them transplanted in maturity), a big field, a fishing area (with water pumps and cutting boards) and a gazebo at its eastern extremity. It is an example of good civic design, particularly the grass field which is firm and natural-looking though its sod is layered atop concrete.\n\nSince Pier A is the nearest park to downtown Hoboken, at lunchtime on weekdays, many office workers take the time to stroll on the pier. On hot, summer weekends, the grassy field is swarming with sun worshippers. In warm weather, movies are shown on the pier at night, the blazing Manhattan skyline rising behind the screen. On one Saturday during the summer, a town fair is held on Pier A, including music, craft shops and rides for the kids. Hoboken also has its Fourth of July celebrations on Pier A.\n\nMany people witnessed the September 11, 2001 Attacks from Pier A because it had good views of the World Trade Center. On March 11, 2002 a memorial service was held on Pier A. On September 11, 2003 a section of land was created as a memorial for the September 11, 2001 victims (by planting trees). Currently, there is a temporary memorial to victims in the form of a tear drop. A permanent memorial is currently under construction.\n\nStevens Park is bordered on the west by St. Peter & Paul Church, on the south by the Marineview Plaza complex, on the east by the Hoboken Little League Field, and on the North by buildings of the Stevens Institute of Technology.\n\nWithin Stevens Park is a large playground and one of the few unique playgrounds left in Hoboken. \nOther one-of-a-kind playgrounds that have since been destroyed include the very tall playground in Columbus Park, destroyed in 2002, and the wooden playground in Church Square Park, destroyed in 1994.\n\nThere is also a very rare exposed section of serpentine rock in the southern portion of the park, which has been eroded away over the years by people stepping on it. In the central section of the park is a dog run, which is smaller than the one in Church Square Park, and as a result, the park area surrounding the dog run is cleaner. Also, in the western part of the park are two Dahlgren guns (from the USS Portsmouth) facing west towards the St. Peter & Paul Church's cafeteria. A scientist found ancient writings on a stone when he was studying the park.\n\nElysian Park is a small park in Hoboken, New Jersey that is the last remnant of the Elysian Fields. Bounded on the west by Hudson Street, and the north and east by Sinatra Drive, Elysian Park has two play areas, a basketball court, a sprinkler, a dog run and rest rooms. The northern end of prestigious Castle Point Terrace ends at the park. Part of the 1954 film \"On The Waterfront\" was filmed there.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2144268", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2144268", "title": "Pectinase", "text": "Pectinase\n\nPectinase is an enzyme that breaks down pectin, a polysaccharide found in plant cell walls. Commonly referred to as pectic enzymes, they include pectolyase, pectozyme, and polygalacturonase, one of the most studied and widely used commercial pectinases. It is useful because pectin is the jelly-like matrix which helps cement plant cells together and in which other cell wall components, such as cellulose fibrils, are embedded. Therefore, pectinase enzymes are commonly used in processes involving the degradation of plant materials, such as speeding up the extraction of fruit juice from fruit, including apples and sapota. Pectinases have also been used in wine production since the 1960s. The function of pectinase in brewing is twofold, first it helps break down the plant (typically fruit) material and so helps the extraction of flavours from the mash. Secondly the presence of pectin in finished wine causes a haze or slight cloudiness. Pectinase is used to break this down and so clear the wine.\n\nThey can be extracted from fungi such as \"Aspergillus niger\". The fungus produces these enzymes to break down the middle lamella in plants so that it can extract nutrients from the plant tissues and insert fungal hyphae. If pectinase is boiled it is denatured (unfolded) making it harder to connect with the pectin at the active site, and produce as much juice.\n\nPectinases are also used for retting. Addition of chelating agents or pretreatment of the plant material with acid enhance the effect of the enzyme.\n\nAs with all enzymes, pectinases have an optimum temperature and pH at which they are most active. For example, a commercial pectinase might typically be activated at 45 to 55 °C and work well at a pH of 3.0 to 6.5.\nPectinase is commonly used in fruit industries to speed up fruit juice extraction.\n\nPectinase enzymes are used for extracting juice from purée.\nThis is done when the enzyme pectinase breaks down the substrate pectin and the juice is extracted. The enzyme pectinase lowers the activation energy needed for the juice to be produced and catalyzes the reaction.\n"}

He played in the Premier League and Football League for nine clubs, and at senior international level for the England national team.\n\nBent started his career with Godmanchester Rovers before being scouted by Ipswich Town. After progressing through their youth system, he made his first-team debut in 2001. He made 122 appearances and scored 48 goals in the league for Ipswich, before joining Charlton Athletic for a fee of £2.5 million in 2005. He was Charlton Athletic's top goalscorer for two consecutive seasons and joined Tottenham Hotspur for a club-record fee of £16.5 million in 2007. After two seasons at Tottenham, he joined Sunderland. After a successful 18 months at Sunderland, he joined Aston Villa in 2011. Bent had loans with Fulham, Brighton & Hove Albion and Derby County, and after being released by Villa in 2015, joined Derby permanently.\n\nBent represented England at under-15, under-16, under-19, under-21 and senior levels. He made 14 appearances and scored 9 goals for the under-21 team after making his debut against Italy in 2003. He made his debut for the senior England team in 2006 against Uruguay, and went on to make 13 appearances for England, scoring four goals. He scored his first goal on 7 September 2010 in a 3–1 UEFA Euro 2012 qualifying match victory against Switzerland.\n\nBent was born in Tooting, Greater London to a family of Jamaican descent. His father, Mervyn Bent, was a player in the youth systems of Wimbledon and Brentford. He moved to Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire at age ten and attended Hinchingbrooke school and played for the Godmanchester Rovers youth system. Bent is a supporter of Arsenal and used to have a season ticket at Highbury. He was handed a formal caution by police in June 2004 after he was alleged to have shot a 12-year-old with a pellet gun. Bent refrains from drinking alcohol and is a Christian.\n\nBent progressed through Ipswich Town's youth system, having joined the club at age 14 in 1998, after considering a possible career in athletics. He signed a professional contract with Ipswich on 2 July 2001. He made his first-team debut on 1 November 2001 in a 3–1 victory against Helsingborg in the UEFA Cup, and scored his first senior goal in a 4–1 League Cup defeat to Newcastle United on 27 November 2001.\n\nBent scored his first Premier League goal on 24 April 2002 in a 1–0 win over Middlesbrough. He finished the 2001–02 season with seven appearances and two goals in all competitions, and also saw his team Ipswich face relegation into the First Division. He scored the winning goal against Slovan Liberec in the UEFA Cup on 31 October 2002 and finished 2002–03 with 18 goals. The 2003–04 season finished with Bent scoring 16 goals, which was followed by 20 goals in 2004–05, being the team's joint highest goalscorer with Shefki Kuqi.\n\nBent completed a transfer to Charlton Athletic on 1 June 2005, which was worth an initial fee of £2.5 million, but would have risen to £3 million if he made an agreed number of appearances for Charlton and for England. On the opening day of the 2005–06 Premier League season, Bent scored two goals on his Charlton debut against Sunderland, and was named Premier League Player of the Month for August. He scored in his first four appearances for the club, one of only six players to perform this feat in the Premier League. Bent was the highest scoring Englishman in the Premier League in 2005–06, with 18 goals (22 overall), which made him third highest scorer and was given Charlton's Player of the Year award. He signed an extension to his contract at Charlton in July, which contracted him until June 2010. Bent finished 2006–07 with 13 goals in the Premier League, again finishing as Charlton's top goalscorer, but was unable to prevent them from being relegated into the Championship after seven successive seasons of Premier League football. Charlton accepted a bid from West Ham United for him in June 2007, but Bent was not interested in a move to Upton Park.\n\nBent completed a move to Tottenham Hotspur for a club-record fee of £16.5 million on 29 June 2007, which was to be payable over three years and is inclusive of add-on payments. Ipswich were entitled to 20% of Charlton's profit on Bent under a sell-on clause, which gave the club an initial £2.58 million. He scored his first competitive goal for Tottenham in a 4–0 home victory over Derby County in August 2007. This was followed up by scoring in the 6–1 win over Anorthosis Famagusta in the first round of the UEFA Cup on 20 September 2007. Bent was an unused substitute for the 2008 League Cup Final at Wembley Stadium on 24 February, as Tottenham beat Chelsea 2–1 after extra time. He scored his 100th career goal on 9 March 2008 in the added time of a 4–0 league win over West Ham. He also scored the 100th goal to be scored at White Hart Lane during 2007–08 on 22 March in a 2–0 win over Portsmouth. Bent went on to score one more goal in the 2007–08 season, against Newcastle United, which he finished with 36 appearances and 8 goals.\n\nBent scored 12 goals for Tottenham during the 2008–09 pre-season. His first league goal of the season came against Chelsea, which gave his team a 1–1 draw. He scored a header in the second half of Tottenham's UEFA Cup first round match against Wisła Kraków, giving the team a 2–1 victory. On 6 November, in a match against Dinamo Zagreb, Bent scored his first competitive hat-trick for Tottenham. He followed this up with two goals in a 2–1 victory against Manchester City at the City of Manchester Stadium.\n\nA miss in front of an open goal in the final minutes during a home match against Portsmouth in January 2009, which cost Tottenham two points, prompted manager Harry Redknapp to claim, \"You will never get a better chance to win a match than that. My missus could have scored that one.\" On 31 January, Bent scored two goals in the period of two minutes against Bolton Wanderers at the Reebok Stadium after coming on as a second-half substitute, in a match that eventually finished as a 3–2 defeat. Following the return of striker Robbie Keane at Tottenham, Redknapp assured Bent of his future at the club. He finished the season as Tottenham's top goalscorer with 17 goals in 43 matches.\n\nSunderland opened negotiations to sign Bent in July 2009. The deal seemed delayed and through social networking website Twitter he accused club chairman Daniel Levy of disrupting his move to Sunderland, although Bent later apologised, saying he acted out of frustration. He travelled to Sunderland to sign for the club after they agreed a fee with Tottenham, and after passing a medical, Bent signed for Sunderland on 5 August for an initial fee of £10 million plus potential additional payments, which later rose to £16.5 million. He scored on his Sunderland debut, which was the only goal in a 1–0 victory against Bolton, and was followed with Sunderland's opening goal against Chelsea in a 3–1 defeat. He scored a brace in the 4–1 win over Hull City to give himself his third and fourth goals in five matches.\n\nBent scored Sunderland's only goal against Burnley at Turf Moor, making the score 1–1, before losing 3–1. He scored again in a 5–2 win against Wolverhampton Wanderers, although after the match, Sunderland manager Steve Bruce was left angry at Bent's decision to give Sunderland's second penalty kick to teammate Kenwyne Jones, after the latter \"pleaded\" with Bent to take the penalty so that he could get on the score sheet. Bent scored in a 1–0 victory against Liverpool on 17 October 2009 when his shot hit a beach ball thrown onto the field by a Liverpool fan and past confused goalkeeper Pepe Reina into the net. He scored his first hat-trick for Sunderland in a 4–0 victory over Bolton on 9 March 2010. He scored two goals, one a penalty, but missed two other penalties as they were saved by Heurelho Gomes in a 3–1 victory against former club Tottenham on 3 April. Bent finished the 2009–10 season with 25 goals in 40 appearances in all competitions, 24 of which came in the Premier League, amounting to 50% of Sunderland's 48 goals in the league that season. He was named as Sunderland's Player of the Year.\n\nBent made his first appearance of 2010–11 in the opening match, a 2–2 draw with Birmingham City on 14 August and opened the scoring with a penalty in the 24th minute. He scored the winning goal with stoppage time penalty as Sunderland beat Manchester City 1–0 on 29 August. Bent scored the equaliser during stoppage time to earn Sunderland a 1–1 draw against Arsenal on 18 September. He then scored twice in Sunderland's 2–2 draw at Liverpool.\n\nOn 17 January 2011, Bent submitted a transfer request, amid reports that Aston Villa had made a club-record £18 million bid for him, which was rejected. Villa then submitted an improved offer of £18 million, potentially rising to £24 million, which was then accepted. The following day, Bent completed his move to Villa and signed a four-and-a-half-year deal. He scored the winning goal on his debut against Manchester City in a 1–0 victory at Villa Park. Bent scored his second Villa goal in his third appearance for his team when he completed the full 90 minutes against Manchester United at Old Trafford in a 3–1 away defeat. Bent scored both of Villa's goals in their 2–1 away victory over Arsenal in the penultimate match of the season on 15 May. The first was a nicely crafted volley after he chested down a Kyle Walker chipped pass, with the second coming a few minutes later after a slip from Arsenal's Thomas Vermaelen allowed Ashley Young the time to thread a pass through the Gunners' defence and Bent to sidefoot home for 2–0. He finished the season with 9 goals in 16 Premier League appearances for Villa, becoming the club's joint top-scorer with Ashley Young, despite only joining in January. He was also the top English goalscorer in the Premier League and the fourth highest scorer overall that season with 17 goals, eight of which were scored for Sunderland.\n\nIn his first full season with Villa, Bent scored his first goal of the season against Blackburn Rovers in a 3–1 victory on 20 August 2011. In his first match against former club Sunderland, a 2–2 draw at the Stadium of Light on 29 October 2011, every time he received a touch on the ball, he was booed by the home support. Bent then suffered an injury during the match against Bolton and was out for the next few matches as a result. Bent caused controversy when a fan posted a picture and claimed the striker was out shopping while his teammates were losing 2–0 to Liverpool. It was later revealed Bent had been sent home to recover from his injury and afterwards he apologised to the Villa fans for his actions. After apologising, Villa manager Alex McLeish reacted angrily to the \"conspiracy theory\" over Bent's absence for Villa. This led to Bent having to deny a fall-out with McLeish. Bent made his return as a 78th-minute substitute in the match against Chelsea on 31 December 2011, scoring the third goal to seal a 3–1 win at Stamford Bridge. After not scoring in the next two matches, Bent went on a run by scoring in the next four matches for Villa, including his first FA Cup goal in a Villa shirt on 29 January 2012, against Arsenal in an eventual 3–2 defeat. Three days later, Bent scored his 100th Premier League goal as Villa came from behind to earn a 2–2 home draw against Queens Park Rangers. He was the 21st player to reach the milestone.\n\nOn 25 February 2012, in a match against Wigan Athletic, Bent landed awkwardly on his ankle after tangling with Antolín Alcaraz. He was stretchered off the pitch with what was thought to be a serious injury. This was confirmed two days later, after Bent had a scan on his ankle that revealed he had ruptured ligaments. He was out for three months which effectively ended his season with Villa and most likely his chance to play at UEFA Euro 2012. Bent had recovered from his injury by mid-May and was in contention for Villa's final match of 2011–12 against Norwich City but was ultimately left out. This also gave him the possibility of making new England manager Roy Hodgson's Euro 2012 England squad. Bent vowed to prove his fitness to Hodgson, in the hope he would be selected to play in the tournament. Bent once again finished as Villa's top scorer with 10 goals in 25 appearances and vowed to stay on at the club.\n\nIn July 2012, Bent was named interim captain of Aston Villa while Stiliyan Petrov continued to recover from leukaemia. On 28 August, Bent scored his first goal of 2012–13 in a 3–0 victory over League One team Tranmere Rovers in the second round of the League Cup, his first goal for Villa since February 2012. Bent lost the Villa captaincy to Ron Vlaar, after the Dutchman was appointed captain for the 2–0 victory against Swansea City on 15 September 2012 and thereafter. He scored his first league goal of the season on 22 September, in a 4–1 defeat away to Southampton. Bent then lost his starting place for the next league match against West Bromwich Albion, after the performances of Gabriel Agbonlahor and Christian Benteke during the midweek League Cup victory over Manchester City saw the pair start up front. However, after coming on for Benteke as a 68th-minute substitute, Bent followed up his goal against Southampton by grabbing the equaliser in a 1–1 draw.\n\nBent joined Villa's Premier League rivals Fulham on a season-long loan on 16 August 2013. He scored his first goal for Fulham on 24 August 2013 on his debut, 18 minutes after replacing Damien Duff in a 3–1 defeat at home to London rivals Arsenal. On 24 September, only three minutes after coming on for Adel Taarabt, he scored the winner in a 2–1 home win over Everton in the third round of the League Cup. Again as a late substitute, this time for Dimitar Berbatov, he scored the only goal in Fulham's home league win over Stoke City on 5 October, taking control of Pajtim Kasami's shot and cutting past Robert Huth.\n\nDespite scoring in the first match and replay against Norwich City in the third round of the FA Cup, Bent went 13 league matches without scoring before an added-time equaliser at Old Trafford to gain a 2–2 draw against Manchester United on 9 February after replacing Muamer Tanković at half-time. He finished his loan with 6 goals in 30 matches, and Fulham were relegated into the Championship.\n\nOn 26 November 2014, Bent joined Brighton & Hove Albion on a one-month loan. Three days later, he scored on his debut for the Championship club, opening a 2–1 defeat to his former employers Fulham at Falmer Stadium.\n\nAfter two goals in five appearances for Brighton, Bent was loaned to another Championship club, Derby County, on 2 January 2015. He was signed by his former international manager Steve McClaren on a deal lasting until the end of the season. With his fourth goal in five matches, he equalised in a 2–2 draw away to then league leaders AFC Bournemouth on 10 February 2015. Bent scored 12 goals from 17 appearances as Derby finished in eighth place in the Championship table, missing out on a play-off place by one point. He was released by Aston Villa on 8 June 2015, ahead of a permanent transfer to Derby on a two-year contract, with a one-year option.\n\nOn 26 January 2018, Bent joined Derby's Championship rivals Burton Albion on loan for the remainder of the 2017–18 season. He was yet to make a first team appearance for Derby during the 2017–18 season after suffering a pre-season hamstring injury. He scored his first goal for Burton in a 3–1 loss away to Cardiff City on 30 March 2018. On 21 April 2018 Bent scored a goal against his former club Sunderland as Burton came from a goal down to win 2–1 and condemn the former club to their second relegation in as many seasons. He was released by Derby at the end of the 2017–18 season.\n\nBent announced his retirement from playing on 25 July 2019.\n\nBent made his debut for the England national under-15 team on 15 October 1999 as an 85th-minute substitute in a 2–1 win over Northern Ireland in the team's opening match at the 1999 Victory Shield. He started the following match on 28 October 1999, scoring in the third minute as England beat Wales 3–1. He played in all three matches, scoring once, as England won the tournament, topping the table with nine points. Bent represented the under-15s at the 2000 Ballymena Tournament, starting in their first match on 24 April, a 1–0 defeat to Switzerland. The following day, he scored England's four goals in their 4–0 win over Finland. Bent scored in England's 3–2 win over Belgium on 29 April 2000 in the seventh-place match. He finished his under-15 career with seven goals in eight appearances from 1999 to 2000.\n\nBent made his under-16 debut on 31 July in their opening match at the 2000 Nordic Cup, coming on as a substitute as England beat Finland 2–1. He scored in the 52nd minute of England's 3–0 win over the Faroe Islands on 3 August 2000, before starting in the final the following day, in which England were beaten 3–0 by Sweden. Bent represented England at the 2001 Algarve Tournament, appearing as a substitute in the team's three matches as they were eliminated at the group stage. He made 11 appearances and scored 3 goals for the under-16s from 2000 to 2001.\n\nHis debut for the under-19 team came on 14 February 2002 when starting against Germany in a friendly, scoring two goals in a 3–1 victory. Bent scored in the 33rd minute of a 1–1 draw with Lithuania on 17 April 2002 in the 2002 UEFA European Under-19 Championship qualification intermediary round first leg, with a 2–1 win in the second leg securing England's qualification for the tournament. He finished his time with the under-19s with three appearances, scoring three goals, in 2002.\n\nBent's first appearance for the under-21 team came on 11 February 2003 as a 71st-minute substitute against Italy in a friendly, which England lost 1–0. His first goal came on his second appearance on 2 June 2003, with an 87th-minute winner in a 3–2 win over Serbia and Montenegro in a friendly. He played in both leg's of England's 3–2 aggregate defeat to France in the 2006 UEFA European Under-21 Championship qualification play-offs, and scored in the 55th minute of the 2–1 defeat on 15 November 2005 in the second leg. This was his last appearance for the under-21s, finishing his time with them with 14 appearances and 9 goals.\n\nBent received his first call up to the senior England team for the friendly against Denmark on 17 August 2005, but did not play in the match. His England debut eventually came on 1 March 2006, when he started against Uruguay at Anfield in a pre-2006 FIFA World Cup friendly match. He was not included in England's World Cup squad when it was announced in May 2006.\n\nDespite having played for the senior team, Bent was recalled to the under-21 squad for their October 2006 qualification play-offs against Germany. Later that month, he was recalled to the senior squad due to an injury to Andrew Johnson shortly after the squad's announcement. He was called to the England squad for a UEFA Euro 2008 qualifier against Croatia in November 2007. He came on as an 80th-minute substitute as England lost 3–2 and failed to qualify for the tournament. He was called up to the team for a 2010 FIFA World Cup qualifier against Ukraine in March 2009 following an injury to striker Carlton Cole. He made his second start for England in a 1–0 friendly defeat to Brazil on 14 November 2009. Bent was named in England's preliminary 30-man squad for the 2010 World Cup on 11 May 2010, although he was eventually omitted from the final 23-man squad on 1 June.\n\nBent scored his first international goal in England's 3–1 away win over Switzerland after appearing as a substitute for Jermain Defoe in a Euro 2012 qualifier on 7 September 2010. Then-England manager Fabio Capello stated he had been impressed with the improvement in Bent's all-round game since his World Cup omission and selected him in the starting 11 for England's friendly with Denmark, where he scored a tap-in from a Theo Walcott cross. Bent retained his place for England's Euro 2012 qualifier with Wales to make his first competitive international start on 26 March 2011. In scoring England's second goal, he took his tally to three goals in his last three matches. Bent recovered from injury in time but was left out of the final 23-man squad for Euro 2012 as then-England manager Roy Hodgson felt Bent would not be fit enough to appear at the tournament.\n\nTottenham Hotspur\n\nEngland U15\n\nEngland U16\n\nIndividual\n"}

According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nTabina was formed out of the Municipality of Dimataling on August 16, 1961, by virtue of Executive Order No. 443 signed by President Carlos P. Garcia. Upon its creation, Tabina has twelve (12) barangays which comprised its original territory.\n\n4 new barangays (Capisan, Doña Josefina, New Oroquita, San Francisco) were later created. When the Municipality of Pitogo was created, barangay Limbayan was detached from the Municipality of Tabina to be added to the new municipality, thus, resulting in a total number of fifteen (15) barangays within its jurisdiction.\n\nHistorically, the earliest settlers of Tabina were the Subanens who have settled in the different parts of the Zamboanga Peninsula. They are followed by the Muslims, and then the Christians. The name itself has many different origins, open to interpretation. One states that it comes from the inhabitants’ expression of “tabi-una”, a polite expression meaning “excuse me”.Â Another points out to the inhabitants’ characteristic expression of being talkative which, in the local tongue, is being “tabi-an”. Meanwhile, the Muslim immigrants were said to be attracted by the abundance of local seashells known as “binga” in their native tongue. It also happened to be called “ubina”. The Christians who happened to pass by Tabina inquired about the name of the place and, always hearing “bina”, modified it to “Tabina” and the name has stuck ever since.\nMost of Tabina is characterized as having steep mountains and undulating hills. The majority of the barangays tower to about 50 to 200 feet above sea level. There are no coastal plains or valleys in the municipality; the coasts themselves run down to shores and high cliffs.\nThere are several tourist attractions in Tabina as well. There’s the Tambunan Beach and Marine Sanctuary, the Barangay Malim and Marine Sanctuary, Talisay Beach, and the Pod-ok Mangrove Boardwalk.\n\nIt is the southernmost part of Zamboanga del Sur, facing the area wherein the waters of Illana Bay flows out to the Moro Gulf. It is about 63 kilometers away from Pagadian City, the province’s capital. Its boundaries are the municipality of Dimataling on the north, the Celebes Sea on the south, the municipality of Pitogo on the west, and another body of water, Illana Bay, on the east. Tabina can be reached via land through a provincial road passing through five municipalities so those who are thinking of going to Tabina should prepare for a long journey through rural places. The municipality has a land area of 8,690 hectares and these are distributed to the municipality’s current 15 regular and de facto barangays.\n\nTabina is politically subdivided into 15 barangays.\n\n\nTertiary\n\n\nSecondary\n\n\nElementary\n\n\nMore Views\n\n"}

{"id": "2144281", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2144281", "title": "Tukuran, Zamboanga del Sur", "text": "Tukuran, Zamboanga del Sur\n\n', officially the ', (Cebuano: \"Lungsod Sa Tukuran\"; ; Iranun: \"Tukudan\"), is a in the province of , . According to the , it has a population of people.\n\n\"Kargado\", a movie starring Gardo Versoza, was shot in Tukuran at Tabak E Beach Resort (now E and D beach) in 1998 \"(circa\").\n\nThe town of Tukuran is situated in the isthmus of Zamboanga peninsula of its southern part.\nAfter the construction of Maharlika Highway or the Tukuran-Dabliston Road, a national highway, Tukuran became the passageway of two regions – that are Region 9 and Region 10. The City of Pagadian can be reached within 20 minutes via private vehicle while 45–50 minutes via public utility vehicle or PUJ.\n\nTukuran is politically subdivided into 25 barangays.\nThe original inhabitants were Subanens and Iranuns. Tukuran is derived from the word \"tukod\" meaning \"to build\" or \"to construct\". Its original inhabitants were Subanuns and Iranuns.\n\nHistorically, Tukuran was a passing point of many merchants because of its location on the trade route. Merchants of different tribes regularly passed by the area, carrying with them their wares. These merchants usually came from the nearby provinces, most specifically, Zamboanga City and Southern Mindanao, as well as the places of Lanao and the Misamis region (Misamis Occidental and Misamis Oriental). When the Spaniards came, they tried to control the trade route, building the famous Fort Militar that overlooks Tukuran and the northern part of Illana Bay, as well as the so-called Spanish Trocha which then connected Tukuran directly to the regions of Lanao and Misamis. It came to be known as the Trocha de Tukuran .\n\nClose to the end of the century,in 1899, the Muslims, under the leadership of Sultan Amay Untad Panduma, founded a settlement in Tukuran. They claimed to have come from the Iranon tribe. Since their number was large, they decided to divide themselves and settle in the neighboring sitios. Sultan Paduma's descendants succeeded him in ruling the group.\n\nThe first wave of Christian settlers followed a few years later, led by Felix Ocampo. They hailed from far up north, in Manila. They chose to settle in the shores of Tukuran. They were later followed by the settlers from Pangasinan together with their families and farming equipment.\n\nBefore Tukuran became a municipality, it was a part of the municipality of Labangan, until November 29, 1958, when President Carlos P. Garcia, under the recommendation of the Zamboanga del Sur Provincial Board headed by Governor Bienvenido Ebarle, signed Executive Order No. 323 making Tukuran a municipality. The first municipal mayor appointed to head the municipality was Mayor Filomeno C. Villamero (who was then elected vice mayor of Labangan), with Sultan Mamadra Panduma as the vice mayor.\n\nAn excerpt from the Treaty of Sultan Kudarat of Maguindanao and King Philip IV of Spain signed on June 24, 1645 proves that the place used to be vassalage of the Sultan of Maguindanao. Islam was the dominant religion of the land. There was no king to rule, nor there existed a single law signifying the rights and duties of the subjects. Each datu considered himself as the most outstanding and powerful chieftain of the place and yet he had no more loyal subjects than his relatives and slaves. According to Thomas Forrest in 1780 Tukuran is a place where Iranuns lived in, built and repaired prahus. There were several services conducted by Spaniards in the isthmus of Tukuran because of it being the strategic place for a Spanish stronghold and to shorten communication in the north of Pangil Bay to south of Illana Bay, as well. On March 12, 1890 a fortified station named after the member of the royal family fort Alfonso XII locally known as fort Militar was built to stop the Moro from their slave-raiding activities against the Subanu people to Christians, and to facilitate their pacification on Mindanao campaign of colonization in general. Governor General Valeriano Weyler proposed the construction of a canal across the isthmus. the plan, however, did not realize.\n\nMoro resistance on the hill of Tagulo, a sitio of Tukuran was pacified; the Moros were forced to abandon the place on October 15, 1900 and the place was occupied by American soldiers. In 1912, Tukuran was established as a military district and then became a municipal district in 1918 with a population of 3,921. Due to the ongoing piratical raids, the people transferred the seat of the government to Labangan in 1921; settlers began to arrive. As a result of the heavy influx of the settlers from Luzon and Visayas there was fragile co-existence among the indigenous Moro, Lumads and Christian populations. In Luy-a and Camanga, Subanens retreated to the hinterlands and the Iranun Muslims gradually transferred to Labangan. Moros from Kalibaw, Karumatan (municipality of Karomatan) continued to raid the town. With this marauding activity, the American soldiers' attention was divided. The beach (front and shell depot) played an important role as a landing site of series of landing of ammunitions from Australia to supply the Guerilla Movement in Mindanao.\nDuring the early days of resettlement, English was the lingua franca. The town fiesta was first celebrated in 1938 with San Isidro (Saint Isidore) as the patron.\n\nThe first contact with the Americans since World War II began was on March 5, 1943, when the US submarine Tambor passed by in Tukuran and distributed supplies. On board the submarine were Charles M. Smith and Commodore Charles Parson. These American officers informed Australia about the location of Tukuran as a good docking site. In the morning of January 25, 1945 at about 11:00 a US sea plane \"Santa Catalina\" landed on the beach to unload supplies. During liberation period, American planes in V-formation fly in the sky. Displaced Tukuranons returned home and started to fix their abandoned homes. Schools were reopened and life returned to normal.\n\nMayor Filomino Villamero, the mayor of the town of Labangan considered the idea of making Tukuran a municipality by virtue of Executive Order 323 signed by his Excellency Carlos P. Garcia on November 29, 1958. Tukuran became a municipality. During the early 1960s many Tukuranons had experienced the abundance of the sea. Some of the family especially the taga-baybay, coastline dwellers found fortune in the fishing industry. Curvada was the trading center of Tukuran during this time. Lab-asiros (fish traders) have usually experienced difficulty in transporting the tuna to Curvada due to the sticky mud in going to Tukuran proper. This decade was considered by Tukuranons as the dawn of the fishing industry of the town.\n\nThe center of the trading is in Curvada (the present PNP visibility post). Cans from the shore to Curvada were manually handled and which contained fresh fish. The trading activity was very progressive. There were Chinese -Filipinos who once lived there but vanished later due to their superstitious beliefs that the town was not favorable for business. Lab-aseros(fish traders), had usually experienced a difficulty in transporting the tuna to Curvada due to its sticky muddy road going to the trading center. Lupoy, an ordinary fish during this time was even visible at Canawa creek during high tide, and even crabs and other marine creatures were of abundance. Trucks from Aurora stayed only at Curvada because of the poor road condition and only waited for the lab-aseros to come and sell.\n\nThis decade was characterized by military instability and natural calamities that affected the people's socio-economic activity.\n\nGreat Fire in Poblacion\n\nOn January 21, 1971 at about one o'clock after the stall keepers had taken their lunch a day on the festivity of Sr. Santo Niño of Pagadian, a great fire brought disaster on the first year of this decade. About a hundred houses and commercial establishments were burned down but luckily, no one was hurt. This caused an economic breakdown of the municipality as it was estimated to cost 2 million of the properties lost. Aid from the government through DSWD and some NGOs helped the townsfolk stand again from the ashes.\n\nThe Barracuda – Ilaga Conflict\n\nCommander Toothpick, a Tiruray tribal warrior was known to fight against alleged Muslim terrorism and exploitation. It was this time that the term Ilaga was introduced into the vocabulary.\"Ilaga\" means \"rat\" but Muslims of North Cotabato called it \"Ilonggo Land Grabbing Association\".The Ilaga was a Paramilitary Organization known for its anti-Muslim sentiments. It was composed initially, as reported in media, of some Ilonggo natives of Panay.\n\nThe physical pattern of events showed the spread of conflicts, from North Cotabato to Lanao del Sur, from Cotabato to Lanao del Norte, and from Cotabato to Zamboanga del Sur. Tukuran is the first coastal municipality from Lanao Sur in Illana Bay. The murder of Al Mirasan Tampogao, vice mayor of Carumatan, in Tukuran at Santo Niño, Tukuran is said to be one of catalyst of the Barracuda attacks in the area. The alleged assassin was a member of Ilaga, a group known for its anti-Muslim sentiments. After that incident, there had been fears of a Moro attack on the town to avenge the Vice Mayor's death. In May, the rebels in front of the burned Municipal hall of Labangan kidnapped Father O'Halpin, the parish priest of Tukuran, on his way back to the town, but he was released later. This related incident added to the suspicions that a conflict will soon come. At this time Labangan was in the hands of the Barracudas (black shirts). A suspected Barracuda attack on the town mayor's residence on the third week of April 1972 added to the tension between the two groups, although it was also suspected the attack was politically motivated. Consequently, the 29th IB, PA was able to intercept a message revealing that on July 27, 1973, there will be an attack on the town; the attack took place at early morning on the day before the set date, on the 26th.\n\nEven though the 29th IB, Philippine Army had intercepted the rebels at Lambayong now Baranggay Panduma Sr. which is seventy five meters from the shore, the Barracudas were able to take hostage a pumpboat operator along the way and were successful in taking over the Shell Depot which is located just a few meters from the shore. The depot manager was killed. However, their alleged plan to destroy the depot was stopped because of the Army's intervention by then. The group split in two: one group retreated to Luy-a where they beheaded two civilians and slaughtered one carabao for consumption and fed on uncooked mais. It took them a week to retreat since there were blockades by the 29th Infantry Brigade in their way. Eventually, the rebels were able to escape going to Lanao del Norte. The other group attacked Militar and neighboring coastal barangays. Blockades by the 29th IB, PA at Tukuran River prevented them to penetrate the town center; they were forced to retreat to the hinterlands of Libertad. Some casualties were not being reported due to the tension being experienced by the people. As they retreated, passing Barangay Baclay, they ambushed the Parish Priest of Aurora, Father Paulo Kill and luckily, he survived. In the aftermath, the rebels left 46 civilians, 11 rebels and IPAs dead.\n\nThe Barracuda-Ilaga Conflict had greatly depopulated the municipality as majority of the people relocated to other towns. Atty. Francisco D. Boter, the municipal registrar, in his article in Pagadian Times reported:\n\"Like a volcano that had erupted, Tukuran became a ghost town with only a handful of people roaming the streets with the mournful howling of scraggy dogs now and then disturbing the cemetery-like silence and solitude that pervaded the ones buzzing and taming residents.\"\"\n\nOn the evening of August 17, 1976, tsunami ravaged Illana Bay or 1976 Moro Gulf earthquake. It was caused by a 6.7 magnitude undersea earthquake. People that night living in the coast heard the roaring sound of the sea, ran to save their lives going to Curvada at about 9:30 in the evening. In Bayao, houses were washed out into the mangroves and into the Bayao River delta. This time the residents were given assistance by the joint group of social action center (SAC), Kapapagaria Foundation Inc. (KFI) in coordination with the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD). Despite the devastation, only one casualty was reported.\n\nThe decade of 70s left three marks: first, as the years of ashes that brought destruction to Poblacion that caused severe economic breakdown of the municipality. Second, the tsunami on Illana Bay that destroyed properties. Third, was the Ilaga-Barracuda conflict in Tukuran that brought famine and hunger to the people and the very reason of the depopulation of the municipality. The general masses, both Christians and Muslims were caught in the middle of crossfire. Many of them transferred to neighboring towns of Aurora, Molave, Bonifacio, Pagadian, and even going back to Visayan islands, their homeland, if only to secure their life. Most of the Visayan people in the Poblacion took refuge in Dumaguete.\n\nIn 1978, right in his office, Mayor Antonio Jimenez, O.D. was arrested. An ASO or arrest and seizure order was issued against him from the national government. The remaining populace were baffled on the fate of the honorable mayor.\n\nA series of related incidents on PA and CPP-NPA struggles in Tukuran during the 1980s. This was because of the Marcos dictatorship, communist movement had spread in the whole archipelago in an aim to change the routine style of the government. In this decade most of the barangay people fled or were forced and obliged to seek refuge in concentration camps and schools to protect them from the crossfire of two raging forces.\n\nAfter EDSA revolution, Isaias Barrido was appointed as municipal mayor as part of the reorganization program of Aquino government. He was a former forest ranger assigned at the Baclay nursery, a reforestation project of the national government. The first challenge to his administration occurred on October 24, 1986 due to the intense operation of PA against CPP-NPA. A mistarget landed in Curvada rice field. Hundreds could have been killed if it landed in the public market.\n\nIn 1988, the new government of Corazon Aquino ordered the conduct of a local elections in the Philippines. Bonifacio Vega was elected town mayor. His first term was characterized as the height of CPP-NPA and PA struggle. In Tagulo incident, there were seven killed in the side of the government. PA strongly believes that it was done by the CPP-NPA. Because of the struggle of two raging forces, his administration adopted, through the advice of the military, the policy of hamleting. As a result, the farmers in the far-flung barangays suffered. The military had estimated 80% of the business sectors were influenced by the rebels. Some of the suspected members of the CPP-NPA were arrested. The mayor had a hard time solving the main problem of his municipality.\n\nVega won for the second time in the 1992 National Elections. The issue on the CPP-NPA struggle was eventually resolved due to the implementation of various projects which focused on both socio-economic and socio-cultural aspects. In the 1995 National Elections, Vega was set to run but then decided not to, due to health reasons. Instead, he endorsed Isaias Barrido under the banner of Lakas-NUCD. Isaias Barrido won the election. By the advent of IRA the barangays comprising the municipality were provided with increased shares of the financial resources of the government with the aim of enhancing the delivery of basic services to the people for the second time he was elected. Municipal road concreting was one of his main programs, livelihood programs were his\nmain focus. Because of the Internal Revenue Allotment (IRA) from the National Government, many projects were completed during his administration. He continued the construction of municipal streets, hanging bridge, solar driers, water reservoir, basketball courts, and farm to market roads to fasten the development of rural barangays. The municipal streets and other newly constructed infrastructures under the Barrido administration had changed greatly the profile of the municipality.\n\nThe town is primarily agricultural with rice as its main crop. It also has a thriving fishport. The town's long stretch of fine black sand is a popular weekend destination for people from Pagadian and neighboring towns.\n\nOne of the most important industries is fishery. Tukuran and Pagadian City and many of the western towns have rich fishing grounds and the fish caught in Tukuran and Pagadian City are transported to Ozamiz City, Iligan City and Cagayan de Oro City. The fish caught in the western towns, due to costly transportation, are either salted or dried and sold to neighboring provinces. Life in Tukuran is relatively abundant.\n\nTingson's \"Pangisda\" Festival Competition – Tribal dance competition every January organized by the owner of TS Fishing for yearly fiesta of Sr. Sto Niño of Cebu.On January 13, 2011, the second year competition was held with a grand prize of 50,000 Philippine peso. This competition will hopefully be held annually in coordination with the barangay (Santo Niño) and Municipal LGUs.\n\nMutya Ng Tukuran – An annual beauty competition highlighting the Araw ng Tukuran Celebration every April 1 of the calendar year.

According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nThe municipality is named after Zamboanga del Sur Governor and Representative Vincenzo Sagun.\n\nThere are no known historical records that can establish as to when the municipality started to exist as a community. What is known is that the municipality of Vincenzo Sagun as he is known today, was a product of the extraordinary efforts of a man bearing the same name.\n\nThe man VINCENZO A. SAGUN was a former member of the House of Representatives, representing the Province of Zamboanga del Sur, who left \"no stones unturned\" in seeking the formal creation of this erstwhile barangay of its mother Municipality, Margosatubig. Thru this tireless endeavor, President Diosdado Macapagal signed Presidential Proclamation No. 177, series of 1965, which created the MUNICIPALITY OF VINCENZO SAGUN.\n\nIn utmost recognition of the man whose efforts made it all possible for the municipality to exist as a distinct and separate local governing entity, the municipality was so named in his honor.\n\nFolklore tell us that the municipality's first inhabitants were the Subanons. They were to have established their settlements along the riverbanks and in the hinterlands as a very peaceful and highly coordinated tribe ruled by a powerful warrior-leader. Legend has it that this warrior-leader, called Culangan, possessed magical powers and is capable of superhuman strength-like jumping as high as seven feet with a 50-kilogram pig on his shoulders.\n\nThese early settlers lived in a scattered, pocket-sized settlements. But to celebrate the \"LOMPOK\", a local religious rite, they congregate in a certain place they called \"PAGBATAN\". For quite some time the place was called as such, until it was changed to \"KABATAN\", meaning \"the inhabitants\". In fact, when Vincenzo Sagun was still part of Margosatubig, it was known as Barangay Kabatan.\n\nVicenzo A. Sagun is a coastal municipality that is found in the southern section of Zamboanga del Sur. It is in the Baganian Peninsula, some 60 kilometers northwest of the province’s capital of Pagadian City. As for its boundaries, the municipality of Margosatubig can be found on the north, while the south is occupied by Maligay Bay and Dumanquilas Bay, on the southeast and the southwest, respectively. The municipality of Dimataling cradles it on the east. The total area of Vincenzo A. Sagun makes up 8.15% of Zamboanga del Sur’s area, and .041% of the whole Zamboanga Peninsula Region.\n\nOf the 14 barangays that Vincenzo Sagun has, 11 of them are coastal, and most of the inhabitants are fisherfolk by trade and livelihood. The municipality is noted for its rich marine resources, with some parts being groomed to be prime tourist aquatic spot. One of the Vincenzo Sagun’s featured products are the dried fish which are usually exported to the other provinces.\n\nVincenzo A. Sagun is politically subdivided into 14 barangays.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He was also the first African-American Senior Enlisted Advisor in any of the Armed Forces of the United States. He was key in bringing many African-American related issues to the attention of senior military leaders.\n\nBarnes enlisted the United States Air Force in April 1949 and received his basic training at Lackland Air Force Base, Texas. He later attended Aircraft and Engine School and Hydraulic Specialist School at Chanute Technical Training Center, Illinois. In October 1950 he was assigned to the 4th Troop Carrier Squadron of the 62nd Troop Carrier Group at McChord Air Force Base, Washington.\n\nIn November 1950, aged 20, Barnes transferred with the 4th Troop Carrier Squadron to Ashiya, Japan, in support of the Korean War. Shortly after arrival in Japan, he completed on-the-job training for flight engineer duties. Then, due to low unit manning, he performed both flight engineer and hydraulic specialist duties. In September 1951 he transferred to Tachikawa, Japan, and continued flight engineer duties.\n\nBarnes transferred in June 1952 to the 30th Air Transport Squadron, Westover Air Force Base, Massachusetts, where he attended C-118 school and continued his flight engineer duties in that aircraft. In September 1952, he volunteered for temporary duty with the 1708th Ferrying Group at Kelly Air Force Base, Texas, and participated in ferrying aircraft from various depots to Air Force organizations in Hawaii, Japan and Northeast Air Command. Upon completion of temporary duty, he returned to Westover.\n\nBarnes transferred to Andrews Air Force Base in December 1952, and served as crew chief and flight engineer on B-25, T-11, C-45 and C-47 aircraft in support of various requirements of Headquarters United States Air Force, Headquarters Military Air Transport Service, and the Air Research and Development Command. It was during this time that Barnes applied for commissioning and was accepted but had to turn down the opportunity because the pay cut which officer candidates experience while undergoing training would not allow him to continue to support his wife and children.\n\nBarnes transferred in June 1958 to the 42nd Bombardment Wing at Loring Air Force Base, Maine, in June 1958 and served as a B-52 crew chief, flight chief and senior controller. In September 1965 he went to Fairchild Air Force Base, Washington, and continued duties as senior controller. In October 1966, he entered the F-4 Field Training Detachment at George Air Force Base, California, and in December 1966 went to Southeast Asia. There he served with the 8th Tactical Fighter Wing as noncommissioned officer in charge, reparable processing center; senior controller; and noncommissioned officer in charge, maintenance control.\n\nBarnes returned from Southeast Asia to Laughlin Air Force Base, Texas, in December 1967, where his duties were T-38 section line chief; noncommissioned officer in charge, maintenance control; and senior enlisted advisor to the commander of the 3646th Pilot Training Wing. He was promoted to the grade of chief master sergeant on December 1, 1969, and was transferred to Headquarters Air Training Command in October 1971 to assume duties as command senior enlisted adviser.\n\nOn October 1, 1973, Barnes was appointed Chief Master Sergeant of the Air Force. At the expiration of the initial two-year tenure, he was extended for an additional year by the Chief of Staff. In February 1976 he was selected by the Chief of Staff to serve an unprecedented second year extension. He retired on July 31, 1977. He flew for nine years as a flight engineer on a variety of aircraft, seeing duty in Korea, the Cuban Missile Crisis, and Vietnam.\n\nFollowing his retirement from the Air Force, Barnes worked at the First National Bank of Fort Worth as an Employee Relations Officer for seven years. He was then hired by the Associates Corporation of North America and promoted to Vice President/Director of Employee Relations at the corporate headquarters in Las Colinas. After retiring to Fannin County, Texas, he raised Longhorn cattle and two years in a row won the team penning at the Kueckelhan Rodeo.\n\nBarnes died from cancer on March 17, 2003, in Sherman, Texas, where he had been undergoing treatment.\n\n"}

Dudley, Camp Dudley is the oldest continually running boys camp in the United States. It is located in Westport, New York, on the shores of Lake Champlain. In 1993, it was included within the Camp Dudley Road Historic District when listed on the listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nSumner Dudley, long active in both the New York and New Jersey YMCA movements, was asked in 1884 to take \"young honor YMCA members\" camping. In 1885, he took seven boys for a week's encampment at Orange Lake, N. J. The next year Dudley moved the site to Twin Islands, Lake Wawayanda, N.J. Ultimately, the camp settled on Lake Champlain, N.Y., in 1908. Dudley referred to the first camp as Camp Baldhead , and later the Boys' Camping Society (B.C.S.). After Dudley's death in 1897, the camp was renamed Camp Dudley.\n\nIn 2015 Camp Dudley officially parted ways with the YMCA after respectful discussions concerning the YMCA's desire to have control over Camp Dudley and Camp Dudley's desire to remain independent.\n\nCampers are assigned camp numbers in ascending order based on when they first attended Camp. The first camp number (No. 1) was assigned George Peck in 1903. Since then, over 25,000 campers, leaders, and staff have each been given a unique, identifying number. At alumni gatherings, there is often a competition to see who in attendance has the lowest (or oldest) camp number.\n\nNo longer officially operated by the YMCA, Camp Dudley is an independent camp managed by the Board of Managers. It draws from the YMCA's own tenets of mind, body, and spirit. Though non-denominational, the camp espouses \"Christian values\" in its teachings and programs, not least of which is its motto, \"The Other Fellow First\". The mission is to develop moral, personal, physical and leadership skills in the spirit of fellowship and fun, enabling boys and girls to lead lives characterized by devotion to others.\n\nThanks to a strong and financially supportive alumni base, the camp offers scholarships to those in financial need.\n\nIn the summer of 2006, Camp Dudley acquired a sister camp in Colchester, Vermont called Camp Dudley at Kiniya, after purchasing the former Camp Kiniya from the Williams family. A driving force in this expansion was for the daughters of Camp Dudley alumni to have a place to learn the same ethics and values that their sons could learn at Camp Dudley.\n\nOne of the unique characteristics of Dudley is the loyalty and support of its alumni. For most campers, their relationship with Dudley does not end with the close of the camping season but continues throughout their lives. Many former campers return as Leaders, and alumni and parents contribute to Dudley through their financial support. All friends of Dudley are invited to attend the alumni gatherings, as well as the August CDA Reunion at Camp. Between 35 and 40 alumni gatherings are held during the year throughout the country and around the world on the Dudley \"Reunion Trail\". 2009 was Camp Dudley's 125th summer.\n\nIn 2006 Camp Dudley officially acquired Camp Kiniya to expand its rich camping tradition to girls. Camp Kiniya was founded in 1919 by Helen Van Buren and lies on the Vermont shores of Lake Champlain, in Colchester. Traditions at Camp Kiniya include the Kiwi Day, where the entire camp celebrates campers and staffers who have attended for four years or more. Camp Dudley at Kiniya has grown into a balanced blend of both camps, including traditions from each original camp. There are 16 camper cabins, with additional staff cabins. The camp is divided into two divisions, Junior Division and Senior Division. Summer 2018 was the camp's 100th summer.\n\nAt both Dudley and Kiniya, there are cabins that support a variety of ages. At Dudley, campers are typically 10-14, and at Kiniya campers are 10-14. Girls and boys are placed in cabins based on their ages. The cabins are divided into divisions: Cubs, Plebes, Juniors, and Seniors for Dudley and Cubs, Cats, Juniors and Seniors for Kiniya. Kiniya is, in general, a smaller camp, with fewer campers and less acreage. When you finish your last camper year, you may apply to become an Aide, the first step on the road in being a leader. An Aide lives in cabins with young campers but still has the opportunity to play on sports teams with the oldest campers. At 16 and 17, you can become a Junior Leader or Assistant Leader, paid positions in cabins that are designed to support the leader. At 18, one may become a leader, the main counselor in the cabin. One can also be a program staff member at 18 and beyond, working in the Athletics, Arts, Outdoors, or Waterfront departments.\n\nThere are many athletic opportunities for boys and girls to participate in. There is:\nThese are played in a major, a specialized activity block for each child, or team competition, a time of the day where teams play sports against each other to learn the value of respect and good sportsmanship.\n\n\n\n\nThere is a very profound spiritual life at Kiniya and Dudley, especially on Sundays. There is a calm, non-religious chapel service on Sunday mornings with a guest speaker. Their purpose is to inspire the children with encouraging words for the following week. It is meant to help campers more fully understand \"The Other Fellow First\", and provides an atmosphere of togetherness and unity. The speakers provide many valuable life lessons in their speeches. All campers and staff members wear the camps' traditional blue and white colors to this service. On Sunday nights, the camps individually gather to sing Hymns. This is one of the most valued traditions of both Dudley and Kiniya.\n\nEvery Wednesday and Saturday shows are performed by the campers and staff. Wednesday nights are talent shows, and Saturday nights are scripted plays. Each division has its own extravaganza once a session, which is a themed day planned by the division's leaders.\n\nDudley:\n\n“D-U-D-L-E-Y / Whitewashed cookies, chicken pie / Pink music, pickeral fry / Westport, Westport my oh my / All ye campers stand in line (line)/ Take your hats off just like mine (mine) / Bevo, bivo, boom get a rat trap bigger than a cat trap, bevo, bivo, BOOM!\n\nKiniya:\n\n0-5446 / Morning dips, HEY!

Computerization has changed the way organizations are approaching their decision-making because it requires that they automate more decisions, to handle response times and unattended operation required by computerization, and because it has enabled \"information-based decisions\" – decisions based on analysis of historical behavioral data, prior decisions, and their outcomes.\n\nDecision management is described as an \"emerging important discipline, due to an increasing need to automate high-volume decisions across the enterprise and to impart precision, consistency, and agility in the decision-making process\". Decision management is implemented \"via the use of rule-based systems and analytic models for enabling high-volume, automated decision making\".\n\nOrganizations seek to improve the value created through each decision by deploying software solutions (generally developed using BRMS and predictive analytics technology) that better manage the tradeoffs between precision or accuracy, consistency, agility, speed or decision latency, and cost of decision-making within organizations. The concept of decision yield, for instance, focuses on all five key attributes of decision-making: more targeted decisions (precision); in the same way, over and over again (consistency); while being able to adapt \"on-the-fly\" (business agility) while reducing cost and improving speed, is an overall metric for how well an organization is making a particular decision.\n\nOrganizations are adopting decision management technology and approaches because they need a higher return from previous infrastructure investments, are dealing with increasing business decision complexity, face competitive pressure for more sophisticated decisions and because increasingly short windows of competitive advantage means that the speed of business is outpacing speed of information technology to react.\n\nOther terms used include \"intelligent process automation\" (where decision management is combined with business process management).\n\nThere are a number of different approaches used to apply decision management principles. In general these follow three steps:\nDecision management often involves the use of A/B testing and experimentation as well.\n"}

This was the second album created under the direction of producer Paul O'Neill and was initially released in December 1, 1989.\n\nThis album was a true turning point for the band, for after Jon Oliva watched Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical \"The Phantom of the Opera\" in Toronto, he decided to change the sound of the band, from a heavy metal to a more progressive sound, which is reflected in songs such as \"When the Crowds Are Gone\" and \"Gutter Ballet\". \"Gutter Ballet\" is not a concept album, but the final three songs (\"Mentally Yours\", \"Summer's Rain\", \"Thorazine Shuffle\") are a conceptual suite dealing with a single character as revealed by the band in interviews.\n\nThe original title for the record was \"Temptation Revelation\", but this was changed to \"Hounds of Zaroff\" which was a Steve Wacholz suggestion. As late as May 1989, the eventual title track of the album had not been written and the band was having doubts surrounding the album title. The title \"Gutter Ballet\" finally came from that of a play producer Paul O'Neill had written ten years earlier and which would later make-up the majority of the band's next work, \"\". The song \"Gutter Ballet\" was written with just O'Neill, Jon and Criss Oliva in the studio. Jon's drumming skill was competent enough to perform on the track and he also provided the bass guitar duties for the track. Had the band originally stuck with the story set-out in Paul O'Neill's original 1979 story, the song \"When the Crowds Are Gone\" would have followed \"Streets\" track \"A Little Too Far\".\n\nOn the original cassette and CD releases, \"Thorazine Shuffle\" was a bonus track.\n\nTwo videos from the album entered rotation on MTV, \"Gutter Ballet\" (filmed at the beginning of 1990 in New York) and \"When the Crowds Are Gone\". The former track became a staple of \"Headbangers Ball\" and as a result, both Jon Oliva and Chris Caffery were invited to join host Riki Rachtman for an interview in 1990.\n\nMany additional songs already written, before the decision of the change of style, were unused and subsequently published as bonus tracks, in the \"Sirens\" and \"The Dungeons Are Calling\" 2002 Silver reissues, some of them were also re-worked and published by Jon Oliva's Pain. Some titles were \"Before I Hang\", \"Metal Head\", \"Target\", \"Livin On The Edge Of Time\", \"Stranger In The Dark\" and \"Rap\". \n\nPaul O'Neill was planning a theatrical release under the Trans-Siberian Orchestra name, titled \"Gutter Ballet\", including Savatage's music from this album and from \"Streets: A Rock Opera\".\n\n\nNote: Chris Caffery doesn't play on the album but he was credited with guitars and keyboards and is pictured in the album's booklet \"both to prepare the fans for the line-up they'd see on tour and confirm his permanent member status\".\n\n\n"}

He was awarded both the International Master and International Grandmaster titles by FIDE in 1965. He won two Czechoslovak and three U.S. championships, and was ranked as the world's no. 10 player in 1974. He was inducted into the U.S. Chess Hall of Fame in 2001. Kavalek is also a chess coach, organizer, teacher, commentator, author and award-winning columnist.\n\nKavalek was born in Prague, Czechoslovakia (now the Czech Republic). He studied communication and journalism at Charles University. He won the championship of Czechoslovakia in 1962 and 1968. When Soviet tanks rolled into Prague in August 1968, Kavalek was playing in the Akiba Rubinstein Memorial in Poland, in which he finished second. Kavalek, who had always hated Communism, decided to defect to the West rather than return to Soviet-dominated Czechoslovakia. He bought several crates of vodka with his winnings, used them to bribe the border guards, and drove to West Germany. \"It was the biggest loss ever suffered by Czechoslovakian chess,\" wrote Andrew Soltis in \"The 100 Best Chess Games of the 20th Century, Ranked.\"\n\nIn 1970, on the way to the United States, Kavalek won a strong tournament in Caracas (scoring +10−1=6). He played the first half under the Czechoslovakian flag, the second half under the American flag. He represented the United States before officially setting foot in his new adopted country. Kavalek moved to Washington, D.C., studied Slavic literature at George Washington University and worked at Voice of America (1971–72). In 1973 he became a full-time chess professional. He later became a United States citizen. He lives in Reston, Virginia.\n\nKavalek played in four Czechoslovak championships. Three results were significant:\n\nKavalek finished first in three U.S. championships.\n\n\"During the 1970s Kavalek was one of the most active and successful tournament competitors from the USA.\"\n\nBesides sharing first place at the U.S. championship, Kavalek won four tournaments:\n\n\nHe also finished third in Amsterdam (Petrosian and Planinc 10, Kavalek 9.5, Spassky 9) and in Manila (Larsen 12.5/15, Ljubojevic 11.5, Kavalek 11).\n\nBecause of these results, Kavalek moved in 1974 to number 10 in the world on the official FIDE rating list with 2625 points. Also in 1974 he shared first place in Solingen (Kavalek, Polugaevsky 10/14, Spassky,Kurajica 8.5).\n\nKavalek finished third at the 1966 The Hague European Zonal (Gligorić 12.5/16, Bilek 12, Kavalek 11.5) and qualified for the 1967 Interzonal in Sousse, where he was one of the three players to draw with Bobby Fischer. In the Manila Interzonal in 1976, Kavalek finished seventh.\n\nKavalek also qualified for the 1979 and 1987 Interzonals, but never achieved a place in the Candidates Matches.\n\n\n\nIn 1979, Kavalek played in the double-round Man and his World Chess Challenge in Montreal, which he also organized. It was the most bizarre result of his career. He finished last in the first half with 1.5/9, but won the second half with 6.5/9. He ended tying for seventh place overall.\n\nKavalek played in nine Chess Olympiads, representing Czechoslovakia in 1964 and 1966 and the US from 1972 through 1986 except 1980. In his seven appearances on the US team he played top board three times and second board twice, and the team collected one gold and five bronze medals.\n\nFrom 1969 until 1991 Kavalek was a leading player for the German team in Solingen. During his tenure the team won 10 national championships in 1969, 1971,1972,1973,1974, 1975, 1980, 1981, 1987 and 1988 and the 1976 and 1990 European Club Championships.\nIn the 1977–79 European Club championship, Kavalek scored 5.5/6 on the top board, including two wins over V. Smyslov.\n\nIn the Nordic team vs. United States in Reykjavik in 1986, Kavalek on second board defeated Bent Larsen 1.5-0.5.\n\nIn the match Moscow vs. Prague in April 1968, Kavalek beat Evgeny Vasyukov 1.5-0.5.\n\nIn 1976, Kavalek was the top player on the Washington Plumbers team that won the National Chess League.\n\nKavalek won two international matches:\n\nKavalek lost two matches against two of the world's best players in Solingen, Germany. In 1970 he lost to Bent Larsen with a score 2-6 and in 1977 he was defeated by Boris Spassky 2–4.\n\nKavalek ranked among the top 100 players in the world continuously from the end of 1962 until September 1988, peaking at number 10 in 1974, when he achieved his peak Elo rating of 2625 on the FIDE Rating list. By Chessmetrics ratings, he achieved his peak ranking of number 18 in early 1974 with a Chessmetrics rating of 2695.\n\nKavalek had a notable coaching career, working with Mark Diesen, Robert Byrne, Yasser Seirawan, Eugene Torre and Robert Hübner. Kavalek was also one of Bobby Fischer's seconds in the World Chess Championship 1972 and served as British grandmaster Nigel Short's trainer in the 1990 Interzonal in Manila, and in Short's successful Candidates matches against British grandmaster Jonathan Speelman, Israeli grandmaster Boris Gelfand, former world champion Anatoly Karpov and Dutch grandmaster Jan Timman, leading up to Short's 1993 world championship match against Garry Kasparov. Short and Kavalek parted company shortly after the beginning of the latter match, which Kasparov won decisively. Short and Kavalek later wrote articles for chess magazines criticizing each other. Kavalek was acting captain and team analyst of the Rest of the World team against the Soviet Union in London in 1984.\n\n\nKavalek was selected to Gallery of Distinguished Chess Journalists in 2006 and won Chess Journalists of America awards for the best newspaper column.\nBetween 1960 and 2012 Kavalek's chess magazine articles have appeared in different print and online publications such as \"Chess Life & Review\" (1970–1979) and \"British Chess Magazine\" (1994–2010).\nHe was editor-in-chief of chess publishing for RHM Press in New York from 1973 to 1986. He was the chess columnist for \"The Washington Post\" from 1986 to 2010, his last column running on January 4, 2010. In May 2010 he became the chess columnist for \"The Huffington Post\".\nHe was a member of the jury to select the best and most important games in \"Chess Informant\" (1989–1993).\n\n\nKavalek's three most important prizes: \n\nHere is a victory by the young Kavalek against Soviet grandmaster Eduard Gufeld. According to Larry Evans, Gufeld's soccer team had beaten Kavalek's the day before, and Kavalek vowed to get revenge:\n\nGufeld–Kavalek, Student Olympiad, Mariánské Lázně 1962 \n1. e4 e5 2.

Roth Jr. Bridge (originally the Chesapeake & Delaware Canal Bridge and also referred to as the Roth Bridge) is a concrete and steel cable-stayed bridge that spans the Chesapeake & Delaware Canal near St. Georges, Delaware. The bridge is located near a tolled section of Delaware Route 1 that runs parallel to the St. Georges Bridge carrying U.S. Route 13. In November 2006, the bridge was named after U.S. Senator William V. Roth, Jr., who not only lent his name to the Roth IRA, but was instrumental in securing federal funding to build the bridge. It is owned and operated by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and does not carry a toll, despite the location of a nearby toll plaza.\n\nPlans for a new bridge began in the 1980s when former Governor Michael N. Castle investigated a new canal crossing to replace the aging St. Georges Bridge. The bridge plans later became incorporated into the \"Relief Route\" plans for an upgraded US 13 as a toll freeway, as the narrower surface roads were over-capacity with north-south traffic. The project took about a decade to overcome various political and social obstacles, and construction began in 1992 on the new freeway and bridge. The freeway north of the bridge from Tybouts Corner to Christiana, was originally designated as a southward extension of Delaware Route 7. It was redesignated as a northward extension of Delaware Route 1 once the bridge was completed on December 9, 1995, concurrent with the opening of the Relief Route freeway from Tybouts Corner to Biddles Corner.\n\nAfter its opening in 1995, the Corps of Engineers rerouted US 13 onto the new bridge. The old St. Georges Bridge was scheduled to be demolished, however local opposition saved the bridge and it was rehabilitated with new lead-free paint, new roadway deck, and several joint and structural repairs that allows heavier vehicles to use it. After the multi-year rehabilitation project, which lasted from 1998-2001, US 13 was returned to the St. Georges Bridge. Though the entire Relief Route was planned as a toll road, it was later agreed to install the tollbooths past the US 13 exit south of the canal, so as to keep both crossings toll free.\n\nIn December 2018, US 13 was temporarily detoured over the Roth Bridge when the St. Georges Bridge was closed for repairs. The repairs are expected to be complete within four months of closing, for a March 2019 reopening.\n\nThe Senator William V. Roth Jr. Bridge, the first cable-stayed bridge of its type in the Delaware Valley area (all previous Delaware River or C & D Canal bridges are either suspension, cantilever, or simple truss designs), is also the first pre-cast concrete bridge to be built in the United States. Modeled after that of the Sunshine Skyway Bridge in St. Petersburg, Florida, the bridge incorporates many features not found on the other canal bridges:\n\n\nThe bridge also incorporates a 3% climbing grade, a feature lacked on the nearby St. Georges Bridge. The bridge, built between 1991 and 1994, utilized pre-cast concrete segments that were made in Cape Charles, Virginia, and transported by barge until it reached the job site. Once at the site, the segments were fitted into place like that of a jigsaw puzzle.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2144362", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2144362", "title": "Voice user interface", "text": "Voice user interface\n\nA voice-user interface (VUI) makes spoken human interaction with computers possible, using speech recognition to understand spoken commands and answer questions, and typically text to speech to play a reply. A voice command device (VCD) is a device controlled with a voice user interface.\n\nVoice user interfaces have been added to automobiles, home automation systems, computer operating systems, home appliances like washing machines and microwave ovens, and television remote controls. They are the primary way of interacting with virtual assistants on smartphones and smart speakers. Older automated attendants (which route phone calls to the correct extension) and interactive voice response systems (which conduct more complicated transactions over the phone) can respond to the pressing of keypad buttons via DTMF tones, but those with a full voice user interface allow callers to speak requests and responses without having to press any buttons.\n\nNewer VCDs are speaker-independent, so they can respond to multiple voices, regardless of accent or dialectal influences. They are also capable of responding to several commands at once, separating vocal messages, and providing appropriate feedback, accurately imitating a natural conversation.\n\nA VUI is the interface to any speech application. Controlling a machine by simply talking to it was science fiction only a short time ago. Until recently, this area was considered to be artificial intelligence. However, advances in technologies like text-to-speech, speech-to-text, Natural Language Processing, and cloud services, in general, contributed to the mass adoption of these types of interfaces. VUIs have become more commonplace, and people are taking advantage of the value that these hands-free, eyes-free interfaces provided in many situations.\n\nVUIs need to respond to input reliably, or they will be rejected and often ridiculed by their users. Designing a good VUI requires interdisciplinary talents of computer science, linguistics and human factors psychology – all of which are skills that are expensive and hard to come by. Even with advanced development tools, constructing an effective VUI requires an in-depth understanding of both the tasks to be performed, as well as the target audience that will use the final system. The closer the VUI matches the user's mental model of the task, the easier it will be to use with little or no training, resulting in both higher efficiency and higher user satisfaction.\n\nA VUI designed for the general public should emphasize ease of use and provide a lot of help and guidance for first-time callers. In contrast, a VUI designed for a small group of power users (including field service workers), should focus more on productivity and less on help and guidance. Such applications should streamline the call flows, minimize prompts, eliminate unnecessary iterations and allow elaborate \"mixed initiative dialogs\", which enable callers to enter several pieces of information in a single utterance and in any order or combination. In short, speech applications have to be carefully crafted for the specific business process that is being automated.\n\nNot all business processes render themselves equally well for speech automation. In general, the more complex the inquiries and transactions are, the more challenging they will be to automate, and the more likely they will be to fail with the general public. In some scenarios, automation is simply not applicable, so live agent assistance is the only option. A legal advice hotline, for example, would be very difficult to automate. On the flip side, speech is perfect for handling quick and routine transactions, like changing the status of a work order, completing a time or expense entry, or transferring funds between accounts.\n\nEarly applications for VUI included voice-activated dialing of phones, either directly or through a (typically Bluetooth) headset or vehicle audio system.\n\nIn 2007, a CNN business article reported that voice command was over a billion dollar industry and that companies like Google and Apple were trying to create speech recognition features. It has been years since the article was published, and since then the world has witnessed a variety of voice command devices. In addition, Google created a speech recognition engine called Pico TTS and Apple has released Siri. Voice command devices are becoming more widely available, and innovative ways for using the human voice are always being created. For example, Business Week suggests that the future remote controller is going to be the human voice. Currently Xbox Live allows such features and Jobs hinted at such a feature on the new Apple TV.\n\nBoth Apple Mac and Windows PC provide built in speech recognition features for their latest operating systems.\n\nTwo Microsoft operating systems, Windows 7 and Windows Vista, provide speech recognition capabilities. Microsoft integrated voice commands into their operating systems to provide a mechanism for people who want to limit their use of the mouse and keyboard, but still want to maintain or increase their overall productivity.\n\nWith Windows Vista voice control, a user may dictate documents and emails in mainstream applications, start and switch between applications, control the operating system, format documents, save documents, edit files, efficiently correct errors, and fill out forms on the Web. The speech recognition software learns automatically every time a user uses it, and speech recognition is available in English (U.S.), English (U.K.), German (Germany), French (France), Spanish (Spain), Japanese, Chinese (Traditional), and Chinese (Simplified). In addition, the software comes with an interactive tutorial, which can be used to train both the user and the speech recognition engine.\n\nIn addition to all the features provided in Windows Vista, Windows 7 provides a wizard for setting up the microphone and a tutorial on how to use the feature.\n\nAll Mac OS X computers come pre-installed with the speech recognition software. The software is user-independent, and it allows for a user to, \"navigate menus and enter keyboard shortcuts; speak checkbox names, radio button names, list items, and button names; and open, close, control, and switch among applications.\" However, the Apple website recommends a user buy a commercial product called Dictate.\n\nIf a user is not satisfied with the built in speech recognition software or a user does not have a built speech recognition software for their OS, then a user may experiment with a commercial product such as Braina Pro or DragonNaturallySpeaking for Windows PCs,\nand Dictate, the name of the same software for Mac OS.\n\nAny mobile device running Android OS, Microsoft Windows Phone, iOS 9 or later, or Blackberry OS provides voice command capabilities. In addition to the built speech recognition software for each mobile phone's operating system, a user may download third party voice command applications from each operating system's application store: Apple App store, Google Play, Windows Phone Marketplace (initially Windows Marketplace for Mobile), or BlackBerry App World.\n\nGoogle has developed an open source operating system called Android, which allows a user to perform voice commands such as: send text messages, listen to music, get directions, call businesses, call contacts, send email, view a map, go to websites, write a note, and search Google.\nThe speech recognition software is available for all devices since Android 2.2 \"Froyo\", but the settings must be set to English. Google allows for the user to change the language, and the user is prompted when he or she first uses the speech recognition feature if he or she would like their voice data to be attached to their Google account. If a user decides to opt into this service, it allows Google to train the software to the user's voice.\n\nGoogle introduced the Google Assistant with Android 7.0 \"Nougat\". It is much more advanced than the older version.\n\nAmazon.com has the Echo that uses Amazon's custom version of Android to provide a voice interface.\n\nWindows Phone is Microsoft's mobile device's operating system. On Windows Phone 7.5, the speech app is user independent and can be used to: call someone from your contact list, call any phone number, redial the last number, send a text message, call your voice mail, open an application, read appointments, query phone status, and search the web.\nIn addition, speech can also be used during a phone call, and the following actions are possible during a phone call: press a number, turn the speaker phone on, or call someone, which puts the current call on hold.\n\nWindows 10 introduces Cortana, a voice control system that replaces the formerly used voice control on Windows phones.\n\nApple added Voice Control to its family of iOS devices as a new feature of iPhone OS 3. The iPhone 4S, iPad 3, iPad Mini 1G, iPad Air, iPad Pro 1G, iPod Touch 5G and later, all come with a more advanced voice assistant called Siri. Voice Control can still be enabled through the Settings menu of newer devices. Siri is a user independent built-in speech recognition feature that allows a user to issue voice commands. With the assistance of Siri a user may issue commands like, send a text message, check the weather, set a reminder, find information, schedule meetings, send an email, find a contact, set an alarm, get directions, track your stocks, set a timer, and ask for examples of sample voice command queries. In addition, Siri works with Bluetooth and wired headphones.\n\nIn 2014 Amazon introduced the Alexa smart home device. Its main purpose was just a smart speaker, that allowed the consumer to control the device with their voice. Eventually, it turned into a novelty device that had the ability to control home appliance with voice. Now almost all the appliances are controllable with Alexa, including light bulbs and temperature. By allowing voice control Alexa can connect to smart home technology allowing you to lock your house, control the temperature, and activate various devices. This form of A.I allows for someone to simply ask it a question, and in response the Alexa searches for, finds, and recites the answer back to you.\n\nAs car technology improves, more features will be added to cars and these features will most likely distract a driver. Voice commands for cars, according to CNET, should allow a driver to issue commands and not be distracted. CNET stated that Nuance was suggesting that in the future they would create a software that resembled Siri, but for cars. Most speech recognition software on the market in 2011 had only about 50 to 60 voice commands, but Ford Sync had 10,000. However, CNET suggested that even 10,000 voice commands was not sufficient given the complexity and the variety of tasks a user may want to do while driving. Voice command for cars is different from voice command for mobile phones and for computers because a driver may use the feature to look for nearby restaurants, look for gas, driving directions, road conditions, and the location of the nearest hotel. Currently, technology allows a driver to issue voice commands on both a portable GPS like a Garmin and a car manufacturer navigation system.\n\nList of Voice Command Systems Provided By Motor Manufacturers:\n\nWhile most voice user interfaces are designed to support interaction through spoken human language, there have also been recent explorations in designing interfaces take non-verbal human sounds as input. In these systems, the user controls the interface by emitting non-speech sounds such as humming, whistling, or blowing into a microphone.\n\nOne such example of a non-verbal voice user interface is Blendie, an interactive art installation created by Kelly Dobson. The piece comprised a classic 1950s-era blender which was retrofitted to respond to microphone input. To control the blender, the user must mimic the whirring mechanical sounds that a blender typically makes: the blender will spin slowly in response to a user’s low-pitched growl, and increase in speed as the user makes higher-pitched vocal sounds.\n\nAnother example is VoiceDraw, a research system that enables digital drawing for individuals with limited motor abilities. VoiceDraw allows users to “paint” strokes on a digital canvas by modulating vowel sounds, which are mapped to brush directions. Modulating other paralinguistic features (e.g. the loudness of their voice) allows the user to control different features of the drawing, such as the thickness of the brush stroke.\n\nOther approaches include adopting non-verbal sounds to augment touch-based interfaces (e.g. on a mobile phone) to support new types of gestures that wouldn’t be possible with finger input alone.\n\nVoice interfaces pose a substantial number of challenges for usability. In contrast to graphical user interfaces (GUIs), best practices for voice interface design are still emergent.\n\nWith purely audio-based interaction, voice user interfaces tend to suffer from low discoverability: it is difficult for users to understand the scope of a system’s capabilities. In order for the system to convey what is possible without a visual display, it would need to enumerate the available options, which can become tedious or infeasible. Low discoverability often results in users reporting confusion over what they are “allowed” to say, or a mismatch in expectations about the breadth of a system’s understanding.\n\nWhile speech recognition technology has improved considerably in recent years, voice user interfaces still suffer from parsing or transcription errors in which a user’s speech is not interpreted correctly. These errors tend to be especially prevalent when the speech content uses technical vocabulary (e.g. medical terminology) or unconventional spellings such as musical artist or song names.\n\nEffective system design to maximize conversational understanding remains an open area of research. Voice user interfaces that interpret and manage conversational state are challenging to design due to the inherent difficulty of integrating complex natural language processing tasks like coreference resolution, named-entity recognition, information retrieval, and dialog management. Most voice assistants today are capable of executing single commands very well but limited in their ability to manage dialogue beyond a narrow task or a couple turns in a conversation.\n\nPocket-size devices, such as PDAs or mobile phones, currently rely on small buttons for user input. These are either built into the device or are part of a touch-screen interface, such as that of the Apple iPod Touch and iPhone Siri Application. Extensive button-pressing on devices with such small buttons can be tedious and inaccurate, so an easy-to-use, accurate, and reliable VUI would potentially be a major breakthrough in the ease of their use. Nonetheless, such a VUI would also benefit users of laptop- and desktop-sized computers, as well, as it would solve numerous problems currently associated with keyboard and mouse use, including repetitive-strain injuries such as carpal tunnel syndrome and slow typing speed on the part of inexperienced keyboard users. Moreover, keyboard use typically entails either sitting or standing stationary in front of the connected display; by contrast, a VUI would free the user to be far more mobile, as speech input eliminates the need to look at a keyboard.\n\nSuch developments could literally change the face of current machines and have far-reaching implications on how users interact with them. Hand-held devices would be designed with larger, easier-to-view screens, as no keyboard would be required. Touch-screen devices would no longer need to split the display between content and an on-screen keyboard, thus providing full-screen viewing of the content. Laptop computers could essentially be cut in half in terms of size, as the keyboard half would be eliminated and all internal components would be integrated behind the display, effectively resulting in a simple tablet computer. Desktop computers would consist of a CPU and screen, saving desktop space otherwise occupied by the keyboard and eliminating sliding keyboard rests built under the desk's surface. Television remote controls and keypads on dozens of other devices, from microwave ovens to photocopiers, could also be eliminated.\n\nNumerous challenges would have to be overcome, however, for such developments to occur. First, the VUI would have to be sophisticated enough to distinguish between input, such as commands, and background conversation; otherwise, false input would be registered and the connected device would behave erratically. A standard prompt, such as the famous \"Computer!\" call by characters in science fiction TV shows and films such as \"Star Trek\", could activate the VUI and prepare it to receive further input by the same speaker. Conceivably, the VUI could also include a human-like representation: a voice or even an on-screen character, for instance, that responds back (e.g., \"Yes, Vamshi?\") and continues to communicate back and forth with the user in order to clarify the input received and ensure accuracy.\n\nSecond, the VUI would have to work in concert with highly sophisticated software in order to accurately process and find/retrieve information or carry out an action as per the particular user's preferences. For instance, if Samantha prefers information from a particular newspaper, and if she prefers that the information be summarized in point-form, she might say, \"Computer, find me some information about the flooding in southern China last night\"; in response, the VUI that is familiar with her preferences would \"find\" facts about \"flooding\" in \"southern China\" from that source, convert it into point-form, and deliver it to her on screen and/or in voice form, complete with a citation. Therefore, accurate speech-recognition software, along with some degree of artificial intelligence on the part of the machine associated with the VUI, would be required.\n\nPrivacy concerns are raised by the fact that voice commands are available to the providers of voice-user interfaces in unencrypted form, and can thus be shared with third parties and be processed in an unauthorized or unexpected manner. Additionally to the linguistic content of recorded speech, a user’s manner of expression and voice characteristics can implicitly contain information about his or her biometric identity, personality traits, body shape, physical and mental health condition, sex, gender, moods and emotions, socioeconomic status and geographical origin.\n\n\n"}

He was the son of the founder of Motorola, Paul Galvin, and served as the CEO of Motorola from 1959 to 1986.\n\nBorn in Marshfield, Wisconsin, Galvin went to work for Motorola in 1940. He graduated from the University of Notre Dame in 1944. In 1956 he was named the president of the company. Two years later he succeeded his father as a chief executive officer.\n\nIn 1986, Bob Galvin gave up the title of CEO while remaining chairman of the board. Under his leadership, Motorola sales had grown from $216.6 million in 1958 to $6.7 billion in 1987 and cash flow per share had grown from 89 cents to $6.10. Bob Galvin also was instrumental, along with Dr. Mikel J Harry and Motorola engineer Bill Smith, in implementing the Six Sigma quality system at Motorola.\n\nAs a result of the Six Sigma program, Motorola received the first Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award in 1988, which is given by the President of the United States. Later, the Six Sigma processes subsequently were adopted at the General Electric Corporation. Jack Welch said: \"Six Sigma changed the DNA of GE.\" The Six Sigma process requires 99.99967% error free processes and products, (or 3.4 parts per million defects or less).\n\nIn 2005, Galvin created the Galvin Electricity Initiative, a nonprofit organization dedicated to transforming the electrical grid so that it meets with Six Sigma standards of quality.\n\nAlong with his two sons Christopher and Michael, Galvin recently started a real estate investment firm, Harrison Street Real Estate Capital, named for the street where his father and uncle started Motorola (originally named \"Galvin Manufacturing\").\n\nGalvin was a longtime supporter of Illinois Institute of Technology and became a trustee in 1953. He served as chairman from 1979 to 1990 and sat on three steering bodies on the future of IIT, in 1975, 1985, and as chairman in 1993. At the time of his death, he served as a University Regent. In 1990, IIT presented Galvin with an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters degree, and in 1996, he received the university's Henry Heald Award. IIT dedicated the Paul V. Galvin Library in 1985 to recognize the Galvin family's commitment to the institution.\n\nIn 1991, Galvin was inducted into Junior Achievement's U.S. Business Hall of Fame. In 1993, he received the Bower Award in Business Leadership. In 2000 he was awarded the IEEE Founder's Medal for \"For his distinguished leadership in promoting quality, technological excellence and' cooperation between government and the private sector, and expanding the applications of electronics and communications technology globally.\" In 2005, he was awarded the Vannevar Bush Award for \"his visionary leadership to enhance U.S. innovation, competitiveness, and excellence at the interface of science and technology with the Nation's industrial enterprise. In the counsels of government, industry, and academe, he unselfishly gave the Nation the benefit of his knowledge, experience, and creative wisdom while leading his company in its great contribution to the computing and telecommunications transformation of society.\"\nIn 1995, he received the Chicago History Museum \"Making History Award\" for Distinction in Civic Leadership.\n\nGalvin lived in Barrington, Illinois with his wife, Mary Barnes Galvin.

{"id": "2144400", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2144400", "title": "RMS Titanic conspiracy theories", "text": "RMS Titanic conspiracy theories\n\nThe sinking of the RMS \"Titanic\" in 1912 shocked the world, and attracted so much controversy that a number of conspiracy theories have been put forward regarding the disaster.\n\nOne such theory is that the sunken ship was actually the \"Titanic\"s near-identical sister-ship \"Olympic\", which was the subject of a large insurance claim, and that the two vessels were secretly switched prior to the voyage. Another is that the \"Titanic\"s owner, J.P. Morgan, wanted to eliminate several prominent bankers who were opposing his plan for the creation of a U.S. central bank.\n\nThe \"Titanic\" struck an iceberg, damaging the hull's plates in her starboard side causing her front compartments to flood below the water line. The ship then sank, causing about 1500 fatalities.\n\nIn 2003, Captain L. M. Collins, a former member of the Ice Pilotage Service, published \"The Sinking of the Titanic: The Mystery Solved,\" proposing, based upon his own experience of ice navigation and witness statements given at the two post-disaster enquiries, that what the \"Titanic\" hit was not an iceberg but low-lying pack ice. He based his conclusion upon three main pieces of evidence.\n\n\nOne of the most controversial and elaborate theories was forwarded by Robin Gardiner in his book, \"Titanic: The Ship That Never Sank?\" Gardiner draws on several events and coincidences that occurred in the months, days, and hours leading up to the sinking of the \"Titanic\", and concludes that the ship that sank was in fact \"Titanic\"s sister ship , disguised as \"Titanic\", as an insurance scam by her owners, the International Mercantile Marine Group, controlled by American financier J.P. Morgan that had acquired the White Star Line in 1902.\n\n\"Olympic\" was the slightly older sister of \"Titanic\", built alongside the more famous vessel but launched in October 1910. Her exterior profile was nearly identical to \"Titanic\", save for minor details such as the number of portholes on the forward C decks of the ships, the spacing of the windows on the B decks, and the forward section of the A deck promenade on \"Titanic\" that had been enclosed only a few weeks before she set sail on her ill-fated maiden voyage. Both ships were built with linoleum floors, but shortly before she was due to set sail J. Bruce Ismay, managing director of the White Star Line, inexplicably ordered the floors aboard \"Titanic\" carpeted over.\n\nOn 20 September 1911, the \"Olympic\" was involved in a collision with the Royal Navy Warship in the Brambles Channel in Southampton Water while under the command of a harbour pilot. The two ships were close enough to each other that \"Olympic\" motion drew the \"Hawke\" into her aft starboard side, causing extensive damage to the liner – both above and below her waterline (\"HMS Hawke\" was fitted with a reinforced 'ram' below the waterline, purposely designed to cause maximum damage to enemy ships). An Admiralty inquiry assigned blame to the \"Olympic\", despite numerous eyewitness accounts to the contrary.\n\nGardiner's theory plays out in this historical context. \"Olympic\" was found to be at blame in the collision (which, according to Gardiner, had damaged the central turbine's mountings and bent the keel, giving the ship a slight permanent list to port). Because of this finding, White Star's insurers Lloyd's of London allegedly refused to pay out on the claim. White Star's flagship would also be out of action during the extensive repairs, and the \"Titanic\"s completion date, which was already behind schedule due to \"Olympic\"s return to the yard after her loss of a propeller blade, would have to be delayed. All this would amount to a serious financial loss for the company. Gardiner proposes that, to make sure at least one vessel would be earning money, the badly damaged \"Olympic\" was patched up and then converted to become the \"Titanic\". The real \"Titanic\" when complete would then quietly enter service as the \"Olympic\".\n\nThe \"Titanic\" indeed had a list to port leaving Southampton. Inadequate trimming of cargo and bunkers would likely result in such and the crew seems to have demonstrated a lack of proficiency on several occasions. A list to port was noted by several \"Titanic\" survivors including Lawrence Beesley who wrote in his book about the sinking: \"I then called the attention of our table to the way the \"Titanic\" listed to port (I had noticed this before), and we watched the skyline through the portholes as we sat at the purser's table in the saloon.\" (The dining saloon windows were double rows of portholes covered on the inside with screens of leaded decorative glass with no clear view of the outdoors.) This was echoed by survivor Norman Chambers, who testified that after the collision: \"However, there was then a slight list to starboard, with probably a few degrees in pitch; and as the ship had a list to port nearly all afternoon, I decided to remain up.\"\n\nGardiner states that few parts of either ship bore the name, other than the easily removed lifeboats, bell, compass binnacle, and name plates. Everything else was standard White Star issue and was interchangeable between the two ships, and other vessels in the White Star fleet. While all other White Star Line Ships had their names engraved into their hulls, the \"Titanic\" alone had her name riveted over the top.\n\nThe \"Olympic\" had allegedly been damaged beyond economic repair. Gardiner suggests that the plan was to dispose of the \"Olympic\" in a way that would allow White Star to collect the full insured value of a brand new ship. He supposes that the seacocks were to be opened at sea to slowly flood the ship. If numerous ships were stationed nearby to take off the passengers, the shortage of lifeboats would not matter as the ship would sink slowly and the boats could make several trips to the rescuers.\n\nGardiner points to the length of \"Titanic\"s sea trials as evidence. \"Olympic\"s trials in 1911 took two days, including several high speed runs, but \"Titanic\"s trials reportedly only lasted for one day, with (Gardiner alleges) no working over half-speed. Gardiner says this was because the patched-up hull could not take any long periods of high speed. Perhaps this was due to the fact that \"Titanic\" as a nearly identical twin sister of the \"Olympic\" was expected to handle exactly the same, or perhaps the Board of Trade inspectors were in on the scheme.\n\nGardiner maintains that on 14 April, First Officer Murdoch (who was not officially on duty yet) was on the bridge because he was one of the few high-ranking officers other than Captain Smith who knew of the plan and was keeping a watch out for the rescue ships. One of Gardiner's most controversial statements is that the \"Titanic\" did not strike an iceberg, but an IMM rescue ship that was drifting on station with its lights out. Gardiner based this hypothesis on the idea that the supposed iceberg was seen at such a short distance by the lookouts on the \"Titanic\" because it was actually a darkened ship, and he also does not believe an iceberg could inflict such sustained and serious damage to a steel double-hulled vessel such as the \"Titanic\".\n\nGardiner further hypothesises that the ship that was hit by the \"Titanic\" was the one seen by the SS \"Californian\" firing distress rockets, and that this explains the perceived inaction of the \"Californian\" (which traditionally is seen as failing to come to the rescue of the \"Titanic\" after sighting its distress rockets). Gardiner's hypothesis is that the \"Californian\", another IMM ship, was not expecting rockets but a rendezvous. The ice on the deck of the \"Titanic\" is explained by Gardiner as ice from the rigging of both the \"Titanic\" and the mystery ship she hit. As for the true \"Titanic\", Gardiner alleges that she spent 25 years in service as the \"Olympic\" and was scrapped in 1935.\n\nResearchers Bruce Beveridge and Steve Hall took issue with many of Gardiner's claims in their book, \"Olympic and Titanic: The Truth Behind the Conspiracy\". Author Mark Chirnside has also raised serious questions about the switch theory.\n\nSome theorists believe that the \"Titanic\" was sunk on purpose to eliminate opposition to the creation of the Federal Reserve Bank. Some of the wealthiest men in the world were aboard the \"Titanic\" for her maiden voyage, several of whom, including John Jacob Astor IV, Benjamin Guggenheim, and Isidor Straus, were allegedly opposed to the creation of a U.S. central bank. All three men died during the sinking. Conspiracy theorists suggest that J.P. Morgan, the legendary 74-year-old financier who set up the investment banking firm that still bears his name, arranged to have the men board the ship and then sink her to eliminate them. Morgan, nicknamed the \"Napoleon of Wall Street\", had helped create General Electric, U.S. Steel, and International Harvester, and was credited with almost single-handedly saving the U.S. banking system during the Panic of 1907. Morgan did have a hand in the creation of the Federal Reserve, and owned the International Mercantile Marine, which owned the White Star Line, and thus the \"Titanic\".\n\nMorgan, who had attended the \"Titanic\" launching in 1911, had a personal suite aboard the ship with his own private promenade deck and a bath equipped with specially designed cigar holders. He was reportedly booked on the ship's maiden voyage but instead canceled the trip and remained at the French resort of Aix-les-Bains to enjoy his morning massages and sulfur baths. His last-minute cancellation has fuelled speculation among conspiracy theorists that he knew her fate.\n\nAnother theory involves \"Titanic\"s watertight doors. This theory suggests that if these doors had been opened, the \"Titanic\" would have settled on an even keel and therefore, perhaps, remained afloat long enough for rescue ships to arrive. However, this theory appears to be far from reality for two reasons: first, there were no watertight doors between any of the first four compartments, thus it was impossible to lower the concentration of water in the bow significantly. Second, Bedford and Hacket have shown by calculations that any significant amount of water aft of boiler room No. 4 would have resulted in capsizing of the \"Titanic\", which would have occurred about 30 minutes earlier than the actual time of sinking. Additionally, the lighting would have been lost about 70 minutes after the collision due to the flooding of the boiler rooms. Bedford and Hacket also analysed the hypothetical case that there were no bulkheads at all. Then, the vessel would have capsized about 70 minutes before the actual time of sinking and lighting would have been lost about 40 minutes after the collision. \n\nLater, in a 1998 documentary titled \"Titanic: Secrets Revealed\", the Discovery Channel ran model simulations which also rebutted this theory. The simulations indicated that opening \"Titanic\"s watertight doors would have caused the ship to capsize earlier than she actually sank by more than one half hour, confirming the findings of Bedford and Hacket.\n\n\"Titanic\" researchers continued to debate the causes and mechanics of the ships breakup. According to his book, \"A Night to Remember\", Walter Lord described \"Titanic\" as assuming an \"absolutely perpendicular\" position shortly before its final plunge. This view remained largely unchallenged even after the wreck's discovery by Robert Ballard in 1985 confirmed that \"Titanic\" had broken in two pieces at or near the surface; paintings by noted marine artist Ken Marschall and in James Cameron's film \"Titanic\", both of which depicted the ship attaining a steep angle prior to the breakup. Most researchers acknowledged that \"Titanic\"s after expansion joint—designed to allow for flexing of the hull in a seaway—played little to no role in the ship's breakup, though debate continued as to whether the ship had broken from the top downwards or from the bottom upwards.\nIn 2005, a History Channel expedition to the wreck site scrutinised two large sections of \"Titanic\"s keel, which constituted the portion of the ship's bottom from immediately below the site of the break. With assistance from naval architect Roger Long, the team analysed the wreckage and developed a new break-up scenario which was publicised in the television documentary \"Titanic's Final Moments: Missing Pieces\" in 2006. One hallmark of this new theory was the claim that \"Titanic\"s angle at the time of the breakup was far less than had been commonly assumed—according to Long, no greater than 11°.\nLong also suspected that \"Titanic\"s breakup may have begun with the premature failure of the ship's after expansion joint, and ultimately exacerbated the loss of life by causing \"Titanic\" to sink faster than anticipated. In 2006, the History Channel sponsored dives on \"Titanic\"s younger sister ship, , which verified that the design of \"Britannic\"s expansion joints was superior to that incorporated in the \"Titanic\". To further explore Long's theory, the History Channel commissioned a new computer simulation by JMS Engineering. The simulation, whose results were featured in the 2007 documentary \"Titanic's Achilles Heel\", partially refuted Long's suspicions by demonstrating that \"Titanic\"s expansion joints were strong enough to deal with any and all stresses the ship could reasonably be expected to encounter in service and, during the sinking, actually outperformed their design specifications. But, most important is that the expansion joints were part of the superstructure, which was situated above the strength deck (B-deck) and therefore above the top of the structural hull girder. Thus, the expansion joints had no meaning for the support of the hull. They played no role in the breaking of the hull. They simply opened up and parted as the hull flexed or broke beneath them.\n\nBrad Matsen's 2008 book \"Titanic's Last Secrets\" endorses the expansion joint theory.\n\nOne common oversight is the fact that the collapse of the first funnel at a relatively shallow angle occurred when the forward expansion joint, over which several funnel stays crossed, opened as the hull was beginning to stress. The opening of the joint stretched and snapped the stays. The forward momentum of the ship as she took a sudden lurch forwards and downwards sent the unsupported funnel toppling onto the starboard bridge wing.\n\nOne theory that would support the fracturing of the hull is that the \"Titanic\" partly grounded on the shelf of ice below the waterline as she collided with the iceberg, perhaps damaging the keel and underbelly. Later during the sinking, it was noticed that Boiler Room #4 flooded from below the floor grates rather than from over the top of the watertight bulkhead. This would be consistent with additional damage along the keel compromising the integrity of the hull.\n\nA fire began in one of \"Titanic\" coal bunkers approximately 10 days prior to the ship's departure, and continued to burn for several days into her voyage. Fires occurred frequently on board steamships due to spontaneous combustion of the coal. The fires had to be extinguished with fire hoses, by moving the coal on top to another bunker and by removing the burning coal and feeding it into the furnace. This event has led some authors to theorise that the fire exacerbated the effects of the iceberg collision, by reducing the structural integrity of the hull and a critical bulkhead. \n\nIn 2011 David J H Smith put forward this idea in his book \"The Titanic's Mummy\" which looked at the event in a docudrama style. It was stated that the bunker fire was at the heart of the eventual disaster claiming that decisions made because of the blaze led it to a collision course with the iceberg. The book also looks at the fire's physical effect on the ship which claims it weakened the area of impact.\n\nSenan Molony has suggested that attempts to extinguish the fire – by shovelling burning coals into the engine furnaces – may have been the primary reason for the \"Titanic\" steaming at full speed prior to the collision, despite ice warnings. Most experts disagree. Samuel Halpern has concluded that \"the bunker fire would not have weakened the watertight bulkhead sufficiently to cause it to collapse.\" Also, it has been suggested that the coal bunker fire actually helped \"Titanic\" to last longer during the sinking and prevented the ship from rolling over to starboard after the impact, due to the subtle port list created by the moving of coal inside the ship prior to the encounter with the iceberg. Some of these foremost \"Titanic\" experts have published a detailed rebuttal of Molony's claims.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2144408", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2144408", "title": "Backyard Brawl", "text": "Backyard Brawl\n\nThe Backyard Brawl is an American college football rivalry between the University of Pittsburgh Panthers and West Virginia University Mountaineers. The term \"Backyard Brawl\" has also been used to refer to college basketball games played annually or semi-annually and may also be used to refer to other athletic competitions between the two schools. It is a registered trademark for both universities, and refers to the close proximity of the two universities, separated by 75 miles (105 km) along Interstate 79.\n\nThe football rivalry is the 14th oldest in the United States and is typically shown on national television. In the past, the Backyard Brawl has been seen on ABC, CBS, ESPN, and ESPN2. Through the 104 games played between these two schools, Pitt leads the series 61–40–3.\n\nThe football series was first played in 1895, and the game has historically been one of the more intense rivalries in the eastern United States. The rivalry between the two schools is due mainly to proximity. WVU's campus in Morgantown, West Virginia is only about 70 miles south of Pittsburgh (via Interstate 79), and the two schools often compete for the same recruits.\n\nThe 1921 edition of the Backyard Brawl was the first college football game broadcast on the radio when Harold W. Arlin announced the 21–13 Pittsburgh victory on KDKA.\n\nFrom 1962–2011, the series alternated between Pittsburgh and Morgantown on a yearly basis. Before that, the games were held in Pittsburgh on an almost regular basis, with Morgantown occasionally hosting the game. At one point, Pittsburgh hosted the game 11 years in a row (1919–29) and also hosted eight straight contests between 1938–48. (There were no matchups from 1940–42.) In contrast, the most consecutive games West Virginia has hosted were four in a row from 1895–1901, with one of those games held in Fairmont, West Virginia, now the home to Fairmont State University, and one in Wheeling, West Virginia. The most consecutive games played in Morgantown, three, were held from 1932–34.\n\nWest Virginia started out the series leading, 5–1. Pittsburgh won four games in a row from 1904–08 (there was no game played in 1905) to tie the series at 5–5. In 1909, the teams played to a 0–0 tie, making the series 5–5–1. The following year, Pittsburgh won 38–0, taking a 6–5–1 lead in the series, and has led ever since. Since the series began interchanging annually between Morgantown and Pittsburgh in 1963, the Mountaineers have held a 25–22–2 advantage over the Panthers.\n\nOn November 25, 2004, the Backyard Brawl series saw its 97th game, surpassing the 96–game Penn State–Pittsburgh football rivalry as Pittsburgh's most–played rivalry game. Pittsburgh celebrated the event with a 16–13 win at Heinz Field.\n\nOn December 1, 2007, the 100th Backyard Brawl took place. Pittsburgh upset WVU by a score of 13–9. Coming into the game, WVU was ranked first in the Coaches' Poll and second in both the BCS and AP Poll. With the loss, WVU's BCS National Championship Game chances were lowered.\n\nThe Mountaineers and the Panthers wore Nike Pro Combat System of Dress, uniforms designed to pay respect to Pittsburgh's steel industry and West Virginia's coal mining industry, for the 2010 Backyard Brawl. According to the Pittsburgh Tribune Review, West Virginia wore a shade of white \"that looks as if it has a fine layer of dust on the jersey\" and has accents in university gold that \"references the canaries used long ago to test toxicity in mines.\" The helmet has a thin yellow line, designed to look like \"the beam of light emitted by a miner's headlamp.\" Meanwhile, Pitt wore smoky college navy and black jerseys and pants with metallic team gold numerals \"to represent the brilliant glow of a blast furnace,\" according to a Nike website, and matching helmets with a gold stripe and logo \"evocative of steel I-beams\" and resembling a hard hat. West Virginia won the game in Pittsburgh 35–10.\n\nIn September 2015, both universities agreed to a four-game series running from 2022–25.\n\nThe location of the Backyard Brawl has varied much throughout its history. The very first football game took place in Wheeling, West Virginia in 1895. The next meeting, in 1898, was held in Fairmont, a short distance south of Morgantown. The third and fourth contests were held in Morgantown. The year 1902 marked the first time the game was held in Pittsburgh, at Exposition Park, the North Shore home of the Pittsburgh Pirates. 1910 was the first time the Backyard Brawl was held on the Pittsburgh campus, at brand-new Forbes Field. The series was held here for eight of the next nine years, until the opening of Pitt Stadium in 1925 on the opposite end of the University of Pittsburgh campus. Pitt Stadium hosted 5 straight games, until in 1930, the Backyard Brawl found itself at yet another new location, Mountaineer Field, which had opened in 1924 on the campus of West Virginia University. Another change in location occurred in 1981, when the game was played at a new Mountaineer Field in Morgantown. In 1998 and 2000, the game was played at Three Rivers Stadium. The most recent change took place in 2002, when the Backyard Brawl was played for the first time at Heinz Field, the new, full-time home of the Panthers, a year after it was opened.\n\n\n\nThe Backyard Brawl moniker is also used for the basketball rivalry between the two schools, which dates to February 17, 1905. The teams began competing annually since 1918, and have played each other at least once every season since then. Pitt began playing basketball in the Big East Conference in 1982–83, with the Mountaineers joining in 1995–96. The basketball rivalry has heated up over the last several years as each team has been among the best in the country and the games have taken on added significance. On February 9, 2006, for the first time in the history of the series, in the 169th edition, Pitt and WVU were both nationally ranked as they squared off in Pitt's Petersen Events Center. Pitt won, but a few weeks later, the two ranked teams played at WVU Coliseum with the Mountaineers winning. In the 2008–09 season, the Panthers swept both games during the regular season and came into the tournament ranked No. 2, but were upset by the Mountaineers in the quarterfinals of the Big East Tournament.\n\nDuring a February 2010 game when Pittsburgh visited West Virginia, several times during the course of the game, West Virginia fans threw objects at the Pittsburgh team. A Pittsburgh assistant coach was injured when an object was thrown at him. The actions received widespread attention. During the second half of the game, coach Bob Huggins used a microphone to address the fans. West Virginia University President Jim Clements issued an apology to the University of Pittsburgh community. Additionally, West Virginia vowed to address security, as the incident closing followed similar occurrences in games against Syracuse and Ohio State. This game was followed with a rematch nine days later in Pittsburgh, and while there were no off-court incidents, the game proved to be one of the most memorable in the history of the series as the 25th ranked Panthers upset the fourth ranked Mountaineers 98–95 in the first triple overtime basketball game to be played between the two schools.\n\nThe 2011–12 season marked the end of the Brawl within Big East conference play. Pitt and WVU traded road wins, with Pitt winning in Morgantown 72–66, and WVU winning at the Petersen Events Center for only the second time ever 66–48. The future of the rivalry is in question as WVU began playing in the Big 12 in 2012, while Pitt moved to the ACC in 2013.\n\nIn women's basketball, West Virginia leads the modern series, begun in 1975, 25–18.\n\nBasketball Results:\n\"Pittsburgh victories shaded in ██ blue.

{"id": "2144426", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2144426", "title": "Glenn Beck Program", "text": "Glenn Beck Program\n\nGlenn (previously titled The Glenn Beck Program) is a news talk and political opinion show on TheBlaze hosted by Glenn Beck. It is produced and recorded at TheBlaze studios in Dallas, TX. The show originally ran on CNN Headline News from 2006 to 2008 (now HLN) and moved to the Fox News Channel in 2009. Beck's program departed Fox News on June 30, 2011 with Beck announcing the creation of an online only network, later to become TheBlaze, that would air his television show among other programming. In 2012, Beck commenced encouraging listeners to ask their cable or satellite television providers to carry the new network.\n\nEach broadcast usually began with a brief, scripted monologue by Beck, in which he gave his analysis of the top story of the day. This was usually followed by an interview with a correspondent, who continued the discussion with his or her opinions on the matter.\n\nAlthough the original concept of the show combined elements of late-night talk shows (e.g., satirical comedy bits and frequent celebrity interviews) and cable news, it gradually came to center on the latter format and to use a more news-oriented style.\n\nThe Friday broadcasts were devoted to a full-hour interview under the label \"Honest Questions\". People interviewed included Ron Paul, Al Sharpton, Janice Dickinson, Larry King, Nancy Grace, Benjamin Netanyahu, Anderson Cooper, Jeff Foxworthy, and Ben Stein.\n\nSpecial programming included \"Exposed: The Extremist Agenda\", \"Exposed: The Climate of Fear\", and a week-long series titled \"America's Addiction\". These programs tended to be serious examinations of the subjects without any of Beck's humorous asides.\n\n\"The Extremist Agenda\", a special about Islamic extremism, aired in November 2006.\n\nThe May 2, 2007 edition of his \"Glenn Beck on Headline News\" was a \"special report\" entitled, \"Exposed: The Climate of Fear\". In his opening remarks, Beck said, \"Welcome to 'Exposed: The Climate of Fear.' I want you to know right up front, this is not a balanced look at global warming. It is the other side of the climate debate that you don't hear anywhere. Yes, Al Gore, there is another credible side.\" Media Matters for America described it as \"Glenn Beck's Climate of Distortion\" which \"rehashed several falsehoods and misleading talking points\", including the claim that the so-called Oregon Petition had credibility.\n\nBeck aired a special called \"Exposed: America's Broke\" during the week on September 18, 2008. This special dealt with the national debt in America and what Beck saw as America's debt of leadership as well.\n\nThis last \"Exposed\" special hosted by Beck aired the week after \"America's Broke\" and focused on the economic effects of not using the resources in America (offshore drilling, ANWR oil, etc.) before the U.S. can find an alternative source of fuel.\n\nGlenn Beck's self-titled television show on Fox News Channel premiered January 19, 2009, with his move resulting in a significant viewership increase. Beck's format included the use of diagrams and visual aids, most notably a rolling chalkboard. His program typically began with a 15–20 minute monologue.\n\nHis last show on Fox News aired on June 30, 2011. During the last episode, Beck recounted the accomplishments of the show and the topics it discussed.\n\nVan Jones resigned from his position as Special Advisor to the president in September 2009 after becoming a major subject of news stories on programs such as Glenn Beck, after lesser known conservative groups had first aired concerns as early as April. The early critics received coverage from Fox News, notably from Fox commentator Glenn Beck, who featured Jones on 14 episodes of his show. They forced Van Jones in July and August 2009 to defend his past including membership in a socialist group and support for Mumia Abu-Jamal, a death row prisoner convicted of killing a police officer. Editors credited Beck with his \"first scalp\", noting that the \"Huffington Post\" expressed continued support for Jones, singling out the efforts of Beck to force his resignation, though Beck was not the first to voice concerns about the appointment nor did he call for Jones' resignation.\n\n Anita Dunn, as interim White House Communications Director, made critical statements of Fox News. Following her statements, Beck aired a clip, from June 5, 2009, of Dunn giving a speech to high school students. She stated \"two of my favorite political philosophers, Mao Zedong and Mother Teresa – not often coupled with each other – but the two people that I turn to most to basically deliver a simple point, which is, 'You're going to make choices, you're going to challenge, you're going to say, why not?, you're going to figure out how to do things that have never been done before.\" Beck was critical of Dunn as he questioned what he alleged was a pattern of communist sympathy.\n\n Within days of its premiere, Beck began using his program on Fox News to warn the public about the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now (ACORN).\nIn September 2009, the website BigGovernment.com published heavily edited hidden-camera recordings, although the full video recordings were also made available, in which Hannah Giles posed as a prostitute and James O'Keefe posed as her boyfriend in order to elicit sympathy and responses from employees of ACORN. The day of their release, the videos were also aired on \"Glenn Beck\". After the release of the first video, Beck began to devote large portions of his program to publicizing the alleged \"underhanded dealings\" of ACORN. The story immediately had a disparaging effect on the organization, with one reporter from the \"New York Times\" proclaiming that the videos \"caught ACORN's low-level employees in five cities sounding eager to assist with tax evasion, human smuggling and child prostitution.\" Politicians quickly distanced themselves from the organization, and within days both the United States House and Senate voted to exclude ACORN from federal funding, (although funding was later restored after the group had disbanded as a result of a court order finding that the Congressional action violated the U.S. Constitution's bill of attainder clause). On 13 August 2010, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed and remanded on the grounds that only 10 percent of ACORN's funding was federal and that did not constitute \"punishment\". The organization was forced to disband amid the firestorm of controversy due to lack of funding.\n\nSubsequent independent investigations by multiple law enforcement agencies including state attorneys general and district attorneys determined that the ACORN workers had committed no criminal activity and that the videos were actually \"heavily edited\" to present material out of context and create a misleading impression of activities.\n\nOn Friday, January 22, 2010, Beck produced his first documentary, \"The Revolutionary Holocaust: Live Free or Die\".\n\nBeck's shows have been described as a \"mix of moral lessons, outrage and an apocalyptic view of the future ... capturing the feelings of an alienated class of Americans.\" Beck has referred to himself as an entertainer, a rodeo clown, and identified with Howard Beale: \"When he came out of the rain and he was like, none of this makes any sense. I am that guy.\"\n\nBeck's style of expressing his candid opinions have helped make his shows successful, but have also resulted in protest and advertiser boycotts. In late July 2009, Beck argued that reparations and social justice were driving President Obama's agenda, discussing issues of diversity and institutional racism. That week in response to the Henry Gates controversy, Beck stated that Obama has repeatedly exposed himself as having, \"a deep-seated hatred for white people, or the white culture.\" He concluded that, \"I'm not saying he doesn't like white people. I'm saying he has a problem. This guy is, I believe, a racist.\" These remarks drew criticism from MSNBC commentators, the NAACP, and resulted in as many as 80 advertisers boycotting both Beck's show and FNC. Beck later mentioned that he regretted calling Barack Obama a racist, saying that, \"I have a big fat mouth sometimes\".\n\n\"Time\" describes Beck as \"the new populist superstar of Fox News\" saying it is easier to see a set of attitudes rather than a specific ideology, noting his criticism of Wall Street, yet defending bonuses to AIG and denouncing conspiracies against FEMA but warning against indoctrination of children by the AmeriCorps program. \"Time\" concludes that \"what unites Beck's disparate themes is a sense of siege\" but notes that Beck describes his \"Glenn Beck Radio Program\" as \"the fusion of entertainment and enlightenment.\"\n\nAccording to Nielsen ratings, Beck had one of the highest rated 5PM cable news shows as of March 2009, consistently beating his competition's combined total viewership. Beck was up 96% in 2009, from Fox's previous year 5 p.m. time slot. However, the show's ratings for the month of January 2011 were 39% lower than their January 2010 number, representing the steepest decline of any cable news show. A significant factor in Beck's overall ratings drop is his viewership among the prized 25- to 54-year-old advertising demographic, which declined by almost one-half in 2010.\n\nAfter Beck accused President Obama of being a racist, Color of Change, an online civil rights advocacy group, urged advertisers to boycott Beck's program. As of September 21, 2010, a total of 296 advertisers had asked that their commercials not be shown on Fox News during Beck's programming including Wal-Mart, CVS Caremark, Best Buy, Ally Financial, Travelocity, LexisNexis-owned Lawyers.com, Procter & Gamble, Verizon Wireless, HSBC, Progressive Corporation and GEICO. Fox News has also had a difficult time selling commercials on \"The O'Reilly Factor\" and \"Fox and Friends\" when Beck appears as a guest on those shows as well as other Fox News shows. In the TV sales world Beck's show has become known as \"empty calories,\" meaning that he draws great ratings, but he's toxic for ad sales. Fox issued a statement indicating that overall revenue had not been lost as a result of the boycott, as most companies had shifted to other Fox programs. UPS Stores has decided to temporarily stop advertising on Fox News as a whole. Beck said that he was unapologetic for the remark and stated that the President is not above criticism.\n\nIn the \"South Park\" episode \"Dances with Smurfs,\" Eric Cartman parodies Beck multiple times, particularly when Cartman repeatedly says, \"I'm just asking questions,\" a Glenn Beck catchphrase. His show's intro and set are similar to Beck's. On the November 16 show, Beck acknowledged the parody, noting the use of chalkboards, crying on TV and questioning the President, saying, \"You haven't lived until \"South Park\" has done an entire episode on you.\"\n\nOn December 15, 2011, Beck moved his family and TheBlaze TV broadcasting from New York City to a suburb of Dallas, Texas, Las Colinas.\n\n"}

Located in the north-eastern part of Tarlac, it is bound on the north by San Manuel, in the east by Nampicuan, on the south by Ramos and on the west by Paniqui and Moncada.\n\nAnao is politically subdivided into 18 barangays.\nThe area where Anao is located was inhabited before 1800 by people from the Ilocos Region. In 1835, a group of immigrants from Paoay, Ilocos Norte reached the region and first settled near a creek on the bank where there were balete trees. These immigrants called their settlement Balete. The immigrants found the region where they settled to have many agricultural prospects and this attracted more immigrants who came from the north, especially from the town of Paoay.\n\nThe settlement expanded and later changed its name to \"\"Barrio Anao\"\" (deriving authentically from the Ilocano word \"danao\" which means \"creek\"). By that time, balete trees were extinguished and the barrio was adjacent in all directions by creeks.\n\nPaniqui had a road extended towards the east to Anao. Paniqui claimed Anao as its barrio and the people of the barrio accepted the claim. Years went by and Anao expanded. In 1870, a petition was made and approved that Anao be made a municipality.\n\nIn the , the population of Anao, Tarlac, was people, with a density of .\n\nAnao is predominantly an Ilocano-speaking town although most are fluent in Tagalog.

According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nThe municipality of Bamban is the southernmost gateway of the melting pot province of Tarlac in the Central Plain of Luzon in the Philippines.\n\nBeing the southernmost town in the province, it has a common boundary with Mabalacat, Pampanga, and in the west, with Zambales. The boundary is defined by the Parua River, which is a source of irrigation water, food, and sand and gravel for infrastructure projects. The mountainous region situated in the western part comprises almost two-thirds of the total land area, which used to be within the US Military Reservations. Nestled in this part are the BLISS projects and to the north, the MAR settlement project, which when completely developed will be a source of livelihood and food supplies for Central Luzon.\n\nBamban is from Manila and is from the provincial capital, Tarlac City.\n\nLong before settlers came, the place which was to become the town of Bamban, was a vast track of wild land extending eastward; and on the west side, composed of foothills and mountains lush with vegetation and tall trees extending deep into the Zambales ranges. The thick forest and mountains were then inhabited by the Aetas (locally known as Baluga), and the Zambal, both of whom subsisted only on fishing and native or wild animals which abounded in the place. Occasionally, daring traders from Pampanga and the Tagalog province, mostly enterprising Chinese, braved the wilderness to go northward to Capas and Tarlac.\n\nBefore the advent of the Spanish era, small settlers came, attracted by the fertile land and the glittering silver of the river that cut through the mountain to spill down the flat land, making it fertile. The settlers started small clearings in the thick growth of bamban plants which covered vast portions of the land bordering the river a small distance from the foothills.(because of these plants, the place was eventually named Bamban).\n\nSettlers upon settlers came to carve clearings in the land, and soon a small community was formed. About 1700, Agustinian Recollects came and established the Mission de Pueblos de Bamban. But the pueblo was then a part of Pampanga. In 1837, a new boundary line was established, thereby permanently making Bamban part of the province of Tarlac.\n\nOfficial recognition as a town was sanctioned by the gobernadorcillo in the town of Tarlac. Don Martín Sibal was subsequently appointed head and commissioned with the rank of \"Capitán\". Among the first settlers were the Sibal, Lugtu, Dayrit, Macale, Vergara, Manipon, and de la Cruz clans.\n\nDuring the revolution of 1896, Bamban was one of the first towns to take up arms against the Spaniards. Northwest of the town situated among the hills are remnants of strongholds built by brave bands of Bambanenses who joined Gen. Servilliano Aquino in the uprising in Tarlac. Up to this time, a portion of the foothills in the area is called \"Batiawan\" or look-out point. Many a brave son died in this movement for liberation.\n\nWhen the Americans came in 1900, the small pueblo gradually grew into a teeming town. The Bamban Sugar Central was established and further gave impetus to its growth. Don Pablo Lagman was the first to be appointed presidente and Don Laureano Campo as vice-presidente under the American military government. Other prominent families then took over the helm of government. During the Commonwealth era, the Sibals, the Lumboys, the Santoses, the Punsalangs, to mention a few, enjoyed political power until the outbreak of World War II.\n\nBamban was like the legendary phoenix, which locals felt must be resurrected from its ashes. The whole \"población\" was devastated and burned during the liberation. Undaunted, the people returned from hiding and began rebuilding even while the campaign was raging deep in the mountains. Growth was fast because of proximity of Clark Air Base. But Bamban can not be the same again. The aftermath of the war was felt for a long time. Consequently, prominent families left the town for the city to establish big business and names for themselves.\n\nThe 1991 Mount Pinatubo volcanic eruption and the subsequent flow of lava and mud to the lowlands of Bamban forced residents to move out or to stay at the Dapdap Resettlement Area, which is on higher grounds.\n\nBamban is politically subdivided into 15 barangays.\n\nIn the , the population of Bamban, Tarlac, was people, with a density of .\n\n\n\n"}

The town also consists of numerous subdivisions and exclusive villages.\n\nCapas is being dubbed as the “Tourism Capital of Tarlac”. Apart from being known as the final site of the infamous Bataan Death March, it is also known for Mount Pinatubo treks, where thousands of mountaineers and visitors go. The town has some industrial factories like the PilMiCo.\n\nCapas is a part of the Third Municipal district of Tarlac with Noel L. Villanueva as the present Third District Representative of Tarlac.\n\nOriginally a part of Zambales and Pampanga, its first settlers were the Kapampangan and the Aeta. It was founded in the year 1710 by the Augustinian Friars. During the American Colonial period, the Americans built the Camp O'Donell for military installation until when the Japanese used it as a concentration camp during the Bataan Death March as the last stop of the march.\n\nCapas as all other towns in Tarlac province was a part of vast wilderness inhabited by the Abelling tribes known as Aetas. The history of Capas dates back in the late 16th century when immigrants from Pampanga, Zambales, Pangasinan and the Ilocos region flock into the settlements. It is considered the oldest town in Tarlac. Capas became a pueblo (town) in 1710 beginning as a sleepy settlement at a place between Cutcut River in Sitio Pagbatuan and Gudya (present site) founded by Kapitan Mariano Capiendo. Capas' patron saint is San Nicolas de Tolentino. September 9–10 is the Capas Town Fiesta. Tarlac province was founded on May 28, 1874.\n\nIn the course of time, the townspeople of Capas were ordered by the Spanish authorities to change their family name of their own choosing on condition such family names begin with letter “C”, the first letter of Capas. Descendants of the early inhabitants still hold to this day such family names as Capiendo, Capuno, Capitulo, Capule, Capunpun, Cayabyab, Castañeda and Catacutan.\n\nIn the 1850s, Capas was a part of the western Pampanga Commandancia Militar de Tarlac which includes the town of Bamban, Concepcion, Victoria, O’Donnell, Murcia, Moriones, Florida Blanca, Porac, Mabalacat, and Magalang.\n\nO’Donnell (Patling) was then a bustling pueblo established by the Augustinians Recolletos Mission in the 1800s named in honor of Carlos O’Donnell y Abreu, the Spanish Minister of State who visited the Patling pueblo. O’Donnell was reverted as a barrio of Capas by the Philippine Commission of 1902 including Moriones reverted to Tarlac town and Murcia back to Concepcion. Capas is known in history as the site of the infamous death march concentration camp during World War II.\n\nOf the etymology of Capas, old folks believed it derived its name from a wild vine \"Capas-capas\" or it originated from a tree called Capas in the Aetas dialect, Bulak in Pampango or Capaz in Ilocano.\n\nThe town has built the Capas National Shrine. It was built and is maintained by the Philippine government as a memorial to the Filipino and American soldiers who died in Camp O'Donnell at the end of the Bataan Death March, which totals to almost 70,000 soldiers and back-up civilians.\n\nThis is a memorable site, for all Filipino and Americans veterans, that relate to Veterans Day in the Philippines. It was once a concentration camp subsequently serving as the burial grounds for thousands of Filipino and American soldiers who perished during World War II. The site was the ultimate destination point of the Bataan Death March involving Filipino and American soldiers who surrendered in Bataan on April 9, 1942.\n\nCamp O'Donnell was a facility of the United States Air Force in Capas, Tarlac, Philippines. Before the facility was transferred to the Philippine Air Force, it was first a Philippine Constabulary post then a United States Army facility.\n\nAnother site, Santo Domingo Death March Marker, which is located in Capas were about 60,000 Filipino soldiers who were camped and eventually unloaded to start the second phase of the Death March.\n\nWith more than 100,000 populace, an area that is good enough for a city and an income close to ₱250,000,000 becoming a city is not impossible according to Rodriguez. Enshrouding more than 53 percent of this town's land area, the Bases Conversion and Development Authority (BCDA) has included the municipality of Capas in the design of their Master Plan that is now in process, according to re-elected Mayor Antonio “TJ” Rodriguez.\n\nRodriguez bared this during his inaugural speech at the oath-taking ceremony of newly elected and re-elected municipal officials held at the Multi-Purpose Hall here Monday morning.\n\nTJ said BCDA claims control of the more than 19,900 hectares as a military reservation, where three of their barangays—Santa Juliana, Maruglu and Bueno—were included, while barangays Sta Lucia, Aranguren, Lawy, and O’Donnell were partly taken.\n\nBeing included in BCDA's master plan to make Capas a ‘Green City’ soon, TJ said that this town will become the most beautiful and progressive city in the country with the assurance of preserving the environment.\n\nHowever, with the forthcoming development, the controversy about the land where some Capasenos built their houses a long time ago is still a big issue. Rodriguez, however, vowed that he is with his constituents’ side in fighting for their rights over the land where their dwellings are constructed.\n\nHe revealed that as early as June 2011, he already wrote a letter to President Benigno Aquino III, requesting the delineation and redistribution of 5,000 hectares of the BCDA area where his constituents resided.\n\nHe said he would continue to consult with the stakeholders who will be affected by the BCDA's master plan.\n\nTJ assured Capasenos that with the new set of Sangguniang Bayan members headed by his party mate, Vice Mayor Roseller “Boots” Rodriguez, their vision towards the New Capas or Bayung Capas would be swiftly attained through their full cooperation and coordination with each other.\n\nDuring the occasion, the mayor enumerated his accomplishments during his first term, announcing the ₱65 million increase of budget from ₱180 million in 2010 to ₱215 million in 2012.\n\nHe said his administration is intending to generate more revenues to finance more projects and programs in health, agriculture, housing, infrastructure, disaster preparedness, and other services.\n\nNew Clark City ground broke in 2016 and is envisioned as a Business Contingency Hub of the National Government where it serves as a backup office should Metro Manila experience emergencies such as earthquakes, floods, and other calamities. It is located in the BCDA reservation in Capas that used to be a test site of military aircraft when Clark Air Base was under control of the United States. NCC will also serve as the primary venue of the 2019 Southeast Asian Games.\n\nCapas has relatively high ground, hilly places near the mountain range are at an approximate 46 meters. It is bordered by San Jose on the north, Tarlac City on the north-east, Concepcion on the east, Botolan, Zambales, on the west and south-west and Bamban on the rest of the southern parts. The west side of the town is mountainous while the east side is a plain. The town is also known as \"The Gateway to Pinatubo Volcano.\" The town also consists of Hot springs and several freshwater lakes like the Tambo Lake. Capas is from Manila and is from the provincial capital, Tarlac City.\n\nMany of the streams in the province contain small bits of petrified wood, fish, freshwater crabs, and other animals. Namria and Dingding creek merge as the two major tributaries to Lucong river in Concepcion. Most of Tarlac's waterways that originate from Mount Pinatubo pass through Capas, including the Bulsa Moriones River and Santa Lucia River that form Tarlac River.\n\nCapas is politically subdivided into 20 barangays.\n\nThe original Capas was Pagbatuan where the Aetas resides before the new settlers came to the now proper town of Capas.\nBarangay Cutcut, meaning \"hole\", \"gorge\" or \"dug up hole\", is known for its landfill where garbage from other municipalities is disposed. Malutung gabun or Red sand has a replica of Capas National Shrine which is sometimes featured on Philippine maps. Barangay Santo Rosario (Holy Rosary) has Villa De Santo Rosario, Rosary-ville, Small Tokyo which was formerly a Japanese Garrison hence its name, Pascuala which has the most poultries and piggeries in Capas it also has one of the most polluted tributaries to Lucong river because surrounding piggeries have made it wastewaters for pig excrement, despite protests, the government has taken little to no action regarding the pollution caused by piggeries.

Barangay Manlapig has rice fields and is among the liveliest barangays during the evening. Barangay Lawy is known for being a place for many of the first Ilocano settlers in the municipality. Barangay Mangga (Mango) used to be filled with the fruit-bearing tree or presumably. Barangay Estrada is the last stop before reaching Tarlac City through McArthur highway. Patling, Santa Lucia, Bueno, Maruglu and Santa Juliana are mountainous and hilly while filled with vast lands and forest, presumably the place where the earliest settlers of the town stayed.\n\nAs one of the richest towns in the province, it consists of numerous subdivisions and exclusive villages.\n\nIn the , the population of Capas was people, with a density of .\n\nThe people of Capas are predominantly Kapampangan because of their close ties from Pampanga. Ilocano is also used.

The site was the ultimate destination point of the infamous Death March involving Filipino and American soldiers who surrendered in Bataan on April 9, 1942.\n\nCamp O'Donnell was a facility of the United States Air Force in Capas, Tarlac, Philippines. Before the facility was transferred to the Air Force, it was first a Philippine Constabulary post then a United States Army facility.\n\nAnother site, Santo Domingo Death March Marker, which is located in Capas were about 60,000 Filipino soldiers who were camped and eventually unloaded to start the second phase of the Death March.\n\n\n\"Sangguniang Bayan\" Members\n\n\n"}

Divided as to where they were to resettle, some went north and others went south. The first group, headed by Don Pablo Luciano, the Governadorcillo, organized a new settlement on the slopes of Mt. Arayat further south and named the settlement after him. Eventually, the place was renamed Magalang. \nThe second group who took refuge in the north comprised the \"Santoses\", \"Laxamanas\", \"Salvadors\", \"Yumuls\", \"Castros\", \"Dizons\", \"Pinedas\", \"Felicianos\", \"Aquinos\", \"Corteses\", \"Bermudezes\", \"Perezes\", \"Punsalangs\" and many others, and settled in a place (now called Santo Nino) then occupied by the \"Lindos\" and \"the Amuraos (Don Esquolastiquo Amurao and Don Gaston Amurao)\". Most of the settlers became dissatisfied with the place, as it abounds with snakes and was scarce in water. They moved further south to a place now known as Concepcion. The settlers began clearing the land and built huts and roads. After several years, they named the place Concepcion after the Immaculate Conception, who was believed to possess power over the snakes that abound in the area.\n\n\nConcepcion is one of the largest municipalities of the province of Tarlac.

According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nThe early history of La Paz is unclear. Legends state that there was an old pueblo called \"Cama Juan\" situated along the bank of the Chico River, bordering the province of Tarlac and Nueva Ecija. When the Chico River overflowed during a storm, a great flood swept the entire pueblo during the night. The flood is said to have devastated the area, claiming many lives.\n\nThis forced the inhabitants of \"Cama Juan\" to evacuate. The old site (Cama Juan) is known as \"Balen Melakwan\" or \"Abandoned Town\".\n\nThe inhabitants chose a field of evergreen grass and shrubbery on which to rebuild, which they named \"Matayumtayum\".\n\nTowards the end of the nineteenth century, Francisco Macabulos and Captain Mariano Ignacio selected a more centrally located site for the future town to be known as La Paz. This existed only as a barrio of the town of Tarlac until 1892, when it was separated from the latter and rechristened in honor of its patron saint Nuestra Senora de La Paz y Buen Viaje. Its emergence as a new town gave its citizens a chance to run their own government with Martin Aquino as the first Governadorcillo.\n\nLa Paz was made the first seat of the revolutionary government of the province of Tarlac during the Spanish regime with Gen. Francisco Makabulos as its first provincial governor.\n\nLa Paz lies in the southeast portion of the province of Tarlac, from Metro Manila, from the provincial capital (Tarlac City) and from the regional center (San Fernando City aka San Fernando, Pampanga).

According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nIt is nestled in the foothills of the Zambales Mountains where the Camiling River originates and provides many scenic picnic and swimming sites, making it known as the summer capital of the province. The most common road to Mayantoc starts at \"Crossing Mayantoc\", at the national highway to Camiling, Tarlac just after the then Tarlac College of Agriculture (now the Tarlac Agricultural University) campus.\n\nThe first settlers of Mayantoc before the coming of Christian migrants were the negritos of the Abiling tribe. As they arrived in great numbers, so the natives were soon forced to move deeper into the forest areas of the Zambales mountain range.\n\nThe Christian settlers, mostly came from the Ilocos region, notably the towns of Cabugao, Tagudin, Sarrat, Paoay, Sinait and Bacarra settled in villages in the southern portion of the thriving town of Camiling, acknowledged as the mother town of Mayantoc. These villages later formed the barangay of Mayantoc under the township of Camiling. The place was still a forested area where rattan was abundant, a palm known by visitor traders as \"Yantoc\", so that in time the barangay became known as Na Maraming Yantoc – \"the place of yantoc\" – later just Ma-Yantoc. As the barangay progressed and grew in the size and population, its inhabitants retained \"Mayantoc\" as its official name.\n\nIn an effort to convert the barangay of Mayantoc into a town, a petition signed by the inhabitants was sent to the proper authorities on , with title deeds of several parcels of lands attached for the proposed school, market, plaza and town hall sites.\n\nThere were many others who helped in the birth of the new town, including Governor Gardner and Representative Luis Morales. Don Sergio Osmena, the speaker of House of Representative also helped in the granting of the people's petition. Then the American Governor General Francisco Burton Harrison promulgated Executive Order No. 96 declaring Mayantoc a separate town from Camiling and the new town was inaugurated in . Don Manuel de Leon, then Governor of Tarlac province appointed Castillan Antonio Sanz, as the town first Municipal President. However Sanz was autocratic in Spanish customs and was in office for only six months, before a petition seeking his ousting, signed by several municipal councilors.\n\nWhen the provincial board of Tarlac received the petition, Antonio Sanz was unseated, to be succeeded by the Vice President, Don Francisco Pascual Santos. That same year, an election was held in which Don Francisco P. Santos became the first elected Municipal President of Mayantoc.\n\nThe question of leadership having been popularly decided, the townspeople then took up the task of building the physical facilities of the community. The problem of a presentable Presidencia came up. But the municipal government was very poor. Bridges and roads were urgently needed. Canals along the roads of the town, especially around the plaza, needed digging. There were plenty of problems but few resources. The principal resource was the people themselves, imbued with pioneering spirit, cooperative and loyal to the leadership. The people donated whatever material they could afford, and freely gave their time and labor on the different projects of the new town.\n\nMayantoc is administratively divided into 24 barangays:\n\nIn the , the population of Mayantoc, Tarlac, was people, with a density of .\n\n\n\n"}

The fishery sector, once a vibrant source of food and income needs rehabilitation after the onslaught of lahar flows resulting from the Mount Pinatubo eruption. There is a growing retail and service sector in the poblacion along the national highway. Light industries are yet to evolve in the municipality to generate much needed employment. Ilocano, Kapampangan and Pangasinan are commonly spoken, with Tagalog and English as official languages used for secondary education, business and governance.\n\nMoncada is from Manila and is from the provincial capital, Tarlac City. It is accessible via the MacArthur Highway, and from Manila via the NLEX (North Luzon Expressway)\nand TPLEX (Tarlac-Pangasinan-La Union Expressway).\n\nMoncada did not come from the word \"\"Muscada\"\" but was copied from a town in Spain, Montcada during the Spanish era. Later on became, Moncada.\n\nThe original settlers in the area are the Pangasinenses followed by the Ilocanos were migrants from the Ilocos region, who cleared the land and planted a certain type of tobacco known as \"Muskada\". The name of the place was originally derived from the crop grown and later rephrased to Moncada, in honor of a Spanish nobility. In the early 19th century, a revolutionary hero Don Silvino Lopez and his wife Magdalena Espejo Lopez became prime movers of development and progress in the new municipality, along with the Morales, Obillo, Cuchapin, Atencio, Marzan, Gamundoy, Caparas and Santo Domingo families among others. The Chinese community led by the Lao and Co families likewise contributed significantly to the economic development and welfare of the community in later years.\n\nDuring World War 2, the town produced war heroes: Captain Ablang of the Philippine Scouts who was killed in action, Macario Peralta who was elected Senator and served as defense secretary, and Antonio E. Lopez popularly known as \"Kamote\", who defeated an Aquino-Cojuangco candidate for the post of Tarlac governor in the 1949 election. The golden age of Moncada is best remembered during this period, after the war to the late 1960s, when debutantes and guests from Manila and beyond, along with the townspeople would congregate at the town plaza to celebrate various festivals and events. Life then was not much of a struggle and food came in plenty. Local leaders serve at the pleasure of the electorates, who had utmost regard for \"delicadeza\" and opportunities were made available to those who work for it.\n\nThe struggle against the authoritarian regime realigned the political forces in Tarlac by the early 1980s, with a young maverick of the Lopez-Roy political clan by the name of Manny S.D. Lopez, shifting support to the rival Aquino-Cojuangco political clan. In doing so, Moncada is credited as the first municipality in the regime controlled 1st district of Tarlac, to fight for the restoration of democracy and demand justice for the slain opposition leader Ninoy Aquino. The hope for a new beginning unfortunately was lost to decadent ways of less discerning electorates, who consequently were subjected to the quality of governance they deserve. An exodus of bright minds sought and served ideals in other sectors and foreign lands.

According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nIt is the birthplace of the 11th President of the Philippines, Corazon C. Aquino.\n\nPaniqui is a Hispanized term derived from the Ilocano word \"\"pampaniki\"\" which means \"bat\", since the town has a feature of caves that house a population of bats. \n\nThe birth of Paniqui could be traced way back in 1712 when the provincial government of Pangasinan sent a group of men south of Bayambang, Pangasinan for the expansion of the Christian faith. The pioneering group was led by two brothers, Raymundo and Manuel Paragas of Dagupan and established the Local Government in a Sitio called \"manggang marikit\" (mango of an unmarried woman) now part of Guimba, Nueva Ecija. Surprisingly, in this sitio, there is a great number of mammals called by Ilocanos \"pampaniki\" and it was from this term that the name Paniqui was derived.\n\nAn uprising led by Caragay during the early part of 1720 forced the Local Government in \"manggang marikit\" to abandon the place and to evacuate for lowland called Acocolao, a place two kilometers west of the present Poblacion. It was a historical sitio where the first Filipino Moro, Sultan Ali Mudin, was baptized in 1750.\n\nPaniqui was a sprawling town that covered a wide area that time. Some of the barrios that formerly comprised Paniqui were \"San Roque\", now Cuyapo; \"Barong\", now Gerona; \"San Jose De Camiling\", now Camiling; \"Bani\", now Ramos; \"San Ramon\", now Moncada; and Anao.\n\nThe period between 1750 and 1896 were painful years of Spanish tyranny and oppression because the insurrectos and sometimes bandits, who are conveniently sprouted among the people, made sporadic attacks upon the conquistadores. These attacks on the Spaniards, who came on the islands bringing the sword and the cross, were marred by cholera and smallpox epidemics punctuated by floods and typhoons.\n\nHowever, a group of Paniqui patriots, welded together by a common belief of oneness, unselfish devotion for freedom and who are spurred by ruthless Spanish tyranny, organized a legitimate segment of the Katipunan on January 12, 1896, which is far cry from the bandits that used to harass the Spaniards.\n\nThese dauntless men made daring exploits, unrecorded in the history of the Katipunan, the most prominent of which was the ambuscade of Spanish soldiers along the road going to Anao and killing a great number of them. These incidents made a prelude to the end of the Spanish occupation in Paniqui.\n\nThe advent of American occupation saw a happy transition from the almost aristocratic and enigmatic characteristic of Spanish conquistadores to the democratic way of life under American tutelage.\n\nIn Paniqui, the Japanese were confronted with an enemy which is mighty in its fury and relentless in its vengeance. The members of the guerilla forces under Col. Maristela and aiding local troops of the Philippine Commonwealth Army military units dedicated their unflinching loyalty to the cherished ideals of their motherland by establishing a security cordon of the people under the very nose of the Japanese. The guerilla outfit preserved the landmarks of Paniqui like the sugar central, municipal building, public school buildings, and practically all the unpretentious private homes. One of the bloodiest chapters of this guerilla outfit was recorded on May 8, 1945, when the guerilla forces annihilated two platoons of Japanese soldiers in Santa Ines, where 52 Japanese soldiers were killed. The arrival of the local Filipino soldiers under the Philippine Commonwealth Army and the Philippine Constabulary liberated the town during the war.\n\nToday, the people of Paniqui, welded by the same persuasion that held them together during the most trying moments in history, are working again, hand in hand to make their native town, the progressive, respected, and thriving community that is.\n\nPaniqui is situated between the towns of Gerona in the south, Moncada in the north, Anao and Ramos in the west while Camiling and Santa Ignacia are to its east.\n\nThe town was originally part of the province of Pangasinan.

This is perhaps due to the influence of education, migration (especially to find work), television and mobile communications, which is extending the reach of previously localized peer groups.\n\n"}

It is the only national natural areas program that identifies and recognizes the best examples of biological and geological features in both public and private ownership. The program was established on May 18, 1962, by United States Secretary of the Interior Stewart Udall.\n\nThe program aims to encourage and support voluntary preservation of sites that illustrate the geological and ecological history of the United States. It also hopes to strengthen the public's appreciation of the country's natural heritage. As of November 2016, 599 sites have been added to the National Registry of National Landmarks. The registry includes nationally significant geological and ecological features in 48 states, American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.\n\nThe National Park Service administers the NNL Program and if requested, assists NNL owners and managers with the conservation of these important sites. Land acquisition by the federal government is not a goal of this program. National Natural Landmarks are nationally significant sites owned by a variety of land stewards, and their participation in this federal program is voluntary.\n\nThe legislative authority for the National Natural Landmarks Program stems from the Historic Sites Act of August 21, 1935 (49 Stat. 666, 16 U.S.C. 641); the program is governed by federal regulations. The NNL Program does not have the protection features of Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966. Thus, designation of a National Natural Landmark presently constitutes only an agreement with the owner to preserve, insofar as possible, the significant natural values of the site or area. Administration and preservation of National Natural Landmarks is solely the owner's responsibility. Either party may terminate the agreement after they notify the other.\n\nThe NNL designation is made by the Secretary of the Interior after in-depth scientific study of a potential site. All new designations must have owner concurrence. The selection process is rigorous: to be considered for NNL status, a site must be one of the best examples of a natural region's characteristic biotic or geologic features. Since establishment of the NNL program, a multi-step process has been used to designate a site for NNL status. Since 1970, the following steps have constituted the process.\n\n\nProspective sites for NNL designation are terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems; geological features, exposures, and landforms that record active geological processes or portions of earth history; and fossil evidence of biological evolution. Each major natural history \"theme\" can be further subdivided into various sub-themes. For example, sub-themes suggested in 1972 for the overall theme \"Lakes and ponds\" included large deep lakes, large shallow lakes, lakes of complex shape, crater lakes, kettle lake and potholes, oxbow lakes, dune lakes, sphagnum-bog lakes, lakes fed by thermal streams, tundra lakes and ponds, swamps and marshy areas, sinkhole lakes, unusually productive lakes, and lakes of high productivity and high clarity.\n\nThe NNL program does not require designated properties to be owned by public entities. Lands under almost all forms of ownership or administration have been designated—federal, state, local, municipal and private. Federal lands with NNLs include those administered by the National Park Service, National Forest Service, Bureau of Land Management, Bureau of Reclamation, Fish and Wildlife Service, Air Force, Marine Corps, Army Corps of Engineers, Navy, and others.\n\nSome NNL have been designated on lands held by Native Americans or tribes. NNLs also have been designated on state lands that cover a variety of types and management, as forest, park, game refuge, recreation area, and preserve. Private lands with NNLs include those owned by universities, museums, scientific societies, conservation organizations, land trusts, commercial interests, and private individuals. Approximately 52% of NNLs are administered by public agencies, more than 30% are entirely privately owned, and the remaining 18% are owned or administered by a mixture of public agencies and private owners.\n\nParticipation in the NNL Program carries no requirements regarding public access. The NNL registry includes many sites of national significance that are open for public tours, but others are not. Since many NNLs are located on federal and state property, permission to visit is often unnecessary. Some private property may be open to public visitation or just require permission from the site manager. On the other hand, some NNL private landowners desire no visitors whatever and might even prosecute trespassers. The reasons for this viewpoint vary: potential property damage or liability, fragile or dangerous resources, and desire for solitude or no publicity.\n\nNNL designation is an agreement between the property owner and the federal government. NNL designation does not change ownership of the property nor induce any encumbrances on the property. NNL status does not transfer with changes in ownership.\n\nParticipation in the NNL Program involves a voluntary commitment on the part of the landowner(s) to retain the integrity of their NNL property as it was when designated. If \"major\" habitat or landscape destruction is planned, participation in the NNL Program by a landowner would be ingenuous and meaningless.\n\nThe federal action of designation imposes no new land use restrictions that were not in effect before the designation. It is conceivable that state or local governments on their own volition could initiate regulations or zoning that might apply to an NNL. However, as of 2005 no examples of such a situation have been identified. Some states require planners to ascertain the location of NNLs.\n\nListed by state or territory in alphabetical order.

Wild animals roamed into the wilderness. Settlers from Zambales and Pangasinan and later those from the Ilocos region inhabited into the area to start a new life.\n\nThe residents of this barrio then did not know which jurisdiction they belonged. There are four towns surrounding the area namely: Moncada in the south; Anao and Cuyapo in the east and Alcala in the north. Neither of these duly organized municipalities claimed the sprawling area. However, an incident in the barrio helped the people solved the “jurisdiction” problem. A man gathering bees fell from the tree and died. The people immediately reported the incident to the nearby localities but only the Moncada authorities came and investigated the incident. Spurred by the gestures of the people of that town, they joined and submitted themselves under their jurisdiction and finally became an integral part of Moncada.\n\nThe Provinces of Pangasinan and Nueva Ecija border it on the north and east respectively, while on the southern side are the municipalities of Anao and Moncada. \n\nSan Manuel is from Manila and is from the provincial capital, Tarlac City.\n\nSan Manuel is politically subdivided into 15 barangays.\n\n\nIn the , the population of San Manuel, Tarlac, was people, with a density of .\n\n"}

To its north is Gerona and Santa Ignacia, west is San Jose, south is Capas and Concepcion and eastern boundaries are Victoria and La Paz. Tarlac City is located about from the regional center San Fernando, Pampanga, and from Manila.\n\nTarlac City is approximately above sea level on some parts but reaching even on large western portions.

The majority of Christians are Roman Catholics followed by a large concentration of Iglesia ni Cristo (Church of Christ). Other Christian groups belong to various Protestant denominations. There are some being non-Christian such as Muslims, etc.\n\nThere are several shopping malls established within the city. To name a few, there is the SM City Tarlac, which is the first SM Supermall in the Tarlac Province, located along McArthur Highway in San Roque; Plaza Luisita Mall, which is the first shopping center in Central Luzon (now Robinsons Luisita); the Magic Star Mall along Romulo Blvd. in Barangay Cut-cut; My MetroTown Mall in Barangay Sto Cristo; Palm Plaza Mall located along McArthur Highway corner F.

Many of the bus companies' rest stops can be found along MacArthur Highway including Siesta and Motorway.\n\nThe MacArthur Highway goes from the southern to the northern end of the city. There are a series of roads leading to Zambales and Pangasinan as well as Baguio City. Most buses passing through the town of Camiling onwards to Pangasinan usually take the Romulo Highway which forks from MacArthur Highway along Barangay San Roque.\n\nSubic-Clark-Tarlac Expressway (SCTEx) connects with Tarlac-Pangasinan-La Union Expressway (TPLEx) within the capital of the province. The 2 expressways serves as an alternate route for motorists going to the other parts of Northern Luzon area such as Pangasinan, La Union and Baguio while in the Marcos Highway via TPLEX and Kennon Road from McArthur Highway.\n\nIn the future, SCTEx and TPLEx connects with the proposed Central Luzon Link Expressway.

Its mandate is to process claims and pay compensation for losses and damage suffered as a direct result of Iraq's 1990–1991 invasion and occupation of Kuwait which started the Gulf War. These losses included claims for loss of property, deaths, loss of natural resources, damage to public health and environmental damage.\n\nAt the first meeting in August 1991, six categories of claims were set up: claims from individuals forced to flee Kuwait between the invasion and the cease fire (Category A); claims from individuals who (or whose family) suffered injuries or death as a result of the invasion (B); claims from individuals for business losses, pain and anguish, property damage etc. less than $100,000 (C); claims from individuals for business losses, pain and anguish, property damage etc. more than $100,000 (D); claims from corporations and other entities for business (including oil sector) losses (E); and governmental and international agency claims for cost of resettling and providing relief to citizens, claims for damage to government property and to the environment (F). Category E and F claims were further broken down to subcategories.\n\nEach claim category had specific dates for initiating the claim and providing required evidence. A total of over $350 billion in claims was submitted in 2,686,131 claims. Of these claims, 1,543,619 (57%) resulted in some sort of award. The total awarded, to be paid by Iraq from oil revenues, was just over $52 billion. As of April 2013 approximately $41.2 billion of this total had been paid to claimants, with approximately $11.2 billion remaining to be paid. The UNCC adopted a policy of paying individuals first, with the result that the remaining sum is owed entirely to a government entity, specifically the state oil company of Kuwait. The UNCC is making payments at approximately $1 billion per quarter, depending on the extent of Iraq's oil revenue.\n\nCopies of all major decisions and major evidence in support of claims can be found at the UNCC website.\n\nThe process of assessing and awarding claims was begun during the period of Saddam Hussein's stewardship of Iraq. However, many of the claims (especially major claims) were not settled until after a new government was in place in Iraq. Efforts by the Paris Club (an organisation set up by the world's industrialised nations during the 1950s to restructure debt from severely indebted nations) to seek debt forgiveness in order to allow Iraq to use its oil revenues for reconstruction met with some success among wealthy nations with the notable exceptions of Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. Some entities have suggested the concept of odious debt, under which a country should not be held responsible for debt incurred by despotic regime for the purposes of strengthening itself and suppressing internal dissent.\n\nFrom the beginning of its operation, the UNCC system has been criticized for the lack of representation allowed to Iraq, the defendant government, in the process. In particular no money from Iraq sales of oil was allowed to be used for Iraq's legal defence.\n\nKuwait and Saudi Arabia suffered gross environmental damage as a result of the Iraqi occupation, as the retreating Iraqi forces blew up oil wells and released millions of barrels (estimated as high as 11 million barrels) of crude oil into the Persian Gulf. In Kuwait the damage to the environment was largely terrestrial in the form of tarcrete and oil lakes surrounding the damaged wells. In 2001 the UNCC awarded Kuwait $108 million (the money to be taken from the Oil-for-Food Programme) to study the effects of the environmental devastation to the desert and the coastline, and the effects of the oil fires on public health. Most of Kuwait's desert is in fact sparse shrubland and capable of sustaining sheep, goats and camels. Little damage was found to Kuwait's shoreline and fishing industry. As a result of these studies claims were prepared for several billion dollars' worth of damages to the desert ecosystem resulting from the oil fires, uncontrolled oil releases, and military maneuvers by both Iraqi forces and coalition military.\n\nIn contrast, the Saudi study (funded with $109 million from the Oil-for-Food Programme via the UNCC) found damage mostly to the coastline. The anti-clockwise current pattern of the Persian Gulf forced the floating spill onto the Saudi coastline and fouled approximately 800 km (250 km as the crow flies) of almost pristine shoreline. Commercial fish stocks (shrimp and fin fish) plummeted but recovered within a few years. An extensive and very detailed study of the shoreline was conducted at 250-meter intervals for the entire affected length, from the high-water mark to low water, to determine the extent of the contamination and its effect on biota. The Saudis claimed several billion dollars to compensate for these environmental damages.\n\n"}

She moved into Mary Price's former apartment which was used as a meeting point for government employees engaged in espionage and their Soviet case handlers and couriers.\n\nTenny began supplying reports and memoranda from OSS. This information included a considerable quantity of data on activities of OSS personnel in virtually all sections and all countries around the world. Tenney also supplied information concerning a monitoring station on Long Island.\n\nBeginning in 1944, Tenney was being paid a regular stipend of $50 per month — considerable for the times — which had been arranged through Joseph Katz. In December 1944, Joseph Gregg became Tenney's handler, however Tenney complained about his technique and Gregg was replaced by Inez Munoz.\n\nTenney resigned from the OSS in June 1946 and transferred to the United States Department of State. By then the FBI had Tenney under surveillance. The State Department eased her out of her position and revoked her passport. In January 1947, Tenney had a nervous breakdown. She was confined to a psychiatric hospital for observation after a deadly combination of alcohol and phenobarbital which was regarded as a suicide attempt. Tenney remained unconscious for five days and upon regaining consciousness, was in a delirium and regarded as in a severe hallucinatory psychotic state. Her observers overheard Tenney mumbling about being followed, having her telephone tapped, having her friends under surveillance, and being a Russian spy. She then appeared to have a violent phobia against everything Russian, even the mention of the word \"Russian\", and was watched closely for another suicide attempt. Doctors, citing patient confidentiality, refused to discuss the case with FBI investigators.\n\nBy February 1946, unbeknownst to Tenney, her contact with Soviet intelligence Elizabeth Bentley, had defected and was cooperating with the counterintelligence investigation. Bentley visited with Tenney and concluded that her suicide attempt was genuine; Tenney felt alone and isolated not knowing the larger Soviet espionage operation had been compromised and that the Soviet controllers had broken off contact with their American agents. Tenney was unremorseful and appeared to wish to reestablish contact with Soviet handlers, dashing the FBI's hopes to gain her cooperation.\n\nIn June 1947, the FBI interviewed Tenney and determined she was in frail mental and physical health.\n\nIn 1998, Tenney was identified in the Venona project transcripts as code name \"Muse\", based on her transfer from the dismantled OSS to the Department of State.\n\n"}

A speech recognition grammar is a set of word patterns, and tells a speech recognition system what to expect a human to say. For instance, if you call an auto-attendant application, it will prompt you for the name of a person (with the expectation that your call will be transferred to that person's phone). It will then start up a speech recognizer, giving it a speech recognition grammar. This grammar contains the names of the people in the auto attendant's directory and a collection of sentence patterns that are the typical responses from callers to the prompt.\n\nSRGS specifies two alternate but equivalent syntaxes, one based on XML, and one using augmented BNF format. In practice, the XML syntax is used more frequently. \n\nBoth the ABNF and XML form have the expressive power of a context-free grammar. A grammar processor that does not support recursive grammars has the expressive power of a finite state machine or regular expression language.\n\nIf the speech recognizer returned just a string containing the actual words spoken by the user, the voice application would have to do the tedious job of extracting the semantic meaning from those words. For this reason, SRGS grammars can be decorated with \"tag\" elements, which when executed, build up the semantic result. SRGS does not specify the contents of the tag elements: this is done in a companion W3C standard, Semantic Interpretation for Speech Recognition (SISR). SISR is based on ECMAScript, and ECMAScript statements inside the SRGS tags build up an ECMAScript semantic result object that is easy for the voice application to process.\n\nBoth SRGS and SISR are W3C Recommendations, the final stage of the W3C standards track. The W3C VoiceXML standard, which defines how voice dialogs are specified, depends heavily on SRGS and SISR. \n\nHere is an example of the augmented BNF of SRGS, as it could be used in an auto attendant application:\n\nHere is the same SRGS example, using the XML form:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"ISO-8859-1\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE grammar PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD GRAMMAR 1.0//EN\"\n<!-- the default grammar language is US English -->\n<grammar xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/06/grammar\"\n</grammar>\n\n"}

Miller specialized in the history of early America, and took an active role in a revisionist view of the colonial Puritan theocracy that was cultivated at Harvard University beginning in the 1920s. Heavy drinking led to his premature death at the age of fifty-eight. \"Perry Miller was a great historian of Puritanism but the dark conflicts of the Puritan mind eroded his own mental stability.\" \n\nMiller was born in Chicago, Illinois. He earned his undergraduate and doctoral degrees from the University of Chicago and began teaching at Harvard University in 1931. In 1942, Miller resigned his post at Harvard to join the United States Army; he was stationed in Great Britain for the duration of the war, where he worked for the Office of Strategic Services. Miller may have been instrumental in creating the Psychological Warfare Branch of the O.S.S.; certainly he worked for the PWB for the duration of the war. After 1945, Miller returned to teaching at Harvard. He also offered courses at the Harvard Extension School.\n\nMiller wrote book reviews and articles in \"The Nation\" and \"The American Scholar\". In his long-awaited biography of Jonathan Edwards, published in 1949, Miller argues that Edwards was actually an artist working in the only medium available to him in the 18th century American frontier, namely that of religion and theology. His posthumously published \"The Life of the Mind in America\", for which he received a Pulitzer Prize, was the first installment of a projected 10-volume series. Miller spent a year at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey on a Guggenheim Fellowship and also taught in Japan for a year.\n\nHe died in Cambridge, Massachusetts of acute pancreatitis stemming from his longstanding alcohol use disorder. By some, especially within the Harvard community, his death was mourned as a loss to America's intellectual landscape.\n\nHollinger (1968) explores the philosophical basis of Miller's historiography, arguing that Miller's formulation of problems was controlled by tensions between 'conscious' and 'mechanical' and between 'understanding' and 'mystery.' For Miller, the mechanical world was devoid of morality and purpose, and was incompatible with conscious beauty and ethics. By contrast, within the 'conscious' realm the drive for knowledge about an intelligible universe controlled by laws vied with the opposite religious faith in an unknowable universe controlled by God. Miller's history was further deepened by his emphasis on development: he sees history as proceeding in a continuing series of interactions between traditional cultural forms and immediate environmental circumstances. For Miller, culture is never merely the product of the environment, but an active agent in the interaction. The search for 'historical knowledge' itself proceeds on the terms of this interaction. Miller rejected both positivism and the relativism of Carl Becker for the harder relativism later developed by Thomas Kuhn. That is, for Miller 'forms' are neither wholly arbitrary nor entirely discovered in 'the facts,' but are instead the inheritance and creation of the historian, altered and confirmed by his experience.\n\nMiller's attempts to discover and to reveal the religious feelings and the religious ideas set a new standard for intellectual historiography. Historians report that Miller's work has influenced the work of later historians on topics ranging from Puritan studies to discussions of narrative theory. In his most famous book, \"The New England Mind: The Seventeenth Century\" (1939), Miller adopted a cultural approach to illuminate the worldview of the Puritans, unlike previous historians who employed psychological and economic explanations of their beliefs and behavior.\n\nAt Harvard, he directed numerous Ph.D. dissertations. His most notable students were fellow Pulitzer winners Bernard Bailyn and Edmund Morgan.\n\nMargaret Atwood dedicated \"The Handmaid's Tale\" to Perry Miller. Atwood had studied with Miller while attending Radcliffe before women were admitted to Harvard.\n\n\n"}

He began his career as a screenwriter in the mid-1990s. He then began working as a director, starting with the horror-comedy film \"Slither\" (2006), and eventually moving to the superhero genre with \"Guardians of the Galaxy (2014)\", its sequel \"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2\" (2017) and \"The Suicide Squad\" (2021). He also wrote and directed the web series \"James Gunn's PG Porn\" (2008–09), and the superhero film \"Super\" (2010).\n\nJames Gunn was born in St. Louis, Missouri to parents Leota and James F. Gunn, an attorney. He was raised between St. Louis and Manchester, Missouri. He has five siblings: actor Sean, actor and political writer Matt, screenwriter Brian, Patrick, and Beth. He is of Irish and Jewish heritage. Gunn has stated that his family's surname was originally the Irish name MacGilgunn and that it means \"sons to the servants of the god of the dead\"; it means \"son of the brown one\".\n\nGrowing up, Gunn was influenced by low-budget films such as \"Night of the Living Dead\" and \"Friday the 13th\". He read magazines like \"Fangoria\" and attended genre movie screenings, including the original \"Dawn of the Dead\" at the Tivoli Theatre in St. Louis. At the age of 12, he began making 8 mm zombie films with his brothers in the woods near their home.\n\nGunn and his brothers all attended the Jesuit St. Louis University High School, where he graduated in 1984. He went on to earn a Bachelor of Arts from Saint Louis University. While at Saint Louis University, Gunn created political cartoons for the school's student weekly, The University News. Gunn said that, at an unspecified time in his college education, \"I went to two years undergraduate film school at Loyola Marymount in Los Angeles. But I was pretty screwed up at the time, and had to leave. Years later I went to graduate school at the Columbia University School of Fine Arts but I studied prose writing, not film writing.\" He earned a Master of Fine Arts from Columbia University in 1995.\n\nWhile living in St. Louis, Gunn founded a band, The Icons, in 1989, serving as lead vocalist. The group released the album \"Mom, We Like It Here on Earth\" in 1994, and its songs \"Sunday\" and \"Walking Naked\" were featured in the film \"Tromeo and Juliet\". The Icons disbanded in the mid-1990s. Gunn has continued to work in music, composing songs for \"Scooby-Doo\", \"\", and \"Movie 43\".\n\nGunn began his career in filmmaking with Troma Entertainment in 1995, for which he wrote the independent film \"Tromeo and Juliet\". Working alongside his mentor Lloyd Kaufman, the co-founder of Troma, Gunn learned how to write screenplays, produce films, scout locations, direct actors, distribute films, and create his own poster art. After contributing to several other Troma films, Gunn in 2000 wrote, produced and performed in the superhero comedy \"The Specials\", directed by Craig Mazin and featuring Rob Lowe, Thomas Haden Church, Paget Brewster, Judy Greer and Jamie Kennedy.\n\nGunn's first major Hollywood screenplay was \"Scooby-Doo\" in 2002. In 2004, he wrote the screenplays for the remake of \"Dawn of the Dead\" and the sequel \"Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed\". With these films, Gunn became the first screenwriter to have two films top the box office in consecutive weeks. That same year, he executive produced and starred in the mockumentary \"LolliLove\", directed by and starring his then-wife Jenna Fischer. His film directorial debut was the 2006 horror-comedy \"Slither\", which was included on Rotten Tomatoes' list of the 50 Best Ever Reviewed Horror Movies.\n\nGunn's next projects included the comedy short film \"Humanzee!\" which was originally intended exclusively for the Xbox Live's \"Horror Meets Comedy\" series of short comedy films by horror directors, it was replaced with \"Sparky and Mikaela\" which debuted on Xbox Live on December 31, 2008. In an April 2009 interview on \"The Jace Hall Show\", Gunn described \"Sparky and Mikaela\" as being \"about a human [and] racoon crime fighting team and they fight crime in both the forest world, among the furry animals, and in the human world\". Gunn also has a short-form web series for Spike.com titled \"James Gunn's PG Porn\".\n\nIn 2008, Gunn was a judge on the VH1 reality television show, \"Scream Queens\" where 10 unknown actresses compete for a role in the film \"Saw VI\", where he directed contestants during acting challenges.\n\nIn 2009, Gunn announced he was going to write and direct \"Pets\", a comedy about a man who is abducted by aliens who want to turn him into a household pet, with Ben Stiller, Stuart Cornfeld and Jeremy Kramer producing. However, by March 2009, Gunn announced, \"\"Pets\" unfortunately, is done. I'm gone. I left the project for various reasons. I hope it sees the light of day somehow, but it won't be with me attached as director.\"\n\nIn 2010, Gunn released \"Super\", a dark comedy and superhero satire starring Rainn Wilson and Ellen Page. Gunn co-wrote and directed the Marvel Studios adaptation of \"Guardians of the Galaxy\", which was released on August 1, 2014. His brother, Sean, has a role in the film. Gunn has appeared as an actor, mostly in smaller roles or uncredited appearances in his own projects. Dan Gilroy and Jack Black separately lamented the proliferation of superhero films, Gunn responded in a Facebook post, saying in part:\n\nGunn wrote and produced the horror film \"The Belko Experiment\", which was released in 2017. In 2016, he directed three Stan Lee cameo scenes in one day, for the film \"Doctor Strange\" and two unrevealed projects.\n\nGunn wrote and directed \"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2\" (2017). Gunn was slated to direct \"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,\" but in July 2018, Disney fired Gunn as the director amid controversy over off-color jokes he had tweeted. Gunn was rehired in March 2019.\n\nIn October 2018, Gunn was hired to write a completely new script for \"The Suicide Squad\", with the intention of also serving as director, after its original director Gavin O'Connor left due to scheduling issues. In January 2019, he was officially confirmed to direct \"The Suicide Squad\".\n\nGunn wrote a novel in 2000, \"The Toy Collector\", a story of a hospital orderly who steals drugs from the hospital which he sells to help keep his toy collection habit alive. In 1998, he and Troma's President Lloyd Kaufman co-wrote \"All I Need to Know about Filmmaking I Learned from The Toxic Avenger\", about his experiences with Kaufman while working at Troma.\n\nHe wrote the story for Grasshopper Manufacture's video game \"Lollipop Chainsaw\", working with game designer Suda 51.\n\nIn July 2018, in reaction to Gunn's public criticisms of Donald Trump, alt-right conspiracy theorist Mike Cernovich drew attention to tweets that Gunn wrote between 2008 and 2012, joking about topics like rape, child abuse, and pedophilia.\n\nAmid criticism of the tweets, Disney severed ties with Gunn. He was fired as director of the upcoming \"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3\" film; he was also dismissed from a role to help lead Marvel's planned \"Cosmic Universe\". Gunn responded: \"I have regretted [those jokes] for many years since. [...] Regardless of how much time has passed, I understand and accept the business decisions taken today. Even these many years later, I take full responsibility for the way I conducted myself then. All I can do now [is offer] my sincere and heartfelt regret [...] To everyone inside my industry and beyond, I again offer my deepest apologies.\"\n\nWalt Disney Studios' decision received criticism from several entertainers and journalists, including actors Dave Bautista, Selma Blair, Patton Oswalt, David Dastmalchian, Michael Ian Black, Mikaela Hoover, Mike Colter, Alex Winter, David Hasselhoff, directors Joe Carnahan and Fede Álvarez, comics artist Jim Starlin, musician Rhett Miller, comedian Jim Jefferies, \"Rick and Morty\" creator Justin Roiland, journalist David A. French, and Troma Entertainment founder and president Lloyd Kaufman. Bobcat Goldthwait, who worked as a voice actor on the 1997 Disney film \"Hercules\", responded to the incident by asking Disney to remove his voice from an upcoming park attraction based on the film.\n\nA number of media outlets openly criticized Disney's decision, including \"Collider\", \"Cartoon Brew\", \"The Daily Dot\", \"The Independent\", \"National Review\", \"MovieWeb\", and \"Vulture\". An online petition urging Disney to re-hire Gunn received over 400,000 signatures.\n\nOn July 30, 2018, \"Guardians of the Galaxy\" cast members Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, Dave Bautista, Bradley Cooper, Vin Diesel, Sean Gunn, Karen Gillan, Pom Klementieff, and Michael Rooker released a joint statement through social media expressing their support for Gunn.\n\nBecause of this, Sony Pictures decided to not promote the horror film \"Brightburn\", which Gunn produced, at the 2018 San Diego Comic-Con. However, when the first trailer for the film was released on December 8, 2018, Gunn's name was prominently featured. The film opened in May 2019.\n\nIn March 2019, Gunn was reinstated by Disney as director of the film after meeting with Alan Horn, chairman of Walt Disney Studios, on multiple occasions. Gunn will start production on the film once his work on \"The Suicide Squad\" has been completed.\n\nGunn married actress Jenna Fischer on October 7, 2000, in an event that Gunn's hometown paper reported was officiated by Lloyd Kaufman, but which Gunn later clarified had not been: \"They said I was married by Lloyd Kaufman, which is not true. He was \"at\" my wedding and he gave a speech.\" Gunn and Fischer had originally met in the St. Louis area through Gunn's brother Sean, who had acted in plays alongside Fischer in high school. After seven years of marriage, Gunn and Fischer announced their separation in a joint statement on September 5, 2007, divorcing in 2008. In 2010, Fischer persuaded Gunn to cast Rainn Wilson, her co-star on \"The Office\", in Gunn's film \"Super\".\n\nGunn has been in a relationship with actress Jennifer Holland since 2015.\n\nGunn was raised in a Roman Catholic family and has mentioned how prayer continues to play an important role in his life, but has also said that he is \"in some ways, anti-religion\".

He has since become a model for many Moderate politicians, especially in the Moderate Youth League.\n\nHis leadership saw a period of liberalisation of the Moderate policies, a process which continues to this day.\n\nHe was known for his love for the Stockholm archipelago, where he had a house on a little island in an archipelago named Sundskär located within the Norrtälje Municipality, and often used similies inspired by it in speech and articles.

{"id": "2144507", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2144507", "title": "Jefferson Station (SEPTA)", "text": "Jefferson Station (SEPTA)\n\nJefferson Station (formerly named Market East Station) is an underground SEPTA Regional Rail station located on Market Street in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Its official SEPTA address is 12th and Filbert streets. It is the easternmost of the three Center City stations on the SEPTA Regional Rail system, and is part of the Center City Commuter Connection, which connects the former Penn Central commuter lines with the former Reading Company commuter lines. The station opened in November 1984, is owned and maintained by SEPTA, and replaced the former Reading Terminal, under which a small part of the station sits. (The old terminal became part of the Pennsylvania Convention Center.)\n\nThe station is part of Fashion District Philadelphia, a shopping mall that replaced the Gallery at Market East that was built in the late 1970s and early 1980s. There are several entrances to the station, including several on the concourse level to the \"Gallery II\" part of the mall. After the Convention Center was opened, a new entrance was built in the Reading Terminal headhouse on Market Street.\n\nArchitecturally, the design of Jefferson Station is integrated with the Fashion District Philadelphia shopping mall, which features a number of stores and quick-service food facilities, including Tiffany's Bakery, which boasts state-of-the-art digital signage for the commuters passing through Jefferson Station. The newly renovated bakery uses television to display their original content as well as the SEPTA train timetable. Stainless steel and large plate-glass windows are a major design element throughout the station, with large color tile murals (depicting the four seasons) adorning the walls and the extensive use of tile for flooring. The upper seating area has recently been renovated with metal benches facing the windows that look down onto the tracks. The large windows are used both for exterior windows, where they admit light from street level down to track level like a clerestory, and for separating the concourse level from the track level. Because this is an underground station and the clerestory section is only a small part of the station, artificial lighting is used throughout the station.\n\nThe station's name was changed from Market East to Jefferson on September 4, 2014 after Thomas Jefferson University Hospital bought the naming rights. The length of the $4 million contract for the Jefferson Station name is five years, with the option to keep it for an additional four years for $3.4 million.\n\nThe station extends under three city blocks and the platforms are along the northern edge of the blocks. The tracks here are the deepest ones in Philadelphia.\n\nThere are several monitors which show the status of the trains at these entrances, as well as near the ticket windows and at the tops of the escalators to the track level. At least one of the ticket windows, which are located on the concourse level, is open daily.\nThere are two wide island platforms and four tracks, with each platform serving two tracks. Each platform is divided into an \"A\" section and a \"B\" section so that trains on different routes stop at different spots along the platform length. This allows waiting passengers to be dispersed along the platform rather than congregating. Platforms are 850 feet long and 35 feet wide which allows up to ten railcars to serve a platform at a time.\n\nOverhead electric catenary wires supply power to the trains. Regularly scheduled diesel-operated trains are forbidden to enter the station, as SEPTA omitted provisions for ventilation fans when designing the Center City Tunnel. The Delaware Valley Association of Railroad Passengers advocated for the inclusion of ventilation fans that would allow diesel exhaust fumes to exit tunnels and stations. SEPTA deemed the option unfeasible throughout the planning process. On occasion, SEPTA diesel work trains will pass through the station without stopping. In this situation, the track must be clear through the tunnel before the diesel train is allowed through.\n\nTo the west, the tracks have a set of cross-over tracks that allow trains to change tracks before they reach Suburban Station. To the east, there is a sharp curve north where trains are limited to about 20 to 25 mph (32 to 40 km/h), and then another set of cross-overs before climbing an incline of over 2.5% to Temple University Station. Jefferson Station is approximately from Suburban Station.\n\nJefferson Station is served by all Regional Rail lines except the limited-service Cynwyd Line, which terminates at Suburban Station. In FY 2005, the average total weekday boardings at this station was 11,848, making it the second busiest station in the Regional Rail system. Jefferson Station has also been identified as Amtrak's preferred Philadelphia station for future high-speed rail lines in the Northeast Corridor.\n\nThe station is connected underground to SEPTA's heavy rail Market-Frankford Line and Broad-Ridge Spur and also the PATCO High Speed Line at their shared 8th Street station through Fashion District Philadelphia. There are also below-ground pedestrian connections to the Market-Frankford Line's 11th Street, 13th Street, and 15th Street stations. Jefferson Station is adjacent to various SEPTA and New Jersey Transit bus routes that travel on Market Street. Finally, the Philadelphia Greyhound Terminal is immediately north of the station across Filbert Street.\n\n"}

In this boundary-pushing take on the genre of alphabet book, Seuss presents, instead of the twenty-six letters of the conventional English alphabet, twenty more letters that purportedly follow them.\n\nThe young narrator, not content with the confines of the ordinary alphabet, reports on additional letters beyond Z, with a fantastic creature corresponding to each new letter. For example, the letter \"FLOOB\" is the first letter in Floob-Boober-Bab-Boober-Bubs, which have large buoyant heads and float serenely in the water. In order, the letters, followed by the creatures for which the letters are the first letter when spelling their names, are YUZZ (Yuzz-a-ma-Tuzz), WUM (Wumbus), UM (Umbus), HUMPF (Humpf-Humpf-a-Dumpfer), FUDDLE (Miss Fuddle-dee-Duddle), GLIKK (Glikker), NUH (Nutches), SNEE (Sneedle), QUAN (Quandary), THNAD (Thnadners), SPAZZ (Spazzim), FLOOB (Floob-Boober-Bab-Boober-Bubs), ZATZ (Zatz-it), JOGG (Jogg-oons), FLUNN (Flunnel), ITCH (Itch-a-pods), YEKK (Yekko), VROO (Vrooms), and HI!

A list of all the additional letters is shown at the end.\n\nJudith and Neil Morgan, Geisel's biographers, note that most of the letters resemble elaborate monograms, \"perhaps in Old Persian\". These letters are not officially encoded in Unicode, but the independent ConScript Unicode Registry provides an unofficial assignment of code points in the Unicode Private Use Area for them.\n\nSome of the animals from \"On Beyond Zebra!\" appear in the 1975 CBS TV Special \"The Hoober-Bloob Highway\". In this segment, Hoober-Bloob babies don't have to be humans if they don't choose to be, so Mr. Hoober-Bloob shows them a variety of different animals; including ones from \"On Beyond Zebra!\" (and \"If I Ran the Zoo\"). Such animals include: a Jogg-oon, a Sneedle, a Zatz-it, a Wumbus, and a Yekko.\n\n"}

Created by metal artist Jill Turman, the sculpture was dedicated in 2000, and has become a source of community pride and identity. In 2012, Cooper-Young was listed on the American Planning Association's 10 Great Neighborhoods in the U.S list.\n\nThe neighborhood is known for its eclectic mix of shops, bars and restaurants. Java Cabana, Cooper-Young's coffeehouse, was once host to the Elvis Impersonator shrine, as well as the Viva Wedding Chapel, where hundreds of people were once married in the backroom by Elvis impersonators. Other restaurants such as Cafe Ole, Tsunami, Soul Fish, Cafe Palladio, Celtic Crossing, Alchemy, Aldo's Pizza Pies, Sweet Grass, Next Door, DKDC, The Beauty Shop, and Young Ave Deli represent diverse cuisines (sometimes several within one establishment) and reflect the creative spirit of the neighborhood.\n\nAlso in Cooper Young, one will find The House of Mews (a shelter for homeless cats), Goner Records, a local record label, Jay Etkin Gallery and Burke's Book Store.

The Cooper Young Festival is always the second Saturday after Labor Day each year from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. The neighborhood is considered one of the more artistic and \"hip\" areas of the city, and shows evidence of successful urban revitalization in Memphis' core. The Cooper Young Festival, hosted by the Cooper Young Business Association (CYBA), is a popular outdoor celebration in Memphis, Tennessee. It is one of Memphis' most highly attended festivals in Tennessee bringing in over 130,000 attendees and is continuing to grow. The festival is the largest single day event in the city where people pack into the neighborhood. It is free admission. 400 artisans from around the country go to sell their music, arts, and crafts along Cooper Street and Young Avenue. The festival came about in 1977 when a group of 500 residents from the area organized and decided to have it. November 5, 1977 was the date of the first festival. It was a community flea market with a stage and playground activities in the parking lot of Galloway United Methodist Church. It turned into a three-day festival called Cooper Young Business Association Street Fair. Starting with 7,000 visitors, the festival grew to entertaining 100,000 visitors. Every year the festival is kicked off with a neighborhood art invitational. An artist from the Cooper Young neighborhood designs a poster to represent the unique style of the Cooper Young area. Bands are brought in to perform on three stages over the weekend.\n\nThe Cooper-Young Community Association, founded in 1976, serves as the main advocate for the residents of the area and produces a monthly neighborhood newspaper, \"The Lamplighter\", to communicate neighborhood and city news. The CYCA also sponsors the Festival 4-Miler race - a 4-mile race through the neighborhood the night before the Cooper-Young Festival.\n\nThe Cooper-Young Business Association serves as the primary advocate for the businesses and services of the neighborhood, and produces the Cooper-Young Festival along with other events to help draw attention to those businesses.\n\n"}

Both varieties are made entirely from the milk of the Burns' cow herd, which is composed of Friesian cows. \n\nArdrahan is a semi-soft vegetarian cheese made from pasteurised cow's milk and vegetarian rennet. It has a 25% fat content. It is made into wheels of 400g and 1.5 kg with a ridged brine-washed rind encrusted with moulds. A smoked version is also available.\n\nArdrahan cheese has an earthy, farmhouse taste and aroma, and also a zesty tang that enhances the rich buttery and meaty flavour. It has a smooth texture, a deep yellow interior and an edible, full-bodied rind. Ardrahan's interior is firm and slightly chalky. It matures in four to eight weeks.\n\nSince 2006, they have also produced Duhallow cheese, a medium hard cheese also made from pasteurised cow's milk using vegetarian rennet. Most is exported to the US.\n\nIn 1994, Ardrahan won the Irish Food Writers Guild annual Good Food award. Since then, Ardrahan has won many more awards, including multiple medals from the British Cheese Awards and the World Cheese Awards.\n"}

Because he wants the best for his expectant wife, Ellen (O'Donnell), Joe rationalizes stealing what he thinks is $200 from a lawyer's office on his route. He discovers that he's actually stolen $30,000 from Victor Backett (Edmund Ryan), a corrupt attorney. Backett has framed wealthy broker/patsy Emil Lorrison (Paul Harvey) in a sex scandal, then extorted the money from him with the help of Lucille \"Lucky\" Colner (Adele Jergens) and ex-con accomplice Georgie Garsell (James Craig).\n\nFrom the start, Joe begins to panic. He explains his new-found wealth to Ellen as a lucrative out-of-town job, then disguises the money as a package and leaves it with bartender Nick Drumman (Ed Max). In the meantime Lucille's body is found in the East River, strangled, and Captain Walter Anderson (Paul Kelly) of the New York Police Department investigates the murder. Both Lorrison and Backett are interviewed, their names having been found in Lucille's \"love diary.\" After the birth of his child, Joe decides to try to return his ill-gotten gain, but Backett suspects a trap and refuses the offer. Backett instead sends Garsell and a taxi cab driver associate to grab Joe and recover the cash. Joe is able to escape after they discover that Drumman has substituted a nightgown in the package and gone into hiding with the money.\n\nJoe looks for Drumman, but Garsell finds the bartender first, strangles him, and recovers the money. Joe confesses the original theft to Ellen, who urges him to turn himself in, but he finds himself a suspect in Drumman's murder. He tries to track down the source of the money to clear himself, even as Captain Anderson methodically pursues both men as suspects: Garsell for Lucille and Joe for Drumman. Joe locates Garsell's girlfriend, singer Harriet Sinton (Jean Hagen), but she betrays him to Garsell. Garsell plans to murder Joe and strangles Harriet to eliminate her as a witness. Captain Anderson is hot on their heels and a chase ensues through the early morning streets of New York. Garsell kills his partner and forces Joe to drive, but Joe deliberately crashes the taxi to end the nightmare. When Garsell tries to run out of the car, he is shot by the police and killed. Joe is carried out of the car by the police and taken into the ambulance. Ellen arrives just before he leaves for the hospital, and they embrace. Joe survives the accident; the police are able to learn the truth, so he is cleared. \n\n\nAccording to MGM records the film made $448,000 in the US and Canada and $323,000 elsewhere, resulting in a loss to the studio of $467,000.\n\nWhen the film was screened in New York City in 2006 as part of Film Forum's festival devoted to the \"B Noir\" films of the 1940s and 1950s, film critic Ed Gonzalez for \"Slant\" magazine, reviewed the film and found he liked the picture's \"mise en scène\" and screenplay, writing, \"...\"Side Street\" is a triumph of visual savvy and moral exactitude—-a scurrying spectacle of dog-cat-and-mouse throughout the veiny streets of New York City. The Big Apple comes alive via a nervy mix of photojournalistic shots of people on the move and hieratic [formal] compositions that give the squeeze to Farley Granger's Joe Norton...\"\n\nCritic Nathan Gelgud said, \"Because it's an Anthony Mann movie, \"Side Street\" is similarly interested in detail, as well as great action sequences and even greater locations. The best stuff is inside a bar where Farley Granger leaves a bundle of stolen money. The scenes in the bar are the ones that come immediately to mind when you think of \"Side Street\" because the details are spot-on, and Mann constructs the place with the depth of the academy frame he’s so good at utilizing.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "2144540", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2144540", "title": "Toxaphene", "text": "Toxaphene\n\nToxaphene was an insecticide used primarily for cotton in the southern United States during the late 1960s and 1970s. Toxaphene is a mixture of over 670 different chemicals and is produced by reacting chlorine gas with camphene. It can be most commonly found as a yellow to amber waxy solid.\n\nToxaphene was banned in the United States in 1990 and was banned globally by the 2001 Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants. It is a very persistent chemical that can remain in the environment for 1–14 years without degrading, particularly in the soil.\n\nTesting performed on animals, mostly rats and mice, has demonstrated that toxaphene is harmful to animals. Exposure to toxaphene has proven to stimulate the central nervous system, as well as induce morphological changes in the thyroid, liver, and kidneys.\n\nToxaphene has been shown to cause adverse health effects in humans. The main sources of exposure are through food, drinking water, breathing contaminated air, and direct contact with contaminated soil. Exposure to high levels of toxaphene can cause damage to the lungs, nervous system, liver, kidneys, and in extreme cases, may even cause death. It is thought to be a potential carcinogen in humans, though this has not yet been proven.\n\nToxaphene is a synthetic organic mixture composed of over 670 chemicals, formed by the chlorination of camphene (CH) to an overall chlorine content of 67–69% by weight. The bulk of the compounds (mostly chlorobornanes, chlorocamphenes, and other bicyclic chloroorganic compounds) found in toxaphene have chemical formulas ranging from CHCl to CHCl, with a mean formula of CHCl. The formula weights of these compounds range from 308 to 551 grams/mole; the theoretical mean formula has a value of 414 grams/mole. Toxaphene is usually seen as a yellow to amber waxy solid with a piney odor. It is highly insoluble in water but freely soluble in aromatic hydrocarbons and readily soluble in aliphatic organic solvents. It is stable at room temperature and pressure. It is volatile enough to be transported for long distances through the atmosphere.\n\nToxaphene was primarily used as a pesticide for cotton in the southern United States during the late 1960s and 1970s. It was also used on corn, small grains, vegetables, and soybeans to control ectoparasites such as lice, flies, ticks, mange, and scam mites on livestock. In some cases it was used to kill undesirable fish species in lakes and streams. The breakdown of usage can be summarized: 85% on cotton, 7% to control insect pests on livestock and poultry, 5% on other field crops, 3% on soybeans, and less than 1% on sorghum.\n\nThe first recorded usage of toxaphene was in 1966 in the United States, and by the early to mid 1970s, toxaphene was the United States' most heavily used pesticide. Over 34 million pounds of toxaphene were used annually from 1966 to 1976. As a result of Environmental Protection Agency restrictions, annual toxaphene usage fell to 6.6 million pounds in 1982. In 1990, the EPA banned all usage of toxaphene in the United States. Toxaphene is still used in countries outside the United States but much of this usage has been undocumented. Between 1970 and 1995, global usage of toxaphene was estimated to be 670 million kilograms (1.5 billion pounds).\n\nToxaphene was first produced in the United States in 1947 although it was not heavily used until 1966. By 1975, toxaphene production reached its peak at 59.4 million pounds annually. Production decreased more than 90% from this value by 1982 due to Environmental Protection Agency restrictions. Overall, an estimated 234,000 metric tons (over 500 million pounds) have been produced in the United States. Between 25% and 35% of the toxaphene produced in the United States has been exported. There are currently 11 toxaphene suppliers worldwide.\n\nWhen released into the environment, toxaphene can be quite persistent and exists in the air, soil, and water. In water, it can evaporate easily and is fairly insoluble. Its solubility is 3 mg/L of water at 22 degrees Celsius. Toxaphene breaks down very slowly and has a half-life of up to 12 years in the soil. It is most commonly found in air, soil, and sediment found at the bottom of lakes or streams. It can also be present in many parts of the world where it was never used because toxaphene is able to evaporate and travel long distances through air currents. Toxaphene can eventually be degraded, through dechlorination, in the air using sunlight to break it down. The degradation of toxaphene usually occurs under aerobic conditions. The levels of toxaphene have decreased since its ban, however, due to its persistence can still be found in the environment today.\n\nThe three main paths of exposure to toxaphene are ingestion, inhalation, and absorption. For humans, the main source of toxaphene exposure is through ingested seafood. When toxaphene enters the body, it usually accumulates in fatty tissues. It is broken down through dechlorination and oxidation in the liver, and the byproducts are eliminated through feces.\n\nPeople that live near an area that has high toxaphene contamination are at high risk to toxaphene exposure through inhalation of contaminated air or direct skin contact with contaminated soil or water. Eating large quantities of fish on a daily basis also increases susceptibility to toxaphene exposure. Finally, exposure is rare, yet possible through drinking water when contaminated by toxaphene runoff from the soil. However, toxaphene has been rarely seen at high levels in drinking water due to toxaphene's high levels of insolubility in water.\n\nShellfish, algae, fish and marine mammals have all been shown to exhibit high levels of toxaphene. People in the Canadian Arctic, where a traditional diet consists of fish and marine animals, have been shown to consume ten times the accepted daily intake of toxaphene. Also, blubber from beluga whales in the Arctic were found to have unhealthy and toxic levels of toxaphene.\n\nWhen inhaled or ingested, sufficient quantities of toxaphene can damage the lungs, nervous system, and kidneys, and may cause death. The major health effects of toxaphene involve central nervous system stimulation leading to convulsive seizures. The dose necessary to induce nonfatal convulsions in humans is about 10 milligrams per kilogram body weight per day. Several deaths linked to toxaphene have been documented in which an unknown quantity of toxaphene was ingested intentionally or accidentally from food contamination. The deaths are attributed to respiratory failure resulting from seizures. Chronic inhalation exposure in humans results in reversible respiratory toxicity.\n\nA study conducted between 1954 and 1972 of male agricultural workers and agronomists exposed to toxaphene and other pesticides showed that there are higher proportions of bronchial carcinoma in the test group than in the unexposed general population. However, toxaphene may not have been the main pesticide responsible for tumor production. Tests on lab animals show that toxaphene causes liver and kidney cancer, so the EPA has classified it as a Group B2 carcinogen, meaning it is a probable human carcinogen. The International Agency for Research on Cancer has classified it as a Group 2B carcinogen.\n\nToxaphene can be detected in blood, urine, breast milk, and body tissues if a person has been exposed to high levels, but it is removed from the body quickly, so detection has to occur within several days of exposure.\n\nIt is not known whether toxaphene can affect reproduction in humans.\n\nToxaphene was used to treat mange in cattle in California in the 1970s and there were reports of cattle deaths following the toxaphene treatment.\n\nChronic oral exposure in animals affects the liver, the kidney, the spleen, the adrenal and thyroid glands, the central nervous system, and the immune system. Toxaphene stimulates the central nervous system by antagonizing neurons leading to hyperpolarization of neurons and increased neuronal activity.\n\nToxaphene has been found on at least 68 of the 1,699 National Priorities List sites identified by the United States Environmental Protection Agency. Toxaphene has been forbidden in Germany since 1980. Most uses of toxaphene were cancelled in the U.S. in 1982 with the exception of use on livestock in emergency situations, and for controlling insects on banana and pineapple crops in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. All uses of toxaphene were cancelled in the U.S. in 1990.\n\nToxaphene has been banned in 37 countries, including Austria, Belize, Brazil, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Egypt, the EU, India, Ireland, Kenya, Korea, Mexico, Panama, Singapore, Thailand and Tonga. Its use has been severely restricted in 11 other countries, including Argentina, Columbia, Dominica, Honduras, Nicaragua, Pakistan, South Africa, Turkey, and Venezuela.\n\nIn the Stockholm Convention on POPs, which came into effect on 17 May 2004, twelve POPs were listed to be eliminated or their production and use restricted. The OCPs or pesticide-POPs identified on this list have been termed the \"dirty dozen\" and include aldrin, chlordane, DDT, dieldrin, endrin, heptachlor, hexachlorobenzene, mirex, and toxaphene.\n\nThe EPA has determined that lifetime exposure to 0.01 milligrams per liter of toxaphene in the drinking water is not expected to cause any adverse noncancer effects if the only source of exposure is drinking water, and has established the maximum contaminant level (MCL) of toxaphene at 0.003 mg/L. The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) uses the same level for the maximum level permissible in bottled water.\n\nThe FDA has determined that the concentration of toxaphene in bottled drinking water should not exceed 0.003 milligrams per liter.\n\nThe United States Department of Transportation lists toxaphene as a hazardous material and has special requirements for marking, labeling, and transporting the material.\n\nIt is classified as an extremely hazardous substance in the United States as defined in Section 302 of the U.S. Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (42 U.S.C. 11002), and is subject to strict reporting requirements by facilities which produce, store, or use it in significant quantities.\n\nTrade names and synonyms include Chlorinated camphene, Octachlorocamphene, Camphochlor, Agricide Maggot Killer, Alltex, Allotox, Crestoxo, Compound 3956, Estonox, Fasco-Terpene, Geniphene, Hercules 3956, M5055, Melipax, Motox, Penphene, Phenacide, Phenatox, Strobane-T, Toxadust, Toxakil, Vertac 90%, Toxon 63, Attac, Anatox, Royal Brand Bean Tox 82, Cotton Tox MP82, Security Tox-Sol-6, Security Tox-MP cotton spray, Security Motox 63 cotton spray, Agro-Chem Brand Torbidan 28, and Dr Roger's TOXENE.\n\n"}

Christ Church lay on the corner of Church Street and Cowper Street, on the boundary between the two villages, and it seems reasonable that the church authorities should use this name to describe them.\n\nFor administrative purposes, Bradford village was originally part of the Salford Hundred in the County Palatine of Lancaster. It is bordered by Miles Platting to the north and the River Medlock and the Ashton Canal both run through it. The village name is ancient and in 1196 it was known as \"Bradeford\", meaning \"broad ford\". Until the Industrial Revolution, Bradford Village was rural with woodland, pastures and streams. It is reported that wolves and eagles once inhabited the woodlands and that honey production was part of the local economy.\n\nBradford Village also formed part of the Parish of Manchester but it was still an independent township having its own parochial offices under the Manchester churchwardens. In 1841 all this changed and the township became a member of the Manchester Union of Poor Law Guardians, which was established under the Poor Law Amendment Act of 1841. From the 13 April 1850, until its incorporation into the township of North Manchester in 1896, the village was a member of the Prestwich Union, constituted by order of the Poor Law Board in 1850. The Local Board was set up in 1863, under the Public Health Act of 1848.\n\nSince the days of the Tudors (1485–1603), sufficient coal was mined at the village to supply most of the needs of Manchester but with the onset of the Industrial Revolution Bradford Colliery, as it was then known, was rapidly expanded to provide fuel to power steam engines in the new cotton mills that were springing up in the district. With the coming of the Ashton Canal in 1797, the colliery was connected to it by means of a private branch.\n\nThis canal branch also served the other large employer in Bradford Village, Richard Johnson & Nephew (Bradford Ironworks), who manufactured wire of all kinds.\n\nIn 1871, the owner of Bradford Colliery was R.T. Parker and the occupier, for rate purposes, was T.& C. Livesey. When deeper pit shafts were sunk, seams of fireclay were discovered and consequently a brickworks was built on the north side of the site to manufacture firebricks for use in lining furnaces. The brickworks had the same owner and occupier as Bradford Colliery. By 1896, the pit manager was H.L. Ward and the under-manager was George Bentley. At that time there were 404 underground workers and 125 surface workers. Four types of coal were mined: gas coal, household coal, manufacturing coal and steam coal. The brickworks was still operational in 1896 but by this time it was owned by Edward Williams. However, the only employees were three underground workers still extracting clay and two surface workers and this indicates a decline in the local firebrick manufacturing industry. Bradford Colliery remained open until September 1968 when it closed; not because its supply of coal was exhausted, but because of the subsidence that would have been caused by the exploitation of new coal seams.\n\nIn 1869, a giant gasholder or gasometer was built at the new Bradford Gas Works and this, along with the adjacent colliery, ironworks and cotton mills, was a dominant feature of the landscape.\n\nBeswick village is also ancient and around 1200–30 it was known as \"Bexwic\", believed to be a combination of a personal name and a settlement or dwelling place. The River Medlock and the Ashton Canal both run through it.\n\nBeswick village was originally smaller than Bradford village and it became part of the township of Manchester in 1838, being joined with Ardwick to form a municipal ward in the new township. For poor law purposes it was added to the Prestwich Poor Law Union, which was constituted by order of the Poor Law Board in 1850. In 1896 it was among the townships consolidated to form the township of North Manchester for Poor Law purposes.\n\nAt the height of the Industrial Revolution there was less industry here than in Bradford village and consequently back-to-back terraced houses abounded everywhere. Two open spaces were the David Lewis Play Ground and Bradford Recreation Ground.\n\nPhilips Park is on the south side of the River Medlock, and Philips Park Cemetery is on the north side.\n\nThe park has the distinction of being Manchester's original public park and Mark Philips, who was the Member of Parliament for Manchester, opened it in 1846. It was the first of its kind in Britain and it set the standard for many others that soon followed in towns and cities throughout Britain. It was designed to have walks, expansive lakes and glasshouses for exotic plants. It is also famous for its annual Tulip Festival, which is still held every year.\n\nPhilips Park Cemetery was opened in 1863.\n"}

His career began with gags published in \"Spirou\" magazine in 1987, and the character \"Victor\" which started appearing in 1988.\n\nAt first struggling to find publication, the series \"Titeuf\" was initially published in the fanzine \"Sauve qui peut\" (\"\"Escape those who can\"\") before it was noticed by Glénat executive Jean-Claude Camano. Zep joined Glénat in 1992, and first \"Titeuf\" book \"Dieu, le sexe et les bretelles\" (\"God, Sex And Suspenders\") appeared in 1993 and sold only a few thousand copies, but the following books have gradually won over a huge readership, outselling traditional French favorites such as \"Astérix\" and \"Lucky Luke\". Today 11 million copies of the series have been sold, and the series is considered the greatest moneymaker in the French comics market. \"Titeuf\" books have been translated into 15 languages, including Chinese, Italian and German. In the UK, Titeuf appeared under the name \"Tootuff\" in \"The Dandy\".\n\nThe name \"Titeuf\" ostensibly derives from French \"tête d'oeuf\" (egg-head), but it could also be the familiar, contracted and inverted (verlan) form of \"petite fête\" (little party).\n\nZep designed the album cover of Jean-Jacques Goldman's record \"Chanson pour les pieds\" (2001).\n\n\n\n"}

It is owned by the City of Waco.\n\nThe airport is a 15-20 minute drive from downtown and central Waco.\n\nWaco Regional Airport covers and has two asphalt runways: 1/19 is 7,107 x 150 ft and 14/32 is 5,103 x 150 ft.\n\nIn 2006 the airport had 36,011 aircraft operations, averaging 98 per day: 65% general aviation, 27% air taxi, 8% military and 1% airline. 100 aircraft are based at the airport: 53% single-engine, 38% multi-engine, 6% jet and 3% helicopter.\n\nThe airport has 2 jetways with 3 gates in use, with Envoy Air and SkyWest Airlines service to Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport. The Aerodrome Cafe is located inside the terminal building.\n\nAs of January 2019, Waco Regional Airport is host to two full service FBOs: Texas Aero and Waco Jet Center. Flight training at Waco Regional is provided by Master the Tailwheel, which specializes in initial tailwheel training and endorsements.\n\nWaco Regional Airport's history begins in 1941 when some grazing farmland was chosen for the new Waco Municipal Airport. Construction began in late summer 1941.\n\nIn early 1942 the War Department leased the site and it was provided to the United States Army Air Forces for a training airfield. At the time, construction consisted of three runways partly completed. The Army Air Force began to rush the project to completion and changed the civil building plans to that of a military airfield and ground station. Barracks, mess halls, a hospital, church, theater, administrative buildings, aircraft hangars and a control tower were built. The facility was initially named China Springs Army Air Field and later Waco Army Air Field No. 2 before being renamed Blackland Army Airfield after the local black soil.\n\nBlackland AAF was activated on 2 July 1942, initially being a glider training school. The AAF brought a nucleus of experienced airmen from other airfields in the AAF Gulf Coast Training Center, and then civilian specialists were recruited from around the United States to supplement the military garrison. The civilian workers were instructed in Army aviation procedures and to fill hundreds of jobs necessary to support the pilot training program.\n\nIn October 1942 the Army Air Force Pilot School (Advanced Twin-Engine) was activated (phase 3 pilot training). On 8 January 1943, the War Department constituted and activated the 33d Flying Training Wing (Advanced Twin-Engine) at Blackland and assigned it to the AAF Central Flying Training Command. The school used a number of two-engine trainers, including the Cessna AT-17 Bobcat, Curtiss-Wright AT-9, Beechcraft AT-10 Wichita, and TB-25 Mitchell.\n\nThe school's mission was to train cadets to fly twin-engine transports and bombers in a nine-week course. During training flight training was combined with ground school classes including radio navigation, aircraft and naval identification, armament, photo interpretation, weather forecasting and other courses. Several hours of instruction were taught in the ground-based Link Trainers. Pilot wings were awarded upon graduation and were sent on to group combat training by First, Second, Third or Fourth Air Force. Graduates were usually graded as Flight Officers (Warrant Officers); cadets who graduated at the top of their class were graded as Second Lieutenants.\n\nFlying training at the airfield ended on 4 February 1945 and it became a sub-base of Waco Army Airfield. The field became inactive on October 31, 1945. By 1950 the facility was disposed of by the War Assets Administration (WAA) and deeded to the local government, being operated as Waco Municipal Airport. Some buildings were used as a public housing project.\n\nThe first airline flights were on Braniff, which had been flying to the previous Waco airport since the 1930s. Pioneer arrived in 1947; successor Continental and Braniff pulled out in 1963. Trans-Texas DC-3s appeared in 1956 and left in 1959, then returned in 1963; Texas International's last Convair 600 left in 1978.\n\n\n\n"}

It centers on Maddie Hayes (Cybill Shepherd), a former model who loses most of her financial assets due to her accountant's embezzlement but unexpectedly finds that she owns a detective agency. She teams up with cocky, chauvinistic investigator David Addison (Bruce Willis) to run the agency and becomes embroiled in various unusual cases. The show's other regular characters are Agnes DiPesto (Allyce Beasley), the agency's receptionist, and Herbert Viola (Curtis Armstrong), one of the agency's investigators, who was introduced in the third season and became a featured character in the fourth season. The show mixes drama, comedy and romance, and often incorporates fantasy sequences or breaks the fourth wall.\n\nThe series premiered on ABC in the United States with a feature-length pilot episode on March 3, 1985. The series lasted 5 seasons, but only 66 episodes were produced, a low figure for American television, for which a full season normally includes at least 22 episodes. The show became notorious for failing to have a new episode ready to air each week, due to on-set problems including script issues and friction between actors and producers. Most episodes aired on Tuesday nights, although when the show returned in April 1989 after a two-month hiatus, the remaining episodes aired on Sunday nights.\n\nDuring its early years, the series was popular with viewers and broke into the top ten of the Nielsen ratings in its third season. When Maddie and David ended more than two years of sexual tension by sleeping together in that season's highly publicized penultimate episode, \"I Am Curious… Maddie\", it drew an audience of 60 million viewers. The show was also a critical hit, receiving 16 Emmy Award nominations in 1986. Ratings declined, however, in the later seasons, and the show was canceled in 1989.\n\n"}

Gubbeen Farmhouse Products also produce a Smoked Gubbeen.\n\nGubbeen Cheese has been produced since 1979 by Tom and Giana Ferguson at the Gubbeen Farm in Schull, County Cork. The name \"Gubbeen\" is an anglicisation of the Irish word \"Gobín\" which means a small mouthful, and which a local nearby bay is referred to.\n\nAll milk used for the cheese comes from their own herd of dairy cows, which is a mixture of several breeds; British Friesian, Simmenthal, Jersey, and Kerry. The milk is stored in vats to which starter culture and rennet are added, causing the milk to set. This is then cut and stirred until the curds develop. The cheese is developed in curing rooms where the rind is washed daily. This is an important part of the process as the washing gives rise to the distinctive surface bloom and develops the characteristic flavours. The cheese develops deeper flavours as it matures.\n\nIn 2001, a new strain of lactic acid producing bacteria, \"Microbacterium gubbeenense\", was named after a study into the smear-ripening of Gubbeen cheese.\n\nEach cheese is in diameter, in height, weighs and has a fat content of 48%.

The Onega connects Lake Lacha with the Onega Bay in the White Sea southwest of Arkhangelsk, flowing in the northern direction. The discharge at the source is and at the mouth is . The river is long, and the area of its basin . Its main tributaries are the Voloshka (right), the Kena (left), the Mosha (right), the Kodina (right), and the Kozha (left). The major tributary of the Lake Lacha is the Svid.\n\nThe name of the river is traditionally explained as related to Finnish \"Enojoki\" - the main river, stream.\n\nIn terms of both area of the basin and the average discharge, the Onega is the third river basin of the White Sea (behind the Northern Dvina and the Mezen. The river basin of the Onega is spread over the west of Arkhangelsk Oblast, north-west of Vologda Oblast, and also includes minor areas in the east of Republic of Karelia. The Onega basin includes some of the biggest lakes of Arkhangelsk and Vologda Oblasts, such as Lake Vozhe, Lake Lacha, Lake Lyokshmozero, Lake Kenozero, Lake Undozero, and Lake Kozhozero, as well as Kenozersky National Park.\n\nThe whole valley of the Onega is populated, with the exception of the stretch between Severoonezhsk and Yarnema, in Plesetsky District. There are two towns located on the river Onega, Kargopol close to its source and Onega in its mouth. There are also two urban-type settlements, located opposite to each other in the middle course of the river, Oksovsky (right bank) and Severoonezhsk (left bank). of the river's lower course, between the village of Gorodok and the selo of Porog, is listed in the State Water Register of Russia as navigable. The rest of the Onega is notable for the rapids, spread everywhere between Kargopol and Gorodok, and also located downstream from Porog (the name \"Porog\" means \"a rapid\").\n\nThe Onega basin area has an important historical and cultural significance. Kargopol is one of the oldest cities in Russian North (the traditional foundation date in the 12th century, first mentioned in the 14th century), and it still contains a big number of architectural and historical monuments. Oshevensk on the left bank of the Onega is the location of the former Alexandro-Oshevensky Monastery. Another historically important monastery in the Onega basin is the Kozheozersky Monastery on an island in the Lake Kozheozero. Some of the finest monuments of the northern wooden architecture are located in the basin of the Onega, including ensembles of Lyadiny, Saunino Pogost, Krasnaya Lyaga, and Bolzhaya Shalga. These monuments also suffer from the lack of protection and their number steadily diminishes. In fact, the majority of them have been lost.\n\nThe river splits into the Big Onega and Little Onega from its estuary, but then these branches join again, forming a big flat island.\n\nIt freezes up in late October - early December and stays under the ice until mid-April - May. It was used for timber rafting.\n\nThe Onega flows among the coniferous forests (taiga of spruce, pine, and larch), mostly among the swamps.\nThere are only four bridges across the Onega: one in Kargopol on the road connecting Kargopol to Nyandoma, one in the village of Sorokinskaya, on \"Onezhsky Trakt\", the road connecting Kargopol to Plesetsk and Yemetsk, one combined road and railway bridge connecting Oksovsky and Severoonezhsk, and one railway bridge in Porog on the railway from Arkhangelsk to Belomorsk (no road traffic). Elsewhere, including the former district center of Konyovo, the Onega can only be traversed by ferry crossings.\n"}
{"id": "2144587", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2144587", "title": "Bema", "text": "Bema\n\nThe bema, or bima, is an elevated platform used as an orator's podium in ancient Athens. In Jewish synagogues, it is also known as a bimah and is for Torah reading during services. In an Orthodox Jewish synagogue, a bema is the raised area around the \"aron kodesh\", or the sanctuary. In antiquity it was made of stone, but in modern times it is usually a rectangular wooden platform approached by steps.\n\nThe Ancient Greek \"bēma\" () means both 'platform' and 'step', being derived from \"bainein\" (, 'to go'). The original use of the bema in Athens was as a tribunal from which orators addressed the citizens as well as the courts of law, for instance, in the Pnyx. In Greek law courts the two parties to a dispute presented their arguments each from separate bemas.\n\nBy metonymy, bema was also a place of judgement, being the extension of the raised seat of the judge, as described in the New Testament, in and , and further, as the seat of the Roman emperor, in , and of God, in , when speaking in judgment.\n\nThe \"bimah\" (Hebrew plural: \"bimot\") in synagogues is also known as the \"almemar\" or \"almemor\" among some Ashkenazim (from the Arabic, \"al-minbar\", meaning 'platform').\n\nThe post-Biblical Hebrew \"bima\" (), 'platform' or 'pulpit', is almost certainly derived from the Ancient Greek word for a raised platform, \"bema\" (). (A proposed link to the Biblical Hebrew \"bama\" (), 'high place' is far less likely.)\n\nAmong the Sephardim, it is known as a \"tevah\" (literally 'box, case' in Hebrew) or \"migdal-etz\" ('tower of wood').\n\nIt is typically elevated by two or three steps, as was the \"bimah\" in the Temple. At the celebration of the Shavuot holiday when synagogues are decorated with flowers, many synagogues have special arches that they place over the \"bimah\" and adorn with floral displays. The importance of the \"bimah\" is to show that the reader is the most important at that moment in time, and to make it easier to hear their reader of the Torah. A raised bimah will typically have a railing. This was a religious requirement for safety in bimah more than 10 handbreadths high, or between . A lower bimah (even one step) will typically have a railing as a practical measure to prevent someone from inadvertently stepping off.\n\nThe bimah became a standard fixture in synagogues from which a portion (\"parashah\") from the Torah and the haftarah are read. In Orthodox Judaism, the bimah is located in the center of the synagogue, separate from the Ark. In other branches of Judaism, the bimah and the Ark are joined together.\n\nThe ceremonial use of a bema carried over from Judaism into early Christian church architecture. It was originally a raised platform with a lectern and seats for the clergy, from which lessons from the Scriptures were read and the sermon was delivered. In Western Christianity the bema developed over time into the chancel (or presbytery) and the pulpit.\n\nIn Eastern Christianity \"bema\" remains the name of the platform which composes the sanctuary; it consists of both the area behind the iconostasion and the platform in front of it from which the deacon leads the ektenias (litanies) together with the ambo from which the priest delivers the sermon and distributes Holy Communion. It may be approached by one or several steps. The bema is composed of the altar (the area behind the iconostasion), the \"soleas\" (the pathway in front of the iconostasion), and the \"ambo\" (the area in front of the Holy Doors which projects westward into the nave). Orthodox laity do not normally step up onto the bema except to receive Holy Communion.\n\n"}

{"id": "2144621", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2144621", "title": "Pete Browning", "text": "Pete Browning\n\nLouis Rogers Browning (June 17, 1861 – September 10, 1905), nicknamed \"Gladiator\", was an American professional baseball center fielder and left fielder. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) from 1882 to 1894. He played primarily for the Louisville Eclipse/Colonels, becoming one of the sport's most accomplished batters of the 1880s.\n\nA three-time batting champion, he finished among the top three hitters in the league in each of his first seven years; only twice in his eleven full seasons did he finish lower than sixth. During the era before 1893, when the pitching distance was lengthened from 50 feet to 60 feet 6 inches, Browning ranked third among all major league players in career batting average, and fifth in slugging average. His .341 lifetime batting average remains one of the highest in major league history, and among the top five by a right-handed batter; his .345 average over eight American Association seasons was the highest mark by any player during that league's 10-year existence.\n\nNicknamed the \"Louisville Slugger\", he was enormously attentive to the bats he used, and was the first player to have them custom-made, establishing a practice among hitters which continues to the present. Playing in spite of serious medical afflictions which rendered him virtually deaf and subjected him to massive headaches, he resorted to alcohol to subdue the pain, but continued to hit well even as his drinking increased. He was also known as \"The Gladiator\", though sources differ as to whether the nickname applied to his struggles with ownership, the press, his drinking problem, or particularly elusive fly balls.\n\nBorn in Louisville, Kentucky, Browning was the youngest of eight children. His father, a grocer, was killed by a tornado when Browning was thirteen years old. Young Pete remained with his mother, ultimately living in the house where he had grown up until the day he died.\n\nHe displayed considerable athletic prowess from an early age, and in 1877 began playing for a local semipro team, the Louisville Eclipse, and pitched an exhibition win against a National League team. He continued with the Eclipse into 1882, when the franchise became a member of the newly formed American Association, the first major league to rival the NL.\n\nBrowning quickly distinguished himself as an exceptional slugger. He led the league in both batting (.378) and slugging (.510) in its first season, also finishing in the top five in home runs, runs, hits and total bases. He was consistently among the league's top batters through 1888, winning a second batting crown in 1885 and hitting .402 in 1887. In 1884, he acquired his first custom-made bat from the Hillerich & Bradsby company, collecting three hits in his first game using it and beginning a baseball tradition.\n\nTwice in the decade, he hit for the cycle: on August 8, 1886, and again on June 7, 1889. He also led the league in hits, total bases and on-base percentage in 1885. After suffering from mastoiditis from a young age, which caused him to lose his hearing and embarrassed him into avoiding school, resulting in essential illiteracy, he underwent the first of several surgeries to alleviate the condition in 1884, though the problem would afflict him throughout his career.\n\nOther aspects of Browning's game were less polished; he has usually been regarded as one of the worst fielders in major league history, although some recent assessments have begun to question that view. \"American Gladiator\", his first biography, recounted numerous \"web gems\" by Browning from the beginning of his career to the very end. The revised assessment is that Browning was a superb outfielder when he was sober and not suffering from the effects of mastoiditis, a serious infection of the inner ear usually contracted during childhood.\n\nAfter being used primarily as an infielder in his first three seasons, playing every position except catcher over that span, he was shifted to the outfield on a permanent basis in 1885. While the inferior equipment of the time is somewhat of a mitigating factor, Browning's playing record presented various evidence against any hidden defensive prowess. So did his unusual habit of playing the infield while standing on one leg, which he claimed to have adopted in order to avoid collisions with other players; however, some sources have noted that his probable rationale was to gain an advantage against baserunners he could not hear by aiming one leg toward them, and that he continued to do so in the outfield because he couldn't hear his teammates on either side. An oft-reported story, possibly apocryphal, features one of Browning's managers claiming that the team would be better off with a wooden statue of an Indian in the outfield, since there was at least a slim chance that a batted ball might strike the statue and rebound back in the direction of the field. Indeed, he led league outfielders in errors in both 1886 and 1887. Browning's baserunning was also considered sub-par, exacerbated by his refusal to slide.\n\nBrowning lost his appetite for playing in Louisville during a hellish 1889 season. That year, the luckless franchise (by now known as the Colonels) finished last in the league with 27 wins and 111 losses, 66.5 games behind the top club. The season included not only a major league record 26-game losing streak, but also a narrow escape from the Johnstown Flood and the sport's first-ever strike. In the dispute, Browning was one of six players who refused to take the field as a protest against a series of heavy fines assessed by team owner Mordecai Davidson. The game took place as scheduled with the assistance of three local amateurs, and the striking players returned to work before the next contest. Browning finished the season with a .256 average, the first time he was not among the league's top three hitters. He left the American Association after eight seasons with a .345 career average, which would stand as the best mark by any player with more than one season in the league; Tip O'Neill ranks second at .343.\n\nAs a result of these events, as well as other labor disputes throughout the sport, Browning — along with nearly all the game's stars — chose to jump to the Players' League for the 1890 season, and played for the Cleveland Infants. The American Association had long been considered inferior to the NL, but in that season Browning proved that he was indeed among the game's top hitters by winning his third batting title with a .373 mark. The league dissolved after its sole season, and Browning spent the remaining four years of his career bouncing around between franchises in the NL. He spent time with the Pittsburgh Pirates (1891) and Cincinnati Reds (1891–92), then was back with the Colonels, who had joined the NL in a league merger (1892–93), before ending his major-league career in 1894 with a handful of appearances for the St. Louis Browns and Brooklyn Bridegrooms in the National League. (He began the 1894 season playing minor-league ball for \"Kelly's Killers\" of Allentown, Pa. in the Pennsylvania State League. The team was managed by future Hall-of-Famer Mike \"King\" Kelly.)\n\nHis last professional season was in 1896 with the Columbus Buckeyes in the Western League.\n\nIn the years before 1893, among players with at least 2500 career at bats, his batting average of .341 ranked behind only Dan Brouthers (.343) and Dave Orr (.342), with his slugging mark of .467 trailing only those of Brouthers (.520), Orr (.502), Roger Connor (.488) and Sam Thompson (.468). His recognized career hit total through 1893 ranked 10th in major league history to that point. Brouthers, a five-time champion, was the only other major league player to win more than two batting titles in the 19th century.\n\nBrowning was tormented for his entire life by mastoiditis, which can result in deafness, vertigo, facial palsy, and brain damage. As a result, he lost his hearing at a young age, and was faced with frequent bouts of crippling head pain. The deafness had led Browning to drop out of school at an early age, so that he went through life as a virtual illiterate, and in order to deaden the physical pain resulting from his condition, he began drinking heavily in his youth. The drinking quickly spiraled out of control; he often appeared on the field while drunk, and was suspended for the final two months of the 1889 season for drunkenness, along with other shorter suspensions at different times. He was unable to stop, however, frequently stating, \"I can't hit the ball until I hit the bottle.\"\n\nBrowning was a man of eccentric personal habits, particularly in relation to his bats. He spoke to them, and gave each one a name, often that of a Biblical figure. In the belief that any individual bat contained only a certain number of hits, he would periodically \"retire\" bats, keeping vast numbers of the retired ones in the home he shared with his mother. These bats were 37 inches long and 48 ounces in weight, enormous even by the standards of the time. He also habitually stared at the sun, thinking that by doing so, he would strengthen his eyes. He also \"cleansed\" his eyes when travelling by train by sticking his head out the window in an effort to catch cinders in them. Browning also computed his average on his cuffs on a regular basis, and was not above announcing to all when his train arrived at a depot that he was the champion batter of the American Association.\n\nHe remained a lifelong bachelor, though his affection for prostitutes was a matter of much discussion in the newspapers. He was the uncle of film director Tod Browning.\n\nAfter his retirement as a player, Browning worked as a cigar salesman and owned a bar, which ultimately failed; but his physical condition continued to deteriorate due to the mastoiditis and resulting complications. He remained a popular Louisville figure until June 7, 1905, when he was declared insane and committed to a local asylum (Lakeland). A sister released him two weeks later, but a month after that, he was in the hospital, suffering from a general physical collapse.\n\nHe died in Louisville on September 10 of that year at age 44. The specific cause of death was listed as asthenia (a weakening of the body), a cover-all medical term used by doctors of that time. However, he no doubt suffered from a wide variety of serious physical complaints. In addition to the mastoiditis, he was afflicted with cancer, advanced cirrhosis of the liver, alcohol-related brain damage, and according to some sources, paresis. Some sources erroneously report that he died in an insane asylum; he was in Lakeland Asylum a short time before he died. He is buried in historic Cave Hill Cemetery in Louisville.\n\nBrowning was an important figure in baseball's history. In addition to his accomplishments as a player, which have made him a popular candidate for the Baseball Hall of Fame, his legacy is expressed in the game in other ways as well. Browning is probably best remembered today as the inspiration behind the Hillerich & Bradsby company's popular \"Louisville Slugger\" line of baseball bats. He was the first player to purchase a bat from the company, and they adopted the name a few years later to honor his patronage and capitalize on his fame.\n\nBrowning's decision to sign with Pittsburgh in 1891 is noteworthy, as this transaction helped cement the team's new nickname of \"Pirates\". When the Players' League collapsed, its members were supposed to return to their franchises from the prior season. Pittsburgh, though, signed several players who were theoretically under the control of other clubs, starting with second baseman Lou Bierbauer. Other franchises decried these acts of \"piracy\", and the name stuck.\n\nThe strike by Browning and his Louisville teammates is also important in that it was the first labor action in what was ultimately a long series of disputes between players and management, prefacing the formation and collapse of the Players' League.\n\nIn 1984, a new grave marker was dedicated for Pete Browning, one that correctly spelled his name and listed all his major baseball achievements. The new marker was the idea of Philip Von Borries, who wrote the copy for the new marker and who also co-designed the marker. The ceremonies, jointly held by the city of Louisville and the Hillerich & Bradsby Company, came during the company's centennial celebration of their famed Louisville Slugger bat (of which Browning is the namesake).\n\nThere was a Browning's Restaurant & Brewery adjacent to Louisville Slugger Field.\n\nThe Nineteenth Century Committee of the Society for American Baseball Research named Browning the Overlooked 19th Century Baseball Legend for 2009 — a 19th-century player, manager, executive or other baseball personality not yet inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York.\n\n\n\n"}

Nassour's modern Art Deco-styled projection room and modern offices were located in the buildings fronting Sunset Boulevard.\n\nDressing rooms were constructed adjacent to stages 1 and 2. An old converted two story apartment building located down the street on Van Ness housed producers and writers. The big stage (4) had removable panels that hid a water tank. It was used to film the jungle river scenes in \"Africa Screams\" (1949). The lot was very small (about four acres) so an underground facility for storage was necessary. A large freight elevator was installed for access.\n\nIn 1950 the Nassour brothers sold their studio to the Times Mirror Company, publisher of the \"Los Angeles Times\". Times-Mirror was looking for a facility to permanently house KTTV (channel 11), its new television station (at the time, owned jointly with CBS) which commenced broadcasting the previous year. The facility was later renamed KTTV Studios.\n\nThe New York City-based firm Metromedia purchased the property along with KTTV in 1963. In 1967 Metromedia undertook an extensive renovation and expansion of the facility, which included a new office tower and building housing various Metromedia enterprises, including the Harlem Globetrotters, the Ice Capades, the Foster & Kleisler advertising firm and Wolper Productions, the latter of which was purchased by the company in 1964. The renovation also brought about a name change, from KTTV Studios to Metromedia Square. Los Angeles radio stations KLAC and KMET (now KTWV), which Metromedia purchased in separate 1963 and 1965 transactions, moved there in 1976.\n\nTelevision producer Norman Lear moved into the property in 1973 and headquartered his company, Tandem Productions, in the building. Lear started videotaping his television series here in the fall of 1975, including but not limited to: \"All in the Family\"; \"Diff'rent Strokes\"; \"The Jeffersons\"; \"Maude\"; \"Good Times\"; \"Hello, Larry\"; \"One Day at a Time\"; and \"The Facts of Life\". One of his other classic shows, \"Sanford and Son\", remained taped at NBC Studios in Burbank; its 1980 revival, \"Sanford\", was videotaped at Metromedia. Shows such as \"Diff'rent Strokes\", \"The Facts of Life\", \"One Day at a Time\", and \"The Jeffersons\" later relocated to Universal City Studios by 1982.\n\nIn 1986, Metromedia sold most of its television interests to News Corporation, and KTTV became a cornerstone station of the new Fox Broadcasting Company. As a result, the studios became the Fox Television Center, though Metromedia continued to own the building and the land on which it was situated, leasing the property to Fox and KTTV. \n\nThe Fox Broadcasting Company launch announcement was made from the property, and on October 9, 1986, the flagship show was broadcast live, \"The Late Show Starring Joan Rivers\". Shows like the Metromedia and then Fox-produced \"Small Wonder\" and NBC's \"Saved by the Bell\" as well as the sketch comedy series \"In Living Color\", and the first season of \"MAD TV\" were among the last series to be taped at this complex. Ironically, very few Fox television shows were actually taped at the Fox Television Center. The direct-to-syndication seasons (1986-1990) of \"Mama's Family\" were also filmed here.\n\nKTTV and the Fox network operations moved to their own new building (the present-day Fox Television Center) in West Los Angeles in 1996, which is the corporate home of the Fox Television Stations group. Meanwhile, the radio stations' studios remained there, even long after they were no longer owned by Metromedia. KTWV moved to new studios in Culver City in 1997, and then Miracle Mile neighborhood on L.A.'s Wilshire Boulevard on February 18, 1995. KLAC eventually became acquired by Clear Channel Communications (now iHeartMedia) and moved to studios shared with Clear Channel's other AM stations, which are now located in Burbank.\n\nThe Fox Broadcasting Company, which had maintained some business offices at the 20th Century Fox studios in Los Angeles' Century City neighborhood while at the Television Center, moved its complete base of operations to the Century City studio lot shortly after the KTTV move. This new facility, known as the Fox Network Center, is the home to the network's live studio productions, such as \"Fox NFL Sunday\".\n\nMetromedia sold the land to the Los Angeles Unified School District in 2000. The building was demolished by the school district in 2003. Replacing the old studios is Helen Bernstein High School, a campus which opened in 2008.\n\n\n"}

North of Whitehall, the M1 motorway begins at its junction with the M50, past the Dublin Port Tunnel's northern entrance. The area is adjacent to the major public Beaumont Hospital and to Dublin City University on Collins Avenue.\n\nWhitehall takes its name from a house named White Hall, formerly located to the south of the village on Drumcondra Road Upper. The area commonly known as Whitehall Cross, at the intersection of the Swords Road (R132) (north-south) and Collins Avenue (east-west), is in the townland of Clonturk, and was formerly the site of a public house called \"The Thatch\", whose memory is preserved in the name of a nearby road.\n\nWhitehall College of Further Education is situated on the old site of Whitehall House. Whitehall College was originally named Whitehall House Secretarial School when it was established in 1970 but has since changed its name to Whitehall College of Further Education to reflects its provision of courses. The college has moved to Mobhi Road from its Swords Road building.\n\nOther most notable features in the area are\n\nPlunket College of Further Education, \nSt. Aidan's Christian Brothers School (whose past pupils include the former Irish Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern and the international footballer Liam Brady), \nand the Holy Child Girls national school, designed by Robinson and Keefe Architects.\nThe Holy Child boys National School is a similar building designed by the same Architects. Margret Aylward School is a girls secondary school beside Ellenfield park and Whitehall church.\n\nThe Roman Catholic \"Church of the Holy Child\", parish of Whitehall-Larkhill-Santry (often called Whitehall Church) is a large redbrick church designed by John Robinson of Robinson Keefe and Devane Architects which is a well-known landmark to travellers on the N1. The tower, when viewed from Home Farm, is carefully located to stand on the top of a hill on the axis of the road leaving the city. This church is similar in many respects to Galway Cathedral designed by the same Architect. Before the opening of the Church in Whitehall, the area was served by a temporary church in Larkhill, known as the \"Tin Church\".\n\nNational sporting interests are represented by Whitehall Colmcille GAA club from which former All Ireland medal winners Tommy Drumm, Paul Clarke, Paddy Moran and Declan McGrath emanated from. The club is the largest juvenile sporting body in the community here providing Gaelic football, ladies football, Hurling and Camogie to girls and boys from 4 yrs of age up to adult. The area also houses the home ground of prominent junior football club Home Farm F.C., and St. Kevin's Boys F.C., the schoolboy club for which Liam Brady, Ian Harte, Stephen Carr and Damien Duff played. Whitehall is also the site for one of the interchanges for the Dublin Port Tunnel with the M1. Dubliners band member Luke Kelly also lived in Whitehall and there is a stone in the area dedicated to him.\nWhitehall Colmcille's Clubhouse on Collin's Ave, was a former tennis club (Thorndale), and the club uses Ellenfield Park for its games, the Club have developed new pitches at Whitehall Cross on land formerly a farm but was used for the construction of the Port Tunnel.\n\nWhitehall Rangers A.F.C. are a soccer club in the area. Whitehall Rangers Ladies are playing intermediate football. Whitehall Celtic is a football club which is an Athletic Union League team based in from the area.\n\nDublin Archers practice in Plunket College grounds in Whitehall.\n\nThe Whitehall Stadium is in Whitehall, Dublin, which borders Drumcondra and is home to the club Home Farm.\n\nThe Whitehall Grand Cinema opened in July 1954 on Collins Ave., seating 1000 patrons, it was used as a bingo while still a cinema, it ceased functioning as a cinema in 1974, and was purchased by Gael Linn who operated it as a bingo hall. It still serves as a bingo hall to this day.\n\nIn the aftermath of the killing of Michael Collins on 25 August 1922 an atrocity occurred. Two Anti-Treaty Republicans Alfie (Leo) Colley (18), and Sean Cole (17), members of Fianna Éireann, were abducted by Free State forces at the North Strand. Witnesses saw them being shot dead at 'The Thatch', Puck's Lane or Yellow Lane, (now Yellow Road) in Whitehall. There is a small commemoration stone on Yellow Road to Cole and Colley.\n\nAnother site in Whitehall from the Civil war is the Memorial stone to Martin Hogan on Grace Park Road whose body was found dumped there on the 22 August 1923.\n\n"}

{"id": "2144702", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2144702", "title": "Viva Variety", "text": "Viva Variety\n\nViva Variety is an American sketch comedy series that aired on Comedy Central from April 1997 to December 1999. The series satirizes European variety shows.\n\nThe show stars Thomas Lennon as Meredith Laupin, Kerri Kenney as the former Mrs. (Agatha) Laupin, and Michael Ian Black as \"your cool-ass pal\" Johnny Blue Jeans. In addition to comedy sketches, the show featured musical guests and various performers, including Ben Stiller. Periodically, a troupe of women called “The Swimsuit Squad” would dance much like the “Fly Girls” on \"In Living Color\".\n\nThe show's premise was derived from a sketch from \"The State\" called \"The Mr. and Former Mrs. Laupin Variety Program,\" and the show featured many people who were a part of the comedy troupe.\n\nThough Mr. Laupin, the former Mrs. Laupin, and Johnny Blue Jeans were themselves characters, the show did not use recurring characters or feature impersonations. Often, the troupe would address or involve the audience directly; in one theme of this vein, Mr. Laupin and the former Mrs. Laupin would do an old-fashioned plug for their fake sponsor during actual airtime.\n\nOne in particular had the former Mrs. Laupin asking consumers to ignore or fix errors on their sponsor's products, including a cereal, “Sweety Balls,” in which the second \"e\" was replaced with an \"a.\"\n\nThe other common sketch theme was a game show with an odd premise, such as “Plant or Animal,” where an audience member was asked to attribute a few seconds-long recording to either an animal or Robert Plant. This proved more difficult than one might anticipate.\n\nAnother sketch of this style was “Klingon or Galliano,” where an audience member was shown runway models in various outfits and was asked if they were wearing costumes for Klingons from the science fiction series \"Star Trek\" or made by fashion designer John Galliano. This also proved more difficult than one might anticipate. The participant's consolation prize of a tribble coat, presented by an allergic Johnny Blue Jeans, made light of Galliano's controversial use of fur.\n\nOn January 29, 2011, at the Eureka Theatre in San Francisco, California a two-show reunion of \"Viva Variety\" was held as part of the 10th annual San Francisco Sketchfest. Lennon, Kenney-Silver and Black reunited for a live, on-stage performance of \"Viva Variety,\" with a guest appearance by \"State\" alumnus Robert Ben Garant. These sold out shows included video highlights from the original show on the \"jumbotron\" and new, improvised material by the cast.\n\nSkits included: a game of \"Thomas vs. George\", where an audience member had to guess which Jefferson was being described, Johnny Blue Jeans ranked the \"Police Academy\" movies in order of cinematic importance, Mr. Laupin pretended to surf while letting inappropriate joke waves pass by, and the former Mrs. Laupin sold Perma-ham as only she can.\n\n"}

A stereo consolette (as identified by one of its manufacturers from that period, \"Delmonico/Nivico\") is a smaller, more compact stereo console that often stands on splayed legs. The corresponding term for console in British English is radiogram.\n\nDuring the 1970s, some stereo manufacturers began designing more lavish and flashy systems to coincide with the psychedelic and disco eras from that decade. Such as was the case when the New York stereo manufacturer \"Morse-Electro Products\" produced some of their units with a built-in light organ display. The multicolored lights in the display would flash to the rhythm of the music being played on the system.\n\nStereo consoles would ultimately be replaced by high-fidelity component stereo systems with separate speakers (sometimes called \"rack systems\") in the late 1970s, which offered much higher performance without being attached to furniture or being tied to one brand of equipment. Some of these systems had speakers with removable covers, exposing the woofer and tweeter. Production of these systems continued throughout the 1980s and well into the 1990s, until smaller, table-top or countertop units (such as the Bose Wave System) began dominating.\n\nA console television is a television set housed into a cabinet in the same manner as a stereo console. Production of console televisions lasted much longer than stereo consoles, with units manufactured throughout the 1980s and into the 1990s before being replaced by flat-screen televisions.\n\nHome entertainment centers may be attached to high-fidelity stereo or quadraphonic speakers. By the 2000s, the best sound systems were designed for home theater and movie sound. It typically includes more than just the left and right stereo channels. Television and VHS typically encodes extra channels onto the two main channels, while digital modes encode this information into the digital DVD source data, with center, two rear, and a subwoofer speakers. The difficulty is usually in wiring and placing the rear speakers and the necessity of buying a receiver that can decode the sound. As the size of video monitors has increased, rather than having a 20-inch TV surrounded by massive stereo equipment, it is common to have a very large flat or projection screen with a small and integrated DVD player / receiver and satellite or digital cable receiver underneath, with small remote speakers and a moderate sized subwoofer.\n\nThe audio and video components have special connectors which are often hooked to a dedicated box. The items are then plugged into an electrical outlet strip, which should have a surge protector. Each component typically has its own remote control, though expensive universal remote controls are available that can learn or are programmed with most common equipment.\n\nThe term \"home entertainment center\" may also refer to the complete package – the electronic components and the unit in which they are housed. The unit is often either an armoire or a self-contained unit (usually of wood and glass); they often contain dedicated areas (either drawers or other spaces) for storage of records, videotapes, CDs and/or DVDs.\n\nIn many homes, an entertainment center is often placed in the living room, family room, recreation room, or bedroom. Perhaps the first example of a built-in entertainment center was created by Frank Lloyd Wright at his 1917 Hollyhock House in Los Angeles, California. Custom cabinetry and speakers may be built into or added to an existing house at some expense over free-standing furniture, and video and / or audio signals wired or wirelessly sent to other rooms in the home by dedicated cables, or over a local area network.\n\nThe term \"home entertainment center\" was widely used in the 1980s. It is being replaced by home theater system for large rooms. While high fidelity previously required large turntables, tape decks and speakers, the changing technology of music formats have made small bookshelf systems, Bose desktop radios and iPod based speaker systems which can also produce music of high quality and serve as music entertainment systems by making large component systems again a niche high-end market.\n\n"}

{"id": "2144715", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2144715", "title": "Aristocracy of Norway", "text": "Aristocracy of Norway\n\nAristocracy of Norway refers to modern and medieval aristocracy in Norway. Additionally, there have been economical, political, and military élites thatrelating to the main lines of Norway's historyare generally accepted as nominal predecessors of the aforementioned. Since the 16th century, modern aristocracy is known as nobility ().\n\nThe very first aristocracy in today's Norway appeared during the Bronze Age (1800 BC500 BC). This bronze aristocracy consisted of several regional élites, whose earliest known existence dates to 1500 BC. Via similar structures in the Iron Age (400 BC793 AD), these entities would reappear as petty kingdoms before and during the Age of Vikings (7931066). Beside a chieftain or petty king, each kingdom had its own aristocracy.\n\nBetween 872 and 1050, during the so-called unification process, the first national aristocracy began to develop. Regional monarchs and aristocrats who recognised King Harald I as their high king, would normally receive vassalage titles like Earl. Those who refused were defeated or chose to migrate to Iceland, establishing an aristocratic, clan-ruled state there. The subsequent lendman aristocracy in Norwaypowerful feudal lords and their familiesruled their respective regions with great autonomy. Their status was by no means equal to that of modern nobles; they were nearly half royal. For example, Ingebjørg Finnsdottir of the Arnmødling dynasty was married to King Malcolm III of Scotland. During the civil war era (11301240) the old lendmen were severely weakened, and many disappeared. This aristocracy was ultimately defeated by King Sverre I and the Birchlegs, subsequently being replaced by supporters of Sverre.\n\nPrimarily between the 9th and 13th centuries, the aristocracy was not limited to mainland Norway, but appeared in and ruled parts of the British Isles as well as Iceland and the Faroe Islands. Kingdoms, city states, and other types of entities, for example the Kingdom of Dublin, were established or possessed either by Norwegians or by native vassals. Other territories, for example Shetland and the Orkney Islands, were directly absorbed into the kingdom. For example, the Earl of Orkney was a Norwegian nobleman.\n\nThe nobilityknown as hird and then as knights and squireswas institutionalised during the formation of the Norwegian state in the 13th century. Originally granted an advisory function as servants of the king, the nobility grew into becoming a great political factor. Their land and their armed forces, and also their legal power as members of the Council of the Realm, made the nobility remarkably independent from the king. At its height, the council had the power to recognise or choose inheritors of or pretenders to the Throne. In 1440, they dethroned King Eric III. The council even chose its own leaders as regents, among others Sigurd Jonsson of Sudreim. This aristocratic power, which also involved the church, lasted until the Reformation, when the king illegally abolished the council in 1536. This would nearly remove all of the nobility's political foundation, leaving them with mainly administrative and ceremonial functions. Subsequent immigration of Danish nobles (who thus became Norwegian nobles) would further marginalise the position of natives. In the 17th century, the old nobility consisted almost entirely of Danes.\n\nAfter 1661, when absolute monarchy was introduced, the old nobility was gradually replaced by a new. This consisted mainly of merchants and officials who had recently been ennobled but also of foreign nobles who were naturalised. Dominant elements in the new nobility were the office nobility (noble status by holding high civilian or military offices) andespecially prominent in the 18th centurythe letter nobility (noble status via letters patent in return for military or artistic achievements or monetary donations). Based on the 1665 \"Lex Regia\", which stated that the king was to be \"revered and considered the most perfect and supreme person on the Earth by all his subjects, standing above all human laws and having no judge above his person, [...] except God alone\", the king had his hands free to develop a new and loyal aristocracy to honour his absolute reign. The nobilities in Denmark and Norway could, likewise, bask in the glory of one of the most monarchial states in Europe. The title of count was introduced in 1671, and in 1709 and 1710, two marquisates (the only ones in Scandinavia) were created. Additionally, hundreds of families were ennobled, i.e., without titles. Demonstrating his omnipotence, the monarch could even revert noble status ab initio, as if ennoblement had never happened, and elevate dead humans to the estate of nobles. A rich aristocratic culture developed during this epoch, for example family names like Gyldenpalm (lit. 'Golden Palm'), Svanenhielm (lit. 'Swan Helm'), and Tordenskiold (lit. 'Thunder Shield'), many of them containing particles like French \"de\" and German \"von\". Likewise, excessive creation of coats of arms boosted heraldic culture and praxis, including visual arts.\n\nThe 1814 Constitution forbade the creation of new nobility, including countships, baronies, family estates, and fee tails. The 1821 Nobility Law initiated a long-range abolition of the nobility as an official estate, a process in which current bearers were allowed to keep their status and possible titles as well as some privileges for the rest of their lifetime. The last legally noble Norwegians died in the early 20th century. Many Norwegians who had noble status in Norway had it in Denmark, too, where they remained officially noble.\n\nDuring the 19th century, members of noble families continued to hold political and social power, for example Severin Løvenskiold as Governor-general of Norway and Peder Anker and Mathias Sommerhielm as Prime Minister. Aristocrats were active in Norway's independence movement in 1905, and it has been claimed the union with Sweden was dissolved thanks to a 'genuinely aristocratic wave'. Fritz Wedel Jarlsberg's personal efforts contributed to Norway gaining sovereignty of the arctic archipelago Svalbard in 1920. From 1912 to 1918, Bredo Henrik von Munthe af Morgenstierne was Rector of the University of Oslo. When Norway co-founded and entered NATO, ambassador Wilhelm Morgenstierne represented the kingdom when US President Truman signed the treaty in 1949. Whilst they now acted as individuals rather than a unified estate, these and many other noblemen played a significant public rôle, mainly until the Second World War (19401945).\n\nToday, Norway has approximately 10-15 families who were formerly recognised as noble by Norwegian kings. These include Anker, Aubert, Falsen, Galtung, Huitfeldt, Knagenhjelm, Løvenskiold, Munthe af Morgenstierne, Treschow, Werenskiold, and the Counts of Wedel-Jarlsberg. In addition, there are nonnoble families who descend patrilineally from individuals who once had personal (nonhereditary) noble status, for example the Paus family and several families of the void \"ab initio\" office nobility. There is even foreign nobility in Norway, mainly Norwegian families originating in other countries and who have or had noble status there.\n\nThe earliest times in today's Norway (c. 10000 BCc. 1800 BC) had a relatively flat social structure, often based on kinship. People were hunters and gatherers who moved over distances in small parties.\n\nHowever, in the latest part of the Stone Age, some time around 4000 BC, permanent settlements were established in gradually increasing numbers. Before and parallelly with the introduction of agriculture c. 2500 BC, hunter-gatherer societies became larger tribute societies with elements of stratification. Transition to agriculture was both a condition for and triggered the genesis of the very first aristocracy on the Scandinavian Peninsula. The first known aristocracy appeared no later than c. 1500 BC.\n\nComparatively, transition to agriculture happened c. 9000 BC in the Fertile Crescent and c. 4000 BC in the British Isles. The most obvious reason for Scandinavia's relatively late transition is the Weichsel glaciation, i.e. the latest ice age. Norway was almost wholly covered by ice until c. 7000 BC, and most of the ice sheet was not melted until c. 6000 BC.\n\nThe first known aristocracy in today's Norway existed in the Bronze Age (c. 1800 BCc. 500 BC) and no later than c. 1500 BC. For this reason, it is called a bronze aristocracy (). During this age, settlements became more divided into classes as a new dimension appeared: socio-economical differences.\n\nBased on access to and physical control of natural resources, such as furs, walrus teeth, and other goods that were desired by foreigners, a social élite was able to acquire foreign metals. Bronze is essential in this regard. By importing bronze, which they also established a monopoly on, leading persons and their families would not only express their power but even strengthen and increase it. Bronze was also militarily important. It enabled a limited number of possessors to make weapons stronger than those of stone, and unlike the latter, broken bronze weapons could be melted and reshaped. Common people continued to use tools and weapons of stone during the whole age.\n\nThrough trade and cultural exchange, the bronze aristocracy was part of the contemporary civilisation in Europe, despite being placed in the geographical outskirts of it. Continental impulses, for example new religious customs and decorative design, arrived relatively early.\n\nAlthough there was an established aristocracy, the pyramidal social structure is not similar to the feudal system of the much later Medieval Age. Beside other factors, it has been suggested that agricultural production was insufficient to supply an élite that itself did not participate. In general, it is considered as unlikely that the élite possessed total power. Furthermore, power may not only have been based on weapons. Also religious and ancestral factors are important when explaining how certain persons or families managed to maintain authority for generations. For example, impressive burial mounds could consolidate imaginations of a clan's right to an area.\n\nThe bronze aristocracy is known primarily through burial mounds, for example a mound (c. 1200 BC) in Jåsund, Western Norway, where an apparently mighty man was buried together with a big bronze sword. Other mounds were filled with bronze weapons and bronze artefacts, for example rings, necklaces, and decorative daggers. The biggest mounds could be up to 8–9 metres in height and 40 metres in diameter. A construction like this required the work of ten men for about four weeks.\n\nThe bronze aristocracy faced a challenge when the position of bronze was taken over by iron. Unlike bronze, which remained an aristocratically controlled metal through the whole age, iron was found in rich amounts in the nature, especially in bogs, and was thus owned and used by broader layers of the population.\n\nArchaeological examination of graves of the Early Iron Age (c. 400 BCc. AD 500) has revealed three distinct social strata. Ordinary farmers were cremated and buried in simple, flat graves. (Whilst this sort of burial had existed in the Bronze Age, too, the cremation part was a recently imported custom from Continental Europe—and not imposed on ordinary farmers in particular.) Grand farmers and aristocrats were buried together with grave goods, while chieftains were buried in mounds. Grave goods of this age are dominated by iron artefacts.\n\nIn this age, the aristocracy had begun to enslave humans. The use of forced labor in agricultural production made the aristocracy able to spend more resources on military activities, increasing their capacity to control their tax-paying subjects, to defend their territory, and even to expand it. However, thralls were not an aristocratic privilege. In principle, all free men could hold thralls. A thrall was the rightless property of his or her owner. The text \"Rígsþula\" identifies three distinct classes and describes extensively how they evolved: chieftains, farmers, and thralls. Religion was used to explain and justify thralldom, but the original motivation was rather economical.\n\nFurthermore, the aristocracy sacrificed humans to be placed in graves of deceased aristocrats. Also this custom was related to religion, i.e. imaginations of life after death. Contemporary sources as well as archaeological remains document this custom. For example, Arab traveller Ahmad ibn Fadlan (fl. 10th century) documented that a female slave was killed for this purpose in a Nordic burial in Russia.\n\nAt the beginning of the Late Iron Age (c. 500c. 793; in Norway known as the Merovingian Age), there were several changes in Nordic culture: for example the deterioration of the quality of works of art and syncopation of the spoken language. Burial customs in several regions were drastically simplified: stone coffins (stones placed together as a coffin protecting the body within a grave or a tumulus) were no longer used, and tumuli became smaller or were replaced by flat graves. Also grave goods appear to have been lesser in amount than before.\n\nSome historians have interpreted these changes negatively. Some suggest that they were caused by plague or interregional conflict, while others believe that the smaller number of tumuli reflects the consolidation of aristocratic power, which meant that large and splendid monuments were no longer necessary.\n\nThe hird was divided into three classes, of which the first had three ranks. The first class was \"hirdmann\" with \"lendmann\" as the 1st rank, \"skutilsvein\" as the 2nd rank, and ordinary \"hirdmann\" as the 3rd rank. Below them were the classes \"gjest\" and \"kjertesvein\".\n\nLendmen, having the first rank in the group of hirdmen, had the right to hold 40 armed housecarls, to advise the King, and to receive an annual payment from the King. They normally also held the highest offices in the state. The foundation for their rights was the military duty which their title imposed.\n\nKjertesveins were young men of good family who served as pages at the court, and gjests constituted a guard and police corps. In addition, there was a fourth group known as housecarls, but it remains uncertain whether they were considered a part of or rather served the hird.\n\nThe hird's organisation is described in the \"King’s Mirror\" and the \"Codex of the Hird\".\n\nThe system of hirdmen—regional and local representatives for the King—was stronger and lasted longer in the tributary lands Shetland, Orkney, Iceland, and the Faroe Islands, and also in Jemtland, originally an independent farmer republic which Norwegian kings used much time and efforts to gain control over.\n\nDuring the second half of the 13th century continental European court culture began to gain influence in Norway. In 1277 the King introduced continental titles in the hird: lendmen were called barons, and skutilsveins were called \"ridder\". Both were then styled \"Herr\" (). In 1308 King Håkon V abolished the lendman/baron institution, and it was probably also during his reign that the aristocracy seems to have been restructured into two classes: \"ridder\" () and \"væpner\" ().\n\nIt is difficult to determinate exactly how many knights and squires there were in the 14th and the early 15th century. When King Haakon V signed a peace treaty with the Danish king in 1309, it was sealed by 29 Norwegian knights and squires. King Haakon promised that additional 270 knights and squires would give their written recognition. This were perhaps the approximate number of knights and squires at this time.\n\nThe Black Death, which came to Norway around 1349, was bad for the nobility. In addition to the loss of their own members, about two thirds of the population were killed by the plague, and the reduction in available manpower for agriculture caused an economic crisis.\n\nThe aristocracy was reduced from about 600 families or 3,600 people before 1350 to about 200 families or 1,000 people in 1450.\n\nThe value of land was reduced by 50%–75%, and the land rent was reduced by up to 75%, except in relatively populous central districts like Akershus and Båhus, where the reduction was about 40%. The tithe also reduced by 60%–70%.\n\nBoth before and after the plague, Norwegian noblemen were unusually dependent on the King compared with noblemen in other countries. Mountainous Norway has never been conducive to large land estates of continental size. As a consequence of the tremendous reduction in land-related income following the plague, it became even more necessary than before to enter royal service.\n\nMilitarily, the Black Death was a catastrophe. As lower and local noblemen were killed by the plague, the recruitment of officers and troop leaders was equally reduced. Having lost their economic base (reduced income of taxes etc.) and their economic guarantees from the King, local aristocrats could often not fulfil their military duties.\n\nThe system of royally controlled fiefs was established in 1308, replacing the originally more independent lendmen. There were two types of medieval fiefs:\n\nTo the first belonged castle fiefs (Norwegian: \"slottslen\") or main fiefs (Norwegian: \"hovedlen\"), to which the King appointed lords, and under them petty fiefs (Norwegian: \"smålen\"), which had varying connections with their respective castle fief. In the 15th century, there were approximately fifty fiefs in Norway. In the late 16th century and the early 17th century, there were four permanent castle fiefs and approximately thirty small. Thereafter, the number of petty fiefs was reduced in favour of bigger and more stable main fiefs. Lords of castle fief resided in the biggest cities, where the royal farms or the castles were located.\n\nThe second type were estate fiefs (Norwegian: \"godslen\"), i.e. private, noble estates that constituted independent areas of jurisdiction.\n\nLikewise, nobles were active in the Kingdom's military defence, in which fortresses had a central position. In the early 14th century, the Fortress of Vardøhus in Northern Norway was constructed due to conflicts with the Russian Republic of Novgorod and as protection against robbery raids of the Karelians. The fortresses Bohus and Akershus in Eastern Norway were established approximately at the same time. An earlier fortress was Bergenhus in Western Norway. There would usually be one or more fiefs attached to each fortress. All fortresses were mainly under the command of nobles, who held the military title of høvedsmann.\n\nDuring the 14th century members of the hird continued in various directions. The lower parts of the hird lost importance and disappeared. The upper parts, especially the former lendmen, became the nucleus of the nobility of the High Medieval Age: the Knighthood (). They stood close to the King, and as such they received seats in the Council of the Kingdom as well as fiefs, and some had even family connections to the royal house. There was a significant social distance between the Knighthood and ordinary noblemen.\n\nThe Council of the Kingdom was the Kingdom's governing institution, consisting of members of the upper secular and the upper clerical aristocracy, including the Archbishop. Originally, in the 13th century, having had an advisory function as the King's council, the Council became remarkably independent from the King during the 15th century. At its height it had the power to choose or to recognise pretenders to the Throne, and it demanded an electoral charter from each new king. Sometimes it even chose its own leaders as regents (Norwegian: \"drottsete\" or \"riksforstander\"), among others Sigurd Jonsson (Stjerne) to Sudreim and Jon Svaleson (Smør).\n\nIn Norway as well as in Denmark and Sweden, it was in this period that the idea and the principle of \"riksråd constitutionalism\" had arisen, i.e. that the Council was considered as the real foundation of sovereignty. Although kings were formal heads of state, the Council was powerful. Their power and active rulership, especially as regents, have caused historians characterise this state as de facto a republic of the nobility (Norwegian: \"adelsrepublikk\").\n\nThis aristocratic power lasted until the Reformation, when the King in 1536 illegally abolished the Council. The reign of aristocrats was over when Archbishop Olav Engelbrektsson, who was also noble, the Council's president and the Regent of Norway, left the Kingdom in 1537.\n\nFollowing the abolition of the Norwegian Council of the Kingdom in 1536, which de facto ceased to exist in 1537, the nobility in Norway lost most of its formal political foundation. The Danish Council of the Kingdom took over the governing of Norway. However, the nobility in Norway, now confined to more administrative and ceremonial functions, continued to take part in the country's official life, especially at homages to new kings.\n\nHaving defeated the aristocratic and besides Roman Catholic resistance in Norway, the King in Copenhagen sought to secure and consolidate his control in the Kingdom. Strategical actions would further weaken the nobility in Norway.\n\nFirst of all, the King sent Danish noblemen to Norway in order to administer the country and to fill civilian and military offices. Norwegian noblemen were deliberately under-represented when new high officials were appointed. Whilst this was a part of the King's tactics, also the lack of Norwegian noblemen with qualified education—Norway did not have a university—was a reason for that the King had to send foreigners. The educational sector was considerably better developed in Sleswick and Holsatia, plus in Germany, so only nobles who sent their children to foreign universities could hope to keep or obtain high offices.\n\nSecondly, during the 16th century the system of independent, family-possessed estates as power centra, like Austrått, was ultimately replaced in favour of fiefs to which the King himself appointed lords. A few Norwegian noblemen were given such fiefs, for example Knight Trond Torleivsson Benkestok, Lord to Bergenhus Fortress, but over time these would find themselves possessed almost exclusively by immigrants. Nevertheless, during the 17th century fiefs were transformed into high offices. Also they were considered too risky for the King.\n\nThirdly, in 1628 the King instituted a national army of soldiers recruited directly from the estate of farmers. At the same time technical development made traditional military methods outdated. As a result, the nobility was defunctionalised in this aspect.\n\nIn 1660, when Denmark's estates were gathered in Copenhagen, King Frederick III declared military state of emergency and closed the capital city, thus preventing the nobility from boycotting the assembly by leaving. The nobility was forced to surrender. In the following days, Denmark was transformed from an elective monarchy into an hereditary. On 17 October, the 1648 \"håndfestning\" was returned to the King, and on 18 October, the King was hailed as an hereditary monarch. On 10 January 1661, the Absolute and Hereditary Monarchy Act () introduced absolutism. In Denmark, the Council of the Kingdom faced the same destiny as the Norwegian Council had done in 1536: abolition. The noble monarchy () had come to an end.\n\nFormally a hereditary kingdom since old ages, Norway was not affected by Denmark's transition to the same. However, also Norway was affected by absolutism. On 7 August 1661 in Christiania, representatives of the Norwegian nobility signed the Sovereignty Act.\n\nThe native aristocracy was reduced during the last part of the Late Medieval Age, but not as much as previously believed. Several factors may explain this.\n\nIt was a common misunderstanding that Noble status was only transmitted through sons, while in reality, Noble status was inherited according to the specifications in each single Patent of Nobility which in a great number of Patents of Nobility included all descendants, through both female and male lineage, thus the lack of men did not lead to Noble families’ extinction, but were in a large number of cases instead carried on through their daughters.\n\nThis precaution was put in place as seen in most of the earliest Patents of Nobility issued in Norway by king Eric of Pommerania, and later re-introduced by those kings who wished to ensure their descendants never ran out of out of Nobles to defend them. Since noblemen as warriors were exposed to greater risks than the population in general and therefore died in a young age and often without issue. Thus, by including all descendants through both male and female lines, those of the kings who regularly incorporated the descendants through female lines, had the foresight to ensure the continuous birth of new Nobles to defend their descendants as future kings.\n\nFor a brief period (after 1581 and 1582) unequal marriages could lead to the loss of noble status, noble estates, and similar, but only for those families who had received their Patents after 1581 and 1582 as the king specifically refused to reduce any of the rights granted to older noble families by his predecessors. In an application to the King in 1591, the nobility requested that since it ‘[...] often [happens] that noblemen here in Norway marry unfree women, and their children inherit his estate, [...] which is the nobility to reduction and shame [...]’, their children should not inherit noble status or noble estate.\n\nIt is also a factor that noble status was not automatically inherited. If a family for generations no longer provided services to the King, they could, due to oblivion, lose their position. An example is the Tordenstjerne family, whose members in the 16th century were squires, but who due to political and military inactivity in the 17th century had to get their noble status confirmed in the 18th century.\n\nIt is often claimed that the old nobility ‘died out’ in the Late Medieval Age. This is mostly but not entirely correct. The term ‘extinction’ includes not only families dying out physically, but also disappearance from the written sources of formerly noble families which had lost their political power and importance. This has even obscured the link between the such families before and in the 16th century and their farmer descendants who appear in sources beginning in the late 17th century. In other words, families of the old nobility may in actuality have survived without knowing it or being able to prove it.\n\nThe nobility of the 16th century was of a marginal size, thus being socially more exclusive, but also politically more vulnerable. For example, after the Reformation in 1536, the number of nobles was reduced from approximately 800 and to approximately 400, i.e. under 0.2 percent of the population and approximately 1/7 of the size of the Danish nobility. After 1536, only 15 percent of Norwegian land was in noble possession.\n\nThere are a few examples of medieval noblewomen who acted with considerable de facto independence. Prominent are Lady Ingegjerd Ottesdotter Rømer of Austrått and Lady Gørvel Fadersdotter (Sparre) of Giske. It is, however, important to know that they acted as so-called 'pseudo men', i.e. in the formal role of a man (usually their deceased husbands, fathers or brothers). Legally, there was no such thing as formal female roles.\n\nIn general, noblewomen had larger economical freedom than women of unfree estate. Whilst the Land Law of 1274 and the Town Law of 1276 gave farmer women and burgher women only limited control of their assets, noblewomen could buy and sell as much as they pleased. This estate-based discrimination would last until the Land Law (including the Norwegian Code of 1604, which was mostly a Danish translation) was replaced by the Norwegian Code of 1687, a law that made all non-widowed women legally minor, regardless of their birth. (Some minor restrictions were introduced in 1604, when Norwegian law, granting unmarried women financial independence from their 21st year, was adjusted to match Danish law, which imposed lifelong guardianship on women and their fortune.)\n\nThe noble privileges of 1582 decreed that a noblewoman who married a non-noble man should lose all her hereditary land to her nearest co-inheritor, for example her brother. The rule was designed with the intention of keeping noble land in noble hand, which would strengthen the nobility's power base.\n\nThe hird in the Faroe Islands is mentioned for the last time in a document of 1479.\n\nIn 1262, Gissur Þorvaldsson († 1268) was given the title Earl of Iceland, indicating and imposing that he should rule Iceland on behalf of Norway's king. It is known that approximately 20–30 Icelandic men had the title of knight in the following centuries, among others Eiríkur Sveinbjarnarson in Vatnsfjörður († 1342) and Arnfinnur Þorsteinsson († 1433).\n\nIn 1457, King Christian I ennobled Björn Þorleifsson. The same honour had been granted Torfi Arason in 1450. Björn was \"hirðstjóri\" (a high royal official) in Iceland and as well the richest man in this part of Norway.\n\nIn 1488, King John ennobled Eggert Eggertsson, Lawspeaker () of Viken in mainland Norway. His son was Hans Eggertsson (fl. 1522), city administrator () of Bergen, and the latter's son was Eggert Hansson, Lawspeaker () of Iceland (fl. 1517–1563). This family is known as Norbagge today.\n\nIn 1620 at the Althing, Jón Magnússon the Elder, let a letters patent of 1457 be read, originally given to his aforementioned ancestor Björn Þorleifsson. King Christian IV recognised his noble status. It is claimed that Jón was the last Norwegian nobleman in this part of Norway. The era of the nobility in Iceland ended in 1661 with the introduction of absolutism in Norway.\n\nMembers of the royal clergy (), i.e. the clergy of the King's own chapels, which were subordinate only to the King and largely independent of the Church hierarchy in Norway, belonged to the secular aristocracy by virtue of their offices in the service of the King.\n\nIn a royal proclamation of 22 June 1300 King Haakon V granted St Mary's Church, Oslo—the royal chapel—numerous privileges and decreed that \"the learned man who is or becomes its dean\" (i.e. the provost) \"ex officio\" would have the rank of a lendman, whilst priests with prebends (i.e. the canons) would have the rank of a Knight, the vicars and deacons would have the rank of an (ordinary) \"hirdmann\", and other clerics would have the rank of a \"kjertesvein\"; the clergy of this church thus received extraordinarily high aristocratic ranks, according to Sverre Bagge.\n\nIn 1314 King Haakon decreed that the provost of St Mary's Church would also hold the office of Chancellor () and Keeper of the Great Seal ‘for eternity’, and with some interruptions the office of Chancellor was tied to the office of provost of St Mary's Church until some years after the Reformation in 1536. One of the other priests (typically a canon) would serve as Vice-Chancellor according to the royal letter. The main Great Seal was brought to Denmark in 1398, but the Chancellor kept an older version of the seal that was used until the 16th century. The vicars of St Mary's Church probably had a higher position than elsewhere due to their extraordinary aristocratic rank. In 1348 King Haakon VI found it necessary to stress that the canons had higher rank in every aspect and they alone should administer the estate of their church.\n\nSt Mary's Church was an important political institution until the Reformation era, as it was the seat of government in Norway, although from the late 14th century effectively subordinate to the central government administration in Copenhagen and increasingly concerned only with matters relating to the legal field. Peter Andreas Munch has described the royal clergy as a counterweight to the (regular) secular aristocracy with a stronger loyalty to the king and a stronger service element than both the (regular) secular and the clerical aristocracy. The cathedral chapter of St Mary's Church ceased to exist as a separate institution when it was merged with the chapter of Oslo Cathedral in 1545, although its clergy retained their prebends.\n\nMost of the royal clergy—especially those who rose to its upper echelons, such as canon and provost—were recruited from the lower nobility and sometimes even from the higher nobility.\n\nIn the years following the Reformation, this royal clergy gradually disappeared, as the entire church hierarchy came directly under the King's control. Some remnants of the institution survived for some time; for example the estate of the provost of St Mary's Church (\"Mariakirkens prostigods\") was customarily given as a fief to the Chancellor of Norway until the 17th century.\n\nHans Olufsson (1500–1570), who was a canon at St Mary's Church before and after the Reformation and who held the prebend of Dillevik that included the income of 43 ecclesiastical properties, is regarded as the probable progenitor of the still extant Paus family.\n\nThe clergy () was one of normally three estates in the Norwegian feudal system. Together with the King and the secular aristocracy, the Archbishop and the clerical aristocracy constituted the power class in the Kingdom. Until the Reformation in 1536 this aristocracy operated and developed in parallel with the secular aristocracy.\n\nIt was in the years after the death of King Olaf 'the Holy' in 1030 that Norway was finally Christianised, whereby the Church gradually began to play a political rôle. Already in 1163 the Law of Succession stated that Norwegian kings were no longer sovereign monarchs but vassals holding Norway as a fief from Saint Olaf alias the Eternal King of Norway. This invention gave the Church bigger control of the royal power, not least because the King had to proclaim loyalty to the Pope. King Magnus V (1156–1184) was as such the first of Norway's kings to use the style 'by the Grace of God'. Nevertheless, this law of succession would last only for a century, when a new and for kings more independent law of succession was introduced.\n\nThe Church was actively involved in the civil war era (1130–1240), in which they were allies of the established aristocracy and supported throne pretenders who were (alleged) descendants of 'Olaf the Holy'. Ultimately the Church supported Magnus Erlingsson (1156–1184), the son of Earl Erling Ormsson and Princess Kristin Sigurdsdotter.\n\nIn 1184, having defeated King Magnus, Sverre Sigurdsson became King of Norway. Subsequently, Sverre demanded that the Archbishop should be subordinate to the King. As a result of this King Sverre was excommunicated. In Denmark exiled Archbishop Eirik, plus the majority of bishops, arranged a resistance movement known as the Baglers. They managed to re-occupy and control parts of Eastern Norway, from where they represented a permanent threat to King Sverre. Upon King Sverre's death in 1202 a it became possible to find a compromise between Sverre's supporters, the Birchlegs, and the Archbishop. In 1217 they managed to agree upon a king: King Haakon IV, a paternal grandson of King Sverre.\n\nDuring the 13th century there were power struggles between the Church and the King. Several disagreements were temporarily solved with the Concordat of Tunsberg () of 1277. This concordat granted the clerical aristocracy several rights and privileges or confirmed existing ones, for example the freedom to trade and the freedom from paying lething. The same concordat gave the Archbishop the right to have 100 sveins (armed pages), whilst each bishop could have 40.\n\nThere were ten bishops under the Archbishop of Nidaros, namely:\n\n\nCanons () were priests who were also attached to one of the dioceses in Norway.\n\nCanons were recruited primarily from the secular aristocracy. Whilst most canons came from the lower nobility, several belonged to the higher nobility by birth. The latter were sons of knights and even of Councillors of the Kingdom. Examples are Jakob Matsson of the Rømer family, Henrik Nilsson of the Gyldenløve family, and Elling Pedersson of the Oxe family.\n\nIn the 13th century canons were styled \"Sira\" (compare with English Sir).\n\nPriests () constituted the local level of the clergy.\n\nOriginally a style for canons in the 13th century, priests were styled \"Sira\" in and after the 14th century. Subsequently, \"Sira\" was replaced by \"Herr\". \"Sira\" and \"Herr\" were used in combination with the given name only, e.g. 'Sira Eirik'.\n\nBeside the clerical hierarchy, the Archbishop of Nidaros had his own organisation of officers and servants.\n\nRegional representatives of the Archbishop, setesveins (not to be confused with the noble title of \"skutilsvein\") were seated mainly along the coast of Western and Northern Norway as well as in Iceland. A register of 1533 shows that there were at least 69 setesveins at this time. Their function was to administer the land estate of and to collect the taxes belonging to the Archbishop, and they also traded partly themselves and partly on behalf of the Archbishop. In Northern Norway, a typical location of setesveins was a central position with immediate control of the lucrative fisheries.\n\nSome setesveins belonged to the secular aristocracy too, usually by birth.\n\nAfter the Reformation in 1536, when King Christian III prohibited the Roman Catholic Church and the Archbishop went into exile, the King punished setesveins who had supported the Archbishop. Many of them had their houses robbed as the King and his soldiers raided the coast.\n\nIn Northern Norway ex-setesveins and their descendants were known as \"page nobility\" ().\n\nThe modern aristocracy is known as adel (). The parts of the nobility that are regarded as new in Norway consisted of immigrated persons and families of the old nobility of Denmark, of recently ennobled persons and families in Norway as well as in Denmark, and of persons and families whose (claimed) noble status was confirmed or—for foreigners—naturalised by the King.\n\nAn absolute monarch since 1660, the King could ennoble and for that sake remove the noble status of anyone he wished and—unlike earlier—without approval from the Council of the Kingdom. He could even elevate dead humans to the estate of nobles. For example, four days after his death in 1781, Hans Eilersen Hagerup was ennobled under the name de Gyldenpalm. This made as well his legitimate children and other patrilineal descendants noble.\n\nIn particular there were two ways of receiving noble status: via an office (informally known as \"office nobility\") and via a letters patent (informally known as \"letter nobility\").\n\nOn 25 May 1671 King Christian V created 31 counts and barons. As such two classes were created in addition to the class of nobles: the \"class of barons\" (Norwegian: \"friherrestand\") and the \"class of counts\" (Norwegian: \"grevestand\"). A noble was per definition untitled, and barons and counts did not belong to the class of nobles, but to their respective classes. However, all three constituted the \"estate\" of nobles. Barons and counts could be either titular or feudal. The latter constituted the \"feudal nobility\" (). On 22 April 1709 King Frederick IV introduced the title of marquis.\n\nThe introduction of the titles of count and baron was controversial in the old nobility, who were old enemies of royal absolutism and whom the titles sought to outrank. One reaction was the anonymously published theatre play \"Comedy of the Count and the Baron\", written in 1675.\n\nA minor but nevertheless considerable element of the modern aristocracy was the office nobility (Norwegian: \"embetsadel\" or \"embedsadel\", also called \"rangadel\"). It was introduced in 1679 and would, with extensive reductions during the 18th century, last until 1814.\n\nA person holding a high-ranking office within one of the highest classes of rank automatically received ennoblement for himself, for his wife, and for his legitimate children, and for decades this status was normally hereditable for his patrilineal and legitimate descendants. However, basically all such ennoblements were annulled when King Christian VI, tired of his father's generosity, acceded to the throne in 1730, and only those who received a special recognition after making an application retained their noble status. The office nobility as such was not abolished. Subsequent royal decrees introduced a more restrictive policy, under which noble status dependent on offices was limited to the person concerned, to his wife, and to his legitimate children.\nThe Decree on the Order of Precedence of 1671 was radical, for the first time deciding that the nobility did not automatically have the highest rank in the Kingdom. It stated explicitly that the nobility should enjoy their traditional rank above other estates and subjects \"unless\" the latter were specified in the order of precedence. In other words, any person within the rank stood above noble persons outside this. The Noble Privileges of 1661 had stated the opposite, namely that the nobility should enjoy rank and honour above all others.\n\nFinally, the Letter of Privileges of 11 February 1679 introduced automatical noble status for the highest members of the order of precedence. As such the office nobility had been established. The letter stated explicitly that these persons of rank as well as wife and children should enjoy all privileges and benefits that others of the nobility had in the present and in the future, and it was also stressed that they should be honoured, respected, and regarded equally with nobles of birth.\n\nThe office nobility has later been considered with lesser regard, and for example the \"Yearbook of the Danish Nobility\" does not include such persons and families.\n\nExamples:\n\n\nBeginning already in the High Medieval Age but especially associated with the late 17th century and the 18th century, it became customary to ennoble persons by letters patent () for significant military or artistic achievements, and there were also persons who were ennobled in this way after making monetary donations. These are informally known as \"letter nobility\" ().\n\nOne of the earliest known Norwegian letters patent is from 1458, given to Sjøfar and Nils Sigurdssøner, by King Eric III. The patent included all of their descendants, both through male and female-descendancy where ennoblement was given to \"these and their legitimate children, their descendants and their relatives, each after the other\". The heraldic name of their descendants are called the Rosensverds. As this patent was given prior to the restrictions generally imposed on the unpatented-nobility in 1582 and 1592, The Rosensverds are thus exempt from the later rule that stated that nobility should only pass through male-lines, witch ensures that every Rosensverd, whether they descend from Sjøfar or Niels Siggurdzønner through their fathers or their mothers, are born nobles regardless and their children and so forth also nobles, even if a Rosensverd should marry a commoner. This Was due to the fact that King Eric in the patent \"gave shield, helmet, freedom and salvation\" to all their descendants, both and unborn alike, \"each after the other\", without excluding any descendant, regardless of who they married.\n\nOther families are Rosenvinge and Tordenstjerne, both ennobled in 1505. However, the custom of ennobling by letters patent increased drastically in the late 17th century and the 18th century, when numerous persons and families received such noble status. They were a part of the King's plan of creating a new and loyal nobility replacing the old, who until 1660 had been political enemies of the King. However, letters patent given (unofficially: sold) among others to rich merchants were also a lucrative source of income for the Kings, whose many wars at times lead to a big need for money.\n\nExamples:\n\n\nWith feudal barons and feudal counts one saw the introduction of a neo-feudal structure in Norway. These modern fiefs were ruled with conditioned independence by noble families, and they were hereditable. Feudal lords were equipped with extensive rights and duties. On the other hand, a fief was formally a \"dominium directum\" of the King. It would as such return to the Crown when a title became extinct (see for example Barony of Rosendal) or when a feudal lord was sentenced for disloyalty (see for example Countship of Griffenfeld).\n\nThe main architect behind the new system of barons and counts, introduced in 1671, was Peder Schumacher, who himself was ennobled as Peder Schumacher Griffenfeld in 1671 and created Count of Griffenfeld in 1673. In 1675 the citizens of Tønsberg lost their independence, and the city was merged into the Countship. Griffenfeld had been granted the sole right to all mining and hunting within the Countship. He could appoint judges, arrest and charge inhabitants, and punish sentenced criminals. He could appoint priests to all churches, which he owned. Several duties were imposed on the Count's subjects. For example, cotters () under the Count had to work for him without payment.\n\nWhilst these new politics could bring fundamental changes to each area concerned, the effect and the consequences remained limited in Norway in general, as originally only two countships and one barony were created. These included only a small amount of the Norwegian population. Divided into counties (), the rest of Norway was under direct royal administration.\n\nLutheran Evangelical kingdoms, Denmark and Norway welcomed Huguenots who had escaped from France following the 1685 revocation of the Edict of Nantes. Huguenots were greeted with several privileges, and some even achieved noble status and/or titles. One was Jean Henri Huguetan (1665–1749) from Lyon, who was created Count of Gyldensteen in 1717.\n\nDuring the 18th century, Norwegian-born noblemen and burghers rose to prominence within the Dano-Norwegian state.\n\nIn 1733 King Christian VI introduced the system of \"stavnsbånd\"—a serfdom-like institution—in Denmark. This was introduced following an agricultural crisis that lead people to leave the countryside and move into towns. The system would last until after 1788.\n\nThe stavnsbånd was not introduced in Norway, where all men had been free since the Old Norse heathen \"trelldom\" was fought and abolished by the Roman Catholic Church.\n\nDuring the de facto reign of Johann Friedrich Struensee between 1770 and 1772 the power of the nobility in Denmark and Norway was challenged. Whilst he did not mind creating himself and his friend Brandt feudal counts, Struensee was an enemy of the hereditary aristocracy, which he sought to replace with a merit-based system of government. A part of his reforms Struensee abolished noble privileges and decided that state employments should be based on a person's qualifications only.\n\nIn a counter-coup on 17 January 1772 Ove Høegh-Guldberg, Hans Henrik von Eickstedt, Georg Ludwig von Köller-Banner and others had Struensee arrested. In a following trial he was sentenced to death. On 28 April ex-counts Brandt and Struensee were executed; first their right hands were cut off, whereafter they were beheaded and had their bodies drawn and quartered.\n\nThe Constitution of the Kingdom of Norway of 1814, which had been established in the spirit of the principles of the French Revolution and greatly influenced by the Constitution of the United States of America, forbade the creation of new nobility, including countships, baronies, family estates (), and fee tails (). Beside being in accordance with the contemporary political ideology, the prohibition effectively removed the possibility for Norway's king, who after 1814 also was Sweden's king, to create a nobility of Swedes and loyal Norwegians.\n\nThe Nobility Law of 1821 (Norwegian: \"Adelsloven\") initiated a long-range abolition of all noble titles and privileges, while the current nobility were allowed to keep their noble status, possible titles and in some cases also privileges for the rest of their lifetime. Under the Nobility Law, nobles who for themselves and their children wished to present a claim to nobility before the Norwegian parliament were required to provide documentation confirming their noble status. Representatives of eighteen noble families submitted their claims to the Parliament.\n\nIn 1815 and in 1818, the Parliament had passed the same law, and it was both times vetoed by the King. The King did not possess a third veto, so he had to approve the law in 1821. Shortly afterwards, the King suggested the creation of a new nobility, but the attempt was rejected by the Parliament.\n\nMany of the Norwegians who had noble status in Norway had noble status also in Denmark and thus remained noble. This and the fact that many Norwegian nobles did not live in the country may have contributed to reduced resistance to the Nobility Law. However, there was resistance, which found its most significant expression in Severin Løvenskiold, who had fought against the democracy and who worked for stopping the Nobility Law. Being an important politician and an allied of the King, Løvenskiold was not without power. Løvenskiold argued against the law that Norway's king, and thus the Kingdom's government, had granted his family eternal noble status, and the letters patent of 1739 uses the expression ‘eternally’. At the same time, the Constitution's § 97 in fact stated: ‘No law must be given retroactive force.’\n\nThe last Norwegian count with official recognition was Peder Anker, Count of Wedel-Jarlsberg, who died in 1893. His younger brothers were Herman, Baron of Wedel-Jarlsberg, who died in 1888, and Harald, Baron of Wedel-Jarlsberg, who died in 1897. The cousins Ulriche Antoinette de Schouboe (1813–1901) and Julie Elise de Schouboe (1813–1911), as well as Anne Sophie Dorothea Knagenhjelm (1821–1907), died early in the 20th century as some of Norway's last persons who had had official recognition as noble.\n\nAlthough the institution of nobility gradually was dissolved, members of noble families continued to play a significant rôle in the political and social life of the country. For example, Stewards and Prime Ministers such as Count Herman Wedel-Jarlsberg (Steward, 1836–1840), Severin Løvenskiold (Steward, 1841–1856, Prime Minister, 1828–1841), Peder Anker (Prime Minister, 1814–1822), Frederik Due (Prime Minister, 1841–1858), Georg Sibbern (Prime Minister, 1858–1871) and Carl Otto Løvenskiold (Prime Minister, 1884) had aristocratic backgrounds.\n\nAristocrats were active also in the dissolution of the union between Norway and Sweden in 1905. Most prominent were diplomat Fritz Wedel Jarlsberg and world-famous polar explorer Fridtjof Wedel-Jarlsberg Nansen. Nansen, who otherwise became Norway's first ambassador to London (1906–08), was pro dissolving the union and, among other acts, travelled to the United Kingdom, where he successfully lobbied for support for the independence movement. Also in the ensuing referendum concerning monarchy versus republic in Norway, the popular hero Nansen's support of monarchy and his active participation in the pro-monarchy campaign is said to have had an important effect on popular opinion. After the dissolution of the union, the leading person in the creation of the new state's Ministry of Foreign Affairs was Thor von Ditten, a Norwegian of foreign nobility.\n\nToday, the nobility is a relatively marginal factor in the society, culturally and socially as well as in politics. Members of noble families are only individually prominent, like Anniken Huitfeldt. However, a handful of families, like Løvenskiold, Treschow, and Wedel-Jarlsberg, still possess considerable wealth. This includes fame and regular appearance in newspapers and also coloured magazines.\n\nLandowner and businessman Carl Otto Løvenskiold owns \"Maxbo\" among other companies. The brothers Nicolai and Peder Løvenskiold own a large number of higher private schools in Norway, among others the Westerdals School of Communication, the Bjørknes College, and the Norwegian School of Information Technology. Prominent was also the now late landowner and businesswoman Mille-Marie Treschow, who was one of the wealthiest women in Norway.\n\nUntil and during the 20th century, noble persons have served at the Royal Court in Oslo. Prominent are (since 1985) Mistress of the Robes Ingegjerd Løvenskiold Stuart and (between 1931 and 1945) Lord Chamberlain Peder Anker Wedel-Jarlsberg.\n\nAlthough privileges were abolished and official recognition of titles was removed, some families still consider themselves noble by tradition and—lawfully—still bear their inherited name and coat of arms. Claims to nobility have no effect or support in law. There are still Norwegians who enjoy official recognition from the Danish government;—the nobility in Denmark still exists. They are likewise included in the \"Yearbook of the Danish Nobility\", published by the Association of the Danish Nobility.\n\nThe family Roos af Hjelmsäter of the Swedish nobility is among the disappearingly few of Norway's medieval noble families still living today.\n\nThe aristocracy has ruled and shaped Norway during nearly the whole existence of the Kingdom. Products of and references to the aristocracy are both visible and less explicit in today's society.\n\nIn 1814 noblemen were leading when a constitutional monarchy and a parliament were established in Norway. Among them were the Count of Wedel-Jarlsberg, Peder Anker, and Christian Magnus Falsen. The Constitution of the Kingdom of Norway of 1814, which is still in function, was written by a nobleman, namely by Falsen. This constitution grants, among other things, freedom of speech, protection of private property, and prohibition of painful search and seizure.\n\nIn 1905 members of the aristocracy were leading in the independence movement. Eystein Eggen has claimed Norway's independence was realised by a 'genuinely aristocratic wave', in which especially Fridtjof Wedel-Jarlsberg Nansen and Fritz Wedel-Jarlsberg were important persons.\n\nIn culture\n\nIn names and places\n\nPhilanthropy\nNorwegian foundations origined along with settled estates (\"stamhus\") and fee tails (\"fideikommiss\") during absolutism in Norway, and noblemen were among the first to establish such. In 1814, when the Constitution of the Kingdom of Norway was introduced, the foundation system was the only to survive; the creation of new settled estates and new fee tails was prohibited.\n\nOf over 7,000 foundations in Norway today, several have been established by or bear the name of noble persons and families. An example is the Comital Foundation of Hielmstierne-Rosencrone, providing financial support to certain poor women in Bergen. Others are:\n\n\nWollstonecraft\nIn her work \"Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark\", published in 1796, Mary Wollstonecraft shares her impressions of Norway. Some descriptions are related to the nobility and to the social structure:\n\n\nThe following list contains families who appeared before, during, and after the so-called unification of Norway (c. 872–1050). To these belonged also the post-unification lendman aristocracy (1050–1184/1240).\n\nSquire \"(Væpner\")\nYears of denoblement (extinction) refer to when the last noble \"male\" member died. It should, however, be noted that several letters patent treated men and women equally; when unmarried or widowed, such women had a personal and independent status as noble. An example is the letters patent of the Løvenskiold family, which uses the term 'legitimate issue of the male and the female sexus'.\n\nSeveral different sets of titles have existed, and also the function and the content of titles have varied. There are considerable differences between medieval titles and modern ones.\n\nDano-Norwegian titles are different from the British concept of peerage. Whilst a peerage is inherited upon the holder's death and normally by the eldest son only, a Dano-Norwegian title was normally received by all legitimate sons and daughters at the moment of their birth, meaning that there could be several countesses or barons of the same family at the same time. The exception was the title of count (\"greve\" for men and \"grevinne\" for women), which in general was restricted to the bearer, his wife, and his eldest son.\n\nOne has to distinguish between titles and fiefs. For example, the (administrative) fief \"Countship of Jarlsberg\" was dissolved in 1821, but the recognition of the title \"Count of Jarlsberg\" was not abolished until 1893, and the (physical) estate of Jarlsberg is still in the family's possession.\n\nWhilst a fief in Norway was limited to Norway, the \"title\" was also Danish. Likewise a fief-based title in Denmark was also Norwegian. In other words, titles were dual. For example, there were/are a Norwegian fief \"Countship of Jarlsberg\", a Norwegian title \"Count of Jarlsberg\" (no longer officially recognised), and a Danish title \"Count of Jarlsberg\" (still officially recognised).\n\nThe 1821 Nobility Law initiated a long-range abolition of official recognition of noble titles (not of titles per se).\n\n\nDuke\nIn 1237 Earl Skule Bårdsson was given the title and the rank of duke (). It was the first time this title had been used in Norway, and it involved that the title of earl no longer had the highest rank below the King. It also heralded the introduction of new noble titles from Continental Europe, which were to replace the old Norse titles.\n\nEarl\nIn the process of increasing his power and territory by annexing petty kingdoms, Norway's high king offered vassalage titles in return for recognition and military support from each petty king and his aristocracy. Such regional kings and chieftains received the title of earl (). Earls were the only ones beside the King himself who were entitled to hold an army.\n\nLater, during the Middle Ages, Earl was in general a title restricted to members of the royal family. There was usually no more than one earl in mainland Norway at one time, and sometimes none. The last earl in mainland Norway was appointed in 1295.\n\nIn mainland Norway, this title was used normally for one of two purposes:\n\n\nBaron (medieval)\nLendmann was the highest rank attainable in the hird, and a lendmann stood beneath only earls and the King.\n\nKing Magnus VI abolished the title lendmann in 1277, and lendmen were given the title of baron In 1308, King Haakon V abolished this title, and a new set of titles was subsequently introduced: \"ridder\" (knight) and \"væpner\" (squire).\n\nKnight and squire\nThe titles of knight and squire were introduced in 1308.\n\nIntroduced in 1671 with the titles of baron and count, and supplied with the title of marquis in 1709, the following system is the current in Norway.\n\nThe class of barons and the class of counts were even internally divided. A count would be a titular count (\"greve\"), a feudal count (\"lensgreve\") or a national count (\"riksgreve\"). Likewise a baron would be a titular baron (\"friherre\"), a feudal baron (\"lensfriherre\") or a national baron (\"riksfriherre\"). For example, a \"lensgreve\" uses the title \"greve\" only.\n\nThe correct combination of names and title when using Norwegian is \"first name\" + \"title\" + \"last name\", e.g. \"Peder Anker grev Wedel Jarlsberg\". The titles \"greve\" and \"friherre\" are abbreviated to respectively \"grev\" and \"friherr\" when used in names or addressing the person concerned, e.g. \"Peder Anker grev Wedel Jarlsberg\" or \"friherr Holberg\". However, it is written \"Peder Anker Wedel Jarlsberg, greve til Jarlsberg\" when the complete title is added to the complete name separated by a comma.\n\nTraditionally, ennobled men have kept their birth name along with their name of nobility. Titles come \"in addition\" to these.\n\nExamples:\n\n\nHowever, the old name is usually not kept when the name of nobility derives from this.\n\nExamples:\n\n\nWhilst an ennobled man kept his old family name together with his name of nobility, descendants inherited the name of nobility only. However, descendants who receive the same given name as him usually receive his old family name too.\n\nExample:\n\n\nIn 1709 King Frederick IV of Norway granted the title Marquis of Lista, then spelled \"Lister\", to Hugo Octavius Accoramboni of Florence in Italy. Apparently the Marquis of Lista died without issue.\n\nIn 1710 the same king granted the title Marquis of Mandal to Francisco di Ratta and to the latter's nephews Giuseppe di Ratta and Luigi di Ratta of Bologna in Italy. In Norway official recognition of this title was abolished under the 1821 Nobility Law. In Denmark it seems to have lasted until 1890.\n\nNorway remains the only country in Scandinavia to which the title of marquis is attached.\n\nCount\nThe title of count was introduced in 1671.\n\nIn some families having the title of count, among others Wedel-Jarlsberg, younger sons bear the dependent title of baron. This is often specified in each family's letters patent.\n\nBaron (modern)\nThe modern title of baron was introduced in 1671.\n\nThe old nobility had several arenas on which they gathered. Beside the Council of the Kingdom, which was abolished in 1536, the nobility met at (1) homages to new kings (Norwegian: \"kongehylling\"), (2) meetings of the nobility (\"adelsmøte\"), (3) meetings of the estates (\"stendermøte\"), and (4) days of the lords (\"herredag\"). The nobility's function after 1536 was mainly administrative and ceremonial.\n\nList of Noble Meetings\n\nList of Meetings of the Estates\n\nList of Homages\n\nList of Days of the Lords\n\nThe homage of 1591 at Akershus Fortress provides information about the Norwegian nobility in the late 16th century. The Norwegian noblemen who were represented at the homage consisted of some Danes—names like Gyldenstierne, Lange, Juel, and Huitfeldt—, some Norwegians—names like Benkestok—, a couple of foreigners—Mowat (Scottish) and Norman de la Navité (French)—, and approximately 30 Norwegians with patronyms (names ending on -sen).\n\nIn 1648, the nobility requested in a letter to the King that ‘[...] we and our descendants must be held by the Christian right faith and the Augsburg Confession, so [that] it here in the Kingdom shall be maintained, protected, and shielded’ and that ‘we and our descendants of the noble estate here in Norway must be held by Norway’s law and right, [...] and enjoy the same privileges [...] as the nobility in Denmark [has received]’. Himself being Evangelical Lutheran, the King confirmed that ‘[...] the true and pure religion remains unfalsified in lands and kingdoms [...]’.\n\nThe noble privileges consisted of freedoms (Norwegian: \"frihet\"), rights (Norwegian: \"rettighet\"), and prerogatives (Norwegian: \"forrettighet\"). There were two primary sources for such privileges: the letters of privilege and the electoral charters, both issued by the King.\n\nThe royal decrees on the order of precedence, introduced in the 17th century, created the office nobility (Norwegian: \"embetsadel\", \"rangadel\"), i.e. persons who by holding a high civilian or military office or by belonging to, most often, one of the three highest classes of rank automatically received noble status for themselves as well as for wife and legitimate children.\n\nTo be \"granted\" nobility and have those few privileges wealthy people only had to pay an amount of money to the Danish union king's private account (\"partikulærkassen\").\n\nList of Electoral Charters\n\nList of Noble Privileges\n\nList of Decrees on Order of Precedence\n\nThe decree of 1808 was the last of its kind to be in introduced in Norway. The personal union between Denmark and Norway was dissolved in 1814. In Denmark the decree of 1746, with some changes and amendments, still exists.\n\nThe noble privileges of 1582, given before the Meeting of the Nobility in the same year, decreed that a noblewoman who married a non-noble man should lose all her hereditary land to her nearest co-inheritor. The rule was designed with the intention of keeping noble land in noble hand and thus strengthening the nobility's power base. A similar clause in 1591 stated that a nobleman who married a non-noble woman should forfeit noble status for their children.\n\nThe noble privileges of 1661 (1) reconfirmed the neck and hand, (4) reconfirmed the right for the nobility on their estates and in thereto belonging woods and waters to hunt and fish, (5) stated jura patronatus, but together with a duty to maintain the church buildings and such, (7, 8) stated that the nobility shall enjoy rank and honour above all others, (10) stated that the nobility when on travels representing the King shall receive a certain monetary compensation, (13) stated that no nobleman may be sentenced from honour or life by others than the King and his highest court, (14) stated that no nobleman may be arrested, and (22) reconfirmed the birk right.\n\nNoblemen enjoyed personal tax freedom, although this was later abolished. Tax freedom for their seat farms remained.\n\nNoblemen had other economic privileges, among others freedom from duty on imported and exported goods, such as beer and wine.\n\nSeat farms (Norwegian: \"setegård\", \"setegard\") were until 1660 an exclusive privilege of the nobility. A seat farm, a form of feudal demesne, was a nobleman's main residence; the place where he had his seat. Seat farms had, especially, freedom from tax and tithes.\n\nWhile previously any farm on which a nobleman decided to reside would thereby acquire the status of seat farm, the right to become a seat farm was remarkably limited in 1639, when the law was changed to require a farm to have been a seat farm for a minimum of 40 years in order for it to be officially recognised. After 1800, the tax freedom was modified, and under the 1821 Nobility Law, the tax freedom was ended at the then current owner's death.\n\nWeekday farmers (Norwegian: \"ukedagsbønder\", \"vekedagsbønder\") were persons who, as tenants of the noble, had a duty to work on the seat farm on weekdays. The system came from Denmark before 1600. It became most widespread in Eastern Norway, where the concentration of seat farms was highest, but existed also in other parts of the Kingdom. From 1685 on, the duty work was limited to farmers who lived within two miles of the seat farm.\n\nThe feud right (Norwegian: \"feiderett\") was the right to officially proclaim a feud between two or more persons. A murder committed after the proclamation of a feud was considered an ‘honest murder’, and unlike ordinary murders, which normally received capital punishment, could be expiated with fines. The feud right is mentioned in almost all electoral charters from 1513 to 1648.\n\nThe King and noblemen, as well as high officials, had the right to receive conveyance from farmers. The right was never a formal right, but rather a consequence of the ‘conveyance duty’ which was imposed on farmers. Conveyance duty (Norwegian: \"skyssplikt\") is known since the 12th century and functioned as indirect taxation. In 1816, the duty was changed from being a free service to receiving payment per trip. However, the partial tax freedom which conveyance farmers had was abolished at the same time.\n\nIn 1646, the nobility achieved the possibility of having ‘neck and hand right’ (Norwegian: \"hals- og håndsrett\"), that is, the authority to arrest and to prosecute persons and to execute judgments. This right was limited to farms or fiefs over which noblemen had jurisdiction.\n\nRelated to the neck and hand right was the ‘charge and fine right’ (Norwegian: \"sikt- og sakefallsrett\"), that is, the authority to raise a charge against and to fine persons. This right, too, was limited to each nobleman's area of jurisdiction.\n\nThe birk right (Norwegian: \"birkerett\") was the authority to appoint judges at the birk court, etcetera; birks were an ancient form of local jurisdiction adopted in Norway on the Danish model. Nine birks were created in 1649, but abolished already in 1651. The first real birks came in 1671 with the creation of the Countship of Larvik, in 1673 with the creation of the Countship of Griffenfeld, and in 1678 with the creation of the Barony of Rosendal. In addition the birk right was granted to the Halsnøy Monastery in 1661, the Lysekloster Estate in 1661, and the Svanøy Estate in 1685. The two countship birks and the barony birk lasted until 1821, when they were ‘entirely abolished’.\n\nThe \"jus patronatus\" (patronage right) consisted of \"jus presentandi\", the right to propose clergy for a specific church, and later became \"jus vocandi\", the right to appoint such clergy. Furthermore, the patron had the right to part of the church taxes and other income of the church. Jus patronatus did not have any relevance in Norway until after the 1640s, when a few noblemen began to receive it. This privilege was never widespread in the Kingdom.\n\nAround 1277, lendmen and skutilsveins received tax freedom for themselves and two members of their household, and ordinary members of the hird received the same, but for one member of their household.\n\nIn 1548, the nobility's attempts to weaken farmers’ allodial land right (Norwegian: \"odelsrett\") were rejected by the King and the Danish Council of the Kingdom.\n\nThe use of coats of arms was originally a custom developed and maintained by the nobility, but it was not exclusive to this estate. Norwegian farmers and burghers, as well as the non-noble parts of the clergy, had since early times borne arms in addition to more commonly used house marks.\n\nWhile the arms of the old nobility were of ancient origin and inherited through generations within each family, and therefore were not a (known) privilege from the King, the arms of the new nobility were often granted by the King upon ennoblement. In some cases, the ennobled person's former coat of arms or his wishes could be regarded in the process of composing new arms and achievements.\n\nHelm\nAccording to Dano-Norwegian custom, both nobles and non-nobles could use an open helm above the shield. (In Sweden, open helms were a privilege exclusive for the nobility.) Nobles used one, barons used two, and counts used three helms. Alternatively, counts’ helms had eleven bars and barons’ helms had seven bars.\n\nCoronet\nNoble coronets (Norwegian: \"adelskrone\") or coronets of rank (\"rangkrone\"), whether physical coronets or appearing in heraldic artwork, were reserved for the nobility. There were specific coronets for counts, barons, and nobility. In addition, the Golden Lions—illegitimate royal descendants—had an exclusive coronet.\n\nSupporters\nSupporters were normally given only to counts.\n\nMotto\nSome noble families have mottos. These are always in Latin.\n\nExamples:\n\n\nAlmost unique internationally and different from the continental nobility, where families have named themselves after the piece of land that they possess, Nordic nobles have since the 16th century in general adopted family names of an abstract and artistical character, often based on their respective coats of arms. For example, the noble family whose arms were a golden star, took the name Gyldenstierne (). As this custom of the old nobility established itself as permanent, also the new nobility, that is persons and families ennobled after the Medieval Ages, often received similar names when ennobled.\n\nOther examples are Anker (), Gyllenpistol (\"Golden Gun\") in Sweden, Hästesko (\"Horseshoe\") in Sweden, Huitfeldt (\"White Field\"), Løvenørn (\"Lion Eagle\"), Natt och Dag (\"Night and Day\") in Sweden, Rosenvinge (\"Rose Wing\"), Svanenhielm (\"Swan Helm\"), Svinhufvud (\"Swine Head\") in Sweden, and Tordenskiold (\"Thunder Shield\").\n\nParticle\nThe use of particles like \"af\", \"von\", and \"de\"—all these mean \"of\"—was no particular privilege for the nobility, but on the other hand almost exclusively used by and associated with them. Especially in the late 17th century and the 18th century, one would often receive a particle together with one's old or new name when ennobled. Examples are families like de Gyldenpalm (lit. ‘of Goldenpalm’) and, with two particles, von Munthe af Morgenstierne (lit. ‘of Munthe of Morningstar’).\n\nProminent non-noble families having used particles are von Cappelen, von der Lippe, and de Créqui dit la Roche.\n\nPreposition\nA nobleman had the right to write himself \"to\" () the seat farm(s) or the estate(s) on which he resided, for example ‘Sigurd Jonsson til Sudreim’. This preposition must not be confused with particles, which were a part of names.\n\nClothing\nAlready in the Medieval Ages a man was not allowed to dress in clothes implying that he belonged to another estate than his actual.\n\nWhilst commoners could not wear finer clothes than nobles did, the nobility had to make sure they were not better dressed than the King and his family. In 1528 a royal decree decided that no noble could own more than three clothes of silk. No ladies or maids could wear broad bonnets. Pearls in textiles as well as textiles containing gold were reserved for royal persons.\n\nUsually a cloth's value was relatively big. Accessories were no exception. For example, a pearl bonnet alone could cost as much as 100 dollars; this was three years' salary for a carpenter. Expensive were also gold chains, bonnets with ostrich feathers, etcetera. As such clothes were not only a matter of dressing, but also a part a family's capital.\n\nSlitted clothes were usual among (female) nobles. This would reveal that a garment had two layers of textile.\n\nEducation\nMany noblemen received their education at the Sorø Academy in Denmark, a knight academy. Young men of the high nobility studied also at German universities.\n\n16th and 17th century\nDuring their trade with foreigners the nobility acquired luxurious products, for example chocolates, saffron, cinnamon, nutmeg, olive, and citrus. They desired and received new technology, such as stoves and bracket clocks. Also living animals were popular.\n\nIt was customary to give each other presents, for example horses, precious metals, and exotic fruits, especially to more important nobles or if one wished a service in return.\n\nA case of exceptional dimensions was when William IV, Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel asked whether Tycho Brahe in Denmark was able to get him some reindeers. Brahe wrote to his relative Axel Gyldenstierne, Governor-general of Norway, and after some struggle Gyldenstierne was able to find five animals, of which two were sent by ship to Brahe.\n\nA large number of Norwegians may trace ancestral lines back to members of various levels of medieval aristocracy. They must very often cross numerous cognatic links () and go back to the 16th century in order to establish a connection to the nobility. (An important consideration in this regard is that many experts dispute some popularly accepted family relations, which they consider undocumented or obviously wrong.) Queen Sonja of Norway, born a commoner, has noblemen among her distant forefathers.\n\nWhilst nearly all families of medieval aristocracy have become patrilineally extinct, there are families today whose patrilineal ancestors were close cognatic descendants of old noble families, for example some Nordland families, the most prominent being the Ellingsen family, whose progenitor shipper and tradesman Elling Christophersen was a great-grandson of Margrethe Jonsdotter Benkestok, and the Christensen family of the Husby Estate, whose progenitor shipper and tradesman Anders Christensen was a great-great-grandson of aforementioned Margrethe.\n\nEven though a family could lose their noble status, they would usually keep their land and fortune. There are examples of non-noble descendants who have inherited previously noble land centuries after the noble family concerned had become patrilineally extinct. One example is the estate of the Benkestok family, who lost their noble status in the late 16th century and disappeared patrilineally after 1672. The estate originally consisted of land in Eastern, Western, and Northern Norway as well as on the Faroe Islands and Shetland. Whilst the first generations of inheritors received large portions of land, it would subsequently be divided into smaller and smaller parts so that inheritors of later generations each received, be it, a large farm.\n\nConcerning descent from royalty through nobility, nobility expert Tore Vigerust has stated, though as a conservative estimate, that roughly 10,000 Norwegians living today can document with certainty their descent from the old kings of Norway and European royal houses. Vigerust has identified the noble families Gyldenløve of Austrått and Rosensverd as families whose royal descent is verifiable.\n\nExamples:\n\n\nA considerably smaller number of Norwegians descend from families of modern aristocracy, patrilineally as well as through cognatic links. Among such descendants, one finds several nationally and even internationally prominent persons.\n\nExamples:\n\n\nThrough many ages, common people have desired either to be noble or to descend from members of this estate. This has led some to construct fraudulent \"ahnentafels\" (pedigree charts) or to accept erroneous ahnentafels.\n\nAn extreme case of such ahnentafels is that of Jon Bratt Otnes (1919–2004). Otnes was born into the lowest class of the farmer estate; his father was a cotter (). In the 1970s and with a heavily erroneous ahnentafel, Otnes began to claim publicly that he was the current head of the Medieval noble family of Brat/Bratt and that he thus could have been King of Norway and of Sweden. This case caused much controversy between the 1970s and 2000.\n\nDuring parts of the Romantic Nationalist epoch and the subsequent worshipping of Vikings, when it was popular and/or gave a particular high status to demonstrate descent from the 'real' (i.e. Medieval, non-foreign) noble families and kings of Norway, fraudulent pedigrees flourished. This was the case also during the illegitimate National Unification rule during Germany's occupation of Norway (1940–1945).\n\nThe medieval aristocracy called themselves hird and later ‘free men’ likewise as commoners were called ‘unfree’. Knights were gathered in a particular class known as the Knighthood (), which stood above what was called ‘ordinary nobility’ (). The aristocracy did not adopt and use the term ‘nobility’ () until the late 15th and the early 16th century; this originally German word arrived at the same time as the German Oldenburg Kings of Norway. However, the entity was completely the same before and after the introduction of this term.\n\nIn some cases it is difficult to draw a clear border between old nobility alias the medieval aristocracy and new nobility alias the modern aristocracy. A consensual definition is that new nobility are persons and families who were ennobled by letters patent by Norwegian monarchs, primarily monarchs after and including Queen Margaret. Even though the term ‘new nobility’ is often considered as identical with ‘post-medieval nobility’, a not unconsiderable amount of so-called letter-noble families were ennobled and operated politically and militarily in the Late Medieval Age, among others the Rosenvinge family, ennobled in 1505.\n\nOld nobility from Denmark is considered as new nobility in Norway, not least because they represented a new era—that of foreign rule—in Norway's history.\n\nThe high nobility consists of titled persons and families. The low nobility is untitled. This set of term applies mainly to nobility after 1671, when the titles of count and of baron were introduced. Families whose members have had seats in the pre-1536 Council of the Kingdom—the \"Riksråd\"—are considered as high nobility in Norway. They are even known under their own term, \"riksråd nobility\" ().\n\nThe terms sword nobility () and robe nobility () refer to the nobility before and after 1660, respectively.\n\nThese terms are treated in this article's section Modern aristocracy.\n\nUradel (English: lit. ‘primeval nobility’) is an originally German and romantic term that was coined in the 1820s and later adopted into the Norwegian language as well as into Danish and Swedish. The term refers to the medieval aristocracy. The opposite of \"uradel\" is \"brevadel\" (English: lit. ‘letter nobility’).\n\nFarmer nobility (Norwegian: \"bondeadel\") refers to farmers who were noble.\n\nThis term may also be used unofficially to describe farmers who had been noble or who had such ancestry through cognatic links and within a short genealogical timeframe. They were not a part of the Norwegian nobility.\n\nFor example, in 1768, when asked by the authorities in Copenhagen whether there still lived old nobility in the districts Senja and Troms in Northern Norway, a Danish-rooted official wrote: ‘Of old nobility I know nothing here in the north, but here is far too much farmer nobility or Benkestok nobility!’ As an immigrant to the region, he was unfamiliar with the strong feeling of pride among the so-called page nobility (see below) and the farmers of aristocratic origin.\n\nAfter Norway achieved constitutional independence in 1814, in the period of romantic nationalism that followed, the urban ‘cultural élite’ as well as some farmers themselves began to consider the ‘Norwegian farmer’ as representative or a symbolic figure of ‘Norwegianness’. Norwegian farmers had always been relatively free compared to farmers in continental Europe, something to which the lack of a large and strong nobility had contributed. Farmers had in general sufficient amounts of food, and lived ‘in peaceful and natural circumstances’. Furthermore, from the middle of the 18th century, and peaking in the 19th, many Norwegian farmers managed to buy their own farms. Factors like these contributed to some farmers coming to regard themselves as a kind of farmer nobility. Such ideas are reflected, for example, in romantic nationalistic literature, but the term has never had any legal currency in Norway, and such farmers were and remained commoners.\n\nFor example, the teacher Andreas Austlid wrote in his book \"Salt fraa folkehøgskulen\" (1926) about his home parish: ‘An old parish of wealth, broad and satisfied and good – the most beautiful in the whole valley. A kind and calm farmer nobility - but self-supplied [with food], with much good and much low ancestry ...’\n\nPage nobility (; \"knape\" means page or \"boy\") was and is a non-legal term referring to historical and in many cases biological descendants of the clerical setesveins in Northern Norway. As traders and shippers, these descendants in the late 16th and the 17th centuries constituted the leading non-noble class in the region. In the 18th century, however, the term \"knape\" was in general used for all non-privileged traders and shippers regardless of their backgrounds.\n\nIn modern Norwegian language, there are several expressions containing noble terms and titles. Examples are:\n\n\nFurthermore, noble titles are used to describe persons who within respective sections of society have a leading position. Examples are:\n\n\nArticles\n\nCategories\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2144739", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2144739", "title": "Plan Z", "text": "Plan Z\n\nPlan Z was the name given to the planned re-equipment and expansion of the \"Kriegsmarine\" (German navy) ordered by Adolf Hitler in early 1939. The fleet was meant to challenge the naval power of the United Kingdom, and was to be completed by 1948. Development of the plan began in 1938, but it reflected the evolution of the strategic thinking of the \"Oberkommando der Marine\" (Naval High Command) over the two decades following World War I. The plan called for a fleet centered on ten battleships and four aircraft carriers which were intended to battle the Royal Navy. This force would be supplemented with numerous long-range cruisers that would attack British shipping. A relatively small force of U-boats was also stipulated.\n\nWhen World War II broke out in September 1939, almost no work had been done on the new ships ordered under Plan Z. The need to shift manufacturing capacity to more pressing requirements forced the \"Kriegsmarine\" to abandon the construction program, and only a handful of major ships—all of which had been ordered before Plan Z—were completed during the war. Nevertheless, the plan still had a significant effect on the course of World War II, in that only a few dozen U-boats had been completed by the outbreak of war. Admiral Karl Dönitz's U-boat fleet only reached the 300 U-boats he deemed necessary to win a commerce war against Britain in 1943, by which time his forces had been decisively defeated.\n\nFollowing the end of World War I, the German armed forces became subject to the restrictions of the Treaty of Versailles. For the new \"Reichsmarine\", this meant it was limited to six pre-dreadnought battleships, six old light cruisers, 12 destroyers and 12 torpedo boats. A further two pre-dreadnoughts, two cruisers, and four destroyers and torpedo boats apiece could be kept in reserve. The first major ship to be built after the war was the light cruiser in the early 1920s. This was followed by a further three light cruisers of the : , and , and a further two ships that were modified versions of the \"Königsberg\" class, and . At the same time, the Germans created a dummy corporation, NV Ingenieurskantoor voor Scheepsbouw (IvS), in the Netherlands to secretly continue development of submarines. This was in violation of Article 191 of the Treaty of Versailles, which prohibited Germany from possessing or building submarines for any purpose. IvS built several submarines for foreign navies, including the Turkish , which was the basis for the Type I U-boat, and the Finnish , which was the prototype for the Type II U-boat.\n\nThe Treaty also stipulated that Germany could replace its pre-dreadnought battleships after they reached twenty years of age, but new vessels could displace no more than . In response to these limitations, the Germans attempted to build a powerful heavy cruiser—classified as a \"panzerschiff\" (armored ship)—that outclassed the new heavy cruisers built by Britain and France. While British and French heavy cruiser designs were bound by the Washington Naval Treaty (and subsequent London Naval Treaty) to a caliber of on a displacement of 10,000 tons, the Germans chose to arm with six guns. The Germans hoped that by building a ship significantly more powerful than the Allies, they could force the Allies to admit Germany to the Washington treaty system in exchange for cancelling \"Deutschland\", thereby abrogating the naval limitations imposed by Versailles. The French vehemently opposed any concessions to Germany, and therefore, \"Deutschland\" and two further units— and —were built.\n\nIn 1932, the \"Reichsmarine\" secured the passage of the \"Schiffbauersatzplan\" (\"Replacement ship construction program\") through the \"Reichstag\". The program called for two separate production phases, the first from 1930 to 1936, and the second from 1936 to 1943. The latter phase was secretly intended to break the Versailles restrictions. The following year, Adolf Hitler became the Chancellor of Germany. He unilaterally withdrew from the restrictions of the Treaty of Versailles and began the systematic re-building of the armed forces. The prestige brought by the \"Panzerschiffe\" led to two improved vessels, the D class, to be ordered. These ships were cancelled and reordered as the battleships and , which were ships armed with nine 28 cm guns and much greater armor protection than their predecessors. In 1935, Hitler signed the Anglo-German Naval Agreement, which permitted Germany to build up to 35 percent of the strength of the Royal Navy in all warship categories. The initial designs for two follow-on ships—the —initially called for a displacement of with guns, but to counter the two new, French s, the new ships were significantly enlarged, to a displacement of over and guns.\n\nThe postwar German navy was conflicted over what direction future construction should take. In September 1920, \"Konteradmiral\" (Rear Admiral) William Michaelis issued a memorandum laying out the goals of the new \"Reichsmarine\"; these goals emphasized coastal defense rather than significant expansion. The German Army viewed Poland as the primary future enemy, and the Navy assumed that in a conflict with Poland, France would support Poland. Thus, the French Navy would be the most likely opponent for the \"Reichsmarine\"; Britain was expected to remain neutral in such a conflict. The construction of warships through the mid-1930s was primarily directed against the perceived French threat. Any hypothetical U-boats would generally support the main fleet rather than embark on a commerce-raiding campaign, and any raiding would be done strictly according to cruiser rules. This view remained the established orthodoxy until the mid-1930s, when then-\"Kapitän zur See\" (Captain at Sea) Karl Dönitz came to command the U-boat arm. Dönitz advocated a return to unrestricted submarine warfare and the adoption of wolfpack tactics to overwhelm convoy defenses.\n\nIn the 1920s, the question arose over what to do with the cruisers that would presumably be abroad on training cruises when a war would break out. The high command decided that they should operate as independent commerce raiders. When \"Vizeadmiral\" (Vice Admiral) Erich Raeder became the head of the \"Reichsmarine\" in 1928, he fully endorsed the concept of long-range surface raiders. This was in large part due to his service in World War I as the chief of staff to \"Vizeadmiral\" Franz von Hipper, where he saw the fleet rendered impotent by the crushing British naval superiority. By 1938, Hitler's aggressive foreign policy made conflict with Britain increasingly likely. He ordered that completion of and be expedited, along with six new H-class battleships yet to be laid down. These eight battleships would form the core of a new battle fleet capable of engaging the British Royal Navy. Hitler nevertheless assured Raeder that war would not come until 1948.\n\nRaeder meanwhile believed that Britain could be more easily defeated through the surface raider strategy he favored. The initial version of his plan was based on the assumption that the fleet should be centered on \"panzerschiffe\", long-range cruisers, and U-boats to attack British commerce. These forces would tie down British naval power and allow a smaller number of battleships to operate in the North Sea. This first draft was called Plan X; a pared-down revision was renamed Plan Y, and the final version presented to Hitler was Plan Z. Hitler rejected Raeder's proposed construction plan, which led to a more balanced fleet that incorporated the battleships Hitler sought and was accepted on 1 March 1939. Raeder planned to use the battleships and aircraft carriers in task forces to support the \"panzerschiffe\" and light cruisers attacking British merchant traffic.\n\nThe plan approved by Hitler called for a surface fleet composed of the following vessels, which included all new ships built in the 1920s and 1930s:\n\nThese figures included the four \"Scharnhorst\"- and \"Bismarck\"-class battleships already built or building, the three \"Deutschland\"-class \"panzerschiffe\" and the six light cruisers already in service. To complete the core of the Plan Z fleet, six H-class battleships, three O-class battlecruisers, twelve P-class \"panzerschiffe\", and two s with two more of a new design, were to be built. The five ships of the fulfilled the mandate for heavy cruisers, while the M class of light cruisers would fulfill the requirement for light cruisers. The Spähkreuzer 1938 design would form the basis for the fleet scouts ordered in the program. On 27 July 1939, Raeder revised the plan to cancel all twelve of the P-class \"panzerschiffe\".\n\nIn the short time from the introduction of Plan Z to the beginning of war with the United Kingdom on 3 September only two of the plan's large ships, a pair of H class battleships, were laid down; material for the other four ships had started to be assembled in preparation to begin construction but no work had been done. At the time components of the three battlecruisers were in production, but their keels had not yet been laid down. Two of the M-class cruisers had been laid down, but they were also cancelled in late September. Work on was cancelled definitively in 1943 when Hitler finally abandoned the surface fleet after the Battle of the Barents Sea debacle.\n\nSince the plan was cancelled less than a year after it was approved, the positive effects on German naval construction were minimal. All of the ships authorized by the plan were cancelled after the outbreak of war, with only a few major surface vessels that predated the plan completed during the conflict. These included \"Bismarck\" and \"Tirpitz\", along with the heavy cruisers \"Blücher\" and \"Prinz Eugen\". Without the six H-class battleships or the four aircraft carriers, the \"Kriegsmarine\" was once again unable to meet the Royal Navy on equal terms.\n\nMost of the heavy ships of the \"Kriegsmarine\" were used as commerce raiders in the early years of the war. Two of the \"panzerschiffe\", \"Deutschland\" and \"Graf Spee\", were already at sea at the outbreak of war; the former found little success and the latter was ultimately trapped and forced to scuttle after the Battle of the River Plate in December 1939. From October 1940 to March 1941, \"Admiral Scheer\" went on her own raiding operation and captured or sank seventeen ships, which made her the most successful of the German capital ship surface raiders in the entire war. \"Scharnhorst\" and \"Gneisenau\" conducted Operation Berlin, a major sortie into the Atlantic in early 1941. \"Bismarck\" and \"Prinz Eugen\" went on the last Atlantic raiding mission, Operation \"Rheinübung\", in May 1941. \"Bismarck\" sank the British battlecruiser but was herself sunk three days later. The loss of \"Bismarck\" led Hitler to prohibit further sorties into the Atlantic; the remaining capital ships were concentrated in Norway for use as a fleet in being and to threaten convoys to the Soviet Union on the Murmansk Run.\n\nDespite the fact that Plan Z produced no new warships in time for World War II, the plan represented the strategic thinking of the \"Oberkommando der Marine\" (OKM—\"Naval High Command\") at the time. Most significantly, the OKM favored surface combatants over the U-boats Dönitz needed for his submarine campaign in the North Atlantic, which left him with only a handful of submarines at the start of war. The two \"Scharnhorst\"-class battleships cost close to 150 million \"Reichsmarks\" apiece, and the two \"Bismarck\"-class ships cost nearly 250 million \"Reichsmarks\" each; for this amount of money, the Germans could have built more than a hundred additional Type VII U-boats. The shift to the submarine war was not definitively made until 1943, by which time the campaign had already been lost.\n\n"}

The D&B is now the only full-time active duty drum corps in the United States Armed Forces. As one of many United States military bands, the United States Marine Drum & Bugle Corps consists of 80 active-duty Marines dressed in ceremonial red and white uniforms. The D&B performs martial and popular music.\n\nThe United States Marine Drum & Bugle Corps has been officially designated as \"The Commandant's Own\" due to the historical connection with the Commandant of the Marine Corps. The D&B is entirely separate from its sister military band, the United States Marine Band (\"The President's Own\") as well as the 10 active-duty United States Marine Corps field bands. The United States Marine Drum & Bugle Corps travels more than annually, performing in excess of 400 events across the United States and around the world.\n\nDuring the summer months, the D&B performs in conjunction with \"The President's Own\" in the traditional Friday Evening Parades at the Marine Barracks Washington and in the Sunset Parades at the Marine Corps War Memorial (Iwo Jima Monument) in Arlington, Virginia, every Tuesday evening. The parades are not street parades, but military parades consisting of ceremonial pomp that are symbolic of Marine professionalism, discipline, and esprit de corps.\n\nMajor James D. Foley is the sixth and current Director of \"The Commandant's Own\" The United States Drum & Bugle Corps, serving in this position since July of 2018. Captain Nathan Morris is the Executive Officer and Assistant Director. Master Gunnery Sergeant Keith G. Martinez is the twenty-second and current Drum Major. Gunnery Sergeant Joshua Dannemiller is the current Assistant Drum Major.\n\nThe history of the unit can be traced to the early days of the Marine Corps. In the 18th and 19th centuries, military musicians (\"field musics\") provided a means of passing commands to Marines in battle. The sound of various drum beats and bugle calls that could be heard over the noise of the battlefield signaled Marines to attack the enemy or retreat. Through the 1930s, Marine Corps posts still authorized a number of buglers and drummers to play the traditional calls and to ring a ship's bell to signal the time. Until the 1960s, Marine Corps units sported unit drum and bugle corps within their respective rosters.\n\n\"The Commandant's Own\" The United States Marine Drum & Bugle Corps, the only such formation within the Armed Forces today, was formed in 1934 at historic Marine Barracks Washington, to augment the United States Marine Band \"The President's Own\". The unit provided musical support to ceremonies around the nation's capital and, during World War II, was additionally tasked with presidential support duties. For this additional role, they were awarded the scarlet and gold breast cord by President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, which remains on the uniform. When the war ended, the United States Drum and Bugle Corps resumed performing at various military and public ceremonies.\n\nIn the early 1950s, the unit gained considerable acclaim performing for an increasing number of civilian audiences. Originally their instrumentation was similar to the other drum and bugle corps of the era. It has evolved along with the civilian corps, although usually adapting trends after they have become established by civilian corps. Music composed specifically for their unique selection of instruments helped establish their reputation for excellence during this period. These factors also led to the unit's formal designation as \"The Commandant's Own\", a title noting their special status as musicians for the Commandant of the Marine Corps.\n\nIn 1968, Truman Crawford, formerly of the United States Air Force Drum and Bugle Corps became musical arranger and instructor for The Commandant's Own. During his 30-year career he had a large impact on the D&B comparable to that of John Philip Sousa on the United States Marine Band. The new rehearsal facility of \"The Commandant's Own\" at Marine Barracks Washington, is named Truman Crawford Hall in his honor.\n\nLike the United States Marine Band, prior to enlisting each potential member of the Drum and Bugle Corps, all must pass a competitive audition. Unlike members of the President's Own, Drum and Bugle Corps members do undergo Marine Corps Recruit Training, where they are trained in basic infantry tactics.\n\nFollowing Recruit Training and Marine Combat Training, Drum and Bugle Corps members proceed directly to \"The Commandant's Own\" and do not attend Military Occupational Specialty training. The United States Marine Drum and Bugle Corps does not march in parades of state, but instead is held back in reserve by the Commandant of the Marine Corps who may order it anywhere since the corps serves under the Commandant's immediate command.\n\nThe field musicians of the United States Marine Drum & Bugle Corps wear red and white uniforms with white gauntlets which cover the wrists and bear and play silver color brass instruments.\nThe brass played by \"The Commandant's Own\" are bugles pitched in G. Additionally, their bugles are two-valved models similar to those used by drum corps in the United States and Canada prior to 1990. The D&B's current inventory of brass instrumentation was manufactured by the Kanstul Musical Instruments company in 2006.\n\n\n"}

However, the duo would never recapture its initial success. The singles of its second album, \"I Get the Papers\" and \"On the Road Again,\" were only moderate hits. It was a time of rapid change in the hip hop market; gangsta rap was rising in popularity, and Audio Two found itself unsuccessfully struggling to maintain recording contracts and a fanbase. \n\nAudio Two did, however, pave the way for the duo's labelmate MC Lyte, who launched her career with the hit single \"I Cram to Understand U (Sam),\" which went to #1 on the Billboard Hip-Hop chart in 1989.

Along with American Indian allies and fellow provincial regiments, such as Butler's Rangers, the regiment fought a series of low-level raiding campaigns, through the Mohawk Valley. This region was a major agricultural area of New York, and these raids were intended to interdict the supply of foodstuffs to General George Washington's army while pressuring the Revolution's political leaders in the region, who were actively persecuting Loyalist residents as traitors aiding and supplying British troops.\n\nThe regiment eventually comprised two battalions. Following the war, the first battalion was disbanded in 1783 and the second battalion in 1784. Members of the regiment relocated to the British province of Quebec. They were granted land along the St. Lawrence River valley and Bay of Quinte, today within the province of Ontario in Canada.\n\nOn 19 May 1776, Sir John Johnson left his home at Johnson Hall in the Mohawk Valley and travelled with his family and approximately 200 retainers through the Adirondack Mountains to Montreal, Quebec. They arrived on 15 June, just days after Governor Sir Guy Carleton's army recaptured the city. Johnson soon left Montreal to chase the retreating Continental Army southwards down the Richelieu Valley towards Lake Champlain. He met Carleton at Fort Chambly, where the Governor authorized Johnson to raise the King's Royal Regiment of New York.\n\nInitially, the members of the regiment comprised Johnson's refugee retainers from his estates in the Mohawk Valley, but the steady stream of Loyalist refugees fleeing to Montreal provided a ready source of recruits for the King's Royal Yorkers.\n\nPart of the British Army's strategy to defeat the Continental forces under General Washington involved invading New York from Canada along the traditional Lake Champlain and Lake George water route. A main army from Canada, under the command of Sir John Burgoyne, advanced southwards along this route towards Albany. A second army, under the command of Colonel Barry St. Leger, advanced from Carleton Island in the Saint Lawrence River to Oswego with the intention of descending the Mohawk River valley. St. Leger's army included a small force of regular British soldiers, a large American Indian contingent comprising Six Nations and Canadian Indian warriors, a contingent of Hessian soldiers, volunteers under Joseph Brant's command, and the King's Royal Yorkers under Johnson's command.\n\nSt. Leger's army besieged Fort Stanwix (located in modern Rome, New York), which was defended by a sizable contingent of Continental Army troops. During the siege, a relief column of 800 men under the command of General Nicholas Herkimer and comprising New York militia advanced towards Fort Stanwix. On 6 August 1777, this relief force was ambushed by American Indian and King's Royal Yorkers at the Battle of Oriskany. During the battle, the relief column was decimated and suffered over 400 casualties, including Herkimer himself, who eventually died of wounds. Routed, the surviving American militia retreated from Oriskany.\n\nDuring the Oriskany engagement, the garrison of Fort Stanwix attacked the encampment of the Crown forces. Johnson and his family were nearly captured, and large quantities of material were seized. Having suffered heavy casualties during the battle, St. Leger's American Indian allies were demoralized by the loss of their camp. The Crown and Indian forces retreated back towards Lake Ontario when reports of another relief force under the command of Benedict Arnold was received.\n\nFor the remainder of the Revolution, the King's Royal Yorkers formed an integral part of Canada's garrison. However, each year the regiment sent parties on raids into the Mohawk and neighbouring valleys for the purposes of rescuing beleaguered Loyalists and interfering with the ability of the Continental Army forces to use the region's crops as a source of food for Washington's army. These raids were generally launched from the Lake Champlain corridor or from Oswego, and caused a great deal of disruption. The militia of Northern New York never recovered from the disaster at Oriskany, and the region stood relatively defenseless.\n\nIn 1780, a large raid in to the Schoharie Valley led by Sir John Johnson gave rise to the destruction of large numbers of farms and pitched battles between the raiders and the demoralized American militia. (Battle of Klock's Field)\n\nNew York City remained in British hands until the end of the war, behind the protection of its large garrison and the Royal Navy. However, the inability of British commanders to defeat the Revolution led the war to drag on for eight years, resulting in the Continental Army's capture of two major British armies (\"Battle of Saratoga\", \"Battle of Yorktown\") and eroding the British political will to attempt a military solution. As a result, the government of Lord North collapsed and the new British government was formed from parliamentary advocates of a negotiated peace.\n\nThe Treaty of Paris of 1783 ended the war but left little opportunity for Loyalists to return to their former homes. Municipal and state government in the new United States were held by supporters of Congress. Few of the former rebels were prepared to forget, no less forgive, the punishing raids by the Loyalist regiments in Canada. Still other Congressional sympathizers had enjoyed profit by selling land, homes and farms seized from Loyalists. Under the Treaty, the Loyalists were to be compensated for their losses by the State governments under the arbitration of the United States government. This compensation was never paid. Instead, the British government offered land grants in Canada to the refugees who had fled their homes during the War and those who left afterwards.\n\nIn 1783, the 1st Battalion of the King's Royal Yorkers was disbanded and settled along the St. Lawrence Valley in the vicinity of Cornwall in modern Stormont and Dundas counties. The following year, the 2nd Battalion was disbanded and settled in modern Frontenac and Lennox and Addington counties.\n\nSir John Johnson settled in Montreal and also held farms in Williamstown, Ontario and the seigneuries of Monnoir and Argenteuil in Quebec. He was buried in a family vault at Mont Saint-Gregoire, Quebec.\n\nOther officers of the regiment have known graves. Jeremiah French, a lieutenant in the second battalion, was buried at the Maple Grove Cemetery, west of Cornwall, Ontario. In 2004, a new gravestone was dedicated for French in the presence of several of his descendants and members of the recreated King's Royal Yorkers.\n\nIn 1975, a living history regiment reenacting the King's Royal Yorkers was raised in Ontario. The reenactment King's Royal Yorkers are the largest and most active living history unit in Canada.\n\n\n"}

During her career between 1939 and 1959, she won six Grand Slam singles titles as well as numerous doubles and mixed doubles titles. At the end of the 1955 tennis season, Lance Tingay of the London \"Daily Telegraph\" ranked her world No. 1 for the year.\n\nLouise Brough was born in Oklahoma City in 1923. Her family moved to Beverly Hills, California when she was four years old. She learned to play tennis on the public courts at Roxbury Park and was coached by Dick Skeen. In 1940 and 1941, she won the U.S. Girls' Championships.\n\nIn women's doubles, Brough never failed to reach the quarterfinals at the 32 Grand Slam tournaments she played during her career. She reached the semifinals 29 times and the final 28 times. She usually teamed with her longtime friend Margaret Osborne duPont. They won their first U. S. doubles title as a team at the 1942 U.S. National Championships. That was the first of nine consecutive doubles titles at the U. S. national tournament. This was the longest championship run in history in any event at any Grand Slam tournament. Their attempt at a tenth consecutive title was unsuccessful because Osborne duPont was injured and unable to play the 1951 U.S. Nationals. Osborne duPont also did not play there in 1952. In 1953, their winning streak as a team at the U.S. Nationals reached 42 before they lost to Doris Hart and Shirley Fry in the final, 6–2, 7–9, 9–7. Their career record as a team at the U.S. National Championships was 58–2, winning twelve of the 14 times they entered the tournament and losing only 12 sets in those 60 matches. They played Wimbledon as a team seven times, winning five titles and compiling a 33–2 record. At the French International Championships, they won three titles and had a 14–1 record. Combining their record at these three Grand Slam tournaments, they had a win-loss record of 105–5, 95.45 percent and won 20 titles out of 25 attempts.\n\nIn singles, Brough won the U.S. title in 1947 after being the runner-up in 1942 and 1943. Although she appeared in three more singles finals, this would remain her only U.S. singles title. In 1948, she had a match point at 6–5 in the third set against duPont. She also had three match points in the 1954 final against Doris Hart, the first at 5–4 in the third set and two more at 6–5 in that set.\n\nAt Wimbledon, Brough won three consecutive singles titles from 1948 through 1950, with her fourth and last title coming in 1955. From 1946 through 1955, she appeared in seven Wimbledon singles finals. She also appeared in 21 of the 30 finals contested at Wimbledon in singles, women's doubles, and mixed doubles during those ten years. In 1948 and 1950, she won the rare \"triple\" at Wimbledon, sweeping the singles, women's doubles, and mixed doubles titles. Alongside duPont, she won five doubles titles there. She also won four mixed doubles titles there with partners Tom Brown, John Bromwich, and Eric Sturgess.\n\nBrough entered the Australian National Championships only once, in 1950, when she won the singles and women's doubles titles. She played the French International Championships four times between 1946 and 1950, with her best result in singles being the semifinals. The slow clay courts in Paris were not suitable to her attacking style of play. However, she won women's doubles titles there in 1946, 1947, and 1949.\n\nBrough came very close in 1950 to winning a calendar year Grand Slam in women's doubles. She had already won the title at the Australian Championships with Doris Hart. And she would go on to win the titles at Wimbledon and the U.S. Championships, both with Osborne duPont. At the French International Championships, Brough and Osborne duPont reached the final and were heavy favorites to defeat Hart and Shirley Fry. But the underdogs prevailed, 1–6, 7–5, 6–2. This was Brough's first defeat in a Grand Slam women's doubles match since the 1947 Wimbledon final.\n\nIn summary, Brough won 13 titles at Wimbledon, 17 titles at the U.S. National Championships, three titles at the French International Championships, and two titles at the Australian National Championships. Her 35 Grand Slam titles ties her with Doris Hart for fifth on the all-time list, behind only Margaret Smith Court, Martina Navratilova, Billie Jean King, and Margaret Osborne duPont.\n\nAccording to John Olliff and Lance Tingay of the London \"Daily Telegraph\" and the \"Daily Mail\", Brough was ranked in the world top 10 from 1946 through 1957 (no rankings issued from 1940 through 1945), reaching a career high of world No. 1 in 1955. She was included in the year-end top 10 rankings issued by the United States Lawn Tennis Association (USLTA) from 1941 through 1950 and from 1952 through 1957. She was the top ranked US player in 1947. Her 16 years in the USLTA top 10 put her behind only Billie Jean King (18 years) and Chris Evert (19 years).\n\nBud Collins regarded her as one of the great volleyers in history. He wrote, \"A willowy blonde, 5-foot-71/2, she was quiet but the killer in the left court when at play alongside duPont.\" Beside her aggressive volleys, her strengths were her backhand and a paralyzing American twist serve with a high kick. Alice Marble wrote about Brough's serve, \"She gets an enormously high bounce on this serve, and women are notoriously feeble in their effort to return it, especially on the backhand.\"\n\nBrough married Pasadena dentist Dr. Alan Clapp on August 9, 1958 and retired from tennis competitions one year later. She taught juniors in California for the following 20 years. She was inducted in the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 1967. Occasionally she played in local tournaments in California and in senior tournaments, winning the doubles title at the U.S. Hard Court Senior Championships alongside Barbara Green Weigandt in 1971 and 1975. Her husband died in 1999. She died at her home in Vista, California, on February 3, 2014 at the age of 90 and left no children.\n\nR = tournament restricted to French nationals and held under German occupation.\n\n"}

The film was adapted from a serial of the same title by Thomas T. Flynn, first published in \"The Saturday Evening Post\" in 1954, and thereafter as a novel in 1955.\n\n\"The Man from Laramie\" was one of the first Westerns to be filmed in CinemaScope to capture the vastness of the scenery. The film was also shot in Technicolor. This is the fifth and final Western collaboration between Anthony Mann and James Stewart.\n\nThe movie's theme song of the same name, written by Lester Lee and Ned Washington, was recorded in the United States by Al Martino and in the United Kingdom by Jimmy Young. Young's version topped the UK Singles Chart for four weeks in October 1955, while Martino's version (which did not chart in the U.S.) stalled at Number 19 that September.\n\nWill Lockhart delivers supplies from Laramie to Coronado, an isolated western town. He immediately ends up tangling with the Waggomans, influential owners of the massive Barb Ranch. Lockhart is quietly searching for information about someone who sold repeating rifles to the Apaches; his brother, a green Army lieutenant, was one of many soldiers killed in an Apache attack on a far reach of the Barb Ranch.\n\nPatriarch Alec Waggoman is haunted by dreams of a stranger who intends to kill his adult son, Dave. He is also gradually losing his eyesight and cannot count on the immature and vicious Dave.\n\nLockhart is told by Barbara Waggoman, Alec's niece, that he can collect salt for free and haul it away for freight but Dave Waggoman accuses him of stealing, shoots six of Lockhart's mules and burns his three wagons. Lockhart returns to town, engaging first Dave and then ranch foreman Vic Hansbro in a fistfight. Alec shows up and offers Lockhart restitution for his lost property. Sheriff Tom Quigby suggests that Lockhart then leave town to avoid trouble.\n\nLockhart continues searching for the gun runner. Local drunk Chris Boldt tells him that he may know something, but is killed soon after being seen with Lockhart, leading Sheriff Quigby to briefly arrest Lockhart.\n\nVic considers himself a second son to Alec and is engaged to marry Barbara. Alec depends on and respects Vic, but holds him responsible for the damage Dave caused to Lockhart's property and threatens to take it out of Vic's pay.\n\nDave starts a gunfight and is shot in the hand by Lockhart. Lockhart is overpowered, and Dave shoots him through the hand with Lockhart's own gun.\n\nAfterwards, Vic rides after Dave and catches him trying to contact the Apaches to deliver 200 repeating rifles for which the Apaches have paid Vic and Dave in advance. Vic is forced to shoot and kill Dave in self-defense, and then lets Alec believe that Lockhart was responsible.\n\nLockhart takes refuge with a rival rancher, Kate Canady, who wishes she and Waggoman, her long-ago fiancé before he married Dave's future mother, could declare a truce.\n\nAlec goes over some old bills and finds a bill for wire fence that is very overpriced. He suspects that it conceals a rifle purchase and sets out to discover for himself if Dave was both stealing from him and selling rifles to the Apaches. Vic is unable to talk him out of it, so just before they reach the wagon, the two scuffle and Alec is accidentally pushed off his horse and down a hill. Assuming the old man is dead, Vic rides away.\n\nLockhart finds Alec alive and takes him to Kate to tend to his wounds. When he regains consciousness, Alec is able to tell Lockhart about Dave and Vic and the rifles. Lockhart finds Vic using a smoke signal to call for the Apaches to come for their rifles. Lockhart forces Vic to help him push the wagon off the hilltop and destroy the rifles, then finds he is unable to gun Vic down in cold blood. Vic rides away, but is intercepted and killed by the Apaches.\n\nAlec and Kate plan to get married. Barbara intends to leave Coronado and head back east. As Lockhart leaves town, he tells Barbara she will be passing through Laramie on the way and to ask anyone where to find Captain Lockhart, confirming that he is an officer in the U.S. Cavalry.\n\n\nProducer Aaron Rosenberg says that the reason Stewart and Mann never worked together again after \"The Man From Laramie\" was a disagreement over the quality of \"Night Passage\", which according to Mann (who worked pre-production) was \"trash\". Mann quit the movie, feeling that Stewart was only making the film so he could play his accordion, something that enraged Stewart so much that the two didn't speak again.\n\n\n"}

Phifer is currently an Area Scout for the Detroit Lions.\n\nPhifer played for the New England Patriots, the New York Jets, the St. Louis Rams, and the New York Giants where he played in 211 NFL games and made 1134 tackles, 882 were solo, 252 assisted, 29 sacks, and 11 interceptions and was a four-time Pro Bowl Alternate. Phifer played football and majored in history at the University of California Los Angeles and is a graduate of South Mecklenburg High School in Charlotte, North Carolina.\n\nPhifer was a two-time All-Conference selection, earning All-County and Charlotte Post Athlete of the Year honors as a senior at South Mecklenburg. He was a three-year letterman in football and basketball and also competed in track and field in the high jump (6′6″) and triple jump (44′8″).\n\nAs a senior at UCLA, Phifer totaled 71 tackles (9 for a loss) 3 interceptions and 3 sacks and was named an honorable mention All-America. He missed the 1989 season due to an off-field beating incident along with teammate Damion Lyons. Their prior year, 1988, Phifer was primarily a special teams player, recorded 14 tackles (seven unassisted) on defense. As a Sophomore in 1987 he recorded 27 tackles, including one for a loss. He redshirted his freshman year of 1986.\n\nPre-draft measurables\nPhifer was 6'2\" and 230 pounds and bench pressed 380 pounds and ran a 4.73 forty-yard dash. Scouts said, \"An underrated outside linebacker who came on strong his senior year. Very good open field tackler with legitimate speed and cover ability, Uses his quickness in rushing the passer.\" \n\nHe was drafted in the 2nd round (31st overall pick) in the 1991 NFL Draft by the Rams out of UCLA. While at UCLA one of his roommates was the late Eric Turner. On July 17, 1991, Phifer signed a 3-year $1.5 million contract with the Rams, including a $450,000 signing bonus. He started as a rookie in 1991 until an ankle injury ended his season. He totaled 24 tackles on the season (21 solo).\n\nPhifer was a starter for the Rams from 1992–1998. In 1992 Phifer made 66 tackles (51 solo) and defensed six passes. Phifer led the Rams in tackles in 1993 from his \"Will'\" or outside linebacker position. In the summer of 1994 the restricted free agent Phifer signed a tender-offer of $649,000. However, since Phifer and his agent felt there were no negotiations he was reluctant to sign a further deal. Phifer had another solid season in 1994. However, during the confusion of the Rams moving from Los Angeles to St. Louis, Phifer signed a four-year, $8.5 million contract that includes a $2.5 million signing bonus. He was the Rams' Ed Block Courage Award winner in 1995. He was also a Pro Bowl alternate in 1995 and led the Rams in tackles 1995 with 125 to go with his 3 sacks, 3 interceptions a forced fumble and a fumble recovery. He again led Rams tackles in 1996 with 122, when he was again voted a Pro Bowl alternate.\n\nIn his years with the Rams he played under several different defensive coordinators. Under his first coach the Rams featured the Chicago Bears-style \"46\" defense that was brought in by recent Tennessee Titans Head coach Jeff Fisher. The next season it changed to a less pressure defense to more of a standard NFL defenses. In 1995 that changed with a new defensive coordinator who introduced the Rams \"Jet\" defense, where the lineman were in pass rush mode at all times. A couple of years later he began to play in Bud Carson's multiple defenses where Roman was asked to rush the passer more. In the \"Jet\" defense he was often the only LBer on the field and was asked to cover running backs in coverage and still stop running plays. It was under Carson's defense that Phifer would play the equivalent of a safety on one play and the equivalent of defensive end on another play and a run-stuffing linebacker on another and a pass-cover linebacker as yet a fourth way to play defense. In 1998, he had a career-high 6.5 sacks and 71 tackles with an interception a forced fumble and a fumble recovery on an improving Rams defense, with his career high in sacks being the result of playing standup defensive end some of the snaps.\n\nThe Rams stated they wanted to keep Phifer but reportedly acted too slow to sign Phifer and on March 6, 1999, he signed a 3-year $8.9 million contract with the New York Jets. Less than six days later the Rams signed Patriot linebacker Todd Collins so replace Phifer. Phifer played two seasons for the Jets getting 4.5 sacks, 3 forced fumbles in 1999 along with 2 interceptions and 50 tackles. In 2000, he had 45 tackles and 4 sacks. After the 2000 season the Jets released Phifer in an effort to \"revamp the linebacking corps\" into a younger group and also to switch from a 3-4 defense to a 4-3, causing Phifer to not be able to earn the approximately $2.5 million due in 2001 of his 3-year contract signed in 1999.\n\nThe New England Patriots signed Phifer to a 1-year veteran minimum contract of $520,000. Phifer started 16 games and recorded 93 tackles for the 2001 Super Bowl Champion Patriots. He also had 2 sacks, defensed 5 passes, intercepted a pass, forced 2 fumbles and recovered 2 fumbles. Even more he provided leadership and was essential to the Patriots success. \"Roman Phifer is the MVP of the season\", said cornerback Terrell Buckley, \"He may be overlooked, and he would never campaign for the honor but he deserves it.\" \n\nPhifer making the Super Bowl was one of the side-show stories of Super Bowl week with the St. Louis and the Boston-area papers doing feature stories on Phifer's Rams connection and now playing them in the \"big game\" He helped the Patriots to win Super Bowl XXXVI and was rewarded on the off season. On June 21, 2002, the Patriots offered Phifer a 3-year $4.5 million contract with $1.8 million in signing bonuses. When the season finally came around in 2002 Phifer made 109 tackles and started 14 games and was again an alternate to the AFC-NFC Pro Bowl.\n\nIn 2003, he had 100 tackles and batted away 5 passes as the Patriots won Super Bowl XXXVIII. In the Super Bowl, Phifer made 5 tackles and nearly intercepted a Jake Delhome pass, but it would have been nullified due to a roughing call on tackle Richard Seymour. After the season Phifer was a Pro Bowl Alternate for the fourth time in his career.\n\nThe 2004 season saw Phifer play a backup role in the Patriot defense. He struggled with an injured calf and his role had diminished as well. He ended the season with 40 tackles, a sack, and interception, a fumble recovery and knocked down two passes as the Patriots won Super Bowl XXXIX in Jacksonville, Florida. Phifer's contract expired at the end of the season. He was released on February 27, 2005.\n\nHe had a short stint with the New York Giants in 2005, signing a veteran-minimum contract that yielded him approximately $150,000 for two weeks work. He came in for one last chance and to bring leadership to the Giants, perhaps similar to what he brought to the Patriots in his 2001 season.\n\nIn his career, he played in 211 games. 1134 tackles, 882 were solo, 252 assisted, 29 sacks, and 11 interceptions.\n\nOn February 9, 2009, Phifer was hired as the assistant linebackers coach for the Denver Broncos, assisting linebackers coach Don Martindale. Phifer helped outside linebacker Elvis Dumervil achieve a league-leading and franchise record 17 sacks on the season and Pro Bowl berth, as well as making inside linebacker D.J. Williams a Pro Bowl alternate after ranking 11th in the league with a team-high 122 tackles.\n\nIn 2009 Phifer produced his first documentary film entitled \"Blood Equity\", which covers the lives of several former NFL players, both big stars and rank-and-file players. The film features testimonials from NFL legends like Mike Ditka, Tony Dorsett, Darryl \"Moose\" Johnston and Willie Wood among others about the hardships and struggles of life after football. \"He's like the Godfather of football, and you definitely get that from him when he lights up that cigar. These guys are like brothers, and he's just trying to speak on their behalf\", says Rico McClinton of Iron Mike Ditka (McClinton produced the film along with Phifer and Joe Ruggiero).\n\nThe \"Los Angeles Times\", in reviewing the documentary stated, \"Everybody who plays leaves with something\", says retired New York Giants linebacker Harry Carson in the documentary \"Blood Equity\" but, sadly, he doesn't mean a glorious pension or athletic pride. He's referring to the physical and mental struggles of ex-football players who feel monetarily neglected by the now $7.1-billion sport and its union when, as studies increasingly show, the game's built-in brutality—and fierce pride in playing injured—leads to a post-career life of constant medical care. . . (Footage of Baltimore Colts legend John Mackey not recognizing family photos is especially heartbreaking.)\" Blood equity is distributed by Walking Shadows and is sold in popular online retailers such as Barnes & Noble, Amazon, Hastings, Alibris, among others. Phifer is hoping that his message reaches those who have rooted for NFL players during their playing years.\n\n"}

The embracing nude couple depicted in the sculpture appeared originally as part of a group of reliefs decorating Rodin's monumental bronze portal \"The Gates of Hell\", commissioned for a planned museum of art in Paris. The couple were later removed from the \"Gates\" and replaced with another pair of lovers located on the smaller right-hand column.\n\nThe sculpture, \"The Kiss\", was originally titled Francesca da Rimini, as it depicts the 13th-century Italian noblewoman immortalised in Dante's \"Inferno\" (Circle 2, Canto 5) who falls in love with her husband Giovanni Malatesta's younger brother Paolo. Having fallen in love while reading the story of Lancelot and Guinevere, the couple are discovered and killed by Francesca's husband. In the sculpture, the book can be seen in Paolo's hand. The lovers' lips do not actually touch in the sculpture, suggesting that they were interrupted and met their demise without their lips ever having touched.\n\nWhen critics first saw the sculpture in 1887, they suggested the less specific title \"Le Baiser\" (\"The Kiss\").\n\nRodin indicated that his approach to sculpting women was of homage to them and their bodies, not just submitting to men but as full partners in ardor. The consequent eroticism in the sculpture made it controversial. A bronze version of \"The Kiss\" ( high) was sent for display at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago. The sculpture was considered unsuitable for general display and relegated to an inner chamber with admission only by personal application.\n\nRodin's method of making large sculptures was to employ assistant sculptors to copy a smaller model made from a material which was easier to work than marble. Once they had finished, Rodin himself would put the finishing touches to the larger version.\n\nBefore creating the marble version of \"The Kiss\", Rodin produced several smaller sculptures in plaster, terracotta and bronze.\n\nIn 1888, the French government ordered the first large-scale marble version of \"The Kiss\" from Rodin for the 1889 \"Exposition universelle\", but it was publicly displayed for the first time in the \"Salon de la Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts\" in 1898. It was so popular that the company \"Barbedienne\" offered Rodin a contract to produce a limited number of smaller copies in bronze. In 1900 the statue was moved to the Musée du Luxembourg before being taken to its current location, the Musée Rodin, in 1918.\n\nIn 1900, Rodin made a copy for Edward Perry Warren, an eccentric American collector who lived in Lewes in Sussex, England, with his collection of Greek antiquities and his lover John Marshall. After seeing \"The Kiss\" in the Salon de Paris, the painter William Rothenstein recommended it to Warren as a possible purchase, but \"The Kiss\" had been commissioned by the French government and was not available for sale. In its place, Rodin offered to make a copy and Warren offered half of its original price (10,000 francs, instead of 20,000), but Rodin would not lower the price. The contract for the commission included that \"the genitals of the man must be complete.\" A previous letter explained that \"being a pagan and lover of antiquities\", Warren hoped that the genitals of the man would be sculpted prominently in the Classical Greek tradition rather than modestly hidden.\n\nWhen the sculpture arrived in Lewes in 1904, Warren placed it in the stables at the back of his home, Lewes House, on School Hill, where it remained for a decade. It is not known whether this location was chosen due to the great size of the sculpture or because it did not fulfil Warren's expectations. In 1914 the sculpture was loaned to the Lewes town council and put on public display in the Town Hall. A number of puritanical local residents, led by headmistress Miss Fowler-Tutt, objected to the erotic nature of the sculpture. They were particularly concerned that it might encourage the ardour of the large number of soldiers who were billeted in the town at that time, and successfully campaigned to have the sculpture draped and screened from public view. It was returned to Warren's residence at Lewes House in 1917 where it remained stored in the stable for 12 years until Warren's death in 1928. The beneficiary of Warren's will, H. Asa Thomas, put the sculpture up for sale with Gorringes, the local auctioneers, but it failed to meet its reserve price and was withdrawn from sale. A few years later it was loaned to the Tate Gallery in London. In 1955 the Tate bought the sculpture for the nation at a cost of £7,500. In 1999 between 5 June and 30 October, \"The Kiss\" returned briefly to Lewes as part of an exhibition of Rodin's works. Its regular home is now the Tate Modern - however, in September 2007, the work was transferred to the Tate Liverpool, Albert Dock where it assumed pride of place for the duration of the celebrations surrounding both that city's 8th Centenary and Liverpool's European Capital of Culture status in 2008. It was on loan to Auckland Art Gallery Toi o Tāmaki in Auckland, New Zealand until 16 July 2017. It was loaned to Christchurch Mansion in Ipswich, UK for the 'Kiss and Tell' exhibition running from November 2018 to April 2019.\n\nA third replica was commissioned in 1900 by Carl Jacobsen for his projected museum in Copenhagen, Denmark. The replica was made in 1903, and became part of the initial collection of the Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek, inaugurated in 1906.\n\nThe three larger marble versions were exhibited together at the Musée d'Orsay in 1995. A fourth copy, about in height – compared to for the copy in Paris – was made after the death of Rodin by sculptor Henri-Léon Gréber for the Rodin Museum of Philadelphia. A plaster cast can be found in the Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes of Buenos Aires.\n\nA large numbers of bronze casts have been done of \"The Kiss\". The Musée Rodin reports that the Barbedienne foundry alone produced 319. According to French law issued in 1978, only the first twelve can be called original editions.\n\nIn Spring 2003, artist Cornelia Parker intervened in \"The Kiss\" (1886) with the permission of the Tate Britain gallery, where it was exhibited at the time, by wrapping the sculpture in a mile of string. This was a historical reference to Marcel Duchamp's use of the same length of string to create a web inside a gallery in 1942. Although the intervention had been endorsed by the gallery, many viewers of the sculpture felt it offensive to the original artwork, prompting a further, unauthorised, intervention, in which Parker's string was cut by Stuckist Piers Butler, while couples stood around engaging in live kissing.\n\n\"The Kiss\" is said to have been the influence for the song \"Turn Of The Century\", found on the 1977 release of \"Going For The One\" by the British band Yes.\n\n\"The Kiss\" is figured into the plot of the \"All in the Family\" episode \"Archie and \"The Kiss\",\" where Archie Bunker tries to make his daughter, Gloria, give back a reproduction of the sculpture she had been given by the Bunkers' friend, Irene Lorenzo. Archie expresses his disgust over the morality of the sculpture and sexuality in artwork.\n\nThe statue is used for a Terry Gilliam animation in \"Monty Python's Flying Circus\". The female extends her left leg straight out, and the male moves his right hand over it, covering holes with the fingers and playing her like an ocarina.\n\n\"The Kiss\" was part of a side story in Cynthia D'Aprix Sweeney's debut novel \"The Nest\", where the sculpture is stolen from the rubble of ground Zero after 9/11.(2016)\n\nIn the original life-sized work, the male is in an aroused condition. In most American miniatures, this has been censored, and shows the male in a neutral gender.\n\n\n"}

The company was originally family owned but in November 1995 was sold to a management team. In May 1998, the company was sold to Japanese investors. It was later found that £29 million of shares that should have been distributed to ordinary workers through the employee ownership scheme (REBTL) had been transferred to Tim Ingram Hill, one of the management team. A prolonged legal battle ensued, the courts declaring the transaction void and ordering Mr Ingram Hill to repay the profit he made from the shares he appropriated. As of January 2020, due to a dispute with HMRC, the money has still not been distributed to the staff who should have received it. An Early Day Motion was tabled in Parliament in September 2019 by Neil Gray MP, who has campaigned extensively on behalf of the staff, criticising HMRC for failing to resolve the dispute. It was reported in July 2019 by the Emloyee Benefit Trust's trustee that a dispute with HMRC is the only remaining obstacle to the distribution of the money, and that the current Roadchef management have been fully supportive of the process. Neil Gray raised the issue once again during Prime Minister's Questions in Parliament in January 2020, in response to which, the Prime Minister Boris Johnson stated that he would ask the Chancellor of the Exchequor to \"discuss the matter.\" \n\nOver the years Roadchef have acquired a portfolio of 21 sites. A large expansion occurred in 1998 when Roadchef agreed to purchase Blue Boar Group and Take A Break for £80 million and thus proceeded to integrate these acquisitions into an enlarged Roadchef Group. At the time, Blue Boar was the fourth largest operator of motorway services areas in the UK with three operational sites and one development site. The acquired Watford Gap site was the first motorway service area to be opened in the UK in 1959 and is one of the UK's best known sites. A few years ago (according to Google Finance), \"Roadchef Motorways was one of the largest Motorway Services Area (MSA) operators in the UK, with 21 sites representing 24% of the market and serving some 60 million visitors each year.\"\n\nRoadchef motorway service areas have varying facilities but despite this all sites provide two hours free parking, toilets and food 24 hours a day, seven days a week.\n\n"}

She was born in Globe, Arizona, United States.\n\nJacobs was born in Globe, Arizona, and was Jewish. Her parents, Roland and Eula Jacobs, moved the family to San Francisco in 1914.\n\nJacobs had a powerful serve and overhead smash and a sound backhand, but she never learned to hit a flat forehand, despite her friendship, and some coaching, from Bill Tilden. Like both her Wightman Cup coach Hazel Hotchkiss Wightman and her archrival Helen Wills Moody, she grew up in Berkeley, California, learned the game at the Berkeley Tennis Club, pursued her undergraduate degree at the University of California, Berkeley and was inducted into the Cal Sports Hall of Fame.\n\nJacobs won five Grand Slam singles titles and was an eleven-time Grand Slam singles runner-up. Six of those losses were to Helen Wills Moody. Jacobs's only victory over Moody was in the final of the 1933 U.S. Championships. Moody retired from the match with a back injury while trailing 3–0 in the third set to a chorus of boos from the audience who believed that Moody quit the match merely to deny Jacobs the satisfaction of finishing out her victory. It was reported by many witnesses after the match that Moody still planned to play her doubles match later that afternoon but was advised against it. Years later, Moody confirmed her injury, saying, \"My back is kind of funny. The vertebra between the fourth and fifth disk is thin. When the disk slips around, it's intolerable. It rained the whole week before that final match. I lay in bed, and that was bad because it stiffened worse. I just couldn't play any longer, but I didn't say anything because it would look like an excuse.\" Jacobs almost defeated Moody again when she had match point at 6–3, 3–6, 5–3 in the 1935 Wimbledon Championships singles final but a mishit on a short lob, which she decided to let bounce, cost her the point and four games later the match. In the 1938 Wimbledon final against Moody, Jacobs turned her ankle at 4–4 in the first set and hobbled around the court for the remainder of the match, with Moody winning the final eight games and the second set lasting a mere eight minutes. When asked after the match why she did not accept Hazel Wightman's on-court advice to quit the match after the injury, Jacobs said that continuing was the sporting thing to do so that Moody could enjoy the full taste of victory, an obvious allusion to Moody's retirement from the 1933 U.S. final. Moody said, \"I was very sorry about Helen's ankle. But it couldn't be helped, could it? I thought there was nothing I could do but get it over as quickly as possible.\" In total, Jacobs lost 14 of the 15 career singles matches she played against Moody.\n\nJacobs won three Grand Slam women's doubles titles and one in mixed doubles. She was the runner-up at six Grand Slam women's doubles tournaments and one Grand Slam mixed doubles tournament. She won the singles and women's doubles titles at the Italian Championships in 1934.\nAccording to A. Wallis Myers and John Olliff of \"The Daily Telegraph\" and the \"Daily Mail\", Jacobs was ranked in the world top 10 from 1928 through 1939 (no rankings issued from 1940 through 1945), reaching a career high of World No. 1 in those rankings in 1936. With the exceptions of 1930 and 1938, Jacobs was included in the year-end top 10 rankings by the United States Tennis Association from 1927 through 1941.

Her lifetime record was 19–11.\n\nIn 1933, Jacobs became the first woman to break with tradition by wearing man-tailored shorts at Wimbledon.\n\nWhile she was still playing tennis, Jacobs became a writer. Her first books were \"Modern Tennis\" (1933) and \"Improve Your Tennis\" (1936). She also wrote fictional works, such as \"Storm Against the Wind\" (1944). Her autobiography \"Beyond the Game\" appeared in 1936. In 1949, she published \"Gallery of Champions\", a collection of biographies of female players, which she dedicated to Molla Mallory.\n\nJacobs was named Associated Press Female Athlete of the Year in 1933. She was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 1962. In 2015, she was inducted into the National Gay and Lesbian Sports Hall of Fame.\n\nJacobs served as a commander in the U.S. Navy intelligence during World War II, one of only five women to achieve that rank in the Navy.\n\nLong known to have been lesbian, she was in a relationship from 1934 to 1943 with Henrietta Bingham, daughter of Louisville publisher and ambassador to England Robert Bingham.

A member of the Republican Party, she was elected in 2010 and reelected in 2014.\n\nBeginning a career in politics, Fallin was elected to the Oklahoma House of Representatives in 1990. She served two terms in the Oklahoma House, representing a district in Oklahoma City, from 1990 to 1995. In 1994, Fallin was elected to serve as the 14th Lieutenant Governor of Oklahoma; being elected to a total of three terms, she served under two different governors from 1995 to 2007. After seven-term Republican incumbent Ernest Istook announced that he would retire from his seat to run for governor, Fallin declared her candidacy for Oklahoma's 5th congressional district, where she was elected to two terms in the U.S. House of Representatives, serving from 2007 to 2011.\n\nFallin ran for Governor of Oklahoma in 2010. She defeated three other opponents with 54% of the vote in the Republican primary, and defeated the Democratic nominee, Lieutenant Governor Jari Askins, with 60% of the vote in the general election. She won reelection in 2014, defeating Oklahoma state representative Joe Dorman. Fallin's tenure as governor has been a contentious one, plagued by numerous controversies, charges of hypocrisy and accusations of overreach. An October 2018 poll by Morning Consult found Fallin with a 17% approval and 75% disapproval rating, making her the most unpopular governor in the country. Term limits barred Fallin from seeking a third term to the governorship that year; Kevin Stitt was elected to succeed her.\n\nFallin was born Mary Copeland in Warrensburg, Missouri, the daughter of Mary Jo (née Duggan) and Joseph Newton Copeland. Her mother and father each served terms as mayor of Tecumseh, Oklahoma, where she was raised. They were both members of the Oklahoma Democratic Party. She was a Democrat until she was 21. That year she switched to the Republican Party of Oklahoma and became active with the Young Republicans. She graduated from Tecumseh High School and attended Oklahoma Baptist University, in Shawnee. Fallin holds a bachelor of science degree in human and environmental sciences, and family relations and child development from Oklahoma State University (1977). At Oklahoma State she joined the Kappa Alpha Theta sorority.\nAfter college, Fallin worked for the Oklahoma Department of Tourism and Recreation, Oklahoma Employment Security Commission, and the Oklahoma Office of Personnel Management. In 1983, she went to the private sector as a hotel manager for Lexington Hotel and Suites, located at Richmond Square near Blackwelder and Northwest Expressway which was later demolished to make way for OnCue. She has also worked as marketing director for a Ski Lodge in Utah, and in Oklahoma was a commercial real estate broker.\n\nFallin ran for the 85th district of the Oklahoma House of Representatives after incumbent Mike Hunter announced his retirement in December 1989. She won the Republican primary in August and the general election in November. In 1992, she won re-election to a second term unopposed.\n\nShe represented Oklahoma City in the House, and authored 16 bills that became law. In 1992, Oklahoma became one of the first five states in the nation to enact anti-stalking legislation when Fallin authored and introduced HB 2291, which made it illegal to stalk or harass people. Fallin was active with the conservative American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), and was recognized by ALEC as Legislator of the Year in 1993. Also that year she was named Guardian of Small Business by the National Federation of Independent Business. According to \"The Almanac of American Politics\", she \"championed victims’ rights and health care reform.\"\n\nAfter two terms in the House, Fallin decided to run for Lieutenant Governor of Oklahoma. Ultimately she ran in three elections that year, all of which were against other women, and raised about $200,000. She faced two other candidates in the Republican primary. Terry Neese ranked first with 38% of the vote, but failed to reach the 50% threshold needed to win outright. Fallin ranked second with 36% of the vote, qualifying for the run-off election. She defeated Neese in the run-off primary election 53%–47%. She defeated Democrat Nance Diamond 50%–44%. She did well in the northwest region, the Oklahoma Panhandle, and her home Oklahoma County.\nShe won re-election to a second term in 1998, defeating Jack Morgan 68%–32%. She won all but nine counties, all of which were located in the far eastern part of the state. She won re-election to a third term in 2002, defeating Democratic State Representative Laura Boyd 57%–39%, dominating the eastern part of the state.\n\nIn 1995, Fallin became the first woman and first Republican to be sworn in as lieutenant governor of Oklahoma, an office she would hold for 12 years. As lieutenant governor, Fallin served on 10 boards and commissions. Early in her tenure, the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building, located in Oklahoma City, was bombed, killing 168 people in what became the worst case of domestic terrorism in United States history; Fallin led a task force to rebuild the childcare center that was lost in the attack. In 1997, she chaired the Fallin Commission on Workers’ Compensation, which released a comprehensive reform plan to lower costs in the state's workers' compensation system. Fallin promoted Project Homesafe, a national initiative of the National Shooting Sports Foundation, a firearms industry trade association, to distribute free cable gun locks to reduce the risk of accidental in-home shootings.\n\nIn her role as the president of the state senate, Fallin promoted legislation to adopt a right-to-work law prohibiting labor unions from requiring members to pay union dues as a condition of employment; Oklahoma ultimately passed a right-to-work law in 2001. With 12 years of service as Lieutenant Governor, Fallin was the state's third longest-serving Lieutenant Governor in Oklahoma history.\n\nIn 1998, Fallin served as chair of the National Lieutenant Governors Association. In 1999, she served as chair of the Republican Lieutenant Governors Association. Fallin also served as the national Chair of the Aerospace States Association.\n\n\nFallin decided not to seek re-election to a fourth term as lieutenant governor. Instead, she decided to run in Oklahoma's 5th congressional district, after incumbent Republican congressman Ernest Istook decided to run for governor of Oklahoma. Fallin also considered running for governor and challenging incumbent Democrat Brad Henry, but decided against it given Henry's popularity as measured in polls at the time. Istook lost to Henry by a landslide of 33 percentage points.\n\nThe July 25 Republican primary for the 5th district had six candidates. Fallin received 35% of the vote. Oklahoma City Mayor Mick Cornett finished second with 24% of the vote. The contest between her and Cornett was largely financial. They had few differences on the issues, but Fallin had a big cash advantage. On August 22, 2006, she defeated Cornett in the run-off primary election, 63%–37%.\n\nFallin won the general election on November 7, defeating Democrat Paul David Hunter 60%–40%.\n\n\nFallin easily won re-election in 2008, defeating Democrat Steve Perry 66%–34%.\n\nFallin became the first woman elected to Congress from Oklahoma since 1920, when Alice Mary Robertson became Oklahoma's first (and the nation's second) woman to be elected to Congress. Fallin resigned her position as Lieutenant Governor on January 2, 2007 in order to be sworn into Congress on January 4, 2007. Lieutenant Governor-elect Jari Askins was appointed by Oklahoma Governor Brad Henry to fill the remaining days of Fallin's term.\n\nThe 5th district included Oklahoma, Pottawatomie, and Seminole.\n\nIn June 2007, she passed her first bill: a revamping of federal grants for women's business centers. She joined a group of 38 Republicans who opposed an expansion of the State Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP).\n\nDuring the financial crisis of 2007–2008, Fallin voted for the 2008 Wall Street bailout. However, Fallin voted against the auto industry rescue plan of 2008.\n\n\nIn addition to her committee assignments, she served on the Executive Committee of the National Republican Congressional Committee, Small Business Chair on the Republican Policy Committee, and Vice Chairman of the Congressional Women's Caucus.\n\nIn September 2009, Fallin and four other candidates had announced their intentions to run for governor to succeed Brad Henry. Along with Fallin they were:\nFallin won the Republican nomination with 136,460 votes, ahead of her nearest challenger, State Senator Randy Brogdon, who received 98,159 votes. Former Alaska governor and 2008 vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin endorsed Fallin in the primary. On November 2, 2010, Fallin defeated Democratic nominee Jari Askins 60% to 39% to become the first female governor of Oklahoma.\n\nIn the election in which Fallin was elected governor, every statewide Republican official on the ballot was victorious, and for the first time in Oklahoma history, Republicans dominated all 11 statewide positions. Fallin began her transition by holding a joint press conference with outgoing governor Brad Henry.\n\nFallin named Devon Energy chairman and CEO Larry Nichols as the chairman of her transition team and outgoing Oklahoma Senate President pro tempore Glenn Coffee (R-Tulsa) as the Transition's Co-Chairman. She also established her Governor's Taskforce on Economic Development to advise her on matters related to the economy. Members of that task force include BancFirst CEO David Rainbolt and former Walters Administration Secretary of Agriculture Gary Sherrer. Former Keating Administration Secretary of Energy Robert J. Sullivan, Jr. serves as the director of the Taskforce as the Special Advisor to the Governor on Economic Development.\n\nFallin appointed Gary Sherrer as Oklahoma Secretary of the Environment, a position he previously held under Democratic governor David Walters; Tulsa city auditor Preston Doerflinger as Oklahoma Secretary of Finance and Revenue and director of the Oklahoma Office of State Finance; and state health commissioner Terry Cline as Oklahoma Secretary of Health and Human Services.\n\nFallin appointed Dave Lopez Oklahoma Secretary of Commerce and Tourism and director of the Oklahoma Department of Commerce in 2011. Lopez left Fallin's cabinet in 2013, but returned in 2017, when Fallin appointed him secretary of state.\n\nFallin named Lieutenant Governor Todd Lamb to her cabinet as Small Business Advocate. In February 2017, however, Lamb resigned from the Small Business Advocate post, saying that he could not support Fallin's proposal to impose the sales tax to 164 different services that are currently not taxed. Lamb said that proposal would harm small businesses and families in the state; Fallin responded by saying she was disappointed in the resignation and that her proposals were necessary to address the $900 million \"structural deficits of our budget.\"\n\nFallin's general counsel, Jennifer Chance, abruptly resigned in 2017, five months after becoming general counsel, amid a conflict-of-interest controversy. Chance had referred legal business involving Robert Bates, a reserve deputy convicted of manslaughter in the fatal shooting of Eric Harris in 2015, to her husband, a criminal defense attorney who was paid $25,000 to seek a governor's commutation of Bates's sentence. Fallin appointed former state senator James Williamson to replace Chance.\n\nA report by Morning Consult in mid-2018, toward the end of Fallin's second and final term, labeled her \"the most unpopular governor in the country\"; 19% of Oklahoma registered voters approved of her job performance, while 74% disapproved. The report attributed her loss in popularity, in large part, to a state-wide nine-day, teacher's strike in April 2018.\n\nUnder Fallin, Oklahoma has pushed for increased use of lethal injection as a mode of execution, while refusing to release details of the new chemical concoctions used in these executions following chemical company Hospira's decision to stop producing sodium thiopental, which had previously been widely used. Fallin pushed strongly for the execution of convicted murderer Clayton Lockett to proceed in spite of the lack of tested drugs to use for lethal injection. When the Oklahoma State Supreme Court granted a stay of execution, Fallin immediately overruled it, leading some political commentators to raise the possibility of a constitutional crisis surrounding the separation of powers. At the same time, a member of the Oklahoma legislature moved to impeach the seven justices on the Supreme Court who had granted the stay. Lockett's execution was attempted on April 29, 2014, but was abandoned when he could not be sedated and was left writhing in pain. Lockett died 43 minutes later of a heart attack. Fallin appointed a member of her staff to lead the investigation into the botched execution. Robert Patton, her director of corrections, resigned, and despite an Oklahoma conflict of interest law, was hired as a deputy warden by GEO Group whose contract he had overseen. Oklahoma State Prison warden Anita Trammel also resigned during the investigation.\n\nIn 2016, Fallin convened an Oklahoma Justice Reform Task Force to make various recommendations on criminal justice reform in Oklahoma, which has the second-highest incarceration rate among U.S. states. In 2017, Fallin praised a package of bills passed by the state House and state Senate; the bills, which passed unanimously or by broad margins, would among other things allow nonviolent offenders sentenced to life imprisonment to petition for a sentence modification after ten years in prison; expand diversion programs that steer convicted persons from prison to treatment and supervision; mandate \"the creation of individualized plans for inmates to help them better reintegrate into society\" after release from prison; and establish an oversight council to track the effectiveness of reform initiatives.\n\nIn 2017, however, Fallin struggled to push further major criminal justice reform bills through the legislature. This package of bills, supported by Fallin and recommended by the Task Force, would lower sentences for nonviolent drug crimes, allow more elderly prisoners to be paroled, and expand diversion programs. The bills were bottled up in the House Judiciary-Criminal Justice and Corrections Committee under its chairman, state Representative Scott Biggs, which prompted Fallin to criticized Biggs. In August 2017, Fallin was sued by inmates alleging unfair parole hearings and corruption from state lawmakers.\n\nFallin was a supporter of a controversial Ten Commandments monument that had been erected on the Oklahoma State Capitol grounds in 2012. In July 2015, the Oklahoma Supreme Court ruled, in a 7-2 vote, that the monument's presence on public land violated the Oklahoma Constitution, which prohibits the use of public property \"for the benefit of any religious purpose.\" Fallin initially refused to follow the court order, expressing the view that the ruling was incorrect and that the state would petition for a rehearing of the case.\n\nThe court's ruling was subsequently upheld, and in October 2015 the monument was quietly removed from Capitol grounds to a private property several blocks away. Fallin called for a state constitutional amendment to restore the monument to the Capitol grounds. The Legislature passed the resolution placing the question on the Oklahoma ballot, with voters to decide at the November 2016 election. The resolution was subsequently defeated.\n\nIn a televised interview in April 2016, Fallin's name was mentioned by former South Carolina Lieutenant Governor André Bauer as a potential running mate for Donald Trump, should he become the Republican presidential nominee in the 2016 presidential election. Trump himself described Bauer's suggestion as \"great advice\" in a tweet shortly afterwards. Fallin later endorsed Trump on May 4, 2016.\n\nIn May 2016, the Republican National Committee announced that Fallin would serve as co-chair to the 2016 Republican National Convention's Committee on Resolutions, known as the Platform Committee.\n\nOver the course of her tenure as governor, Fallin has sought to eliminate Oklahoma's state income tax while expanding sales taxes.\n\nCutting Oklahoma's personal income tax, the state's largest source of tax revenue, has been a \"top priority\" for Fallin and Republican legislators. In the 2012 legislative session, legislation advocated by Fallin and allies to cut the top income tax from 5.25% to 4.8% while eliminating 33 tax credits failed, in part because the legislation would increase the tax burden on around one-quarter of Oklahoma taxpayers, particularly middle-class taxpayers with two or more children.\n\nIn 2016, Fallin ultimately secured a reduction in the state income tax from 5.25 percent to 5 percent, which would result in an annually loss of $147 million in revenue to the state when fully implemented. In the aftermath of a steep drop in oil and gas prices that hurt state revenue, the state Senate passed legislation to roll the tax cut back, which Fallin opposed. The budget revenue caused by the drop in state revenue forced a cut of 16.5% to Oklahoma public schools for the last several months of the 2016 fiscal year on top of a previous 3% reduction, and compelled some schools in rural Oklahoma to go to a four-day school week.\n\nIn February 2016 at the opening of the Oklahoma Legislature's session, Fallin proposed $200 million in increased taxes to deal with an anticipated budget shortfall of at least $900 million for fiscal year 2017, which Fallin said was the largest budget hole in state history. Fallin proposed expanding state sales and use taxes to services and items delivered electronically such as music sold online, neither of which are currently taxed in Oklahoma. Fallin also proposed eliminating some annual sales-tax exemptions and more than doubling the state cigarette tax, from $1.03 to $2.53 per pack. Fallin proposed reducing appropriations to most state agencies by 6 percent, with smaller cuts of 3 percent to certain core agencies.\n\nThe budget legislation ultimately signed into law by Fallin in June 2016 eliminated the refundable portion of the state earned income tax credit as well as the double deduction income tax credit; the budget also reduced some tax credits. The partial repeal of the state's earned income tax credit was supported by legislative Republicans, who wanted additional revenue for the state to close a shortfall, and opposed by legislative Democrats and the Oklahoma Policy Institute, who argued that it was wrong to eliminate a tax credit that helped working poor Oklahomans. The budget cut most state services by 5%, with steeper cuts to higher education, which was cut 16%. (Corrections and healthcare funding remained steady.) In May 2016, Fallin also signed into law a measure requiring online retailers and consumers to collect sales taxes for goods purchased online.\n\nIn 2017, Fallin pushed to expand the state sales tax to 164 services that are not currently taxed, in order to raise hundreds of millions of dollars in state revenue. Fallin specifically proposed imposing sales tax on the top ten services by sales: residential utility services, as well as \"cable TV services; repair and maintenance services; legal services; real estate agent services; plumbing and heating services; electrical and wiring services; oil field services; business services; and accounting services.\" Fallin's proposed tax increase would increase monthly residential utility costs by 4.5%. In return for imposing sales tax on these items, Fallin proposed the elimination of the state sales tax on groceries, although local sales tax for groceries would remain.\n\nIn May 2017, Fallin vetoed a bill to permit more high-interest payday loans in Oklahoma. The bill had strong support in the Republican-controlled state legislature but was opposed by a broad coalition of political and religious groups who opposed the bill as enabling predatory lending. Fallin vetoed similar legislation four years earlier.\n\nDuring her term as governor, Fallin has signed 20 anti-abortion measures into law. In April 2015, Fallin signed into law a measure banning a common second-trimester abortion procedure, dilation and evacuation, except when necessary to save the life of the woman. In May 2015, Fallin signed into law a measure that tripled the mandatory waiting period in Oklahoma for an abortion, extending it to 72 hours. The measure also included other anti-abortion provisions.\n\nIn May 2016, Fallin vetoed a bill passed by the Oklahoma State Legislature that would have made it a felony, punishable by up to three years in prison, to perform an abortion, except in instances to save the life of the mother. In a statement, Fallin's office said: \"The bill is so ambiguous and so vague that doctors cannot be certain what medical circumstances would be considered 'necessary to preserve the life of the mother.'\"\n\nIn December 2016, Fallin signed into law a bill to require all Oklahoma Department of Health-regulated entities, including restaurants, public buildings, hospitals, and small businesses, to install anti-abortion signs in their public restrooms by January 2018. The bill appropriates no state funding for the signs, requiring businesses to pay the estimated cost (estimated to be $2.3 million).\n\nFallin was criticized for bias after ordering state-owned National Guard facilities to deny spousal benefits (including the provision of identification cards that would allow them to access such benefits) to all same-sex couples. Fallin took the position that such relationships were illegitimate under Oklahoma law. Fallin later backed down after U.S. Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel stated that Oklahoma would be in violation of federal law for refusing to recognize the relationships.\n\nIn 2018, Fallin signed legislation that would allow private adoption agencies to refuse to place children in homes if it \"would violate the agency’s written religious or moral convictions or policies.\" The legislation was opposed by LGBT rights groups, which said that the legislation would allow discrimination against LGBT couples seeking to adopt.\n\nIn 2014, Fallin vetoed a bill that would have required sheriffs and police chief to approve individuals' \"applications for tax stamps for items such as silencers, suppressors, short-barreled rifles and shotguns, and automatic weapons.\" The Republican-controlled legislature overrode the veto.\n\nIn 2015, Fallin vetoed legislation that would have restricted businesses' ability to prohibit guns in parks, fairgrounds and recreational areas.\n\nIn 2018, Fallin vetoed legislation to authorize adults to publicly carry guns without permit or training, prompting the NRA to criticize her.\n\nFallin is part of a group of Republican governors who have said that they will refuse to comply with Environmental Protection Agency regulations to reduce carbon emissions and combat climate change. In April 2015, Fallin issued an executive order prohibiting the Oklahoma Department of Environmental Quality and other state agencies from creating an emissions-reduction strategy under the Clean Power Plan, becoming the first governor to do so.\n\nIn a proclamation in September 2016, Fallin declared October 13, 2016 to be Oilfield Prayer Day, calling upon Christians to \"thank God for the blessing created by the oil and natural gas industry and to seek His wisdom and ask for protection.\" The proclamation attracted criticism because it was initially limited only to Christians. Following these objections, Fallin amended the proclamation to include people of \"all faiths.\"\n\nIn April 2014, Fallin signed into law S.B. 1023, which prohibits cities in Oklahoma from establishing citywide minimum wages or sick-leave requirements. The legislation targeted Oklahoma City, where a local initiative sought to establish a citywide minimum wage higher than the current federal minimum wage.\n\nIn May 2015, Fallin signed into law a measure prohibiting Oklahoma local governments from enacting local bans on oil and gas drilling. The bill was a response to a vote in Denton, Texas, to bar hydraulic fracturing (fracking), although no Oklahoma local government had attempted to ban fracking. The bill passed the state House 64-32 and the Senate 33-13; the bill was opposed by the Oklahoma Municipal League.\n\nIn late January 2011, following a heated Oklahoma State Board of Education meeting, Fallin proposed major changes to the Oklahoma State Department of Education's organization and structure. The controversy arose over the Board of Education rejecting three senior staff members of Oklahoma State Superintendent of Public Instruction Janet Barresi. Under Fallin's proposed changes, the Board would be stripped of its administrative powers and those powers would be transferred solely to the state superintendent, thus reducing the board to more of an advisory committee to the superintendent as opposed to a government body of the department.\n\nFallin was formerly a champion of the Common Core State Standards (which Oklahoma adopted in 2010), but in June 2014 signed a bill dropping the standards.\n\nIn April 2015, Fallin signed into law a measure that expanded charter schools statewide (a change from previous law, which allowed charter schools only in Tulsa and Oklahoma counties). The legislation required all expanding charter schools to receive approval from the local boards of education, and mandated that all charter schools be free and open like traditional public schools, thereby eliminating the prospect of charter schools picking and choosing students.\n\nIn an April 2018 interview, Fallin likened teachers who demanded raises to \"a teenage kid that wants a better car\" and claimed that antifa were involved in an Oklahoma teachers' strike. Fallin also criticized \"outside\" groups that protested with Oklahoma teachers at Oklahoma State Capitol, referring to the National Education Association and West Virginia teachers.\n\nDuring Fallin's term, the State of Oklahoma engaged in an extended legal battle with the Choctaw Nation and Chickasaw Nation over water rights in southeastern Oklahoma. In 2011, the tribes filed a federal lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma. In 2016, after years of negotiations and court proceedings, the state and the tribes—represented by Fallin, Choctaw Nation Chief Gary Batton, and Chickasaw Nation Governor Bill Anoatubby—came to a settlement agreement, with a compact (which needs congressional approval) to govern when and how water can be transferred out of Sardis Lake.\n\nIn May 2015, Fallin signed a bill for a $25 million bond proposal to complete the Native American Cultural Center and Museum, a project already underway. The legislation also returned ownership of the property and museum to Oklahoma City.\n\nIn March 2017, Fallin approved of the Shawnee Tribe's plan to build a $25 million casino close to Guymon in the Oklahoma Panhandle.\n\nIn the June 2018 primary election, Oklahoma voters approved State Question 788, a ballot measure that legalized the growth, possess, sale, and use of marijuana for medicinal purposes, and provided that physicians could broadly prescribe it for various conditions. During the campaign, Fallin opposed the measure, arguing that it would effectively legalize marijuana for recreational purposes, and indicated that if the measure passed, she would call a special session of the state legislature to set regulations on use.\n\nOn July 11, 2018, soon after the measure passed, Fallin signed stringent new emergency rules adopted by the Oklahoma Board of Health to prohibit the sale of marijuana in smokeable form and to require that a pharmacist be on-site at dispensaries during operating hours. These regulations angered marijuana activists, drawing bipartisan opposition in the state and fueling renewed calls for a special session of the legislature. After state Attorney General Michael J. Hunter determined that the adoption of the two rules exceeded the statutory authority of the Board of Health, Fallin urged the board to rescind the rules. Fallin criticized proponents of State Question 788 for their support of a ballot measure with a 30-day timeframe for implementation, but said that \"the state will carry out the responsibility of administering\" the new marijuana regime.\n\nAn executive order is a directive issued by the Governor that manages operations of the executive branch of the State government. Unless authorized by the Legislature, executive orders do not have the force of law but are binding upon the executive branch. All executive orders expire 90 days following the inauguration of the next Governor unless otherwise terminated or continued during that time by a subsequent executive order.\n\nFallin has been honored with numerous awards, including Women in Communications' Woman in the News Award, induction into the Oklahoma Women's Hall of Fame, Clarence E. Page Award, induction into the Oklahoma Aviation Hall of Fame, 1998 Woman of the Year in Government and 1993 Legislator of the Year.\n\nFallin married her first husband, Joseph Fallin, a dentist, in November 1984. She filed for divorce in December 1998. In November 2009, she married Wade Christensen, an Oklahoma City lawyer. They have a total of six children in their blended family, one of whom—model, makeup artist, and musician Christina Fallin—was described as \"the most interesting governor's daughter in the country\" by a 2014 \"Washington Post\" article.\n\nAugust 23, 1994, Lieutenant Governor of Oklahoma Republican primary results\n\nSeptember 20, 1994, Lieutenant Governor of Oklahoma Republican primary runoff results\n\nNovember 8, 1994, Lieutenant Governor of Oklahoma election results\n\nAugust 27, 2002, Lieutenant Governor of Oklahoma Republican primary results\n\nJune 24, 2014, Governor of Oklahoma Republican primary results\n\n\n"}

Founded in 1968, it aimed to be a student-centred learning environment where students become informed decision-makers. It was located on Greenbank Road, from which it received its name. It was paired with Knoxdale Public School, a primary school and was a principal feeder to Greenbank.\n\nAmid late 2016 attendance issues and consistent closure scandals, OCDSB announced in 2017 that it would follow the same path as Rideau High School and cease operations. On June 27, 2017, the final graduation was held on campus, officially closing the school on June 30, 2017. However, Knoxdale Public School remains open from Kindergarten to Grade 6 taking over Greenbank Middle School part of the building.\n\nAt its peak, Greenbank Middle School enrolled 350 Grade 7 and 8 students, represented over 20 countries and languages. Primarily served students from surrounding Greenbank, including Barrhaven, Centrepointe, Briargreen, Craig Henry and Bayshore.\n\nThe students attending GMS originate from a variety of cultural and religious backgrounds. There are also programs there catering to kids with little knowledge of English, disabilities and disorders.\n\nAs of 2013, Greenbank Middle School has a staff of 22 teachers. All staff members have earned additional educational qualifications through ongoing professional development including special education, ESL, master's degrees in various fields, visual arts and computers in education. Teachers are also involved in extracurricular activities.\n\nPrincipal Jennifer Offord was the subject of an Ottawa Citizen profile as a part of their series on her previous school, York Street Public School.\n\nThe GMS students teams are the Greenbank Gators.

Christina Organista-Martin's grade 7 French immersion science class decided that it wants to help prevent global warming and decided that it will make a project selling reusable bags and giving profits to the Institute of Environmental Sciences at Carleton University for research and education into reducing greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nGreenbank Middle School was notably involved in an event dubbed Kids Helping Kids, a 3 on 3 basketball fundraiser. Several years after the event was established, the fundraiser influenced other schools. Easing thousands of dollars - oriented programs in neighboring OCDSB \"Beacon Schools\" that would salvage enough profit to save other schools from bankruptcy and help the other facilities in financial aid. The program continues to operate in other schools, even after the closure of Greenbank Middle School.\n\n\nOn March 2, 2017. Ottawa-Carleton District School Board announced the closure of six Middle Schools across Ottawa. Immediately after Greenbank Middle School was listed among them, a small number of parents came forward to protest this announcement. A key reason for the closure was as a result of the lack of students and graduates, particularly students switching schools or parents withdrawing from the OCSD. On September 2017, it was announced that the remaining students of Greebank Middle School were to be relocated to Sir Robert Borden High School, D. Roy Kennedy Public School and Bell High School (Ottawa). On June 27, 2017, the final graduation occurred at Greenbank Middle School.\n\n"}

(GCI or GCII) is a Sunbury, Pennsylvania-based roller coaster manufacturer which has created several award-winning rides since its formation in 1994. Starting in 2006 with Thunderbird at PowerPark in Finland, the company expanded beyond the United States and began building coasters in Europe and Asia. Günter Engelhardt GmbH handles the company's marketing rights in Europe. In addition to designing and building new roller coasters, GCI also refurbishes and re-tracks existing roller coasters, regardless of manufacturer.\n\nGCI designed roller coasters are known for their often curved drops, twisted layouts, and perception of high speed. Exciting elements such as the station fly-by and station fly-through have been incorporated in many of their layouts.\n\nMany GCI designed roller coasters also contain an on-ride camera midway through or towards the end of the ride.\n\nGCI was founded in 1994 by Mike Boodley and Clair Hain, Jr. Boodley was a coaster designer previously with Custom Coasters International and Hain had gained a reputation throughout the industry as a master coaster builder. In 1996, the firm opened Wildcat at Hershey Park which contained many of the signature elements the firm would soon become known for: tight sweeping curves, reminiscent of designs from the turn of the century by such noted coaster designers as Fred Church and Harry Traver. In 2005, Boodley retired and assigned Jeff Pike with the responsibility as lead designer for the firm. The first coaster that Pike is credited with is the Kentucky Rumbler at Beech Bend Park near Bowling Green, Kentucky. Though GCI is capable of re-tracking roller coasters, they haven't re-tracked many. One of their most notable re-tracking was in 2016, for the GhostRider at Knott's Berry Farm. The roller coaster was in need of a refurb (due to its aging and roughness). Originally planned to be retracked by Rocky Mountain Construction, Cedar Fair ultimately decided to work with GCI instead. In November 2019 at an after party during the IAAPA convention, the company revealed a steel track prototype .\n\nMost GCI-designed roller coasters run with in-house–designed articulated Millennium Flyer trains. The only exception is Roar at Six Flags America, which runs with Philadelphia Toboggan Coasters–designed trains. Gwazi at Busch Gardens Tampa Bay and GCI's first roller coaster, Wildcat at Hersheypark, also operated with PTC trains when they first opened, but both coasters were later modified to run with the Millennium Flyer trains. In 2017, Wildcat at Lake Compounce also received Millennium Flyer trains even though the coaster was made by Philadelphia Toboggan Coasters or PTC.\n\nThese trains are known for their cushioned seats, allowing riders to be comfortable during rides. These trains also contain individual lap bars which automatically lower and lock into a position to accommodate the rider, allowing quicker dispatch times. With their easily identified open, gate-like fronts, usually customized with the logo for the respective ride on which they are running, Millennium Flyer trains are styled similarly to trains seen during the golden age of rollercoasters.\n\nAs of 2019, Great Coasters International has built 29 roller coasters around the world.\n\n"}

() or Panellinios Basket, is a professional basketball club that is located in Athens, Greece. The club was founded in 1929, making it one of the oldest basketball clubs in Europe.\n\nThe name Panellinios can be translated as Pan-Hellenic in English, and can be interpreted to mean \"The Greek Nation\". B.C. stands for basketball club. So the club's name can be interpreted to mean \"The National Basketball Club\". The Greek multi-sports club Panathinaikos A.O. was founded by Panellinios G.S. athletes. The club was previously owned by the Greek businessman Minos Kyriakou.\n\nThe parent athletic club, Panellinios Gymnastikos Syllogos, was founded in Athens in 1891, making it one of the oldest sports clubs in Europe. It had a team of gymnasts compete at the 1896 Summer Olympics in Athens. The team's leader was Sotirios Athanasopoulos. Members included Nikolaos Andriakopoulos, Petros Persakis, Thomas Xenakis, and 29 others. The team placed second out of the three teams in the parallel bars team event, earning a silver medal (retroactively awarded by the International Olympic Committee, as the awards at the first Olympic Games differed from the gold, silver, bronze format used later).\n\nThe Greek multi-sport club Panathinaikos was founded by Giorgos Kalafatis in 1908, when he and 40 other athletes decided to break away from Panellinios Gymnastikos Syllogos, following the club's decision to discontinue its football team. In 1929, the athletic association's basketball department, Panellinios B.C. Athens was founded, and that same year the club won the Athens basketball championship.\n\nPanellinios has been the top-tier Greek League's champion 6 times, in the years 1929, 1939, 1940, 1953, 1955, and 1957. The club would have likely won several more Greek championships during the 1940s, but could not because the league was temporarily disbanded because of World War II. In the early 1950s era, the team was called \"The Golden Five\" (Chrysi Pentada in Greek), or \"The Fabulous Five\" (Panagiotis Manias, Themis Cholevas, Kostas Papadimas, Mimis Stefanidis, and Aristeidis Roubanis) and dominated not only Greek basketball, but European basketball in general. The Panellinios team headlined the Greek 1952 Olympics team. Although the EuroLeague, then known as the FIBA European Champions Cup, was not formed until the 1958 season, it is widely believed that had it been formed earlier, that Panellinios would have won several EuroLeague championships, as many considered Panellinios the best team in Europe during the early-to-mid 1950s.\n\nDuring that era, Panellinios took part in the biggest international club tournaments in Europe, the predecessor tournaments of the EuroLeague, that were then held instead of the EuroLeague tournament. The club advanced to the final of the 1954 San Remo Tournament, which they lost 81–74 to the Italian League club Olimpia Milano. Panellinios then won the 1955 Brussels Tournament, by defeating the Yugoslav League club Red Star Belgrade in the final, by a score of 91–67. Panellinios also won the 1956 San Remo Tournament, by defeating the Italian League club Virtus Bologna, by a score of 67–37.\n\nIn the inaugural 1958 season, the European 1st-tier level European Champions Cup (now known as the EuroLeague) was formed. By that time, the team of head coach Nikos Nissiotis was coming to the end of The Golden Five era, as only 2 players of The Golden Five remained on the team. The club was eliminated from the competition, after losing its series against Steaua SA Bucarest 2 games to 0, by scores of 63–60 and 75–72. The team was led in those years by the great scorer Antonis Christeas.\n\nThe team stayed in the top Greek basketball division for 23 straight years, starting in 1963, when the league was re-formed into a new format. The club finished third in the top Greek League in both 1970 and 1978. During this era, it was the legendary Greek player Vassilis Goumas, that was the leader of the team. In the 1970–71 season, Panellinios player Paraschos Tsantalis scored 73 points in a Greek Basket league game against Panionios.\n\nThe club also finished as the runner-up in the Greek Cup in 1987. Panellinios also participated in the European 2nd-tier level FIBA European Cup Winners' Cup and European 3rd-tier level FIBA Korać Cup competitions several times during the 1970s and 1980s.\n\nThe club struggled in the 1990s, and was mired in the second and third national divisions of the Greek lower leagues. New management came to the organization in 1999, when Minos Kyriakou took over the club, and the club would eventually again begin to establish itself as a strong presence in Greek basketball. In 2004, Panellinios returned to the top Greek League, after earning promotion, led by Marijan Kraljević and the Soulis brothers.\n\nIn 2006, the team advanced to the playoff round of the Greek League, led by Dimitrios Tsaldaris, Damir Mulaomerović and Ruben Boumtje-Boumtje, finishing 6th in the league, after losing in the playoffs to Aris. In 2007, the club finished in 5th place in the league with players such as Mamadou N'Diaye, Michalis Pelekanos, Gary Trent, and Anthony Goldwire. The team lost to Panionios in the playoffs, but in finishing 5th in the Greek League, qualified for the new European 2nd-tier level EuroCup competition for the first time in club history.\n\nIn 2010, the club moved from Athens, where it had been based for 81 years, to the city of Lamia. In March 2010, Minos Kyriakou, withdrew from the club's ownership position. In 2011, the club moved bask to Athens.\n\nIn the 2011–12 season, the Greek Professional Sports Committee stripped Panellinios of its professional licence, because the club faced economic problems. In addition, the club wasn't accepted by the lower tiers of the Greek basketball league system, and thus didn't play in any league during that season. The next season, (2012–13), Panellinios played in the A ESKA Category (the First Athenian Regional Division). But the team's presence in the league wasn't successful. It finished in last place, and was relegated to the B ESKA Category.\n\nThe club plays its Greek League home games at Panellinios Indoor Hall, a small arena with a capacity of 1,800. and played its EuroCup home games at either the 4,000 capacity Indoor Hall Peristeriou, or at the Hellinikon Olympic Arena, which has a capacity of 15,000.\n\nWhen the club moved to Lamia, its domestic Greek League and EuroCup home games were hosted at the Lamia Arena, which has a seating capacity of 5,000.\n\n\n\n"}

The Dharma Realm Buddhist Association (DRBA) is a Buddhist organization with chapters in North America, Australia and Asia. The City of Ten Thousand Buddhas (CTTB) in Ukiah, California, is one of the first Chan Buddhist monasteries in America. Venerable Master Hsuan Hua founded Dharma Realm Buddhist University at CTTB. The Buddhist Text Translation Society works on the phonetics and translation of Buddhist scriptures from Chinese into English, Vietnamese, Spanish, and many other languages.\n\nHsuan Hua, a native of Shuangcheng County of Jilin (now Wuchang District, Harbin, Heilongjiang), was born Bai Yushu () on April 16, 1918. His parents were devout Buddhists. At an early age, Hua became a vegetarian like his mother, and decided to become a Buddhist monk.\n\nAt the age of 15, he took refuge in the Three Jewels under the Venerable Chang Zhi. That same year he began to attend school and studied texts of various Chinese schools of thought, and the fields of medicine, astrology, and physiology. At 19 years of age, Hua became a monastic, under the Dharma name An Tzu. ()\n\nIn 1959, Hsuan Hua sought to bring Chinese Buddhism to the West. He instructed his disciples in America to establish a Buddhist association, initially known as The Buddhist Lecture Hall, which was renamed the Sino-American Buddhist Association before taking its present name: the Dharma Realm Buddhist Association.\n\nHsuan Hua traveled to Australia in 1961 and taught there for one year, returning to Hong Kong in 1962. That same year, at the invitation of American Buddhists, he traveled to the United States; his intent was to \"come to America to create Patriarchs, to create Buddhas, to create Bodhisattvas\".\n\nHsuan Hua resided in San Francisco, where he built a lecture hall. Hsuan Hua began to attract young Americans who were interested in meditation. He conducted daily meditation sessions and frequent Sutra lectures.\n\nAt that time, the Cuban Missile Crisis occurred between the United States and the Soviet Union, and Hsuan Hua embarked on a fasting period for thirty-five days to pray for an end to the hostilities and for world peace. In 1967, Hsuan Hua moved the Buddhist Lecture Hall back to Chinatown, locating it in the Tianhou Temple.\n\nIn 1968, Hsuan Hua held a Shurangama Study and Practice Summer Session. Over thirty students from the University of Washington in Seattle came to study the Buddha’s teachings. After the session was concluded, five young Americans (Bhikṣu Heng Chyan, Heng Jing, and Heng Shou, and Bhikṣuṇīs Heng Yin and Heng Ch'ih) requested permission to take full ordination.\n\nVenerable Hsuan Hua lectured on the entire \"\" in 1968 while he was in the United States. These lectures were recorded in an eight-part series of books containing the sutra and a traditionally rigorous form of commentary that addresses each passage. It was again lectured by the original translator monks and nuns of the City of Ten Thousand Buddhas at Dharma Realm Buddhist University in the summer of 2003.\n\nWith the founding of his American Sangha, Hsuan Hua embarked on his personal vision for Buddhism in the United States:\n\nBecause of the increasing numbers of people who wished to become monks and nuns under Hsuan Hua's guidance, in 1972 he decided to hold ordination ceremonies at Gold Mountain Dhyana Monastery. Two monks and one nun received ordination. Subsequent ordination platforms have been held at the City of Ten Thousand Buddhas in 1976, 1979, 1982, 1989, 1991, and 1992, and progressively larger numbers of people have received full ordination. Over two hundred people from countries all over the world were ordained under him.\n\nHaving traveled to Thailand and Burma in his youth to investigate the Southern Tradition of Buddhism, Hsuan Hua wanted to bridge what he perceived as a rift between the Northern (Mahayana) and Southern (Theravada) traditions. In an address to Ajahn Sumedho and the monastic community at Amaravati Buddhist Monastery on October 6, 1990, Hsuan Hua stated:\n\nOn the occasion of the opening ceremony for the Dharma Realm Buddhist University, Hsuan Hua presented Venerable K. Sri Dhammananda of the Theravada tradition with an honorary Ph.D. He also donated a major piece of the land that would become Abhayagiri Buddhist Monastery, a Theravada Buddhist monastery in the Thai Forest tradition of Ajahn Chah, located in Redwood Valley, California.\n\nHsuan Hua would also invite Bhikkhus from both traditions to jointly conduct the High Ordination.\n\nFrom July 18 to the 24th of 1987, Hsuan Hua hosted the \"Water, Land, and Air Repentance Dharma Assembly\", a centuries-old ritual often seen as the \"king of dharma services\" in Chinese Buddhism, at the City of Ten Thousand Buddhas and invited over seventy Buddhists from mainland China to attend. This was the first time the service was known to have been held in North America.\n\nOn November 6, 1990, Hsuan Hua sent his disciples to Beijing to bring the Dragon Treasury () edition of the Chinese Buddhist canon back to CTTB, furthering his goal of bringing Buddhism to the US.\n\nOn June 7, 1995, Hsuan Hua died in Los Angeles at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. His sudden passing came as a shock to most of his disciples.\n\nHsuan Hua's funeral lasted from June 8 to July 29. On June 17, Hsuan Hua's body was taken from southern to northern California, returning to the City of Ten Thousand Buddhas. All major services during the funeral were presided over by Venerable Ming Yang, abbot of Longhua Temple in Shanghai and a longtime friend of Hsuan Hua's.\n\nOn July 28, monks from both Theravada and Mahayana traditions hosted a memorial ceremony and cremation. More than two thousand followers from the United States, Canada, and various Asian and European countries, came to CTTB to take part in the funeral service. Letters of condolences from Buddhist monks and dignitaries, including from President Bush, were read during the memorial service.\n\nA day after the cremation, July 29, Hsuan Hua's ashes were scattered in the air above the City of Ten Thousand Buddhas by two disciples, Heng Sure and Heng Chau, one of Master Hua's first disciples, from a hot air balloon.\n\nAfter the funeral, memorial services commemorating Hsuan Hua's life were held in various parts of the world, including Taiwan, China, and Canada. His śarīra (relics) were distributed to many of his temples, disciples and followers.\n\n\n"}

In his youth he developed a passion for botany, but at his father's wish he studied law from 1718 to 1721.\n\nAfter inheriting his father's large estate, he expanded it into a model farm, where he developed and tested new methods of horticulture, agriculture and forestry. The results of this work, he published in numerous publications. Commission by the French Academy of Sciences in 1728 Duhamel investigate the saffron cultivation in Gâtinais. In the following years continued to investigate physiological problems of crops. He also investigated growth of the trees in cooperation with Georges-Louis Leclerc de Buffon. From 1740 he also started focusing on meteorological problems, in particular their impact on agricultural production.\n\nIn 1738 he was elected to the French Academy of Sciences, and served three times as its president. He was appointed Inspector-General of the Marine in 1739, and made scientific studies of shipbuilding, the conservation of wood, the paramedical and fair of sailors, etc. In 1741 he co-founded a school of Marine science, which in 1765 became the Ecole des Ingénieurs-Constructeurs, the forerunner of the modern Ecole du Génie Maritime. He was also involved in the foundation of the \"\"Académie de marine de Brest\"\", on 31 July 1752.\n\nFollowing the work of Réaumur, in 1757 he released the \"Description des Arts et Métiers\" and opposed the writers of the \"Encyclopédie\". His fondness for concrete problems, experimentation and popularization made him one of the forerunners of modern agronomy and silviculture.\n\nIn 1767, du Monceau was elected a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. He died in Paris on 13 August 1782.\n\nHaving been requested by the French Academy of Sciences to investigate a disease which was destroying the saffron plant in Gâtinais, he discovered the cause in a parasitical fungus which attached itself to the roots. This achievement gained him admission to the French Academy of Sciences in 1738. From then on until his death he busied himself chiefly with making experiments in plant physiology.\n\nHaving learned from Sir Hans Sloane that madder possesses the property of giving colour to the bones, he fed animals successively on food mixed and unmixed with madder; and he found that their bones in general exhibited concentric strata of red and white, while the softer parts showed in the meantime signs of having been progressively extended.\n\nFrom a number of experiments he was led to believe himself able to explain the growth of bones, and to demonstrate a parallel between the manner of their growth and that of trees. Along with the naturalist Buffon, he made numerous experiments on the growth and strength of wood, and experimented also on the growth of the mistletoe, on layer planting, on smut in corn, and others. He was probably the first, in 1736, to distinguish clearly between the alkalis, potash and soda.\n\nFrom the year 1740 on he made meteorological observations, and kept records of the influence of the weather on agricultural production. For many years he was inspector-general of the marine, and applied his scientific experience to the improvement of naval construction.\n\nIn his additions to \"lArt de lÉpinglier\" (The Art of the Pin-Maker, 1761), Henri Louis Duhamel du Monceau wrote about the \"division of labour\":\n\nThis text is believed to have inspired Adam Smith for his famous work \"An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations\" published in 1776.\n\nFollowing the work of René Antoine Ferchault de Réaumur, in 1757 Duhamel released the \"Descriptions des Arts et Métiers\" and opposed the writers of the Encyclopédie. The Encyclopédistes didn't take this for granted, Criticised him on occasion. For example, Denis Diderot (1767) recalled:\n\nDiderot seems to forget his debt to Duhamel du Monceau for the Encyclopédie, including the articles \"Agriculture,\" \"Rope,\" \"Pipe\" and \"Sugar.\"\n\nThe succession of Grandjean Fouchy, perpetual secretary of the Academy of Sciences, clash sees supporters of Condorcet, led by d'Alembert, and those of the astronomer Bailly, led by Count de Buffon. In 1773, the appointment of Condorcet as deputy Grandjean Fouchy sees the triumph of the party of the philosophers against the use of naval officers linked to Duhamel.\n\nBut in January 1775, supporters of Bailly, including Patrick D'Arcy and Jean-Charles de Borda, both naval officers make up a commission to monitor the work of the Secretary, that Condorcet considered censorship. To be elected, he must give up the pension ECU 1000 and submit an application in proper form to respect the rules of Académie2.

The two were members of New York supergroup Boot Camp Clik, along with Buckshot, Smif-N-Wessun and O.G.C..\n\nHeltah Skeltah debuted on Smif-N-Wessun's album \"Dah Shinin'\" in 1995, appearing on the tracks \"Wontime\", \"Cession at da Doghillee\" and \"Let's Git It On\". Later in 1995, they grouped up with fellow Boot Camp members O.G.C. to form The Fab 5 (another nod to The Beatles), and released a surprise hit single, \"Leflaur Leflah Eshkoshka\". Out of The Fab 5 members, Rock and Sean Price received the most attention, due to their notable charisma and chemistry. The duo released their anticipated debut \"Nocturnal\" in June 1996, which included \"Leflah\", as well as the singles \"Operation Lock Down\" and \"Therapy\". The album sold over 250,000 copies in the United States, and has become a classic in the underground Hip Hop scene because of its grimy, basement sound and strong lyrics. The duo released a group album with the Boot Camp in 1997, then followed in 1998 with their second effort \"Magnum Force\". The album's lead single, \"I Ain't Havin' That\" (sampled from the A Tribe Called Quest track \"Hot Sex\", with the chorus sampling Redman's 1996 hit \"Pick it Up\"), became a Hot 100 hit. Despite the single's success, the album was criticized due to its lighter content. Price and Rock seemed disillusioned with their lack of sales, and split up soon after the \"Magnum Force\" album. Rock began having problems with Duck Down Records, and split with the label, signing to DJ Lethal's Lethal Records. He planned to release an album titled \"Planet Rock\", but the label folded and the album disappeared. Sean Price remained with the Camp for their second album \"The Chosen Few\" in 2002. Heltah Skeltah reunited in 2005, making appearances on Sean Price's solo album \"Monkey Barz\" and Smif-N-Wessun's \"\". The duo continued work with the Boot Camp for their third group effort \"The Last Stand\", released in July 2006. In 2007, Heltah Skeltah had a track included on the \"Official Joints\" mixtape, a collection of previously unreleased songs by NYC rappers. Heltah Skeltah dropped their third album together titled \"D.I.R.T. (Da Incredible Rap Team)\" which was released on September 30, 2008.Sean Price died in his sleep on August 8, 2015.

He stated why he became a documentary filmmaker: \"I used to have a fantasy everyone would see my films and be changed for the better. That's why you want to make films.\"\n\nWith documentary filmmakers Don Haig and Beryl Fox, King was a partner in Film Arts, a Toronto-based postproduction company that worked on their film projects and the television series \"This Hour Has Seven Days\", \"The National Dream\" and \"W5\".\n\nIn 2002, he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada. A collection of ten of King's films was released as a collection representing various stages of his life. King's work was also the focus of a retrospective at the 2002 Toronto International Film Festival. In 2007 New York City's Museum of Modern Art hosted a retrospective of his work. In 2009, there were similar tributes to King's work at Vancouver's Pacific Cinematheque and the Vancouver International Film Centre \n\nKing married three times: first to Phyllis April King in 1952, then to screenwriter Patricia Watson in 1970, and finally to screenwriter Colleen Murphy in 1987. He collaborated with both Watson and Murphy on film projects. He wrote \"Who Has Seen the Wind\" with Watson in 1976 and directed Murphy's screenplay for \"Termini Station\" in 1989.\n\nFor his films, King used the documentary technique cinema-verite. He ran Allan King Films Limited in Toronto. King described his style as \"actuality drama – filming the drama of everyday life as it happens, spontaneously without direction, interviews or narrative.\" He said that he wanted to \"serve the action as unobtrusively as possible\" by becoming very familiar with both the environment and the people he filmed by paying particular attention to movement patterns, routines, and light quality.\n\n\"Warrendale\" was a film about emotionally-disturbed children who lived in a Toronto institution with the same name. Warrendale used an experimental \"holding\" technique of safely restraining children who lost control because of fear, rage, or grief. The therapy was designed to push children to verbalize their emotions so that they would learn to identify and deal with their emotions, and it was also supposed to replace drugs or other techniques. The film was not an exposé of holding and neither chastised nor applauded the school's approach, but it was instead an absorbing, empathetic glimpse of children in distress.\n\nUnlike Frederick Wiseman, who spent only a short time exploring an institution before he began filming, King spent much time with subjects beforehand so that he would develop trust with his subjects. King spent four weeks at Warrendale with 12 children and another two weeks there with his camera crew before filming began.\n\nThe crew had complete access to all aspects of the home/school situation at Warrendale, including one meeting in which the top school administrator gently admonished a counselor for using holding at an inappropriate time. King lit the entire home and replaced dark paneling in a hallway with lighter paneling to improve the lights. Filming lasted eight weeks. He said that getting to know people before filming and staying with situations for a significant amount of time were essential \"because in order for anything significant to occur in action or drama the subjects must make a huge leap of faith in the filmmaker.\"\n\nThe film's pivotal moment was the counselors breaking the news to the children that their cook, Dorothy, had died suddenly. (Although the death had happened early during the filming, King made it the film's climax.) The children with emotional illnesses often believed that their thoughts and feelings caused trauma and tragedy. Filming was intimate during both the tensest and the most tender moments, with the camera sometimes inches from pained faces as the children screamed and cried, all while they were being restrained by counselors.\n\nUpon seeing \"Warrendale\", director Jean Renoir wrote, \"Allan King is a great artist. His remarkable work exposes one of the most suspenseful action I have ever seen on a screen.\"\n\nThe Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, which commissioned the film, refused to show it because the children often swore and uttered such words as \"fuck\" and \"bullshit,\" which were not then permitted on Canadian television. Instead, it allowed King to show the film in cinemas. Shown in the Parallel Section at the Cannes Film Festival in 1967, the film won the \"Prix d'art et d'essai\" and also shared BAFTA's Best Foreign Film Award with Michaelangelo Antonioni's \"Blowup\" and the New York Critics' Circle Award (1968) with Luis Buñuel's \"Belle de Jour\".\n\nDespite censorship, King continued to push cultural taboos. In 1969, he directed \"A Married Couple\", which explored a crisis in a real marriage and the issue of choice. \"The New York Times\" ' critic Clive Barnes described \"A Married Couple\" as \"quite simply one of the best films I have ever seen.\" The film was issued by the Criterion Collection.\n\nDuring more than 50 years of filmmaking, King worked in every film genre except animation, creating an enormous and diverse portfolio. To support his documentaries, King also directed episodic television and feature films. His first dramatic feature film, \"Who Has Seen the Wind\" (1976), based on the novel by W. O. Mitchell, won the Grand Prix at the Paris International Film Festival and the Golden Reel Award for the highest-grossing Canadian film of the year. Many television dramas that he directed won top awards.\n\nIn 2003, he produced the documentary, \"Dying at Grace\", a docudrama about five people in their final days at the Palliative Care Unit of the Salvation Army Toronto Grace Health Centre as they came to terms with their deaths. It won awards at film festivals in Toronto and Berlin.\n\nKing died from brain cancer on June 15, 2009, at 79, in his home in Toronto.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

However, this marketing campaign was dropped in an attempt to further separate CompUSA from the Good Guys name, and assist in launching its new Home Entertainment sections in select locations. The Good Guys name once again no longer existed in 2008 when CompUSA closed its remaining stores. Extended warranties on televisions purchased through The Good Guys or CompUSA can still be accessed through General Electric Extended Warranties.\n\nIn 1991, one of the stores in the chain located in Sacramento was taken over by four armed robbers.

{"id": "2144959", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2144959", "title": "Chitwan National Park", "text": "Chitwan National Park\n\nChitwan National Park () is the first national park in Nepal. It was established in 1973 and granted the status of a World Heritage Site in 1984. It covers an area of and is located in the subtropical Inner Terai lowlands of south-central Nepal in the districts of Nawalpur, Parsa, Chitwan and Makwanpur. In altitude it ranges from about in the river valleys to in the Churia Hills.\n\nIn the north and west of the protected area the Narayani-Rapti river system forms a natural boundary to human settlements. Adjacent to the east of Chitwan National Park is Parsa National Park, contiguous in the south is the Indian Tiger Reserve Valmiki National Park. The coherent protected area of represents the \"Tiger Conservation Unit (TCU) Chitwan-Parsa-Valmiki\", which covers a huge block of alluvial grasslands and subtropical moist deciduous forests.\n\nSince the end of the 19th century Chitwan – \"Heart of the Jungle\" – used to be a favorite hunting ground for Nepal's ruling class during the cool winter seasons. Until the 1950s, the journey from Kathmandu to Nepal's south was arduous as the area could only be reached by foot and took several weeks. Comfortable camps were set up for the feudal big game hunters and their entourage, where they stayed for a couple of months shooting hundreds of tigers, rhinoceroses, leopards and sloth bears.\n\nIn 1950, Chitwan's forest and grasslands extended over more than and was home to about 800 rhinos. When poor farmers from the mid-hills moved to the Chitwan Valley in search of arable land, the area was subsequently opened for settlement, and poaching of wildlife became rampant. In 1957, the country's first conservation law inured to the protection of rhinos and their habitat. In 1959, Edward Pritchard Gee undertook a survey of the area, recommended creation of a protected area north of the Rapti River and of a wildlife sanctuary south of the river for a trial period of ten years. After his subsequent survey of Chitwan in 1963, this time for both the Fauna Preservation Society and the International Union for Conservation of Nature, he recommended extension of the sanctuary to the south.\n\nBy the end of the 1960s, 70% of Chitwan's jungles had been cleared, malaria eradicated using DDT, thousands of people had settled there, and only 95 rhinos remained. The dramatic decline of the rhino population and the extent of poaching prompted the government to institute the \"Gaida Gasti\" – a rhino reconnaissance patrol of 130 armed men and a network of guard posts all over Chitwan. To prevent the extinction of rhinos the Chitwan National Park was gazetted in December 1970, with borders delineated the following year and established in 1973, initially encompassing an area of .\n\nWhen the first protected areas were established in Chitwan, Tharu communities were forced to relocate from their traditional lands. They were denied any right to own land and thus forced into a situation of landlessness and poverty. When the Chitwan National Park was designated, Nepalese soldiers destroyed the villages located inside the boundary of the park, burned down houses, and beat the people who tried to plough their fields. Some threatened Tharu people at gun point to leave.\n\nIn 1977, the park was enlarged to its present area of . In 1997, a bufferzone of was added to the north and west of the Narayani-Rapti river system, and between the south-eastern boundary of the park and the international border to India.\n\nThe park's headquarters is in Kasara. Close by the gharial and turtle conservation breeding centres have been established. In 2008, a vulture breeding centre was inaugurated aiming at holding up to 25 pairs of each of the two \"Gyps\" vultures species now critically endangered in Nepal - the Oriental white-backed vulture and the slender-billed vulture.\n\nChitwan has a tropical monsoon climate with high humidity all through the year. The area is located in the central climatic zone of the Himalayas, where monsoon starts in mid June and eases off in late September. During these 14–15 weeks most of the 2,500 mm yearly precipitation falls – it is pouring with rain. After mid-October the monsoon clouds have retreated, humidity drops off, and the top daily temperature gradually subsides from ±36 °C / 96.8 °F to ±18 °C / 64.5 °F. Nights cool down to 5 °C / 41.0 °F until late December, when it usually rains softly for a few days. Then temperatures start rising gradually.\n\nThe typical vegetation of the Inner Terai is Himalayan subtropical broadleaf forests with predominantly sal trees covering about 70% of the national park area. The purest stands of sal occur on well drained lowland ground in the centre. Along the southern face of the Churia Hills sal is interspersed with chir pine (\"Pinus roxburghii\"). On northern slopes sal associates with smaller flowering tree and shrub species such as beleric (\"Terminalia bellirica\"), rosewood (\"Dalbergia sissoo\"), axlewood (\"Anogeissus latifolia\"), elephant apple (\"Dillenia indica\"), grey downy balsam (\"Garuga pinnata\") and creepers such as \"Bauhinia vahlii\" and \"Spatholobus parviflorus\".\n\nSeasonal bushfires, flooding and erosion evoke an ever-changing mosaic of riverine forest and grasslands along the river banks. On recently deposited alluvium and in lowland areas groups of catechu (\"Acacia catechu\") with rosewood (\"Dalbergia sissoo\") predominate, followed by groups of kapok (\"Bombax ceiba\") with rhino apple trees (\"Trewia nudiflora\"), the fruits of which rhinos savour so much. Understorey shrubs of velvety beautyberry (\"Callicarpa macrophylla\"), hill glory bower (\"Clerodendrum\" sp.) and gooseberry (\"Phyllanthus emblica\") offer shelter and lair to a wide variety of species.\n\nTerai-Duar savanna and grasslands cover about 20% of the park's area. More than 50 species are found here including some of the world's tallest grasses like the elephant grass called \"Saccharum ravennae\", giant cane (\"Arundo donax\"), khagra reed (\"Phragmites karka\") and several species of true grasses. Kans grass (\"Saccharum spontaneum\") is one of the first grasses to colonise new sandbanks and to be washed away by the yearly monsoon floods.\n\nThe wide range of vegetation types in the Chitwan National Park is haunt of more than 700 species of wildlife and a not yet fully surveyed number of butterfly, moth and insect species. Apart from king cobra and rock python, 17 other species of snakes, starred tortoise and monitor lizards occur. The Narayani-Rapti river system, their small tributaries and myriads of oxbow lakes is habitat for 113 recorded species of fish and mugger crocodiles. In the early 1950s, about 235 gharials occurred in the Narayani River. The population has dramatically declined to only 38 wild gharials in 2003. Every year gharial eggs are collected along the rivers to be hatched in the breeding center of the \"Gharial Conservation Project\", where animals are reared to an age of 6–9 years. Every year young gharials are reintroduced into the Narayani-Rapti river system, of which sadly only very few survive.\n\nChitwan National Park is home to 68 mammal species. The \"king of the jungle\" is the Bengal tiger. The alluvial floodplain habitat of the Terai is one of the best tiger habitats anywhere in the world. Since the establishment of Chitwan National Park the initially small population of about 25 individuals increased to 70–110 in 1980. In some years this population has declined due to poaching and floods. In a long-term study carried out from 1995–2002 tiger researchers identified a relative abundance of 82 breeding tigers and a density of 6 females per . Information obtained from camera traps in 2010 and 2011 indicated that tiger density ranged between 4.44 and 6.35 individuals per . They offset their temporal activity patterns to be much less active during the day when human activity peaked.\n\nLeopards are most prevalent on the peripheries of the park. They co-exist with tigers, but being socially subordinate are not common in prime tiger habitat. In 1988, a clouded leopard was captured and radio-collared outside the protected area. It was released into the park, but did not stay there.\n\nChitwan is considered to have the highest population density of sloth bears with an estimated 200 to 250 individuals. Smooth-coated otters inhabit the numerous creeks and rivulets. Bengal foxes, spotted linsangs and honey badgers roam the jungle for prey. Striped hyenas prevail on the southern slopes of the Churia Hills. During a camera trapping survey in 2011, wild dogs were recorded in the southern and western parts of the park, as well as golden jackals, fishing cats, jungle cats, leopard cats, large and small Indian civets, Asian palm civets, crab-eating mongooses and yellow-throated martens.\n\nRhinoceros: since 1973 the population has recovered well and increased to 544 animals around the turn of the century. To ensure the survival of the endangered species in case of epidemics animals are translocated annually from Chitwan to the Bardia National Park and the Sukla Phanta Wildlife Reserve since 1986. However, the population has repeatedly been jeopardized by poaching: in 2002 alone, poachers killed 37 individuals in order to saw off and sell their valuable horns. Chitwan has the largest population of Indian rhinoceros in Nepal, estimated at 605 of 645 individuals in total in the country as of 2015.\n\nFrom time to time wild elephant bulls find their way from Valmiki National Park into the valleys of the park, apparently in search of elephant cows willing to mate.\n\nGaurs spend most of the year in the less accessible Churia Hills in the south of the national park. But when the bush fires ease off in springtime and lush grasses start growing up again, they descend into the grassland and riverine forests to graze and browse. The Chitwan population of the world's largest wild cattle species has increased from 188 to 368 animals in the years 1997 to 2016. Furthermore, 112 animals were counted in the adjacent Parsa Wildlife Reserve. The animals move freely between these parks.\n\nApart from numerous wild boars also sambar deer, red muntjac, hog deer and herds of chital inhabit the park. Four-horned antelopes reside predominantly in the hills. Rhesus monkeys, hanuman langurs, Indian pangolins, Indian porcupines, several species of flying squirrels, black-naped hares and endangered hispid hares are also present.\n\nEvery year dedicated bird watchers and conservationists survey bird species occurring all over the country. In 2006 they recorded 543 species in the Chitwan National Park, much more than in any other protected area in Nepal and about two-thirds of Nepal's globally threatened species. Additionally, 20 black-chinned yuhina, a pair of Gould's sunbird, a pair of blossom-headed parakeet and one slaty-breasted rail, an uncommon winter visitor, were sighted in spring 2008.\n\nEspecially the park's alluvial grasslands are important habitats for the critically endangered Bengal florican, the vulnerable lesser adjutant, grey-crowned prinia, swamp francolin and several species of grass warblers. In 2005 more than 200 slender-billed babblers were sighted in three different grassland types. The near threatened Oriental darter is a resident breeder around the many lakes, where egrets, bitterns, storks and kingfishers also abound.\nThe park is one of the few known breeding sites of the globally threatened spotted eagle.\nPeafowl and jungle fowl scratch their living on the forest floor.\n\nApart from the resident birds about 160 migrating and vagrant species arrive in Chitwan in autumn from northern latitudes to spend the winter here, among them the greater spotted eagle, eastern imperial eagle and Pallas's fish-eagle. Common sightings include brahminy ducks and goosanders. Large flocks of bar-headed geese just rest for a few days in February on their way north.\n\nAs soon as the winter visitors have left in spring, the summer visitors arrive from southern latitudes. The calls of cuckoos herald the start of spring. The colourful Bengal pittas and several sunbird species are common breeding visitors during monsoon. Among the many flycatcher species the paradise flycatcher with his long undulating tail in flight is a spectacular sight.\n\nChitwan National Park is one of Nepal's most popular tourist destinations. There are two main entrances to Chitwan National Park: Sauraha in the east and Meghauli Village in the west.\n\n\nThe park's unique rhino herd was featured on \"The Jeff Corwin Experience\" in season 2, episode 11.\n\nA tour experience on jeep safari, walking trek and village tour on Travel Photo Discovery on Chitwan National Park.\n\n"}

The game features single-player and multiplayer gameplay and contains an in-game level editor. The game engine is free and open-source software, under the zlib License, with commercial support available from the developer's business counterpart, Dot3 Labs. The game media is released under various non-free licenses. The aim of the project is not to produce the most features and highest-quality graphics possible, but rather to allow map-editing to be done in real-time within the game, while keeping the engine source code small and elegant.\n\nThe game has single-player and multiplayer modes. Multiplayer functionality is possible with LAN, local, and online play. The Online play gets its server listings from a master server. Offered gameplay modes are Free-For-All (deathmatch), Capture (where teams fight for control of points on the map, all weapons allowed), Capture the Flag (two teams fight to capture the other's flag and return it to their base), Teamplay (defeat the other team's players to score points for your team), Tactics (FFA, but players spawn with random equipment), Efficiency (FFA, but players spawn with all equipment) InstaHold, where two teams have to possess a single flag for a minimum of 20 seconds to score points; Collect (kill enemy players and collect their skulls, which then have to be returned to the home base), and Protect (teams try to touch each other's flag). Instagib (rifles only, 99 pieces of ammo, one shot kill, no pick-ups), regenerative weapons, and Teamplay versions of some of the game modes are available, as well as online cooperative map editing—one of \"Cube 2\"'s most interesting and popular features. There are also single-player modes featuring both episodic gameplay and deathmatches on multiplayer maps with AI bots instead of human opponents.\n\nCube 2: Sauerbraten started as a redesign of the original \"Cube\" game engine. \n\nThe \"Cube 2: Sauerbraten\" engine is written in C++ and OpenGL. \"Cube 2: Sauerbraten\" shares most of its design goals and philosophy with its predecessor, but using a new 6-directional heightfield (or octree) world model. \n\nIts first, developer-only, release was made on February 27, 2004. \n\nOne of the latest releases, dubbed the \"Justice Edition\", debuted on July 19, 2010, adding two new player models, thirty new user-created maps, several new game modes, including Efficiency CTF, Efficiency Hold, Efficiency Protect, Hold, and InstaHold; a mini-map, clock, and crosshairs, among various other things. The latest release is called \"Collect Edition\" and was released on January 4, 2013.\n\nTesseract is both an improved version of the Cube 2 game engine and is also a fork from the \"Cube 2 Sauerbraten\" game. The game offers better graphics, but has higher system requirements.\n\nInexor is a fork of Cube 2 intended to add more functionality. Eventually, it hopes to replace Sauerbraten.\n\nRed Eclipse was a fork of Cube 2 with improvements to the engine featuring a different gameplay. With version 2.0 it has been ported to the Tesseract engine.\n\nIn 2012 a Mozilla researcher, Alon Zakai, created a browser based demo called BananaBread by using Emscripten to port the C++ code into JavaScript and WebGL.\n\n\"Cube 2\"'s rendering engine is designed around modern graphics processing units, which perform best with huge batches of geometry already stored in video memory. Lighting is precomputed into lightmaps—image files that correspond to geometry as textures—for efficient batching, with an additional stored directional component, that allows for efficient shader-based lighting effects. The original \"Cube\" engine's rendering engine assumed that overdraw (where polygons that do not appear in the final scene are occluded via the z-buffer) was more processor-intensive than sending new streams of triangles to the graphics processing every frame, which vastly limited its performance on more modern hardware where memory bandwidth is a greater limiting factor. The most recent releases (starting with \"CTF Edition\") support a precomputed visibility system (PVS) for graphics cards that do not support hardware occlusion.\n\n\"Cube 2: Sauerbraten\" uses a 6-directional heightfield (or octree) world model. An octree, in Sauerbraten, is a cube that can be split into eight smaller cubes; those smaller cubes are also octrees, and can be subdivided further. This allows much more complex level geometry and easier editing.\n\nEach cube-shaped node in the octree represents a renderable volume, or a type of Marching cube, which are referred to as a \"cube\", where each edge of this cube can be lengthened or shortened to deform the cube into a variety of other shapes. Corners of cubes can also be \"pushed\" or \"pulled\" to create crude curves. The what you see is what you get realtime editing has enabled level designers to add a lot of detail to maps, while reducing the time spent on actual creation. This is in contrast to traditional modern polygon soup 3D engines which take a model generated as an essentially random batch of triangles from an external modelling program and attempt to spatially subdivide the model's triangles after the fact by splitting them to fit into tree structures, such as a BSP tree or even an octree, that require costly pre-processing to build. \"Cube 2\"'s novelty thus lies in that the world representation is the octree, or Marching cubes, structure itself, from which efficient triangle batches are generated for the graphics processing unit to render, without need for expensive and time-consuming pre-processing.\n\nThe game has been shown in a Burger King television commercial. It also received four out of five stars in a MacWorld UK review and was mentioned in Issue 3 of \"\" (as well as their \"101 Free Games\" article), where it was described as being \"perfect for both stingy and creative gamers alike\".\n\nThe \"CTF Edition\" was reviewed positively by Phoronix, a Linux-focused hardware and software review website, as well as Linux.com, a website providing news related to free and open-source software.\n\nThe game was quite popular; between 2004 and May 2017 the game was downloaded alone from Sourceforge.net over 5.3 million times.\n\n\n"}

In 2016, the sources of electricity purchased by the NES from TVA included 39.8% nuclear, 25.8% coal-fired, 21.5% natural gas-fired, 9.7% hydroelectric power, and 3.2% from wind and solar. \nIn 1938, the Tennessee Electric Power Company, the investor-owned utility for the Nashville area since 1922, sued the Tennessee Valley Authority for selling power in Nashville. TEPCO lost the suit, and was broken up in 1939. TVA bought TEPCO's assets for $79 million, while the city of Nashville took over TEPCO's power generation and distribution network and created the Electric Power Board of Nashville to run it. The Board adopted Nashville Electric Service as its operating name, and TEPCO's 500 employees became employees of NES. The board became part of the newly formed metropolitan government after the merger of Nashville and Davidson County in 1963.\n\n"}

(also known as Carson's) is an online retailer founded in 1854 as an American department store, which grew to over 50 locations, primarily in the Midwestern United States. Sold to the holding company of Bon-Ton in 2006, but still operated under the Carson name, the entire Bon-Ton collection of stores, including Carson's, went into bankruptcy and closed in 2018. BonTon's intellectual property was quickly sold while in bankruptcy, and the new owners reopened shortly afterwards as online retail.\n\nThe Carson Pirie Scott name is associated with the Carson, Pirie, Scott and Company Building designed by Louis Sullivan, built in 1899 for the retail firm Schlesinger & Mayer, and expanded and sold to Carson Pirie Scott in 1904, and occupied by them for more than a century.\n\nThe chain began in 1854 when Scotsmen Samuel Carson and John Pirie first clerked in the Murray's dry goods store in Peru, Illinois - then opened their own store in LaSalle followed by one in Amboy. In 1871, the Great Chicago Fire destroyed 60% of the store's stock. In 1961, Carson Pirie Scott & Co. greatly expanded in Illinois by purchasing the 20 unit Block & Kuhl chain headquartered in Peoria.\n\nJohn Edwin Scott operated a dry goods store in Ottawa, Illinois. He later moved up to Chicago and became the first partner of Samuel Carson and John T. Pirie in the ownership of a dry goods store, well known today as Carson Pirie Scott & Co. Two of John Scott's sons, Robert L. and Frederick H., were members of the department store firm.\n\nIn 1980, to diversify its business, Carson Pirie Scott & Co. borrowed $108 million to buy Dobbs Houses, Inc., an airline caterer and owner of the Toddle House and Steak 'n Egg Kitchen restaurant chains. These were sold in 1988, as was the County Seat clothing chain.\n\nIn 1989, Carson Pirie Scott & Co. was acquired by P.A. Bergner & Co. (founded in Peoria), who operated the Bergner's, Charles V. Weise, Myers Brothers and Boston Store chains.\n\nIn 1991, P.A. Bergner & Co. filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy; upon emerging from bankruptcy in 1993, it became a NASDAQ publicly traded company, changing its operating name to Carson Pirie Scott & Co. One year later, the company commenced trading on the NYSE under the CRP symbol.\n\nBy 1998, Carson Pirie Scott & Co. ownership was held by Proffitt's, Inc., (later renamed Saks Incorporated to reflect the acquisition of Saks Fifth Avenue). The Carson Pirie Scott, Bergner's, and Boston Store chains, along with Younkers and Herberger's nameplates, eventually operated as Saks' Northern Department Store Group (NDSG), based in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. In late 2005, however, the group was put up for sale as Saks Incorporated tried to refocus itself primarily on its core Saks Fifth Avenue stores.\n\nCarson's and its associated stores became part of The Bon-Ton Stores Inc. in a $1.1 billion deal completed on March 6, 2006. The group's merchandising and marketing base remained in Milwaukee.\n\nBon-Ton converted Elder-Beerman stores in Indiana and Michigan to the newly shortened Carson's name in 2011 and 2012. The chain expanded into Metro Detroit in 2013 with the conversion of three Parisian stores.\n\nBon-Ton announced on April 17, 2018 that they would cease operations and began liquidating all 267 stores after two liquidators, Great American Group and Tiger Capital Group, won an auction for the company. The bid was estimated to be worth $775.5 million. This included all remaining Carson's stores after 164 years of operation. According to national retail reporter Mitch Nolen, stores closed within 10 to 12 weeks.\n\nThe intellectual property of Bon-Ton, including Carson's, was quickly sold in bankruptcy to CSC Generation, and online retail was reopened. The new owners, based in Merrillville, Indiana were also exploring opening new store locations. On October 29, 2018; Under this new ownership and using the same company and stores' names, Bon-Ton started announcing it would reopen the Evergreen Park, Illinois Carson's store on November 24 (Black Friday)–one of Bon-Ton's first brick-and-mortar stores to reopen. Bon-Ton has also announced plans to open brick-and-mortar Carson's stores in Bloomingdale, Lombard and Orland Park.\n\n\n\n"}

The Massachusetts Burma Law was modeled after similar legislation that had targeted the apartheid regime of South Africa.\n\nThe Court reasoned that since the United States Congress passed a law imposing sanctions on Myanmar, the Massachusetts law \"undermines the intended purpose and 'natural effect' of at least three provisions of the federal Act, that is, its delegation of effective discretion to the President to control economic sanctions against Burma, its limitation of sanctions solely to United States persons and new investment, and its directive to the President to proceed diplomatically in developing a comprehensive, multilateral strategy towards Burma.\"\n\n\n"}

His stories, appearing under the pen name, \"Nessmuk\" popularized self-guided canoe camping tours of the Adirondack lakes in open, lightweight solo canoes and what is today called ultralight camping or ultralight backpacking.\n\nCanoeing had been popularized by Scottish lawyer John MacGregor in the 1860s, but the typical canoe trip of the day employed expert guides and heavy canoes. Sears, who was tall and had a , solo canoe built by J. Henry Rushton of Canton, New York. He named it the \"Sairy Gamp\" (the name of a Dickens character) and in it he completed a journey through the central Adirondacks. He was 62 years old and in frail health (tuberculosis and asthma) at the time. William Henry Harrison Murray's \"Adventures in the Wilderness\", published in 1869, had praised the Adirondacks as having a healthy atmosphere for consumptives and Verplanck Colvin's enthusiastic writing about the Adirondack wilderness had further inspired the trip. The \"Sairy Gamp\" was acquired by the Smithsonian Institution and is now on loan to the Adirondack Museum.\n\nHe grew up the eldest of ten children in South Oxford (now Webster), Massachusetts. He took his pen name from a Native American who had befriended him in early childhood. He was fascinated by the few books about Native Americans his family possessed, which left him with an abiding interest in forest life and adventure. A period of factory labor while still a child left him with a fondness for the writing of Charles Dickens. At age twelve he started working in a commercial fishing fleet based on Cape Cod and at nineteen he signed on for a three-year voyage on a whaler headed for the South Pacific; it was the same year (1841) that Herman Melville shipped out of the same port bound for the same whaling grounds. On his return, his family moved to Wellsboro, Pennsylvania where he was to live for the rest of his life. However, he continued traveling for adventure, from the upper Midwest and Ontario to an Amazon tributary in Brazil (in 1867 and again in 1870).\n\nSears wrote \"Woodcraft\", a book on camping, in 1884, that has remained in print ever since. A book of poems, \"Forest Runes\", appeared in 1887. He died at his home in Pennsylvania seven years later. Mount Nessmuk, in northern Pennsylvania, is named after him.\n\n"}

All planets, comets, and asteroids in the Solar System, and the Sun itself are in such orbits, as are many artificial probes and pieces of debris. The moons of planets in the Solar System, by contrast, are not in heliocentric orbits, as they orbit their respective planet (although the Moon has a convex orbit around the Sun).\n\nThe barycenter of the Solar System, while always very near the Sun, moves through space as time passes, depending on where other large bodies in the Solar System, such as Jupiter and other large gas planets, are located at that time. A similar phenomenon allows the detection of exoplanets by way of the radial-velocity method.\n\nThe \"helio-\" prefix is derived from the Greek word \"ἥλιος\", meaning \"Sun\", and also Helios, the personification of the Sun in Greek mythology.\n\nThe first spacecraft to be put in a heliocentric orbit was Luna 1 in 1959. An incorrectly timed upper-stage burn caused it to miss its planned impact on the Moon.\n\nA \"trans-Mars injection (TMI)\" is a heliocentric orbit in which a propulsive maneuver is used to set a spacecraft on a trajectory, also known as Mars transfer orbit, which will place it as far as Mars's orbit.\n\nEvery two years, low-energy transfer windows open up, which allow movement between planets with the lowest possible delta-v requirements. Transfer injections can place spacecraft into either a Hohmann transfer orbit or bi-elliptic transfer orbit. Trans-Mars injections can be either a single maneuver burn, such as that used by the NASA MAVEN orbiter, or a series of perigee kicks, such as that used by the ISRO Mars Orbiter Mission.\n\n"}

He currently serves as the Chairman of Jindal Steel and Power Limited and Chancellor of O. P. Jindal Global University.\n\nHe is an active campaigner for population stabilisation, women's empowerment, environmental conservation, health and education. As an acknowledgement of Jindal's support to his alma mater, the University of Texas at Dallas renamed its School of Management to Naveen Jindal School of Management in 2011. Along with his wife, a noted danseuse, Shallu Jindal – he founded the Flag Foundation of India, which is their effort to foster among Indian youth respect for the Tiranga and the values it embodies.\n\nJindal was born in Hisar, Haryana, on 9 March 1970, youngest child of the late industrialist-philanthropist-politician Shri Om Prakash Jindal, former Minister of Power in the Government of Haryana, India, and his wife Smt Savitri Jindal who too was a minister in Haryana Government till 2014. Naveen studied at Campus School, CCS HAU and DPS Mathura Road before graduating in Commerce from Hans Raj College, Delhi University in 1990. He completed an MBA at the University of Texas at Dallas in 1992. He was the President of the Student Government and recipient of the Student Leader of the Year Award at the University of Texas at Dallas.\n\nJindal's involvement in politics began in his student days. He was the President of the Student Government and recipient of the Student Leader of the Year Award at the University of Texas at Dallas. After completing his post-graduation in the US, Naveen returned to India and began managing his father's political affairs.\n\nIn 2004 he stood for elections from the Kurukshetra constituency in the north Indian state of Haryana on an Indian National Congress ticket. He defeated his nearest rival Abhay Singh Chautala by a margin of 1,30,000 votes. He was re-elected in the 2009 general elections. His focus as an MP has been the problems of corruption, over-population, women's empowerment, environment, health and education. Naveen moved a private member bill in Lok Sabha for a comprehensive Food and Nutrition Security Scheme that paved the way for the Food Security Act. He lost the 2014 Lok Sabha election from Kurukshetra.\n\nParliamentary responsibilities & initiatives\n\nFlying national flag initiative\n\nNaveen Jindal's struggle for the Tricolour began in early 1992 when he hoisted a tricolour at his factory in Raigarh. The then Commissioner of Bilaspur objected to it on the ground that as per the Flag Code of India, a private citizen was not permitted to fly the Indian flag except on certain days. Jindal filed a petition before the High Court arguing that no law could forbid Indian citizens from flying the national flag and, furthermore, the Flag Code of India was only a set of executive instructions from the Government of India and therefore not law. While he went out to court against the objections of the government officials, he did not remove the flag from the factory and kept flying it with respect and dignity.\n\nThe High Court allowed the petition and held the Flag Code of India was not a valid restriction on the right to freedom of expression under Article 19 of the Indian Constitution. The High Court observed that, according to Article 19(2), the only valid limitations on this right were those that were contained in statute. In cases concerning the regulation of the flying of the national flag, such limitations could be found in the Emblems and Names (Prevention of Improper Use) Act 1950 or the Prevention of Insults to National Honour Act 1971.\n\nThe Union of India filed an appeal against this decision to the Supreme Court on the basis that whether citizens were free to fly the national flag was a policy decision, and could not be subject to court interference.\n\nSupreme Court was pleased to grant leave and stay the operation of the impugned judgment. The flag continued to fly as Naveen's lawyer said \"it would not be contempt of court since the judgement had only been stayed\".\n\nThe matter then came up for hearing before the Supreme Court which observed that prima facie they see no reason why citizens cannot express patriotism by displaying the national flag. The court also observed that restrictions on flying of national flag only on certain days by private citizens seemed unsustainable.\n\nThe Supreme Court on 23 January 2004 dismissed the Civil Appeal No. 2920 of 1996 arising out of SLP No. 1888 of 1996 filed by Union of India against the judgment and order dates 22 September 1995 of Delhi High Court and held that flying the national flag was symbol of expression that came within the right to freedom of expression under Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution.\n\nJindal has been strongly advocating to mark 23rd January as the \"National Flag Day\". While India observes Armed Forces Flag Day on 7th December, it does not have a National Flag day.\n\nRevelations in September 2012 alleged the involvement of him and his company in the alleged Coalgate scam. His company allegedly gained by making and selling power at high prices. The coal blocks allotted to Jindal Power Limited (JPL) in 1998, during the BJP ruled NDA regime, were followed by allocations under the UPA, which have culminated in making the Jindal Group the largest beneficiary of coal block allocations. It has reserves of 2,580 million metric tonnes of coal, while the second largest beneficiary in the private sector has just 1,500 million metric tonnes. It was alleged that despite having the cheapest coal, Jindal sold power at higher prices – Rs 3.85 per unit in 2011–2012, compared to Lanco's Rs 3.67 and NTPC's Rs 2.20. The previous year, JPL had sold power at an even higher rate of Rs 4.30 per unit. The combination of cheap coal and high power prices explains why Jindal posted Rs 17.65 billion as profits, or 60% of its revenues, while Lanco made a profit of just Rs 1.55 billion, just 12% of its revenues.\n\nIn an exclusive interview with Headlines Today editor Rahul Kanwal, Jindal explained how JSPL's profitability was because of its efficiency.\n\nThe Supreme Court in its August 2014 judgement pulled up the Central Government's arbitrary allocation policy for coal blocks. The court order did not implicate any private company including Jindal Steel and Power Limited of any wrongdoing.\n\nThe CBI filed chargesheet in alleged coal scam on 11 June 2013 and the investigation is on the way. It also filed a chargesheet in coal block allocation in Jharkhand on 29 April 2015.\n\nThe Chhattisgarh High Court directed police to file a rape complaint against Naveen Jindal and his associate in January 2015.\nHowever, the probe highlighted that the allegations were fake. Subsequently, an F.I.R was registered against Zee Group Chairman Subhash Chandra and his son Punit Goenka for falsely grafting false charges against Jindal.\n\nOn 25 October 2012 Jindal held a press conference in which he showed video evidence where it was clear that some officials of Zee News tried to extort a sum Rs 1 billion from Jindal in return for not running the story of Jindal being involved in the Coal scam. Jindal filed a case against Zee News management and its editors for extorting money. Two Zee News editors Sudhir Choudhary and Samir Ahluwalia were sent to jail and later released on bail. Jindal has petitioned the court to cancel the bail of the two editors. It was said in the petition that the accused has been using Zee news and other media of Zee group to constantly target Jindal and his companies through misinformation and reports. Patiala House court on June 6, 2015 issued notices to the editors Chaudhary and Ahluwalia asking ‘why their bails should not be cancelled’ in the case.\n\nNaveen Jindal is the Chairman of Jindal Steel and Power Limited (formerly known as Jindal Strips Limited) which was a moderately performing enterprise when Naveen Jindal first took over its Raigarh and Raipur operations in 1993.

Traditionally an independent village in County Durham, it was incorporated into the Metropolitan Borough of Gateshead on 1 April 1974. The population taken at the 2011 Census of the Gateshead ward (Crawcrook and Greenside) had increased to 8,841.\n\nCrawcrook lies midway between Prudhoe in Northumberland and Ryton, also in Tyne and Wear.\n\nIn local government, Crawcrook is located in the 'Crawcrook, Greenside and Clara Vale ward'. The ward is at the far west of the borough and borders Northumberland. The Crawcrook and Greenside ward is served by three Labour councillors, Jack Graham, Helen Hughes and Kathleen McCartney.\n\nCrawcrook is located within the parliamentary constituency of Blaydon. Its current MP is Labour's Liz Twist.\n\nAt the turn of the twentieth century, and in common with the nearby areas of Greenside, Clara Vale and Stargate, Crawcrook was a village with a vibrant coal industry. With major pits such as Emma and Clara, as well as several smaller pits, Crawcrook became a major coal mining centre. However the coal industry collapsed in the village during the 1950s and 1960s. As has happened to a number of other northern English villages employment in tertiary industries has replaced the coal industry. However, Crawcrook's coal mining heritage is still evident; a number of the old miners' homes still exist in the surrounding area, including Clifford Terrace and Morgy Hill near to Crawcrook's main street, and the Simpson Memorial Home in nearby Barmoor. Old wagonways used to transport coal are also still present, although they are now maintained as footpaths.\n\nDuring the 1970s and 1980s, with the creation of the Kepier Chare and Westburn private housing estates, Crawcrook grew significantly in size and became largely suburbanised and is being used increasingly as a commuter village for the conurbation of Tyneside.\n\nUnlike many villages of a similar semi-rural character, Crawcrook has maintained its broad range of amenities. Crawcrook main street has several shops including a library, a co-operative food store and two petrol stations. It also has a selection of independent shops including a family run freezer centre/bargain store, which in October 2015 was renovated into a One Stop Store which is still family run, A greengrocers, A butchers, Three gentlemen's barbers, two hairdressing salons, a tanning salon, a number of pubs, a chiropodist, a doctor's surgery, which was rebuilt with a new pharmacy right next door, two veterinary practices and a restaurant. There are also several churches in the village from a number of denominations including Catholic, Pentecostal, Church of England and Methodist. After the closure of Kepier Chare school, the village now has only two primary schools; St Agnes Roman Catholic school and Emmaville school. During 2007, Emmaville school was extended to allow former pupils from Kepier Chare to attend there. In 2009 St Agnes Roman Catholic School relocated to the former Kepier Chare school. There is also a separate private nursery located next to the Doctor's Surgery.\n\nThe area is also well served by public transport, with regular bus links to Hexham, the MetroCentre, Gateshead and Newcastle Upon Tyne as well as nearby towns and villages such as Ryton, Prudhoe, Chopwell, High Spen and Clara Vale.\n\nCrawcrook has its own village park, located in the Garden House Estate area of the village. Created in the 1950s it consists of toddler play equipment, a tennis court/five a side football area, and a bowling green.\n\nOther recreational facilities nearby include four golf courses, Tyneside golf club at Ryton, Ryton golf club at Clara Vale, Close House golf club in Wylam, and Prudhoe golf club in Prudhoe. Golf courses slightly further away include Whickham golf club, at Whickham, Garesfield golf club at High Spen and Stocksfield golf club in Stocksfield.\n\nThere are two primary schools in the village. St Agnes RC school, the school of Crawcrook's Roman Catholic parish, and Emmaville primary school. Both schools perform exceedingly well compared to other schools in the Gateshead Local Education Authority and nationally.\n\nThere was a third school, Kepier Chare school. However, in 2007 it was closed with some pupils transferred to Emmaville school or other local schools In 2010 St Agnes RC school relocated to the former Kepier Chare and is to date still there.\n\nWithin less than a mile of Crawcrook's main street and its residential areas, lies farmland and rich countryside, particularly to the west and north of the village. To the west of the village these include farmland and Sled Lane, with its woodland and ponds; Bradley Gardens, a Victorian walled garden and, to the north, more farmland as well as the meadows between Crawcrook and Wylam.\n\nOther notable features of Crawcrook's environment include its landed estates, in particular Bradley Hall, and its sand quarries, that have partly encroached on some of its countryside to the north-west of the village. Further down the Tyne valley there are picturesque villages and towns such as Prudhoe, Stocksfield and Corbridge.\n\nThere are quite a few churches in Crawcrook, one Methodist, one Anglican, and one Roman Catholic (St Agnes).\n\n"}

Most Florida avocados that were marketable at home failed to meet the California standard, because they were a different variety from those sold in California, with a lower fat content. Accordingly, Florida avocado growers brought this suit, arguing (unsuccessfully) that the California law (1) was preempted by federal law, (2) violated equal protection, and (3) unduly burdened and interfered with their right to engage in interstate commerce. The case is widely used in law school casebooks on constitutional law and federal jurisdiction as illustrative of preemption issues.\n\nThere are three principal races or groups of avocado: Mexican, Guatemalan and West Indian, named for the areas where they were originally cultivated. Mexican avocados have foliage with an anise scent and small fruits about the size of a plum, with black or purple smooth skin. Guatemalan avocados have larger, blackish-green, rough-skinned fruits. The West Indian avocado has the largest fruits, up to 2 lbs (1 kg), with smooth light green skin. Mexican avocados have the highest oil content; West Indian the lowest. The important cultivars now in commercial production are mostly hybrids between these three original races.\n\nIn 1925, California enacted a law requiring that \"all avocados, at the time of picking, and at all times thereafter, shall contain not less than 8 percent of oil, by weight of the avocado excluding the skin and seed.\" In 1925, practically all the avocados in the United States came from California. The purpose of this legislation was to prevent the marketing of immature avocados, which never ripen properly, but decay or shrivel up and become rubbery and unpalatable. The effect of marketing immature avocados is to antagonize consumers; this increases future sales resistance against buying avocados.\n\nIn 1925, most of the avocados grown in California were, as they are at the present time, from trees derived from Mexican varieties (e.g. Haas avocados). Such avocados contain at least 8% oil when mature. The Florida avocado growers, however, mostly cultivate West Indian, Guatemalan, and hybrid varieties, which may reach maturity and be acceptable and reach their prime for marketing prior to reaching an 8% oil content, or they may never reach that level of oil content. All members of the Court agreed that there is no health issue; the question is \"a purely economic one.\"\n\nThe Florida avocado growers objected to the California law because it severely restricts the access of Florida growers to the California market.\n\nWhile California's avocado maturity standard is provided by statute, Florida's is set by a marketing order under the Agricultural Adjustment Act (AAA), a New Deal measure creating a regime of self-government for farmers, designed to \"promote orderly competition among the South Florida growers\" of avocados. The marketing orders for avocados are drafted by the South Florida Avocado Administrative Committee, which consists entirely of representatives of the growers concerned. The Secretary of Agriculture invariably adopts the Committee's recommendations for avocado maturity dates, sizes, and weights.\n\nBecause the Florida avocado growers sued to enjoin the enforcement against them of the California law because it was unconstitutional, the case was brought before a three-judge district court. The growers challenged the constitutionality of the statute on three grounds:\n\nAt the initial stage of the case, the three-judge district court dismissed the case on jurisdictional grounds, finding that there was not a current justiciable case or controversy. On direct appeal, the Supreme Court held that the suit was one for a three-judge court and presented a justiciable controversy to be tried on the merits.\n\nAfter a trial, the three-judge court denied an injunction against the enforcement of § 792 on the ground that the proofs did not establish that its application to Florida avocados violated any provision of the Federal Constitution. The District Court held for several reasons that the Supremacy Clause did not operate to displace § 792: (1) no actual conflict existed between the statute and the federal marketing orders; (2) neither the AAA nor the marketing orders occupied the field to the exclusion of the state statute, and (3) Congress had not ordained that a federal marketing order was to give a license to Florida producers to \"market their avocados without further inspection by the states\" after compliance with the federal maturity test.\n\nRather, the court observed, \"[t]he Federal law does not cover the whole field of interstate shipment of avocados,\" but, by necessary implication, leaves the regulation of certain aspects of their distribution to the States. Further, the District Court found no violation of the Equal Protection Clause, because the California statute was applicable on identical terms to Florida and California producers, and was reasonably designed to enforce a traditional and legitimate interest of the State of California in the protection of California consumers. The District Court concluded, finally, that § 792 did not unreasonably burden or discriminate against interstate commerce in out-of-state avocados—that the 8% oil content test served, in practice, only to keep off California grocers' shelves fruit which was unpalatable because prematurely picked. This holding rested, in part, on the conclusion that mature Florida fruit had not been shown to be incapable of attaining 8% oil content, since only a small fraction of Florida avocados of certain varieties in fact failed to meet the California test.\n\nBoth parties then appealed to the Supreme Court.\n\nJustice William J. Brennan delivered the 5-4 opinion of the Court, joined by Chief Justice Earl Warren, and Justices John Marshall Harlan II, Potter Stewart, and Arthur J. Goldberg.\n\nThe Florida avocado growers' main challenge was under the Supremacy Clause, because some avocados that satisfy the standard set by the AAA marketing order do not satisfy the California 8% oil test.\n\nThe Court began by putting aside two issues that it considered beside the point. First, \"a federal license or certificate of compliance with minimum federal standards [does not] immunize[] the licensed commerce from inconsistent or more demanding state regulations.\" (To this, the dissent responded that \"Gibbons v. Ogden\" is to the contrary.) Second, it is incorrect to claim that \"the coexistence of federal and state regulatory legislation should depend upon whether the purposes of the two laws are parallel or divergent.\" The proper test, the Court said, \"is whether both regulations can be enforced without impairing the federal superintendence of the field, not whether they are aimed at similar or different objectives.\" And preemption should be found only when there are \"persuasive reasons—either that the nature of the regulated subject matter permits no other conclusion or that the Congress has unmistakably so ordained.\"\n\nThe Court then outlined the different ways preemption occurs. First, a holding of federal exclusion of state law \"is inescapable, and requires no inquiry into congressional design where compliance with both federal and state regulations is a physical impossibility.\" This would occur, for example, if the federal marketing order forbade the marketing of any avocado testing more than 7% oil, while the California test excluded from the State any avocado measuring less than 8% oil. \"As to those Florida avocados of the hybrid and Guatemalan varieties which were actually rejected by the California test, the District Court indicated that the Florida growers might have avoided such rejections by leaving the fruit on the trees beyond the earliest picking date permitted by the federal regulations, and nothing in the record contradicts that suggestion.\" (The dissent pointed out, however, that doing this would shorten the marketing window for those avocados, contrary to the federal scheme. Therefore, \"inevitable collision between the two schemes of regulation\" is present.)\n\nAnother basis for preemption would be whether \"the nature of the subject matter, namely, the maturity of avocados, or any explicit declaration of congressional design to displace state regulation require § 792 to yield to the federal marketing orders.\" The Court said this is not a subject requiring national uniformity. On the contrary, as a regulation of food, \"the maturity of avocados is a subject matter of the kind this Court has traditionally regarded as properly within the scope of state superintendence,\" because it is regarded as a matter of \"peculiarly local concern.\" The majority distinguished between pre- and post-commerce federal regulation; it said that regulation of standards of the picking, processing, and transportation of agricultural commodities in commerce as properly a field of comprehensive federal regulation, but it should not displace \"state control over the distribution and retail sale of those commodities in the interests of the consumers of the commodities within the State.\" Thus a state such as Florida could not prohibit exportation in commerce of federally certified avocados, but another state such as California may regulate their marketing in that state. At least: \"Such a displacement may not be inferred automatically from the fact that Congress has regulated production and packing of commodities for the interstate market.\" The Court found it immaterial that this was an economic rather than health and safety measure: \"neither logic nor precedent invites any distinction between state regulations designed to keep unhealthful or unsafe commodities off the grocer's shelves and those designed to prevent the deception of consumers.\"\n\nThe Court then turned to whether Congress intended that the AAA scheme should displace state law. \"The settled mandate governing this inquiry, in deference to the fact that a state regulation of this kind is an exercise of the historic police powers of the States, is not to decree such a federal displacement \"unless that was the clear and manifest purpose of Congress.\" There must be \"an unambiguous congressional mandate to that effect,\" but the Court concluded, \"We search in vain for such a mandate.\" Nothing in the AAA or its legislative history disclosed a \"comprehensive congressional design.\"\n\nFinally the Court expressed skepticism about the truly federal nature of the scheme:\n\nThe Court therefore concluded that Congress did not intend \"to oust or displace state powers to enact the regulation embodied in § 792.\" Rather: \"The most plausible inference from the legislative scheme is that the Congress contemplated that state power to enact such regulations should remain unimpaired.\"\n\nThe Court affirmed the district court's conclusion that the state standard does not work an irrational discrimination as between persons or groups of persons.\" While \"it may well be\" that arguably superior tests of maturity could be devised than the 8% oil test, this possibility does not make the state's choice \"either arbitrary or devoid of rational relationship to a legitimate regulatory interest.\" That is not a question for the courts to decide, and \"it is sufficient that, on this record, we should conclude, as we do, that oil content appears to be an acceptable criterion of avocado maturity.\"\n\nThe Court insisted that \"the present record permits no inference that the California statute had a discriminatory objective.\" Nor has it been shown that \"notwithstanding a legitimate state interest in some form of regulation,\" § 792 \"exceeded the limits necessary to vindicate that interest\"; or that § 792 was \"an illegitimate attempt to control the conduct of producers beyond the borders of California.\" Nonetheless, the record was inadequate. Much of the proof was directed to other issues than those that would be probative on these points, and the court and parties left it uncertain what evidence entered the record. Therefore, a remand on the Commerce Clause issue was necessary for a new trial on this issue.\n\nCalifornia cross-appealed on the ground that the district court should have dismissed the action for want of equity, rather than for lack of merit. The contention is that there was no justiciable controversy and an insufficient showing of injury (there must be an irreparable injury) to the Florida growers to invoke the district court's equity jurisdiction. The Court rejected both arguments.\n\nFirst, in the earlier appeal, \"Florida Lime & Avocado Growers, Inc. v. Jacobsen\", the Court had held that, because of the Florida growers' allegations that California officials had consistently condemned Florida avocados as unfit for sale in California, \"thus requiring [the Florida growers]—to prevent destruction and complete loss of their shipments—to reship the avocados to and sell them in other States.\" Thus it was evident that \"there is an existing dispute between the parties as to present legal rights amounting to a justiciable controversy which appellants are entitled to have determined on the merits.\"\n\nSecond, even on the present inadequate and ambiguous record, the Florida growers demonstrated sufficient injury to warrant at least a trial of their allegations. It was conceded that the State, in objecting to the growers' proffered evidence, did not dispute the claim that some shipments of Florida avocados had, in fact, been rejected by California for failure to comply with the oil content requirement, to at least the extent of as much as 6.4% of the total shipments of Florida avocados into California. That is enough to warrant a trial on the merits. Furthermore, the case is not moot. It is clear that the California officials will continue to enforce the statute against the Florida-grown avocados, for the State's answer to the complaint declared that these officials \"have in the past and now stand ready to perform their duties under their oath of office should they acquire knowledge of violations of the Agricultural Code of the State of California.\n\nJustice Byron White filed a dissenting opinion, joined by Justices Hugo Black, William O. Douglas, and Tom C. Clark.\n\nThe four-justice dissent addressed only the preemption issue: \"Since we in the minority have concluded that the Agricultural Adjustment Act and regulations promulgated thereunder leave no room for this inconsistent and conflicting state legislation, we reach only the Supremacy Clause issue.\"\n\nThe dissent invoked the same legal standard for preemption as the majority: \nThe ultimate question for the Court is whether the California law may validly apply to Florida avocados which the Secretary or his inspector says are mature under the federal scheme. We in the minority believe that it cannot, for, in our view, the California law \"stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress.\" \"Hines v. Davidowitz\".\n\nBut it reached the opposite legal conclusion:\n\nThe central and unavoidable fact is that six out of every 100 Florida avocados certified as mature by federal standards are turned away from the California markets as being immature, and are excluded from that State by the application of a maturity test different from the federal measure. Congress empowered the Secretary to provide for the orderly marketing of avocados, and to specify the quality and maturity of avocados to be transported in interstate commerce to any and all markets. Although the Secretary determined that these Florida avocados were mature by federal standards and fit for sale in interstate markets, the State of California determined that they were unfit for sale by applying a test of the type which the Secretary had determined to be unsatisfactory. We think the state law has erected a substantial barrier to the accomplishment of congressional objectives.\n\nThe dissent asserted that the Secretary of Agriculture:\n\nhas promulgated a comprehensive and pervasive regulatory scheme for determining the quality and maturity of Florida avocados, pursuant to the statutory mandate to \"effectuate orderly marketing of such agricultural commodities.\" He prescribes in minute detail the standards for the size, appearance, shape, and maturity of avocados. Inspection procedures and, for violation of the regulations, criminal and civil sanctions are provided. No gap exists in the regulatory scheme which would warrant state action to prevent the evils of a no-man's land . . . No aspects of avocado maturity are omitted under the federal regulations. Any additional state regulation to \"supplement\" federal regulation would \"pro tanto\" supplant it with another scheme, thereby compromising to some degree the congressional policy expressed in the Act.\nBoth the California and Secretary's regulatory scheme have the same purpose, a purely economic one—to protect against the marketing of immature avocados, which would antagonize consumers and thus harm the industry. But the California scheme uses one test and the Secretary's scheme uses another. The result is to interfere with national marketing of agricultural products, contrary to the stated purposes of the AAA:\n\nIt is declared that the disruption of the orderly exchange of commodities in interstate commerce . . . destroys the value of agricultural assets which support the national credit structure . . . and burden[s] and obstruct[s] . . . commerce.<br><br>It is declared to be the policy of Congress . . . to establish and maintain such minimum standards of quality and maturity and such grading and inspection requirements for agricultural commodities . . . as will effectuate . . . orderly marketing. . . .\n\nIt may be, as the majority suggests, White went on, that \"local conditions of soil, climate, and the like\" might call for different rules at the production end of the stream of commerce, but uniformity at the market end of the flow of commerce can be necessary to prevent burdens on commerce in agricultural produce:\n\nIt may not obstruct or burden commerce to admit avocados into commerce on diverse bases in different parts of the country; any individual grower in that situation would face but one standard. But it does burden commerce and frustrate the congressional purpose when each grower faces different standards in different markets. To slip from permissible nonuniformity at one end of the stream of commerce to permissible nonuniformity at the other end thus is to read the statute too casually and gloss over the congressional purpose, which expressly was to facilitate marketing in and transportation to \"any and all markets in the current of interstate commerce.\"\n\nThe dissent saw a clear case of conflict between the state and federal regulatory schemes:\n\nThe conflict between federal and state law is unmistakable here. The Secretary asserts certain Florida avocados are mature. The state law rejects them as immature. And the conflict is over a matter of central importance to the federal scheme. The elaborate regulatory scheme of the marketing order is focused upon the problem of moving mature avocados into interstate commerce.\n\nBecause the Secretary of Agriculture adopted one avocado maturity test and California adopted a different one, the state test must give way to the federal one. It is not this Court's duty to decide which test is better. \"Neither California nor this Court has any place second-guessing the wisdom of Congress or its delegate,\" the Secretary of Agriculture. The majority \"ignores the plain words of the statute in concluding that the California law does not frustrate the federal scheme.\"373 U.S. at 175.\n\nThe dissent concluded:\n\nThe conclusion is inescapable that the California law is an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the congressional purposes and objectives, and that the California law and the Agricultural Adjustment Act, as supplemented by the regulations promulgated thereunder, cannot be reconciled, and cannot consistently stand together. The Court should not allow avocados certified as mature under the federal marketing order to be embargoed by any State because it thinks that they are immature.\n\nAfter the remand, and a decade later, a three-judge federal district court decided \"J.R. Brooks & Son, Inc. v. Reagan\". The court found that \"the California 8 percent oil content requirement has been maintained and applied against Florida-grown avocados, as the result of pressure from the California avocado industry, for the purpose . . . of excluding competition from Florida avocados in California markets,\" and the statute has been \"maintained and applied to operate, and in fact has operated, as an embargo against Florida-grown avocados\" with the effect that it \"has caused higher avocado prices to California consumers by preventing the sale of competitive Florida fruit.\"\n\nThe court also found that the U.S. Secretary of Agriculture's regulations governing Florida avocado maturity \"effectively keep[ ] immature Florida avocados out of the channels of commerce.\" Moreover, these regulations \"provide a better index of maturity than does an 8 percent oil content requirement.\" \"Absent the 8 percent oil content requirement, Florida shippers of avocados would market substantial quantities of West Indian varieties of avocados in California,\" but even though they are in fact mature they will not pass the California 8 percent test. The effect is that the California statute \"as applied to Florida avocados, discriminates in favor of California avocado growers and shippers and against Florida avocado growers and shippers\" and \"arbitrarily and unreasonably burdens interstate commerce in Florida avocados by imposing a standard which is irrational as applied to Florida avocados.\"\n\nThe court accordingly concluded:\n\nWere it not for the United States Supreme Court decision in \"Florida Avocado Growers v. Paul\", we would conclude that: the application of [the relevant section of the] California Agricultural Code . . . to Florida avocados previously certified as mature under the Federal Marketing Order, violates the Supremacy Clause. The application of the California statute to Florida avocados discriminates against Florida avocados and unreasonably burdens interstate marketing of Florida avocados in violation of the Commerce Clause.\n\nThe court therefore held that California could no longer enforce its law requiring 8 percent oil content \"with respect to avocados grown in Florida and shipped to California in interstate commerce.\"\n\nRobert M. O'Neil, who had been Justice Brennan's law clerk at the time of the \"Avocado\" decision, analyzed the case in a 1975 article. O'Neil asserted:\nFederal regulation of one end of a stream of commerce did not inherently require the states to keep their hands off the other end. The Court did not distinguish\nbetween protecting consumers against wasting money on immature produce and protecting health or safety. In fact, the Court seems to have deliberately declined a clear invitation to establish a hierarchy of state regulatory interests. Thus, by implication, preventing deception is as constitutionally valid a purpose as preventing disease in event of a federal-state conflict.\n\nO'Neil compared the \"Avocado\" case with the \"Head\" case decided during the same term of Court, in which Justice Brennan had concurred separately. In that case, a radio station challenged a New Mexico law forbidding the advertising of eyeglass prices, arguing that the law was in unconstitutional conflict with the regulatory authority of the Federal Communications\nCommission. The majority held that Congress could not have intended its grant of authority to the FCC to supplant all\nthe detailed state regulation of professional advertising practices. According to O'Neil, \"Justice Brennan, who wrote the majority opinion in the \"Avocado\" case, offered a . . . different view\" in a separate concurring opinion. He disagreed that the FCC regulatory scheme did not address advertising practices. \"Thus, preemption could not be avoided because of any lack of federal authority in the field.\" Rather, it was avoided by the teachings of the \"Avocado\" case. These were:\nO'Neil concluded that of the few preemption cases since 1963:\nNone of these has shed more light on consumer\nprotection issues than the \"Avocado\" and \"Head\" cases. Meanwhile, lower federal and state courts, faced with regulatory conflicts in the consumer area, have looked to \"Avocado\" for guidance.\n\nJan Deutsch, who had been the law clerk of Justice Potter Stewart at the time of the \"Avocado\" and \"Head\" decisions, wrote at length about the \"Avocado\" case. Deutsch emphasized the difference between the majority's and dissent's respective views of the contexts of the two regulatory schemes, and in particular the legitimacy of each scheme. The majority opinion insists, \"[T]he present record permits no inference that the California statute had a discriminatory objective.\" At the same time, the majority questioned the legitimacy of the AAA marketing order scheme because:\n\n[T]he Florida avocado maturity standards are drafted each year not by impartial experts in Washington or even in Florida, but rather by the South Florida Avocado Administrative Committee, which consists entirely of representatives of the growers and handlers concerned. It appears that the Secretary of Agriculture has invariably adopted the Committee's recommendations for maturity dates, sizes, and weights. Thus the pattern which emerges is one of maturity regulations drafted and administered locally by the growers' own representatives, and designed to do no more than promote orderly competition among the South Florida growers.\n\nOn the other hand, the dissent defends the legitimacy of the AAA scheme:\n\nThe state legislature rubber-stamping the demands of the California avocado industry and the Secretary of Agriculture rubber-stamping the proposals of the Florida avocado industry thus appear to present a pot and kettle in a relative blackness contest. Deutsch concludes by asking a question that was never answered: given the findings of the 1973 remand decision in \"Brooks v. Reagan\" about blatant state protectionism for its domestic avocado industry and that the California 8% oil law \"arbitrarily and unreasonably burdens interstate commerce in Florida avocados by imposing a standard which is irrational as applied to Florida avocados,\" what could the Court say on the appeal of the \"Brooks\" case to justify its 1963 decision?\n\nA June 2016 article in the \"Wall Street Journal\" describes the current state of the Avocado War between Florida and California. J.R. Brooks (now Brooks Tropicals LLC), the successful plaintiff in the remand after the Supreme Court opinion, established the trademark \"SlimCados\" to designate several different Florida avocado varieties that it markets. Brooks promotes the lower fat content of Florida avocados as a desirable diet feature in \"trying to compete with California’s Hass variety, which accounts for 95% of the American avocado market and 80% of global demand.\" However, according to the \"Journal\", \"the oversize SlimCados look like a guacamole lover’s dream,\" because their weight is up to six times that of a Hass, but \"their different taste has left many disappointed, making them the avocado some foodies love to hate.\" The \"Journal\" quotes one detractor of Florida avocados as complaining, \"I’ve never felt so betrayed by a piece of food in my life,” because the Florida \"avocado’s innards were watery, producing a soupy guacamole that lacked the rich, creamy flavor she craved.\"\n\n"}

He appears in \"The Tomb of Dracula\", and is an enemy of Blade. In the comics, Deacon Frost was depicted as a tall, white-haired, late middle-aged gentleman with red eyes, and wearing 1860s Germany period clothing. His doppelgänger sported an accent and attire that suggested a Southern preacher.\n\nThe character appeared in the 1998 film \"Blade\", portrayed by Stephen Dorff.\n\nDeacon Frost first appeared in \"The Tomb of Dracula\" #13 (October 1973), and was created by Marv Wolfman and Gene Colan.\n\nDeacon Frost was allegedly a scientist looking for the key to immortality. For one of his experiments, he kidnapped a young woman in order to inject his victim with the blood of a recently killed vampire. The girl's fiancé broke into the lab, and (in the resulting scuffle) Frost was accidentally injected with the blood himself. The result was that Frost became a vampire but (due to the unusual method of becoming one) he was endowed with a unique characteristic; anyone he turned into a vampire would generate a doppelgänger. He could create an unlimited number of doppelgängers by biting each doppelgänger, and they would all be under his mental control. Frost intended to use this ability to contend for the position of Lord of Vampires, a position that was presently held by Dracula. Frost is the vampire responsible for the death of Blade's mother; Blade's initial mission is to exact revenge against her killer. It was also Frost who turned Hannibal King into a vampire. Blade and King (while initially distrusting each other) eventually teamed up to fight Frost's army of doppelgangers of Blade and King. The two of them managed to defeat and apparently destroy Frost in his underground hideout, stabbing him twice and leaving his body to be consumed as his hideout exploded.\n\nMany years later, Blade encountered a vampire that called itself Deacon Frost. This vampire had a different appearance and personality to the original, and was later identified as being a doppelgänger. The doppelgänger attempted to summon a powerful demon, only to be devoured by said creature. In a later one-shot story set in New Orleans, Frost was encountered yet again, but he appeared as he did in \"The Tomb of Dracula\". He also confirmed that the previous encounter was indeed an imposter (as Blade suspected) who was created using science and magic. Blade and King, with the help of Brother Voodoo, foiled Frost's attempt to gain control of Garwood Industries through Donna Garth (daughter of Simon Garth the Living Zombie). Frost escaped this encounter vowing revenge. More recently, Frost appeared at the summons of Dracula to defend the Lord of Vampires as he underwent a magical ritual, only to be staked by Blade.\n\nWhile roughhousing, two boys enter the parking garage where Frost is located with his latest creation, a monster called the White Worm. Frost sics the White Worm on the children, then flees when he senses the approach of Blade.\n\nThe \"Ultimate\" version of Deacon Frost appears with a youthful appearance. He has been captured by S.H.I.E.L.D. in order to convince Blade to join Nick Fury's Black ops team.\n\n\n\nDeacon Frost appears as the main antagonist on the Blade table in \"Marvel Pinball\".\n"}

Over time, the optical density, color balance, lustre, and other qualities of a print will degrade. The rate at which deterioration occurs depends primarily on two main factors: the print itself, that is, the colorants used to form the image and the medium on which image resides, and the type of environment the print is exposed to.\n\nFor inkjet prints, pigment-based inks last generally longest when used with specific paper types, whereas dye-based inks can be optimal on more types of paper. Ink-jet paper types include swellable paper, porous paper, and cotton rag paper.\n\nThe longevity of images on chromogenic color photographic papers depends on the temperature and relative humidity of the storage environment, and on the total light exposure they receive. Older chromogenic papers undergo more rapid fading compared to modern materials. For example, Fujifilm's \"Crystal Archive\" papers have a quoted longevity of sixty years dark storage. The stability of coupler-incorporated chromogenic prints has steadily increased since their introduction by Kodak in 1942. Very significant advances in stability were made in case of Kodak prints in 1954, 1958, and in the early 1980s. These changes can often be used for the dating of color prints, and can be correlated with manufacturing changes documented in the technical literature.\n\nIn general, black-and-white prints using either silver or carbon-based media may last longer than some colour prints. Some black-and-white prints are produced using ink-jet printers, or colour photographic paper using the RA 4 process.\n\nTo achieve a long lifespan, gelatin silver prints must be thoroughly fixed and washed. Besides rendering the image insensitive to further light exposure, fixer converts undeveloped silver salts in the emulsion into products that can easily be washed away. Effective fixing and washing removes all unexposed silver salts and leaves only a small amount of residual fixer. Any significant quantity of fixer (thiosulphate) left in the print after washing will cause the image to deteriorate over time. Many other factors play a critical role in the long-term stability of gelatin silver prints. The temperature and relative humidity of the storage environment, and the air pollutants to which a silver image is exposed are three of the most important factors.\n\nToning can increase the longevity of silver-based prints by replacing or coating the metallic silver with more inert metals such as gold, silver sulphide or selenium.\n\nImages composed of more inert metals, like platinum, palladium and gold are less prone to decay than those in silver. Amateur Photographer's \"Dictionary of Photography\" said \"Owing to the chemically inert nature of platinum, a print so made is far more permanent than any print having a silver image can be\".\nIndeed, the Victoria and Albert Museum's Conservation Journal states that \"...the majority of the deterioration seen in such prints is usually associated with the supports, which are often yellowed and brittle, rather than the actual image.\"\n\nEnvironmental factors that hasten the deterioration of a print include exposure to heat, ozone and other pollutants, water or humidity, and high levels of light. Though light-induced fade often gets the most publicity, greater than 90 per cent of consumer prints are stored in the dark where the effects of heat, humidity, and/or pollutants can dominate.\n\nMuch research into image permanence has been carried out by Wilhelm Imaging Research, Inc.\n\nSome film companies and printer manufacturers are researching ways to increase the lifetime of their prints. The International Organization for Standardization has developed standards for keeping photographs, defined in ISO 18920.

Her parents, Sorabji Framji Patel and Jaijibai Sorabji Patel, were well known in the city, where her father Sorabji—a lawyer by training and a merchant by profession—was an influential member of the Parsi community.\nShe was invited to hoist the flag over the parliament in Germany.\n\nLike many Parsi girls of the time, Bhikhaiji attended Alexandra Native Girl's English Institution. Bhikhaiji was by all accounts a diligent, disciplined child with a flair for languages.\n\nOn 3 August 1885, she married Rustom Cama, who was the son of K. R. Cama. Her husband was a wealthy, pro-British lawyer who aspired to enter politics. It was not a happy marriage, and Bhikhaiji spent most of her time and energy in philanthropic activities and social work.\n\nIn October 1896, the Mumbai Presidency was hit first by famine, and shortly thereafter by bubonic plague. Bhikhaiji joined one of the many teams working out of Grant Medical College (which would subsequently become Haffkine's plague vaccine research centre), in an effort to provide care for the afflicted, and (later) to inoculate the healthy. Cama subsequently contracted the plague herself but survived. As she was severely weakened, she was sent to Britain for medical care in 1902.\n\nShe was preparing to return to India in 1908 when she came in contact with Shyamji Krishna Varma, who was well known in London's Indian community for fiery nationalist speeches he gave in Hyde Park. Through him, she met Dadabhai Naoroji, then president of the British Committee of the Indian National Congress, and for whom she came to work as private secretary. Together with Naoroji and Singh Rewabhai Rana, Cama supported the founding of Varma's Indian Home Rule Society in February 1905. In London, she was told that her return to India would be prevented unless she would sign a statement promising not to participate in nationalist activities. She refused. That same year Cama relocated to Paris, where—together with S. R. Rana and Munchershah Burjorji Godrej—she co-founded the Paris Indian Society. Together with other notable members of the movement for Indian sovereignty living in exile, Cama wrote, published (in the Netherlands and Switzerland) and distributed revolutionary literature for the movement, including \"Bande Mataram\" (founded in response to the Crown ban on the poem \"Vande Mataram\") and later \"Madan's Talwar\" (in response to the execution of Madan Lal Dhingra). These weeklies were smuggled into India through the French colony of Pondichéry.\n\nOn 22 August 1907, Cama attended the second Socialist Congress at Stuttgart, Germany, where she described the devastating effects of a famine that had struck the Indian subcontinent. In her appeal for human rights, equality and for autonomy from Great Britain, she unfurled what she called the \"Flag of Indian Independence\". It has been speculated that this moment may have been an inspiration to African American writer and intellectual W. E. B. Du Bois in writing his 1928 novel \"Dark Princess\". Cama's flag, a modification of the \"Calcutta Flag\", was co-designed by Cama, and Vinayak Damodar Savarkar, and would later serve as one of the templates from which the current national flag of India was created.\n\nIn 1909, following Madan Lal Dhingra's assassination of William Hutt Curzon Wyllie, an aide to the Secretary of State for India, Scotland Yard arrested several key activists living in Great Britain, among them Vinayak Damodar Savarkar. In 1910, Savarkar was ordered to be returned to India for trial. When the ship Savarkar was being transported on docked in Marseilles harbour, he squeezed out through a porthole window and jumped into the sea. Reaching shore, he expected to find Cama and others who had been told to expect him (who got there late) but ran into the local constabulary instead. Unable to communicate his predicament to the French authorities without Cama's help, he was returned to British custody. The British Government requested Cama's extradition, but the French Government refused to cooperate. In return, the British Government seized Cama's inheritance. Lenin reportedly invited her to reside in the Soviet Union, but she did not accept.\n\nInfluenced by Christabel Pankhurst and the Suffragette movement, Bhikhaiji Cama was vehement in her support for gender equality. Speaking in Cairo, Egypt in 1910, she asked, \"I see here the representatives of only half the population of Egypt. May I ask where is the other half? Sons of Egypt, where are the daughters of Egypt? Where are your mothers and sisters? Your wives and daughters?\" Cama's stance with respect to the vote for women was, however, secondary to her position on Indian independence; in 1920, upon meeting Herabai and Mithan Tata, two Parsi women outspoken on the issue of the right to vote, Cama is said to have sadly shaken her head and observed: \"'Work for Indian's freedom and [i]ndependence. When India is independent women will not only [have] the right to [v]ote, but all other rights.'\"\n\nWith the outbreak of World War I in 1914, France and Britain became allies, and all the members of Paris India Society except Cama and Singh Rewabhai Rana left the country (Cama had been advised by fellow-socialist Jean Longuet to go to Spain with M.P. Tirumal Acharya and Rana were briefly arrested in October 1914 when they tried to agitate among Punjab Regiment troops that had just arrived in Marseilles on their way to the front. They were required to leave Marseilles, and Cama then moved to Rana's wife's house in Arcachon, near Bordeaux. In January 1915, the French government deported Rana and his whole family to the Caribbean island of Martinique, and Cama was sent to Vichy, where she was interned. In bad health, she was released in November 1917 and permitted to return to Bordeaux provided that she report weekly to the local police. Following the war, Cama returned to her home at 25, Rue de Ponthieu in Paris.\n\nCama remained in exile in Europe until 1935, when, gravely ill and paralysed by a stroke that she had suffered earlier that year, she petitioned the British government through Sir Cowasji Jehangir to be allowed to return home. Writing from Paris on 24 June 1935, she acceded to the requirement that she renounce seditionist activities. Accompanied by Jehangir, she arrived in Bombay in November 1935 and died nine months later, aged , at Parsi General Hospital on 13 August 1936.\n\nBikhaiji Cama bequeathed most of her personal assets to the Avabai Petit Orphanage for girls, which established a trust in her name. Rs. 54,000 (1936: £39,300; $157,200) to her family's fire temple, the Framji Nusserwanjee Patel Agiary at Mazgaon, in South Bombay.\n\nSeveral Indian cities have streets and places named after Bhikhaiji Cama, or Madame Cama as she is also known. On 26 January 1962, India's 11th Republic Day, the Indian Posts and Telegraphs Department issued a commemorative stamp in her honour.\n\nIn 1997, the Indian Coast Guard commissioned a Priyadarshini-class fast patrol vessel \"ICGS Bikhaiji Cama\" after Bikhaiji Cama.\n\nThe high rise office complex in the posh location of South Delhi which accommodates big shot companies such as Jindal Group, SAIL, GAIL, EIL etc. are also named as Bhikaji Cama Place. This is a tribute to her.\n\nFollowing Cama's 1907 Stuttgart address, the flag she raised there was smuggled into British India by Indulal Yagnik and is now on display at the Maratha and Kesari Library in Pune. In 2004, politicians of the BJP, India's political party, attempted to identify a later design (from the 1920s) as the flag Cama raised in Stuttgart. The flag Cama raised – misrepresented as \"original national Tricolour\" – has an (Islamic) crescent and a (Hindu) sun, which the later design does not have.\n\n"}

It was generally only a wooden structure, which was placed in a recess or on a tomb.\n\nThe Easter Sepulchre is only found in England and Wales, the practice having been peculiar to the Sarum Rite. However, there is a ruin presumed to be an Easter sepulchre at Kildrummy in north-east Scotland.\n\nThe Easter Sepulchre contained the Blessed Sacrament of the altar, the Host. Following the doctrine of the Real Presence, i.e. that Jesus is physically present within in the Host, on Good Friday the Host was taken from the tabernacle where it had been placed following the Maundy Thursday celebration of the Last Supper and, wrapped in linen cloths, 'buried' in the Easter sepulchre which was found on the north wall of the sanctuary. Cut into the wall, it was sometimes ornately carved but within it was a wooden frame on which was hung a cloth pall often embroidered with scenes from the Passion. Candles were lit around the sepulchre, burial clothes adorned it, and parishioners stood guard until early Easter morning at the first Mass. The Host was brought out, in imitation of Jesus having arisen out of the tomb, and was placed again in the tabernacle in the centre of the Church. Like Roods and their lofts, Easter Sepulchres were the object of iconoclastic fury by the Reformers and few are left.\n\nThere are throughout Great Britain many fine examples in stone, some of which are Decorated Gothic, such as:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWithybrook, Coventry\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2145118", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2145118", "title": "Indian Home Rule movement", "text": "Indian Home Rule movement\n\nThe Indian Home Rule movement was a movement in British India on the lines of Irish Home Rule movement and other home rule movements. The movement lasted around two years between 1916–1918 and is believed to have set the stage for the independence movement under the leadership of Annie Besant and Bal Gangadhar Tilak to the educated English speaking upper class Indians. In 1921 All India Home Rule League changed its name to Swarajya Sabha.\n\nFive red and four green horizontal stripes. On the upper left quadrant was the Union Flag, which signified the Dominion status that the movement sought to achieve. A crescent and a seven-pointed star, both in white, are set in top fly. Seven white stars are arranged as in the Saptarishi constellation (the constellation Ursa Major), which is sacred to Hindus. \n\nIndian home rule movement began in India in the background of World War I. The Government of India Act (1909) failed to satisfy the demands of the national leaders. However, the split in the congress and the absence of leaders like Tilak, who was imprisoned in Mandalay meant that nationalistic response was tepid.\n\nBy 1915, many factors set the stage for a new phase of nationalist movement. The rise in stature of Annie Besant (who was of part Irish origin and a firm supporter of Irish Home Rule Movement), the return of Tilak from exile and the growing calls for solving the split in congress began to stir the political scene in India. The Ghadar Mutiny and its suppression led to an atmosphere of resentment against British rule.\n\nMost Indians and Indian political leaders had been divided in their response to World War I and the Indian soldiers fighting on behalf of the British Empire against Germany, the Austro-Hungarian Empire and the Ottoman Empire. The latter's involvement irked India's Muslims, who saw the Sultan as the Caliph of Islam.\n\nMany Indian revolutionaries opposed the war, while moderates and liberals backed the war. The issue divided India's political classes and left the increasing demand for self-government going nowhere. Besant however declared, \"England's need is India's opportunity\". As editor of the \"New India\" newspaper, she attacked the colonial government of India and called for clear and decisive moves towards self-rule. As with Ireland, the government refused to discuss any changes while the war lasted. This set the stage for the movement.\n\nBetween 1916 and 1918, when the war was beginning, prominent Indians like Joseph Baptista, Muhammad Ali Jinnah, Bal Gangadhar Tilak, G. S. Khaparde, Sir S. Subramania Iyer ,Satendra Nath Bose And the leader of the Theosophical Society, Annie Besant, decided to organise a national alliance of leagues across India, specifically to demand \"Home Rule\", or self-government within the British Empire for all of India. Tilak founded the first home rule league at the Bombay provincial congress at Belgaum in April,1916. then after this Annie Besant founded second league at Adyar Madras in September 1916. While Tilak's league worked in areas like Maharashtra (excluding Bombay city), Karnataka, Central provinces and Berar, Annie Besant's league worked in the rest of India.\n\nThe move created considerable excitement at the time, and attracted many members of the Indian National Congress and the All India Muslim League, who had been allied since the 1916 Lucknow Pact. The leaders of the League gave fiery speeches, and petitions with hundreds of thousands of Indians as signatories were submitted to British authorities. Unification of moderates and radicals as well as unity between Muslim League and Indian National Congress was a remarkable achievement of Annie Besant.\n\nThe government arrested Annie Besant in 1917 and this led to nationwide protests. The movement actually spread out and made its impact in the interior villages of India. Many moderate leaders like Muhammad Ali Jinnah joined the movement. The League spread political awareness in new areas like Sindh, Punjab, Gujarat, United Provinces, Central provinces, Bihar, Orissa and Madras, which all sought an active political movement.\n\nThe pressure of the movement, especially after Annie Besant's arrest, led to the Montague's declaration on 20 August 1917 which stated that \"progressive realization of responsible government in India\" was the policy of the British government.\n\nDuring this time various meetings were held in Nellore, Kurnool, Bellary, Cuddapah, Kakinada, Rajahmundry and Vizagapatnam. In Kurnool a prominent leader, Raja Sir P. V. Madhava Rao of Panyam has supported the home rule league. The speech given by him in a meeting held in kurnool is highlighted here in which he thrashed the British Government saying \"the (bulk of) bureaucracy has failed to understand the needs of the people and the requirements of time\". Later after the completion of meeting's in Madras Presidency many prominent leaders gave support to the league under the leadership of Annie Besant.\n\nThe Movement was also left leaderless once Tilak left for England to pursue a libel case he had filed and Annie Besant was largely satisfied by the promise of Reforms.\n\nIts further growth and activity were stalled by the rise of Mahatma Gandhi and his \"Satyagraha\" art of revolution: non-violent, but mass-based civil disobedience. Gandhi's Hindu lifestyle, mannerisms and immense respect for Indian culture and the common people of India made him immensely popular with India's common people. His victories in leading the farmers of Champaran, Bihar and Kheda, Gujarat against the British authorities on tax revolts made him a national hero.\n\nAfter the Montagu Declaration the league agreed to suspend its expansion of the movement. After this the all moderate candidate gave up the membership of league. The league believed that the British government will gradually reform the administration and local representative system by ushering participation of local Indians.\n\nIn 1920, the All India Home Rule League elected Mahatma Gandhi as its president.\n\n"}

Many activists from the New Current were arrested in the late 1890s, and many emigrated to Western Europe and the United States. The branches of Valters' and Rolavs' group issued polemics in exile, including \"Proletārietis\" (\"The Proletarian,\" a publication printed in Boston in 1902 and 1903 and in Zurich in 1903 and 1904). They were the first to demand full for Latvia and proposed the transformation of the Russian Empire into a federation of autonomous republics. They also advocated the expropriation of the Baltic German estates in a radical land reform.\n\n"}
{"id": "2145128", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2145128", "title": "Treviglio", "text": "Treviglio\n\nTreviglio (, Bergamasque: ) is a town and \"comune\" (i.e. municipality) in the province of Bergamo, in Lombardy, Northern Italy. It lies south of the province capital, in the lower territory called \"Bassa Bergamasca\".\n\nIt's also part of the geographic area named \"Gera d'Adda\", included among the rivers Fosso Bergamasco to the North, Adda to the West and Serio to the East.\n\nWith approximately 30,000 inhabitants, the comune is now the second most populous town in the province.\n\nIt is rarely called \"The tractor town\" for the presence of the SAME Deutz-Fahr headquarters or seldom \"The town of courtyards\" for their preponderant presence in the Old Town.\n\nIt is subdivided in five main quartiers: Old town, West zone, North zone, the recent built East zone and the PIP (Industrial Zone). Northward lie four frazioni (subdivisions): Geromina, Castel Cerreto, Battaglie and Cascina Pezzoli; once the village of Castel Rozzone was also a frazione of Treviglio.\n\nThe coat of arms is composed of a crenellated tower, which represents the city with its Ghibelline past; flanked by two golden lions rampant, for its free and valiant citizenry and topped by an eagle, symbol of the privileges obtained by the Holy Roman Empire, which is holding a pig aloft, symbol of the achieved prosperity.\n\nThe area where Treviglio lies was firstly inhabited by Celtic tribes, in particular Insubres.\n\nDuring the conquest of the Cisalpine Gaul (\"Gallia Cisalpina\") by the Romans a castrum was built to guard an important trading crossway and the near villages.\n\nAfterward a Roman settlement was founded and grew through trade and local goods manufacture.\n\nAfter the arrival of the Lombards the territory was included in the Fara Gera d'Adda (Fara which was an administrative division of the Lombard system) and, after the fall of the Kingdom of the Lombards it became part of the Holy Roman Empire.\n\nTreviglio was founded in the Early Middle Ages as a fortified town, unifying three preexisting settlements: Cusarola (Celtic), Pisignano (Roman) and Portoli (Lombard). Thus the original town was divided into three districts, called 'portae' (Latin for \"gates\"), each headed toward one of the settlements: \"Porta Torre\" to the village of Cusarola; \"Porta Zeduro\" (named originally \"Zelute\") to Portoli and \"Porta Filagno\" to that of Pisignano.\n\nThe first official document found citing the new town dates back to November 964 D.C.\n\nAround the year 1000 Treviglio harbored the inhabitants of Oriano, a commune near Brescia, which had been destroyed in the course of the struggle between Arduin of Ivrea and Henry II who were warring for the Imperial crown.\nDuring the wars that had taken place in Northern Italy the city of Treviglio grew harboring refugees in the new fourth district of \"Porta Nova\", originally called \" Porta Oriano\".\n\nThe Rozzoni family, at that time powerful, tried in vain a coup d'état, and was as a consequence temporarily exiled in its property near Treviglio, \"Castel Rozzone\" (in Italian \"Rozzoni's Castle\") that nowadays is a village independent from the city itself.\n\nIn 1167 Treviglio joined the first Lombard League, which had the aim of preserving local jurisdiction and droit de régale, a purpose that was achieved with the victory over emperor Frederick I 'Barbarossa', at the Battle of Legnano. Treviglio sent soldiers to help the League winning the decisive battle.↵The Statute, a copy of which dated 1392 is currently housed in the city's museum, describes a government held by sixty Consuls- initially twenty each for everyone of the original ethnic communities, thereafter fifteen for each district - these remaining in office for six months. The leading member of the Council and chief of Treviglio was the Chancellor (\"Cancelliere\")\",\" similar to an actual mayor. This statute also required that no noble could be allowed to live within the city walls - and therefore to be elected Consul - so as to prevent their possible involvements in the power strifes of the town and the town involvement in their struggles for power.\n\nIn 1395 Treviglio gained formal autonomy from the Empire, which it held as a \"Separate Land of the Duchy of Milan\", excepting several brief Venetian occupations (1431-1433; 1448–1453 and 1499–1509). These occupations are mentioned in The Betrothed, a renowned Italian novel by Alessandro Manzoni. At the last withdrawal in 1509, the city was burnt down by the departing Venetian troops.\nThe French king Louis XII who witnessed the event, claimed to vindicate it in the subsequent Battle of Agnadello.\n\nOn 28 February 1522 General Odet de Foix Viscount of Lautrec, leading the French army through Northern Italy on its way to the South, came to punish the town for the insolence shown by denying supplies to the French troops and resisting them. The chronicles tell of the general refusing the surrender of the city and the appeals of mercy of the parish priest and of the Duke of Milan himself; therefore - so the story - the inhabitants took refuge in the churches and, when the French troops entered the town, a fresco of Our Lady in front of which the inhabitants were praying, appeared to weep. \nWarned of this portentous event, the General did check the building and its walls to verify the veracity of the miracle and, finally persuaded, deposed helmet and sword at the feet of the fresco and left the city. Helmet and sword are still preserved in the Sanctuary, built with donations of the Treviglio's families only, and in which was transferred the miraculous fresco over which were added, crowns forged with the jewels of the virgins of Treviglio. This episode is celebrated every year with a re-enactment, an historical parade and a novena (nine days of prayers). A popular song about the event is still famous in the town.\n\nAfter many long years of war, the French sold Treviglio to the Spaniards, albeit the town was formally still under the aegis of the Holy Roman Empire.\n\nDuring this last domination the town as well as the whole region, knew an initial period of prosperity followed by a gradual decline, aggravated in the 17th century by an epidemic of plague.\nThe Spanish period ended transforming Treviglio in fief and auctioning it off to meet the debts of the Duchy [ of Milan ], but the town people fiercely opposed the measure and, after losing a lawsuit against the Senate of Milan, self-taxed themselves to reclaim the fief and its independence.\n\nAfter the French Revolution in 1796, Treviglio became part of the Transpadane Republic, the following year of the Cisalpine Republic and, in 1805, of the Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy. It was during these years that many of the religious buildings were looted and a detailed official map of the town was drawn.\n\nThe local dialect - like almost everywhere in Lombardy - preserves words and sounds, reminiscent of the frequent French occupations\n\nAfter the Congress of Vienna the town was included in the Kingdom of Lombardy–Venetia, then temporarily attached to the Kingdom of Sardinia during the first Italian War of Independence and, finally, the town joined the Kingdom of Italy in 1860.\n\nOn 17 December 1915 Benito Mussolini married in civil union Rachele Guidi in Treviglio, after the future Duce had recovered in the local hospital.\n\nWith a Presidential Decree of January 8, 1960, Treviglio was declared a City, as promised by King Victor Emanuel II in 1860, due to its historical involvement in the achievement of the Italian Independence.\n\nSurvived family names dating back to Treviglio are Bornaghi, Facchetti, Butinone (and variants), Carioli, Gatti (and variants), Manenti and Rozzoni.\n\nOthers, like Aresi, Cortesi, Conti, Colombo, Merisi and Monzio Compagnoni; are very widespread, but originate from neighboring villages or others places. For instance, Merisi is from Caravaggio and Aresi from Brignano Gera d'Adda.\n\nThe old city is composed primarily by courtyards tenements, most of them open to the public twice a year.\nMany are also the sacred shrines, real places of worship boasting ancient traditions. On festive occasions the bell tower and the town squares are decorated with projections of images and animations.\n\nAgriculture and trade were prominent in the economy of Treviglio from its beginning to today and, until the 20th century, there was a flourishing craft sector producing furniture and silk; then the swift industrial development and the relocation of that production made way to the mechanical (in particular the SDF, Bianchi bicycles), electrical and chemical industries which are still active.\n\nThe flow of the necessary capital for the establishment of new local enterprises, promoted the growth of the local bank, BCC (Credit Union) and of insurances agencies.\n\nDuring the economic crisis many local enterprises were forced to close or were acquired by larger companies and their production transferred to Eastern Europe or Asia. The local bank undertook an expansion effort that weakened it and the local government focused on the development of services, tourism and trade.\n\nThe town attracts people from the surrounding villages with its services, while the Old Town boasts artisan food shops, cafes and fashion shops which are very appreciated.\n\nTreviglio has a central library, located in an adapted cloister, and four peripheral ones with more than 75,000 items, of which 10,000 are antique books, the library system is integrated in the \"Sistema Bibliotecario Integrato della Bassa Pianura Bergamasca\" (in English: Integrated Library System of the Lower Bergamo Plain) that group in its management thirty-one municipalities; from 2010 there is also available a free media library.\n\nThe town hosts two historical museum, two picture gallery, one scientific museum and two tiny natural protected areas.\n\nAll cultural activities are led by several historical and scientific associations.\n\nThere are two local newspapers, \"Il popolo cattolico\" (Catholic people) and \"Il Giornale di Treviglio\" (Treviglio's Journal).\n\nThere are at least three linguistic centers; seven kindergartens (both public and private); ten elementary schools (both public and private); four junior high schools (both public and private) and thirteen senior high schools (both public and private), including lyceums and technical schools, offering 23 different courses of study.\n\nTreviglio has a public sport center and a public pool; a tennis center, several fields for soccer, basketball and volleyball and gyms (both public and private).\nThe town is represented in many disciplines, among those football, basketball, volleyball, athletics and rugby; with remarkable achievements in the regional context and beyond.\nThere are also schools of mountain climbing, cycling, BMX, motorcycle, equitation, diving, water polo, swimming, pilates, martial arts, artistic gymnastics and modern and classic dance.\n\n\n\n\n\nTreviglio was among the first Italian cities featuring a railway station, in service between the late 1850s and 1878.\n\nToday the town has two railway stations. The Treviglio Central Station (known as \"Treviglio Centrale\") is on the Milan–Venice line, the Treviglio-Cremona and the Treviglio–Bergamo line; on this last lies also the West Station.\n\nFrom 2009, the Central Station is also terminus for the lines S5 and S6 of the suburban train service of Milan.\n\nThe city can be reached by car with State Roads N.11 (Milano-Brescia) and N.42 (from Bergamo, to Lodi and Crema); directly with the highway A35 (called BreBeMi, initials of the main cities connected through it: Brescia, Bergamo and Milan) and also the Provincial Roads 128, 129, 136, 141, 142 and State Road 472 which links Treviglio with the city of Lodi.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It may loosely be thought of as a generalization of the gravitational potential of Newtonian gravitation. The metric captures all the geometric and causal structure of spacetime, being used to define notions such as time, distance, volume, curvature, angle, and separation of the future and the past.\n\nThroughout this article we work with a metric signature that is mostly positive (); see sign convention. The gravitation constant formula_1 will be kept explicit. This article employs Einstein summation convention, where repeated indices are automatically summed over.\n\nMathematically, spacetime is represented by a four-dimensional differentiable manifold formula_2 and the metric tensor is given as a covariant, second-degree, symmetric tensor on formula_2, conventionally denoted by formula_4. Moreover, the metric is required to be nondegenerate with signature . A manifold formula_2 equipped with such a metric is a type of Lorentzian manifold.\n\nExplicitly, the metric tensor is a symmetric bilinear form on each tangent space of formula_2 that varies in a smooth (or differentiable) manner from point to point. Given two tangent vectors formula_7 and formula_8 at a point formula_9 in formula_2, the metric can be evaluated on formula_7 and formula_8 to give a real number:\nThis is a generalization of the dot product of ordinary Euclidean space. Unlike Euclidean space – where the dot product is positive definite – the metric is indefinite and gives each tangent space the structure of Minkowski space.\n\nPhysicists usually work in local coordinates (i.e. coordinates defined on some local patch of formula_2). In local coordinates formula_15 (where formula_16 is an index that runs from 0 to 3) the metric can be written in the form\nThe factors formula_18 are one-form gradients of the scalar coordinate fields formula_15. The metric is thus a linear combination of tensor products of one-form gradients of coordinates. The coefficients formula_20 are a set of 16 real-valued functions (since the tensor formula_4 is a \"tensor field\", which is defined at all points of a spacetime manifold). In order for the metric to be symmetric we must have\ngiving 10 independent coefficients.\n\nIf the local coordinates are specified, or understood from context, the metric can be written as a symmetric matrix with entries formula_20. The nondegeneracy of formula_24 means that this matrix is non-singular (i.e. has non-vanishing determinant), while the Lorentzian signature of formula_4 implies that the matrix has one negative and three positive eigenvalues. Note that physicists often refer to this matrix or the coordinates formula_20 themselves as the metric (see, however, abstract index notation).\n\nWith the quantities formula_18 being regarded as the components of an infinitesimal coordinate displacement four-vector (not to be confused with the one-forms of the same notation above), the metric determines the invariant square of an infinitesimal line element, often referred to as an \"interval\". The interval is often denoted\n\nThe interval formula_29 imparts information about the causal structure of spacetime. When formula_30, the interval is timelike and the square root of the absolute value of formula_29 is an incremental proper time. Only timelike intervals can be physically traversed by a massive object. When formula_32, the interval is lightlike, and can only be traversed by light. When formula_33, the interval is spacelike and the square root of formula_29 acts as an incremental proper length. Spacelike intervals cannot be traversed, since they connect events that are outside each other's light cones. Events can be causally related only if they are within each other's light cones.\n\nThe components of the metric depend on the choice of local coordinate system. Under a change of coordinates formula_35, the metric components transform as\n\nThe simplest example of a Lorentzian manifold is flat spacetime, which can be given as R with coordinates formula_37 and the metric\nNote that these coordinates actually cover all of R. The flat space metric (or Minkowski metric) is often denoted by the symbol \"η\" and is the metric used in special relativity. In the above coordinates, the matrix representation of \"η\" is\n\nIn spherical coordinates formula_43, the flat space metric takes the form\nwhere\nis the standard metric on the 2-sphere.\n\nThe Schwarzschild metric describes an uncharged, non-rotating black hole. There are also metrics that describe rotating and charged metrics for black holes.\n\nBesides the flat space metric the most important metric in general relativity is the Schwarzschild metric which can be given in one set of local coordinates by \nwhere, again, formula_47 is the standard metric on the 2-sphere. Here, formula_1 is the gravitation constant and formula_2 is a constant with the dimensions of mass. Its derivation can be found here. The Schwarzschild metric approaches the Minkowski metric as formula_2 approaches zero (except at the origin where it is undefined). Similarly, when formula_51 goes to infinity, the Schwarzschild metric approaches the Minkowski metric.\n\nWith coordinates\nwe can write the metric as\n\nSeveral other systems of coordinates have been devised for the Schwarzschild metric: Eddington–Finkelstein coordinates, Gullstrand–Painlevé coordinates, Kruskal–Szekeres coordinates, and Lemaître coordinates.\n\nThe Schwarzschild solution supposes an object that is not rotating in space and is not charged. To account for charge, the metric must satisfy the Einstein Field equations like before, as well as Maxwell's equations in a curved spacetime. A charged, non-rotating mass is described by the Reissner–Nordström metric. \n\nRotating black holes are described by the Kerr metric and the Kerr–Newman metric.\n\nOther notable metrics are:\n\n\nSome of them are without the event horizon or can be without the gravitational singularity.\n\nThe metric \"g\" induces a natural volume form (up to a sign), which can be used to integrate over a region of a manifold. Given local coordinates formula_15 for the manifold, the volume form can be written\nwhere formula_56 is the determinant of the matrix of components of the metric tensor for the given coordinate system.\n\nThe metric formula_4 completely determines the curvature of spacetime. According to the fundamental theorem of Riemannian geometry, there is a unique connection ∇ on any semi-Riemannian manifold that is compatible with the metric and torsion-free. This connection is called the Levi-Civita connection. The Christoffel symbols of this connection are given in terms of partial derivatives of the metric in local coordinates formula_15 by the formula\n(where commas indicate partial derivatives). \n\nThe curvature of spacetime is then given by the Riemann curvature tensor which is defined in terms of the Levi-Civita connection ∇. In local coordinates this tensor is given by:\n\nThe curvature is then expressible purely in terms of the metric formula_4 and its derivatives.\n\nOne of the core ideas of general relativity is that the metric (and the associated geometry of spacetime) is determined by the matter and energy content of spacetime. Einstein's field equations:\nwhere the Ricci curvature tensor\nand the scalar curvature\nrelate the metric (and the associated curvature tensors) to the stress–energy tensor formula_65. This tensor equation is a complicated set of nonlinear partial differential equations for the metric components. Exact solutions of Einstein's field equations are very difficult to find.\n\n\n"}

C is said to be associative if there holds a \"multiproduct axiom\" in relation to this operator.\n\nAny multicategory, symmetric \"or\" non-symmetric, together with a total-ordering of the object set, can be made into an equivalent comcategory.\n\nA \"multiorder\" is a comcategory satisfying the following conditions.\n\n\nMultiorders are a generalization of partial orders (posets), and were first introduced (in passing) by Tom Leinster.\n\nThere is a multicategory whose objects are (small) sets, where a morphism from the sets \"X\", \"X\", ..., and \"X\" to the set \"Y\" is an \"n\"-ary function,\nthat is a function from the Cartesian product \"X\" × \"X\" × ... × \"X\" to \"Y\".\n\nThere is a multicategory whose objects are vector spaces (over the rational numbers, say), where a morphism from the vector spaces \"X\", \"X\", ..., and \"X\" to the vector space \"Y\" is a multilinear operator, that is a linear transformation from the tensor product \"X\" ⊗ \"X\" ⊗ ... ⊗ \"X\" to \"Y\".\n\nMore generally, given any monoidal category C, there is a multicategory whose objects are objects of C, where a morphism from the C-objects \"X\", \"X\", ..., and \"X\" to the C-object \"Y\" is a C-morphism from the monoidal product of \"X\", \"X\", ..., and \"X\" to \"Y\".\n\nAn operad is a multicategory with one unique object; except in degenerate cases, such a multicategory does not come from a monoidal category.\n\nExamples of multiorders include \"pointed multisets\" , \"integer partitions\" , and \"combinatory separations\" . The triangles (or compositions) of any multiorder are morphisms of a (not necessarily associative) category of \"contractions\" and a comcategory of \"decompositions\". The contraction category for the multiorder of \"multimin partitions\" is the simplest known category of multisets.\n\nMulticategories are often incorrectly considered to belong to higher category theory, as their original application was the observation that the operators and identities satisfied by higher categories are the objects and multiarrows of a multicategory. The study of \"n\"-categories was in turn motivated by applications in algebraic topology and attempts to describe the homotopy theory of higher dimensional manifolds. However it has mostly grown out of this motivation and is now also considered to be part of pure mathematics.\n\nThe correspondence between contractions and decompositions of triangles in a multiorder allows one to construct an associative algebra called its \"incidence algebra\". Any element that is nonzero on all unit arrows has a compositional inverse, and the \"Möbius function\" of a multiorder is defined as the compositional inverse of the zeta function (constant-one) in its incidence algebra.\n\nMulticategories were first introduced under that name by Jim Lambek in \"Deductive systems and categories II\" (1969) He mentions (p. 108) that he was \"told that multicategories have also been studied by [Jean] Benabou and [Pierre] Cartier\", and indeed Leinster opines that \"the idea might have occurred to anyone who knew what both a category and a multilinear map were\".\n"}

The show covered a wide variety of topics ranging from politics, the Global War on Terrorism, local and current affairs, show business, and others, until its cancellation on February 29, 2008. It was a \"call in\" type show where listeners were encouraged to call the show with their opinions. Core has maintained that he is neither a Democrat nor a Republican. The show often featured prominent local and national politicians who frequently called the show unsolicited. Core treated callers with respect regardless of their political stance. His show allowed people on both sides of an issue to express their opinions and allowed listeners to form their own opinions. Core also from time to time kept a caller on the line to discuss the topic at hand with other callers.\n\nCore grew up in the small town of Clinton, Iowa. In 1971 Core graduated from the University of Wisconsin–Madison with a degree in political science and theater and minor in Spanish. Three years later, he began his career at WMAL doing news and sports on the weekends. In 1976, Core replaced Ed Meyer as veteran news talker Bill Trumbull's cohost on the afternoon program \"Two for the Road\". Within a few years the name of the show was changed to \"The Trumbull and Core Show\". Eventually this became \"The Chris Core Show\". Brooke Stevens filled in as co-host following Bill Trumbull's retirement in 1996, prior to leaving the station in 2000. He currently resides in Chevy Chase, Maryland, with his wife, Anne, and his daughter, Tabitha.\n\nOn February 29, 2008, Core was dismissed from WMAL after working for the station for over 33 years, as part of a broad shakeup at the station's parent company, Citadel Broadcasting. Core was dismissed following that day's show, leaving him without the opportunity to say goodbye to his audience. Core expressed hope to one day return to the air on a different station. WMAL host Chris Plante replaced Core in WMAL's morning lineup.\n\nIn 2008, Core was hired as a feature commentator on Washington DC's news radio station WTOP. His commentary, \"Core Values,\" can be heard at 3:40, 6:10, and 8:40 pm. His commentaries can also be downloaded from the radio station's website. He starred in a commentary-style TV show, \"Chris Core Talks\", on D.C.'s local CW station. He also serves as a guest host on XM Radio (Channel 130) \"POTUS\".\n\nCore received the RTNDA Edward R. Murrow Award in 2009, and was named one of three top radio personalities by readers of the \"Washington Times\" in their 2002 Readers' Choice awards; he was recently named one of the Top 100 Talk Show Hosts in the country by \"Talkers Magazine\" for the second year in a row.\n\n"}

It mostly deals with the story of the Sturlungs, a powerful family clan during the Age of the Sturlungs period of the Icelandic Commonwealth.\n\n\"Sturlunga saga\" covers the history of Iceland between 1117 and 1264. It begins with \"Geirmundar þáttr heljarskinns\", the legend of Geirmundr heljarskinn, a regional ruler in late 9th-century Norway, who moves to Iceland to escape the growing power of King Harald Finehair. The more historical sagas commence in 1117 with \"Þorgils saga ok Hafliða\". Other sagas included in the collection are \"Sturlu saga\", \"Prestssaga Guðmundar Arasonar\", \"Guðmundar saga biskups\", \"Hrafns saga Sveinbjarnarsonar\", \"Þórðar saga kakala\", \"Svínfellinga saga\" and \"Íslendinga saga\", composed by Sturla Þórðarson, which constitutes almost half of the compilation and covers the period 1183–1264. The compiler assembled the components in chronological order, added þættir including \"Geirmundar þáttr\" and \"Haukdæla þáttr\" and genealogies, and endeavoured to combine them into a single work, usually replacing the beginning and the ending with a linking passage. In some cases he broke up sagas to achieve chronological order. The compilation is often thought of as constituting a genre of sagas, the \"samtíðarsögur\" or 'contemporary sagas'.\n\n\"Sturlunga saga\" is the main source of Icelandic history during the 12th and 13th centuries and was written by people who experienced the internal power struggle which ended in Iceland's loss of sovereignty and submission to Norway in 1262–64; the descriptions of wounds in \"Íslendinga saga\" are so detailed that they may be based on eyewitness accounts used in compensation claims. It is also indispensable for the details of social history which it contains.

It rises near Bungalow Farm on Cannwood Lane, south-west of Witham Friary, flows north through Blatchbridge to the town of Frome, and continues in a generally northerly direction to join the Bristol Avon at Freshford, below Bradford on Avon.\n\nThe river is approximately in length, comprising 15 km from its source to the confluence with Maiden Bradley Brook, 10 km through Frome to the confluence with the Mells River, and 18 km to the Avon. Below Frome the river passes close to Beckington, Rode, Tellisford, Farleigh Hungerford and Iford Manor.\n\nThe name Frome comes from the Old British word \"ffraw\" meaning fair, fine or brisk and describing the flow of the river. The name was first recorded in 701 when Pope Sergius gave permission to Bishop Aldhelm to found a monastery \"close to the river which is called From\" (Latin: \"juxta fluvium qui vocatur From\").\n\nThere are many weirs on the river. Several stretches, particularly below Farleigh Hungerford, are used for coarse fishing and some trout fishing.\n\nThere are many bridges on the river. In the centre of Frome, the first bridge perhaps appeared in the 14th century. A later 16th-century bridge was widened in the 18th century and buildings were built across it. It remains one of only three bridges in England that have buildings across them; the others are the Pulteney Bridge in Bath and the High Bridge in Lincoln. Other significant bridges include that at Wallbridge in Frome, dated 1634, upstream of the Frome bridge. Downstream are Rode bridge, a turnpike bridge from around 1777; Tellisford bridge, a packhorse bridge probably from the 17th century; Iford bridge, circa 1400; and Freshford bridge, 16th century.\n\nOver the centuries, the river provided power to mills, at first for the grinding of flour. Later, as local industries developed, there were mills for fulling, dyewood grinding (with associated dyehouses) and grist for animal feed or brewing. In the 18th and early 19th century, there were more than 30 mills along the Frome and its tributaries, the Mells and Rodden Brook, from Freshford to four miles south of Frome. Some of the structures can still be seen today: Tellisford, Rode, the upstream mill at Wallbridge, Frome and Blatchbridge. Others have vanished. In Frome a large complex of factory buildings for the woollen industry, with associated workers' cottages in Innox Hill, was established at Spring Gardens by the Sheppard family; these have now disappeared. The Town Mill stood just upstream of Frome bridge; all that is left are linked buildings: a semi-ruinous drying house and buildings for warehousing, dyehouses and storage, most converted to residences. The last textile mill, Tuckers, further downstream at Wallbridge, closed in 1956.\n\nOn 2 May 1932, five boys, one of them on his 10th birthday, were watching floodwater from part of an old mill just upstream from the main bridge in Frome. The old masonry collapsed; the youngest boy, aged 9, was pulled out by friends. A police constable dived in to save the others; the waters took him through the arches of the main bridge but then his cape was caught up by branches and he was pulled out. The next day four bodies were retrieved at Welshmill. The police officer was awarded the King's Police Medal for Bravery for his attempt to save their lives.\n\nIn January 2013, a policeman rescued a man from the river near the Cheese & Grain in the centre of Frome; he pulled the unconscious man from the freezing water and up the steep banks to save his life. The constable was awarded a Royal Humane Society Bravery Award.\n\nIn May 2016, the director of Cross Keys Farm Ltd, Frome, pleaded guilty to causing an unpermitted water discharge into the River Frome. The farm released slurry which killed at least 1,700 fish in the river, and caused considerable damage to its ecosystem. The stretch of river immediately downstream from the farm was a popular swimming, fishing, and canoeing site; these activities were ceased under health concerns. In order to protect the ecosystem, hydrogen peroxide was sprayed into the river to restore oxygen levels for fish, animal, and plant life. The director of the farm was fined more than £22,000.\n\n"}

Ganassa is mentioned numerous times by Lope de Vega, who may have based his comic servant \"gracioso\" on Commedia dell'arte types.

Ganassa recognized what a burden this would be and donated to the city of Madrid to create a theatre known as \"Corral de la Pacheca\", which is the first ever permanent theatre in Madrid. Ganassa guaranteed himself tenancy in this theatre by a 9–10-year lease from its owner, Isabel Pacheco, by persuading the \"Cofrades.\" Ganassa also donated again to the Cofrades in 1582 to help build the second permanent theatre space of Madrid, the \"Corral del Príncipe.\"\n\nNotes\nSources\n\n"}

The two branches meet in Miserden Park, just south of Caudle Green and Syde. The Frome continues to meander its way south to Sapperton, then west to Brimscombe where it turns northwest towards Stroud. The river flows through Stroud, past the Frome Banks nature reserve, then through Ebley and Stonehouse where it goes under the M5 motorway, and past Saul to enter the River Severn at Upper Framilode.\n\nAt Caudle Green the eastern side of the valley rises to the North Sea/Atlantic watershed, approximately one mile to the east. The Frome basin shares a length of this watershed feeding into the River Thames to the east (via the River Churn) and the Severn to the West (via the Frome).\nBelow Sapperton the Frome runs adjacent to the Thames and Severn Canal which is now disused, although undergoing restoration. This joins the Stroudwater Navigation (Stroudwater Canal) at Wallbridge. The Stroudwater Navigation is fed by the Slad Brook and the Painswick stream. Changes to water drainage to reduce flooding, carried out by the Severn River Board in 1957 and 1958, resulted in the Randwick brook (the Ozlebrook) discharging into the canal route instead of passing under it by way of a siphon beneath Foundry Lock. The Stroudwater Navigation runs parallel to the Frome for most of its length westwards from Stroud, and was an important and essential part of Stroud's growth as a town. At one time there was an access route for craft to enter the Frome in Dudbridge meadows, and to reach Kimmins Mill.\n\nThe canal was a thriving thoroughfare for trade, putting Stroud on the map during the industrial revolution. At Stonehouse the river was part of a novel, ill-fated, scheme by John Kemmett and others, in the 1760s, to create a canal without locks. Goods would be carried on boats in containers, each capable of holding about one ton, and the containers would be transferred from one level to the next by cranes erected wherever there was a mill weir. The scheme proved to be too costly, and was abandoned after about of river had been improved.\n\nThe valley from Chalford to Stroud, known as the Golden Valley, is one of the Stroud Five Valleys; it carries the railway line and the Thames and Severn Canal to the Sapperton Tunnels under the Cotswolds. The Sapperton Valley nature reserve is one of several in the area.\n\n"}

It lies halfway between the town of Clifden and the city of Galway. Irish is the predominant spoken language. The District Electoral Division of Turlough, Rosmuc, state that Rosmuc is the most strongly Irish-speaking area in the country. The townland of Rosmuck is part of the civil parish of Kilcummin.\n\nIt is estimated that people first settled in Rosmuc in AD 400, one hundred years before Naomh Briocán (Saint Briocán) brought Christianity to the area.\n\nIt is believed that the name 'Ros Muc' comes from the old Irish \"the peninsula of rounded hills\", \"ros\" meaning \"promontory | headland\" and \"muc\" meaning \"rounded hills\" or \"pig\" as in the rounded hills on the horizon surrounding the district look like the rounded backs of farm animals. The Irish word for peninsula is leithinis and seems to have a slightly different connotation than the meaning of ros.\n\nThe population of Rosmuc is estimated to be around four hundred fifty people. For the past thirty years there has been a decline in the population, this is mainly due to emigration, although the tide of emigration has subsided in recent years due to the robust nature of the Irish economy.\n\nThere are 557 people living in the Ros Muc ED and 87% are native Irish speakers. According to an analysis of the census a total of 91.9% of adults over nineteen years old said they spoke Irish on a daily basis.\n\nThe area has many literary figures, notably Irish revolutionary and education/language activist Patrick Pearse (Pádraig Mac Piarais) | (An Ṗiarsaċ) who had a summer residence there in the early 1900s (now a National Monument/Heritage Site open to the public), and who set many of his short stories in the area. Another writer was the prolific Pádraic Ó Conaire, who wrote 26 books, 473 stories, 237 essays and 6 plays partly set in the region, including \"M'asal Beag Dubh\" (\"My Little Black Donkey\") and the novella \"Deoraíocht\" (\"Exile\"). The area is recognised as one of the strongest remaining Gaeltacht areas in South Connemara.\n\nPádraig Pearse, who was involved in the 1916 revolution in Dublin had a cottage in Rosmuc where he wrote many of his pieces. It was in Rosmuc that he wrote the oration given at the grave of Ó Donnabháin Rosa (O'Donovan Rossa) in 1915, which included the immortal words \" ... but, the fools, the fools, the fools! — They have left us our Fenian dead, and while Ireland holds these graves, Ireland unfree shall never be at peace.\"\n\nRosmuc has had a long term relationship with \"Coláiste na bhFiann\" as it provides host accommodation for students learning Irish during the summer months.\n\nAn association football team is based in Rosmuc, called Cumann Sacar Naomh Briocain (affiliated with the FAI and playing in the Galway district league) Naomh Briocain also has players from neighbouring parishes, most notably Cill Chairain, Carna and Letir Mor.\nThe youth teams up to minors are called \"Carna Caiseal Na Piarsaigh\". It has a mixture of players from Rosmuc, Camus,Kilkerrin and Carna. Their under 12s team won the double in 2015 and their league and reaching the final of the other one only to lose out to An Spidéal.\n\nRosmuc along with its neighbours Camus and An Sraith Salach have a GAA Football between them called \"Na Piarsaigh\".\n\nThe village is the birthplace of a former president of the Gaelic League, Proinsias Mac Aonghusa.\n\nGleann Chatha, An Gort Mór, Inbhear, Turlach, Ros Dubh, An Tamhnaigh Bhig, Snámh Bó, Cill Bhriocáin, An Aill Bhuí, An tOileán Mór, An Turlach Beag, Salalaoi, An Baile Thair, An Siléar, Inis Eilte, An Cladhnach, Cladach ó Dheas, Gairfean, Ros Cíde, Doire Iorrais\n\nThe area has a traditional Sean-nós Irish dancing festival the first weekend following St. Brigid's Day (1 February), Rosmuc's traditional first day of spring.\n\nRosmuc's most famous and historic landmark is Pearse's Cottage, which attracts up to ten thousand visitors each year. It was April 1903 when P.H. Pearse (Irish: \"Pádraig Mac Piarais\") first came to Rosmuc as an examiner for Conradh na Gaeilge. Rosmuc and its people made an impression on him, and he decided to build a holiday home there. He bought a site from Jeanín Mhichíl Grealish - a spot with views of Loch Eiliúrach. Máirtín Labhráis Nee and Tom Labhráis Nee built a two-bed roomed-thatched cottage for him. Bartley Mannion did the carpentry work on the cottage. \n\nOther former residents include:\n\n\n"}

Highlife music, often fused with reggae, gained a wider audience in Europe and North America at this time. During the late 1970s-early 1980s, there was a massive exodus of Ghanaians such as Seidu Mohammed to foreign lands. One of the countries that attracted Ghanaians was Germany, with many making the cities of Berlin, Düsseldorf and Hamburg their second home. Burger-Highlife was born when Ghanaian musicians in Germany started collaborating with German musicians and producers. They created a crossover music style from highlife, disco and funk music.\n\nThis creation of a cross-cultural fertilization between two nations and two different cultures bears all the significant hallmarks of co-operation. People from different cultural backgrounds came together, exchanged thoughts, ideas and hopes and by doing so, they created something new and exciting that had an instant appeal and a lasting impact on Ghana and the Ghanaian and other communities worldwide.

{"id": "2145250", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2145250", "title": "The Man That Got Away", "text": "The Man That Got Away\n\n\"The Man that Got Away\" is a torch song, published in 1953 and written for the 1954 version of the film \"A Star Is Born.\" The music was written by Harold Arlen, and the lyrics by Ira Gershwin. In 1955, it was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Song. In 2004, Judy Garland's performance of the song was selected by the American Film Institute as the eleventh greatest song in American cinema history.\n\n\"The Man That Got Away\" was one of several songs composed by Harold Arlen and Ira Gershwin for the 1954 film \"A Star is Born\" a vehicle for Judy Garland whom Arlen had already provided with the career-defining songs \"Over the Rainbow\" and \"That Old Black Magic\". Arlen and Gershwin would collaborate on songs for \"A Star is Born\" afternoons at Gershwin's Beverly Hills mansion, Arlen being seated at a Steinway while Gershwin would work on the lyrics seated at a card table. \"The Man That Got Away\" was written in response to screenwriter Moss Hart's request for a \"dive song\". Ira Gershwin's wife Leonore overheard the melody Arlen was working on and opined that it sounded as if it could have been written by Gershwin's deceased collaborator and brother George Gershwin: not wanting to be an ersatz George Gershwin, Arlen swiftly began playing a melody he'd written several years previous for a song which had evidently either never been completed or left unpublished as its lyricist Johnny Mercer had penned forgettable lyrics for it. (To whit: \"I've seen Sequoia, it's really very pretty, the art of Goya, and Rockefeller City, but since I saw you, I can't believe my eyes.\" The Gershwin Collection at the Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center at the University of Texas at Austin contains a typescript draft of the lyrics with Ira Gershwin's handwritten changes.) Ira Gershwin was arrested by the melody, and came up with the title \"The Man That Got Away\" as a paraphrase of the [fisherman's boast] 'You should have seen the one that got away'\" after which the composition of the song proved arduous, with hours passing before Gershwin had the opening stanza.\n\nIra Gershwin had not wanted any of the songs he and Arlen wrote for the film to be \"leaked\" prior to the score being finished and made Arlen promise to respect this, a request Gershwin reiterated when Arlen mentioned he'd be visiting Palm Springs, where Judy Garland - along with her husband Sid Luft producer of \"A Star is Born\" - would be at that time. While accompanying Garland and Sid Luft as they played their way around a Palm Springs golf course, Arlen began whistling the melody of \"The Man That Got Away\": Garland soon guessed the tune's provenance and insisted that the three of them retire to the clubhouse, where there was a piano for Arlen to play the song properly for Garland and Luft who resultantly (in Arlen's words) \"went wild with joy.\"\n\nJudy Garland recorded \"The Man That Got Away\" with the Warner Bros. orchestra under the direction of Ray Heindorf using an arrangement by Skip Martin. Garland's performance of the song in \"A Star is Born\" is unusual for being filmed in one continuous shot. In the finished take, Garland (as Esther Blodgett) performs the song in a nightclub during a musicians-only session after closing time. The chairs are up on the tables for floor cleaning, the air is filled with cigarette smoke, and Garland's character, without an audience other than her musician friends, is encouraged by the pianist to rise from her seat on the piano bench and \"take it from the top.\"\n\n\"The Man That Got Away\" is arguably the most important single musical sequence in the entire film. As one of the first segments filmed for the movie, it was photographed in three different costumes on three different occasions, in over forty different partial or complete takes. Judy Garland recorded the song on September 3, 1953, and the number was first filmed on Wednesday, October 21, 1953.\n\nDue to technical limitations of the medium at the time, the cameraman could not give director George Cukor what he wanted: \"low light levels, the impressionistic feeling of the musical instruments, Garland moving in and out of pools of light,\" so he was fired. Cukor realized later that the film stock itself was the problem, not the cinematographer, and re-employed him in a number of other films later on.\n\nChanges were then made to the costume and set and the number was filmed a second time the following Thursday, October 29. Art director Gene Allen said, \"The first time it looked as if we had painted a set to look like a bar. So to give it a slightly impressionistic look I...put a scrim between the musicians and the back bar. If you look very carefully at that scene you can see the scrim nailed down on the floor...\"\n\nAccording to sound man Earl Bellamy: \"When Judy sang to playback, you could never hear anything...She wanted me to start off at a full blast and then she topped that...her huge voice carrying out over the rafters. You could hear Judy clear as a bell, and she sang right with it...\"\n\nGarland did 27 takes of the number over three days, both partial and complete, but according to Allen, \"Cukor had her doing all sorts of different bits of business before the song. All of that action didn't really fit the song though — it was just too busy. Plus, she didn't look good — her costume was wrinkled, and didn't fit right...\" If that weren't enough, the color was too brown for her complexion as well.\n\nFour months later it was filmed for a third time in February 1954, with new hairstyle and costume and a totally brand new set. Cukor felt this time they had finally got it right: \"I think we've generated a lot of sex...She looks perfectly charming in a new Jean-Louis dress, and I know that this too is an enormous improvement over the way we first did it — it has fun and spirit.\"\n\nMain principal photography for the film began in earnest around the first week of February, 1954. Ten days later, the number was filmed in Technicolor and CinemaScope. As a result of the fabulous color renditions and faithful representations of the sweeping views, Jack L. Warner and Producer Sid Luft agreed to scrap nearly two weeks of footage to date and began the film again. The original takes are added as a special feature on the currently available DVD.\n\nGarland later sang this song as a regular part of her concert repertoire for the rest of her career as well as on the \"Sammy Davis Jr. Show\" in 1966.\n\nIn November 2019, Universal Records issued a new Dance/Club version of the song, which was remixed by Eric Kupper and as such, both Garland and Kupper received billing on the single. The track also gave Garland her first posthumous appearance on \"Billboard's\" Dance Club Songs Chart with the highest debut (at number 41) in its November 9, 2019 issue.\n\n"}
{"id": "2145251", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2145251", "title": "Shell money", "text": "Shell money\n\nShell money is a medium of exchange similar to coin money and other forms of commodity money, and was once commonly used in many parts of the world. Shell money usually consisted of whole or partial sea shells, often worked into beads or otherwise shaped. The use of shells in trade began as direct commodity exchange, the shells having value as body ornamentation. The distinction between beads as commodities and beads as money has been the subject of debate among economic anthropologists.\n\nShell money has appeared in the Americas, Asia, Africa and Australia. The most familiar form may be the wampum created by the Indigenous peoples of the East Coast of North America, ground beads cut from the purple part of marine bivalve shells. The shell most widely used worldwide as currency was the shell of \"Cypraea moneta\", the money cowry. This species is most abundant in the Indian Ocean, and was collected in the Maldive Islands, in Sri Lanka, along the Malabar coast, in Borneo and on other East Indian islands, and in various parts of the African coast from Ras Hafun to Mozambique. Cowry shell money was an important part of the trade networks of Africa, South Asia, and East Asia.\n\nOn the east coast of North America, Indigenous peoples of the Iroquois Confederacy and Algonquian tribes, such as the Shinnecock tribe, ground beads called wampum, which were cut from the purple part of the shell of the marine bivalve \"Mercenaria mercenaria\", more commonly known as the hard clam or quahog. White beads were cut from the white part of the quahog or whelk shells. Iroquois peoples strung these shells on string in lengths, or wove them in belts.\n\nThe shell most valued by the Native American tribes of the Pacific Coast from Alaska to northwest California was \"\"Dentalium\"\", one of several species of tusk shell or scaphopod. The tusk shell is naturally open at both ends, and can easily be strung on a thread. This shell money was valued by its length rather than the exact number of shells; the \"ligua\", the highest denomination in their currency, was a length of about 6 inches.\n\nFarther south, in central California and southern California, the shell of the olive snail \"Olivella biplicata\" was used to make beads for at least 9,000 years. The small numbers recovered in older archaeological site components suggest that they were initially used as ornamentation, rather than as money. Beginning shortly before 1,000 years ago, Chumash specialists on the islands of California's Santa Barbara Channel began chipping beads from olive shells in such quantities that they left meter-deep piles of manufacturing residue in their wake; the resulting circular beads were used as money throughout the area that is now southern California. Starting at about AD 1500, and continuing into the late nineteenth century, the Coast Miwok, Ohlone, Patwin, Pomo, and Wappo peoples of central California used the marine bivalve \"Saxidomus\" sp. to make shell money.\n\nIn western Africa, shell money was usual legal tender up until the mid 19th century. Before the abolition of the slave trade, large shipments of cowry shells were sent to some of the English ports for reshipment to the slave coast.\n\nThe shells of \"Olivella nana\", the sparkling dwarf olive sea snail were harvested on Luanda Island for use as currency in the Kingdom of Kongo. They were even traded north as far as the Kingdom of Benin. In the Kongo they were called \"nzimbu\" or \"zimbo\".\n\nAs the value of the cowry was much greater in West Africa than in the regions from which the supply was obtained, the trade was extremely lucrative. In some cases the gains are said to have been 500%. The use of the cowry currency gradually spread inland in Africa. By about 1850 the German explorer Heinrich Barth found it fairly widespread in Kano, Kuka, Gando, and even Timbuktu. Barth relates that in Muniyoma, one of the ancient divisions of Bornu, the king's revenue was estimated at 30,000,000 shells, with every adult male being required to pay annually 1,000 shells for himself, 1,000 for every pack-ox, and 2,000 for every slave in his possession.\n\nIn the countries on the coast, the shells were fastened together in strings of forty or one-hundred each, so that fifty or twenty strings represented a dollar; but in the interior they were laboriously counted one by one, or, if the traders were expert, five by five. The districts mentioned above received their supply of \"kurdi\", as they were called, from the west coast; but the regions to the north of Unyamwezi, where they were in use under the name of \"simbi\", were dependent on Muslim traders from Zanzibar. The shells were used in the remoter parts of Africa until the early 20th century, but then gave way to modern currencies.\n\nThe shell of the large land snail, \"Achatina monetaria\", cut into circles with an open center was also used as coin in Benguella, Portuguese West Africa.\n\nIn China, cowries were so important that many characters relating to money or trade contain the character for cowry: 貝. Starting over three thousand years ago, cowry shells, or copies of the shells, were used as Chinese currency. The Classical Chinese character for \"money/currency\", 貝, originated as a pictograph of a cowrie shell.\n\nCowries were formerly used as means of exchange in India. In Bengal, where it required 3840 to make a rupee, the annual importation was valued at about 30,000 rupees.\n\nIn Southeast Asia, when the value of the Siamese tical (baht) was about half a troy ounce of silver (about 16 grams), the value of the cowrie ( \"bia\") was fixed at Baht. In modern Thailand, it refers to interest paid for the use of money borrowed or deposited; \"bia wat\" is a military pension.\n\nIn Orissa, India, cowry (popularly known as \"kaudi\") was used as currency until 1805 when it was abolished by the British East India Company. This was one of the causes of the Paik Rebellion in 1817.\n\nIn northern Australia, different shells were used by different tribes, one tribe's shell often being quite worthless in the eyes of another tribe. \n\nIn the islands north of New Guinea the shells were broken into flakes. Holes were bored through these flakes, which were then valued by the length of a threaded set on a string, as measured using the finger joints. Two shells are used by these Pacific islanders, one a cowry found on the New Guinea coast, and the other the common pearl shell, broken into flakes.\n\nIn the South Pacific Islands the species \"Oliva carneola\" was commonly used to create shell money. As late as 1882, local trade in the Solomon Islands was carried on by means of a coinage of shell beads, small shells laboriously ground down to the required size by the women. No more than were actually needed were made, and as the process was difficult, the value of the coinage was satisfactorily maintained.\n\nAlthough rapidly being replaced by modern coinage, the cowry shell currency is still in use to some extent in the Solomon Islands. The shells are worked into strips of decorated cloth whose value reflects the time spent creating them. \n\nOn the Papua New Guinea island of East New Britain, shell currency is still considered legal currency and can be exchanged for the Papua New Guinean kina.\n\nIn parts of West Asia, \"Cypraea annulus\", the ring cowry, so-called because of the bright orange-colored ring on the back or upper side of the shell, was commonly used. Many specimens were found by Sir Austen Henry Layard in his excavations at Nimrud in 1845–1851.\n\n\n\n"}

The band is considered among the pioneers of hardcore punk, particularly in the Midwest region. Like most hardcore bands, Negative Approach was little known in its day outside of its hometown. It is now idolized in the Detroit rock underground and the punk subculture, considered to be one of the elite bands of the \"old school\" era, and continues to be influential. Negative Approach initially broke up in 1984 with singer John Brannon moving on to the Laughing Hyenas, and later Easy Action, but the band has reformed as of 2006 and continues to tour sporadically.\n\nNegative Approach was formed in August 1981 in Detroit, Michigan by Brannon and Pete Zelewski, supposedly after seeing a Black Flag/Necros show. The first NA lineup consisted of Brannon on vocals, Rob McCulloch on guitar, Pete Zelewski on bass and Zuheir Fakhoury on drums. Not long after, Zelewski left the band to form the Allied and was replaced by McCulloch's brother Graham. Fakhoury was later replaced by Chris \"Opie\" Moore. The lineup of Brannon/McCulloch/McCulloch/Moore would remain unchanged until NA disbanded.\nNA's first gig was in the basement of Necros drummer Todd Swalla's mother's home. Soon after, they recorded a demo, and followed that up with an appearance on the \"Process of Elimination\" compilation 7\" EP, released on Meatmen frontman Tesco Vee's fledgling Touch and Go label, named after his fanzine of the same name. The comp also featured the Meatmen and Necros, among others. NA, the Meatmen and Necros then embarked on the Process of Elimination tour. Although this \"tour\" consisted of a mere three shows (Boston, New York City and Washington, DC), it is cited as being a key event in the early spread of hardcore.\n\nThe first proper Negative Approach studio release came in 1982 with their self-titled 7\" EP, also on Touch and Go. It contained \"Can't Tell No One,\" \"Ready to Fight\" and \"Nothing\", the latter considered by many to be the quintessential NA song.\n\nThe following year saw the release of the \"Tied Down\" album, also venerated as a hardcore classic.\n\nThe classic lineup fell apart in 1983. Rob McCulloch claims that the band had grown weary of the group's reputation for writing negative lyrics but that Brannon was not comfortable writing differently. Also, McCulloch stated that Brannon's involvement with Larissa Stolarchuk from L-Seven was another source of tension for the group. The band regrouped long enough to record the \"Tied Down\" albumP, then split for good.\n\nAfterwards, Brannon assembled a new lineup with members Kelly Dermody (guitar), Dave (bass) and Mike McCabe (drums). This version of Negative Approach played a series of live shows throughout 1984 which featured some new songs, such as \"Obsession\", \"Tunnel Vision\", \"Kiss Me Kill Me\" and a cover of \"I Got a Right\" by the Stooges. This lineup was documented on the \"Live at the Newtown Theater\" bootleg 7\" and some live tracks recorded at Boston's Paradise Rock Club that appeared on the \"Total Recall\" CD collection. The new lineup split during the first week of their tour in support of \"Tied Down\", playing their last show in Memphis.\n\nBrannon went on to front the punk blues band Laughing Hyenas with his girlfriend Stolarchuk (then calling herself \"Larissa Strickland\"), and sings for Easy Action. In 2008, Brannon recorded vocals for two songs on Vitamin X's album \"Full Scale Assault\", recorded by Steve Albini.\n\nMoore moved out from behind the drums to front alt-rock act Crossed Wire along with Rob McCulloch. After Crossed Wire, McCulloch attended college and has not pursued a career in music, although he maintains a home recording studio. Moore later embarked on a respected solo career as a roots-oriented singer and songwriter. His band Moore & Sons, featuring Lambchop member Dennis Cronin, signed to the UK's Triumphant Sounds/Drawing Room label.\n\nGraham McCulloch moved to Washington, DC and joined the Meatmen, before forming Earth 18 with John \"Bubba\" Dupree (formerly of Void). Earth 18 released several albums and toured the US, opening for Nitzer Ebb. After Earth 18 disbanded, McCulloch played for several years in Mother May I.\n\nOn May 2006, it was announced that Brannon and Moore would play a Negative Approach reunion show of sorts, for Touch and Go's 25th anniversary show on September 9, 2006, as well as two later shows in the UK (London on December 7 and at All Tomorrow's Parties on December 10). Despite repeated efforts by Rob and Graham McCulloch to be a part of the reunion and have the classic NA lineup play, Brannon refused. It was instead announced that Harold Richardson (of Easy Action) and Ron Sakowski (formerly of Easy Action, Laughing Hyenas and Necros) would complete the lineup.\n\nNegative Approach closed out the No Fun Fest in Brooklyn, New York on May 20, 2007. Thurston Moore played guitar on two songs at the start of their set.\n\nThe band did a brief reunion tour in the northeast United States in April 2008, performing in Brooklyn and Providence. They also played the wedding of Anal Cunt founder Seth Putnam. The band did a lengthier tour of Europe in June 2008, and later that year, a concert in Los Angeles. In 2009, they played a string of shows in the U.S.\n\nOn July 31, 2010, Negative Approach played a book release party for Tony Rettman's \"Why Be Something That You're Not\" at St. Andrew's Hall in Detroit with other bands reflecting the formative years of the Midwest hardcore scene such as Tesco Vee's Hate Police, Sorcen, Violent Apathy and Hellmouth. The book was titled after a Negative Approach song, and included interviews with artists from the Detroit hardcore scene. The tour also featured the signing of the book \"Touch and Go: The Complete Hardcore Punk Zine '79–'83\" written by Vee and Dave Stimson and edited by Steve Miller.\n\nIn 2010, Brannon discovered several unreleased Negative Approach recordings, including the lost 1984 sessions of unreleased studio tracks. After meeting Brannon, Curtis Casella of Taang! Records offered to release the recordings, which include \"Friends of No One\", \"Cargo Cult\" \"Kiss Me Kill Me\", \"Obsession\", \"Genocide\" and a studio version of \"I Got a Right\". The tapes were brought to Jim Diamond to restore and preserve. In November 2011, Taang! released the recordings on the \"Nothing Will Stand in Our Way\" album, around the time that the band played the Fun Fun Fun Fest in Austin with former Swirlies drummer Anthony DeLuca manning the kit in place of Moore. This lineup toured extensively throughout 2012 including a month in the U.S. with Off! and a month in Europe with Punch.\n\nNegative Approach's musical style was based on Detroit proto-punk icons the Stooges. Of the Stooges' guitarist Ron Asheton, John Brannon said, \"So much of what NA stands for; our sound and lyrics were based on the music which he helped to create.\"\n\nNA were also influenced by high-octane British hardcore punk (especially Discharge) and Oi! music (Blitz, 4-Skins, Sham 69, etc.), although from the start, their sound and demeanor were considerably more aggressive and brutal than that of their influences. NA's brand of hardcore was savage and nihilistic, exuding frustration, pessimism, and rage. This was personified in vocalist Brannon, an intimidating and intense young man with a shaved head, piercing stare, and belligerent attitude. His vocal style and stage presence set the standard for those that followed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It was released on February 22, 1994, by Flipside. The album shows a strong folk influence, consisting of home recordings, studio recordings, live performances, field recordings, sound collages, and abstract noise experiments. \n\nA lo-fi recording of largely anti-commercial nature, \"Stereopathetic Soulmanure\" is Beck's third official recording, the first two being \"Golden Feelings\" and \"A Western Harvest Field by Moonlight\". Beck would soon return with the mostly acoustic \"One Foot in the Grave\" and \"Mellow Gold\" before recording his major label follow-up \"Odelay\" (1996).\n\nAs of July 2008, \"Stereopathetic Soulmanure\" has sold over 146,000 copies in the United States.\n\nAll songs were written by Beck, except where noted.\nNotes\n\nThere was a rerelease of the album by Revolver USA on September 25, 2000. This pressing separates \"No Money No Honey\" over tracks 7 and 8 and breaks parts of \"One Foot in the Grave\" and \"Aphid Manure Heist\" over tracks 12, 13 and 14; this caused all tracks after \"Crystal Clear (Beer)\" to be off from the track listing on the back cover. This pressing also omits the short snippet of dialog called \"Ken\", yet keeps \"Bonus Noise\" on the same track as \"Modesto\". This pressing causes some online track listings, such as the one at Allmusic, to be incorrect. The actual track listing of this pressing is as follows:\n\n\nThis release can be differentiated from the original 1994 Flipside release in two ways. The rereleased CD has \"FLIP660\" printed on the CD whereas the original would have \"FLIP60\". The CD case however still retains the original catalog number on the spines \"FLIP60\". And there is a message above the barcode on the back of the CD case that reads \"Distributed by Revolver USA www.midheaven.com/fi/\".\n\n\n"}
