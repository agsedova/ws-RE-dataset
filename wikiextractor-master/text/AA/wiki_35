Her first acting job was guest starring with Halle Berry on the science-fiction Fox comedy \"They Came from Outer Space\". Phillips was also a sought-after fitness and swimsuit model. Canadian bodybuilder and entrepreneur Joe Weider placed her under contract. During this time she was used in advertising campaigns, as a spokesmodel, appearing on the cover of \"Muscle & Fitness\" magazine four times.\n\nShe landed her first regular television series for Paramount Pictures alongside Sir Mix-a-Lot in \"The Watcher\". Phillips continued to land roles in television and independent films from comedies to martial arts films; Phillips is a trained martial artist and performed most of her fighting and stunts in these films. On the television series \"\" (1998), Phillips played the dual role of Talon aka Hannah Foster. With this role, Phillips became the first female to play a crow on screen. In between \"\" filming, Phillips also showed off her martial arts abilities in a series of tele-films for Paramount Pictures.\n\nParamount Pictures offered Phillips a studio contract after high ratings for \"Chameleon\". It was a followed by two sequels: \"\" and \"\".\n\nPhillips appeared on numerous popular television shows such as \"The Hitchhiker\", \"Stargate SG-1\", \"The X-Files\" (Best Actress Winner), \"Married... with Children\", \"Two Guys and a Girl\" and \"Baywatch\". Bobbie often impressed producers to such a degree in her guest appearances that they extended her roles, brought her character back (as with Two Guys and a Girl) or made her a series regular, as with \"Murder One\".\n\nPhillips was a regular on the first season of the 22nd People's Choice Awards winner for \"Favorite New TV Dramatic Series\" for \"Murder One\". Phillips received praise from \"Variety\" for her role as Julie Costello.\n\nShe had a small role in the controversial big screen Hollywood film \"Showgirls\". She has starred in several small independent films and has appeared on stage as well. Prior to acting professionally, Phillips starred in several musicals. She performed as a child at the Dock Street Theater in her hometown of Charleston, South Carolina. Another famous Dock Street alumnus is Thomas Gibson, also originally from Charleston. Phillips and Gibson later worked together, acting in the television series \"Dharma & Greg\".\n\nPhillips continued to perform in television sitcoms, dramas, and independent feature films up until her early retirement in 2003. Phillips' last film prior to retiring was \"Last Flight Out\", in which she starred as a missionary doctor. Phillips returned to acting in 2014 with several independent feature films released in 2015 and 2016.\n\nPhillips is married to Anthony Filipetto, who was her hairstylist on several films and television shows, after meeting on the set of the film \"Hustle\" in 1999. Phillips retired and left Hollywood in 2003. Bobbie and her husband traveled to Costa Rica to rescue animals and begin Anthony's surfing career. The couple traveled extensively between Canada, Fiji, Australia and Mexico before Bobbie moved to Anthony's home country of Canada. She appeared on the April 17, 2010 episode of the HGTV home design show \"Divine Design\", where it was disclosed that she had recently moved to her husband Anthony's home country of Canada with their three dogs. \n\nPhillips is involved in animal rescue work around the world.\n\nShe has one son named Mark from her previous marriage.\n\nBeginning in 2016, Phillips branched out further in her animal rescue work and became involved with several elephant rescue organizations. As well, visiting and learning the inner workings of Embark whose main focus is street dogs in Sri Lanka.\n\n"}

This is significant to both proteins and genetic material, such as overwound circular DNA.\n\nThe earliest significant reference in molecular biology is from 1971, by F. B. Fuller:\n\nA geometric invariant of a space curve, the writhing number, is defined and studied. For the central curve of a twisted cord the writhing number measures the extent to which coiling of the central curve has relieved local twisting of the cord. This study originated in response to questions that arise in the study of supercoiled double-stranded DNA rings.\"\n\nAbout the writhing number, mathematician W. F. Pohl says:\n\nIt is well known that the writhing number is a standard measure of the global geometry of a closed space curve.\"\n\nContrary to intuition, a topological property, the linking number, arises from the geometric properties twist and writhe according to the following relationship:\nwhere \"L\" is the linking number, \"W\" is the writhe and \"T\" is the twist of the coil.\n\nThe linking number refers to the number of times that one strand wraps around the other. In DNA this property does not change and can only be modified by specialized enzymes called topoisomerases.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1832784", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1832784", "title": "Barneys New York", "text": "Barneys New York\n\nBarneys New York Inc. was an American luxury department store brand, founded in 1923 in New York City. It introduced major luxury brands including Armani, Azzedine Alaïa, Comme des Garçons, Christian Louboutin, and Ermenegildo Zegna to the US market.\n\nBarneys New York filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in August 2019 and closed 15 of its 22 stores, including flagship stores in Las Vegas, Chicago, and Seattle. Following its sale in November 2019, Authentic Brands Group took control of the Barneys brand name and licensed it to Saks Fifth Avenue.\nBarney Pressman opened his first store in a space with of frontage at Seventh Avenue and West 17th Street in Manhattan in 1923. He raised the $500 to pay the lease by pawning his wife's engagement ring. Barney's Clothes were stocked with 40 brand name suits and a big sign with a slogan, \"No Bunk, No Junk, No Imitations\". Barney's sold clothing at discounted prices by purchasing showroom samples, retail overstocks, and manufacturers' closeouts at auctions and bankruptcy sales. He also offered free alterations and free parking to attract customers. And this first of its kind store landed Barney Pressman on many TV and Radio shows.\n\nPressman claimed to be the first Manhattan retailer to use radio and television, beginning with \"Calling All Men to Barney's\" radio spots in the 1930s that parodied the introduction of the Dick Tracy show. He sponsored radio programs featuring Irish tenors and bands playing jigs to advertise Irish woolens. Women encased in barrels gave away matchbooks with the store name and address. He also chartered a boat to take 2,000 of his customers from Manhattan to Coney Island.\n\nIn a 1973 interview with \"Business Week\", Fred Pressman, Barney Pressman's son, stated that he became \"convinced that the discount route definitely was not for us. My father and I have always hated cheap goods ... I didn't want to sell low-end merchandise. Now, many of those who chose to are verging on bankruptcy.\" Fred Pressman's obituary in \"The New York Times\" stated:\n\nWith his father's blessing, Fred Pressman slowly transformed the store from a salty discount house that sold roast beef sandwiches in its pub to a purveyor of Italian designers with a cafe serving Perrier and light salads. He began to discard the types of suits that his father was prone to unearthing at auctions and bankruptcy sales, peppering the racks instead with then-obscure and top-name designers both, but continued to offer touches like free alterations that gave Barneys its reputation.\n\nPressman is quoted as saying, \"The best value you can offer a customer is personal attention to every detail, and they will return again and again. Ultimately, the customer cares the most about how he or she is treated.\" Pressman died in July 1996.\n\nIn 1970, Barney's built a fifth story onto its original building and a five-story addition. The original store was renamed America House and the addition was named International House. The expanded store occupied the entire Seventh Avenue block (between 16th and 17th streets), with of selling space and 20 individual shops.\n\nInternational House, Fred Pressman promised, would feature complete collections of European designers, \"from denim pants to $250 suits\", not just a watered-down \"potpourri of fabrics and models\". The renovated America House, he said, would hold merchandise from \"manufacturers who are in effect designers\".\n\nBy 1973, the store was stocking 60,000 suits. It carried the full lines of designers such as Bill Blass, Pierre Cardin, Christian Dior, and Hubert de Givenchy. It became the first clothing store in the U.S. to stock the full line of Giorgio Armani, after signing an agreement in 1976. Barneys is widely credited to have introduced Giorgio Armani to the American market.\n\nWomen's clothing was introduced in 1976 on the third floor of the International House. In the following year, the women's store relocated to The Penthouse, a new top-level enclosure. Barney's also added housewares, cosmetics, and gift departments to the store. Also in 1977, Barney's in-store restaurant was renamed The Cafe and began selling salads, soup and sandwiches.\n\nThe company dropped the apostrophe in Barney's in 1981. In 1981, the women's penthouse became a duplex. Barneys imported 80% of the women's and 40% of the men's merchandise. The $25 million, women's store finally opened in 1986 in a row of six townhouses and two larger adjacent buildings across the store along 17th Street. The addition included a unisex beauty salon and restaurant, antiques, and accessories, gifts, and housewares departments. It accounted for about one-third of Barneys' sales of some $90 million the following year.\n\nIn 1988, Barneys opened a men's store in the World Financial Center. The store abandoned its Seventh Avenue flagship in 1993, moving to the current , nine-story, Kohn Pederson Fox-designed Manhattan store on Madison Avenue at East 61st Street. It was the largest new store in New York City since the Great Depression. The store is a 22-story building with 14 floors of offices above the store. The wood floors, a marble mosaic on the lobby floor, gold-leaf ceilings, and lacquered walls of the new Barneys store cost $267 million.\n\nIn 1989, the store formed a holding company with Japanese department store Isetan to operate stores in both countries. The first Tokyo store opened in November 1990. The agreement also called for the holding company to spend $250,000 to open 30 smaller stores of approximately . The earliest of these smaller format stores opened in Costa Mesa, California in 1990.\n\nBarneys opened its first department store outside Manhattan in Chicago, in 1993, followed by another large store in Beverly Hills, California, in 1994. The Chicago store closed in 2019.\n\nIn 1995, the Pressman family intended to close the investment relationship with Isetan consolidating the Barneys retail business and Isetan investment in the United States real estate for the Barneys flagship stores in New York, Chicago, and Beverly Hills. At the conclusion of this consolidation, the real estate investment and the retail businesses would be held in one company.\n\nDuring the consolidation effort, Isetan's final funding of the real estate investment was intended to be processed through a Pressman family holding company, PREEN (Pressman Robert Eugene Elizabeth Nancy) and then directed to the real estate development. Instead of the funds flowing directly through the holding company to the real estate investment, they were given in exchange to BNY Licensing (another Pressman family company that held the Barneys trademarks) for the projected 50 year royalty stream due BNY Licensing from Isetan for their Barneys Japan business. Isetan was unaware of this transaction at the time.\n\nIsetan had reported their investment in Barneys earlier in the year as a current asset expressing their intent and belief that it would be concluded in 1995/first quarter 1996. Isetan considered the handling of the final investment a breach in trust, and stopped efforts to consolidate the investment and the Pressman family business.\n\nIn December 1995, under the advice of John P. Campo of LeBeouf, Lamb, Greene & MacRae and Anthony Grillo of The Blackstone Group, the Pressmans recognizing that consolidating the investment and the business was no longer viable, voluntarily filed for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy. It was believed that, only in bankruptcy court, could the agreement between the Pressman family and Isetan be dismissed and a new agreement be authored. The strategy failed.\n\nThe company filed for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy in early January 1996. The bankruptcy allowed the company to close stores that were opened early in the company's expansion and were no longer consistent with the company's strategy. These stores included stores in Cleveland, Ohio; Costa Mesa, California; Dallas and Houston, Texas; and Short Hills, New Jersey. In subsequent years, management would re-enter some of these markets with larger flagship stores.\n\nOn December 20, 2004, the Pressman family sold its remaining ownership, less than 2%, to the Jones Apparel Group, which in turn sold the company in September 2007 to Dubai-based private equity firm Istithmar PJSC for $937.4 million. Included in Istithmar's purchase was an estimated $500 million in debt. \"The luxury market took a sharp turn for the worse after Istithmar's acquisition of Barneys. U.S. sales of high end clothing, fragrances and accessories slipped 14% in 2009, according to Bain & Co. Although luxury was a star performer over the 2010 holiday season, spending trends have yet to recover to pre-recessionary levels. The privately held company doesn't reveal financial results but said that EBITDA rose by $30 million in 2010.\"\n\nHoward Socol, Barneys' former CEO, resigned shortly after the change in ownership. The company failed to fill the position for over two years until it appointed Mark Lee to the post in September 2010. Lee is the former chief executive of Gucci Group and has consulted and sat on the board of many other fashion companies. After Lee's appointment, Barneys experienced changes in its staff, advertising, and website. Amanda Brooks, former creative director of Hogan, replaced longtime fashion director, Julie Gilhart. Lee's former Gucci colleague, Daniella Vitale, replaced Judy Collinson as head merchant. Former creative director Simon Doonan, now creative ambassador-at-large, was replaced by Dennis Freedman.\n\nBarney's advertisements and catalogs are usually shot in-house, but for Spring 2011 candid shots by art photographers such as William Klein, Nan Goldin and Juergen Teller were taken behind-the-scenes during New York Fashion Week. Some existing stores will face new renovations such as the in Madison Avenue location's main floor and Co-Op levels. The traditional red awnings have been changed to black. Barneys' website has been revamped and has launched a new site called \"The Window\" which is the retailer's primary \"social media landing page\"—a window into the Barneys world, with news about fashion and happenings at Barneys stores.\n\nAs of February 2011, Barneys no longer sold Prada (with the exception of shoes and menswear) because of disagreements concerning prices and inventory control. Prada wanted to lease space, but control its own inventory and markdowns under a concession model. Barneys declined.\n\nIn May 2012, Perry Capital acquired a majority ownership of the company which reduced its $590 million debt to $50 million. It will have three seats on the seven-member board. The former majority owner Istithmar World as well as new investor Yucaipa Cos will also be on the board as will current executive chairman Mark Lee.\n\nIn December 2013, \"Women's Wear Daily\" announced that the retailer would return to the portion of its original Seventh Avenue site being vacated by bankrupt Loehmann's. In January 2014, Barneys was to use transgender models in advertisement for its 2014 advertisement campaign.\n\nIn February 2016, Barneys New York returned to its original Seventh Avenue location in Chelsea opening a four-story Flagship store.\n\nDaniella Vitale was named chief executive officer, succeeding Lee, in February 2017. The company closed in 2019.\n\nOn August 6, 2019, Barneys New York filed for bankruptcy once more. Fifteen stores closed as part of the bankruptcy filing, including Barneys flagship stores in Las Vegas, Chicago, and Seattle; smaller-format stores in Los Angeles, New York, and Philadelphia; and all but two of its outlet stores.\n\nOn 25 October 2019, Authentic Brands Group announced it had won the bidding process ($271.4 million bid). Authentic Brands Group has said it would close all seven remaining Barneys stores and license the retailer's intellectual property to Saks Fifth Avenue. \"The New York Times\" reported that Authentic Brands Group's strategy is \"essentially betting that the future of retail lies with the abstract values of brand names rather than in-person shopping experiences.\"\nFollowing its 2019 liquidation, it was reported that in Manhattan, Bergdorf Goodman, Bloomingdales, Saks, the new Neiman Marcus and the new Nordstrom were hoping to attract former Barneys shoppers.\n\nPrior to its liquidation, Barneys New York operated five flagship department stores in the United States.\n\nFreds restaurants operated inside of the Beverly Hills, Madison Avenue, Downtown NY, and San Francisco locations.\n\nIn 2014, the company announced plans for a flagship department store at Bal Harbour Shops in Bal Harbour, Florida as part of a planned expansion of that shopping center. The store was to open in 2023 with the new portions of the center.\n\nBarneys New York closed its flagship store at Northpark Center in Dallas in 2013. Its store at Scottsdale Fashion Square in Scottsdale, Arizona followed in 2016. The company opened a freestanding men's store in San Francisco in February 2016, and in summer 2018 announced it would add a restaurant.\n\nTwo warehouse stores operated in addition to the company's full-line business. \n\nSix full-line Barneys stores and six warehouse stores operate in its Japan division. As of 2020, Barneys Japan is still operating under Seven & I Holdings Co., which also operates Sogo and Seibu Department Stores.\n\nEstablished in 1986, the Barneys New York CO-OP originally existed as the contemporary department within Barneys flagship stores. Created to house trendier and less expensive product than the rest of the store, the CO-OP was aimed at younger shoppers with smaller budgets than a traditional Barneys customer. The CO-OP department was spun-off into a separate chain of stores in the 2000s, primarily located in shopping malls and lifestyle centers. At its height, there were more than 20 CO-OP stores throughout the United States.\n\nIn 2013, Barneys retired the CO-OP name. Several CO-OPs were converted into boutique versions of the flagship Barneys New York brand, but most closed.\n\nThe 2010 opening of the Brooklyn, New York CO-OP location raised some concerns among members of the Park Slope Food Coop regarding the use of the term \"co-op\" by a for-profit corporation. According to the general manager of the Food Coop, Barneys's use of the term is a violation of the New York State Cooperative Corporations Law.\n\nBarneys was repeatedly accused of racially profiling its customers throughout the years. In 1996, Johnnie Roberts, a journalist for \"Newsweek\", published an account of an incident taking place in the spring of 1990 in which he was mistakenly accused of shoplifting because he is African American.\n\nIn 2013, Trayon Christian, a 19-year-old African American, purchased a $350 Ferragamo belt and was arrested shortly after leaving the store. The police had received a call from the store claiming that the debit card used was fraudulent, even though the customer provided proper identification at the time of the purchase. The officers questioned Christian on how he was able to afford the purchased belt, and accused him of using a fraudulent card. He was handcuffed, detained in a holding cell for two hours and interrogated further. He was later released after the police contacted Chase Bank to verify ownership of the card.\n\nAnother African American shopper, Kayla Phillips, came forward with a similar claim after she purchased a $2,500 Céline handbag with her debit card. Both shoppers believe they were targeted because of their race after they purchased costly items and have stated they intend on filing discrimination lawsuits against the store.\n\nAs a result of these high-profile cases, Al Sharpton threatened to boycott the store in October 2013. Sharpton compared Barneys practice of racial profiling to the controversial stop-and-frisk policy practiced by the NYPD. Within days of Sharpton’s boycott announcement, fans petitioned rapper and businessman Jay-Z to sever ties with the retailer with whom he had a partnership. Jay-Z responded saying that he would look into the matter more thoroughly rather than make a snap judgment stating, \"I move and speak based on facts and not emotion.\" In November 2013, Jay-Z stated that his deal with Barneys would continue as planned, with the condition that he be placed in a leadership role on a committee specifically organized to deal with racial profiling in the store. Other conditions required that all of the proceeds of the BNY SCC collection be donated to Jay-Z's charity, the Shawn Carter Scholarship Foundation. This was a major increase from the 25% of the proceeds that was initially agreed upon. As well, Barneys agreed to donate 10% of all retail of all stores nationwide as well as its web store, Barneys.com, on November 20, 2013, which would guarantee a total of at least one million dollars.\n\nIn 2018, Barneys used live butterflies to introduce a new line of jewelry and accessories, asking customers and employees to interact with monarch butterflies as they flitted around display cases in the Beverly Hills store. PETA reported \"that there were many dead and dying butterflies languishing around the display area, behind plants and in plant beds.\" Barneys responded by banning the use of live butterflies from any future promotions and making a donation to PETA as an apology.\n\nThe union busting firm Kulture Consulting, LLC was hired in 2015. According to a Department of Labor document, Kulture “presented informational meetings to company employees relative to the process of unionization” at Barney's locations in Beverly Hills, Chicago, Las Vegas, and San Francisco. In Chicago representatives from the labor union Workers United reported that \"management called workers into one-on-one meetings\" and engaged in \"scare tactics\". In December 2018, Barneys hired Kulture Consulting to present \"informational meetings\" with employees at its Las Vegas location.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1832785", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1832785", "title": "Goldstone (glass)", "text": "Goldstone (glass)\n\nGoldstone is a type of glittering glass made in a low-oxygen reducing atmosphere. The finished product can take a smooth polish and be carved into beads, figurines, or other artifacts suitable for semiprecious stone, and in fact goldstone is often mistaken for or misrepresented as a natural material.\n\nAnother common name for the material is aventurine glass, based on the original Italian name \"avventurina\" (from \"avventura\", \"adventure\" or \"chance\").Also it is called \"Dell Roba\" (In Farsi: دلربا) Persian) which means \"Charming\", or \"monk's gold\" or \"monkstone\" from folkloric associations with an unnamed monastic order.\n\nThe material is sometimes called sandstone when used in watch dials, despite its lack of resemblance to the porous, matte texture of the natural stone.\n\nCuriously, \"aventurine\" glass is one of the few synthetic simulants to provide the eponym for the similar natural stones. The mineral name \"aventurine\" is used for forms of feldspar or quartz with mica inclusions that give a similar glittering appearance; the technical term for this optical phenomenon, \"aventurescence\", is also derived from the same source.\n\nOne original manufacturing process for goldstone was invented in seventeenth-century Venice by the Miotti family, which was granted an exclusive license by the Doge. Urban legend says goldstone was an accidental discovery by unspecified Italian monks or the product of alchemy, but there is no pre-Miotti documentation to confirm this. A goldstone amulet from 12th- to 13th-century Persia in the collection of the University of Pennsylvania shows that other, earlier artisans were also able to create the material. \n\nThe most common form of goldstone is reddish-brown, containing tiny crystals of metallic copper that require special conditions to form properly. The initial batch is melted together from silica, copper oxide, and other metal oxides to chemically reduce the copper ions to elemental copper. The vat is then sealed off from the air and maintained within a narrow temperature range, keeping the glass hot enough to remain liquid while allowing metallic crystals to precipitate from solution without melting or oxidizing.\n\nAfter a suitable crystallization period, the entire batch is cooled to a single solid mass, which is then broken out of the vat for selection and shaping. The final appearance of each batch is highly variable and heterogenous. The best material is near the center or \"heart\" of the mass, ideally with large, bright metal crystals suspended in a semitransparent glass matrix.\n\nCopper-based \"red goldstone\" aventurine glass exists on a structural continuum with transparent red copper ruby glass and opaque \"sealing wax\" purpurin glass, all of which are striking glasses, the reddish colors of which are created by colloidal copper. The key variable is controlling the colloid size: goldstone has macroscopic reflective crystals; purpurin glass has microscopic opaque particles; copper ruby glass has submicroscopic transparent nanoparticles.\n\nThe outer layers of a goldstone batch tend to have duller colors and a lower degree of glittery aventurescence. This can be caused by poor crystallization, which simultaneously decreases the size of reflective crystals and opacifies the surrounding glass with non reflective particles. It can also be caused by partial oxidation of the copper, causing it to redissolve and form its usual transparent blue-green glass in ionic solution.\n\nWhen reheated for lamp-working and similar uses, the working conditions should control the temperature and oxidation as required for the original batch melt: keep the temperature below the melting point of copper (1084.62 °C) and use an oxygen-poor reducing flame, or risk decomposition into the failure modes described above.\n\nGoldstone also exists in other color variants based on other elements. Cobalt or manganese can be substituted for copper; the resulting crystals have a more silvery appearance and are suspended in a strongly colored matrix of the corresponding ionic color, resulting in \"blue goldstone\" or \"purple goldstone\" respectively.\n\n\"Green goldstone\", or \"chrome aventurine\", forms its reflective particles from chromium oxides rather than the elemental metal, but is otherwise fairly similar.\n\nThe non-copper goldstones are easier to work with when reheated, due to the less stringent reduction requirements and higher melting points of manganese (1246 °C) and cobalt (1495 °C).\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1832790", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1832790", "title": "Kiki Preston", "text": "Kiki Preston\n\nKiki Preston, née Alice Gwynne (1898 – December 23, 1946), was an American socialite, a member of the Happy Valley set, and the alleged mother of a child born out of wedlock with Prince George, Duke of Kent, fourth son of King George V. Known for her drug addiction, which earned her the nickname \"the girl with the silver syringe\", she was a fixture of the Paris and New York high social circles, and a relation to the powerful Vanderbilt and Whitney families. Her life was marred by several tragic losses and her own mental problems, which eventually led to her suicide at 48.\n\nAlice \"Kiki\" Gwynne, later more commonly known as Kiki Preston, was born in 1898, in Hempstead, New York, the daughter of Edward Erskine Gwynne, Sr. (1869 – 10 May 1904). and his wife Helen (née Steele) (d. January 4, 1958). Her mother, Helen, was a great-granddaughter of Justice Samuel Chase, one of the signatories of the United States Declaration of Independence, as well as a granddaughter of Joshua Barney, commodore of the United States Navy during the American Revolutionary War. She was descended from Peter Jacquette, the second Dutch governor of Delaware. Her father was the nephew of tycoon Cornelius Vanderbilt II and his wife, socialite Alice Gwynne Vanderbilt, making him a distant relation of the prominent and wealthy Whitney family.\n\nHelen and Edward were married in New York on May 25, 1896. The marriage was a rocky one; Edward and Helen were separated at some point before reconciling. Besides Kiki, they also had two sons, one being Edward Erskine Gwynne, Jr. (1899 – 5 May 1948), known as Erskine Dwynne, who later became a writer, the publisher of the magazine \"Boulevardier\", and a columnist for the European edition of the \"New York Herald Tribune\". Their other son, Edward C. Gwynne, joined the United States Army Air Corps in his early youth and was killed when his aircraft was shot down. Between 1898 and 1904, Preston and her family resided at different times in Paris, Nassau County, and Park Hill in New York.\n\nA socialite without regular employment, Preston's father was described as a man that \"had extravagant tastes, expended money lavishly and was without business employment\", a fact which led his family to legal troubles. In 1899, while in Paris, Gwynne obtained a loan worth several thousand dollars from a jeweler. In February 1901, Gwynne transferred his interest in his property to his mother, Louise Gwynne. In the fall of 1901, the Paris money lender filed suit against Gwynne, for an unpaid loan of nearly $50,000 for diamonds. Shortly after his mother's death, in June 1902, Edward Gwynne filed a petition in bankruptcy, with liabilities of over $56,000 and assets of $57. Two years later, on May 10, 1904, Preston's father died of acute kidney problems at the age of 35, on the same day the case of the suit was to be brought up on the court. Preston was five years old at the time.\n\nAfter Louise Gwynne's death, the property that had been conveyed to her by her son, was held in trust for Preston and her siblings. However, in February 1908, the Paris money lender revived his legal attack against the Gwynnes, demanding their property on the unpaid loan of $40,000. In March, following a long discussion, the suit against the Gwynnes was dismissed. The judge ruled that the realty transfer performed by Edward to his mother was not made with the intent to defraud creditors. However, he also spoke rather harshly of Preston's father, referring to him as a man who \"may have had large expectancies, but seems to have been a drain upon his mother's financial resources\".\n\nFollowing her father's death, Preston was mostly raised in Paris, together with her brothers, although the family occasionally returned to their New York residence for brief periods of time. Preston was also educated in England. The money lender continued with a series of court appeals between 1910 and 1912, although the Gwynne family managed to emerge victorious from the lengthy legal battle.\n\nAccording to writers Lynn Kear and John Rossman, Preston also worked as a cabaret performer in her youth.\n\nIn 1919, Preston married Horace R. Bigelow Allen, after he completed his service with the United States Army. In later years, Allen became an executive in a plastics corporation. Preston and Horace had a daughter, Alice Gwynne Allen, who later married pilot officer Geoffrey Borden Russell, as well as a son, Ethan Allen. Living in Paris with her husband, Preston met and befriended some of the future key members of the Happy Valley set, such as Alice de Janzé and Josslyn Hay, 22nd Earl of Erroll. The Happy Valley set was a community of mainly British expatriates in Kenya, in the Wanjohi Valley close to the Aberdare Mountains, which had become known for its hedonistic lifestyle. In November 1924, Preston applied for divorce at the Paris courts, on the grounds of desertion. Horace R. B. Allen died on December 17, 1961, in Harbour Island, Bahamas.\n\nIn April 1925, Preston married investment banker Jerome \"Gerry\" Preston (15 March 1897 – 28 May 1934), a Harvard alumnus from Colorado, a man later described by writer Frédéric de Janzé in his memoirs as \"a creature of instincts\" and \"untamed\". Shortly afterwards, she formed a brief but close friendship with actress Kay Francis. Following travel to the British East Africa colony of Kenya, the home of the Happy Valley clique, Preston and her husband were persuaded to permanently move there, after a friend of the couple gave them the land she had on the shores of Lake Naivasha. The Prestons lived in a Dutch-style house they built at the shores of Lake Naivasha and associated with the Happy Valley set. Both she and her husband were successful as big game hunters and horse breeders. On their farm, they entertained several guests at times, including actor Gary Cooper on one occasion. Friends of the couple in the community included Alice de Janzé, Lord Erroll and his wife Idina (Preston was often entertained in their mansion), writer Evelyn Waugh and aviatrix Beryl Markham.\n\nPreston was a scandalous presence among the Happy Valley set, noted both for her beauty, as well as her wild lifestyle, which included partying all night long, rising from bed during dinnertime and drug abuse. Preston had become a notorious drug addict by that point; taking heroin, cocaine and morphine. She was nicknamed \"the girl with the silver syringe\", due to her habit of always carrying with her a syringe with which she injected herself. She was reported to often take out the silver syringe to inject herself, oblivious to onlookers. Swedish Baron Bror von Blixen-Finecke's second wife Cockie once remarked of Preston: \"She's very clever with her needle\". Preston was one of the clients of Frank Greswolde Williams, the main drug dealer of the Kenya colony, until his death in 1932. Whenever she was out of morphine, she sent a plane to pick up new supplies.\n\nPreston had many lovers during that time, including actor Rudolph Valentino and Prince George, Duke of Kent, whom she first met in the mid-1920s. Through 1928, she introduced him to cocaine and morphine among other drugs. Reportedly, Prince George shared Preston in a ménage à trois with Argentinian Jorge Ferrara.\n\nIn his attempt to rescue his cocaine-addicted brother from the influence of Preston, Edward, Prince of Wales attempted to persuade George and Preston to break off their relationship, but he was unsuccessful. Eventually, Edward forced George to stop seeing Preston and also forced Preston to leave England, while she was visiting George there in the summer of 1929. For years afterwards, Edward feared that George might relapse to drugs if he maintained his contact with Preston. Indeed, in 1932, Prince George ran into Preston unexpectedly at Cannes and had to be removed almost by force.\n\nIn the 1930s and 1940s, many people in her social circle of relatives and friends met untimely deaths. Previously, in May 1929, her 30-year-old brother, Edward Erskine Jr., almost died of a heart attack. Preston rushed back to Paris to be by his side because it was believed he was close to death. Erskine ultimately survived.\n\nOn November 16, 1933, her cousin, 26-year-old socialite William K. Vanderbilt III, son of William K. II and Virginia Fair Vanderbilt, was killed in a car accident; her brother, Erskine, was also in the car and suffered minor injuries. In August 1935, he was in another accident, when the car he was driving collided with a truck, injuring three. He was tried, fined $50, and incurred a 30-day suspended sentence. On account of that accident, Erskine later suffered a paralysis in 1938.\n\nOn May 28, 1934, Preston's husband, Jerome Preston, died at Hotel Pierre, in New York, aged 37, making her a widow at the age of 36. In February 1937, her brother-in-law (Jerome's brother), sportsman Lewis Thompson Preston also died, at age 37. On January 25, 1941, her friend, 22nd Earl of Erroll, aged 39, was murdered in Kenya. Later that year, on September 30, her friend and fellow American expatriate in Paris, Alice de Janzé, committed suicide with a firearm. On 25 August 1942, her former lover, Prince George, was killed in a plane accident, aged 39.\n\nOn June 6, 1944, her son Ethan Allen was killed during the Normandy Landings. Allen was serving with the Royal Canadian Air Force.\n\nAfter suffering from mental health issues for several years, Preston died by suicide on the night of December 23, 1946, jumping out of a window of her fifth-floor apartment in the Stanhope Hotel of New York City and landing in a courtyard of the hotel. According to her companion, Lillian Turner, Preston had been in poor health, depressed and nervous. Turner had just given Preston a glass of milk and then went into the living room of the apartment to read. When she heard no sounds coming from Preston's bedroom, she entered it, finding a window open and Preston gone. Preston's pyjama-clad body was discovered in an alleyway behind the hotel. Preston's mother, Helen Steele, was living at the same hotel at the time. Today, Preston's home on Lake Naivasha is inhabited by the 7th Earl of Enniskillen.\n\nIt has been alleged that American publishing executive Michael Temple Canfield (1926–1969) was the illegitimate son of Prince George and Preston. According to various sources, both Prince George, Duke of Kent, the uncle of British queen Elizabeth II and Laura Spencer-Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough, Canfield's second wife, shared this belief.\n\nCanfield was born in 1926 and was the adopted son of Cass Canfield, American publisher of Harper and Row. Michael Canfield attended The Groton School, before serving in the United States Marine Corps during World War II and was wounded at Iwo Jima. He graduated from Harvard University in 1951 and worked as London representative of Harper and Row. He married twice, first to Caroline Lee Bouvier, younger sister of Jacqueline Kennedy, in 1953 (divorced in 1958) and then to (Frances) Laura Ward, Countess of Dudley in 1960. Canfield died on December 20, 1969, of a heart attack, while on a New York-to-London flight, at the age of 43.\n\nPreston is referenced in James Fox's best-selling investigative non-fiction book \"White Mischief\" (1982). Together with other personalities of the Happy Valley set, she appears as a fictional character in Paul Di Filippo's short story \"A Happy Valley at the End of the World\", included in the author's collection of short stories \"Lost Pages\" (1998). She also appears as a character in Clint Jefferies' play \"African Nights\". The play is set in the Happy Valley community in Kenya, in the year 1928 and portrays, among other things, the romance between Preston and Prince George. From May to June 2004, the play was performed on the Wings Theater in New York. Preston was portrayed by actress Karen Stanion.\n"}

The TV dinner business is currently owned by Pinnacle Foods, while the broth business is currently owned by the Campbell Soup Company. Current TV dinner products sold under the brand include Swanson's Classics TV dinners and pot pies, and the current broth lineup includes chicken broth and beef broth.\n\nCarl A. Swanson (1879 – 1949) was a Swedish immigrant who worked on a farm in Blair, Nebraska, until he moved to Omaha. There, he worked in a grocery store where he came into contact with John O. Jerpe, who owned a small commission company, in which Swanson would become a partner in 1899. Initially, the Jerpe Commission Company purchased eggs and cream from local farmers. In turn, they processed the eggs, made butter from the cream, and sold these products to distributors and charged a commission to the farmers. With Swanson as a partner in the company, it began to expand. The Jerpe Commission Company began to sell chicken, turkey, and other meat. Swanson would eventually buy the company from Jerpe and rename it C.A. Swanson and Sons, as his sons Gilbert and Clarke had joined the business.\n\nThe frozen food industry began to dramatically change surrounding the time of World War II. As men were required on the battlefield, women became more needed in the workforce. This limited the amount of available time women could spend preparing meals for their children. Women began to rely on TV dinners post-war for greater convenience, and to save time.\n\nCarl Swanson died in 1949, and his sons Gilbert C. and W. Clarke took over the company. After the war ended, Jerpe was renamed C.A. Swanson & Sons. One year later, in 1950, the Swanson brothers initially began manufacturing frozen oven-ready chicken and turkey pot pies in aluminum trays. They branched into full meals after Swanson executive Gerry Thomas visited the distributor of a company that specialized in preparing food for airlines. The company packed the food in aluminum trays which could be heated in a conventional oven. Thomas proposed this idea to the Swanson brothers, suggesting they create an aluminum tray with three compartments: one compartment for frozen turkey slices and the other two for side dishes. The Swanson Company's first frozen dinner was a turkey dinner; eventually, the company added chicken and beef entrées. With over half of American households owning televisions by the 1950s, the Swanson brothers called their frozen meals \"TV dinners,\" suitable for eating on a folding tray in one's living room while watching television.\n\nThe Swanson & Sons' TV dinner branded frozen meal, sold 5,000 units when it was first introduced in 1953; just one year later, the company had sold over 10,000,000 TV dinners. The company discontinued its successful butter and margarine business to concentrate on a poultry-based line of canned and frozen products. In April 1955, Swanson's 4,000 employees and 20 plants were acquired by the Campbell Soup Company. By 1956, the Swanson brothers were selling 13 million TV dinners annually.\n\nFor the majority of its run, Swanson sponsored the game show, \"The Name's the Same\", with Robert Q. Lewis, alternating sponsorship with the Bendix Home Appliance division of Avco, and then Johnson's Wax. In a few 1980s and 1990s commercials for the TV dinner, the announcer was Mason Adams.\n\nWhen Swanson's TV dinners launched in the 1950s, the product competed primarily with home-cooked food, and was developed with a relatively low price point for the consumer. By the 1970s, however, the increasing number of two-income families and single working parents shifted competition to restaurant food, either eaten at the restaurant or ordered to take home. During this period, American consumers were increasingly exposed to a greater variety of international cuisines and more sophisticated flavors, and the consumer was also growing more nutrition-conscious and discerning. Competing in this new environment required more expensive ingredients, but Swanson was slow to change its traditional menus, and slow to recognize the increasing importance of the microwave oven in the heat-and-eat food market. It continued to use non-microwaveable foil trays long after competitors had adopted microwaveable paper and plastic trays. Swanson eventually introduced a new line of frozen dinners called \"Le Menu\" in the 1980s which featured more sophisticated menus on undivided plastic microwavable plates with lids. But by then, the company was competing with many other strong brands, such as Stouffer's. Stouffer's had also begun targeting the diet market with its reduced-calorie Lean Cuisine frozen meal line. Swanson trailed behind these developments.\n\nIn March 1998, Campbell Soup spun off the Swanson frozen meal business along with several other brands, including Vlasic, to a company called Vlasic Foods International; the company was re-branded Pinnacle Foods in 2001. In the spin-off, Campbell Soup granted Pinnacle a ten-year license to use the Swanson name on frozen meals and pot pies. That agreement expired in mid-2009, just before Pinnacle purchased Birds Eye Foods. Pinnacle continued to produce frozen meals, but it discontinued the use of the Swanson name in favor of the Hungry-Man brand; however, it remains in use for pot pies. Swanson's frozen breakfast line was re-branded Aunt Jemima several years before.\n\nSwanson products were the subject of a 2016 comedy routine by Jerry Seinfeld on \"The Late Show\".\n\nSuperfast Jellyfish, a song by virtual band Gorillaz, primarily samples some of Swanson's breakfast advertisements. \n\nA branch of the Omaha Public Library is named for W. Clarke Swanson.\n\n\n\n"}

Its source is Whitefish Lake in the Northwest Territories, and it flows east to Baker Lake in Nunavut. The Thelon ultimately drains into Hudson Bay at Chesterfield Inlet.\n\nThe drainage basin of the Thelon River encompasses some . Located far from almost all human development, the Thelon and its surroundings are entirely pristine wilderness. It has been described as Canada's remotest river.\n\nThe river has a width of up to a kilometer (0.6 mi) along much of its lower section, widening into Beverly, Aberdeen, and Schultz Lakes about upstream from its mouth at Baker Lake.\n\nApproximately 100 moose and more than 2,000 muskoxen forage on the land around the Thelon. 300,000 migrating barren-ground caribou cross the river every fall and spring.\n\nThe Inuit people, including Caribou Inuit and Copper Inuit, have long occupied the sparsely-populated lands around the Thelon. Artifacts of Inuit hunting and travel (including inukshuk guide stones) are readily observed near the river.\n\nIn 1770–71, English explorer Samuel Hearne crossed the Thelon while exploring Canada's northern interior.\n\nOver the winter of 1926–27, John Hornby starved to death on the Thelon along with two other men. They had planned to hunt migrating caribou, but failed to find the herd. Nevertheless, on the basis of Hornby's earlier explorations with James Charles Critchell Bullock in 1923, the Thelon Game Sanctuary was established in 1927, renamed the Thelon Wildlife Sanctuary in 1956.\n\nIn 1927(?), the Norwegian explorer and writer Helge Ingstad went by dog sled to the headwaters of the Thelon (Lynx Lake) together with native peoples from the east end of Great Slave Lake. This he detailed in his book \"The Land of Feast and Famine\".\n\nIn 1990, the lower of the Thelon were designated a Canadian Heritage River. Although there is no road access to the river, a number of wilderness campers and canoeists visit the Thelon every summer.\n\nThe basin of the Thelon is mentioned in the 1979 sci-fi novel \"Beetle in the Anthill\" by Boris and Arkady Strugatsky as the location of the embassy of Golovans: intelligent \"canoid\" (dog-like) race evolved at Saraksh planet.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1832810", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1832810", "title": "Names of Kosovo", "text": "Names of Kosovo\n\nThe name Kosovo (as referred to in this spelling) is the most frequently used form in English when discussing the region in question. The Albanian spelling \"Kosova\" has lesser currency. The alternative spellings \"Cossovo\" and \"Kossovo\" were frequently used until the early 20th century.\n\nKosovo () is the Serbian neuter possessive adjective of \"kos\" (), meaning \"blackbird\"; \"-ovo\" being an adjectival suffix – it is short for the region named the \"field of the blackbird\" (), the Kosovo field, the site of the 1389 battle between the army of Serbian Prince Lazar and the Ottoman Army, which ended in an Ottoman victory and Serbian decline. The name \"Kosovo\" Kos- is found in hundreds of Slavic locations. The cognate of Proto-Slavic kosь is Ancient Greek κόσσυφος. In Albanian, the variant name is \"Kosova\" (definite \"Kosovë\"), a borrowing from Serbian. Due to having borrowed it, some Albanian nationalists suggested \"Dardania\" as a substitute in the 1990s.\n\nKosovo was part of the Ottoman state for 457 years.\n\nOttoman traveller Evliya Çelebi, who went to the area in 1660 referred to central Kosovo as \"Arnavud\" (آرناوود) and noted that in Vučitrn its inhabitants were speakers of Albanian or Turkish and few spoke \"Boşnakca\". The highlands around the Tetovo, Peć and Prizren areas Çelebi considered as being the \"mountains of Arnavudluk\". Çelebi referred to the \"mountains of Peć\" as being in Arnavudluk and considered the Ibar river that converged in Mitrovica as forming Kosovo's border with Bosnia. He viewed the \"Kılab\" or Lab river as having its source in Arnavudluk and by extension the Sitnica as being part of that river. Çelebi also included the central mountains of Kosovo within Arnavudluk.\n\nDuring Ottoman rule the area of Kosovo was referred to as \"Arnavudluk\" (آرناوودلق) meaning Albania by the empire in its documents such as those dating from the eighteenth century.\n\nIn the late Ottoman period Albanians claimed the sancaks of Yeni Pazar (Novi Pazar), Ipek (Peć/Peja), Prizren, Priștine (Pristina) and Üsküp (Skopje) which were all within Kosovo Vilayet as forming part of \"Gegalık\" or Land of the Gegs, a term named after Gheg Albanians who inhabited the area.\n\nThere is a theory within linguistics that the name Dardania used in ancient times for the area of Kosovo is derived from the Albanian word dardhë, meaning \"pear\".\n\nDue to its Slavic (Serbian) character, Kosovo Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova supported a name change to \"Dardania\", in reference to the ancient kingdom and later-turned Roman province. Albanian nationalists seek to remove Serbian terminology (and toponomy) in Kosovo. It, however, did not enter into general usage.\n\nThe name \"Kosovo and Metohija\" was used for the autonomous province in Yugoslav Serbia since its creation in 1945 until 1968, when the term \"Metohija\" was dropped. In 1990, the name was reversed to \"Kosovo and Metohija\". After the Kosovo War, the United Nations mission used only \"Kosovo\" as the name of the province.\n\n"}

It first aired on the Fox network in the United States on May 1, 2005, and guest-stars comedian Ray Romano. The episode is a parody of the 2001 film \"A Beautiful Mind\".\n\nA major thunderstorm hits Springfield, and Marge demands that Homer fix their leaking roof. Homer attempts to solve the problem by using Hot Wheels ramps to transport all the draining water from the roof to the front yard through the hallway, the stairway and the mail slot on the front door. Though this plan seems to work well, Lisa's hamster slides down the ramps to the front yard by accident. Shocked, Lisa opens the front door to save her hamster, breaking all the ramps, and leaving the house all wet. Marge berates Homer for not providing a more sensible solution to fix the roof. Angered, Homer decides to go to Moe's Tavern, but is kicked out when he sits on Lenny's birthday cake by accident, shaped in the form of Lenny's favourite bar stool. Feeling depressed, Homer finds another bar, \"Knockers\" (A parody of the restaurant Hooters), where he meets a friendly man named Ray Magini. The two talk, and Homer finds out that Ray is a roofer, so Homer asks him to fix his leak. Ray agrees.\n\nThe next day, Homer assures Marge that his new friend will be taking care of the roof. Ray, however, does not arrive until everyone else has left. The two of them get up on the roof and use nail guns to nail the boards onto the roof, but they start shooting nails at each other, some hitting Ned Flanders' lawn mower next door. Ray leaves later and, as Homer runs on the roof, he crashes through the small part of the roof that they fixed, making the hole bigger. Meanwhile, Marge and the kids leave Santa's Little Helper with Grampa and the Springfield Retirement Home residents, because they seem to like him. When Marge sees the hole, she tells Homer to fix it himself, because she sees no reason to believe that his friend will.\n\nThe next day, Bart and Homer go to the Builder's Barn, and Homer meets Ray there. Ray apologizes to Homer for having not finished the job and promises he will stop by soon to work on the roof. Lisa, Marge, and Maggie arrive back at the retirement home, only to discover that Santa's Little Helper has become one of the old people. They permanently take him back home. After waiting a long while for Ray to show on the roof, Marge becomes worried about Homer, and tells him that Ray is just a figment of his imagination. When Homer refuses to believe it, he falls off the roof and is knocked unconscious.\n\nMarge then takes Homer to the Calmwood Mental Hospital. Dr. Hibbert tells him that Ray does not exist; he was created by Homer's mind as Homer was feeling lonely and unappreciated because of the previous events he had endured. All the people that Homer thinks saw Ray - Bart, Ned, and the \"Knockers\" bartender - claim they did not, and Lisa reveals that \"Ray Magini\" is an anagram for \"imaginary\". Six weeks and several hours of shock therapy later, Homer is now sure that Ray does not exist. As he is being discharged, he sees Ray again in the room. Angered by the pain the \"figment of his imagination\" has caused him, he assaults him. In retaliation, Ray knocks Homer out and everyone is surprised they can see him too.\n\nHe did really exist the whole time: the bartender did not see Ray as he had an eye patch on (while looking in the direction of Homer and Ray that night, Ray was before his covered eye), and Ray could not be seen by Ned because he was behind the chimney. Bart still viewed Homer with skepticism for talking to thin air, but Stephen Hawking arrives and says that Bart could not see Ray at the hardware store because of a miniature black hole caused directly behind Ray which absorbed the light from Ray and made it look as though Homer was talking to himself when Homer was actually talking to Ray. Marge asks Ray why he started fixing the roof, and then just disappeared. Ray says he is a contractor. Everyone laughs, and Marge says \"That's right, you're all crooks!\" Hibbert, seeing how angry Homer is as he was made to go through shock treatment for nothing, offers to make it up to him by doing a free eye scraping for him. Homer agrees on it, but also forces Hibbert to fix the roof without any breaks while Ray and Homer discuss \"Everybody Loves Raymond\" on the roof.\n\nAlthough it was advertised as the 350th episode, it was actually the 351st episode to air (\"Future-Drama\" is the 350th and \"The Heartbroke Kid\" is the 352nd). The real 350th episode (in production code order) is \"The Father, the Son, and the Holy Guest Star\", which was temporarily shelved following the death of Pope John Paul II.\n\n\nOn the United Kingdom's Channel 4, and in American syndication on Fox affiliates, the entire post-credit conversation between Homer and Ray about CBS's \"Everybody Loves Raymond\" was re-dubbed with the traditional end music for the show. However, when the episode aired on Sky1, the original end credits were used.\n\nScreen Rant called it the best episode of the 16th season.\n\n"}

He is currently professor of law at the National University of Singapore Faculty of Law and the Dean of the Singapore Institute of Legal Education. His expertise is in company law and securities regulation. Educated at NUS and St. John's College, Cambridge, he joined the teaching staff of the NUS Faculty of Law in 1981 and later served as Sub-Dean and Vice-Dean. He was Legal Adviser to the President of Singapore and Council of Presidential Advisors from 1995 to 1997, and was appointed as professor of law in 1999.\n\nWoon was a Nominated Member of Parliament between 1992 and 1996. He became the first Member of Parliament since 1965 to have a Private Member's Bill become a public law in Singapore – the Maintenance of Parents Act, which was passed in 1995. Between 1997 and 2006, Woon served in a number of diplomatic capacities, including Ambassador to Germany (1998–2003) with an accreditation to Greece (2000–2003), and Ambassador to Belgium with concurrent accreditation to the European Union, the Netherlands, Luxembourg and the Holy See. Woon was appointed Second Solicitor-General in 2006 and Solicitor-General the following year. He served as Attorney-General between 2008 and 2010, and then returned to academia.\n\nWoon, an ethnic Singaporean Chinese of Peranakan descent, was born on 12 September 1956 in Singapore to schoolteachers. He was a head prefect at Pasir Panjang Primary School (which his father became principal of years later) and a prefect while at Raffles Institution. Following his A-levels he was considering business administration, but ended up accepting a scholarship from DBS Bank to study law instead. According to Woon in an April 2008 interview, \"When I went for the scholarship interview, the interviewer said, 'We looked at your results and you look like you might be a lawyer; would you like to do law?' I said, 'Fine, if you want to give me the scholarship to do law, I'll do law'. I didn't plan to do law.\"\n\nHe earned his Bachelor of Laws (LL.B.) from the National University of Singapore (NUS), graduating in 1981 with first class honours. That same year, he also topped the postgraduate practice law course, winning the Aw Boon Haw and Aw Boon Par Memorial Prize. He joined the teaching staff of the NUS Faculty of Law that year, focusing his teaching and research on company law and securities regulation. In 1983 he graduated with a Master of Laws (LL.M.) degree with first class honours from St. John's College, Cambridge, which he completed on a Commonwealth Academic Staff scholarship.\n\nWoon was called to the Singapore Bar in 1985. The first edition of his book \"Company Law\" was published in 1988. The same year he became a Sub-Dean of the NUS Faculty of Law, then served as Vice-Dean from 1991 to 1995. On 1 February 1999 Woon was appointed a professor of law. In November 1990, Woon appeared before the Parliamentary Select Committee on the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (Amendment No. 3) Bill (Bill No. 23/90) to make representations on the proposed introduction of an elected President for Singapore. He took the view that since the elected President should be politically neutral, Cabinet members should only be eligible to stand for election five years after leaving politics.\n\nNever afraid to speak his mind, in July 1991 in an interview by \"The Straits Times\" Woon commented: \"We effectively don't have a Constitution. We have a law that can be easily changed by Parliament, and by the party in power because the party is Parliament. The changes themselves might not be controversial, but it is unsettling how flexible the Constitution is, unlike, say, in the United States.\" In reply, Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong pointed out that past changes to the Constitution had been made only with a two-thirds parliamentary majority and not done lightheartedly, as the intensive discussions and the two-year gestation period of the Elected President Bill proved. He affirmed that the Constitution had to evolve to reflect the changing needs of the people, and that it could not be assumed that the Constitution, drafted in 1965, would be the best Constitution for always and should be frozen in time. \"So to say that because the Government in power changes the Constitution there is no Constitution is ridiculous, to put it mildly.\"\n\nWoon was a Nominated Member of Parliament (NMP) for three terms, from 7 September 1992 to 6 September 1994, from 7 September 1994 to 6 September 1996, and from 7 September 1996 till 15 December 1996 when Parliament was dissolved for the 1997 general election.\n\nIn 1992 at the start of the Government's annual Speak Mandarin Campaign, the Minister for Information and the Arts George Yeo said in a newspaper article that the rising use of English by Chinese Singaporeans was a \"disturbing trend\" as \"[w]e become very exposed to Western cultural influences via books, magazines and films. Some influences are good. Others are harmful, especially to the structure of the family.\" This provoked Woon to respond that \"[t]he subliminal message being sent is that those who speak English are dangerous to society and that the wider use of English threatens the social fabric of Singapore\". He deplored this view because good values were neither Asian nor Western: \"Why should we confine ourselves to one or the other? Singapore isn't a Western society. It isn't an Asian society. It is a cosmopolitan society.\" He noted that \"[t]he emancipation of women, the rule of law, the equality of citizens irrespective of race, language or religion, the right to representative government: These are values we have adopted from the 'decadent' West.\"\n\nIn September 1992, Woon was appointed to the select committee to review the Companies (Amendment) Bill (Bill No. 33/92) which proposed, among other things, that scripless trading in securities listed on the Stock Exchange of Singapore be authorised so that share transfers can be made through computerised book entries. He was a director of Intraco Ltd. (1989–2000) and Natsteel Ltd. (1997–2001), both listed on the Stock Exchange.\n\nOn 23 May 1994, Woon moved a Private Member's Bill which was eventually passed by Parliament on 2 November 1995 as the Maintenance of Parents Act. The Act, which entitles parents at least 60 years old and unable to maintain themselves adequately to apply to a tribunal for their children to be ordered to pay maintenance to them, was the first public law that originated from a private member's bill since Singapore's independence in 1965. In its 5 December 1994 issue, \"Time\" magazine picked Woon as one of 100 young world leaders, the only Singaporean to make the list.\n\nFrom 1995 to 1997, Woon was Legal Adviser to the President of Singapore and Council of Presidential Advisors. During this time, he represented the President as junior counsel before the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore Tribunal in \"Constitutional Reference No. 1 of 1995\", which involved the interpretation of provisions of the Constitution of Singapore touching on the ability of Parliament to curtail the President's discretionary powers.\n\nBetween September 1997 and September 2006, Woon was seconded to the Foreign Service. He was Singapore's Ambassador to Germany from 6 February 1998 to July 2003, and was concurrently accredited to Greece from March 2000 to July 2003. He then served as Ambassador to Belgium (from 22 August 2003) with concurrent accreditation to the European Union, the Netherlands (from 22 October 2003), Luxembourg and the Holy See. In this capacity, he represented Singapore together with Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Law S. Jayakumar at the funeral mass of Pope John Paul II in the Vatican City on 8 April 2005, believed to be the largest gathering of heads of state in history. In 2006, the Vatican made Woon a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St. Gregory the Great, which is conferred on Roman Catholic men and women in recognition of their service to the Church, unusual labours, support of the Holy See, and the good example set in their communities and country.\n\nWoon was appointed to the post of Second Solicitor-General on 3 October 2006, and Solicitor-General on 2 July 2007. In 2007, he was also made a Senior Counsel. Between January 2007 and 31 March 2010, he was a member of the Advisory Board of the School of Law of the Singapore Management University. In February 2008, Woon was appointed by the Ministry of Finance to chair a steering committee to review the Companies Act.\n\nWoon became Attorney-General on 11 April 2008. Three months into the job, he created some controversy when delivering an off-the-cuff speech at the launch of the Law Society of Singapore's Public and International Law Committee. He said:\n\nIn mid-May, Woon commented that an acquitted person may not be guilty in law, but guilty in fact. Two months later, without referring directly to these remarks, Judge of Appeal V.K. Rajah wrote in a judgment that such comments could undermine confidence in the courts' verdicts and the criminal justice system, which was based on the doctrine of the presumption of innocence. The Minister for Law K. Shanmugam was asked in Parliament on 25 August 2008 to clarify the Attorney-General's comments. Shanmugam described the presumption of innocence as an \"important and fundamental principle\" which the Government was \"absolutely committed to upholding\". Nonetheless, it was \"entirely possible for a person to have committed acts which amount to a crime and yet, there may be no conviction\", as the trial process was designed to prove guilt and not innocence. He added: \"It is for the courts, and the courts alone, to exercise judicial power and decide the question of guilt, in a trial.\"\n\nWith effect from 20 May 2008, Woon was appointed a director of the Monetary Authority of Singapore. He also served on the Presidential Council for Minority Rights between 2008 and 2010.\n\nWoon was the first Attorney-General in more than ten years to personally appear in court. On 28 July 2008, he argued before the Court of Appeal that a woman who had manipulated her teenage lover into killing her husband should be given a life sentence. The Court held that a life sentence was inappropriate due to the defendant's psychiatric condition, and affirmed the nine-year jail term imposed by the High Court. Woon elected to take proceedings against Tang Wee Sung, chairman of the company C.K. Tang which owns Tangs department store, for the illegal purchase of a human organ – a kidney – in the first case of its kind in Singapore. The decision to do so was criticised by Dr. Lee Wei Ling, Director of the National Neuroscience Institute and daughter of Minister Mentor and former Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew, in an article published in \"The Straits Times\" on 5 September 2008. Woon replied, pointing out a number of misconceptions she held as to the facts and the law, and emphasising that the prosecution had been brought as no one was above the law. Subsequently, in response to further comments by Dr. Lee, he wrote an extended article entitled \"Wrong Facts and Faulty Logic\" that appeared in \"The Straits Times\" on 18 September 2008.\n\nHe also prosecuted a number of contempt of court cases, including suits against Dow Jones Publishing Company (Asia), Inc. for material published in \"The Wall Street Journal Asia\"; against US-based lawyer Gopalan Nair for comments on his blog; and against three Singapore Democratic Party supporters, John Tan Liang Joo, Isrizal bin Mohamed Isa and Muhammad Syahmi bin Sariman, who wore T-shirts bearing the image of a kangaroo dressed in a judge's gown outside the Supreme Court Building. On 15 March 2010, in one of his last cases before his term of office ended, he defended the constitutionality of capital punishment in Singapore before the Court of Appeal in an appeal by a man sentenced to death for drug trafficking.\n\nAt the third annual Singapore Children's Society Lecture entitled \"Changing Social Mores: Protecting Children from Themselves?\" on 31 October 2009, Woon expressed the view that prosecuting teenagers from having underage sex with each other served little purpose. \"It's basically kids having sex ... What do you do if the couple think they're in love? It's less easy if the girl consents. ... The judges cannot do very much by themselves. Sending them [the teenagers] to jail per se will not make them reflect on their lives. That is the last thing that is going to happen. But good or ill, this is the framework that we have.\"\n\nWoon established a new division in the Attorney-General's Chambers for the prosecution of cases in the Subordinate Courts of Singapore to enhance the development of criminal litigation skills, and recruited a number of young and talented lawyers into the Singapore Legal Service. In 2008 he hosted the International Association of Prosecutors Conference in Singapore. He also assisted in the setting up of the Centre for International Law at NUS to improve international law expertise in Singapore and the region. He was Singapore's alternate representative on the High Level Task Force for the Drafting of the ASEAN Charter, a key constitutional document for ASEAN, which was signed in November 2007. Subsequently, he co-authored a book entitled \"The Making of the ASEAN Charter\" (2009).\n\nWoon stepped down as Attorney-General on 10 April 2010 after a two-year term. In a media interview, he said that the post \"was not a job I really wanted or enjoyed. I did it because I was asked to do the job. So I did my best under the circumstances with what I had.\" When asked whether he had \"annoyed the powers that be\", he said:\n\nHe subsequently clarified that when he said he had outstayed his welcome he had been \"thinking more about the people I prosecuted rather than anything else\", and that \"I was kidding, I was being facetious\".\n\nWoon returned to academia at NUS, and was appointed the first Dean of the Singapore Institute of Legal Education (SILE), a company incorporated by the Singapore Academy of Law on 18 January 2010 to manage the postgraduate practical training of graduates from local and overseas universities seeking admission to the Singapore Bar, training contracts, and continuing legal education for practising lawyers. He has denied any intention to enter politics – \"Why would I leave one hot seat to jump into another hot seat? I've said for years that I would want to go back to my natural habitat eventually. Why wouldn't anyone believe me?\" – although when asked if he had forever ruled out a political career, he said: \"Forever is a long time but definitely not now.\" Subsequently, he reiterated in a \"Today\" interview: \"I am not a politician and I am not interested in politics and have no desire to go into politics. I do not know why people do not believe me when I say so. I have said it a thousand times but people do not seem to believe me.\"\n\nWoon is currently Chairman of the Singapore International Law Society (since 2006), Judge Advocate General (since 2007), and President of the Goethe Institute Singapore (since 2010). In 2015, Woon joined RHTLaw TaylorWessing LLP, one of the few largest law firms in Singapore, as its non-executive Chairman and Senior Consultant.\n\nIn September 2017, Woon wrote a piece in The Straits Times illuminating how the office of the Attorney-General carries out its prosecutorial function, and suggesting that this could be separated from its other role as legal advisor to the Government.\n\nWoon won a consolation prize for a short story called \"The Body in Question\" which he submitted for the 1985 National Short Story Writing Competition. In 2002, he published his first novel, \"The Advocate's Devil\". This was followed three years later by \"The Devil to Pay\" (2005). Both books are crime novels set in 1930s Singapore with Dennis Chiang, an English-educated Peranakan lawyer, as the protagonist. Woon has said that fiction writing was \"something I did on the side when I got tired of writing non-fiction\". A reviewer of \"The Advocate's Devil\" commented: \"That the author is a lawyer first and promising novelist second is most glaring in the language used in Devil. ... This must be the first made-in-Singapore whodunnit that needs to be read with a dictionary at hand.\" Although the protagonist Chiang's \"view of human beings other than himself is patronising at best\" and might leave readers with a \"rather sour aftertaste\", the novel's \"light touches of romance and compassion do much to lift the storyline\" and had \"masterful pacing\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The current identity card, known as MyKad, was introduced by the \"National Registration Department of Malaysia\" on 5 September 2001 as one of four MSC Malaysia flagship applications and a replacement for the High Quality Identity Card (\"Kad Pengenalan Bermutu Tinggi\"), Malaysia became the first country in the world to use an identification card that incorporates both photo identification and fingerprint biometric data on an in-built computer chip embedded in a piece of plastic.\n\nBesides the main purpose of the card as a validation tool and proof of citizenship other than the birth certificate, MyKad may also serve as a valid driver's license, an ATM card, an electronic purse, and a public key, among other applications, as part of the Malaysian Government Multipurpose Card (GMPC) initiative, if the bearer chooses to activate the functions.\n\nOther cards which are currently in use or soon to be introduced in the GMPC initiative and share similar features are:\n\nThe term MyKad is a compound of two words with ambiguous meanings; namely My and Kad.\n\nMy can be:\n\nKad can be:\n\nThe initial MyKad was a contact card solution developed and manufactured by IRIS Corporation. Made of PC with the dimensions in the ISO/IEC 7816 ID-1 format (standard credit card format), the initial card had a 32kb EEPROM (Electronically Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory) embedded chip running on M-COS (MyKad Chip Operating System). In November 2002, the capacity was increased to 64kb.\n\nThe upgraded and current version of the MyKad is a hybrid card containing two chips for both contact and contactless interfaces. Currently, this hybrid type MyKad is only issued in Malaysian states that employ the Touch 'n Go application.\n\nThe MyKad chip has a data retention up to 20 years, while the card itself has a lifespan of 10 years and has been tested according to the ISO 10373 standard.\n\nAll Malaysian citizens and permanent residents 12 years old or above are eligible for a MyKad. From 2001, it gradually replaced an older Malaysian Identity Card system, that had been in use since 1949 under British colonial rule, with the intention of becoming ubiquitous by 2007. Children are issued with a MyKid after birth. This card is \"upgraded\" to a MyKad on the 12th birthday. The MyKad must be replaced when a person reaches 18 years old, as it is a requirement that the photograph be \"current\".\n\nAdoption was optional but was spurred by the waiving of the application fee of between RM20 and RM50 until 31 December 2005. As of 27 December 2005, 1,180,208 Malaysians still held an old identity card. After the waiving period ended on 31 December 2005, each new first-time application comes with a fee of RM10.\n\nThe current format of the Malaysian identity card number, introduced in 1990, features 12 digits separated into three block by hyphens, as illustrated below:\n\nThe above format is the official format as printed on the official identity documents e.g. MyKad. However, for database purposes (e.g. sorting), the NRIC Number may have its hyphens omitted, hence:\n\nThe first six digits signify the person's date of birth in the format; for example, a person born on 16 September 1963, would have 630916 as the first six digits of their identity card. A person born on 1 January 1900 would have 000101 as the first digits, same with a person born on 1 January 2000. In cases where the person's actual date of birth according to the Gregorian calendar is uncertain, the date on which the person first applied for a MyKad is used (which becomes the person's birthday for official purposes), noted by an asterisk (*).\n\nPB, the seventh and eighth digit, based on the place of birth of the person, which will be referred from the birth certificate upon application of the MyKad. Policemen and armed forces are assigned with the unique digit, 88 and 99 respectively throughout their term of service. After ending their term of service, they would gain the MyKad with the middle digits based on their place of birth.\n\n<nowiki>###</nowiki>, the ninth through eleventh digit is the generic special number generated by the National Registration Department of Malaysia's computer system.\n\nG, the 12th digit represents the gender of the person. The odd numbers for G denote male while the even numbers denote female.\n\nOn the back of the card, there is an additional 2-digit number after the 12-digit number to indicate the number of MyKad which a person previously held.\n\nPrior to 2001, originally, any person who was born abroad used digit 71 or 72 in their identity card number (High Quality Identity Card), regardless with or without at least one parent with Malaysian citizenship. It is estimated that about 171,023 registered voters who born abroad and used digit 71 or 72 in MyKad. \n\nHowever, since 2001, any baby who was born abroad after 2001 is referred according to their place of birth rather than general digit 71 or 72 in their MyKad. It also affected any person (including citizen or non-citizen) who was born abroad regardless of their year of birth; who applying MyKad without holding High Quality Identity Card after 2001. Despite that, if any person born abroad who already had High Quality Identity Card which means they registered their identity card before 2001, they still retain digit 71 or 72 to be used in their MyKad identity card number. High Quality Identity Card was in use as the Malaysia's identity card from 1990 to 2001. After 2001, a person with High Quality Identity Card is expected to renew their High Quality Identity Card with new MyKad.\n\nThe MyKad project was developed was originally intended to have four functions:\n\nFour further applications were added before or during its initial release,\n\nAt this time, most of the functions are still not widely used because they are not widely promoted.\n\nThe extensible design of the card may be leading to functionality creep. Further applications envisaged by the government include:\n\nMyKad must be carried at all times. Failure to do so may incur a fine of between RM3,000 and RM20,000 or jail term of up to three years.\n\nNo unauthorised people, including security guards, are allowed to retain the MyKads of other people. Only those authorised by the National Registration Department, like the police and immigration officers, can do so.\n\nFor Muslim citizens, \"Islam\" is printed on the card below the picture of the holder. This is to help the enforcement of Shariah law which is only applicable to Muslims.\n\nAs the state of Sabah and Sarawak maintain separate immigration controls, citizens who have permanent residency in the state of Sabah and Sarawak are denoted by the letters \"H\" and \"K\" respectively on the bottom right corner of the card.\n\nMyKad's Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) application allows for two digital certificates to be inserted. MyKad holders can apply and purchase the digital certificates from two of Malaysia's certification authority, MSCTrustgate.com Sdn. Bhd. and DigiCert Sdn. Bhd..\n\nPKI allows for easy securing of private data over public telecommunications networks, thus allowing, secure electronic transactions over the Internet which include:\n\n\nCitizens from Peninsular Malaysia travelling to Sabah and Sarawak can produce a MyKad on arrival to obtain a Document in Lieu of Internal Travel Document (IMM.114) for social and business visits not more than three months. Sabah and Sarawak each maintains a separate immigration control system, and Peninsular Malaysians are subject to immigration control in the two states.\n\nMalaysia and Brunei signed a frequent travellers cards (FTC) agreement on 10 September 2007, allowing Malaysian and Bruneian frequent travellers to register to use their national identity cards for travel between Malaysia and Brunei.\n\nAs Malaysia stopped issuing and renewing Restricted Passports for citizens from Peninsular Malaysia to travel to Singapore beginning 1 January 2005, Malaysia considered negotiating with Singapore to allow frequent Malaysian travellers to enter Singapore using MyKad. However, Singapore rejected the use of MyKad by frequent Malaysian travellers to enter the country, citing security concerns.\n\nThe MyID is a Malaysian Government initiative that implements the National Registration Identity Card Number as the sole reference number for Malaysians in their transactions as an individual with the government agencies.\n\nMyKid is a chip-based children identity card or personal identification document issued to children under the age of 12. Introduced on 1 January 2003, MyKid contains features similar to MyKad except that it does not include a photograph and thumbprint biometric data. For registration of new birth, MyKid will be processed during the application for registration of birth. Children born before 2003 do not get a MyKid.\n\nThe term Kid refers to:\n\nMyKid is issued in pink instead of blue (colour of MyKad). Visible data for MyKid in block letters include:\n\nThe MyKid chip currently stores only three types of data:\n\nBenefits of MyKid:\n\nMyPR is an identity card or personal identification issued to residents of Malaysia with permanent resident status.

The shire covered an area of , and existed as a local government entity from 1888 until 2008, when it amalgamated with councils further north to form the Moreton Bay Region.\n\nThe suburbs formerly within Pine Rivers are generally regarded as part of Greater Brisbane, both in a planning context and for statistical purposes.\n\nThe Shire is named for three rivers contained within it: the Pine River, which empties into Bramble Bay, and its tributaries, the North Pine River and South Pine River. Two large artificial reservoirs, Lake Samsonvale and Lake Kurwongbah, formed its centre. The western half of the shire consisted of the sparsely populated foothills of the D'Aguilar Range, the land being mostly forested or used for grazing cattle and horses. Hays Inlet and Saltwater Creek formed the eastern boundary of the Shire, beyond which lay the City of Redcliffe.\n\nThe main population concentration was in the east and southeast of the shire—the western part, which covered 76% of the shire's land area, contained only 18,309 residents in 2006. The key centres of population were Strathpine, which formed a mini-CBD for the area; Petrie and Kallangur further to the north, and Albany Creek and the Hills District closer to Brisbane's boundary. A new area based around North Lakes in the shire's northeast had also become reasonably established.\n\nThe area was settled by homestead farmers in the mid 19th century. Many suburbs – Lawnton, Petrie, Griffin and Joyner, for example – are named after early European settlers. The first township in the area was established at what is now Petrie in 1868, to service mail coaches between Brisbane and Gympie. The Caboolture railway line reached the shire in 1888. Another railway line to Dayboro, in the western, mountainous areas of the shire was opened in 1920, but due to lack of traffic was closed and lifted in 1955.\n\nDuring the Second World War, large areas of flat land around Brendale and Strathpine were used by Allied forces as airfields and staging areas. It is estimated that around 50,000 Allied servicemen passed through the area, at a time when the civilian population was less than 5000.\n\nCaboolture Division was created on 11 November 1879 as one of 74 divisions around Queensland under the \"Divisional Boards Act 1879\". It was centred on Caboolture, which was at that time a small logging town, and initially covered all of Moreton Bay and much of the Sunshine Coast. On 21 January 1888, the Pine Division split away from the Caboolture Division to become a separate local government area operating under the \"Divisional Boards Act 1887\". Its first divisional board meeting was held on 7 March 1888 at the residence of Henry Thomas Ireland at Albany Creek Mr Ireland was unanimously elected as the board chairman for the year.\n\nThe meetings of the divisional board were held in rented premises at Bald Hill until a meeting hall and office building (now the heritage-listed \"Old Shire Hall\") was constructed Strathpine in 1889.\n\nIn 1897, parts of the Parishes of Samsonvale, Pine and Whiteside were included in the Pine Division.\n\nFollowing the passage of the \"Local Authorities Act 1902\", Pine Division became the Shire of Pine on 31 March 1903. It underwent significant changes in 1921 and 1955, and on 23 May 1959, the Shire of Pine was renamed Shire of Pine Rivers. In March 1960, Council Meetings moved from the original weatherboard Shire Hall to new brick Council Chambers.It then remained with the same name and boundaries for almost 50 years.\n\nOn 15 March 2008, under the \"Local Government (Reform Implementation) Act 2007\" passed by the Parliament of Queensland on 10 August 2007, the Shire of Pine Rivers amalgamated with the Shire of Caboolture and the City of Redcliffe to form the Moreton Bay Region. The Local Government Reform Commission's reasoning was that it would unite all of Brisbane's northern suburbs beyond the Brisbane City boundary into one local government area which would, in its view, simplify and streamline planning, approvals and governance.\n\nThe chairmen and mayors of the division and the shire were:\n\nIn 1993, the \"Local Government Act Number 70\" was introduced; it included that all heads of local government councils should be known as mayors and all other elected representatives were to be known as councillors. Thus Yvonne Chapman was both the first female leader of the council and its only mayor.\n\nOther notable council members include:\n\nIn its final years, the Shire of Pine Rivers was split up into 10 divisions, each electing one councillor to the Shire Council for a four-year term. Additionally, a mayor was elected to represent the entire Shire.\n\n\nThe Shire of Pine Rivers included the following suburbs:\n\n\n – light industrial area<br>\n – newest suburb in the Shire<br>\n\n\n – contained the shire's major landfill, and Alma Park Zoo<br>\n – village and tourist centre\n\n\n"}

Arthur Cohen directed the film, which was produced by Bill Randle himself.\n\nIncluded in the film was live footage shot at several live shows at local high schools and auditoriums in Cleveland, Ohio on and around October 20, 1955. Performers featured included Elvis Presley (several months prior to his first RCA Records recording sessions), Bill Haley and His Comets (still riding high from \"Rock Around the Clock\" topping the US music charts), Pat Boone, LaVern Baker, Roy Hamilton, Johnnie Ray and others. This was the first film Presley ever appeared in, and is the \"movie short\" referred to by Randle when he introduced Presley on his first national TV appearance on \"Stage Show\" in early 1956. It was Bill Haley's second film appearance after his group appeared in the 1954 short film, \"Round Up of Rhythm\".\n\nA plaque commemorating one of the filmed performances is located at Brooklyn High School in Cleveland, and was installed by the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\n\nThe original forty-eight-minute film was supposed to be cut down to a twenty-minute \"short\" for national distribution, but never made it that far. As of 2005, 50 years after it was produced, the movie remains unreleased. There is some dispute over whether or not this film actually exists, although it was shown publicly, albeit only once in Cleveland, and excerpts were also aired on a Cleveland television station in 1956.\n\nAccording to music historian Jim Dawson, Randle, before his death, sold the rights to the film to PolyGram, although it has been reported that Universal Studios has the negatives of the film in its vaults. Marshall Lytle, who was nearing the end of his tenure as bass player for the Comets, corroborates the existence of the film in his memoir, \"Still Rockin' Around the Clock\", and makes the unsubstantiated claim that Colonel Tom Parker, Presley's manager, bought the film and destroyed the existing copies.\nIt has been reported that Elvis was invited to the concert , as he was appearing close by. He was not in the line-up but showed to meet fans. \nIt appears that he did perform - lip syncing to his first record, stretching the show , as one act was running late ; but the camera operator(s) refused to film him , as there was a limited amount of film .\n\n\"Pied Piper of Cleveland\" achieved bizarre notoriety in the 1990s when it was linked to the infamous \"Alien Autopsy\" film circulated by producer Ray Santilli. According to Santilli, he was attempting to obtain a copy of \"Pied Piper\" from a man who claimed to have been the cinematographer on the film. Instead of the rare Elvis film, Santilli claims, the cameraman offered him footage he claimed to have shot in the late 1940s of an alleged autopsy of an alien recovered from one of the UFO crash sites.\n\nThe FOX network produced a popular documentary, \"\" centered on this footage, which was later debunked (by FOX) as being a hoax. This has led to some claims that \"Pied Piper\" is likewise a hoax, however documentation supporting the film's existence predates the Alien Autopsy affair by many years.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1832836", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1832836", "title": "Service reservoirs in Singapore", "text": "Service reservoirs in Singapore\n\nThere are several service reservoirs in Singapore.\n\nChangi Creek Reservoir is a small service reservoir located to the north of Singapore Changi Airport in Singapore. The reservoir supplements and provides backup water supply for the airport. It was formed by damming the headwaters of a small river, Changi Creek, which empties into Sungei Changi and thence into the Serangoon Harbour.\n\nRainfall from the runways and surrounding green areas is collected in the nearby South End Reservoir. Changi Creek Reservoir is used to balance flows during incoming tides and high rainfall.\n\nThe Fort Canning Service Reservoir (Chinese: 福康宁备水池) is an underground reservoir located on top of Fort Canning Hill in Singapore. Construction of the reservoir began on 1 April 1927 on the former site of a large artillery barracks and parade ground to help supplement the large impounding reservoirs. The reservoir was constructed in two sections, the southern section was ready for water storage by 1 August 1928, and the final work completed by the middle of January 1929. Water is pumped from the large reservoirs into the service reservoirs, thus enabling water to flow down the hill into houses.\n\nEarlier service reservoirs were built on Mount Emily (1878), Pearl's Hill (1903), and Bukit Timah Hill. The size of the Fort Canning Reservoir is 30 million gallons.\n\nA spring used to exist on the west side of Fort Canning Hill and served as a source of water in the early days of Singapore. The spring was called \"pancur larangan\" or \"forbidden spring\", where the women of the ruler's household were said to bathe in ancient times. In the early period of the 19th century Singapore, the stream was used to provide clean drinking water for all ships stopping at the port until the demand exceeded the capacity by the 1830, and the spring then dried up as wells were dug around the hill. A cache of Javanese-style gold ornaments dating to the mid-14th century were discovered when workers were excavating for the reservoir at Fort Canning in 1928.\n\nJalan Eunos Service Reservoir is a service reservoir located along Kaki Bukit Avenue 4 in Singapore. It is found in the northern part of Kaki Bukit estate near the Paya Lebar Air Base and is therefore part of the Bedok planning area. The reservoir provides water supply to the eastern regions of Singapore and stores treated water mainly from Bedok Reservoir. It can reportedly hold 22 million gallons/ 100,000 cubic metres of water. Access to this service reservoir is restricted unlike the neighbouring Bedok Reservoir.\n\nJalan Eunos Service Reservoir was first constructed by the British Government in 1956 at an estimated cost of $4 million to improve water pressure in the Geylang, Katong and Changi areas of Singapore, as the Woodleigh Waterworks, constructed in 1912 and still stands today, was inadequate to channel water to the growing population. The reservoir was first expanded in 1971 and was then expanded again in 1974 to increase water supply to the east of Singapore which was developing rapidly and was in need of connection to potable water. As Singapore had gained independence by then, there were also fears that Malaysia would eventually cut off water supply from its reservoirs despite agreements made beforehand. In line with the need for self reliance to provide our own water, Bedok Reservoir was then finally completed in 1985 to provide Jalan Eunos Service Reservoir with even more water especially to the residences residing in the east of Singapore. Redevelopments in the area of Kaki Bukit also saw Jalan Eunos which was once linked to the reservoir no longer anywhere near it.\n\nKallang Service Reservoir, also called Bukit Kalang Service Reservoir, is a service reservoir located within the Central Water Catchment. It is situated south of the Lower Pierce Reservoir, off Island Club Road.\n\nThough called Kallang Service Reservoir, it is located nowhere near to Kallang. It is, however, located within the former Ulu Kallang mukim, as well as within the vicinity of the Bukit Kallang geographic point.\n\nMurnane Service Reservoir is a small service reservoir near the Bukit Timah Expressway and the Pan Island Expressway in Singapore. The reservoir supplements and provides backup water supply for the western regions of Singapore.\n\nThe reservoir was completed in 1956 and is named after D. J. Murnane the longest serving Municipal Water Engineer in Singapore.\n\nThe South End Reservoir is a small service reservoir located to the south of Singapore Changi Airport in Singapore. Rainfall from the runways and surrounding green areas is collected in the reservoir and used for fire-fighting drills and toilet flushing. The reservoir supplies 28–33% of the airport's water and saves the airport around S$390,000 per year. It is linked to the Changi Creek Reservoir to balance flows during incoming tides and high rainfall.\n"}

It covers most of the suburbs of Milwaukee, but not Milwaukee County itself.\n\nWhen it became apparent that 414 was running out of numbers, original plans called for 262 to be an overlay for all of southeastern Wisconsin. However, overlays were a new concept at the time, and met with some resistance to the mixing of area codes in the same area and the ensuing requirement for ten-digit dialing.

Typically, a quarter stick consists of a thick walled cardboard tube containing approximately 1 oz. (28.4 grams) of pyrotechnic flash powder, with a short length of Visco fuse protruding from the side or end of the device. No true standard for dimensions and construction exists, as these devices are products of bootleg manufacturers.\n\nThe term \"quarter stick\" is based on a quarter-stick of dynamite, which it somewhat resembles. However, quarter stick firecrackers do not contain nitroglycerin as dynamite does, and have far less explosive power.\n\nIn the United States, quarter sticks and similar large firecrackers are illegal to manufacture or possess without a BATFE High Explosives Manufacturing License.\n\nThey are sometimes colloquially known as M-1000s or \"block busters\".\n\n\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20120107185413/http://atf.gov/publications/factsheets/factsheet-illegal-explosives-devices.html\n"}

This is in contrast to \"direct electric action\" and \"electro-pneumatic action\", which connect the key to the valve through an electrical link or an electrically assisted pneumatic system respectively, or \"tubular-pneumatic action\" which utilizes a change of pressure within lead tubing which connects the key to the valve pneumatic.\n\nOrgans trace their history as far back as at least the 3rd century BC with an organlike device known as the hydraulis. Also known as a \"water organ\" or \"Roman organ\", the hydraulis was an instrument in which water was used as a source of power to push wind through organ pipes. (It is not to be confused with the hydraulic action of a hydraulophone, an instrument that actually uses water to produce the sound, not just as a source of power). While the control of air pressure was controlled by water pressure, hence the name, the action was a rudimentary form of modern action.\n\nIt was not until the mid-14th century that the action needed to be explored and expanded as finally more pipes were added, as well as the addition of stops, and ultimately multiple cases and keyboards.\n\nThis continued in the 17th and 18th centuries.\nNo particularly great developments took place in the Classical Period.\n\nIn the Romantic Period came a new style of organ building. The organ became larger and louder and pneumatically assisted action became the norm in large instruments, to offset the extreme key weight caused by high wind pressures.\n\nAlthough tracker action was less utilized in the early 20th century, particularly in England and America, its use has enjoyed a strong renaissance in the same areas since World War II, especially in instruments modeled on historical antecedents. Today, many builders are using tracker action throughout the world, and it has been successfully employed in organs of many styles. Some active builders of tracker action organs include Taylor and Boody of Staunton, Virginia, Paul Fritts of Tacoma, Washington, Flentrop Orgelbouw B.V. of Zaandam, the Netherlands, and C. B. Fisk, Inc. of Gloucester, Massachusetts.\n\nCurrently, the world's largest mechanical (tracker) action organ was built by Ronald Sharp in the Concert Hall of the Sydney Opera House, Sydney, Australia, and includes over 10,500 pipes. \n\nThe action consists of many types of devices used for the playing of such said organ, as listed below:\n\nThe above is a list of mechanisms unique to tracker action. Steam calliopes, such as those built by Thomas J. Nichol in the early twentieth century, used a very simplified tracker mechanism. For actions used in all forms of pipe organs, see pipe organ construction.\n\nBecause of construction tolerances, a means of adjustment, or regulation, of the action has to be provided. This is commonly done by having a threaded wire end on the wooden tracker rods. A circular nut varies the effective length of the tracker where it engages with other parts of the action. One objective of correct regulation is that the keys on each manual have the same rest height and distance of travel when pressed. The regulation wrongly set at one extreme can cause a note to sound when no keys are pressed. This may also be caused by the action sticking after the key is released. The other extreme is that notes do not sound, or sound feebly, when a key is pressed.\n\nBesides tracker action, two other kinds of action used in pipe organs are as follows:\n\nCurrently, some organ builders use tracker action in new organs, others use electric action, and still others use either type depending on the instrument. There are builders and organists who have strong feelings regarding the advantages of one type of action over another.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1832862", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1832862", "title": "XPostFacto", "text": "XPostFacto\n\nXPostFacto is an open source utility that enables the installation of PowerPC versions of Mac OS X up to Mac OS X v10.4 (Tiger), and Darwin on some PowerPC-based Apple Macintosh systems that are not officially supported for them by Apple.\n\nXPostFacto - often referred to as \"XPF\" - runs under Mac OS 9 and allows an unmodified Mac OS X installation disc to be launched on machines which cannot boot Mac OS X unaided. This allows Mac OS X to be installed on certain Mac models which could otherwise only run System 7, Mac OS 8 or Mac OS 9, albeit sometimes with incomplete functionality. For example, it can be used to install Mac OS X v10.2 on a PowerPC 604 equipped Power Macintosh 8600 or 9600.\n\nIt also allows more recent versions of Mac OS X to be installed on older G3 Macs which can only officially run earlier versions of OS X - for example, it allows Mac OS X v10.3 and Mac OS X v10.4 to run successfully on Beige G3s, 10.2 having been the last version supported by Apple. It can even facilitate otherwise-awkward installations on supported machines; for instance, it allows Mac OS X v10.4, which shipped on DVD media, to be installed onto a Blue and White G3 with only an external, non-bootable DVD drive. Likewise, Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger ended support for machines that lacked built-in FireWire ports, these being the original iMac G3s and iBook G3s, but XPostFacto allows the use of 10.4 on them.\n\nThe name is a pun on \"ex post facto\", a Latin phrase meaning \"after the fact\", commonly used in legal matters to refer to retroactive actions applying a later state of affairs (such as legislation) to earlier situations. In this context, it refers to the installation of software which did not exist yet at the time the hardware was manufactured: it retroactively \"applies\" Mac OS X to pre-existing hardware.\n\nThis software engineering feat by developer Ryan Rempel is made possible by the publication of the source code for Darwin, the open-source foundation of Mac OS X.\n\nXPF's functionality is achieved via three different routes. The program provides a replacement boot loader for Macs with OldWorld firmware, provides a set of kernel modules to allow the Mac OS X kernel to support various pieces of system hardware which are unsupported in the retail release, and includes a mechanism to transparently boot the kernel off a supported medium - termed a \"helper drive\", such as the internal hard disk - even when installing Mac OS X to or from a non-bootable volume, such as a USB optical drive or a hard disk which is unsupported by the kernel or system firmware.\n\nXPF does not support all models of Power Macintosh. Only certain PCI-based models with Open Firmware will work. It does not support NuBus-based PowerMacs.\n\nOnce Mac OS X has been installed, XPF also runs under that operating system. On unsupported machines, XPF should be used instead of Apple's \"Startup Disk\" control panel or system preference pane to select whether the Mac should boot into Mac OS X or an older version.\n\nAlthough experimental versions of XPF were available before the release of Mac OS X v10.2, v10.3 and v10.4, no version was available at the time of the release of v10.5 and XPF 4 does not support Mac OS X v10.5. XPostFacto is not required to run v10.5 on unsupported Macs as long as they have a G4 processor and AGP graphics, the official requirement of an 867 MHz G4 processor only needs to be bypassed at the time of installation and once installed Leopard will run without problems or requiring XPostFacto. On Macs that have only PCI graphics though, such as the Beige G3, the version of XPostFacto intended for use with OS X 10.4 needs to be used in order to boot 10.5 successfully (provided that it has been upgraded to a G4 processor as Leopard will not run at all on G3s), although it cannot be used to actually install the operating system as it does not recognise the 10.5 DVD (another machine would have to be used for the installation and then the hard drive transferred into the unsupported machine).\n\n"}

As the President of the United Nations General Assembly from September 2008 to September 2009, he presided over the 63rd Session of the United Nations General Assembly. He was also nominated as Libyan Representative to the UN in March 2011. He died on 8 June 2017, having suffered a stroke several months earlier.\n\nD'Escoto was born in Los Angeles, California. on February 5, 1933. His father was Miguel Escoto Muñoz, a Nicaraguan diplomat. His mother was Margarita Brockmann Meléndez. Through his father Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann was descended from Nazario Escoto, acting president of Nicaragua in 1855. He was then raised in Nicaragua but was sent back to the United States to begin his high school studies in 1947.\n\nD'Escoto felt called to serve as priest and entered the seminary of the Maryknoll Missionary Society in 1953. He was ordained a priest of the Society in 1961 before becoming engaged in politics. He earned a Master of Science degree from the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism the following year, and was a key figure in the founding of the Maryknoll publishing house, Orbis Books, in 1970. He served as an official of the World Council of Churches. As an adherent of liberation theology, he secretly joined the Sandinistas. D'Escoto formed the Nicaraguan Foundation for Integral Community Development (FUNDECI) in January 1973 to promote a nongovernmental response to the displacement of thousands in the December 1972 Managua earthquake. He continued on as President of FUNDECI, which operates in several departments in Nicaragua until his death in 2017.\n\nOn August 5, 2014, the Vatican announced that Pope Francis had reinstated D'Escoto as a priest after he had been suspended for thirty years for taking up office in Nicaragua's left-wing Sandinista government. D'Escoto had been banned from celebrating Mass by Pope John Paul II for defying a church ban on priests holding political office. D'Escoto served as Nicaragua's foreign minister from 1979 to 1990. He welcomed the news and said his punishment had been unfair. D'Escoto, 81, had written to Pope Francis asking to be allowed to celebrate Mass before he died.\n\nD'Escoto first publicly expressed support for the FSLN as one of \"Los Doce\", in October 1977, and was appointed foreign minister after the Sandinista triumph in 1979. He served as foreign minister in Daniel Ortega's FSLN government from 1979 to 1990. During a visit to Central America, Pope John Paul II publicly admonished him for his political activity.\n\nIn 1985, the pope denounced him and two other priests, the brothers Ernesto and Fernando Cardenal. All three served in the Nicaraguan government but did not resign from office and so in violation of canon law. D'Escoto was suspended by the Holy See in 1985, together with the two other priests. The suspension stayed in place until August 2014, when Pope Francis lifted it.\n\nEarly in the war, the Reagan administration perceived D'Escoto as a relative moderate who might break with the regime. As foreign minister, D'Escoto received the Lenin Peace Prize in 1985 and 1986 and the Thomas Merton Award in 1987. In 1999, then Archbishop of Managua, Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo, criticized the priests who became involved with the Sandinistas and abandoned their priestly ministry for politics. He said the priests never denounced the injustices that took place at the time.\n\nOn March 3, 1986, D'Escoto gave a speech on Nicaraguan television publicly insulting and condemning Cardinal Obando for not siding with the Sandinista regime against the Contras: \"There is no word uttered by human mouth, no adjective that we could use to truly describe the horror produced by this brother of ours.\"\n\nAfter the Sandinistas lost the 1990 Nicaraguan general election, D'Escoto led the Communal Movement but resigned that post in December 1991 after his support within the organization waned. He supported Daniel Ortega against the Sandinista Renovation Movement dissidents.\n\nThe Latin American and Caribbean Group selected him as their candidate to become the president of the UN General Assembly. On June 4, 2008, he was elected by acclamation to preside over 63rd Session of the United Nations General Assembly from September 2008 to September 2009.\n\nShortly after his election, D'Escoto stated during a press conference:\n\nD'Escoto stated that addressing rising energy and food prices around the world would be priorities. His other priorities would include hunger, poverty, climate change, terrorism, human rights, disarmament, nuclear control, cultural diversity, the rights of women and children and the protection of biodiversity. He designated 16 senior advisers: Brother David Andrews, C.S.C. (USA), Maude Barlow (Canada), Mohammed Bedjaoui (Algeria), Leonardo Boff (Brazil), Kevin Cahill (USA), François Houtart (Belgium), Noam Chomsky (USA), Ramsey Clark (USA), Richard Falk (USA), Michael Kennedy (USA), Eleonora Kennedy (USA), Olivier De Schutter (Belgium), Joseph Stiglitz (USA), Sir John E. Sulston (UK), Francisco Lacayo Parajón (Nicaragua) and Howard Zinn (USA).\n\nIn June 2010, D'Escoto was elected by acclamation to the Council Advisory Committee to the United Nations Human Rights Council.\n\nD'Escoto criticised the veto power wielded by the permanent members of the United Nations Security Council. Therein he said \"I hope my presidency will address what has become a universal clamour all over the world for the democratisation of the United Nations. I promise to give full support to the working group on the revitalisation of the General Assembly.\"\n\nDescribed by Reuters as \"a fierce critic of the foreign relations of the United States (he referred to Ronald Reagan in 2004 as \"the butcher of my people\"): \"Because of Reagan and his spiritual heir George W. Bush, the world today is far less safe and secure than it has ever been.\"\n\nFollowing his election to the presidency of the United Nations General Assembly, he offered a statement interpreted as renewed criticism aimed at the United States: \"The behavior of some member states has caused the United Nations to lose credibility as an organisation capable of putting an end to war and eradicating extreme poverty from our planet.\" He denounced what he called \"acts of aggression, such as those occurring in Iraq and Afghanistan.\" However, he expressed his \"love\" for \"the United States as a country\" and added: \"I do not want to turn this General Assembly presidency into a place to take it out on the United States.\" Reacting to those comments, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Zalmay Khalilzad responded: \"We have been assured that a page has been turned and that he understands his new responsibilities... We will wait and see.\" Richard Grenell, spokesman for the U.S. Mission to the United Nations, added: \"The president of the General Assembly is supposed to be a uniter. We have made it clear that these crazy comments are not acceptable, and we hope he refrains from this talk and gets to work on General Assembly business.\" However, Mark Kornblau, spokesman for the United States Mission to the United Nations, said: \"It's hard to make sense of Mr. D'Escoto's increasingly bizarre statements.\"\n\nOn September 17, 2008, Israel's Ambassador to the U.N Gabriela Shalev called D'Escoto an \"Israel-hater\" because D'Escoto \"hugged\" Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad after Ahmedinedjad's strongly anti-Israel and anti-Zionist September 2008 speech to the UN General Assembly. She expressed anger over the UN reception of Ahmedinedjad, saying to an Israeli newspaper: \"I heard that the Iranian president's address was followed by loud applause, and that d'Escoto warmly embraced him.\" D'Escoto's spokesman responded by saying: \"He cannot respond to each and every speech made by the leaders of these states.\" The Israeli ambassador also criticised D'Escoto for attending a dinner marking the end of the Islamic fasting month of Ramadan with a number of Middle Eastern leaders, including Ahmadinejad. D'Escoto's spokesman responded by saying: \"[D'Escoto] will join the dinner because he believes in dialogue, an issue which he had highlighted, and thinks that he should deal with all member states.\"\n\nOn March 29, 2011, during the 2011 Libyan civil war, Libyan Foreign Minister Moussa Koussa wrote to United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki Moon, nominating d'Escoto as Libya’s new ambassador to the UN. The letter stated that he was nominated, as Ali Treki, also a former General Assembly president who was Libya's first choice, was denied a visa to enter the United States under United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973. US ambassador Susan Rice claimed that he did not possess the proper diplomatic visa to represent Libya and suggested Mussa Kussa's recommendation might be void because of his resignation on March 30 from the Libyan government.\n\nOn June 8, 2017, Brockmann at the age of 84 after suffering a stroke several months earlier. Arrangements for his funeral were still pending by June 13 2017. Eventually, he was buried in the Cementerio General in Managua.\n\n"}

Albert Brooks guest stars in the episode, playing the character Tab Spangler, as well as briefly reprising Jacques from \"Life on the Fast Lane\".\n\n\"The Heartbroke Kid\" is the 352nd episode in the program's history and was broadcast straight after the 351st episode, \"Don't Fear the Roofer\", on the Fox network in the United States.\n\nPrincipal Skinner is looking for a company to sign a vending machine contract with Springfield Elementary, with half of the machine's profits going to the school. He looks at suggestions of a gumbo machine from the Sea Captain that seriously burned the Sea Captain's hand and a request box from Gil and rejects them, until he gets a suggestion from Lindsey Naegle. The unhealthy vending machines sponsored by hip-hop artists are installed, and most of the students use the machines (save for Lisa, who protests their extremely high sugar content and artificial additives), but Bart is seen using it the most frequently. Due to the high fat and sugar content in the snacks, and due to the high frequency of their consumption, three weeks later, Bart significantly gains weight and becomes obese, and during an in-show parody of the opening credits, he suffers a heart attack after slowly trying to make it home from school.\n\nBart sees Dr. Hibbert, who says that malted milk balls have clogged his arteries, and that a wad of Laffy Taffy is blocking his liver. He informs the family that Bart is addicted to junk food and tells Marge to put him on a diet. However, Lisa discovers that Bart has been hiding junk food in his walls, and the family stages an intervention. When Bart tries to run away, due to his widened and obese frame, he gets stuck in a fence and is caught by two representatives of a maximum security fat camp, Serenity Ranch. Bart ends up there with Apu, Rainier Wolfcastle (who was last seen fattening up for a movie), and Kent Brockman, and the camp's leader is none other than former junk food magnate Tab Spangler (who is dealing with many anger issues). However, when Bart is there, the family is faced with an expensive bill. To pay for the camp, the family converts their house into a youth hostel, which attracts German tourists.\n\nAt the fat camp, Bart cheats by sneaking food, so Tab Spangler takes him home to visit the family to show him the horrors that occur. His family is working continually to appease the students staying in their home. The Germans humiliate the family, making Homer dance for change and forcing Marge and Lisa to clean intentional messes while pointing out America's problems one by one. He suggests Bart fight his addiction, and he does, by destroying the vending machines in school. His addiction to junk food is over, and he steals the money from the vending machines, which the family uses to pay for the bill and give the Germans \"Das Boot\". Homer gets revenge by beating up the Germans, and tossing them out. Tab Spangler says that Bart still has three weeks left of non-refundable treatment, and Homer goes with Tab (by force from the family), where the episode ends with them driving in Tab's car arguing over the cheeseburger Homer is eating.\n\nAlbert Brooks guest starred in the episode as Bart's fitness instructor at fat camp in his fifth appearance on the show.

The electronic copies were responsible for 20,409 of that number, according to the Oklahoman article published Dec. 27, 2018.\n\nThe newspaper was founded in 1889 by Sam Small and taken over in 1903 by Edward K. Gaylord. Gaylord would run the paper for 71 years. Upon his death, the paper was turned over to his son and later to his granddaughter. It was announced on September 15, 2011 that all Oklahoma Publishing Company (OPUBCO) assets, including \"The Oklahoman\", would be sold to Denver based businessman Philip Anschutz and his Anschutz Corporation. The sale of OPUBCO to Philip Anschutz closed in October 2011, and the Oklahoma Publishing Company remained independent in operation. Other Anschutz owned newspapers include \"The Gazette (Colorado Springs)\" and \"The Washington Examiner\". On September 27, 2018, it was announced that Anschutz had sold The Oklahoman Media Company to GateHouse Media for $12.5 million. Anschutz would retain OPUBCO and its remaining non-newspaper assets with lay-offs impacting management, reporters, and BigWing, The Oklahoman's digital marketing agency. The most recent sale of The Oklahoman transaction closed October 1, 2018, with the paper published October 2, 2018 (Volume 127,275) being the first to show GateHouse Media as the copyright owner. On Nov. 11, 2019 GateHouse Media and Gannett announced GateHouse Media would be acquiring Ganett and taking the Gannett name. The acquisition closed on November 19, 2019.\n\nThe Oklahoma Publishing Company (OPUBCO) which owned The Oklahoma until 2018,was headquartered at NW 4 and Broadway in downtown Oklahoma City until 1991, when it moved to a 12 story tower at Broadway Extension and Britton Road in the northern part of the city. That building was sold to American Fidelity Assurance in 2012. Office space was then leased back to OPUBCO until plans were finalized for the company to move its headquarters. After a 23-year absence, \"The Oklahoman\" staff (and most OPUBCO employees) moved back to downtown Oklahoma City in early 2015. The new offices of The Oklahoman are located in leased office space downtown at 100 W. Main in the existing Century Center office building (connected to the Sheraton Hotel) in downtown Oklahoma City. Printing and production were halted at the existing facility on Broadway Extension and Britton Road as \"The Oklahoman\" began outsourcing printing press production to The Tulsa World in 2016.\n\nFounded in 1889 in Oklahoma City by Sam Small, \"The Daily Oklahoman\" was taken over in 1903 by The Oklahoma Publishing Company (OPUBCO), controlled by Edward K. Gaylord, also known as E. K. Gaylord. In 1916, OPUBCO purchased the failing \"Oklahoma Times\" and operated it as an evening newspaper for the next 68 years. E. K. Gaylord died at the age of 101, having controlled the newspaper for the previous 71 years. Management of the newspaper passed to his son, Edward L. Gaylord, who managed the newspaper from 1974 to 2003. Christy Gaylord Everest, daughter of Edward L. Gaylord and granddaughter of E. K. Gaylord, was the company's chairwoman and CEO until 2011. Christy Everest was assisted by her sister Louise Gaylord Bennett until the sale of the company in 2011 to Philip Anschutz. The current CEO of OPUBCO is Gary Pierson, and OPUBCO is no longer owner or affiliated with The Oklahoman since the 2018 sale. Gary served as COO for OPUBCO under Christy Everest. In 2018 Philip Anschutz sold The Oklahoman Media Company portion of OPUBCO, which included The Oklahoman, NewsOK.com, BigWing and The Oklahoman Direct, to GateHouse Media marking the first time in the newspaper's history that it would be owned by a publicly-traded company.\n\nIn 1928, E. K. Gaylord bought Oklahoma's first radio station, WKY. More than 20 years later, he signed on Oklahoma's first television station, WKY-TV (now KFOR-TV). The two stations would be the anchors of a broadcasting empire that, at its height, included six television stations and five radio stations. Nearly all of the Gaylord broadcasting interests would be sold off by 1996, though \"The Oklahoman\" held onto WKY radio until 2002.\n\nIn 1939, Charles George Werner, a rookie political cartoonist at the newspaper, won the Pulitzer Prize for Editorial Cartooning. The winning cartoon, \"\", depicted the Nobel Peace Prize resting on a grave marked \"Czechoslovakia 1919–1938\". Published on October 6, 1938, the cartoon bit at the recently concluded Munich Agreement, which transferred the Sudetenland (a strategically important part of Czechoslovakia) to Nazi Germany. Another notable cartoonist for the paper was Jim Lange, who worked for the paper for 58 years and produced over 19,000 cartoons.\n\nThe last edition of the evening \"Oklahoma Times\" was published on Feb. 29, 1984. It was folded into \"The Daily Oklahoman\" beginning with the March 1, 1984, issue. A 1998 \"American Journalism Review\" survey acknowledged \"The Oklahoman\"'s positive contributions as a corporate citizen of Oklahoma, but characterized the paper as suffering from understaffing, uninspired content, and political bias. In 1999, the \"Columbia Journalism Review\" published an article calling \"The Oklahoman\" the \"Worst Newspaper in America\"; the \"CJR\" cited the paper's conformance to the right-wing political views of the Gaylord family, alleged racist hiring practices, and high costs of ads. In more recent years OPUBCO Communications Group has won a number of awards for innovations, newspaper redesign, First Amendment coverage, sports coverage, breaking news and in-depth multimedia projects.\n\nIn October 2003, \"The Daily Oklahoman\" was renamed \"The Oklahoman\" with OPUBCO and future owner GateHouse Media officially retaining the registered trademarks of \"The Daily Oklahoman\", \"The Sunday Oklahoman\", and \"The Oklahoma City Times\" to this day.\n\n\"The Oklahoman\" was formerly available for delivery statewide, but in November 2008 it announced that it was reducing its circulation area to cover approximately two-thirds of the state (Oklahoma City and points west), and that it would no longer be available for delivery in Tulsa, Oklahoma's second-largest city. The change reduced the paper's circulation by about 7,000 homes. In January 2009, \"The Oklahoman\" and the \"Tulsa World\" announced a content-sharing agreement in which each paper would carry some content created by the other; the papers also said they would \"focus on reducing some areas of duplication, such as sending reporters from both \"The Oklahoman\" and the \"World\" to cover routine news events.\" In 2010, \"The Oklahoman\" introduced the first iPad app for a newspaper/multimedia company of its size in the United States. As of November 2019, the development of the iPad app appears to have been abandoned with the last update published one month prior to the acquisition by GateHouse. Post-acquisition reviews of the app are largely negative.\n\nIn 2016, the paper announced that it would lay off 130 employees and shut down its Oklahoma City printing plant. The newspaper outsourced printing and packaging work to the facility of the \"Tulsa World\". Pre-production and layout services were sourced to the GateHouse Media owned Center for News and Design in Austin, Texas As of late 2018, the former production plant at Broadway Extension and Britton Road, at one time the largest newspaper printing facility in Oklahoma, had been razed by the site's new owner, American Fidelity Assurance.\n\nLike most U.S. newspapers, \"The Oklahoman\" has seen a decline of 42.3% in daily circulation and 34.8% drop in Sunday circulation from 2007 to the end of 2012. Figures from the Alliance for Audited Media (formerly Audit Bureau Circulation) show that daily subscriptions dropped from 195,399 to 112,733 and Sunday subscriptions dropped from 264,524 to 172,415.\n\nIn December 2017, The Oklahoman launched a premium quarterly magazine titled The OK (pronounced 'oak'). This magazine was bundled with Sunday editions of The Oklahoman as well as distributed via newsstands. Each issue would cover a different topic including food, travel, or health with the final issue of the year being a photography centric issue.\n\nLook At OKC was launched in 2006 as a weekly alt magazine to compete with the Oklahoma Gazette. It was distributed in free racks throughout the Oklahoma City metro area until it was quietly discontinued with the final issue being published June 28, 2018.\n\nNewsOK was originally launched on August 19, 2001 as a joint venture between KWTV-DT and The Oklahoman, however, OPUBCO would obtain full control of NewsOK in 2008. NewsOK would continue to serve as OPUBCO's online news brand and the 'OK' branding would be expanded to other online properties including HomesOK, CarsOK, and JobsOK. However, due to market confusion and a desire to have a unified brand across print and digital media, The Oklahoman announced it would retire the NewsOK brand and redirect all NewsOK.com URLs to Oklahoman.com on May 22, 2019. As of October 17, 2019, nearly 5 months after the brand was retired, the NewsOK brand could still be seen at Oklahoman.com including as the site's favicon and branding within several sections of the website including Autos, BrandInsight, Homes, Obituaries, Local A&E, Parties Extra, Videos, Shop, Privacy Policy, and Terms of Use.\n\nIn November 2019, while attempting to merge the @NewsOK and @TheOklahoman Twitter handles, The Oklahoman lost control of both handles to an unknown third party. This forced the newspaper to begin using @TheOklahoman_ as its official Twitter handle.\n\nSeptember 27, 2018: Immediately following the announcement of the sale of The Oklahoman Media Company to GateHouse Media, publisher Chris Reen was replaced by interim publisher Jim Hopson.\n\nDecember 18, 2018: Editor Kelly Dyer Fry was announced to replace Jim Hopson as publisher. She would also retain her roles as editor and vice president of news.\n\nJanuary 1, 2019: The newspaper again further reduced its circulation area resulting in the loss of home delivery service to 7,000 subscribers. Additionally, all newspaper vending machines including those located outside of The Oklahoman's corporate offices were removed. Oklahoma City, Edmond, Midwest City, Yukon, Piedmont, Norman, Moore, and Mustang would still receive regular home delivery service.\n\nFebruary 5, 2019: The print edition of \"The Oklahoman\" underwent its first redesign since 2008. This redesign was a cost-reduction measure to allow the paper to fit into GateHouse Media's existing template. Some noticeable changes included a different headline font and the relocation of the daily prayer from page 1 to page 2.\n\nAugust 7, 2019: \"The Oklahoman\" rescinded a job offer it had made to a beat writer hired to cover Oklahoma State University athletics. The story gained significant attention among industry publications and was a prelude to a larger round of layoffs which would occur in the following week.\n\nAugust 13, 2019: A round of layoffs occurred throughout GateHouse Media properties including 14 employees at \"The Oklahoman\" Both the news staff and the digital agency, BigWing, were impacted. These layoffs occurred in the week following GateHouse announcing its intent to acquire Gannett which resulted in a sharp decline in GateHouse's parent company's stock price as investors reacted to the announcement. Many media outlets speculated this round of layoffs to be a direct effort to increase stock prices and appease shareholders.\n\nMarch 13, 2020: Parent company Gannett announced mandatory unpaid furloughs for the entire organization including The Oklahoman and its digital agency, BigWing. These furloughs were in response to declining revenues during the COVID-19 pandemic. Furloughs were announced as a \"collective sacrifice\" and scheduled to last through June 2020. Salary cuts were also announced, however, it is unclear how many in the organization were impacted.\n\nApril 24, 2020: Parent company Gannett quietly laid off staff from newspapers across the organization. The layoffs impacted The Oklahoman's newsroom including a writer, photographer, and sports journalist. It was unclear if these layoffs were planned following the acquisition of Gannett by GateHouse Media or in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1832887", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1832887", "title": "With Fire and Sword (film)", "text": "With Fire and Sword (film)\n\nWith Fire and Sword (; , Vohnem i Mechem) is a 1999 Polish historical drama film directed by Jerzy Hoffman. The film is based on the novel \"With Fire and Sword\", the first part in The Trilogy of Henryk Sienkiewicz.\nAt the time of its filming it was the most expensive Polish film ever made.\n\nThe story is set in Ukrainian lands of the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland during the Khmelnytsky Uprising of the mid-17th century. A Polish noble, Skrzetuski, and a Cossack otaman Bohun, both fall in love with the same woman, Helena. Their rivalry unfolds against the backdrop of a Cossack uprising led by Bohdan Khmelnytsky, aimed at reclaiming control of the land from the hands of the Polish nobles. Historic events form a framework for an action and character driven plot, and fictional characters mingle with historic ones. The movie, as the book, culminates with the savage siege of Zbarazh.\n\n\nThe movie has been criticized for introducing some factual inaccuracies not found in the source material. One of the least accurate sections of the film is Hoffman's presentation of the first battle between the Poles and the Cossacks - the Battle of Zhovti Vody. The movie suggests that the Poles were quickly routed by Cossacks and the Polish elite cavalry (husaria) showed needless bravado in the face of unfavorable weather conditions. In reality, the Poles were not only greatly outnumbered, especially after they were deserted by all the Cossacks who had switched sides and joined Bohdan Khmelnytsky, but also their commander, Stefan Potocki, was only 24 years old; despite that the battle, though eventually lost by the Poles, lasted for nearly three weeks.\n\nThe original book is often deemed to be nationalistic and Ukrainophobic, especially in Ukraine. The movie on the other hand has been praised for its depiction of Ukraine and Ukrainians as \"\"vivid rather than monochromatic; they are multi-dimensional, eliciting more than one feeling of, say, fascination or dislike\"\". However, some Polish reviewers felt that the movie emphasized Cossacks' successes and positive traits while diminishing those of the Poles, in the spirit of political correctness.\n\nThe director was aware of the controversies and criticism. He was quoted as saying:\n\"Sienkiewicz's book is still considered anti-Ukrainian by some Ukrainians. I understand that problem, but when I was in Kiev at a conference of Ukrainian intellectuals ... many people with whom I spoke had read the novel closely and they quoted whole passages where Sienkiewicz criticized the Polish nobles as strongly as the Cossacks. For both sides it was clear that the result of this tragic conflict was the eventual demise of both the Commonwealth and the Sich. I am well aware that the film may agitate those in Ukraine who blame everything on the Poles, and in Poland those who blame all that was bad on the Ukrainians. My film will certainly not convince any radicals. ... My film finishes with the final words of Sienkiewicz's novel: \"Hatred poisoned the hearts of two brother nations\"\".\n\nAlthough the original novel is the first part of the Trilogy, the film was the last part of Hoffman's version of the trilogy to be made, following \"The Deluge\", which was filmed in 1974, and \"Colonel Wolodyjowski\", which was filmed in 1969. This might have been due to political tension between Polish People's Republic and Ukrainian SSR, as filming a novel taking up a politically loaded subject of Polish-Ukrainian relations (another stalled film project was \"Taras Bulba\" by Nikolai Gogol) was deemed undesired by the Soviet Union.\n\nThe film turned out to be a box office success grossing PLN 105,089,363($26,366,071) against a budget of PLN 24,000,000($8,000,000).\n\n"}

At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 89, based on 18 reviews, which indicates \"universal acclaim\".\n\nScott Plagenhoef of \"Pitchfork\" gave the album a very favorable review, stating, \"The most beloved indie pop band since The Smiths, Belle and Sebastian are also probably the best. This collection would work like their own \"Hatful of Hollow\" and \"Louder Than Bombs\" were the first half not sadly missing their early BBC Sessions, and the second forced to omit their \"Dear Catastrophe Waitress\" singles and Peel Session tracks. As it stands, the first is a testament to the power and pull of one the most singular and instantly lovable pop bands of our time; the second is a gentle suggestion that they took the correct post-mainstream fame steps after all, avoiding self-parody (see: Morrissey) and finding a way to be playful without becoming too precious (see: Lawrence in his post-Felt years). In combination, it's a perfect way into the world of Belle and Sebastian, even if the band spends the second half of the disc trying to redecorate that space.\"\n"}

Containing entries for 32,293 Japanese words in Portuguese, it was the first dictionary of Japanese to a European language.\n\nOnly four copies of the original 1603 edition exist. Facsimile editions were published in Japan in 1960 by Iwanami Shoten and again in 1973 and 1975 by Bensey Publishing. The Bensey reproduction is generally considered the clearer and more legible. A 1630 translation into Spanish published in Manila, an 1869 translation into French, and a 1980 translation into Japanese (by Iwanami Shoten) also exist. There is no translation into English.\n\nThe Society of Jesus (commonly known as the Jesuits), with the cooperation of Japanese people, compiled the dictionary over several years. They intended it to serve the need of missionaries for language study and research. The Portuguese priest João Rodrigues is supposed to have been the main organizer of the project and its editor: having already published works like \"Arte da Lingoa de Iapam\" (\"Arte da Língua do Japão\" in modern Portuguese; \"Art of the Language of Japan\" in English) and \"Arte breue da lingoa Iapoa\" (\"Arte breve da Língua Japonesa\" in modern Portuguese; \"Brief Art of the Japanese Language\" in English) explaining the Japanese language for missionaries, he was known among the Portuguese community as having the highest proficiency in Japanese.\n\nThe approximately 32,000 entries are arranged alphabetically. Each word is displayed in the Latin alphabet according to Portuguese conventions of the late sixteenth century, and explained in Portuguese.\n\nThe dictionary's primary purpose was to teach missionaries spoken Japanese. As needed, the authors identify such things as regional dialect, written and spoken forms, women's and children's language, elegant and vulgar words, and Buddhist vocabulary. Many of these words had never been written in any known text before the \"Nippo Jisho\" was published. The system of romanization used by the \"Nippo Jisho\" also reflects the phonetics of 16th-century Japanese (Late Middle Japanese), which is not identical to modern Japanese. Both these points provide present-day linguists valuable insight into the Japanese language of the Sengoku period of Japanese history and how it has evolved into its modern form. The dictionary also yields information on rhyming words, individual pronunciation, meaning, usage, names of plants and animals, popular phrases, and customs of the times.\n\nBecause this dictionary contains the earliest known written example of many words, Japanese language dictionaries often cite it as a primary source, such as the 14-volume \"Nihon Kokugo Daijiten\" (), known in English as \"Shogakukan's Japanese Dictionary\", published by Shogakukan.\n\nThe creators of the \"Nippo Jisho\" devised a system of transcription for the 16th century Japanese language with contemporary Portuguese Roman letters. Take the following example from Michael Cooper's review of the \"Jisho\" in the journal \"Monumenta Nipponica\" in 1976.\n\nRegional differences between Kyūshū and Kyoto speech are often noted, with preference given to the latter. \"\"Qinchacu.\"\" (modern \"kinchaku\" ) A purse carried in the sash. In Ximo (Shimo, present-day Kyūshū) it is called \"\"Fōzō\"\" (modern \"hōzō\" 宝蔵).\n\nIn this example the syllable modernly romanized as \"ki\" () was transcribed 'qi', \"ku\" () as 'cu', and the syllable group \"ha\", \"hi\", \"fu\", \"he\" and \"ho\" () were written 'fa', 'fi', 'fu', 'fe', and 'fo' respectively. Also the syllable \"o\" () was written 'vo', \"tsu\" () was 'tçu', \"shi\" () was 'xi', and \"e\" () was sometimes 'ye'. To what extent these particular idiosyncrasies of spelling reflect how Japanese was actually pronounced in the 16th century is of great interest to scholars of Japanese historical linguistics.\n\nOther examples:\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1832917", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1832917", "title": "Live Songs", "text": "Live Songs\n\nLive Songs is Leonard Cohen's first live album, released during the three-year silence between \"Songs of Love and Hate\" and \"New Skin for the Old Ceremony\".\n\nIt was not until after the release of Cohen's second album, \"Songs From a Room\" in 1969, that the singer reluctantly agreed to tour. As recounted in Ira Nadel's 1996 biography \"Various Positions\", Cohen's first major singing appearance at a Town Hall rally in New York City for the National Committee for a Sane Nuclear Policy in April, 1967 had not gone well; he played a few bars of \"Suzanne\" and walked off, stricken with stage fright, only to be coaxed back on stage to finish the song by a sympathetic audience. Cohen finally bowed to the pressure to tour in 1970 but restricted himself to Europe, where his popularity was much higher than in the United States. Cohen would return to Europe again in 1972 and 1974. According to Anthony Reynolds book \"Leonard Cohen: A Remarkable Life\", Cohen asked Bob Johnston, who had produced \"Songs From a Room\", to assemble the band and play keyboards on the tour: \"I ended up on the tour almost by accident,\" Reynolds quotes Johnston. \"He asked me to manage him; then he asked me to get his band together. Getting ready, I had said to Cohen, 'Man, I'll get you the best piano player in the world.' 'No, I want you,' Leonard insisted. I protested: 'I can't play piano. I can bang around, but I can't play, and you've got great musicians here. They're wonderful people.' 'Either you come and play, or I won't go' was Cohen's response. I thought, 'Hell, I'm not gonna miss this.' So we started off. I just played piano and guitar and organ, whatever. I couldn't play very well, but he couldn't sing very well.\"\n\nCohen is backed by a medium-sized, country-influenced group nicknamed The Army, which includes guitarist Ron Cornelius, guitarist/fiddler Charlie Daniels and vocalist \"Jennifer Warren\", who would soon become famous as Jennifer Warnes and a popular interpreter of Cohen's songs. Speaking to \"Mojo\" in November 2001, Cohen said of the female singers that supported him in concert, \"I need them. I think my voice sounds better when I am somewhat obscured with the sounds of people who can actually sing. I have never had much competence. Personally when I listen to my songs, I'm always more comfortable when my voice is surrounded by harmonies, which to me would naturally suggest the female voice. I need to hear harmonies so that I can just find the pitch.\" In 2009, Cohen explained further during an interview on the CBC Radio show \"Q\": \"I was very much influenced by women's background voices...I like those songs that had that feel. Those are the songs of the fifties. So those were the sounds I wanted to try to reproduce. Also, my own voice sounded so disagreeable to me when I listened to it that I really needed the sweetening of women's voices behind me.\"\n\nOnly two songs from his 1970 tour are featured, including the 13-minute \"Please Don't Pass Me By (A Disgrace),\" which was recorded in London, and \"Tonight Will Be Fine,\" which Cohen sang at the Isle of Wight. The latter was performed in front of 600,000 people under trying circumstances; Cohen was awoken at 4 am in his trailer and took the stage in his pajamas (which were hidden beneath a raincoat) to face an unruly, largely stoned audience that had just watched Jimi Hendrix perform and had been sitting in their own squalor for several days. Cohen's mystical performance, which is now considered one of the highlights of the show, calmed the crowd, with Bob Johnston marveling later on the \"Leonard Cohen Live at the Isle of Wight 1970\" DVD, \"I think Leonard is probably the best performer in the world. I never saw anybody that did what he did...It was a whole festival with 600,000 people there and he took it over, he captured it the last night there.\"\n\nThe album consists mostly of reinterpretations of songs (often with additional or significantly altered lyrics) from Cohen's second LP \"Songs From a Room\" taken from the 1972 European tour. At the beginning of a Paris, France performance of \"Bird on the Wire\", Cohen recites the first verse of a French translation of the song's lyric. \"Nancy\" is a version of \"Seems So Long Ago, Nancy\", while \"Improvisation\" is an extended instrumental guitar trio version of the vamp from \"You Know Who I Am\", which is also featured. The other tracks are a cover of the folk standard \"Passing Through\", and \"Minute Prologue\". A \"bonus\" track, \"Queen Victoria\", was recorded by Cohen alone in his Tennessee hotel room in 1972. Neither \"Songs of Leonard Cohen\" nor the then-recent \"Songs of Love and Hate\" (which featured a live track, \"Let's Sing Another Song, Boys\", culled from the Isle of Wight performance) are represented. The 1972 European tour, from which most of the selections on \"Live Songs\" are taken, is covered extensively in the 1974 Tony Palmer documentary \"Bird on the Wire\".\n\nThe album cover features an unsmiling Cohen staring icily at the camera. The liner notes were composed by the little-known (and often institutionalized) artist and poet Daphne Richardson. Two months before the album's release, Cohen, who had been grappling with depression at the time, told Roy Hollingworth from \"Melody Maker\", \"I just cannot stand to remain part of the music business. I've reached a state when I'm just not writing anything.\" In March 1975 he would explain to Harvey Kubernik of \"Melody Maker\", \"The previous album \"Live Songs\" represented a very confused and directionless time. The thing I like about it is that it documents this phase very clearly.\"\n\n\"Live Songs\" was released in April 1973 and was a commercial disappointment. It would be the last Cohen LP to make the U.S. charts for more than a decade. In the book \"Various Positions\", Cohen biographer Ira Nadel deemed \"Live Songs\" \"uneven but spontaneous. The mood was somber, the songs full of darkness, and the cover photo haunting...Reaction to the album was negative.\" Gautam Baksi of AllMusic calls the collection \"an integral part of the early Cohen chronicles,\" adding, \"The release includes several new songs...all of which skillfully combine heavy doses of erotica, love, and depression.\"\n\n\n\n\nCanadian Klezmer musician Geoff Berner recorded his version of \"Queen Victoria\" on \"Wedding Dance of the Widow Bride\" (2007).\n"}

It is the largest port in Massachusetts as well as being one of the principal ports on the east coast of the United States.\n\nThe Port of Boston was historically important for the growth of the City of Boston, and was originally located in what is now the downtown area of the city, called Long Wharf. Land reclamation and conversion to other uses means that the downtown area no longer handles commercial traffic, although there is still considerable ferry and leisure usage at Long Wharf. Today the principal cargo handling facilities are located in the Boston neighborhoods of Charlestown, East Boston, and South Boston, and in the neighboring city of Everett. The Port of Boston has also been an entry point for many immigrants.\n\nThe Massachusetts Port Authority (Massport) was created in 1956 by a special act of the Massachusetts General Court; however, the Authority was not enabled until 1959, due to delay in bond funding. The Authority is an independent public authority, not a state agency. The Massachusetts Secretary of Transportation and Public Works serves as an ex-officio member of the board and the remaining six members are appointed by the governor to staggered seven year terms. Its Board members must be residents of Massachusetts. The Department of Homeland Security also has a presence with United States Customs Service and United States Border Patrol agents. The port has three areas of activity: cargo, cruises and ferry service.\n\nBefore the colonization of the Americas, the area served as a trading post for Native Americans in the region. After the establishment of the Boston settlement by John Winthrop in 1630 and the creation of a local shipbuilding industry, the port served the rapidly expanding American colonies. During that time, trade involved finished goods from England in exchange for lumber, fully constructed vessels, rum, and salted fish.\n\nWith the rapid growth of the Mid-Atlantic colonies in the 1750s, the ports of New York and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania began to surpass Boston for inter-colony trade. In response, Bostonian merchants established trade with foreign nations besides Great Britain. This trade led to a huge increase in wealth amongst local Bay State merchants. However, the British government's imposition of regulations restricting trade to Great Britain, combined with newly enacted taxes on the colonists, caused Bostonian merchants to join the more radical elements in American society. After the Boston Tea Party, the British Parliament passed the Boston Port Act which shut down the port until the East India Company was compensated for the damaged tea These actions led to the American Revolutionary War.\n\nThough economically devastated by the Revolutionary War, the Port of Boston was again prospering with trade with various foreign ports such as Shanghai. The port's fortunes were further augmented with a navy base at Charlestown. By the mid-19th century, the shipbuilding industry reached its peak as displayed by the clipper ships developed by Donald McKay. The port also saw many land reclamation projects and the construction of new piers.\nWith the start of the Industrial Revolution in the United States, activity in the port turned towards trade between the states. Starting in the mid-19th century, the Port of Boston was eclipsed yet again by other eastern seaboard ports such Port of New New York City as local merchant companies were bought out by New York businessmen. In 1956, control of the port was handed to the Massachusetts Port Authority (Massport), which began the process of modernizing the port. During the 1980s and 1990s, a project dedicated to the cleanup of Boston Harbor was overseen by the Massachusetts Water Resource Authority (MWRA).\n\nIn 1966, Sea-Land introduced containerized shipping and later established one of the first container ports on Castle Island, where Conley Terminal now stands. To meet the growing demand for container shipping, Massport constructed a common-use container port on what is now Moran Terminal. However, the port faced a setback with the closure of the Charlestown Navy Yard in 1974.\n\nIn the mid-1990s, the port went through another round of modernization. Container shipping operations were consolidated at Conley Terminal while Moran Terminal was dedicated to automobile shipping. A project of dredging the harbor commenced in 1997. Through the Central Artery/Tunnel Project (Big Dig), ground access to the South Boston facilities were improved with the extension of I-90 and the construction of the Ted Williams Tunnel linking South Boston with East Boston and Logan International Airport. The port has also seen a burgeoning cruise industry as well as expanding commercial and residential developments on the Boston waterfront.\n\nWith the Panama Canal expansion project expected to accommodate larger ships starting in 2016, the United States Army Corps of Engineers plans to dredge harbor access routes starting in 2017, deepening them from 40 to 47 to 51 feet. This will allow visits by container ships carrying up to 10,000 TEUs, up from 7000 TEUs, and reduce the amount of freight which is expected to be shipped to the Port of New York and New Jersey and trucked to Massachusetts. The project is estimated to cost $310 million and is paid for by the federal Water Resources Reform and Development Act (about two-thirds), Massport, and an additional allocation from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.\n\nThe Port of Boston has access to I-90, I-93, I-95, and U.S. 1, including a truck-only haul road. Track 61 runs through the port, but is being used by the MBTA as a test track. There is public transit access via the MBTA Silver line SL2 route.\n\nThe public facilities, operated by the Massport, are located in the neighborhoods of Charlestown, East Boston, and South Boston. These include:\n\n\nThe Port of Boston has facilities dedicated to bulk cargo, petroleum, and LNG shipment and storage. These are primarily located on the Mystic River, notably along the city of Everett waterfront as well as the Chelsea River area of East Boston, Chelsea, and Revere. The Chelsea River depots also contain facilities handling jet fuel for Logan International Airport. The Deer Island Waste Water Treatment Plant, whose egg-shaped sludge digesters are major landmarks, ships treated sludge across the harbor by barge for further processing into fertilizer.\n\nThe US Coast Guard has a base in Boston, and the naval frigate USS Constitution (\"Old Ironsides\") is berthed at the former Charlestown Navy Yard, now part of the Boston National Historical Park. The park is also home to the USS Cassin Young a World War II museum ship. The park's Drydock Number 1 was completed in 1833 and first used by the \"Constitution.\" It is now used to overhaul historic ships, including \"Constitution\" in 1992 and \"Cassin Young\" in 2007. Two other pre-World War II-era dry docks in the harbor are still operational (as of 2014), including Dry Dock Number 3 — one of the largest dry docks on the U.S. East Coast — which regularly repairs ships for the Military Sealift Command. These are located at the former South Boston Naval Annex.\n\nMBTA Boat, water taxis, and private ferries and small cruise boats also use docks at Rowes Wharf, Long Wharf, Boston Navy Yard, Logan International Airport, Hewitt's Cove in Hingham, Pemberton Point in Hull, and the Fore River Shipyard in Quincy, and a number of small docks at destinations around the harbor. The Boston Harborwalk provides public access to much of the harbor's edge.\n\nBoston's port was historically served by many more wharves and pier facilities. Although Massport maintain the more notable ones, a handful of docking facilities in the Boston Harbor are maintained by private interests or other state agencies such as DCR. Further, some wharves have been converted to residential condominiums, or hotel accommodations.\n\nThe Port's current and former wharves include:\n\n\nMassport manages Foreign Trade Zone (FTZ) No. 27, which includes many privately owned and port-owned sites located throughout Suffolk County, Massachusetts.\n\nThe following Sub Zones are a part of The Port of Boston FTZ No. 27:\n\nIn 2015, the port handled 237,000 container TEUs, 60,000 automobiles, and 121,000 metric tons of cement. Other major forms of cargo processed at the port include petroleum, liquefied natural gas (LNG), gypsum, and salt. There were 328,305 cruise ship passengers that year. Some 114 vessel calls are scheduled for the 2016 cruise season.\n\nIn the wake of the September 11, 2001 attacks, there have been concerns about the security of LNG shipments within Boston Harbor, and increased fear of terrorism. Because of the location of the LNG terminal in the Mystic River, tankers traveling to and from the facility are forced to pass directly offshore of downtown Boston. During their voyage through the harbor, they are protected by a security zone that extends in front of the vessel, behind it, and more than half a mile on either side. This zone is enforced by escort vessels provided by the Coast Guard and State Police. The Tobin Bridge is closed as the escort passes under it, and boating is forbidden within the security zone. , there have been proposals to construct an offshore LNG facility on either Outer Brewster Island in the Harbor, or further a field in the wider Massachusetts Bay.\nThe MBTA operates commuter boats between Long Wharf and Rowes Wharf on the downtown Boston waterfront to Hingham, Hull, Quincy, and Logan Airport as well as inner harbor ferries between downtown Boston, Charlestown, and South Boston. Other fast passenger ferries operate to Provincetown and Salem. Several companies operate cruise ships on the harbor, whilst water taxis operate from various points on the downtown Boston waterfront, Logan Airport, Charlestown, East Boston, and South Boston. Ferries are also provided for travel amongst the harbor islands.\n\nThere are occasionally marine accidents, as with a commuter ferry \"Massachusetts\" going from Boston's Rowes Wharf to Hull in June 2006.\n\nThe Massachusetts Port Authority (MassPort), which itself was constituted in 1956 maintains its own police force of fully certified and sworn law enforcement officers of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. They work in conjunction with the Massachusetts State Police—Troop F who currently provide law enforcement services for Massport. The port police officers are responsible for physical security and law enforcement at the marine terminals and various properties owned by the authority. \n\n\n\n"}

He is currently a Deputy in the National Assembly. As the long-time leader of the Social Democratic Party (PSD), Amoussou stood as a presidential candidate in 1991, 1996, 2001, and 2006.\n\nAmoussou was born in Djakotomey in south-western Benin. In the 1991 presidential election, he received 5.8% of the vote and fourth place, therefore failing to qualify for the second round. Following the March 1995 parliamentary election, he was elected as President of the National Assembly on 12 June 1995. During his political career, his support was locally concentrated in his native southwest, but it was sufficient to enable him to be a consistent player on the political scene during the 1990s and 2000s. He placed fourth in the March 1996 presidential election with 7.8% of the vote; along with third-place finisher Houngbédji, Amoussou backed Kérékou against President Nicéphore Soglo for the second round of the election, and Kérékou was victorious.\n\nAmoussou was re-elected to the National Assembly in the March 1999 parliamentary election, but on 29 April 1999, he was defeated in his bid for re-election as President of the National Assembly by Adrien Houngbédji in a parliamentary vote, despite being the favored candidate of Kérékou for the position. Amoussou received 38 votes against 45 for Houngbédji. Under Kérékou, Amoussou was appointed as Minister of Development and Planning in 1999. The PSD held its first ordinary congress in early 2000, and Amoussou was elected as the party's President.\n\nIn the first round of the March 2001 presidential election, he placed fourth yet again with 8.6% of the vote, but participated in the runoff when the second- and third-placed candidates, Soglo and Houngbédji, withdrew from the race. Running against heavily favored incumbent Kérékou, to whom he had previously given his support for the second round, Amoussou received nearly 16% of the vote. By providing token opposition to Kérékou after the President's most important opponents decided to boycott the vote, he gave the outcome a limited measure of legitimacy that it would have otherwise lacked. He remained Minister of Development and Planning until 2005.\n\nAmoussou ran again in the March 2006 presidential election, obtaining 16.29% of the vote and placing third. He supported Yayi Boni in the second round.\n\nIn the March 2007 parliamentary election, Amoussou and the PSD participated in the Alliance for a Dynamic Democracy, and Amoussou was again elected to a seat. Afterwards he was again a candidate for President of the National Assembly, losing to Mathurin Nago of the Cauris Forces for an Emerging Benin in a vote on 3 May 2007. Amoussou received 34 votes, while Nago received 45.\n\nAt the PSD's second ordinary congress in mid-2009, Amoussou was re-elected as PSD President. He was re-elected to the National Assembly in the March 2011 parliamentary election.\n\nAmoussou resigned as PSD President on 22 January 2012. In the April 2015 parliamentary election, he was re-elected to the National Assembly as a candidate of the Union Makes the Nation coalition in the 11th constituency.\n\nHe has used the campaign slogan, \"He knows the country.\"\n"}

Consecration by a bishop of the same rite was required. In the Byzantine Rite, the antimension, blessed and signed by the bishop, serves a similar function.\n\nIn contrast to the Jewish practice of building altars of several stones, the earliest Christian altars were of wood and shaped like ordinary house tables, a practice that continued until the Middle Ages. However, a preference for more durable materials led to church enactments in the West against wooden altars, but not in the East. The earliest stone altars were the tombs of martyrs, over which Mass was sometimes offered, either on a stone slab enclosing the tomb or on a structure placed above it. When the first custom-built Christian basilicas were built, the altar of the church was placed directly above the tomb of a martyr, as in the case of St. Peter's Basilica and the Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls.\n\nBefore the Second Vatican Council, Latin-Rite priests could lawfully celebrate Mass only on a properly consecrated altar. This consecration was carried out by a bishop, and involved specially blessed \"Gregorian Water\" (water to which wine, salt, and ashes are added), anointings and ceremonies. The First class relics of at least two saints, at least one of which had to be a martyr, were inserted in a cavity in the altar which was then sealed, a practice that was meant to recall the use of martyrs' tombs as places of Eucharistic celebration during the persecutions of the Church in the first through fourth centuries. Also in the cavity were sealed documents relating to the altar's consecration. The tabletop of the altar, the \"mensa\", had to be of a single piece of natural stone (almost always marble). Its supports had to be attached to the mensa. If contact was later broken even only momentarily (for instance, if the top was lifted off for some reason), the altar lost its consecration. Every altar had to have a \"title\" or \"titulus\" in Latin. This could be The Holy Trinity or one of its Persons; a title or mystery of Christ's life (Christ the Good Shepherd; the Holy Cross); Mary in one of her titles (Mother of Christ; Our Lady of Good Counsel); or a canonized saint. The main altar of a church had to have the same title as the church itself, for instance, there are many \"side altars\" in St. Patrick's Cathedral, New York, but the \"high altar\" in the center is dedicated to St. Patrick. This reflected the idea that the altar was the key element, and the church was built to house it, as opposed to the church being built and simply supplied with an altar as part of its furniture.\n\nObviously, these regulations would have made it impossible to celebrate Mass anywhere but inside of a Roman Catholic church. To provide for other circumstances—for chaplains of everything from military to Boy Scout units, for priests traveling alone, for missionaries, or for large outdoor celebrations of Mass on pilgrimages—portable altars, popularly called \"altar stones,\" were used. These were usually blocks of marble, often about 6 inches by 9 inches and an inch thick, consecrated as described above. A priest with a field kit could simply place this stone on any available surface (a tailgate, or a stump or log) to celebrate Mass, or it could be inserted in a flat frame built into the surface of a wooden altar. Many Roman Catholic schools had a full-sized, decoratively carved wooden altar (which, being wood, could not be consecrated) in their gym or auditorium that could be taken out and prepared for Mass, with an altar stone placed in the \"mensa\" space.\n\nThe privilege of using a portable altar was not automatically conferred on any priest. Cardinals and bishops normally had such rights under canon law, but other priests had to be given specific permission— this was, however, easily and widely obtained.\n\nThe Code of Canon Law dedicates a short chapter of five canons to altars for Mass. It states:\n\nOn the material to be used, it decrees:\n\nWith regard to relics of saints, it says:\n\nThe norms in \"Rite of Dedication of a Church and an Altar\" are:\n\n\"Rite of Dedication of a Church and an Altar\" also states:\n\n"}

The saying is thought to have come from Zhejiang province in the Yuan Dynasty.\n\nConnections between the Chinese Central Government in Beijing and the people has historically been weak, with much regional autonomy and little loyalty. The proverb has thus come to generally mean that central authorities have little influence over local affairs, and it is often used in reference to corruption.\n\nThe saying, as it is considered in China, has multiple meanings. Often it involves something minor such as walking on the grass when no one is watching, ignoring a command because the father is far away, cutting timber when not permitted, or ignoring the one-child policy. It is also used to describe a lawless place far from the authorities.\n\nThe original variation is also still heard: 山高皇帝远 \"shān gāo, huángdì yuǎn\", meaning \"the \"mountains\" are high and the emperor is far away\".\n\nIn Russian, there exists a directly similar proverb: до бога высоко, до царя далеко \"do boga vysoko, do czarya daleko\", with a usually omitted rhyming continuation of а до меня близко - кланяйся мне низко \"a do menya blizko - klanyaysa mne nizko\", which can be translated as \"God is high, and the czar is far away (while I am near, so bow deeply to me)\". In its short form, it is typically used to say there is no hope for external aid; while the full form describes lower echelons of bureaucracy abusing their power while the authority meant to keep them in check is absent or indifferent.\n\n"}

The state highway runs from U.S. Route 29 and US 50 in Fairfax east to SR 400 in Alexandria. SR 236 is a major suburban arterial highway that connects the independent cities of Fairfax and Alexandria via Annandale in Fairfax County. The state highway is known as Main Street in City of Fairfax, Little River Turnpike in Fairfax County, where the highway meets Interstate 495 (I-495), and Duke Street in Alexandria, where the road has junctions with I-395 and US 1.\n\nSR 236 begins at an intersection with US 29 and US 50 in the western part of the city of Fairfax. US 29 heads west-southwest as Lee Highway toward Centreville and US 50 heads west-northwest as Lee Jackson Highway toward Chantilly. The two U.S. Highways run concurrently east-northeast as Lee Highway toward Arlington; that highway is also known as Fairfax Boulevard, which was the original bypass of Fairfax. SR 236 heads east-southeast as Main Street, a four-lane divided boulevard, through a commercial area toward downtown Fairfax. At historic Truro Church in the City of Fairfax Historic District, SR 236 veers north onto North Street while Main Street continues straight through the downtown area. Main Street maintains one through lane in each direction and North Street maintains two through lanes per direction. Eastbound SR 236 traffic headed for northbound SR 123 (Chain Bridge Road) and westbound SR 236 traffic aiming for southbound SR 123 must use Main Street. After three blocks, SR 236 returns to Main Street and continues east as a four-lane divided highway through the eastern part of Fairfax.\n\nSR 236 intersects Pickett Road, which heads north as SR 237 opposite Wilbert Tucker Woodson High School, before leaving the city of Fairfax and becoming Little River Turnpike. The state highway passes the Annandale campus of Northern Virginia Community College, whose access road is SR 376 (Lake Drive), before meeting I-495 (Capital Beltway) at a cloverleaf interchange. In the commercial center of Annandale, westbound SR 236 receives the western terminus of SR 244 (Columbia Pike), whose southernmost segment is one-way westbound. The other connections with SR 244 are provided via SR 617 (Backlick Road). The state highway passes through Lincolnia before entering the city of Alexandria just west of the highway's partial cloverleaf interchange with I-395 (Henry G. Shirley Memorial Highway). The interchange includes a flyover ramp from eastbound SR 236 to northbound I-395. SR 236 continues through Alexandria as six-lane Duke Street, which passes the Landmark Mall just west of its partial cloverleaf interchange with SR 401 (Van Dorn Street). Direct access to the mall is provided from eastbound SR 236 via a flyover ramp. The state highway has a trumpet interchange with the access road for Ben Brenman Park just west of Holmes Run, a tributary of Cameron Run, then reduces to a four-lane undivided highway at Jordan Street.\nSR 236 expands to a divided highway again at Quaker Lane and meets the northern end of Virginia State Route 241 (Telegraph Road) at a trumpet interchange; SR 241 provides access to I-95 and I-495 (Capital Beltway) and Eisenhower Avenue to the south. SR 236 passes south of the George Washington Masonic National Memorial and crosses over CSX's RF&P Subdivision, which carries Amtrak and Virginia Railway Express service as well as freight service, and the Yellow and Blue lines of the Washington Metro. Callahan Drive, which intersects the state highway just west of the railroad crossing, provides access to Alexandria Union Station. SR 236 reduces to four lanes and enters Old Town Alexandria at Diagonal Road, which provides access to Washington Metro's King Street – Old Town. The state highway reduces to two lanes at US 1, which follows Henry Street southbound and Patrick Street northbound. Three blocks to the east, SR 236 reaches its eastern terminus at SR 400 (Washington Street), which leads to the George Washington Memorial Parkway in both directions. Duke Street continues east as an unnumbered road seven blocks to the Robinson Terminal on the Potomac River.\n\nThe Little River Turnpike was built between 1801 and 1806, and the road was a privately owned and operated toll road during the 19th century running from Alexandria to Aldie in Loudoun County, Virginia. Toll houses were placed at five mile intervals along the road for collection of fees. The road was a paved (\"macadamized\") road 20 feet wide. The road remained a private road until it became a public road in 1896.\n\nSeveral sections of the road originated as Indian trails, and a majority of the road traversed rural areas. Many Civil War battles and skirmishes were fought at locations along or near the road. Currently, the portion of the historical turnpike between Aldie and Fairfax is part of US 50. Only the SR 236 section continues to carry the Little River Turnpike name. SR 236 appeared in its present location in July 1935 as a replacement for US 50, which for several years previously ran the entire length of the historic Little River Turnpike to Alexandria before turning northward toward Washington concurrent with US 1. Prior to that, State Route 236 ran along present US 50 east of Fairfax; the two routes were swapped at that time.\n\n"}

The music was recorded during the Ziggy Stardust Tour at the Hammersmith Odeon in London on , although the album was not issued by RCA Records until 1983. Prior to that it had existed in bootleg form, notably \"His Masters Voice – Bowie and the Spiders From Mars' Last Stand\".\n\nThe album documents the final show which Bowie performed in his Ziggy Stardust persona. Just before the final track, he announces, \"Of all the shows on this tour, this particular show will remain with us the longest, because not only is it the last show of the tour, but it's the last show that we'll ever do. Thank you.\" Many in the audience believed that Bowie himself was retiring.\n\nD. A. Pennebaker filmed the concert and RCA recorded it with the intention of releasing a live album. However the project was shelved for several reasons, rumoured to include Bowie's desire to leave Ziggy behind, and the poor quality of the recordings. Reasoning that RCA would most likely issue the material sooner or later regardless, Bowie and producer Tony Visconti mixed the recordings in 1981. This mix has been heavily criticised, although Visconti describes it as \"more of a salvage job than an artistic endeavor\" considering the state of the source material.\n\nThe album was eventually released in October 1983 as a double LP soundtrack to Pennebaker's documentary. Partly due to the limitations of the LP record format, the release omitted, shortened or reordered several items from the original tapes. \"White Light/White Heat\" was issued as a single in November.\n\n\"Ziggy Stardust: The Motion Picture\" has been released on CD twice; the first time on by Rykodisc. In April 2003, the \"30th Anniversary 2CD Set\" was released by EMI/Virgin. Remixed by Visconti, it was considered a significant improvement on the original. It contains additional material, including introductions, spoken passages and the complete version of \"The Width of a Circle\"; \"Changes\" was also slotted into its correct position in the original concert's running order, following \"Moonage Daydream\". \"The Jean Genie/Love Me Do\" and \"Round and Round\" encore with Jeff Beck are still omitted. The continued absence of Beck's sequence has been variously attributed to an issue over royalties or to the guitarist feeling, in Tony Visconti's words, that \"he didn't fit in the film\".\n\nAll songs were written by David Bowie, except where noted.\n\nDisc 1\nDisc 2\n\n\n\n\nProduction\n"}

It was released on September 28, 2004 via Jazze Pha's Sho'nuff Records and LaFace Records. After writing songs for several established acts, Ciara's talents were noticed by Jazze Pha, and she began to work on what became \"Goodies\". The album's conception came through the title track, produced by Lil Jon and created as a female crunk counterpart to other singles produced by Lil Jon such as Usher's \"Yeah!\" and Petey Pablo's \"Freek-a-Leek.\" Ciara worked with additional writers and producers on the album, including Jazze Pha, Bangladesh, R. Kelly, Johntá Austin, Sean Garrett, and Keri Hilson, among others.\n\nWith \"Goodies\", Ciara was hailed as the \"Princess\" or \"First Lady of Crunk&B\". The album uses dance music while utilizing pop, R&B, and hip-hop influences. The album delivers contradictory lyrical content, featuring female empowerment and independence-promoting lyrics in songs like the title track, while others show interest in adult activities. Critics gave the album positive to mixed reviews, commending the \"Goodies\"-esque songs, while deeming others as unoriginal and noting Ciara's limited vocal abilities. Most critics compared the work to late singer Aaliyah, and also said it had qualities of Destiny's Child.\n\nThe album was a commercial success. In the United States, the album debuted at number three on the US \"Billboard\" 200, selling 124,750 copies in its opening week. It was later certified triple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), and has sold over 2.7 million copies in the United States. The album also fared well internationally, being certified platinum by the Music Canada (MC) and gold by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI). \"Goodies\" earned Ciara two Grammy nominations at the 48th Grammy Awards including Best New Artist and Best Rap/Sung Collaboration for \"1, 2 Step\" in 2006.\n\nIn her mid-teens, Ciara formed the all-girl group Hearsay with two of her friends. The group recorded demos, but as time went on, they began to have differences and eventually parted ways. Despite this setback, Ciara was still determined to reach her goal and signed a publishing deal as a songwriter.\nAfter leaving the group Hearsay, Texas native Ciara earned a writing job via her manager, for Atlanta's Tricky Stewart and The-Dream's RedZone Entertainment, penning songs for Mýa and Fantasia among others. According to Ciara, no one believed in her dreams of hearing her own music on the radio until she met producer Jazze Pha in 2002. Within five months of meeting her, Pha signed her to his Sho'nuff label and they had already recorded five tracks. About Ciara, Jazze Pha said, \"What was really lacking is the Janet Jackson, high-energy dance [music]. Ciara fills that void. She's pretty, she can dance, she can write music, and kids love her. Everyone loves her.\"\n\nAfter graduating from Riverdale High School in Riverdale, Georgia in 2003, she was signed by LaFace Records executive, L.A. Reid, whom she was introduced to by Jazze Pha. She began production on her debut album later that year. Recording sessions for the album took place at Chocolate Factory, Chicago, IL; Circle House Studios, Miami, FL; Darp Studios, Atlanta, GA; Doppler Studios, Atlanta, GA; Futuristic Recording Studios, Atlanta, GA; Ground Breaking Studios, Atlanta, GA; Hit Factory Criteria, Miami, FL; Hitco, Atlanta, GA; Patchwerk Recordings, Atlanta, GA; Phoenix Ave. Studios, Atlanta, GA; Sony Music Studios, New York, NY; Studio 609 Recordings, Philadelphia, PA; The Studio, Philadelphia, PA.\n\nIn early 2004, Ciara wrote a demo with record producer Sean Garrett, co-writer of Usher's crunk hit \"Yeah.\" After hearing a demo, crunk producer Lil Jon, who also produced and was featured on \"Yeah\", began to work on the full record, to have it released on LaFace. Originally, Ciara was reluctant to work with the track produced by Lil Jon, reportedly disliking crunk music at first.\nHowever, she decided to use the song to go against the grain and deliver lyrics in contrast of female promiscuity lines delivered by fellow female artists. To give her a title to stand out, Lil Jon dubbed Ciara as the \"Princess of Crunk&B.\" Dubbed the female counterpart to \"Yeah\" and fellow crunk hit \"Freek-a-Leek\" by Petey Pablo, Laface looked to capitalize on the success of the previous songs. In addition to working with Jazze Pha, who produced most of the album, Lil Jon, and Garrett, she worked with several other Atlanta-based writers and producers including Bangladesh, Johntá Austin, Jasper Cameron, and others, while featuring collaborations from Atlanta's T.I. and Ludacris. R&B singer R. Kelly wrote and produced a track.\n\nWhen talking about the album's theme, Ciara said it was universal, stating, \"It's about everybody. You'll have songs with different emotions, happy, sad, 'my heart is broken.' What everybody goes through.\" On her success with the preluding title track, Ciara said, \"I'm very content right now. I take everything a day at a time. Every time I hear good news, I'm shouting out, 'Praise God.' Everybody around me is so excited, I still haven't got it. I haven't really felt it like they're feeling it for me.\"\n\nThe album consists of bouncy dance music mixed with crunk, combined with either R&B, pop or hip hop music. The ballads on the set utilize Ciara's breathy vocals, as the uptempo pieces. Lyrical content varies on the album. Songs like \"Goodies\" issue a message of female empowerment and abstinence, and this is contradicted as she hints at teasing sex. Slant Magazine compared this to Britney Spears-esque \"layer of tease to the mature\" in her early work. Utilizing influences from 80's dance music, qualities of the work of Destiny's Child and Aaliyah are evident.\n\n\"Goodies\" is heavily influenced by male counterpart crunk song \"Yeah\" and also has been compared to Kelis's \"Milkshake.\" The song makes use of a repeated whistle, \"faux operated vocals\" in parts and a western guitar riff near the end. \"1, 2 Step,\" which continues the club music theme, is built around a simple dance and features Missy Elliott in a pas de deux. and according to Mike Pattensden of \"The Times\", \"owes plenty to classic New York electro.\" \"Oh,\" a downtempo song, features a heavy bassline and has been called \"brooding electronic grind,\" and, according to Dorian Lynskey of \"The Guardian\", \"sounds like R&B reimagined by Gary Numan.\" \"Pick Up the Phone\" was described as a rip-off of Aaliyah's \"Rock the Boat\" by Sal Cinquemani of \"Slant Magazine\". \"Next to You,\" written by R. Kelly, is part of the album's second half of ballads, and was said to capture \"Ciara's youthful indecisiveness.\" \"Hotline\" features a \"funky clap\" and beatboxing.\n\n\"Goodies\"<nowiki>'</nowiki> lead single, the title track, featuring Petey Pablo, was released on June 8, 2004. Conceived as a crunk female counterpart to Usher's \"Yeah,\" the lyrical content goes against the grain, speaking of abstinence, rejecting advances because \"the goodies will stay in the jar\". Critics hailed it as an \"anthem of the summer\" and one of the best singles of the year, complementing its dance-feel and beat, and the irony of the \"clever\" lyrics. The single performed well worldwide, topping the charts in Canada, the United States and the United Kingdom, and charting in the top ten of other charts, receiving Platinum certification in the United States. The music video shot for the song features Ciara partying with friends. \"1, 2 Step\", featuring Missy Elliott, was released as the second single, incorporating a hip-hop and dance-pop feel, deriving influences from 1980s electro music. While topping the charts in Canada, it additionally appeared in the top ten of six other countries, and was certified Platinum or Gold in multiple regions. The accompanying music video features Ciara and others performing the dance. The song was nominated for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration at the 48th Annual Grammy Awards. \"Oh\", featuring Ludacris, proclaimed as a love song to Atlanta, was released as the album's third single on March 5, 2005. Carrying a slow, dark tone, critics noted \"Oh\" as a standout track from \"Goodies\". The song performed well worldwide, appearing the top ten of seven charts, and certified either Platinum or Gold in multiple regions. The song's music video, which is similar to that of \"Goodies\", takes place at a block party, and was nominated for Best R&B Video at the 2005 MTV Video Music Awards. The album's final single, \"And I\", was released on August 30, 2005, and only managed to peak at ninety-six on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. The music video for \"And I\" is loosely based on the 1992 film, \"The Bodyguard\", and NBA player Carmelo Anthony portrayed Ciara's love interest.\n\nRaymond Fiore of \"Entertainment Weekly\" gave the album a B and commented, \"If Aaliyah had lived to make another CD, it might have sounded like Goodies,\" and said that other album cuts \"prove she's no one-track pony.\" Noting the singles \"Goodies,\" \"1, 2 Step,\" and \"Oh\" as standout tracks, Allmusic gave the album three and a half out of five stars. Steve Jones of \"USA Today\" said, \"The voice doesn't blow you away, but as with Goodies, she takes a lyrically intriguing offbeat path from time to time. Though not every song is a goodie, she does have a few treats in store.\" Even though he said the album wasn't a perfect work, Azeem Ahmad of musicOMH said, \"The talent is obviously there but if we are to carry out Ciara's wish of forgetting about \"the other chicks\" then there's some fine-tuning needed. For now there's no direct threat to any other hip-hop divas, but the void left by Aaliyah is still there for someone to try and fill. There's no reason why Ciara can't one day hold her own with the best.\" Jalylah Burrell of PopMatters commented that \"\"Goodies\" is nothing new, but it is executed well.\"\n\nAlthough pointing out the flaws of \"Goodies\", Dorian Lynskey of \"The Guardian\" said, \"Ciara has no conviction as a sweet-talker but her disconnected style clicks perfectly with the cold, clinical (in a good way) hits.\" Mike Pattenden of \"The Times\" said, \"Goodies has some tasty treats, but they're all stacked on top of the jar,\" commenting that Ciara's \"whispery, girlish voice that is often relegated to the background by stronger performers, suggesting she is little more than a pretty mouthpiece for Jon and his posse of producers.\" Slant Magazine's Sal Cinquemani compared it to the work to Aaliyah, stating some of it was not up to par with the late singer, but complimented the title track-esque tracks.\n\n\"Goodies\" debuted at number three on the US \"Billboard\" 200 chart, selling 124,750 copies in its first week. The album also topped the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart, before being dethroned by the Usher's \"Confessions\". In its second week, the album dropped to number ten on the chart, selling 66,000 more copies. The album spent a total of 71 weeks on the chart. On October 10, 2006, the album was triple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipments of over three million copies in the United States. As of June 2010, the album has sold 2.7 million copies in the US.\n\nIn Canada, the album peaked at twenty-two on the Canadian Albums Chart. The album was eventually certified platinum by Music Canada for sales of over 100,000 copies in Canada.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the album charted at twenty-six in on the UK Albums Chart, and spent twenty weeks on the chart. The album was certified gold by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) for sales of over 100,000 copies in the UK. The album also charted moderately in other countries, including the top forty on the New Zealand Albums Chart and Irish Albums Chart. The album has sold 5 million copies worldwide.\n\nWith the release of her debut single \"Goodies\", Ciara was referred to as the Princess of Crunk&B. Allison Stewart of \"The Washington Post\" commented that she has a \"reedy, agile voice, capable of conveying the only three emotions (sexy, sassy, sad) an R&B singer needs. Randall Roberts of \"Los Angeles Times\" commented that \"Ciara has been the most synthetic of the R&B divas over the past decade, an electro-leaning vocalist whose instrumental palate has heavily favored stark 808 beats, sassy and seductive vocal lines.\"\nIn the early to mid-2000s, some crunk music hits like \"Get Low\", \"Goodies\", \"Yeah!\" and \"Freek-a-Leek\" produced by Lil Jon climbed to the Top 10 of the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 charts. Both \"Yeah!\" and \"Goodies\" were the first tracks to introduce the substyle of crunk music and contemporary R&B, called crunk&B, to the public. Both of those tracks (performed by Usher and Ciara, respectively) were the main mainstream hits of 2004. Since then, crunk&B has been one of the most popular genres of sung African-American music, along with electropop, the genre that replaced crunk and crunk&B in the charts in 2008. After the album's lead single reached the summit of the US Billboard Hot 100, it spent seven weeks at number one, becoming the longest-running number-one debut single by a female artist since 1977\n\nThe album's lead singles success exemplified urban music's commercial dominance during the early 2000s, which featured massive crossover success on the \"Billboard\" charts by R&B and hip hop artists. In 2004, all 12 songs that topped the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 were African-American recording artists and accounted for 80% of the number-one R&B hits that year. Along with Usher's streak of singles, Top 40 radio and both pop and R&B charts were topped by OutKast's \"Hey Ya!\", Snoop Dogg's \"Drop It Like It's Hot\", Terror Squad's \"Lean Back\", and Ciara's \"Goodies\". Chris Molanphy of \"The Village Voice\" later remarked that \"by the early 2000s, urban music \"was\" pop music.\"\n\nThe work helped Ciara earn several nominations, including Best New Artist at the 48th Annual Grammy Awards. Several \"Goodies\" singles received several nominations at different ceremonies, which included \"1, 2 Step\" being nominated at the 48th Grammy Awards for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration. The song \"1, 2 Step\" from the album Goodies has received numerous awards, including both \"Best Performed Songs in the ASCAP Repertory\" and \"Most Performed Songs\" from the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers, \"Best Collaboration\" from the BET Awards, and \"Best Dance Cut\" from the Soul Train Lady of Soul Music Awards, and \"Choice Music R&B/Hip Hop Track\" from the Teen Choice Awards. Ciara has received nine nominations from the BET Awards, winning one of them.\n\nInformation is based on the album’s Liner Notes\n\nNotes\n\nCredits adapted from Liner Notes and Allmusic.\n\n"}

The orchestral introduction builds to an impressive \"tutti\", but many writers, including Hutchings and Girdlestone, have considered that after the entry of the keyboard this early promise is somewhat dissipated. The keyboard part itself consists of passages that do not integrate well with the fugato treatment of the ritornellic material, and, as Hutchings comments, the result is that the \"whole is less than the sum of the parts\".\n\n\n"}

The Confederate war effort was also supplied by Browne's iron furnace located on the Little Cahaba River until it was destroyed by Union forces led by General James H. Wilson in April 1865 .\n\nBrowne was born in Waltham, Massachusetts in 1804. He was the son of Phineas Browne, a veteran of the Revolutionary War, and a descendant of William Bradford, the first governor of the Plymouth Colony. Browne emigrated to Alabama in 1831 to join his cousin to work on a construction contract for the Tennessee Canal at Muscle Shoals. Browne soon sold his shares in this contract and moved on to New Orleans to work on a canal from the new American Quarter to Lake Pontchartrain. Browne was involved in subsequent business ventures including a steamship company operating between New Orleans and Mobile, general merchandise stores, corn mills, lumber, coal, and iron.\n\nBrowne also invested heavily in real estate in Mobile, Alabama, along with Henry Hitchcock, Alabama's first Attorney General and later Chief Justice of the Alabama Supreme Court.

It is also popularly known as the \"Organ Symphony\", even though it is not a true symphony for organ, but simply an orchestral symphony where two sections out of four use the pipe organ. The composer inscribed it as: \"Symphonie No. 3 \"avec orgue\"\" (with organ).\n\nOf composing the work Saint-Saëns said \"I gave everything to it I was able to give. What I have here accomplished, I will never achieve again.\" The composer seemed to know it would be his last attempt at the symphonic form, and he wrote the work almost as a type of \"history\" of his own career: virtuoso piano passages, brilliant orchestral writing characteristic of the Romantic period, and the sound of a cathedral-sized pipe organ.\n\nThe symphony was commissioned by the Royal Philharmonic Society in England, and the first performance was given in London on 19 May 1886, at St James's Hall, conducted by the composer. After the death of his friend Franz Liszt on 31 July 1886, Saint-Saëns dedicated the work to Liszt's memory. The composer also conducted the symphony's French premiere in January 1887.\n\nAlthough the symphony seems to follow the normal four-movement structure, and many recordings divide it in this manner, it was actually written in two movements: Saint-Saëns intended to create a novel two-movement symphony. The composer did note in his own analysis of the symphony, however, that while it was cast in two movements, \"the traditional four movement structure is maintained.\"\n\nA typical performance of the symphony lasts about 35 minutes. One of its most outstanding and original features is Saint-Saëns' ingenious use of keyboard instruments—piano, scored for both two and four hands at various places, and the pipe organ (Saint-Saëns was famous as an organist in 19th-century Paris). The symphony makes cyclic use of its thematic material, derived from fragments of plainsong, as a unifying device; each melody appears in more than one movement. Saint-Saëns also employs Liszt's method of thematic transformation, so that these subjects evolve into different guises throughout the duration of the symphony. \n\nThe symphony is scored for an orchestra comprising 3 flutes (1 doubling piccolo), 2 oboes, cor anglais, 2 clarinets, bass clarinet, 2 bassoons, contrabassoon, 4 horns, 3 trumpets, 3 trombones, tuba, timpani, triangle, cymbals, bass drum, piano (two and four hands), organ, and strings.\nAfter its slow introduction, the first movement leads to a theme of Mendelssohnian (or Schubertian) character, followed by a second subject of a gentler cast, with various secondary themes played in major, and soon after repeated in minor forms; chromatic patterns play an important role in both movements. This material is worked out in fairly classical sonata-allegro form, and gradually fades to a quieter mood, which becomes a slightly ominous series of plucked notes in cello and bass, ending on a G pitch, followed by a slow and soft sustained A note in the organ, resolving into the new key of D major for the Poco adagio section of the movement. This evolves as a beautiful dialogue between organ and strings, recalling the earlier main theme of the movement before the recapitulation. The movement ends in a quiet morendo.\n\nThe second movement opens with an energetic string melody, which gives way to a Presto version of the main theme, complete with extremely rapid scale passages in the piano. The Maestoso is introduced by a full C major chord in the organ. Piano four-hands is heard at the beginning with the strings, now playing the C major evolution of the original theme. The theme is then repeated in powerful organ chords, interspersed with brass fanfares. This well-known movement is considerably varied, including as it does polyphonic fugal writing and a brief pastoral interlude, replaced by a massive climax of the whole symphony characterised by a return to the introductory theme in the form of major scale variations.\n\nThe first performance was given in London on 19 May 1886, at St James's Hall, conducted by the composer.\nThe French premiere was on 9 January 1887, conducted by the composer, at a concert of the Société des Concerts. The United States premiere was given on 19 February 1887, conducted by Theodore Thomas, at the Metropolitan Opera House, New York City. In May, 1915, Saint-Saëns traveled to San Francisco as France's Official Representative to the Panama-Pacific International Exposition. He attended a performance of the Symphony No. 3 at the 3,782 seat Festival Hall. Karl Muck conducted the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra. The composer was given a standing ovation at the performance, which was also attended by composer John Philip Sousa. Saint-Saëns composed another piece especially for the occasion called \"Hail California,\" which included Sousa's famous band.\n\nThe symphony was performed by the BBC Symphony Orchestra at the 2009 BBC Proms season as the finale to a concert celebrating the 800th anniversary of the University of Cambridge, as the composer was awarded an honorary doctorate by the university in 1893. In the 2011 season, it was performed again by the BBC National Orchestra of Wales, and in 2013, it returned to the BBC Proms, this time with Paavo Järvi conducting the Orchestre de Paris.\n\nThe symphony continues to be a frequently performed and recorded part of the standard repertoire. One of the most renowned recordings is by Charles Munch leading the Boston Symphony Orchestra, with Berj Zamkochian at the organ. Eugene Ormandy and the Philadelphia Orchestra recorded the Symphony No. 3 several times, with Virgil Fox, E. Power Biggs, and Michael Murray as the organists.\n\nIn 2006, the Ondine label recorded Olivier Latry performing the symphony at the inaugural concert of the Fred J. Cooper Memorial Organ in Verizon Hall, with Christoph Eschenbach conducting the Philadelphia Orchestra. Ondine released the recording in 2007 on SACD in 5.0 surround sound. Another well-regarded recording of the work is the Mercury Records \"Living Presence\" recording made in 1957 with the Detroit Symphony Orchestra under Paul Paray with Marcel Dupré on organ. It has been reissued on CD as Mercury #432719-2. Simon Preston made a recording in 1986 with James Levine conducting the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra for Deutsche Grammophon.\n\nThe Dutch conductor has noticed a strong relationship to various Gregorian \"Alleluia\" chant-formulas, especially for the major form of the principal theme of the Maestoso to \"Sacratum hoc templum Dei\". \n\nIt has also been suggested that themes within the symphony could be derived from the Gregorian plainsong melody \"Dies Irae\", the Sequence for the Roman Catholic Requiem Mass. While this may not constitute as straightforward a use of the \"Dies Irae\" theme as can be found in such works as the Totentanz of Franz Liszt, the Maestoso melody and chord progression might also be seen as a direct quote of the \"Ave Maria\" attributed to Franco-Flemish Renaissance composer Jacques Arcadelt from an 1842 arrangement by French composer Pierre-Louis Dietsch (1808-1865), which Liszt also arranged for solo piano and published in 1865 as \"Chanson D'Arcadelt \"Ave Maria\" (S.183).\n\nThe entire main theme of the Maestoso was later adapted and used in the 1977 pop-song \"If I Had Words\" by Scott Fitzgerald and Yvonne Keeley. The Maestoso movement is also included as the final piece of music in the soundtrack for the film Impressions de France, which plays in the France pavilion at Epcot at the Walt Disney World Resort. The song and the symphony were used as the main theme in the 1995 family film \"Babe\" and its 1998 sequel \"\" and can be heard in the 1989 comedy \"How to Get Ahead in Advertising\".\n\nThe piece is also featured in the Blue Stars Drum and Bugle Corps 2008 show \"Le Tour: Every Second Counts\" in the finale. The tune of the symphony also serves as the national anthem of the micronation of the Empire of Atlantium under the name \"Auroran Hymn\". Although not included in the soundtrack, the Maestoso movement can be heard along with Dvořák's 9th Symphony in Emir Kusturica's film \"Underground\". The Maestoso also served as the opening work on Laserium's first all-classical show (and the first to have an actual plot), \"Crystal Odyssey.\" The composer Philip Sparke created a brass band test piece based on the symphony which was then assigned to Fourth Section bands for the National Brass Band Championships of Great Britain in 2010.\n\n\n"}

His aim was to ensure that citizens, particularly those who had been historically disenfranchised, would be in a position to comment on the structure of their communities, and to ensure that the citizens would not have this ability stripped of them by politicians who found an involved and engaged public inconvenient. Mayor Jackson had the NPU System placed within the City Charter, which can only be changed by the Georgia Legislature. That same section of the Charter also contains the Office of the Mayor as well as the Atlanta City Council.\n\nThere are 25 NPUs, lettered from A to Z, except U. Each NPU represents the citizens in a specified geographic area. Each NPU meets once a month to review applications for rezoning properties, varying existing zoning ordinances for certain properties, applications for liquor licenses, applications for festivals and parades, any changes to fees charged by the City, any changes to the City's Comprehensive Development Plan, and any amendments to the City's Zoning Ordinances. \nOnce an NPU has voted on an item, that vote is then submitted to the relevant body which makes the ultimate determination with regard to that issue as the official view of the community on a topic.\n\nNPUs operate according to a varied set of guidelines. Each NPU is permitted to create its own bylaws and the only requirement is that once a year the bylaws are voted on and every resident and business owner is permitted to vote on those bylaws. Some NPUs permit anyone to vote while other NPUs operate in a representative governmental fashion with only elected representatives voting on the issues at hand. Given the variances of demography within the City of Atlanta, the idea that a one-size fits all system of community governance would successfully reflect each community's view is unrealistic. Therefore, NPUs are permitted to operate as the citizens see fit.\n\nEach NPU is assigned a City of Atlanta Planner who attends the monthly meetings. Planners are charged with recording official votes, responding to questions about issues of Land Use & Zoning, to present the various items that are sent by the City government for NPU review, and to assure that meetings are reasonably orderly and moderately democratic. The NPUs are staffed entirely by citizen volunteers who receive no compensation for their efforts. NPUs are not given any funding by the City for supplies or other needs.\n\nEach NPU sends a representative to the Atlanta Planning Advisory Board, which is a citywide entity that was created contemporaneously with the NPU System. The Board addresses issues of citywide concern and sends its recommendations to the City Council and/or the Mayor depending on the issue being addressed. The Board makes various appointments to City Commissions and Boards on behalf of the citizens.\n\nThe following list shows each NPU and its constituent neighborhoods.

High APM is often associated with skill, as it can indicate that a player both knows what to do in the game and has the manual dexterity to carry it out. Software has been developed to analyze players' APM in these games. Beginners often have low APM counts, typically below 50. Professional e-athletes in South Korea usually have average APM scores around 350, but often exceed the 450 mark during intense battle sequences. Notable gamers with over 400 average APM include Lee Jae-Dong. Park Sung-Joon is noted for the record APM of 818.\nHowever, given that the majority of APMs are repetitions of orders already given, APM is not always considered an accurate indication of skill.\n\nThe term APM originates from \"StarCraft\", and was popularised after the development of a large number of community tools allowing observers of game matches to view player resources and \"actions per minute\", which was used as a metric in determining a player's skill. After the release of \"\", many of these metrics were built into the game's interface, including APM, which further popularised the term's usage and served to increase the competitiveness of the game.\n\nA player's APM value is determined by the number of actions performed in a given minute. Some actions, such as repeated selection, are easier to carry out than others, and players may repeatedly perform (or \"spam\") these actions, making them redundant in terms of their usefulness. \"Spamming\" may be used as a way to warm up and maintain speed for later phases of the game, or it may be used simply to increase a player's recorded APM in order to improve the perception of their gameplay skills. Because of this, more sophisticated measures of APM may attempt to filter out redundant actions by means such as ignoring re-selection of a group of units which was already selected and ignoring the very beginning of the game (when the typical relative lack of action facilitates spamming), in order to only measure a player's \"efficient/effective\" APM value. However, there is currently no standardization of what constitutes an \"effective action\" and APM is therefore typically recorded without any filtering.\n\nAccuracy is another factor related to a player's APM. Accuracy is the coordination of precise mouse clicks and keystrokes. Greater accuracy will result in fewer mis-clicks and mis-strokes; thus the player's efficiency increases with greater accuracy, meaning the APM is a more accurate measurement statistic.\n\n"}

Since 1995, he has been a fellow of St Cross College, Oxford; he was formerly the senior tutor. Since 1997, he has been Professor of the History of the Church at the University of Oxford.\n\nThough ordained a deacon in the Church of England, he declined ordination to the priesthood because of the Church's attitude to homosexuality. In 2009 he encapsulated the evolution of his religious beliefs: \"I was brought up in the presence of the Bible, and I remember with affection what it was like to hold a dogmatic position on the statements of Christian belief. I would now describe myself as a candid friend of Christianity.\" MacCulloch sits on the editorial board of the \"Journal of Ecclesiastical History\".\n\nDiarmaid MacCulloch was born in Kent, England, to parents Nigel J. H. MacCulloch (an Anglican priest) and Jennie MacCulloch (\"née\" Chappell). He attended Hillcroft Preparatory School and Stowmarket Grammar School in Suffolk. He subsequently studied history at Churchill College, Cambridge, where he obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1972; this was promoted to a Master of Arts degree in 1976. During that period, he was also organ scholar at the college. After completing a Diploma in Archive Administration at Liverpool University in 1973, he then returned to Cambridge to complete a PhD degree in 1977 on Tudor history under the supervision of Geoffrey Elton, combining this with a position as Junior Research Fellow at Churchill College.\n\nMacCulloch joined the Gay Christian Movement in 1976, serving twice on its committee and briefly as honorary secretary. From 1978 to 1990 he tutored at Wesley College, Bristol, and taught church history in the department of theology at the University of Bristol. He interrupted his teaching to study for the Oxford Diploma in Theology (awarded 1987) at Ripon College Cuddesdon. In 1987 he was ordained a deacon in the Church of England and from 1987 to 1988 he served as a non-stipendiary minister at All Saints' Clifton with St John's in the Diocese of Bristol. However, in response to a motion put before the General Synod in 1987 by Tony Higton regarding the sexuality of clergy, he declined ordination to the priesthood and ceased to minister at Clifton.\n\nRegarding the conflict between his homosexuality and the Church of England and his own retreat from orthodoxy he said:\n\nI was ordained Deacon. But, being a gay man, it was just impossible to proceed further, within the conditions of the Anglican set-up, because I was determined that I would make no bones about who I was; I was brought up to be truthful, and truth has always mattered to me. The Church couldn't cope and so we parted company. It was a miserable experience.\nMacCulloch was awarded a Doctor of Divinity (DD) degree by the University of Oxford in 2001; the DD is the highest degree awarded by the university.\n\nIn 1996 his book \"Thomas Cranmer: A Life\" won the James Tait Black Memorial Prize. His 2003 book \"\" won the 2004 National Book Critics Circle Award, the 2004 British Academy Book Prize and the Wolfson History Prize. \"\" was published in September 2009 with a related 6-part television series called \"A History of Christianity\" which first aired on BBC4 in 2009 and then on BBC2 and BBC4 in 2010. The book won McGill University's Cundill Prize, a $75,000 prize, the largest such prize in Canada at the time.\n\nIn 2012, he wrote and presented \"How God Made the English\", a three-part documentary series tracing the history of English identity from the Dark Ages to the present day. In 2013 he presented a documentary on Thomas Cromwell and his place in English ecclesiastical and political history. His 2015 series \"Sex and the Church\" on BBC Two explored how Christianity has shaped western attitudes to sex, gender and sexuality throughout history.\n\nIn 2018, MacCulloch published the biography \"Thomas Cromwell: A Life\". MacCulloch sits on the European Advisory Board of Princeton University Press.\n\nMacCulloch was elected a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London (FSA) in 1978, a Fellow of the Royal Historical Society (FRHistS) in 1982, and a Fellow of the British Academy (FBA) in 2001. In 2003, he was awarded an honorary Doctor of Letters (DLitt) degree by the University of East Anglia. He was knighted in the 2012 New Year Honours for services to scholarship. While Debretts gives his formal style as \"Prof Sir\", MacCulloch has expressed the preference that he not be addressed in that manner, in accordance with protocol which dictates that clergy holding knighthoods are addressed as \"Sir\" only if so honoured before their ordination.\n\n\nThree-part interview conducted by Henk de Berg (2018)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He and his twin brother were converted to the faith once their mother did so while both became ordained priests and Carmelite friars. But, unlike his brother he retreated into the desert to a hermitage after his ordination. But, he emerged once he was instructed to go to the Italian mainland to evangelize as well as to meet with Pope Honorius III to have him approve a new rule for the Carmelites.\n\nHe was slain whilst preaching and was believed a saint after his death. The Carmelites venerated him as such until Pope Pius II beatified the slain priest during his pontificate circa 1459.\n\nHe was born in Jerusalem in 1185 to the Jewish parents Jesse and Maria. His mother later converted to Roman Catholicism, and both he and his twin brother John were baptised when she converted. His parents died while he was in his childhood and the Patriarch Nicodemus oversaw their education until the twins turned eighteen. He and his brother John entered the Carmelites aged eighteen at the Saint Anne convent near the Golden Gate to commence their novitiate. The two could speak Greek as well as both Latin and Hebrew.\n\nIn 1210, he was ordained to the priesthood in Jerusalem and he travelled in Palestine. Miraculous cures were attributed to him around this time and his \"acta\" stated that he sought to avoid fame and withdrew to a hermitage in the desert (in imitation of Jesus Christ) when he was becoming popular for his miracles. He remained as a hermit on Mount Carmel when he was instructed in 1218 to leave for the Italian peninsula in order to preach against the patarini as well as the Albigensians and the Bulgars. He had likewise been instructed to go to Rome to obtain from Pope Honorius III confirmation of the new and definitive rule for the order (later granted in 1226).\n\nHe set off on a Genoese ship on 1 April 1219 and stopped first in Messina before heading off to Civitavecchia before he ended up in Rome to meet with the pope. The friar preached in the Basilica of Saint John Lateran while in Rome where he met both Saint Francis of Assisi and Saint Dominic. It is said that he foretold that Francis would receive the stigmata while Francis foretold his premature death. From there, he was a guest of the Basilians in Palermo where he was for over a month before preaching in Agrigento for over a month before settling in Licata. He had healed seven lepers and the ailing Archbishop of Palermo Bernardo de Castanea while in Palermo. He settled on the Sicilian island though his fame as a wonderworker caused crowds to flock to him. He also had success in converting some Jews though most Jews in Palermo came to despise him for this since he himself was once Jewish.\n\nHe wanted to convert a Cathar knight named Berenger (known also in sources as Berengarius). Tradition states that Berenger was living in incest and that the friar convinced the knight's companion to leave Berenger. Berenger became enraged and had him attacked in front of the church of Santi Filippo e Giacomo in Licata on 1 May 1220, and was struck with Berenger's sword five times. He died of his wounds within the week of 5 May and according to tradition asked for his assassin to be pardoned while urging the faithful not to avenge his death. He was buried at Santi Filippo e Giacomo.\n\nHis sepulcher at Licata became a site of pilgrimage. The Carmelites venerated him as a saint since at least 1456 and the cult received papal approval from Pope Pius II at some stage during the latter's pontificate. In 1486, his remains were moved from a wooden casket to a silver urn before being moved to a more precious urn on 5 May 1623. His relics were translated to a new church in Licata on 15 August 1662, and are now housed at ; the ending of a plague in the Kingdom of Naples in 1656, was attributed to his intercession. Since 4 May 1626, he has been known as the patron saint for Palermo.\n\n\n"}

Similar to his other cartoons, he utilizes a minimalist stick-figure technique.\n\nThe film was invited into Official Competition at the 1999 Cannes Film Festival (where Hertzfeldt was the youngest director involved), and it won the Grand Jury Award at the 1999 Slamdance Film Festival.\n\nOn top of its film festival runs (and subsequent popularity online), the short has also appeared on Adult Swim and MTV in the US and on a number of international TV broadcasts around the world. Hertzfeldt has noted that the short's international popularity is likely because it has no dialogue and plays like a silent film.\n\nA stick figure toddler (presumably named Billy) is repeatedly attacked by his red balloon. No explanation for how or why the balloon is doing so is ever given. Similar events are shown to be occurring with other children as the short progresses. The story is considered a parody of French film director Albert Lamorisse's 1956 short film \"Le ballon rouge\".\n\nThere have been many interpretations on what themes the short represents, but Hertzfeldt intentionally avoids talking about them, as to not invalidate the personal experiences the audience has with the film.\n\n\"Billy's Balloon\" was featured on the DVD, \"Don Hertzfeldt Volume 1\", a compilation of Hertzfeldt's short films from 1995-2005.

The album was released on April 2, 1975, a month after the release of the single \"Good Lovin' Gone Bad\" and four months before the album's second single \"Feel Like Makin' Love\" (see 1975 in music).\n\nThe album reached number 3 in the UK Albums Chart and the US \"Billboard\" 200. It was certified gold (500,000 units sold) by the Recording Industry Association of America a month after its release. The album was remastered and re-released in 1994.\n\nMick Ralphs and Simon Kirke stated on \"In the Studio\" (which devoted an episode to \"Straight Shooter\") that the track \"Shooting Star\" (which they did not write) was lyrically inspired by the drug and alcohol-related deaths of Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, and Jim Morrison.\n\nIn June 1974, Bad Company released their self-titled debut album. Three months later, the band and recording engineer Ron Nevison recorded at least eight songs at Clearwell Castle in Gloucestershire, England. Sometime later Nevison mixed the songs for \"Straight Shooter\" at Air Studios in London. The sleeve for the album was designed by Hipgnosis, who also designed their debut album.\n\nThe first single from the album, \"Good Lovin' Gone Bad\", was released in March 1975 and reached No. 36 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. The album was released in April. The album's final single \"Feel like Makin' Love\" was released in August and reached No. 10 on the Hot 100.\n\n\"Straight Shooter\" received different reviews from different music critics. Gautam Baksi's review of the album for Allmusic said that the album's popularity was attributed to the acoustic ballads \"Shooting Star\" and \"Feel like Makin' Love\", while the two songs written by Simon Kirke—\"Anna\" and \"Weep No More\"—as well as the album not having enough supporting songs and follow-up singles, were what made the album less successful than its predecessor. Robert Christgau felt that although \"Straight Shooter\" was better than its predecessor, it should not be labelled hard rock because Paul Rodgers did not have a strong voice, which is needed to be a rock singer. Ed Naha's feeling of the album, as stated in \"Rolling Stone\" magazine, was much more favourable than Christgau's. Naha thought that, with their second album, Bad Company was proving that they would not end up like Mott the Hoople, Free, or King Crimson—bands that Bad Company's members used to be part of. Naha also thought that Simon Kirke's \"Anna\" was as bad as it was when it was first recorded, but that \"Weep No More\" showed that he was progressing as a writer, while Boz Burrell was also making progress on the bass.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It allows graduates to proceed to legal training before qualifying to practice as either a barrister or a solicitor in Hong Kong. The \"LL.\" of the abbreviation for the certificate is from the genitive plural \"legum\" (of lex, legis f., law). The programme can be seen as the equivalent of the Legal Practice Course (LPC) or the Bar Professional Training Course (BPTC) in England and Wales, or the Certificate in Legal Practice (Malaysia) (CLP) in Malaysia which focuses heavily on practical and procedural issues in legal practice, unlike a first degree in law.\n\nThere are three course providers in Hong Kong: \n\nAs in England and Wales, the legal profession in Hong Kong consists of two branches: solicitors and barristers.\nAfter successfully completing the PCLL:\n\n\nTo be eligible for admission to the courses leading to the PCLL, an applicant must have completed their Bachelor of Laws (LL.B.) or equivalent legal studies either in Hong Kong or other common law jurisdictions, or, for non-law graduates, have passed the Graduate Diploma in English and Hong Kong Law (GDEHKL) of Hong Kong or the Common Professional Examinations (CPE/GDL) of England and Wales.\n\nApplicant will have to demonstrate competence in the following eleven 'Core' subjects: Contract, Tort, Constitutional Law, Criminal Law, Land Law, Equity, Civil Procedure, Criminal Procedure, Evidence, Business Associations, and Commercial Law; and three 'Top-up' subjects: Hong Kong Constitutional Law, Hong Kong Legal System and Hong Kong Land Law. \nThe degree or qualification must be in common law, and should include passes in eleven core subjects, including the following (or equivalent):\n\nSix of these must be completed as part of a student's main law qualification: Contract, Tort, Constitutional Law, Criminal Law, Property Law and Equity.\n\nConversion examinations are offered twice a year for the remaining five subjects.\n\nStudents may complete these core subjects:\n\nFrom September 2008 onwards, all candidates with overseas qualifications (i.e. not graduating with a law degree from local universities) must demonstrate competence in the following areas to be eligible for the PCLL:\n\n\nStudents may do so:\n\nThe effect of these requirements is that PCLL entrants who wish to avoid the need to sit additional conversion examinations in these three subjects must either enroll on the Graduate Diploma in English and Hong Kong Law, which is jointly offered by the University of Hong Kong's School of Professional and Continuing Education (HKU SPACE) as the course operator and Manchester Metropolitan University as the qualification awarding institution, or enroll with the law faculty of one of the three universities awarding LLB or JD degrees in Hong Kong.\n\nIn addition to the above admission requirements, all students applying for PCLL must take the IELTS English proficiency test (Academic Module), the results of which is not earlier than three years preceding the closing date for applications.

Course content is identical in the first semester. In the second semester, while the subjects taken remain identical for both streams, CPC students focus more on the commercial aspect (letter writing, agreement drafting, etc.), while Litigation students focus more on the advocacy, pleadings drafting and opinion writing aspects.\n\nAs all barristers must have taken the Litigation stream, many students wishing to leave their options open may opt for Litigation even if they plan to be a solicitor in the short term, to avoid having to retake the PCLL.\n\nIn 2008–09, course syllabuses are undergoing some change and may not reflect the above.\n\nThere are eleven core courses: Interlocutory Advocacy and Interviewing; Trial Advocacy; Mediation and Negotiation; Litigation Writing and Drafting; Commercial Writing and Drafting; Conveyancing Practice; Wills and Probate Practice; Corporate and Commercial Practice; Civil Litigation Practice; Criminal Litigation Practice; and Professional Conduct and Practice.\n\nIn the second term, students must also take three electives which include the Bar Course; Foundations in Mainland Related Legal Transactions; International Arbitration Practice; Family Law Practice; Personal Injuries Practice; Financial Regulatory Practice; and Chinese for Legal Practice.\n\nThe programme is taught in two stages. In the first term, five compulsory subjects involve the study of core practice areas necessary for progression into the second term: Professional Practice, Commercial Practice, Property and Probate Practice, Civil Litigation Practice, and Criminal Litigation Practice.\n\nIn the second term, students are free to choose five electives which builds upon the core skills and knowledge from the first term. Though there is no streaming in the PCLL programme between intending Barristers and Solicitors, students who intend to seek admission as a Barrister in Hong Kong must undertake the following three courses: Trial Advocacy (taught intensively in the summer term), Writing & Drafting Litigation Documents, and Conference Skills and Opinion Writing.\n\n$135,000 for non-local students\n$120,000 for non-local students\nPayable in two annual instalments of $101,750 each\n\nHKU's intake is currently approximately 260 (full-time) and 80 (part-time), with approximately 70–80 of those from its own LLB programme.

Previously, all HKU LLB graduates would have been admitted into its PCLL programme; now, just over two-thirds are admitted (i.e. at least a decent honours in the LLB). Non-HKU LLB students usually require a honours.\n\nIn 2007–08, 170 places were government-funded and 117 were self-funded.\n\nThe CityU PCLL intake is currently around 210 students per year, with approximately 100 of those from its own LL.B. and J.D. programmes.

{"id": "1833034", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1833034", "title": "Mad Gasser of Mattoon", "text": "Mad Gasser of Mattoon\n\nThe Mad Gasser of Mattoon (also known as the \"Anesthetic Prowler,\" Friz, the \"Phantom Anesthetist,\" or simply the \"Mad Gasser\") was the name given to the person or people believed to be responsible for a series of apparent gas attacks that occurred in Mattoon, Illinois, during the mid-1940s. More than two dozen separate cases of gassings were reported to police over the span of two weeks, in addition to many more reported sightings of the suspected assailant. The gasser's supposed victims reported smelling strange odors in their homes which were soon followed by symptoms such as paralysis of the legs, coughing, nausea and vomiting. No one died or had serious medical consequences.\n\nPolice remained skeptical of the accounts throughout the entire incident. No physical evidence was ever found, and many reported gassings had simple explanations, such as spilled nail polish or odors emanating from animals or local factories. Victims made quick recoveries from their symptoms and suffered no long-term effects. Nevertheless, local newspapers ran alarmist articles about the reported attacks and treated the accounts as fact.\n\nThe attacks are widely considered to be simply a case of mass hysteria. However, others maintain that the Mad Gasser actually existed, or that the perceived attacks have another explanation, such as industrial pollution.\n\nMost contemporary descriptions of the Mad Gasser are based on the testimony of Mr. and Mrs. Bert Kearney of 1408 Marshall Avenue, the victims of the first Mattoon case to be reported by the media. They described the gasser as being a tall, thin man dressed in dark clothing and wearing a tight-fitting cap. Another report, made some weeks later, described the gasser as being a female dressed as a man. The Gasser had also been described as carrying a flit gun, an agricultural tool for spraying pesticide, which he purportedly used to expel the gas.\n\nThe first of the 1944 gasser incidents occurred at a house on Grant Ave., Mattoon, on August 31, 1944. Urban Raef was awakened during the early hours of the morning by a strange odor. He felt nauseated and weak, and suffered from a fit of vomiting. Suspecting that he was suffering from domestic gas poisoning, Raef's wife tried to check the kitchen stove to see if there was a problem with the pilot light, but found that she was partially paralyzed and unable to leave her bed.\n\nLater that night (some contemporary accounts refer to the time as the morning of the following day), a similar incident was also reported by a young mother living close by. She was awakened by the sound of her daughter coughing but found herself unable to leave her bed.\n\nThe next day, September 1, there was a third reported incident. A Mrs. Kearney, of Marshall Avenue, Mattoon, reported smelling a strong, sweet odor around 11:00 pm. At first she dismissed the smell, believing it to be from flowers outside of the window, but the odor soon became stronger and she began to lose feeling in her legs. Mrs. Kearney panicked and her calls attracted her sister, Mrs. Ready, who was in the house at the time. Mrs. Ready also noticed the odor, and determined that it was coming from the direction of the bedroom window, which was open at the time. The police were contacted, but no evidence of a prowler was found. At around 12:30 am, Bert Kearney, Mrs. Kearney's husband (a local taxi driver who had been absent during the time of the attack), returned home to find an unidentified man hiding close to one of the house's windows. The man fled and Kearney was unable to catch him. Kearney's description of the prowler was of a tall man dressed in dark clothing, wearing a tight fitting cap. This description was reported in the local media, and became the common description of the gasser throughout the Mattoon incident. After the attack, Mrs. Kearney reported suffering from a burning sensation on her lips and throat, which were attributed to the effects of the gas.\n\nInitially, it was suspected that robbery was the primary motive for the attack. At the time of the incidents, the Kearneys had a large sum of money in the house, and it was surmised that the prowler could have seen Mrs. Kearney and her sister counting it earlier that evening. Local newspapers incorrectly reported this incident as being the first gasser attack.\n\nIn the days following the Kearney attack, there were half a dozen similar attacks (See table), though none of the purported victims were able to provide a clear description of the prowler, and no clues were found at the scene of the attacks. The first specimen of physical evidence was found on the night of September 5, when Carl and Beulah Cordes of North 21st Street returned home around 10:00 pm. After spending a few minutes in the house they noticed a piece of white cloth, slightly larger than a man's handkerchief, sitting on their porch next to the screen door. Beulah Cordes picked up the cloth and smelled it. As soon as she inhaled, she became violently ill. She described the effect as being similar to an electric shock. Her face quickly began to swell, she experienced a burning sensation in her mouth and throat, and began to vomit. As with other victims, she also reported feeling weak and experiencing partial paralysis of her legs. Beulah Cordes later hypothesized that the cloth had been left on the porch in order to knock out the family dog, which usually slept there, so that the prowler could gain access to the house unnoticed.\n\nIn addition to the cloth, a skeleton key, described as looking \"well used,\" was reportedly found on the sidewalk adjacent to the porch, along with a large, almost empty, tube of lipstick. The cloth was analyzed by the authorities, but they found no chemicals on it that could explain Beulah Cordes' reaction.\n\nThe same night a second incident was reported, this time in North 13th Street, at the home of Mrs. Leonard Burrell. She reported seeing a stranger break in through her bedroom window and then attempt to gas her.\n\nPublic concern over the alleged gassings quickly rose, the FBI became involved, and the local police issued a statement calling on residents to avoid lingering in residential areas, and warning that groups set up to patrol for the gasser should be disbanded for reasons of public safety. Chief of Police C.E. Cole also warned concerned citizens to exercise due restraint when carrying or discharging firearms.\n\nDuring this period, there was also an increase in physical evidence of attacks being reported, ranging from footprints allegedly being discovered underneath windows to tears being found in window screens.\n\nBy September 12, local police had received so many false alarms (mostly from citizens believing that they smelled gas, or that they had seen a prowler) that they reduced the priority afforded to gasser reports and announced that the entire incident was likely the result of explainable occurrences exacerbated by public fears, and a sign of the anxiety felt by women while local men were on war service.\n\nAfter the police announcement, gasser reports declined. The only incident of arguable note after that date was the case of Bertha Burch, who claimed she saw a gasser who was a woman dressed as a man.\n\n(List incomplete) \n\nThere are three primary theories about the Mattoon Mad Gasser incident: mass hysteria, industrial pollution, or an actual physical assailant. The events have also been written about by authors on the paranormal.\n\nAlmost two weeks after the Mattoon attacks began, the local Commissioner of Public Health, Thomas V. Wright, announced that there had undoubtedly been a number of gassing incidents, but that many instances were likely due to hysteria: residents hearing of alarming events, and then panicking when confronted by an out-of-place odor or a shadow at the window; Wright stated:\n\nOn September 12, local Chief of Police C. E. Cole took Wright's hypothesis a step further, announcing that there had likely been no gas attacks at all, and that the reported incidents had probably been triggered by chemicals carried on the wind from nearby industrial facilities and then exacerbated by public panic.\n\nWright and Cole's diagnosis was given further validity in 1945 when the \"Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology\" published \"The 'phantom anesthetist' of Mattoon: a field study of mass hysteria\" by Donald M. Johnson, which documented the Mattoon incident as a case study in mass hysteria. In 1959, his opinion was seconded by psychologist James P. Chaplin, and went on to form the basis for several subsequent studies of the phenomena of mass hysteria.\n\nMost of the physical symptoms recorded during the Botetourt and Mattoon incidents (including choking, swelling of mucus membranes, and weakness/temporary paralysis) have all been suggested symptoms of hysteria.\nSome experts believe that the mass hysteria was fueled by the headline in the \"Mattoon Journal-Gazette\", \"Mrs. Kearney and Daughter First Victims,\" which assumed there would be more attacks.\n\nOn September 12, Chief of Police Cole told a press conference that odors and symptoms reported may have been the result of pollutants or toxic waste released by nearby industrial plants, and speculated that carbon tetrachloride or trichloroethylene, both of which have a sweet odor and can induce symptoms similar to those reported by purported gasser victims, may have been the substance released.\n\nIn response to Cole's statement, Atlas-Imperial, the primary company implicated in this affair, released a statement of its own saying that their facility had only five gallons of carbon tetrachloride in stock, which was contained in firefighting equipment. Atlas-Imperial officials also denied that any quantities of trichloroethylene (an industrial solvent used by Atlas) could be responsible for sickness in the town, reasoning that it would have taken significant quantities of the chemical to sicken the townspeople, and that factory workers would have experienced similar symptoms long before anybody outside of the factory was affected.\n\nAt the time of the gassing, the Atlas plant had been certified as safe by the State Department of Health.\n\nAfter analyzing events, some researchers have concluded that at least some of the gasser incidents were the work of an actual attacker who carried out a series of gassings as reported by witnesses.\n\nSome writers on the paranormal have covered the events. Clark (1993) describes an illustration of the Gasser from Loren Coleman's \"Mysterious America\": \"[the artist] depicts him as a not-quite-human, possibly extraterrestrial, being\".\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1833045", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1833045", "title": "The Long Journey", "text": "The Long Journey\n\nThe Long Journey () is a series of six novels by Danish author and poet Johannes V. Jensen, appearing between 1908 and 1922. The books deal with the author's theories on evolution, backdropped against a description of humanity from pre-Ice Age up to the voyage of Christopher Columbus. The work is fictional, weaving in Jensen's stylistic mythic prose with his personal views on Darwinian evolutionary theory. It was primarily for this work that Jensen received the Nobel Prize in literature in 1944.\n\nThere are three editions of the text; first, the original six-volume Danish novels; secondly, a three-volume English edition, translated by Arthur G. Chater, published during 1923-1924; and finally, a two-volume edition published in 1938. Under the three volume English edition, books one and two fall under the title \"Fire and Ice\", while books three and four are called \"The Cimbrians\". The final two books were published under the title \"Christopher Columbus\".\n\nThe first two books take place somewhere in the primeval forests of Europe near a huge volcano. Fire glows on its summit and sometimes burning lava pours down the slopes, destroying everything in its path. For countless ages, primitive man has worshipped the fire-god in dumb terror. But at last comes the first great moment in the history of mankind: the emergence from the herd of a man with a mind and a will, a Prometheus.\n\nFearlessly confronting the unknown, he solves the riddle of fire and brings it down on a torch to serve man. With it he lights campfires to keep off wild beasts. But he does much more. Observing the movements of the stars he infers the notion of time, the first abstract idea won from the darkness of chaos. He also takes the first step toward civilized intercourse between individuals, discovering tenderness in sexual relations, the inaugural burgeoning of what we know as love. In the end he dies a prophet's death at the hands of the obtuse masses, but he bequeathes a rich legacy to posterity.\n\nThe next two books, with a second prehistoric patriarch, begins after another measureless lapse of time. The world has changed now, the volcano is extinct, the climate cooling. There is a general migration to the south. But one man sets off in the opposite direction to grapple with hardship. He is a sort of Cain, a slayer avoided by his fellow men, whom he holds in such contempt that he does not even condescend to take their god, fire, with him to the icy lands of the North. Defying the cold, he grows hardy and strong. With a woman who has somehow found her way up there he becomes the father of the Nordic race which is so dear to Jensen, who follows its destiny.\n\nHe rediscovers fire, not simply borrowing it as before but by a stroke of genius striking it out of two minerals. And thus he founds a new civilization.\n\nThe theme is repeated in the third and fourth book with another genius who invents means of locomotion: wagons and boats driven by oar or sail. The men of the North, ready now to listen to the old call to the summer lands, begin the long journey proper.\n\nThe later books describing the journey take us down to historical times: we see the Cimbrians marching on Rome and the Vikings' raids. But the story does not end until Columbus realizes that dream of a tropical paradise which is the leading idea of the book.\n\n"}

It is the largest mall in British Columbia, and the third-largest in Canada behind Alberta's West Edmonton Mall and Ontario's Square One Shopping Centre, with 27million customer visits annually. The mall is located adjacent to Metrotown station on the SkyTrain rapid transit system. Three office buildings are part of the complex along Central Boulevard.\n\nMetrotown Centre opened in 1986 – attached to a new Woodward's department store, and a Sears Canada department store that had been operating there since the early 1950s – on land that had held a Ford Canada motor factory, warehouses, other light industry, and a supermarket, and which was adjacent to the former Vancouver Interurban Rail line (now the route for the SkyTrain). The mall has been expanded and renovated several times, and has contributed to the rapid growth of the area's population. A new Bay store and an expansion wing was added in 1992.\n\nTwo additional shopping centres were constructed adjacent to the original Metrotown – Eaton Centre and Station Square. These three different malls were connected by pedestrian overpasses, as were the two office towers known as the Metrotowers. In 1998, Eaton Centre added Metropolis, a collection of stores aimed towards younger shoppers, including SilverCity which opened in 1998 and Rainforest Cafe which opened in June 1998 (but was permanently closed in October 2001). The name Metropolis came to apply to Eaton Centre once its main tenant, Eaton's department store, shut down. In 2005, a major expansion project combined Metrotown and Metropolis into a megamall, and added many new stores and Western Canada's largest food court. Following this expansion, the two malls became one entity under the name \"Metropolis at Metrotown\". Station Square, however, has not been included in this megamall, and as of 2013, it is being demolished to make way for a new high-rise complex, to be named after Station Square.\n\nConstruction on Metrotower III, located immediately south of the other two office towers, began in the summer of 2008, was put on hold, and was completed in April 2014. This completed the Metrotower complex. \n\nIn January 2018, Sears Canada closed as the company went out of business.\n\nThe Metrotown neighbourhood is home to a number of smaller shopping centres. The pedestrian overpass originally connecting Station Square to the SkyTrain station was closed in November 2016, and is awaiting demolition. Pedestrians needing to get to and from the SkyTrain station and the shopping center are now required to use the street access. The Asian-themed Crystal Mall opened near Metropolis in 2000, but has no direct connection. Old Orchard Centre is another shopping centre located nearby that is considered part of the Metrotown district. It is a strip plaza that predates the other shopping centres in the neighbourhood.\n\nThe complex consists of over 450 shops and services; the anchors are Hudson's Bay, Walmart, Toys \"R\" Us, T & T Supermarket, Sport Chek, Indigo Books and Music, H&M, Old Navy, Real Canadian Superstore, Urban Behavior, Winners/HomeSense, Zara, Cineplex Cinemas, Uniqlo and Muji.\n\nFood chains include Chipotle, Jinya, Menchie's, and Uncle Tetsu's.\n\nImmediately below the Central Boulevard entrance and covered walkway is a bus loop and exchange, which is a major hub for services coming in from other parts of Burnaby as well as Vancouver, Richmond, and New Westminster. The mall is also served by Metrotown station on the Expo Line of the SkyTrain network.\n\nIn October 2019, Burnaby city council approved a long-term master plan that will eventually replace the mall with a downtown neighborhood with new high rises, retail space, streets, and pedestrian plazas.\n\n\n"}

He became Superintendent of San Jose Schools, and in 1861 he travelled with William H. Brewer and Charles F. Hoffmann to the summit of a nearby mountain, as part of the initial California Geological Survey. That mountain, Mount Hamilton, is named after him.\n\nIn 1864 Hamilton became pastor of the First Presbyterian Church of Oakland, his sermons appearing in the Oakland Daily Tribune. He served on the Oakland Board of Education from 1866 to 1872. In 1869, Hamilton came under scrutiny for teaching the doctrine of \"a second probation after death\" (stating one has a second, chance of salvation). He was charged with heresy and forced to leave his pastorate and resign from his ordination in the Presbyterian church. Most of his parishioners joined him in forming the First Independent Presbyterian Church, later to become the Independent Church of Oakland. In 1879 the church joined the American Unitarian Association and became the First Unitarian Church of Oakland.\n\nWhile preaching on Easter Sunday, 1882, Hamilton spoke \"We know not what matter is...\" and then collapsed onto the ground, dead.

It is associated with Tsushima Province on Tsushima Island in modern-day Nagasaki Prefecture.\nIn the han system, Tsushima was a political and economic abstraction based on periodic cadastral surveys and projected agricultural yields. In other words, the domain was defined in terms of \"kokudaka\", not land area. This was different from the feudalism of the West.\n\nThe Sō clan was one of few \"daimyō\" clans during the Edo period which continued to control the same fiefs it controlled previously. Although it fought against Tokugawa Ieyasu at the battle of Sekigahara, the Sō clan was allowed by the shogunate to continue to rule Tsushima and entrusted it to diplomatic negotiations and trade with Joseon Korea. Its services included receptions of Korean missions to Japan. The Fuchū domain sold imports and bought exports in Osaka and Kyoto. It negotiated trade and diplomacy with the Nagasaki Commissioner in Nagasaki. It had an office in Busan where daily trade and diplomatic service were conducted.\n\nThe Fuchū domain was given the status of a 100,000 \"koku\"-class \"han\" although its real production was below 30,000 \"koku\", on account of its important diplomatic status, and economic wealth as a result of trade with Korea. In the late 17th century, it prospered in Korean trade and with silver mines, but from the 18th century, it suffered from trade depression and depletion of silver ores. Its economic reforms and the shogunate's constant aid did not improve its finances. Increasing threats of Western imperial powers weighed heavily on the Fuchū domain. In 1861, a Russian naval ship occupied a port of Tsushima. What was worse for Tsushima was a growing internal conflict between pro- and anti-shogunate retainers. In 1862, it concluded an alliance with the Chōshū Domain, which was one of the prominent leaders of the \"Sonnō-jōi\" movement. But the anti-shogunate faction was purged in 1864. The loss of human resources prevented Tsushima from playing a significant role at the Meiji Restoration.\n\nThe last \"daimyō\" of Tsushima, Sō Shigemasa (Yoshiaki) became Governor of Izuhara Prefecture in 1869 and after the Abolition of the han system was given the title of Count (\"hakushaku\") in 1884. The diplomatic service with Korea was taken over by the new Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nThe hereditary \"daimyōs\" were head of the Sō clan and head of the domain.\n\n\n\n"}

That is, it includes people making sincere suicide attempts, those making parasuicidal gestures, people BASE jumping from a building illegally, and those attempting to escape conditions that they perceive as posing greater risk than would the fall from a jump, and it applies whether or not the fall is fatal. Survivors of falls from hazardous heights are often left with major injuries and permanent disabilities from the impact-related injuries. A frequent scenario is that the jumper will sit on an elevated highway or building-ledge as police attempt to talk them down. Observers sometimes encourage potential jumpers to jump, an effect known as \"suicide baiting\". Almost all falls from beyond about 10 stories are fatal, although people have survived much higher falls than this, even onto land surfaces. For example, one suicidal jumper has survived a fall from the 39th story of a building, as has a non-suicidal person who accidentally fell from the 47th floor. Suicidal jumpers have sometimes injured or even killed people on the ground who they land on top of.\n\nJumping makes up only 3% of suicides in the US and Europe- a much smaller percentage than is generally perceived by the public. Jumping is surprisingly infrequent because tall buildings are often condo or office buildings not accessible to the general public, and because open air areas of high buildings (i.e. rooftop restaurants or pools) often are surrounded by high walls that are built precisely to prevent suicides. Jumping makes up 20% of suicides in New York City and more than half of suicides in Hong Kong, due to the prevalence of publicly accessible skyscrapers in the cities.\n\nThe term was brought to prominence in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks, in which approximately 200 people at the point of impact or trapped above the point of impact in the North and South towers of the World Trade Center jumped to escape the fire and the smoke caused by the direct impact of Flights 11 and 175. Many of these jumpers were inadvertently captured on both television and amateur footage, even though television networks reporting on the tragedy attempted to avoid showing the jumpers falling to avoid traumatizing viewers even more.\n\nThe highest documented suicide jump was by skydiver Charles \"Nish\" Bruce, who killed himself by leaping without a parachute from an airplane, at an altitude of over .\n\n"}

She was the older cousin and first wife of Emperor Wu of Han until her deposition in 130 BC for committing witchcraft.\n\nEmpress Chen was the daughter of Chen Wu (陳午), the Marquess of Tangyi (堂邑侯), and Liu Piao (劉嫖), the Eldest Princess Guantao (館陶長公主, the older sister of Emperor Jing of Han). She also had two brothers, Chen Xu (陳須) and Chen Jiao (陳蟜). There were no authentic historical records of her real name, and the well-known name \"A'Jiao\" came from a pseudohistoric fable titled \"Hanwu Stories\" (漢武故事), thought to be written during the Wei-Jin period.\n\nPrincess Guantao initially proposed to marry her teenage daughter to Liu Rong (劉榮), Emperor Jing's eldest son and crown prince at the time, as well as son of his favourite concubine, Lady Li (栗姬). However, Lady Li rudely rejected the proposal as she was upset that Princess Guantao often procured new concubines for Emperor Jing (therefore gaining his favour at the expense of Lady Li). A greatly humiliated and frustrated Princess Guantao then approached Consort Wang Zhi, another concubine favoured by Emperor Jing, and offered to marry her daughter to Consort Wang's 5-year-old son Liu Che, Emperor Jing's tenth (and arguably the favourite) son and then the Prince of Jiaodong (膠東王). Consort Wang, who had been watching quietly from the sidelines, saw her opportunity and welcomed the proposal immediately. This political marriage secured an alliance between them. They then plotted together to ensure that Emperor Jing became increasingly annoyed at Lady Li. Coupled with Lady Li's own foolishness, it eventually resulted in the deposition of Liu Rong, who was demoted from crown prince to the Prince of Linjiang (臨江王) in 150 BC and exiled out of the capital Chang'an. Lady Li died soon after, and Liu Rong was arrested two years later for illegally seizing imperial shrine lands and committed suicide in custody.\n\nHowever, the union between Liu Che and Chen was not initially approved by Emperor Jing, as their age difference was inappropriate (Chen was at least 8~9 years older than Liu Che). According to \"Hanwu Stories\", during a royal gathering, Princess Guantao held the young prince in her arms and asked him whether he wanted to marry a girl. After rejecting the choice of dozens of palace maids, Princess Guantao eventually showed her daughter to Liu Che, who bragged that he would \"build a golden house for her\" if they were married. (This inspired the Chinese idiom \"Hiding Jiao in a golden house\" , which later ironically became a term for keeping a \"mistress\" rather than a wife.) Princess Guantao then used the tale as proof that the marriage was destined to happen to convince Emperor Jing, who finally agreed to the arranged marriage.\n\nLiu Che was later created crown prince at the age of 7, and formally married Chen as the empress-designate some years later. When Emperor Jing died in early 141 BC, the 16-year-old heir apparent Liu Che ascended to the throne as Emperor Wu, and formally made his newly-wed wife Empress not long after.\n\nThe Han Dynasty up to this point was run according to a Taoist \"wu wei\" (無為而治) ideology, championing economic freedom and government decentralization. Foreign policy-wise, periodic \"heqin\" was used to maintain a \"de jure\" \"peace\" with the nomadic Xiongnu confederacy to the north. These policies were important in stimulating economic recovery following the post-Qin Dynasty civil war, but not without drawbacks. The non-interventionist policies resulted in loss of monetary regulation and political control by the central government, allowing the feudal vassal states to become dominant and unruly, culminating in the Rebellion of the Seven States during Emperor Jing's reign. Nepotism among the ruling classes also stagnated social mobility, as well as encouraged rampant disregard of laws by nobles, which led to the rise of local despots who bullied and oppressed other civilians. The \"heqin \"policy also failed to protect the Han borders against Xiongnu raids, with the nomadic cavalries invading as close as 300 \"li\" from the capital during Emperor Wen's reign. Prominent politicians like Jia Yi (賈誼) and Chao Cuo (晁錯) had both previously advised on the necessity to important policy reforms, but neither Emperor Wen nor Emperor Jing was willing to implement such changes.\n\nUnlike the emperors before him, the young Emperor Wu was unwilling to put up with the \"status quo\". Less than a year after his ascension, based on advice from Confucian scholars, Emperor Wu launched an ambitious reform, known in history as the Jianyuan Reforms (建元新政). However, his reforms threatened the interests of existing noble classes, and was swiftly defeated by his grandmother, Grand Empress Dowager Dou, who held real political power in the Han court. His two noble supporters, Dou Ying (竇嬰) and Tian Fen (田蚡), both had their positions stripped; and his two mentors, Wang Zang (王臧) and Zhao Wan (趙綰), were impeached, arrested and forced to commit suicide in prison. Emperor Wu, who was now deprived of any allies, was subjected to conspiracies to have him removed from the throne.\n\nAt this point, Empress Chen had already married Emperor Wu for years but failed to achieve any pregnancies. In an attempt to remain the centre of his attention, she also prohibited him from keeping other concubines. The fact that the young and energetic Emperor Wu was still childless had been used by his political enemies as an excuse to consider deposing him (the inability to propagate the royal bloodline was a serious matter) and replace him with his distant uncle Liu An (劉安), the King of Huainan (淮南王), who was a renowned figure of Taoist ideology. Emperor Wu's political survival now relied heavily on the lobbying of his aunt/mother-in-law Princess Guantao, who served as a mediator for the Emperor's reconciliation with her mother, Grand Empress Dowager Dou. Princess Guantao wasted no opportunities to exploit this leverage, and constantly made excessive demands from her son-in-law. Emperor Wu, already unhappy with Empress Chen's infertility and poor behavior, was further enraged by her mother's greed, but had to tolerate such abuse under the advice by his mother Empress Dowager Wang to stay put and wait for his chance. He then spent the next few years pretending to be docile, hedonistic and having given up all political ambitions, but in reality was secretly recruiting supporters.\n\nWhile attending an annual spring ceremonial ritual at Bashang (灞上) in 139 BC, during the second year of his reign, Emperor Wu decided to pay a casual visit to his older sister's household on the way back. His sister, Princess Pingyang (平陽公主), who had long intended to imitate her aunt Princess Guantao and establish herself some political leverage, had prepared a collection of young women to offer for her brother's concubinage. However, her plan did not work out, as none of her candidates managed to impress Emperor Wu. Realizing her brother was disappointed and bored, she called in her in-house dancers for entertainment. This time, Emperor Wu set his eyes on a beautiful young singer called Wei Zifu (衛子夫) and had immediately fallen in love with her. Following a romantic encounter with Wei Zifu, Emperor Wu immediately conferred a thousand pieces of gold to his sister as a reward, who in turn offered the new girl to him as a gift. However, after returning to Chang'an, Emperor Wu was forced to abandon Wei Zifu as an insignificant palace maid and neglected her for over a year under pressure from Empress Chen. They did not meet again until Wei Zifu attempted to leave the palace by blending into a queue of maids due to be expelled. With the old love renewed, Wei Zifu soon fell pregnant, effectively clearing Emperor Wu of any speculation of infertility. This ensured her becoming his favourite concubine.\n\nThe sudden rise of a love rival enraged Empress Chen, but she could do little as Wei Zifu was now under the Emperor Wu's direct protection. Princess Guantao then tried to seek vengeance for her daughter, and after finding out that Wei Zifu had a half-brother named Wei Qing (衛青) serving as a horseman in Jianzhang Camp (建章營, Emperor Wu's Royal Guards), she sent men to kidnap and murder Wei Qing. However, Wei Qing was rescued by his friends, a group of palace guards led by Gongsun Ao (公孫敖), who also reported the whole incident to Emperor Wu. As a sign of annoyance towards Empress Chen and her mother, Emperor Wu publicly made Wei Zifu a consort (夫人, a concubine lower only to the empress), appointed Wei Qing to the Chief of Jianzhang Camp (建章監), Chief of Staff (侍中) and Chief Councillor (太中大夫), promoted several other members of the Wei family, and rewarded everyone who contributed to Wei Qing's rescue. Consort Wei Zifu then went on to monopolize Emperor Wu's love for over a decade and bore him three daughters.\n\nEmpress Chen, now having openly fallen out with Emperor Wu, was largely neglected. Frustrated and jealous, she tried in vain to regain her husband's attention by threatening suicide multiple times, which only made Emperor Wu more angry at her. Helpless and despairing, she again turned to her mother to vent her anger. Her mother then confronted and accused Princess Pingyang of sabotaging her daughter's marriage, but was simply brushed off with the statement that Empress Chen lost favour purely because of her own infertility. Baffled by the argument, Empress Chen then spent over 90 million coins seeking treatment, to no avail. However, because Emperor Wu no longer visited her palace since the Wei Qing incident, it was already impossible for her to achieve a pregnancy.\n\nNow having completely lost her husband's love, Empress Chen bore great jealousy and hatred towards Consort Wei. She eventually resorted to the occult as a last-ditch attempt to salvage the situation, and was approached by a witch named Chu Fu (楚服), who claimed she had magical tricks that could help to restore the Emperor's love, as well as curse any concubines Empress Chen disliked. Completely convinced by the witch, Empress Chen conducted rituals with Chu Fu day and night, drank potions, created nailed voodoo dolls of Consort Wei, and slept together \"like husband and wife\" with Chu Fu dressed in men's garment.\n\nWitchcraft was a capital offence according to Han laws, especially if it involved noble families. Empress Chen's association with Chu Fu was soon discovered, and Emperor Wu assigned the infamously feared prosecutor Zhang Tang (張湯) to investigate. After Zhang's massive crackdown, Chu Fu was arrested and executed by decapitation, along with more than 300 other accused individuals. Emperor Wu then issued an edict officially deposing Empress Chen from the position of empress in 130 BC, and exiled her out of the capital Chang'an and placed her under house arrest at the Long Gate Palace (長門宮), a suburban household that Princess Guantao once offered to Emperor Wu as a gift for tolerating her private scandals, although Emperor Wu had promised her aunt that the ex-empress would be supplied with all the daily living necessities.\n\nTwo years later in 128 BC, Consort Wei gave birth to Emperor Wu's first son, Liu Ju, and was created empress for her contribution to the royal bloodline. Her brother Wei Qing or maybe it was her nephew Huo Qubing that would go on to become the most esteemed military general in Han history, further consolidating her position. In 122 BC, Liu Ju was also created crown prince. With the secure establishment of Empress Wei, any chance of Empress Chen's reinstatement was all but gone.\n\nThe now deposed Empress Chen spent the rest of her life in the cheerless, lonely Long Gate Palace. Still refusing to give up, she hired the famous poet Sima Xiangru to compose a song later known as \"The Ode of Long Gate\" (長門賦), hoping it would draw Emperor Wu's sympathy. Although some scholars claimed that Emperor Wu was so touched by the song that he revisited and loved her again, these claims are likely to be just inaccurate fantasies. Historical records indicate that though Emperor Wu rewarded Sima Xiangru for his work, Empress Chen never had any success recapturing Emperor Wu's heart.\n\nOne year after Empress Chen's deposition, her father Chen Wu died. The widowed Princess Guantao, who was already having an adulterous relationship with her 18-year-old godson Dong Yan (董偃), was focused on her young lover and no longer bothered to care about her daughter's misfortune. When Emperor Wu learned of this, he let the scandal slip as a leverage in exchange for Princess Guantao's now submissive behaviour. A few years after Dong's death at the age of 30, the grieving Princess Guantao died in 116 BC, leaving behind a will to be buried with Dong instead of her late husband. During her filial mourning period, her two sons (ex-Empress Chen's brothers) got into a dispute over the inheritance, each committed adultery and incest, and were prosecuted as a result. They both committed suicide the same year and had their marquisates removed. With the downfall of her family, the former empress sank further into depression.\n\nA few years later, the ex-Empress Chen died alone, about 20 years after she was deposed, and was buried east of the Langguan Pavilion (郎官亭) in Baling County (霸陵縣), about 30 li northeast of Chang'an, outside of her ancestral cemeteries.\n\nAs there are no reliable historical records of Empress Chen's birth year, it is almost impossible to accurately calculate her age difference to Emperor Wu. However, Chen Jiao was originally intended to marry Liu Rong, Emperor Wu's eldest brother. Though Liu Rong's birth year was also omitted in historical records, it was possible to estimate his age by looking at historical records.\n\nOne of Emperor Wu's older brothers, Liu Fei (劉非, Emperor Jing's fifth son), was recorded to be 12 years older than Emperor Wu; he was about 15 years old during the Rebellion of the Seven States, while the young Liu Che was only 3. Between Liu Rong and Liu Fei, there were two brothers born to Lady Li (Liu Rong's mother) and one brother born to Liu Fei's mother, meaning Liu Rong was at least 2 years older than Liu Fei and hence at least 14 years older than Emperor Wu. At the time of Princess Guantao's proposal, Liu Rong would have been around the age of 20, meaning that Chen Jiao would have to be at least in the mid-teens (otherwise she would be too young for marriage). Considering Liu Che was only 5 years old at the time of arranged marriage, the age difference between him and his cousin fiancée would be at least 8–9 years.\n\n"}
{"id": "1833124", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1833124", "title": "Wei Zifu", "text": "Wei Zifu\n\nWei Zifu (; died 91 BC), posthumously known as Empress Xiaowu Si (孝武思皇后) or Wei Si Hou (衛思后, \"Empress Wei the Thoughtful\"), was an empress during ancient China's Han dynasty. She was the second wife of the famous Emperor Wu and his spouse of 49 years, and stayed as his empress for 38 years, the second longest in Chinese history (behind only the 42-year reign of Empress Wang, the wife of Ming Dynasty's Wanli Emperor, who came over 1,600 years later). She was the mother of Emperor Wu's heir apparent, Liu Ju, as well as the older half-sister of the famed general Wei Qing, the younger aunt of Huo Qubing, the step-aunt of Han statesman Huo Guang and the great-grandmother of Liu Bingyi.\n\nWei Zifu was born of humble means, to a serf family. She was the fourth child and the youngest daughter of a lowly housemaid/servant at the household of Princess Pingyang (平陽公主), Emperor Wu's older sister. Her father presumably died around the time of her birth, as there were little historic records of most of her family members. Her younger half-brother Wei Qing, born not long after her, was an illegitimate child from an extramarital affair by his mother with a low-level official serving the Princess's household. When Wei Zifu was still young, she was recruited as a singer at the princess' estate, where she was also trained in dancing and the Four Arts.\n\nEmperor Wu's relationship with his newly-wed first wife, Empress Chen, started to strain not long after he ascended to the throne at age 16. Empress Chen was an older cousin who was at least 8 years his senior, and their union was arranged from the political alliance between his mother Consort Wang Zhi (王夫人) and his paternal aunt Eldest Princess Guantao (館陶長公主), when he was barely 6 years old. The marriage was consummated at some point after Emperor Wu was then created the crown prince, but soon soured after Empress Chen was unable to bear him any children after many years. This tension further deteriorated after the young Emperor Wu, whose political survival at the time relied heavily on lobbying from his aunt/mother-in-law after the defeat of his ambitious reform in 140 BC by his grandmother Grand Empress Dowager Dou, was forced to submit to the spoilt and abusive behavior of Empress Chen.\n\nAfter conducting an annual ceremonial ritual at Bashang (灞上) in the spring of 139 BC, Emperor Wu took the opportunity to pay a casual visit to his older sister Princess Pingyang, whose household happened to be nearby. Princess Pingyang, intending to gain favour with her royal brother by imitating the deeds of their aunt Princess Guantao (who gained favor with their father Emperor Jing by routinely procuring new concubines for him), had prepared a collection of young women to offer for her brother's concubinage in order to establish herself political leverage (girls from lowly background like Wei Zifu were however not considered). However, the plan did not work — all her candidates failed to impress the young emperor. Realizing her brother was disappointed and bored, the Princess called in her in-house dancers for entertainment. This time, Emperor Wu set his eyes on Wei Zifu and had immediately fallen for her beauty. Taking the opportunity of visiting the restroom, the young emperor took advantage upon and consummated with the young singer, whom the observant Princess Pingyang had ordered to follow in and serve as a handmaid. Now excited over the romantic encounter, Emperor Wu immediately conferred a thousand sycees of gold to his sister as reward, who in turn offered the new girl to him as a gift. Emperor Wu then took Wei Zifu back to Chang'an, bringing along her younger half-brother Wei Qing as well to serve as a palace stableboy.\n\nHowever, what Wei Zifu would later experience on was far from a lovely Cinderella story. Upon hearing the arrival of the new girl, the extremely jealous and intolerant Empress Chen threw a tantrum and made sure Emperor Wu would abandon his idea of keeping Wei Zifu as a concubine. Wei Zifu was then demoted to an insignificant palace maid and was largely neglected. More than a year later, feeling hopeless with her life inside the palaces, Wei Zifu blended into a queue of palace maids waiting to be expelled (normally those who were too aged or incompetent in palace services) in the hope of getting out. Coincidentally, Emperor Wu happened to be there inspecting the expulsion process, and love soon re-flamed when he saw the tearful girl pleading to go home. By this point, Emperor Wu had just score his first political victory with the successful intervention of Dong'ou and consolidated enough power, and thus no longer needed to appease Empress Chen and Princess Guantao. Wei Zifu was made to stay and fell pregnant very shortly later.\n\nWei Zifu's pregnancy was exciting news for Emperor Wu, who was upset over himself being blamed for Empress Chen's infertility. His throne was previously under threat due to his political clash with conservative factions led by his grandmother during the failed 140 BC reform, and many nobles schemed of deposing him under the excuse of \"being incapable of fathering children\" (the inability to propagate royal bloodline was a serious matter), and making his distant uncle Liu An the successor. This pregnancy cleared Emperor Wu's name and silenced his political enemies, and ensured Wei Zifu becoming favoured over Empress Chen.\n\nEmpress Chen became exceedingly jealous, but could now do little to Wei Zifu as she was under Emperor Wu's direct protection. Empress Chen's mother, Princess Guantao, then attempted to retribute by kidnapping and murder Wei Qing, who was then serving as a horseman in Jianzhang Camp (建章營, Emperor Wu's royal guards). However, Wei Qing was rescued from the princess' estate by his friends — a group of palace guards led by Gongsun Ao (公孫敖), who also reported the entire incident to Emperor Wu. In response and as a sign of annoyance towards Empress Chen and her mother, Emperor Wu publicly made Wei Zifu a consort (夫人, a concubine position lower only to the Empress), and appointed Wei Qing the triple role of Chief of Jianzhang Camp (建章監), Chief of Staff (侍中) and Chief Councillor (太中大夫), effectively making him one of Emperor Wu's closest lieutenants. Consort Wei then went on to monopolize Emperor Wu's love for over a decade, and bore him three daughters.\n\nIn 130 BC, Empress Chen was found to have resorted to witchcraft to curse other concubines in attempt to restore her husband's love to her. Following a huge investigation/crackdown under the widely feared prosecutor Zhang Tang (張湯), which saw the execution of more than 300 people, Empress Chen was officially deposed for this misconduct against imperial moral standards, and exiled out of Chang'an to the remote and lonely Long Gate Palace (長門宮), a suburban household that Princess Guantao once offered to Emperor Wu as a gift for tolerating her scandalous relationship with her godson Dong Yan (董偃).\n\nThe deposition of Empress Chen had left the position open, and Emperor Wu now had no official principal spouse. In 129 BC, Wei Qing, who was already a member of Emperor Wu's \"insider circle\" (內朝) of government officials, led an army of 10,000 cavalry and scored the first proper Han victory against Xiongnu. The following year, Consort Wei gave birth to Emperor Wu's first son, Liu Ju, and the overjoyed Emperor Wu (who was already 29 years of age when the son was born) immediately made her empress later that year. Liu Ju was later created crown prince in 122 BC.\n\nAfter Wei Zifu became Empress, Wei Qing, now considered part of Emperor Wu's extended family, would be entrusted to more prominent roles in the war effort against Xiongnu, and was appointed the Generalissimo (大將軍) of All Armed Forces after his crushing victory over Xiongnu's Worthy Prince of the Right (右賢王) in 124 BC. Empress Wei's nephew Huo Qubing was also a distinguished military tactician with a series of highly successful campaigns over the control of the Hexi Corridor. By 123 BC, the Wei family had five marquesses and achieved top family honour, a remarkable feat for a clan from serf background.\n\nDespite the fact that the rise of the Wei family largely owed credit to the military talent of Wei Qing and Huo Qubing, Wei Zifu was often seen as the backbone of the family. A contemporary folk song sang:\n\nBecause the great achievements of this Wei family, many later Han emperors considered marrying concubines with the surname \"Wei\" as a way of attaining good fortune.\n\nDuring her tenure, Wei Zifu was recorded as a modest, careful and low-key empress, who tried her best to keep her clan members in line and out of trouble. The legendary historian Sima Qian, despite often displaying a sceptical and condescending attitude towards Emperor Wu's extended families, described Empress Wei as \"fine in virtues\" (嘉夫德若斯).\n\nAs the years went by, Emperor Wu's sexual attraction to Empress Wei faded and he began to favour other concubines, including Consort Wang (王夫人), Consort Li (李夫人, the sister of Li Guangli and Li Yannian) and Lady Zhao (趙婕妤, mother of Liu Fuling). However, he continued to respect Empress Wei's judgment and entrusted her to govern palace affairs when he was absent from the capital, and assigned her son Crown Prince Liu Ju as the regent for governmental affairs.\n\nIn his advanced age, Emperor Wu became paranoid and suspicious over the possible use of witchcraft against him. A series of witchcraft persecutions would begin, and large numbers of people, many of whom were high officials and their families, were accused of witchcraft and executed, usually with their clans. Soon, these witchcraft persecutions would become intertwined in the succession struggles and erupt into a major catastrophe.\n\nIn 94 BC, Emperor Wu's youngest son Liu Fuling was born to Lady Zhao, and Emperor Wu was ecstatic in having a child at the advanced age of 62. Lady Zhao herself was introduced to Emperor Wu by some warlock, and was also known as \"Consort Fist\" (拳夫人) or \"Consort Hook\" (鉤弋夫人) due to legend that she was born with a contractured clenched fist, which somehow magically opened up when Emperor Wu massaged it, revealing a jade hook in her palm. Because her pregnancy with Liu Fuling purportedly lasted 14 months long — the same as the mythical Emperor Yao — Emperor Wu decided to name her household \"Gate of Yao's Mother\" (堯母門). This led to speculation that Emperor Wu wanted to get rid of the 38-year-old Liu Ju and replace him with the 3-year-old Liu Fuling as crown prince instead. While there was no evidence that Emperor Wu actually intended to do such a thing, over the next year conspiracies began against Crown Prince Liu Ju and Empress Wei .\n\nOne of the conspirators was Jiang Chong (江充), a high-ranking legal official known for his ruthlessness and opportunism. Jiang once had a run-in with Liu Ju after arresting one of the crown prince's assistants for improper use of an imperial road, and feared that Liu Ju would seek payback after ascending to the throne. Another conspirator was Emperor Wu's chief eunuch Su Wen (蘇文), who was in charge of managing Emperor Wu and Lady Zhao's living arrangements, and had previously tried to frame the Crown Prince by falsely accusing him of committing adultery with Emperor Wu's palace maids.\n\nThe first trial began in early 91 BC involving Prime Minister Gongsun Ao (Empress Wei's brother-in-law) and his son, leading to their unexplained suicide in jail and the execution of their clan. Liu Ju's sisters Princess Zhuyi and Princess Yangshi as well as cousin Wei Kang (衛伉, Wei Qing's eldest son) were also accused of involvement in witchcraft and executed, effectively removing almost all of his political allies in the Han court. With the sanctioned witch-hunts underway, Jiang Chong and Su Wen decided to strike while the iron was hot and move against Liu Ju, once again with the accusation of witchcraft. Because the physically deteriorating Emperor Wu was then staying at his summer palace in Ganquan (甘泉, in modern Xianyang, Shaanxi), he relied heavily on Jiang and Su for day-to-day information. Jiang, with the approval from Emperor Wu, searched through various palaces, planted voodoo dolls and pieces of cloth with mysterious writings in the house of the \"perpetrators\", then condemned the victims on the spot. Eventually he reached the palaces of Liu Ju and Empress Wei, engaged in so much digging that there were barely any space to lay a bed. He then announced that he found overwhelming evidence of crime particularly at the Crown Prince's household.\n\nLiu Ju was shocked by this and forced to consult his close advisers. His teacher Shi De (石德), invoking the infamous story of Zhao Gao's scheme to murder Ying Fusu and raising the possibility that Emperor Wu might already be deceased, suggested to Liu Ju to start an uprising to get rid of the villains. Liu Ju initially hesitated and wanted to speedily proceed to Ganquan Palace and explain himself to his father, but when he found out that Jiang Chong's messengers were already on their way to report the false accusations, he decided to accept Shi's suggestion. He sent an individual to impersonate a messenger from Emperor Wu, and arrested Jiang and his co-conspirators — except for Su Wen, who escaped. He then denounced and personally executed Jiang, and reported his actions to his mother. Empress Wei, faced with the dilemma between her husband and son, chose to support her son and authorized Liu Ju to rally her palace guards and recruit civilian militias in preparation to defend himself against retaliation by the conspirators.\n\nAt the same time, Su Wen ran to Ganquan Palace and told Emperor Wu that the Crown Prince was committing treason. Emperor Wu, not believing it and correctly (at this point) concluding that Liu Ju were merely angry at Jiang Chong, send a messenger back to Chang'an to summon his son for an explanation. This messenger, a low-ranking eunuch, did not dare to proceed to the capital city, but instead returned and falsely reported to Emperor Wu that Liu Ju was going to kill him. By now enraged and really believing his son was going to overthrow him, Emperor Wu ordered his nephew, Prime Minister Liu Qumao (劉屈犛), to lead the regular Han army and put down the rebellion. The two forces then battled in the streets of Chang'an for five days, but Liu Qumao's forces prevailed after it became clear that Prince Ju did not have his father's authorization. Liu Ju was forced to flee the capital with two of his sons, and the rest of his family were killed, except a months-old grandson, Liu Bingyi, who was thrown into prison.\n\nShortly after Liu Ju's escape, Emperor Wu sent two officials to Empress Wei's palace to seize her seal (i.e. suspending her rights in preparation to depose her). Wei Zifu committed suicide in response, and was buried with a small coffin in Tongbai (桐柏) on the east side of an avenue outside Fu'ang Gate (覆盎門, the eastmost south gate of Chang'an). Most of her clan members were wiped out in the turmoil. Crown Prince Liu Ju was later tracked down and cornered in Hu County (湖縣) by local officials eager for rewards, and committed suicide when it became obvious he could not escape. His two sons were also killed.\n\nNot long afterwards, Emperor Wu began to realize that the witchcraft cases during 91 BC were often false accusations. In 89 BC, when Tian Qianqiu (田千秋), then the superintendent of Emperor Gao's temple, filed a report claiming that \"a white-haired old man\" told him in a dream that for the offense of armed uprising, Liu Ju would at most be caned, not killed, as a punishment, Emperor Wu had a revelation about what really happened. Furious over the realization that the conspirators exploited his trust and plotted his son's death, he had Su Wen burned alive, Jiang Chong's immediate and extended family executed, and killed every official promoted for tracking down the Crown Prince. He also promoted Tian Qianqiu to prime minister, and made major policy change rectifying the ideals supported by his dead son. To express his regret over causing his son's death, Emperor Wu also built the Palace of Son-Grieving (思子宮) and Platform of Longing for Return (歸來望思台), officially rehabilitating Liu Ju's name. \n\n18 years after her death, her great-grandson Liu Bingyi ascended to the throne in 74 BC as Emperor Xuan. Emperor Xuan then had his great-grandmother's name officially cleared and rebuilt her tomb to a larger mausoleum cared by 1000 men, and gave her the posthumous title Wei Si Hou (衛思后, literally meaning \"Wei the Thoughtful Empress\"). Her new tomb, due to its remote location and relative humbleness, escaped the looting by tomb raiders later.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1833135", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1833135", "title": "Cariboo Road", "text": "Cariboo Road\n\nThe Cariboo Road (also called the Cariboo Wagon Road, the Great North Road or the Queen's Highway) was a project initiated in 1860 by the Governor of the Colony of British Columbia, James Douglas. It involved a feat of engineering stretching from Fort Yale to Barkerville in the Canadian province of British Columbia through extremely hazardous canyon territory in the interior of British Columbia.\n\nBetween the 1860s and the 1880s the Cariboo Road existed in three versions as a surveyed and constructed wagon-road route. The first Cariboo Wagon Road surveyed in 1861 and built in 1862 followed the original Hudson's Bay Company's Harrison Trail (Port Douglas) route from Lillooet to Clinton, 70 Mile House, 100 Mile House, Lac La Hache, 150 Mile House to the contract end around Soda Creek and Alexandria at the doorstep of the Cariboo Gold Fields. The second Cariboo Wagon Road (or Yale Cariboo Road) operated during the period of the fast stage-coaches and freight-wagon companies headquartered in Yale: 1865 to 1885. From the water landing at Yale, the road ran north via the spectacular Fraser Canyon route over Hell's Gate and Jackass Mountain, connecting to the earlier Cariboo Road at Clinton. The third Cariboo Road was the revised route following the completion of the Canadian Pacific Railway in 1885. The railway station at Ashcroft became the southern end of the wagon road. Much of the Fraser Canyon wagon road was destroyed by the railway construction as well as by washouts and by the Great Flood of 1894 (interest in rebuilding this portion of the road would not occur until the construction plans for the Fraser Canyon Highway for automobiles in the 1920s).\nThe road was a reaction to the high concentration of gold in the Cariboo region and the dangerous \"mule trail\", which was a rough-hewn cliff-side trail - wide enough only for one mule - that ran along the approximate route of the Cariboo Road. In order to lower supply-costs to the settlers in the Cariboo region, Douglas ordered the construction of a more viable and safe form of transportation to the gold-mining settlements. The colonial government employed locals as well as a detachment of the Royal Engineers (\"sappers\") who undertook amazing engineering feats, including the construction of toll bridges including the (original) Alexandra Suspension Bridge of 1863.\n\nBuilding the road cost nearly one and a quarter million dollars, and left a standing debt of £112,780 after its completion, one of many infrastructure costs in servicing the Gold Colony that forced its amalgamation first with Vancouver Island (1866), and then with Canada (1871 confederation). The Cariboo Road saw the transportation of over six and a half million dollars' worth of gold. Originally Douglas wanted to stretch the road across the continental divide into Rupert's Land (modern day Alberta) but this plan was abandoned when Douglas retired in 1864.\n\nThe name Cariboo Road or Cariboo Trail is also informally applied to a toll road built by contractor Gustavus Blin-Wright in 1861–1862 from Lillooet to Williams Lake, Van Winkle and on to Williams Creek (Richfield, Barkerville). This route was known also as the Old Cariboo Road, when the Lakes Route from Port Douglas to Lillooet had not yet been superseded by the Fraser Canyon route of the Cariboo Wagon Road proper. The mile-house names (e.g. 100 Mile House), in the Cariboo are derived from measurements taken from the Mile '0' of this road, which is in the bend in the Main Street of Lillooet and commemorated there by a cairn erected in the 1958 Centennial Year. It was along this route that an attempt was made to use Bactrian camels purchased from the U.S. Camel Corps for freight (1862), and also a tractor-style Thomson Road Steamer known as a \"road train\", one of the earliest motorized vehicles.\n\nMost foot traffic from Lillooet to the Cariboo however, went by the \"River Trail\", far below the wagon road, which departed the Fraser Canyon at Pavilion for the steep climb over Pavilion Mountain to Clinton, where it merged with the newer Cariboo Road via Yale and Ashcroft (once the latter route was completed, that is). The River Trail continued along the Fraser Canyon as far as Big Bar and various routes spread towards Quesnel and Barkerville from there.\n\nThe Cariboo Road was featured on the television historical series Gold Trails and Ghost Towns, season 2, episode 4.\n\n"}

Historically it was believed to be part of the vitamin B complex and was called vitamin B, but it is now known that it is not a vitamin.\n\nThe compound is manufactured in the body via a mitochondrial enzyme, dihydroorotate dehydrogenase or a cytoplasmic enzyme of pyrimidine synthesis pathway. It is sometimes used as a mineral carrier in some dietary supplements (to increase their bioavailability), most commonly for lithium orotate.\n\nDihydroorotate is synthesized to orotic acid by the enzyme dihydroorotate dehydrogenase, where it later combines with phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate (PRPP) to form orotidine-5'-monophosphate (OMP). A distinguishing characteristic of pyrimidine synthesis is that the pyrimidine ring is fully synthesized before being attached to the ribose sugar, whereas purine synthesis happens by building the base directly on the sugar.\n\nA buildup of orotic acid can lead to orotic aciduria and acidemia. It may be a symptom of an increased ammonia load due to a metabolic disorder, such as a urea cycle disorder. \nIn ornithine transcarbamoylase deficiency, an X-linked inherited and the most common urea cycle disorder, excess carbamoyl phosphate is converted into orotic acid. This leads to an increased serum ammonia level, increased serum and urinary orotic acid levels and a decreased serum blood urea nitrogen level. This also leads to an increased urinary orotic acid excretion, because the orotic acid is not being properly utilized and must be eliminated. The hyperammonemia depletes alpha-ketoglutarate leading to the inhibition of the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) decreasing adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production.\n\nOrotic aciduria is a cause of megaloblastic anaemia.\n\n"}

{"id": "1833190", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1833190", "title": "Ford LTD II", "text": "Ford LTD II\n\nThe Ford LTD II is an automobile that was marketed and produced by Ford Motor Company between 1977 and 1979 in the United States and Canada. Deriving its name from the full-size Ford LTD model line, the intermediate LTD II consolidated the Ford Torino and Gran Torino model lines, with the Ford Elite replaced by the Ford Thunderbird. Offered in a two-door sedan, four-door sedan, and station wagon, the LTD II also served as a basis for the final generation of the Ford Ranchero coupe utility. \n\nDuring its production, the Lincoln-Mercury Division sold the LTD II under the Mercury Cougar badge, replacing the Mercury Montego. \n\nThe design of the Ford LTD II is notable as one of the largest vehicles ever produced as an intermediate, released just as the entire American auto industry began a period of downsizing. In terms of exterior footprint compared to full-size sedans, the LTD II is longer in length and wheelbase and wider than the later Ford LTD Crown Victoria, Ford Crown Victoria, Ford Five Hundred, and the Ford Taurus (fifth, sixth, and seventh-generation versions)\n\nFor the 1977 model year, Ford Motor Company made substantial revisions to its intermediate segment product lines involving both the Ford and Mercury brands. As part of the model changes, several product lines were given mid-cycle updates. To further revive interest, other model lines were consolidated to reduce internal competition and overlap. \n\nCentral to the model revision was the discontinuation of the Ford Torino, Gran Torino, and Ford Elite. While the Torino chassis and body was given an extensive update to extend its lifespan, the Torino/Gran Torino became the Ford LTD II (\"II\" to distinguish the intermediate model line from the full-size LTD). Alongside a massive exterior update, the Ford Elite became the Ford Thunderbird, allowing Ford to better compete against the Chevrolet Monte Carlo (and its various General Motors counterparts) and the Chrysler Cordoba, reducing potential overlap between the Thunderbird and the Continental Mark V. \n\nAs Ford discontinued the Torino, Mercury replaced the Montego, as it expanded the Mercury Cougar nameplate to its entire intermediate line (with the previous Cougar becoming the highest-trim Cougar XR7 counterpart of the Thunderbird).\n\nThe LTD II utilizes the body on frame construction shared with the 1972-1976 Torino/Montego. As with the LTD, the LTD II utilized a full perimeter frame; to isolate road shock from the body, the frame was fitted with fourteen rubber body mounts and five cross members. On the rear suspension, the four-link solid rear axle utilized coil springs.\n\nThe LTD II derived much of its powertrain line from the 1974 Torino, with one exception: in the interest of fuel economy, the 460 V8 was dropped from all Ford and Mercury intermediates, with the 302 V8 making its return as the standard engine (outside of California). As options, Ford offered the 351M V8 and the 351 Windsor V8, with a 400 cubic-inch V8 serving as the largest engine offering. For 1979, the 400 V8 was discontinued. \nAlthough the transition from the Torino to the LTD II is theoretically a mid-cycle update, Ford stylists would make several styling changes to introduce the new model line, moving away from the Coke-bottle styling that dominated the exterior of its Torino/Montego predecessor. \n\nThough limited funds precluded a complete redesign of the exterior, the roofline and all sheetmetal from the doors rearward were given an extensive update. Adopting much of the design language of the redesigned Thunderbird, the roofline was given larger, straight-edged windows (including optional opera windows) and a level beltline while the body retained relatively large fender flares. \n\nThe LTD II carried over the use of the Elite's hood and front fenders with a restyled front end panel adapting vertically stacked rectangular headlamps and a new grille. The rear end adopted styling elements of the full-size Ford LTD. Due to the cost of redesigning the rear quarter side panels, the LTD II station wagon was produced with a Mercury Montego wagon bodyshell; the station wagon was discontinued after 1977. \n\nThe LTD II was produced in three trim levels, base-trim \"S\", standard-trim, and the luxury-minded LTD II Brougham. Bucket seats with console and floor shifter were available on base- and Brougham-level coupes.\n\nAlthough initially popular, sales of the LTD II declined rapidly due to several factors. As the LTD II made its 1977 debut, Chevrolet introduced downsized versions of the Chevrolet Impala and Caprice; although the LTD II was marketed as a competitor against the Chevrolet Malibu, the intermediate LTD II presented with a larger exterior footprint than the Impala (though with a smaller interior). The downsizing of the General Motors full-size line was met with success, with the Impala/Caprice becoming the best-selling 1977 model line. Also, internal competition from its nearly identical platform mate the newly downsized Thunderbird (with its much lower base price) deflected sales from the LTD II two-door models. \n\nFor 1978, the LTD II met a much larger degree of competition, as Ford introduced the Ford Fairmont as the replacement for the long-running Ford Maverick. Though officially considered a compact (nearly two feet shorter and seven inches narrower than the LTD II), the interior dimensions of the Fairmont entered close enough into the midsize segment as downsizing extended beyond full-size vehicles. Along with its slow sales, the potential for model overlap with the Fairmont led to the discontinuation of the LTD II station wagon. \n\nFor 1979, the LTD II effectively became obsolete as Ford introduced the downsized Ford LTD. In comparison to the LTD II, the downsized LTD was 11 inches shorter in length and 4 inches shorter in wheelbase, an inch narrower, and 500 pounds lighter; despite the smaller exterior footprint, the LTD rivaled its full-size predecessor in interior space. \n\nAs the Thunderbird and Mercury Cougar were downsized to the Ford Fox platform for 1980, the Ford Torino chassis was discontinued after 1979. After 1979, the Ford Ranchero was indirectly replaced by the Ford Ranger, as the coupe utility pickup segment was phased out in favor of compact pickup trucks in the United States. After its 1979 discontinuation, the Ford LTD II never saw a direct successor in the Ford product line. In 1983, the Ford LTD model name returned to the mid-size segment, with Ford renaming the Granada as part of a mid-cycle redesign. After 1986, this vehicle was replaced by the Ford Taurus, largely marking the end of Ford LTD nameplate in North America.\n\nFord manufactured the LTD II in Venezuela badged as the Fairlane and Fairlane 500. All three body styles were available.\n\n"}

In 1762, Henry Somerset, 5th Duke of Beaufort, decided to focus on foxhunting after an unsuccessful day hunting deer. From that point on, the Dukes of Beaufort have participated in the hunt, often acting as Master of the hunt. Henry Somerset, 10th Duke of Beaufort held the position for 60 years, gaining a reputation as \"the greatest fox-hunter of the twentieth century\", and was eventually known simply by the nickname, 'Master'.\n\nThe hunt country covers a area of land between Cirencester and Bath to the north and south and between Malmesbury and Nailsworth to the east and west, although only of land was usable by 2013. The hunt goes out on four days of the week during the hunting season, which continues for about 125 days of the year.\n\nAlthough \"hunting wild mammals with a dog\" in its traditional form was made unlawful in England and Wales by the Hunting Act 2004, which came into effect in 2005, the Beaufort Hunt continues to hunt, taking advantage of exemptions stated in Schedule 1 of the Act, which allow some previously unusual forms of hunting wild mammals with dogs to continue, such as \"hunting... for the purpose of enabling a bird of prey to hunt the wild mammal\". Trail hunting and mounted exercising of hounds are both unaffected by the Act and consequently are favoured by many hunts in Great Britain. In 2005 the Beaufort changed its rules to ensure that it would hunt within the new law.\n"}

Their fate remained unknown for seven and a half years.\n\nOn 23 June 1968, salvage vessel \"Altay\" discovered the wreck of a submarine at 70°01′23″N 36°35′22″E, at a depth of . The crew inspected the wreck with its bathyscape and identified it as \"S-80\".\n\nA government commission studied the report and ordered Operation \"Depth,\" the salvage of the wreck. The Nikolayevsk Shipyard built \"Karpaty\", a special salvage vessel equipped to raise the sunken submarine.\n\nOperation \"Depth\" was carried out by a task force of the Northern Fleet consisting of groups of trawlers and a destroyer under the command of Captain First Rank S. Minchenko. The wreck was lifted from the ocean floor on 9 June 1969 and transported to Mys Teriberskiy, suspended under \"Karpaty\" in slings. There, it was lowered to the bottom of Zavalishin Harbor at a depth of on 12 July.\n\nOn 24 July 1969, \"S-80\" was raised to the surface. During August, a government commission began studying the wreck under the management of Hero of the Soviet Union Vice Admiral Grigory Shchedrin. The commission determined not only the immediate causes of the boat's loss, but also that two further errors had compounded the accident: the crew never attempted to shift propulsion to the electric motors, and they never performed an emergency ballast tank blow.\n\n"}
{"id": "1833226", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1833226", "title": "Mystical Ninja Starring Goemon", "text": "Mystical Ninja Starring Goemon\n\nMystical Ninja Starring Goemon is a platform action-adventure video game released by Konami for the Nintendo 64 on August 7, 1997 in Japan and April 16, 1998 in North America as the fifth entry in the \"Ganbare Goemon\" series. The second \"Goemon\" game released in North America, it follows \"The Legend of the Mystical Ninja\" and features hybrid elements of platform games and action-adventure games.\n\nThe story follows Goemon's struggles to prevent the Peach Mountain Shoguns gang from turning Japan into a Westernized fine arts theater. The plot calls for three cinematic musical features and battles between giant robots; like other \"Ganbare Goemon\" games, it is peppered with surrealist humor and anachronisms.\n\n\"Mystical Ninja Starring Goemon\" sold nearly 200,000 copies worldwide. Reviewers praised its graphics, gameplay, and humorous plot.\n\nPlayers navigate Goemon through forests, fields, dungeons, and other three-dimensional models of feudal Japanese places. Goemon and his friends can walk or run, jump, attack, and use special abilities to cross terrain, pick up money, and defeat adversaries. Players control only one of four characters at a time but can cycle through them with the press of a button. Hearts at the bottom of the screen show a character's health. If hit by an enemy and damage is taken, a character loses a heart. Some items and acts replenish strength, and a Maneki-neko (Luck Cat) adds a heart to the overall health. If all hearts are lost, the player restarts at the entrance to the field map they died in and the player's number of lives declines by one. If the player loses all lives, the game restarts at the last point saved or at the beginning of the game if a Controller Pak is not used.\nTraveling through Japan, players visit towns and coffeehouses safe from enemies, where they can eat in restaurants or sleep in inns to refill strength and buy armor or riceballs—a self-acting item that refills health by itself. Many interactive non-player characters populate cities and talk with other characters to uncover plot devices or idle gossip. Players save their progress in towns with a Controller Pak at the inns or at the entrance to some dungeons. Some places are impassable barring the use of special abilities unlocked by completing minigames. For example, Ebisumaru must hide in a giant's cupboard to learn self-shrinking magic, an art that allows passing through small holes. The player has two wayfaring tools: a status screen shows found items, weapons, and player characters and a map screen shows where they are in Japan. In dungeons, the map screen shows the building's floorplan if they have the item \"Mr. Elly Fant\". At the end of each dungeon is a boss, a more difficult than normal enemy with hearts of its own.\n\nBeating a boss can trigger a cutscene, after which Goemon appears outside the dungeon or helms his giant robot friend Impact to thwart an enemy robot (although not mentioned in the manual, these segments of gameplay support the Rumble Pak accessory). These sequences begin with a music video and a high-speed minigame in which Impact must smash structures and avoid hazards while racing across the countryside. The points gained by destroying buildings determine how many health points (measured in oil) Impact will have in the coming battle. Players control Impact from a cockpit behind his eyes where gauges show enemy and player health and ammunition. Impact can punch, kick, defend, reel in opponents with the chain pipe, and use projectile weaponry, including nasal bullets and a laser. Once a boss is defeated, a cutscene of the enemy exploding shows, and the game returns to normal exploration-based play. At the very end is the last boss whose defeat unlocks the ending. Collecting all the fortune cats and beating the game enables an Impact tournament mode with a special image of the robots as the prize for winning.\n\nThe protagonist of \"Mystical Ninja\" is Goemon, a hot-blooded, kiseru-wielding ninja with blue, bushy hair based loosely on the legendary thief Ishikawa Goemon. The lord of Oedo asks him to find those who maimed Oedo Castle. Goemon lives in Oedo Town and is friends with Ebisumaru, a strange, gluttonous fat man who wears a blue bandana. Ebisumaru is defined as lazy and perverted. Their kunai-throwing friend Sasuke is a mechanical ninja (made by the Wise Man of Iga) who enjoys hot baths and Japanese tea. Rounding out the heroes is Yae, a fierce sword-wielding kunoichi, who happens upon Goemon's band in Zazen Town. The villains of the game hail from the organization \"Peach Mountain Shoguns\" and include a gang of four \"weirdos\" led by Spring Breeze Dancin' (Danshin Harukaze) and Kitty Lily (Margaret Ranko). They intend to transform Japan into a stage for their talents.\n\nWhile shopping in Oedo Town, Goemon and Ebisumaru feel the ground quake as a peach-shaped flying object sails overhead. The vessel fires a laser at Oedo Castle, turning it into a European-style castle with spires and flags. Worried for the safety of the Lord of Oedo and his daughter, Goemon and Ebisumaru retrieve a chain pipe from Mt. Fuji and assault the castle. Inside is Baron, a member of the fashion-loving Gang of Four who reveals he was sent to turn the castle into a stage. Goemon shrugs him off and defeats the King Robot Congo to free the Lord and find a \"miracle item\". The Lord asks Goemon to catch them and gives a Super Pass for access to the roads of Japan.\n\nGoemon sets out to the Wise Man's house for assistance, but the house explodes as he approaches. A fuming Baron comes forth and mans his kabuki robot. Goemon finds a Triton shell in the rubble that can call Impact, who lays ruin to the kabuki robot. In Zazen Town, Goemon finds Yae, who claims the troublemakers responsible are Flake Gang members named the \"Peach Mountain Shoguns.\" Yae joins Goemon, and they learn that children with dancing talent have been kidnapped around the region. Goemon and his friends must also fight against Benkei, a gatekeeper blocking the Gojo Ohashi Bridge leading out of Zazen Town. In order to defeat him, Goemon needs help from a young fisherman named Ushiwaka. It is hinted that Benkei and Ushiwaka are kind of rivals. Ashamed at his loss against Goemon and his friends, the man offers Goemon the mechanical robot Sasuke, thrown there by the explosion of the Wise Man's house. Goemon accepts the unconscious, powerless Sasuke and walks to Kii-Awaji island, where the dragon-powered passenger ferry has been stopped by the dragon's sudden craze. Goemon teleports to the dragon and finds a Gang of Four member named Colon who used the dragon to kidnap children; he then breaks Colon's mind-control device. The dragon turns back to human and crashes near a shrine.\n\nThe human calls himself Koryuta, son of the Dragon God, and apologizes for the kidnappings. He pledges help in transporting the heroes across Japan, and claims the kids are at the Dogo Hot Springs. Goemon travels to Iyo but finds the Hot Springs closed; the only entrance is a mouse hole. He learns from travelers that sweets in the Zazen Town shrine can make a person smaller. Ebisumaru offers to steal the sweets. With the dwarf power the group infiltrate the Ghost Toys Castle, a dark house of traps, toys, and a giant pool table. Colon faces Goemon with the robot Dharmanyo, but is crushed and lets go his miracle item. The hidden man aboard the peach ship at Oedo comes out calling himself \"Spring Breeze Dancin<nowiki>'</nowiki>\". He pokes fun at the group with nicknames and instructs Colon to retreat. With the children liberated, Goemon follows Colon to the Chu-goku Region, where he revives Sasuke with two batteries. They enter the Festival Temple, a Peach Mountain base.\n\nThey destroy a guard robot, prompting Gang of Four member Sharon to appear with Kitty Lily, the second leader of the Peach Mountain Shoguns. Lily boasts that Kyushu is a stage and asks Sharon to return to base after buying some foundation. Alarmed, Goemon and friends rush off to the bridge to Kyushu and find Omitsu on her way to deliver dumplings. Stunned by Omitsu's seeming ruggedness, Goemon forgets to warn her of danger, and the island rises into odd thunder clouds in the sky. A fortune teller instructs the group to set out north to Mount Fear to find a way to Kyushu. After necessary weight training to remove obstacles, Goemon finds the northeast Festival Village and learns of a psychic witch. The witch summons Wise Man, who tells Goemon to gather the fourth miracle items at the Stone Circle near Festival Village for passage into outer space and Kyushu. Goemon investigates reports of stolen food in the village while Yae undergoes training to become a mermaid. The two paths converge when Yae finds the Gourmet Submarine, a \"Peach Mountain\" vessel containing hordes of food. After sidestepping grills and swimming through gallons of soup, Goemon confronts Poron, the final weirdo, who jokes that he lost the last miracle item in Zazen Town.\n\nLily enters by hologram to ridicule the party, but is rudely interrupted by Dancin', who continues to call Goemon \"Fernandez\". Dancin' instructs Poron to activate the ship's self-destruct sequence. Goemon escapes by calling Impact and defeats a mermaid giant robot. In Zazen Town, a kappa named Kihachi desires to trade the miracle item for cucumber made by the priest's son. The son sits on a precipice inaccessible save through jumping training; Sasuke volunteers in the Chu-goku Region and acquires the miracle item. At the Stone Circle, the Pemopemo God awakens and asks the heroes if they have the courage to venture to outer space. Goemon affirms their decision and the group enters Kyushu through the Gorgeous Music Castle. They discover Sogen Town has been converted to a garden city with European architecture. Goemon locates Omitsu and learns that Dancin' and Lily can be found past a rigid gate—accessible only with the help of Wise Man.\n\nStunned to find him alive, Goemon learns that in exchange for building the Instant Stage Beam and mechanical robots, the Peach Mountain Shoguns gave Wise Man five car magazines and a muscle car poster. Enraged to learn of his home's demise, Wise Man helps Goemon enter the castle. Kitty Lily and Dancin' confront the heroes with the elaborate musical number \"Gorgeous My Stage\" before a self-destruct sequence begins. Goemon summons Impact to fly into outer space, where he thwarts the giant peach ship Balberra and duels Lily and Dancin' in their personal battle robot. Dancin' mocks Goemon in defeat, and Impact sends their robot's head far into outer space to reveal a picture of Dancin' and Lily smiling among the stars. Goemon returns to Japan to find a horde of girls rushing towards him, and awaits their praise for saving Japan. The group is shocked to find the girls angry over the apparent death of their idol, Spring Breeze Dancin'.\n\nThe story of \"Mystical Ninja Starring Goemon\", a quest to thwart dancers in a peach-shaped spaceship from using laser weaponry to convert Japan to a giant stage and its citizens to loyal dancers, is steeped in surrealist and Japanese humor. Many reviewers and writers commented on the humor in the plot and dialogue. The game's dialogue is peppered with offbeat humor, and a few instances of sexual innuendo. In the Japanese version, Wise Man collected hentai magazines and pornographic posters rather than automotive publications. A laugh track punctuates certain jokes.\n\n\"Mystical Ninja Starring Goemon\" was developed by Konami Computer Entertainment Osaka. It was first titled \"Ganbare Goemon 5\", then \"Legend of the Mystical Ninja\". The Japanese producers wished to break the series' numerical naming pattern to stress that \"Mystical Ninja\" differed from its forefathers. Originally made with a two-player mode, this feature was scrapped months before the Japanese release. Early development pictures showed Impact battling in a modern city against a handgun-wielding foe. Later images touted the battle against the Wartime Kabuki Robot Kashiwagi taking place over a forest and village. Konami released many renders of Goemon posing and making faces for magazine previews. A 60–70% complete build of the game was featured at E3 in June 1997, suffering from graphical clipping and camera issues. Konami later presented a mostly finished build at the Tokyo Game Show in September 1997. Developers aimed to make the game \"very visual\" with new content, and the game's marketers echoed this by using large, colorful advertisements. Konami targeted children, among whom the series is popular in Japan, by scheduling appearances of a Goemon mascot at some elementary school gymnastics sessions. The game's later success prompted the production of an animated television show. The series followed Goemon as he struggled against evil after being transported to modern society, where he befriended an elementary school student. Its release in the United States was planned for winter 1997, then February 1998, but was ultimately delayed to two more months.\n\n\"Mystical Ninja\" featured a cartridge size of 128 megabits, designed to be much larger than most of its peers and predecessor games to allow high quality musical numbers and voice samples. In total, there are three musical numbers—\"Theme of Ganbare Goemon\", \"I Am Impact\", and \"Gorgeous My Stage\". They feature the talents of Hironobu Kageyama, Ichirou Mizuki, and Toshihiro Tachibana and Etsuyo Ota respectively. The song's main soundtrack is composed of a mix of traditional Japanese and modern instruments integrated in original arrangements. The dungeons feature minimalistic songs which grow in complexity and length as the player proceeds deeper into the lair. The soundtrack on whole is a collaborative effort by four composers. The musical numbers, with forty tunes from the game and one remix of \"I Am Impact\", were released October 3, 1997 on CD. The soundtrack was later extracted from Read-only memory and presented in Nintendo Ultra 64 Sound Format on May 9, 2005; it is one of the most downloaded releases at USF Central.\n\n\"Mystical Ninja Starring Goemon\" sold 55,000 units in America and 141,000 units in Japan. American reviewers praised the game's story and setting for its quirky, unique flavor; \"Nintendo Power\" called \"Mystical Ninja Starring Goemon\" a \"blend of history, fantasy, and science fiction,\" writing that the game \"never failed to enchant or intrigue.\" Dialogue was considered likably memorable, whether relying on clever puns or surrealist humor. The Japanese songs in \"Mystical Ninja\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s title and Impact sequences, unusual to Western audiences, augmented the bizarre humor. One Japanese reviewer claimed the Impact song cultivated a heroic atmosphere for ensuing battles. Gameplay was similar to that of \"Super Mario 64\" and \"The Legend of Zelda\" series, offering responsive play control and ability-driven progression. \"Mystical Ninja\" featured a simple controller setup and easy learning curve to this end. The minigames, Impact sequences, and secret tournament mode bolstered replay value, and reviewers praised the game's graphical finesse in animating characters creating the Japanese countryside in three dimensions. A reviewer for The News Tribune considered the presentation \"a terrific upgrade from the Super Nintendo version\". However, the game was found to be prone to slowdowns in detail-heavy areas, and one reviewer decried the inability to pause the game during Impact battles. Another found play control \"not as fluid as it is in \"Super Mario 64\"\".\n\nCritics enjoyed the soundtrack's integration of pop and shamisen-laden traditional Japanese music. A writer for IGN declared that the songs would \"permanently burn themselves into your brain...something that can't be said for most N64 titles\"—echoed by Japanese reviewers who noted that the music would not grow tiresome. \"Mystical Ninja\" was also commended for high-quality voice samples and sound effects. Reviewers were divided concerning the efficiency of the camera system—most considered it inferior to \"Super Mario 64\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s, citing instances of clipping issues and resulting in \"extremely difficult\" platform jumping sequences. The game features a few sequences of long travel between towns, regarded as dull and unenjoyable. Reviewers disapproved of the game's short play time, estimating that \"Mystical Ninja\" could be completed in only ten to fifteen hours. The objections came in spite of the developers anticipating the problem and trying to mitigate it by requiring players to return to certain locations. \"Mystical Ninja Starring Goemon\" requires a Controller Pak to save—a rarity in early Nintendo 64 titles which garnered negative attention from both American and Japanese critics. One reviewer decried not being able to save his progress inside castles, which become \"harder and more complex\" with time. Reviewers fluent with past \"Ganbare Goemon\" games argued that the absence of the series' usually intuitive minigames and a two-player mode hampered \"Mystical Ninja\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s replay value, and a Japanese reviewer felt that the transition to three dimensions had deprived the game of the traditional Goemon feel.\n\n\"Mystical Ninja\"'s localization was criticized often. The plot and poorly-translated jokes tended to confuse players. A critic for The Tampa Tribune wrote, \"upon popping in the...cartridge and listening to the opening theme song, you'll realize something about this game. It's Japanese.\" He added, \"attempts at humor often come across as rather inane. Early conversations with village residents only add to the confusion.\" Others countered that the strange localization often compounded the surrealist humor through the use of weird, unusual English and grammar. One critic stressed, \"talk to everyone you meet... Everybody has something interesting to say.\" A writer from GameSpot remarked that the game was translated surprisingly well given the sheer number of Japanese jokes and amount of innuendo. \"Next Generation\" lamented that Konami had not polished it more, holding that it otherwise might have been the \"best N64 action/RPG\". IGN's reviewer cautioned that though \"Mystical Ninja\" was billed as a role-playing game, it would differ from the expectations of Western fans. Critics noted that it would hold over gamers until the release of \"\"—provided they played it with an open mind to avoid culture shock. A contributor for The Dallas Morning News concluded that the game \"will please N64 owners starving for a decent adventure game... But players should rent it before they buy.\" A reviewer for the Sentinel & Enterprise wrote in 2001 that while considered a \"flawed 3D platformer\", \"Mystical Ninja\" offered \"quirky\" fun \"following the heels of \"Super Mario 64\"\" by inviting players to \"scale mountains, invade pagodas, and pilot giant robots in all-out fisticuffs to the rhythm of Japanese lyrics and pop tunes.\" The game is rated 73.8% at GameRankings and received an 8.4 out of 10 rating by players at GameSpot.\n\n\"Mystical Ninja Starring Goemon\" was followed by a Game Boy game of the same name. Featuring gameplay similar to the Super Famicom title \"\", the game presented a story in which Yae had been kidnapped by the Black Ship Gang. In 1999, Konami released \"Goemon's Great Adventure\" on the Nintendo 64—a 2.5D side-scroller with multiplayer support. Reviewers gave it high marks for recreating the feel of the older, 16-bit \"Goemon\" games and considered it the best side-scroller for the Nintendo 64. The final \"Goemon\" title for the Nintendo 64 was \"Goemon Mononoke Sugoroku\", released in Japan on December 25, 1999. In \"Mononoke Sugoroku\", players must collect Ofuda cards while navigating a board game. After a spate of sequels on the PlayStation line of consoles, Konami returned to the medieval, quirky Japanese themes of \"Mystical Ninja\" and its brethren on June 23, 2005 with \"\" for the Nintendo DS.\n\n"}

From 1901 to 1902 he worked with Theodor Escherich (1857–1911) in Vienna, the discoverer of the Escherichia coli bacterium. He was habilitated for pediatrics in Munich in 1906, and became a professor of pediatrics in the University of Heidelberg in 1911.\n\nBesides the Moro reflex he became also known for the following:\n\n\nIn 1936, after the Nazis came to power, Moro resigned from his chair at the University of Heidelberg, alleging reasons of health. However the real motive was that he was married to Grete Moro, née Königsvald, of Jewish origin. He started a private clinic at Mozartstrasse 10 (where a commemorative plaque is now affixed) and retired in 1948.\n\nIn 1908, diarrhea killed many babies in Germany. Professor Moro, at that time the head of a children hospital in Heidelberg, found out by experiment that a simple carrot soup decreased the death rate of babies suffering from diarrhea by nearly 50% . The soup was made by pureeing 500 grams of peeled carrots in a blender, adding 1 liter of water, and then cooking it for one hour. After cooking, 3 grams of salt were added, along with enough water until the soup pot contained a total of 1 liter of liquid.\n\nA German study published in 2002 outlines that acidic oligosaccharides formed in aqueous extracts from carrots (carrot soup) may lead to less adherence of bacterial agents to the mucosal wall of the bowel, thus being a more effective treatment for acute gastrointestinal infections of children than glucose-electrolyte-solution oral rehydration.\n\nIn 2009, experiments showed that Professor Moro's Carrot Soup can treat diarrhea caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria.\n\nIn 1929, Moro announced his later famous \"apple diet\" for the treatment of diarrheal conditions. The colleague August Heisler had pointed out to Moro the effect of apple days as an old folk remedy for intestinal catarrh. When the entire Eugenien Hall was infected with a small house infection of enteritis, all the children ate raw apple porridge. The further clinical trial confirmed the trial. In Moro's opinion, the tannin content of raw grated apples caused certain detoxification processes to alleviate the symptoms of dyspepsia, dysentery and agitation-like illnesses\n\nMoro was married to Margareta Hönigswald. His son, Peter Moro, was a noted London architect.\n\n"}

He pioneered the use of radios, airplanes, and electricity in the Arctic, brought back films and thousands of photographs of Arctic scenes, and put together a dictionary of the Inuktitut language.\n\nBorn in Provincetown, Massachusetts in 1874, MacMillan lived in Freeport, Maine after the deaths of both his parents in 1883 (his father died while captaining a Grand Banks fishing schooner) and 1886 (his mother died suddenly), and was educated at Bowdoin College in Brunswick, graduating in 1898 with a degree in geology. He later taught at Worcester Academy from 1903 to 1908.\n\nOn March 18, 1935, MacMillan married Miriam Norton Look, the daughter of his long-time friends Jerome and Amy Look. Though MacMillan at first refused to let her accompany him north, Miriam soon convinced him of her willingness and ability to participate in his Arctic travels. She participated in several of his scientific and exploration trips to the Arctic and elsewhere.\n\nAfter five years as a high school teacher, MacMillan caught the attention of explorer and fellow Bowdoin graduate Robert E. Peary when he saved the lives of nine shipwrecked people in two nights. Peary subsequently invited MacMillan to join his 1908 journey to the North Pole. Although MacMillan himself had to turn back at 84°29' on March 14 because of frozen heels, Peary allegedly reached the Pole 26 days later.\n\nMacMillan spent the next few years traveling in Labrador, carrying out ethnological studies among the Innu and Inuit. He organized and commanded the ill-fated Crocker Land Expedition to northern Greenland in 1913. Unfortunately Crocker Land turned out to be a mirage. The expedition members were stranded until 1917, when Captain Robert A. Bartlett of the ship \"Neptune\" finally rescued them. Journals from the expedition by Maurice C. Tanquary, Walter E. Ekblaw, Donald B. and Miriam MacMillan are available online at the George J. Mitchell Department of Special Collections & Archives website. Digitization of materials at Bowdoin College related to the Crocker Land Expedition was generously funded by the Gladys Krieble Delmas Foundation in 2016.\n\nOn December 24, 1918, shortly after the armistice which ended the First World War, MacMillan was commissioned an ensign in the Naval Reserve Flying Corps. MacMillan was 44 years old at the time, making him one of the oldest ensigns in the history of the U.S. Navy. After the war, MacMillan began raising money for another Arctic expedition. In 1921, the schooner \"Bowdoin\"—the namesake of MacMillan's alma mater—was launched from East Boothbay, Maine and set sail for Baffin Island, where MacMillan and his crew spent the winter. The expedition was notable for taking along an amateur radio operator, Don Mix, who used station WNP (\"Wireless North Pole\") to keep them in contact with the outside world.\n\nIn 1923 there was concern about a new ice age and he again sailed toward the North Pole aboard the \"Bowdoin\", sponsored by the National Geographical Society to look for evidence of advancing glaciers. \n\nIn 1925 MacMillan led a scientific expedition backed by the National Geographical Society and financed primarily by the Chicago entrepreneur Eugene McDonald - which was accompanied by U.S. Navy personnel and planes commanded by Lt. Cmdr. Richard E. Byrd. The planes were to be used for aerial surveys of Baffin and Ellesmere Islands, investigation of the Greenland icecap, and reconnaissance of previously unexplored areas of the Arctic Sea. The aerial results proved to be disappointing due to severe weather conditions, unreliable engines and inadequate navigational tools (although Byrd would use this experience in preparing for his attempt to reach the North Pole the following year). The expedition is noted for the successful demonstration of SW radio in communications from the Arctic Region.\n\nIn September 1926 MacMillan led a group of explorers which included three women and five scientists to Sydney, Nova Scotia. The team spent several months beforehand collecting flora and fauna in Labrador and Greenland. He believed it was possible that the ancient ruins off Sculpin Island, twenty miles from Nain, Labrador, are the remains of a Norse settlement 1,000 years old. On the side bordering the mainland MacMillan found what he considered the vestiges of ten or twelve houses. He estimated the age of the dwellings to be hundreds of years old according to the lichens which partially covered their foundations. However MacMillan could not say for certain if these had been built by Vikings. According to Inuit tradition the \"stone igloos\" were constructed by men who came from the sea in ships. Inuit called the site \"Tunitvik\", meaning \"the place of the Norseman\". MacMillan said the strongest argument that the Sculpin dwellings were of Viking origin was their resemblance to those he found in Greenland the previous year.\n\nMacMillan was placed on the Naval Reserve Honorary Retired List with the rank of lieutenant commander on his 64th birthday in 1938. Despite being past retirement age, he volunteered for active duty with the Navy during World War II. On May 22, 1941, he transferred the \"Bowdoin\" to the Navy for the duration of the war and served as her initial commanding officer before being transferred to the Hydrographic Office in Washington, DC. He was promoted to the rank of commander on June 13, 1942.\n\nAfter the war, MacMillan continued his trips to the Arctic, taking researchers north and carrying supplies for the MacMillan-Moravian School he established in 1929. On June 25, 1954 MacMillan was promoted, by a special act of Congress, to rank of rear admiral on the Naval Reserve retired list in honor of his lifetime of service and achievement.\n\nAdmiral MacMillan made his final trip to the Arctic in 1957 at age 82, and died in 1970 at the age of 95. He is buried in Provincetown, Massachusetts, where a main wharf is named after him.\n\nIn 1927, the Boy Scouts of America made MacMillan an \"Honorary Scout\", a new category of Scout created that same year. This distinction was given to \"American citizens whose achievements in outdoor activity, exploration and worthwhile adventure are of such an exceptional character as to capture the imagination of boys...\". The other eighteen who were awarded this distinction were: Roy Chapman Andrews; Robert Bartlett; Frederick Russell Burnham; Richard E. Byrd; George Kruck Cherrie; James L. Clark; Merian C. Cooper; Lincoln Ellsworth; Louis Agassiz Fuertes; George Bird Grinnell; Charles A. Lindbergh; Clifford H. Pope; George Palmer Putnam; Kermit Roosevelt; Carl Rungius; Stewart Edward White; and Orville Wright.\n\nMacMillan Pier in Provincetown, Massachusetts is named in his honor.\n\nThe bagpipe band at Robert E. Peary High School in Rockville, Maryland was formed and named after him with his permission in 1961. The adult MacMillan Pipe Band continues to this day, formed by the graduates of the high school pipe band.\n\n\n"}

Additionally, dirty talk is more sexual in nature than pillow talk and tends to precede rather than follow lovemaking.\n\nThe Marquis de Sade, who fancied himself an expert on matters sexual, states in the introduction to \"The 120 Days of Sodom\" that \"among libertines, it is commonly accepted that the most voluptuous sensations are transmitted by the organs of hearing\" -- that is, that dirty talk is the most arousing form of sex. One fictional character in porn films that became associated with the idea of men using sexual dirty talk with women was actor John Leslie's character of 'Jack' in \"Talk Dirty to Me\" (1980). \n\n\n"}
{"id": "1833246", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1833246", "title": "Michael Peter Smith", "text": "Michael Peter Smith\n\nMichael Peter Smith (born September 7, 1941) is an American, Chicago-based singer-songwriter. \"Rolling Stone\" once called him \"The greatest songwriter in the English language\". He has been singing and composing since the 1960s, and his rich and challenging songs have been recorded by more than 30 performers.\n\nHe is best known for writing \"The Dutchman\", which was popularized by Steve Goodman and also recorded by Brendan Grace, Suzy Bogguss,\nCeltic Thunder, \nLiam Clancy, Norm Hacking, Anne Hills, Mara Levine and Si Khan, John McDermott, the New Kingston Trio, Gamble Rogers, Tom Russell, Jerry Jeff Walker, Robert James Waller, Josh White Jr., and Bernard Wrigley.\n\nSmith was born in South Orange, New Jersey, United States, a rough-edged factory town and shades of it linger throughout his writing. He attended Catholic schools (Our Lady of the Valley and Our Lady of Sorrows), which would shape much of his writing. A notable example is his song \"Sister Clarissa\".\n\nSmith had three younger sisters and they were the basis for his autobiographical play, \"Michael, Margaret, Pat and Kate\", originally presented at the Victory Gardens in Chicago. The play is Smith's story of his upbringing and family relationships surrounding his father's early death.\n\nWhile attending Passaic Valley Regional High School in Little Falls, New Jersey, he discovered the guitar and rock-and-roll. His earliest musical influence was Elvis Presley, although Roy Rogers was a close second. According to Smith, the music \"ruined my grades,\" however, his other love of English never suffered. An avid reader, Smith's command of the language has always shown in the literacy of his songs, and contributed to much of his acclaim. A \"Song Talk Magazine\" review commented that \"[H]earing the songs of Michael Smith in this day and age is like reading an anthology of short stories by Hemingway after decades of only comic books.\"\n\nAfter high school, Smith's family moved to Florida. Two years later, he started college and his interest in folk music blossomed. He cites The Kingston Trio and Harry Belafonte as his earliest folk influences. He spent three years of the 1960s working at a Miami venue called The Flick, playing six nights a week from 1966 to 1968. He was in a Peter, Paul and Mary-style trio for a couple of years which included his wife Barbara Barrow and fellow singer Ron Kickasola. They expanded into a rock band called Juarez and recorded one album for Decca before disbanding. Smith and his wife then played as an acoustic duo for most of the early 1970s.\n\nSteve Goodman's recording of \"The Dutchman\" in 1973 on his album \"Somebody Else's Troubles\", formally introduced Smith's songs to a large audience, and propelled \"The Dutchman\" into Smith's most popular song. Because Goodman was Chicago-based and had been playing several of Smith's songs in his act, it opened a lot of opportunities for Smith in Chicago. So, in 1976 Smith and Barrow moved from Detroit to Chicago, where he became a regular in the city's folk clubs for a couple of years, which allowed him to stop touring. Eventually though, the work began to dwindle and he took a day job as a clerk for \"Time\" magazine to pay the bills. He played a few festivals and a show at the Old Town School of Folk Music now and then, but aside from that, became inactive for about six years. He continued writing and his songs continued to get played and recorded by others all through that time.\n\nBesides \"The Dutchman,\" which Suzy Bogguss covered on her debut effort \"Suzy\" in 1981, Smith classics and their interpreters include \"Spoon River\", a song inspired by the poems of Edgar Lee Masters, which was also recorded by Goodman. Jimmy Buffett and Goodman both recorded \"Elvis Imitators\", Michael's tongue in cheek ode to the King's legions. \"Dead Egyptian Blues,\" a song about ex-pharaohs and their riches was recorded by Trout Fishing in America. A couple of other Smith classics include \"Crazy Mary\", a song about the 'crazy lady next door' in everyone's life that Bonnie Koloc and also David Allan Coe recorded, and \"Last Day of Pompeii\", - a smooth jazz number about the city's impending disaster, which appears on recordings by Trout Fishing in America, Anne Hills, Cathy Miller, and the swing recordings of Harmonious Wail.\n\nIn 1986, Smith found himself regularly taking the stage again. He had started to work with Anne Hills, and Hills got Smith to record two albums for Flying Fish Records, while becoming his producer and touring partner. Smith recorded \"Michael Smith\" (1986) and \"Love Stories\" (1987.) Both albums have been reissued as a single CD, which is among \"Acoustic Guitar's\" list of essential singer-songwriter albums. Hills recorded her own album of Smith songs called \"October Child\" (1993).\n\nIn the winter of 1987, Claudia Schmidt introduced Smith to theatrical director Frank Galati. It was Galati who asked Smith to write the music for Steppenwolf Theatre Company's production of John Steinbeck's \"The Grapes of Wrath\". The Steppenwolf Theatre, founded by Gary Sinise and John Malkovich, has a glowing reputation in Chicago and nationally, and \"The Grapes of Wrath\" became a huge success, playing in Chicago, London, San Diego, and on Broadway where it received Tony Awards for Best Play and Best Director. The success of \"The Grapes of Wrath\" allowed Smith to quit his job as a clerk at \"Time\", and his work in theater brought both new dimensions to his writing and his performances.\n\nSince then, Smith has been performing regularly, both as a solo act and in a duet with Hills. He recorded his third album for Flying Fish, \"Time\" (1994), and recorded a duet album with Hills called \"Paradise Lost and Found\" (1999). He has also continued to write music for theatre, including for a Colorado Children's Theatre production of \"The Snow Queen\". Most notably though, in 1993 Chicago's Victory Gardens Theatre premiered his autobiographical play \"Michael, Margaret, Pat and Kate\". The play won four Jeff Awards (the Chicago Theater Union's equivalent of the Tony), for Best Original Music, Best Production, Best Actor In A Revue, and Best New Work. February 2000 saw the official release of the music from \"Michael, Margaret, Pat and Kate\" by Wind River Records.\n\nSmith has performed at dozens of major folk festivals including the Kerrville Folk Festival, Black Mountain Festival, the Philadelphia Folk Festival, Owen Sound, Gamble Rogers Folk Festival, and Winnipeg Folk Festivals. He has also appeared on a number of radio programs including WUMB's Circle in the Stream, interviews with Studs Terkel on WFMT, a series of interviews on \"All Things Considered\" and \"Good Evening\" on NPR as well as interviews for the BBC in London for \"All Things Considered\". He continues to write songs, tour regularly, do songwriting workshops as well as perform frequently with Hills.\n\nSmith is also known for his whimsical songs such as \"Zippy\", \"Famous in France,\" and \"Move Over Mister Gauguin.\"\n\nIn 2009, Smith won the International Hans Christian Andersen Prize (Copenhagen) for \"The Snow Queen\". The honor is awarded to people who promote and interpret Hans Christian Andersen and his works.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1833247", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1833247", "title": "Love Takes Time", "text": "Love Takes Time\n\n\"Love Takes Time\" is a song by American singer-songwriter Mariah Carey. It was written by Carey and Ben Margulies, and was produced by Walter Afanasieff for Carey's debut studio album \"Mariah Carey\" (1990). It was released as the album's second single on September 11, 1990 through CBS Records. It was the first of several adult contemporary-influenced Carey ballads to be released as a single, and its protagonist laments the loss of a lover and confesses that \"love takes time\" to heal and that their feelings for their ex-lover remain.\n\nCarey quickly recorded the song at the very last minute prior to when her debut album was already \"completed\" and being processed for release. She played the \"Love Takes Time\" demo to CBS Records former CEO Don Ienner while on an airplane. Ienner and other officials immediately insisted the song be included on her upcoming album, even though the album was already going through final stages of completion and Carey wanted to save \"Love Takes Time\" for her sophomore effort. Eventually the song made it on to the album as the closing track, however, due to its late addition, it was not listed as such on early pressings of the album. Re-issues of the album corrected this error.\n\n\"Love Takes Time\" was well received by music critics and went to become another success very similar to her debut single \"Vision of Love\" in the United States and Canada. It became her second number-one single in the United States on its ninth week, attaining the position for three weeks. However, it failed to match the foreign success of \"Vision of Love\", this time charting weakly in Europe, Australia and the United Kingdom. A music video was provided for the song, filmed in black and white at a beach. \"Love Takes Time\" has been included on Carey's compilation album \"Greatest Hits\" (2001), as well as \"#1 to Infinity\" (2015), among others. \"Love Takes Time\" was heavily promoted in the US, being performed live on shows such as \"The Arsenio Hall Show\", \"Mariah's Thanksgiving NBC Special\" and \"The Des O'Connor Show\". She performed the song live at various locations during late 1990, such as the Music Box Tour, her Number 1's tour in Las Vegas (2015-2017) and on selected dates of her ongoing residency, The Butterfly Returns (2018). Most recently performed on select dates on her recent tour Caution World Tour (2019).\n\nIn 1988, an 18-year-old Mariah Carey moved out from her mother's house on Long Island and into an apartment in Manhattan. She had composed a four-track demo tape with her writing partner Ben Margulies while she was attending high school. As 1988 progressed, Carey struggled to impress record executives with the tape and had failed in securing a record deal. She worked several jobs, including as a waitress and coat-checker, in order to pay for studio sessions with Margulies to make changes to the demo. After several months, Carey befriended singer Brenda K. Starr, and soon became one of her back-up vocalists. During recording sessions and rehearsals, Starr began to notice \"glimpses\" of Carey's \"gifted\" vocals. She thought that Carey was capable of achieving mainstream success and that she needed some guidance to break into the industry.\n\nOne evening, Starr took Carey to a record industry gala with hope of convincing a record executive to listen to Carey's demo. Jerry L. Greenberg, the president of Atlantic Records was interested in Carey, but as she handed him the tape, Tommy Mottola grabbed it, and said that he would tend to \"the project\". Mottola left the event later that evening, and got into his limousine and listened to the tape. He quickly realized that he had found a talented vocalist, turned the car around and returned to the party to find Carey, but she had already left. After a week of tracking her down through Starr's management, Mottola got in touch with Carey and brought her over to Columbia Records. After meeting with Carey and her mother Patricia for the first time, Mottola said, \"When I heard and saw Mariah, there was absolutely no doubt that she was in every way destined for super-stardom.\" After a few brief meetings, Carey was signed to Columbia in December 1988.\n\nMariah Carey's debut album for her label Columbia was completed and being mastered when she wrote the song with Ben Margulies. Margulies said, \"It was sort of a gospelish thing I was improvising, then we began working on it. It was on a work tape that we had...and we recorded a very quick demo. It was just a piano vocal demo - I played live piano, and she sang it.\"\nCarey was on a mini-tour of ten states, playing acoustically with a piano player and three back-up singers. While on a company plane, she played the demo of \"Love Takes Time\" for Columbia Records president Don Ienner. \"All the important guys were on the plane,\" Margulies said. \"Tommy Mottola, Ienner, and Bobby Colomby.\" Carey was told the song was a \"career-maker,\" and that it had to go on the first album. She protested - her album was already being mastered, and she intended this ballad for her next release.\n\nThe demo was sent to producer Walter Afanasieff. When Carey flew west to work with Narada Michael Walden on some tracks for her first album, Tommy Mottola and Don Ienner were impressed with Afanasieff's work and gave him an executive staff producer job with the label.\n\"I guess to see if he made the right choice, (Tommy) called me up one day,\" remembers Afanasieff. \"He said, 'We've got this Mariah Carey album done, but there's a song that she and Ben Margulies wrote that is phenomenal, and I want to try everything we can to put it on the album.' I said, 'What do you want me to do?' and he said, 'You only have a couple of days, but are you ready to cut it?' I couldn't believe the opportunity that it was. I'd never produced anything by myself up until that time.\"\n\nThe demo was very close to what Mottola wanted the finished product to be, according to Afanasieff. \"We cut the song and the music and the basics in about a day - and the only reason is this deadline. It was do it or we were gonna miss out on the whole thing. We got the tape and recorded everything and we got on the plane and went to New York (and) did her vocals. She did all the backgrounds, practically sang all night...We came back to the studio that afternoon, and we had to fix one line very quickly, and then (engineer) Dana (Jon Chapelle) and I got back on the plane with the tape, went back to the studio in Sausalito, and mixed it. So it was a three-day process: a day and a half for music, kind of like a day for vocals, and a day for mixing.\"\n\nAfanasieff heard from Columbia executives as soon as they received the mix. They wanted Carey's vocal a little louder, so a remix was quickly completed. The producer asked if the song would still make the debut album, and was told, \"We're going to do our best.\"\nWhen the album was released, \"Love Takes Time\" was not listed on the cassette or compact disc. \"(On) some of the original first copies of the record, they didn't have time to print the name of the song,\" Margulies laughs. \"And so the song's on there, but it doesn't say that it's on there. It was a song that actually was strong enough to stop the pressing...I don't know if they had to throw away a few hundred copies.\"\n\n\"Love Takes Time\" is performed in common time in the key of B major with a slow tempo of 63 beats per minute. Carey's vocals span from F to G in the song.\n\nUpon its release, \"Love Takes Time\" received acclaim from critics. Larry Flick from \"Billboard\" described it as a \"stunning power ballad\" and noted further that the song is \"everything you would expect from the singer-and more.\" \"Entertainment Weekly\" wrote, \"With just the softest synthesizer tinkle, a touch of percussion, and what may well have been a borrowed pair of back-porch wind chimes, she made every last listener feel the utter despair of a breakup: \"Losing my mind/From this hollow in my heart/Suddenly I’m so incomplete.\"\" In 2015, Est 1997 writer Mario stated that it was an ″Adult Contemporary ballad″ and that it was \"arguably some of the strongest melodies and bridge in Mariah’s catalog.\" He continued by saying that ″Her vocals are so pure and passionate that every emotion filters through the music and just reaches and warms the heart. It’s the realisation of a universal truth by a young woman who’s still learning to deal with feelings. There’s almost a sense of naivety in the lyrics but, at the same time, the song sounds mature and it’s relatable. That’s a constant in Mariah’s catalog, something that has marked her strength and endurance as a writer.\"\n\nDuring a review of her 2001 \"Greatest Hits\" album in May 2002, Devon Powers of PopMatters praised the song along with \"I Don't Wanna Cry\", calling it \"stupendous\" and said that ″Her lyrics were exactly what you wanted them to be: simple, memorable, and absolutely true.\" Stephen Filippelli from Review Stream called the song decent, but mainly criticized the music video for the song. Amanda Dobbins and Lindsay Weber of Vulture listed \"Love Takes Time\" at number-nineteen on their list of \"Mariah Carey’s 25 Best Singles\". OO Cities called the song a \"beautiful ballad\".\n\nThe song did not receive as many awards as \"Vision of Love,\" but still managed to win a BMI R&B Award for Song of the Year and Songwriter Award. The song also won Carey the 1991 Soul Train Music Award for Best R&B/Urban Contemporary New Artist.\n\n\"Love Takes Time\" was another success like Carey's debut single \"Vision of Love\" in the United States: it debuted at #73 on September 15, 1990, it reached number–one in its ninth week on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 and spent three weeks at the top of the chart, from November 10 to 24, 1990. It spent seven weeks in the top ten and 17 weeks in the top 40 and the RIAA certified it gold. It topped every other \"Billboard\" chart for which it was eligible (including the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs and Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks). Because its success was divided over two calendar years it did not rank high on \"Billboard\"'s year-end charts, making 76 on the 1990 chart and 69 on the 1991 chart.\n\nHowever, \"Love Takes Time\" failed to emulate its US success in any other market except Canada and Poland, reaching number two on the Canadian \"RPM\" Top Singles chart and number four on the Polish LP3 chart. \"Love Takes Time\" did reach the top ten in New Zealand but it did not make much of an impact elsewhere, becoming a moderate top 20 hit in Australia, and a top 40 hit in the UK and the Netherlands. It failed to reach the top 40 in Germany, peaking at number fifty-seven.\n\nThe single's video, directed by Jeb Brien and Walter Maser, features Carey walking around a beach after a man walks away with luggage in Venice, Los Angeles, California. The video is not included on the DVD/home video \"#1's\" (1999). A live performance of the song filmed at Proctor's Theatre in New York in 1993 was included instead.\n\nThe official single version of the song muffles Carey's whistle note at the conclusion of the bridge before the final verse.\n\nCarey performed the song at The Arsenio Hall Show, later she performed the song at shows like Des O'Connor Tonight, It's Showtime At The Apollo and The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson. Three years later, in 1993, she performed the song in the special Here Is Mariah Carey, filmed at Proctor's Theatre. Later, that year, she performed again during her first stateside tour, the Music Box Tour (1993). After this, she didn't perform the song until 2013, when she sang a snippet of the song during the Australian tour. After this, Carey included the song in her 2015 Las Vegas residency #1 to Infinity serving as the second song. It was also included during selected dates of her 2018-2019 Las Vegas residency The Butterfly Returns. It was performed in select dates of Caution World Tour (2019).\n\nWorldwide CD single\n\nUK CD single\n\nEuropean CD maxi-single\n\nUK limited edition picture disc CD\n\n"}

It is also the titular first set in the block. The Ice Age set is the eleventh set and the sixth expansion set, released in June 1995. Set in the years from 450 to 2934 , the set describes a world set in perpetual winter due to the events in \"\". Ice Age was followed up June 1996 with Alliances, the fourteenth \"Magic: The Gathering\" set and eighth expansion set.; and on July 21, 2006 with \"Coldsnap\". The time period between \"Alliances\" and \"Coldsnap\" was the longest period of time between the beginning and the completion of a full block in Magic. Originally, the set \"\", released in October 1995, was the second set in the \"Ice Age\" block (with \"Alliances\" being the third set), but following the release of \"Coldsnap\", \"Homelands\" was removed from the block in favor of \"Coldsnap\".\n\nThe Brothers' War, referenced in the set \"\" and the Urza block, has thrown Dominaria into a drastic climate change. The temperature has dropped sharply and a new Ice Age has begun. Most of society has been lost; all that remains are the soldier nation of Kjeldor, the barbarians of Balduvia, and the elvish society of Fyndhorn. These people must battle against the necromancer Lim-Dûl who has begun to conduct twisted experiments. Meanwhile, the wizard Zur the Enchanter trains new wizards to survive in the harsh environment.\n\nThe story follows the events of \"Ice Age\", after the so-called goddess (actually a planeswalker) Freyalise had used her magic to end the Ice Age. As the lands grew warmer, conflicts began to erupt. The Balduvian Barbarians were under constant attacks from a vigilante group headed by a former Kjeldoran knight, General Varchild, and needed to turn to their former foes for help. The Soldevi alliance was breaking down amid fears that their unearthing of artifacts of the Brothers' War (as described in \"\") could restart that destructive conflict. And all the while, the wicked necromancer known as Lim-Dûl gathered forces to conquer the entire world.\n\n\"Ice Age\" was the first \"stand-alone\" expansion; that is, it was the first set that could be played independently of other \"Magic: The Gathering\" products. It was the first expansion to reprint all five basic lands. \"Ice Age\" is also the first set that was printed for a certain period. Previous sets had a previously specified print run and were then sold while supplies lasted.\n\nAs \"Ice Age\" was the first \"stand-alone\" expansion set, the designers believed that some \"staple\" cards from the basic set and expansions should be in the set. Thus, the set was also the first expansion set (aside from the \"\" Mountain misprint) to reprint cards. The set included about 8% reprints of old cards. Also, another 8% of the cards were functional reprints of already-printed cards; that is, aside from the name (and possibly the creature type), these cards were identical to cards in other sets.\n\n\"Ice Age\" was the first \"Magic\" expansion that was released in French, German, Portuguese, and Spanish.\n\n\"Alliances\" experimented with different levels of rarities of cards. There are 49 rares in the set, three of these being artifacts that are actually three times as common as the other rares, thus making them just as common as most uncommons. \"Alliances\" was the last set to have multiple cards (other than basic lands) with more than one artistic conception.\n\n\"Alliances\" was the only set besides \"\" to be sold in 12 card packs. Each pack included one rare card, three uncommon, and eight common cards.\n\nThe set is probably best known for the card \"Force of Will\" which allows you to counter a spell without paying the mana cost by exiling another blue card from your hand.\n\nPaul Pettengale reviewed \"Alliances\" for \"Arcane\" magazine, rating it an 8 out of 10 overall. Pettengale comments that \"There are cards within the \"Alliances\" set which are really going to shake up the game of \"Magic\", forcing players to reconsider some of the traditional cards combinations, defence tactics and aggressive routines, and because of this it's a highly refreshing release.\"\n\nIn the initial announcement, Randy Buehler said that \"Coldsnap\" was designed around the same time as \"Ice Age\" and \"Alliances\" but was never released because \"internal politics\" had \"forced\" Wizards to release \"\" instead. However, in the Ask Wizards section on November 10, 2005, a player pointed to several inconsistencies in Buehler's story and suggested that \"Coldsnap\" was in fact a newly designed set. Mark Rosewater confirmed in his February 6, 2006 column that the \"from the vault\" story was a \"cute little cover\" to make the announcement more interesting and expressed surprise that any players took the story at face value. He apologized for the confusion Wizards R&D had created and made it clear that the set is indeed a newly designed one.\n\nSeveral mechanics were introduced in the \"Ice Age\" block. The most notable of these was permanents of the \"Snow\" supertype. \"Ice Age\" introduced basic snow-covered lands, and cards that had effects based on Snow permanents. \"'Coldsnap\" followed that with creatures, artifacts and enchantments of the Snow supertype. Other mechanics introduced included cumulative upkeep and cantrips. \"Ice Age\" was also the first set to print single-colored legends.\n\n\"Alliances\" did not introduce any new named mechanics, but did introduce a number of cards that could be cast by discarding one or more cards instead of paying a mana cost.\n\nBesides expanding on the cumulative upkeep, pitch cards and snow permanents mechanics, \"Coldsnap\" introduced the Recover and Ripple mechanics.\n\n\"Ice Age\" consists of 383 cards. Of these 121 each are common, uncommon, and rare. The remaining 20 cards are basic lands distributed solely in Starter Packs. There were 56 cards of each color, 25 multicolor cards, 45 artifacts, and 33 lands in \"Ice Age\".\n\nThere are 199 cards in \"Alliances\". Including alternate art, there are 31 cards of each color, 10 multicolor cards, 26 Artifacts, and 8 Lands.\n\n\"Coldsnap\" contained 155 cards. Four theme decks were released, which included some cards that were reprints of older cards from both Ice Age and Alliances. The reprints kept the original artwork but used the new borders, updated Oracle wording and the original expansion symbols were given rarity colors.\n\nNotable cards in \"Ice Age\" included ', ', and \n\nNotable cards in \"Alliances\" included ', ', ', ', and \n\nNotable cards in \"Coldsnap\" included ', ', ', ', and \"\".\n\n"}

During the war, however, the area was converted into a false city, its structure closely resembling that of Richmond. Richmond sat nearby to the west of the tract. It is widely accepted that the premise behind the work was to serve as a decoy for German or Japanese bombers on night raids. In theory, when reports would come from the eastern Virginia cities that enemy bombers were flying overhead, the city would cut power to its residents and businesses. At the same time, the lights would come up on Elko Tract - roads built in roughly the same pattern as the city, and a false landing strip arranged identically to the nearby airport, would convince the bombers that they had reached their target. The bombs would then harmlessly fall on an uninhabited stretch of land, and the bombers would return, thinking they had successfully attacked Richmond.\n\nWorld War II ended without any attempt by the Axis Powers to attack Richmond.

From 1839 to 1842, he participated in the Wilkes Expedition, officially known as the United States Exploring Expedition.\n\nHis most notable achievement was serving as captain of the \"Advance\".

De Haven and his crew were at sea for sixteen months, spending the winter inside the Arctic circle.\n\nAfter returning from the expedition, Edwin Jesse De Haven served in the U.S. Coast Survey, before spending the rest of his career at the United States Naval Observatory under superintendent Matthew Fontaine Maury. \n\nSuffering from impaired vision, he was placed on the retired list in 1862. He died in Philadelphia May 1, 1865, and was interred at that city's Christ Church Burial Ground.\n\nThe U.S. Navy named two destroyers USS \"De Haven\" in his honor.\n\n\n"}

He conducted fundamental research in the field of human–computer interaction, developing new ideas, methods, and tools such as the direct manipulation interface, and his eight rules of design.\n\nBorn in New York, Shneiderman, attended the Bronx High School of Science, and received a BS in Mathematics and Physics from the City College of New York in 1968. He then went on to study at the State University of New York at Stony Brook, where he received an MS in Computer Science in 1972 and graduated with a PhD in 1973.\n\nShneiderman started his academic career at the State University of New York at Farmingdale in 1968 as instructor at the Department of Data Processing. In the last year before his graduation he was instructor at the Department of Computer Science of Stony Brook University (then called State University of New York at Stony Brook). In 1973 he was appointed Assistant Professor at the Indiana University, Department of Computer Science. In 1976 he moved to the University of Maryland. He started out as Assistant Professor in its Department of Information Systems Management, and became Associate Professor in 1979. In 1983 he moved to its Department of Computer Science as Associate Professor, and was promoted to full professor in 1989. In 1983 he was the Founding Director of its Human-Computer Interaction Lab, which he directed until 2000.\n\nShneiderman was inducted as a Fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery in 1997, a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 2001, a Member of the National Academy of Engineering in 2010, an IEEE Fellow in 2012 and a Fellow of the National Academy of Inventors in 2015. He is an ACM CHI Academy Member and received their Lifetime Achievement Award in 2001. He received the IEEE Visualization Career Award in 2012 and was inducted into the IEEE VIS Academy in 2019.\n\nIn 2002 his book \"Leonardo's Laptop: Human Needs and the New Computing Technologies\" was Winner of an IEEE-USA Award for Distinguished Contributions Furthering Public Understanding of the Profession. His 2016 book, \"The New ABCs of Research: Achieving Breakthrough Collaborations\", encourages applied and basic research to be combined. In 2019, he published Encounters with HCI Pioneers: A Personal History and Photo Journal.\n\nHe received Honorary Doctorates from the University of Guelph (Canada) in 1995, the University of Castile-La Mancha (Spain) in 2010, the Stony Brook University in 2015., the University of Melbourne in 2017, Swansea University (in Wales, UK) in 2018, and University of Pretoria (in South Africa) in 2018.\n\nIn the 1973 article \"Flowchart techniques for structured programming\" presented at a 1973 SIGPLAN meeting Isaac Nassi and Ben Shneiderman argued:\n\nThe new model technique for structured programming they presented has become known as the Nassi–Shneiderman diagram; a graphical representation of the design of structured software.\n\nIn the 1970s Shneiderman continued to study programmers, and the use of flow charts. In the 1977 article \"Experimental investigations of the utility of detailed flowcharts in programming\" Shneiderman et al. summarized the origin and status quo of flowcharts in computer programming:\n\nFlowcharts have been a part of computer programming since the introduction of computers in the 1940s. In 1947 Goldstein and von Neumann [7] presented a system of describing processes using operation, assertion, and alternative boxes. They felt that \"coding begins with the drawing of flow diagram.\" Prior to coding, the algorithm had been identified and understood. The flowchart represented a high level definition of the solution to be implemented on a machine. Although they were working only with numerical algorithms, they proposed a programming methodology which has since become standard practice in the computer programming field.\nFurthermore, Shneiderman had conducted experiments which suggested that flowcharts were not helpful for writing, understanding, or modifying computer programs. At the end of their 1977 paper, Shneiderman et al. concluded:\n\nAlthough our original intention was to ascertain under which conditions detailed flowcharts were most helpful, our repeated negative results have led us to a more skeptical opinion of the utility of detailed flowcharts under modern programming conditions. We repeatedly selected problems and tried to create test conditions which would favor the flowchart groups, but found no statistically significant differences between the flowchart and non-flowchart groups. In some cases the mean scores for the non-flowchart groups even surpassed the means for the flowchart groups. We conjecture that detailed flowcharts are merely a redundant presentation of the information contained in the programming language statements. The flowcharts may even be at a disadvantage because they are not as complete (omitting declarations, statement labels, and input/output formats) and require many more pages than do the concise programming language statements.\n\nIn 1986, he published the first edition (now on its sixth edition) of his book \"Designing the User Interface: Strategies for Effective Human-Computer Interaction.\" Included in this book is his most popular list of \"Eight Golden Rules of Interface Design,\" which read:\n\nThese guidelines are frequently taught in courses on Human-Computer Interaction.\n\nIn 2003, Ben Bederson and Ben Shneiderman coauthored the book \"The Craft of Information Visualization: Readings and Reflections\". Included in Chapter 8: Theories for Understanding Information Visualization in this book are five goals of theories for HCI practitioners and researchers, which read:\nThe typical goals of theories are to enable practitioners and researchers to: \n\nThese goals are frequently taught in courses on Human-Computer Interaction and cited in works by authors such as Yvonne Rogers, Victor Kaptelinin, and Bonnie Nardi.\n\nShneiderman's cognitive analysis of user needs led to principles of direct manipulation interface design in 1982: (1) continuous representation of the objects and actions, (2) rapid, incremental, and reversible actions, and (3) physical actions and gestures to replace typed commands, which enabled designers to craft more effective graphical user interfaces. He applied those principles to design innovative user interfaces such as the highlighted selectable phrases in text, that were used in the commercially successful Hyperties. Hyperties was used to author the world's first electronic scientific journal issue, which was the July 1988 issue of the \"Communications of the ACM\" with seven papers from the 1987 Hypertext conference. It was made available as a floppy disk accompanying the printed journal. Tim Berners-Lee cited this disk as the source for his \"hot spots\" in his Spring 1989 manifesto for the World Wide Web. Hyperties was also used to create the world's first commercial electronic book, \"Hypertext Hands-On!\" in 1988.\nDirect manipulation concepts led to touchscreen interfaces for home controls, finger-painting, and the now ubiquitous small touchscreen keyboards. The development of the \"Lift-off strategy\" by University of Maryland Human–Computer Interaction Lab (HCIL) researchers enabled users to touch the screen, getting feedback as to what will be selected, adjust their finger position, and complete the selection by lifting the finger off the screen.\nThe HCIL team applied direct manipulation principles for touchscreen home automation systems, finger-painting programs, and the double-box range sliders\nthat gained prominence by their inclusion in Spotfire. The visual presentation inherent in direct manipulation emphasized the opportunity for information visualization.\n\nHis major work in recent years has been on information visualization, originating the treemap concept for hierarchical data. Treemaps are implemented in most information visualization tools including Spotfire, Tableau Software, QlikView, SAS, JMP, and Microsoft Excel. Treemaps are included in hard drive exploration tools, stock market data analysis, census systems, election data, gene expression, and data journalism. The artistic side of treemaps are on view in the Treemap Art Project.\n\nHe also developed dynamic queries sliders with multiple coordinated displays that are a key component of Spotfire, which was acquired by TIBCO in 2007. His work continued on visual analysis tools for time series data, TimeSearcher, high dimensional data, Hierarchical Clustering Explorer, and social network data, SocialAction. Shneiderman contributed to the widely used social network analysis and visualization tool NodeXL.\n\nCurrent work deals with visualization of temporal event sequences, such as found in Electronic Health Records, in systems such as LifeLines2 and EventFlow. These tools visualize the categorical data that make up a single patient history and they present an aggregated view that enables analysts to find patterns in large patient history databases.\n\nIn 2012, Jeffrey Heer and Ben Shneiderman coauthored the article “Interactive Dynamics for Visual Analysis” in Association for Computing Machinery Queue vol. 10, no. 2. Included in this article is a taxonomy of interactive dynamics to assist researchers, designers, analysts, educators, and students in evaluating and creating visual analysis tools. The taxonomy consists of 12 task types grouped into three high-level categories, as shown below.\n\nHe also defined the research area of universal usability to encourage greater attention to diverse users, languages, cultures, screen sizes, network speeds, and technology platforms.\n\n\n"}

She then decided to follow a musical career. Universal Classics and Jazz heard her demo and she was invited to an interview where she sang Rossini's \"Una voce poco fa\". Universal offered Jenkins a six-album deal, the most lucrative in the United Kingdom's classical recording history, reportedly worth £1 million.\n\nSix out of seven of Jenkins's studio albums reached number one in the UK classical charts between 2004 and 2008, selling a total of more than 4 million copies. After her first album, \"Premiere\", made her the fastest-selling mezzo-soprano to date she became the first British classical crossover artist to have two number one albums in the same year. She is the first female artist to win two consecutive Classical BRIT Awards: her second album, \"Second Nature\", reached number 16 in the UK Albums Chart, and was Album of the Year in the 2005 BRIT Awards.\n\nJenkins's Italian-language version of Dolly Parton's \"I Will Always Love You\" (\"L'Amore Sei Tu\"), first performed live at Nostell Priory, West Yorkshire on 28 August 2005, was the first cut on her third album \"Living a Dream\". After that album was released, uniquely, she held the top three positions in the classical crossover music chart. The album held the number one position for nearly a year and reached number four in the pop album charts. Jenkins repeated the success of \"Second Nature\" with her \"Living a Dream\" album when she won the classical BRIT award for Album of the Year for a second time.\n\nHer fourth album, \"Serenade\" was released on 6 November 2006 and reached number five in the mainstream charts selling more than 50,000 copies in its first week, a record in the genre. The top four albums on HMV's classical charts were hers.\n\nHer fifth album, \"Rejoice\", was released on 19 November 2007 and included songs written specially for her, two by Take That's Gary Barlow. The album entered the pop album charts at number three, beating the Spice Girls and Girls Aloud. Jenkins commented \"I never imagined when I was a young girl listening to them on the radio that I would outsell the Spice Girls and Celine Dion. It’s almost too much to take in. I can’t thank my fans enough for all their support.\"\n\nOn 20 October 2008 Jenkins released \"Sacred Arias\", which is her last album with Universal Music. On 19 October \"The Daily Telegraph\" stated that Jenkins had signed the biggest classical recording deal in history, for US$10 million (£5.8 million), with Warner Music.\n\nJenkins released her next album, \"Believe\", on 26 October 2009, the first with Warner Music.

Wass also holds the record for the most wickets taken for Nottinghamshire - 1633 for 20.34 each.\n\nTall and solidly built, Wass had a highly rhythmic run-up that allowed him to be, in his prime, fast through the air. However, it was his leg-cutter that made him formidable, and Wass unlike most fast bowlers of the time was very dangerous after rain but less effective on a firm pitch when the ball did not turn. He also had a very difficult slower ball that on his best days caught many batsmen unaware. Wass was a very moderate fieldsman and had no pretensions to be a batsman – though he did score 56 against Derbyshire in 1906, he was dropped four times in doing so.\n\nWass began his career in local cricket but became a professional for Edinburgh Academicals and Liverpool. Qualified by residence, Wass was offered a place on the Lancashire staff but declined, yet he still took some time to establish himself in a Nottinghamshire side that was in the late 1890s exceedingly weak in bowling and it was never understood why he was given so little to do when he finally broke into the team in the last game against Lancashire. In his first two full seasons, he had very modest records, but in 1900, Wass became Nottinghamshire's chief bowler along with John Gunn and bowled the team to seven victories as against five in the three season from 1897 to 1899. In 1901, apart from one match on a sticky wicket against a weak Derbyshire eleven, Wass was so disappointing he was dropped from the side. He took 58 wickets at the contemporaneously high cost of 29.72 On the wet wickets of 1902 Wass became one of the most difficult bowlers in the game, capturing 140 wickets at 15.89 run each in all first-class cricket. It remains noteworthy how Wass’ bowling was the decisive factor in each Nottinghamshire victory that summer:\n\n\nIn 1903, despite numerous soft pitches, Wass was less effective taking 76 wickets, though this was frequently attributed to the extreme placidity of the Trent Bridge pitches in fine weather. Still, in 1904, though overworked in unfavourable conditions, Wass appeared for the Players at Kennington Oval, which was to remain one of only two appearances he ever made in a representative match. In 1905, he was at times deadly but handicapped by an injury in a local game, which kept him out of a third of Nottinghamshire's county matches.\n\nMay 1906 saw Wass at his deadliest, including one of the most remarkable games in county cricket at Aigburth, where he took 16 wickets in a day on a sticky wicket, yet Nottinghamshire still lost. However, after he recovered from a strain sustained in the Whitsuntide game against Surrey “the long-continued dry weather found out his limitations”. In 1907, however, Wass opened with something even more sensational: taking \"6 wickets for 3 runs\" against the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) after two blank days. This time wet weather continued almost continuously all summer, allowing Wass and Hallam to dominate match after match to such an extent that they took 298 wickets between them in just nineteen games and Nottinghamshire won fifteen of these and were never defeated. Nobody else bar John Gunn did any serious work, and Gunn took only 25 wickets in seventeen matches in which he bowled.\n\nWass was chosen in the thirteen for the First Test against South Africa at Lord's in 1907 but left out of the final eleven. In 1908, despite the fact that Hallam declined owing to rheumatism in his right shoulder, Wass remained at his best and took sixteen for 103 in a day against Essex. 1909, a summer as wet as 1907, was very disappointing: although Hallam was back to full fitness, Wass had his worst record since 1905, but in the following two years Wass recovered his form and when helped by the wicket remained as formidable as ever despite having lost much of his former pace. The wet summer of 1912 was disappointing with the wickets more helpful than ever: Wass took fifty fewer wickets than in 1907, then in 1913 he failed to reach 100 wickets in a full season for the first time in ten years. 1914, when Wass was handicapped by injury and missed seven games, saw him fall further to 69 wickets at his highest average since 1903. After the war he appeared only once, in Joe Hardstaff senior’s benefit match. \"Topsy\" Wass was regarded as a character but was generally popular drawing a remarkably warm tribute from Sir Pelham Warner when he died.\n\n"}

Victorian Police Minister Andre Haermeyer announced a A$500,000 reward for information on the murders, and later said he would consider increasing the reward.\n\nEvidence left at the scene of the crime included pieces of glass, suspected to be from the getaway car used by the killers. Police tested this glass and discovered it came from a late model Hyundai hatchback. After extensive investigations, which took the team to the Hyundai factory in South Korea to obtain vital prosecution evidence, police narrowed down the exact make and model of the vehicle involved in the shootings from the glass samples. The vehicle was registered to the daughter of known criminal Bandali Debs.\n\nOn 24 September 2001, Bandali Debs, a father of five from Narre Warren, Victoria and Jason Joseph Roberts, boyfriend of Debs' daughter, an apprentice builder, of Cranbourne, Victoria faced charges relating to the murders of Silk and Miller as well as 13 other charges of armed robbery relating to offences alleged to have occurred between March and July 1998.\n\nDebs and Roberts were found guilty of the murders and sentenced to life imprisonment. Both are currently serving their sentence with time spent at maximum security Victorian prisons HM Prison Barwon and Port Phillip Prison.\n\nFormer police officer Joe D'Alo was a member of the task force investigating the shootings. He left the force and authored a controversial book titled \"One Down, One Missing\" () about the crime. Assistant Commissioner of Crime, Simon Overland said of the book,\n\nIn May 2007, Debs was convicted of a third murder of an intellectually handicapped teenager named Kristy Mary Harty in Beaconsfield Upper, Victoria around June 1997.

{"id": "1833378", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1833378", "title": "Castizo", "text": "Castizo\n\nCastizo ( (fem. \"Castiza\") ) is a Spanish word with a general meaning of \"pure\", \"genuine\" or representative of its race (from the Spanish: \"casta\") being three quarters white Hispanic and a quarter native. The feminine form is castiza. From this meaning it evolved into other meanings, such as \"typical of an area\" and it was also used for one of the colonial Spanish mixed-race categories, the \"castas\". The category \"Castizo/a\" was widely recognized by the 18th century in colonial Mexico and a standard category in eighteenth-century casta paintings. In the taxonomic chart accompanying a work on casta paintings, \"castizo\" is given as \"uncertain origin\" and appears in 1543 with the meaning \"class, condition, social position\" (\"calidad, clase o condición\").\n\nCasticismo is a tendency among Spanish and Latin American intellectuals to reject foreign loanwords and stick to traditional Spanish roots. An example is \"deporte\", a word recovered from Medieval Castilian meaning \"pastime\", that successfully replaced the Anglicism \"sport\", which has the same Latin origin as the Spanish word. It's closely related to costumbrismo in literature.\n\n\"Castizo\" was a term which appeared in the 1700s and applied to the offspring resulting from the union of a Spaniard and a \"Mestiza\" (offspring of a Spaniard and an Indian woman); that is, someone of three-quarters European and one-quarter Amerindian ancestry. During this era, various other terms (\"mestizo\", \"cuarterón de indio\", etc.) were also used. The word \"cuarterón\" usually denotes someone whose racial origin is three-quarters White and one-quarter Black, but sometimes it refers to a castizo, especially in Caribbean South America. Most scholars do not view the racial labels and hierarchical ordering a rigid or official \"system of castes,\" since there was considerable fluidity in the designations, with individuals being labeled or labeling themselves with different categories at different points in their life. Sometimes different labels were used simultaneously in the same documentation. Castizo was a category used in colonial Mexico. For American-born Spaniards (\"Criollos\"), and \"Castizos\", light-skinned Moriscas were known to desirable marriage partners, since licenses to marry required a declaration of racial status. The category \"castizo\" \"was widely recognized by the eighteenth century, castizos still did not appear in great numbers [in parish documentation] even though they were widely distributed throughout New Spain.\" It was also used in colonial era Guatemala. In colonial censuses, officials sought to keep track of certain categories, particularly where a person could claim to be a Spaniard. \"In the [colonial Mexican] censuses of white/mestizo households, provisions were made to keep accurate records of castizos. The flexibility of having three categories (mestizo, castizo, and español) provided census takers a broader framework within which to capture differences of phenotype -- presumably in hopes of closely regulating entry into the coveted español caste.\" Some were classified as \"castizos\" rather than \"españoles\", but \"their castizo status allowed them to maintain social elevation with the broader mestizo mainstream.\"\nAn eighteenth-century visitor to colonial Mexico published the following observation about race mixture between \"españoles\" and \"indias\". \"If the mixed-blood is the offspring of a Spaniard and an Indian, the stigma [of race mixture] disappears at the third step in descent because it is held as systematic that a Spaniard and an Indian produce a mestizo; a mestizo and a Spaniard, a castizo; and a castizo and a Spaniard, a Spaniard. The admixture of Indian blood should not indeed be regarded as a blemish, since the provisions of law give the Indian all that he could wish for, and Philip II granted to mestizos the privilege of becoming priests. On this consideration is based the common estimation of descent from a union of Indian and European or creole Spaniard.\"\n\n\"Castizo\" is used in Madrid for costumes, music, speech typical of the Madrid populace about the end of the 19th century. A person dressed in \"Castizo\" fashion can be called \"manolo\"/\"manola\" and \"chulapo\"/\"chulapa\". Many zarzuelas are set in a \"Castizo\" environment, like \"La verbena de la Paloma.\"\n\nItems associated with \"Castizo\" culture are the street swivel piano, barquillos, Schottisch music (spelled as \"chotis\") and Manila shawls.\n\n"}

He was the son of Huang Zunsu, an official of the Ming court and an adherent of the Donglin Movement who died in prison after opposing the powerful eunuch Wei Zhongxian.\n\nHuang Zongxi became a licentiate in 1623 at the age of 14, and in the same year followed his father to Beijing, where his father held a post as a censor. The struggle between the Donglin faction and the eunuchs was reaching a climax during this period, and as a result the elder Huang was dismissed from office in 1625 and the two returned home. Soon after, Huang Zongxi was married to Ye Baolin. When Huang Zunsu was traveling in custody to Beijing in 1626, he introduced his son to Liu Zongzhou, a noted philosopher of the Wang Yangming school. Huang Zongxi then became a devoted disciple of Liu and a proponent of the Wang Yangming school.\n\nHuang Zunsu was put to death in 1626. When a new emperor ascended the throne two years later, Huang Zongxi set off for the capital to protest the execution of his father. Even before he arrived, however, the eunuch faction was destroyed and those who died under it were bestowed with honors. Still, Huang engaged in daring acts of vengeance in the capital, gaining the respect of many. In accordance with his father's last wishes, he in 1631 devoted himself to studying Chinese history. In 1633, Huang completed the Shilu, or \"Veritable Records\" of the first thirteen reigns of the Ming dynasty.\n\nAfter the beginning of the Qing dynasty and the rise to power of Ruan Dacheng, arrest warrants were issued for descendants of Donglin members, including Huang Zongxi. Liang Qichao later speculated that Huang avoided capture by fleeing to Japan during this period, but the evidence consists of only one poem. Huang assisted Ming loyalist forces until his retirement in 1649. Thereafter, Huang devoted himself to study and lived near his native home for much of the rest of his life. He died in 1695, at the age of 84.\n\nHuang was notable for being one of the first Neo-Confucians to stress the need for constitutional law. He also openly advocated the belief that ministers should be openly critical of their emperor; and that rulers held a responsibility to their country. Moreover, an emperor should respect the concerns of his prime minister and head of the Imperial College. In local areas, the local gentry, scholars, and students should gather and form an assembly to discuss issues openly with local magistrates and officials.\n\nHuang's first work was not completed until the age of 52, and the work's fuller impact was not felt until the declining years of the Qing dynasty.\n\n\"Waiting for the Dawn\" (Mingyi daifanglu, ) was a summary of ideas about political reform that had been advanced by various scholars since the reign of Wanli (1573–1619). The political tract begins with a condemnation of selfish autocratic rule, and declares that the world should belong to the people. The third and fifth section of the work, \"On Laws\" and \"Schools\", respectively, are particularly famous. In the former, Huang declares that all laws and regulatory bodies should be an outgrowth of local needs, not imposed by leaders with a political agenda. In the latter, he advocates using the education system as a semiofficial forum for educated opinion on public affairs.\n\nIn the sixth and seventh sections of the work, entitled \"Selecting Good Men\", Huang also lays out his ideas for reform of the Imperial examination system. In later sections, he discusses equitable distribution of landholdings, the division between men of civil and military background, fiscal reform, and the problem of Eunuch power during the Ming dynasty.\n\nThe \"Record of the Ming Scholars\" () is a systematic survey of all of the important schools of thought that arose during the Ming Dynasty. It explored their interconnection and geographical distribution, and critically evaluated on the life and teachings of important men from each school. It is usually regarded as the first great history of Chinese philosophy. The work was later lauded by Liang Qichao as a new kind of historiography.\n\nAt the time of his death, Huang Zongxi left behind an uncompleted survey of the Song and Yuan dynasties.\n"}
{"id": "1833432", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1833432", "title": "Samuel Fields", "text": "Samuel Fields\n\nSamuel Fields was an American who falsely claimed to have been a General in the Union Army during the American Civil War. After 1876, General Fields moved to Deadwood, South Dakota to seek his fortune. There he went by several nicknames—including \"Hoe General\" and \"General Darkey\"—but was commonly known as \"General Fields\". The man easily deflected any racial epithets and regardless of his personal wealth at any moment, he referred to himself as a \"sly-coon\".\n\nBecoming an active participant in Deadwood's African-American community, which was even more of a minority than the Chinese, Fields was quick to speak out at the many \"Colored Citizens Meetings,\" as well as city political gatherings. An eloquent speaker, he soon earned yet another nickname – the \"Shakespearian Darkey.\"\nSo \"entertaining\" was Fields, that the local papers often took his words out of context to provide even better stories for their readers. Such was the case when Fields correctly identified a tornado that touched down in Deadwood Gulch as a cyclone in June, 1881. Reporting on his statement, the Deadwood Times snidely referred to it as a \"Sly-Coon,\" which added that nickname to Samuel's already growing list of monikers. While sometimes the newspapers reported legitimate news about Fields, it was often such trivial events such as \"The Shakespearian Darkey attacked by snow balls\" and \"Wonder what bar the darkey cleaned up this morning?\"\nThe quick talking man seemed to be everywhere in Deadwood and in April, 1878 he was arrested as a murder accomplice when Bill Gay shot and killed a man named Lloyd Forbes who was having an affair with his wife. According to the tale, Fields had carried a note between the lovers, when Bill Gay intercepted it. Gay, who was a leading citizen in Deadwood and after whom the adjacent camp of Gayville was named, defended himself on the basis that the killing was an accident. Gay argued that he only meant to pistol whip Forbes and the gun had gone off by accident.\nFields was arrested on the same day as Gay and was kept in the jail for several weeks, mostly for his own protection. Though Fields soon went free, Bill Gay was found guilty of second degree murder and sent to prison. Though Fields had been vindicated, there were many of those in camp who believed that he should be made to leave.\nIn July, the \"General\" was arrested for stealing from \"Lola's Place\", and his bad luck continued when Deadwood's first public school teacher was murdered in her sleep in August. It seems that Fields was either constantly in the wrong place at the wrong time, or had become the focus of blame for any evil that was taking place in the camp.\nAlmost immediately after Minnie Callison had been found murdered, rumors began to circulate that the \"General\" had been seen outside her room that same night. To further complicate matters, Officer Siver found footprints in her yard that were the same size as Fields. Minnie's husband, John Callison, was convinced that Fields was her murderer. On August 20, 1878, Samuel was arrested, and though he was later released, it was yet another cloud that continued to hang over his head.\n\nThen, in December, 1878, the papers reported that Fields had prevented a woman named Annie Simms from committing suicide, so it seems it wasn't all mischief that the papers were reporting on.\nIn 1879, Fields' name was submitted for the position of Justice in Deadwood and by November he was once again practicing his \"Shakespearian\" oratory skills on soap boxes. But the camp hadn't forgotten his alleged \"criminal\" past and he was egged by the audience. Though he didn't win the election, it didn't curb his political ambitions. In 1883, he was working to fill the vacant position of coroner and did in fact temporarily fill the position.\nDuring Fields' time in Deadwood, he was known to have worked at the Merchants, Wentworth, and International Hotels as a porter and as a waiter. By 1889, he had moved on to Omaha, Nebraska, but a year later, he was again back in South Dakota, working as a bellhop in Rapid City. Afterwards, his whereabouts are lost to history.\n\nSamuel Fields's exploits were common fodder in local newspapers, such as the \"Black Hills Pioneer\".\n\nFields was portrayed by Franklyn Ajaye in the HBO series \"Deadwood\" and in 2019's \"\".\n\n"}

Typical examples include operation below the maximum power rating, current rating, or voltage rating.\n\nPower semiconductor devices have a maximum power dissipation rating usually quoted at a case temperature of . The datasheet for the device also includes a \"derating curve\" which indicates how much a device will dissipate without getting damaged at any given case temperature and this must be taken into account while designing a system. \n\nAs can be seen from the derating curve image for a hypothetical bipolar junction transistor, the device (rated for 100 W at ) cannot be expected to dissipate anything more than about 40 W if the ambient temperature is such that the temperature at which the device's case will stabilise (after heat-sinking) is . This final case temperature is a function of the thermal resistance between the device's case and the heat-sink; and the heat-sink and the ambient (this includes the heat-sink's temp/watt rating - with lower values implying better cooling characteristics).\n\nSome capacitors' voltage capability is reduced at higher temperatures because the softened dielectric (e.g., a polymer) is softened further by the heat and its breakdown field strength is reduced. Derating curves are included in data sheets for such capacitors.\n\nDerating can also be used to provide a safety margin for transient voltages or currents (spikes) that exceed normal operation, or simply to prolong life. For example the life of electrolytic capacitors is dramatically increased by operating them below their maximum temperature rating.\n\nAll dimmers rely on heat conduction and convection to keep the electronic components cool. Similarly, power wiring (e.g., house wiring) not surrounded by an air space (e.g., inside a conduit) needs to have its current-limiting device (e.g. circuit breaker or fuse) adjusted so as not to carry as much current through that circuit. Derating is the reduction of the maximum capacity (load) a unit can reliably handle when fins/side sections are removed.\n\n"}

The mountain or its locality is believed to be the birthplace of Genghis Khan as well as his tomb. It is also the birthplace of one of his most successful generals, Subutai.\n\nThe mountain is part of the Khan Khentii Strictly Protected Area established in 1992. It had strong religious significance before Genghis Khan made it a powerful landmark and is considered the most sacred mountain in Mongolia since it was designated as sacred by Genghis Khan. It was inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site on 4 July 2015 under the title \"Great Burkhan Khaldun Mountain and its surrounding sacred landscape.\" Under a Presidential Decree of 1955 the worship of this mountain has been formalised and the mountain declared a national monument. Its ecosystem is complex with unique biodiversity with flora of the Central Asian steppe. It has 50 species of fauna and 253 species of birds.\n\nBurkhan Khaldun is in the northeast of Mongolia in the middle of the Khentii mountain range. The mountain is integral to the Khan Khentii Strictly Protected Area established in 1992 and which extends over an area of .\n\nBurkhan Khaldun means the \"God Mountain\" and is also called Khentii Khan (The King of the Khentii Mountain range). It is one of the Khentii Mountains in the Khentii Province of northeastern Mongolia. It is the highest mountain of the region, rising to an elevation of , and is crescent-shaped. It is the source of several rivers: the Onon and Kherlen rivers flow into the Amur, which has its outfall in the Pacific Ocean; and the rivers Tuul, Kharaa and Yeruu flow northwards to join the Selenge, which empties into the Arctic Ocean. It is in a complex ecosystem with unique biodiversity which is defined as a \"transition zone from Siberian permafrost land forms to great steppe\".\n\nGenghis Khan (also known as Chinggis Khan) lost his battle against the Merkit (one of the major tribal confederations (\"khanlig\") of the Mongols) and escaped death by seeking protection in the sacred precincts of the Burkhan Khaldun mountains. An old woman saved him and a few others. As mark of great reverence, which in Mongolia is considered a highly sacred mountain of spiritual significance, and to the sun above, he offered his respects to the spirits of the mountain around him, sprayed milk into the air and sprinkled it on the earth. He removed his girdle strap, unwinding it from his outfit, and then put it around his neck. Symbolically by this act he surrendered his Mongolian man's pride and expressed his submission to the gods.\n\nHe took off his hat, crossed his hand across his chest and knelt in obeisance nine times offering worship to the sun and the mountain. He spent three days on the mountain offering prayers and thus established a strong bond of spirituality with the mountain and derived special strength from it. In the \"Secret History of the Mongols\", Genghis Khan, who later became the \"World Conqueror\" believing in his own destiny, said: \n\nGenghis Khan then started his campaign to unify the land and people of Mongolia as a strong force. He gave the Burkhan Khaldun the status of a royal sacred mountain. The history is chronicled in the \"Secret History of the Mongols\", which UNESCO recognised in 1990 as a \"literary creation of outstanding universal significance\". In this document Burkhan Khaldun is described in detail and mentioned 27 times, which signifies the unique position of the mountain in Mongolia‘s heritage. This document establishes the authenticity of the site, stating: \n\nA Presidential Decree of 1955 formalised the worship of the Burkhan Khaldun Mountain as a national monument. Special worship is offered to the mountain according to a prescribed procedure at the main \"Ovoo of the Heaven\"; it is reserved for a few officials of the state and local administration, shamans and a few Buddhist lamas (monks).\n\nBurkhan Khaldun was inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site at the 39th session of the World Heritage Committee on 4 July 2015 under the title \"Great Burkhan Khaldun Mountain and its surrounding sacred landscape\", covering an area of and an additional buffer zone of , categorised under Criterion (iv) for its unique cultural tradition of mountain and nature worship of past several millennium, and (vi) for its universally known historical and literary epic of immense importance.\n\nBurkhan Khaldun has a spiritual significance unmatched by any other mountain in Mongolia and is given the symbolic status of the “cradle” of Mongolia's nationhood fully representing the \"heritage and traditional ways of life of nomadic people of Mongolia\". The (unconfirmed) Mongolian belief that Genghis Khan was born here and is buried somewhere in this mountain has added to its sanctity, particularly since Khan offered worship here and declared the mountain as the most sacred in the country.\n\nIt has given authenticity to the spiritual nature of the mountain. As a result, regular pilgrimage is undertaken by the people to the three sacred major ovoos or stone cairns at the sacred sites along a specified route where Mongolian shamanic worship is offered. The specified route is unique and covers: \"Main Ovoo of Heaven\" at the pinnacle of the mountain via \"Gurvan Khoriud\" (\"Three Forbidden Precincts\"); the \"Uud Mod\" (\"Two Trees of Entrance\"); the \"Bosgo Tengeriin Davaa\" (\"Threshold Pass of Heaven\"); the catchment of the Kherlen River and the Sacred Bogd Rivers; and finally to the \"Beliin\" (\"Lowest\") ovoo.\n\nThe flora found in the mountain belongs to the Central Asian steppe and consists of coniferous forests of the taiga. The plant species reported are 28 listed in the Mongolian Red Book, 15 very rare species, and 28 species listed as rare species. The species listed in the IUCN Red List are found here: two critically endangered species, four endangered species, and eight vulnerable species.\n\nIn the faunal geographical province of the Burkhan Khaldun Mountain in the Khentii district the fauna reported are more than \"50 species of 27 genera of six orders including five species of mammals/insectivores, 4 species of hymenoptera, four species of lagomorpha, 19 species of rodents, 13 species of predators, five species of ungulate, one species of reptile, and 253 species of birds\". According to the Mongolian Red Data Book the very rare mammal species are musk deer (\"Moshus moshiferus\") and moose (\"Alces alces\"); the very rare bird species are the Siberian white crane (\"Grus luecogeranus\"), Greater spotted eagle (\"Aquila clanga\"), Pallas’s fish eagle (\"Haliaeetus leucoryphus\"), white-naped crane (\"Grus vipio\") and hooded crane (\"Grus monacha\"); the fish species is the Amur sturgeon (\"Acipenser schrenckii).\"\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1833462", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1833462", "title": "Lawful interception", "text": "Lawful interception\n\nLawful interception (LI) refers to the facilities in telecommunications and telephone networks that allow law enforcement agencies with court orders or other legal authorization to selectively wiretap individual subscribers. Most countries require licensed telecommunications operators to provide their networks with Legal Interception gateways and nodes for the interception of communications. The interfaces of these gateways have been standardized by telecommunication standardization organizations. \n\nWith the legacy public switched telephone network (PSTN), wireless, and cable systems, lawful interception (LI) was generally performed by accessing the mechanical or digital switches supporting the targets' calls. The introduction of packet switched networks, softswitch technology, and server-based applications the past two decades fundamentally altered how LI is undertaken.\n\nLawful interception differs from the dragnet-type mass surveillance sometimes done by intelligence agencies, where all data passing a fiber-optic splice or other collection point is extracted for storage or filtering. It is also separate from the data retention of metadata that has become a legal requirement in some jurisdictions.\n\nLawful interception is obtaining communications network data pursuant to lawful authority for the purpose of analysis or evidence. Such data generally consist of signalling or network management information or, in fewer instances, the content of the communications. If the data are not obtained in real-time, the activity is referred to as access to retained data (RD).\n\nThere are many bases for this activity that include infrastructure protection and cybersecurity. In general, the operator of public network infrastructure can undertake LI activities for those purposes. Operators of private network infrastructures in the United States have an inherent right to maintain LI capabilities within their own networks unless otherwise prohibited.\n\nOne of the bases for LI is the interception of telecommunications by law enforcement agencies (LEAs), regulatory or administrative agencies, and intelligence services, in accordance with local law. Under some legal systems, implementations—particularly real-time access to content—may require due process and receiving proper authorization from competent authorities—an activity that was formerly known as \"wiretapping\" and has existed since the inception of electronic communications. The material below primarily treats this narrow segment of LI.\n\nAlmost all countries have lawful interception capability requirements and have implemented them using global LI requirements and standards developed by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI), Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), or CableLabs organisations—for wireline/Internet, wireless, and cable systems, respectively. In the USA, the comparable requirements are enabled by the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA), with the specific capabilities promulgated jointly by the Federal Communications Commission and the Department of Justice. In the USA, lawful intercept technology is currently patented by a company named Voip-pal.com under the USPTO Publication #: 20100150138.\n\nGovernments require phone service providers to install a legal interception gateway (LIG), along legal interception nodes (LIN), which allow them to intercept in real-time the phone calls, SMS messages, emails and some file transfers or instant messages. These LI measures for governmental surveillance have been in place since the beginning of digital telephony.\n\nTo prevent investigations' being compromised, LI systems may be designed in a manner that hides the interception from the telecommunications operator concerned. This is a requirement in some jurisdictions.\n\nTo ensure systematic procedures for carrying out interception, while also lowering the costs of interception solutions, industry groups and government agencies worldwide have attempted to standardize the technical processes behind lawful interception. One organization, ETSI, has been a major driver in lawful interception standards not only for Europe, but worldwide.\n\nThis architecture attempts to define a systematic and extensible means by which network operators and law enforcement agents (LEAs) can interact, especially as networks grow in sophistication and scope of services. Note this architecture applies to not only “traditional” wireline and wireless voice calls, but to IP-based services such as voice over IP, email, instant messaging, etc. The architecture is now applied worldwide (in some cases with slight variations in terminology), including in the United States in the context of CALEA conformance. Three stages are called for in the architecture: \nThe call data (known as intercept related information (IRI) in Europe and call data (CD) in the US) consists of information about the targeted communications, including destination of a voice call (e.g., called party’s telephone number), source of a call (caller’s phone number), time of the call, duration, etc. Call content is namely the stream of data carrying the call. Included in the architecture is the lawful interception management function, which covers interception session set-up and tear-down, scheduling, target identification, etc. Communications between the network operator and LEA are via the handover interfaces (HI). Communications data and content are typically delivered from the network operator to the LEA in an encrypted format over an IP-based VPN. The interception of traditional voice calls still often relies on the establishment of an ISDN channel that is set up at the time of the interception.\n\nAs stated above, the ETSI architecture is equally applicable to IP-based services where IRI/CD is dependent on parameters associated with the traffic from a given application to be intercepted. For example, in the case of email IRI would be similar to the header information on an email message (e.g., destination email address, source email address, time email was transmitted) as well as pertinent header information within the IP packets conveying the message (e.g., source IP address of email server originating the email message). Of course, more in-depth information would be obtained by the interception system so as to avoid the usual email address spoofing that often takes place (e.g., spoofing of source address). Voice-over-IP likewise has its own IRI, including data derived from Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) messages that are used to set up and tear down a VOIP call.\n\nETSI LI Technical Committee work today is primarily focussed on developing the new Retained Data Handover and next-generation network specifications, as well as perfecting the innovative TS102232 standards suite that apply to most contemporary network uses.\n\nUSA interception standards that help network operators and service providers conform to CALEA are mainly those specified by the Federal Communications Commission (which has both plenary legislative and review authority under CALEA), CableLabs, and the Alliance for Telecommunications Industry Solutions (ATIS). ATIS's standards include new standards for broadband Internet access and VoIP services, as well as legacy J-STD-025B, which updates the earlier J-STD-025A to include packetized voice and CDMA wireless interception.\n\nTo ensure the quality of evidence, the Commission on Accreditation for Law Enforcement Agencies (CALEA) has outlined standards for electronic surveillance once a Title III surveillance application is approved:\nGeneric global standards have also been developed by Cisco via the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) that provide a front-end means of supporting most LI real-time handover standards. All of these standards have been challenged as \"deficient\" by the U.S. Department of Justice pursuant to CALEA.\n\nThe principal global treaty-based legal instrument relating to LI (including retained data) is the Convention on Cybercrime (Budapest, 23 Nov 2001). The secretariat for the Convention is the Council of Europe. However, the treaty itself has signatories worldwide and provides a global scope.\n\nIndividual countries have different legal requirements relating to lawful interception. The Global Lawful Interception Industry Forum lists many of these, as does the Council of Europe secretariat. For example, in the United Kingdom the law is known as RIPA (Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act), in the United States there is an array of federal and state criminal law, in Commonwealth of Independent States countries as SORM.\n\nIn the European Union, the European Council Resolution of 17 January 1995 on the Lawful Interception of Telecommunications (Official Journal C 329) mandated similar measures to CALEA on a pan-European basis. Although some EU member countries reluctantly accepted this resolution out of privacy concerns (which are more pronounced in Europe than the US), there appears now to be general agreement with the resolution. Interception mandates in Europe are generally more rigorous than those of the US; for example, both voice and ISP public network operators in the Netherlands have been required to support interception capabilities for years. In addition, publicly available statistics indicate that the number of interceptions in Europe exceed by many hundreds of times those undertaken in the U.S.\n\nEurope continues to maintain its global leadership role in this sector through the adoption by the European Parliament and Council in 2006 of the far reaching Data Retention Directive. The provisions of the Directive apply broadly to almost all public electronic communications and require the capture of most related information, including location, for every communication. The information must be stored for a period of at least six months, up to two years, and made available to law enforcement upon lawful request. The Directive has been widely emulated in other countries. On 8 April 2014, the Court of Justice of the European Union declared the Directive 2006/24/EC invalid for violating fundamental rights.\n\nIn the United States, three Federal statutes authorize lawful interception. The 1968 Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act, Title III pertains mainly to lawful interception criminal investigations. The second law, the 1978 Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA, as amended by the Patriot Act, governs wiretapping for intelligence purposes where the subject of the investigation must be a foreign (non-US) national or a person working as an agent on behalf of a foreign country. The Administrator of the U.S. Courts annual reports indicate that the federal cases are related to illegal drug distribution, with cell phones as the dominant form of intercepted communication.\n\nDuring the 1990s, as in most countries, to help law enforcement and the FBI more effectively carry out wiretap operations, especially in view of the emerging digital voice and wireless networks at the time, the U.S. Congress passed the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA) in 1994. This act provides the Federal statutory framework for network operator assistance to LEAs in providing evidence and tactical information. In 2005, CALEA was applied to public broadband networks Internet access and Voice over IP services that are interconnected to the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN).\n\nIn the 2000s, surveillance focus turned to terrorism. NSA warrantless surveillance outside the supervision of the FISA court caused considerable controversy. It was revealed in 2013 mass surveillance disclosures that since 2007, the National Security Administration has been collecting connection metadata for all calls in the United States under the authority of section 215 PATRIOT Act, with the mandatory cooperation of phone companies and with the approval of the FISA court and briefings to Congress. The government claims it does not access the information in its own database on contacts between American citizens without a warrant.\n\nLawful interception can also be authorized under local laws for state and local police investigations.\n\nPolice ability to lawfully intercept private communications is governed by Part VI of the Criminal Code of Canada (Invasion Of Privacy). When evaluating Canada’s position on lawful interception, Canadian courts have issued two major rulings on this issue. In June 2014, the Supreme Court ruled that law enforcement officers need a search warrant before accessing information from internet service providers about users’ identities. The context behind this 8-0 ruling is an adolescent Saskatchewan man charged with possessing and distributing child pornography. The police used the man’s IP address to access his personal information from his online service provider— all of which was done without a search warrant. The plaintiff’s attorneys argued that their client’s rights were violated, as he was victim to unlawful search and seizure. Despite the court’s ruling, the evidence gathered from the unwarranted search was used as evidence in trial, as the court claimed that the police were acting in good faith. In accordance to the ruling, the court proclaims that a warrant is not needed if:\n\n\nThe second court case to refer to is from the same year but in December. Essentially, the Supreme Court of Canada argued that police are allowed access to a suspect’s cell phone, but they must abide by very strict guidelines. This ruling came about from the argument of Kevin Fearon who was convicted of armed robbery in 2009. After robbing a Toronto Jewelry kiosk, Fearon argued that the police unlawfully violated his charter rights upon searching his cellphone without a warrant. Although divided, the Supreme Court laid out very detailed criteria for law enforcement officers to follow when searching a suspect's phone without a warrant. There are four rules which officers must follow in these instances:\n\n\nTo continue a search without a warrant, the situation at-hand would need to meet three of the four guidelines stated above. Nonetheless, the court highly encourages law enforcement to request a warrant before searching a cellphone to promote and protect privacy in Canada.\n\nDue to Yarovaya Law, law enforcement is entitled to stored private communication data.\n\nMost countries worldwide maintain LI requirements similar to those Europe and the U.S., and have moved to the ETSI handover standards. The Convention on Cybercrime requires such capabilities.\n\nAs with many law enforcement tools, LI systems may be subverted for illicit purposes, producing a violation of human rights, as declared by European Court of Human Rights in the case \"Bettino Craxi III v. Italy\"\n. It also occurred in Greece during the 2004 Olympics: the telephone operator Vodafone Greece was fined $100,000,000 in 2006 (or €76,000,000) for failing to secure its systems against unlawful access.\n\n\n"}

It is planted in the approximate form of a cathedral, with grass avenues for nave, chancel, transepts, chapels and cloisters and \"walls\" of different species of trees. \n\nThe tree cathedral was planned by Edmond Blyth in the 1930s as an act of \"Faith, hope and reconciliation\" in response to his memories of World War I. As a cadet at Sandhurst in 1916 Blyth had made close friends called Arthur Bailey, John Bennett and Francis Holland who were all killed prior to the end of the war. In 1930 he paid a visit to Liverpool Cathedral, which was then under construction. Blyth wrote: \"As we drove south through the Cotswold hills on our way home... I saw the evening sun light up a coppice of trees on the side of a hill. It occurred to me then that here was something more beautiful still and the idea formed of building a cathedral with trees.\" Work began in 1932 and continued in stages. The site became overgrown during World War II, but development recommenced after the end of the war. The first religious service at the site was held in 1953, and services continue to this day.\nIn 1960 the Tree Cathedral was accepted as a gift by the National Trust. The independent Whipsnade Tree Cathedral Fund is responsible for the religious use of the site. Services have been conducted by many different denominations. It is Grade II listed on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens.\n\nThe Tree Cathedral contains chapels meant for each of the four seasons.\n\nThe cathedral incorporates the following trees.\n\n\nThe site also includes a number of notable shrubs including Berberis, Cotoneaster, Dogwood, Flowering Currant, Holly, Hazel, Lilac, Laurustinus, Laurel, May, New Zealand Holly, Philadelphus, Privet, Rhododendron, and Wild Rose.\n\nThe village of Whipsnade contains houses named after Mr Blyth (Blythswood) and his friends Arthur Bailey and John Bennett (Bailey Cottage and Bennetts Cottage).\n\nThe Icknield Way Path passes adjacent to the Tree Cathedral on its journey from Ivinghoe Beacon in Buckinghamshire to Knettishall Heath in Suffolk. The Icknield Way Trail, a multi-user route for walkers, horse riders and off-road cyclists also passes adjacent.\n\n"}

Part of the City of Port Adelaide Enfield, it is bordered by the suburbs of Rosewater, Queenstown, Cheltenham and Port Adelaide.\n\nAlberton, like Port Adelaide, is rich in historical significance. On 7 March 1839, the South Australian Company was granted private subdivision of preliminary section 423. Section 423 was sold as 'The Town of Albert' and subsequently became 'Albert Town' after Prince Albert, Prince Consort of Queen Victoria. Eventually, 'Alberton' became commonly used and around the turn of the century was officially adopted as the suburb's name.\n\nWith demand for workers at the Port and homes for these workers needed, late in 1840 there were already 61 houses and 235 residents in Alberton. The layout of 'Albert Town' originally had provisions for four public squares, two of which still exist. St Georges' Square became the site for the Anglican Church while St Andrew's Square was later subdivided and became the site of the Trinity Uniting Church. St Patrick's Square and Company Square are today still used as public recreation areas (Couper-Smartt, 2003).\n\nMany of the streets in Alberton took the names of the original purchasers while others, such as 'Prince', 'Queen' and 'King' Streets reflect their English heritage.\n\nAlberton Post Office opened on 1 January 1855.\n\nThe District Council of Queenstown and Alberton was established in 1864, bringing dedicated local government to the residents of the two townships either side of the new Port Road. In 1898 this council was absorbed by the Corporate Town of Port Adelaide.\n\nAlberton is home to Australian rules football team Port Adelaide, who participate in the national Australian Football League (AFL) and the Adelaide-based South Australian National Football League (SANFL). The Alberton Lawn Bowls Club was opened in 1903 at the Alberton Oval as the second oldest lawn bowls club in Adelaide. It leased part of the Alberton Oval from the Port Adelaide Council until 1997 when it became an Underlessee of the Port Adelaide Football Club. \n\nAlberton Oval is located on Queen Street. The ground is used for Australian rules football and cricket and has a capacity of 15,000 people with seated grandstands holding 2,000.\n\nAlberton Oval is the training and administration base for the Port Adelaide Football Club.\n\nFirst licensed in 1848, the Alberton Hotel is one of the oldest hotels in South Australia. For the past 60 years, it has been owned and operated by the Brien family. The old bluestone structure still stands at the same spot on the corner of Port Road and Sussex Street.\n\nLocated on Parker Street, the former Alberton Cemetery was opened in 1847 and officially closed in 1874, with the last burial being conducted in 1922. In 1994, the land on which the former cemetery was located was converted into a park by the City of Port Adelaide.\n\nAlberton railway station was one of the first local stations to open in South Australia. The railway from Adelaide to Port Adelaide was constructed in 1856 and was the first line to be built in South Australia. Alberton was one of the original stops, the others being Woodville and Bowden.\n\nThe stone and brick building on the Port Adelaide-bound platform is the original station building dating from 1856.\n\nThere is still a regular train service from Alberton station to Adelaide and Outer Harbor. Unfortunately the ticket office has been closed for the past twenty years and this contributes to the station buildings being a frequent target for vandalism and graffiti.\n\nThe District Council of Queenstown and Alberton, established in 1864, was the first local government body in Alberton. From 1898 following the annexation of Queenstown and Alberton by Port Adelaide, Alberton was a prominent township at the south eastern end of the Port Adelaide council area. Port Adelaide council merged with Enfield council in 1996 to become the City of Port Adelaide Enfield, which now provides local government to Alberton.\n\nAlberton lies in the electoral district of Cheltenham (formerly Price) and within the safe Labor seat of Port Adelaide. Alberton, like much of the greater Port Adelaide area has always been strong Labor Party territory. Both state and federal government representation in Alberton has been dominated by members of the Labor party.\n\n \n"}
{"id": "1833478", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1833478", "title": "California Geological Survey", "text": "California Geological Survey\n\nThe California Geological Survey, previously known as the California Division of Mines and Geology, is the California state geologic agency.\n\nAlthough it was not until 1880 that the California State Mining Bureau, predecessor to the California Geological Survey, was established, the \"roots\" of California's state geological survey date to an earlier time. As might be expected for a state that owed its existence to the gold rush of 1849, the California State Legislature recognized that geologists could provide valuable information. In 1851, one year after California was admitted to the United States, the Legislature named John B. Trask, a medical practitioner and active member of the California Academy of Sciences, as Honorary State Geologist. In 1853 the Legislature passed a joint resolution asking him for geological information about the state. He submitted a report \"On the Geology of the Sierra Nevada, or California Range\". About two months later, the Legislature created the first California Geological Survey headed by Trask, who retained the title of State Geologist.\n\nWithin a few years the mining of placer gold began to decline and mining of quartz lodes began. These changes, coupled with publication of reports by Trask, created a public clamor for a state geological survey. In 1860 the Legislature passed an act creating the Office of State Geologist and defining the duties thereof. The act named Josiah D. Whitney (for whom Mount Whitney is named) to fill the office. A Yale graduate, Whitney had worked on several surveys in the east. The act directed Whitney to make an accurate and complete geological survey of the state.\n\nWhitney chose William Henry Brewer as chief botanist to lead the original field party. Brewer then added Clarence King, James Gardiner, topographer Charles F. Hoffmann and packer Dick Cotter. It was one of the most ambitious geological surveys ever attempted and yielded a vast amount of information about California that was hitherto unknown and unpublished. Among the natural features of California they were the first to describe Kings Canyon, which they discovered in 1864. The original California Geological Survey influenced the future of surveying and spurred the creation of the United States Geological Survey. Funding for the field work was limited and the last field work was done in 1870 by Hoffmann and W. A. Goodyear. In 1874 the Survey was officially ended due to hostility between then Governor of California Newton Booth and Whitney.\n\nIn 1880 the State Mining Bureau was established by the Legislature. The establishment of the Bureau was a direct action in response to the need for information on the occurrence, mining, and processing of gold in the state. Its focus was on California's mining industry and the Governor appointed the State Mineralogist. In 1891, the Bureau published the first geologic map of the state showing eight stratigraphic units in color, along with numerous blank areas where information was lacking. The second colored geologic map of the state, published in 1916, showed 21 stratigraphic units and was accompanied by an explanatory volume (Bulletin 72, Geologic Formations of California).\n\nIn 1927 the Bureau became the Division of Mines within the Department of Natural Resources. In 1928, with the hiring of the first geologist, the focus of the Division began to shift towards the gathering of basic geologic information. In 1938 a new 1:500,000-scale geologic map was published.\n\nDuring the 1940s and 1950s, the Division developed as a state geological survey and two well-defined branches were established: the Mining Engineering Branch and the Geology Branch. The Division began processing numerous geological quadrangle maps and reports for publication. In 1952 the Division conducted its first public-safety related effort by documenting the impacts of the 1952 Kern County earthquake and its aftershocks.\n\nThe 1960s were years of development of new programs and modernization of long-standing programs. In 1962, eighty-one years after its creation, the Division of Mines was renamed the Division of Mines and Geology (DMG). Its focus had shifted from an organization that was primarily mine-oriented to one responsible for a broader range of practical applications of geology, especially geologic hazards and seismic hazards. A highlight of the decade was the completion in 1966 of the geologic mapping program.\n\nFrom the early 1970s to the present, Division programs have expanded often due to the passage of legislation. Following earthquakes and landslide damage during the 1970s and 1980s, legislation passed which clearly focused DMG's authority on several fronts, including:\n\n\nLanguage was also added which outlined DMG's responsibilities as encompassing:\n\nThe California Geological Survey has had many names over its history. The original \"Geological Survey of California\" was replaced in April 1880 by the new \"California State Mining Bureau\". This was renamed the \"Division of Mines\" in 1927. In 1962 the division's name was expanded to be \"California Division of Mines and Geology\", a name that lasted until August 2006, when the state legislature renamed the division the \"California Geological Survey\".\n\n\n\n"}

All HobbyZone aircraft are sold as a fully assembled, ready-to-fly package which includes all necessary accessories and batteries. Except for the Firebird Commander, the aircraft are patterned around the same basic design which is that of a high wing, experimental-style \"pod and boom\" blow-molded plastic fuselage with a direct-drive pusher propeller and v-tail. \n\nSkill level number one or \"Z1\" are two-channel aircraft aimed at first-time flyers who have had little or no experience with radio controlled aircraft and whose operation can be self-taught. The hand-held transmitter controls throttle and rudder only; climb and descent are strictly a function of throttle position. These models incorporate Horizon Hobby's proprietary \"Smart-Trak\" mixing system which automatically adds a small amount of \"up elevator\" in turns, thus keeping the nose up and avoiding loss of altitude. The Super Cub is the only three-channel \"Z1\" aircraft. \"Z2\" aircraft are three-channel craft which add the third dimension of controllable pitch and are intended for more experienced pilots, but can be learned by first-time pilots with the assistance of an experienced pilot. \"Z3\" aircraft are high-performance three-channel craft and are geared toward intermediate to advanced pilots. Most models regardless of skill level are equipped with the unique \"X-Port\" accessory receptacle which allows the addition of accessories such as a \"bomb\" drop, parachute drop, high-intensity white LED lighting for night operation, or a sonic pulse \"gun\" which allows for air-to-air combat with similarly equipped HobbyZone and ParkZone models. The gun emits a sonic pulse which briefly disables the stricken aircraft's drive motor. Models equipped with the \"Multi-Mode\" system can be flown in beginner mode with limited control surface throws and rudder/elevator mixing or \"sport\" mode which allows full control surface throw.\n\nSome HobbyZone produces include the patented Anti-Crash Technology which utilizes special optical sensors that detect both sky and ground. Should the plane enter a dive, the system automatically applies counter-control to reduce the likelihood of a crash. It also detects and avoids overcompensation of the controls, one of the leading causes of crashes by inexperienced pilots. As skills develop, the ACT is easily disabled by pulling the throttle stick downward and holding it for three seconds. The plane beeps twice to signify the ACT is turned off. Rearming the ACT is accomplished in the same manner and will cause the plane to beep once. Arming and disarming the ACT can be done in flight if desired.\n\nThe second plane to incorporate ACT is the three-channel Firebird Freedom which features a two-piece wing with larger surfaces, a much more powerful 480-series motor with seven-cell power, and steel pushrods to manipulate the control surfaces.\n\nHobbyZone introduced their first scale model in 2006. The three-channel, 480-powered Super Cub RTF incorporates ACT technology for novice pilots in a larger, more powerful package than ParkZone's intermediate J-3 Cub.\n\nWingspan: 47.75 in (1219mm)\nWingspan: 31.8 in (805 mm)\nWingspan: 42.0 in (1070 mm)\nWingspan: 40 in (1016 mm)\nWingspan: 42.25 in (1073 mm)\nWingspan: 20.3 in (515mm)\n\nWingspan: 55 in (1397 mm)\nWingspan: 54.6 in(1390 mm)\n\n\n"}

Members John Davis, Harris Klahr, Christopher Richards, and Matt Borlik formed the band in 1998. After Borlik's departure following the release of their first album, the band went on to record two more critically acclaimed LPs as a three-piece, exploring aspects of dance-punk and other disparate musical styles. Q and Not U disbanded in September 2005 after completing their touring commitments and a short farewell stand at Washington, D.C. venue The Black Cat.\n\nJohn Davis, Harris Klahr, Christopher Richards, and Matt Borlik formed Q and Not U in the summer of 1998 and began playing shows in the D.C. area later that November. They released their first album, \"No Kill No Beep Beep\", in late 2000. It was marked by strongly rhythmic compositions with dissonant guitar and bass, though each song was built around unique melodies and danceable beats that cut through and rode on top of the swells of noise. Several reviewers described the music as \"catchy\", and this quality of oblique yet upbeat and endearing musicality would be a trademark of the band's future work, setting them apart from their aurally less forgiving D.C. hardcore peers and bringing them more into line with the budding dance-punk scene.\n\nFollowing extensive touring in 2000 and 2001, alongside bands like Engine Down, Milemarker, Ted Leo and The Pharmacists, and El Guapo, bassist Borlik was dismissed in November 2001. His absence prompted a more slimmed-down sound as reflected in 2002's \"Different Damage\". Guitarist Richards occasionally took a turn on bass guitar or keyboard and Klahr also incorporated keyboards, as well as a baritone guitar, though they left bass instruments out of some songs altogether, and the album is instead driven by ever-more complex and propulsive dance beats, razor sharp guitar licks (\"So Many Animal Calls\", \"When the Lines Go Down\"), and pronounced use of multiple overlapping vocals from each member of the band (\"Snow Patterns\", \"No Damage Nocturne\"). The album also expanded upon the small patches of hushed tapping cultivated on \"No Kill...\" (\"We Heart Our Hive\") into fully grown bodies of delicate rhythm (\"Soft Pyramids\"). The band toured extensively following the release, making their way through the U.S., Europe, Canada, and Japan.\n\nWhile \"Different Damage\" pulled a lot of sound out of very little equipment, the band put together \"Power\" (2004) using a greater variety of instruments, most notably synths, melodicas and recorders and integrated these new sounds into more delicate, multi-faceted, and ever-more variegated songs. The use of guttural and aggressive bass synth rafts on \"Wonderful People\" and other songs is especially prominent and adds greater depth to the songs, as well as giving heightened value to the bass-less, jangly interludes throughout the album. The tensed and urgent vocal delivery that had been part of each previous release was also pushed to new limits, now developing into falsetto (\"Throw Back Your Head\") and startling choral arrangements (\"District Night Prayer\") that had been previously unexplored.\n\n\n\"After seven years, hundreds of shows, thousands of miles, 46 states, four continents, three albums, only one flat-tire and countless nicknames for Shawn Brackbill, Q and Not U is disbanding,\" wrote band member Chris Richards.\n\"With all of your support, we feel that we've reached all of our shared goals as Q and Not U and we're ready to move on to other projects in life. We all hope to play music together again someday, but we feel that it's a beautiful and natural time to bring this band to a close.\"\n\n\nIn 2009, Richards was named Pop Critic for The Washington Post.\n\n\n\n"}

It is based in London and had offices in Chicago (closed November 2008), Le Havre (closed July 2009), and Berlin (closed December 2008).\n\nSouthern was originally a recording studio owned and operated by John Loder. Loder became friends with musician, author and poet Penny Rimbaud and collaborated with him and others in an experimental progressive band called EXIT. Rimbaud later formed anarchist punk band Crass, and Southern Studios and John Loder were the obvious choice of venue for the recording of their first album \"The Feeding of the 5000\", originally released on Small Wonder Records. When Small Wonder encountered problems manufacturing the release, due to the allegedly blasphemous nature of some of the lyrics, Crass determined they would need to start their own label to take full responsibility and control of their output. Loder facilitated this by acting as the business manager behind Crass Records: arranging manufacture, distribution and accounting.\n\nThe success of Crass and their label thrust Loder into the emerging international independent record business, as he formed alliances with small distributors around the world to distribute the band's output. Through this work he came into contact with a handful of like-minded bands and labels that inspired his passion in a similar way as Crass. He in particular formed a lasting partnership with Dischord Records, helping them to release the Minor Threat records in Europe by pressing and distributing them on their own Dischord imprint.\n\nThe first release on the Southern Records label (not to be confused with Loder's Southern Studios, the recording studio and distributor) was Babes in Toyland's album Fontanelle, in August 1992.\n\nOther label imprints operated by Southern include Black Diamond, Latitudes and Truth Cult.\n\nSouthern closed its US distribution and label offices in November 2008 and moved all operations to London.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Originally an iron and coal mining project under joint Japanese and Chinese control, the mine came under predominately Japanese control. In the early 1930s, Japan invaded the northeast of China, and Liaoning province became part of the Japanese-controlled puppet state of Manchukuo. During the Second Sino-Japanese War, the Japanese forced Chinese labourers—some of whom had been captured from local military organizations—to work the colliery under very poor conditions. Food was scarce and workers did not have sufficient clothing. Working conditions were harsh, and diseases such as typhoid and cholera flourished due to poor sanitation and water supplies. Typically miners worked 12-hour shifts or longer. The Japanese controllers were known to beat workers with pick handles, and the perimeter of the mine was fenced and guarded. Many describe the conditions as slave labour.\n\nOn April 26, 1942, a gas and coal-dust explosion in the mine sent flames bursting from the mine shaft entrance. Miners' relatives rushed to the site but were denied entry by a cordon of Japanese guards, who erected electric fences to keep them out. In an attempt to curtail the fire underground, the Japanese shut off the ventilation and sealed the pit head. Witnesses say that the Japanese did not evacuate the pit fully before sealing it, trapping many Chinese workers underground to suffocate in the smoke. The Soviet Union later investigated and blamed the actions of the Japanese for needlessly increasing the death toll.\n\nIt took workers ten days to remove all the corpses and rubble from the shaft. The dead were buried in a mass grave nearby. Many victims could not be properly identified due to the extent of the burns. The Japanese at first reported the death toll to be 34. Initial newspaper reports were short, as few as 40 words, and downplayed the scale of the disaster, characterizing it as a minor event. Later the Japanese erected a monument to the dead. This stone gave the number of dead as 1,327. The true number is believed to be 1,549, 34% of the miners working that day. It was the worst disaster in the history of coal mining and the second-worst recorded industrial accident. Of this number, 31 fatalities were Japanese, the remaining 1,518 were Chinese.\n\nThe Japanese continued to operate the mine until the end of World War II in 1945, when they were defeated and forced to withdraw from China. Following the Japanese withdrawal, the Chinese workers took control of the site. With the liberation after the war, the Soviet Union investigated the accident. They found that only some of the workers died directly from the gas and coal-dust explosion. Most deaths were from carbon monoxide poisoning produced when the Japanese closed the ventilation and sealed the pit head after the initial explosion.\n\n"}

{"id": "1833547", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1833547", "title": "Nod (gesture)", "text": "Nod (gesture)\n\nA nod of the head is a gesture in which the head is tilted in alternating up and down arcs along the sagittal plane. In many cultures, it is most commonly, but not universally, used to indicate agreement, acceptance, or acknowledgement.\n\nDifferent cultures assign different meanings to the gesture. Nodding to indicate \"yes\" is widespread, and appears in a large number of diverse cultural and linguistic groups. Areas in which nodding generally takes this meaning include the Indian subcontinent (note that the head bobble also shows agreement there), the Middle East, Southeast Asia, most of Europe (see below), South America and North America. Nodding may also be used as a sign of recognition in some areas, or to show respect. An insult may be inferred if it is not returned in kind.\n\nIn Greece, the single nod of the head down that indicates \"yes\" is often combined with closing the eyes simultaneously. This nod commonly also includes a very slight, almost unnoticeable, turn of the head to the left (or to the right).\n\nAn early survey of nodding and other gestures was \"The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals\", written by Charles Darwin in 1872. Darwin wrote to missionaries in many parts of the world asking for information on local gestures, and concluded that nodding for \"yes\" was common to many different groups.\n\nThere are varying theories as to why nodding is so frequently used to indicate acceptance. One simple theory is that it is a form of bowing, indicating that one is prepared to accept what another person is saying or requesting. It has also been stated that babies, when hungry, search for milk by moving their heads vertically, but decline milk by turning their head from side to side.\n\nThere are several exceptions, with some cultures swapping the meanings between nodding and head shaking: in Greece, Iran, Turkey, Bulgaria, Albania, and Sicily a single nod of the head up (not down) indicates a \"no\".\n\nSpecifically in Greece, the single nod of the head up that indicates \"no\" is almost always combined with a simultaneous raise of the eyebrows and most commonly also with a slight (or complete) rolling up of the eyes. There is also a sound that sometimes accompanies the whole gesture, called \"τσου\". This sound bears heavy resemblance, but is not identical, to the British tutting sound. The use of \"τσου\" is optional and reserved only for heavy emphasis on the \"no\". \n\nThe emphasis on the raised eyebrows and the rolling up of the eyes is such, that the actual nod of the head upwards has ended up being of secondary importance. A person can denote \"no\" by simply raising their eyebrows and rolling up their eyes, with the head staying completely still.\n\nNodding can also be used as a form of nonverbal greeting or acknowledgement of another's presence; in this context, it is essentially an especially mild form of bowing, with just enough movement to show a degree of respect without additional formality. This includes the traditional downwards nod, or the upwards nod (which is more informal and usually used among friends or subordinates). To increase the formality, the downwards nod may also be accompanied by a suitable verbal greeting.\n\nNodding is also a symptom of \"nodding disease\", a yet unexplained disease. It affects mostly children under 15, and was first documented in Tanzania in 1962.\n\n\n"}

Machen is a native of Mississippi, and earned several academic degrees before becoming a university administrator and president. Machen had been the president of the University of Utah in Salt Lake City, Utah and the University of Florida in Gainesville, Florida. He also sits on the Sanford-Burnham Medical Research Institute's Board of Trustees. On June 8, 2012, Machen announced he would be stepping down as president in 2013. However, Machen was asked by state and university leaders to stay on, as the school had not yet found a suitable replacement. He was finally succeeded by W. Kent Fuchs on January 1, 2015.\n\nMachen was born in Greenwood, Mississippi in 1944, and grew up in Saint Louis, Missouri. He graduated from Vanderbilt University with his bachelor's degree in 1966, and was a member of Sigma Chi Fraternity (Alpha Psi Chapter). He also graduated from Saint Louis University with his doctor of dental surgery degree in 1968, from the University of Iowa with a master of science degree in pediatric dentistry in 1972 and a doctor of philosophy degree in educational psychology in 1974.\n\nBefore Utah and Florida, Machen was employed in various capacities as professor and administrator by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and the University of Michigan. Additionally, he served in various ways with the Walter Reed Army Medical Center, the National Academy of Sciences, and the American Association of Dental Schools. While serving as the president of the University of Utah, Machen served on the board of trustees of the Salt Lake Olympic Organizing Committee for the 2002 Winter Olympics. He is a retired U.S. Army major.\n\nDuring Florida's 2004 search that resulted in the hiring of new head football coach Urban Meyer, it was speculated that Machen's relationship with Meyer might play a role in the selection. Machen was the president at Utah when Meyer was hired as head coach there.\n\nDuring Machen's term, in 2006, the University of Florida came to agreement with Graduate Assistants United (GAU) to begin providing fully subsidized health care to graduate assistants. GAU is a labor union that represents graduate workers, teaching or research assistants, at UF. GAU negotiated with the administration to include the new program, in their collective bargaining agreement - the culmination of a long GAU campaign. The University of Florida's Graduate Student Council (GSC), an advocacy/student government group, had also worked to bring the issue to the administration's attention and with GAU had representatives on an advisory committee that reviewed bids from insurance companies.\n\nIn January 2009 Machen announced his initiative to increase diversity in the University of Florida's faculty. His leadership was instrumental in creating a Council on Diversity that will be in charge of collecting and analyzing data from different colleges and departments, as well as proposing policies to increase diversity around the university.\n\nIn February 2009, Machen and the Board of Trustees stipulated that they are going to have the University of Florida go through a major transition. The Board of Trustees supported the reduction of the number of undergraduates and shifting resources to graduate education and research in the future.\n\nIn Fall 2010, Machen and Provost Joseph Glover were at the head of an effort to institute block tuition at the University of Florida. In replacement of having students pay by credit hour, students would have been charged a flat-rate fee analogous to 15 credits for full-time undergraduate students regardless of whether they take 12, 15 or 18 credits. The measure to submit proposals for this switch was approved by the Florida Board of Governors in November and would result in an 8 percent increase to state tuition, and an average 7 percent increase imposed by UF, which brings the total increase to 15 percent. The switch was estimated at bringing in $4 million of extra recurring revenue annually for the University. UF is the only university in the state that has expressed a desire to pursue block tuition.\n\nIn an email to University of Florida staff dated June 8, 2012, Machen announced that he informed the UF Board of Trustees of his intention to step down as president of the University of Florida next year. Machen stated his commitment to continuing leadership during the transition to a new university president. However, on January 8, by the request of Florida Governor Rick Scott, Machen decided to stay on as president of the university.\n\nHe was succeeded by W. Kent Fuchs on January 1, 2015.\n\nMachen receives a base salary of $432,808 and $285,000 in annual performance bonuses, with his total annual compensation equalling $751,000, the fourth largest salary in the country for a public university president in 2007. He has been criticized for reducing funding to the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences by both faculty and other administrators. However, in December 2008, Machen announced that he would give his yearly bonus of $285,000 back to the University of Florida with the stipulation that the money had to be used to help fund the Florida Opportunity Scholars Program. When Machen was hired by the University of Florida in 2003, his contract stated he would be eligible, after five years, to receive either a one-year sabbatical (paid leave) or receive the $450,000 bonus in addition to his annual salary. In January 2009, Machen chose to take $400,000 in four annual installments, but after receiving the first $100,000 installment in 2009, it was realized that the four-year payment plan would require Machen to pay federal income taxes on all four installments at the time of the first installment payment. In March 2010, the Board of Trustees voted to pay the remaining three installments in a single lump sum so that Machen might avoid further negative tax consequences. With the addition of the $300,000 lump-sum payment to his base salary and annual performance bonus, Machen's total compensation was approximately $1,050,000 in 2010. Machen's current contract ends in 2013.\n\nMachen stirred a mild controversy by making a veiled innuendo regarding the University of Michigan's academics as they relate to student-athletes and implying that Ohio State University basketball star Greg Oden's academic schedule is a joke.\n\nOn June 17, 2009, it was reported that Bernie Machen had rated the University of Florida above schools such as Duke University and the University of Pennsylvania on the annual \"U.S. News & World Report\" college rankings survey. Machen rated the University of Florida as \"distinguished,\" while rating all other Florida state universities at least two tiers below the University of Florida. These actions were questioned by several Florida media outlets, including the \"St. Petersburg Times\".\n\nMachen stands against the boycotting of Israeli universities. He condemned the proposed boycott in a letter that ran as a full-page advertisement in the August 8, 2007 edition of \"The New York Times\". He helped write the letter in opposition to a recent vote by Britain's leading faculty union, which decided to debate the possibility of boycotting Israeli academic institutions. If passed by Britain's University and College Union, the boycott would cut off relations with Israeli schools to serve as a rebuke of Israel's Palestinian policies.\n\nIn January 2008, Machen publicly endorsed U.S. Senator John McCain for President of the United States. However, Machen cautioned that it should not be interpreted as an endorsement from the entire UF community. Bernie Machen also described how he has been a long-time supporter of Senator McCain.\n\nIn August 2009, Machen publicly endorsed George LeMieux to fill retiring U.S. Senator Mel Martinez's United States Senate seat. Machen cited LeMieux's strong support for higher education and endorsed Governor Charlie Crist's selection to fill the open senate seat. He stipulated that he was not supporting LeMieux for political reasons.\n\nMachen and his wife, Chris, left for a week–long trip to Iran on Thursday, November 13, 2008. The University of Florida's first couple was part of a delegation that included six U.S. university presidents. While in Iran, the presidents visited universities in Tehran and elsewhere and met with their presidents and faculty. At Sharif University, the presidents were part of a forum with Iranian students.\n\nMachen and his wife Chris wrote a letter to the editor published in the \"Gainesville Sun\" expressing their opposition to a city charter amendment on the March 2009 Gainesville city election ballot that would prohibit transgender individuals from using gender specific public facilities for their chosen gender identity as opposed to their physical identity.\n\nOn September 22, 2010, Machen was one of six presidents of major American research universities who met with U.S. Vice President Joe Biden in a roundtable meeting at the White House to discuss the use of funds appropriated by the 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act for scientific research. As of 2009, the University of Florida has received about $120 million in so-called \"stimulus\" funds from the act. Machen touted the six-year study by the University of Florida's Institute on Aging on whether a physical activity regimen can prevent or delay physical disability in the elderly. The study is being funded by approximately $29.5 million in stimulus funds. Machen said the money is worth spending, considering the potential impact the results can have on lowering health care costs. Machen was joined by the presidents of Purdue University, Johns Hopkins University, Washington State University, the University of Pennsylvania and the University of California.\n\nOn November 29, 2010, Machen was named to an Economic Development Transition Team of Governor-elect Rick Scott. Machen's expertise in higher education and its impact on the economy is what interested Scott.\n\nIn January 2012, Machen and Florida State University's Eric J. Barron met with the Florida House of Representatives Higher Education Committee in Tallahassee to discuss improving higher education in the state of Florida. Machen suggested universities should charge higher tuition for science, technology, engineering and math degrees because of their high cost to schools and brought up students' failure to graduate in four years. \"I just can't get them to leave,\" he stated. \n\nIn April 2012, Machen expressed his disappointment, in an email to University of Florida students, faculty, and staff, regarding Florida Governor Rick Scott's decision to veto the Preeminence Bill. The bill would have allowed the University of Florida and Florida State University to increase tuition by more than the current cap of 15% per year. At that rate of increase tuition at these universities could be doubled in five years. Machen's statement explained, \"This legislation presented the University of Florida with a pathway toward excellence and would have enabled the great State of Florida to have two world-class universities.\" \n\n\n\n"}

He was born in 1080 and died between 1131 and 1141.\n\nSanai was a Sunni Muslim. He was connected with the court of the Ghaznavid Bahram-shah who ruled 1117 – 1157.\n\nHe wrote an enormous quantity of mystical verse, of which \"The Walled Garden of Truth\" or \"The Hadiqat al Haqiqa\" (حدیقه الحقیقه و شریعه الطریقه) is his master work and the first Persian mystical epic of Sufism. Dedicated to Bahram Shah, the work expresses the poet's ideas on God, love, philosophy and reason.\n\nFor close to 900 years \"The Walled Garden of Truth\" has been consistently read as a classic and employed as a Sufi textbook. According to Major T. Stephenson: \"Sanai’s fame has always rested on his \"Hadiqa\"; it is the best known and in the East by far the most esteemed of his works; it is in virtue of this work that he forms one of the great trio of Sufi teachers — Sanai, Attar, Jalaluddin Rumi.\" Sanai taught that lust, greed and emotional excitement stood between humankind and divine knowledge, which was the only true reality (\"Haqq\"). Love (\"Ishq\") and a social conscience are for him the foundation of religion; mankind is asleep, living in a desolate world. To Sanai common religion was only habit and ritual.\n\nSanai's poetry had a tremendous influence upon Persian literature. He is considered the first poet to use the \"qasidah\" (ode), \"ghazal\" (lyric), and the \"masnavi\" (rhymed couplet) to express the philosophical, mystical and ethical ideas of Sufism.\n\nRumi acknowledged Sanai and Attar as his two great inspirations, saying, \"Attar is the soul and Sanai its two eyes, I came after Sanai and Attar.\" \"The Walled Garden of Truth\" was also a model for Nizami's \"Makhzan al-Asrar\" (Treasury of Secrets).\n\nThere is a reference to Hakim Sanai's poetry near the end of the 2017 film \"The Shape of Water\" by Guillermo del Toro. In the final scene of the movie, the narrator recites a few verses of poetry without specific attribution, although there is a reference in the film's credit sequence to \"Adapted works by Hakim Sanai.\" Researching for the Library of Congress blog \"From the Catbird Seat\", Peter Armenti confirmed with the assistance of \"Catbird\" blog readers that the poem spoken at the end of \"The Shape of Water\" is del Toro's adaptation of Priya Hemenway's translation of an original poem by Hakim Sanai. Hemenway's translation appears in \"The Book of Everything: Journey of the Heart’s Desire : Hakim Sanai’s Walled Garden of Truth\" (2002).\n\n\n\"While mankind remains mere baggage in the world<br>\n\"It will be swept along, as in a boat, asleep.<br>\n\"What can they see in sleep?<br>\n\"What real merit or punishment can there be?\"\n\n\nHis means for this awakening is surrender to God, his poetry has been called \"the essential fragrance of the path of love\". He hits out at human hypocrisy and folly;\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1833582", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1833582", "title": "Motion Picture &amp; Television Fund", "text": "Motion Picture &amp; Television Fund\n\nThe Motion Picture & Television Fund (MPTF) is a charitable organization that offers assistance and care to those in the motion picture and television industries with limited or no resources. Its mission is to enrich the lives of people in the Southern California entertainment community by continuously evolving to meet their health and human services needs.\n\nThe need for a fund to benefit colleagues who fell on hard times was seen by many in the early days of motion pictures. It began with coin boxes at studios, where industry workers would drop their spare change for their colleagues. The MPTF was created by such industry luminaries as Charlie Chaplin, Mary Pickford, Conrad Nagel, Milton Sills, Douglas Fairbanks, Sr., and D. W. Griffith. In 1921, the Motion Picture Relief Fund (MPRF) was incorporated with Joseph M. Schenck as first president, Pickford was vice president and the Reverend Neal Dodd (who portrayed ministers in more than 300 films) as administrator, each with a benevolent spirit intent on providing assistance to those in the motion picture industry who were in need. The original Board of Trustees included prominent names in Hollywood such as Charles Christie, Cecil B. DeMille, Douglas Fairbanks, Sr., William S. Hart, Jesse L. Lasky, Harold Lloyd, Mae Murray, Hal Roach, Donald Crisp and Irving Thalberg. \n\nThe advent of talkies in the late twenties brought many changes to the film industry. While talkies launched many new careers, hundreds of actors, directors, and writers who had not foreseen the change to the industry or their livelihood, became unemployed. MPRF came to their aid. As more requests for assistance were made, celebrity-packed benefits were held. Celebrity balls, benefit movie premieres, polo matches, fashion shows, and card parties were all means of raising funds for MPRF with talent provided by the likes of Charlie Chaplin, Mary Pickford, Douglas Fairbanks, and Will Rogers. These events raised thousands of dollars in aid, but it was not enough to keep up with the demand for assistance. Other methods of fundraising were needed.\n\nIn 1932, Pickford began the Payroll Pledge Program, a deduction plan for those earning over $200 a week. Studio workers were asked to pledge one-half of one percent of their earnings to the Fund. In 1938, participation in the program was increased by including talent groups, unions and producer representatives. The Screen Actors Guild improved this effort by ruling for compulsory contributions by its Class A members.\n\nThe president Jean Hersholt was seeking an opportunity to supplement the income produced through Payroll Pledge. Dr. Jules C. Stein came up with the idea to have major movie stars appear on a new radio program \"The Screen Guild Show\", whereby they would donate their normal salaries to MPRF. Members of the Directors and Writers Guilds also contributed their services to the show, which premiered on over 61 CBS stations in 1939.\n\nThe first program starred such greats as Jack Benny, Judy Garland, and Joan Crawford, and quickly became one of the most popular programs on network radio, raising $5.3 million for MPRF during its 13-year run. Every major star participated at least once: Humphrey Bogart, Barbara Stanwyck, Gary Cooper, Bing Crosby, Natalie Wood, Bob Hope, Betty Grable, Clark Gable, Carole Lombard, and Tyrone Power.\n\nIn 1940, Jean Hersholt found the property for the future Motion Picture & Television Country House and Hospital. It was of walnut and orange groves, selling for 850 dollars per acre. The Board was able to purchase the land from the money raised from The Screen Guild Show. They immediately sold to offset the costs for the first buildings of the Country House, designed by architect William Pereira. On September 27, 1942, three thousand members of the film community gathered in Woodland Hills for its dedication. In 1948, the Motion Picture & Television Hospital was dedicated. Eventually, the Fund offered services to those working in television, and in 1971 the Motion Picture Relief Fund became Motion Picture & Television Fund. \n\nIn 1993, the Motion Picture & Television Fund Foundation was established with Jeffrey Katzenberg as Founding Chairman. The Foundation continues to exist as the conduit to marshal the vision of its donors and their philanthropy to the growing human needs of the entertainment community it serves. The MPTF Foundation puts on annual events that help raise millions of dollars in funds to continue to assist those entertainment industry members in need. These events include Michael Douglas and Friends Golf Tournament, The Night Before and The Evening Before.\n\nOn September 13, 1996, the MPTF Corporation was created within the State of California and its corporate number is C1989085. Dr. David Tillman, MPTF President and CEO is listed as \"Agent for Service of Process\" with the California Secretary of State. Frank Mancuso, Sr. is Chairman of the MPTF Corporate Board. In 1998, the Woodland Hills campus was renamed The Wasserman Campus of the Motion Picture & Television Fund in honor of the long-time commitment and support of Mr. & Mrs. Lew Wasserman. In February 2000, William Haug resigned as MPTF CEO, and succeeded by Dr. David Tillman on May 16, 2000.\n\nIn 2006, the groundbreaking for the Saban Center for Health and Wellness featuring the Jodie Foster Aquatic Pavilion was held on The Wasserman Campus. The center was named after donors Haim Saban and his wife Dr. Cheryl Saban. It opened its doors on July 18, 2007, and features aquatic and land-based therapies as well as MPTF’s Center on Aging, a best practice model which provides a variety of programs that are geared toward improving the lives of the entertainment industry seniors throughout Southern California. A new and emerging need to address quality of life issues for older adults in their own homes was identified and led to the creation of such MPTF programs and initiatives as Palliative Care, Elder Connection, Rebuilding Together and the MPTF Age Well Program.\n\nOn November 20, 2006, the Motion Picture & Television Fund registered the MPTF Endowment Corporation with California's Secretary of State. Its California corporate number is C2934691. Dr. Tillman is listed as \"Agent for Service of Process\" with the California Secretary of State. Besides offering temporary financial assistance and operating the Motion Picture & Television Country House and Hospital, MPTF's comprehensive services operate six outpatient health centers throughout the greater Los Angeles area as well as the Samuel Goldwyn Foundation Children’s Center.\n\nThere was a turbulent period starting in early 2009 when the MPTF announced that rising costs amid the recession would force it to shutter its long-term care unit, which had 136 patients at the time, as well as its acute-care hospital. That decision created a barrage of criticism with some questioning the fund’s commitment to its stated goal of “taking care of our own. The MPTF restructured, brought in Bob Beitcher in 2010 and launched an aggressive $350 million fundraising campaign in 2012 headed by Jeffrey Katzenberg and George Clooney. Beitcher said the fundraising push was to provide a safety net for the 75,000 baby boomers who would be retiring from the industry over the next 20 years. At that point, $238 million had already been raised with key contributions from Clooney, Steve Bing, Tom Cruise, Barry Diller, Fox Entertainment Group, David Geffen, Michael Lewis, Jerry Perenchio, Joe Roth, Jeffrey and Marilyn Katzenberg, Todd Phillips, Patrick Soon-shiong, Thomas Tull and John Wells, among others. As of 2014, $325 million has been raised for this campaign. For its health care centers, MPTF partnered with UCLA Health which today operates five MPTF health care centers in Los Angeles. These health centers are still exclusive to entertainment industry members.\n\nThe brainchild of Jeffrey Katzenberg, the annual “Night Before the Oscars” launched in 2003, and remains one of the main MPTF fundraising events. The latest 14th annual \"Night Before\" party held February 27, 2016 raised a total of $5.2 million to benefit the MPTF More than $70 million has been raised since the event was launched 14 years ago.\n\nThrough June 1, 2014, the MPTF’s operations include a 250-bed multilevel care hospital, seven primary care health centers, a 186 unit retirement community providing independent and assisted living, and a free-standing child care facility.\n\nTo date, the Samuel Goldwyn Foundation is the single largest donor in the foundation’s 93-year history, with the family’s total contributions to the MPTF upwards of $55 million.\n\nThere are Board of Directors of the fund, Board of Governors for the Foundation.\n\nThe members include: \n\nThe members include: \n\n\nThere's the members of this committee\n\nMembers are:\n\n"}

However, it later fell into disuse and then into ruin. Around 1765 the parcel was bought by Antoni Tyzenhaus (\"Antanas Tyzenhauzas\" in Lithuanian translation), a treasurer of Lithuania, starost of Grodno and a close friend of the Polish king Stanisław August Poniatowski. A notable personality of the epoch, Tyzenhauz was a manager of royal grounds in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and was responsible for a major industrialisation effort in the area of Grodno. In the early 1770s he ordered the construction of a new, classical style palace.\n\nThe house was most probably constructed by a Venetian architect Giuseppe de Sacco. After Tyzenhaus went bankrupt and was dismissed in 1777, the palace fell into disuse. After Tyzenhaus' death in 1785, it was sold to General Fitinhof's widow. She bought the palace in 1789 and she ordered its reconstruction and refurbishment the following year. The work was most probably carried out by German-born architect and professor at the Jesuit Academy of Vilna Martin Knakfuss. The new simplistic façades were added and a so-called Silver hall was built. After the reconstruction, the palace had 30 halls and 16 smaller rooms; and was one of the biggest aristocratic residences in Lithuania. In 1807, yet another refurbishment was carried out by Mikołaj Szulc, after which the interior was modernised and a new staircase was added to the palace.\n\nDespite that, in the 19th century the palace yet again fell into disuse and was parcelated between various shops and stores. Many doors and windows were added on the ground floor and the luxurious part of the palace deteriorated. In the early 20th century the palace was bought by E. Bortkiewicz, who ordered the reconstruction of the second floor. Later, after the city of Vilnius/Wilno became a part of Poland in 1922, the 2nd and 3rd floors were yet again reconstructed to house a \"Hotel Sokołowskiego\", named after its owner. During the German bombings of Wilno during the Polish Defensive War the building was heavily damaged. It was further damaged during Operation Ostra Brama in 1944, and only the cellars, ground floor and outer walls were preserved. Unlike many buildings on Vokiečių street, the palace was rebuilt in 1945. In 1957 the total reconstruction of the palace was led by Algimantas Umbrasas. As with most of the palaces at that time, it was reconstructed by the Soviet authorities to house small apartments. This was due to the shortage of living space in Vilnius caused by a great deal of residential buildings having been destroyed. A fourth floor was added, yet it is invisible from the outside of the palace.\n\nAfter Lithuania regained her independence, the Vilnius Old Town became a prestigious place, and many of the occupants of the palace took the opportunity to sell their flats for a high price. Out of 40 flats that were carved out of the palace, most currently serve as either offices or shops.\n\nThe palace has 3 floors on the street side and 4 floors on the courtyard side. The courtyard is fully enclosed by the building and is accessible through 2 gates, one on each of the adjacent streets. The palace is of trapezoid form. On the street side, the building has a tall attic. It has 2-level gothic cellar, which is currently unused.\n\nOne of more interesting elements are sculptures which can be seen immediately beneath the attic on the street side; there are many different bas-reliefs. The rooms on the sides of building facing the street are in two lines: each room has windows opening on both the street and the courtyard. The walls facing the courtyard are narrower. Other exposures of the palace face other courtyards. The attic was unused following the rebuilding after World War II, but has been put to commercial use since the collapse of the Soviet Union.\n\nIt is on corner of two streets, and has two addresses:\n\n"}

LAFCOs are located in all 58 counties and exercise regulatory and planning powers in step with their prescribed directive to oversee the establishment, expansion, governance, and dissolution of local government agencies and their municipal service areas to meet current and future community needs. LAFCOs were established in 1963 and administer a section of California planning law now known as the Cortese-Knox-Hertzberg Local Government Reorganization Act of 2001.\n\nLAFCOs' regulatory powers are outlined in California Government Code Sections 56375 and 56133. This include approving, establishing, expanding, reorganizing, and, in limited circumstances, dissolving cities and special districts. LAFCOs are also responsible for approving all outside service extensions by contract or agreement beginning in 2001. LAFCOs' regulatory powers are generally exercised in response to applications filed by other local agencies, landowners, or registered voters. LAFCOs' are also allowed to initiate certain proposals if consistent with a recommendation from its own planning studies, such as establishing, consolidating, or dissolving special districts.\n\nLAFCOs' planning responsibilities are explicit to informing their regulatory powers and highlighted by establishing spheres of influence for all cities and special districts. Spheres of influence represent the State of California's version of municipal growth boundaries and demark the territory that the LAFCO independently believes represents the appropriate and probable future jurisdictional boundary and service area of the subject agency. All jurisdictional boundary changes and outside service extensions, notably, must be consistent with the subject agencies' spheres of influence, with limited exceptions.\n\nThey were established in 1963 in all California counties except San Francisco, which would obtain one only in 2001, by the California State Legislature. Their current legal authority and mandate are defined by the Cortese-Knox-Hertzberg Local Government Reorganization Act of 2000 (Government Code Section 56000 \"et seq\"). LAFCOs' powers and duties have expanded in step with subsequent legislation and most recently include regulating cities and districts' ability to provide services outside their jurisdictional boundaries by contract or agreement. LAFCOs also must approve requests by districts to either expand their service powers and/or divest existing service powers.\n\nLAFCOs have both regulatory and planning authority:\n\nUnder the agency, no community within an incorporated city has ever been granted city status. That is partially because the Cortese-Knox-Hertzberg Local Government Reorganization Act of 2000 makes it difficult for communities to break away from their original cities, as the community must gain approval from the city from which it is detaching, and it requires two thirds of the entire community and re-affected city to agree. The only community within a city ever to be brought before a vote by LAFCO was the San Fernando Valley in the early 2000s, which was denied. No detachments from a city have been successful in the state since 1947.\n\nLAFCOs are governed by a commission consisting of appointed elected officials representing the county board of supervisors, city councils, and - at least for most - special district directors. (Not all LAFCOs have special district representation.) The appointed elected officials on LAFCO also appoint members from the general public to serve on the commission. LAFCO funding is provided by local agencies and divided in one-third apportionments between the county, cities, and special districts with the latter amounts further divided among the individual agencies based on tax revenues. \n\nAccording to the Committee on Local Government of the California Senate, LAFCOs regulate all city and most special district boundaries, including these:\n\n\nLAFCOs do not directly regulate counties.

The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) measured it as peaking at a magnitude of 7.0 (6.6) and named it and its subsequent aftershocks the . The quake occurred along a previously unknown fault in the Genkai Sea, North of Fukuoka city, and the residents of Genkai island were forced to evacuate as houses collapsed and landslides occurred in places. Investigations subsequent to the earthquake determined that the new fault was most likely an extension of the known Kego fault that runs through the centre of the city.\n\nFukuoka is not as seismically active as many other parts of Japan, and was known prior to the earthquake as one of Japan's safest locations in terms of natural disasters; the previous earthquake, a magnitude 5, had occurred over a hundred years ago and it had been centuries since the city had experienced a serious earthquake.\n\nFukuoka is located in the northern Kyushu, Japan, and it is in the center of Fukuoka plain. Fukuoka is the most populous and developed prefecture in Kyushu. In geographically, Fukuoka is close to mainland east Asia, and the nearest megacity to Fukuoka is Seoul, South Korea, rather than a domestic Japanese city, and Fukuoka is about as far from Shanghai as Tokyo. As a result, Fukuoka has been the window of east Asian culture flowing into Japan since ancient times, and now there are many direct routes to Korea, mainland China and Taiwan. \n\nThe strong earthquake occurred at 10:53 am in the Kyushu region, about 70 km west of shimonoseki city in Yamaguchi prefecture. The depth of the earthquake was extremely shallow, with a presumed Richter scale of 7.0. The Japan meteorological agency said that quake's epicenter was in the sea of Japan, northwest of Fukuoka prefecture, and the epicenter was about 9 kilometers under the sea. As of 6 p.m. local time, the earthquake has caused 381 people injured and one dead. Kyodo news agency, citing Japan's meteorological agency, said it was the strongest earthquake to hit kyushu since May 1997, and the first to exceed magnitude 6 since 1898. Earthquake experts in Japan said it is rare for a strong earthquake to strike the area. A quake measuring about seven on the Richter scale struck three hundred years ago, but no major quake has struck after that.\n\nFukuoka's most famous major fault, the Kego fault, runs northwest to southeast, roughly parallel to Nishitetsu's Ōmuta train line, and was thought to be 22 km long, terminating at Hakata Bay. It is estimated to be able to produce earthquakes as strong as magnitude 7 at the epicenter approximately once every 15,000 years. When a center is located at a depth of 10 km, it would cause an earthquake of a lower-6 magnitude (similar to the March 20, 2005 earthquake) in downtown Fukuoka. The probability of an earthquake along the known length of the Kego fault occurring within 30 years was estimated at 0.4% prior to the March 20, 2005 earthquake, but this probability has been revised upwards since. According to a National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology presentation April 12, 2005 , supposing the last Kego earthquake had occurred 13,000 years ago, the probability of major activity within 30 years had been revised to 7%, or it were 7,000 years ago, the probability had been revised to 4%. Suppose that an earthquake had occurred along the Kego fault within the last 2000 years, the risk would be unchanged.\n\nAn aftershock hit at 6:11 a.m. April 20 on Japan's southern main island of Kyūshū, the Central Meteorological Agency reported. Although considerable time had passed since the first quake, the aftershock was not unexpected. The quake, which swayed buildings and shattered some outer walls, was measured to have magnitude of 5.8. 2 and 56 people were severely and slightly injured and treated at a hospital in Fukuoka due to the quake and there were temporary closures of major highways, railway services and Fukuoka's airport. Following reports that the city has only prepared for earthquakes up to a magnitude of 6.5, the aftershock renewed fears that the quakes might cause the Kego fault to become active again beneath Fukuoka, leading to an earthquake as big as, or bigger than, the March 20 quake.\n\nIn order to more accurately estimate the risk of ongoing or increased seismic activity, teams from Tokyo University, Kōchi University, Hiroshima University and Ōita University surveyed Hakata Bay to determine how far the Kego fault extends. Preliminary results, announced May 1, 2005 indicated that the fault extends nearly as far as Nokonoshima, 2.5 km out into the bay, though no sign of recent activity along the fault was uncovered. The teams also discovered a new fault in the Higashi-ku portion of Hakata Bay. Later findings indicated that the fault responsible for both the March 20 and April 20 quakes was likely an extension of the Kego fault, making its total length approximately 40 km.\n\nAfter the main shock of the Fukuoka earthquake, several smaller aftershocks happened around the source. By 9 p.m. Tuesday, 85 aftershocks had been recorded. Within a month of the quake, there were four aftershocks with a magnitude of more than 5, including the largest one of M5.8 on April 20. Within half a year the size of aftershocks continued, a total of several thousand times, but the overall trend gradually reduced\n\nDuring this earthquake, more than half of the 225 residential buildings on the Gemanjie Island in the western part of Fukuoka city, near the epicenter, suffered serious damage. The island was particularly hard hit because it near to the quake and traditional Japanese homes are less vulnerable to earthquakes than \"mansions\" that are built by engineers. In Kaido, about 120 homes were destroyed and another 55 damaged partially. ITraditional Japanese houses, particularly in the areas of Daimyō and Imaizumi, were the most heavily damaged and many were marked for demolition. Insurance payments for damage were estimated at approximately 15.8 billion yen. In Tianjin, many windows were smashed and concrete cracked. Temples and shrines were also damaged a lot. More than half of the 225 residential buildings on the Gemanjie Island in the western part of Fukuoka city, near the epicenter, suffered serious damage\n\nAccording to public broadcaster NHK, local rail services were suspended after the tremors triggered an automatic safety mechanism. The operation of the Shanyang Shinkansen between Xinshankou and Bodoi was temporarily suspended. The cracks appeared on sidewalks in residential areas.\n\nOfficials reported water and gas breaks and power outages. Telephone service in the southern prefecture was jammed after an automatic safety mechanism was triggered by the tremors. The quake also caused 103 gas leaks. The meteorological agency issued a tsunami warning after the strong earthquake, but lifted it at noon. Landslides occurred around Fukuoka, Saga and Nagasaki prefectures.\n\nKyushu, which is separated from South Korea by a narrow strait, was felt about 130 miles from the South Korean port city of Busan, where it briefly shook buildings. A Busan police spokesman said no damage was immediately reported.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1833605", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1833605", "title": "Hashomer", "text": "Hashomer\n\nHashomer (, \"The Watchman\") was a Jewish defense organization in Palestine founded in April 1909. It was an outgrowth of the Bar-Giora group and was disbanded after the founding of the Haganah in 1920. Hashomer was responsible for guarding Jewish settlements in the Yishuv, freeing Jewish communities from dependence upon foreign consulates and Arab watchmen for their security. It was headed by a committee of three—Israel Shochat, Israel Giladi, and Mendel Portugali.\n\nHashomer was originated by Socialist Zionists, mostly members of Poale Zion, including Israel Shochat, Manya Shochat, Yehezkel Henkin, Yitzhak Ben-Zvi and Ben-Zvi's wife Rachel Yanait, several of whom had earlier formed a small secret guard society called Bar-Giora, which guarded the Sejera commune (now Ilaniya) and Mes'ha (now Kfar Tavor). Bar-Giora was founded on September 29, 1907 by Israel Shochat, Alexander Zaïd, Yehezkel Henkin in the apartment of Yitzhak Ben-Zvi which was in Jaffa. Less than two years later, on April 12, 1909 the Bar-Giora leadership decided at a meeting in Mes'ha to disband their organization and create a larger one, Hashomer. While earlier settlers had undertaken to defend their lands and communities, Hashomer was the first attempt to provide an organized defence for all the Jewish communities in Palestine. By 1910 Yehezkel Henkin was the first of the Shomer people to ride horseback so he became a riding guard. He taught other “Watchmen” how to ride. This prompted the committee to buy him a horse that he named \"Tzipora\".\nA serious obstacle was the lack of funds with which to buy arms. On Yehoshua Hankin's advice, they asked Eliahu Krause, the manager at Sejera, to lend them the money. The first guns were bought, several of the members refusing to part from them even for a moment.\n\nThey adopted local dress, and many of the customs of the Bedouins, Druze and Circassians. They also drew inspiration from the history of the Cossacks. The first few \"Shomrim\" (guards), worked on foot, but soon acquired horses, which vastly increased their effectiveness. Mendel Portugali laid down the rules of engagement.\nYou do not seek an encounter with the thief; you chase him off, and only when you have no choice do you shoot. After all, he is out to steal a bag of grain, not to murder you, so don't murder him, drive him off. Don't sleep at night. If you hear footsteps, fire into the distance. If you feel he is a few steps away and you can fire without him falling upon you, fire into the distance. Only if your life is in danger—fire.\nGuns used were the same as the locals', which included the 'jift', a single, or double-barrelled shotgun, the 'yunani' and 'osmanli' single-shot muskets, various rifles and Mauser pistols. Modern rifles, known as 'Abu-Hamsa' (father of five), were the most prestigious, and were prone to theft by the locals. The 'shibriyeh' (Arab dagger) and 'nabut' (club or mace) were carried by all. Ammunition was expensive and hard to come by, so primitive production centers were set up.\nHashomer was successful in providing defense for settlements throughout the country; though it sometimes aroused the ire of Arab watchmen, who lost their jobs, and of pilferers, and antagonized the Arab population by retaliatory raids. Some of the older settlers were also worried that Hashomer might upset the status-quo with the local population. During World War I many of its members were exiled to Anatolia by the Ottoman government because they were enemy (Russian) nationals. Several were hanged. When the Turks caught Yosef Lishanski of the Nili group, he told all he knew, implicating twelve members of Hashomer. The group nonetheless survived.\nIn 1920 it was decided to organize the Haganah, a much broader-based group, to cope with new defense challenges and needs of the growing Jewish community in Palestine. Many members of Hashomer joined the Jewish Legion, while others joined the mounted police, and played a prominent part in the defense of Tel Hai and Jerusalem during the Arab riots in 1920 and 1921. In June 1920 HaShomer ceased to exist as a separate body. Its members, however, maintained contact and made an important contribution to the Yishuv's defense. The Haganah itself became the core of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF).\nIn addition to their role as watchmen of the Jewish settlements in the country, members of Hashomer established a number of settlements of their own, including Tel Adash, Tel Hai, and Kfar Giladi.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1833617", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1833617", "title": "Virtual desktop", "text": "Virtual desktop\n\nIn computing, a virtual desktop is a term used with respect to user interfaces, usually within the WIMP paradigm, to describe ways in which the virtual space of a computer's desktop environment is expanded beyond the physical limits of the screen's display area through the use of software. This compensates for a limited desktop area and can also be helpful in reducing clutter. There are two major approaches to expanding the virtual area of the screen. Switchable virtual desktops allow the user to make virtual copies of their desktop view-port and switch between them, with open windows existing on single virtual desktops. Another approach is to expand the size of a single virtual screen beyond the size of the physical viewing device. Typically, scrolling/panning a subsection of the virtual desktop into view is used to navigate an oversized virtual desktop.\n\nSwitchable desktops were designed and implemented at Xerox PARC as \"Rooms\" by Austin Henderson and Stuart Card in 1986 and (unknowingly to the authors until their publication) was conceptually similar to earlier work by Patrick Peter Chan in 1984. This work was covered by a US patent.\n\nSwitchable desktops were introduced to a much larger audience by Tom LaStrange in swm (the Solbourne Window Manager, for the X Window System) in 1989. (\"Virtual Desktop\" was originally a trademark of Solbourne Computer.) Rather than simply being placed at an x, y position on the computer's display, windows of running applications are then placed at x, y positions on a given virtual desktop “context”. They are then only accessible to the user if that particular context is enabled. A switching desktop provides a pager for the user to switch between \"contexts\", or pages of screen space, only one of which can be displayed on the computer's display at any given time. Several X window managers provide switching desktops.\n\nOther kinds of virtual desktop environments do not offer discrete virtual screens, but instead make it possible to pan around a desktop that is larger than the available hardware is capable of displaying. This facility is sometimes referred to as panning, scrolling desktops or view-port. For example, if a graphics card has a maximum resolution that is higher than the monitor's display resolution, the virtual desktop manager may allow windows to be placed \"off the edge\" of the screen. The user can then scroll to them by moving the mouse pointer to the edge of the display. The visible part of the larger virtual screen is called a viewport.\n\nVirtual desktop managers are available for most graphical user interface operating systems and offer various features, such as placing different wallpapers for each virtual desktop and use of hotkeys or other convenient methods to allow the user to switch amongst the different screens.\n\nThe first platform to implement multiple desktop display as a hardware feature was Amiga 1000, released in 1985. All Amigas supported multiple in-memory screens displayed concurrently via the use of the graphics co-processor, AKA the \"Copper\". The Copper was a simple processor that could wait for a screen position and write to hardware registers. Using the GUI implemented in system ROM API's, programs could transparently display multiple independent screens, from non-consecutive memory, without moving the memory. This hardware-based scrolling does not use blitting, but something more like what is sometimes called hardware panning. The video output is simply told (once, or many times) where to display (scanline) and from what screen memory address. A screen can move to any position, or display any portion, by modifying the wait, or fetch position. Typically a single byte value. The Copperlist did need to be sorted in vertical and horizontal wait position in order to function. Note: See http://www.faqs.org/faqs/amiga/books/ for a list of reference material.\n\nEach desktop or 'screen' could have its own colour depth (number of available colours) and resolution, including use of interlacing. The display chipset ('graphics card' on a PC) could switch between these desktop modes on the fly, and during the drawing of a single screen, usually with three pixel deep line between each desktop shown on the screen. However, if one interlaced (flickering) desktop was displayed, all desktops onscreen would be similarly affected.\n\nThis also allowed the OS to seamlessly mix \"Full Screen\" and Windowed \"desktop\"-style applications in a single environment.\n\nSome programs, VWorlds (an astronomy simulator) being an example, used the multiple desktops feature to overlay a set of controls over the main display screen. The controls could then be dragged up and down in order to show more or less of the main display.\n\nAlmost all Unix and Unix-like systems use the X Window System to provide their windowing environment.\n\nThe X Window System is unique in that the decoration, placement, and management of windows are handled by a separate, replaceable program known as a window manager. This separation allowed third-party developers to introduce a host of different window manager features, resulting in the early development of virtual desktop capabilities in X. The first implementation of virtual desktops for Unix was vtwm in 1990. Many of today's X window managers now include virtual desktop capabilities.\n\nConfigurations range from as few as two virtual desktops to several hundred. The most popular desktop environments, GNOME and KDE, use multiple virtual desktops (two or four by default) called workspaces. Some window managers, like FVWM, offer separate \"desks\" that allow the user to organize applications even further. For example, a user may have separate desks labeled \"Work\" and \"Home\", with the same programs running on both desks, but fulfilling different functions. Some window managers such as dwm and Sawfish support \"tagging\" where applications can be configured to always launch on a particular desktop, supporting automatic organization and consistent navigation.\n\nIBM's personal computer OS/2 operating system included multiple desktops (up to 4 natively) in the OS/2 Warp 4 release in 1996. This functionality has also been provided by the open source XWorkplace project, with support for up to 100 virtual desktops. (A somewhat limited functionality version of XWorkplace is bundled with eComStation as eWorkplace, which includes this same functionality.)\n\nUntil Windows 10, Microsoft Windows did not implement virtual desktops natively in a user-accessible way. There are objects in the architecture of Windows known as \"desktop objects\" that are used to implement separate screens for logon and the secure desktop sequence (). There is no native and easy way for users to create their own desktops or populate them with programs. However, there are many third-party (e. g. VirtuaWin, Dexpot and others) and some partially supported Microsoft products that implement virtual desktops to varying degrees of completeness.\n\nMicrosoft offers a utility called Desktops which allows users running Windows Vista or Windows Server 2008 or later operating systems to run applications on up to 4 virtual desktops. Unlike nearly all other virtual desktop solutions for Windows, this utility actually uses native \"desktop objects,\" as discussed above. Because of this, it does not offer the ability to move programs between desktops, or in fact to stop using virtual desktops at all, short of logging off, and Windows Aero only works on the primary desktop object.\n\nMicrosoft had previously provided a Virtual Desktop PowerToy for Windows XP, which simulates many desktops with the more common method of hiding and showing windows in groups, each group being a different desktop. However, the functionality provided is less comprehensive than that of many other virtual desktop solutions (e. g. maintain a window in a given desktop even when its application bar button flashes, etc.). As with all virtual desktop utilities that work by hiding and showing windows, application compatibility problems are common, because application developers do not expect virtual desktops to be in use on the Windows platform.\n\nHistorically, software packaged with some video card drivers provided virtual desktop functionality, such as in Nvidia's nView product (this product has been discontinued for GeForce card owners since Vista). Some of these programs provide eye-candy features similar to those available on Compiz.\n\nMany desktop shell replacements for Windows, including LiteStep, Emerge Desktop and others, also support virtual desktops via optional modules.\n\nWindows 10 offers virtual desktops through a system known as \"Task View\".\n\nDespite its Unix underpinnings, Mac OS X does not use X Windows for its GUI, and early versions had no provision for virtual desktops. Beginning with Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard in late 2007, Mac OS X has shipped with native virtual desktop support, called Spaces, which allows up to 16 virtual desktops. It allows the user to associate applications with a particular \"Space\". As of Mac OS X 10.7 Lion, this functionality has been moved into Mission Control.\nScrolling desktops were made available to Macintosh users by a 3rd party extension called Stepping Out created by Wes Boyd (the future founder of Berkeley Systems) in 1986. The code for this extension was integrated by Apple into a later version of the Mac OS, although the ability to create virtual desktops larger than the screen was removed. The code was used instead as an assist for visually impaired users to zoom into portions of the desktop and view them as larger, more easily discerned images.\n\nBeOS includes an implementation of virtual desktops called \"Workspaces\". Up to 32 different Workspaces are supported.\n\n"}

During the 1910s, it was the largest general union in the UK, but it entered a rapid decline in the 1920s, and eventually became part of the Transport and General Workers' Union (TGWU).\n\nThe idea for a general union arose following an 1897 strike of London-based engineers. The action was defeated by the new Engineering Employers' Federation, and many trade unionists feared that this example would be followed by other employers. Discussions in the \"Weekly Times and Echo\" led to the International Federation of Ship, Dock and River Workers issuing an appeal for the formation of a new general union. The federation's president, Tom Mann, gave the appeal strong support, chairing a conference in February 1898 which proposed a \"labour league\" or \"workers' union\", which would organise workers in all trades and industries, and support independent labour candidates at elections.\n\nThe first branches of the union were formed in April 1898 in Bradford, Halifax, Leeds, London, Manchester, Middlesbrough and Oldham, with the union officially launched on May Day. Charles Duncan was employed as president and general organiser, while Tom Chambers as general secretary and Mann as vice president came from the international federation, and worked only part-time for the union \n\nInitially, the union was unsuccessful, membership peaking at 4,172 at the end of 1898. For example, recruitment at both the Army & Navy Stores and Lipton's Tea led to industrial action, and short booms in membership followed by defeats and then a collapse in membership. William Banham and J. Wade were employed as full-time local organisers in London, while other early organisers included John Mahoney in Middlesbrough, and George Newcombe in Coventry, but all had left by the end of 1901. From late 1900, Chambers and Mann were forced to devote their time to the international federation, Chambers being replaced by Duncan, who in turn was succeeded as president by Robert Morley, while Mann retained his office as an honorary position. Duncan successfully brought the union's finances under control, and began offering optional benefits to out-of-work members. For the next few years, membership continued to fall, bottoming out at only 1,000 in 1903, but it then began growing, reaching 5,000 in 1910. New organisers were employed, including George Titt in Manchester, Joseph Harris in Ireland, and Matt Giles in South Wales, while John Beard, who had been working part-time for the union among agricultural workers, was transferred to a full-time post in Birmingham.\n\n1911 saw increased unrest among workers in the UK, and the Workers' Union capitalised on this. Membership increased rapidly, to 18,000 by the end of 1911, 91,000 by the end of 1913, and 143,000 by mid-1914. It was now a similar size to the National Union of Gasworkers and General Labourers, the largest general union in the UK. The additional funds allowed Duncan to launch a publicity campaign, principally through the \"Daily Citizen\", and take on several members of administrative staff, and increase the number of full-time organisers from six to forty. They included George Dallas in London, and George Kerr in Scotland\nBeard defeated Morley in the 1913 presidential election, his victory coming on the back of the recruitment of large numbers of semi-skilled engineering workers in the West Midlands by him, Arthur Ellery, and Julia Varley. The union also recruited strongly among agricultural workers, with Sidney Box and R. O. Hornagold being the principal organisers.\n\nOn formation, the union affiliated to the Trades Union Congress (TUC) and the General Federation of Trade Unions, but it left both bodies in 1900, as a money-saving measure. It attempted to rejoin the TUC in 1913, but was blocked by other unions which claimed that it was poaching their members. The union was a founder member of the Labour Representation Committee, and remained affiliated as it became the Labour Party. Despite its original aim of sponsoring labour candidates, it was unable to do so until 1918. However, Duncan managed to gain the sponsorship of the Amalgamated Society of Engineers, and served as an MP from 1906 onwards. The union's leadership supported World War I, with both Beard and Duncan joining the British Workers' League, although they left in 1918 when it supported anti-Labour Party Parliamentary candidates. Duncan and Morley stood for the Labour Party in the 1918 UK general election, but both were unsuccessful. Neil Maclean, a union member, did win a seat with the backing of the Independent Labour Party, and in 1919 he was elected to the union's executive.\n\nThe union's growth stalled during World War I, but then leapt dramatically in 1918, reaching 495,000 by the end of the year, making it the largest trade union in the country. It tried to recruit more women, and by the end of the war had twenty women organisers, who succeeded to take women's membership from 5,000 to 80,000 by the end of the war. The union also recruited among Belgian refugee engineers, who at the end of the war were transferred to the Belgian Metal Workers' Union. A large number of small, localised unions amalgamated in, with the National Farm and Dairy Workers' Union and Anglesey Workers' Union boosting agricultural membership, which peaked at around 120,000, and the National Union of Government Employees, led by Arthur Gourd, boosting membership in dockyards, which peaked at about 25,000. Expansion allowed the opening of an arbitration department, led by William Kelly, and the opening of new headquarters in Golders Green. A divisional structure was adopted in 1915, with Beard, Dallas, Ellery, Giles, Harris, Kerr, Morley and Titt appointed to head the new divisions, supplemented after the war by William Adamson, Gourd, Hugh Lawrie, Tom Macnamara (soon succeeded by Alf Edmonds), and James McKeag. In addition, the union led a successful general strike on the Isle of Man, and opened branches in Gibraltar, Malta and Tangier.\n\nIn 1919, the union joined the National Amalgamated Workers Union, a loose confederation with the Municipal Employees Association and the National Amalgamated Union of Labour, but this dissolved in 1922.\n\nMembership of the union collapsed during the 1920s, with job losses due to the depression, the General Strike of 1926 and disputes over payments to members of the executive committee. In 1929, it merged into the Transport and General Workers' Union (TGWU), with about 100,000 members remaining to transfer. This enabled the TGWU, for the first time, to gain significant numbers of members outside of the docks and transport industries.\n\nThe union sponsored Labour Party candidates in numerous Parliamentary elections, several of whom won election.\n\n"}
{"id": "1833622", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1833622", "title": "California Environmental Quality Act", "text": "California Environmental Quality Act\n\nThe California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) is a California statute passed in 1970 and signed in to law by then-Governor Ronald Reagan, shortly after the United States federal government passed the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), to institute a statewide policy of environmental protection. CEQA does not directly regulate land uses, but instead requires state and local agencies within California to follow a protocol of analysis and public disclosure of environmental impacts of proposed projects and, in a departure from NEPA, adopt all feasible measures to mitigate those impacts. CEQA makes environmental protection a mandatory part of every California state and local (public) agency's decision making process. It has also become the basis for numerous lawsuits concerning public and private projects.\n\nCEQA has been criticized for being \"abused\" (used for reasons than environmental ones) to block, downsize, delay, or gain other concessions from new development. Residents use CEQA to try to block homeless shelters and affordable housing projects from being located in their neighborhoods; one study found that 85% of CEQA lawsuits were filed by organizations with no record of environmental advocacy and 80% of CEQA lawsuits targeted infill development; CEQA requirements have dramatically increased the difficulty of creating bicycle lanes on already existing roads; and unions have used CEQA lawsuits or threats thereof to force developers to use union workers.\n\nThe CEQA statute, California Public Resources Code § 21000 et seq., codifies a statewide policy of environmental protection. According to the act, all state and local agencies must give major consideration to environmental protection in regulating public and private activities, and should not approve projects for which there exist feasible and environmentally superior mitigation measures or alternatives.\n\nCEQA mandates actions all state and local agencies must take to advance that policy. Specifically, for any project under CEQA's jurisdiction with potentially significant environmental impacts, agencies must identify mitigation measures and alternatives by preparing an Environmental Impact Report, and must approve projects with feasible mitigation measures and the environmentally superior alternative. The California Resources Agency promulgates the CEQA Guidelines, California Code of Regulations Title 14 § 15000 et seq., which detail the protocol by which state and local agencies comply with CEQA requirements. Appendix A of the CEQA Guidelines summarizes this protocol in flowchart form. CEQA originally applied to only public projects, but California Supreme Court interpretation of the statute, as well as later revisions to the wording, have expanded the CEQA's jurisdiction to nearly all projects within California, including those accomplished by private businesses and individuals. § 21002.1: \"Each public agency shall mitigate or avoid the significant effects on the environment of projects that it carries out or approves whenever it is feasible to do so.\" For private projects, CEQA applies when a discretionary government permit or other entitlement for use is necessary.\n\nIf a project is not exempt from CEQA, a lead agency can conduct an initial study to preliminarily assess project impacts. Appendix G of the CEQA Guidelines lists types of environmental impacts to consider in checklist form. This initial study guides the lead agency to prepare either a negative declaration, mitigated negative declaration, or environmental impact report depending on the impact assessment. The initial study completion also gives the project applicant opportunity to change their project scope early in the CEQA process if the initial study indicates significant impact(s) are likely. If the lead agency determines the project clearly has significant impacts, they can skip the initial study phase and immediately conduct an Environmental Impact Report.\n\nUnder CEQA, every agency in the state \"is encouraged to develop and publish thresholds of significance\" against which to compare the environmental impacts of projects. Such thresholds are to be published for public review and supported by substantial evidence before their adoption. A lead agency will normally consider the environmental impacts of a project to be significant if and only if they exceed established thresholds of significance. According to a 2001 survey, however, few agencies have actually developed thresholds of significance. The survey's analysts wondered, \"if most agencies are \"not\" developing thresholds and publishing them for public review, then what criteria \"are\" they using?\". In absence of thresholds of significance developed independently by lead agencies, impact assessments apply the significant criteria detailed in Appendix G, Environmental Checklist, of the CEQA Statutes and Guidelines, which is produced by the California Office of Planning and Research (OPR). Lead agencies can also defer to authority agencies that publish their recommended guidelines for the resources they regulate. Examples of this include the California Department of Conservation has threshold tests for assessing impacts to agricultural resources using the LESA model, and the Bay Area Air Quality Management District has published guidelines for air quality impacts.\n\nThe lead agency must analyze project impacts to 18 different environmental resource factors detailed in Appendix G during their CEQA review. The next section discusses background and setting for each resource factor; and how lead agencies conduct their analysis and the authority for their significance thresholds for these resources.\n\nGHG legislative history; rule making; regulated greenhouse gases and their sources; and GHG CEQA responsible agencies are discussed below. The next section describes the analytical approach to determining if a project has significant GHG impacts using guidelines from two Air Quality Management Districts in California. Finally, mitigation measures recommended by air districts and used on various projects are presented for GHG impact analysis.\n\nGreenhouse gas emissions were not required to be analyzed as an impact to the environment when CEQA was originally adopted. Several scientists have since attributed greenhouse gases to climate change and resulting negative impacts to humans and the environment. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) issued a report in 2007 stating that human activities are responsible for increased global temperatures. As a result of these assessments, the California Legislature passed Assembly Bill 32, the Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 that mandated greenhouse gas emissions be reduced to 1990 levels by 2020. Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger signed Executive Order S-3-05 in June 2005 that declared California is vulnerable to climate change impacts resulting in loss of Sierra snowpack for water supply and rising sea levels threatening coastal real estate and habitat. Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger also signed Executive Order S-21-09 in September 2009 requiring 33% of electricity sold in the California come from renewable resources by 2020 to curb greenhouse gas emissions. This assembly of legislation and evidence of environmental impact led to California enacting requirements for lead agencies to consider greenhouse gas emissions in their CEQA reviews.\n\nCalifornia Office of Attorney General sent several comment letters to lead agencies urging them to consider greenhouse gas emissions during their CEQA review. Senate Bill 97 required the Governors Office of Planning and Research to develop and recommend new guidelines to analyze greenhouse gas impacts under CEQA. California's Natural Resources Agency adopted new guidelines on December 31, 2009, requiring lead agencies to analyze greenhouse gas emissions under section 15064.4 during their CEQA review through California.\n\nThe major category of greenhouse gas emissions resulting from human activities is carbon dioxide. Several other primary gases also include methane, nitrous oxide, sulfur hexafluoride, perfluorocarbons, and hydrofluorocarbons. Greenhouse gas sources resulting from project construction activities are typically generated from transportation of materials to the project site and petrol based equipment used during construction of the project itself. Stationary sources emit greenhouse gases from a single point source such as a smoke stack. Stationary source examples include coal- or gas-fired power plants, incinerators, refineries, bakeries, or chemical plants. Projects that are not stationary sources such as residential and commercial developments, schools, and related infrastructure can also contribute to increases in greenhouse gases. These projects emit greenhouse gases from sources such as vehicle mileage trips to site, energy to run the facility, and landscape maintenance equipment. Land use conversion can reduce vegetation sequestration of carbon dioxide.\n\nThe State Air Resources Board or California Air Resources Board is the state agency charged with monitoring and regulating sources of greenhouse gas emissions under AB32. California's thirty-five local air pollution control districts (APCD's) and air quality management districts (AQMD's) are the agencies primarily responsible for regulating stationary sources of air pollution. These air districts traditionally provide guidance to lead agencies, such as counties, cities and public utilities, on the evaluation of air pollutants under CEQA.\n\nThe lead agency is the public agency which has the principal responsibility for approving a proposed project. The lead agency determines which type of environmental document will be prepared (Mitigated Negative Declaration, Environmental Impact Report, etc.) and has discretion to adopt significance criteria more conservative than those required by CEQA. §15064.4 provides a lead agency discretion to determine which type of analysis approach to utilize for a given project level GHG analysis:\n\n“(1) Use a model or methodology to quantify greenhouse gas emissions resulting from a\nproject, and which model or methodology to use. The lead agency has discretion to select the model or methodology it considers most appropriate provided it supports its decision with substantial evidence. The lead agency should explain the limitations of the particular model or methodology selected for use; and/or\n\n(2) Rely on a qualitative analysis or performance based standards.”\n\nThe lead agency is charged with making a good-faith effort to “describe, calculate, or estimate the amount of greenhouse gas emissions resulting from a project.”\n\nLifecycle analysis of GHG includes the full aggregate quantity of GHG generated from the extraction, production, distribution and use of energy or fuel. If a lead agency had to complete a GHG lifecycle analysis under CEQA, they would have to quantify GHGs produced not only within the spatial boundary of the project site, but GHGs generated from transportation of products to the site and product supply chain production emissions. Several of these energy emissions could be produced overseas leading to difficulty by the lead agency in verification and enforcement of emission thresholds. CEQA guidance currently does not require lifecycle analysis of GHG emissions since the term is not well defined and too speculative, and the Office of Planning and Research (OPR) removed the term “Life Cycle” from CEQA guidelines in 2010. If any portion of the analysis is considered speculative by the lead agency and not supported by defensible and quantifiable scientific evidence, the impact must be eliminated pursuant to CEQA Guidelines 15145.\n\nThresholds of significance can be determined by reference of air quality management district CEQA guidelines, although the ultimate discretion for thresholds remains with the lead agency. The Bay Area Air Quality Management District, South Coast Air Quality Management District, and San Joaquin Valley Air Pollution Control District are the only districts to date that have adopted CEQA guidelines. Below are highlights from the BAAQMD and SCAQMD:\n\nThe Bay Area Air Quality Management District (BAAQMD) typically acts as the responsible agency for setting CEQA air emission thresholds within the San Francisco Bay Area Air Basin. The BAAQMD adopted new guidance on June 2, 2010 to address greenhouse gas emission thresholds related to operational related emissions from stationary sources and projects other than stationary sources. Stationary sources are allowed to emit up to 10,000 metric tons (MT) e/year. Other projects are allowed to emit 1,100 MT of e/yr; 4.6 MT e/SP/yr; or compliance with a qualified greenhouse gas reduction strategy. The BAAQMD has not established construction related emissions thresholds, deferring this responsibility to the CEQA lead agency. Chapter 8.2 of the BAAQMD Air Quality Guidelines recommends lead agencies quantify construction emissions and assess if they conflict with AB 32 goals. BAAQMD also recommends using URBEMIS air modeling software to calculate GHG emissions on land use changing projects, and RoadMod software for linear projects. BAAQMD recommends analysis of operational emissions in the five step process: eliminate greenhouse gas analysis if project attributes do not pass screening criteria, quantify emissions using appropriate models, compare unmitigated emissions with thresholds of significance, implement mitigation measures if project is over thresholds of significance, then compare emissions again with thresholds of significance.\n\nThe South Coast Air Quality Management District has developed a tiered analysis process for determining the significance of project-related GHG emissions. If a project is not categorically or otherwise exempt, and if it cannot be shown that the GHG emissions from the project are within GHG budgets in approved regional plans, then project applicants are required to show that the project GHG emissions are below, or mitigated to less than, the applicable following significance screening level:\n\nLead agencies can implement several different mitigation measures to offset or reduce GHG emissions. The BAAQMD recommends using the following best management practices for construction activities: 15% of project's heavy equipment and transportation fleet run on alternative fuels and/or electricity, recycling or reusing 50% of demolition waste, and using 10% local of building materials. Other measures used to reduce construction emissions include limiting equipment idle time, car pooling, and purchase and retire of offsite carbon credits.\n\nBAAQMD recommends lead agencies mitigate operational emissions by adopting a qualified GHG Reduction Strategy that is consistent with AB 32. This strategy can be incorporated into the lead agency's general plan or programmatic level policy for assessing GHG emissions. The strategy involves assessing “business as usual” current and forecasted emissions to calculate a baseline for reduction. The lead agency then proposes measures to reduce those emissions to meet AB 32 expectations. BAAQMD recommends the project mitigate to the maximum extent feasible before considering offsite mitigation options, and offsite mitigation should be measurable, enforceable, and occur within the nine-county Bay Area.\n\nProjects may be exempt from CEQA if they are ministerial in nature, have been exempted by the California Congress through a statutory exemption, or fall within any of the classes of exemption by category that CEQA recognizes that do not have a significant impact on the environment. If the lead agency determines the project could have no significant environmental impacts after completing an initial study, no EIR will be necessary, but the lead agency must still prepare a Negative Declaration (Neg Dec) that discloses the impact analysis. If the project could have significant environmental impacts, but the lead agency has incorporated mitigation measures to lower those impacts to less than significant, no EIR will be necessary, but the lead agency must prepare a Mitigated Negative Declaration that demonstrates how all identified significant impacts will be mitigated to below the level of significance. Finally, if the lead agency determines the project may have significant environmental impacts, the lead agency must prepare an EIR.\n\nCEQA applies to any action when a project requires discretionary approval by a state or local governmental body. Projects may also require ministerial permits that must comply with general plans and local ordinances such as building permits or marriage licenses. These decisions cannot be denied and provides the governmental body with no judgement as long as the proponent meets the specifications detailed in the permit or license requirements. CEQA does not apply when only ministerial approval is necessary.\n\nThe California state legislature has, on occasion, abrogated CEQA such that specific projects or types of projects could proceed without an EIR. One such abrogation occurred in October 2009, with the passage of a union-backed law exempting the proposed construction of Los Angeles Stadium from CEQA's requirements. The abrogation mooted an ongoing lawsuit, brought by eight residents of a neighboring city, challenging the validity of the developer's EIR. The developer had originally prepared an EIR for a commercial development on the site, then prepared a supplemental EIR to include a proposed 75,000 seat stadium situated within 3,000 feet of homes in that neighboring city; the plaintiffs argued that a single new EIR studying the entire project was required. State officials said the abrogation ended an abuse of CEQA by individuals seeking to obstruct the project; at the signing ceremony, Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger said he would \"terminate the frivolous lawsuit.\" A plaintiff in the lawsuit said the abrogation \"opens up the door for other developers... to hire lobbyists... and get exemptions from the environmental laws.\" An environmental lawyer said that the slow economy would probably encourage developers to seek more abrogations, as legislators become more eager to stimulate job growth.\n\nSeveral categorical exemptions for projects are listed under Title 14 of the California Code of Regulations, Chapter 3, Article 19. These exemptions cover projects that do pose a significant impact to the environment and fit within the description of the several categories listed under Article 19. A common categorical exemption used by agencies is 15301 for maintenance of existing facilities. Since the project is already built, the project often has no significant new impacts. Agencies do not have to file any CEQA findings for categorically exempt projects. They can be legally challenged by the public on whether the project must undergo CEQA. The lead agency can file a Notice of Exemption (NOE) to trigger a 35-day statute of limitations period for legal challenge or, if no NOE is filed, a 180-day statute of limitations applies.\n\nAfter the initial study is completed, the lead agency can then determine if the project could have a significant impact on the environment. The lead agency must propose mitigation measures to reduce any impacts to less than significant \"to the maximum extent feasible.\" The lead agency then prepares a draft Negative Declaration (ND) or Mitigated Negative Declaration (MND) and publishes the document for public review for at least 21 days. After comments are considered, the lead agency can either recirculate the ND/MND if public comments required the project scope to substantially change, or the lead agency can adopt the document. The Lead agency must file a Notice of Determination (NOD) after adopting the document with a 30-day statute of limitations for legal challenge. If the lead agency is presented with a fair argument that shows substantial evidence of the project having a significant environmental impact after mitigation measures are exhausted, the lead agency is required to prepare an Environmental Impact Report. Thus, in essence, an ND/MND may only be used to satisfy CEQA requirements for projects with no significant unmitigated adverse environmental impacts (ND) or for which all potentially significant adverse impacts have been \"avoided, reduced or minimized\" to below the threshold of significance (MND). If significant impacts remain, an EIR must be prepared and a Statement of Overriding Considerations are necessary.\n\nAccording to case law, the environmental impact report (EIR) is at \"the heart of CEQA\". An EIR serves to inform governmental agencies and the public of a project's environmental impacts. Further, an EIR is required to propose mitigations and alternatives which may reduce or avoid any significant adverse environmental impacts; as the EIR is considered the heart of CEQA, mitigation and alternatives are considered the heart of the EIR. One alternative that a lead agency must usually consider is the no project alternative, that is, cancellation of the project, with the future instead unfolding according to existing plans (i.e., the status quo). Among all the alternatives, the EIR identifies the environmentally superior alternative; if the environmentally superior alternative is the no project alternative, the EIR identifies the environmentally superior alternative among the other alternatives.\n\nThe EIR process begins with the circulation of a Notice of Preparation (NOP) which informs the public, responsible agencies, trustee agencies, and the OPR that an EIR will be prepared for a given project. The NOP must include sufficient project description details and likely environmental effects such that agencies and public citizens can provide meaningful comments on the proposed project for analysis in the EIR. The NOP comment period is no shorter than 30 days. After preparation of the draft EIR, a Notice of Completion (NOC) must be submitted to the Office of Planning and Research which includes project location, location of review copies, and public comment review period information. The lead agency must provide public notice of the draft EIR at the same time it issues the NOC. This notice must include the location of any public meetings intended to solicit comments on the draft EIR. If the draft EIR is circulated through the State Clearinghouse, then the public comment period must be 45 days minimum. The lead agency must prepare a final EIR before approving the project. The contents of a final EIR are specified in §15132 of the CEQA guidelines, but responses to draft EIR comments are the focus of the document. The lead agency then certifies the final EIR and issues its findings. Should significant and unavoidable impacts remain after mitigation, a Statement of Overriding Considerations must be prepared. Finally, the lead agency may decide whether or how to approve or carry out the project at which time a notice of determination (NOD) must be filed within five days of approval. Appeal periods and litigation avenues remain after the NOD.\n\nSimilar laws at the federal and state levels require environmental impact analysis before commencing major projects.\n\nNEPA, a United States federal statute passed the year before CEQA, is similar to CEQA in that both statutes set forth a policy of environmental protection, and a protocol by which all agencies in their respective jurisdictions make environmental protection part of their decision making process.\n\nNEPA is narrower in scope than CEQA. NEPA applies only to projects receiving federal funding or approval by federal agencies, while CEQA applies to projects receiving any form of state or local approval, permit, or oversight. Thus, development projects in California funded only by private sources and not requiring approval by a federal agency would be exempt from NEPA, but would likely be subject to CEQA.\n\nThe environmental impact statement (EIS) required under NEPA and the EIR required under CEQA are similar documents, yet have some crucial differences. For example, under NEPA, an agency can list all reasonable alternatives and their impacts, then choose their preferred project without regard to the severity of its impacts, even if it is more harmful to the environment. Under CEQA, the lead agency is required to mitigate all \"significant\" adverse environmental impacts to \"the maximum extent feasible\" and can approve a project only if the agency adopts a Statement of Overriding Considerations detailing the specific overriding economic, legal, social, technological, or other considerations that outweigh the project's significant, unavoidable impacts. If a major federal project, or project using federal funds is seeking approval in California, its lead agency must prepare both an EIS and an EIR, but both can be combined into one document (since the EIS and EIR have the same elements for the most part). Said document, however, must be processed through both the CEQA and NEPA approval steps.\n\nAs of 2005, fourteen states as well as the District of Columbia have CEQA-style laws requiring impacts be reported for projects. CEQA influenced many of these laws, and New York state's law used CEQA as a foundation. Connecticut's Environmental Policy Act (CEPA) is modeled on CEQA and requires lead agencies to prepare an Environmental Impact Evaluation (EIE) that is very similar in nature to California's EIR. The various state laws are not entirely similar to CEQA, as most only apply to public projects (rather than all public actions, like CEQA) and few have as rigorous review standards.\n\nCEQA's broad scope and lack of clear thresholds often lead to litigation, both by groups that support development, and individuals and agencies opposing such development.\n\nCEQA plaintiffs such as community and environmental groups often challenge projects with negative declarations, on the grounds that EIRs should have been carried out. Litigation also occurs on the grounds that EIRs are too brief or overlooked possible impacts, as there are no guidelines for the length or content of the EIRs.\n\nPlaintiffs also sometimes accuse developers of a practice called piece-mealing, by which projects are analyzed incrementally by parts to make the environmental impacts appear smaller to the overseeing agency.\n\nCEQA plaintiffs succeeded on one such claim in June 2009, concerning an expansion of the Chevron Richmond Refinery, the largest employer in Richmond, California. The judge ruled that Chevron erred by defining the project inconsistently, and the city of Richmond erred in allowing Chevron to piece-meal its project, and in allowing Chevron to develop a mitigation plan after the project begins. The judge consequently ruled the EIR to be insufficient to meet CEQA's requirements, ordering the preparation of a new EIR covering the whole, accurately defined project before the refinery's expansion could proceed.\n\nPlaintiffs in CEQA lawsuits seek various forms of redress, such as amending the EIR, preparing a new EIR, agreeing to mitigation measures, or paying money to local agencies to offset environmental impacts.\n\nCEQA lawsuits (and threats of CEQA lawsuits) are frequently used by groups that want to block a proposed project for reasons than its environmental impacts.\n\nCarol Galante, a professor of Affordable Housing and Urban Policy at the Terner Center for Housing Innovation at UC Berkeley, who served in the Obama Administration as the Assistant Secretary at the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD),\n\nstated that “It (CEQA) has been abused in this state for 30 years by people who use it when it has nothing to do with an environmental reason, ... NIMBY-ism is connected to the fact that for everyone who owns their little piece of the dream, there&apos;s no reason to want development next door to them, CEQA gives them a tool to effectuate their interest ... We need to fundamentally rethink how the CEQA process works in this state.\"\n\nCEQA has been used by residents in San Francisco and Los Angeles to attempt to block homeless shelters and affordable housing projects from being located in their neighborhoods.\n\nA 2015 study by Jennifer Hernandez and others at the environmental and land-use law firm Holland & Knight,\n\nlooking at all CEQA lawsuits filed during the three-year period 2010-2012, found that less than 15% were filed by groups with prior records of environmental advocacy. (such as the Sierra Club)\n\nWhile environmental groups largely agree that building dense housing in urban areas (\"infill development\") is better for the environment than converting open space to new homes, 4 out of 5 CEQA lawsuits target infill development projects; only 20% of CEQA lawsuits target \"greenfield\" projects that would convert open space to housing.\nA report by the California Legislative Analyst's Office found that in the state's 10 largest cities, CEQA appeals delayed projects by an average of two and a half years.\n\nCEQA's reqirement that automobile congestion be considered as an \"environmental impact\" that must be mitigated has resulted in the law both preventing the creation of bicycle lanes on already existing streets,\nas well as allowing lawsuits challenging new bike lanes both before and even after they have passed environmental review and been created.\n\nIn one case, anti-abortion activists filed a CEQA lawsuit to try to block a new tenant (Planned Parenthood) from using an already constructed office building in South San Francisco. They cited the noise caused by their own protests as the environmental impact requiring mitigation. This lawsuit delayed the new tenancy by at least 18 months.\n\nLabor unions file CEQA lawsuits against projects to try to force them to pay prevailing wage.\n\nGovernor Jerry Brown, in an interview with UCLA's Blueprint magazine, commented on the use of CEQA for other than environmental reasons: \"But it’s easier to build in Texas. It is. And maybe we could change that. But you know what? The trouble is the political climate, that's just kind of where we are. Very hard to — you can’t change CEQA [the California Environmental Quality Act]. BP: Why not? JB: The unions won’t let you because they use it as a hammer to get project labor agreements.\"\n\n\n\n"}

Originally published in the USA by Alfred A. Knopf (then, a division of Random House), it is currently published by Avon, an imprint of HarperCollins Publishers. It is the story of the Great Gold Robbery of 1855, a massive gold heist, which takes place on a train travelling through Victorian-era England on 22 May 1855. Most of the book takes place in London. A 1978 film adaptation was written for the screen and directed by Michael Crichton.\n\nIn 1854, Edward Pierce, a charismatic and affluent \"cracksman\" or master thief, makes plans to steal a shipment of gold worth more than twelve thousand pounds being transported monthly from London to the Crimean War front. He faces enormous obstacles as the bank has taken strict precautions, including locking the gold in two custom-built safes, each with two locks, thus requiring a total of four keys to open. He recruits Robert Agar, a \"screwsman\" or specialist in copying keys, as an accomplice.\n\nTo ensure his plan's success, Pierce spends more than a year in preparation. His first steps are fairly easy as he uses his wealth and social contacts to procure information on the security measures and locations of the keys. The bank's president, Edgar Trent, and its general manager, Henry Fowler, each possess a key. The other two are locked in a cabinet at the offices of the South Eastern Railway at the London Bridge terminus.\n\nPierce's first target is Edgar Trent's key, but he has no clues or prior information on Trent's habits. Through painstaking surveillance, conversations with bank employees and a deliberately bungled pickpocketing attempt, Pierce deduces that Trent's key is kept at his mansion, but is still unable to learn the exact location. After learning that Trent is keen on ratting (a blood sport involving the betting on dogs killing rats,) Pierce succeeds in becoming acquainted with Trent and while visiting the Trent mansion feigns a romantic interest in Elizabeth Trent, Trent's plain twenty-nine-year-old daughter, who has had few suitors. While pretending to court Elizabeth, Pierce learns that the key is most likely located in the basement wine cellar. With the assistance of his longtime mistress, known only as \"Miss Miriam\" (who is also an actress,) and his loyal associate, a buck cabby named Barlow, Pierce and Agar successfully break into Trent's home and wine cellar by night and make a wax impression of the key.\n\nHenry Fowler contracts syphilis and, too embarrassed to seek medical attention, asks his friend Pierce, as a bachelor and sporting gentleman, to aid him in seeking a remedy: sleeping with a virgin. After supposedly making the necessary arrangements through a madam (actually \"Miss Miriam\") and charging Fowler the exorbitant price of one hundred fifty guineas for a night-time assignation with a twelve-year-old (the legal age of consent) \"fresh,\" Pierce and Agar are able to make an impression of Fowler's key, which he always carries with him around his neck but takes off and leaves with his clothes (at the request of his virgin) during the assignation.\n\nThe most difficult keys to \"wax\" are the two keys at the train station. Pierce plans to copy them at night, but the presence of \"crushers\" (policemen) and \"jacks\" (security guards) forces him to recruit \"Clean Willy\" Williams, a \"snakesman\" or burglar able to slip inside buildings through small and cramped openings, who is currently incarcerated in the high-security and supposedly escape-proof Newgate Prison. Pierce sends a message through Willy's former mistress and assists Willy in escaping from Newgate while the public is distracted by a public execution outside the prison. After nursing Willy back to health from injuries received during the escape, the criminals succeed in making wax copies of the two keys at the railway station, completing the job with only seconds to spare before detection.\n\nNow possessing copies of all four keys, Pierce bribes Burgess, the poorly paid train guard who rides in the baggage van containing the safes. Agar is then able to perform a dry run of the theft on 17 February 1855, making sure that the copied keys work perfectly.\n\nCertain unexpected events over the next few months cause delays. Finally the actual robbery is scheduled for May 22nd, but Pierce's plans are again disrupted when \"Clean Willy\" suddenly turns \"nose\" (police informer). Pierce's cabby Barlow murders Willy before he can reveal the most crucial information, although Willy has told enough to cause Edward Harranby, a very senior Scotland Yard detective, to deduce that a major robbery is planned. Through careful manipulation of a \"blower\" (informant) Pierce diverts the police's attention to an alleged robbery of the transatlantic cable company's payroll in Greenwich, leaving the thieves free and clear to finally strike.\n\nOn the eve of the Great Train Robbery, another unexpected development occurs: a new railway policy requires the baggage van doors to be locked from the outside and prohibits anyone except the guard from riding in the baggage van. Determined not to further delay the theft, Pierce smuggles Agar into the baggage van inside a coffin, then risks his life by climbing across the roof of the train during the journey. He unlocks the door from outside, thus allowing them to drop off the gold at a pre-arranged point. By the next day, much of England is in an uproar upon the discovery of the robbery, with every organisation involved in the gold shipment blaming each other, few leads as to the true culprits and no idea how it was done. The members of the gang drop out of sight.\n\nEighteen months later, Agar's mistress, who has been caught in the act of robbing a drunk, informs on Agar to escape imprisonment. Agar, who has been arrested on an unrelated charge, turns \"nose\" after being threatened by Harranby with transportation to Australia. Pierce and Burgess are arrested at a prize-fighting event in Manchester, and all three are ultimately convicted. Pierce is sentenced to a long prison term, but escapes while being transported from court (presumably arranged by Miss Miriam and Barlow) and disappears.\n\nAfter Pierce's escape, conflicting reports indicate him, Miriam and Barlow spending the rest of their lives living in luxury, reportedly in various foreign cities. Burgess dies of cholera during his short prison term; Agar is transported to Australia, but prospers and passes away a wealthy man in 1902. Edgar Trent dies from a chest ailment in 1857, while Henry Fowler dies from \"unknown causes\" in 1858. Edward Harranby dies in 1879 after being kicked in the head by a horse he had been flogging.\n\nThe final line of the novel reads, \"The money from the Great Train Robbery was never recovered.\"\n\n\nCrichton became aware of the story when lecturing at Cambridge University. He later read the transcripts of the court trial and started researching the historical period.\n\nThe story is a fictionalised representation of the historical events that happened, although the setting can be considered quite accurate. The characters' names are changed in the novel; for example, the main protagonist William Pierce is changed to Edward Pierce and Edward Agar to Robert Agar. Crichton stated that he did not want to be constrained by what actually happened. The true story of the robbery can be found in David C. Hanrahan's book \"The First Great Train Robbery\".\n\nThe \"New York Times\" called it \"Mr Crichton's best thriller to date.\" The \"Los Angeles Times\" described it as \"marvellous fun.\"\n\nThe book was one of the biggest best selling novels in the US in 1975.\n\nThree audiobook versions have been released:\n\nThe novel was later made into a 1979 film entitled \"The First Great Train Robbery\" directed by Crichton starring Sean Connery as Pierce, Donald Sutherland as Agar and Lesley-Anne Down as Miriam. Unlike the real incident, only Pierce is captured and tried and all of the protagonists are seen to escape to freedom after the trial. The film was nominated for Best Cinematography Award for the British Society of Cinematographers, and the film was also nominated for Best Motion Picture by the Edgar Allan Poe award by the Mystery Writers Association of America. The film score by Jerry Goldsmith was short, but a favourite in the composer's repertoire and an extended version of the music was released in 2004.\n"}
{"id": "1833635", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1833635", "title": "Vision of Love", "text": "Vision of Love\n\n\"Vision of Love\" is the debut single by American singer, songwriter and record producer Mariah Carey. Written by Carey and Ben Margulies, \"Vision of Love\" was released as the lead single from Carey's self-titled debut album on May 15, 1990. After being featured on Carey's demo tape for Columbia, the song was re-recorded and produced by Rhett Lawrence and Narada Michael Walden. \"Vision of Love\" features a slow-dance theme tempo and backing vocals sung by Carey herself, and introduces her usage of the whistle register. Lyrically, the song describes both a past and present relationship with a lover: Carey describes the \"vision of love\" she dreamed of, as well as the present love she feels for him.\n\nThe accompanying music video for \"Vision of Love\" was filmed in April 1990. It features Carey in a large cathedral, where she meditates and sings by a large picture window. \"Vision of Love\" was performed on several television and award show ceremonies, such as \"The Arsenio Hall Show\", \"Good Morning America\", and the 33rd Annual Grammy Awards. It has been performed at almost every one of Carey's concerts and tours, and is featured on Carey's live album \"MTV Unplugged\" (1992) and on many of her compilation albums, \"Number 1's\" (1998), \"Greatest Hits\" (2001) and \"The Ballads\" (2008).\n\n\"Vision of Love\" received widespread acclaim from music critics. While the song's production was typical of late 1980s pop, the vocals were not, being much more showy and expressing a wider range than artists popular at the time such as Paula Abdul and Debbie Gibson. It has been credited with popularizing the use of melisma in contemporary popular music and for inspiring several artists to pursue a music career. \"The New Yorker\" named \"Vision of Love\" the \"Magna Carta of melisma\" for its and Carey's influence on pop and R&B singers and \"American Idol\" contestants. Additionally, \"Rolling Stone\" said that \"the fluttering strings of notes that decorate songs like \"Vision of Love,\" inspired the entire \"American Idol\" vocal school, for better or worse, and virtually every other female R&B singer since the nineties.\" The song topped the singles charts in Canada, New Zealand and the United States, where it spent four weeks atop the chart.\n\nThroughout 1986, Carey had already begun writing music while in high school. After composing a song with her friend, Gavin Christopher (of \"Once You Get Started\" fame), Carey met a young drummer and songwriter, Ben Margulies. After initially meeting and becoming friends, the pair began spending time in his father's old studio, writing material and composing new songs. Together, the first song they compiled was titled \"Here We Go Around Again.\" Although the song was Carey's first composition, it was never recorded. As the year wore on, they had composed seven songs for Carey's demo tape; of them was the rough and unfinished version of \"Vision of Love\". In an interview with Fred Bronson, Carey described how she met and came to work with Margulies.\n\n\"We needed someone to play keyboards for a song I did with Gavin Christopher. We called someone and he couldn't come, so by accident we stumbled on Ben. Ben came to the session, and he can't really play keyboards very well-he's really more of a drummer-but after that day, we kept in touch, and we just sort of clicked as writers.\n\nAfter meeting Brenda K. Starr and being introduced to Tommy Mottola, the future head of Sony Music Entertainment, the song was re-done in a professional studio, with the assistance of two producers. Carey flew to Los Angeles to work with Rhett Lawrence, one of the album's main producers. After hearing the original version of the song, Lawrence described it as having a \"'50s sort of shuffle.\" After Carey agreed to alter the song, Lawrence contemporized its tempo. \"Vision of Love\" was recorded at the Skyline Studios in New York, and featured Lawrence behind the keyboard, Margulies on the drums, bassist Marcus Miller, drum programmer Ren Klyce and guitarist Jimmy Ripp. Lawrence took Carey's vocals from the original demo version, and used them as background vocals for the song's final version. After adding different instrumentation to the song, Lawrence and Narada Michael Walden produced \"Vision of Love.\"\n\n\"Vision of Love\" is a love song with pop, gospel, soul and R&B influences. It incorporates heavy backup vocals during the song's bridge and features usage of Carey's whistle register and melisma. Author Chris Nickson described the song and its vocals:\n\n\"['Vision of Love'] was the perfect introduction to her voice. With an ideal slow-dancing tempo, it still managed to swing, with Mariah's background vocals (herself multi-tracked) answering her lead. On the final chorus, her voice flew towards those trademark high notes before the instruments drop out, leaving Mariah to sing her way out to the tune's climax alone.\"\n\"Vision of Love\" is set in common time and in the key of C major. Carey's vocal range spans from the low-note of E to the high whistle note of C. The song's lyrics and melody were written and composed by Carey, with Margulies, Miller, Klyce and Rip on the instrumentals. Lawrence and Walden produced the song, which heavily deviated from its original version on Carey's demo. Michael Slezak from \"Entertainment Weekly\" wrote regarding the song's instrumentation and vocals \"From those opening sci-fi-esque synths to that signature dog-whistle high note, Mariah's very first single is inspired: Even folks who object to her trademark vocal excesses are hard-pressed to fault this rousing, gospel-tinged song about finding 'the one that I needed.'\"\n\nThe song's lyrics have been subject to various interpretations and suggested relationships by critics. Some have noted the relationship between Carey and God, while others point out one with a lover. Carey has yielded to both, while claiming them to have a connection to her childhood and to obstacles encountered while growing up. Michael Slezak wrote \"Though it's not clear if she's celebrating a secular love or her relationship with a higher power, this exuberant ballad is a near-religious listening experience.\" In an interview with \"Ebony\" in 1991, Carey spoke of the song's lyrics and success.\n\n\"Consider the lyrics: Prayed through the nights / Felt so alone / Suffered from alienation / Carried the weight on my own / Had to be strong / So I believed / And now I know I've succeeded / In finding the place I conceived. Well, just because you are young doesn't mean that you haven't had a hard life. It's been difficult for me, moving around so much, having to grow up by myself, basically on my own, my parents divorced. And I always felt kind of different from everyone else in my neighborhoods. I was a different person – ethnically. And sometimes that can be a problem. If you look a certain way everybody goes, 'White girl,' and I'd go, 'No, that's not what I am.'\"\n\nAccording to Nickson, Carey chose to express her innermost feelings in her songs rather than becoming depressed and bitter throughout the hardships in her life. \"You really have to look inside yourself and find your own inner strength, and say, `I'm proud of what I am and who I am, and I'm just going to be myself.\"\n\n\"Vision of Love\" received widespread acclaim from music critics for its lyrical content as well as Carey's vocals and use of melisma. Bill Lamb from About.com noted that \"echoes of Whitney Houston's influence are evident, but the sheer power and swooping highs are all Mariah's own.\" \"Billboard\" described the song as a \"velvety stunner\" and a \"retro-flavored pop/R&B ballad\" and noted further that it \"has all the elements necessary to propel newcomer to diva status: infectious melodies, lush instrumentation, and a vocal performance brimming with unbridled power and confidence.\" In a retrospective review on the album in 2005, \"Entertainment Weekly\" called the song \"inspired\" and complimented Carey's use of the whistle register in the song. \"The Network Forty\" commented, \"When this one comes on the air, you better stand clear of your speakers. Her voice will blow you away!\" \"Orlando Sentinel\" described the song as a \"1950s-styled ballad\". In 2006, Sasha Frere-Jones from \"The New Yorker\" named the song \"the Magna Carta of melisma\" for both the song's and Carey's influence on pop and R&B singers and \"American Idol\" contestants. Additionally, \"Rolling Stone\" said that \"the fluttering strings of notes that decorate songs like \"Vision of Love,\" inspired the entire \"American Idol\" vocal school, for better or worse, and virtually every other female R&B singer since the nineties.\" Slant Magazine critic Rich Juzwiak, wrote \"I think [\"Vision of Love\"] was a vision of the future world of \"American Idol\".\" In a separate review from \"Slant\", Juzwiak wrote, \"The last half of \"Vision Of Love\" (starting with the belted bridge) is a series of crescendos that get so intense that another Mariah has to step in to keep up the momentum.\" Juzwiak also complimented the usage of the whistle register in the song \"And then there's the whistle note. And then there's the final vocal run that's more like a roller-coaster track. If you think these aren't climaxes, she proves you wrong with her denouement, the way the last word, \"be,\" sort of wanes into an \"mm hmm hmm.\" Bill Lamb from About.com said that \"'Vision of Love' is one of the best songs of Mariah's recording career [...] It is simply one of the most stunning debut releases ever by a pop recording artist.\"\n\nIn the United States, \"Vision of Love\" entered the US \"Billboard\" Hot 100 at #73 during the week of June 2, 1990, and reached the chart's summit nine weeks later. The song remained atop the chart for four consecutive weeks, and was ranked sixth on the Hot 100 year-end chart. After four weeks at number one, it fell to number eight, and spent seven weeks lingering in the top ten. It also topped the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs for two weeks and Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks for three weeks. In October 2019, the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) certified the song platinum, denoting shipments of over 1,000,000 units. In Canada, \"Vision of Love\" entered the Canadian \"RPM\" Singles Chart at number 75, during the week of July 7, 1990. In its eighth week on the chart, the song reached number one and remained on the chart a total of 17 weeks. \"Vision of Love\" finished eighth on the Top 100 Hit Tracks of 1990. \"Vision of Love\" entered the Australian Singles Chart at number 67 during the week of August 5, 1990. It peaked at number nine, and spent a total of 19 weeks in the top 100. The Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) certified the song gold, denoting shipments of over 35,000 units.\n\nIn the Netherlands, the song entered the singles chart at number 99, during the week of July 14. It spent a total of 17 weeks in the chart, spending two weeks at its peak position of number eight. \"Vision of Love\" entered the French Singles Chart at number 39 on November 11, 1990. It peaked at number 25, spending two weeks at the position and a total of 14 on the chart. In Ireland, the song peaked at number ten, and spent six weeks in the singles chart. \"Vision of Love\" topped the chart in New Zealand, spending two consecutive weeks atop the singles chart. After fluctuating for 24 weeks in the chart, the song was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of New Zealand (RIANZ), denoting shipments of over 7,500 units. In the United Kingdom, the song entered the UK Singles Chart at number 74, during the week of August 4, 1990. \"Vision of Love\" peaked at number nine in its seventh week, and spent a total of 12 weeks in the chart. According to Official Charts Company, sales in the UK are estimated at 198,000 combined sales.\n\nAfter completing the album, Sony hired Bojan Bazelli to direct the song's music video. After filming the video's first version, record label executives felt the result was sub-par in comparison to the quality of the music. They scrapped the first video and re-filmed it with director Andy Morahan, changing the plot, scenery and imagery. After word got out of the two videos, a Sony employee spoke to the press about Carey, saying how \"the special treatment really upset\" him. He felt they treated Carey differently from how they would another artist signed to the label, and that they viewed her as a higher priority. He also claimed that Carey was the reason they re-filmed, \"they spend $200,000 on a video and Mariah doesn't like it. No big deal.\" Another employee estimated the figure of both videos at over $450,000. After the reports were made, Don Ienner, the president of Sony, refuted the claims, calling them \"total bullshit\" although admitting, \"If we're going to take the time and effort that we did with Mariah, on every level, then we're going to image her the right way. If it costs a few extra dollars to make a splash in terms of the right imaging, you go ahead and do it.\"\n\nThe video takes place in a large cathedral-like room, with large winding staircases on each side. Throughout the video, the scenery changes several times from a cloudy and sunny day, to a glowing sunset. These time shifts are seen through a large carved window in the cathedral. The video begins with Carey's hair in long golden curls, and her wearing a skin-tight black jumper. She sits on the large ledge by the window, staring into the different colors in the sky. As the video progresses, Carey is joined by a small black cat, which accompanies her as she meditates on the large stairwell. After the song's second verse, a large microphone is seen in the middle of the room, where scenes of Carey singing and standing on the window's ledge interchange. The last scenes show Carey staring out into the meadow, smiling. According to author Chris Nickson, during the scenes of Carey by the large window, it is \"obvious\" that she is praying to God and connecting to her creator. He felt that alongside the song's lyrics of faith and prayer, the video's moments of meditation truly went \"hand in hand.\"\n\nServing as her debut single, Carey performed \"Vision of Love\" on several live television and award show appearances, both stateside and throughout Europe. Carey's first live performance of the song was on \"The Arsenio Hall Show\", where she was joined on stage by the Billie T. Scott Ensemble, a trio of male background vocalists. Additionally, she sang it during a televised appearance at New York City's TATU Club, where she also gave a live rendition of Ben E. King's \"Don't Play That Song (You Lied)\". As part of a live segment and interview, Carey appeared on \"Good Morning America\" in July 1990, where she gave a live performance of the song. In the further months, Carey performed the song live on \"The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson\", \"The Oprah Winfrey Show\" and the 33rd Annual Grammy Awards. In Europe, Carey performed \"Vision of Love\" on \"Wogan\" in the United Kingdom, and \"Sacrée Soirée\" and \"Le Monde Est A Vous\" in France. In 1992, Carey performed the song on \"MTV Unplugged\". It was released on her EP and home video that same year, as \"MTV Unplugged\" and \"MTV Unplugged +3\" respectively. In July 1993, Carey recorded a live concert performance at \"Proctor's Theatre\" which included \"Vision of Love\". It was taped and released as \"Here Is Mariah Carey\" in December 1993. Additionally, the song was part of a four-song set-list on BET's \"Blueprint\", where Carey performed in July 2005.\n\n\"Vision of Love\" was performed on several of Carey's tours and concert shows. It was first featured on her Music Box Tour, her first full-length stateside tour. For the song's performances, Carey donned a large black trench coat, with matching pants and leather boots. She featured her signature curly locks, and was joined by Trey Lorenz, Melonie Daniels and Kelly Price. On her 1996 Daydream World Tour, Carey once again included the song on the tour's set-list. During her shows at the Tokyo Dome in Tokyo, Japan, Carey donned a long black gown, with teased up straightened hair and a matching head-band. For the European leg on the tour, Carey wore a long white gown, and was joined by additional background vocalists. Carey included the song on her set-list for her Butterfly World Tour (1998), where she once again featured the same trio of supporting singers. For the show's performances, she donned a sheer and beige mini-dress, with long and wavy golden hair. Additionally, she wore a cream-colored long-sleeve sheer sweater with matching high-heeled sandals. \"Vision of Love\" was included on Carey's Rainbow World Tour in 2000, as well as the (2002–03), The Elusive Chanteuse Show (2014) and Caution World Tour (2019). During The Adventures of Mimi Tour in 2006, Carey performed the song at select shows. For the performances of the song, she donned a long yellow cocktail gown and black Christian Louboutin pumps. Once again Lorenz was featured on stage, however with the addition of two different female back-up singers, MaryAnn and Sherry Tatum. Carey also performed the song at the 2015 Billboard Music Awards along with Infinity to promote her number 1 \"To Infinity\" album. Carey also included the song in her Las Vegas residency, \"Mariah Carey Number 1's\", a chronicle of her 18 US number 1 hits. The song was first in the chronological setlist, and for the performance Carey donned a black sequined gown, and her signature curls. Carey also included the song during the first two legs of her Las Vegas residency, The Butterfly Returns (2018).\n\n\"Vision of Love\" was nominated for three Grammy Awards at the 33rd annual ceremony, held on February 20, 1991: Record of the Year, Song of the Year and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance, winning the latter. Additionally, the song received the Soul Train Music Award for Best R&B/Soul Single, Female and a Song of the Year Award at the BMI Pop Awards. Devon Powers from Popmatters has stated during the release of Carey's \"Greatest Hits\" album that \"Mariah's Greatest Hits moves chronologically through that remarkable career, beginning with “Vision of Love”, the 1990 single that introduced the singer to instant stardom. Still, after so many years and songs, it’s by far among her best, if not the best—a simple testament to the incredible pipes that gave her a permanent place in pop cultural memory.\" Powers added that \"From its first moments, the song demands to be legendary—a gong crash smolders low as Mariah’s gospel-inspired vocals hum confidently, grandly.\"\n\nVH1 named \"Vision of Love\" the 14th greatest song of the 1990s. About.com ranked it fourth on its top ten pop hits of 1990 list and 28th on its top 100 pop songs of the 1990s list. \"Entertainment Weekly\" included it on their \"10 Great (and 10 Grating) Karaoke Songs\" list as a grating karaoke song, saying: \"You cannot do this song. Seriously. Tackling this lung-crusher might seem like a fun challenge, but three minutes, five octaves, and one 10-second note later, you will realize that you did not conquer 'Vision of Love.' 'Vision of Love' conquered you.\" \"USA Today\" critic Elysa Gardner picked \"Vision of Love\" as one of the most intriguing tracks, saying that it is still Mariah's best song. T. Field and a research team discovered that \"Vision of Love\" is one of the songs that has physiological and biochemical effects on depressed female adolescents. R&B singer Beyoncé said that she began doing vocal \"runs\" after listening to \"Vision of Love\" for the first time. Similarly, pop singers Rihanna and Christina Aguilera cited the song and Carey as big influences in her career as a singer. In an interview during the early stages of her career, Aguilera said \"I've totally looked up to Mariah since 'Vision of Love' came out.\" Kelly Clarkson also cited \"Vision of Love\" as an influence on her singing career after performing the song on her first choir solo performance as a kid.\n\nThe song was featured in a late 1990 episode of the daytime soap opera \"All My Children\" as well as 1991 episodes of \"Santa Barbara\" and \"The Young and the Restless\".\n\n\nCredits adapted from the \"Mariah Carey\" linear notes.\n\n"}

He was inspired to write \"Electronic Life\" because so many of his friends would call him asking for advice on computers.\n\nThe book was intended to introduce the idea of personal computers to a reader who might be faced with them at work or at home for the first time. It defined basic jargon and assured readers that they could master the machine when it inevitably arrived.\n\n\"Electronic Life\" is written as a glossary, with entries like \"Afraid of Computers (everybody is)\", \"Buying a Computer\", and \"Computer Crime\". Entries consist mainly of Crichton's musings on these topics, and few of the entries reflect any research. The computer crime entry, for example, is three pages long and contains only four hard facts—specifically, that institutions were then losing $5 billion to $30 billion a year on computer crime, that Citibank processed $30 billion a day in customer transactions using computers, that American banks as a whole were moving $400 billion a year in the U.S., and that the Stanford public key code (not otherwise described) had been broken in 1982. No examples of computer crime are given, though by 1983 such accounts were appearing in the mainstream press, and dedicated books on the topic had been around for at least a decade.\n\nSome portions of the book are dated. On page 140, Crichton points out that if you ask your computer to compute 5.01*5.02-5.03/2.04*100.5+3.06+20.07-200.08+300.09/1.10, there will be a noticeable delay as it works out the answer. Later he suggests that a user would do well to buy a CP/M-based system, because of all the excellent applications for that platform.\n\nIn the book, Crichton correctly predicts that computer networks would increase in importance. He saw this as a matter of convenience—computers can share pictures, which you can't do with a verbal phone call, and computer networks can operate asynchronously, so you can leave information for somebody and have them pick it up at their convenience.\n\nHe also comments on games that are played on computers, saying \"Arcade games are the hula hoops of the '80s, and already there are indications that the mania for twitch games (another name for arcade games) may be fading... However, unlike hula hoops, the present generation of computer games represents a transitional phenomenon on the way to a permanent alteration of our world. Computers are the most compelling toy ever invented ... Ever more elaborate and challenging games will be played on computers in the future. Why not? It's a way of making friends with the machine.\"\n\nIn a section called \"Microprocessors, or how I flunked biostatistics at Harvard,\" Crichton lashes out at a medical school teacher who had given him a 'D' fifteen years earlier.\n\nJerry Pournelle named \"Electronic Life\" as his \"book of the month\" in \"BYTE\" in June 1985, writing that \"Dr. Crichton has managed to pack a great deal of useful information, philosophy, and common sense into 250+ pages. Recommended for almost everyone; even experienced hackers will find parts interesting and can then keep the book around to lend to beginners\".\n\n"}

It was originally discovered by Albert Hofmann but was not widely studied until the rise in popularity of psychedelics in the 1960s.\n\nIn Entry 26 of his compendium \"TiHKAL\", which discussed LSD, chemist Alexander Shulgin touched briefly on the subject of ALD-52. His comments there are vague, second-hand accounts saying doses in the 50–175 µg range have resulted in various conclusions. One account found that there was less visual distortion than with LSD and it seemed to produce less anxiety and tenseness and that it was somewhat less potent. Another informant claimed it was more effective in increasing blood pressure. Yet another informant could not tell them apart.\n\nIn \"The Hallucinogens\" by Hoffer and Osmond (1967), ALD-52 is listed as having a lower (approximately /) \"intravenous\" toxicity (in rabbits), a lower (approximately /) pyretogenic effect, an equal psychological effect in humans, and double the \"antiserotonin\" effect as compared with LSD. Human experiments have not been well documented.\n\nThe Orange Sunshine variety of LSD that was widely available in California through 1968 and 1969 was produced in the Sonoma County underground chemistry lab of Tim Scully and Nicholas Sand. It was shut down by the police, and Scully was arrested and prosecuted. This resulted in the first drug analogue trial, where Scully claimed that he and his partners did nothing illegal, because they were producing ALD-52, which was not an illicit drug. However, as the prosecution claimed, there were problems with such a rationale—ALD-52 was claimed to readily undergo hydrolysis to LSD, and secondly, the synthesis of ALD-52 required LSD. (The second point was based on the methods available in the scientific literature at the time). Scully was convicted and served time in prison.\n\nTim Scully has confirmed that the speculation above is incorrect. In a Reddit AMA with the director of the movie The Sunshine Makers, he says \"The Orange Sunshine we delivered was LSD 25. ALD 52 was an ill-advised desperate defense strategy that failed miserably... The story of Orange Sunshine is complicated by the fact that The Brotherhood distributed LSD from more than one manufacturer as Orange Sunshine. \"Nick and I made the original Orange Sunshine in Windsor. That was the last lab I worked in making LSD. Ron Stark managed several LSD labs in Europe and most of his output was tableted and sold as Orange Sunshine. At least some of the LSD that his labs made was not pure.\"\n\nALD-52 is technically not illegal but it may fall in the NPSG (Neue-Psychoaktive-Substanzen-Gesetz Österreich) as an analogue of LSD\n\nALD-52 is not listed as an illegal substance in Denmark as of April, 2019, and its chemical class 'lysergamide' is not banned under the Analogue Act (Some LSD analogues are, however, prohibited).\n\nALD-52 is controlled under the NpSG as of July 18, 2019. Production and import with the aim to place it on the market, administration to another person and trading is punishable. Possession is illegal but not penalized.\n\nALD-52 is illegal in Latvia. Although it isn't officially scheduled, it is controlled as an LSD structural analog due to an amendment made on June 1, 2015.\n\n1P-LSD is illegal to produce or sell in Romania. It is not included directly in the list of controlled substances, but it is included in an analogue act. However, it is not, as of yet, classified as illegal to use.\n\nALD-52 is a class A controlled drug, and is illegal to traffic, manufacture, import, export, possess, or consume in Singapore as of December 1, 2019, punishable with a minimum of five years’ imprisonment and five strokes of the cane.\n\nSince March 2018, ALD-52 is illegal in Switzerland and has been put in the RS 812.121.11.\n\nOn June 10, 2014 the UK Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD) recommended that ALD-52 be specifically named in the UK Misuse of Drugs Act as a class A drug despite not identifying it as ever having been sold or any harm associated with its use. The UK Home office accepted this advice and announced a ban of the substance to be enacted on 6 January 2015 as part of The Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 (Amendment) (No. 2) Order 2014.\n\nALD-52 is unscheduled in the United States. It may be considered an analogue of LSD, a Schedule I drug under the Controlled Substances Act. As such, the sale for human consumption or the use for illicit non-medical or scientific research could be prosecuted as crimes under the Federal Analogue Act.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1833648", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1833648", "title": "Āgama (Buddhism)", "text": "Āgama (Buddhism)\n\nIn Buddhism, an āgama (आगम Sanskrit and Pāli for \"sacred work\" or \"scripture\") is a collection of Early Buddhist Texts. \n\nThe five āgamas together comprise the \"Suttapiṭaka\" of the early Buddhist schools, which had different recensions of each āgama. In the Pali Canon of the Theravada, the term \"nikāya\" is used. The word \"āgama\" does not occur in this collection.\n\nIn Buddhism, the term \"āgama\" is used to refer to a collection of discourses (Sanskrit: \"sutra\"; Pali: \"sutta\") of the early Buddhist schools, which were preserved primarily in Chinese translation, with substantial material also surviving in Prakrit/Sanskrit and lesser but still significant amounts surviving in Gāndhārī and in Tibetan translation. These sutras correspond to the first four \"Nikāyas\" (and parts of the fifth) of the Sutta-Pitaka of the Pali Canon, which are also occasionally called āgamas. In this sense, \"āgama\" is a synonym for one of the meanings of \"nikāya\". The content of both collections, the \"āgama\", here: Northern Collection, and the \"nikāya\", here: Southern Collection, are dissimilar to an extent. Large parts of the \"Anguttara nikāya\" and \"Samyutta nikāya\" do not occur in the \"āgama\", and several \"sutras/suttas\" are dissimilar in content.\n\nSometimes the word \"āgama\" is used to refer not to a specific scripture, but to a class of scripture. In this case, its meaning can also encompass the \"Sutta-pitaka\", which the Theravada tradition holds to be the oldest and most historically accurate representation of the teachings of Gautama Buddha, together with the Vinaya-pitaka.\n\nIn the 4th century Mahāyāna abhidharma work \"Abhidharmasamuccaya\", Āsaṅga refers to the collection which contains the Prakrit/Sanskrit āgamas as the \"Śrāvakapiṭaka\", and associates it with the śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas. Āsaṅga classifies the Mahāyāna sūtras as belonging to the \"Bodhisattvapiṭaka\", which is designated as the collection of teachings for bodhisattvas.\n\nJens-Uwe Hartmann writes,\n\nIt is clear that, among the early schools, at a minimum the Sarvāstivāda, Kāśyapīya, Mahāsāṃghika, and Dharmaguptaka had recensions of four of the five Prakrit/Sanskrit āgamas that differed. The āgamas have been compared to the Pali Canon's nikāyas by contemporary scholars in an attempt to identify possible changes and root phrasings, see Akanuma's comparative work. The āgamas' existence and similarity to the Sutta Pitaka are sometimes used by scholars to assess to what degree these teachings are a historically authentic representation of the Canon of Early Buddhism. Sometimes also the differences between them are used to suggest an alternative meaning to the accepted meaning of a sutta in either of the two recensions.\n\nThere are four extant collections of āgamas, and one for which we have only references and fragments (the Kṣudrakāgama). The four extant collections are preserved in their entirety only in Chinese translation (āgama: 阿含經), although small portions of all four have recently been discovered in Sanskrit, and portions of four of the five āgamas are preserved in Tibetan. The five Āgamas are:\n\nThe Dīrgha Āgama (\"Long Discourses,\" \"Cháng Ahánjīng\" 長阿含經 Taishō 1) corresponds to the Dīgha Nikāya of the Theravada school. A complete version of the Dīrgha Āgama of the Dharmaguptaka (法藏部) school was done by Buddhayaśas (佛陀耶舍) and Zhu Fonian (竺佛念) in the Late Qin dynasty (後秦), dated to 413 CE. It contains 30 sūtras in contrast to the 34 suttas of the Theravadin Dīgha Nikāya. A \"very substantial\" portion of the Sarvāstivādin Dīrgha Āgama survives in Sanskrit, and portions survive in Tibetan translation.\n\nThe Madhyama Āgama ( \"Middle-length Discourses\") corresponds to the Majjhima Nikāya of the Theravada school. A complete translation of the Madhyama Āgama of the Sarvāstivāda school was done by Saṃghadeva () in the Eastern Jin dynasty in 397-398 CE. The Madhyama Āgama of the Sarvāstivāda school contains 222 sūtras, in contrast to the 152 suttas of the Pāli Majjhima Nikāya. Portions of the Sarvāstivāda Madhyama Āgama also survive in Tibetan translation.\n\nThe Saṃyukta Āgama (\"Connected Discourses\", \"Zá Ahánjīng\" 雜阿含經 Taishō 2.99) corresponds to the Saṃyutta Nikāya of the Theravada school. A Chinese translation of the complete Saṃyukta Āgama of the Sarvāstivāda (說一切有部) school was done by Guṇabhadra (求那跋陀羅) in the Song state (宋), dated to 435-443 CE. Portions of the Sarvāstivāda Saṃyukta Āgama also survive in Sanskrit and Tibetan translation. In 2014,The Collation and Annotation of Saṃyuktāgama（《<雜阿含經>校釋》, Chinese version）, written by Wang Jianwei and Jin Hui, was published in China.\n\nThere is also an incomplete Chinese translation of the Saṃyukta Āgama (別譯雜阿含經 Taishō 100) of the Kāśyapīya (飲光部) school by an unknown translator, from around the Three Qin (三秦) period, 352-431 CE. A comparison of the Sarvāstivādin, Kāśyapīya, and Theravadin texts reveals a considerable consistency of content, although each recension contains texts not found in the others.\n\nThe Ekottara Āgama (\"Numbered Discourses,\" \"Zēngyī Ahánjīng\", 增壹阿含經 Taishō 125) corresponds to the Anguttara Nikāya of the Theravada school. A complete version of the Ekottara Āgama was translated by Dharmanandi (曇摩難提) of the Fu Qin state (苻秦), and edited by Gautama Saṃghadeva in 397–398 CE. Some believed that it came from the Sarvāstivāda school, but more recently the Mahāsāṃghika branch has been proposed as well. According to A.K. Warder, the Ekottara Āgama references 250 Prātimokṣa rules for monks, which agrees only with the Dharmaguptaka Vinaya, which is also located in the Chinese Buddhist canon. He also views some of the doctrine as contradicting tenets of the Mahāsāṃghika school, and states that they agree with Dharmaguptaka views currently known. He therefore concludes that the extant Ekottara Āgama is that of the Dharmaguptaka school.\n\nOf the four Āgamas of the Sanskritic Sūtra Piṭaka in the Chinese Buddhist Canon, it is the one which differs most from the Theravādin version. The Ekottara Āgama contains variants on such standard teachings as the Noble Eightfold Path. According to Keown, \"there is considerable disparity between the Pāli and the [Chinese] versions, with more than two-thirds of the sūtras found in one but not the other compilation, which suggests that much of this portion of the Sūtra Piṭaka was not formed until a fairly late date.\"\n\nThe Kṣudraka Āgama (\"Minor Collection\") corresponds to the Khuddaka Nikāya, and existed in some schools. The Dharmaguptaka in particular, had a Kṣudraka Āgama. The Chinese translation of the Dharmaguptaka Vinaya provides a table of contents for the Dharmaguptaka recension of the Kṣudraka Āgama, and fragments in Gandhari appear to have been found. Items from this Āgama also survive in Tibetan and Chinese translation—fourteen texts, in the later case. Some schools, notably the Sarvāstivāda, recognized only four Āgamas—they had a \"Kṣudraka\" which they did not consider to be an \"Āgama.\" Others—including even the Dharmaguptaka, according to some contemporary scholars—preferred to term it a \"\"Kṣudraka Piṭaka.\" As with its Pāḷi counterpart, the Kṣudraka Āgama appears to have been a miscellany, and was perhaps never definitively established among many early schools.\n\nIn addition, there is a substantial quantity of āgama-style texts outside of the main collections. These are found in various sources:\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1833652", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1833652", "title": "Gustav Leonhardt", "text": "Gustav Leonhardt\n\nGustav Leonhardt (30 May 1928 16 January 2012) was a Dutch keyboard player, conductor, musicologist, teacher and editor. He was a leading figure in the movement to perform music on period instruments. Leonhardt professionally played many instruments, including the harpsichord, pipe organ, claviorganum (a combination of harpsichord and organ), clavichord, fortepiano and piano. He also conducted orchestras and choruses.\n\nGustav Leonhardt was born in 's-Graveland, North Holland and studied organ and harpsichord from 1947 to 1950 with Eduard Müller at the Schola Cantorum Basiliensis in Basel. In 1950, he made his debut as a harpsichordist in Vienna, where he studied musicology. He was professor of harpsichord at the Academy of Music from 1952 to 1955 and at the Amsterdam Conservatory from 1954. He was also a church organist.\n\nLeonhardt performed and conducted a variety of solo, chamber, orchestral, operatic, and choral music from the Renaissance, Baroque and Classical periods. The many composers whose music he recorded as a harpsichordist, organist, clavichordist, fortepianist, chamber musician or conductor included Johann Sebastian Bach, Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach, Wilhelm Friedemann Bach, Heinrich Biber, John Blow, Georg Böhm, William Byrd, André Campra, François Couperin, Louis Couperin, John Dowland, Jacques Duphly, Antoine Forqueray, Girolamo Frescobaldi, Johann Jakob Froberger, Orlando Gibbons, André Grétry, George Frideric Handel, Jacques-Martin Hotteterre, Jean-Baptiste Lully, Claudio Monteverdi, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Georg Muffat, Johann Pachelbel, Henry Purcell, Jean-Philippe Rameau, Christian Ritter, Johann Rosenmüller, Domenico Scarlatti, Agostino Steffani, Jan Pieterszoon Sweelinck, Georg Philipp Telemann, Francisco Valls, Antonio Vivaldi, and Matthias Weckmann.\n\nCentral to Leonhardt's career was Johann Sebastian Bach. Leonhardt first recorded music of the composer in the early 1950s, with recordings in 1953 of the \"Goldberg Variations\" and \"The Art of Fugue\". The latter embodies the thesis he had published the previous year arguing that the work was intended for the keyboard, a conclusion now widely accepted. The recordings helped establish his reputation as a distinguished harpsichordist and Bach interpreter. In 1954 he led the Leonhardt Baroque Ensemble with the English countertenor Alfred Deller in a pioneering recording of two Bach cantatas. The Ensemble included his wife Marie Leonhardt (born 1928), Eduard Melkus (violins), Alice Harnoncourt-Hoffelner (violin, viola), Nikolaus Harnoncourt (cello) and Michel Piguet (oboe).\n\nIn 1971, Leonhardt and Harnoncourt undertook the project of recording the complete Bach cantatas; the two conductors divided up the cantatas and recorded their assigned cantatas with their own ensembles. The project, the first cycle on period instruments, ended up taking nineteen years, from 1971 to 1990. In addition, Leonhardt recorded Bach's \"St Matthew Passion\", \"Mass in B minor\", Magnificat, and the complete secular cantatas, as well as the harpsichord concertos, Brandenburg concertos, and most of his chamber and keyboard music; he recorded Bach's \"Goldberg Variations\" (three times), Partitas (twice), \"The Art of Fugue\" (twice), \"The Well-Tempered Clavier\", French Suites, English Suites (twice), Inventions and Sinfonias, and many other individual works for the harpsichord, clavichord, or organ. To the surprise of some of his associates, Leonhardt accepted the role of Johann Sebastian Bach (played in a wig) in \"The Chronicle of Anna Magdalena Bach\", a 1968 film by Jean-Marie Straub and Danièle Huillet.\n\nThe keyboardist, conductor and scholar John Butt said, \"...there’s absolutely no doubting the enormous influence [Leonhardt] held over multiple generations of music making in the Baroque field\"; in this discussion, Butt spoke of how much he learned from Leonhardt when preparing a chorus for him in the early 1990s. More generally, Leonhardt significantly influenced the technique and style of many harpsichordists through his teaching, editions, and recordings; his students and collaborators included harpsichordists and keyboard players such as Robert Hill, Bob van Asperen, John Butt, Lucy Carolan, Lisa Crawford, Alan Curtis, Richard Egarr, John Fesperman, John Gibbons, Pierre Hantaï, Frederick Renz, Elaine Thornburgh, Ketil Haugsand, Siebe Henstra, Philippe Herreweghe, Christopher Hogwood, Ton Koopman, Karyl Louwenaar, Charlotte Mattax, Davitt Moroney, Jacques Ogg, Martin Pearlman (Music Director of Boston Baroque), Edward Parmentier, Christophe Rousset, Andreas Staier, Skip Sempé, Domenico Morgante, Peter Waldner, Francesco Cera, Jeannette Sorrell (Music Director of Apollo's Fire, The Cleveland Baroque Orchestra), Colin Tilney, and Glen Wilson\n\nButt argues that Leonhardt's influence is not necessarily a simple, direct matter, but that some of his students consciously or unconsciously tried to play differently than he did. In comparing recordings of Bach's Goldberg Variations, Butt asserts that a \"classic case\" of the anxiety of influence is at work in the Goldberg recording by Ton Koopman, in which \"what is immediately evident is the incessant ornamentation added to virtually every measure, often regardless of whether there is already obvious ornamentation in the notation... my immediate reaction is often that this performance's principal message is 'Not Leonhardt'.\" Similarly, he says that \"Bob van Asperen takes [Leonhardt's] rhythmic subtlety to a new extreme and perhaps presents the most rhythmically nuanced account of the work [The Goldberg Variations], one that will be ideal to some and mannered to others.\" By contrast, Butt argues, the younger Christophe Rousset plays the Goldberg Variations in a \"meat-and-potatoes\" manner with \"a steady rhythm, even articulation, and a matter-of-fact presentation with little extra ornamentation,\" demonstrating that \"certainly Rousset does not seem to count among the 'radical reactivists' [to Leonhardt] such as Koopman and van Asperen.\"\n\nLeonhardt served as a member of the jury for the triennial International Harpsichord Concours of the Musica Antiqua Bruges. He was the only jury member who had participated in all sixteen juries from 1965 to 2010.\n\nAmong the awards given to him were the Medal of Honour for the Arts and Sciences from the Netherlands, presented to him by Queen Beatrix in 2009, and the 1980 Erasmus Prize, which he shared with Nicolaus Harnoncourt; it honored their recording of the complete Bach cantatas. (Leonhardt donated the money he received from the Erasmus Prize to Oudeszijds 100, an ecumenical Christian charity operating \"in the red-light district [of] Amsterdam\" that \"addresses the issues of drug-addicts, prostitutes, refugees, and the homeless.\"). Leonhardt was doctor honoris causa of the universities of Dallas, Amsterdam, Harvard, Metz and Padua. In 2007 he was made Commander of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres in France and in 2008 Commander of the Order of the Crown in Belgium.\n\nLeonhardt gave his last public performance on 12 December 2011 at the Théâtre des Bouffes du Nord in Paris. Thereafter he announced his retirement due to illness and cancelled all of his 2012 engagements. He died in Amsterdam on Monday, 16 January 2012, aged 83.\n\nTwo asteroids were named after him: 9903 Leonhardt and 12637 Gustavleonhardt.\n\nGustav Leonhardt lived in a canal house on the Herengracht dating from about 1617, the , and was a collector of decorative arts, paintings, and engravings. In 2014, his collection was auctioned by Sotheby's. His instruments were sold to a few former students, including Skip Sempé and Pierre Hantaï.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1833654", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1833654", "title": "Diverging diamond interchange", "text": "Diverging diamond interchange\n\nA diverging diamond interchange (DDI), also called a double crossover diamond interchange (DCD), is a type of diamond interchange in which the two directions of traffic on the non-freeway road cross to the opposite side on both sides of the bridge at the freeway. It is unusual in that it requires traffic on the freeway overpass (or underpass) to briefly drive on the opposite side of the road from what is customary for the jurisdiction. The crossover \"X\" sections can either be traffic-light intersections or one-side overpasses to travel above the opposite lanes without stopping, to allow nonstop traffic flow when relatively sparse traffic.\n\nLike the continuous flow intersection, the diverging diamond interchange allows for two-phase operation at all signalized intersections within the interchange. This is a significant improvement in safety, since no long turns (e.g. left turns where traffic drives on the right side of the road) must clear opposing traffic and all movements are discrete, with most controlled by traffic signals. Its at-grade variant can be seen as a two-leg continuous flow intersection.\n\nAdditionally, the design can improve the efficiency of an interchange, as the lost time for various phases in the cycle can be redistributed as green time—there are only two clearance intervals (the time for traffic signals to change from green to yellow to red) instead of the six or more found in other interchange designs.\n\nA diverging diamond can be constructed for limited cost, at an existing straight-line bridge, by building crisscross intersections outside the bridge ramps to switch traffic lanes before entering the bridge. The switchover lanes, each with 2 side ramps, introduce a new risk of drivers turning onto an empty, wrong-way, do-not-enter, exit lane and driving the wrong way down a freeway exit ramp to confront high-speed, oncoming traffic. Studies have analyzed various roadsigns to reduce similar driver errors.\n\nDiverging diamond roads have been used in France since the 1970s. However, the diverging diamond interchange was listed by \"Popular Science\" magazine as one of the best innovations in 2009 (engineering category) in \"Best of What's New 2009\".\n\nThe design also is promoted as part of the Federal Highway Administration's Every Day Counts initiative which started in 2011.\n\nPrior to 2009 the only known diverging diamond interchanges were in France in the communities of Versailles (A13 at D182), Le Perreux-sur-Marne (A4 at N486) and Seclin (A1 at D549), all built in the 1970s. (The ramps of the first two have been reconfigured to accommodate ramps of other interchanges, but they continue to function as diverging diamond interchanges.)\n\nDespite the fact that such interchanges already existed, the idea for the DDI was \"reinvented\" around 2000, inspired by the former \"synchronized split-phasing\" type freeway-to-freeway interchanges. Examples of this type of interchange include the intersection of Interstate 95 and I-695 north of Baltimore (since reconfigured), and the intersection of I-20/59 and Interstate 65 in Birmingham, Alabama.\n\nIn 2005, the Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) considered reconfiguring the existing interchange on Interstate 75 at U.S. Route 224 and State Route 15 west of Findlay as a diverging diamond interchange to improve traffic flow. Had it been constructed, it would have been the first DDI in the United States. By 2006, ODOT had reconsidered, instead adding lanes to the existing overpass.\n\nThe Missouri Department of Transportation was the first US agency to construct one, in Springfield at the junction between I-44 and Missouri Route 13 (at ). Construction began the week of January 12, 2009, and the interchange opened on June 21, 2009. This interchange was a conversion of an existing standard diamond interchange, and used the existing bridge.\n\nThe first interchange in Canada opened on August 13, 2017, at Macleod Trail and 162 Avenue South in Calgary, Alberta. Followed by one in Regina, Saskatchewan the next year as part of the Regina Bypass project.\n\nThe interchange in Seclin (at ) between the A1 and Route d'Avelin was somewhat more specialized than in the diagram at right: eastbound traffic on Route d'Avelin intending to enter the A1 northbound must keep left and cross the northernmost bridge before turning left to proceed north onto A1; eastbound traffic continuing east on Route d'Avelin must select a single center lane, merge with A1 traffic that is exiting to proceed east, and cross a center bridge. All westbound traffic that is continuing west or turning south onto A1 uses the southernmost bridge.\n\nAdditional research was conducted by a partnership of the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University and the Turner-Fairbank Highway Research Center and published by Ohio Section of the Institute of Transportation Engineers. The Federal Highway Administration released a publication titled \"Alternative Intersections/Interchanges: Informational Report (AIIR)\"<ref name=\"Alternative Intersections/Interchanges: Informational Report (AIIR)\"></ref> with a chapter dedicated to this design. \n\nIn December 2019, the Virginia Department of Transportation completed the conversion of the interchange at Courthouse Road and I-95 in Stafford, VA into a diverging diamond interchange.\n\nAs of December 4, 2019, 124 DDIs were operational across the world including:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA free-flowing interchange variant, patented in 2015, has received recent attention. Called the double crossover merging interchange (DCMI), it includes elements from the diverging diamond interchange, the tight diamond interchange, and the stack interchange. It eliminates the disadvantages of weaving and of merging into the outside lane from which the standard DDI variation suffers. As of 2016, no such interchanges have been constructed.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is caused by a failure of the hymen to perforate during fetal development. It is most often diagnosed in adolescent girls when menstrual blood accumulates in the vagina and sometimes also in the uterus. It is treated by surgical incision of the hymen.\n\nAffected newborns may present with acute urinary retention. In adolescent females, the most common symptoms of an imperforate hymen are cyclic pelvic pain and amenorrhea; other symptoms associated with hematocolpos include urinary retention, constipation, low back pain, nausea, and diarrhea. Other vaginal anomalies can have similar symptoms to an imperforate hymen. Vaginal atresia and a transverse vaginal septum require differentiation. A strong urge to defecate has been observed in a few women.\n\nIf untreated or unrecognized before puberty, an imperforate hymen can lead to peritonitis or endometriosis due to retrograde bleeding. Additionally, it can lead to mucometrocolpos (dilatation of the vaginal canal and uterus due to mucous buildup) or hematometrocolpos (dilatation due to buildup of menstrual fluid). Mucometrocolpos and hematocolpos can in turn cause urinary retention, constipation, and urinary tract infection.\n\nAn imperforate hymen is formed during fetal development when the sinovaginal bulbs fail to canalize with the rest of the vagina. Although some instances of familial occurrence have been reported, the condition's occurrence is mostly sporadic, and no genetic markers or mutations have been linked to its cause.\n\nAn imperforate hymen is most often diagnosed in adolescent girls after the age of menarche with otherwise normal development. In adolescent girls of menarcheal age, the typical presentation of the condition is amennorhea and cyclic pelvic pain, indicative of hematocolpos secondary to vaginal obstruction. An imperforate hymen is usually visible on vaginal inspection as a bulging blue membrane. If hematocolpos is present, a mass is often palpable on abdominal or rectal examination. The diagnosis of an imperforate hymen is usually made based purely on the physical exam, although if necessary the diagnosis can be confirmed by transabdominal, transperineal or transrectal ultrasound.\n\nAn imperforate hymen can also be diagnosed in newborn babies and it is occasionally detected on ultrasound scans of the foetus during pregnancy. In newborns the diagnosis is based on the findings of an abdominal or pelvic mass or a bulging hymen. Examination of the normal neonatal vagina usually reveals a track of mucus at the posterior commissure of the labia majora; an absence of mucus may indicate an imperforate hymen or another vaginal obstruction.\n\nA similar condition, cribriform hymen, is diagnosed when the hymen contains many minute openings.\n\nBefore surgical intervention in adolescents, symptoms can be relieved by the combined oral contraceptive pill taken continuously to suppress the menstrual cycle or NSAIDs to relieve pain. Surgical treatment of the imperforate hymen by hymenotomy typically involves making cruciate incisions of the hymen, excising segments of hymen from their bases, and draining the vaginal canal and uterus. For affected girls who wish (or whose parents wish) to have their hymens preserved, surgical techniques to excise of a central flange of the hymen can be used. The timing of surgical hymen repair is controversial: some doctors believe it is best to intervene immediately after the neonatal period, while others believe that surgical repair should be delayed until puberty, when estrogenization is complete.\n\nImperforate hymen is the most common vaginal obstruction of congenital origin. Estimates of the frequency of imperforate hymen vary from 1 in 1000 to 1 in 10,000 females.\n"}

{"id": "1833705", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1833705", "title": "Tropical fish", "text": "Tropical fish\n\nTropical fish are generally those fish found in aquatic tropical environments around the world, including both freshwater and saltwater species. Fishkeepers often keep tropical fish in freshwater and saltwater aquariums. The term \"tropical fish\" is not a taxonomic group, but rather is a general term for fish found in such environments, particularly those kept in aquariums.\n\nTropical fish is a term commonly used to refer to fish that are kept in heated aquariums. Freshwater tropical fish are more commonly kept than saltwater tropical fish due to the common availability of fresh water sources, such as tap water, whereas salt water is not commonly available and has to be recreated by using fresh water with sea salt additions. Salt water has to be monitored to maintain the correct salinity because of the effects of evaporation. Freshwater tropical aquariums can be maintained by simply topping up with fresh water.\nTropical fish are popular choices for aquariums due to their often bright coloration, which typically derives from both pigmented cells and iridescent cells. Tropical fish may include wild-caught specimens, individuals born in captivity including lines selectively bred for special physical features, such as long fins, or particular colorations, such as albino. Some fish may be hybrids of more than one species.\n\nMost fish that are sold as tropical fish are freshwater species. Most species available are generally bred from fish farms in the far east and Florida where tropical temperatures make the commercial production more viable. Mass production of tropical fish from farms has led to many inexpensive fish available to aquarists. Tropical freshwater fish are the most popular group of fish because of the low price and ease of keeping in aquaria. Some species are difficult to breed in captivity and so are still sourced from the wild. These species are generally more expensive. Among the bred-in-captivity species, the most expensive freshwater species include arowanas and flowerhorn cichlids. Some male flowerhorns are sterile due to many cross breedings.\n\nMarine fish that are sold as tropical fish are generally sourced from the wild, usually from the coral reefs around the world. This is because only a few species of marine fish have been successfully bred in captivity with any regularity. The price of marine fish coupled with the difficulty in keeping them alive in aquaria makes them less of a popular choice for aquarists to keep. However, because of the more vivid colours, patterns and behaviour of marine fish compared to freshwater fish, they are still reasonably popular. The advances in filtration technology and increase in available knowledge on how to maintain marine fish as well as the increasing number of aquarium-bred species is seeing a gradual rise in their popularity.\n\nMany marine tropical fish, particularly those of interest to fishkeepers, are those that live among or in close relation to coral reefs. Coral reefs form complex ecosystems with tremendous biodiversity. Among ocean inhabitants, tropical fish stand out as particularly colorful. Hundreds of species can exist in a small area of a healthy reef, many of them hidden or well camouflaged. Reef fish have developed many ingenious specialisations adapted to survival on the reefs.\n\nSome recreational SCUBA divers keep lists of fish species they have observed while diving, especially in tropical marine environments.\n\nCoral reefs occupy less than 1% of the surface area of the world oceans, yet they provide a home for 25% of all marine fish species. Reef habitats are a sharp contrast to the open water habitats that make up the other 99% of the world's oceans.\n\nHowever, loss and degradation of coral reef habitat, increasing pollution, and overfishing including the use of destructive fishing practices, are threatening the survival of the coral reefs and the associated reef fish.\n"}

He has released several solo albums since his first, eponymous album in 1968. Fisher composed the song, \"The Final Trawl,\" which he recorded on the album, \"Windward Away\". Several other groups and singers, including The Clancy Brothers, have also recorded it. Starting in the mid-1970s, he produced four folk albums with Makem and Clancy. He also performed with them and other groups as a backup singer and guitarist. He hosted his own radio show on BBC Radio Scotland for almost three decades.\n\nArchie Fisher was born in Glasgow on 23 October 1939 into a large singing family. His sister Cilla Fisher is also a professional singer, as was his late sister Ray. In 1960 he moved to Edinburgh and appeared regularly at \"The Howff\" folk club run by Roy Guest. In 1962 Ray and Archie released the single \"Far Over the Forth\" on the Topic Records label and appeared on the BBC \"Hootenanny\" programme. In 1965 the whole family released the album \"Traditional and New Songs from Scotland\".\n\nIn 1963 Fisher ran a weekly folk club at the Crown Bar in Edinburgh, there he met acoustic musicians Robin Williamson and Clive Palmer who were performing together as a traditional folk duo. Mike Heron later auditioned to play rhythm guitar and the trio became The Incredible String Band.\n\nBy 1964 the Edinburgh Fringe could boast a folk festival in its own right. An album of the participants was released on Decca. It was called \"Edinburgh Folk Festival vol 2\" and contained tracks by Ray Fisher, Archie Fisher, Anne Briggs and the Ian Campbell Folk Group (including Dave Swarbrick). Bert Jansch and Briggs performed together but this was never recorded. At an early stage Fisher recognised the power of Barbara Dickson's singing and in 1969 invited her to guest on his albums. His live act included 'All Around My Hat', later to become a hit for Steeleye Span. His song \"Witch of the Westmorland\" was recorded by Dickson in 1971 on her album \"From the Beggar's Mantle\", by Fisher on \"The Man With a Rhyme\" in 1976, by Stan Rogers in 1979 and by Golden Bough in 1983.\n\nIn 1983 Fisher started hosting the long-running BBC Radio Scotland folk programme \"Travelling Folk\". He retired in April 2010, handing over presenting duties to fiddler Bruce MacGregor. He appeared as the lead guitarist on Tom Paxton's 1986 album, \"The Very Best of Tom Paxton\", and performed with Tommy Makem and Liam Clancy on television, recordings and concert tours. He also produced the Irish duo's first four albums, \"Tommy Makem & Liam Clancy\" (1976), \"The Makem & Clancy Concert\" (1977), \"Two For The Early Dew\" (1978) and \"The Makem & Clancy Collection\" (1980). After Barbara Dickson achieved fame as an easy listening singer it was many years before she sang folk songs again. When she did, Archie was invited back to join her.\n\nFisher has toured Canada and the U.S. as a solo act as well as appearing with Garnet Rogers and with John Renbourn. His style of singing is very gentle and he avoids all electronic instruments. \"Dark-Eyed Molly\" has been recorded by Fairport Convention, Eva Cassidy, Stan Rogers and Sheena Wellington. \"Lindsay\" has been recorded by John Renbourn and has been a highlight at his live shows for years, while \"Mountain Rain\" has been recorded by Wizz Jones (along with John Renbourn on guitar).\n\nFisher now lives in the south of Scotland. He was awarded an MBE in the New Year Honours List in 2006.\n\n\nIn 2009 \"Come All ye Fisher Lasses\" from \"The Fisher family\" was included in Topic Records 70 year anniversary boxed set \"Three Score and Ten\" as track two on the fourth CD.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1833715", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1833715", "title": "Group voting ticket", "text": "Group voting ticket\n\nA group voting ticket (GVT) is a simplified preferential voting system currently in use for elections to the Victorian Legislative Council and Western Australian Legislative Council, the upper houses of two Australian state legislatures. It was also previously used in federal and several Australian state elections that used the single transferable vote system. Under the system, for multi-member electoral divisions, a group or party registers a GVT before an election with the electoral commission. When a voter selects a group or party “above the line” on a ballot paper, their vote is distributed according to the registered GVT for that group. It has been abolished by New South Wales and South Australia. It was used in the Australian Senate from the 1984 federal election until the 2013 federal election. A form of GVT is used for some elections in Fiji.\n\nEvery Australian jurisdiction that has introduced GVTs has ballot papers with two sections separated by a line. Voters may choose to vote either “above the line” or \"below the line\". By voting “below the line” voters can rank each candidate individually by numbering all boxes. Voters can choose to vote for a group ticket by placing the number '1' in one of the ticket boxes above the line. The single number '1' selects a GVT from one group or party, and all preferences are then distributed according to the GVT. This leads to pre-election trading between parties on how each group will allocate later preferences to other groups and candidates.\n\nAbout 95% of voters vote above the line.\n\nThe introduction of GVTs led to the establishment of a multitude of minor parties and the creation of preference deals between them, enabling one or more candidates within the group to receive sufficient preferences to achieve the requisite quota for election, especially in multi-member electoral divisions. Such preference deals were first arranged for the 1999 NSW election, which saw the Minor Party Alliance succeed in having three of its members elected.\n\nGVTs have been abolished for federal Senate elections and for elections in New South Wales and South Australia. They continue to be available in Victoria and Western Australia.\n\nIn elections for the Australian Senate, the New South Wales Legislative Council and the South Australian Legislative Council, voters can express an order of preferences for parties by voting '1', '2' and so on in different boxes “above the line”. The scope of a number above the line is merely the list of candidates for each party. The party supplies a list of its candidates to the Australian Electoral Commission, New South Wales Electoral Commission or Electoral Commission of South Australia before the election. All three jurisdictions have limited optional preferential voting, which enables voters to number as many boxes as they choose, but those only apply to the registered party list.\n\nNew South Wales changed \"above the line\" voting for Legislative Council before the 2003 NSW election to optional preferential voting. Parties are now required to submit a higher minimum number of qualified members. A candidate group for Legislative Council elections now requires at least 15 candidates to be eligible for an \"above the line\" box. Parties do not register group preference tickets and a single 1 in a group’s box only preferences the candidates in the group. Voters wishing to preference multiple parties with an \"above the line\" vote can use lower preferences (\"2\", \"3\", and so on) in those parties' \"above the line\" boxes. The changes reduced the number of parties contesting elections and increased the difficulty for new small parties to be elected.\n\nVoting is compulsory in all Australian jurisdictions for both houses of Parliament, and those of the Australian States. Complete preferences voting was the only option available for the Australian Senate and the upper houses of other jurisdictions, and still is \"below the line\" in Western Australian elections. With the use proportional representation and preferential voting, it was daunting for many voters to have to fill in scores of boxes on the ballot paper. Some voters would choose their early preferences and then vote for other candidates in the order they appeared on the ballot paper—known as a \"donkey vote\"; or fill in the form incorrectly, leading to an informal vote. To ease this task, the GVT option was introduced to permit voters to choose one party or group, and all the remaining squares were deemed to be filled in according to a registered party ticket.\n\nGroup voting tickets were introduced for elections for the Australian Senate by the Hawke Labor Government to reduce the number of invalid votes by simplifying the voting system for the Senate. Under the new system a voter cast a valid vote if they placed a single mark above the line instead of the scores on a typical Senate ballot paper. It was first used at the 1984 federal election. For the Australian Senate, the rate of informal voting was reduced from around 9% before 1984, to around 3% under “above the line” GVT system.\n\nGroup voting tickets were introduced in South Australia in 1985 in New South Wales and Western Australia in 1987 and in Victoria in 1988.\n\nFollowing the use of tactical preference tickets and the record number of minor parties contesting the 1999 NSW election for the New South Wales Legislative Council, a modified form of \"above the line\" voting was introduced for the 2003 NSW election, effectively abolishing the GVTs. Other changes to party registration processes also resulted in many fewer parties contesting NSW Legislative Council elections.\n\nGroup voting tickets for the Senate were abolished in March 2016 in favour of optional preferential voting in time for the 2016 federal election.\n\nSouth Australia changed from group voting tickets to optional preferential voting before the 2018 South Australian election. Instructions for above the line votes are to mark '1' and then further preferences are optional. The effect of an above the line vote is now to vote for all candidates in a single group in order, and not to follow a GVT. Voters who vote below the line are instructed to provide at least 12 preferences as opposed to having to number all candidates, and with a savings provision to admit ballot papers which indicate at least 6 below the line preferences.\n\nGroup voting tickets voting has been criticised because electors do not know, and have no practical way of finding out, where their preferences are being directed. All details are published in advance, both electronically and in a free booklet published by the Australian Electoral Commission or the appropriate State electoral commission. The booklets may be viewed at polling booths on request to the poll officials. However, such is the complexity of the information that it is unlikely that the average voter could easily determine the fate of their vote's preferences particularly, as some parties submit multiple allocations (e.g., 33% to one party, 66% to another, and so on), and the effects are integrally wound up in preference deals between other parties.\n\nUsing GVTs, the potential for tactical voting by parties is greatly increased. Because voters are not usually aware of how a party's preferences are directed, GVTs have allowed minor parties with low support in the community to be elected almost exclusively on the preferences of other parties, for example, where small parties with very different views have agreed to exchange preferences, or where larger parties have sought to minimise votes for opponents with similar views.\n\nA notable case was the 1999 New South Wales state election when the Outdoor Recreation Party's Malcolm Jones was elected to the Legislative Council with a primary vote of 0.19%, or 0.042 of a quota.\n\nGVTs came under scrutiny at the 2013 Australian election for multiple candidates getting provisionally elected with the vast majority of the 14.3% quota being filled from preferences, with \"preference whisperer\" Glenn Druery's Minor Party Alliance organising tight cross-preferencing between minor parties. Ricky Muir from the Australian Motoring Enthusiast Party won a senate seat on a record-low primary vote of 0.5% in Victoria (previous record held by Family First's Steve Fielding in 2004 on 1.9% in Victoria). The Sports Party's Wayne Dropulich was on track for a period of time to win a Senate seat from 0.2% in Western Australia, coming 21st out of 28 groups. Family First's Bob Day won a seat on a primary vote of 3.8% in South Australia, and the DLP's John Madigan won his seat in 2010 on a primary vote of 2.3% in Victoria. Xenophon and larger parties including the government proposed changes to the GVT system.\n"}

He was one of the Competitors for the Crown of Scotland.\n\nSaid to be aged 47 at his father's death, Sir Patrick de Dunbar, Knight, Earl of Dunbar, had livery of his father's lands on 14 May 1290. It appears that this Earl of Dunbar assumed the additional alternate title Earl of March, as he appeared designated \"Comes de Marchia\" at the parliament at Birgham in 1290, for the purpose of betrothing the Princess Margaret to the son of King Edward I of England. (This failed to come about).\n\nPatrick was one of the \"seven earls of Scotland,\" a distinct body separate from the other estates of the realm, who claimed the right to elect a king in cases of disputed succession. He was one of the Competitors for the Crown of Scotland in 1291, when he entered a formal claim in right of his great-grandmother, Ada, Countess of Dunbar, an illegitimate daughter of William The Lion, King of Scots. Like so many Scottish noblemen, including the Bruces, Dunbar held lands in England also which required knights' services, and he was summoned by King Edward I in 1294 to assist him at war in Gascony.\n\nThe Earl of Dunbar and March, with the Earl of Angus, Robert Bruce the elder, and his son the Earl of Carrick, swore fealty to the English King at Wark on 25 March 1296. In this turbulent year he appears to have been betrayed by his wife, who took the Scottish side and retained the castle of Dunbar for Balliol, but was obliged to surrender it to King Edward I of England in April 1296. In 1297 it appears that the Earl ceased his allegiance to Edward I, held his lands of the Scottish Crown, and was favourably received by Sir William Wallace, with whom he had been in bitter battle the previous year.\n\nIn 1298 he was King's Lieutenant for Scotland, and in 1300 was present at the siege of Caerlaverock Castle, with his eldest son and heir, Patrick.\n\nThe Earl married, before 1282, Marjorie, daughter of Alexander Comyn, Earl of Buchan by his spouse Elizabeth, daughter of Roger de Quincy, 2nd Earl of Winchester by Ellen of Galloway.\n\nThey had known issue:\n\n"}

When the pressure plate is moved approximately 9 mm downwards it exerts pressure on the fuze. If fuzed with the T-72 clear plastic-cased blast resistant fuze, pressure on the top of the fuze will depress the casing which will revolve due to the depression of the spring which is attached to the casing. The revolution is controlled by lugs on the inner fuze assembly which fit in grooves in the fuze casing. When the fuze casing is revolved and depressed sufficiently, the two retaining balls to will fall away in groove in the outer casing, which releases the striker. The striker is driven down by the spring, initiating the detonator, which in turn initiates the booster and the main charge. The mine is blast resistant since rapid depression of the fuze will push the fuze casing straight down without any revolution. The lugs on the inner fuze assembly will then slide into vertical groves instead of the diagonal ones. The striker retaining balls will then be prevented from coming in line with the groves in the outer casing and the striker will not be released. Instead the pressure plate will bounce back into its original position.\n\nTwo similar plastic bodied AT mines manufactured in China are the Type 69 and the Type 81, although it is entirely possible that there is no difference between the Type 69, Type 72 and Type 81 mines other than their fuzes. The basic descriptions (dimensions, weights, appearance, colour) for Type 69 and Type 81 mines match the Type 72 very closely. The fuzes are all blast resistant and the mine name may only vary depending on the fuze used.\n\nBecause of its low metal content, the Type 72 cannot be located using metal detectors under most field conditions. The Type 72 is resistant to shock and overpressure from explosive breaching systems such as the Giant Viper and MICLIC.\n\nA copy of the mine, the YM-III (sometimes YM-3), is produced in Iran. It is slightly heavier at 7 kg, with a slightly heavier 5.7 kg Composition B main charge, with a slightly higher activation pressure of 450 to 900 kg. Additionally, a copy is produced in South Africa as \"Non-metallic anti-tank mine\".\n\n\n\n"}

His successors controlled the marches, but the title \"Earl of March\" was only assumed by Patrick IV, Earl of March.\n\nPatrick did homage for his lands in England to King Henry III in 1249. The earl was part of the English faction who opposed the Comyns and in 1255 he and others procured the dismissal of the Comyns and their faction from power. The same year he was nominated Regent and Guardian of the King and Queen. In 1258 the Comyn's faction prevailed, and Earl Patrick was excluded from the government.\n\nIn 1263 he founded a monastery for the Carmelites or White Friars in Dunbar; and led the left division of the Scottish army at the battle of Largs the same year.

{"id": "1833777", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1833777", "title": "Earth's Children", "text": "Earth's Children\n\nEarth's Children is a series of epic historical fiction novels written by Jean M. Auel set circa 30,000 years before present. There are six novels in the series. Auel had previously mentioned in interviews that there would be a seventh novel, but publicity announcements for the sixth confirmed it would be the final book in the sequence.\n\nThe series is set in Europe during the Upper Paleolithic era, after the date of the first ceramics discovered, but before the last advance of glaciers. The books focus on the period of co-existence between Cro-Magnons and Neanderthals.\n\nAs a whole, the series is a tale of personal discovery: coming-of-age, invention, cultural complexities, and, beginning with the second book, explicit romantic sex. It tells the story of Ayla, an orphaned Cro-Magnon girl who is adopted and raised by a tribe of Neanderthals and who later embarks on a journey to find the Others (her own kind), meeting along the way her romantic interest and supporting co-protagonist, Jondalar.\n\nThe story arc in part comprises a travel tale, in which the two lovers journey from the region of Ukraine to Jondalar's home in what is now France, along an indirect route up the Danube River valley. In the third and fourth works, they meet various groups of Cro-Magnons and encounter their culture and technology. The couple finally return to southwestern France and Jondalar's people in the fifth novel. The series includes a highly detailed focus on botany, herbology, herbal medicine, archaeology and anthropology, but it also features substantial amounts of romance, coming-of-age crises, and—employing significant literary license—the attribution of certain advances and inventions to the protagonists.\n\nIn addition, Auel's series incorporates a number of recent archeological and anthropological theories. It also suggested the notion of Sapiens-Neanderthal interbreeding.\n\nThe author's treatment of unconventional sexual practices (which are central to her hypothesized nature-centered religions) and frequent explicit depictions of sex has earned the series a top twenty place on the American Library Association's list of the \"100 Most Frequently Challenged Books of 1990–1999\".\n\nThe first book, \"The Clan of the Cave Bear\" was released in September 1980 and is a story of personal development set in pre-historic southern Europe during the current Ice Age but before the last glacial period. It introduces the reader to a wide variety of diverse topics, including herbal medicine and anthropological-archeological reasoning. The book introduces Ayla, a young girl belonging to the titular clan who looks nothing like her peers, especially with her long, golden hair.\n\n\"The Valley of Horses\" was released in September 1982. Ayla, cast out of the Clan, has been forced to follow the advice given her in the first book by her dying foster-mother Iza. She goes in search of \"the Others\"—that is, people like herself: European Cro-Magnon \"Homo sapiens\", or early-modern humans, returned west and north to Europe after an incubation period of tens of millennia in the near and far east.\n\nThe third book in the series, \"The Mammoth Hunters\", was released in fall 1985. It details Ayla's personal growth as she learns to cope with a society of widely disparate individuals and their unpredictable behaviors, mysterious motivations, and habits.\n\n\"The Plains of Passage\" was released in November 1990. Ayla and Jondalar travel west, back to Zelandonii territory, encountering dangers from both nature and humans along the way. Her interactions often force the people around her to take a broader view and be more accepting of new ideas.\n\n\"The Shelters of Stone\" was released on 30 April 2002. Ayla and Jondalar reach the Ninth Cave of the Zelandonii, Jondalar's home, and prepare to marry and have a child. Unfortunately, nothing is ever simple, especially for a woman with Ayla's background.\n\n\"The Land of Painted Caves\", a sixth and final installment in the Earth Children's series was published on March 29, 2011. Author Jean M. Auel is quoted in September 2010 saying that in the book Ayla is now about 25 years old and training to become a spiritual leader of the Zelandonii. Her training includes a series of harrowing journeys.\n\nSince the stories take place during the Würm glaciation, populations are small in number and are surviving mostly in hunter-gatherer fashion. Prior to the discovery of metals, the primary materials used for tools are leather, wood, bone, horn, and flint.\n\nIn Auel's series, two cultures vie for resources, space, and survival: the \"Clan\", which is what Neanderthals call themselves, and the Cro-Magnons (whom Ayla, with her Clan upbringing, generally refers to as \"The Others\"). The races are fairly different in culture, society and technology, but with some overlap: both depend on flint for their tools; both recognize the importance of fire and use it; both hunt and gather.\n\nPhysiologically, the Clan are heavier and broader but also shorter than the people of The Others. They are very slow to embrace change and to innovate, and they still chase after animals to spear them directly, whereas the Cro-Magnons are enthusiastic about innovation and have moved on to projectile spears. The Clan's tools, clothing, and household implements are similarly less refined and sometimes less effective than those of their Cro-Magnon counterparts, whose implements and other goods are more technologically sophisticated.\n\nThe Clan's reluctance to change is depicted by Auel as a function of their cognition; they are presented as dependent upon their racial-genetic memory. The average Clan child needs only be\" 'reminded' \"of a thing to know it permanently, though skilled tasks still require repetitive practice. Furthermore, the need to encode \"everything\" into a child's brain has increased the average Neanderthal head size to the point that, by the time of the first novel, women of the Clan are having trouble giving birth to their large-headed babies—a sign that their evolutionary strategy has run its course.\n\nThe \"Flatheads\", as \"The Others\" pejoratively call the Neanderthals (owing to their distinctive back-sloping foreheads), also have a far more limited vocal repertoire than The Others, and largely communicate instead via a gestural sign language, although spoken words are sometimes used to add emphasis to the gestures. Auel describes this language as being quite nuanced, especially as bodily posture, facial expression and other physical actions — in short, body language — can expedite and expand upon the basic vocabulary of the hand signals. A Cro-Magnon observing Ayla demonstrating a translation characterizes the language as dancelike and elegant.\n\nFor this reason, Clan members are highly adept at reading body language and cannot be deceived by lying; while one can spell an untruth with one's hands, one's posture will give it away. Consequently, the idea of telling an untruth is alien to Clan culture, a fact that Ayla needs time to conceptualize and understand. However, a Clan member can \"refrain from mentioning\" something she would prefer other people did not know, even though residual clues would probably reveal that something was being concealed. Cultural conventions, Auel suggests, would cause other Clan members to ignore the concealment out of sheer courtesy, though, again, Ayla has trouble grasping this concept.\n\nFinally, the wider Clan possesses not only a colloquial, everyday \"localized\" language, but also a more formal \"ancient\" or \"spirit language,\" used to converse with ancestors and understood by every Clan member, anywhere. This language facilitates easy communication at inter-regional meetings of normally separated groups and does not require the multilingualism that the Others must acquire. This \"spirit language\" has no spoken words apart from personal names, and its users generally refer to themselves in the third person.\n\nIn Auel's context, our human ancestors, The Cro-Magnon \"Others,\" generally look upon the \"Flatheads\" as animals, hardly better than bears (the lack of vocal language is a primary factor in this verdict). The Clan, for their part, seem to have no strong opinions about the Others other than considering their spoken language as babbling and a sign of their lack of intellect. Otherwise, they have concluded it is best simply to avoid the Cro-Magnon men.\n\nAccurate to current DNA evidence, Auel depicts Cro-Magnons and Neanderthals as able to interbreed. The mixed-race children are generally not favorably regarded by either group. As in many historical cultures, malformed Clan children are routinely subjected to exposure, while the Others may allow such children to live but prejudicially label them as 'abominations'. Such children and their experiences enter the plotline in several books of the series.\n\n\"Children of mixed spirits\", as the Cro-Magnons call them, are mis-matched combinations of both Cro-Magnon and Neanderthal phenotypes physiologically as they are genetic hybrids, with some traits (like facial features) appearing blurred or distorted when compared side-by-side. Of the five mixed-race people depicted in the series, only one has had the restricted vocal range of the Clan (Rydag, from \"The Mammoth Hunters\"), and all but one has been seen using Clan sign language, the sole exception being the difficult and disconsolate self-loathing Brukeval (who is in clear psychological denial about his ancestry), in \"The Shelters of Stone\".The vocal range of one of the mixed-race persons is as of yet unknown because she was only a baby when we meet her in \"The Clan of the Cave Bear\".\n\n\"The Clan\" is an overarching term; every Neanderthal is a member of the Clan. Organizationally, they live in smaller tribes, also called \"clans\" but named after the man who leads them; for instance, Ayla is adopted into Brun's clan. Later, when Brun steps down and, as is traditional, passes leadership of the clan on to the son of his mate, it becomes known as Broud's clan. Every seven years, Clans from the immediate area meet in a Clan Gathering; the only one Auel has depicted consisted of approximately 250 people. The Clan is mostly patriarchal: women cannot hunt, make hunting tools, lead a Clan or become a \"Mog-ur\" (a spiritual leader or shaman). But men cannot become medicine women, a job that is almost as prestigious as clan leader. Unlike other women, whose status depends on the status of their mates, a medicine woman has status in her own right and can, if her line is illustrious enough, even outrank the leader's mate.\n\n\"The Earth Children\" is an overarching term; their primary allegiances are to their people and their caves. Each culture has a name for itself (\"Zelandonii\", for instance, means \"Children of the Great Earth Mother who live in the Southwest\") and may subdivide into smaller Caves or Camps (the Twenty-Ninth Cave of the Zelandonii, the Lion Camp of the Mamutoi). Curiously, however, most Other culture names includes their word for \"Great Earth Mother\": \"Doni\" in Zelandonii, \"Mut\" in Mamutoi (\"Children of the Great Earth Mother who hunt Mammoths\"), \"Gaea\" in Sungaea (translation unknown), etc. Their culture is far more egalitarian, with different twists and customs at every hand; Mamutoi Camps, for instance, are co-ruled by headmen and headwomen who are biological, or adoptive, siblings, and the Sharamudoi, a people that lives half-on and -off the Great Mother River, form complex co-mate systems between river couples (Ramudoi) and land couples (Shamudoi). Each entire people generally gathers for Summer Meetings every year, during which a number of important ceremonies, such as the Matrimonial, take place.\n\nThe Clan worships animal spirits, most notably Ursus the Cave Bear, for, as is related in one of the best known Clan legends, it was the Spirit of the Great Cave Bear that taught the Clan to wear fur, live in caves, and store up reserves during the seasons of abundance in order to survive the winter. The honoring of Ursus is what binds the Clan together as a people, and it is for this reason that the Bear Ceremony, and Feast of Ursus which follows it, held at the Clan Gathering are the highest religious rituals of the Clan. As described in Chapter 22 of Clan of the Cave Bear when Brun's clan chanced to see a living cave bear on their way to the Clan Gathering, \"But it was more than the tremendous size of the animal that held the clan spellbound. This was Ursus, the personification of the Clan itself. He was their kin, and more, he embodied their very essence. His bones alone were so sacred they could ward off any evil. The kinship they felt was a spiritual tie, far more meaningful than any physical one. It was through his spirit that all clans were united into one and meaning was given to the Gathering they had traveled so far to attend. It was his essence that made them Clan, the Clan of the Cave Bear.\"\n\nThe Clan's animal spirits are always male. However, in the early days of the Clan, weather spirits such as Wind and Rain—spirits whose worship is so ancient that Creb had to use deep meditation to find them in the Clan memories—bore female names. Goov, Creb's apprentice, also speculates that Ayla's totem may be the Cave Lioness, rather than the Cave Lion, although this would be unprecedented in the Clan.\n\nIn the ancient days when the weather spirits were honored, roles within the Clan had not yet become so markedly differentiated by sex—for example, women still hunted alongside the men when they didn't have little children who needed their care. At this time, women were also the ones in charge of the spiritual life of the Clan. Because they once controlled access to the spirit world, and because the ceremonies involved begging the Clan spirits in what could be considered an unmanly fashion, Clan tradition holds that should a woman see one of the men's religious ceremonies, the clan in which this occurred would suffer disaster. When a ceremony invoking the weather spirits is held to sanction Ayla's hunting, especially strong protection was required for the men, both to guard against the presence of a female at the ceremony and because the ancient spirits were feared as much as they were honored in the days when they were worshiped. Ayla's subsequent accidental observation of one of the highest ceremonies at the Clan Gathering is interpreted by Creb to foretell doom for the entire Clan of the Cave Bear, as those ceremonies have meaning for all the clans of the Clan, even those not present at the Gathering.\n\nAll Clan members are assigned a totem at birth, and boys are marked with that totem's ritual tattoo as part of the ceremony that marks their passage from child to man following their first major hunting kill. People are also believed to possess personality traits similar to those of their totem spirit; Broud, quick-tempered, stubborn and unpredictable like a woolly rhinoceros (his totem spirit) is a prime example. Totems are also responsible for pregnancy; a woman's moon time is believed to be her totem fighting off the presences of marauding male totems; for this reason, women's totems are almost invariably weaker than those of men and women may not associate with men during menstruation. Should the male totem prove stronger, the woman will become pregnant. If the totem is not strong enough by itself, it may ask for the help of one or more other totems, in which case it may be one of the other totems that leaves behind an impregnating essence. It is considered especially lucky for a boy to have the same totem as the mate of his mother. Totems are assigned by \"Mog-ur\"s, men whose talent is understanding the world of spirits. Each individual Clan has its own \"Mog-ur\", but one - the one in the clan which Ayla joins - is traditionally recognized as being first among them.\n\nThe Clan also believe that, if someone survives a cave bear attack, it means that person is now under the protection of Ursus and may claim the Cave Bear as their totem, in addition to the totem they were assigned in early childhood. Unlike other Clan totems, there is no specific mark for the Cave Bear and the Cave Bear is believed not to play a role in the conception, although it may be called on to help subdue a woman's unusually strong totem. In \"Clan of the Cave Bear\", two people, Creb and a man injured by a cave bear at a Clan Gathering, are described as being \"chosen\" in this way.\n\nThe Others worship the Great Earth Mother, and to some extent the Moon, her Fair Celestial Mate. The Great Earth Mother goes by many names, depending on the language, but is worshipped unconditionally as the source of all bounty, and carved depictions of her proliferate. Faith and guidance are administered by spiritual leaders of both sexes, with different names depending on the language. Among most of the peoples described, Those Who Serve abandon their personal names in favor of the name of their people and god. (The Mamutoi are the only depicted exception so far: only the Mamut of the Lion Camp, who is first amongst his priesthood due to his age and spiritual power, no longer uses any name but Mamut—mostly because no one remembers his original name!) To avoid confusion, among the Zelandonii they generally take appendices after their cave (e.g. Zelandoni of the Ninth Cave, First Acolyte to the Zelandonii of the Second Cave, etc.), leading Ayla to muse that they have traded their names for counting words, i.e. numbers. As with the Clan, one among Those Who Serve is generally acknowledged (or elected) First.\n\nWhether accurately or not, Auel has incorporated sex into her prehistoric culture in a number of unique ways. While neither Clan nor Other society requires monogamy, a major difference is that in the former, sex can be treated as a purely physical need, whereas in the latter, it is always imbued with something of the sacred. For the Others, nothing is more abhorrent than the idea of sex without consent, and sexual rituals form a significant part of their culture.\n\nAmong the Clan, there exists a hand sign that only men can make and only women can receive, instructing the female in question to present for sexual intercourse. Any man of the Clan (a male who has made his first hunting kill) may give this instruction to any woman of the Clan (a female who has passed menarche), should he feel the need to \"relieve his needs,\" regardless of marital status. (The female's state of arousal is never addressed directly, but since Clan women are able to flirt with men using seductive and inviting body language, enjoyment of the act is not unknown.) Because the Clan believes babies are created by the Totems and have no concept of any connection between copulation and conception, lines of descent are matrilineal, but any children a man's mate bears are considered his heirs (especially in regards to the son of the leader's mate becoming the future leader), and he is expected to provide for her family and train her sons to hunt. Who is mated to whom is decided solely by the men, though wise leaders do of course take the prospective bride's feelings into account; the few Clans depicted average less than fifty members, and even one discordant pairing can cause trouble.\n\nSexual maturity is the subject of semi-religious customs among the Others, both of which take place at Summer Meetings. Every year, women volunteer to become sexual tutors to boys who have reached maturity; the name of their office changes from culture to culture, but they are generally furnished with some distinguishing marking, often the Mother's sacred color red (red dye on the soles of the feet for the Mamutoi; a red fringe among the Zelandonii). These women are often pregnant by the end of the summer, which is believed to be the Great Earth Mother smiling upon their piety. Young women who have reached menarche, on the other hand, are the subject of a far more formal ceremony called First Rites, in which she is ritually deflowered by a man (often specially chosen by her friends and family). Both these relationships are meant to be solely physical, and social contact between the involved parties is frowned upon for at least a year afterwards. Finally, during \"Mother Festivals\" which take place at various times of the year, men and women are free to copulate with whomever they choose. Once again, these polygamous practices blur the lines of heredity, and descent is generally traced only through one's mother. However, certain familial resemblances have been noticed (for instance, Jondalar looks almost identical to Dalanar, his mother's spouse at the time of Jondalar's conception), which has led to the belief that the Great Earth Mother chooses the \"spirit\" or \"essence\" of a nearby man to impregnate the woman with. Ayla's more accurate belief that children are the result of sexual activity is treated with skepticism among the Others: their women are seldom celibate, which makes the connection between sex and pregnancy harder to isolate.\n\nHomosexual relationships are portrayed as acceptable, if rare. The Zelandonii religious order features at least one homosexual male with a male partner. A Mamutoi clan leader is openly bisexual. Many shamans are also portrayed as what would now be called third gender or non-binary, along with mention of a Mamutoi who in our modern terms is a transwoman.\n\n"}
{"id": "1833792", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1833792", "title": "NUS High School of Math and Science", "text": "NUS High School of Math and Science\n\nThe NUS (National University of Singapore) High School of Math and Science is a specialized independent high school in Singapore offering a six-year Integrated Programme (IP) leading to the NUS High School Diploma.\n\nThe school offers a highly accelerated mathematics and science curriculum integrated with language, arts, humanities, sports, in a modular system. Over 70% of its graduates have pursued Science, Technology, Engineering and Medicine-related courses in University.\n\nThough NUS High School is an Integrated Programme school, which allows students to bypass O-levels, it does not offer A-level or International Baccalaureate programmes, unlike other Integrated Programme schools in Singapore. Instead, it offers an NUS High School Diploma, which is recognized by all universities in Singapore, as well as top universities worldwide; its academic rigour is comparable to the above-mentioned qualifications.\n\nThe diploma's curriculum is based on a modular system similar to NUS, where core modules are compulsory, elective modules help deepen the student's knowledge and may be compulsory for a major in a particular subject, and enrichment modules are purely for the student's interests. The school uses the cumulative average point (CAP) system, a 5-point system similar to the grade point average used in the United States. This is unlike most other schools in Singapore, where subjects are graded according to the British GSCE System.\n\nMost notably, the school's mathematics and science curriculums are accelerated. Topics are usually covered earlier than normal; for example, the mole is introduced in Year 2 rather than in Year 3, some kinematics in Year 1 and Year 2 instead of Year 5, and molecular biology and genetics in Year 4 instead of Year 6. Examples of accelerated curriculum on mathematics include sections on solutions of equations in Year 1 rather than in Year 3, three-dimensional vectors and matrices in Years 2 and 4 instead of Year 5.\n\nThe school also offers honours courses in the Specialization Stage for mathematical and scientific disciplines, to further stretch the abilities of able students beyond the already-accelerated curriculum. The curriculum in these honours courses usually covers university material, such as linear algebra in mathematics, calculus-based electromagnetism in physics, organic synthesis and spectroscopy in chemistry, and proteomics in biology.\n\nStudents are also exposed to humanities and the arts, where the flexible modular system allows for sampling across this discipline. Mother tongue is compulsory in the school, and complies with the Ministry of Education's guidelines and curriculum, and the English curriculum teaches students practical skills such as reading, writing, and public speaking.\n\nTo graduate with the NUS High School diploma, students must take mathematics and at least two science subjects (which includes computing studies as well) at the major (basic) level in the Advancement Stage. Students may also choose to take a fourth subject from any subject group (sciences, humanities & the arts), and take any math/science subject at the honours level. In addition, students must complete an Advanced Research Project under the school's Da Vinci Research Programme. Finally, students must have a CAP above 2.5 (C+). Students are also encouraged to take Advanced Placement and Scholastic Assessment Test (SAT) examinations in their senior years for credits for admission into foreign universities, though these are not necessary for graduation.\n\nTo further develop talented students, NUS High School offers the following special academic programmes:\n\nExceptionally talented students are allowed to accelerate in their curriculum after being assessed, giving them an opportunity to take higher-level modules at an earlier year.\n\nThe rate of exception is relatively low, but increasing over time. For example, in 2013, from year 1 only three students accelerated above their level in math. About a third of students finish the curriculum early and would go on to take NUS modules. \n\nAll students must go through a research curriculum called the Da Vinci Programme, which is planned and managed by the Office of Research, Innovation, and Enterprise. The program is structured as follows:\n\nIn Years 1 and 2, students participate in activities that stimulate creative thinking. They undergo rigorous training, accompanied by continual assessment, to simulate the hectic work life where one must often face challenges and trials.\nIn Years 3 and 4, students take part in Independent Research Studies, which are structured to give students flexibility in conducting research. Students are required to complete a Research Methodology module and are encouraged to work on a research project under the guidance of a teacher-mentor. Students are also able to participate in external research programmes at institutions of higher education.\nIn Years 5 and 6, students must embark on a capstone project, an Advanced Research Project in an area of Math or Science. Typically, a graduation research project will take nine to eighteen months to complete, depending on the research topic, and it usually comprises at least two weeks of full-time research. Research projects are generally mentored by full-time academics at leading research institutions, universities or polytechnics. All students showcase their research at the school's annual Research Congress held in March, where they receive grades of Distinction, Merit, Pass or Fail.\n\nThere are a total of 24 CCAs currently offered in the school, in four categories, performing arts, Clubs and Societies, Sports & Games, and Uniformed Groups. It is compulsory for every student to take part in a CCA. They may take part in 2 CCAs.\n\nStudents are required to live in the NUS High Boarding School for the duration of their fifth year of study (Year 5). This arrangement is meant to train independence and, more pragmatically, facilitate work on the Advanced Research Project, which usually takes place in science laboratories close to school. This scheme also increases accessibility for students taking modules at the nearby National University of Singapore.\n\nThe NUS High campus sits on 4.67 hectares of land off Clementi Ave 1, a few minutes walk from the outskirts of the National University of Singapore. The school shifted operations there from its holding site at the former Raffles Junior College at Mount Sinai Road where it had held classes in 2005. NUS High received an Honour Award from US-based DesignShare Awards programme for the innovative design of its affiliated NUS High School. The award is given to projects that exemplify \"best practice innovation from around the world in designing for the future of learning\".\n\nThe campus comprises 15 science laboratories, over fifty classrooms, a 700-seat auditorium, a 150-seat theatrette, and the NUS High School Residence (Boarding School), in 6 levels. Sports facilities include tennis courts, a 400-meter track, Netball and Basketball court.\n\nThe most notable of the school's facilities include a scanning electron microscope, which is housed in a science research lab called the \"SEM room\". Considering its high cost, it is rare for an institution of this size and level to have such a piece of equipment and as such it can only be accessed by teachers and students who are doing their research experiments. The school also has an observatory located on the roof of its Boarding School building that is often used by astronomy enthusiasts.\n\nThe school also has a Science Research Complex on the top floor. Six specialised research laboratories are located there (a life sciences lab, an analytical chemistry lab, a synthetic chemistry lab, an applied technology lab, a clean energy development lab and an infocomm technology lab). This is in addition to an IP video conferencing room, seminar rooms, and additional classrooms. The advanced facilities and scientific equipment, which are comparable to those available in universities, complement the 9 basic science laboratories located on the third floor (concourse) of the school.\n\nIn addition, the campus has many publicised facades like the \"DNA\" \"nucleotides\", the \"Nano-Tube\", \"pi wall\", \"Math Walk\", and the \"Periodic-Table\". Other facilities include a field with a 400 m running track, one basketball court, two tennis courts, a netball court, a badminton court, a multi-purpose hall, environmental and eco-garden features, an exhibition concourse, a student lounge, five computer laboratories, a media resource room, and a library and canteen running alongside each other under the running track. The campus also has art and music studios and co-curricular activity rooms, as well as facilities for the disabled.\n\nThe campus includes a boarding school (NUS High School Residence) consisting of two blocks that can accommodate some 500 residents. Facilities include studying areas/rooms, library, gym, pantries, media rooms (TV and relaxation), multi-purpose function rooms and laundry rooms. The Residence is also open to scholars studying within or outside of the school and serves as the site for the school's boarding programme.\n\nOnly NUS High School students are eligible for the NUS Non-Graduating Programme. Under this programme, NUS High School students are allowed to read any NUS modules and courses from Faculty of Science (including Office of Life Sciences), Faculty of Engineering, Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences (Literature, History, Geography and Economics), and School of Computing, provided that students meet the minimum academic competency level as endorsed by a teacher.\n\nCompleted NUS modules are reflected in the student's transcript but are not included in the computation of their CAP. Should these students be admitted to NUS after graduation from the NUS High School, the module grade and module credit associated with the completed NUS modules can then be included in the computation of their NUS graduation degree/certification requirements and components. Students may also claim course credit for these modules at American universities.\n\nThe library at NUS High School is part of the NUS Library system. This avails the considerable loaning, catalog and transaction resources of NUS Libraries to NUS High School affiliates; NUS Teaching staff can request books located in any other NUS Library and have them transferred to the Library in NUS High School. All NUS High School students are able to obtain and have full electronic access to all journals available at NUSH Libraries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe National Mathematical Olympiad of Singapore is a national mathematical olympiad competition organized by the school in partnership with the Ministry of Education and Singapore Mathematical Society. Through this competition, the school aims to test the pupils attending the test's interest for maths.\n\nThe Singapore Primary Science Olympiad (SPSO) is an annual national competition which has been organized by the NUS High School of Mathematics and Science since 2009. This competition, which is open to Primary 5 pupils in Singapore, comprises the Theory round and the Practical round. Selected participants from the Theory round will be invited to the Practical round held on a later date.\n\nThe annual research congress organised by NUS High School Office of Research, Innovation and Enterprise is held in collaboration with the research programme (Da Vinci Programme). Every year, parents and guests from research organisations (Such as A*STAR, DSTA, DSO, NIE, NUS, etc.) are invited to this event where students' research works are showcased. The school also invites outstanding research projects from other Integrated Programme schools to be showcased alongside those of its own students, to promote collaboration and networking.\n\nSIMC is a mathematical modelling competition co-organised by the NUS High and the Ministry of Education (Singapore), held every two years. In addition to the competition for students, symposiums and workshops are held for participating teachers and principals. Mathematical talents from around the world visit NUS High School for one week in May to sit for a mathematical competition paper, and to showcase their results to a panel of judges.\n\nSAMC is a science competition jointly organised by the school, DSO National Laboratories, and the Science Centre Singapore. Teams construct a complex machine (the Amazing Machine) that performs a seemingly simple task in as many steps as possible. Teams will be judged on their creativity and the incorporation of scientific concepts in the machines.\n\nThe SDYC is a student-initiated event, running since 2009, which aims to raise awareness of social, economic, political and environmental issues revolving around the central theme of sustainable development. The three day convention brings together Secondary 2 to JC2 students across Singapore, providing a platform for students to raise their concerns and share their insights, as well as to foster cooperation among teams in reaching a resolution on these global issues. In 2019, SDYC committees included UNFPA, UNWTO, AU, USS, UNSC, UNCOPUOS and a Joint Cabinet Crisis Committee. This was complemented by a novel intra-conference press system where delegates role played as journalists from international news agencies. Participants will be exposed to and encouraged to ponder about the interplay between scientific developments and public policy. In 2019, an eminent diplomat, Mr Bilahari Kausikan, was invited as the Guest of Honor.\n\nIn collaboration with MOE Gifted Education Programme Branch, the school organizes the annual Primary 4 Math Carnival. It aims to generate interest in mathematics amongst Primary school students. Around 2000 Primary 4 students from all primary schools around Singapore participate. The theme of the Carnival is “Math Alive!” where the use of mathematics in science and everyday life is highlighted. A Mathematics Project Competition is given to all schools who participate.\n\nThe school has a large Chinese majority, because Singapore's population is largely Chinese. The Primary School Leaving Examination scores of students admitted from primary school through the examination via the PSLE admission phase are mostly in the 260-285 range whereas those admitted through Direct School Admission have more varying PSLE scores, but still largely in the 270s range. There are also many foreign students, mostly from Malaysia, Vietnam, Korea or China from Year 3 as the school aims to have a 20% foreign enrollment.\n\nStudents are admitted to the school at Year 1 or Year 3 after a selection process comprising tests and group activities in which they are assessed for their understanding and passion in mathematics and the sciences. The school attracts the top 10% of Singapore's national cohort of primary school students. Annually, it receives around 2000 applications for 170 places from both local and international students for its Year 1 admissions. Competition for the 20 Year 3 places is equally strong with an acceptance rate of about 6%.\n\nPupils are assessed by one or more of the following indicators:\n\n"}

{"id": "1833803", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1833803", "title": "Haunting Ground", "text": "Haunting Ground\n\nHaunting Ground, known in Japan as is a survival horror video game developed and published by Capcom for the PlayStation 2 in 2005. The story follows Fiona Belli, a young woman who wakes up in the dungeon of a castle after being involved in a car accident. She quickly befriends a White Shepherd, Hewie, and begins to explore the castle with his aid to seek a means of escape and unravel the mysteries of it and its inhabitants. The game shares many similarities with Capcom's earlier survival horror title \"Clock Tower 3\" (2002), and has been described as a spiritual successor to the \"Clock Tower\" series.\n\nThe player controls Fiona as she explores the environment, evades and hides from enemy pursuers, and occasionally fights against the castle's inhabitants. Sometimes Fiona will panic when in danger, in which case she begins to run on her own and the player loses some control. Hewie is a central part to the gameplay, and accompanies Fiona throughout the game. He can be given orders to explore the environment, attack enemies, and otherwise aid in Fiona's survival. Capcom added the dog mechanic during development thinking retailers and players alike would not enjoy a survival horror title with a lone female protagonist. \n\n\"Haunting Ground\" was first revealed in September 2004, and was released next April garnering mixed to average reviews. The graphics and presentation were praised, but critics found the gameplay somewhat repetitive, predictable, and derivative of previous horror titles. The game's voyeuristic nature and the sexual objectification of Fiona were highlighted by critics as some of the game's best elements. They felt that by exposing Fiona as a vulnerable object of desire, the game makes her and therefore the player feel more fragile and endangered, building a more disturbing atmosphere. The fluctuating degree of player control over Fiona has made \"Haunting Ground\" a key subject in the study of avatars and their relationship with players in video games.\n\n\"Haunting Ground\" is a survival horror game with similar gameplay elements to \"Clock Tower 3\" (2002). The player controls Fiona Belli directly and gives commands to her canine companion, Hewie. Fiona can run and perform a backstep maneuver, both of which reduce stamina. She can also crouch down to hide from enemy pursuers. Fiona can kick and tackle enemies as well, but tackling also reduces stamina. Losing too much stamina will result in Fiona becoming exhausted, causing her movements to slow down or possibly stop altogether. Exhaustion can be revived with certain items or with time. Fiona can interact with the environment by checking items, opening doors, and climbing ladders. The player can utilize hiding spots to evade pursuers. Other areas act as retaliation points that allow Fiona to use her environment to counterattack against her enemy, although some of these locations can only be used once.\n\nCommanding Hewie is an integral part of \"Haunting Ground\"'s gameplay. At the beginning of the game, he won't be completely friendly and obey all of Fiona's commands. The player has to build a friendship and gain his trust in order to survive the game. Hewie can be told to sniff out items, check suspicious areas or items, attack an enemy, or called back to Fiona's side. The player can praise Hewie by petting and feeding him, both of which can heal his vitality. Likewise, he can be scolded when he won't listen to commands. He can be told to \"stand ready\" before attacking, which increases his attack power.\n\nEnemies can hear footsteps and other sounds. When Fiona is in a dangerous situation, she may fall into a panic. During panic mode, visibility gets worse, the menu can't be opened, and she will begin running on her own, tripping and falling into walls. Panic mode will elapse after some time, or certain items can be used to calm her down. There are glowing orbs called \"Luminescents\", which will put Fiona in a state of panic and attract enemies to her. If Fiona sustains a significant amount of damage, she will slow down and become unable to backstep. If she receives too much damage she can die. Damage heals with time or items can be used to bring her vitality back to normal. While some items are used to heal Fiona and Hewie, others are used to damage enemies. Some can be thrown while others are set like traps for the enemy to walk over. Some items are found by searching while others can be crafted in refining rooms.\n\nFiona Belli is an 18-year-old girl who recently moved to college. While visiting her parents, she is involved in a car accident, and awakens in a cage in the dungeon of a castle. Her memories of the incident are hazy. Noting that the cage that keeps her prisoner has been left unlocked, she steps out and begins searching for answers and a way out of the castle. Soon after, she befriends a White Shepherd named Hewie. As Fiona begins to unravel the mystery in which she finds herself, she learns that she is the carrier of the Azoth, an alchemic element, which for unknown reasons is being sought by Riccardo, the castle's keeper.\n\nThe first enemy Fiona encounters is Debilitas, a large, mentally disabled groundskeeper who thinks of Fiona as one of his dolls. Fiona learns from a mysterious man named Lorenzo, that to escape the castle, she needs a staff from the chapel. However, upon taking the staff, Debilitas corners Fiona and Hewie, forcing a confrontation. They defeat Debilitas, but soon find their next enemy, Daniella, an icy maid. Daniella covets Fiona's ability to smell, taste, touch, feel, and \"experience pleasure.\" She is especially jealous that Fiona can create life (via a fertile womb). Daniella is defeated when she is impaled with a shard from a ceiling window pane.\n\nThe third villain is Riccardo, who wields a flintlock pistol. For the majority of the game, Riccardo keeps his face hidden under a hood. Upon revealing himself however, Fiona is shocked to see her dead father's face. Riccardo reveals that he and her father, Ugo, are clones. He murdered Ugo in the car accident as revenge for leaving the castle and marrying Fiona's mother. He plans to use Fiona (by means of her womb and use of her Azoth) to bring about his own rebirth, so that he may live forever. As they fight atop a water tower, Hewie rescues Fiona by attacking Riccardo, causing him to fall from the summit.\n\nThe final enemy is Lorenzo, who seemed to be an ally, but who now menaces Fiona in several different forms. Fiona first meets him as an old, crippled man. He tells Fiona that Riccardo was always the problem child, and that he created both Riccardo and Ugo in an attempt to find a body with an Azoth which he could use to gain immortality. Ugo had the Azoth, but left the castle to marry Ayla. Now with Riccardo dead, Lorenzo believes that Fiona is his, so he can take the Azoth she inherited from her father. He chases after Fiona, but she is able to crush him in a rock press. However, she soon encounters a resurrected, youthful Lorenzo; the life energy he acquired from Riccardo's body has allowed him mastery over his own aging process. With the help of Hewie, Fiona causes Lorenzo to fall into a pit of lava. At this point, the castle begins to shake and collapse, and Lorenzo returns as a flaming skeleton. He chases Fiona as she heads for the exit, and attempts to block her escape, but as they reach the door, he finally dies, and Fiona and Hewie leave the castle.\n\nCapcom began development knowing they wanted to make a survival horror game with a lead female character. Believing that the female lead would not bode well with retailers and players alike, they added in a dog partner that could attack enemies. After this change, they further designed the gameplay around this partner mechanic. The cinematics were directed by actor and director, Naoto Takenaka. He directly supervised the motion capture performances used for all the characters, placing emphasis on dramatic performance. He took inspiration from Universal Monsters such as \"Frankenstein\" and Bela Lugosi's \"Dracula\". Takenaka played the motion capture role for Riccardo, and Japanese actors Yasue Sato and Jiro Sato played Fiona and Debilitas respectively. Rather than streaming audio files, the music for \"Haunting Ground\" was generated by using the PS2's built-in sounds. This way, the composers could easily change the tempo of the music during gameplay.\n\nOn September 24, 2004, Capcom debuted \"Haunting Ground\" under its Japanese name \"Demento\" at the Tokyo Game Show after launching a teaser page on their official website two days prior. The game was released in Japan on April 21, 2005, and later in PAL territories on April 29, and in North America on May 10. Critics described the game as a spiritual successor to the \"Clock Tower\" series, although it has never been officially declared as such.\n\nIn July 2012, \"Haunting Ground\" appeared to be slated for a PlayStation 3 re-release as a \"PS2 Classic\", having been rated by the ESRB with Sony Computer Entertainment named as the publisher. On April 21, 2015, it was re-released for the PlayStation 3 via the PlayStation Store exclusively in Japan.\n\n\"Haunting Ground\" received \"mixed or average\" reviews per ratings aggregator Metacritic. Critics were quick to compare it to the \"Clock Tower\" series, specifically its 2002 installment, \"Clock Tower 3\" (2002). The defenseless heroine elements and hide-and-chase gameplay were found to be highly derivative of the former titles. The dog companion was, for some, a well-received addition to the gameplay formula, with Eurogamer's Kristan Reed comparing it positively to \"Ico\". Others found the dog and other gameplay elements to be repetitive and contributors to poor pacing. The graphics, cinematics, and atmosphere were universally praised. The staff at 1UP.com described the environments as \"some of the most detailed, lavish 3D environments Capcom has ever produced.\" Kill Screen's Astrid Budgor compared Haunting Ground's \"psychological landscape\" to Dario Argento's film \"Suspiria\" (1977) and also highlighted its grotesque expressionism. Despite these highlights, critics ultimately felt that \"Haunting Ground\" was too predictable and relied heavily on clichés previously established in the horror genre. For this reason, Reed said it \"becomes stifled by its own eventual lack of ambition to break away from the norms instilled by two generations of Japanese horror adventures.\" The staff at 1UP.com felt the game was dated when compared with the recently released \"Resident Evil 4\" (2005), but said, \"\"Haunting Ground\" isn't without merit, it's just that the merits are buried deep in an occasionally thrilling, mostly 'been there, done that' game of indistinct origin.\"\n\nSome critics highlighted \"Haunting Ground\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s sexual themes surrounding the objectification of Fiona as one of its best elements. Jeremy Dunham of IGN stated that \"\"Haunting Ground\"'s success comes from making the player feel like a desired and endangered object.\" He found the plot was kept interesting due to the disturbing suggestive behaviors of Fiona's pursuers. Kill Screen's Budgor also found the drive for the enemies to kill Fiona creates a continuous tension, as its unclear nature lends to an uncomfortable confusion for both Fiona and the player. GameSetWatch's Leigh Alexander stated that \"disparaging \"Haunting Ground\" for its copious objectification of women is a facile task...it’s precisely that off-putting sexuality that makes Daniela terrifying, that makes Fiona’s circumstances so explicitly repugnant, that sharpens Haunting Ground’s fear factor to a knife in the gut.\" Alexander praised the game's voyeuristic themes and presenting of Fiona as \"an object of desire.\" She notes that \"Fiona is both a sex object and a victim...a fragile little woman...both male and female players can distinctly feel the threat to her person, the disconcerting wickedness of her enemies, thanks to her overt sexualization throughout the game.\" Budgor found that removing the player's control at critical points highlights Fiona's subjectivity, with the sounds and images expressing ideas of \"violation, transgression, and bodily autonomy.\" Alexander ultimately felt \"Haunting Ground\" to be a \"perfect illustration of how sexuality can be used to great effect.\"\n\n\"Haunting Ground\" has been a subject of game studies regarding the relationship between players and their avatars. It was found that the altering states of Fiona's subjectivity change the role of the player in the game. The player is never a spectator, nor do they take on the embodiment of Fiona, but float between these states of involvement.\n\nFiona appeared as a character card in \"SNK vs. Capcom Card Fighters DS\" (2006), and as a costume for Cammy in \"Street Fighter V\". Fiona, Hewie and Debilitas were also seen in a cutscene in \"\".\n\n"}

A demo is a way for a musician to approximate their ideas in a fixed format, such as cassette tape, compact disc, or digital audio files, and to thereby pass along those ideas to record labels, producers, or other artists.\n\nMusicians often use demos as quick sketches to share with bandmates or arrangers, or simply for personal reference during the songwriting process; in other cases, a songwriter might make a demo to send to artists in hopes of having the song professionally recorded, or a publisher may need a simple recording for publishing or copyright purposes.\n\nDemos are typically recorded on relatively crude equipment such as \"boom box\" cassette recorders, small four- or eight-track machines, or on personal computers with audio recording software. Songwriters' and publishers' demos are recorded with minimal instrumentation, usually just an acoustic guitar or piano and the vocals. Both Elton John and Donovan gained studio experience early in their careers by recording publishers' demos for other artists since their managers also handled music publishing, as did Garth Brooks, who was so impressed when recording the demo of \"Friends in Low Places\" that he asked to release the song himself.\n\nMany unsigned bands and artists record demos in order to obtain a recording contract. These demos are usually sent to record labels in hopes that the artist will be signed onto the label's roster and allowed to record a full-length album in a professional recording studio. However, large record labels usually ignore unsolicited demos that are sent to them by mail; artists generally must be more creative about getting the demos into the hands of the people who make decisions for the record company. Many signed bands and artists record demos of new songs before recording an album. The demos may allow the artist to provide sketches for sharing ideas with bandmates, or to explore several alternate versions of a song, or to quickly record many proto-songs before deciding which ones merit further development. Demos may include as few as one or two songs or as many as would be contained on a full-length album.\n\nDemos are seldom heard by the public, although some artists do eventually release rough demos in compilation albums or box sets, such as the album \"Demolicious\" by Green Day. Other demo versions have been unofficially released as bootleg recordings, such as The Beatles' \"Bootleg Demos\" and the Beach Boys' \"Sea of Tunes\" series. Several artists have eventually made official releases of demo versions of their songs as albums or companion pieces to albums, such as Florence and the Machine (\"What the Water Gave Me\", among others) and Cults on the EP \"Sunday Jams\". The event of a demo tape appearing on eBay has happened in the past, with the recordings being leaked onto the internet.\n\nIn rare instances, a demo may end up as the final released recording of a song, as was the case with Foster the People's \"Pumped Up Kicks\". The version of \"Pumped Up Kicks\" that was released as a single and subsequently became a hit was a demo recorded by frontman Mark Foster alone, before he had formed the group. In 1982, Bruce Springsteen recorded ten demo songs in his bedroom that he intended to later record with his E Street Band, but he subsequently decided that he preferred the acoustic demos and released them as the 1982 album \"Nebraska\". \n\nIn more underground forms of music, such as noise music, black metal, or punk, demos are often distributed by bands to fans as self-releases or sold at a very low price. Amateur (and some professional) musicians may choose to make demos available to interested listeners through websites such as SoundCloud or Bandcamp in order to share new ideas, receive feedback and/or provide fans with \"behind the scenes\" access to the songwriting process.\n"}

Written by Antonioni and Tonino Guerra, it was Antonioni's first color film. The story follows a troubled woman (Vitti) living in an industrial region of Northern Italy following a recent automobile accident.\n\n\"Il deserto rosso\" was awarded the Golden Lion at the 25th Venice Film Festival in 1964. It has received acclaim from critics. This was the last in a series of four films he made with Vitti between 1959 and 1964, preceded by \"L'Avventura\" (1960), \"La Notte\" (1961), and \"L'Eclisse\" (1962).\n\nIn Ravenna, Italy, Giuliana (Monica Vitti) is walking with her young son, Valerio, towards the petrochemical plant managed by her husband, Ugo. Passing workers who are on strike, Giuliana nervously and impulsively purchases a half-eaten sandwich from one of the workers. They are surrounded by strange industrial structures and debris that create inhuman images and sounds. Inside the plant, Ugo (Carlo Chionetti) is talking with a visiting business associate, Corrado Zeller (Richard Harris), who is looking to recruit workers for an industrial operation in Patagonia, Argentina. Ugo and Corrado converse comfortably in the noisy factory. Ugo tells Corrado that his wife, Giuliana, had a recent auto accident, and though she was physically unhurt, she has not been right mentally. That night in their apartment, Giuliana becomes highly agitated and fearful over a dream she had about sinking in quicksand. Ugo is unable to calm her or understand what she's experiencing.\n\nAttracted to Giuliana, Corrado visits her at an empty shop she's planning to open and talks about his life and the restless nature of his existence. She accompanies him to Ferrara on one of his worker recruitment drives, and she indirectly reveals details about her mental state. She tells him that when she was in the hospital, she met a young woman patient who was advised by her doctors to find someone or something to love—a husband, a son, a job, even a dog. She speaks of the young woman feeling like there was \"no ground beneath her, like she was sliding down a slope, sinking, always on the verge of drowning.\" They travel to a radio observatory in Medicina, where Corrado hopes to recruit a top worker. Surrounded by cold industrial architecture, Giuliana seems lost in her loneliness and isolation.\n\nThe following weekend, Giuliana, Ugo, and Corrado are walking beside a polluted estuary where they meet up with another couple, Max and Linda, and together they drive to a small riverside shack at Porto Corsini where they meet Emilia. They spend time in the shack engaged in trivial small talk filled with jokes, role-playing, and sexual innuendo. Giuliana seems to find temporary solace in these mindless distractions. A mysterious ship docks directly outside their shack, and as she looks out to the open sea, Giuliana confides to Corrado, \"I can't look at the sea for long or I lose interest in what's happening on land.\" During their conversations, Corrado and Giuliana have grown closer, and he shows interest and sympathy for her. Like Giuliana, Corrado is also alienated, but he is better adapted to and accepting of his environment, telling her, \"You wonder what to look at; I wonder how to live.\" When a doctor arrives to board the ship, Giuliana, seeing that the ship is now quarantined due to an infectious disease, rushes off in a state of panic. Her unwillingness to stay, or to return to the shack to retrieve the purse she left behind, underscores her state of alienation from the others.\n\nSometime later, Ugo leaves on a business trip, and Giuliana spends more time with Corrado, revealing more about her anxieties. One day she discovers that her son has apparently become suddenly paralyzed from the waist down. Fearing he has contracted polio, Giuliana tries to comfort her son with a story about a young girl who lives on an island and swims off a beach at an isolated cove. The girl is at home with her surroundings, but after a mysterious sailing ship approaches offshore, all the rocks of the cove seem to come alive and sing to her in one voice. Soon after, Giuliana discovers to her shock that Valerio was only pretending to be paralyzed. Unable to imagine why her son would do such a cruel thing, Guiliana's sense of loneliness and isolation returns.\n\nDesperate to end her inner turmoil, Giuliana goes to Corrado's apartment where he tries to force his affections on her. Initially resisting Corrado's advances, Giuliana eventually accepts his affections, and the two make love in his bed. The intimacy, however, does little to relieve Giuliana's sense of isolation. The next day, a distraught Giuliana leaves Corrado and wanders to a dockside ship where she meets a foreign sailor and tries to communicate her feelings to him, but he cannot understand her words. Acknowledging the reality of her isolation, she says, \"We are all separate.\" At that point, Giuliana seems to be completely alone and at her lowest state.\n\nSometime later, Giuliana is again walking with her son near her husband's plant. Valerio notices a nearby smokestack emitting poisonous yellow smoke and wonders if birds are being killed by the toxic emissions. Giuliana tells him that the birds have learned not to fly near the poisonous yellow smoke.\n\n\nThe working title of the film was \"Celeste e verde\" (\"Sky blue and green\"). Shooting took place in the following locations:\nThe film is set in the industrial area of 1960s Ravenna with sprawling new post World War Two factories, industrial machinery and a much polluted river valley. The cinematography is highlighted by pastel colors with flowing white smoke and fog. The sound design blends a foley of industrial and urban sounds with ghostly ship horns and an abstract electronic music score by Gelmetti. This was Antonioni's first colour film, which the director said he wanted to shoot like a painting on a canvas:\nAs he would do in later film productions, Antonioni went to great lengths in reaching this goal, such as having trees and grass painted white or grey to fit his take on an urban landscape. Andrew Sarris called the red hued pipes and railings \"the architecture of anxiety: the reds and blues exclaim as much as they explain\".\n\nAnother of Il deserto rosso's innovating technical effect is extentive use of the telephoto and zoom lenses, even in shots where the actor stands relatively close to the camera. Antonioni wrote \"I worked a lot in il deserto rosso with the zoom lens to try and get two dimensional effect, to diminish the distance between people and objects, make them seem flattened against each other. Such flattening contributes to the sense of psychological oppression : Guiliana in several shots seems pinned against the wall and the bars between couples seem part of their body.\"\n\nAntonioni dismissed simple interpretations of the film as a condemnation of industrialism, saying:\nIn 1965, a reviewer for \"TIME\" lauded \"Red Desert\" as \"at once the most beautiful, the most simple and the most daring film yet made by\" Antonioni, and stated that the director \"shows a painterly approach to each frame\". It continues to be viewed favorably. In \"The Daily Telegraph\", Robbie Collin wrote that Antonioni's \"bold, modernist angles and thrillingly innovative use of colour (he painted trees and grass to tone with the industrial landscape) make every frame a work of art\". Jonathan Rosenbaum praised the director's \"eerie, memorable work with the industrial shapes and colors that surround [Giuliana]; she walks through a science fiction landscape dotted with structures that are both disorienting and full of possibilities.\" Richard Brody of \"The New Yorker\" viewed the approach to color as \"greatly responsible for the film’s emotional and intellectual power\" and argued, \"The characters in his movies seem thin because their environment is developed so thickly; yet that environment, he suggests, is, though exterior to them, an inextricable part of them.\"\n\nCitations\n\nBibliography\n\n"}

He spent most of his career with the Utah Jazz of the National Basketball Association (NBA). He played college basketball at the University of Kansas.\n\nOstertag starred at Duncanville High School in Duncanville, Texas, a suburb of Dallas. He averaged 22.5 points and 13 rebounds per game during his senior season, and capped the year by leading the Panthers to the 1991 state championship, the first-ever for the school's boys basketball team.\n\nAfter his successful high school career, Ostertag joined the basketball team at the University of Kansas. Standing 7-foot-2 and weighing 280 pounds, Ostertag provided a strong presence in the paint, helping the Jayhawks reach the NCAA Final Four in 1993. Statistically, his best season was his junior year (1993–94), when he averaged 10.3 points and 8.8 rebounds per game. Most impressive, he set a school record by blocking 97 shots that year. He graduated in 1995 with career totals of 968 points and 770 rebounds, along with 258 blocked shots – the highest total in the history of Kansas and the Big 8 Conference at that time (since surpassed by Jeff Withey).\n\nThe Utah Jazz selected Ostertag with the 28th pick in the first round of the 1995 NBA draft. The Jazz hoped he could fill a void in the team's defense created by the retirement of Mark Eaton a few seasons earlier. Ostertag saw limited action in his rookie year, but emerged as Utah's starting center during his second season. The Jazz made back-to-back appearances in the NBA Finals in 1997 and 1998, with Ostertag providing strong defense in the playoffs against the likes of Hakeem Olajuwon, David Robinson, Tim Duncan, and Shaquille O'Neal.\n\nEnvisioning him as a potentially dominant defender in the future, the Jazz signed Ostertag to a long-term contract extension worth $39 million over six years. However, throughout the remainder of his career, Ostertag struggled with poor physical conditioning and inconsistent play, much to the chagrin of his coaches and teammates. Also, he constantly frustrated Jazz fans with his clumsiness and lack of skill on offense. \nNevertheless, Ostertag made valuable contributions to the team on the defensive side of the floor, providing size and intimidation in the paint. He never played full starter-level minutes, thus hindering his overall statistical totals, but he was one of the most efficient shot-blockers in the league during his career. He led the NBA in blocked shot percentage twice (in 2000 and 2002) and was particularly good at gaining possession of the ball after blocking a shot.\n\nOstertag's contract expired in 2004, making him a free agent in the league. After nine seasons in Utah, he joined the Sacramento Kings. He played one year in Sacramento, before the Kings sent him back to Utah in a \"mega-trade\" that involved five teams and 13 players—the largest trade in NBA history. Ostertag played one final season (2005-06) with the Jazz, seeing limited action. He played his final game on April 19—a home contest against the Golden State Warriors. Having previously announced his retirement, and that game being the last of the season, Ostertag received a standing ovation from Jazz fans. He played 3:36 in the game, all in the first quarter. Fittingly, he blocked a shot and grabbed a rebound—and missed two free throws. The Jazz won the game, giving the team a final record of 41-41 for the year, ensuring that Ostertag retired having never played for a losing team for his entire NBA career.\n\nIn December 2011, Ostertag returned to professional basketball. He signed with the Texas Legends of the NBA Development League. However, after playing 10 games with the Legends, he ended his comeback due to knee injury.\n\nIn 2002, Ostertag donated a kidney to save the life of his sister Amy (Hall) Ostertag, who was dying of kidney disease; upon his return he became the first player in NBA history to play after donating an organ. He has since been an advocate of organ donation.\n\nOstertag lives on a small cattle farm in Mount Vernon, Texas with his wife Shannon. They have one child, daughter Charlestynn (born in 2013). Ostertag also has three children from a previous marriage, son Cody (born in 1993), daughter Bailey (born in 1997), and daughter Shelby (born in 1999).\n\nIn 2014, a prominent Los Angeles based street artist, Ostertag, began using Ostertag's name to promote his art.\n\nOstertag is the co-founder of The Ostertag Group, an umbrella company that owns and operates ML Edwards & Co, Watermelon Mills Coffeehouse, and Ostertag Construction.. Ostertag is also a licensed Realtor® with Century 21 Harvey Properties.\n\n\n"}

His post-war fame as a scholar rested on his effort to separate fiction from facts in his reconstruction of Jesus' life and in his subsequent treatment of the gospel of Matthew. His brother was the ecclesiastical historian and Luther scholar .\n\nBornkamm was a student of Rudolf Bultmann with Ernst Käsemann (Tübingen), Ernst Fuchs (Marburg) and Hans Conzelmann (Göttingen). He developed his studies in Tübingen, Marburg and Göttingen. In 1934 he was appointed professor at the University of Königsberg, but in 1937 the Nazis withdrew his \"venia legendi\" and he had to stop lecturing. He was a pastor in Münster and Dortmund before he was forced, in 1943, to join the Wehrmacht. \n\nFrom 1947 to 1949 Bornkamm was a professor at the University of Göttingen from 1949 to 1971 and professor of New Testament at the University of Heidelberg. He was also a member of the Confederation of Köngener \"(Bund der Köngener)\", a German youth organization created in 1920 out of groups of Protestant Bible circles and disbanded by the Nazi dictatorship in 1934.\n\nGünther Bornkamm was a proponent of the Second Quest for the Historical Jesus (following the Period of \"No Quest\" of Albert Schweitzer). He suggested a tighter relationship between Jesus and the theology of the early church (in contrast to the 'First' and 'No Quest' periods ending in 1953). Numbered among his opponents, Rudolf Bultmann argued for a divorce between the two, but their approaches remain similar in many aspects.\n\nIn his book \"Jesus von Nazareth\" (1956), Bornkamm expressed the profound difficulties of researching the historical Jesus and wished to produce a work that would inform not only professional theologians on the many questions, uncertainties, and findings of historical research, but also the laymen who would wish, so far as possible, to arrive at an historical understanding of the tradition about Jesus and should not be content with edifying or romantic portrayals. He also stated that everyone was so familiar with the Nazarene through Christian tradition, and yet at the same time this very tradition had become strange and unintelligible to many. He affirmed:\n\nIf the journey into this often misty country is to succeed, then the first requirement is the readiness for free and frank questioning, and the renunciation of an attitude which simply seeks the confirmation of its own judgements arising from a background of belief or of unbelief.\nThe work by Ernst Käsemann is also valuable for understanding Bornkamm's work.\n\n"}
{"id": "1833833", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1833833", "title": "Motilin", "text": "Motilin\n\nMotilin is a 22-amino acid polypeptide hormone in the motilin family that, in humans, is encoded by the \"MLN\" gene.\n\nMotilin is secreted by endocrine Mo cells (or M cells, these are not the same as the Microfold cells (M cells) that are in Peyer's patches) that are numerous in crypts of the small intestine, especially in the duodenum and jejunum. It is released into the general circulation in humans at about 100-min intervals during the inter-digestive state and is the most important factor in controlling the inter-digestive migrating contractions; and it also stimulates endogenous release of the endocrine pancreas. Based on amino acid sequence, motilin is unrelated to other hormones. Because of its ability to stimulate gastric activity, it was named \"motilin\". Apart from in humans, the motilin receptor has been identified in the gastrointestinal tracts of pigs, rats, cows, and cats, and in the central nervous system of rabbits.\n\nMotilin was discovered by J.C. Brown when he introduced alkaline solution into duodena of dogs, which caused strong gastric contractions. Brown et al. predicted that alkali could either release stimulus to activate motor activity or prevent the secretion of inhibitory hormone. They isolated a polypeptide as a by-product from purification of secretin on carboxymethyl cellulose. They named this polypeptide \"Motilin\".\n\nMotilin has 22 amino acids and molecular weight of 2698 Daltons. In extract from human gut and plasma, there are two basic forms of motilin. The first molecular form is the polypeptide of 22 amino acids. The second form, on the other hand, is larger and contains the same 22 amino acids as the first form but includes an additional carboxyl-terminus end.\n\nThe sequences of amino acids of motilin is: Phe-Val-Pro-Ile-Phe-Thr-Tyr-Gly-Glu-Leu-Gln-Arg-Met-Gln-Glu-Lys-Glu-Arg-Asn-Lys-Gly-Gln.\n\nThe structure and dynamics of the gastrointestinal peptide hormone motilin have been studied in the presence of isotropic q = 0.5 phospholipid bicelles. The NMR solution structure of the peptide in acidic bicelle solution was determined from 203 NOE-derived distance constraints and six backbone torsion angle constraints. Dynamic properties for the C→H vector in Leu-10 were determined for motilin specifically labeled with C at this position by analysis of multiple-field relaxation data. The structure reveals an ordered alpha-helical conformation between Glu-9 and Lys-20. The N-terminus is also well structured with a turn resembling that of a classical beta-turn. The C dynamics clearly show that motilin tumbles slowly in solution, with a correlation time characteristic of a large object.\n\nControl of motilin secretion is largely unknown, although some studies suggest that an alkaline pH in the duodenum stimulates its release. However, at low pH it inhibits gastric motor activity, whereas at high pH it has a stimulatory effect. Some studies in dogs have shown that motilin is released during fasting or interdigestive period, and intake of food during this period can prevent the secretion of motilin. Intravenous injection of glucose, which increases the release of insulin, is also found to inhibit cyclic elevation of plasma motilin. Other studies on dogs have also suggested that motilin acted as endogenous ligand in positive feedback mechanism to stimulate the release of more motilin.\n\nThe main function of motilin is to increase the migrating myoelectric complex component of gastrointestinal motility and stimulate the production of pepsin. Motilin is also called \"housekeeper of the gut\" because it improves peristalsis in the small intestine and clears out the gut to prepare for the next meal. A high level of motilin secreted between meals into the blood stimulates the contraction of the fundus and antrum and accelerates gastric emptying. It then contracts the gallbladder and increases the squeeze pressure of the lower esophageal sphincter. Other functions of motilin include increasing the release of pancreatic polypeptide and somatostatin.\n\nErythromycin and related antibiotics act as non-peptide motilin agonists, and are sometimes used for their ability to stimulate gastrointestinal motility. In the case of erythromycin, it is its hemiketal intermediate, formed after an oral dose in the low-pH environment of the stomach lumen, which directly acts on the motilin receptor. Administration of a low dose of erythromycin will induce peristalsis, which provides additional support for the conclusion that motilin secretion triggers this pattern of gastrointestinal motility, rather than results from it. However, some of erythromycin's properties, including antibiotic activity, are not appropriate for a drug designed for chronic use over a patient's lifetime.\n\nNew motilin agonists are erythromycin-based; however, it may be that this class of drugs becomes redundant. Growth hormone secretagogue receptors share 52% of their DNA with motilin receptors, and agonists of these receptors, termed ghrelins, can bring about similar effects to motilin agonists.\n\nCamicinal is a Motilin agonist under development.\n\nThis domain is also found in ghrelin, a growth hormone secretagogue synthesised by endocrine cells in the stomach. Ghrelin stimulates growth hormone secretagogue receptors in the pituitary. These receptors are distinct from the growth hormone-releasing hormone receptors, and, thus, provide a means of controlling pituitary growth hormone release by the gastrointestinal system.\nErythromycin has an advantage over metoclopramide in gastric emptying due to lack of central nervous system side-effects. It is not approved by FDA to use for gastric emptying. For short duration for patients with diabetes and for those that must clear the stomach for any procedure, it may be used based on the physician's discretion with full understanding that it is not approved by FDA for this use.\n\nGHRL; Motilin;\n\n"}

{"id": "1833842", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1833842", "title": "WeatherStar", "text": "WeatherStar\n\nWeatherStar (sometimes rendered Weather Star or WeatherSTAR; \"STAR\" being an acronym for \"S\"atellite \"T\"ransponder \"A\"ddressable \"R\"eceiver) refers to the technology used by American cable and satellite television network The Weather Channel (TWC) to generate its local forecast segments (currently known under the brand \"Local on the 8s\") on cable and IPTV systems nationwide. The hardware takes the form of a computerized unit installed at a cable system's headend. It receives, generates, and inserts local forecast and other weather information, including weather advisories and warnings, into TWC's national programming.\n\nThe primary purpose of WeatherStar units is to disseminate weather information for local forecast segments on The Weather Channel. The forecast and observation data – which is compiled from the National Weather Service, the Storm Prediction Center and The Weather Channel itself (which began providing forecasts for TWC in 2002 that replaced the National Weather Service's zone forecasts used in the STAR's descriptive forecast product) – is received from the vertical blanking interval of the TWC video feed and from data transmitted via satellite; the localized data is then sent to the unit that inserts the data and accompanying programmed graphics over the TWC feed. The WeatherStar systems are typically programmed to cue the local forecast segments and Lower Display Line at given times. The units are programmed to feature customized segments known as \"flavors,\" which are pre-determined variables in the products displayed during each local forecast segment; this allows certain types of products to be added or removed from the segment depending on the time of broadcast (with the extended forecast usually being exempted from removal), and also allows the reduction or extension of the segment lengths. Flavor lengths previously varied commonly between 30 seconds and two minutes, with some running as long as six minutes during the late 1980s and the mid-1990s; in April 2013, the length of these flavors was changed to a uniform one-minute span.\n\nOutside of the regularly scheduled full-screen graphical segments, weather data is also inserted over the channel's national feed via the Lower Display Line (LDL); the LDL was originally displayed as a text-only overlay over the bottom third of the video feed on older STAR units up to the Weather Star Jr. model, containing no graphical background and only showing current weather observations and monthly precipitation totals for the chosen reporting station (the text LDL was removed when The Weather Channel added an LDL specific to the national feed on March 11, 2010). A semi-translucent background was introduced to the LDL with the release of the Weather Star XL, which added local weather forecasts; the IntelliStar later added air quality indexes, travel forecasts for three cities in the region, traffic information and almanac data among the products it displayed. The LDL used on IntelliStar units was redesigned on November 12, 2013, and began to appear throughout all programming on the national feed (including commercial breaks and telecasts of its long-form programs), while being replaced by a segment rundown/progress bar on the full-screen forecast segments. A sidebar was also paired with the LDL on the right third of the screen, visible only to those watching the channel's high definition simulcast feed, which generates supplementary data (including average delay times for area airports; visibility, dew point and barometric pressure data, which was previously shown on the LDL; air quality forecasts; and almanac data); unlike the LDL, the sidebar is removed during commercial breaks and is only shown during the channel's forecast programming.\n\nAll STAR systems are able to display watches, warnings and advisories issued by the National Weather Service and the Storm Prediction Center for the immediate area where the WeatherStar system's headend is based, which generate a tone as an audible leader to the alert message. Older STAR units up to the WeatherStar 4000 displayed NWS bulletins in the form of a full-screen vertical scroll with differing colored backgrounds (brown for advisories and red for warnings), which was paired with the Lower Display Line. However, the 4000 introduced a horizontal ticker that was restricted to the bottom third of the TWC video feed; since November 12, 2013, IntelliStar models now display alerts over the national feed's headlines ticker placed above the LDL. Test alerts are also generated that are viewable only by cable company technicians performing silent remote administration tests.\n\nThe systems are also capable of generating multiple scrolling text advertisements that appear at the bottom of the screen during local forecast segments, which are programmed into the administrative menus by a locally based technician employed by the provider. STAR units are also capable of generating advertising tags for overlay on national advertisements seen on the national feed, displaying localized addresses for retailers, and on newer models, tagging products seen during breaks (such as pollen reports).\n\nSince its introduction at TWC's launch in May 1982, several generations of the WeatherStar have been used. , two STAR models (the IntelliStar 2 and IntelliStar 2 Jr.) are currently being used by cable and IPTV providers for generation of local weather information on the channel.\n\nThe original WeatherStar system, the Weather Star I, was released upon The Weather Channel's launch. Like subsequent WeatherStar units, it received local weather data from TWC and the National Weather Service, via data encoded in the vertical blanking interval of TWC's video feed, as well as receiving extra data from a subcarrier transmitted above TWC's video and audio signals on its transponder on satellite. The Weather Star I was manufactured and developed for TWC by Salt Lake City, Utah-based Compuvid. A couple of years before TWC was founded, Compuvid had already made a similar product which was installed at the headends of cable television systems owned by TeleCable Corporation, a subsidiary of Landmark Communications, TWC's corporate parent at the time and the channel's founding owner. This system displayed weather conditions, forecasts and announcements via a set of weather sensors locally installed at the cable headend. The Weather Star I was an updated version of this unit, receiving data from both The Weather Channel and the National Weather Service.\n\nThe Weather Star I, like its two subsequent successors, lacked the ability to generate graphics and was only capable of displaying white text on various backgrounds: purple for the \"Latest Observations\" (which displayed current weather conditions for the nearest reporting station and others within a radius of the headend location) and \"Weather Information\" (which displayed random data, usually weather-related trivia, past weather events in the area, or information on upcoming programming) pages, grey for the \"36 Hour Forecast\" page (a descriptive forecast using the National Weather Service's zone forecast products), brown for scrolling weather advisories, and red for scrolling weather warnings. Until the release of the Weather Star III, The Weather Channel used a single one-minute local forecast sequence featuring each of the three above-mentioned forecast screens. As with all future WeatherStar models, the Weather Star I could key its text over TWC's national video feed, most often to display the current conditions at the bottom of the screen.\n\nEven though the Weather Star I met the Federal Communications Commission's Part 15 regulations for emanated RF interference (RFI), it still radiated enough to interfere with VHF channel 2 on the broadcast band, resulting in problems at the cable television system's headend where the Weather Star I unit was installed. This problem was temporarily solved by having ferrite chokes attached to all cables and wires attached to the Weather Star. The Weather Star I was also notorious for frequent text jamming and text garbling issues.\n\nThe Weather Star II was released in 1984; the unit had improved RF shielding to reduce interference issues and had an improved overall hardware design. Otherwise, the unit was similar in its features to the Weather Star I.\n\nThe Weather Star III, released in 1986 as an upgrade to the Weather Star II, was another text-only unit that was essentially identical to the two prior WeatherStar models, though with additional internal improvements and forecast products (and consequently, more local forecast sequences). However, TWC decided to drop one of the products included in the unit, \"Weather Information,\" soon after the introduction of the STAR III.\n\nIn 2001, the FCC granted The Weather Channel a waiver from complying with its forthcoming requirement for aural tones to accompany broadcast of \"scrolled\" or \"crawled\" emergency information, which otherwise went into effect in 2002, for the Weather Star Jr. and Weather Star III. The Weather Star III was capable of generating an aural tone only during the first display of a weather warning, not every time it was shown, as required by the regulations. The waiver, which expired on December 31, 2004, was granted with the understanding that TWC would \"replace the Star IIIs in 2003/2004\". TWC released an \"Audio Weather Alert Enhancement\" for the Weather Star Jr. and Weather Star III in June 2004, so that they would emit \"a series of audible beeps\" every time a tornado warning, flash flood warning or severe thunderstorm warning issued by the National Weather Service was transmitted for insertion over the TWC feed.\n\nThe Weather Star III was retired completely in December 2004. From 1989 to 1992, The Weather Network and its French language sister network MétéoMedia – the Canadian equivalents of TWC – used the Weather Star III units to display local forecasts, which were displayed over a sky blue background, a colour that TWC's units did not use.\n\nThe Weather Star 4000 was the first WeatherStar model capable of displaying graphics. First developed in 1988, it was introduced in early 1990. It was designed and manufactured by Canadian electronics company Applied Microelectronics Institute (now Amirix). The first Star 4000s were programmed to operate in a text-only mode (displayed over stylized graphical backgrounds), similar to the STAR III, but with two improvements: an improved font was introduced, as was a graphical radar product at the end of the local forecast segment, showing precipitation that was occurring in the viewer's local geographic area. The first version was just a static (current) image. A second version was added in the fall of 1992, and was a loop showing radar data logged during the previous 90 minutes. Within a brief period of time, the Weather Star 4000 began to produce graphically based local forecast segments, including maps for the regional observation and forecast products. Until 1995, the Star 4000 incorporated a narration track provided by Dan Chandler into the software, which introduced forecast products presented in each flavor; the tracks could be programmed to play either on certain products or all that were featured during that particular flavor. A customized version of the Weather Star 4000 was used by The Weather Network until 1997, when it switched to a technically different system to disseminate local weather information, known as PMX. Due to the cost of upgrading to more advanced units including the IntelliStar, the Weather Star 4000 remained in use in some smaller communities as late as 2014, although it was already being gradually phased out in some areas in favor of the more recent models at that time.\n\nThe Weather Star Jr. was a budget model manufactured by Wegener Communications for cable headends in smaller communities. Released in 1994 following field testing on eight cable systems in various smaller markets, the system was based on Wegener's Series 2450 graphics display platform, and cost US$500 per unit. It featured the same products used by the Star III, but utilized the typeface used by the 4000. The Weather Channel was able to upgrade Weather Star Jr. units to meet the FCC's 2002 deadline to require broadcasts of \"scrolled\" or \"crawled\" emergency information to be accompanied by an aural tone for accessibility reasons. When the change in FCC regulations forced the retirement of the Star III, headends using that unit upgraded to the Weather Star Jr. or more advanced units.\n\nIn the fall of 1998, the Weather Star XL, the fifth-generation system in the WeatherStar fleet, was introduced. The Star XL, an IRIX-based computer unit manufactured by SGI, had significantly more advanced technical capabilities than the 4000; it incorporated modernized graphics (with Akzidenz-Grotesk as the main typeface) and a new set of weather icons that would be used on the channel for eight years after its launch. Its on-screen appearance was originally based off those used on the channel's program introductions that were introduced shortly beforehand, but were eventually replaced by a graphics set that closely resembled the original graphical design of the WeatherStar's successor, the IntelliStar.\n\nThe Star XL was also the first WeatherStar platform to be adapted and modified by The Weather Channel for use on its sister service Weatherscan, a 24-hour local weather channel carried on select cable systems throughout the country (primarily on digital tiers) that launched in 1999; three years later, the Weatherscan XL units would be phased out for use on Weatherscan (and eventually, on TWC in most large and mid-sized markets) and replaced by the newer IntelliStar technology as part of the first trial of the system. The Star XL model has a high manufacturing cost (US$6,500) and weighs . It was also the first STAR system to utilize Vocal Local, a software function that is technologically different from the narration track used in the WeatherStar 4000, which assembles pre-recorded audio tracks to provide narration of the current temperature and sky conditions, descriptive forecasts and introductions to certain forecast products.\n\nThe XL, along with the WeatherStar 4000 and WeatherStar Jr. systems, were retired when The Weather Channel discontinued transmission of its analog satellite feed on June 26, 2014.\n\nIn February 2003, TWC released an advanced model, IntelliStar, initially being rolled out for use on Weatherscan; the \"domestic\" version intended for use on The Weather Channel was subsequently introduced in early to mid-2004 in the top media markets (including Dallas, Los Angeles, Philadelphia and Pittsburgh). Initially, its graphics were essentially the same as those seen on the WeatherStar XL (though it used Interstate, which was used by TWC for its on-air graphics package at the time, as the typeface instead of Akzidenz-Grotesk) until December 2006, when the IntelliStar received its own, even more realistic icon set – which were used on TWC's on-air and online forecast content as well.\n\nThe amount of weather products provided by the IntelliStar had dramatically increased with the revamp: with the addition of schoolday and daypart forecasts; ultraviolet indexes and other health information; and the introduction of more localized maps for forecasts and radar/satellite imagery. However, most of the products were dropped in April 2013, when the channel uniformally reduced its local forecast segments to one minute (instead of varying between one and two minutes, depending on the segment). Some of the data added was also incorporated into the Lower Display Line, which eventually added a tabbed display for each product. Through a content agreement with Traffic Pulse, traffic information (in the form of accident and construction reports, roadway flow and average travel times for local roadways) was also presented by the IntelliStar in markets in which Traffic Pulse provided traffic data until TWC's agreement with the company expired in 2010.\n\nThe IntelliStar was officially discontinued on November 16, 2015, being replaced by the IntelliStar 2 and IntelliStar 2 Jr.\n\nThe IntelliStar 2 (also known internally as IntelliStar 2 HD) – is the seventh-generation WeatherStar system and the first to be capable of generating forecast graphics in both widescreen and high-definition (specifically, in the channel's 1080i format). The unit originally did not feature any programmed narration, a Lower Display Line or icon animations. When the system was officially released in July 2010, many of the existing issues that were present with the ALPHA were corrected. The fully released version of the IntelliStar 2 features an animated lower display line, and various products including current weather conditions, weather bulletins, three-hour Doppler radar loops for the region and the metropolitan area, a 12-hour forecast graph, and 24-hour descriptive and seven-day forecast graphics. From its release until November 12, 2013, the IntelliStar 2 used a graphics package that differed from the original IntelliStar (before both systems implemented a uniform graphics package, the IntelliStar used graphics based on TWC's 2005 package while the IntelliStar 2 used graphics based on the channel's 2008 graphics). Vocal Local narration is done by TWC meteorologist/storm tracker Jim Cantore, instead of Allen Jackson, who provided the narration track for the first generation IntelliStar and WeatherStar XL.\n\nThe system was gradually rolled out to major U.S. cable providers strictly for use on The Weather Channel's HD simulcast feed, and originally did not replace existing operational STAR units used on The Weather Channel's standard definition feed or Weatherscan; as a result, TWC became one of the few channels which by necessity does not have an \"autotune to HD\" version for providers that utilize set-top boxes allowing HD tuning to standard definition channel positions.\n\nThe IntelliStar 2 Jr., a low-cost digital model suitable for smaller cable providers, was developed and released in 2013. Similar to the first-generation IntelliStar, the unit is capable of operating natively for both analog and digital transmission on cable systems. The Star 2 Jr. was later used as a permanent replacement for all analog WeatherStar systems on June 26, 2014 as a result of the discontinuance of the analog-only units.\n\nThe IntelliStar 2 xD is a model of the IntelliStar 2 Series that was released in late 2014 and early 2015 as a replacement of the original IntelliStar 2. It letterboxes The Weather Channel HD feed in SD and sends the full HD feed to the HD Channel. It was made as a full replacement of the IntelliStar.\n\n"}

The shootout had its roots in an intense rivalry that developed after a group of Comancheros broke away and formed the first Bandidos Motorcycle Club chapter in Australia. Seven people were killed and twenty-eight injured when the two groups clashed at Milperra. The event was a catalyst for significant changes to gun laws in New South Wales.\n\nPolice believe that the war began over turf or drugs or a combination of both. However, both clubs at that time had a strong no drugs policy and Colin \"Caesar\" Campbell, Sergeant-at-Arms of both Comanchero Chapters and Sergeant-at-Arms of the Bandidos after they were patched over, points to the acrimony of the split as the sole reason. According to Campbell, in late 1983, one of his brothers and another Comanchero had called on another member and caught the Comancheros' president (and founder) William George \"Jock\" Ross, in a compromising position with the member's wife. As Sergeant-at-Arms, he ordered Ross to face charges of breaking one of the 10 firm rules the club observed. If found guilty, Ross would have been expelled from the club. Ross failed to appear at the first two scheduled meetings and, after arriving at the third, simply announced that the club would be split into two chapters and walked out. Those who supported bringing charges against Ross, the six Campbell brothers, the three McElwaine brothers, Anthony \"Snodgrass\" Spencer (Snoddy) and Charles \"Charlie\" Sciberras remained at the Birchgrove clubhouse that overlooked Yurulbin Park while Ross and the remaining Comancheros set up a new clubhouse in Harris Park.\n\nDuring the club's 1983 Christmas run fighting broke out between the two Chapters, prompting the Birchgrove chapter to break away and form a new club. Spencer had visited several outlaw clubs in America two years earlier and remembered how much respect U.S Bandidos showed to him, so he contacted their National President Ronnie Hodge. After much correspondence, he received approval to form the first Australian Bandidos chapter and become its national president. The new Bandidos members then incinerated their Comanchero colours in a ceremonial act. Clubhouse attacks and other violence continued until August when Campbell alleged that Spencer and Ross \"declared war\" in a phone call.\n\nAn advertisement for a British motorcycle club swap meet was placed in a few local press releases, to be held at the Viking Tavern, with a scheduled start at 10 am on Sunday, 2 September 1984. On that day at around 1 pm, 19 armed Comancheros entered the car park of the Viking Tavern during the swap meet and took up positions in hiding. Using walkie-talkies for communication, Comanchero leader \"Jock\" Ross, a military enthusiast, intended to stand in the open to give the appearance he was alone, hoping to draw the Bandidos into a pincer movement that was based on the \"Bullhorn Ambush\" that he read had been used in the Second Boer War. However, he was distracted by the presence of members of a rival club the Mobshitters and went to the back of the tavern to ensure they were not going to get involved.\n\nThe Bandidos were late and thinking that they were not coming, some of the Comancheros went into the Viking Tavern bar. Approximately 20 minutes later, 34 equally armed Bandidos members arrived. Caught off guard, the Comancheros were scattered around the car park when the Bandidos arrived. The Bandidos pulled up in a group at the western end of the car park and, after distributing guns and other weapons, moved to confront the Comancheros president. The initial confrontation between the clubs was verbal, involving the brandishing of \"non-lethal\" weapons and challenges to drop the guns and settle it like men, but ended with the accidental discharge of a shotgun into the air. The involuntary discharge was the catalyst for pitched battle involving fists, guns and other weapons. Contrary to some newspaper reports, there was no charge toward one another, nor were formal battle lines drawn. Although never mentioned by the media or charged, several wives and girlfriends of the club members took part. Once the first shot was fired, it evolved into a series of bashings and kickings with sporadic gunfire. Bandido member Gregory \"Shadow\" Campbell was shot in the throat by a shotgun and died instantly. Because of the number of charges this man’s own brother was charged with the murder. Bandidos vice president Mario \"Chopper\" Cianter was shot twice in the chest with a shotgun and died instantly. After realising he'd been caught off guard and not having had the chance to set up a formal battle plan, Jock Ross ran from the back of the tavern holding a machete in one hand and a pick handle in the other. Almost immediately he was hit in the foot by shotgun pellets. Staggering on he was then hit again in the head and chest and collapsed.\n\nPolice responded after receiving reports that a man had gone berserk with a rifle at the Viking Tavern in Milperra and shots had been fired. The fighting continued for at least 10 minutes while police helicopters circled overhead with members of the public fleeing to the tavern and nearby properties as soon as the shooting started. The first of more than 200 police arrived 15 minutes after the fighting ended and cordoned off the area. Two Comancheros had died from shotgun wounds, another two Comancheros died after being shot with a Rossi .357 Magnum rifle, two Bandidos died from shotgun wounds and a 14-year-old bystander, Leanne Walters, also died after being hit in the face by a stray .357 bullet. A further 28 people were wounded with 20 requiring hospitalisation. Bandidos sergeant-at-arms, Colin \"Caesar\" Campbell, was shot six times and spent six weeks in intensive care before checking himself out. Four shotgun pellets remained in his body which were dug out by his wife before he fled to Western Australia. Campbell later claimed that the wife of one of the Comancheros had shot him several times with a handgun.\n\nMark Pennington, one of the first police officers on the scene, was later awarded $380,000 (2011: $1,026,500) compensation for psychological damage. Bandido Member John \"Whack\" Campbell never fully recovered from the injuries he received and in 1987 died in jail from complications. Jock Ross suffered a brain injury after being shot in the head. He lost much of his vision as well as the ability to read and write. The Viking Tavern has since been renamed the Mill Hotel.\n\nThe court case following the \"Milperra Massacre\" was at the time one of the largest in Australian history. In total 43 people were originally charged with seven counts of murder under the doctrine of \"common purpose\" however, charges against 10 were dropped before trial and Bernard \"Bernie\" Podgorski, secretary of the Bandidos, was granted immunity after turning Queen's Evidence.\nSolicitor Christopher Murphy acted for the Bandidos' members charged as a result of the incident. Greg James QC, as he then was, represented all but one of the Bandidos' members during their trial, that being Colin Campbell. Greg James QC was Juniored by a number of Juniors including John Korn, Kenneth Rosin, Andrew Martin, and Philip Young. Mr. Campbell was represented by Mr Greg Woods QC, as he then was. Anthony \"Snoddy\" Spencer, the Bandidos National President, hanged himself in prison before he could stand trial. Michael Alan Viney QC was the lead Crown Prosecutor for the committal hearing and the trial.\n\nDuring the longest joint criminal trial in New South Wales history, 58 policemen provided security including armed members of the Tactical Operations Unit who were stationed in the courtroom and witnesses required armed guards from the Witness Security Unit to escort them home. With 31 accused, each by law able to reject 20 jurors without giving a reason, 1,500 jurors were called up and housed at the Penrith Leagues Club to await selection. The first day of selection saw only five jurors accepted from 208 presented, the following day it was found that two were ineligible with justice Roden dismissing all five and ordering that jury selection begin again. Eventually some 1,000 jurors were presented before 12 were found acceptable to sit on the case. More than two years later, on 12 June 1987, the jury delivered 63 murder convictions, 147 manslaughter convictions and 31 of affray. The judge in the case named the instigator of the violence as William \"Jock\" Ross, the \"supreme commander\" of the Comancheros, saying \"Ross was primarily responsible for the decision that members of his club go to Milperra in force and armed\".\n\nRoss received a life sentence for his role in the violence. Four other members of the Comancheros gang received life sentences for murder and 16 Bandidos received sentences of seven years for manslaughter. As the Bandidos arrested were charged in regards to all the deaths, this resulted in Colin Campbell being found guilty of the manslaughter of his own brother. Another Campbell brother, John \"Wack\" Campbell, died three years later from the injuries he received that day. Commonwealth Games gold medallist boxer Philip \"Knuckles\" McElwaine was found guilty only of affray, he was the only motorcycle club member to be acquitted of the manslaughter and murder charges that were brought against him. In 1989, three Comancheros successfully appealed their murder convictions with the charge quashed and reduced to manslaughter. In 1992, Ross was the last to be released after serving five years and three months.\n\nThe Comancheros were notorious for carrying registered shotguns openly while riding. As a result of the massacre, the \"New South Wales Firearms and Dangerous Weapons Act 1973\", which allowed registered owners the right to carry firearms in public, was subsequently amended to require \"a good reason for the issue of a [firearm] licence\".\n\nIn a repetition of the circumstances that led to the Milperra massacre, in early 2007 more than 60 members of the Parramatta and Granville chapters of the Nomads, previously affiliated with the Comancheros, defected to the Bandidos. The defection resulted in a new eruption of violence between the Comancheros and Bandidos involving fire-bombings and drive-by shootings. New South Wales Police set up Operation Ranmore to stop the violence escalating, which resulted in 340 people arrested on 883 charges as of January 2008.\n\nIn 2002, Australian film maker Martin Brown produced a documentary titled \"1% One Percenters Search For A Screenplay\" in an effort to raise interest for a big budget movie of the massacre. The documentary, first aired on 2 February 2003, follows Brown as he looks for screenwriters, funds and a director for his movie. It includes interviews with the police investigating officer, former superintendent Ron Stephenson, Comanchero president \"Jock\" Ross, Bandido vice president \"Bullets\" and several other Milperra survivors.\n\nA television mini-series \"\", based on the book \"Brothers in Arms\" by Lindsay Simpson and Sandra Harvey, screened on Australias Network Ten in May 2012. The screenplay was written by Greg Haddrick, Roger Simpson and Jo Martino. It is directed by Peter Andrikidis. It stars Callan Mulvey, Matthew Nable, Susie Porter, Maeve Dermody, Anthony Hayes, Todd Lasance, Luke Ford, Jeremy Lindsay Taylor, Damian Walshe-Howling, Nathaniel Dean and Luke Hemsworth. Colin \"Caesar\" Campbell has criticized the series for a lack of consultation with those who were there, its incorrect chronology of events, errors in motives and the portrayal of \"lazy stereotypes\".\n\n\n"}

These extensions were created by Microsoft to allow C++ code to be targeted to the Common Language Runtime (CLR) in the form of managed code, as well as continue to interoperate with native code.\n\nIn 2004, the Managed C++ extensions were significantly revised to clarify and simplify syntax and expand functionality to include managed generics. These new extensions were designated C++/CLI and included in Microsoft Visual Studio 2005. The term \"Managed C++\" and the extensions it refers to are thus deprecated and superseded by the new extensions.\n\nMicrosoft introduced Managed Extensions for C++ in Microsoft Visual C++ 2002 (MSVC++). Microsoft attempted to minimise the deviations between standard C++ and Managed Extensions for C++, resulting in core differences between the two being syntactically obscured. MSVC++ 2003 and 2005 also provided support for writing programs in Managed C++. In 2004, Managed Extensions for C++ was deprecated in favor of C++/CLI, a second attempt by Microsoft at supporting programming for the Common Language Infrastructure using C++.\n\n\"Managed\" refers to managed code that it is run in, or \"managed\" by, the .NET virtual machine that functions as a sandbox for enhanced security in the form of more runtime checks, such as buffer overrun checks. Additionally, applications written in Managed C++ compile to CIL—Common Intermediate Language—and not directly to native CPU instructions like standard C++ applications do.\n\nManaged C++ code could inter-operate with any other language also targeted for the CLR such as C# and Visual Basic .NET as well as make use of features provided by the CLR such as garbage collection. This means Managed C++ occupies a unique position in the gallery of .NET languages. It is the only language that can communicate directly with .NET languages (such as C#, VB.NET) as well as native C++. The other .NET languages can only communicate with C++ code via PInvoke or COM. But since Managed C++ can communicate directly in both managed and standard C++ contexts, it is often used as a \"bridge\".\n\nPrograms coded in Managed C++ provide additional functionality of the .NET Framework and the CLR. Most notable of these is garbage collection, which relieves the programmer of manual memory management. The garbage collector (GC) is handled by the CLR. Memory management is executed quite quickly, but for more performance critical applications, native, unmanaged code is most likely the preferred option.\n\nManaged C++ is geared towards object-oriented programming. A major difference between standard C++ and Managed C++ is that multiple inheritance is not supported, and a class managed under the CLR's garbage collector cannot inherit more than one class. This is because of a limitation of the CLR.\n\nKey features:\n\n\n\n\nThe following examples depict the use of Managed C++ as compared to standard C++:\n\n//hello.cpp\n\n//new using directive\n\n//another using namespace directive.\nusing namespace System;\n\nint main()\n\nA new preprocessor directive\n\n\nis required. In addition to that, more #using directives are required to import more libraries to use more namespaces in the Base Class Library, such as\n\n\nand\n\nusing namespace System::Windows::Forms;\n\nto use Windows Forms.\n\n\n/clr enables any code referencing the .NET Framework to be compiled as CIL.\n\n//gc.cpp\n\n\nint main()\n\nThe preceding code can be compiled and executed without any fear of memory leaks. Because class codice_2 is managed under the garbage collector, there is no need to call the codice_3 operator. To achieve the same with unmanaged code, the codice_3 keyword is required:\n//nogc.cpp\n\nclass gc\n\nint main()\n\nNotes:\npublic __gc class hey { };\n\nthe public keyword to modify the access of the a __gc designated class.\n\nA __gc designated class can be destroyed manually using the delete keyword, but only if the __gc designated class has a user-defined destructor.\n\n//interface.cpp\n\n__gc __interface ClassBase\n\nThe preceding code must be compiled with /clr and /LD to produce a simple DLL file.\n\nNotes:\n\nThe following contains main points and programmatic standards that differ between Managed C++ and other well known programming languages that are similar in concept.\n\nDisadvantages\n\npublic __gc class one { int i; };\npublic __gc class two: private one { int h; i = h; }; // error\npublic __gc class three: protected one { int h; i=h;}; // error\n\n\n__gc class a {};\n__gc class b {};\n__gc class c: public a, public b {}; //will produce an error\nAdvantages\n\nDifferences\n\nDisadvantages\n\nAdvantages\n\nDifferences\n\nDisadvantages\n\nAdvantages\n\n\n"}

Such systems occur as the general form of (systems of) differential equations for vector–valued functions \"x\" in one independent variable \"t\",\nwhere formula_2 is a vector of dependent variables formula_3 and the system has as many equations, formula_4.\nThey are distinct from ordinary differential equation (ODE) in that a DAE is not completely solvable for the derivatives of all components of the function \"x\" because these may not all appear (i.e. some equations are algebraic); technically the distinction between an implicit ODE system [that may be rendered explicit] and a DAE system is that the Jacobian matrix formula_5 is a singular matrix for a DAE system. This distinction between ODEs and DAEs is made because DAEs have different characteristics and are generally more difficult to solve.\n\nIn practical terms, the distinction between DAEs and ODEs is often that the solution of a DAE system depends on the derivatives of the input signal and not just the signal itself as in the case of ODEs; this issue is commonly encountered in systems with hysteresis, such as the Schmitt trigger.\n\nThis difference is more clearly visible if the system may be rewritten so that instead of \"x\" we consider a pair formula_6 of vectors of dependent variables and the DAE has the form\n\nA DAE system of this form is called \"semi-explicit\". Every solution of the second half \"g\" of the equation defines a unique direction for \"x\" via the first half \"f\" of the equations, while the direction for \"y\" is arbitrary. But not every point \"(x,y,t)\" is a solution of \"g\". The variables in \"x\" and the first half \"f\" of the equations get the attribute \"differential\". The components of \"y\" and the second half \"g\" of the equations are called the \"algebraic\" variables or equations of the system. [The term \"algebraic\" in the context of DAEs only means \"free of derivatives\" and is not related to (abstract) algebra.]\n\nThe solution of a DAE consists of two parts, first the search for consistent initial values and second the computation of a trajectory. To find consistent initial values it is often necessary to consider the derivatives of some of the component functions of the DAE. The highest order of a derivative that is necessary for this process is called the \"differentiation index\". The equations derived in computing the index and consistent initial values may also be of use in the computation of the trajectory. A semi-explicit DAE system can be converted to an implicit one by decreasing the differentiation index by one, and vice versa.\n\nThe distinction of DAEs to ODEs becomes apparent if some of the dependent variables occur without their derivatives. The vector of dependent variables may then be written as pair formula_6 and the system of differential equations of the DAE appears in the form\nwhere\n\nAs a whole, the set of DAEs is a function\n\nInitial conditions must be a solution of the system of equations of the form\n\nThe behaviour of a pendulum of length \"L\" with center in \"(0,0)\" in Cartesian coordinates \"(x,y)\" is described by the Euler–Lagrange equations\nwhere formula_26 is a Lagrange multiplier. The momentum variables \"u\" and \"v\" should be constrained by the law of conservation of energy and their direction should point along the circle. Neither condition is explicit in those equations. Differentiation of the last equation leads to\nrestricting the direction of motion to the tangent of the circle. The next derivative of this equation implies\nand the derivative of that last identity simplifies to formula_29 which implicitly implies the conservation of energy since after integration the constant formula_30 is the sum of kinetic and potential energy.\n\nTo obtain unique derivative values for all dependent variables the last equation was three times differentiated. This gives a differentiation index of 3, which is typical for constrained mechanical systems.\n\nIf initial values formula_31 and a sign for \"y\" are given, the other variables are determined via formula_32, and if formula_33 then formula_34 and formula_35. To proceed to the next point it is sufficient to get the derivatives of \"x\" and \"u\", that is, the system to solve is now\n\nThis is a semi-explicit DAE of index 1. Another set of similar equations may be obtained starting from formula_37 and a sign for \"x\".\n\nDAEs also naturally occur in the modelling of circuits with non-linear devices. Modified nodal analysis employing DAEs is used for example in the ubiquitous SPICE family of numeric circuit simulators. Similarly, Fraunhofer's Analog Insydes Mathematica package can be used to derive DAEs from a netlist and then simplify or even solve the equations symbolically in some cases. It is worth noting that the index of a DAE (of a circuit) can be made arbitrarily high by cascading/coupling via capacitors operational amplifiers with positive feedback.\n\nDAE of the form\nare called semi-explicit. The index-1 property requires that \"g\" is solvable for \"y\". In other words, the differentiation index is 1 if by differentiation of the algebraic equations for \"t\" an implicit ODE system results,\nwhich is solvable for formula_40 if formula_41\n\nEvery sufficiently smooth DAE is almost everywhere reducible to this semi-explicit index-1 form.\n\nTwo major problems in solving DAEs are \"index reduction\" and \"consistent initial conditions\". Most numerical solvers require ordinary differential equations and algebraic equations of the form\n\nIt is a non-trivial task to convert arbitrary DAE systems into ODEs for solution by pure ODE solvers. Techniques which can be employed include \"Pantelides algorithm\" and \"dummy derivative index reduction method\". Alternatively, a direct solution of high-index DAEs with inconsistent initial conditions is also possible. This solution approach involves a transformation of the derivative elements through \"orthogonal collocation on finite elements\" or \"direct transcription\" into algebraic expressions. This allows DAEs of any index to be solved without rearrangement in the open equation form\n\nOnce the model has been converted to algebraic equation form, it is solvable by large-scale nonlinear programming solvers (see APMonitor).\n\nSeveral measures of DAEs tractability in terms of numerical methods have developed, such as \"differentiation index\", \"perturbation index\", \"tractability index\", \"geometric index\", and the \"Kronecker index\".\n\nWe use the formula_44-method to analyze a DAE. We construct for the DAE a signature matrix formula_45, where each row corresponds to each equation formula_46 and each column corresponds to each variable formula_47. The entry in position formula_48 is formula_49, which denotes the highest order of derivative to which formula_47 occurs in formula_46, or formula_52 if formula_47 does not occur in formula_46.\n\nFor the pendulum DAE above, the variables are formula_55. The corresponding signature matrix is\n\n\n\n"}

Three years later, he was employed as a \"mechanical assistant\", and five years after that, as curator of fishes, a post he held until his death.\nMcCulloch collected and published prolifically; from his first paper in 1906 (published in \"Records of the Australian Museum\"), no year passed without his making a contribution to science, and he wrote over 100 original papers in all, many including his own illustrations. McCulloch travelled widely for his collections, including trips to Queensland, Lord Howe Island, New Guinea, the Great Barrier Reef and various Pacific islands. His major research interest was in fish, but he was also given the responsibility of the crustacean collection from 1905 to 1921, and he wrote several significant papers on decapods. In 1922 McCulloch journeyed through Papua with Captain Frank Hurley.

It is part of the \"Dizzy series\". It was published on several platforms, including Sega Mega Drive/Genesis, Sega Master System, Sega Game Gear, Nintendo Entertainment System, Amiga and MS-DOS.\n\nThe game was originally intended to be released in time for Christmas in 1990, but because of a legal action between Codemasters and Nintendo over the Game Genie the title was released in April 1991, making it miss the Christmas rush it was originally slated for. Furthermore, only sold 125,000 units instead of the expected 500,000. Despite this, the game was awarded the 'NES Adventure Game of the Year 1991' by \"Game Players\" Magazine and given the coveted 'Parents Choice Award'.\n\nThe evil wizard Zaks casts a spell on the Yolkfolk and kidnaps Dizzy's girlfriend Daisy. It is up to Dizzy to undo Zaks' doings and rescue Daisy from the castle in the clouds.\n\n\"Fantastic Dizzy\" contains all 16 characters in the series. While most of the Yolkfolk were harmed by Zaks, others have different problems. Other characters include Good Wizard Theodore, Blackheart the Pirate, the Palace Guard, Prince Clumsy, Rockwart the Troll, Shamus the Leprechaun and the Shop Owner.\n\nThere are several places for Dizzy to visit, including the whole complex of the Yolkfolk secret treehouse, the mine, the neighbouring city of Keldor, a pirate ship, a castle, the grasslands, Carber Bay, the cemetery and finally Zaks' Cloud Castle.\n\nThe game generally scrolls horizontally, although some mini-games/sections scroll vertically. When Dizzy climbs a ladder or jumps to an off-screen platform, a new screen is loaded. As game play continues, the scenery cycles between night and day.\n\nThe game is hard to qualify in a genre: while it seems at first a platform game, Dizzy is vulnerable to all enemies while unable to eliminate them, and puzzles are completed by bringing an object to a location (in the same fashion as \"Gods\" and adventure games), and also has to capture all 250 stars scattered in the game. The game can also be seen as a union of all the previous games where the player can find a lot of familiar puzzles (e.g. Elevators, magic beans) and places (e.g. mines, deep sea) as well as several arcade minigames based on older games in the series (like \"Bubble Dizzy\").\n\nDepending on the version of the game, 100 or 250 stars are scattered around the game which must be collected to grant access to the final confrontation with Zaks. While most stars are accessible in the regular parts of the game, some are placed inside the minigames, which forces the player to run through them as many times needed to get all stars. If the player tries to reach the tower without the stars, Dizzy is stunned by the electric door.\n\nDizzy can carry up to three items like keys and objects to be used to solve puzzles. Some objects are meant to be traded to characters, given to characters, or placed in certain locations. Some are used to reach places or things otherwise inaccessible or to protect from danger. This element is similar to the game Puggsy, released for Sega systems.\n\nWhile most of the game is passed in the slower platform sections, there are three minigames required to complete it, plus one to get all the stars.\n\n\n\n\"Entertainment Weekly\" gave the game an A- and wrote that \"Too-cute-for-words Dizzy (an anthropomorphized egg) needs your help to traverse his puzzle-filled kingdom. This game makes you expend IQ points, and the music is funky.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "1833963", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1833963", "title": "Central Artery", "text": "Central Artery\n\nThe Central Artery (officially the John F. Fitzgerald Expressway) is a section of freeway in downtown Boston, Massachusetts; it is designated as Interstate 93, US 1 and Route 3.\n\nThe original Artery, constructed in the 1950s, was named after John F. Fitzgerald; it was partly elevated and partly tunneled. Its reputation for congestion inspired the local nicknames \"The Distressway,\" \"the largest parking lot in the world\", and \"the other Green Monster\" (the paint of the highway girders shared the same color as the left field wall at Fenway Park). The Artery was significantly rerouted during a 10-year period from the mid-1990s through the early 2000s as part of the Central Artery/Tunnel Project (the \"Big Dig\"). The present-day Artery is almost entirely directed through the newly constructed O'Neill Tunnel, while the original Artery was demolished and replaced with the Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy Greenway, named after the daughter of John F. Fitzgerald and the mother of John F. Kennedy.\n\nAccording to Massachusetts Executive Office of Transportation data, the Central Artery runs from the Massachusetts Avenue Connector just beyond Andrew Square in South Boston north to the split with U.S. Route 1 in Charlestown. Along with the harbor tunnels and the Massachusetts Turnpike (I-90) from Route 128 to East Boston, it is part of the Metropolitan Highway System.\n\nThe highway itself was planned as early as the 1920s. The above-ground Artery was built in two sections. First was the part north of High Street and Broad Street to the Tobin Bridge, built between 1951 and 1954. Immediately, residents began to hate the new highway and the way it towered over and separated neighborhoods. Due to this opposition, the southern end of the Central Artery through the South Station area was built underground, through what became known as the Dewey Square Tunnel. Eventually, the entire highway was moved underground as part of the Big Dig Project. The Dewey Square Tunnel was the one part of the original Artery not torn down; it now serves southbound traffic. The idea of building the entire Artery underground was first floated in the 1970s emanating from the central artery depression concept developed by the Boston Transportation Planning Review. The final section through the Dewey Square Tunnel and on to the Southeast Expressway at Massachusetts Avenue opened in 1959.\n\nThe highway gradually became more and more congested as other highway projects meant to complement the Artery were canceled. These included the Inner Belt project, which would have taken through traffic off the Artery and the Massachusetts Turnpike Extension coming in from the west. The Southwest Expressway would have been the route of Interstate 95 from Canton into Boston, and would have tied into the Inner Belt of I-695.\n\nModifications of the above-ground Artery, which was in service until its demolition in 2003 included an additional interchange for the Massachusetts Turnpike (Mass Pike) extension that was completed in 1965, the removal of several on and off-ramps and the reworking in the late 1980s of the Tobin Bridge interchange. The Central Artery North Area (CANA) project placed the above ground ramps from the Artery underground into the City Square Tunnel in Charlestown and resulted in a reworking of the interchange at the north end, placing the northbound offramp from the east side to the west side, and eliminating dangerous weaving across the lanes of the Charlestown High Bridge, which required traffic coming from Storrow Drive and wanting to go to Charlestown to cross three lanes of traffic in only a tenth of a mile.\n\nIn September 2017, a new park was opened beneath the Central Artery adjacent to the Ink Block section of Boston's South End. The $8.5 million park has a dog park, new lighting, boardwalks, murals, and 175 parking spaces. The artwork in the public space was created by street artists from around the United States.\nThe original Central Artery did not have any exit numbers. These were added after the roadway was designated as I-93 in 1974. Many of these exits either do not exist or no longer resemble their original forms. Exits 19, 21, and 25 were completely eliminated. 20 and 26 were separated northbound and southbound; 20 northbound uses the old exit 19 location in South Bay, while southbound begins at the portal to the renovated Dewey Square Tunnel (now completely enclosed by Big Dig construction; 26 northbound begins just shy of the tunnel exit onto the Zakim Bridge, while 26 southbound is located in Charlestown's Sullivan Square near northbound exit 28 at the portal to the double decked section of I-93 and feeds onto the Leverett Circle Connector bridge. 22 continued to exist as an offramp to Chinatown from the southbound (former northbound) Dewey Square tunnel until the ramp was closed off in 2004. 23 exists both northbound and southbound and leads to the Scollay Square area. 24 now exits to Haymarket Square and MA-1A (the Callahan Tunnel). Much of the reconfiguration of on and offramps (particularly the wide separations of the ramps for exits 20 and 26) was done to move exiting traffic off the mainline of the road, reducing stress on the mainline.\n\nThe entire route was in Boston, Suffolk County.\n\nThe entire route is in Boston, Suffolk County.\n\nCurrently, the Artery is numbered I-93 and US 1 on the whole route, and Route 3 on all but the northernmost section–it leaves at Exit 26.\n\nThe Artery has had many different route numbers through its history. When first built, the section between the Sumner Tunnel and Storrow Drive received the numbers C1 and C9 (city routes of US 1 and Route 9), which were rerouted off local streets. The rest of the highway was unnumbered, despite being closely paralleled by C37 south from the Sumner Tunnel.\n\nBy 1969, I-95 was assigned to the whole Artery as part of its never-built route through Boston. The \"C-prefixed\" routes were removed in 1971, with Route C1 becoming part of a realigned US 1, using the Artery between Storrow Drive and the Sumner Tunnel. Additionally in 1971, Route 3 was moved from a bypass around downtown to use the Artery south of Storrow Drive and the Southeast Expressway.\n\nIn 1974, I-95 was canceled through Boston (cancelling its approach from Providence, Rhode Island through the Southwest Corridor) and was instead rerouted around the city using part of Route 128. US 1 was realigned to use the Tobin Bridge and Northeast Expressway, which had been signed as part of I-95; thus US 1 used the Artery north of Storrow Drive. The former alignment of US 1 from Storrow Drive south along the Artery to the Sumner Tunnel became an extended 1A, and I-93 was extended south from Charlestown along the Artery, Southeast Expressway and Route 128 from Braintree to Canton. In 1989, US 1 was moved off the MDC Parkways onto its current alignment along the full Artery. Route 1A was then truncated to the Sumner Tunnel interchange.\n\nSigns put up for the new underground Artery only mention I-93, since it is the best-known designation. Older signs may mention only I-93 and US 1 or I-93 and Route 3. A 2008/2009 project to update this signage helped to clear up this potentially confusing situation.\n\n"}

The \"comic album\" is a very common printed medium. The typical \"album\" is printed in large format, generally with high quality paper and colouring, commonly 24x32 cm (9.4x12.6 in), has around 48–60 pages, but examples with more than 100 pages are common. While sometimes referred to as graphic novels, this term is rarely used in Europe, and is not always applicable as albums often consist of separate short stories, placing them somewhere halfway between a comic book and a graphic novel. The European comic genres vary from the humorous adventure vein, such as \"The Adventures of Tintin\" and \"Asterix\", to more adult subjects like \"Tex Willer\", \"Diabolik\", and \"Thorgal\".\n\nThe roots of European on-paper comics date back to 18th century caricatures (mocking others styles or behaviors) and illustrated picture books such as Wilhelm Busch's Max and Moritz. The early 19th century Swiss artist Rodolphe Töpffer is regarded by many as the \"father of the modern comic\" and his publication \"Histoire de M. Vieux Bois\" is sometimes called the first \"comic book\". Franco-Belgian comics, Spanish comics, and Italian comics are historically amongst the dominant scenes of European comics.\n\nEarlier, paintings, depicting stories in subsequent frames, using descriptive text resembling bubbles-text, were used in murals, one such example written in Greek, dating to the 2nd century, found in Capitolias, today in Jordan.\n\nA number of festivals celebrating comic art are held around Europe.

{"id": "1833981", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1833981", "title": "200 metres", "text": "200 metres\n\nThe 200 metres (also spelled 200 meters) is a sprint running event. On an outdoor race 400 m track, the race begins on the curve and ends on the home straight, so a combination of techniques are needed to successfully run the race. A slightly shorter race, called the \"stadion\" and run on a straight track, was the first recorded event at the ancient Olympic Games. The 200 m places more emphasis on speed endurance than shorter sprint distances as athletes predominantly rely on anaerobic energy system during the 200 m sprint. Similarly to other sprint distances, the 200 m begins from the starting blocks. When the sprinters adopt the 'set' position in the blocks they are able to adopt a more efficient starting posture and isometrically preload their muscles. This enables them to stride forwards more powerfully when the race begins and start faster.\n\nIn the United States and elsewhere, athletes previously ran the 220-yard dash (201.168 m) instead of the 200 m (218.723 yards), though the distance is now obsolete. The standard adjustment used for the conversion from times recorded over 220 yards to 200 m times is to subtract 0.1 seconds, but other conversion methods exist. Another obsolete version of this race is the 200 metres straight, which was run on tracks that contained such a straight. Initially, when the International Amateur Athletic Association (now known as the International Association of Athletics Federations) started to ratify world records in 1912, only records set on a straight track were eligible for consideration. In 1951, the IAAF started to recognise records set on a curved track. In 1976, the straight record was discarded.\n\nThe race attracts runners from other events, primarily the 100 metres, wishing to double up and claim both titles. This feat has been achieved by men eleven times at the Olympic Games: by Archie Hahn in 1904, Ralph Craig in 1912, Percy Williams in 1928, Eddie Tolan in 1932, Jesse Owens in 1936, Bobby Morrow in 1956, Valeriy Borzov in 1972, Carl Lewis in 1984, and most recently by Jamaica's Usain Bolt in 2008, 2012, and 2016. The double has been accomplished by women seven times: by Fanny Blankers-Koen in 1948, Marjorie Jackson in 1952, Betty Cuthbert in 1956, Wilma Rudolph in 1960, Renate Stecher in 1972, Florence Griffith-Joyner in 1988, and Elaine Thompson in 2016. Marion Jones finished first in both races in 2000 but was later disqualified and stripped of her medals after admitting to taking performance-enhancing drugs. An Olympic double of 200 m and 400 m was first achieved by Valerie Brisco-Hooks in 1984, and later by Michael Johnson from the United States and Marie-José Pérec of France both in 1996. Usain Bolt is the only man to repeat as Olympic champion, Bärbel Wöckel (née Eckert) and Veronica Campbell-Brown are the two women who have repeated as Olympic champion.\n\nThe men's world record holder is Usain Bolt of Jamaica, who ran 19.19 s at the 2009 World Championships. The women's world record holder is Florence Griffith-Joyner of the United States, who ran 21.34 s at the 1988 Summer Olympics. The reigning Olympic champions are Usain Bolt and Elaine Thompson (JAM). The reigning World Champions are Noah Lyles (USA) and Dina Asher-Smith (GBR).\n\nRaces run with an aiding wind measured over 2.0 metres per second are not acceptable for record purposes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated 22 October 2019.\n\n\n\n\n"}

After a voyage which had got no further than Iceland, Cabot left again with only one vessel, the \"Matthew\", a small ship (50 tons), but fast and able. The crew consisted of only 18 men. \"The Matthew\" departed 2 May 1497. He sailed to Dursey Head (latitude 51°36N), Ireland, from where he sailed due west, expecting to reach Asia. However, landfall was reached in North America on 24 June 1497. His precise landing place is a matter of much controversy, with Cape Bonavista or St. John's in Newfoundland the most likely sites.\n\nCabot went ashore to take possession of the land, and explored the coast for some time, probably departing on 20 July. On the homeward voyage his sailors incorrectly thought they were going too far north, so Cabot sailed a more southerly course, reaching Brittany instead of England. On 6 August he arrived back in Bristol.\n\nLack of clear documentation has been a problem in studying the history of \"Matthew\". Even its name has been questioned, with some authors suggesting that it was actually named \"Mattea\" after Cabot's wife. Until the 1950s, all that was known about its size is that it was a small ship carrying about 18 men, but the discovery of a letter from a Bristol merchant named John Day written in 1497 saying that \"in his voyage he had only one ship of fifty 'toneles' and twenty men and food for seven or eight months\" provided more certainty about its size. The age of the ship is also uncertain. The name \"Matthew\" does not appear in the 1492/3 customs accounts, so it was either fairly new or an older ship renamed or a foreign ship. It has been suggested that it probably was an ordinary Bristol merchant ship hired for the occasion. The name \"Matthew\" appears in documents in 1503/04 and 1510/11 but in a 1513 survey there is reference to a 'new Matthew' and references to this ship afterward leave out the 'new' suggesting that Cabot's \"Matthew\" no longer existed.\n\nTo celebrate the 500th anniversary of Cabot's voyage, a replica of \"Matthew\" was built in Bristol by Storms'l Services, a precursor of the Bristol Classic Boat Company. The design was by naval architect Colin Mudie. She was dedicated in a ceremony during the first International Festival of the Sea, held in Bristol's Floating Harbour in 1996. The next year, she reconstructed Cabot's original journey on the 500th anniversary of the landmark voyage. On 24 June 1997 the replica of \"Matthew\" was welcomed into port at Bonavista by Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nThe full-size replica is in length overall with a beam of with a draft of and of sail.\n\nOn 29 February 2012 \"Matthew\"'s ownership was transferred to The Matthew of Bristol Trust, and she was relocated to her new home outside Bristol's M Shed museum.\n\nIn June 2012 she took part in the Queen's Diamond Jubilee pageant on the River Thames.\n\n\n"}

Another version is told in the 13th-century Italian \"novellina\" \"La Damigella di Scalot\" (No. LXXXII in the collection \"Il Novellino: Le ciento novelle antike\"). Two of Tennyson's poems, both titled \"The Lady of Shalott\" (1832 and 1842), were inspired by the Italian version. In the 14th-century English Stanzaic \"Morte Darthur\", she is known as the Maid of Ascolot.\n\nIn Thomas Malory's 15th-century \"Le Morte d'Arthur\", Elaine's story begins when her father Bernard, the lord of Astolat, organises a jousting tournament, attended by King Arthur and his knights. While Sir Lancelot was not originally planning to attend, he is persuaded otherwise and visits Bernard and his two sons before the tournament. While Lancelot is in her family's household, Elaine becomes enamoured of him and begs him to wear her token at the coming tournament. Explaining that Queen Guinevere would be at the tournament, he consents to wear the token but says that he will have to fight in disguise so as not to be recognized. He asks Bernard if he can leave his recognizable shield with him and borrow another. Bernard agrees and lends him the plain-white shield of Sir Torre, Elaine's brother. Lancelot goes on to win the jousting tournament, still in disguise, fighting against King Arthur's party and beating forty of them in the tournament. He does, however, receive an injury to his side from Sir Bors' lance, and is carried off the field by Elaine's other brother, Sir Lavaine, to the hermit Sir Baudwin's cave (Baudwin being a former knight of the Round Table himself). Elaine then urges her father to let her bring the wounded Lancelot to her chambers, where she nurses him.\n\nWhen Lancelot is well, he makes ready to leave, and offers to pay Elaine for her services; insulted, Elaine brings him his shield, which she had been guarding, and a wary Lancelot leaves the castle, never to return but now aware of her feelings for him. Ten days later, Elaine dies of heartbreak. In accordance with her instructions, her body is placed in a small boat, clutching a lily in one hand, and her final letter in the other. She then floats down the river to Camelot (Winchester), where she is discovered by King Arthur's court, who call her 'a little lily maiden'. Lancelot is summoned and hears the contents of the letter, after which he explains what happened. Lancelot proceeds to pay for a rich funeral.\n\nElaine has captured the minds of many artists, becoming one of the most recognizable tertiary characters from the Arthurian legends. Those who have depicted her story in art include Dante Gabriel Rossetti, William Holman Hunt, John William Waterhouse (\"The Lady of Shalott\", \"The Lady of Shalott Looking at Lancelot\", \"I Am Half-Sick of Shadows, Said the Lady of Shalott\"), Howard Pyle, Louis Rhead, Elizabeth Siddal, Eleanor Fortescue-Brickdale, and Robert Gibb, among others.\n\n\n\n"}

The square was a well-known feature of Boston from the mid-19th century to the mid-20th century, when the buildings around it were demolished to make way for the Central Artery and Government Center. The Haymarket produce market continues to operate at a location near the historic site of the square.\n\nDuring the early years of European settlement in Boston, the future site of Haymarket Square was in a part of Boston Harbor called Mill Cove. The mouth of the cove was dammed in the 1640s, turning it into Mill Pond. In 1807, the town of Boston gave the Boston Mill Corporation permission to begin filling in Mill Pond. A street plan for the filled land was proposed in 1808 by Charles Bulfinch. Filling of the pond to create the area known as the Bulfinch Triangle was completed in the early 1820s. The future location of Haymarket Square, where Merrimack, Canal, and Charleston Streets converged at the southern tip of the Bulfinch Triangle, appears on an 1826 map. \nA drawing published in 1895 entitled \"View of the New Land in 1828\" shows Haymarket Square. Images from the early 1800s show hay being sold in the square. The name Haymarket Square appears on an 1844 map.\n\nFrom its opening in 1845 to its demolition in 1897, the most prominent building on the square was the Boston and Maine Railroad depot. In 1893, the depot was replaced by North Union Station, several blocks to the north on Causeway Street. The depot was demolished to make way for construction of the Canal Street Incline, the northern end of the Tremont Street Subway, the predecessor to the MBTA Green Line. The Haymarket station on the subway line opened in 1898, with an entrance kiosk in the center of Haymarket Square. In 1902, the Haymarket Relief Station, a branch of Boston City Hospital, opened in a new building on the former site of the depot on the north side of the square. \n\nMost of the buildings around the square were demolished in the 1950s for the construction of the elevated Central Artery, or in the 1960s for the construction of Government Center. Construction began in January 2017 on Bulfinch Crossing, a 2.9 million square foot redevelopment on the site of the Government Center Garage. The northeast corner of the garage is at the location of Haymarket Square.\n\nThe Haymarket Theatre operated in a building on the other side of Boston Common several decades before the creation of Haymarket Square. \n\nHaymarket Station on the MBTA Orange and Green lines is located adjacent to the historic site of the square.\n\nThe Haymarket produce market is operated by the Haymarket Pushcart Association.\n\n\"Haymarket Square\" was the original name of a hotel and market building which began construction in 2018 on Blackstone Street between Hanover Street and North Street, a block south of the historic location of Haymarket Square. As of spring 2020, the hotel was to be called the \"Canopy Hotel Parcel 9\".\n"}

Geena Davis, Randy Quaid, Jason Robards, Tony Shalhoub, Stanley Tucci, Phil Hartman, Victor Argo, Kurtwood Smith, Bob Elliott and Philip Bosco all co-star. It is based on a book of the same name by Jay Cronley. The film is a remake of the 1985 French film \"Hold-Up\" starring Jean-Paul Belmondo. The film is set in New York City, particularly in Manhattan and Queens, with scenes taking place on the New York City Subway and within John F. Kennedy International Airport. Times Square, the Empire State Building, and the Statue of Liberty are also briefly seen. \"Quick Change\" is the only directorial credit of Bill Murray's career.\n\nGrimm, dressed as a clown, robs a bank in midtown Manhattan. He sets up an ingenious hostage situation and successfully gets away with $1 million and his accomplices: girlfriend Phyllis and best friend Loomis.\n\nThe heist itself is comparatively straightforward and easy, but the getaway turns into a nightmare. The relatively simple act of getting to the airport to catch a flight out of the country is complicated by the fact that fate, luck and all of New York City appears to be conspiring against their escape.\n\nTo begin with, the trio is seeking the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway to get the airport, but the signs were removed during construction work, resulting in the three robbers becoming lost in an unfamiliar neighborhood in Brooklyn. Then, a conman/thief robs the trio of everything they have (except the bank money, which they have taped under their clothes).\n\nAfter changing into new clothes at Phyllis' apartment, they are confronted and nearly gunned down by the paranoid and stressed-out incoming tenant. At the same time, a fire has broken out across the street and the fire department arrives and pushes their car away from a hydrant only to cause it to roll downhill and then down an embankment.\n\nWhen the three crooks eventually manage to flag down a cab, the foreign driver is hopelessly non-fluent in English. This causes a hysterical Loomis to jump out of the moving cab to grab another, but he runs into a newsstand, knocking himself unconscious. The driver leaves, thinking he's killed Loomis. An anal-retentive bus driver, a run-in with mobsters and Phyllis' increasing desperation to tell Grimm the news that she is pregnant with his child add further complications.\n\nAll the while, Rotzinger, a world-weary but relentless chief of the New York City Police Department, is doggedly attempting to nab the fleeing trio. A meeting on board an airliner at the airport occurs between the robbers and the chief, who gets the added prize of having a major crime boss dropped in his lap with their assistance. Unfortunately the chief only realizes who they were after their plane has taken off.\n\n\nDespite being a box office bomb, the film was well received critically. In fact, several critics claim it is one of Murray's finest roles: a jaded man who has had too much of the Big Apple. Also praised were the strong performances by the supporting cast, particularly Robards as the police chief Rotzinger, who, while almost as burned out as Murray, is still determined to capture the robbers as a swan song to his long career.\n\nRoger Ebert, in his July 13, 1990 \"Chicago Sun-Times\" review, wrote: Quick Change' is a funny but not an inspired comedy. It has two directors...and I wonder if that has anything to do with its inability to be more than just efficiently entertaining.\"\n\nThe film currently holds an 82% \"fresh\" rating on review aggregate Rotten Tomatoes based on 33 reviews.\n\n\n"}

Between March 31 and April 2, 1914, 132 sealers were stranded on the ice floes. During their two days and nights on the ice, 77 men died; another man later died from his injuries in a hospital in St. John's.\n\nOn March 30, 1914, \"Newfoundland\" was jammed in ice off the northern coast of Newfoundland. Her captain, Wes Kean, could see signals from the \"SS Stephano\", commanded by his father Abram Kean, indicating that there were seals several miles away. The following morning, Wes Kean sent his crew in that direction across the ice to begin killing seals, under command of his first mate, expecting that if the weather worsened they would stay overnight aboard \"Stephano\". When the men reached \"Stephano\", Abram Kean gave the men lunch and then ordered them back onto the ice to kill seals and find the \"Newfoundland\", despite signs of worsening weather. \n\nAs a storm began that afternoon, both the captain of \"Newfoundland\" and the captain of the nearby \"Stephano\" thought the men were safely aboard the other man's vessel. The company which owned \"Newfoundland\" had removed the ship's radio transceiver because it was an added expense which did not contribute to profits. \"Newfoundland\"s captain, believing that the men were aboard \"Stephano\", did not blow the ship's whistle to signal his location, which would have allowed his men to find the ship in the darkness and rain. The sealers endured two nights without shelter, first in a freezing rain storm and then in a snow storm.\n\nThe dead and survivors alike were picked up around 54 hours later by another ship in the fleet, SS \"Bellaventure\", under Captain Isaac Randell. Of the 132 men aboard \"Newfoundland\", 78 died, and many more were seriously injured. This disaster occurred during the same storm in which sank with all hands. The total loss from all three sealing ships totaled over 250 lives and the collective tragedy became known as the 1914 Newfoundland Sealing Disaster.\n\nThis event was the subject of the book \"Death on the Ice\" by Cassie Brown, and two National Film Board of Canada documentaries: \"\"I Just Didn't Want to Die\": The 1914 Newfoundland Sealing Disaster\" (1991) and the multimedia short \"54 Hours\" (2014).\n\nThe \"Newfoundland \" was sold to Job Brothers & Co. in 1915 and her name was changed to \"Samuel Blandford\" in 1916. A poem about this was written by James Murphy on January 27, 1916.\n\nThe vessel was wrecked when she struck the Keys, near St. Mary's Bay on August 3, 1916.\n\nAnother Newfoundland vessel carried the name \"Newfoundland\" for many years afterwards. This steel steam-liner was mobilized as part of the merchant navy and during peacetime acted as a passenger liner, usually pointing her bow towards Boston or Liverpool.\n\n"}

The hills run from west to east like a long finger away from the main upland area of the Lower Saxon Hills, beginning at the Weser River near Minden and terminating in the vicinity of Osnabrück.\nIt is the northernmost of the German Central Upland ranges extending into the Northern Lowlands.\nTheir highest hill is the Heidbrink near Lübbecke with an altitude of .\n\nThe Wiehen Hills lie within the districts of Osnabrück, Minden-Lübbecke and Herford. Their northern section runs in an east-west direction roughly from the territory of Bramsche (northwest of Osnabrück) via Ostercappeln, Bad Essen, Preußisch Oldendorf and Rödinghausen, Lübbecke, Hüllhorst and Bad Oeynhausen as far as the towns of Minden and Porta Westfalica on the Porta Westfalica gorge and River Weser. They also graze Bohmte and Hille to the north. South of the Wiehen Hills lie Osnabrück, Bissendorf, Melle, Kirchlengern, Bünde, Löhne and Bad Oeynhausen.\nThe Wiehen Hills form the northwestern boundary of the Lower Saxon Hills to which they belong geographically, together with the Westphalian part of the ridge.\nWhilst the eastern end of the hill chain is clearly defined by the Porta Westfalica gorge and the hill of Wittekindsberg, this is not so simple for its western extremity. To the west the Wiehen descends gradually, transitioning from a hilly ridge into a chain of hillocks and then descending almost imperceptibly into the plain. South of Bramsche the ridge rises again at the \"Penter Egge\" to a height of 99 metre, but 2.5 km further west it reaches the level of the surrounding countryside. The waterways of the Mittelland Canal and Osnabrück Canal running away to the south appear to mark the end of the hill range, but west of these canals is the 82-metre-high \"Larberger Egge\" which forms the westernmost cornerstone of the Wiehen Hills, rising just 2 km northeast of the boundary with the province of Münster. Contrary to popular assumption, Ibbenbüren is no longer considered to be situated by the Wiehen Hills and the Ibbenbüren Plateau (\"Ibbenbürener Bergplatte\" comprising the Schafberg, etc.) is no longer part of the Wiehen. Geological reasons, according to current research, do not support such an assumption.\n\nTo the north, the Wiehen descends to the North German Plain into a region known as the Lübbecke Loessland. On the banks of the Weser, opposite Porta Westfalica, lies the Wesergebirge, which is the eastern continuation of the Wiehen Hills. This ridge is of similar geological construction and runs as far as the area of Hessisch Oldendorf to the Süntel hills. Southeast of the Wiehen Hills are the Lippe Uplands, to the south the Ravensberg Hills, to the southwest in the area of the Tecklenburg Land are the northern foothills of the Teutoburg Forest, and to the northwest are the hills of the Gehn and the Ankum Heights, the Damme Hills and the Stemweder Berg. North of the northwestern tip of the Wiehen liest the great bog of the Großes Moor.\n\nThe hills of the Wiehen range from west to east are:\n\nAccording to folklore, regionally conscious residents around the hills usually admit grudgingly that the Wiehen Hills are not particularly high. In the same breath, they may assert, often with a raised index finger and an odd emphasis on the word \"gebirge\" (\"hill/mountain range\"), that they are the northernmost hill range in Germany and the one closest to the sea.\nWhether this assertion is true is in fact a matter of definition. It clearly ignores the morainic ridges further north and closer to the sea, as well as other true uplands such as the Stemweder Berg or the Rehburg Hills. Of course, these hills are much lower and do not reach the 200-metre contour line.\nOf the higher, say up to uplands, the northern foothills of Deister and Bückeberge extend farther north than the eastern Wiehen range. However, it is also true that the highest part of the Wiehen Hills at Lübbecke has the most northerly hill over 300 metres in Germany. The Heidbrink, at almost 320 metres high, is also the northernmost \"three-hundred\" on the European continent between the central Ural Mountains and the Atlantic, i.e. excluding the British Isles and Fennoscandinavia.\n"}

She was referred to as \"God's image carved in ebony\".\n\nSmith was born to slaves in Long Green, Maryland, a small town in Baltimore County. Her father's name was Samuel Berry and her mother's name was Mariam Matthews. The Smiths had thirteen children. Her father was a well-trusted man, and his master’s widow trusted him enough to place him in charge of her farm. After his duties for the day were done, Mr. Berry was allowed to go out and earn extra money for himself and his family. Many nights he would go without sleeping because he was busy making brooms and husk mats for the Baltimore market to make extra cash. He was devoted to the goal of freedom. After first purchasing his freedom, he made it his mission to buy his family's. After his family's freedom was secured, the Smiths settled in Pennsylvania.\n\nGrowing up, Amanda had the advantage of learning to read and write. “Her father made it a regular practice on Sunday mornings to read to his family from the Bible. Her mother helped her to learn reading before she was eight and was sent to school.” Unlike many other enslaved children and adults, Amanda had the privilege of learning at an early age. Amanda and her younger brother attended school at the age of eight. The school only held summer sessions and after six weeks of attending, the school was forced to close. Five years later, at the age of 13, they had been given another option of attending school. However, the school was five miles from their home and they would only be taught if there was time after the teachers gave the white kids their lesson. The Smith siblings felt that it was not worth traveling in the cold to receive lessons only if time was permitted. After two weeks of attending school, they dropped out and were taught at home by their parents and sometimes taught themselves. With only having three and a half months of formal schooling, Amanda went to work near York, Pennsylvania, as the servant of a widow with five children. While there, she attended a revival service at the Methodist Episcopal Church.\n\nAmanda worked hard as a cook and a washerwoman to provide for herself and her daughter after her husband was killed in the American Civil War. By the time Smith was thirty-two, she had lost two husbands and four of her five children. Attending religious camp meetings and revivals helped Smith work through her grief and avoid depression. She immersed herself in the African Methodist Episcopal (AME) Church.\n\nPrayer became a way of life for her as she trusted God for shoes, the money to buy her sister's freedom, and food for her family. She became well known for her beautiful voice and inspired teaching and hence, opportunities to evangelize in the South and West opened up for her. African-American women in the nineteenth century took the way they dressed very seriously and so did others. Being a preacher and traveling as much as Amanda did, she thought out her dress carefully. Wherever she went, she wore a plain poke bonnet and a brown or black Quaker wrapper, and she carried her own carpetbag suitcase. The appearances of women in the nineteenth century have been described as “[Especially] fraught with volatile meanings, as the line between seemingly overly sexual or appearing presumptuously dressed above one’s station was a fine one.” African-American women struggled with receiving the respect they deserved even if they dressed the part of a lady. This was due to “Shadowed stereotypes bred in slavery of wanton Jezebels and pious Mammies…” If free African-American women dressed out of their respective class, judgments would be made against them.\n\nIn 1878, Smith arranged for her daughter, Mazie, to study in England. The two traveled overseas and stayed in England for two years. On the journey over, the captain invited her to conduct a religious service on board and she was so modest that the other passengers spread word of her. \n\nShe next traveled to and ministered in India, where she stayed for eighteen months. Smith then spent eight years in Africa, working with churches and evangelizing. She traveled to Liberia and West Africa. Smith also expanded her family by adopting two African boys. While in Africa she suffered from repeated attacks of \"African Fever\" but persisted in her work. As a strong proponent of the Temperance Movement both in Africa and in the United States, she was invited by noted temperance advocate Rev. Dr. Theodore Ledyard Cuyler to preach at his Lafayette Avenue Presbyterian Church in Brooklyn, New York, then the largest church in its denomination, on her return to America. \n\nAmanda funded The Amanda Smith Orphanage and Industrial Home for Abandoned and Destitute Colored Children. It was an institution for the poor and friendless colored children. Located in North Harvey, in a suburban neighborhood in Chicago, the orphanage opened on June 28, 1899. The institution provided a home for children to become self-reliant. Amanda traveled many states to help gather money to support her work. “Support for this institution depended on interracial cooperation for fund-raising and an advisory board. To raise funds for the initial costs, Smith enlisted Methodist interracial cooperation across the country.” She was dedicated and put forth a lot of energy for the home. However, she soon met conflict with the orphanage due to many problems such as financial, a fire that destroyed the building, conflict between Smith and the staff, complaints from neighbors, and failed inspections by the orphan home investigators. Two years following Smith’s death, another fire broke out in the home killing two girls. The building was closed for good.\n\nIn the early years of the 20th century, Amanda Smith continued to visit various nations and gained a reputation as \"God's image carved in ebony.\" She retired to Sebring, Florida in 1912 due to failing health. \n\nHer autobiography was published in 1893, titled \"An Autobiography, The Story of the Lord's Dealing with Mrs. Amanda Smith, the Colored Evangelist Containing an Account of her Life Work of Faith, and Her Travels in America, England, Ireland, Scotland, India, and Africa, as An Independent Missionary.\"\n\nShe died in 1915 at the age of 78.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1834096", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1834096", "title": "Basse danse", "text": "Basse danse\n\nThe basse danse, or \"low dance\", was a popular court dance in the 15th and early 16th centuries, especially at the Burgundian court. The word \"basse\" describes the nature of the dance, in which partners move quietly and gracefully in a slow gliding or walking motion without leaving the floor, while in livelier dances both feet left the floor in jumps or leaps. The basse danse was a precursor of the pavane as a dignified processional dance . The term may apply to the dance or the music alone.\n\nThe earliest record of a basse danse is found in an Occitan poem of the 1320s by Raimon de Cornet, who notes that the \"joglars\" performed them.\n\nThe \"bassa danza\" is described in the dance treatise of Guglielmo Ebreo da Pesaro, in northern Italy towards the end of the 15th century, and by his friend Antonio Cornazzano, for whom it was the queen of all dance measures, low dance to be contrasted with the \"alta danza\", the \"high\" or leaping dance called the \"saltarello\". In Germany it became the \"Hofdantz\" .\n\nThoinot Arbeau used the basse danse to explain his method of dance notation in his \"Orchésographie\" (1589). The dance was danced until 1725 but was extinguished soon after by the \"high\" dance technique of ballet \n\nThe general measure of the basse danse was elaborated into different named sequences of steps and movements . The basic measure is counted in sixes but, like the later courante, often combines and time, using hemiola to divide the six as 3–3 or as 2–2–2. This rhythm matches the basic steps of the dance. Most basse danse music is in binary form with each section repeated .\n\nThe basse danse was often followed by a tourdion, due to their contrasting tempi, and these were danced and composed in pairs \"en suite\" like the \"pavane and galliard\" and the \"allemande and courante\" (; ).\n\nEarly music consisted of songs based on a tenor cantus firmus and the length of the choreography was often derived from the verse of the \"chanson\". In performance three or four instrumentalists would improvise the polyphony based on this tenor. In others multiple parts were written, though choice of instrumentation was left to the performers.\n\nMost famous, perhaps, are the basses danses assembled in 1530 by Pierre Attaingnant in the \"Attaingnant Dance Prints\", which were for four voices, typically improvised upon by adding melodic embellishment (Attaingnant rarely wrote ornamentation, though he did in \"Pavin of Albart\", an embellishment on \"Pavane 'Si je m'en vois'\") .\n\nA treatise in the Royal Library of Belgium in Brussels gives us information about the elements of basse danse and the choreography of specific examples. The basse danse is based upon four steps: \"pas simple\", \"pas double\", \"démarche\" (also known as the \"reprise\") and \"branle\".\n\n\nThe \"révérence\", occurring typically before or after the choreography, is a bow or curtsy that takes place over the course of one measure.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is one of the four national radio channels produced by Deutschlandradio.\n\nBroadcasting in the Federal Republic of Germany is reserved under the Basic Law (constitution) to the states. This means that all public broadcasting is regionalised. National broadcasts must be aired through the national consortium of regional public broadcasters (ARD) or authorized by a treaty negotiated between the states.\n\nIn the 1950s, the German Democratic Republic (GDR) began broadcasting its Deutschlandsender station on longwave. In response to this, the then-Nordwestdeutscher Rundfunk applied for a licence to operate a similar longwave service on behalf of the ARD. This was granted in 1956 and operated as Deutscher Langwellensender (\"German Longwave Station\").\n\nOn 29 November 1960, the federal government under Konrad Adenauer created \"Deutschlandfunk\" as a national broadcasting corporation based in Cologne. At the same time, the government's attempted creation of a national television channel under its direct control (later to become ZDF) prompted a complaint from several states to the Federal Constitutional Court regarding broadcasting powers. In the \"\", handed down on 28 February 1961, the court held while that broadcasting \"to\" Germany was not a power granted to the federal government and therefore delegated to the states, broadcasting \"from\" Germany to other countries fell under the federal government's responsibility to conduct foreign affairs.\n\nWhen Norddeutscher Rundfunk's licence to broadcast on longwave expired, the federal government acquired the frequencies for Deutschlandfunk and began transmissions on 1 January 1962, joining the ARD on 7 June.\n\nDeutschlandfunk broadcast primarily in German, targeting the GDR and German-speaking minorities in Eastern Europe. However, its European Department was responsible for foreign-language transmissions to neighbouring countries in Europe, primarily from the Ehndorf transmitter. From 7 June 1963 it began foreign language transmissions in Czech, Croatian, Polish and Serbian. Later it focused on the Federal Republic's free neighbours in northern Europe, including English programming for Ireland and the UK. Inter-continental broadcasts were the responsibility of Deutsche Welle. Back in 1989, also news on the half-hour were placed next to the hourly news.\n\nAfter reunification, negotiations between the states and the Federal Government led to a reorganization of Germany's national and international public broadcasters in which DLF lost its independence and ARD membership.\n\nOn 1 July 1993, DLF's European Department was transferred to Deutsche Welle. DLF English programmes were phased out over several years and replaced by DW's intercontinental programmes.\n\nThe rest of DLF was merged into Deutschlandradio (\"Germany Radio\"), a public broadcasting institution created to oversee national services, from 1 January 1994. DLF was given a new remit as a news and current affairs service, while retaining its staff and studio facilities in Cologne. The service remains free of advertising. In the years immediately after the merger it was sometimes referred to as \"DeutschlandRadio Köln\" (\"Germany Radio Cologne\").\n\nDeutschlandradio developed its service and beside of Deutschlandfunk( mainly news and information) and Deutschlandfunk Kultur (culture in a broader sense) they started Deutschlandfunk Nova, which is based on production also from Deutschlandfunk and targets young adults, mainly with spoken-word. The Dokumente und Debatten is an opt-out channel, often for special events and significant parliament debats.\n\nDeutschlandfunk's schedules are largely made up of news and documentaries, covering politics, economics and science. Music is also aired, especially during nighttime and weekend hours, it can account for half of the airtime.\n\nDeutschlandfunk broadcasts a news bulletin every half hour weekdays between 04:00 and 18:00, and every hour at all other times (except Saturday at 21:00). In even-numbered hours between 06:00 and 20:00; everyday at 13:00 and weekdays at 23:00, the bulletins can last up to 10 minutes; and 5 minutes at all other times. The traffic bulletins cover the information of the whole Germany.\n\nOn weekdays, the morning news magazine \"Informationen am Morgen\" is broadcast between 05:00 and 09:00, with frequent news bulletins. News magazines are also broadcast between 12:00 and 13:30 (\"Informationen am Mittag\"), and between 18:00 and 18:40 (\"Informationen am Abend\"). The main evening bulletin (\"Das war der Tag\" (\"That was the Day\")) is from 23:10 to 23:57. Selections from German and international newspaper commentaries are interspersed in the morning, noon, and midnight news magazines.\n\nOn Sundays, a discussion programme called \"Essay und Diskurs\" is broadcast between 09:30 and 10:00, covering subjects as varied as Islam in Germany, neurophysiology and the history of art. These discussions are archived on the internet .\n\nDeutschlandfunk provides programming for the German-language Belgian radio station BRF-DLF in Brussels. It also cooperates with the main Belgischer Rundfunk (BRF) domestic radio service for the East Cantons of Walonia, BRF1.\n\nDeutschlandfunk broadcasts in FM, DAB, and broadcast digitally via the Astra satellite system and used in the German and some European cable networks.\n\nUntil the Geneva Frequency Plan of 1975 came into effect on 23 November 1978, Deutschlandfunk was transmitted on longwave from Sender Donebach and on mediumwave from Bad Dürrheim, Cremlingen, Ravensburg, Ehndorf, and Mainflingen. With implementation of the plan Bad Dürrheim was shut down. In 1979 new transmitters came into service: in Erching for daytime longwave transmission and in 1980/81 in Nordkirchen and Thurnau for mediumwave transmission.\n\nOn 1 January 1989 the Aholming transmitter replaced Erching and allowed 24-hour service on the second longwave frequency. On 1 October 1994 Heusweiler transmitter, which had previously transmitted \"Europawelle Saar\", began transmitting Deutschlandfunk. On 31 December 1994 Mainflingen transmitter was shut down. On 31 December 2014 longwave transmissions from Donebach on 153 kHz and Aholming on 207 kHz ceased, although Donebach 153 kHz continued into the early hours of 1 January 2015 before being shut down.\nOn 31 December 2015 all remaining medium wave transmissions ceased at 2350 CET.\n\nFM transmitters carry the Deutschlandfunk signal throughout Germany but there are gaps in the coverage pattern, especially — but not only — in the southern states of Bavaria and Baden-Württemberg. As the state authorities have the power to allocate frequencies to broadcasters, they give preference to the regional public and commercial broadcasters under their jurisdiction.\n\nHigh quality webcast of Deutschlandfunk is available in MP3 and Ogg Vorbis formats.\n\n\n"}

The gun was also adopted as the standard anti-tank gun of the US Army.\n\nAlthough designed before the start of the war, it did not reach service until the North African Campaign in April 1942. There, it replaced the 2-pounder as an anti-tank gun, allowing the 25 pounder gun-howitzer to revert to its intended artillery role. The United States Army also adopted the 6-pounder as their primary anti-tank gun as the 57 mm Gun M1.\n\nLimitations of the existing 2-pounders were apparent even as the gun entered service and an effort was made to replace it with a much more capable weapon starting as early as 1938. The Woolwich Arsenal was entrusted with the development of a new gun with a calibre of 57 mm. Guns of this calibre had been employed by the Royal Navy from the late 19th century and manufacturing equipment was available. The gun design was complete by 1940 but the carriage design took until 1941. The production was further delayed by the defeat in the Battle of France. The loss of equipment - most of the heavy equipment of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) was left behind in France during Operation Dynamo - and the prospect of a German invasion made re-equipping the army with anti-tank weapons an urgent task, so a decision was made to carry on the production of the 2-pounder, avoiding the period of adaptation to production and also of re-training and acclimatisation with the new weapon. It was estimated that 100 6-pounders would displace the production of 600 2-pounders.\nThis had the effect of delaying production of the 6-pounder until November 1941 and its entry into service until May 1942.\n\nUnlike the 2-pounder, the new gun was mounted on a conventional two-wheeled split trail carriage. The first mass production variant—the Mk II—differed from the pre-production Mk I in having a shorter L/43 barrel, because of the shortage of suitable lathes. The Mk IV was fitted with an L/50 barrel, with muzzle brake. Optional side shields were issued to give the crew better protection but were apparently rarely used.\n\nThe 6-pounder was used where possible to replace the 2-pounder in British tanks, requiring work on the turrets, pending the introduction of new tanks designed for the 6-pounder. The Churchill Marks III and IV, Valentine Mark IX and Crusader Mark III all began to enter service during 1942. The Valentine and Crusader both needed to lose a crew member from the turret. Tanks designed to take the 6-pounder were the troubled Cavalier, the Cromwell and the Centaur. When the Cromwell went into combat in 1944, it was armed with the Ordnance QF 75 mm gun, which was a redesign of the 6-pounder to take US 75 mm ammunition and more useful against general targets. The 6-pounder was also fitted to the AEC Armoured Car Mark II.\n\nAlthough the 6-pounder was kept at least somewhat competitive through the war, the Army started development of a more powerful weapon in 1942. The aim was to produce a gun with the same general dimensions and weight as the 6-pounder but with improved performance. The first attempt was an 8-pounder of 59 calibre length but this version proved too heavy to be used in the same role as the 6-pounder. A second attempt was made with a shorter 48 calibre barrel but this proved to have only marginally better performance than the 6-pounder and the program was cancelled in January 1943.\n\nThe 6-pounder was followed into production by the next generation British anti-tank gun, the Ordnance QF 17 pounder, which came into use from February 1943. As a smaller and more manoeuvrable gun, the 6-pounder continued to be used by the British Army for the rest of World War II and for about 20 years afterwards. A 57/42.6 mm squeeze bore adaptor was developed for the gun but was never adopted. The gun was produced in Canada and South Africa, where the Combined Ordnance Factories (COFAC) produced 300.\n\nThe idea of manufacturing the 6-pounder in the US was expressed by the US Army Ordnance in February 1941. The US Army still favoured the 37mm Gun M3 and production was planned solely for lend lease. The US version, classified as substitute standard as 57 mm Gun M1, was based on the 6-pounder Mark II, two units of which were received from the UK. Since there was sufficient lathe capacity, the longer barrel could be produced from the start. Production started early in 1942 and continued until 1945. The M1A1 variant used US Combat tyres and wheels. The M1A2 introduced the British practice of free traverse, meaning that the gun could be traversed by the crew pushing and pulling on the breech, instead of solely geared traverse, from September 1942. The M1 was made standard issue in the Spring of 1943. A more stable carriage was developed but not introduced. Once the 57 mm entered US service, a modified towing point design was introduced (the M1A3) for US use. Tractors for the M1 included the Dodge WC-63 1-Ton 6×6 and the White Half-Track.\n\nTwo-thirds of American production (10,000 guns) went to US Army Divisions in Europe. About one-third of production (over 4,200 guns) was delivered to the UK and 400 guns were sent to Russia through Lend Lease. When the United States re-armed and re-equipped Free French forces for the Normandy landings, their anti-tank units received American-made M1s. Like the British Army, the US Army also experimented with a squeeze bore adaptor (57/40 mm T10) but the program was abandoned. American shell designs and production lagged behind the introduction of the gun once it was accepted for service and so, at first, only AP shot was available. The HE shell was not available until after the Normandy landings and UK stocks were procured to cover its absence. Its use by regular US Army front-line units was discontinued in the 1950s.\n\nThe 6-pounders (and the US-built M1 of which 4,242 guns were received) were issued to the Royal Artillery anti-tank regiments of infantry and armoured divisions in the western theatres (four batteries with 12 pieces each) and later in the war to the six-gun anti-tank platoons of infantry battalions. An air-landing battalion had an AA/AT company with two four-gun AT platoons. The Far East theatres had lower priority and different organisation, reflecting the lower tank threat. The gun was also employed by Commonwealth forces in formations similar to the British. The anti-tank ammunition was a basic Armour-Piercing (AP) shot, but by January 1943 an Armour-Piercing, Capped (APC) shot and an Armour-Piercing, Capped, Ballistic Capped (APCBC) shot was supplied. A High Explosive shell was produced for use against un-armoured targets.\n\nThe 6-pounder first saw action in May 1942 at the Battle of Gazala. It made an immediate impact on the battlefield as it was able to penetrate any enemy tank then in service. In the most celebrated action, the 6-pounder guns of 2nd Battalion, The Rifle Brigade (together with part of 239 Anti-Tank Battery Royal Artillery under command), destroyed more than 15 Axis tanks in the action at Outpost Snipe during the Second Battle of El Alamein. Over the next year, the Germans introduced much heavier tanks into service, notably the Tiger I and Panther. The standard 6-pounder shot was ineffective against the front armour at any range but proved effective on the less armoured sides and rear.\n6-pounder gunfire accounted for the first Tigers disabled in North Africa; two Tigers being knocked out by towed 6 pounder AT guns, while the 48th Royal Tank Regiment knocked out the first Tigers by the Western Allies in tank vs. tank action with their Churchill tanks, destroying two Tiger I (the same unit also knocked out the first Panther tanks by the Western Allies in May 1944 in Italy). The North Irish Horse disabled and captured Tiger 131 after the crew had abandoned it after it received several hits, most seriously a shot which struck the turret ring, making traverse impossible. The situation was somewhat improved by the development of more sophisticated ammunition in the form of the Armour-Piercing, Composite Rigid (APCR) shot and the Armour-Piercing, Discarding Sabot (APDS) shot, which was available from 1944 and made it effective against the frontal armour of Tiger Is and Panthers.\n\nIn the Royal Artillery regiments, the 6-pounders were joined by the 17-pounders starting in 1943; in infantry units, the gun remained the sole AT gun in service until 1951, when it was finally declared obsolete and replaced by the 17-pounder in the British Army of the Rhine (BAOR).\n\nThe first tank to go into action armed with the 6-pounder gun was the Mark III version of the Churchill tank, in the Dieppe Raid of August 1942. They were deployed to North Africa; six, as KingForce, were in action at El Alamein in October (destroying five tanks and three AT guns for the loss of one Churchill).\n\nThe Royal Navy used the 6-pounder extensively in Motor Gun Boats during World War II (especially the Fairmile D). The gun was mounted on a hydraulic-powered mount and fitted with the Molins power loading system, permitting a six-round burst at one round per second. The guns were all the early short-barrel (43 calibre) type, and fired exclusively HE (high-explosive) ammunition, at much lower muzzle velocities than for AP (armour-piercing), because of the use of flashless propellant for night operations. The naval designation was QF 6-Pounder Mk IIA; nearly 600 of these weapons were made.\nThe Molins autoloader was also deployed on a small number of Royal Air Force de Havilland Mosquitos of Coastal Command, which were referred to as the \"Tsetse\" (after the Tsetse fly). Officially the QF 6-pdr Class M Mark I with Auto Loader Mk III, it was based on the long-barrelled (50 calibre) gun. It was fully automatic, with a rate of fire of about 55 rounds per minute and 21 rounds. It was intended for use against U-boats and fired solid shot that could penetrate their hulls through of water. The weapon was used to sink a U-boat and to shoot down a Junkers 88 aircraft. It was replaced in 1943 by the more versatile but less accurate RP-3 3-inch Rocket Projectile.\n\nIn spring 1943, following the experience of the North African Campaign, the Infantry branch of the US Army recognised the need to field a heavier antitank gun than the 37 mm M3. The Ordnance QF 6-pounder was introduced into US service as the 57mm M1, following standard US nomenclature.\n\nIntroduction was made in the face of objections by the US Army Infantry Board, which believed it to be too heavy. The Ordnance Board, on the other hand, felt that a more powerful weapon should be introduced; the Airborne and Cavalry rejected it.\n\nAccording to the Table of Organisation and Equipment (TO&E) from 26 May 1943, a regimental antitank company included nine 57 mm guns and each battalion had an antitank platoon with three guns, giving a total of 18 guns per regiment. Dodge WC-62/WC-63 6×6 1½ ton trucks were issued as artillery tractors in place of the 3/4 ton truck used with its predecessor the 37mm. Because of the unexpected adoption into service, the only ammunition type in production in the US was the AP ammunition.\n\nBy mid-1944, the M1 was the standard antitank gun of the US infantry in the Western Front and outnumbered the M3 in Italy.\n\nPreparation for the D-Day invasion of Normandy highlighted an additional need. The Airborne Command had rejected the 57 mm M1 in the summer of 1943, claiming that it was unfit for airlanding by glider due to its weight and the TO&E of February 1944 still had airborne divisions keeping their 37 mm guns. To increase firepower, the 82nd and the 101st airborne divisions were re-equipped with British-manufactured 6 pounders on the narrow carriage Mk III designed for glider use—24 in AA battalion, and 9 in each glider infantry regiment—for the Normandy airdrops. In the fighting after the Normandy landings, the paratroops used them against German armour near St Mere Eglise and Carentan. However, few tanks were encountered and they were mostly used for support, which made the lack of an HE shell more significant.\n\nThe British 6 pounder with the MK III carriage was also used by 442 AT Company as part of the glider invasion force assigned at that time to the 517th Parachute Infantry Regiment, First Airborne Task Force, during Operation Dragoon; the invasion of Southern France.\n\nLimited availability of different ammunition types limited the efficiency of the gun in the infantry support role. Only after the Normandy Campaign did the HE round reach the battlefield (although US units were sometimes able to get a limited amount of HE ammunition from the British Army). The canister shot was not seen in significant amounts until early 1945. Some British stocks of APDS were supplied to the US units, although APCR and APDS rounds were never developed by the US.\nFrom July, US anti-tank units encountered the Panther tank, which was vulnerable to the 57 mm only from the sides. Towed anti-tank guns were less effective in the hedgerow terrain, where mobility suffered; but, when the Germans went on the offensive in August, they were effective in defence with infantry.\n\nSubsequently, the guns were officially introduced under the TO&E from December 1944. According to the TO&E, a division was issued 50 pieces: 8 in the divisional artillery, 24 in the AA battalion, and 18 in the glider infantry regiment; parachute infantry regiments did not have anti-tank guns. The British guns were referred simply as 57 mm guns.\n\nTowards the end of the war, towed anti-tank units were out of favour due to their lack of mobility compared to self-propelled guns and the 57mm was used by infantry battalions. However, with few tanks to contend with, some units that would have been equipped with the 57mm were instead deployed as rifle companies or only with the Bazooka. The M1 went out of service in the US soon after the end of the war.\n\nIn addition to being used by the US, British and commonwealth forces, the M1 was supplied under the lend lease program to the Free French Forces (653), USSR (400) and Brazil (57). Guns captured by the Germans were given the designations 5.7 cm PaK 209(e) and 5.7 cm PaK 202(a). The Israel Defense Forces employed the 6-pounder in the 1950s in brigade-level anti-tank battalions and battalion-level anti-tank platoons (the latter formations were disbanded in 1953). By late 1955, the Israel Defense Forces possessed 157 pieces and 100 more were purchased from the Netherlands in 1956, too late to enter service before the Suez Crisis. Some of those are described as \"57-mm guns, nearly identical to the 6-pounders and firing the same ammunition\", which apparently makes them US-built M1 guns. The gun was also used by the Pakistani Army; numerous examples can still be seen as 'gate guards' outside army bases in Pakistan. The Irish Army acquired six 6 pounder anti-tank guns in the late 1940s. The US 57 mm M1 gun is popular with modern-day cannoneers, as there is a relatively good supply of shell casings and projectiles. The gun is also reportedly still in active military use with some South American countries, and in coastal defense emplacements of outlying island garrisons of the Republic of China Army.\n\nDuring the Biafran War, from 1967 to 1970, both the Nigerian Federal Army and the Biafran armed forces, including some Biafran vessels, used the 6-pdr gun.\n\nCarriage types, British:\nCarriage types, US:\n\nTank gun versions of the 6-pounder were used in Crusader III, Cavalier, Centaur I and II, Cromwell I to III, Valentine VIII to X and Churchill III and IV, and also in the Canadian Ram Mk II and the prototype American Light Tank T7E2. The Deacon and the experimental Alecto Mk II self-propelled guns also mounted the 6-pounder. Another experimental vehicle armed with the 6-pounder was a Firefly tank destroyer, based on the Morris Light Reconnaissance Car. The only mass-produced vehicle mounting the 57 mm M1 was the M3 Half-track based 57 mm Gun Motor Carriage T48 (also known by its Soviet designation \"SU-57\"). The production of the T18E2 armored car also known as Boarhound, was stopped after 30 units were built. A project for a tank destroyer armed with the M1—the 57 mm Gun Motor Carriage T49—was cancelled after a single pilot vehicle was built. Similarly, the wheeled 57 mm Gun Motor Carriage T44, based on Ford 4×4 ¾ ton cargo carrier chassis, was cancelled after a brief testing.\n\n<nowiki>**</nowiki> The statistics for British APDS rounds aren't clear about which length of barrel fired the projectile.\n\nIn use as a tank gun, penetration was 81 mm (for Mark 3 gun) and 83 mm (Mark 5) at 500 yards and target at 30°.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Hegang is one of the principal coal-producing cities in China. Hegang covers an administrative area of and according to the 2010 Census, has a population of 1,058,665 inhabitants. Its built-up area is home to 664,471 inhabitants spread out over 5 urban districts including Dongshan being urbanized, even though still largely rural.\n\nThe region of Hegang was a desolate and uninhabited area until the late 1890s. In 1906, the area of Hegang City was under the administration of Tangyuan County under the Qing Dynasty. Since then, the government has been encouraging people to farm in the region. In 1914, a coalfield was discovered in Haoli, and Heilongjiang Government approved to set up Xinghua Mines () which is jointly invested by merchants including Shen Songnian (). The area was also renamed Xingshan () after the Xinghua Coal Mine. The Hegang mines were founded in 1916 by a Chinese entrepreneur with Russian capital. Hegang has witnessed rapid economic growth thanks to its rich coal resources. In 1926 a railway was built between Hegang and Jiamusi, some 30 miles to the south on the Songhua River. A coal carrier fleet was privately financed in 1930 by General Zhang Xueliang. On August 1932, Hegang mines were occupied by the Japanese as the Japanese Empire advanced through Manchuria. The mines were further developed during the Japanese occupation of Manchuria. On August 11, 1945, Hegang was occupied by the Soviet Red Army, and was relegated to the Communist Force. Since several major coal mines in southern Manchuria were controlled by Kuomintang Forces, Hegang became one of the main coal-producing area of Communist Force in the Chinese Civil-War, playing an important role in guaranteeing the acquisition of weapons and other war materials. Hegang was renamed in 1949, and set up as a prefecture-level city in Heilongjiang.\n\nAfter 1949 the city experienced further rapid growth. The mines were extended and modernized, and their annual output increased dramatically. Most of the coal is high-quality coking coal that is also used to make coal gas; apart from a small quantity consumed in Jiamusi, the bulk of it is shipped by rail to Anyang, Henan and to other industrial cities such as Anshan and Benxi in Liaoning. By the late 1950s the coal industry employed more than 80 percent of the working population. Although the mines continued to be developed and output increased, Hegang's industrial activity was beginning to diversify, especially after a large thermal-power-generating installation was constructed by the early 1970s.\n\nHegang is located in the northeast part of Heilongjiang province, spanning from latitude 47° 04′−48° 9′ N to longitude 129° 40′−132° 31' E. Bordering prefecture-level cities are:\nThe region also faces Russia's Jewish Autonomous Oblast across the Amur River with an international border of . Lesser Khingan Mountains crosses the city. The total administrative area of Hegang is . Amur river and Songhua river are the main rivers in Hegang.\n\nHegang has a humid continental climate (Köppen \"Dwb/Dwa\"), with long, bitterly cold, but dry winters, and humid and warm summers. The monthly 24-hour average temperature ranges from in January to in July, and the annual mean is . Close to 2/3 of the annual precipitation falls in the months of June thru August. Extreme temperatures have ranged from −38.5 to 37.7 °C.\n\nThe prefecture-level city of Hegang is divided into 6 districts and 2 counties. The information presented here uses the metric system and data from the 2010 Census.\nIn 2010, Hegang's GDP grew 16.1% to RMB 25.1 billion, ranking tenth among 13 prefectures and prefecture-level cities in the province. Agriculture and animal husbandry are considered two pillars of the city's primary industry. Heavy industry dominates the city's industrial sector. Other major industries in the city include agricultural products processing, food and beverage, pharmaceuticals, dairy and related products,forestry industries, and the production and supply of electricity.\n\nThe Yichun-Hegang Highway, the Jiamusi-Hegang Highway and the Hegang-Luobei Highway form a comprehensive highway network within the city. It takes less than four hours to drive from Hegang to Harbin, the provincial capital of Heilongjiang Province. Luobei Port, which is within a one-hour drive from Hegang, is a major port on the Amur River. Jiamusi Airport, a one-hour drive from Hegang, operates flights to Beijing, Dalian and other major cities domestically.\n\n\n Birobidzhan, Jewish Autonomous Oblast, Russia\n\n\n"}

Nonetheless, contemporary features in \"Melody Maker\" (where the genre was championed mainly by Simon Price and Taylor Parkes – it was dismissed by the rival \"NME\") tended to downplay the nostalgic connection with New Romantic, emphasising Romo's newness and contemporary relevance.\n\nMuch championed by the aforesaid writers at the \"Melody Maker\" as a stylish and poppy backlash against the dressed-down style of the Britpop movement, while variously feted and lambasted by others in the media as a New Romantic revival (a tag rejected by those on the scene), Romo's prime legacy has been chiefly in club culture as it heralded a new generation of glam/style orientated club nights which would continue through the 2000s.\n\nClub Skinny was created in Spring 1995 by promoters Kevin Wilde and Paul \"HiFi\" Nugent as a club playing stylish 1980s pop as an antidote to the fashion for indie-derived Britpop. The club was originally located at Camden's Laurel Tree venue, then the home of top Britpop clubnight Blow Up. Wilde and Nugent regarded it as a subversive and \"punk\" act to host their glamorous pop night at a major epicentre of the indie/Britpop movement they were opposing. Although initially forced to make the compromise of including concerts by upcoming Britpop bands in order to attract punters, the club gained momentum after members of Persecution Complex, a female David Bowie-influenced band noted for their flamboyant dress sense, became regulars at the club, attracting a flow of further flamboyant club-goers in their wake.\n\nA further development was the recruitment of two glamorous 1980s-styled bands Plastic Fantastic and DexDexTer, the former a Brighton-based Roxy Music/Japan-influenced outfit fronted by former Scorpio Rising/Supercharger frontman Stuart Miller, the latter formerly known as MkII and led by Xavior (born Paul Wilkinson, also formerly known as Paul Roide). a future Placebo keyboardist. The two bands were duly scheduled to double-headline the 17 August edition of Club Skinny. In addition, one of the aspiring Britpop bands who had been playing at the club, Viva, led by Derek 'Del' Gray, were inspired by the club to reinvent themselves as a pure pop/disco outfit in the same vein as ABC circa \"The Lexicon of Love\". Wilde would subsequently become the manager of both Viva and DexDexTer.\n\n\"Melody Maker\" writer Simon Price was already alert to the existence of Plastic Fantastic and had previously linked them, together with Sexus, a Manchester-based \"intelligent handbag\" duo consisting of singer David Savage and keyboard player Paul Southern (together formerly indie guitar duo Sanity Plexus) and a non-glamorous electronic act called Boutique, as \"New Romo\" [sic] in a June 1995 review for Sexus's debut single Edenites. (His colleague Everett True also heavily used the term Romo for a Plastic Fantastic review that summer) Price was invited to the aforementioned double bill edition of Club Skinny and, with the event judged a success by all concerned, not only began to cover the scene enthusiastically in his writing, converting his colleague Taylor Parkes along the way, but also opened up a second clubnight for the scene in Soho, named Arcadia. This was based at L'Equippe Anglais in Duke Street but later moved to legendary Soho drag bar Madame Jojo's.\n\nClub Skinny meanwhile also relocated to HQ's a venue in Camden Lock Market close to Dingwalls starting with the club's 31 August 1995 edition. A Plastic Fantastic/Viva/DexDexTer triple bill at the venue on 28 September 1995 was reviewed by Parkes in memorable fashion:\n\nBy this time, more acts were emerging from the scene. Orlando who had played live as an indie band in 1993-1994 before withdrawing to reinvent themselves as an \"alienated\" white soul duo consisting of singer Tim Chipping, guitarist/lyricist Dickon Edwards and some sidemen, approached Club Skinny to relaunch themselves as a live act. Punk trio Xerox Girls likewise reinvented themselves as a glacial synth/electro duo Hollywood consisting of singer Hannah Edgren and keyboardist Stacey Leigh, with third member David Gray (Leigh's then-boyfriend) retained as a synth programmer. Gray would later become Orlando's live drummer while Nugent would take over the management of both bands.\n\nThe scene began to achieve mainstream media coverage with a feature on Arcadia in Katie Puckrick's \"Sunday Show\" featuring live footage of Plastic Fantastic and Sexus (by now a full part of the Romo scene) and interviews with the two aforementioned bands, Xavior from DexDexTer and Simon Price, and queue/crowd/dancefloor footage of Arcadia featuring Wilde, Grey, Chipping, Edwards, Edgren and Leigh. By the end of 1995, media coverage of Romo had included TV coverage on ITV, Sky News and an unspecified Japanese TV news programme, radio coverage on BBC Radio 1 and BBC World Service and print media coverage in \"Time Out\", \"The Observer\", \"The Guardian\", \"The Sunday Times\", as well as colour features in style magazines \"The Face\" and \"i-D\". Tabloid newspaper the \"Daily Star\" also printed an enthusiastic but largely inaccurate full page article depicting the scene as a straightforward New Romantic revival.\n\n\"Melody Maker\" meanwhile continued its enthusiastic coverage, culminating in a cover-featured Romo special defining the scene. The cover image was a group shot of Chipping, Miller, Savage and Xavior clad in their Romo finery, while the feature identified seven core bands – the aforementioned Orlando, Plastic Fantastic, DexDexTer, Sexus, Hollywood, Viva, and linking in one non-scene band Minty, the former musical project of the late Leigh Bowery being continued after his death by his widow Nicola and various artistic friends, most notably singer Mathew Glammore. More significant was the inclusion of a \"Romanifesto\" by Price and Parkes which ideologically defined Romo as the rejection of authenticity in music in favour of creative artifice, a militant pop sensibility (which placed Romo in direct opposition to both rockism and the values of alternative music) and the ideal of recreating/reinventing oneself as a glamorous Star-type persona.\n\nThe 9 March 1996 edition of \"Melody Maker\" gave away a compilation cassette of Romo bands entitled \"Fiddling While Romo Burns\". Five bands featured on the tape – DexDexTer, Hollywood, Plastic Fantastic, Viva (whose track \"Now\" was co-produced by Marc Almond and Neal X) and Orlando – Sexus and Minty having by now decided to keep their distance from the scene. Despite Minty's non-involvement in the tape, its individual members and collaborators contributed to the continuing flow of fresh Romo acts such as Elizabeth Bunny and Massive Ego, the latter featuring a young Dan Black on guitar. Other newcomers to the scene were Universe (a similar \"perfect pop\" concept to Viva) and Acacia (an earlier incarnation of which featured future Mercury Music prize winner Talvin Singh.) German pop act Sin With Sebastian also played Arcadia during this time. Romo club culture also continued to develop with the launch by Price and Gray of Saturday night clubnight Paris 6 am at Oscars nightclub in Leicester Square as well as two clubs organised by other parties – The Cell at Gossips in Dean Street promoted by Stewart Ubik and the Roxy Motel Club at The Fridge in Brixton.\n\nThe climax of all this activity was a package tour of Romo bands, also entitled \"\"Fiddling While Romo Burns\"\", featuring a quadruple bill of Orlando, Plastic Fantastic, Hollywood and DexDexTer (with live drummer Laura \"Elle\" Schellino). Although the showcase London concert (also featuring Viva) at the LA2 venue was a 750 capacity sellout and reasonable crowds were also attracted to the Brighton and Manchester shows, other provincial dates on the tour – mostly at student venues that were the fodder of the very indie music that the militantly pop Romo movement opposed – failed to attract large audiences and those that did attend were generally sceptical. More seriously, the strain of having to live, eat and sleep together rather than merely go nightclubbing together had severely strained relations between the bands. Chipping was relatively diplomatic about this in one interview at the time: \"There's a definite reason why we have two tourbuses. It's to do with the fact that some bands just won't tour with each other, not because they dislike each other, they just have different... living styles.\" Nevertheless, by the end of the tour, all of the seven core acts originally featured in the \"Melody Maker\" special had recording contracts with either major or big independent labels – Orlando with WEA subsidiary Blanco y Negro Records, Plastic Fantastic with Mercury Records, Sexus with ZTT, Hollywood with U2's Mother Records label, DexDexTer with Island Records subdivision Trade2, Viva with Planet3 Records and Minty (whose transvestite drummer Trevor Sharpe had filled in as drummer for Plastic Fantastic on the tour) with Candy Records.\n\nAfter the tour, Price wrote an editorial in \"Melody Maker\" declaring the movement dead as it had achieved its aims but was now being soured by the revivalist portrayal in the mainstream media. Despite this, the scene in London continued with more bands emerging such as Anglo-Japanese female quartet Étoile as well as the arrival in Britain of Donovan Leitch's band Nancy Boy. Another late major addition to the scene at around this time was Belvedere Kane, fronted by Romo scene face Barry Stone, later of the Jewels And Stone writing/production partnership. In his review of the latter's gig, Price recanted his \"Romo is dead\" declaration, dismissing it as a red herring tactic and further adding that the continued spread of Romo was by now beyond even his control. At around this time, a first anniversary party was held for Club Skinny headlined by Crush, the band of former Byker Grove TV stars Donna Air and Jayni Hoi. However, continued tensions in the scene led to the discontinuation of both Skinny and Arcadia in July 1996. Romo activities continued at the individual bands' concerts, although one Plastic Fantastic concert at Dingwalls from this time ended in a mass brawl after a hat was thrown onstage. Plastic Fantastic also had a residency at the Dublin Castle, Camden during this period, although this was terminated by management after an incident where stage invaders performed a sex show.\n\nThe bands mostly concentrated on their recording contracts at this point – in late 1996 Hollywood released a heavily remixed single \"Apocalypse Kiss\" while Plastic Fantastic – having previously released the Eno-influenced \"Fantastique no.5\"- recorded a planned album \"Autumn\" which was never released due to a dispute with Mercury over the mix of planned second single \"Plastic World.\" Sexus, who had also released a second single \"The Official End Of It All\" and recorded an album \"The Boyfriend Olympics\", similarly fell out with ZTT over the mix of planned third single \"How Do You Kiss\". Personal differences between Xavior and his bandmates led to the demise of DexDexTer in early 1997 just as their single \"Another Car Another CarCrash\" was released. Both parties remained signed tor Trade2; the bandmates as ExDexTer recorded demos for the label but were swiftly dropped as eventually was Xavior in 1998 after he had recorded an unreleased solo album, \"Chainsaw Mass Appeal\" and appeared in the film \"Velvet Goldmine\". After several years producing, playing keyboards for Placebo and recording further unreleased solo albums, he would reemerge as a frontman in the late 2000s fronting Paul St Paul and the Apostles with David Ryder Prangley. Viva meanwhile, despite continuing to demo material, never released any records and would later rename themselves Scala 5 and revert to a heavier guitar sound before their demise circa 2000. Stuart Miller dissolved Plastic Fantastic and revived his old band Supercharger, while Hollywood's Hannah Edgren was spotted (by Dickon Edwards) fronting a new band in 1998 – she and Stacey Leigh would later reunite as Fubar. Sexus were frozen into inactivity due to a dispute with management after the fallout with ZTT – they would eventually re-emerge in 2002 as the Psychodelicates with a download/mail order album \"Psychodelicates Go Adventuring\".\n\nThus by the middle of 1997 it was left to Orlando and Minty to be the most prolific – and in that sense the most successful – Romo bands as they were the only two of the seven core acts to reach the stage of releasing their respective albums. Orlando, having already released two singles \"Just for a Second\" and \"The Magic EP\" in late 1996 (the latter of which achieved #96 on the UK Singles Chart) and a third, \"Nature's Hated\" in spring 1997, having toured extensively with Kenickie and having scored the only UK Top 75 chart hit of any core Romo act with their contribution to the \"Fever Pitch\" soundtrack EP, a cover of Tim Hardin's \"How Can We Hang On to a Dream\", released their album \"Passive Soul\" in October that year before Dickon Edwards departed to found Fosca. Tim Chipping would continue to use the Orlando band name for a planned folk-orientated second album under the working title \"Sick Folk\" (to have included a collaboration with Kenickie/Rosita members Marie Du Santiago and Emmy-Kate Montrose), before finally dissolving Orlando in Spring 2000. Minty, likewise, having released singles \"Useless Man\", \"Plastic Bag\" (a No. 2 hit in the Netherlands), \"That's Nice\" and \"Nothing\", released their parent album \"Open Wide\" in late 1997 before also disbanding, with some members later forming rock band The Servant. With all the core bands and major London clubnights now defunct (or at least no longer in their Romo incarnations), the Romo scene effectively came to an end.\n\nIn Romo's wake over the next several years came a fresh wave of glam/style orientated clubnights. One of the first of these was Club Kitten, the successor to Club Skinny, based at the latter's old location of HQ's in Camden and featuring Stuart Miller as DJ. Another important post-Romo club was Stay Beautiful, run by Simon Price at various London locations from 2000–2009 and in Brighton 2011-2016. Several other Romo musicians ran glam/style orientated club nights – notably Minty vocalist Mathew Glammore's \"Kashpoint\" (at a January 2004 instalment of which Glammore performed a medley of old Minty songs and a March 2005 instalment of which featured a Minty reunion), Xavior's \"Hanky Panky Kabaret\" clubnight (and associated meetings in London's Wolsey restaurant) and Dickon Edwards' \"Beautiful And Damned\" and \"Against Nature\". Wilde and Nugent would later unleash another scene – the Club Rampage/Club P*rnstar \"Bratpop\" scene in late 1998 (also the beneficiary of a \"Melody Maker\" cover special).\n\nOther promoters also hosted such glam/style-orientated clubnights in the 2000s – most notably Glam-Ou-Rama, which later relocated to Tel Aviv. Romo Night in Sweden, first established in 1996 during the original London scene's lifetime, was still active as of 2003.\n\nRomo was also frequently cited as a precedent for (if not actually an influence on) the electroclash scene of the early 2000s. \"The Disciples\" by James Mollison, a book of photographs of music fans, includes a spread of photos of fans at a London concert by major electroclash act Fischerspooner, mostly dressed in Romo-style attire (one of whom is Simon Price).\n\nWriting and production team Xenomania, who became critically and commercially successful in the 2000s for their work with groups such as Girls Aloud and Sugababes, started out as remixers for songs by several Romo bands, including Hollywood's \"Apocalypse Kiss\" and Sexus' \"How Do You Kiss?\". According to Tom Ewing of \"Freaky Trigger\", writing in 2003, Xenomania's Romo roots could be heard in their then-current work. Writing in 2004 in regards to Xenomania's commercial success, Ewing said: \"You can find Romo links everywhere if you look!\" Ewing also compared Hollywood (whose repertoire had included \"Lost in Moscow 3am\") to Russian duo t.A.T.u., who he said were \"entirely Romo, though it would be more accurate to say that Romo was a spirited runt in a litter that also birthed them.\"\n\nOne wing of Romo bands, such as Plastic Fantastic and DexDexTer cleaved towards art-glam. Although actually mostly referencing Brian Eno's \"Here Come the Warm Jets\" (particularly the tracks \"Baby's on Fire\" and \"Needles in the Camel's Eye\"), Fantastique no.5 was reviewed in the NME by Pulp members Russell Senior and Candida Doyle as \"Ro-mu - as in Roxy Music. The influences are that transparent!\"\n\nOther bands such as Viva, Belvedere Kane, Sexus and to a lesser extent Orlando, took inspiration from the nightclub-orientated Hi-NRG/Handbag house chart pop of the mid 1990s. Viva bassist Lee David described how his band's sound \"came from going to clubs and seeing what got people dancing.\" Sexus's sound was characterised by Price as \"intelligent handbag.\" Musically, Orlando combined the synthesised dance-pop of 1990s boybands and American swingbeat acts with verbose lyrics in the general style of Morrissey and Richey Edwards.\n\nThe dance-pop influences seeped through to the scene's art-glam wing also - interviewing Plastic Fantastic, Melody Maker's David Bennun suggested that the band's preferred mix of Plastic World (by dance producer Howard Hughes) \"sounds like Hawkwind gone disco.\" Hollywood's single \"Apocalypse Kiss\" (transformed from the original dark electropop 1995 demo to a piano house sound by remixers Apollo 440) was described by Tom Ewing of \"Freaky Trigger\" as \"gothy handbag with big production and those flattened Europop vowels.\"\n\nDespite the Romo scene being a backlash against the values of Britpop and indie, Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic nonetheless characterised it as \"a fey, arty offspring of Britpop,\" noting that the genre took influence from \"a touch of irony, modernist art, a healthy love of the Style Council and the Spice Girls, inspiration from Pulp, jealousy of Menswear, a vague idea of Roxy Music, heritage in the Smiths and the Manics, and a minor obsession with Dead Poets Society.\" Erlewine furthermore summarised that \"Romo essentially boiled down to a cross between Adam Ant, Roxy Music, Pulp, and Blur, with a hint of an idea of what Bowie may have meant.\"\n\nBeing as it was an attack on the very notion of authenticity in music, Romo's inauthenticity was itself declared pernicious by its opponents. While Erlewine praised \"Fiddling While Romo Burns\" he nonetheless complained \"...There's nothing but style and artifice here, and at crushing levels ... it's filled with affectation and pretension.\". Others were more blunt about this, such as Super Furry Animals frontman Gruff Rhys. \"I hate Romo\" he declared, \"it's so plastic!\"\n\n\n\"See Orlando discography\"\n\n\"See Minty Discography\"\n\nSingles:\nThe two ZTT singles also each included a remix of the respective lead tracks. Both were reissued in full on iTunes as most of \"ZTT – The Singles Collection – Volume 3\"\n\nSingle:\n\nSingle:\n\nSingle:\n\nPromo cassette singles (1995):\n\nIn addition to the above, in the early 2000s unreleased Sexus tracks were uploaded to the Pyschodelicates website and unreleased Viva and Plastic Fantastic tracks were uploaded by Nugent to the This Is Romo website. Considerable further material by Plastic Fantastic was uploaded to SoundCloud and YouTube 2016-2019 by guitarist/keyboardist Shadric Toop. Demo tapes of Hollywood, the above listed DexDexTer cassette tracks and Xavior's \"Chainsaw Mass Appeal\" album also circulated as bootlegs among the Club Skinny/Arcadia attendees community.\n\n"}

It was his second film after \"Une Visite\" in 1955 but it is considered his \"first short film of any real consequence\". Truffaut simply called it \"my first real film\". Moreover, it was Bernadette Lafont's film debut. She was at that time Gérard Blain's wife. The film demonstrates already some examples for Truffaut's \"trademark tracking shots\" and would \"help define his style\" as well as \"set Truffaut on a path for his career\". Truffaut's narrative stresses the details of life, hereby establishing one of the traits of the French New Wave. Thus he also became a predecessor of French film directors such as Jean-Pierre Jeunet (\"Amélie\"). It has been stated that the formation of the French New Wave could be \"tracked through two short films\": Jean-Luc Godard's \"All the Boys Are Called Patrick\" and Truffaut's \"Les Mistons\". In 2013 the Museum of Modern Art in New York City screened this film together with Truffaut's \"The 400 Blows\".\n\nThe story takes place in Provencal France, where a group of young boys (\"mistons\" roughly translates \"brats\") are infatuated with a beautiful young woman. Jealous of her passionate affair, they conspire to make mischief for the woman and her boyfriend.\n\nThe film was shot on location in Bernadette Lafont's hometown Nîmes in Southern France. It sports the town's Roman arena. It was shot on 35mm film without live sound.\n\nIn 1999 the film was released on a DVD which also contained \"Antoine and Colette\". In 2007 \"Les Mistons\" was again released, this time as a part of a DVD collection. The extras included an introduction by film historian Serge Toubiana and an audio commentary by Truffaut's assistant, Claude de Givray.\n\n"}

It lies 3 miles southwest of the small town of Eccleshall and about 1 mile west of the village of Woodseaves, both on the A519. Woodseaves is the largest settlement in the parish, which also includes the hamlet of Shebdon to the WSW of High Offley, as well as a number of scattered houses and small farms (such as on Grub Street).\n\nThe Shropshire Union Canal runs through the parish, to the southwest of the villages of High Offley and Woodseaves, with the Shebdon aqueduct and wharf in the west of the parish, from Shebdon towards Knighton.\n\nThere is a church dedicated to St Mary: \"\"High Offley Church, St Mary, is an ancient Gothic fabric, neatly pewed with oak. It has an excellent organ, which was given by John Salmon, Esq, of London, a native of this parish. It has several monuments of the Skrymsher and other families, and a handsome one was erected in 1851 in memory of the late Bishop Ryder, at the expense of the present vicar.\"\"\n\nPevsner dates most of the church to the 13th century with some earlier Norman features and some from later periods.\nThe core of the church dates from the 12th century, and features from the 13th century are still present, including the lower stages of the tower and the south arcade. Most of the rest of the church is from the 15th and 16th centuries and is Perpendicular in style, including the nave, chancel, and upper part of the tower. There was a limited 19th-century restoration. which included the addition of a south porch. Inside the church, the nave roof is \"an outstanding and well-preserved work of late-medieval carpentry\", which includes bosses carved with heads and foliage.\n\nHigh Offley once had a pub called the \"Royal Oak\", which has now been converted into a private residence. In the parish, near to the village on Peggs Lane, and lying by the Shropshire Union Canal, is the popular \"Anchor Inn\". Being a simple, traditional public house that has changed little in fifty years, it is very highly rated by the canal boating fraternity and many locals. It is regularly featured in the annual CAMRA Good Beer Guide and has a small gift shop. It also gives its name to the adjacent bridge, which takes Peggs Lane over the canal.\n\nAlso within the parish is a pub in Woodseaves (the \"Cock Inn\"), where there were previously also two more pubs (the \"Tavern\" and \"Plough\", the latter of which is currently closed, and the former was turned into a private residence in the late 1990s). There was previously one in the Shebdon area, also by the canal, called the \"Wharf Inn\" (now a private residence).\n\nIn Douglas Adams's \"Meaning of Liff\", a High Offley is defined as a \"Goosnargh three weeks later\".\n\n"}

He has released music under many names, of which most well known is his solo project, Prometheus, and his collaboration with Twisted Records label colleague, Simon Posford, under the moniker Younger Brother. His music is characterized by distinct basslines, high production quality, intense thematic development and unique or alternative approaches to the psytrance genre. He frequently combines diatonic melodic content with metallic or \"glitchy\" percussive polyphonic elements to form thick contrapuntal tapestries of sound. Although much of his music sounds like it was composed using equipment at the forefront of technology, it is not uncommon for him to use equipment now considered antique, such as the 1971 Korg micro synth that he used for portions of the second album, \"Corridor of Mirrors\".\n\nBenjamin Vaughan founded a tech startup, called Disciple. Disciple is a community media platform that, unlike Facebook or a website, empowers community hosts to build, manage and control their own private, social apps. The platform gives communities their own mobile meeting spaces to gather and interact in the ways that work for them.\n\nHe has released three albums as Prometheus; \"Robot-O-Chan\" (2004), \"Corridor of Mirrors\" (2007), and \"Spike\" (2010). The albums have been well received by the trance community for their innovation, dancefloor appeal, and their incorporation of non-traditional influences. \"Robot-O-Chan\" features two down-tempo tracks, whereas \"Corridor of Mirrors\" maintains a consistent trance bent.\n\nYounger Brother have released four albums to date, \"A Flock of Bleeps\" (released in 2003), \"The Last Days of Gravity\" (2007), \"Vaccine\" (2011) and 'Vaccine electronic'. Younger Brother’s musical output is much more varied than that of Prometheus, with tracks ranging from the psychedelic French ballad, \"The Receptive,\" to progressive breakbeats such as \"Weird on a Monday Night\", to sounds reminiscent of Pink Floyd on their recent album.\n\nOn 2 September 2013 his debut solo album \"Even Tundra\" was released on Spotify and as a digital download.\n"}

His last film role was as the alcoholic director Burke Dennings in \"The Exorcist\" (1973).\n\nMacGowran was born on 13 October 1918 in Dublin. He established his professional reputation as a member of the Abbey Players in Dublin, while he achieved stage renown for his knowing interpretations of the works of Samuel Beckett. He appeared as Lucky in \"Waiting For Godot\" at the Royal Court Theatre, and with the Royal Shakespeare Company in \"Endgame\" at the Aldwych Theatre. He released an LP record, \"MacGowran Speaking Beckett\", to coincide with Samuel Beckett's 60th birthday in 1966, and won the 1970–71 Obie for Best Performance By an Actor in the off-Broadway play \"MacGowran in the works of Beckett\".\n\nHe also specialised in the work of Seán O'Casey, creating the role of \"Joxer\" in the Broadway musical \"Juno\" in 1959, based with O'Casey's 1924 play about the Troubles, \"Juno and the Paycock\". Fittingly, he played O'Casey's brother Archie in \"Young Cassidy\" (1965), one of John Ford's last films (which the director had to abandon due to ill health).\n\nIn 1954 he moved to London, where he became a member of the Royal Shakespeare Company. There he struck up a lasting friendship with Peter O'Toole, with whom he later appeared in Richard Brooks' \"Lord Jim\" (1965).\n\nHowever he apparently had a somewhat fractious relationship with Royal Shakespeare director Peter Hall. He was Old Gobbo in \"The Merchant of Venice\" and when the set arrived Hall called all the cast into the theatre to view it. MacGowran was not there, still in his dressing room. An assistant was sent to fetch him. He returned alone: \"Mr MacGowran says, Mr. Hall, that if you had read the play you would know that Old Gobbo was blind.\"\n\nMacGowran played the title role of \"Gandhi\" in the Broadway play written by Gurney Campbell in 1971, directed by Jose Quintero.\n\nMacGowran's film career started in Ireland with the film \"No Resting Place\" (1951), and many of his earlier films were set in Ireland. Notably \"The Quiet Man\" (1952), \"The Gentle Gunman\" (1952), \"Rooney\" (1958) and \"Darby O'Gill and the Little People\" (1959).\n\nIn 1966 Roman Polanski cast him as the gangster Albie in \"Cul-de-sac\", before creating Professor Abronsius in \"The Fearless Vampire Killers\" (1967) especially for him. Other notable film appearances include the Ealing comedy \"The Titfield Thunderbolt\" (1953), Tony Richardson's \"Tom Jones\" (1963), David Lean's \"Doctor Zhivago\" (1965), Richard Lester's \"How I Won the War\" (1967), Peter Brook's \"King Lear\", the leading role of Professor Collins in \"Wonderwall\" (1968), and \"Age of Consent\" (1969). On TV he also appeared in \"The Happening\", an episode of \"The Champions\" and as professor Poole in The Winged Avenger episode of The Avengers TV Series. He played a safecracker opposite Kenneth Cope in \"The Ghost Talks\" episode of \"Randall and Hopkirk (Deceased)\". His last film was \"The Exorcist\" (1973), where he played Burke Dennings, an alcoholic director and Regan's first victim.\n\nIn 1963, he married Aileen Gloria Nugent, daughter of the Irish MP for South Westmeath and Senator of the Irish Free State, Sir Walter Nugent, Bt.\n\nShortly after completing work on \"The Exorcist\", while in New York City appearing as Fluther in Seán O'Casey's \"The Plough and the Stars\", MacGowran died at 54 from influenza after complications resulting from the recent London flu epidemic. He had one daughter.\n\n"}
{"id": "1834175", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1834175", "title": "Fort San Pedro", "text": "Fort San Pedro\n\nFuerte de San Pedro is a military defense structure in Cebu (Philippines), built by the Spanish under the command of Miguel López de Legazpi, first governor of the Captaincy General of the Philippines. It is located in the area now called Plaza Indepedencia, in the pier area of the city. The original fort was made of wood and built after the arrival of Legazpi and his expedition. In the early 17th century a stone fort was built to repel Muslim raiders. Today's structure dates from 1738 and is the oldest triangular bastion fort in the country. It served as the nucleus of the first Spanish settlement in the Philippines. During the Philippine Revolution at the end of the 19th century, it was attacked and taken by Filipino revolutionaries, who used it as a stronghold. \n\nThe fort is triangular in shape, with two sides facing the sea and the third side fronting the land. The two sides facing the sea were defended with artillery and the front with a strong palisade made of wood. The three bastions are named La Concepción (SW); Ignacio de Loyola (SE), and San Miguel (NE). It has a total inside area of . The walls are high by thick (20 feet high by 8 feet thick), and the towers are high from the ground level. The circumference is . The sides are of unequal lengths and the one fronting the city is where one may find entry into the fort. Fourteen cannons were mounted in their emplacements most of which are still there today. Work first started in 1565 with Miguel Lopéz de Legazpi breaking ground.\n\nLittle was known about the activity of the fort from the time it was built until two centuries later in 1739 when the King of Spain, Philip V, desired information regarding the island of Cebu. Governor-general Tamón, who was the Spanish ruler of the islands at the time made the following report:\nFuerte San Pedro, the fort is described as built of stone mortar with a terreplein where guns are mounted. The fort contains the necessary buildings. The largest of these buildings was the \"Cuerpo de Guardia\" where the personnel that manned the fort lived. Adjacent to it was the \"vivienda del teniente\" which was the living quarters of the lieutenant of the fort. In between the aforementioned buildings is a well. At one corner attached to the walls of the bastión San Miguel (NE) was the \"Almacenes de Pólvora\" (powder magazine).\n\nThe date of construction of the stone fort is uncertain, although there are claims that a Jesuit Antonio Campioni built a stone fort in 1630, and the gate of the fort bears the date 1738 together with the arms of Castile and Leon. It is certain, however, that the fort underwent major renovations in the late 19th century as part of a building program to improve Cebu.\n\nThe victory of the Americans led by Commodore Dewey at the Battle of Manila Bay in 1898 marked the end of the Spanish era in the Philippine Islands. The fort was then surrendered by the Spaniards to the Cebuano revolutionaries.\n\nFort San Pedro became a part of the American Warwick barracks during the American regime. From 1937 to 1941 the barracks was converted into a school where many Cebuanos received their formal education. During World War II from 1942 to 1945, Japanese residents of the city took refuge within the walls. When the battle to liberate the city of Cebu from the Imperial Japanese forces was fought, the fort served as an emergency hospital for the wounded.\n\nFrom 1946 to 1950, Fort San Pedro was an army camp. After 1950, the Cebu Garden Club took over and fixed the inner part and converted it into a miniature garden.\n\nAlthough already in ruins, the upper deck was utilized for different offices. First, as a clinic of the City Health, as office of the Presidential Arm and Community Development then the City Public Works Unit used the ruins of the lieutenant's quarters as its field office.\n\nIn 1957 mayor Sergio Osmeña Jr. jolted the public with his announcement to demolish Fort San Pedro and erect on the spot a new City Hall. This started a movement against the demolition idea. Articles voicing opposition appeared in the local dailies and magazines in Cebu City and in Manila. Finally, confronted by civic leaders and society heads at his Cebu City Hall office, he gave up his idea and said he will use instead the space behind the fort.\n\nIn the very same year, the city council commissioned \"The Lamplighter\", a religious sect, to manage a zoo subsidized by the city within the fort courtyard.\n\nBy 1968, the façade, quarters and walls of the original structures of Fort San Pedro were so obliterated that only the two towers were recognizable. Plans for the restoration of the fort was started and the zoo was relocated.\n\nPlans and estimates for the restoration of the fort were completed by architect Leonardo Concepción, who had completed his MA in Building restoration in Madrid. The project was jointly funded by the Board of Travel Industry (now Department of Tourism), the Cebu City Government, and the Cebu Zonta Club.\n\nThe Fort San Pedro restoration was a tedious, time and labor consuming project. To restore the fort as close to the original as possible, coral stones which were hauled from under the sea along Cebu coastal towns were utilized. Delivered crudely cut to the restoration site, the fort laborers did the final cutting and polishing to make the blocks fit each other.\n\nWork progressed slowly but the façade, the main building, (Cuerpo de Guardia), the walk and the observatory roof garden were faithfully restored after one and a half years. To make the project functional; the restored main building serves then as the Cebu Office of the Department of Tourism, the lieutenant's quarters now houses a museum, the inner court is an open-air theater and its immediate vicinity is a park.\n\nAt present, it is under the care and administration of the city of Cebu, as a historical park under City Executive Order No. 08-87 of February 20, 2008. This order also known as Plaza Independencia - Fort San Pedro Interim Policy and Advisory Board (PIFSIPAB) appointed Hon. Michael L.

{"id": "1834178", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1834178", "title": "Crondall", "text": "Crondall\n\nCrondall is a village and large civil parish in the north east of Hampshire in England, in a similar location to the Crondall Hundred surveyed in the Domesday Book of 1086. The village is on the gentle slopes of the low western end of the North Downs range, and has the remains of a Roman villa. Despite the English Reformation, Winchester Cathedral (or its Dean and Chapter) held the chief manors representing much of its land from 975 until 1861. A large collection of Anglo-Saxon and Merovingian coins found in the parish has become known as the Crondall Hoard.\n\nVarious earlier spellings have the intuitive, post-Norman spelling of \"u\" instead of \"o\" and the village is still pronounced as it has been for centuries by rooted residents or by those who correctly abstract the sound from 'front': in the 10th century 'Crundelas' was recorded; throughout the 14th century it was 'Crundale'.\nAn Old English crundel was a chalk-pit or lime quarry, and the word has survived in the name of Crondall. The remains of one quarry can still be seen as a large depression on the golf course.\n\nCrondall's southern boundary is the North Downs along which ran the prehistoric Harrow Way, an ancient unpaved route in Britain which ran from the Cornish tin mines to Dover in Kent. Near this stretch of today's Pilgrims' Way is evidence for neolithic settlements: an Iron Age earthworks at Caesar's Camp.\n\nRemains of Roman settlements have been found close beside the Harrow Way near Barley Pound. Evidence for Roman occupation can be found in the fields as broken tiles and artefacts. In 1817 an intact Roman mosaic pavement was found by a ploughman, 200 yards north of Barley Pound Farm and which is commemorated by a tapestry in the parish church. Coins from the third century were found in 1869.\n\nKing Alfred the Great bequeathed the Hundred of Crondall to his nephew Æthelhelm in 885. In 975 it was handed over by King Edgar to the monks at Winchester and remained in their hands until 1539. At this time Henry VIII dissolved the monasteries and within two years Crondall was controlled by the new Dean and Chapter of Winchester Cathedral. Crondall remained in their hands until 1861, when it was taken over by the Ecclesiastical Commissioners.\n\nThe Crondall Hoard of one hundred and one old French and Anglo-Saxon coins, two jewelled ornaments, and a chain was found in 1828. Some of these date to the fifth century and ninety seven of the coins are now in the possession of the Ashmolean Museum at Oxford. The hoard was deposited after c. 630; of its 101 gold coins, 69 were Anglo-Saxon and 24 were Merovingian or Frankish.\n\nThe map of Hampshire in the 1722 edition of William Camden's \"Britannia or Geographical Description of Britain and Ireland\" shows symbols for major habitation in Farnborough, Cove, Ewshot, Aldershot and Crookham in the Crundhal (Crondall) hundred, a strategic collection of lands with a meeting place at which the wealthy and powerful would convene as needs require, and which came to hold Hundred Courts, a level above the Manorial courts.\n\nThe Hundred of Crondall was divided into 'Manors', Itchell, Ewshot, Crokeham/Crookham Well, Feldmead, Dippenhall, Farnborough and Aldershot. These Manors are all mentioned in the records of Winchester Cathedral. All the land within the Hundred was administered by a steward landowner at Crondall on behalf of \"the monks of St Swithen\" and later on behalf of Winchester Cathedral.\n\nBy the early 19th century the Cathedral as manorial owner owned the pick of the surrounding five tithings, the last three of which came to be villages: Crondall, Swanthorpe, and portions of Dippenhall, Church Crookham and Ewshot. This contrasted with lesser agricultural fertility land, much of which was common land and which was no longer connected with the manor.\n\nThe Giffard/Gifford of Itchel(l) family acquired a Coat of Arms in the Middle Ages. Itchell Manor's gardens (house demolished 1954) were laid out by Capability Brown. A greenhouse, built 1840, is still in use and a Tudor Gateway remains.\n\nJohn Gifford died seised of the manor in 1563, leaving a son George, then aged 10 years. A third part of the manor passed to his widow who married William Hodges of Weston Sub Edge. In 1579, shortly after George Giffard came of age, Henry Wriothesley, 2nd Earl of Southampton, desiring to add it to his neighbouring estate of Dogmersfield, purchased the estate. After 1628 the estate passed through several hands and in the 18th still had these closes/farmstead localities technically in its freehold: The Hyde, Little Potter's Fore, Earlins, Two Downs, Tanley, Green Park, Park Corner, Dean's Piddle, Old Hop Garden.\n\nAll Saints' Church in Crondall was a minor parliamentary outpost for much of the English Civil War, guarding the western approaches to Farnham.\n\nA Tithe Map of The Hundred of Crondall, dated 1846, is housed at the Hampshire County Archive in Winchester.\n\nCrondall has for centuries been rich farming land. A great variety of soils appear in the area because it lies on the edge of the London Basin including chalk, clay and heavy fertile loam. There are many natural springs in the area that were used as watercress beds and for growing osier trees for basket weaving. Some of the baskets were incorporated into the balloon baskets and airship gondolas used by S.F. Cody in his early aviation experiments at Farnborough. For two centuries up to the Second World War, the area was also renowned for hops. For many years Crondall had a brickworks that supplied tiles and brick to local towns.\n\nBarley Pound is a large ring-motte with four baileys and is one of the best examples of a ring and bailey fortress in Hampshire. The fortification may be the \"Lidelea Castle\" which was mentioned in the \"Gesta Stephani\" for 1147, when it was besieged and captured by King Stephen. After its return to Henry of Blois, Bishop of Wincheter it was abandoned in favour of Farnham Castle. Archaeological work has uncovered evidence of an 8-inch thick wall along with a masonry keep.\n\nTo the east is Powderham Castle which was a siege-castle to Barley Pound. It too was founded by the Bishop of Winchester and built during The Anarchy in the reign of King Stephen. It was originally an earth and timber ringwork fortress, encased by a ditch and with a counterscarp bank. Due to the demolition of its encasing rampart, the ringwork now resembles a low flat-topped motte. It now also has a dense cover of trees. Excavations on the mound have uncovered post-holes and large flints which may indicate former buildings.\n\nThe 12th-century Norman parish church, All Saints, which operates as part of the Parish of Crondall and Ewshot, has been called 'The Cathedral of North Hampshire'. It replaced a Saxon church on the same site and the Saxon font remains from that period. The east end of the Nave dates to 1170. The original bell tower was poorly designed for the weight of the bells it housed and by 1657 the whole tower had to be dismantled to prevent its total collapse. In 1659 a new brick tower, modelled on St Matthews in Battersea, was erected at the NE corner of the original structure.\n\nAmong notable interior features are an early brass of 1370, the dogtooth mouldings of the chancel arch and the imposing arcades and foliate capitals of the Nave. To date All Saints has undergone two major restorations, the first in 1847 by the architect Benjamin Ferrey and the second in 1871 under the guidance of Sir George Gilbert Scott. In 1995 the \"National Association of Decorative and Fine Arts Societies\" (NADFAS) declared All Saints to be one of the finest examples of architecture of its style in the country.\n\nThere have been reported sightings of the ghosts of Parliamentarian soldiers, including a mounted Roundhead in full battle dress, in the churchyard, following the use of the church as a minor outpost during the English Civil War.\n\nThroughout Crondall there are many well-preserved old houses and cottages. The Plume of Feathers pub is an example of Tudor architecture and was a resting stop on the turnpike to Portsmouth.\n\nA panoramic view of this part of Hampshire may be gained from Queens View looking from East to West across Crondall. It takes its name from the fact that Queen Victoria admired this view whilst inspecting troops garrisoned at nearby Aldershot \"Home of the British Army\". Oliver Cromwell is reputed to have stayed in the Plume of Feathers in October 1645, when the siege of Basing House was in progress.\n\nNotable residents include Field Marshall Edwin Bramall, former Head of the British Army and D-Day veteran and Chris Fawkes, a weatherman for the BBC.\n\n\n\n"}

The sons are still too young to take over the company, so Bitten Clausen takes on the role as head of the board. At that times the company had yearly sales of 500 million Danish kroner, and the factory had grown to 10.000 m2.\n\nExpansion into other countries started in 1956, when the company started to build a factory in Flensburg in Germany. The factory was complete in 1958.\n\nChina is also an important market for Danfoss. In 2013 two new factories were opened on the same day, bringing the number up to seven. At that time the Chinese market was the third biggest for the company.\n\n\"The Danfoss Group\" manufactures products and provides services used in:\nDanfoss employs approximately 28,000 people worldwide with its headquarters in Nordborg, Denmark.<br>\nIn 2002 Danfoss joined the United Nations Global Compact, consisting of nine principles with social and environmental responsibility.\n\n\"Bitten og Mads Clausens Fond\" was established as a self-governing institution in 1971 by Bitten Clausen.

It generally occurred on the 3rd Saturday of every month from 9.00 pm to 2.30 am at Leeds University Union.\n\nThe night was started in May 1998 by three graduates of the University of Leeds, who wanted the north of England to have something comparable with events at London venues such as The Slimelight and The Electric Ballroom. The Wendy House closed its doors after the final night, which was held on 21 June 2014.\n\nOriginally the night was held in the (now defunct) Harvey Milk Bar of Leeds University Union. In 2001, during construction work at the Union, the event moved to the Bassment at the Merrion Centre in the city centre.\n\nIn 2002, the event returned to Leeds University Union, where it remained up until closure in 2014. As in the early days, it occupied two floors, the main room being the Stylus venue while the Pulse venue (formerly known as Bar Coda) was occupied by the Mutate room, which took a more industrial and underground electronic angle. In 2005 they also briefly featured a third \"indie\" room.\n\nThe night claimed to have become the largest event of its type in the north of England. In order to fill the larger venue, it became less of a pure goth night (though its organisers say it was never strictly intended to be one), and more of a general alternative night, playing music from the 1980s onwards. It had an emphasis on fun and not taking itself too seriously— typically closing the evening by playing a Britney Spears track.\n\n"}
